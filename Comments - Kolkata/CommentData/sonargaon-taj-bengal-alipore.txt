This was my first ever 5 star dinning experience... Visited long time ago... I still remember the day... I was afraid and shy while entering the property... But with time it turned to be an wonderful or life time experience... Amazing place... Mind blowing decor... Top notch service... Courteous staffs... And over all the food... It was awesome... I still remember about the Parsi Kulfi... It was an unique dessert I ever had... 
Undoubtedly the pricing was high... But it worth a visit...

The first dinner on the new year ought to be special and with the same intention we headed for Sonargaon (translated in English as Golden Village) . The ambiance of the duplex restaurant awestruck me due to its simplicity yet very close eye been kept towards every detailing on each wall and ceiling. The interior of the restaurant depicting story of a small village.
Thanks to prior reservation we got our table on arrival at the restaurant. Post settling down went through the menu and shortlisted Dhania Murg, Dal Sonargaon, Gilafi Kulcha and Onion Chilli Kulcha. The chicken dish and the dal was so creamy that we were lost in its taste. The air filled fluffy Gilafi Kulcha was one of its kind which has no filling of masala. Tad sweet in taste but makes such a lovely combination with Dal. But Onion Chilli Kulcha stole our heart, was a perfect marriage with main courses on our table.
Will be injustice if we don't mention that flavor bursting crispy papad at the beginning of our culinary journey and the Mitha Paan to end our experience in a royal way. Wah Taj!!
Service was super prompt and servers were so courteous. Price will be on the higher side but can ignored for those special days.

Birthday and an inevitable visit. More crowded than expected, probably due to the festive season. Yet service was impressive. The lady who was waiting our table, an intern by the name Baani (if I can remember correctly) made sure of that. 

The complementary Masala Papad which is less spicy than the ones they serve at ITC, kept my mouth running. As the starter arrived, Bhatti ke Murg, the centre of attention changed. A tandoori chicken of sorts, Bhatti ke Murg is cooked perfectly, with the right amount of spicy sour. The chatni of course, could've been better. But the meat itself, delicious!

Tandoori Kulchas with a filling of cottage cheese, makes one wonder how such simple food can at times be surprisingly good. Sunheri Nalli Gosht to go with it. The pieces of mutton succulent, the gravy exceptionally delicious, irresistible. 

Some Dum Gosht Biriyani too in the end. Not the usually overspiced type we have at the regular eateries. Different taste here. Raita dense enough to smoothen your palette. A bill of Rs 5300, quite satisfactory!

It was our anniversary lunch and we zeroed to Sonargaon. Being a speciality restaurant it has the most important rule which they do follow is "Serve it Fresh" we had to wait a little but it's all worth it.. we ordered.. Aam Pana Shorbot, Kakori Kebab, Raan Sonargaon (their speciality dish), Mutton Biriyani and Parsi Kuli followed by yummiest 'Paan'. The decor gives you Sonar Graam Bangla feel... We absolutely loved it... Well mannered staffs and beautiful instrumental, everything was just perfect.. Kakori Kebab was as smooth as butter..Raan Sonargaon is Lamb delicacy, light flavours and aroma of the same made it heavenly.. the biriyani was not upto the mark.. as we are just in love with our KOLKATA STYLE BIRIYANI and no other style can beat it. We missed the potato chunk badly :( Parsi Kulfi is more like malai Kulfi but the style is definitely different, we loved it as well and Paan was complementary which was like Sone pe Suhagaa.. or Jol na chaitei brishti kind of... Thank you Sonargaon for making our special day memorable with your mouth watering delicacies.

Visited this place during Durga Puja'17. You will definitely get a warm welcome from the staffs. They are very well behaved. Ambience is very good. 
Now coming to food. We ordered Aam Porar Shorbot, Kakori Kebab and Dum Gosht Biryani. Kebab was very good although I didn't like the Biryani at all. Overall it was a so-so experience.

Food is the finest thing here.
But service is a little issue here.  We went on Sunday,  the place was full.  Starters took some 35-40 minutes to come. Main course - dal and paneer were just excellent. 
However biryani took some good 15 minutes to come while we were waiting.
Also they forgot to offer us pan after the dinner. 

Overall,  may be a few more waiters should be appointed on sunday. 
Else all good

Quaint & Elegant - Bengali Cuisine - Ultra-delicious - Crafty dishes - Near Perfection - Soothing Ambience - Courteous Staff - Luxury dining - Must Must Visit !!!


You will drool over the dining experience at Sonargaon ... unarguably, the best Bengali cuisine served in Kolkata!!

Try the following:

Start with Aam Porar Shorbot - tangy and refreshing! Just the perfect start to build your appetite...üëÖ

Starters:
1. Machhli Gandharaj - boneless beckti fish üêü...baked and seasoned with aromatic lemon üçã... melts on your palate ...none/medium spicy 

2. Fish Fry - boneless beckti fish üê†, very well fried (no visible oil) - crisp, crunchy and ultra-delicious... savouring it with mustard and yogurt based saucy and you will not realize when to stopppppppppp...

3. Hara Matar Bhutte Palak Tawa Kabab - corn based, mashed with green peas & spinach ... quite different from the usual veg kababs ... mouth watering along with the coriander chutney!

4. Mochar Ghonto - the banana flower preparation - lovely!



Mains:
1. Dal Sonargaon - will make you taste the heavens in that moment, as you savour the dal Sonargaon with your chosen bread (recommended naan or kulcha)

2. Palak Dahi ka Kofta - don‚Äôt get intimidated with the size of the kofta... they really taste amazing and you can sense the aroma from a distance!

3. Luchi with Narkel diye Chholar Dal - Cannot miss this portion of the meal ... the luchi will hold tight till you break the air in it ...just perfect without any hint of oil ... savour it with the chholar dal ... must say, crafted to perfection by the Chef üë®‚Äçüç≥ 


Deserts:
1. Nolen Gur Ice Cream with Kalakand ‚Äî it is going to be an experience with this ice cream üç®... mouth watering and will want you to come back to his place again and again! Compliment with the Kalakand and you will love it to the heavens!

One of the oldest joints in kolkata for Indian food and you can‚Äôt go wrong with it. It never disappoints you though make sure you have a reservation beforehand.
We usually call for dahi ke seekh kebab and and bhatti ke badami aloo is an all time favorite.
The gilafi kulcha is a must have. Its super soft and fluffy and simply melts in your mouth. The black dal is another speciality. We also called for the paneer sonar gaon and subz nizami handi which were also good.
Whenever in doubt as to where to go for indian, head straight to sonar gaon! But yes, being a 5-star its a liitle steep on the pocket.

Indian cuisine on your mind then this is the place for you. For as long as I can remember this has been a restaurant that serves the best Dal Makhni ever. With an assortment of dishes on the menu and a well stocked bar Sonargaon gives you a wonderful and flavourful journey into Indian cuisine.

Tried the paneer and makai starters and the makai kofta and dal makhni with naans and tandoori roti for Main course. Absolutely outstanding is all that I can say. The Dal has remained truly awesome but the makai kofta just stole the thunder. A warning though would be appropriate as it‚Äôs very rich so advice would be to go slow.

Wonderful experience,

Cheers,

We were 22 people group who had visited on 15th Oct 2017 for dinner at Sonargaon. Let me try give my review:

AC: It was hot and humid inside the restaurant and despite our request the problem was not fixed

Seating arrangement: we sat on the ground floor wherein the waiters had to lean over guests to serve food which was a tad disappointing.

About food:

Tomato shorba: great taste@
Tandoori aloo: brilliant
Dal makhani: good
Paneer and mix sabzi was dissappointing and had a bland taste
Kulcha: hard and difficult to eat

Overall the experience was not what we expect from Taj Sonargaon

Overall I would consider the overall rating as average.

Went to this place on Saptami for Lunch to enjoy the special Puja Thali. There were two Thalis..One was Non Veg with Chicken and Mutton and the other one was with Chingri and Hilsa. Though I have been to this place a number of times but somehow i had never reviewed it, so at last i decided to give it a try. The quality of all the items were exquisite and so was the ambiance and decor. Pricing however was a bit more expensive than what one can expect on normal days. Two thalis pinched our pockets by almost 7500 bucks. However, overall it was a fantastic experience as it  always had been.

The North Indian specialty restaurant at Taj Bengal boasts of a rustic decor and a desi menu. 
The service and hospitality are remarkable, typical of a five star property. The food however, is what compels one to go back for more. 
Their refreshing tomato shorba is a particular favourite and the Dal Sonargaon, one of their signature dishes, is a must try. 
All in all, the restaurant offers one a luxurious dining experience.

Went there two days before. The decor is of an old village types and has pure 'bangaliyana' in it. The ambience is nice as well. We ordered Aam porar sharbat which tasted delicious. Next we ordered Dum Ghosht Biriyani and Murg Chicken. There were  soft,tender pieces of lamb in the biriyani with less amount of oil in it. And the chicken was juicy and soft and in every bite there was a bomb of flavours in my mouth. And lastly, the service was pretty good.

Does this place really need a review??
Well....since its an old favourite, would say something about it. The starters are awesome....the dahi kabab and the paneer tikka are a must try. The dal...kofta and whatever you order are amazing. The gilafi naan is unique and must be ordered. The service at times is slack at times....beer ordered was lying on the serving table for nearly 10 minutes before it finally arrived to mine. This was a let down otherwise everything else was spot on. It is a place every food lover should try.....remember it is not as expensive as one might imagine. Please try this place for sure.

Last time I had been to this iconic hotel in November 1995(a good two day stay)in an Ambassador Nova,though I still see them in Kolkotta,I missed certain things memories centred around...
Thanks Sanjib for company,Initially planned to go for a platter,I settled for Dal Sonargaon chochchori luchi and roti,Fresh lime and for desert Rasmalai(am not sure if they make it in house or get it from someone,forgot to ask) was very good.(I had Rasmalai sometime back in Taj Krishna,Hyderabad which had really disappointed me).
Service was excellent.Thanks for such a comfortable lunch experience.
Interiors are amazing,Experience it again and again,taking snaps for memory won't help,atleast to meeeeeee...
If I am here again I am pretty sure will have a very good time and a very good meal.

The typical ‚ÄúGhoti‚Äù bong I am by birth but I do cherish every bit of the Ilish¬†Maach. ¬†In fact, I always have been partial towards¬†Hilsa over Jumbo Prawn. Ilish can tempt me to change my routine even if served just the way I like it. Our lunch was more flavorful thanks to the blissful chat started with the Akher Rosh (sugarcane Juice). Starting from Hudson‚Äôs Ilish to the Ilish Macher Tel Jhol, the topics were diverse while we started the feast with ‚ÄúIlish Macher Tel‚Äú. I always cherish my one spoonful of rice with the Ilish Macher Tel (the remaining Oil after frying Hilsa!). Macher Tel was not something I was expecting Taj to serve, so comforting, so homely! Next item was nothing but the Ilisher Dim er Bora ( Hilsa Roe fritters), another typical bong delicacy.
                                                                ...

The ambience was like that of a Haveli. Ordered paneer tikka, aloo and broccoli for starters. The paneer was soft, the aloo had a nice tandoori scent and the broccoli was really amazing. For the main course we ordered dal makhani, paneer butter masala and corn masala along with cheese naan, roomali roti and butter naan. The dal was incredible like something I would expect in Delhi. The dal of this place won my heart. The paneer was a little sweet for my taste and the corn was good. The service was alright.

My first visit to the Taj Sonargaon. And yes as usual Taj welcomed us with its aura which marks its difference from the other Five star brands. The charm of a Taj Bengal is simply better than others. The hospitality of Taj makes it distinct from others. 
Now the food. For starters we ordered Bhatti ka murg and Gandharaj maach, both were amazing. We ordered Onion chilli kulcha, gilafi kulcha which was awesome. The Dal sonargaon was the perfect combination with it. Just melted in the mouth. And to end our main course we ordered Mutton Nalli sunheri which was so tender and tasty!! Felt like heaven. 
Awesome experience overall.

Taj Bengal's Sonar Gaon know for its authentic Indian dishes always leaves you wanting for more !!

Such delectable food with great decor, it's always an experience coming to Sonar Gaon.

I Had the Gulafi Kulcha along with Sonar Gaon Dal which literally melted in my mouth, the kulcha was super soft and the Dal was bursting with flavours not to be forgotten!

Along with this dish I had the famous Kakori Kebab, which is minced meat made into kebab form highly soft and very tasty. 

They offer a plethora of dishes. Make sure you try variety !

Among one of the 5 specialty restaurants in taj Bengal, as the name suggests this one is Indian. Set in an ambience of a village this is a good place to take ones family. 

I ordered chicken tikka, betki jhol and rice. Although it doesn't sound much, but my servers (vishnu and kabir) insisted me to order half portions of the dishes and believe me even that was alot!! 

Luckily for me the drinks and desserts were complimentary, I was given aam panna and date ice-cream both of which were quite Indian and different from the usual things we have at a restaurant. 

To end instead of Saunf or any mouth freshener I was given paan. 

All in all a good place to have good food, a bit expensive, but it's taj so the standards are what you pay for

Visited last weekend. The ambience was wonderful and the food the best I have tried in Kolkata... Ordered Chiekcn Malai tikka, Gandharaj Fish, Rava potato patties as starters with fresh mango juice. Each of them tasted wonderful. A special mention would be Rava poatato fries and the chicken. The chicken was absolutely ",elt in mouth". For main course it was assorted bread tokri, guchi pulao, dal makhni, paneer labadar and mutton roghan josh. The guchi pulao stands out and thats not a surprise given that guchi are the most expensive mushroom in the world!!! Morel as they are called, the texture was somewhat like soya chunks but the taste was out of the world, to say!

Went there for poila baishak (Bengali new year) buffet lunch . The decor is of an old village which was quite impressive for the whole look and feel of the place. Food was also very good . Service however was very slow. And not very well informed . 
They also charged some tax which in amount was equivalent to one while buffet price and when I asked about the charges they gave me a very uncertain and unclear reply and didn't bother to explain the whole 20% tax that they charged.

The taste of macchli gandharaj (it has bhetki fish) is still stuck in my mouth. It was one of the most amazing delicacies I ever tasted. Please try this at least once in your lifetime. And the restaurant ambience is also very nice.

The ambience is great. Themed as a village of Bengal. Exotic menu, little offbeat. We tried Aam panna Sherbet, rice, mutton and Gandharaj fish... The fish was amazing!! Friendly and warm service. The grandeur of Taj hotel is reflected in all the aspects... A typical dinner for two comes at a price of Rs. 4000 to 5000...so save the place for special dates.

Location ‚Äì Located on Ground floor of Taj Bangal Hotel in Alipore. 

Ambiance ‚Äì  The interiors here are spellbound. It portraits an Indian village. It also a small well (just for the show) which adds feathers to it. Amazing ambiance.

Service ‚Äì At a 5 star restaurant, service is bound to be good. It didn‚Äôt disappoint me either. They took booking over. Re-confirmed that we are coming or not few minutes before our scheduled timing. We were graciously welcomed on arrival and escorted to our table. The person taking our order suggested their signature dishes and we ordered accordingly. Staffs were courteous and polite, also the preparation time of our order was reasonable.

Food & Description ‚Äì Sonargoan was on my wishlist for a long time. It was an occasion of India vs England one day international cricket match next day, and I though its the right time to visit this place, as players would be staying in Taj, so could get to meet few of them plus dinner at one of the best Indian restaurant in Kolkata.  Food we ordered with description  :

Salad Platter ‚Äì Our dinner started with a complimentary salad platter which contained beetroot, cucumber, carrot, vinegar onion, lemon, chilli, papad & curd dip. It was good appetizers till the time our starters are served.

Bhatti ke Badami Aloo ‚Äì Aloo was well marinated and it was very tasty. 

Hara Matar Bhutte Palak Tawa Kabaab ‚Äì Though there were only 4 pieces in the serving, but its a worth a try. This round shaped tikki like kabaab melts in mouth and is extremely delicious. Highly recommended.

Paneer Makhanwala ‚Äì Paneer were soft. Gravy was average. Overall didn‚Äôt liked it that much, given the standards here.

Dal Sonargaon ‚Äì One of the best in the city. Excellent flavours. A must try here.

Gucchi Kumbh Mattar ‚Äì Another master class. Me a mushroom fan, and it was a treat for me.

Breads ‚Äì Tried roomali roti, onion chilli kulcha & masala kulcha. All were soft and good.

Parsi Kulfi ‚Äì It is flat round kulfi cut into two halves. Though I feel the presentation doesn‚Äôt justify that it is served at a 5 star restaurant, but the taste is out of the world. Highly recommended.

Pan ‚Äì Complimentary pan was served with the bill. There were different varieties of pan served on platter. A person can eat as per likings.

Overall the experience was amazing. Loved the food, loved the ambiance & loved the service. Will surely want to come again.

A 5 on 5. All my pictures are before and after the eating. Just shows how yummy and luring the food was! My entire family was not willing to wait for me to click the picture (not like I was any patient). The food, the flavors, the service  - all were exemplary.
We had the paneer Sonar Gaon - yum. Dahi ke kebabs - perfect taste. Tried 3 types of breads - yum.
My personal favorite was the nolen gur ice cream , which was just out of this world! And the palongshaasher chochori (don't think I spelt that right) a leafy vegetable mix of sorts - which exceeded our expectations by leaps and bounds.
To sum it up, if you're in this city, and even a bit of a foodie , go! Don't think twice.

Went for dinner on a special occasion. Skipped starters and went straight to the main course. Paneer makhanwala, dal sonargaon and butter naan. Paneer was excellent and very rich. Dal in the other hand was not up to the mark and a bit disappointing. The quantity was good for 3 people. Will visit again and try the non vegetarian dishes.

A classy premium 5 star restaurant-a meal at the Sonargaon is a luxury in itself
Needless to say...the place has a wonderful ambiance and courteous staff.
Food is delicious.The "sarson ke phool" starter is a must try!!!!
I visited this place on a family members birthday and we were pleasantly welcomed by an amazing cake from the Taj Bengal Bakery...Brownie points for this graciousnessüòä
One important observation that I must mention about is that while I was browsing through the menu of another restaurant in Taj Bengal "sarson ke phool" was priced at 850rs... while at Sonargaon the same dish was priced at 990rs!!!!I would surely like to know the reason for this major price discrepancy

Went for lunch to the grt restaurant. But was disappointed. The service was pathetic and we had to call the server for every small thing. Though the starter was good...main course was a big drawback. The chicken was not cleaned properly and less on salt too which cld nt bring flavour of the dish. Its a restaurant in a 5 star hotel but not upto the mark.

coming to the food:
Chicken kebabs: Tried a few. tastes great. specially murgh malai tikka. 
veg dahi kebab- good
lobster: Yummy.
paneer tikka: big size....tasty
pindi chana: classy
dal sonargaon- perfect
kosha mangsho-yummy
gilafi kulcha-nice n different
warggi paratha-good

overall everything has been good. nothing much to describe. They earlier served one ulta tawa ka paratha which unfortunately they have discontimued. that was out of the world. overall great experience but very expensive.

When one cooks or prepares the meal, the usual concern is to make the Food palatable so that when people eat it they are satiated & happy! Taste is the most important factor when it comes to food and thats how one co relates it to happiness and satisfaction.. It is no surprise that Taj hotels/ properties are amongst firsts and has always given their best when it comes to serving their guests! However i encountered the unexpected.. Leme tell at the outset that am reviewing Sonargaon- Taj Bengal, Kolkata solely on the taste, texture, smell and the presentation of the food.. Lets start the gupshup.
Prim and proper Ambience.. the floor can act as a mirror to the guests.. yes its that clean and sparkling! And i just loved the way the entire Sonargaon is done.. the well being the cynosure.. the seating is also very comfy! Holds true to the name the Golden village i.e. Sonargaon for you! 1.5 points is only for the ambience..
The Food tastes better specially when one is famished plus when one is kept waiting for some time..Here's the list on what was ordered:
Dahi ke seekh Kebab: So this dish is my favourite and methinks nothing can go wrong in the simplest dish like dahi kebab.. To my horror first we found it way too bland.. basic salt was missing.. then it wasnt roasted/fried properly.. the sides were tasting raw reason being it wasnt roasted properly! Yet we decided to dig in and go for it.. unfortunately we got hold of a strand of hair in the kebab.. Asked the staff to replace this dish.. that was the mood spoiler..
Replaced it with Bhatti ke Badami Aloo: Have u heard of that idiom 'Once bitten twice shy' 
It means an unpleasant experience induces caution.. cautious than prior and more vigilant in what was served to us.. Thankfully this dish was okay! Way better than dahi seekh kebab!
For the main course we ordered
Sonargaon Daal: this Daal was okayish!
Laal Aloo Mirch: So the menu reads as baby potatoes in a gravy and tossed with laal mirch.. we did get the baby potatoes and mirch but the gravy was gone for a toss.. twas more of a thick gravy glued to aloo! More like Lipatwa Aloo.. wish it had more gravy! The assorted bread that we ordered was Laccha Paratha and Pudina Laccha Paratha.. Pudina paratha was nice and crisp but we were waiting for like an eternity.. 
So when one pays a price for having at such a reputed five star restaurant, one expects the service and the food to be precise, delicate and ultra fine if u know what i mean! Yes i agree Sonargaon was running a full house the day we went for the luncheon but i guess thats the beauty of it serving fast n quick despite the crowd.. Five star is an luxurious affair thats the reason why creme de la creme would want special treatment and would flock to this place.. The service was not upto the mark! And twas highly disappointing to wait for the food which had dearth of flavours! Calcutta never ceases to amaze me when it comes to Food but sadly, it just swabbed off my pride! Thanks!

Sonargaon is a upscale village styled restaurant serving mouthwatering north indian dishes, however they do serve bengali cuisine like chingri bati chocchochori , aloo posto and all but those aren't upto the mark. We went there on my maa's birthday we had fish kebabs, mutton biriyani, prawns & parsi kulfi. The north indian dishes are delicious. Coming to the ambience Taj Group is one of the oldest & prestigious group in the world, it needs no description or introduction. Elegant decor, perfectly groomed staffs, those beautiful palm trees's in the lobby & the warm hospitality, one should visit this place to pamper your ownself or loved ones.

Ambience reflects the perfect theme of the Bengal village culture with a warm welcome and courteous service.

Chose Sonargaon for a birthday treat and it turned out to be a great choice indeed.¬† From the food to ambience to the service, everything was absolutely top notch. Located on the lobby level, the place tries to create a rustic, village setting complete with a mock well.¬† We went mostly with their signature items and almost everything¬† that we tried was awesome. Whether it was the melt in the mouth Kakori Kebab, the Amla Nalli Ghost with its perfect blend of spices or that rich, creamy, intensely flavourful Dal or the multilayer Warqi and Laccha parathas, all the dishes were truly worthy of a great Indian fine dining experience. The only thing slightly off was the Dum Ghost Biryiani. I found the mutton pieces a bit dry. 
Overall it was one truly memorable meal after which one is inclined to say Wah ! Taj !

Nothing I write here will change any outlook of the foodies. Amazing ambiance, delightful staff and a mouthful of taste- should I need to say any more? We had our company's product launch program here. We dined for 3 days, totally drooling over the fame. For a guy like me, it took a while to realize and absorb the fact that, yes I am inside the Taj- the Badshah among the hotel industry.

The low volume instrumentals playing in the background, the low intensity sepia lights, standing inside the big hall, sipping through the martini, picking off the delectable starter plates in the quaint Alipore corner is like reminiscing an old tale of Tagore's books. Everything we chewed, ate, drank, gulped, stared, smelled and saw was absolutely jimmy.

I would love to visit the place again and again. But yeah, we live in a real world unlike my fairy tale experience. It definitely costs more than what I can afford currently. Till that affordability meets my desire- au re¬∑voir Sonargaon. I shall miss you dearly.

Does Taj even need a review ? Or publicity? Perfect way to end up the day after a long day of work. The food is absolutely lip smacking! There are single person meals I opted for. It's a set menu for 1700 plus taxes. It's a good portion with rotis/ puris, lamb, dal, rice, Mishti doi.. The portion is also quite good but I don't think a single person can finish it. It's a must try!

Very nice ambience as expected. Has not changed much over the years. We shared some Naan with Kalonji Machhli Korma and decided to dig into Murg Biryani in 'Dum' style that tasted really nice. There was a Dakshini food festival going on but we again decided to stick to some north Indian flair as this restaurant is known for. I have to mention that our server, Sanjay had goofed up a bit while punching on the credit card with erroneous figure as he was busy talking to another guest, Though by small amount, I wish these issues are taken care of by the management and stewards are more careful while transacting.

Well,today I had gone for the south indian festival .I ordered the thali.I must say the dishes were tasty indeed but I felt the compilation of the various dishes were not upto my satisfaction.We had vendeka poriyal along with stew,mandi,one other thing,i forget the name of and pappu.All three things had a mix of the same vegetables ,potato,carrots and beans.I felt that there is so much of variety in the south,like a ripe mango curry or erisseri to replace one of them.The idiappam was outstanding,so was the mysore rasam.What disappointed me the most was the adda pradhaman,which was one of the two desserts.It is nothing like the real pradhaman which is¬† a paysam made from bits of hand made rice pasta.TAJ¬† should definitely look into its recipe.Only a true malayali would be able to see through this.I feel it's completely unfair to the general crowd who don't even know what a real adda pradhaman is.I tried to meet the chef but could not since he was busy.Hence this review.Mrs Ramani Menon [skmenon@yahoo.com]

Willing to shed a substantial amount of money to have the best luxury dining experience? Love North Indian cuisine? Want to gift your foodie partner a perfect date night? Sonargaon is the destination!!!

A village themed restaurant, which will make you fall in love with the ambiance at the 1st glance.

A perfect old Bengal Zamindari style decor, Candle Lit tables.....this place has it's own unique charm! - 5/5

Taj Hospitality is unbeatable. Flawless Service - 5/5

Food: 5/5.  Though the menu card offers certain Bengali dishes, I've mostly had the North Indian ones. 

Must try:

Aam Porar Shorbot, Kakori Kebab, Ajwaini Jhinga, Paneer Tikka, Dal Sonargaon, Gilafi Kulcha, Warqi Paratha, Dum Gosht Biryani/Murg Biryani, Kulfi Falooda.

Portion is sufficient for 2. Price is reasonable considering it's a 5* property. 

Totally Recommended!!!

LOCATION:

Located inside the Taj Bengal Hotel at lobby level. For those who have just moved to Kolkata or are just visiting the city, its the palatial hotel situated opposite the Alipore Zoo.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

I have already provided an overview of the hotel in an earlier review of their coffee shop. The interiors of this restaurant are as grand as the hotel itself. It takes you back to a typical indian village amidst a grand setting. The decor is faultless and you will find yourself smiling when you see the place for the first time.

WINE & DINE:

We called for Dal Sonargaon, Lahsuni Palak, Chicken Butter Masala and an assortment of breads.

All the dishes we ordered were good. The Dal was rich and creamy, the Spinach based side was once again creamy and the curry had a distinct taste of Garlic and the Butter Chicken too was well cooked, well seasoned and satisfying. I liked the Pudina Paratha a lot but found the Naan to be a little dry.¬†

Service was exemplary and the stewards were willing to go to any lengths to keep you happy.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The problem lay in the fact that all the dishes were "good". I did not find a stand out which at that price I sort of expected. I also think that premium ingredients should we allowed to sing their own tune in a dish. I liked the curries for all the dishes but found that the spinach was lost in the Lahsuni Palak behind a very rich gravy.

VERDICT:

Excellent ! The only word in my dictionary to describe this place. But this what was expected. After all this is TAJ. There is nothing that I will have to mention about food. Anything you order is as good as gold. But their chef's specials are extremely good. Cutting.5 only because of it's slow service. After all time is required to cook fresh and delicious food.

Southern Spice, Taj Coromandel‚Äôs famous¬†South Indian restaurant occupies a distinct place in the culinary map of India. If you are a fan of Southern Spice or if you want to get a taste of what this restaurant offers, head over to Taj Bengal where Chef Shanmugan from Southern Spice is showcasing food from the four states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The festival is on till 3rd July at the Sonargaon for Lunch and Dinner.

Willing to shed a substantial amount of money to have the best luxury dining experience? Love North Indian cuisine? Want to gift your foodie partner a perfect date night? Sonargaon is the destination!!!

A village themed restaurant, which will make you fall in love with the ambiance at the 1st glance.

A perfect old Bengal Zamindari style decor, Candle Lit tables.....this place has it's own unique charm! - 5/5

Taj Hospitality is unbeatable. Flawless Service - 5/5

Food: 5/5.  Though the menu card offers certain Bengali dishes, I've mostly had the North Indian ones. 

Must try:

Aam Porar Shorbot, Kakori Kebab, Ajwaini Jhinga, Paneer Tikka, Dal Sonargaon, Gilafi Kulcha, Warqi Paratha, Dum Gosht Biryani/Murg Biryani, Kulfi Falooda.

Portion is sufficient for 2. Price is reasonable considering it's a 5* property. 

Totally Recommended!!!

LOCATION:

Located inside the Taj Bengal Hotel at lobby level. For those who have just moved to Kolkata or are just visiting the city, its the palatial hotel situated opposite the Alipore Zoo.¬†

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

I have already provided an overview of the hotel in an earlier review of their coffee shop. The interiors of this restaurant are as grand as the hotel itself. It takes you back to a typical indian village amidst a grand setting. The decor is faultless and you will find yourself smiling when you see the place for the first time.

WINE & DINE:

We called for Dal Sonargaon, Lahsuni Palak, Chicken Butter Masala and an assortment of breads.

All the dishes we ordered were good. The Dal was rich and creamy, the Spinach based side was once again creamy and the curry had a distinct taste of Garlic and the Butter Chicken too was well cooked, well seasoned and satisfying. I liked the Pudina Paratha a lot but found the Naan to be a little dry.¬†

Service was exemplary and the stewards were willing to go to any lengths to keep you happy.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The problem lay in the fact that all the dishes were "good". I did not find a stand out which at that price I sort of expected. I also think that premium ingredients should we allowed to sing their own tune in a dish. I liked the curries for all the dishes but found that the spinach was lost in the Lahsuni Palak behind a very rich gravy.

VERDICT:

Its impossible not to like the restaurant and the hotel. It is a standing reminder of the great and royal legacy of Kolkata. The feeling you get while dining here is something you might hold dear for a while after!.

Very bad experience,poor service quality, shortage of staff, had to call 'excuse me' 15 times for anything, food quality degrading....food served was cold and below average, certainly not expected of Taj...........Checked in again today but as expected no improvement in service quality, no dearth of staff yet the wait is extraordinary long,I request avoid taking kids along or better option is order food online / over telephone to be served timely. There are far better 3-star restaurants in Kolkata I think that have efficient staff and cater the customers quite well.

I went there on 24/05/2016 with my family. The Taj brand is so big, that it almost makes you delightful when you reach there. The space in Sonargaon is a bit cramped up. But overall decoration is good. Now coming to the food...I was highly disappointed with its taste. We ordered fish fry whose fish was fresh & nice, but the coating was on the harder side. Next we took Chicken Makkhanwala which was good, though the Chicken was a bit rubbery. The next item was Mutton Kosha which was good. We also took plain rice & butter nun. The nun was poor as it was very crispy, butter nun should be soft & not brittle. The next item was Prawn Malaicurry. It was an absolute shock as the gravy was like watery textured & had absolutely no taste. We complained to the chef, but he could explain the reason as well. By Taj Bengal's standard & price, if was a total let down experience. Only the item that we thoroughly enjoyed was Noldn Gur Ice-Cream. It was an awesome preparation. But overall highly dissatisfied with the taste factor.

The setup ethnic but a bit cramped...whole lot of noise from around somehow took out the "fineness" from the dining environment....
The food was good...Biryani was really tasty..chicken items were praiseworthy.
..but for the "hulla gulla" it could have a 5 star experience!

Sonargoan is hands down my favourite north Indian restaurant in the city. The interiors, the comfort, the hospitality and the FOOD... Yes, food in caps.. It's that good. Gilafi kulcha and Dal makhani are my all time favourite. Cab have them even if i am dying. Not to miss out on the bhatte ke aalo and paneer tikka which can bowl you over. Also, the desserts are amazing and different than the regular restaurants. A must visit for every one !!

Dining at Taj to celebrate a special occasion is something that one looks forward with great expectation. This time, dropped at Sonargaon for such an occasion. Though the food -its taste, presentation and quality has remained impeccable like before ,the laidback attitude of the service men was quite a disappointment, so much so that they were required to be told more than twice to bring the menu card for the desserts and even bill. Was wondering what happened to the courteous and cordial service ,for which Taj restaurants were famous for ?And also the decor of Sonargaon, has remained same for more than quarter of a century. I presume, some change in the look may bring some vibrancy in the attitude and behaviour of the people giving service. As fine dining is about feeling good as well ,I think, there is scope for improvement in this regard.

The Buffet which was served was really good. However to some, the dishes might taste a bit bland but that has been purposely made in such a way so that the variety of customers including the international customers like it. The service was really good too. I Have hardly anything to complain about. However the food was served a bit cold.

This review of Sonargaon has been long pending, writing it a bit late. 
The food at Sonargaon is just Finger Licking!! I love the food at Sonargaon! 

We had ordered for Murg Dhania: Loved that dish, the gravy was so well cooked and the texture of the gravy was really smooth. Next was Dum Gosht Biryani: The biryani was just Yumm! The pieces in the biryani were meaty pieces unlike a few other places including "Five Stars", which charge you a bomb for the dish but don't give you good pieces of mutton to relish on! We had also ordered the Dal Sonargaon, which is like a must eat if you are visiting Sonargaon. It's the best Dal Makhani I have ever had, and I can say it's as good as Dal Bhukhara. 
Love the food at Sonargaon!

The beauty of luxurious dining is best felt here. Sonargaon has been my favourite since the time i have moved to kolkata. The seating area has a village theme and their top item is the Aloo laal mirch from the main course. Daal sonargaon is the kaali daal which is finger licking good. Their breads melt in the mouth and their kebab platter is just amazing. Well! Thats sonargaon for you guys. I dont think theres anything in the menu that dsnt taste awesome!! They top it up with 3 types of paan they offer as mouth freshner once you are done with your meal. Amazing place with suoer amazing food.

Been here several times, ever since Taj came up in Calcutta.

Dal Sonargaon (Kali dal), Warqi Partha, Ghost Biriyani, Dhania Murg are some of the best items. These dishes have stood the test of time. 

Parsee Kulfi is over rated & should be avoided. One could come here time and again and yet not get bored having the same food.

Sonargaon is one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata. I had been to this restaurant a couple of times.  The ambience of the restaurant is beautiful & classic one, the d√©cor is relevant to the village of Bengal. Although the seating could have been more comfortable for a fine dining experience! I visited this restaurant with my family. 

We started with Tomato Dhanyia Shorba & in the Starters we had ordered:
-	Bhatti Ke Badaami Aloo (Potato stuffed with bananas, chillies & prunes, flavoured with almonds, finished in a tandoor), 
-	Mirchi Pyaz Subz Seekh (A creamy vegetable kebab with subtle spices and white sesame crumbled with green chilli & choice of onion or bell peppers), 

Bhatti Ke Badaami Aloo was good & yummy. Mirchi Pyaz Subz Seekh was just OK, didn‚Äôt get the flavour as expected!

In the Main Course, we had ordered:¬†
-	Dal Sonargaon (Black Lentils simmered overnight in the classic "Dum" style & finished with butter & cream), 
-	Tawa Subazi Jhalfarezi (Exotic vegetables tossed with freshly ground spices), 
-	Panner Makhanwala (Cottage cheese cooked in tomato gravy finished with fenugreek seeds, dry fenugreek & cream),¬†
-	In the breads we had ordered Tandoori Roti, Butter Naan, Garlic Naan, Tandoori Kulcha (with a filling of masala),¬†
-	Subz Biryani (Seasonal vegetables & Basmati rice cooked in the "Dum" style, with flavours of saffron, mace & fresh mint leaves), 
- Fresh Lime Soda & Iced Tea beverages we had ordered along with the main course.

Dal Sonargaon, Tawa Subzi Jalfarezi, Garlic Naan & Tandoori Kulcha were very good & tasty. Although Paneer Makhanwala was just OK! Sybz Biryani was also good.

Somehow this time my overall experience was not good! We faced service issues like our glass was not filled with the water. Frequently, we had to ask the staff to fill the water! Secondly, few of our order was not served as the staff completely forgot about it, we had to remind them. Surprisingly, the restaurant was not full but still we faced such basic issues!

Cost wise, considering the overall taste & service, it‚Äôs on the higher side!

I am not a fan of Indian Cuisine but Sonargaon was different. It had the TAJ stamp & a unique menu which offered dishes not commonly found in the usual Indian Restaurants. 

So for a special dinner we decided that Sonargaon it is!

As we went in we noticed the lovely d√©cor, with some indian classical music playing in the background, a thumbs up for the ambience.

For the food we ordered Kesar Lassi, Tandoori Lobster, Gilafi Kulcha, Dhaniya chicken & Parsi Kulfi for dessert.

The lassi was yummy, the Tandoori Lobster looked tempting & was tasty, moist & very fresh. The hugey recommended ‚ÄúGilafi Kulcha‚Äù was really amazing soft tasty , in short , superb. But the Dhaniya Chicken was what blew my mind. I was expecting something green with the coriander flavor in to my face. But what was served was a buttery creamy gravy with soft succulent chicken pieces with a very subtle coriander flavor. 

We were also served raita , salad & papad with the dishes. 

For the dessert our Parsi Kulfi was good was well. & the meetha pan for the finishing touch was what sealed the deal!! 

The only issue which we faced was that although the lassi & dessert was served very fast but they really took a lot of time for the rest. Also they have less staff considering the foot fall which results in a long wait time for small things like spoons & fork. Apart from that a lovely experience.

I recommend it to all & would love to go again, many, many more times!

This is one place that was on my wish list for quite sometime and finally i fulfilled my wish on my wife's birthday ;) thereby making her happy and myself happier ;). Loved the ambiance but still think Taj can do much better in giving the restaurant a more authentic village look. The staff was brilliant and very well trained. They made sure to keep my 2 and half year old son busy in one way or the other so that we could enjoy our food. 

For starters we ordered Bhatti ke Badami Aloo. Let me confess that the first bite that i had made my heart sink thinking that my Rs.700 bucks have gone waste....but wait....after about 10 seconds i could feel how tasty the kebab actually was. Their Dal Sonargaon is a legendary stuff. The Dum ka paneer was fantastic. Special recommendation: Please please do try their Gilafi Kulcha its out of this world. The Subz Biryani was perfect will all the aromas and flavors. Cost for two will be Rs.3500 to Rs.4000 approx.

We visited this restaurant to celebrate my dad's b'day. Ambience - cool. Courtesy & service of the restaurant staffs - good. Food was really up to the mark. We ordered for Grilled Lobstar, Raan Sonargaon, Warqui Paratha, Mutton Kasha & our choice of ice cream. I am glad that not a single dish disappointed my expectations. I would like to recommend the Paratha as it was really awesome. Overall, a nice experience. :)

The quality and quantity of food is worth the price.

Birthdays are best celebrated at Taj. On a day when you are in no mood to experiment and be assured that you are going to have a good time. You want the best treatment and nothing does it better than Taj.
Sonargaon my family's all time favourite. Subtle flavours and fantastic presentation. From the salad platter to the papads and pickled onions with mint coriander chutney right from the onset your pallate is up for a treat.
We ordered three starters.. Bhatti ke badaami aloo which is a preparation of aloo stuffed with prunes and other condiments marinated and roasted. The makai sheekh kabab is their signature dish and the cheese and jalape√±o stuffed aloo in semolina crust was a bit bland and we realised that we chose almost all aloo based starters.

The main course was the all time favourite dal Sonargaon with paneer makhanwala. I don't think any other restaurant is capable of making such a melt in mouth kali dal. It is so rich yet so mild in flavours. The paneer makhanwala is a kasuri methi and cashew nut based gravy and our was a special no onion no garlic order yet it was just so delectable.
We ordered gilafi naan which again is a speciality which you won't get any where else. It is a sweet fermented naan with almost milk bread kind of texture in the middle.. Oh so yummy and the tulsi olive cheese naan could be eaten just by itself without a side too. The lacha paratha was regular and can be avoided. The onion chilli kulcha was good too.

Since it was our dad's Bday we got a complimentary cake which was a rich mocha mousse one and eggless too. Their paan platter is also one of its kind.

I wish our selection of starters was better. Otherwise whatever we ate we were super happy about.

The bill value was around 6000 for 5 of us as none of us had ordered any mock tail. I would rather dine at Taj than a upmarket restaurant which would be a pocket pinch of around 700 per person. The treatment the ambience and the gentry with good food is what makes a place worthy of a revisit... Hai na?

Was there in Taj Bengal as part of an office event, and based on the general feedback, Sonargoan seemed to be the best restaurant out there. The theme based decor is the first thing that strikes you, and is quite impressive. We tried the "Sindhi sea-food thaali", which was probably the special attraction for the week. Loved the food - especially the fried fish and the jumbo prawns! Service was top notch - just what you expect from a place as this.

Not sure when I would be able to re-visit this place, but if you're put up in Taj Bengal, this is one place you must dine at!

Visited Sonargaon with lot of expectations..must say felt good, their hospitality was good. Ordered gondhoraj bhetki and bhatte ki murg for starters..bhetki was wholesome but lacked gondhoraj flavour...was good though!....chicken was ordinary....what impressed most was their gilafi      naan....it was awesome!...and yes dal sonargaon complimented perfectly....we'd loved to try some more options other than their limited chicken options..that was a little disappointing!.....and yes just felt a little stuffy in there as it was really crowded inside...as if was sitting in a highway dhaba rather than a star rated place!.....but over all great experience...

I was there with ¬†a Group on lunch deal option.This North Indian restaurant is situated in the Taj Bengal hotel at Alipore. It is a tasteful replica of a rural house....complete with a courtyard, a well, dark wood on taupe stone, copper curios, and metal light fixtures. Popular dishes include Kakori (minced lamb) kebab, Patthar ka ghosht (mutton marinated with red chillies and Masala and cooked on a marble stove), and Chingri malai (prawns in coconut cream).

Souk is the only new restaurant to have come up at the Taj Bengal in the last 20 years.Else all the other restaurants are there from almost the time the hotel opened in the late eighties and Sonargaon is the front runner amongst them other than Chinnoiserrie and I must have visited it at least 100 times in the past and had many memorable occasions here including being here with my Mother who is no more.....

First the decor.....its unique and Indian.Earlier days they just had the staccato clay hand finished wall finish,typical of Bengal countryside,now embellished by a variety of lamps,lampshades and water,floral and lamp displays.It is two tiered and the feel is warm and earthy.

We had Lasooni Jhinga,Kakori kebab and Bhatti me Murg as starters with sugarcane juice for drinks.
The Kakori kebab was smooth,full flavoured and perfect.
The Lasooni Jhinga was huge,tasty but a little tough.
The Bhatti ke Murgh was just boneless tandoori chicken but it was excellent.
Definitely a 4.5/5 for starters but deducting 0.5 for the apology of sugarcane juice which was so diluted with water that it tasted more like sugarcane water than juice.

Mains were Sunheri Nalli which is another name for Mutton Nihari and Murg Makhanwala with butter naan,tandoori roti,roomali roti with onion and chilli.The mutton was perfect and the harshest critic in me cannot find any fault,be it the gravy,the meat,the cut,the flavour or the texture....5/5

I could not do justice to the Murg Makhanwala and hence would be unfair to comment on it.However we had Parsi kulfi for dessert and it was excellent as well.

Add the gentle but efficient service and no wonder that this place is around for decades and still going strong.

Prices are steep but that's kind of expected from a premier eatery at a Taj prime property,but I do have an issue with the portions.

I went for the Hilsa festival, and it was nothing short of glorious. Ilish cooked to perfection in differed styles! It starts off with a Ilisher bora and Fried Ilish, oil, rice and the world's most refreshing dal! Next came the ilish paturi (there were a couple of other options to choose from ), followed by tak Ilisher jhol. All's well that ends well, and there were three lovely sandesh, out of which the mango one was the best!

Let me say that I am rating this a full 5 / 5 stars therefore you can choose not to read any further and blindly take it's brilliance for granted but If you are reading this then, well.. amen.. and oh this review is only based on their North Indian dishes. The ambiance and decor is splendid giving it a very rural and earthy set up with a dash of opulence. I was their with my family. We ordered for a Sula Blush (Ros√©), Bhatti ke Badami Alu, Dal Sonargaon (this is a specialty and a must try!), Guchhi Kumbh Matar, Kareli Roganjosh with an assortment of Warqi Parantha, Gilafi Naan and Garlic Naan. We ended our feast with some Kulfi Falooda. Each and every dish tasted different and that in itself sets a class for this restaurant. The mutton (Roganjosh) was particularly tender, subtly spiced and cooked to perfection. Gilafi Naan had a nice subtle sweetness to it. The service is undoubtedly one of the best in class. Such level of commitment to perfection will not make you repent for all the cash you will be shelling out at the end of your meal. It's a must visit if you are looking for some great North Indian.. or.. to be more accurate, North West Frontier Cuisine in Kolkata.

Any number of times you go to Taj Bengal and at any of the restaurants of this property they are one top of the other never compromising on the quality and service. Simply marvelous and amazing.

We planned to visit Sonargaon with our friends and were amazing just by entering into it. It is made in the style n concept of the village and everything is just in the right place as they are in typical villages of india. Sonargaon serves both non-veg and vegetarian food.

We ordered Batata Tikki, Pan Paneer Tikka as starters and they were simply wonderful. Then for the main course we ordered Dal Sonargaon, Paneer Makhanwali, Tawa Sabji Jhalfrazi and all were simply mind-blowing. I specially liked the Dal. We ordered the regular breads and also the Olive cheese naan which we found a new one and wanted to try out and be assured we were not dissapointed and we were amazed as to how tasty a type of bread with fullings can be. Simply fantastic and a must try from my end.

Their service is top-notch and there are no negatives anywhere. A must try and highly recommended by me. Full marks for making us feel great and serving us with such great food.

Visited sonargaon during the marwar food festival. Ordered for machali sardar samand in starter followed by kabuli pulao and laal maans.The garlic chutney which accompanied the machali enchaced the flavour of the entire starter. Food was delicious, the lamb meat in laal maans preparation was too good it just melt in the mouth. The entire service personnel of sonargaon was highly hospitable and specially Mr. Subhodeep service was really commendable. Looking forward to visit again.

The hotel is one of the best I have ever visited. This restaurant is stunning just with its interior. The staff especially the waiters and cooks, offered me high quality food. The food was amazing and I felt great in the restaurant. This is a great place in Kolkata where you get treated like a king. A great show of how polite and solicitous Indian hosts are.

Easily the best north Indian cuisine restaurant in the city.

I had gone there with one of my colleagues for lunch. I ordered Pan Paneer Tikka to start with, which, needless to say, was spongy and thaws in your mouth. Also ordered the specialty Dal Sonargaon which was classic. They also offer a variety spread of breads, of which we ordered Laccha Paratha, Tandoori Kulcha, Butter Naan and Gilafi Kulcha. The Gilafi Kulcha proving true to its name vanishes in your mouth even before you now it. My friend had also ordered some non-veg dishes, which I being a complete veggie know nothing about.

For 3000 per person, I felt the spread was not exhaustive in terms of quantity but the quality of food was absolute top notch.

First of all -"the ambiance" being true to its theme it depicts a bit of semi modern 'gaon' (village) with a blend of class in it but the chairs are bit uncomfortable for tall people rest is all good.
Then "the service" - its as prompt as it gets and one can't complain.
Finally "the food" - portions are good enough for 4, do try their signature 'dal sonargaon', quality of breads are amazingly good and at the end of the meal you are sure to go home satisfied.

Overrated, over hyped! The first two words that come to my mind when i think of Sonar Gaon. But what the heck, the place still runs packed even on week days! Why??? Bewilders me...Maybe its the snob value. Anyways in spite of that been there twice lately. . So lets carry on with the review. The d√©cor is really nice complementing the name of the restaurant and has been the same since its inception if I am not wrong.

OUR ORDER: 

Starters-

-	Tomato Dhania Shorba: Its not there on the menu but they serve it on request. It was pretty good, the way shorba is meant to be. Thin,light and slightly tangy with the subtle flavor of fresh coriander garnishing.

-	Paneer tikka: The quality of paneer is excellent, the marination is sparse & Mild but still it tastes pretty good.

-	Chatpati rawa batata tikki-  Semolina(suji) coated kebabs with cheese n jalapenos. Decent to taste.

Main Course:

-	Guchhi kumbh matar: We were told that they were out of mushrooms, quite surprising to hear that at taj. But within a few mins the waiter came back saying the chef arranged for some from the hub. Wish he had not! It was quite disappointing. We had specifically asked to put more mushrooms & less of peas but the converse was done.

-	Aloo Lal Mirch: This has big kashmiri lal mirch in it along with baby potatoes. Pretty good.

-	Kaali Dal: This was  the best dish in the entire meal!

-	Breads: Garlic naan, onion green chillies kulcha ( must try), Roti & lachha Paratha.

Per Head Cost:  Total bill Amt- Rs7500. Rs1500 amongst the five of us. For an all veg meal without any alcohol. Considering that I being an inner circle member had a 20% discount coupon & roughly about Rs4300 Worth of points I just had to shell out Rs1700. Is it worth the money- Not at all.

Conclusion: 

The one thing that you are assured of while eating here is the food quality which is not compromised at all. But is it really a satiating meal? Does the food make you come back for more? Nope. I don‚Äôt think so. I would rather have two meals at Zaranj for the same amount of money I spend here.

Well its a little difficult to write about a restaurant where you have been going from your teenage years. You would tend to be biased. However I will try my best to be very objective and write down my feelings about this restaurant.
When you are going to a Taj property anywhere in the world you expect an absolute impeccable service. That's what I have got at Sonargaon at the Taj Bengal and that is not once but all of the times that I have dined there.
Out of all the times that I have been there. I am writing about a time that I have enjoyed the food the most.

From the time that we entered the restaurant we were shown our table and once we were ready to order the steward came to us to do the honours. Well Sonargaon is famous for its raan (leg of a kid lamb) and both my friend and me being meat lovers ordered that. Plus we ordered their famous Kaali Daal and lachha parathas. On top of that we asked the steward  for suggestions regarding kebabs. He said that we must have the kakori kebab and the tandoori jhinga. So we went along with it. Oh man! Weren't we in for a treat. After a couple of rounds of JD on the rocks, we were served our first kebab and that was the kakori kebab. Well what can I say....never had anything better than that. It was abs melt in the mouth....finely minced lamb with a little bit of fat mixed with it and a generous amount of saffron blended in the meat before it was placed on the grill. From the word go we had reached heaven. Then came the tandoori jhinga. At this point I must say that the way they served us was perfect...never hurried us nor were they too slow. Lot of time for my friend and me to chat. The medium sized prawns were perfectly marinated and impeccably grilled in the tandoori. All it needed was a little squeeze of lime to get the flavours all perfect. Now came the Piece De Resistance.....the Raan Sonargaon with kaali daal and lachhadaar parathas. The meat was falling of the bone....the marination was abs spot on and the meat was so tender. The daal was as always thick in consistency, had a lovely silky texture
 The parathas were hot, flackey and abs fresh. We stuffed ourselves like silly till we finished every morsel on our plate.
Bengalis have a spiritual connection with sweets. So for us the meal couldn't be completed without a malai kulfi each. The kulfi was also abs creamy and had a strong flavour of cardomon and pieces of almond.

After the meal we sat and waited for food to settle down inside us well and then we left the place all satisfied and relaxed. Not a single time did anyone from the restaurant hurried us or came to us with the bill. This is what a fine dining should be.

I have been here a couple of times but Sonargaon never ended up being one of my preferred places for Mughlai food. The taste of the food lacks authenticity - pretty much has a hotel management grad taste. The range of the kebabs itself is very limited. The kakori kebab is nice though. For the biryanis, I will still prefer Park Circus stuff. And for the rest of the Mughlai stuff, you are spoilt for choice in the muslim pockets of Calcutta. Sonargaon also has a Bengali selection in their menu. Those who are not from Bengal should try out this stuff, but being a Jomidar Bengali myself, I will prefer to have the stuff at home.

A must visit for authentic North Indian cuisine. We were three of us and together we shared a portion of Kakori kebab for starters and Murg Makhanwala with Naan for main course. For all the kakori kebab lovers, this is the right place for you guys...it was simply delicious and the Murgh Makhanwala was very well marinated and tender...ofcourse great in taste too...with the generous portions of the meal, we were unable to have the desserts...Overall a very satisfying experience...

Great food. Service was a bit slow but the food was fresh and delicious. Their Dal Sonargaon is awesome - just melts in your mouth. My view that 5 star hotels do not serve good Indian food changed a bit after having food here.

When ur in the mood for some Amazing North Indian food this is the place to be in!
My favourite in starter is the dahi ke seekh kebab! For the main course U can never miss out on the Dal sonargaon! Paneer pyaz sirka and pindi chana are always well made preparations! The bread I prefer most of the times is tamatar cheese naan!
Sonargaon is a place that keeps u happy with its amazing food and warm service always! :)

Love the food, nothing can beat it.
We have our special family dinners there, it's been more than 20 years now, it's been everyone's favourite. 
Food quality, need not say anything. It's taj, they always managed to live up to their name.

Was at the Sonargaon Taj Bengal yesterday with friends for dinner.  The reason for coming to this place is their food with its authentic taste.  Their signature dal is to die for and the gilaafi naan is so melt-in-your mouth. The major let down is their very slow service. And on this occasion what was shocking was their hesitation in giving the menu. We were given the food menu and we ordered for the starters. We asked them for the drinks menu to select our mocktails and were shocked to hear the steward say ma'm you need to wait for a while coz the menu is with the guests on the other table. We were made to wait for 15 minutes for the menu. I fail to understand that a restaurant in a 5star hotel must be having just one menu. In that case next time when we make table reservations we shall also ask them to reserve the menu for us. Though after the wait the mocktails we'd ordered were very impressive. The virgin mojito was different from what you get in other places. The chocolate sensation was absolutely yummm. In the end what left me completely disheartened was the fact that inspite of having asked for a refill of the glass of water not once but thrice , I came back home from The Taj Sonargaon my craving n hunger for deicious noth indian food completely satiated but my thirst for water remaining unquenched.

It's Valentine's Day and the restaurant is full , so what !! That doesn't give a restaurant in taj to demonstrate pathetic service !! Other than Malvika the staff was poor overall , especially this guy called Vishnu who we called three times to give us water and he brushed us away first ignoring us and then told us he's busy never to come back !!
Ordered a johnnie walker double black and got poured a single despite saying I wanted a double !!
And then after ordering for a fish and a prawns starter - 20 mins after serving the fish starter the guy comes and tells us do you want anything else !! And we ask him yeah we are waiting for the prawns !! And he says oh ya am sorry let me order it !!

I have been to this restaurant a few times over the last couple of years and i have to say it never disappoints. The Dal Makhani, the Palak Paneer are without a doubt good but the dish that stands out for me is the Naan. Hats off to the chef who makes the Naan, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside - each morsel just melts in ones mouth. this is one dish that i definitely will fly down specifically for!!

I ate at Sonargaon approximately three weeks ago, and the fact that all I can remember are the daal makhani (superb), a chicken entree (average) and a fish entree (below average) tells its own story. Great ambience and good service, surprisingly bustling for a week night, but in terms of the food, slightly above average. Top dollar should get you better...

The North-Indian food here is amazing !! 
Special mentions to the 'Gilafi Naan' and 'Aloo Mirch ka Salan' !! Loved the taste and the ethnicity of the dishes. But the service was substandard. I went there on a Weekday (Tuesday) but there were ONLY TWO people attending the tables and this was just unacceptable. The long delays in the serving of the dishes was what killed the experience which could've been fantastic !

Sonargaon and Taj both always live up to its name ,¬†
the perfectly done Indian decor - with the brass ;( in bengali "kashar" thala -bati )¬†
cutlery and the sweet little apron¬†
Ambience needless to say was wonderful , serene ¬†and some light hindustani ¬†classical tones in the background , very friendly staff .
Coming to the food - to start with the ever refreshing glass of chaas in the brass glass , and then the Kebabs and the Murgh tandoor - very soft with the correct amount of spices making it super juicy ,
Then as the main dish - customised a little in accordance to our tastes - the Butter Naan with The Buttery and Creamy Daal Makhani , the soft but huge panner tikkas and the not so spicy Chicken tikka masala curry .
And for all this to end up - a perfect ending ; "Kulfi with Falooda "¬†
Coming back as an often visitor :)

EAT HERE, you won't be disappointed, I promise. This is the classiest place I've eaten at for Indian food. The food here is SIMPLY INCREDIBLE, unquestionably the most authentic North Indian food, I'd wager.

Atmosphere: Well, it's alright I think. They've kinda tried hard to make this place look like you're sitting in a  Indian village somewhere up North but I didn't think it worked very well lol. 
There is a cool wooden stairway in the middle that leads nowhere!

Food:
Chaas: The awesome butter milk was served in a huuge glass and I thought it served two people! I'm not sure what went in the making but there definitely were secret ingredients (sweet basil??) that set it apart from all the average butter milk you get elsewhere.

Murg Malai Tikka: Soft, Tender, Juicy and cooked with the right amount of spices, very well balanced. 

Dahi Ke Sheek Kebab: Must try!

Dhania Murgh and Dal Makhni: Well I'm running out of words but, you really gotta taste it in order to experience it but I cannot tell you of another restaurant that gets close to it.

Service: Taj's Service - Outstanding as always.

We had a professional meet at the TAJ sonar gaon sometime recently. Our group consisted of 10 people, and hence there was a fair amount of spread.¬†

the interiors are not much to talk about, spacious enough...lighted well...but very bland. Like a tandoori chicken which looks that yum golden brown but when you bite into it, you miss the jhatka of the spices!

The food story was the same.. Everything was just okay. Nothing to write home about or bring loved ones in for a meal. For starters we had a aloo tikka, panner tikka and mutton and chicken kebabs. The mutton kebabs and the paneer tikka stood out.
The main course consisted of 2 types of Indian breads and polao.. And side dishes were fish, mutton and a mixed veggie concoction which I did not dislike.

Rounded off with gulab jamun and nolen gurer ice cream. (Yep..You read that last part right.) Unless you have a real sweet tooth, you wont enjoy the ice cream's flavour. I did not personally enjoy it but a lot of people at my table enjoyed it, so it'd be a matter of personal preferences.

We also partook of wines (red/white), and various mocktails. Very standard affaire.¬†

I do want to mention that the staff are very courteous and helpful and in my mind, more than make up for the bland servings food-wise.

Sonargaon located in Taj is a classic restaurant. Every staff there in is very hospitable and the food is served with lots of elegance and hospitality. The wait for the food absolutely makes it worthy of waiting after you get to taste the lovely mouthwatering dishes like Dal Sonargaon, Dum Biriyani, Ajwaini Jhinga (which is a decent one), paneer tikka. It absolutely makes u mesmerised either by its amazing interiors like mud walls etc or the amazing food. It enlightens my mood each time i visit there. So if u are a big bengali food fan and the love feel of elegance then u must pay a visit here soon!

My first review and perhaps the apt place to begin my journey as a foodie. As usual it was the wife and self who booked a table at the sonargaon. No waiting , professional greetings and we were led straight to the table. Being quite ravenous we went straight for the main course, where the number of non veg dishes seems to have reduced drastically. Upon asking for my old favourites: murgh khurchan, I was informed that they would do this dish for me. A big plus to start with. We also ordered the Dal Sonargaon , a ghosht biryani and a garlic naan. The Dal sonargaon is their answer to the Dal Bukhara at the Maurya (now replicated at other places too) and comes pretty close but did not do enough to replace it for me. The dal was smoky and flavourful with the right amount of creaminess but it lacked the zing of it's more famous competitor. The chicken consisted of juicy bite sized morsels of boneless chicken, with an ample dose of peppers. Again nice and tangy with the right amount of smokiness. The mutton biryani is a different biryani and it don't agree with some reviewers comparing this to the Shiraz biryanis. This is a dum biryani and the flavour is more subtle with the meat coming off the bone. Made my day totally. 

All in all, a wonderful experience and great value for money considering the service, the great food and the feel good factor. Kudos and keep it up !!

The best place to have Indian food- if you're not already in love with it! This is one place where I could go anytime in any mood! my favorites here are of course the Dal Sonargaon which is totally out of the world and beats every black dal on this planet to me! Next on the list is paneer Sonargaon, aloo jeera and tawa subzi jhalfarezi. All of them are completely appetising and make me water. The wait for the food is feels like ages considering my love for Sonargaon's food!  But the wait is worth it. The staff is hospitable and every little thing is delivered with class and hospitality. A total favourite of mine. A must go, so what if it's kinda pricy.

Just because they are the ‚ÄúTAJ‚Äù, it does not mean it has to be good.
It was my first time here with my family. We ordered, Kakori Kebab and Ajwaini Jhinga. Kakori Kebab was decent, and the Ajwaini Jhinga the only item I found really good, but still not worth 1600.
Then we ordered Dum Ghosht Biriyani and Kosha Mangsho for main course. I was so disappointed with the biriyani. I am paying  975+tax for 1 biriyani and if it tastes worse than a moderate Kolkata biriyani joint, I definitely will be upset. The side dish tasted equally boring and there was nothing in it except for the 5 star label. Yes it is Taj, but I must say, there are SEVERAL places, in Kolkata now, where the restaurants are amazing and absolutely hygienic with excellent service and 100% customer satisfaction, and they also don‚Äôt charge 1000+tax (on an average) for every single dish.

Cost for 2 in my case: 4500 (approx) TAXES EXTRA.

Have been here so many times now , it is difficult to write about all my experiences here. I was totally put off by the cuisine and slow service during the period from 2008 to 2010, but since the last few years, they have really improved on their food quality and level of service. Their veg platter is fantastic - and they also accept requests to replace the items. In Veg main course the Dal Sonargaon is a must as is the palak dahi kofta. The excellent ambience is a definite plus, along with the fact that they treat you with royalty most of the times.

During my last Kolkata visit, I stayed at Taj. This restaurant is located at the ground floor. For a single person there is veg combo meal. I had Bengali veg diner here. They make veg food quite tasty , sonamug daal , alur posto & luchhi . Restaurants have a very nice interior design.  In another evening in diner, I tried the non-veg thali as well. That was also very tasty. Staffs are very friend and willing to serve you best. As a whole this experience will make me come again here.

The food ordered was really bad and I was very disappointed. The food ordered was tasteless, it had little or no flavor in them. And the staff was definitely a huge let down, as they were serving food over the table instead of going to each person and serving them. It felt as if they were serving for the sake of it. The ambience however was the only good thing about the place..

Visited Sonargaon for old times sake. Its Tajs answer to ITC Peshawari--although its an earlier restaurant than the ITC Peshawari.
The ambience is inviting and a good attempt to make it "FRONTIER" in atmosphere. The service is good but with tables filling up while we were there slipped a bit--but then thats common in most 5 Star places.
The Chicken,and prawns {tanddori)were tasty although the latter tended a wee bit bland(more for European taste). The tandoori fish was good and tasty. The kali dal was not quite Dal Bukhara but a fair copy. !!Tofu and Chinese veg dish was quite tasty with the tofu being soft although slightly well fried1 The nan  first lot were a bit over done but the replacemenyts were soft,the methi paratha tasty.Kulfi should be better but then for that you have to go to the Jama Masjid area in Delhi. 
All in all a satisfying experience ,standard Taj.

SONARGAON as it sounds like a 5 star golden village. Today I went there with my frnd and a boss over a dinner- welcoming was good by a preety lady in the reception area followed by the start of a dissapointed services from the staff.. A complimentry item got served. Once it finished they just took that plate over and it was like they didn't even bother to refill it. Trust me after asking twice they refilled the complimentry item.. Next blunder by a 5 star named hotel staff is our used plates were just lying on the dinner after one round of dishes but no one bothered to pick that up untill or unless I had to call them to pick it up and asked them to serve water again. 
NO suggestion on the speciality dishes. Just asked once about the main course but it sounds totally formal as if they were in a rush or so...
IN A GIST -
FOOD QUALITY WAS PERFECT WITH A VERY BELOW ORDINARY CLASS SERVICE FROM THE STAFFS. 
NEVER EXPEXTED SUCH FROM SUCH RENOWED HOTEL IN THE CITY OF JOY.
WILL NEVER SUGGEST ANYONE.
TRUST ME ON THIS!!

It is difficult to review places tat one has grown up on and I remember sonargaon as a child, one of my first few memories of refined eating . The well in the restaurant, the mud walls feel, the lanterns , the brass plates, Sonargaon takes the theme seriously . The service is always pure perfection . 

I am not sure how much i will be able to critique this place but first thing i would like to say is that nobody I know can book a better lobster in an indian stayle . 

the ambi paneer tikka is superb ! the Dal Sonargaon is nothing short of perfection and the sucking on the nalli of the rogan josh is nothing but Elixir ! 

Love the corn kebaba , and the dahi ke kebab , and the aam pora sharbat is great . try the tulsi lassi... the salted version is really really soothing ,

Sonargaon is Epic ! Just plain simple EPIC !

The staff are very courteous , we had a prior reservation and the service was efficient and there is no complains on the service part. A pricy affair. Good to go with family. 

Overall , Sonargaon is one of the fine dinning restaurants in town and is worth a visit . I would rate it a 4.5.

You turn into a majesty as you enter the royal la-di-da, Very very rich, deluxe and elegant TAJ. In the mood of having north Indian cuisine, we chose sonargaon. The starters, one of which was veg kabab, was a direct concoction of taste, flavors and lots of love. We wanted a vegetable with no sour things and the chef had a talk with us and came up with an exotic vegetable and it was very international, yet true to its indian flavours with garlic and ginger flavor. Veg dum biryani stole my heart away. I was temptingly eating it slow for a long lasting experience. Price is something you don't check when you know you are in taj. Do visit and enjoy a heavenly experience! Thumbs up to this extraordinary place.

We had been to the Taj Sonargaon yesterday to celebrate a quiet dinner for our first anniversary with family. To begin with, the overall ambience is very warm and welcoming. We loved the Ajwaini Machchi and Chicken Malai Tikkas as starters. The other starter was the Chicken Soole Kebabs which was good. We did order Kakori Kebabs too but that was just about average and not that great as was expected. 

In the main course, the Dal Sonargaon is just lip smacking - one of the best Dals I have had in recent times. Add to it the Garlic Naan and you can polish off your plate with being content and happy to have come here. 

For desserts we ordered Nolen Gurer Ice Cream - it's made with Jaggery and reminds you of the delicious and fresh Sandesh which you can get at sweets shops ( one of the famous local sweet delicacies). The sweet dish was indeed the highlight of the dinner. It's a brilliant attempt by the restaurant to culminate the famous Mithai of Bengal and present it in an ice cream form which is simply innovative.

The overall experience was surreal for a dinner evening where one just forgets the world and savours the rich tastes of Indian cuisine and flavours. The price definitely is on the higher side but the complete experience lets you forget it after a while. Will I go there again - definitely a BIG YES. It's a very good experience to have Indian food with your family, relish it and create memories to last a long time.

When you're going to Taj, price is not a concern.. Superb ambience at this restaurant which resembles a porsche village.. The food is excellent.. Service was a bit slow in my experience.. Try out the Ulta Tawa Paratha and dal makhni.. Overall, a wonderful experience with my family.. :)

A restaurant in Taj Bengal will always be expensive but this one is really worth its money. The biryani is the best in town along with the one served in Dum Pukth, ITC The Soanr. The mutton pieces in the biryani are really tender and succulent and full of flavour. Also must try are the ulta tawa paratha, waqri parathi, daal sonargaon, tandoori lobster and the chilka lake prawns. Being a Bengali I have never wanted to try out the Bengali dishes as those are best enjoyed in the comfort's on one's home. I was fortunate to know a few of the managerial staff members personally which is why I managed to get myself served the Bailey's kulfi. The parsi kulfi is awesome as well but this bailey's kulfi is really a revelation and innovation. Overall a fantastic restaurant.

Sonargaon is an outstanding Indian restaurant at the gorgeous Taj Bengal. I have very fond memories of eating here when Dad worked at the Taj Bengal way back from 1991-94. It was a beautiful property then and it is beautiful even today.

Recently I enjoyed a meal here. All the food is delicious, be it the dahi ke kebabs, the lasooni palak or the paneer sonargaon. The naans were excellent too, crispy on the outside but with a soft interior. however, what really STOOD OUT was the black daal (daal sonargaon). I first had daal makhni at Sonargaon in 1991 and instantly fell in love. The daal this time too was absolutely finger-licking good and just dipping a nice crispy garlic naan in the daal is a bite of heaven. It is difficult to describe in words how happy this made me. My most sincere thanks to the entire team at Sonargaon.

The service as expected is wonderfully warm, this is a Taj after all. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and equally polite. When you pay 2k per head, its for the experience and not just singularly for the food. Somehow, the Taj understands this better than others and its totally worth eating here. This is a 10 star restaurant.

Can't wait to be back!

had dinner here on a saturday evening. Dismal service! Have to walk across and call the waiter to give our order !!! and the place was half empty at that . The food was variable - 2 bowls of biriyani ordered 1/2 hr apart were very good and very bad , in that order !! Was expecting so much more especially at a 5 star place with such expensive rates. Shall never visit again and am warning everybody to think twice before they go there.

Had been there last sunday...to begin with the experience was bad. The food is just normal, nothing out of the world nothing to be raved about. Service, was okay. We had ordered a mutton curry insisted that it be spicy, came bland but they took corrective measures and go it redone to our taste.
Shuruwaat was with amm panna or aam shorbot.. tasted more like jal jeera, dint really taste the aam.They have a vegetarian platter...just have four pieces of four different varieties, please do not order this if you have tasted these elsewhere as they don't taste any better here.May be the  lunch buffet at THE HUB will be a better choice, might not feel the pinch in the pocket so much, with the variety around.
Have had much better and tastier meals in ordinary restaurants.
Value for money ............ZERO!!!!

Taj, the name itself compliments the grandeur of the hotel. The Gilafi naan, began ka salaan and dal sonargaon are a treat to the mouth. 

A lot of people crib about the pricing, what they fail to understand is that you don't just pay for the food but you also pay for the services. I wonder if they would faint if they saw the rack rates of the rooms.

An entire meal in a normal restaurant might cost Rs. 1000/- Out here just a dish might cost that much, so make sure that you check the prices out first before you order.

What I also don't understand is that why people complain about some waiters not being able to converse in English. Anyways it's only in India that people make a fuss about others not conversing or not being able to converse in English.

Another this people do not realise that since Taj is a Five Star therefore, nannies, domestic help, maids aren't allowed yet people get them along with their kids/babies.

Have been going to this place since I was a kid, it never disappoints you. The staff try their level best to make sure that you are comfortable.

It is always advisable to make sure that a prior reservation is made to avoid delay in services.
Five Stars normally have some festival or other running in their restaurants, especially on location based festivals.

Dining at Sonargaon is always a PLEASURE :-D

The food is fabulous, the DAL SONARGAON is just PERFECT. As for the starters the non-veg platter is very good. A specialty naan that i have had only here is the Gilafi Naan, its extremely soft in texture n i have never had any thing like this else where, its a must try. Another good point is that at Sonargaon they are wiling to help u in every way possible, u can always call for the chef and ask him to make a certain main-course just the way you prefer and the chefs are more than happy to take your opinion and deliver just that. For desert try the Kulfi.

You will find the same smiling face, welcoming behavior and top notch attitude throughout the Taj brand. I have never been disappointed in this place.

The service is so good that they make every visit memorable and ensure you come back again.

EXCELLENT - MUST VISIT.

I visited there few months back. Its located in Taj Bengal.
I SIMPLY adore its ambience,,its just fabulous. The North Indian dishes are superb too. Staff is polite and service is really very good.
But when it comes to prices,,,its too high,,
FOOD- Murgh Malai Tikka is my fav.and you may like it.  
Kolkata Bhekti is expensive but its something on which spending money cannot be unnecessary,, its superbly delicious,,i liked it a lot. I had a vegeterian dish also(i have forgotten the name),,its good too. I would rate 4.5 for SONARGAON.

I love this place the ambiance and service are absolutely top class and I have never had a meal here that has disappointed me. The Dal Sonargaon is undoubtedly the best Kali Dal in Eastern india and frankly I would be more than happy to make a meal of just the Dal and a Naan that is how yummy it is. However their Non-Veg Kabab Platter is to die for and so is the Raan Sonargaon. Please make sure you are 4-5 people if you order both these items as they have substantial helpings. Finish off with the Parsi Kulfi which is super and this is the only place in town that you will find it ! Definitely one of my favorite places to visit for North Indian Cuisine

Sonargaon.. located in Taj Bengal, Alipore. the experience is awesome because of the decor, the ambiance and the way you are pampered at this place. the kebabs are mouth watering and indian breads are just delicious. the price - sky high but if you are planning to spend on good food - this is The Place. Courteous service and great taste. Vegetarians would have limited options but Dal Sonargaon is enough to make up lack of options. Have been going to this place since ages. Three and a half stars from me :)

We generally like to go to our Club for dinner and drinks. But this Saturday , I decided to go to Sonargaon at  the Taj Bengal. And I tell you I thanked me for my decision. The Food was delicious,the service EXCELLANT and the Price normal, just like any other  Good restaurant. AND if you see the size of the Serving , I think it will compete with Park Street Restaurants..

We had  Oh the tasty and refressing   Tulsi Jeera Lassi, as a starter. Then Dahi ke Kabab, Kabab Platter, Paneer Sonargaon, Tawa Subji, Palak Dahi Kabab, , Sonargaon"s speciality Dal ,Stuffed Kulcha,, Butter Nan. We were seven persons and my pocket pinch with Tips was eight thou. It was marvellous.  Jay Sureka

Although I visited this place long time back, I always wanted to write a review for this place. I had been there for a family dinner on the occasion of Durga Puja. The first disappointment was the parking lot where we were asked to park our car in some other place coz the place we chose was reserved (for whom we never got to know). Next thing is we enquired for an Indian restaurant and we were led to this place. They said they had only bengali buffet that night n we didnt want to go for it as we have dat at home everyday. Subsequently we were led to another restaurant and they told us we have to wait as they were full n they noted down our cell nos. We were given a call within 20 mins (don't know why they didnt have the courtesy to just come and call us in from the lounge) We went for a la carte. Obviously I have to mention dat the rates are exorbitant. Like 900 bucks for biryani is beyond the scope of my imagination. But still since its my Dad who's paying its fine :) We had a chicken starter, soup, naan, a main course chicken ( I dont remember which ), biryani. Surprisingly, the waiter at Taj Bengal didnt know how to converse in English. We had to finally give our instructions in Bengali. The food was average. I dont know what was their problem, the rush or the lack of good chefs. Seriously speaking my mom can cook better than this, a 100 times better. The desserts were complimentary because they made a thousand mistakes which we pointed out and I think finally they were in the courtesy mode. The bill was 4000 ! They had itemised the bill by putting in some other dishes. When we enquired they said they didnt have the input for dat particular dish and so they put in the name of some other dish but the price was same. What could we say? We paid the bill and left the place. I was so disappointed that hence forth whenever I think of a five-star dining exprience, it sends shivers down my spine. A big no-no to Taj Bengal !!!
