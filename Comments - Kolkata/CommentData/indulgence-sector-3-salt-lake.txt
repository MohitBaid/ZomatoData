The newest name in the bakery world in Kolkata. You've got to have it to believe it. Looks great and tastes even better. It surely is worth its name " INDULGE ".

Indulgence is worth its name every bit. Right from taste to decor of the cake. The cakes are fresh baked too. 
It is a start-up today but with its quality, it should soon be able to make its mark amongst leading bakeries in kolkata. Wish you all the best and may you always maintain the taste and service..
