Once ordered Aloo Paratha from here. It was nice and crispy with generous amount of Aloo inside, with the  perfect blend of masala and evenly spread. In fact, it tasted just like home made...

Ordered dal makhani, it was pathetic. Butter paneer was good, was although on the spicy side. Rotis were perfect. Not too satisfied by the price to quantity ratio.
