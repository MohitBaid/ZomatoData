The best thing of this place is the ambience and good staff .. and of course their finger licking food. Oudhi, Punjabi, Bengali they are best in every item.. I'm very satisfied. Portion of food according to price is up to the mark . A good place for dating or family outing or anything.

The GT route is located in the Shiraz hotel, Jameson inn. I noticed this joint many a times while passing through so naturally the curiosity got the better of me and I finally ended up here to satisfy it.
Ambience- very tasteful and chic. Ambience was spot on and the soft music was very soothing.no problems there.
Food- well the kebabs were very nice and tender. I liked the mix of spices used on them. The biryani was adequate but quantity was very low which has became quite a norm in biryani places of our fair city.
But the star for me was the firni. Thick and really amazing.
Service- excellent,the servers were very gracious and courteous enough.
Price- well a bit on the higher side but at par with most famous biryani joints of the city.
Overall I had a good experience and would say there are areas for improvement but I wd still recommend it. So thumbs up.

We went to this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The place was not crowded. It is a fine dining and sat on the ground floor which serves Indian Mughlai cuisine. The order was a flair of Chicken Biryani, Mutton Biryani,, Butter Naan, Murg Hazrat Mahal and Tomato Shorba. Every item was well cooked. Infact I wanted Dry Rice in my Biryani (Less oil) which they customized perfectly. The price is quite reasonable and quantity was not bad either. The Biryanis were served in Clay earthen pots which was slow cooked. The decor was interesting with a wall adorning the GT Road from Kolkata to Lucknow, perhaps depicting the culinary journey undertaken several centuries back. Lastly we realized they have a valet parking only after we parked it outside. They should write it prominently as the area is crowded otherwise.

One of the best till now. Great ambience and the service is really good. Ordered Chicken biryani, Mutton chaamp, Tandoori roti and Macher paturi. Taste was very good. Also the decor is amazing and it carries a mughlai feeling. 
Only one thing - its a little over priced, but barring this its great!

We have approached at Jameson Inn around 3:50pm on Monday, September 4th. I had heard about their (G.T. Route) Biriyani from one of my office colleagues. 

The steward informed me that their restaurant on Ground floor (G.T. Route) will be shut within 10 minutes, so we have to go on their restaurant (Dawat-E-Shiraz/Park Pavilion) on first floor. Ramesh Prasad the steward also clarified that, since the ground floor restaurant is going to close. They will provide the same menu on their 1st floor restaurant. Definitely, we have no cause to irate.

First of all, I want to appreciate the courtesy of Ramesh. He was really a gentleman with a smile. He volunteered to take our family picture. Ramesh also volunteered to choose food, he served food proficiently and most of all, he asked feedback of every dish right after our consumption. 

Now time for some discussion on their food:
1. Galouti Kebab: The kebab was marvellous. 4 kebabs on a dish, served each kebab on a 1/4th piece of ulta tawa paratha. My request, don't forget to taste it, whenever you reached at their place. 
My rating: 4.9 out of 5.

2. Gosht Biriyani: Served in a clay handi. Quantity was good, we had 1 special for my mom and me, 1 normal for Baba and 1 normal size for my driver. Quality was really decent, very light, you don't need any medicine after consume it if you have acidity. Mutton pieces was really soft and marvellous. Oh, yes you will get Aloo and 1 egg on the special one (Kolkata's emotion). Raita was really delicious.
My rating: 4.5 out of 5.

3. Gulab Jamun: Two pieces of HOT Gulab Jamun on each plate. What could be better than a HOT Gulab Jamun after such a Mughlai Delicacy??? 
My rating: 4.2 out of 5.

Oh Yes, In near future, I will visit them again.

Today i went GT ROUTE-JAMESSON INN,PARK STREET.Its in 56, Mullick Bazar.
The restaurant carries a nice mughlai fervour.The lights and the color set up is very much planned.Instrumental ghazals as the choice of music was appropriate.I liked the depiction of Grand Trunk Route along with milestones on the restaurant walls.
Thumbs up for the ambience.
This place is for pure Oudhi and Moghalian lovers.

Food:-
*Chicken Biryani-It was cooked in purely Mughalian style.Not too much spicy.If would have little bit spicy i think it could have been better.
*Mutton chap-okay okay types as it was in Afgan style.
*Raita-Superb
*Salad-good obvio
*Firni-Mind blowing.

The service is  good.Staffs are courteous and polite.
They also seek my honest opinion.

Overall It was a nice experience. Little bit over priced.They should try to improve food quality and quantity.

For better understanding i am uploading some pictures.

Everything good, the quality seems premium, its the quantity that I have grouse about. Too little for the price. Especially the Mutton kasaÂ which comes along with the chicken Biryani. Ambiance wise it is decent. The restaurant was absolutely empty Â given that it was the peak lunch hour. Seems that the place is frequented mostly by the Hotel patrons.

This place has a great ambience and the decor was good. Easy to locate, near mullickbazar crossing towards park circus seven points , opposite to shiraz. 
The staff were attentive.  Food was a bit over priced. 

We ordered Bulanee,  mutton makhmali and murg biriyani. 
Bulanee was worth trying,  the taste was awesome.  
Mutton makhmali was delicious,  the piece was really soft n melted in mouth. 
Murg Biriyani tasted good,  the potato was hard on one side but the chicken tasted good.

We went for a Sunday lunch in June with the family. Was relatively empty with 3 occupied tables. Though we had booked in advance through Zomato. Ordered Gilouti kabab for starters. Juicy and succulent, served with mini parathas. Melt in the mouth stuff. For mains we chose Mutton Biriyani, Paratha, Chicken Chaap. And Boorhani. The Biriyani was just right. Not to spicy, not too light and not greasy. They came in clay matkas. The chaap was ok. Nothing great. The boorhani was perfect. Service is good and so is the ambience. Not too costly for the experience. And valet parking too which is a big help in this area. Overall worth visiting.

Hungry for lunch we went hunting for a good place to eat near Park Street police station but it was a long hunt before we found the GT route 

we ordered the prawn in a coconut shell as well as the biryani and it took some time getting to the table but once it was on the table 

The biryani was little bit different from what you get everywhere but it was decent just single piece of mutton which was a bummer,  the real star of the show was the prawn in white sauce in a cooking share coconut shell which was very mild and with steam rice tasted good enough for both

The restaurant carries a nice mughlai fervour. The lights and the colour set up is very much planned. So Thumbs up to the ambience. 

The food quality is good, not as rich as a mughlai dish is expected. Biriyani can also be a bit more spicy. The quantity served up is also a bit on the lesser side, so it may seem to be a costly place. I went with a Little App coupon, but it seems that it might pinch your pocket. 

The service is good. The managers and waiters are courteous. And also seek your honest opinion, which is good. 

Overall it, was a nice experience. Though some slight changes inside the kitchen and right side of the menu card will surely increase the footfall.

If we consider the quantity of biriyani or size of kebabs then undoubtedly it is overpriced. But the atmosphere was fine and stuffs were cordial and helpful. Will advice the management to check the quantity of food with price if they want to increase the footfall.

Avail the dineout great Indian restaurant offer and booked a 3 course meal here. It is the old dawat-e-shiraz with a new name. The ambience and the location was perfect. Instrumental ghazals as the choice of music was appropriate. I liked the depiction of Grand Trunk route along with milestones on the restaurant walls. Now coming to the food. I had a kebab tartari platter, a normal dum ghost biriyani and kulfi for dessert. The kebab platter consisted of 4 different types of kebab, 2 pieces each. All of them were well cooked and bursting with spices. I specifically liked the soft smooth fish ones. Coming to the biriyani, the mutton was cooked to the bone and melts in your mouth. However, the biriyani is a little bit dry. It need to be a tad bit juicy. The kulfi was delicious. Overall quite an excellent place.

Visited this place for a lunch. The interior is pretty good and this place is for  pure oudhi and moghalian lovers. The food taste and quality not upto the mark. It's JUST OK and there starters are quite expensive where there is nothing special in it. The quantity is not good,they've charged biriyani large which is 350/- and they assure that it's totally enough for 2 people but it's actually not true. Less quantity,waste my money on there so called LARGE BIRIYANI and STARTERS. Please add more sorbet in ur menu and try to improve the sorbet quality which is already present in your menu.  
Otherwise place is good,nicely decorate,stuffs are helpful. 

GUYS, please improve your food quality as well as quantity otherwise no one'll want to pay for moderate food with less quantity.

I have been to Shiraz many a times however went to GT route today for the first time. The ambience of the outlet was average and the service too was not very good. One thing i liked is their Mahi tikka. I tried their lahori gosht and mutton stew as well but they were average to taste..In a nutshell i personly feel its a bit expensive to pay a price for the food one has to pay compared to the Shiraz outlet opposite to it.

Impressed. We had been to the erstwhile Shiraz for its famous biriyani while it was there but had not been to this new establishment. The fact that I could not take any pics of the dishes is testimony to the taste, service and experience. We started with galauti kebab and moorg reshmi with herbs. Chicken special biriyani, chicken bharta was the main course. Finished off with ice cream and nolen goor sweets. Caring and intelligent service. Loved it....

Was initially skeptical seeing the change of name. Then the manager explained they had increased the range from Mughlai to include North Indian, Bengali etc to widen the appeal. But, unlike other multi-cuisines they have not let the pristine Awadhi specialities be diluted. The Galauti, Mutton Stew and Biriyani can give any restaurant in Lucknow a run for its money. Still a classic. Not to be missed when in Calcutta.

Went to this place last month on my birthday. Interior was pretty good. Order murgh charbaagh which can also be called tandoori chicken, tastes ok like other good restaurants nothing extraordinary to be charged rs 275 for half chicken. Other restaurant charge around 320/330 for full tandoori. Special murgh biryani was just like golden Shiraz, no reason to eat here if I can get the same stuff just opposite. The ppl who take order are not very good communication wise results in extra charges on the bill. Was told that if order special chicken they can arrange for extra potato, which they did but didn't bother to inform about the charges. All in all same food as Shiraz just more pinch on the pocket.

This is regarded as the luxurious version of the famous Shiraz   hotel but I am sorry to say they are causing more harm than good to the brand. Last time I visited the fish had a foul smell and didn't tasted like bhetki. The chicken kebab was an average. Though the biriyani was good. Only reason to give a 3 rating was the courteous nature of the steward.

This place specializes in Mughlai and Oudhi cuisine and the name suggests. I ordered food from here day before.

I ordered :
Paneer Pasanda ( Oudhi)
Aloo Gobhi Tehri ( Oudhi) 

The food was delivered with the instruction that it would taste best if consumed within 1 hour.

The Aloo Gobhi Tehri was a yellow coloured long grained rice pulao with loads of fried cauliflower florets and small potatoes pieces with a predominant flavor of kasuri methi. 
The rice was good and well flavoured. But some how little subtle on the taste buds and the pieces of potato quite tasteless. The quantity was very good.

Paneer pasanda was rolls of creamy cottage cheese stuffed with a filling. The gravy was light yellow coloured and tasted predominantly sweet with strong Flavours of cashew and cream.

The food was good individually . But surely they did not make a good combination together. The person on the phone should have advised me on the same.

Missed out on celebratingÂ Motherâ€™s Day? Fret not becauseÂ you still have time to pamper the special lady. Take her to The GT Route at Jameson Inn Shiraz and enjoy the delicious Motherâ€™s Day special menu availableÂ till 14th May. I was invited by The GT Route for a preview of the menu and spent a lovely afternoon chatting with Chef Rupam, fellow blogger Poorna and the lovely Chilka. Chef explained thatÂ he has included within the menu some of The GT Route bestsellers and hasÂ tried to give a good mixÂ of vegetarian and non-vegetarian north Indian andÂ Bengali dishes. His favoritesÂ are Narkel Postor Bora, Murgh Hazrat Mahal, Dal Dum Niyazi, Lahori Gosht, Gosht Biryani and Kesar Pista Phirni.

Visited this spick-and-span comfy restaurant for a family lunch. We'd taken a combo meal consisting of biryani, salads, raita, mutton, chicken chaap and phirni, and also lachha paratha and masala kulcha. Sweet Lassi had occupied the appetiser course. Interiors, ambiance, staff hospitality everything is noteworthy, but what we experienced was the amount of helpings served, which was a bit small. The amount of food doesn't really add up to the price tags attached to the items. Over all, not a bad place for lunch or dinner.

Food was ok, ambience was ok. Service and billing process was horrendous. Though the restaurant was not crowded they kept messing up with the orders. 
One person takes the order, then after 10 mins another guy comes and asks if I have placed the order and then the first guy comes back and tells oh I forgot u ordered. This happened twice.
Even in billing I actually paid two bills one for the food another for the desert. Seriously get professional guys.

Special Handi biryani... Z the star dish.. Quantity z huge... N taste z not all compromised.. Peshawari decor with awadhi food.. Z mouth watering.. It even serves Chinese food on the 2nd floor of the restro..
One can choose between awadhi or moghal food or Chinese... But taste z just mouth watering...!!

Had to eat biryani at least once before I left town this time so headed to this restaurant. Loved, loved, loved the Paya. It is warm, comforting and full of flavour. The only sad part is that they don't pack it for take-aways - I really wanted to get some back home. The biryani was perfect. The mutton chaap was okay, not very impressive though. Do NOT miss the Paya.

I visited this resturant on my birthday and my experience was great.The ambience is good though it does not go with the theme exactly but it will give you a fine dining experience.The quantity and quality of the food is great. The mutton was well cooked specially the chapli kebab also the paneer was fresh and rich in taste.The service was upto the mark.The price is a bit on the higher side but its a place you can visit once a while for sure.

The place still had the newly opened smell when I and a friend stepped in. The decor is a minimalist modern approach. But the portrait of Sher Shah and the GT road map catches the eye; they could have highlighted the theme a little better. As we grabbed a window seat, overlooking the busy street, we were courteously greeted by the server! Full marks for the hospitality.
We ordered a mahi kebab which was moist, and melt in the mouth and leaving the pleasant flavour of spices. The aampanna was decent enough! For mains, we tried the Kabuli pilaf which was served in a handi. The rice was well cooked and the meat balls tender. The dish could have used a little more spice! As for the chicken biriyani, again the star was the moist meat. For us kolkatans, vouching by Arsalan, its finally time to try out a new place for our mughlai cravings. The dessert was a winner- the Awadhi Hoshn e aara; the sweetness just right, the light aroma of saffron and rose water in sync and again the softness of the bread! These guys are definitely doing wonders with their perfect succulence and moisture in each and every dish! :)

Great kebabs. Quality and quantity of food is good...kebabs are awesome. The galauti kebab and mutton kebab were outstanding.. These are a must try. Good ambience and service made it an overall satisfying experience.

The durga puja frenzy in Kolkata forced us to enter the posh looking GT Route bang opposite the well-known Shiraz. The concept impressed me. Just like the GT road that connects West Bengal to Kabul, GT Route serves food from areas on the route.

The place has a nice ambience. Its a nice place to go to with your family - if you dont want the authentic biryanis served across the city at places like Rahmania, Arsalan, Zeeshan and Shiraz.

Although belonging to Shiraz, the place had different chefs, understandably.

We were a group of five that included two biryani fanatics. So we had to order biryani. We also ordered chicken chaap, a typical curry item mostly found in Kolkata that usually complements the taste of biryani.

For the non-biryani lovers, we ordered garlic naan and Mutton shahi stew.

The biryani failed to impress us. Very bland and dry, the biryani lacked the intrinsic flavors that differentiate good biryani from ok biryani. Apparently they do not use dalda to cook their biryani, like other places in Kolkata. Maybe that made a lot of difference.

 The vessel in which the chaap was served was wrong. Traditionally, chaap is served in flat-bottomed vessels that makes it easier to take out the curry. Here, the longish vessel made it a little difficult for us to take out the curry. The presentation also failed to impress because the bowl had curry splattered all across it which almost made it look like it had been used before being served to us.

However, the mutton stew recommended by the hotel staff was good. The mutton was very soft and juicy and the gravy was delicious. However, i hope the place considers increasing its quantity.

That said, the service was good.

I wish we had tried out a few more dishes, particularly the dishes from Kabul. 

Not particularly easy on your pocket, the place will face tough competition from nearby places including Shiraz and Zeeshan that are much easy on your pocket and serve much more authentic food.

Nice concept, however more details should have been highlighted to showcase the idea. I noticed only one wall with a painting of the route. As for the menu, it comprises of mainly mughlai, tandoori,  awadhi & even bengali cuisine as these flavours will be found along the route. Tastewise, I'll rate them OK. As i was alone, i opted for Mutton Chaap with Tandoori roti. The mutton was well cooked. One suggestion would be to have preset meals for single individual as the outlet lies in a business district.

Awesome food..!! Tandoori and biriyani meat chunks could have been a bit fuller. Well maintained ambience. Staffs are real good at their services.

Located near to posh areas and close to #shiraz, some says the biriyani come from Shiraz only, gt route has one thing great, the posters and wall paintings. 
And only one thing good, the service. Food was below standard or you can say my taste buds have been upgraded recently because of having Hyderabad food for last few months.
Some north Indian dishes were decent and so I have given 3/5 out of great difficulty.

The GT route is situated inside the Jameson inn Shiraz hotel. The food was good. The ambience was also very good. I ordered the biryani which was very tasty. It is a good restaurant in Park Street, which serves excellent mughlai food.
