Relatively new to this place...since I stay near I'm a regular to these places and so comparing among the other establishments immediately near to this place I would say they serve much better food at the price they do...the cleanliness though can be questioned but the food is good for a large quantity at a mediocre price...I would be recommending it to people who pass through ballygunge station...

Had been seeing this shop in near Ballygunge station for a while. Waited for it to be added to ZOMATO and suggested it myself. And here it is.

This is non-ac outlet with 2-3 tables and can accommodate hardly 12 people. The behavior of tne staff here is average. 

Order: 
Chicken Biryani(7/10): This is just another decent local outlet for Biryani, chicken being served at Rs 100 and comes with an egg. The Biryani is a bit on the higher side in case of spiciness and a little extra oily. Try Ballygunge fast food for a lighter version at lesser price. Quantity is nice and 2 plates should be enough for 3. The chicken was very well cooked, was soft and tender. 
MIND YOU, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SIDE DISH FOR BIRYANI. So, had the Biryani without any sides.

Chilli Chicken(6.5/10): Had to order something for backup with rotis the next morning before leaving for college. Tasted one of the pieces and the gravy. The gravy was light in ingredients and oil but didn't taste bad. This is also a decent dish. The size of the chicken pieces were alright but I feel, for 4 pieces of that size and taste, should have been Rs 50 for 4 pcs instead of 60. But this judgement varies from person to person. The onions and capsicum were undercooked.

Mango Soda(7.5/10): This shop also serves juice/sodas. Rs 6 for small and 10 for bigger glass. While waiting for the chilli chicken to be ready, I took one to get rid of the thirst. This one was certainly a good choice. Not to sweet nor too dilute, just the right concentration. It has the fizz of the soda and they serve in the glass filled till the brim. The quantity is worth what you pay.
