I won't say that the food is nice but yes, if u want cheap food in an isolated locality like Topsia which is tasty and appetizing, then this will be the best place to visit or for take away.

Timely delivery.
Pocket friendly prices.
Good packaging.
Friendly staff.
The only problem is that they overcook all the veg dishes to the point that the taste of the vegetable is all gone.

2 times wrong and cheaper items got delivered at my office. Food is just OK, not good. Noodles taste burnt. Fried rice is awful. Not recommended at all.

They usually don't answer calls till 12:30 in the afternoon. And they're a home-delivery joint. The irony.
Once you do get to place the order, they take forever to deliver it to you.
About the taste, the parathas are bad. The chicken Bharta was good, very oily, but tasty nonetheless. Not recommended at all.

rated 1 star because they took the order right.
otherwise, chicken drumstick is a more of a fried besan charred dough.
pan fried is plain skin soaked in a spicy sauce. 
disappointing.

Food ordered on 10 a.m and ask to deliver by 1 p.m but now 1.40 but undelivered and manager switched of the phone.
After some time while called again they have responded that due to some problem we are unable to deliver in time by trying to deliver in some time.

Firstly, the Peolple who come to this place are mostly nearby office goers like me. This place is a blessing to us.
Secondly, the food. I would not call it exceptional but it can surely match upto or even cross your expectations.
Thirdly, the faces. Yeah, the ambience is goods. The staffs and mangers / owners are friendly and helpful. There are no seats but who cares when you are out for lunch with your colleagues.
Last but not the least. Two words - pocket friendly.

Quality food at very reasonable price. Hygienic ambience & friendly staffs. Loved their 'puri with dal curry' and must say they make best tea in this area..

If u love eating street foods then this place is the correct destination for u as it serves mouth watering hygienic foods...my personal favorite is cheese masala dosa and aloo paratha and it makes the best tea...
