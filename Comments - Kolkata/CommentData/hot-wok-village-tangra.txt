Had been here during Pujas. The place was very crowded however there was not much of waiting time. The menu was very limited as it was a Puja menu. Also service was very bad as the waiters looked too confused. To get a plate of fries it took them more than 40 mins approximately. The appetizers we're good .. we tried some chicken and fish starters. For main course we ordered  veg hakka noodles and chicken noodles. The food was very tasty. However the ambience was not.great and place was not quite hygienic too. Thanks restaurant really.needs to work on the same

I've been here quite a number of times and I have to say this that the food quality of hok wok has really gone down .... We had chicken drumsticks, fried rice and lemon chicken during puja and the food was so-so though the drumsticks tasted nice .... There are lots of things they need to work on especially the taste and quality of their food .... Ambience is satisfactory .... Car parking space is available

Old Chinese food. I felt like i entered some fish market. i saw a queue of 60 people standing in front of the main gate and we were told to wait but time was not mentioned to us. We finally entered after an hour into the dining area. We were given a seat & there were three of us. Finally, we ordered our drinks and dry chilly chicken along with mix fried rice and chowmein ,vanilla ice cream & sweet n sour chicken.
To be honest, i would say :

Food: 2.5/5 i.e in one word horrible
Ambience: 1.5/5 a fish market
service: 2.5/5

That's all, thank you

Its like we had dal fritters in the name of chiken pepper fry. They do not serve complimentery peanuts or bhujia with drinks. We had ask 6 to 7 times for one glass of juice which we ordered for the 2 year old kid with us. Such bogus people and set up.

went there yesterday. Complete waste of money. The cook was worst. we ordered mainly drinks and starters like Crispy chicken, Manchurion chicken kebab, Dry chilli chicken, Hot garlic chicken, Spicy hunan chicken, Chilli baby corn with button mushroom. Crispy chicken was very bad, I think the chicken was cooked one day ago. Manchurion chicken kebab was normal kebab, nothing special in it. Chilli chicken dry was a piece of shit. Please dont try chilli chicken here. Hot garlic chicken was so so. Only one dish, which is appriciatable was Spicy hunan chicken. It was really good. For that, we ordered it second time again. Lastly Chilli babycorn with button mushroom was so bad. We wanted to change the dish, but they refused to. No spices, only babycorn, mushroom and salt, thats it. Please dont go here for lunch or dinner. If you want to drink only, then you can try once.

If someone wants to taste the genuine authentic taste of Chinese foods, I shall advice it's Chinatown. The prices of foods at Hot Wok Village are perfect according to their quality and quantity and the ambience inside the restuarant is fantastic and more than that the restuarant have a parking lot in front of the entrance surrounded by walls to park vehicles safely.

Went here today for the first time.. was quite empty when we entered. We (3 people) ordered 3 beers(tuborg premium), crispy chicken, Kung pao chicken, a packet of chips and a chicken noodles. Total bill was 1400/-. However I felt that quantity was on the lower side because restaurants in China town are known for their huge quantity. The quantity was just like any other restaurants in any other places that you choose. Staffs were well behaved and courteous. Hope to visit some other place next time when I visit tangra restaurants.

This is the probably one of the cheapest restaurant in the entire Chinatown area. Food is average, ambience is moderate, huge parking space, spacious dining area and good behavior of waiter makes the place comfortable to enjoy quality time. The most interesting and the special part of this restaurant is its price of drinks and the quantity they offer. The prices are very cheap and you can order even 1 litre bottle and there is a separate dining place for smoking also. Overall its a fantastic place for college goers and alcohol maniacs with moderate food and plenty to drink. But if you want more quality Chinese food and a better classy ambience then I would suggest you to try some other restaurants in Chinatown :-)

Horrible food. They printed a different menu card for puja days with a doubled price.. 10 tiny pieces of tasteless pepper fried chicken (as the name suggests coz there was no hint of pepper) costs 400. Everything from fried rice to noodles to chilli chicken was tasteless. Hot garlic fish was too hot to eat. Everything was overpriced. Crowded and dull ambience.

Simply its hyped , not that great quality of food as well. Fish items just ok but threaded chicken & Fish what I heard after going through reviews it only offers the decoration but not taste. The idea is the fish or chicken piece is fried and threaded with noodles. Innovative but when you bite its hard and not crispy. Regarding service level they will keep you waiting beyond the promised time that even too on a week day. Overall there are better restaurants in the area and prudently it should not be your first choice for a fine dining.

Went there with a couple of friends to have a drink. It is located beside the Big Boss Restaurant in Tangra and is unmistakable to find. We were the first (and probably, only) guests that day. The ambience is a tad shady, with separate zones for smokers and non-smokers. The staff was courteous and suggestive.
We'd ordered Prawn Chips, Drum Sticks and dry Chilli Chicken along with beer. The quantity was good but the quality was okayish, seeing which we decided to ditch our plan of having lunch there. The bill amounted to around 1.7k for 4, which was okay as we'd ordered only starters and drinks.
Overall, I'd not go there again as I believe I'll find a lot of better places there. On the plus side, though, there is free parking!

China town goers are well aware of this place, for first timers, this place is just beside the famous big boss restaurant inside tangra. This place is not any extraordinary from other china town age old restaurants, same worn out interiors, chairs and tables (plus the disgusting washrooms). The entry decor is stacked up wit hay on a wooden structure to give somewhat look of a village.
Now coming to the main part, food is served in huge proportions at a cheap rate! And alcohol comes just as good as food!
If you have to visit this place don't look for any sort of ambiance or courteous service, just have enough patience to wait for your food which comes in bulk quantity.
Yesterday we ordered mixed fried rice(3), rice noodles, chili fish, honey chicken,drums of heaven, hot garlic chicken, along with couple of pegs of whiskey and the bill came about only 1800 for 6 of us!
Service was slow due to lack of expert and courteous staff, and each of them were reluctant to service but was very much eager to get the tips at the end of meal. Hence the rating is just for decent food at affordable rates. üëç

Of the many places in Tangra that I have visited because Big Boss was filled and there was a huge queue. 

Car parking is not at all an issue out here. The place is huge enough. But it has not been decorated well enough. It has a huge fish tank at the entrance. This place reminds you of China Town during the old times. But the place is very shabby. It seems to be a bit smoky, for which I thought, that this place serves hookah. It could have been well maintained.

Food was okayish. Portions were large enough. Mind you, the booze is extremely cheap. Staffs are a bit laid back. They seem to have no clue, when asked what would be the best dish out there.

I would visit again if I was in need of some cheap booze and to accompany some Chinese food as well. Pricing is on the pretty reasonable side.

I had an indomitable insatiable appetite to visit this place since the first time during my college days I visited china town for the very first time. Reason? It is the first signal, first indication that you are entering the famous tangra area from the bypass. We got the chance to drop in here this evening with few of my colleagues after a happening day at office. The place is located after Big boss, just on the road with huge parking area. There are 3 separate segments for family, smoking and non-smoking crowd which was very interesting to us. We got inside the smoking segment for obvious reason.
The waitor with not that heavy polite ultra courteous attitude came up and stood beside. We place order for a dry chilli chicken and black pepper fish with respective drinks. Surprisingly the cost of alcohol(if not beer) is tremendous less. A full 60ml of royal stag is 65 rupees, blenders pride is 114 rupees, old monk is 45 rupees - Can you believe it?? and that also without any vat applied, just a 5.8% of service tax.
Coming to the food, after the starters we ordered for 1 mixed schezwan fried rice and one kun pao chicken - the quantity and quality both were equally very good. I packed one mixed rice noodles for my wife and that was also very nice.
Everything under a single roof, with AC on, Euro cup on lcd tv, cigerette in your fingertips and glass in your hand with plateful of cheap yet tasty food - What else do u want in life???

Of the many places in Tangra that I have visited because Big Boss was filled and there was a huge queue. 

Car parking is not at all an issue out here. The place is huge enough. But it has not been decorated well enough. It has a huge fish tank at the entrance. This place reminds you of China Town during the old times. But the place is very shabby. It seems to be a bit smoky, for which I thought, that this place serves hookah. It could have been well maintained.

Food was okayish. Portions were large enough. Mind you, the booze is extremely cheap. Staffs are a bit laid back. They seem to have no clue, when asked what would be the best dish out there.

I would visit again if I was in need of some cheap booze and to accompany some Chinese food as well. Pricing is on the pretty reasonable side.

I had an indomitable insatiable appetite to visit this place since the first time during my college days I visited china town for the very first time. Reason? It is the first signal, first indication that you are entering the famous tangra area from the bypass. We got the chance to drop in here this evening with few of my colleagues after a happening day at office. The place is located after Big boss, just on the road with huge parking area. There are 3 separate segments for family, smoking and non-smoking crowd which was very interesting to us. We got inside the smoking segment for obvious reason.

It was a family dinner and we decided to try out this place. The total area of the restaurant is huge but the ambience is not good at all. Coming to the food, it was not satisfactory as well. For appetizer we ordered chicken tom yum soup, clear soup, crispy chilli babycorn and fried pepper chicken. The soup was okay-ish. The baby corn was good and the pepper chicken was good but not very tasty. It took a long time for the pepper to arrive so we were not satisfied by the service. For the main course we ordered mixed fried rice and meifoon, Manchurian chicken and spicy human chicken. The meifoon was too bad and tasteless. Fried rice was okay-ish. The chicken were satisfactory. Though the quantity was great. Over all not at all a good experience.

A very big place which has not been decorated or maintained the way it shud have been.

The food too is pretty low on quality and taste and it doesn't keep u interested for a long time.

You will get better chinese in some roadside eateries that have sprung up in the city.

I went there with my colleagues after office. The place is just beside the famous big boss restaurant in China town. We started with French fries and chilli potato and they were followed by mixed schezwan fried rice and hot garlic chicken. Startars were very nice. Especially the potato chilli item. I tried this for the first time and it was good. Fried rice and the chicken dish was fantastic. The typical china town flavour was there.
Alcohol is also served and served with bottles. The price was pretty reasonable.
The ambience of Hot Wok Village was good. All the tables were separated from others with big wooden panels.

It was a Saturday night and Golden Joy, being full, took pride in being super rude. So we, a bunch of five, went inside this place. 

We ordered Prawn Fried Rice, Chicken Steamed Momos, Fish in Black Bean Sauce, Honey Chicken, Crispy Fried Chicken, Burnt Garlic Fish and a few other things. 

The portion of rice was very big, almost enough for three people. The prawns were not overcooked and cleaned properly. All the dishes had the typical tangra taste, but only the momos, having a thick coating, weren't to my liking. 

However, it was a good meal. The service was reasonably good too.

Dont visit here if you want to eat. Yesterday around 9, all the renowned eateries were full, so choose this place to have Chinese. And that was such a disaster. Ordered schezwan mixed rice, chilli fish. Rice was prepared in a low grade rice gran. Fish was too small. We complained to the server about thw rice and his reply was 'we prepare them in this rice'. Completely disgraceful and filthy place to eat. This place is running only because of the low cost liquor and the bunch of school, college going people. Avoid and run as far as you can.

Parking is a problem and the place being filthy it's difficult to park the vehicle. Food is average and cost of drinks is relatively cheaper than other places. Not much pomp and show. You'll not find stylish wine glasses or expensive cutlery. Can accommodate many people at one time.

But that was only the beginning. The gravy chow was absolutely tasteless. Bland is also a taste but this one was flat, without any taste! Manchurian rice was somewhat ok. The rice noodles was horrible. It seemed people come here to drink and don't bother much about quality after a few pegs. Very sorry state of affairs. Will surely never go back.

This is one of the converted Tangra restaurants which was a tannery earlier and on moving out to Bantala the enterprising family turned this into a humungous restaurant.

One reason of my preference for this place is the ample parking,which is a rarity in Tangra.Also the prompt service and large seating area.

My Tangra vocabulary does not stretch beyond spicy soups,gravy noodles,Chilli chicken ( a must ),fried prawns,chicken fried rice and in case of large groups,fish chilli or schezwan chicken.From the advent of a fish called 'Basa' a tasteless blob of flesh,I have stopped ordering fish in any of the regular restaurants.Went for the same sequence here today and was shocked to see the deterioration in quality and taste.Food was at best,mediocre.I think they need to seriously consider some new chefs and while on it maybe inculcate some politeness in their staff as well.

Well sitting here and eating or drinking will make you feel in typical tangra culture. Tasty and quality food. They serve huge variety. But you will get a shock when you see the quantity. Yes you heard it right. There full plate has only 8 pcs, if you are ordering Chicken and 6 pcs if your are ordering Fish. You will get a bigger shock when you pay the bill. All the 6 & 8 pcs plates are priced at par with the full plate of ¬†the other eateries in Tanga.
Alcohol is cheaper but then food in very costly with not a very big differnce in taste.

One of the in budget restaurants in chinatown with a large parking lot and dimmy illusive interior. Seat capacity is also good. Pleasure for boozers, instead of taking large pegs you can buy a whole pint or 750 ml bottle. Thats saves your pocket also. Waiters I found coardial. Chicken items and mixed fried rice are tasty.

Parking space big advantage
Ambiance good. Separate sitting space for groups of boys and groups with family..
Service prompt and courteous
Food is a big plus now a days.. 
This is my 6th visit at hot oak village. With a group of 14 people the sitting arrangements were pretty good and adequate I must say.. they serve the liquor at the cheapest possible rates in whole china town.. in chicken must try is chicken drumsticks, the crispness is good.. and in fish cashewnuts fish and black garlic fish is awesome... u will like the taste..

Only thing I want this restaurant to improve is the lighting and the ac system in the family hall as in hot n humid during peak summer it may not be adequate for 35-40 ppl sitting together in the family hall.. 

Specially for any kinds of get together of more than 10 people i will give an Over all a big thumbs up for hot oak china town kolkata.. cheers :)

Wanna ¬†bet ??? .. let me elaborate . old monk ( college goer's favourite ) costs here rs 43 per 60 ml peg ........ ¬†yes i know that's insane ... ¬†& no I am not drunk as i ¬† write this ... you read it right .......... Rs freaking FORTY THREE per SIXTY ML PEG ¬†!! & that's not all ... there is something for the ladies too ... ¬†white mischief vodka @ Rs 48 / 60 ml peg ... ¬†who needs ¬†1 on 1 offers when you can alcohol at such cheap prices ?? ¬†Not me atleast .... & there's more , .. ¬†Royal Challenge ( whiskey) ¬†LARGE PEG ¬†is Rs ¬†66 / 60 ml Peg ... MAN ¬†!!! ... that's like Retail Cost Price !!!! .... If I buy NIB of Royal challenge.. it costs us rs 160 / NIB ... since a NIB has 3 pegs ( 180 ml )..... ¬†Cost of 1 peg ( 60 ml ) comes to 160/180 X 60 ¬†= ¬†Rs 54 ......& here i get it ¬†for around Rs 66 ...... NO JOKE !!!!! ¬† ¬†Now coming to my experience , I went there a few days back with a friend & was awestruck by it's large spacious arrangements ........ to be more precise the entire Bar-B-Q of park street would fit into hot wok ...... yes ... go see for yourself . it even has a large parking area ( free too ) . coming to our order ... we had ¬†TWO 60 ml pegs of old monk ( RS 43 X 2 = 86 ¬†) ONE 60 ml peg of white mischief ¬†( Rs 48 ) ¬†3 bottles of aerated cold drinks ( Rs 40 X 3 = 120 ) . in starters we had ¬† HALF PLATE ( 1/2) ¬†of golden fried prawns ¬†( Rs 350 ) ¬†& half plate of chilli garlic pepper fish ¬†( Rs 185 ) . Taste wise the prawn was good & it had 5 pieces , the fish was kinda ok , but it had only 4 pieces ( a bit pricey , when i am paying rs 185 ) . In the main course ¬†, we had 1 plate of prawn fried rice ( Rs ¬†145 ) & HALF PLATE ¬†( 1/2 ) of lemon chicken ¬†( Rs 135 ) . ¬†The bill when it came floored me totally ......... Rs 1257 including taxes ¬†( ¬†Rs 1069 + ¬†14.5 % ¬†VAT + 4.94% service tax ) . ¬† Not Bad eh ?? considering that ¬†we ¬†had 10 items . Yes 10 items ¬†. 2 starters + 2 main course + 3 LARGE pegs of alcohol + ¬†3 bottles of aerated drinks ¬†(2+ 2 +3 + 3 = 10 ). ¬†many people will complain that i haven't written anything about the ambiance ¬†, but my point is if i divulge everything , what will be left for you to ¬†explore ??? ¬†But ¬†i can say this much ........ ladies ( specially lady ¬†tippler gangs ) ... this place ¬†is safe & brimming with crowd , so you people can plan your ladies day out too here ( i ¬†myself found a crowd of JU ¬†all girl gang ¬†discussing their M.phil English entrance exam ) ¬†..... ¬†as for family people ¬†, DO NOT GO FOR FOOD ¬†Only ¬†, this place is more renowned locally for alcohol ....... hence make your ¬†choice discerningly .¬†

¬†SPECIAL ADVICE ¬†: please ¬†IGNORE the FOOD ( because Food here is average at best ) ¬†& concentrate on drinks ¬†... Hic hic !! cheers !!!

I wonder what led me to this place. Most  horrible experience ever..tried their very common chicken haka noodles and chicken manchurian.. the chicken cubes were smelling stale and their noodles seemed too dry and tasteless. Didn't expect this at least. Nothing to say about its decor, specially after tasting the food. Overall a tyranny for sure.

Ambience is not bad but the food quantity is too less and the food is not that good. If Tangra then why hot wok village ??? - this is what i think now !

Parking space is quite big and so is the seating area. Negatives are ambience and the apparently the crowd this place attracts but I might have visited on a wrong day. Good enough for a party with friends.

Have visited this place after 10 long years. This is one of the spacious restaurants and   with a large car parking area. There are separate sections for smokers and non smokers and it appeared to be a family restaurant. The food is good and  reasonably priced considering the excellent quantity that is offered. We tried fish and chicken items that were fresh and tasted nice. Oyster chicken and meifoon came out well. Over all. though does not qualify as fine dining, yet it has it's own charm. A relaxed unplanned evening well  spent with friends.

Hot Wok China Town Tangra is a place to chill out with friends rather than families. i have been there a few number of times. Its very very spacious and the best part is it has its own big parking space but you wont get a very good ambiance here.
They have quite a variety of dishes that the serve. Quality is above average but the quantity is good. They also serve liquor. It comes in all different ways starting from pegs to bottles of 360ml and 750 ml as well as 1 ltr bottles. So if you are atleast a group of five and you are there to drink then go for the bottles as it will come much cheaper than the pegs.
I have tried a lot of different dishes there starting from prawn to fried rice to all the fish preparations and most of the chicken dishes and they were not bad but were really expensive.

I had visited this place only a couple of times.....frankly speaking i m not too impressed with this place. The service was good and food was kind-a OK. The prices are not reasonable and ambience was not that good too, but i must say that they have a decent amount of space for parking. Bottomline is, you can give this place a miss if you have got seats in some other good restaurants in China Town.

One of the worst Chinese food experience. Environment pathetic. Behavior of the manager bad and rough. Bowls not even clean.

Coming to food and beverages: unnecessary costly. Pron papad 250 Rs plate. Chilly Chicken 420 a plate!!!... Not worthy of paying. 

BP a single peg (60ml) is 160 Rs. where a nip (180 ml) 960 Rs!!!!...

One of the worst in the china town.

No system to list your name on a waiting queue. We showed up and doorman says wait is 30 mins. We left and came back in 10 mins and kept waiting for 60 minutes, doorman let everyone in who showed up after us but we kept waiting. Every restaurant around was full with more than 1 hour wait, that is why we had to choose this one. He did have something to prove. We were behind 3 parties, but our number did not show up even after 5 more people.

well i am going to be dead honest here. the relationship between me and hot wok dates back to my kindergarten days, in those days there was a popular band with the name bombay vikings and my mother was a huge fan of it. luckily my dad worked at the airport as a customs officer and bombay vikings were to arrive here and when they did my dad introduced my mom to them and secretly and luckily my mom won a chance to have dinner with them at hot wok village. yeah the bombay vikings invited us to the restaurant and i was 5 at that time.
cutting the bullshit now, hot wok village is one of the unsung heroes of china town for unresolved reasons. it is a complete restaurant, for starters it is one of the very few restaurants in tangra with a large parking area, it has a kids zone which was more dear to me than the vikings people at that age. the ambience is ordinary but the food and the service are phenomenal. beyond an iota of doubt hot wok is one of the most competent chinese restaurants in kolkata. to this date it is my favourite restaurant in tangra second to only beijing. i strongly recommend that you give this place a visit! it has ac and non ac accomodation for around 60-80 people and thats a large number. so next time theres a long waiting list and you ate hungry visit this place.
