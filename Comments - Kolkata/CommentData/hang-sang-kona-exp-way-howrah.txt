A local restaurant that was famous for its bar but after the indian government regulation about bars and highways it has stopped serving alcohol as far as i know. I have been here several times with several friends. The food is standard and its cheap as well. The location is just beside national highway easy to be located by anyone. The staffs are great and extremely friendly.

Best thing about this place is they allows smoking inside. But service is not so good. It is kinda slow specially bill generation. Staffs are very good.

A little bit on the costlier side if one looks for quantity of food. Bar facilities r good. Located in kona expressway, Hang Sang can b reached easily. Staff behaviour is good. But nt at all a suitable place for quality_prioritized food!

HangSang is very close to my home and good bar in our area. But the food is something very tasty... But I had extreamly bad experience yesterday. I went for take away. The staff kept me waiting for 1 hr. Horrible... When I was asking for delay, they did not bother to answer me. After waiting for 1 hr I got my food. But the nightmare is yet to come. I went to my relative place for dinner. When I opened the box I saw they have given only 40% of chowmin.... Also I ordered for 1 plate fish finger. (8 pic). But when I opened it I got only 5 pieces... What a shame... I called their given number in provided Bill but no body respond. Zomato number did not work either. I was quite away from Hangsang so could not come at that moment..... Very annoying and frustrating... I'm a regular customer and they gave this hospitality... Feeling cheated.

Nice cozy bar cum restaurant with live performance occasionally.Good part is its a smoking bar but liquors they serve are mostly  domestic & you do not get as many choice as you would like to see in the beverage menu.Coming to the food i loved the hundi mutton they served.Very flavorful & aromatic with big red chillies immersed in the gravy.Mutton pieces were mostly on the bone but tender & not chewy. Navratan pulao was equally good with long grains of premium quality basmati & lot of dry fruits.The show stealler was the prawn butter masala. It was mind blowing in one word.I didn't expect such good quality food in a restaurant which is very lesser known.Would love to visit back. Bon apetit.
