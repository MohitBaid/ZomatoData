Had an amazing experience today at the Sand.They are starting their Poush Parbon Utsav menu from tomorrow and it will go on till the 14th of January. 

However I and the other food Bloggers who were present for the press release today requested an extension till the 15th. The taste would truly treat your palate with real taste of Bengal. 

I will give you a list of all the Pithe’s they are serving so that you can plan accordingly and hit this place asap.

•Patishapta
•Gokul Pithe
•Sheddho Puli
•Shoru Chakli 
•Chandrapuli 
•Bhapa Ashki 
•Nolan Gurer Payesh
•Chushi Kathi and many more.

I promise that it would remind of the Pithe’s that your grand Mom used to make.
Along with these they have some fusion ones too in their list, where they have paired it with different fruit jams and coulis like Kiwi, Mango, Blueberry and Strawberry.

Also the Bengali Buffet which is available at the Library is worth tasting. I simply fell in love with Shorshe Pabda and Mutton Curry.

After a long time I am rating 5 on 5 to any restaurant and they truly deserve it.

Keep up the good service. 

Happy Eating!!

Bad Food, Bad Service. Enough said! The two basic things you look for goes missing. I don't think anything else can make up for that. The food is not even close to what is claimed

A decent restaurant with light fixtures and flower decorations, Sand is the multicuisine restaurant of the 4 star Hotel De Sovrani, adjacent to Golden Tulip and diagonally opposite to The Sonnet, a few minutes away from City Centre 1. The glass window of the interior offers a nice view of the street below and also The Sonnet.
Dropped in here for a sudden dinner, on learning their Sky View Cafe was booked for some event and for regular visitors closed for the day. Sand too was hosting some event but a section of the restaurant was open to public for a la carte and buffet.
We tried the Murgh Dum Biryani and Lemon Coriander soup. The Chinese soup was okayish; biryani was good, infused with a lot of rose water.  The chicken in the biryani was not bad either. The raita however was not upto the mark and of poor taste and quality.
Hospitality of staff are noteworthy. Service is also more or less appreciable.
For standard dishes and moderatley good food De Sovrani is a preferable choice, but if one is looking for high quality taste mixed with serious awesomeness then that might not be availably guaranteed at Sand.

Good location, good decor, average food, good staff, tricky membership policy. Buy one get one offers tricky because food is already at over price. 
Nothing great ... a good Ok hotel near city Centre

Lovely ambiance , however service is a tad bit slow. 
The starters were good. The Indian kebabs were great but my favourite was the keyong chicken from the oriental menu.  The main course lacked. I had tried the Indian menu, the rogan josh was a big disappointment. The other items were satisfactory. 
The breads cane in hot and fast.

Visited the place on Valentine's Day 2k17 for a candlelight buffet lunch.So,want to apologize for the late review.For table reservation had called the restro & was informed that they had tied up with nearbuy on 14th,so had to purchase through nearbuy before visiting.Location:Sand is the in house restro of the'Hotel De Sovrani'.Close to Cc1 & next to the hotel Golden Tulip,so easy to locate.Ambiance:Needless to mention,being a star property,one can definitely expect the ambiance to be special & this place is not an exception.Interior is quite good with an open kitchen.As it was V-Day so  the theme of the place was related to 'LOVE'. Food:Well moving towards the most important part,the starters were served on the table,3 veg & 2 non veg.The non veg starters were perfect.Soft enough to melt in the mouth with a little bite force.The veg starters were okay.I notified them that i have become teetotaler,so they without hesitating gave me mocktail,i was quite impressed by their act of assistance.Next,was served with soup which was okayish.All the rest items were to be self taken.Now to my utter surprise,the menu in nearbuy was much different than that of the menu i found in the buffet which led me partial disappointed.There were many items in the menu some of them were pasta,noodles,chicken,mutton etc.To my utter surprise most of the items tasted average & there was nothing special to crave about including the desserts which wasn't at all yummy!Had expected much better.This further had spoiled my mood to a great extent.Hospitality:All the attendants were polite & attentive,they welcomed us warmly and till the end had the smile on their face.Conclusion:As it was a special day so had a lot of expectation from this restro,that it couldn't achieve.Needs much improvement taste wise & should also try to keep the menu as promised.Not going to visit again!!!!!!

Visited on 1st Oct. Extremely poor and inept service. You sit for ages before finding someone. And that someone you find might take your order and ignore. No management. Free for all.  Only saving grace was whatever was served was edible. But then cutlery and table top cleanliness again were compromised

Bengali Durga pujo is meant for pet pujo and nothing can be better than bengali cuisines for the food-lusty bengalis. Situated at the 1st floor of De Sovrani this place served some really delicious bengali food.

From hinger kachuri to aloo biriyani and begun bhaja to mutton kasha the taste of every item was essentially bengali. Also loved the veg items like dhoka and mocha very much. Loved the food and was impressed by the behaviour of the staffs.

Will definitely come back to this place again.😊

Its conveniently situated near to CC-1 on 1st floor of Hotel Sovrani.

The decor and its soothing/sophisticated/classy ambience are the key features of Sand.
The restaurant is spacious and has beautifully decorated indoors, well quilted seats with ample seating capacity.

They have a load of buffet option to go about. Most famous of them being Drunch is Drink + Breakfast + Lunch ;)

Went for a buffet and need to mention food was heavenly, beautiful blend of aroma and spices.
The Chicken and Fish items were a joy to eat with the right amount of spices cooked just so right, the pieces were so amazingly cooked absorbing the flavor of the spices and just so tender and juicy. 

The Dessert section had an assortment of Pastries, Ice Cream and Gulab Jamuns.

I have to acknowledge, the staff here, for they were the perfect ingredients to the making of the whole experience being very courteous and polite. 

Service was brisk , staffs were courteous and the food - scrumptious.

In nutshell, it was an admirable experience with the restaurant and the food (obviously). Recommended !!

Sunday a long awaited holiday for every workaholic people out there. We always want to spend the day by doing some interesting stuffs, but in real it’s not happen. What we do is nothing. Stay in bed for a long time and then come out from bed eat something and again go to sleep. But there are many others good option to spend the day, to make it more enjoyable, more fun and Drunch is one of them. Well what is Drunch Now!! Confused!! Well Drunch is Drink + Breakfast+ Lunch…

Actually it’s called Brunch. Brunch originated in England in the late 19th century and became popular in the United States in the 1930s. Now Sand a famous restaurant in Kolkata modify Brunch by adding drinks with it. And this is how Drunch Born.

Sand is in the first floor of De Sovrani Hotel near City Centre 1, Salt Lake, a beautifully decorated classy family restaurant.
 

So now… there is no limitation of enjoyment when you are coming to Sand, from 2nd July onward. Because every Sunday in sand will be the Drunch Sunday where, you can enjoy Unlimited Buffet with Unlimited drinks. Just grab your friends, family members and closed one and enjoy lavishly in Sand. 

I and my fellow foodie friends were invited there to cover their Drunch Menu Launch and spent some lovely moments there. The place is surrounded by clear glass window, little bit raining was going on outside and cosy wooden furniture made the atmosphere just perfect to enjoy drinks.

The menu is mixed of north Indian and Chinese mostly. In the starter we had,

Nababi Paneer Tikka Tandoori Chicken Stir Fried Butter Garlic Vegetable. Nababi Paneer tikka and Tandoori Chicken both preparation were just awesome. Nicely cooked, taste wise simply great.

In the main course they offered, Mangolian Veg Fried Rice, Jeera Peas Polao, Hyderabadi Murgh Dum Biryani, Dhaba Dal Makhana, Subz Miloni, Mushroom Tawa Masala, Schezwan Vegetable, Steamed Fish Ball in Mild Oyster Sauce, Shreded Chicken In Hot Bean Sauce, Chicken Cafreal, Mutton Xacuti Pickled Chilli Chicken. Honestly speaking as a hardcore non-veg lover I only tried the non-veg menu which wrer superbly delicious. Especially Hyderabadi Murgh Dum Biryani and Pickled Chili Chicken, these two item were the best as per my opinion. There were plenty more option for veg lovers also.

After having those delicious main course items we tried Desert. The desserts spread was also huge. Blueberry Cheese cake – Mix Fruit Mousse – Strawberry Swiss Roll – Basbousa – Gulab Jamun – Truffle tart – Mango Phirni – Jol Bhora Sandesh. Mango phini and Blue berry cheese cake were very good.

There are live counters where you can get different types of sandwich, pastas, and noodles. We tried a noodles preparation which was just mouth watering. Apart from these there also huge arrangements of different types of breakfast. But we did not get a chance to try those as we stuffed our belly with main course preparation. 

So, what are you waiting for!! Now when you know how to celebrate Sunday in a Dunch way make a visit on next Sunday. Yoy can have Drunch from 2nd July onwards on Every Sunday for Just rupees 899 /-only… Come with your friends and family and closed one and have the UNLIMITED fun with the UNLIMITED Drunch. Had a great lunch with team PanchPhoron.

Sand is a restaurant located at the 1st floor of De Sovrani hotel.

Location - DD 21, Sector 1, Salt Lake.

Ambience - Grand ambience with sophisticated interior decoration , mesmerising lighting , cosy seating arrangements of about 50 people,  which imparts a classy feel.

Staffs & Service - Staffs were well trained and very polite and service was prompt.

This time,  Sand , a classy restaurant in  Hotel DE SOVRANI host Brunch + Unlimited Drink = Drunch from 2nd July onwards on Every Sunday for Just rupees 899.

Brunch - A meal eaten later in the day than breakfast and earlier than lunch, replacing both meals, and often consisting of some foods that would normally be eaten at breakfast and some foods that would normally be eaten at lunch.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting session and it comprised of unlimited buffet and drinks ( both alcoholic & non alcoholic ) , from North Indian to Chinese to continental , Salads ,  buffet counter to live counter , one would get almost everything here. The list was huge.

I tried the following items - 

Nawabi  paneer Tikka – Paneer tikka is an Indian dish made from chunks of paneer marinated in spices and grilled in a tandoor. It is a vegetarian alternative to chicken tikka . It was very flavourful, soft and healthy.

Tandoori Chicken – Juicy, flavourful and very well prepared.Stir Fried Butter Garlic Vegetable - A tasty vegetable dish which was lipsmacking.

Mongolian Veg Fried Rice – A delicious fried rice dish with loads of veggies and flavour. 

Jeera Peas Polao –  A special rice preparation with jeera and peas. It was well made and aromatic.

Hyderabadi Murgh Dum Biryani –  It was very well cooked, flavourful with tender meat pieces. It goes very well with Raita.

Dhaba Dal Makhana – A thick & creamy Dal preparation and was very tasty.

Subz Miloni – A very healthy and tasty veg dish where  all the veggies that are added with spinach and cooked.

Mushroom Tawa Masala – lightly curried dish, the tawa mushroom uses strong Indian spices to whip up a rich and flavorsome gravy that enveloped sliced mushroom pieces. It was very yummy.

Schezwan Vegetable – A quick and saucy Indian Chinese dish with loads of vegetables in spicy saucy Schezwan base. It was yummy.

Steamed Fish Ball in Mild Oyster Sauce –   It was tasty and light and flavourful with soft fish pieces.

Shreded Chicken In Hot Bean Sauce – Soft chicken pieces with punch of flavours and zestiness of sauce.

Chicken Cafreal – Traditional, tangy Goan green fried chicken with awesome flavour .

Mutton Xacuti – A classic Goan dish that is  Fiery and loaded with flavour, it was  absolutely delicious!

Pickled Chili Chicken – It was the most awesome dish of the list. It was extremely tasty . A must try...!! 

Dessert : 

Blueberry Cheese cake
Mix Fruit Mousse 
Strawberry Swiss Roll 
Basbousa Truffle tart 
Gulab Jamun 
Sandesh 
Mango Phirni 
Chocolate Donnaught 


Review - All were delicious but the Blueberry Cheese cake, Strawberry Swiss Roll , Donnaught and Mango Phirni were the best.


 Live food counter- Momo , Dimsum , sandwich , mixed noodles,  pasta etc. One would have their  food made live by chef himself.

So what are you waiting for ?? Come here with your friends and family and enjoy the lavish & multifarious food ride.

Thanks to the management for their warm reception and hospitality.

Being a Sea lover SAND is my best friend. And it proved me right through it's food. I just loved it.
Along with my foodie friends I went there on the occasion of their BRUNCH menu launch. They have named it as DRUNCH where you can get unlimited Drink + Lunch at just Rs. 899/-.
                    

The word DRUNCH came from the word BRUNCH...it's the combination of Drink and Lunch...
So it's called DRUNCH...

North Indian to Chinese, to Continental...Buffet Counter to Live Counter you'll get everything here..Even in this menu you'll get unlimited drinks.

PICKLE CHICKEN is a must try..and please try all the desserts.

This menu is for weekend only.

What is Brunch ? . Brunch is a combination of breakfast and lunch eaten usually during the late morning to early afternoon, generally served from 11am up to 3pm. Brunch originated in England in the late 19th century and became popular in the United States in the 1930s. This time Sand a classy restaurant in  Hotel DE SOVRANI host Brunch + Unlimited Drink = Drunch from 2nd July onwards on Every Sunday for Just rupees 899.  This week, we hit at Sand located in De SOVRANI Hotel near City Center 1 at Saltlake Sector 1 to try out Drunch.  The place it was decorated very well as well as perfect ambiance.

Sand, a classy restaurant in De Sovrani is located near city centre, salt lake. The hotel looks clean, neat and soothing to the mind and eyes.
I went there for breakfast and was impressed with their service. They were courteous enough to change the plates on a regular basis, or asking if I was feeling comfortable. 
The variety of food was also impressive. Fresh fruits, variety of juices, chicken sausage, cheese omelette, chicken patty curry, mushroom, stuffed tomato, brown breads, bakeries and morning flakes etc were in the spread. The taste of chicken patty curry was very good but the taste of sausages was a bit strange. There were 8-9 types of continental and Indian desserts as well. 
Having all these for a price of 450/- INR  completely justifies the reason to deserve a 4 rating.

The place is the best way you can actually spoil your mood and waste your money. I had ordered the overpriced Murgh Dum  Biryani and it had my months portion of salt in it. If not anything else, get your salt quantity right. The worst part was when even after complaining they did not respond well to it. Never visiting this place again.

I was amazed with the excellent taste of the Dimsum.   Momos are always in the list of my favorite delicacies. Sand had just helped me to rediscover my childhood I used to spend at Gangtok - where there were no single day for me without momos..... 

Wonderful idea team DE SOVRANI. I just loved it. Only  to suggest the chef that the soup served with the Dimsum s could be little more sizzling - it was almost blunt. However the Dimsum s were too good that the soups taste didn't matter at all.......

Highly recommend guys... Enjoy your own Dimsum day.....

How could you not fall in love with a type of meal that literally means “light up the heart’? A whole array of dishes, mostly steamed, some deep-fried, others occasionally baked into the crispiest of feathery light dish, all with the sole purpose of igniting joy.

Dim Sum has a dedicated following anywhere Cantonese people roam and you’ll often see Dim Sum joints lining the streets of all the Chinatowns in the world. Hong Kong, is the king of dim sum production and consumption.

DE SOVRANI is hosting a dim sum festival to provide some relaxation to the Workaholics in the first week of March. Bringing the Chinatown flavour at Saltlake only.

Reserve your date for the first weekend i.e. 3rd to 5th March, 2017.

Are there other Dim Sum must-haves on your list? DE SOVRANI is more than happy to continue stuffing your faces with the aim of bringing you the Non-Definitive experience to Dim Sum.

Open for both lunch and dinner here you can try out vegetarian dim sums which will contain a range of fillings including organic Chinese cabbage with pak choy, fresh baby corn, mushroom, and many more. The non-vegetarian dim sums will include chicken, shrimp, pork n bacon, fish options.

The Dishes in detail :

Non Veg 

Smoked chicken sausage Dim Sum – Finely chopped smoked chicken sausage mixed with juicy spring chicken mince, flavoured with sesame oil,wrapped into a shape of dumpling and steamed very well. The key was great chicken sausage and its flavor. They are all smoked and fully cooked making them so easy to taste buds.
 
Szechuan chicken Dim Sum – 

 

Minced chicken blended with chopped celery,ginger and garlic.finished with chili garlic oil – wrapped into a shape of dumpling and steamed. You take a small bite off one end, suck in the juice, spoon in some hot sauce and then pop the whole portion into your mouth. It will go down like butter !!!

Five spiced fish Dim Sum –

Fish mince seasoned with five spices,after that wrapped into a dumpling shape and steamed. The perfect dim sum has a shell that’s delicate yet firm enough to hold in the juices.  One bite and the juice will squirt out if you’re not careful.

Mexican shrimp Dim Sum –

Minced shrimp mixed with chopped shallots,jalapeno,fresh red chilies & coriander stems.later on wrapped into dumpling shape and steamed it very well. With bright pink chunks of plump shrimp veiled in thin, stretchy, translucent dough and it was enough to keep the filling and juices trapped inside, to accomplished the goal.

Sticky Bacon & Pork Meat Dim Sum – 

Pork minced meat mixed with finely chopped sticky bacon along with chopped ginger garlic n flavoured with coriander – wrapped into a shape of dumpling n steamed. This gorgeous Dim Sum recipe is perfect. This great variation is a super star on dim sum tables.

Veg 

Veg Golden Garlic Dim Sum – 

Finely chopped carrot,cabbage and beans, flavoured with burnt garlic.wrapped and steamed it very well. Spring is wild garlic season: make the most of this wonderful foraging ingredient by adding it to the filling of Chinese steamed dumplings, it’s delicious.

Pak choy & Chinese cabbage Dim Sum –

Finely chopped Chinese cabbage and pak choy mixed with coriander,fresh chilies & chopped ginger.wrapped and steamed.These are beautiful and they are delicious as well! My mouth is watering!

Spicy mushroom Dim Sum –

Fresh mushroom mixed with chopped ginger,garlic & fresh chilies.dumplings are wrapped very well and steamed. These mushroom dumplings are bursting with savory flavour. Fresh mushrooms impart a rich, distinct flavour.

Water chestnut & cottage cheese Dim Sum –

Cottage cheese mixed with water chestnut, flavoured with chopped celery and garlic wrapped into a dumpling shape and steamed.

Fresh minced corn mixed with cheese,golden onion and crushed red chilies with a hint of butter-wrapped into a shape of dumpling and steamed it very well.

Sand - De Sovrani, situated next to CC1, this place is very well furnished. The ambience is good and great place to dine with family and friends. One should taste DAL E SOVRANI and SUBZ DUM BIRYANI. The staff were good but it can be improved as well as the presentation of food.
Overall a very good place with good food.👍😉

Not a good experience . Located beside city centre 1 . I m sure you will be disappointed after entering the hotel. The hotel needs to be maintained properly . Quality of the food is not so good. A great no for Chinese here. Bad choice .

How could you not fall in love with a type of meal that literally means “light up the heart’? A whole array of dishes, mostly steamed, some deep-fried, others occasionally baked into the crispiest of feathery light dish, all with the sole purpose of igniting joy.

Dim Sum has a dedicated following anywhere Cantonese people roam and you’ll often see Dim Sum joints lining the streets of all the Chinatowns in the world. Hong Kong, is the king of dim sum production and consumption.

DE SOVRANI is hosting a dim sum festival to provide some relaxation to the Workaholics in the first week of March. Bringing the Chinatown flavour at Saltlake only.

Reserve your date for the first weekend i.e. 3rd to 5th March, 2017.

Are there other Dim Sum must-haves on your list? DE SOVRANI is more than happy to continue stuffing your faces with the aim of bringing you the Non-Definitive experience to Dim Sum.

Open for both lunch and dinner here you can try out vegetarian dim sums which will contain a range of fillings including organic Chinese cabbage with pak choy, fresh baby corn, mushroom, and many more. The non-vegetarian dim sums will include chicken, shrimp, pork n bacon, fish options.

The Dishes in detail :

Non Veg 

Smoked chicken sausage Dim Sum – Finely chopped smoked chicken sausage mixed with juicy spring chicken mince, flavoured with sesame oil,wrapped into a shape of dumpling and steamed very well. The key was great chicken sausage and its flavor. They are all smoked and fully cooked making them so easy to taste buds.
 
Szechuan chicken Dim Sum – 

 

Minced chicken blended with chopped celery,ginger and garlic.finished with chili garlic oil – wrapped into a shape of dumpling and steamed. You take a small bite off one end, suck in the juice, spoon in some hot sauce and then pop the whole portion into your mouth. It will go down like butter !!!

Five spiced fish Dim Sum –

Fish mince seasoned with five spices,after that wrapped into a dumpling shape and steamed. The perfect dim sum has a shell that’s delicate yet firm enough to hold in the juices.  One bite and the juice will squirt out if you’re not careful.

Mexican shrimp Dim Sum –

Minced shrimp mixed with chopped shallots,jalapeno,fresh red chilies & coriander stems.later on wrapped into dumpling shape and steamed it very well. With bright pink chunks of plump shrimp veiled in thin, stretchy, translucent dough and it was enough to keep the filling and juices trapped inside, to accomplished the goal.

Sticky Bacon & Pork Meat Dim Sum – 

Pork minced meat mixed with finely chopped sticky bacon along with chopped ginger garlic n flavoured with coriander – wrapped into a shape of dumpling n steamed. This gorgeous Dim Sum recipe is perfect. This great variation is a super star on dim sum tables.

Veg 

Veg Golden Garlic Dim Sum – 

Finely chopped carrot,cabbage and beans, flavoured with burnt garlic.wrapped and steamed it very well. Spring is wild garlic season: make the most of this wonderful foraging ingredient by adding it to the filling of Chinese steamed dumplings, it’s delicious.

Pak choy & Chinese cabbage Dim Sum –

Finely chopped Chinese cabbage and pak choy mixed with coriander,fresh chilies & chopped ginger.wrapped and steamed.These are beautiful and they are delicious as well! My mouth is watering!

Spicy mushroom Dim Sum –

Fresh mushroom mixed with chopped ginger,garlic & fresh chilies.dumplings are wrapped very well and steamed. These mushroom dumplings are bursting with savory flavour. Fresh mushrooms impart a rich, distinct flavour.

Water chestnut & cottage cheese Dim Sum –

Cottage cheese mixed with water chestnut, flavoured with chopped celery and garlic wrapped into a dumpling shape and steamed.

Corn & cheese Dim Sum –

Fresh minced corn mixed with cheese,golden onion and crushed red chilies with a hint of butter-wrapped into a shape of dumpling and steamed it very well.

Yesss..this place will serve you some lip smacking dishes,starting of with continental dishes to Indian basically North Indian and refreshing drinks!
This place serves buffet though I didn't try.
One thing I would specifically mention is the service time which is not really impressive but the food quality of this place would fetch it a 8 on 10.
Thank you

Visited on valentines day with family...lovely ambience and nice decor...had a lot of expectations but had a really bad experience...first of all food menu was not as promised on nearbuy...coming to the starters, mutton galauti kabab and chicken sheek kabab was good but fish kabab was not cooked properly and was stinking...complimentary mocktail was not up to the mark...there is nothing much to speak about the main course or desserts as it was below average...will not suggest anyone to even give it a try...waste of money...

Sand.... this salt lake based Hotel De Sovrani has its own continental north indian chinese and indian resraurant. Recently visited on 30th december. The spread was very delicious. Staffs were decent. Starters are limited in number. Just one veg and one non veg. However dessert spread is good in number and in taste including nolen items.. tart pastries etc. Main course options are less and could have been better. However side dishes are decently tasty. Overall a good experience. Last but not the least we ordered for sweet lime soda which they served as complimentary. There is buy 1 get 1 buffet ongoing offer only for members. For further details please contact the hotel.

Overpriced and overrated.
I went there with my parents only once, after hearing about this place from one of my peers.
We ordered Galauti Kebab and Raan-e-Murgh for the appetizers, which surprisingly was served 35 minutes after our order placement.
The kebabs were okayish, the meat wasn't tender and juicy, and it was difficult for us to differentiate between the two dishes.
The quantity wasn't satisfactory either.

For the main course, Butter Naan, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Dal Makhani and Peas Pulao was ordered by us. 
After testing our patience for several unknown units of time, the food finally arrived at our table, much to our annoyance and discomfort.
Although the entrée was properly cooked, the amount of Dal Makhani and Butter Chicken was significantly less, as compared to other premium restaurants and eventually we had to call for two more plates, in order to fill our stomachs. 
Nevertheless, it wasn't a disastrous dining experience for us.
However, the number of culinary flaws did outnumber its gastronomical quintessence.

This is one of the restaurant of the Hotel De Sovrani which remain open 24 hrs. Though majority of the items are not available at late at nights. I like the American breakfast with fruits, eggs, chicken sausages and bacon and toasts, coffee and cereals. It's a huge meal to start the day with and available till 10:30 pm. I also liked the Penne A la Arrabiata. The decor is snothhing.

● Watermelon juice»»» Served in normal temperature... is was not at all expected...

● Fruit salad»»» normal assorted fruits cut in pieces... nothing special...

● Bulls eye chicken burger»»» Pathetic... the buns are not fresh... the patty was huge with no taste in it...

Overall a very bad experience... they scored only for their ambience and deco that's all...

Pocket pinch was very high in respect to their standards...

If quality food has been your ultimate search to celebrate this Durga Puja, then head over to be a part of ‘Nana Swade Sharodiya’, a unique gastronomical venture by De Sovrani at their Multicuisine Restaurant Sand. The celebration will feature staples and much liked dishes from most states across India.

Tired of trying out the same old Bengali-only puja special menu? Want to try something new?
Then Sand, the in house restaurant of Hotel De Sovrani should be your destination this festive week. Embark on a pan Indian gastronomical journey with traditional dishes curated from Goan, Maharashtrian, Kashmiri, South Indian cuisines which will be available as a buffet spread here during the puja week apart from the traditional Bengali delicacies, not to mention variety of welcome drinks, salads, starters & desserts to choose from. In fact Sands has also incorporated some cocktails with a Bengali touch to it. I tasted a few of them, & surely the tender coconut one tasted great. As far as the food is concerned I tried their Yakhni Pulao & Chicken Cafreal, & I have to say they were....

It is in Salt lake, close to city centre but this place remained unnoticed until we decided to venture this place. We came across an attractive deal in little. It was a Buffet service. The service was good, the food was really good. The chef gave equal justice to both veg and non-veg dishes.

As the saying goes, 'All's well that ends well'; it was the dessert which took over the table. The list was impressive and tempted my taste-buds. A variety of Bengali sweets and Panna Cota, which was well made.

I would encourage food lovers to go there and try the food. I am sure you would like their food, like I do.

The monsoons have arrived and its raining hilsa. Bengalis and hilsa have a strong bond from time immemorial, and how enticing it is, if the delicacies retain their authentic tone of preparation? Sand at De Sovrani has exactly given up on experimental infusions with Hilsa, rather they want to stick to the simplistic Bangladeshi forms of delicacies of Hilsa specially crafted by the master chefs.

Location : Sand is located on the first floor of De Sovrani. This is just beside Sonnet behind City Centre Saltlake.

Decor and Ambience: As grand as could be. The finely crafted mirrors , the delicate well- etched chandelier , the wooden furniture starks a contrast to a monotone contrast and speak volumes about the grandeur of the place.

Was invited for the Hilsa festival "Dhakar swaadey ilish paatey" and was astounded by the menu spread. The richness of Ilish and the bong connection will be recreated. This festival commences from the 5th August. The best part being the dishes are served with accompaniments.

The menu includes :

1. Ilish er kofta curry - fried kofta of deboned hilsa fish in a rich tomato onion gravy.

2. Ilish er korma - ilish cooked in a gravy of poppy seeds and onion. Having a sweet taste, this Padmaparer delicacy will make you fall in love.

3. Ilish er muro ghonto - Mixed vegetables tempered with panch phoron and prepared with fried hilsa heads.

4. Gandhoraj ilish - hilsa in a curry of rich lemon flavour and seasoned with nigella seeds is light and rich. Not missing this would be the wisest as the wonder taste of ilish is intact.

5. Lotika ilish - ilish cooked in a curry of grated coconot, mustard paste and taro stolons is an authentic Bangali dish made of kochur loti.

6. Dhakai ilish bhapa - Steamed hilsa with mustard sauce and grated coconut. Rich and simply irresistible.

7. Ilish paturi - ilish marinated in hung curd, mustard seed and chillies, and then wrapped in banana leaf and steamed. The age old traditional dish is all set to make you fall in love.

8. Kancha lonka dhonepata bata bhapa ilish -steamed hilsa cooked in a magical blend of fresh coriander leaves and green chillies.

9. Ilish biryani - basmati rice cooked with hilsa, spices and saffron in dum phukt style.

10. Kochu saag diye ilish - a unique blend of hilsa cooked with stems of taro.

11. Ilish purey bhapa potol- ridges stuffed with deboned hilsa and cooked in garlic and chilli tempered poppy seeds paste was yet another new experiment. This time its potol with ilish instead of chingri.

To all the fish lovers of Kolkata, don't miss the chance, to relieve the magic moments of yesteryear recreated. Rush in soon.

Cheers!

Dhakar Shwade, Ilish Paate – Hilsa Festival at De Sovrani..!

If we look for the year to change and come back to where it had left, it is mainly because of three things. Durga Puja, Mango and Hilsa. The undying love, passion and the bonding we have with these three celebrations and occasions is unmatched. There is a sense of belief, trust, love and attachment when it comes to them. Hilsa, the undisputed queen of fish is as close to our heart as is Mango to us. If summer season signifies the arrival of Mangoes, the monsoon signifies the onset of Hilsa fish. 

‘Sand’, the trademark restaurant of ‘The Sovrani’, is celebrating the Hilsa festival this year, by offering fifteen different kind of Hilsa preparations. Created with utmost care, love and perfection, each of these Hilsa preparations come with a set meal of rice, lentils, fritters, chutney, papad and sweets. Thus, it is more of a total and complete meal for a single person. This is something very few or none of the restaurants are offering. The preparations reflect the authentic way of cooking as can be found in Bangladesh, most of these recipes has now been lost due to the growing change of modernization.

Following are the Hilsa preparations which can be availed for this festival:

1. Dhakai ilish bhapa – Steamed hilsa with mustard paste and grated coconut.

2.ilish paturi – Hilsa marinated with hung card, mustard paste and chili wrapped in banana leaf and steamed

3. Ilish er korma – Cooked in a rich gravy made with poppy seeds & onion.

4. Ilish pur-e bhapa potol – Parwal stuffed with deboned hilsa and cooked in garlic and chili tempered poppy seed paste.

5. Ilish er kofta curry – Fried kota of deboned hilsa cooked in a tomato onion gravy.

6. Gondhoraj ilish – Hilsa in a curry of rich lemon flavour, tempered with nigella seeds.

7. Kochu saag diye ilish – A unique blend of hilsa cooked with stems of taro.

8. Tele begune ilish – A traditional preparation of hilsa with brinjal.

9. Ilish er tel jhaal – Hilsa cooked with cumin, green chilli and ginger paste tempered with nigella seeds.

10. Lotika ilish – Ilish cooked in a blended curry of grated coconut, mustard paste and taro stolons.

11. Kancha lonka dhone pata bata bhape ilish – Steamed hilsa with a magical blend of fresh coriander leaves & green chillies.

12. Kalo jeera kancha lonka diye ilish – A classical preparation of hilsa with nigella seeds & fresh green chillies.

13. Ilish er muro diye ghanto – mixed vegetable tempered with panch phoron and cooked with the fried heads of hilsa.

14. Ilish er kofta pulao – deboned hilsa koftas cooked with basmati rice and aromatic spices.

15. Ilish biriyani – basmati rice cooked with hilsa & spices in sum pukht style.

So, if you were looking for a place to enjoy Hilsa preparations, but with an authentic Bangladeshi touch, look no further and come today to Sand – de Sovrani. I can promise you that the preparations are bound to win you over.

Went for the taste of authentic hilsa preparation of Bangladesh, was very disappointed! The quality of hilsa is the key to a good preparation and it was definitely not up to the mark. Ordered Ilish lotika , totally bland ilish , not cleaned properly ,so slightly bitter.The other was dhone pata (coriander leaves) and kacha Lanka( green chillies) bhaja(steamed) ilish.... tasted better but the recipe flopped cause the most important ingredient is a good quality fish was missing.
Regarding  service, the two dishes should arrive together, since it was not so, ilish lotika and it's accompaniment of daal, rice. Potatoes and parwal fried became cold since the other dish took such a long time to come.
Both the meal came with a pair of rosogolla each, but alas without a dessert spoon!!@Waiters were polite but not too attentive I guess. When my husband asked for a dessert spoon he was provided with one.I did not have the heart to ask again!!
So friends, remember ilish festivals are quite a disappointment if the quality of fish is not good.

If you are a bong, then this must be your most awaited part of the year. With the arrival of monsoon at this time of the year, the local markets get flooded with hilsa in large numbers. The hilsa loving bongs get crazy and to satisfy their love for hilsa, they try out various preparations of this fish. Seeing the local craze for hilsa, the restaurants in the city come up with special menu and festivals to attract hilsa lovers. To set a new trend, several restaurants are focussing more on innovation and fusion dishes with hilsa, thereby making an attempt to change the way by which we are used to have it. Thus, the authentic and traditional hilsa preparations are slowly losing their charm. Noticing this fact, De Sovrani, Salt Lake has launched a wide range of authentic hilsa preparations whose origin is Bangladesh.

I have been a regular visitor of the hotel but on 8th July 2016, I went there for dinner but a staff named Mr. Sayantan Banerjee not only spoiled the occasion with his arrogant behavior but also disrespected our guests.

As we entered the dining area, we were expecting 12 guests, we informed the staff that we would require to join two tables as maximum capacity for each table was six, it was surprising to hear Mr. Sayantan Banerjee tell us that it was not possible to join two tables and if we yet insist to do it, they will place the food but will not serve us. We overlooked the matter and proceeded ahead.

We wanted to place two bills, on the first bill, we had told Mr. Banerjee, we will use the 1 on 1 coupon, after payment of the first bill, we had proceeded to order the items on second bill. Mr. Sayantan Banerjee took it to his discretion that we will use the same coupons on the second bill and he did not deem it necessary to take our permission and we were ignorant of the rule that we have to tell the coupon that we are using at the time of placing orders so at the end when we asked for the bill, we wanted to use 50% off coupons but weren't allowed to. Not only that, Mr. Sayantan Banerjee was not ready to listen to us neither to co-operate or make us understand the circumstances. It was completely his mistake of taking things lightly and on his own discretion and yet he put the blame on us and stated false terms not mentioned in the agreement that we can use one offer in a day. In the agreement it is mentioned one offer on one bill.

Mr. Sayantan Banerjee even dared to disrespect our guest by turning his head away and not responding when he was directly being talked to.

Over all a very bad experience to an old customer. Very unsatisfied.

Service here is very bad, it may be due to the shortage of staff during peak hours but normally also they take a bit of time if they are said to bring something, coming to the taste of the food it's good.

This restaurant looks really pretty and posh. Good ambiance, you can sit and converse with another in peace. Had gone there at an odd time of 6pm and hence few dishes were not available from the menu. We ordered fish and chips which we had as a starter, spaghetti avioli, and a dish of lamb ribs with a fresh lime soda. The food did not live up to the mark and was ok at best. This was disappointing as its an expensive restaurant. The chicken steak could have been juicier,they served it with a lot of broccoli and boiled potatoes instead of mashed ones which I didn't like much. The lamb ribs were tasty although difficult to eat :-D. The sauce of the lamb dish wasn't full of flavours and my friend remarked that they should have more options for pasta. Overall,I will label this restaurant strictly OK...

Visited this place for dinner. Nice place, very well decorated. We tried out almost all the non veg indian curry dishes,all of them were good. Chicken was soft and well cooked, not fried too much an then dipped into a gravy. The gravy was nice, as none of the ingredients stood out particularly. Only one mutton dish on offer, it was good too. No complaints at the price. People who served us were pertty helpful and knew about the dishes.

We set out for a grand ashtami brunch and found most of the restaurants having waiting time for 45 mins minimum. Thought De Sovrani will be a little better and it turned out to be true as they are a little pricey for the puja buffet. The interiors are classy and sets a great mood for good food. Coming to the buffet, it was a mix and match of Bengali, mughlai and Chinese and I found no logic in the spread. I mean bhuna khichudi and chicken chnap is never a great combo. The mughlai food specially the tandoori chicken was a delight and perfectly cooked. Also liked the biriyani as it had a mild flavor and not so oily. They dessert section had variety of Bengali sweets including chhanar polao and mihidana but the mishti doi was a little stale. It's risky when you put the entire handi as it needs special care to cut the dahi from handi else it tends to get soured. The payesh they served was real disaster and tasted like doodh-bhat. It's never easy to make payesh and one needs to learn the trick to make the best payesh. Overall felt a little pricey @1100 ai for the food.

Recenty went to De Sovrani for their Restraunt Sand. We went there for a Durga Puja Special Dinner Buffet. Initially we liked their hospitality. Hotel interior was good but not maintained properly. Even the wall paintings have become pale. Food variety in buffet was not great although many things were mentioned in the menu. Flat on face they said 'we dont have any soup today' when in their menu we could see atleast 3 or 4 choices of soup. In buffet they had only one item from chinese but again menu card said something else. Can we not expect much better service from such a well known brand and from any star category hotel restaurant? Even the road side restaurant maintains what they promise on their menu card. Food quality was good, as expected. Overall experience was not that great, had much more expectations. Service wise i would rate them max 2 but due to food quality i gave 3.

When writing about all the other restaurants, I should not miss the one where I have breakfast every day. I stayed in de sovrani hotel and sand is their restaurant. Every morning I had my breakfast. I didn't get much interest on their breakfast menu. It's the same most days and not many choices to choose for the breakfast. But the staff are so friendly and the interior is beautiful.
One day I got the call from reception and they said they're giving a complimentary buffet dinner. We went for the dinner last Sunday and I did not have any expectations thinking it's going to be like the usual experience. But to my surprise there menu was completely different and the most important thing to mention is salad. I love salads and was excited to see so many salads there. All tasted good. The pasta was OK. But the biriyani, noodles and Manchurian was very good. Sand is best to try for a buffer dinner if you love to try a variety of food.

I had visited this place for dinner with my family. It is located quite near to City Center 1. What I noticed particularly is that inspite of all the tables being filled up....they really treat you special. From a warm welcome smile to offering seats to presenting the menu....all was very courteous. Coming to the ambiance I must say that it is one of a class. The beautiful chandelier being the prime attraction. Decent decorations and wonderful view makes your dining even more pleasant. 

 For the starters we had Ajwaini Mahi Tikka. For the mains we had Lucknowi Dum Biryani and Murgh Tikka Tawa Masala. For Desserts we had Hot Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream. The food were all finger licking good. Good in taste and yet light on you. Nothing to complain about...all praises. I was really happy with everything about it. Had a very wonderful experience and would love to visit again and again.

I highly recommend visiting this place and I am sure you will fall in love with the experience.

I had visited this place with my family for dinner a few days back.Located in Salt lake sector 1 the ambience and decor of this place is brilliant.The comfortable seating arrangements,the tasteful choice of furniture,the lovely chandelier,the overall cleanliness every thing added up to a wonderful ambience which impressed us all.

Coming to the food,we availed the dinner buffet.The buffet spread was impressive but the quality was not so impressive.We started off with a hot and sour soup, crispy chicken and a tandoori aloo which were served on the table itself.The soup was honestly horrible and none of us could even complete half of our portions.The crispy chicken was crisp outside and well cooked inside.The marination was good.We liked it.
The main course comprised of a wide array of preparations both veg and non veg,most of which were pretty average.The biryani tasted like rice with some amount of added attor in it.The rotis and nuns were nice and soft and they were served fresh on the table.The palak corn and the paneer butter masala were okay.The fish fry was nice and I liked the fact that they provided tartar sauce to go with the fries.There was also various types of veg and non veg salad on offer which I did not taste.
For desserts,again the spread was impressive but the quality was not.Many of the desserts did not taste fresh.The brownie seemed stale.The firni tasted of the same attor which was used in the biryani.The custard was pretty horrible too.The sandesh was nice and fresh though.

The service was nice and swift.The waiters were very polite and friendly.They tried their best to help us with whatever we wanted.The price was around 800 per person which is about the standard price for a buffet at most places these days.

Overall this is a place which impressed in terms of ambience and decor and everything else but the quality of food which is the most  important part of any restaurant left a lot to be desired.

I had visited this place for dinner with my family. It is located quite near to City Center 1. What I noticed particularly is that inspite of all the tables being filled up....they really treat you special. From a warm welcome smile to offering seats to presenting the menu....all was very courteous. Coming to the ambiance I must say that it is one of a class. The beautiful chandelier being the prime attraction. Decent decorations and wonderful view makes your dining even more pleasant. 

 For the starters we had Ajwaini Mahi Tikka. For the mains we had Lucknowi Dum Biryani and Murgh Tikka Tawa Masala. For Desserts we had Hot Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream. The food were all finger licking good. Good in taste and yet light on you. Nothing to complain about...all praises. I was really happy with everything about it. Had a very wonderful experience and would love to visit again and again.

I highly recommend visiting this place and I am sure you will fall in love with the experience.

Recently went there with my family. The interiors of the entire hotel gave a nice impression but soon you realise how pathetic the service is. We went on a weekday and the restaurant was full. Obviously with only 6 tables the restaurant will always look full. The manager was rude and would listen to half the order and vanish. We called for basic starters and took more than an hour to serve. For the main course we waited for more than 1 hour and were served half cooked rotis. The food was disgusting for the amount we paid. Veg Au Gratin was half cooked and Channa Masala had a disgusting odor. The rotis has raw atta on it and very half cooked. The overall experience was bad and not worth spending lot of money. Would not recommend this place to anyone.

Well, this is an average place considering if you give a miss to the '4 star' thing mentioned about them, because Sand is no where close to a 4 star restaurant right from its setting( I found it to congested), to food and to its service(slow).
Compared to any other four star its a below average restaurant. The only thing that will impress you is the well decorated and lavish interior.
Coming to the food, it was nothing extraordinary, I had been there both for buffet and à la carte. In the buffet, starters were served cold, dimsum was nothing better than rubber stuffed with chicken filling. Red wine served of the cheapest quality, they could have at least serve sula. However, I liked their paneer kofta, a mutton prep, the meat was tender and kiwi cheese cake. Its an absolutely normal restaurant with a nice decor. And may be their staff could improve a bit more on the hospitality front.

Coming to the point directly let me tell you the only good thing about this place..it's interiors..

I had gone there for dinner buffet..to start with the snacks we were offered one veg starter and one non veg starter..both the snacks were very spicy and bad..chicken was stale..the soup was average..

For main course the options were limited..nothing tasted nice..

Deserts were average..salads were stale..

The place is not even worth one visit..service is average..service was slow though there wasn't rush..

I disliked the place completely and would not recommend the place to anyone..

To be honest, I had one of the best experience in food and service till now. Visiting at an odd hour, and still getting the best prepared food is commendable. Arrangements done specially for us though we didn't book ourselves before hand. The quantity and and the quality of food is served best to us. Hot garlic chicken was tender, spicy and had the exact taste that we required. Impressive. Yummy. Staff courtesy is another highlight of Sand, De Sovarani. It's definitely on our next visit. :)
Thank You

Visited y'day - school Alumni get together @ the Maple and lunch at Sand
I will rate it as ok, the buffet area as in most restaurants is cramped in the desserts corner and the salads section. The greeting from the Sand staff was a put off. We were a huge group and went to the empty tables. The restaurant staff was not bothered where all of us will sit and asked us to go to the left side... that kind of killed the context setting for the lunch that followed.
There was a spread as in most buffets, the only items i remember now are the lemon corriander chicken soup, mixed veg noodles and the thai green curry. The desserts kept vanishing faster than they tried to replenish. Would suggest serving smaller pieces of cakes/pudding so that all can try out 1 - which is usually the eating style in the buffets.

That's it!

We stepped out of the house to go somewhere close by (read Salt Lake) that serves continental and would be new to our senses. Up came Sand - De Sovrani on the Zomato results apart from the usual. After much debate we agreed on the same since my Granny was also coming along and she wouldn't have been up for much of a walk just to gorge. Located at a fairly wide juncture close to City Centre, making for an easy car park, De Sovrani had till then often been just a hotel I would drive by. Stepping into it and choosing a corner with a view to the street, it was plain amazing! Add to that the factor of maddening rain outside. 
Soon up we ordered for a Badshahi Tandoori Khazana - an assorted platter of chicken, prawn, mutton and fish (Bhekti) kebabs. Yes, came for continental and ended up ordering Kebabs instead. The prawn was succulent and soft, while the fish was fresh and well marinated. Chicken happened to be a usual tangri kebab, I would say. But the mutton seekh was quite a surprise with a certain level of crunchiness to it, attributed to the crushed peanut though I still secretly feel it was coconut since I couldn't taste those nuts in there. All over, a nice platter.
Next came four different orders - a typical Fried Bekti with Tartar sauce and fries, an Asian herb marinated grilled basa with chef style potato and greens, a typical Carbonara with chicken and cheese and "Sand's" suggestion Poulet Farcis ala Pimentos with Merlot Jus. While the Bekti and Pasta were up to the mark and cannot be made any special note about, except for the fact that one wouldn't be in the least disappointed with them. The Basa was amazing, as the fish itself is quite tasteful and has a nice smell to itself. The chicken in merlot jus - well, all I would say is keep asking for that merlot jus sauce as without that the dish is just incomplete. Chicken stuffed with minced chicken was a first for me too. A special mention must be made of the mashed potato that came with the Basa and the chicken. Looks like a mountain of extra boiled, sticky rice, due to the yellow colour, but its just plain yumm once you dig in it.
Even though we were quite full by then, I couldn't resist ordering a Lemon Honey Cheesecake with Blueberry Sauce. A combination of Lemon and Honey along with Blueberry, a sure tease to the senses, it was sinful and amazing (of course nothing can beat anything that is chocolate for me). Soft, smooth and a bit of tang along with the sweet. Perfect ending. By the way, it was my mom's birthday celebration :)

They say eating at a good restaurant can make you feel like a king, but historically kings always had to eat in their castles and probably alone. Feel even better than royalty to have a lavish meal with friends at De Sovrani. It strives to satisfy discerning palates with a range of Indian, Asian and International cuisines amidst elegant décor comprising of comfy, high-back chairs, warm lighting and classy dining ware. As usual we started with ‘Chicken Manchaw’ & ‘Chicken Lemon Coriander’ soups as appetizers. Chicken Manchaw soup was really yummy, spicy and had nice fillings. For starters we opted for ‘Crispy Chilli Baby Corn’ & ‘Wings of Fire’ accompanied with ‘Sunriser’ Orange based & Cranberry based mocktails.  Wings of Fire was spicy, crunchy and oh so delicious!  It has the perfect kind of melt in your mouth combinations that will have you coming back for seconds and thirds!. Crispy Chilli Baby Corn also well cooked and had nice flavours. Sunrisers give a wonderful sense of relaxation and had a soothing effect. Selection of main course was little difficult because of their huge menu, but finally we decided to go for ‘Mixed Vegetable in Hot Garlic Sauce’, ‘Sanghai Lamb with Star Anise’,  ‘De Sovrani Chaw Chaw Rice’, ‘Pan Fried Noodle’ and ‘Pickled Vegetable Salad’.  Mixed Vegetable in Hot Garlic Sauce tasted delicious and went well with Pan Fried Noodle. De Sovrani Chaw Chaw Rice tasted average and I found it little salty, may be due to the gravy they serve with the rice. Sanghai Lamb with Star Anise was delightful, mouth-watering and very aromatic. We had ‘Darshan’ with vanilla ice cream as dessert, and it was perfectly done with right amount of honey and absolutely delicious. Sporting a blend of contemporary design and urban chic, De Sovrani provides warm hospitality and culinary excellence, definitely worth a visit.

I had gone for a Buffet dinner priced at Rs.750/person. The food was pathetic and sub-standard for the place and ambiance. With hardly any variety in the vegetarian section the food was not even passable. The attentive staff and servers were a plus but still dont make up for the terrible servings. From starters to deserts there was nothing you would like coming back for. Overall a disastrous meal.

Well I didn't expect much out of this place.. Bt it indeed surprised me.. We went to this place today.. Me n my dad went for the buffet which consisted of authentic Bengali cuisine since it was puja special.. My brother and my mom opted for the a LA carte.. And they surprised us with the excellent lamb in green chilli sauce and King paoa chicken. And as for the buffet I loved the mutton chingri bhapa.. And the dessert section was indeed impressive. 

Coming to the ambience one just cannot come in about it.. But I feel they should have more variety I their a LA carte menu.. 

Overall we had a really good family lunch..

oh...so i am not the only one who got "sorry no tables available for tomorrow" when i called them up on four different days of the week in the last two months. ultimately, the deal expired and groupon was gracious enough to refund the amount to me. this must either be the best restaurant in the world who has advance booking SOLD OUT ON EACH AND EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK or they must have taken pity on me by forbidding me to taste their tasteless food ( as the reviews suggests)...na..no wonder then that a MRP of 3000 is sold for 399 and that too is not worth the salt.

Armed with a Groupon coupon which promised us a generous Chinese meal for two, I had on previous days made multiple attempts to get a booking, and this is the only restaurant to tell me on multiple occasions that they had no tables available! We finally managed a table for the day the deal was to expire.

A friend and I walked in after locating the Hotel De Sovrani (we couldn't for our lives figure out what it meant), The so claimed 4 star property did not look the best that it could have been. Walked into the 1st floor restaurant. We were guided to a reserved table. One side had large windows overlooking the road. The furniture was done in tacky pista green among other colours. A waiter provided us the menu, a very limited menu from which to choose. There were just 4 items in each category. The special deal menu itself looked in tatters, not the best way to welcome a guest. We were served the mocktail of the day, a fruit punch. Was okay, but had to ask for ice. Was very obviously made from Real juice.

For the soup I opted for a chicken manchow. Was rather nicely done, light and very clean tasting, though I couldn't spot any noodles in it. My friend went with a chicken lemon coriander soup, which he seemed pleased with. The starters we opted for were Thai spring roll (not too flavourful and rather salty) and a sliced chilli chicken which was sour, and nothing like any chilli chicken I have tasted. Moreover, it was clumpy instead of sliced and had a yellow tinge. Not nice at all.

For main course I noticed the menu stated only vegetarian dishes and I mentioned my coupon said non-veg, whereupon I was given another menu that had non-veg items. I believe they changed the deal midway, because of which the difference in the menu. We opted for fish in some sauce I cannot recall, basically bits of basa in lots of gravy with red and yellow bell pepper. Very disappointing. The other one, sliced lamb (once again in a sauce I cannot recall) was actually rather nice. With it we had veg pan fried noodles (passable) and a veg fried rice (indifferent). Khimchi was served with it.

Dessert was Darsaan (no clue why they insist calling it darshan). It was a tad too sweet, with low quality vanilla icecream (most likely Rollick). Passable!

The service was fair. Definitely not 4 star. But when I have all this for Rs 399, I guess there should not be  too much heartbreak. But if I had been paying menu price for this meal, there would definitely have been strong discontent lodged. I had to ask twice for ice. Service was quick though. At the end of the meal, they provided damp and tasteless mint coated saunf (very annoying when it is that way) along with Alpenliebe. Why Alpenliebe?

I also have a grouse against the portions served. While on the whole it was probably enough, the way it was described made it sound like it was way more. Like they mentioned two soups, without mentioning the portions are half the size. Same was the case with the rice and noodles.

I am not sure what their regular meals tastle like. I doubt I would go to find out. But yeah, If this deal repeated, I would perhaps buy it again.

a perfect lunch in a perfect ambience. we got some vouchers from groupon and that proved to be a very good experience. by the way, for people with vouchers, the place has got a set menu but you get quite a number of choices in that too.the shorba was not that commendable but what followed next more than made up for that. the chicken seekh kabab was nicely done but the betki was a winner. the mutton rogan josh could have been far better. the fish items were really good but the malai kofta was just awesome. we ordered masala kulcha and lachchha paratha which were just perfect. the peas polao was also tasty. they forgot to serve us dal which were part of the deal bought but by that time we were too full. for desserts we had walnut brownie with chocolate  sauce which i found a bit hard. the sweet crepes were really tasty. one con which i found is that the service was quite late between the starters n the main course. all in all,a great experience

Few cons to mention:-
Chicken as a whole was hardy & not fresh.
Other than fruit punch, no other mocktail was available under Online deal and oh! yes! the Fruit Punch didn't taste nice.
But overall experience was nice and the vanilla icecream scoops were yummm. Foodies, go give it a try!

Enjoyed thir Lemon Corriander Soup, Fish in Schewan sauce, Sanghai Lamb with Star Anise & Seet crepe in Butterscotch sauce thoroughly. Ambience was also very nice.
Few cons to mention:-
Chicken as a whole was hardy & not fresh.
Other than fruit punch, no other mocktail was available under Online deal and oh! yes! the Fruit Punch didn't taste nice.
But overall experience was nice and the vanilla icecream scoops were yummm. Foodies, go give it a try!

The first time, I visited this restaurant was for a buffet lunch with my office colleagues. That experience was nothing short of just fantastic ! Great food and great service. One of the Service Manager Mr. Atrajit took extra care of us... thanks to him... :)  Starting with mocktails... litchi anf fruit punch.... the starters.. murgh nawabi tikka and spring roll.... with huge variety of salads and soups.. were too good... in the indian maincourse gost biriyani , chicken lababdar , baked lemon bhetki and lamb hotpot was just awesome.... chinese dishes were also good....
The best part - desserts - vanilla , buttescoth ice-cream , molten chocolate , malpua , mango cheese cake , black forest pastry , Chocolate mousse , gulab jamun , chocolate pudding , caramel pudding , rosogolla , Rose Sandesh ... what more ?? everything was delicious and irresitable. Thoroughly enjoyable experience with my friends... will go here again and probably again. :)

I went to Sand -De  Sovrani for a family dinner from the deal purchased from Groupon.co.in. The ambience is too good. The staff and the service was excellent. This was the first time I received an Excellent Service in Kolkata. Especially thanks to Mr. Atrajit. The food which they provided us was excellent. The tomato dhaniya shorba has a unique taste. The starters were good. Dal Makhani & Gobi Adhrak masala were very tasty. The blue lagoon & the walnut brownie with ice cream added an advantage to the whole menu set up by them , This is a must place for everyone to visit again. And I am waiting for my next opportunity to enjoy their excellent service again.

I went there for poila boisak bengali lunch buffet and was swept away by their grub. Its tasty and the quality is fantastic. Kudos to their chef! Their service is like any five star and their staff are extremely courteous and friendly. They make you want to go back there again but well, as a customer the food is a big draw. Coming to what i are, i must say that the Buffett was way too much for me to even remember but roughly speaking there were 8 kinds of bhaja and 5 kinds of chutney. This episode of gluttony had begun with aam panna and coconut water which were extremely appetising. Then there was mochar chop and chingri'r chop which reminded me of age old shops like allen's kitchens and kalika. Then,there was a host of veggie curries such as cottage cheese curry or chanr dalnA, potoler dorma, bati chochori, cholar dal, echor and shukto. But it wAs the non vegetarian options that stuffed me up. The posto chicken was unique. Kochi parhar jhol and humongous shorshe parshey and bhapa chingri were at their traditional best. If they incorporate this bengali menu in their regular thorough fare then they can give o Calcutta a run for their money. The morola macher tok was pretty decent though it was the first time i had it. Added to this they had 10 types of desert! Great cooking and great selection of menu. Me likes big time! For the stuff you get the buffet is totally worth it. I had been here earlier as well and was a big fan,of their biriyani. Cooking is good over all. The decor is pretty grand as well.if u havnt tried it yet, you must give it a shot.
