Earlier it was value for money but not in taste, has stayed the same over the years without getting better. Hat's off... Prices has been increased manifold under the pretext of overheads. Home delivery most times not available when under severe duress, as is common with Kolkata restaurants. The chicken dishes are better as it is supplied by their own shop. They also had catering service during Durga Puja, not aware if it still continues.

The place is located behind the kepar math of the James long sarani. Its ambience was okay. I ordered schezwan egg noodles from here, which was amazing. It came up to according to my expectations and hence i would definitely advice to taste at least this dish from this place. Itâ€™s worth it.

Food quality and ambience is not so good. Moreover it doesn't feel hygienic. Not recommended to visit. For take away may be okay but not for dining.

Ordered food via Swiggy. Thus no idea about ambience and staff. But food. It was my worst experience ever. We ordered Chicken Pan Fried Momo and Chicken Drumstick. The Chicken Drumstick was too hot and spicy. From our mouth to our stomach it went burning. None of us could finish it. Relief to this pain was the Chicken Pan Fried Momo which was not as spicy as the Drumstick. But it was not tasty itself though. Both the items were made with too much of food color as well. I would have given 1 but half a marks more for being serviceable in such a bad weather when many restaurants became unserviceable. Hope they improves their food quality in future.

Lost count of how many times we have ordered from this joint. Without a doubt can say that all dishes in the menu have been tried and tasted. Maybe not that a posh joint but satisfying our hunger since childhood. Never been disappointed.

It can be visited for its cheap rate. Just behind of the kepar math at behala. Decoration is just ok. We ordered veg noodles with chilli chicken. Nothing special to mention.

I used to love their thai cuisine especially the lipu chicken and also all the other chinese items.... they used fresh and unique ingredients which hardly any other restaurants in behala uses but with time the taste and quality of food has detoriated drastically plus they had stopped serving their thai menu

A local Fast Food Joint with a sit and dine facility. The price is really reasonable and by reasonable i mean even a person with a 100 buks and end up having enough to make him fill full. The fast food like rolls, pakodas, spring roll is a real hot sell here and is a must try. Other than these we get noodles, fried rice and other stuff. Tried almost every thing there and would suggest people to be there anytime, wont regret for sure

The rolls are yum, paratha is medium thick but fried well, the fillings are tasty and the quality of sauce used is pretty good. Apart from that , had Kadhai Chicken, Fried Rice, Schzwan Chicken and few other chinese side dishes. But the pasta was not too great. They give free home delivery upto a certain distance , and we live nearby. Delivery is prompt and food is piping hot.
