Had a great experience! Ordered cupcakes-(comes in pack of 6) death by rocher and death by Scarlett which were customized as per my ideas. Sunaina was there to assist me and shape my ideas- truly, a great help!
You only need to watsapp her or call her. It's not a store, look for the apartment ( 267, jodhput park) on the street opposite to jodhpur boys' school.

The cupcakes were just amazing! And price is pretty reasonable (total came to 840 with customised toppings complete with pearly beads and everything). They looked so beautiful that it was difficult for us to even take a bite! But glad we did it! Thank you zomato and melodrama team!
Looking forward to tasting all the flavors on offer.
It's a must try for everyone.

Had a great 1st time experience but the 2nd time experience was really disgusting!! I ordered a 1 pound  Ferrero Rocher cake but it was a plain chocolate cake with only one Ferrero Rocher on the top. The cale was also nothing extra ordinary like it was before. And I also ordered 10 cup cakes but few of them were also not properly baked at the base. Really disappointed with the 2nd time experience.

Customised Cupcakes! What more could I wish for as a birthday gift! Thank you so much Shreya! Lots of love to you. I would surely like to taste every cupcake on your menu. As for the Red Velvet and Ferroro Rocher, they were terrific!

Redefining cakes, not in their own way, but according to the buyer's wishes, is how I would describe my first experience of Melodrama. Truer words were never said... "Cakes, Bakes and Drama". The occasion being my wife's birthday, I wanted to surprise her with something different. The theme I wanted, revolved around the legendary Satyajit Ray's transcendental movie Gupi Gayen Bagha Bayen... and the granting of three wishes by Bhooter Raja to the duo. And lo and behold... Melodrama granted my wish by coming up with the perfect theme. In a wonderful gesture the cake was delivered at my doorstep by the CEO herself.. Sunayna Basu.. another thank you for taking care of your customers in such an amazing manner.
The cake as you can check out from the pics was done immaculately. The flavour selected was Ferrero Rocher Fondant and truly was one of the best I have ever experienced and to top it all... the theme.
In the end we all were feeling terribly miserable at the very thought of cutting the cake...after all destroying a piece of art is a sin... ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.
Thank you to the team and looking forward to many such magical experiences.
P.S. Please do not make cakes so perfect that your customers would not want to eat it...ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Am still feeling miserable at having devoured that delicious work of art.

5 months fast forward and Melodrama continue spreading their magic....this time a surprise for me from my wife.Check the second set of pics.

I had a wonderful experience with the Melodrama bakery recently when I ordered a cake and cup cakes for my mother's birthday.
We wanted a simple pineapple cake & what they delivered was just that - simple and delicious! The cup cakes were too adorable and everyone loved them too.
