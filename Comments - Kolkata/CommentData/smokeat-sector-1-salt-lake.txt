Ambience is lovely.. Visit with friends and trust me you will enjoy it ❤️
The prices are quite reasonable and staffs are also helpful.. I think we all have a beautiful place in our mind. I have a wonderful place that made me happy a lot of times, years ago. But sometimes I think that I am the only person who likes this place and I'm asking myself if this place will be as beautiful as I thought when I will go back to visit it again. Perhaps I made it beautiful in my mind. 

This place is meaningful to me because it is part of the county I loved, is part of the county where I grew up and is part of my childhood

This was my second visit to this place couldnt share my first experience so thought of visiting this place and try some more items and share with all.
But i was so dissappointed with the items i tried here on my first visit and which i honestly liked the most that i didnt had the courage to order more.
Guys this place served a mouth licking dish which is kajun chicken tender strips and was a must try for all chicken lovers and my favourite too..
But it failed to impress me the same way it did the first time i visited here. Due to the change in their internal staff and all.
This time whatever we ordered was not at all upto the mark except a drink name deep blue sea. We orded for:
1) Mediterraen pizza ( didnt eat only as it was little undercooked and very dry)☹
2) Kajun chicken tender strips( tasted good but not the original way) 😕
3) 2 Hookah.☹
4) 2 cold drinks ( didn taste that may be coz of too much ice).☹
5) Deep blue sea.☺
And costed us Rs. 1700 approax. And this time it was a complete wastage..😭
I hope that this place really does something with the quality of food they are serving. Because food is something which can avoid the loopholes in ambience, infrastructure and decor but vice versa is little difficult.

Shifted to manicktala. Well mostly a hookah joint with abysmal food option. Staffs are clueless about food available. Ordered a chicken pasta off the menu but was billed differently. The place was stuffed with localites who were all known to the waiters. The sitting is on small bed sized lounge sofas with a glass top in the centre. Low lighting. AC sometimes not working due to hookah smoke.
Well it was a haphazard thing.
Surely put off. Theres a small sitting on the first floor which is an option if your not smoking.
But as most of the food is not available, wonder what you would eat!

Update:I ordered from this place via Zomato online order for a 'Roasted chicken legs' for which the final amount was 'Rs 147.65' after the restaurant's ongoing promo.Firstly the order was accepted and I was given a time of 45 mins for the order to be delivered.After waiting for 45 mins I recieve a call from Zomato that from the merchant's side it is said that the order has been cancelled however there was no input from my side.After 2 mins I recieve an update call from Zomato saying the restaurant person said that the order was not avialable when I ordered but now after 45 mins it is avialable and they are dispatching the same within 20 mins which I could not understand how it is possible.After the food got delivered what I recieved was raw almost uncooked rice,few pieces of burnt veggies and two undercooked chicken legs that are completely pink inside.The whole food had to be dumped into the trash.The restaurant either had decided to not deliver my order from the very beginning which I presume is for the low amount but as soon as they recieved a call from Zomato they hurriedly packed up some uncooked mess and parcelled it.I would ask the restaurant management ,if they are actually reading this,that if you really want to cancel orders please do at the very beginning instead of harrassing customers,providing uneatable food and creating a complete unpleasant experience.
P.S : Zomato customer care was very supportive and instantly looked into the matter though the restaurant did not recieve any calls of Zomato after the order was delivered.

Old Review:
My first impression of this restaurant was not at all good.I had ordered a sandwich named 'Original Cuban Sandwich' in their menu.The sandwich was basically chicken salami and cheese sandwich which is nowhere near Cuban Sandwich.So basically just putting any familiar name for a dish which is not even near to the original recipe disappointed me.I again gave a try today.Ordered Barbeque chicken legs,crispy chilli babycorn and speacial berry compote waffle.
The crunch of the babycorn was really impressive.Sitting in the sauce for about more than one hour but still it retained some crunch.T he sauce was perfect with the sweetness and spicy flavour but to me it was a bit more ketchupy.
Next,the roasted barbeque legs.Two jumbo sized chicken legs,a good amount of mashed potato and a handful of grilled veggies(bell peppers,zucchini,brocoli).The chicken was juicy and perfectly grilled from outside.The sauce was NOT sweet which I find in most restaurants.I t had good amount of parsley and peooer in it.The mashed potatoed was not silky smooth but it had lots of butter and parsley making the potatoes taste awesome.The green zucchini was bitter in the veggies but other than that the quantity was of this dish was enough for two.At just 199 rupees this dish is worth a try.
Lastly,the waffles.I expected the berry compote to be freshly made but unfortunately it was not so,it was the strawberry crush we get in supermarket.This was the only flaw.Other than that the waffles were perfectly made with perfect sweetness.It was served with 4 toppings,again impressive.They provide maple syrup with waffles.

The second try for this joint really appreciable.I am looking forward for trying the other continental dishes from this place.

I gave my birthday treat at smokeat. The food is good and at reasonable prices unlike some of the hang out places. The quantity and quality of the food is real good. The place offer great non vegetarian and vegetarian dishes to chose from. If you want to have waffles and pancakes it caters to that too and a large number of shakes to choose from for the shake lovers like me. Overall this place is real good, the food is good, the ambience is nice. The only issue is that their speed of service is not that great.

Visited this place with my friends. Great place to have party with friends and chill. The atmosphere is cool and the we loved the foods. We ordered barbeque chicken wings, Mexican chicken chowmien and Oreo shake brownie shake and cold blast shake. The first two dishes were awesome and the shakes tasted good although I couldn't feel much of a difference between them. The quantity is huge and worth the price. Like u can share 1 chowmien with 3 people. Definitely will visit again.

I have already reviewed this ones and i dont know how it got deleted. However a part from good music and good fish fry( the only dish i found great) i still dont like anything more about this cafe. We also ordered chicken wings and barbecue chicken which tasted more or less ok. The oreo shake could have been much better. And deleting reviews wont help you guys anyways!! Worst entrance, worst maintenance, one can notice cockroaches every where! I would rate .5 more for improvement in food quality.

My first impression of this cafe was good when a friend suggested me but when i visited the cafe i was really very disappointed.
The crowd here isn't good.
Loud music keeps on playing.
It isn't even cleaned properly.
The ac ceases to work.
And the shisha isn't too good.
Though the price is a bit low.

This place requires improvements.

Location is a bit strange. However the place is excellent. The interiors are well lit and decorated. Staff is friendly. The food is down right excellent. Ordered a Chinese non veg sizzler , a lasagna and spaghetti meatballs. The lasagna was extremely extremely awesome. The Chinese sizzler exceeded my expectations - had a generous amount of chicken pieces with quite a lot of rice . The spaghetti meatball however was too less in amount. All things considered, an excellent place to hang out with friends !

I really wanted to give a 5 for 'wow'ing me today.. however there were a few misses.

I have just finished my meal which i got delivered from Smokeat. I have never been to the place and I believe it is a new eatery.

I ordered a 'ShovelHead' Mexican Jalapẽno Burger and a classic Waffle. I ordered only two things and received a huge heavy bag. I peeked in and understood why their packing charges are a bit exorbitant.. two aluminium foil packs (one for waffle and the other one for crisps) there were 6 small containers (chocolate sauce, maple/fructose syrup, chocolate chips, Ketchup, mustard and some minty dip) and then a huge container with a JUMBO burger. I was floored. So many condiments!! but seriously you need to stop wasting so much of plastic!

Food, the most important bit for me when it comes to restaurant. The burger was huge and loaded. A thick patty, melting cheese, lots of vegetables, pickles, a brown bun; the burger had everything going for it. BUT, the patty lacked seasoning, almost no salt and it was kind of bland. NO jalapẽno :(
In short, there was nothing Mexican in it. Overall, a decent burger with a tiny bit of disappointment. 

I love waffles. These waffles looked pretty, but the batter had too much baking soda. That left a bitter aftertaste in the mouth. Since, I make waffles myself, I would know. The maple syrup wasn't like maple syrup it was some thing flavoured.. maybe fructose or corn syrup, and chocolate sauce didn't taste nice. But, all  this can be forgiven, because of the price of the waffles; however, the bitter aftertaste can't be forgiven. 

I have given them points for trying (too hard at that) and I hope they improve because this is a promising food joint with an interesting menu.

Tried home delivery from this newly opened restaurant. I tried the chicken maggi. It was nice. Herbs and chicken pieces were given generously. Salt was less and spices more but overall chef had tried the best. 

The peri peri chicken burger.....served black bread burger which was nice. It came with chips and french fries. The french fries was crispy for long.....it was deep fried for long  i suppose. The burger came wity 3 dips- tomato sauce,mustard sauce and cheese dip. All 3 were not required since the burger itself was too cheesy and had all necessary ingredients. The peri peri sauce was less in the burger and cheese was more but it was good and filling. The bread was too thick. 

Long way to go.

Situated between PNB Island and Salt Lake gate in sector 1, I crossed this place quite a lot of times and thought it was worth visiting once. The ambience is good and the service and staff are okay.! We ordered a mixed sauce pasta and nachos, since most of the drinks in the menu were not available. The nachos were still nice but the mixed sauce pasta had too much of herbs,destroying the taste. They can work more on the food quality though.!

Was looking for some hookah at around 12 midnight during Durga puja and found this place open. Liked the ambience initially. The hookah was good. They served beers too and just as we were about to order some food, we were asked to either leave or hide on the terrace. We asked what it was about and came to know that they do not have a license to alcohol or stay open after 10 pm so the cops had arrived. My point is why should I be hassled without any reason? I paid for stuff and it's not my fault that they don't have license. It's their duty to make sure customers aren't embarrassed. They should avoid doing what's illegal for them. The mood for completely ruined that night.

Today was my first visit and I really loved it here though when we came out the rain had destroyed the road a lot.
The ambience plain and beautiful. So made for a good sitting. What I liked most was the hospitality though service was a tad slow. 
We were using coupons and so the food came out to be at a very reasonable price.
Now for the food, the portion served was very good. The quantity of shake and size of the pizza was very impressive compared to the price stated in the menu. 
We ordered two pizza and both were well cooked and the base (I am not sure but I think they  made them) was different and very good. The pizza tasted good.
We ordered four shakes- 2 brownie shakes and they were amazing. 1 strawberry shake(No Comments- I hate strawberry) but my frnds said they were good. 1 pineapple shake which was little lite on pineapple taste. 
There was two started and I don't know their name ... One was babycorn which was served properly and tasted awesome. The other was panner cooked in dahi it wasn't one the menu so I don't know the name , it tasted average but the chef tried something new so I appreciate that. 
And then the hookah ..... Sorry I am not a smoker so no comments again.

Had visited this place with my friends and the food quality and the hookah was really good. Pasta and cold coffee was delicious but pizza was average. The hookah flavor was also amazing. Ambience and the environment and the staff was very nice and polite. A nice place to hangout with friends.
