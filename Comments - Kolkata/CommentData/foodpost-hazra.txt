The people here don't have any decency to talk to customers. Worst experience ever. Food took 1 hour 45 minutes to deliver at 12.30 am. Utter bullshit.

Food post is a cosy little joint trying to bring the perfect mix of quality and 
budget food on the same platter, I was quite impressed by the hands on approach of one of the owners of the joint when he took charge and delivered the order himself in the middle of the night , I had ordered a combi meal where in quality was a parameter which was not compromised upon, food post is a small fish in a big ocean trying to make their mark , and I recommend to try their menu for their quality, budget and impeccable personal service a combination which you would get from other establishments.

Not at all satisfied with the kind of food which was delivered to me. I had specially called up the restaurant and told them to add ketchup to my order but i didn't receive the same. In spite of giving clear instructions to make the crispy chilli babycorn a bit gravier, still the gravy was missing and also the babycorn was not at all crispy!! Infact the quantity of babycorn which i received was even less than half of the container!!!!! The veg fried rice was blant and not even warm. Highly disappointing as the delivery was also delayed by half n hour!! Totally unacceptable behavior by the staff when i called after delivery to share my issues, neither did they accept their mistake nor were they apologetic. Pathetic food and service!! Worst experience ever!!!!

Ordered Chilly Chicken & Mixed Hakka Chow
Price is very pocket friendly
Plus points for delivering at midnight
Coming to the food
Chow was bit bland and overboiled but with generous amounts of chicken and prawn.
Chilly Chicken gravy was thin and average tasting.
Good joint, since it's a midnight delivery place-
I'm satisfied.

This place takes the must needed care of the midnight hunger pangs for the special species of midnight owls like me.. Form pasta, pizza, chowmein, chilli chicken, brownies they have it all.. The quality of the food is nothing to boast of but decent enough and especially given the price point and the hour of the service I bet it would be hard to find another joint service the same.. I would have given 4.0 but the fact that they makes you believe that they're giving 15% discount and then charge a 10% delivery charge on the total amount made me deduct 0.5.. Order from here if you want savoury food for your midnight cravings..

It's one of those rare days, or rather night, when you get what you exactly want.
Ordering after a joint or two is risky. You may end up eating the wrong food, and still enjoy it. 
But my hunger pangs were satisfied after a hearty meal from Food Post at 02:00 am.
They are cashing in on Don Giovanni's absence of late at nights. 
I was craving for my go to humble Biryani, because it lets me soothen up from my CA Finals books.
But it was not there to be.
So off shifts the hunger to Chinese.
I ordered Veg Schezwan Hakka Noodles and Chilli Potato. 
And to my utter surprise after recent experiences, the food was extremely good. 
By the time it was supposed to reach me, I had already completed my meal.
The potato was properly cooked, and the noodles were thick and spicy, while they were hot.
Cheers to the delivery man, who braved the neighborhood dogs. 
Their executive kept his promise of amazing food and timely delivery. 
Ps: Please provide a fork next time.
Pps: More gravy in manchurian or potato.
Ppps: Please continue to stay open at nights.
Pppps: Repeat order very soon.

People say first impression is not the last impression , 😀😀😀, well in this case it's absolutely opposite in every way ,first n foremost the 60min time is i think just there coz of the yummylious food that is delivered shld be yummylious also or stay yummylious ,after a really long time a restaurant has actually reached a mark where i would definitely say is there an option for more than 5 .0 , o would highly recommend the chicken Kassa combo and u do not worry incase the beverage is forgotten in between ( that's if u choose the one with the beverage) they wld definitely Deliver it to u ,one of the most humble person to talk with (forgot to ask the name ) , this place is a complete treat for Indian yummylious dishes  a must try would be the Chinese combos , tho for people who can't eat a bit spicy food i would not recommend the chicken Kassa but again u can have a word with the staff n get it made as per your liking ..... Am sure , i wish the very best to FOODPOST ,all the best for the times to come and keep serving such yummylious food , btw the service is a complet delight ,one of the best services ever ... Superb service I can say .....

Ordered yesterday for the 2nd time hoping to be good, yet the food again disappointed me . Placed the order at around 3am and delivery was super quick and was delivered within 30min, ordered chicken hakka noodles and frankly speaking it was one of the worst noodles ever I had. It Was completely blant in taste and noodles was over boiled n soggy.
Overall avoid this place if u don't wanna spoil ut midnight cravings.

Firstly I came to know about his place from zomato itself but I called and ordered because I wanted to specially instruct the executive to not ring the door bell as it was around 1AM.
I ordered for a mac n cheese n vanilla shake.To my surprise the bill was 275 where as it was 250 when i had added the same items to my cart in zomato. The 25 rupees extra charge was a delivery change,basically a simple way to dupe a customer who is calling you,you can't dupe the ones ordering on zomato as you've collaborated with zomato for online orders yourself.
Secondly the vanilla shake was horrible and indebile.it tasted like stale milk mixed with water and had a soury taste with no essence of vanilla whatsover! 
The mac n cheese was just EDIBLE and nothing off the hook.
Also, the delivery executive did not get change of Rs.300 which is ridiculous! you expect me to give you exact change at 1am at night? Wow 💯💯

Was back in the city a couple of weeks back, on a late night flight. By the time I arrived the city of joy was in deep slumber. On the cab ride home I started looking out the window for any eatery. And then stumbled upon this joint on Zomato. Ordered for a grilled mayo chicken and an oreo shake. These guys prompt at the service, delivering the food at 2am just when I had reached home. They also did put a brilliant note with the package welcoming me back to the city (told em i was coming from the airport). Coming to the food, it was brilliant. The sandwich delicious and the shake went well with it. Thank you again FoodPost team, if it werent for you guys I wouldda gone hungry that night. Keep up the good work

I ordered for matar paneer, tadka dal and roomali roti and I kid you not I did not expect the food to be that delicious. I did not care about the taste of the food because I was ordering at 1 AM and I have never had great food which is ordered at that time. But, to my utter surprise food post shocked me with great food at a great price with a personalized note. Great job Food Post. Looking forward to ordering again from you.

I must say the delivery which they provide at such late hours at night when most of the restaurants do not even accept orders is wonderful and commendable..  Kudos..  The food served is good and tasty.. But it did taste a bit extra spicy..  All in all it was a good treat the tastebuds..

Came across this late night delivery place, while ordering food on Zomato. The menu looked promising and prices were on the friendlier side. I ordered one loaded nachos & some hot and sour soup to go with it. The order reached 30 mins later with a small thoughtful note from the FoodPost team. Coming to the food, I was surprised by the quality & taste of the nachos, it was fresh & flavourful, even though I thought it will become soggy by the time it reached me. The soup was a saviour in this cold. :) Overall a great experience with food & service. A definite try for all hungry night owls! 

p.s. thank you for the complimentary wai wai :)

Felt like having a late night snack. And Zomato threw their name up at me. Scrolled through their menu and ordered a chicken cheese grilled sandwich. 
Was not disappointed. The sandwich was cheesy - just the way i like. And wasn't soggy either. 
Though it could have been grilled and charred a little more to make it extra crispy. Also, the chicken's taste felt a little odd.
Nevertheless, a good experience overall. And i appreciated the complimentary muffin and handwritten note. That was a sweet gesture guys. Brownie points well earned.

I ordered fried rice and chicken the quality of food especially fried rice was horrible I mean you can get a better quality from any road side stall. Chicken was ok though I ordered the food but they failed to deliver it within proper time but they offer awesome hospitality which I personally felt really good and they also apologised via a piece of paper which was attached with the food which I really appreciated kudos to you and your hospitality but please try to make quality food that's the only reason you're lagging behind . I'm rating them 3 only for their hospitality quality of the food is not even worthy of getting a rating of 1.

#grilled chicken mayo sandwich by FoodPost. Really the small gesture written on the tissue being the first time customer is really appreciable. They not only mean business but welcoming guests as well. Also the sandwich is good with the homely touch. Kudos to the new joint. Thanks for the freebie as well fellows. Surely drop in or make my hunger go off to sleep with your food in the near future as well. Touched..😋
