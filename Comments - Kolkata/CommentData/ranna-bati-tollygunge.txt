Rannabati has the most authentic bengali cuisine in Kolkata. Starting from :
Pulao, 
Chicken Kosha 
Chingri macher malai curry, 
Doi maach, 
Mutton Kosha,
Fish Fry,
Bhetki Paturi.. 
to chutney,.... all items are finger licking good.
Special recommendation for Mutton kosha, the quality is so good it almost melted in my mouth, and the taste is out of the world. Although I'm not a mutton fan but after having this i would like to change my taste ;)

All the best to Rannabati team.Its going to be one of the top takeaways in town.

So on a chilly winter afternoon, we decided to order some authentic Bengali cuisine from this joint called Ranna Bati.. Our orders were:
1. Basmati Rice
2. Chholar Daal- My favorite:that perfect daal with a tinge of sweetness and coconut chips.
3. Alu Dom- Baby potatoes cooked in rich red gravy was tasty.
4. Lonka Bhapa Murgi- Chicken flavoured with green chillies in green gravy, tasted decent.
5. Murgir Lal Jhol- It had 4 pieces of chicken and tasted good but the gravy was extremely oily.
6. Kosha Mangsho- Bestseller. It was extremely delicious to say the least with soft succulent pieces of flavorful mutton. 
RANNA BATI is a good option if you like to have some good Bengali food on a day when cooking isn't your cup of tea. The food was really worth the money, and I would definitely order more in times to come.

Extremely disappointed with the quality. Ordered online for the first time, it was late and most of the restraunts were not accepting orders, so i had to go with this one despite the ratings were just about average and rightly so. I wanted to try something from bengali cuisine, so ordered Kosha Murgi, Roti and Payesh to go with it. To my dismay, i found hair in the chicken as well as in the Payesh. Can't say much about the taste though as the presence of hair completely spoiled everything for me. One star only for delievering on time.

Ordered for the first time with high hopes.The food quality is fine and the quantity is also satisfactory but it is the taste which has a large scope for improvement..had ordered potoler dolma and basanti along with other dishes but these two definitely need improvement as they are my favorite and I can tell they weren't up to the mark.

Extremely poor service. I had ordered my food at 12:05 p.m. It was 3:30 p.m., yet the food wasn't delivered. I called the delivery boy who was extremely uncooperative and was not interested to deliver the food. I called the restraunt, they did try to cooperate although they hardly had any information about their executives. I can guess the food quality from their service. Hence, it was an extremely horrible experience. They deserve a zero rating.

Ordered via swiggy, bengali pulao, kancha lonka bhapa murgi , tekona parota and kasha murgi.
Quality and quantity wise those are not justifying the price tag. Need more improvement on their food quality at least.

A fantasy experience today eating a beautiful bengali dinner from Ranna bati. My friend from office gave us a great surprise bringing haansher dimer kosha, Lal murgir jhol, mochar paturi (trust me when I say I had no idea a simple vegetarian dish could be so tasty!). For starters we had mutton chop which was good too. Had no problem digesting the food. 
I salute to the owner, a lovely lady, who is extremely hospitable and takes personal care to help choose according to your preference. Such a personal touch is rare and much needed in our city. 
Oh I forgot to mention do try the mangshor pulao. It is yummy with succulent pieces of mutton! 
They are fairly new and need all our support to continue delivering culinary pleasure.

Only home delivery service , no seating arrangement available , oder via swiggy , compare to the price quantity was less , 

Not satisfied with the quality of fish , as they charge 230 for it , 

We oder , 1. Moong daal : regular homemade daal

                   2. Chingri malaikari : they using too much sweet like sugar in it , fish quality was fine but not happy with the price and quantity

I assume this place is a very new takeaway joint. Never visited. Only home delivery. So you can judge this place only by food quality. And the rating so high is only for that . I have ordered food from them not once but twice. Kudos to the cook. Kasha mangsho is excellent. Though the kosha chicken yesterday had no salt. Mourala bati chocheri too good. Chana paturi was best. Better than O Calcutta. Though Rs 120 is too high s price.Mangshor chop had good amount of keema and the price quite low. So was macher potoler dorma(in gravy). The jhol was too tasty. You call it gravy,rasa,salaan whatever. Need to try their different dishes like shorshe chicken or murgir muithya. And the fish dishes. Only thing I'm worried about is the hygiene. Though it's neatly packed.But they charge extra for this. A Kolkata syndrome not present in other states. And they need to redo their pricing immediately.
Some items are too cheap some are unnecessarily high priced.After all your usp is food and you can cut cost. That's why a 0.5 cut.

Pathetic food.... Just ordered few items including mutton and aaloo dum which were just low quality. The mutton tasted yuk and fully salty, and the aaloo in aaloo dum was stale. Better aaloo dum are served by roadside puchkawala.. please don't serve stale food... Food sucks... Just Dustin quality... Ordered food for the first time and definitely last time.

After reading positive reviews in Zomato, ordered Luchi, Tikona Porotha, Kosha Murgi, Haasher Deemer Dalna and Alur Dum today. I agree with the reviewers. The food was delivered promptly, it was fresh, tasty, homely and superbly prepared. I am truly satisfied and I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the owners. Please keep up the good work. I shall be ordering from you again!!

One week goes by.  I ordered once gain, but there were some issues this time. 

I am thankful that Ranna Bati contacted me and offered to make amends. This time it was Chicken Kosha, Luchi and Payesh. Good enough. Tasty, fresh and just like home-made food. So I wish them the very best in their endeavors and hope that in due course of time, they become a success in Kolkata's food scene.

The daab chingri, prawn biriyani, kosha mangsho, ilish narkol bhaat, ilish bhapa, fish fry , bhetki paturi and bhetki kalia are amazing and are a must-order. Also kancha lanka bhapa murgi needs special mention. Do order from this outlet for a superb culinary experience!

Yummy, hygienic, affordable and quintessentially Bengali food. It tastes like home made food. The quantity is also very good along with the quality. I love the daab chingri, fish orly and the chicken kosha a lot although all the items are delicious. Whenever I will want to eat or feed Bengali food it has to be from Ranna Bati

On a Sunday evening we had ordered from Ranna Bati, it was a bulk order. Each of us had ordered for different preparations, when the food got delivered we were surprised by the immaculate packaging of the food. We had ordered for:
Chingri Malai Kari
Daab Chingri
Mochar Chop
Mangshor Chop
Fish Fry
Fish Orly
Kurkure alu bhaaja
Dimer Devil
Bhaat
Pulao
Shona Muger Dal
Chholar Dal
Mochar Paturi
Niramish Potoler dolma
Doi machh
Bhetki paturi
Bhetki kalia
Kosha Mangsho
Kosha Murgi
Murgir Muitha
Khejur amshotter chutney 
Aamer chutney 
Papad

Each of the items were neatly packed and labelled. The taste of the food was mind blowing. I don't know which item to start with, the fish fry was made with absolutely fresh bhetki, the mangshor chop was melt in the mouth, the mochar chop was a revelation that veg food could be that tasty too. 
The daab chingri stole my heart, served in a whole green coconut, its creamy consistency was delectable and six pieces of tasty prawns inside. 
The chingri malaikari was pretty good, as was the murgi kosha. 
The bhetki paturi was again a favourite of mine. The bhetki kalia was extremely tasty, my husband went all ga ga over it. 
The murgir muitha was a new culinary experience for me, it was a new item which stood out. It had a fresh taste, with coriander as the base of the dish, the chicken muitha balls were soft and juicy. 
That was a long list and yes we tasted and ate it all. Absolutely finger licking good food. I will definitely give it extremely good reviews. Bengali food at its best.
