I loved the Hakka egg chowmin and the hot garlic chicken. I also ordered a veg fried rice though I didn't like the fried rice. The chicken reshmi kebab is a must buy. This is my favourite.

This place is located on Chowringhee road between Maidan Metro and RabindraSadan. Although not a huge fan, I have been a frequent visitor of this place since I sometimes stay in the Choudhury estates guest house situated just behind this place. As far as the food is concerned, it’s ordinary.

It is not bad by any stretch of the imagination but its not a place that I would solely go for the food. The ambience and décor is top notch though but the food is a little on the expensive side due to its premium location. I usually order their Indian Food since that is what they specialize in. The service is quick and extremely courteous.

A great restaurant to visit with your family and close ones. The decor and ambience will make u feel like a Maharaja indeed and the staffs are courteous also. Located at a very posh area and frequented by foreign tourists this place is a great joint in the heart of Kolkata. We ordered Chicken Hariyali Kebab and Maharaja Special Fish Kebab which were both good and nicely presented. But the main course Chicken Kagani with Naan was not upto our expectations. Tutti Fruti at the end as a desert is a must try. Visit this restaurant and feel like a Maharaja. Cheers!!!!

Maharaja is one of the classic resturants which has been around for a significant amount of time and has managed to keep up their standard of food amd service. I prefer the Indian and Mughlai dishes here more than the Chinese. The thing which stands out about their biriyani is that, they serve tender boneless pieces of mutton in the mutton biriyani. Chicken Kagani goes well with it. The interior has a lush and fancy look. Service is prompt and efficient.

Very nice place I must say. Perfect for a romantic couple. Quite elegant and classic feel, you can even find an indoor fountain. Service is also very nice.

If we talk about food, it is good. I ordered kasturi kebab as starter, mixed Hakka noodle and shezwan fish. The Kebab was good but nothing special. Shezwan Fish was really nice and it was not very hot which I liked. Disappointment was the Noodle. Quite tasteless as if there was no seasoning. Flavour was also quite faded. Still a nice experience and would like to visit again.

This is in the Chowringhee Court building. Ground floor, impossible to miss.
Beautiful interiors. "Palatial" is what they were going for, and that's what they've done.

Went there for lunch.
We ordered Chicken Reshmi kebab for starters. Slightly more fibrous than those you get at Arsalan and Aminia, but very tasty nevertheless.

For mains, had butter naan and a gravy dish with baby corn and mushrooms. It was delicious. I'm not much for vegetarian food, but this was so good.

They do have some problem with the handheld payment terminal. Didn't work. We had to pay the bill in cash. But very courteous staff otherwise.

For this place 3.5 is enough... Though for the interior and the decor i would love to give 4.5 to this place.. i visited this place during puja this year.. it might looks a bit expensive from its outer loojs bt its not actually.. this place is actually verry poket frendly.. i visited there with my friends the prices of alcohol is bit cheaper then other restaurants which is a good thing for people like us... Bt the cocktails were very no no atleast for me.. cz i hv tsken "bloody merry" nd it was more ketchup for me... And now comes to the food those were also poket frendly bt the food quality they could have make it better... Foods were not as tasty as they should be.. and last thing was the waiter's theye more eager to go home than serve...worst part of this restaurant is the bar is open only till 10.30pm n kitchen is open only 10.45pm the people in the restaurant were literally make felk to leave the restaurant after 10.30 which is the worst thing in a restaurant... As per as poket frendly one should visit this place bt without any higher expectations...

If ur in that area try this place out and yeah u can see cricket matches or football matches if u say

Just like another date to us, however, food exploration was must. Though it was tough to find and choose any good restaurant in Exide. Nevertheless chose a grand one, Maharaja. Indeed it's in looks, ambience and food too.

We had ordered Fish banzara as starter then for main course we chose Mixed Fried rice and Beijing Lamb. Trust me quantity was humongous and quality was stupendous. 

Go for something grand guys. Maharaja.......tomare selam!

I had visited this restaurant several times before but this is my first review about the place from my last visit . We went out for a family dinner last Saturday . The interior decoration has changed abit which was quite pleasant and appealing . We ordered Queen's pride which I didn't find much appealing because it was mixture of various fruits flavours like mango , pineapple etc ( couldn't manage a picture ) and Virgin mojito ( not available in the menu card ) . For starters , Chicken kasturi kebab and fish banzara was ordered . Both were yummy . Then , my favourite prawn cocktail was served . They have changed the granishing and presentation but the taste remains the same i.e, heavenly . Next , for main course , we ordered chelo kababs , garlic naan , chicken bharta , Dal makhani and chicken steak . All of them were equally good but could manage the picture of the steak only . Tuti frutti and chocolate icecream with hot chocolate sauce was ordered for dessert . The chocolate icecream was just out of the world . All the dishes were worth of money . The staffs were polite and quick in their services. Will surely come back to check out more from the menu they offer .

My friend and I went to Maharaja Bar and Restaurant on June 8, 2017. The food was a complete disaster.
The kebabs were recommended by a friend so we tried the kebabs. The Mutton seekh kebab was dry, over done and tasteless, the full tandoori chicken was  flavourless and dry and I presume it was precooked and just reheated before service. The order taker recommended the bhetki Fish ajwaini which was a complete disaster, under cooked and again completely flavourless.
For mains we ordered laccha parantha and Mutton Kassa, the mutton was too tough to chew and we had to leave the meat. It was not edible, definitely not the right quality of meat for mutton Kassa. The parantha was OK.
If you are looking for a good food experience I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.

My hubby remembered being a regular visitor to this place few years ago n remembered loving their north Indian food. So i was quite excited to visit this place. When i entered the restaurant, i was quite impressed with the decor.
But the food was a letdown. We had ordered vegetable tetrazini which was decent. For main course we ordered kadhai paneer, daal makhni n butter naan. The main course was a big disappointment. Paneer had too much of haldi in it n not spicy at all. Daal was bland. 
Drinks were decently priced. Infact cheaper than most cafes
The crowd mostly consisted of old people, probably coming there after office hours, to have some drinks.
 
 Disappointed!

While looking for a proper restaurant near rabindrasadan, I came across this joint. By the look and feel of this place, it has a royal Ambience and an awesome decor, which gives the restaurant a rich look as it's name suggests. 
Pocket pinch I suppose is quite ok compared to other fine dines, the staff was courteous and well behaved.
Coming to food, we ordered chicken tandoori, chicken stroganoff, crispy fish, cold coffee and lime soda. The taste was very good and it lived upto my expectations. Thumbs up.

2. Fish finger with chips~ Very good...
3. Chicken stroganoff~ Excellent...

5. Chicken steak~ It was good... But it was bit salty...
6. Butter nan~ Very soft and tasty...
7. Chicken bharta~ Good... Needs a bit improvement...
7. Gulab jamun~ Very good...
8. Vanilla ice cream~ Good one...
So overall a very good place... Everyone can give it a try... Pocket pinch was quite acceptable...

Perfect place for a Maharaja style meal. The place looks royal in style. The sofas table and chair looks great and highly comforting.
Food is excellent here. We had from their Continental menu. Firstly started with a cocktail Screwdriver, they didn't have most of the item listed on the drinks menu in stock. Screwdriver was average in taste.
Came the foods next. Fish Ala Maharaja was excellent, the bhetki was so well made into a continental dish.
Chicken Tatrazina was also very good.
We also tried from their North Indian menu it was also very good.
Gulabjamun in desserts was totally a marvel.
Service was good.
Pocket pinch but high.

The Restaurant truly lives up to its name.Grandeur is the thing that I have to say when I sit down to describe this place.It scores in almost all departments.The decor,ambience,service is pretty good.Even the washrooms are pristine clean.The food quality and quantity both are pretty good.However the soup that I ordered was not up to it.I mean I have had better.Other than this,everything was great. Kudos!

Maharaja, as the name suggests is a grand place with a good range of food at affordable prices.
The restaurant has a bar which features limited range of cocktails and a wide range of hard drinks and mocktails.
The place has quality food, staff that are on their toes, ready to serve. We ordered their Chicken Biriyani, Stir Fried Chicken Noodles and Bloody Mary, all of which more or less tasted good. Keep up the great work!

With all the factors adding up with the luxurious setting it is definitely a place to go and grab some food.

I had passed by this restaurant many times but never tried to get in. Yesterday, due to hunger, I went in there.

I was floored by the ambience. It has been decorated like Lake View Palace. I looked around myself in awe. The manager showed me a fountain that is being installed. Can't wait to visit this place after it is installed.

I was greeted by Niladri, a very friendly staff. After going through the menu and after discussing with him, I chose fish ajwain kebab and chicken Kasturi kebab.

The food arrived in no time. Both the kebabs were good enough and had the melt in the mouth quality. I was very satisfied. The staff, especially the manager - a person hailing from Andhra Pradesh - is very courteous and friendly.

The price is a bit steep.

The lighting is perfect.

No problem with car parking as there is fee parking outside.

Would like to visit this place, but wearing regal clothes, suitable for the ambience.

Right from the entrance of this restaurant I was awestruck! Mesmerised by the wooden decoration and the furnitures we were completely in loss of words. The waiters and the managers helped us to get seated. So well behaved they were...
Coming to the menu, it was priced as any restaurant in park Street area. We ordered chicken lababdar and butter naan. And when the food arived...it tasted just yum!  Need I say more? Just try it out and I'm sure you all gonna love it.

Went for dinner on a Sunday evening with two other couples. One of these was vegetarian. The were visiting Calcutta for a wedding and had their fill of Indian cuisine.
The Continental vegetarian fare served was much appreciated.
Otherwise we had starters and the usual Indian fare. Quite nice but the great service made this a memorable experience.
Will certainly be back

Vistited this royal dinning place today for the first time to try out some light evening snacks - located just opposite to Nehru Children's Museum. Awesome ambience that reflects the Maharaja style dinning experience in terms of the decors - both furnitures and furnishings. Ordered Pinacolda - tasted good, cream of chicken soup - was just okish, Royal special fish kebab which was very yummy. I would recommend kebab lovers to try their fish kebab which was perfectly blended with right amount of spices. Service is instant and the staffs are very friendly.

The kebab was perfectly made..melts in mouth..butter nan and paneer butter masala were good to taste..I though found the briyani a bit dry..
The bill was around 1160 bucks!! Yeah its a bit heavy on pocket but the ambience and food makes fr it..

Located just a few minutes from the exude branch of Haldiram's. It's a very well lighted one which stands out perfectly with its own marked sophistication. As the name suggests it's really grand. 

I'm more of a non vegan person. And cheese perfectly fits into everything I like yo gulp down. We had an awesome experience here. The prawns were so perfectly cooked. They were moist and oozing with flavours. Then there was some cheese crusted item. It was my personal favourite. I kept on taking that! 


The staff were good. Ambiance was nice. Nice experience we had.

For my mom's birthday we were looking for a good restaurant. What we find is unbelievable. Maharaja will make you feel like a maharaja. The ambience is awesome. The staffs are well mannered and IT HAS A FREE WIFI also. Now the major part, food. We had fish makhmali (fish was indeed like makhmal, a bit salt less) chiken irani tikka (melting in mouths like butter, awesome taste) Lahori gosht pulao (every pieces of muttons are soft, nicely cooked and supreme tasty. But it is not the conventional biriyani.), mutton kasha (awesomely tasty, super soft, authentic taste), butter nun (yummilicious). Again and again we will surely return to maharaja. The restaurant is so special. Thank you for everything.

On a Monday afternoon me and couple of friends decide to visit this place for a late lunch. The restaurant oozes nostalgia and has been standing strong chowringhee for all these years competing with the newbies. When we entered the place it was absolutely empty. It's a brightly lit restaurant with comfortable seats and well spaced. The waiters are courteous, well informed and helpful. Immediately after stepping foot we were escorted to a table. Coming to the food: we had orderd a kebab platter for starters comprising of fish, chicken and mutton kebab. The kebabs were soft and would melt in the mouth. For main course we had ordered garlic naan, cheese naan, chello kebab, mutton rogan josh  and paneer pasinda. All the dishes tasted brilliant, however I'd specially single out the mutton. It was fabbbb! For dessert we ordered caramel custard and ice cream emperor ( a maharaja special ). We had alcohol as well. The service was prompt and the staff was extremely attentive. Price wise it's quite reasonable and not unbelievably taxed either. Special mention: Alcohol price is very very reasonable. ( signature 30 ml for 120 bucks!!) Overall a happy experience 😊
A couple of suggestions:
1. The door to the ladies washroom can't be locked. Fix that asap. 
2. The music

Maharaja was my first food experience in Kolkata and surely Kolkata didn't disappoint me. The food was good even though the he service was really slow. The staff was very courteous and the interiors reminded me of Gulatis back in Delhi. We had ordered mattar paneer, dal tadka, baked paalak paneer, laccha parantha and garlic naan. Garlic naan really stood out while dal tadka was average. The rest of the things were good. Then I had Puri chole in the breakfast which was absolutely bland. So I would want to discard that experience. In all you select and order this place can offer good food.

Few hours ago we visited at maharaja resturant for the first time near rabindra sadan metro station. Just checking zomato we found it. The ambience and decorations were classy. Hospitality was good enough. Though we had to wait 30minutes for our foods as it was not the time for indian dishes. But, the food quality and quantity pleased us. We ordered 2 coctails-screwdriver (it was orangish tasty). It was given with salted nuts. Then we ordered chelo kabab. It was just yummy. And then tandoori roti with chicken-la-zabab. It was also good. Almost our experience was nice.

This restaurant was deserted when we reached there. The interiors looked posh and well maintained. We were a bit skeptical about what to expect from this restaurant at first. 
 When the food came everything else was forgotten. It was just too good. The mutton pulao ( it was called something else which I don't remember exactly ) was simply out for this world. The roti and the palak paneer was  also awesome. The service was also pretty good. The prices were lower than we expected .So overall a wonderful experience.

The sizzler was cooked well, but the fish used was not fresh. Chopsuey had more tomato than anything and it almost made it absolutely sour.
The ambience and interiors are beautiful, but nothing extravagant apart from that. It was a turn off for me.

I have seen this restaurant for many years, but never heard from anybody about the food and this pls e was never recommended to me by anyone ever. The restaurant even has free parking within the premises with is a great convenience these days. Went there for dinner with friends some time back. We had a couple of starters, beer and a small dinner. All veg. The restaurant does not stock much variety in beer, which I find lacking in a lot of Kolkata restaurants. However, the service was good, and the food- crispy chilli baby corn, tandoori paneer, dal makhni were all pretty good. The ambience was nice family type, although it was practically pretty empty with just 2-3 tables occupied, that too on a Friday. Overall, a nice experience and I wonder, why nobody goes there.

As recommended by a friend, Maharaja was a great place for good North Indian food. Warm ambience and less crowded on a Saturday evening, gave me a good first impression. A special mention for their mutton biryani which was delectable. Very flavoursome and tender juicy succulent boneless pieces of mutton quite a rarity in Kolkata. The quantity is also good and value for money. Definitely this place calls for a repeated visit.

A vegetarian restaurant bang near the Exide crossing, this restaurant is very well located. It is a traditional North Indian restaurant with a well stocked bar. We started with mocktails. We had ordered Queen's Pride and Pinacolada, both were very tasty. In the starters we ordered traditional North Indian fare. Maharaja Kebab Platter. We followed it with Fried rice and Awadhi Jhinga curry. We found the food tasty and the service efficient. Although the decor was nice, it was nothing awesome. But we liked the food, and that is the main thing I guess.

Very spacious, decor and ambiance is fine, staffs are polite but service is not upto the mark, they took awful lot of time to serve the food . we ordered maharaja kabab platter but the quality of kababs were not so impressive. for main course we ordered kabuli naan, fish kolhapuri and murg lajawab. naan were excellent but fish kolhapuri was bad, not even close to the authentic kolhapuri dish, murg lajawab was decent. total cost for 3 was around 2400, not very expensive but when compared to the quality of food they served its can be called little overpriced! overall average experience.

Maharaja is a North Indian restaurant located beside Haldiram very close to Exide crossing. We went their with 20 other people sort of for  a corporate get together. Ambience is very ordinary. Interiors and decor are ok. We ordered some soup, paneer tikka and main course. Paneer tikka was a little bland. Dal and rice were very ordinary like any other North Indian restaurant. Rotis were warm and crispy. Gulab jamuns for dessert were the best - warm and soft. Service is good. Overall a decent place and worth the money. Nothing very special...

The hotel is situated in heart of the city and has its own free parking inside.
Interiors are ok types nothing so special.
Staff or attendents are ok nothing again great about it.
Now food kababs or tikka are disappointing even chinese starters like babycorn too spicy some mughlai dishes are tasteless or even spiceless and some to much spicy.
Main thing about it is main course items like bharta yum yum one of the best made in town i suppose even other main course gravy dishes in same column they are worth to try for.
Lacha paratha are something new and yum yum must try.
This restaurant if you step in only try main course dishes no starters or any other side dishes.
It is expensive so do keep in mind when ordering.
I do recommend this with family friends with any champion do try this.

I have been here so many times I've lost count. Their spread goes from khandani Indian to Chinese and Continental, and their cooking is consistently good. Since the place sits right next to my workplace at SSKM Hospital, it's a nice cosy place for us to go after work with a group of pals for a meal and a drink.
The staff have always been polite and friendly, even more so because we're regulars, perhaps. And the prices are pretty competitive too.
Highly recommended!
(Try their version of a long island iced tea.)

The ambince though not abosolutely remarkable,yet soothing and clean.The service was promt as in our case.We had gone there on my husband's birthday.The tandoori chicken was okay,though we liked the black daal and kulcha .The biriyani could have been much better and needs improvement (compaired to the biriyani joints in the city).The chicken lababdar was good with soft and juicy chicken pieces.The quantity of rice we felt was little less than compaired to other places and you dont even think of sharing a rice dish between 2 people.

The dessert choice was limited as per us!

I have been to almost most of the well known restaurants but maharaja by far is my favourite. Excellent service, exceptional food quality, huge variety of selections, very spacious! 
Must try- fish in mustard sauce, maharaja kebab platter, murgh nawabi, crispy mushroom, chicken stroganoff! 
Pros- almost everything and nice parking a big banquet hall and awesome staff!
Cons- can't think of any to be honest!

Maharaja is a unpretentious place serving pretty decent traditional Indian food. Their north Indian fare is top-notch (almost) and the ambience is pleasant and spacious. The service is slow and very old-school. However for a quick family meal, Maharaja works .

Located beside haldirams on chowringhee, maharaja restaurant has been there since long time now and has never disappointed me !!!!!! But i feel the popularity of the place is more than that being reflected here on zomato with just 11 reviews and 48 votes.

Maharaja is pretty big and spacious restaurant with its own parking area behind the restaurant. The decor is old school and meant to give a grand feel though it does not reach up to that goal and lags somewhere mid way. The seats, sofas are pretty comfortable. The staff is polite, prompt and decently mannered. 

The place serves indian, chinese, continental food and i have always preferred the indian cuisine here. The kebabs are good but not the best in my opinion and could be better. The main course dishes are the star for me here. Rotis are excellent. Black dal, kofta, paneer makhani are my favorite dishes which are very nice. Biryani is average and i would prefer peas pulao over it. Option for deserts are very limited and i would suggest them to offer a few more desserts. 

Overall the food is a delight and the ambience is nice, relaxed without that rushy feel. The prices are very decent that adds to the value for money.

The ambience is nice and quiet also very spacious.

The food is nice too. The baby corn was really good and so was the soup. 
The main course was average though.

The staffs were well mannered too and knew the menu well.
Also, the bill didn't burn a hole in our pocket too as we got 15% discount :D

yesterday went to maharaja restaurant. nice ambience with good decor and well maintained sitting arrangement. staffs are really good and proper servicing was there. i ordered chicken kasturi kebab that was well cooked and the kebab was tender and succulent. the accompaniment of kebab was also good. In main course i ordered  butter naan, murgh kagani and murgh shikampuri pulao. the food quality and quantity was good bt while eating pulao the taste was coming like i was having biryani. the dessert was also good. over all i will rate them 4/5

One of my favourite restaurants in the town. Maharaja is a good place for having chinese and indian dishes. Its having a very good ambiance and staffs are informative and courteous. Food quality is excellent and food quantity is well. I have tasted their Golden Fried Prawns, Pan Fried Chilly Fish,Murgh Hariyali Kabab and Reshmi Kabab. They are really very delicious and other dishes are mouthwatering too. For dinner i had Butter Naan and and Murgh Butter Masala. Prices are moderate and for dessert at last, i had chocolate ice-cream. I have visited there recently and last i had visited almost 2 years back. They also have sufficient space for car parking. Their sitting arrangement is fine and comfortable.One more thing, the pineapple cheese was luscious too. Not all the time it remains crowded, you do not have to wait all the time.  During Durga pujas, a programme is held in there and also sometimes during Poila Boisakh. I would definitely suggest you to taste their food and i would rate 4.5 for them.

Only the name is Maharaja in this place... all the other things are pretty ordinary. When they opened they really had the mark of an up-market restaurant. but over the years the things seem to have changed a lot.

The crockery cutlery is not that smart any more, the upholstery looks drab and dull. The food is also very average.... but i would say good value for money, as it is reasonably priced.

Parking is a perennial problem while visiting this restaurant.

Its an ideal place for having Chinese and Indian dishes. It is the ideal place for these cuisines. One of my favourite restaurants for having Indian dishes. It is having really a relaxed atmosphere and food is also delectable. Service is also agreeable. It is located in Chowringhee, just beside Haldiram. The most good thing about it is that it is having a vast parking facility. Banquet halls are also available. Its a nice place for having dinner or lunch twice a month. I really love this place and it is not at all monotonous for me. Obviously i would rate 5 stars.

I just love to go to this place. Scrumptious, delicious food is available there. Whenever I think of going out, I always choose 'MAHARAJA'. Varieties of food, drinks and kind service makes the place more good.

The  bar  menu  here  is  a  bit  too  costly for my liking but a  decent enough place in  the  heart  of  the  city  .  interior  is  very  nicely done  .  service is a bit too slow but  the  QUANTITY  of food is  good  .  however  off late  there  has been a tendancy in maharaja that  all  that you see in the menucard may not be available all the time.  plus  the menucard uploaded  here  is ancient prices have increased  to almost  double  what  you  see  in this menu  dated  2010  ( atleast it was when i wrote my review )  .  i  would  suggest  that  if you  go  to  maharaja  please  carry  atleast  3000 Rs  with you.  because  meal for two  here without alcohol will cost  you rs 1800 approx & WITH  ALCOHOL it will cost 3000 at the very least .  overall verdict  Great  ambience  ,  decent  food  but a bit on the costlier side .  i will go with a 3 star rating mainly because of the ambience which is really good .

This is great place. You get parking facility (rear-side) of the restaurant, as well as (paid) parking outside!
The food is very good too.They serve excellent Indian, Chinese & Continental food. Limited range of Continental varieties are available. The serving portions are good for 2-3 people with an average/modest diet, so if there's a big group visiting, its more economical. That's an offer one should take up every time. Garlic Naan, Daal Makhani and shabnami kofta are my favorites. The mix vegetable they prepare is also sumptuous. On the Chinese menu, hot 'n sour soup, crispy chilli babycorn and the other staples are equally good. In fact, I must say that the Chinese preparations are slightly different (in a good way) than other regular places that I go to!
Bar menu is slightly over-priced. All-in-all, one of my favourites.
I have been a regular at this place for more than 10! years now.

We recently visited Maharaja for dinner. The part about the ample car park is gratifying, given the location of the restaurant. The pricing is reasonable. The quality of the food is good. We ordered a Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Prawn Tandoori for starters followed by A Vegetable steak, Chicken Bharta and Lifafa Naan. Apart from the Bharta which I thought had an overkill of spices, I found the food quite palatable. The Lifafa naan was soft and fluffy and is recommended. It is a nice family place and the service is tolerably good.
