I have never ever had better desserts than the ones I have eaten from The Last Course. The chocolate cakes and the nutella cookies with sea salt are absolutely decadent and I really don't know when to stop once I start nibbling on them. In terms of pure quality and taste, I would rate this the best in the city! A must must have for all those who love dessert, and also for those who do not.

Bakes the yummiest cakes , awesome cookies you would want them to never get over ( the double choco chip and Nutella sea salt especially ) , the Oreo cheesecake damn good again . Definitely the best quality desserts in town . The cake decoration is always in just one word ' sweet! ' .

The Last Course is the most high-quality shop for cakes and desserts in Kolkata. The taste of chocolate and other ingredients, presentation, and the overall flavour of the final product far exceed those of other bakeries in the city. It is truly a bakery which cares about the experience of consuming the last course, as a whole. I would safely recommend this as one of the best in the country too.
