A small take away joint located in Vidyasagar bus stop in Raja SC Mullick Road. We ordered Chicken Singapore Noodles,sanghai chicken and Bangkok crispy fish through swiggy. The best part is that they serve you half the quantity of every dishes and so enough for a single person and one can also taste various dishes. The noodles was very tasty with adequate amount of chicken and so also the starters. The sanghai chicken containing roasted peanuts giving it a special flavour and aroma-really loved it. The Bangkok fish also contained tender succulent pieces of fish tossed in a red sauce. Will definitely try many more dishes in future from this joint.

An absolute delightful takeway with a range of delicacies. I had a crispy basil chicken, crispy fried squid and chicken singapuri noodles. The basil chicken was crispy succulent with a strong basil and green chilli flavour. It's a clear winner. The spicy fried squids was equally delicious with a spicy tangy flavour. As for the noodles it was delicately made with plenty of vegetables, babycorn and chicken. The dish is mild spicy and tastes good. Overall quite a good takeway option.

New veselka is takeaway food outlet serving good food at pocket friendly prices. Till date i have availed the services of the outlet via swiggy. 

The following have been tried & tasted:-

1. Chicken fried rice half - Half plate of rice had adequate amount of rice with generous portions of chicken bits & vegetables. The taste was also good with low oil content.

2. Basil chicken half - Shredded fried chicken wok tossed in basil,chillies & capsicums. The quantity for half was well good in my opinion. The dish comes in dry version & was spicy. Great dish to taste. Recommended.

3. Fish & chips - 2 fish fries with shallow fried chips. They use basa fish. The fries were uber soft & was of great quality. Mayo dip was also provided along with the dish. The chips also tasted great with chat masala sprinkled over it. Recommended dish!!

P.s. Pictures have been posted separately!!

Had ordered Chicken steak and drums of heaven. The steak turned out to be a chicken cutlet immersed in some kind of cheese sauce, not recommended. The drums of heaven was decent.

This is located opposite to the ganguly bagan big bazaar.. a small outlet beside the main road and they have no proper sitting arrangement..
Food ordered: Drums of heaven, mexican roll and mushroom with squid.. quantity was huge and taste was more than average.. pricing was too reasonable.. 
This can be a nice deal at such a low cost..

Average quality of food..tried various of their items but it tasted average..it's a small outlet on the road towards baghajatin..but despite all this it's a good place to takeaway food or cash on evening snacks..

Food is really yummy! A quite pocket friendly restaurant. A must try ðŸ˜Š I love the kind of rolls they serve. Especially the egg one, they add white sauce and serve it for 40 bucks only!
