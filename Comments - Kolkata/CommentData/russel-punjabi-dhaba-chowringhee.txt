Discovered it by accident but a positive experience....
Economical but quite good quality and taste wise....
Samosas & good old evening chai for special mention....
They could do better with their infrastructure but that doesn't take away from the locational advantage....

A decent place if you want to grab a quick bite. Typical dhaba food sans gallons of oil. We ordered plain roti, butter roti, chicken bharta, double egg tadka, masala papad, tea and lassi. Chicken bharta was sumptuous to say the least. All the other items except plain roti were quite satisfying. Roti could have been softer. USP of this place is, it is extremely pocket-friendly.

A small dhaba serving amazing food. Other than Staples like tea, coffee, lassi and samosas, their chicken preparations are also very good. Try their chicken bharta along with roti. It will fill your tummy and your heart as well.

Went here after shopping and we were not in a mood to have a sit down dinner. A group of four we parked our car and started ordering. 
1. Chicken Bharta 
2 Paneer Butter Masala
3. Dal tadka
4. Egg Bhurji 
5. Gobi paratha
6 Alu paratha 

The food is nostalgic of when i used to eat here while working in middleton street. And i remember the food tasting better. I didnot enjoy the meal. While i was eating the paratha and as i got to the middle of it the there was a lot of oil and it made me not want to continue eating and i love fried food. The portions are okayish too... 
The pocket damage was 1480 which was more than what i expected. Made me think would have rather gone to shiraaz or rang de basanti .

I stick to the basics when it comes to Russel Dhaba. They serve really good alu paratha and chicken bharta. However the cheese sandwich is dry and their tea is tad bit too sweet for the palette. I am not a fan of rose water in lassi so I find it average. 
However brownie points to the quick & super friendly service. Needless to say, its light on pockets too.

Being a true North Indian I came across this place and had to stop to gorge on to the parathas. Paneer paratha and Aloo paratha are simply wow. And to top it all Lassi in Kulhad is a perfect way to sum up a tasty lunch. Must stop for Paratha lovers travelling to Kolkata

This *dhaba* doesn't need any review as its awesomeness would anyway have and shall keep attracting people. But still I wanted to pen this down

This dhaba is located at a prime location (Russell Street) just opposite the ICAI which is also a regular and old customer of this restaurant.
Chai and Samosa toh janab inka USP hai. I'm sure that this dhaba alone caters to more than half of the people having snacks, tea and samosa anytime of the day in that area.

Here you get everything what you might expect from a regular dhaba (not the highway one). Chai, Paratha, Samosa, namkeen are the one's which people love.

You can either have it served at your car and enjoy within or sit inside dhaba (upstairs) and enjoy the meal, either way you want.

Samosa are really crispy mixed with a little blend of mint. Chai is anytime good, hot and you won't get disappointed (atleast Sharma Ji se toh thoda better hai Sardar Ji) :).

I would suggest this dhaba if you are looking for pocket friendly place at Russel St/Park St for early morning breakfast, tea or for having snacks at evening with some adda.

Rab rakha Sardar Ji.

Good luck !!

The only good thing at this restaurant is the tea, which they give too much in a cup. They owner has a very rude behavior with his staff and the customers. Food here is expensive, and the amount that they would charge for it, due to the quality you would regret paying for that kind of food. I have given 2 points only becoz of the tea .

Situated at Russel street, this dhaba is old, small but if are here to eat food then it won't let your expectations down. If you are a north Indian/Punjabi food lover then this is your place. They have a variety of parathas, served hot and fresh with butter on top of it with pickles and salad. Cleanliness is a matter here. No need to worry about low budget. This place won't cost you fortune. It will cost around 150-200 for two people. Their food is very tasty. But don't forget their kesar lassi. Staffs are less as compared to the no of customers, people also eat outside the dhaba, in their cars. This place gets crowded from evening. Go there and have their parathas, u won't get disappointed and would like to visit soon.

Russel Punjabi Dhaba is yet another living proof of the saying that "fancy bells and whistles don't make an eatery great", the quality and taste of food is a testament to the fame of Russel Dhaba. Situated at the Middleton Road end of the ever busy Russel street, the dhaba is very unassuming both from the inside and outside. The taste of the food will truly surprise you.

Featured dishes - Aloo paratha, chicken bharta, chicken do pyaaza and lassi. At Russel Dhaba, one must try chicken bharta, that will be an awesome experience for every chicken lover. Given the ambience one might say the food is pricey, but the taste compensates for the food. Aloo paratha here are one of my most favourite in Kolkata and is also recommended. 

In the evening, if someone is looking for a quick snack, Samosas here are a must try. 

Overall, Russel Dhaba serves one of the most authentic punjabi food in Kolkata, the reasons it lags from others are given the cost, poor seating arrangement and lack of AC. If those can be attended to, Russel Dhaba can become a true legendary outlet.

One fine saturday after having some beers & whiskeys we people felt very hungry at 10 pm and we were craving for some dhaba type food. Suddenly this "Russel punjabi dhaba" came in my mind. Walking down the Russel street from The Park, you will get this dhaba on your right hand side (opposite to CA institute). Atlast bumped into that place and ordered for Aloo Paratha. Oh my god, it was amazing. They offers you a homely feeling in every item they serve. Great hospitality, they served our food within 10 mins. Quality and quantity was outstanding but the prices were on higher side but worth it. I will be visiting pretty soon.

Firstly, half additional point for opening up so early in the morning. Not many places in and around the area makes desi breakfast. This place serves great parathas. The tea is also pretty good. It's a good little joint for people to catch up during the early hours of the day. Prices are in line with the quality and locality.

Once this used to be my all time favourite dhaba, though being such dirty and unhygienic...but now I have stopped visiting it and will never ever go there for sure the reason being the PATHETIC RUDE AND ROUGH BEHAVIOR of the owner, an old punjabi sardar with white beard who sits at the billing. Have never ever imagined will receive such ill treatment being one of their regular customers. Please dont visit this place unless you want to face people with full of attitude and ill treatment.

Russel Dhaba has always been my favourite spot to eat delicious food and have a good time with friends. It is always the winner when I have to choose between a five star restaurant and a comfy¬†dhaba. It is here that you get to experience homely and comfortable environment and taste the lip smacking food and the aromatic¬†chai¬†and cold lassi. It is here that you can freely order as many roti you want without caring about the bill and lick your finger afterwards. 
So wherever Hunger disturbs you and you are somewhere near Maidan metro station then do give a try. üòä

Comfort Food + Quick Delivery @ Russel Punjabi Dhaba, Kolkata‚ò∫

Once you enter the Russel Street from the Middleton Street (first left turn), the age old and popular Russel Punjabi Dhaba falls on your left, soon after you have taken the afore mentioned left turn. 

Earlier known as Bharat Hindu Hotel, this dhaba is primarily famous for it's tea, lassi and stuffed parathas, specially amongst the vegetarian population. However, it serves both veg and non veg food items.

In the past, we have visited this eatery quite a few times for a quick beverage or full meal. But, until my last week's visit, blogging about the same never occurred to my mind.

As almost always, the visit to the dhaba was impromptu, and as always, we opted for dining inside our car, rather than sitting inside the eatery. Thankfully, there was not much of a rush and all the visiting cars were comfortably parked in a row.

One of their staffs appeared immediately as we parked, took our order and reappeared within 10 minutes with our food tray, which comprised of -

- Kesar Lassi (Rs. 70/-): Served in a medium sized 'kulhar' (disposable terracotta cup) and sans any thick 'malai' or cream layer on top, this was one of the best and soothing lassis (curd based beverage) that we had tasted till date. It had a nice saffron flavor. It acted as a nice coolant in the scorching afternoon heat.

- Veg Sandwich (Rs. 30/-): Comprising of 3 soft, triangular and buttered bread slices, layered with thin slices of tomato, cucumber and some grated processed cheese, the sandwich came hygienically wrapped in a transparent cellophane paper. It was soft, filling and tasted nice.

- Dal Makhani (Rs. 120/-) and Roti (Rs. 10/-): Served in a boat shaped steel bowl, this whole black bean preparation was expectantly non spicy and well cooked. 

The fresh tandoor baked Rotis aka flour based Indian breads were uniformly cooked and promptly refilled upon askance. They tasted nice and were relatively light on the stomach.

To enhance the food taste, a complimentary side plate of onion roundels, green chillies and lime was also served alongside, which worked wonders with the simple dal-roti meal.

After consuming the meal, we honked the car horn and the serving staff appeared almost immediately with tissue papers! 

In less than half an hour, two of us had visited the eatery, consumed a comfort meal which was fresh and filling and we were lighter on the pocket by not even Rs. 400/-, that too after hansomely tipping the serving staff!

What more can a comman (wo)man ask for?

One of the most famous adda dhaba in kolkata. Situated in Kolkata, this dhaba is open mostly upto 12am, sometimes till 1am. They serve tea and other snacks for your mid night cravings. But as the days goes on, so does their quality falls. I recently visited this dhaba after months and the tea tastes like water, with less sugar.  It is tasteless. But do try out their aloo paratha, it is wonderful.

I don't remember having such a refreshing Chai in forever. I was so impressed that in 45 min I came back to the place after shopping and had another one with my friends. A week later when I was back in Kolkata I ensured that I stopped by again when I was in and around Park Street. One of the best Chai I have had. Period!

Food is good but the attitudes of the owner is pathetic..

Love the food here! The food is fresh and clean and the ambience is good. The service is fast and the food is hot and delicious. The tasty alu ka paratha with a big dollop of butter and mixed vegetable achar beside is all you need along with a bhaar of plain or kesar lassi which is a must try. Their alu and matar sabzi with fresh cooked chapattis is yumm. The chapattis are hot and keep on coming unless to say no. The sabzi is also topped with a dollop of butter which melts into the dish. The price is so affordable and its a very nice place.

This is a small yet handy dhaba for people working in and around park street and camac street. If one requires a quick grab of Punjabi dishes, this is the place to be rather than visiting the other big names in that area. Be it chicken bharta or dal tarka, all dishes taste really good. Service is also very fast. A place that I highly recommend.

This place is like a hidden gem of kolkata. A lot of people don't know about this place, those who do know how much a good place this is. As it's a dhaba it's not very decorated or ambient but the food is outstanding. 
I generally go to this place with my friends to eat the aloo paratha and the chicken bharta. They make awesome tea as well.
Overall it's a very nice place to eat. Food is excellent and quite pocket friendly.

Don't get swayed away by looking at the crowd outside this place. It lacks such quality. Located opp. my PG in kolkata,this place used to have the best Aloo parantha in that part of the city but now have degraded the quality. The dishes are overpriced and not so tasty. The place of course boasts for making the "best" tea in the area but ATS stole that from it too. "Raeeson ka adda", we used to call it. The tea,the lassi,the parantha and even the colddrinks are overpriced here. Would not recommend this place to any1.

Russel Dhaba! Heard abt this place from a long long time but it was my first time. We ordered the famed alu paratha and samosa. The alu paratha was thick with proper stuffing, served with condiments. The samosa was absolutely warm and tender. Medium spicy and excellent to eat. However, to my utter shock, I realised that each paratha cost 70 bucks. Definitely not worth that much for a roadside dhaba and the size of the dish. Samosa at 10 is still worth. The cost is too high for my liking. Milking customers bcoz of the name and location

Russell Dhaba is an old Dhaba of the city which I feel has now lost its charm, there was a time when I was younger and used to frequent this Dhaba with my parents but then we stopped, I revisited this place in December after a long, long time and was disappointed.

We ordered aloo paratha, gobi paratha and muli paratha which was mediocre at its best and was really really expensive, it definitely wasn't right for the price it was served for. Next we ordered tea, which had so much sugar in it, I felt like I got a little diabetes just by having that tea. The service was sloppy and one had to shout a million times just to grab the attention of the waiter. There are other dhabas which provide better service and from now on those dhabas will be my choice.

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

The one dish that is going to take me back and back again is their CHICKEN BHARTA . The shreaded chicken is cooked in a mild creamy flavourful gravy , the cream to butter ratio makes a miracle, one has to go crazy savouring their bharta with some hot and soft rotis. Also the ALOO PARATHA that i had with a butter cube on top and a side pickle has to be one of my all time favourite breakfast. Prices are decent. Don't expect any ambience in this dhaba. Go sit , eat and relish!
Thanks to

Location: 
Walking from the park hotel,  walk towards russell street you will the dhaba at the wnd of russell street.  

If you are a dhaba food and culture lover the place is for you.  
Dont expect hygienic and clean interiors.  But the taste is guaranteed to be yummy.  

Food : 
 Chicken Bharta with Roti -  
The chicken bharta is very very delicious and is absolutely Creamy and buttery.  
It may not be very appealing but go fot the taste because its Yum-Yum.  
Roti -  Plain Tawa roti.  You wont get nan or Tandoori rori here.  

Aloo Paratha. -  
A fat piece of Paratha served with a portion of butter and achar.  It was very tastefull.  
Recommended * 

Also the cutting chai and samosa is very inviting and well known.  


The place is not very Hygienic so i cant assure you about the clean and clear Ambience.  
But the Food and the taste is a big YES .

This has a very good location that attracts a busy crowd. I have tried their tea many times along with hot Samosa. They even serve various lunch dishes out of which I've tried their Paneer Parantha, Gobi Parantha and Fried Chicken. Though their portions are standard but they charge quite a lot more.

Location- As the name suggests, this dhaba is located in Russel street.

This place is great for good after alot of drinks. Extremely pocket friendly, this place has the added advantage of serving food to you in your car itself.
Hygiene shouldn't be expected in dhabas but yummy food is a guarantee.

Food - I would definitely recommend the Chicken Bharta and the paranthas here! It is a must have !
For the vegetarians , the mixed vegetable and aloo matar is recommended.
For breakfast, The omelette and tea is a big yes!
Do visit.

We had gone for dinner @ russel punjabi dhab, opp. CA institute. Ordered paratha, roti, dal tadka & paneer do pyaza. Paneer do pyaza came as paneer butter masala & absolutely cold and when we complained of it to the waiter, i was given a blunt answer " upar se pyaaz marr denge aur kya" when i said i want paneer do pyaza, he went and got it after 5 mins.

He came with the roti & didn get any plate to eat, when again i reminded of the plate, he said " laa tou rahe hai"..
Next he came with the paratha(repeat order) it was loaded with oil which would be enough to cook about 2-3 parathas, still we didn complain.
Now, when we called for the bill, he just came & said the amount. When we asked for the bill, he said cash counter pe pooch lijiye humko nai pata. 
My husband went to the cash counter to ask for the bill, which the sardarji didn give. When forced to give he started giving all sorts of filthy answers" khud jodd lijiye, pata tou hai nai kya kya khaya hai, sabzi ko 3 baar return kiya pata nai inko kya khana hai, waiter se poochiye kya kya khaye hai aur jodd lijiye, agely baar aayie tab apko khilate hai". My husband was talking to him addressing him as uncleji & he was talking to him as if we ate without paying.When asked the waiter what all did we eat, he just started roaming & looking here n there.

Dont i deserve the right to ask for the bill for which i have paid for. The details is absolutely my right which sardarjee didnt give us till the end. They dont have any option of paytm or card. Government is asking to go cashless and here they are still stuck with just cash.

My only question is, were we wrong to ask for the bill? Plus, he said to add 10rs with the price of all the items called for.. a 4inch papad that too not roasted properly for 20rs.. a butter fulka for rs30 and then so much attitude of the owner & the waiter. 

I have not seen such kind of behavior in any other other dhaba in kolkata.. where we dont get the bill when asked & they cite all sorts of excuses.

Very unpleasant experience for the first time in any dhaba!!!

Would frequent this place while I used to be in school. Located near to the Maidan Metro.
The place is a little shabby though.
Their samosa with chutney and the chai are something we used to crave for in those days. 
Haven't really opted for food.
Prices are quite reasonable.

The place is great for the crowd who prefers quick bites on the go... The famous tea of this place is a must try for everyone cause they really make amazing tea. Opened till late night , lunch n dinners both are served . However the place does not have proper sitting arrangements but still thumbs up goes for this place because of the food quality . Price is bit on the higher side for mediocre families..

A very small restaurant with people eating in their cars and take aways. The place has a small staircase to climb on a floor above with 5 ft roof space. But the food items with reasonable pricing makes its a hot place for food lovers. The aloo or gobi paratha with chicken bharta is a common item I order when I am here.

We call this ponchur dhaba I am guessing because many moons ago there was a server called ponchu here. The chicken bharta here is the best amongst all the dhaba in the city bit no fancy naan bread here
. Just plain butter Roti's or an amazing alu paratha and that's it.

This place is famous for the Chicken Bharta, Alu Paratha, Tea and the Samosas. We are not a big fan of the type of tea served here, so never tried it. But if you love sweet and milky tea, I think, they would not disappoint you. 

We visit this place when we want good alu parathas. The thick potato filling and the butter cube served with it is awesome. The prices are on the higher side though. The Gobi paratha is also good, but nowhere near the alu one. 

Chicken bharta is another dish this place is famous for. The bharta here is totally different from those served in other restaurants. It is lot more creamier and rich. I personally ask them to add few chopped chillies along with it, as it is a tad sweet for my taste. But after adding the chillies it becomes divine. A must try item if you are here.

The place is hot and the environment is of a pice hotel. So, not recommended for family dinner. If you have a car you can park in front of the eatery and they will serve you there. 

The only problem I faced here is the billing. Each and every time I visited the place (and ordered multiple items) they tried to overcharge me. If the bill is 200 they would ask for 240, if it is 350 they will make it 410. Last time I visited they made the total from 620 to 870. As they do not provide even hand written bills, it is easier to con people like this. So always calculate the total seeing the menu card before paying what they ask for. Also they try to overcharge the packing containers. The smallest container they charged 15 bucks once (even the big AC restaurants charge 10 for them and the small eateries 5). The positive is if you challenge the total amount they would correct it and won't argue.¬† So if you keep this one thing in mind, this is a great place for some alu paratha and chicken bharta.

Really don't why there is so much hype about this food stall. I will call it a food stall and not a restaurant !!!
Aloo paratha 70 rupees!!!! So costly. Taste ok but does not deserve so high cost.

There is hygiene at all.

A zomato board is hung as if a certificate of excellence ever received by anyone.

Waiters are arrogant. 

Should avoid this place for high cost, low value for money , hygiene and arrogance.

Very few would be there who doesn't know about russel punjabi dhaba.Though its a very old and renowned dhaba but don't expect hygiene and cleanliness from this place.Its a two floored dhaba with very low ceiling on the 1st floor so "MIND YOUR HEAD".Along with dine-in facility on the two floors they also provide you food in your car which you can park in front of the dhaba.

Service-Inspite of such a heavy crowd the service at this place was extremely fast and reliable.And you will also find the staff in such a hurry that they bring "Rotis" in their hand instead of a plate.üòÇüòÇ

Ambiance-Nothing much to talk about it as we mostly had our food in the car.

Food-The food at this place is worth having.The parantha and kali daal that they serve is unmatchable and the price point at which they serve is extremely pocket friendly.We always had-
1:Kesaria Tea
2:Lassi
3:Aloo parantha
4:Maa ki dal
5:kadhai paneer

All the dishes are a must try and has a authentic punjabi flavour.

Service-4/5
Ambiance-3/5
Food-4.5/5

If someone is still left to try the food at this place than you are missing something really goodüòÉüòÉ

Seems like even the owner sitting there only want money and no credibility!! The waiter on purpose threw a whole hot boling cup of tea on my father when we only requested him to serve the tea to the person sitting behind from that window itself, the man got so furious at that request that when we then said that we dont want this service from them and do not want to drink tea there, he came to the other side and reacted in such an astonishgly ghastly way!! The owner sitting there supported the nuisance by his staff there and took the money for the tea from us which we did not have any problem in giving. But its sad to see such arrogance in such an old place. I am highing disgusted and seriously this place is not even worth giving a 1 rating!

Situated near ICAI Bhawan at russel street. Very famous tea outlet always crowded with people's and they manage the crowd very well. Ambience was good and hospitality was above average. Quick service and good presentation. Staff was friendly most of the time but sometimes when they overcrowded they started irritating. Price was bit high of some dishes but mostly i found it reasonable. Today I tried their lassi which was good as always and so as their samosa which I tried with it and I also tried their vada paw which was average. A must try place. Recommended for Tea and lassi

If you live in Calcutta and haven't ever had the Aloo Paratha at Russel Punjabi Dhaba, then we are judging you and how!üòÖ This road side oldie (Estd.1950) is one of the many gems of our City. A humble Dhaba, with the oldest of uncomfortable furnitures and a hot and humid ambience (courtesy, all that cooking taking place right next to the sitting area and no Air Conditioner), but a huge huge heart that wants to keep feeding you, like all Punjabis. We order for our favourite Aloo Paratha, doused in dollops of butter, deep fried in oil, with a crispy outer layer and the yummiest Aloo filling ever!‚ù§Ô∏è They serve it with a ready-made Pickle and one Paratha is enough to make your tummy happy, although if you have an appetite like us, you would go for a second helping.ü§ì Their famous Masala Kulhad Chai goes well with the Paratha. On a nice rainy evening or winter morning, Russel Dhaba is our favorite place for a quick snack. Also, if you are a party animal and have just come out of Roxy after a mad dancing session and are looking for a cheap eatery to re-fuel, then Russel Dhaba comes to your tummy's rescue (been there, done that).

I walked down from Park Street to the dhaba after dinner and the walk was well worth it. Russell Dhaba serves the most amazing kulhad chai! It has the most authentic flavour and you can't have just one. I couldn't try out any food there, but they get full marks for the tea.

Location: The street exactly opposite of The Park( Russel street ) .Walk down that road almost till the end when you'll find this dhaba to your right!

Well, if you love dhaba culture thus restaurant is for you. Don't expect clean, shiny interiors, don't expect well trained well dressed waiters. When you ask for another set of 'roti' , don't expect the rotis to be served on a plate. Rather the Boy will come with the rotis in his hand and give it to you.

This dhaba has a ground floor and a first floor. The first floor has an incredibly low ceiling. And at 6.2" , I really struggled. But, people usually park their cars outside and they'll serve you starlight inside your car.

Food ordered :

‚Ä¢ Chicken Bharta with plain roti :

 This is a speciality here. I have not tasted any other bharta which is so creamy, so buttery and so delicious ever. The look and color of the dish might not appeal to you but once u dunk the roti and put it in your mouth, you'll know what I am talking about. The bharta has such a lot of ghee, cream and butter in it that you won't need butter roti.

Also, you don't get tandoori roti or naan here. The plain tawa rotis are good enough.

‚Ä¢ Aloo Paratha:

A big,fat single piece of aloo paratha was served with a huge dollop of original Amul butter and achar. It was so sooo yum. Definitely recommended.

Our bill came to a meagre ‚Çπ300.

Their specialities also include their tea, egg tarka and mixed veg.

No I cant assure you about the health quotient of the food, neither can I assure you about the hygiene of this place.

But what I do can assure you is the food will leave a smile on your face. Lots of ghee, lots of butter and lots of love goes in the cooking and it left me wanting for more. I'll surely be back!

Every time a want a little reminder of North India in the city - this is my go to. Start off with tea (Hot day? The Lassi is a good pick too) and their snacks (let go of your calorie count for the day), and move on to the cliche dhaba-main course. Parathas are a must try!

Well who dosent know of Russell Punjabi Dhaba or Russell dhaba as we all fondly call it. One of the oldest dhabas in the city, this one is located just near the corner or Russell street and Middleton street. 
I have always ordered food from the car when here. I think I may have visited this place over a 100 times since I was much much younger. 
The tea here is gold! Try the kesaria chain and I am sure you will fall in love with just the tea!
The snacks here are also good. However the dhaba food here is a standout.
Rumali Roti's with dal tarka is my go-to order. Their tarka is so dense and smoky with such wonderful flavours that you wouldnt mind finishing an entire meal with just the dal!
The Paneer is also good here.
In winters do try the Gobi paratha here and you will surely come back for more.

I haven't experimented much all through the years with my order here and I honestly haven't had the need! Coz the above completely consume my taste buds!

Recommended place if you still haven't gone yet!

Let me be honest- I love chicken bharta. Primarily, because, there‚Äôs no bone in it and secondly, though less spicy, it tastes good- everywhere, or at least that‚Äôs what I used to think. But, let me tell you something. Unless and until you‚Äôve visited a small eatery tucked inside the busy little russell street, you‚Äôve been living your life with a myth- YOU HAVEN‚ÄôT TASTED CHICKEN BHARTA. Now, warning: once you‚Äôve tasted the dish here, you‚Äôll be biased for your entire life for this dish atleast, and if its ok, please go ahead.

Let‚Äôs say, you‚Äôre moving from chowringhee towards little russell st and taken the road beside the famous Jeevan Deep building. On the first crossing, take a left, and you reach this place- the Russell Dhaba.

Enter the place and don‚Äôt bother checking out their menu card. Out of all the items in the menu card, select the Anda(egg)-tarka butter fry and Chicken Bharta. Next, you‚Äôll ask for tandoori roti and be surprised to know that they have only chapati- but ok, there‚Äôs nothing called pure pleasure in life‚Ä¶.. Even rose has thorns and hilsa has those devilish bones.

The tarka here is topped with a thick layer of homemade butter tastes quite good (even on the verge of being great). But, you‚Äôll find, along with it, some strange yellow colored creamy gravy will be served- don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôve come down to this place for this only. Rotis will be served one at a time, so don‚Äôt worry. And, just as you dig in the gravy, with the first spoon, you‚Äôll find that whatever you‚Äôve tasted, knowing as chicken bharta, was a lie. The shredded chicken is dipped in a super-creamy gravy with lots (and I mean lots of cream and ghee) and that has made all the difference. Its mild to core, however its ensured that the chicken shreds don‚Äôt lose their texture. Its not melt-in-mouth feelings, but like the foreplay before the actual session, which makes way for a perfect love-making session.

But but but, the ambience is nothing so great and for family, I personally prefer to parcel it back rather than a dine-in session. But, who cares, when you have a spoon of heaven served, you can have it at home also. Price is quite decent, so nothing to worry about. And, I should be clear, other items in the menu (except their palak cream and palak paneer) are not worth and can easily be avoided.

So, if you‚Äôd like to know what a real bharta should taste like, come, enjoy Russell Punjabi Dhaba.

Russel Punjabi Dhabi stands at the crossing of Russel Street and Middleton Street. On my first visit here, what I noticed was that the dhaba was totally empty and people were just having tea and samosa outside and gossiping among themselves. Without thinking much, I ordered for a tea and a samosa. The tea came in clay cup, which is common in all dhabas but here, the size of the cup was quite large. The tea was really nice and the samosa was piping hot, though tasted nothing extraordinary. I almost burnt my tongue having the hot tea and samosa :p Would be back next time to have something from their dine in menu !

That is a good parantha which instantly and uncontrollably makes one crave for winter sunshine and foggy mornings, even when had in sultry Calcutta summer evenings. And, all this when parantha was eaten after two hours without re-heating and still tasted soft, and wonderful. 

Russel's aloo parantha had smallest chunks of parboiled aloo (instead of mashed ones), and when served hot with dollops of butter, can only taste so much better. 

The long queues indicated how popular the options of tea, samosas and lassi were, which I shall try during my next visit. 

Overall, I finished the meal with much happiness - waiting for winters. Food that conjures up happy imageries is so much better than those who don't and for that, Russel Dhaba has won my heart.

In verdict : Do visit.

One of the popular Dhabas in Kolkata. Located at a walking distance from Park Street Metro, be careful before coming here. Not to undermine the fact that these guys aren't consistent with their offerings, the food here can be oily and buttery. But then, that is what Dhaba food is all about. Isn't it? The place is not exactly clean, and hence hygiene freaks, please do stay out. Have tried Aloo Paratha and Bharta at two different times. The Aloo Paratha was yummy, but was slightly oily. Chicken Bharta was the best of the two. Shredded Chicken portions accompanied with a sumptuous gravy. Service is usually fast here, but the staffs here might just have some behavioral issues!

This place is considered to be a hidden gem.
Though the place looks shabby, but is quite popular. There are sitting arrangements made both in the ground and first floors.
We ordered chicken bharta, salad and plain rotis. It tasted heavenly. The bharta was perfectly cooked with shredded chicken pieces which were succulent.
Location is quite great. Try out if you're near the LIC building in Maidan.

Located at a very accessible region in the city.  Situated at a 5-7 minutes walking distance from the park street metro station. Having been here a few times, I can only say that the consistency of this place hasn't been the best. Yet, i would admit the food here is very good. I myself have tried, the butter chicken, butter roti, aloo parantha, chicken saag, paneer butter masala, daal fry, daal makhani and the kesar chaai. While most of their dishes are amazingly cooked, they are quite rich and not the ideal for the calorie conscious. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who has not eaten here yet. But, i would give a disclaimer making one aware that the food might not be as good as people say, because consistency is a major problem here. Now, coming to customer service, i would say that the behaviour of the staff is not commendable. The sardar ji who sits outside and runs the place is the very rude and ill-behaved. The upstair seating area has only one menu card that is shared around everyone sitting there and when asked for another card, they blatantly refuse. The hygiene of the place is not the best, drinking water is not advisable, and i would suggest taking a mineral water bottle. Overall a decent place to go and grab some quick bites if you are short on time and don't care about excess butter in everything. ;)

One we went to check this dhaba after getting many recommendations from one of my friends. If you're looking for any posh restaurant this place is not for you. Tried alu paratha and tea. That slice of butter on top just stole my heart. Tea was also good. There's always a rush in this place, always filled with customers. Be it college students or office goers.

The Russell dhaba is a dhaba where food is great...service is good and wait is less. A place to enjoy food in the car. Their samosa, tea, coffee is really good and whenever I pass from there its a must.  Coming to food the chicken bharta, egg bhuji, aloo paratha all are good. Aloo paratha is little oily but really yummy. Even the veg items like black dal is tasty when had with chapatti. Its open till late at night and is always crowded in the evening but still the wait and service has never been an issue. Not to forget that their lassi is equally good. They are consistent with their quality since I have tried all the items many a times including their lassi. Xmas evening at lark street this was the only joint which could serve me food at 2am. Small joint but must visit.

After watching KKR v/s RPS on 14may...I was starving....so me and my folks decided to have dinner at this place.
It's perfect to have Punjabi food.Gives an authentic taste of a dabha at highway.
This place is famous for its chai...but I am not tea lover so didn't try.I directly dug into the main course.I tried gobi paratha...I bet one is enough to get you down.But i found the stuffing in the paratha lil bit salty.I coupled it with chicken bharta..which was actually quite good.Apart from these I also tried paneer do piaza.The paneer was soft and fresh.The gravy was yummy.
I summed up my whole meal with kesaria lassi which was a bliss.

I had been hearing a lot about Russel Dhaba's Alu Paratha from a office friend. So finally one day after office I headed into the joint along with her. The waiters said Alu Paratha would take some time. Then we saw them preparing samosas. The potato stuffing of the samosas were tempting. So we asked for samosas and tea first. The samosas were served with sweet chatney .It went well with the piping hot tea. So we did not mind waiting patiently for the much desired Alu Paratha.

The parathas were big in size and were served with a dollops of Butter. One piece is more than enough for one person. The stuffing is wonderful. It justifies the high price. It costs Rs70/ per piece.
The sitting area is very cramped. But people can park their cars in front of the shop and enjoy the tasty food sitting in the comforts of their own cars. The waiters would carry the required items to the cars and the customers do not even need to step out of their cars. Their lassi is also famous. I am yet to try the non veg items.

I always had a dream to sit in the car and have dinner with my husband. I came true last night at Russel Punjabi Dhaba. We ordered Boondi Raita, Alu Paratha, Onion Paratha, veg Do pyaza and Lassi. The Alu Paratha was good with a dab of butter,boondi raita was freshly made and tasted good. The onion paratha was not my favorite but the tawa roti was freshly made soft and thin like home. I enjoyed the veg Do pyasa but it was made with dalda most probably. Overall its a good place but yes its costly! The alu paratha was 70/- which is Yes ! a lot to pay.

After hearing about this place for some time went with my family for breakfast. Reached there by 7 am and was helped by a waiter to find a parking space who also took our order. Aaloo parantha and lassi was straight and easy. As per the recommendation of all didn't venture inside so won't be able to share my views. Food came in around 10 min. A large parantha with a cube of butter and a generous portion of mixed aachar. Taste was very good. Bit on the oily side. Lassi came in just as we were finishing off the parantha and it was also worth it. Overall drove off very satisfied on a Saturday morning and hope to come back again.

Russell Dhaba,located on the crossing of Russell street and Middleton street,is a must visit for anyone in Kolkata, at least once.More famous as a chai joint,where you can park your cars and they serve you inside..it also serves lovely veg and non veg food.I have had food quite a few times.Inside its a bit small,with the upper floor a bit claustrophobic. Service is  lightning fast.Have had Chicken bharta,butter chicken with Roti's.One delicary you should try is Aloo paranthas dipped in butter with chicken bharta,also with butter!Easy on the pocket,and place where you get good food and tea till late at night.

The first thing that your eyes will catch here is how cramped the total place is. But 1st timers, take the risk and walk in - you cannot get a better North Indian food joint in this area than this one!
From the tea and samosa to their variety of parathas with mouth watering dishes - I licked my fingers every time I walked in here.
Cons: service is slow. The joint is a richer version of a dhaba. So no special ambience factor. And yes, it's really small.

The place belongs to bikers who form the core crowd.

The menu is an authentic punjabi highway dhaba one.

We always try lassi, chai and that best aloo paratha of Kolkata.

Be sure to try their aloo paratha else ur missing out on a great delicacy.

Russel Punjabi Dhaba is a popular name in the Maidan area. But, I have not gotten the chance to visit it in a long time
Finally the chance came. It was by sheer happenstance that I found this dhaba. It is located in Russel Street, near to the Maidan Metro Station. I was walking back home from T. I. M. E and thought of taking a detour. I found this dhaba and immediately went it. The dhaba is not so clean.. That was my first impression. They even have an upper floor. I skim read the menu and saw that every itwm os overpriced. I ordered a lassi. It came within three minutes. The lassi was good. The behavior of the staff was good. I will visit again provided that I have no other option

Tried their lassi on a whim after a heavy lunch and it was heavenly on a hot March afternoon. Thick, creamy and not too sweet, the Lassi hit just the right spot and left me overwhelmed with my new found love for lassi in a Bhnaar(kulhaar). The earthen pot lends a distinct flavour to the lassi and makes it even better. The tea here is really famous and even though I haven't tried their food, the crowd outside during lunch hours can vouch for its excellence.

my ratings purely depends on chicken bharta & saag tadka! yes...this is the place where my father used 2 take me since last 10 years or more....maybe. it has its old legendary charm and after having there food after prlonged for years...the aroma and taste of the food still makes me go weak on my knees. they serve typical punjabi dhaba food with loads of butter. i ordered saag tadka, chicken bharta boneless, roti, aloo paratha, veg sandwich, tadka fry & salad. none of the items excpt the aloo paratha dissapointed me. yes, i actualy was the most excited one to have the paratha coz of its immense popularity from this joint. but it thourougly disspointed me. as bcoz i am a regular customer of this joint since so laidback years, still never tasted their aloo paratha's... thus i did...and it was my 1st and last time hopefully. the paratha was huge in size, had ample amount of stuffing inside BUT....the taste was totally bland. there was no salt also+ & had no typical aloo paratha masala also. so all in all......hd a wonderful experience yet again from this joint.....and hopefully they continue to spread their legacy of awesome food always :)

Good place to have tea and hang out with your friends. Prefer ordering from the car and having in it only. Dal makhni and roti is what I prefer to have always.

This is a dhaba one of a kind located very much near the maidan metro station exit point and is situated in the very popular streets of Kolkata known as Russell street Kolkata .
I have visited this location like around 10 to 20 times from a close span of 3 to 4 years and evertime I visit here the service is same , the uncle who owns the restaurant still yells at his workers in the kitchen as well to his servers, so not much interesting that way but the food rocks here as they make your favourite aloo paratha , lassi and tea like you always want it to be .
The aloo paratha is fully stuffed with aloo and nourished with butter and accompanied by pickles which is part of the food so whether you eat it or not it is still present there , then the lassi is nicely made with sufficient sugary and milky taste which let's you feel good after having that aloo paratha .
Then there is hot chai ( tea) available for you incase u don't want to have lassi or you want to have both the stuffs as per your wish you can sip them both if your belly has no problem .
To finish it off I would say this place has even other stuffs apart from the three listed above items that I always indulge to eat so you can get meal foods like Roti's ,dal makhni , tarka and other veg / non veg items giving you a feel of a dhaba without its interiors right .

It is a convenient place for a tasty lunch after standing in a long queue at ICAI and the SBI building of Jeevan Deep nearby.. I went there with my parents.. We liked the Alu Parathas.. shared 2 among 3 of us... it was sufficient !!¬†

You wouldn't want to look at the place and go into it, but once you've tasted the food there's no stopping you. Even though the seating area isn't really something a lot of people prefer, they serve you in your car from early morning till late in the night and is famous for the tea, samosas and Sandwiches. Also highly recommended are the different types of parathas and do-pyazas! When you want to binge eat, its the place to be.

I won't be wrong if I say they make the best Aloo parathas in town! The north Indian spread served here is a delight too. The dal here is fabulous, so different. The paneer butter masala is pretty good to taste as well. Today, the Aloo do pyaza was very disappointing. It's better if I don't talk about hygiene in this review as I love the place too much for the food they serve. Overall, definitely recommended if you are near Russel street, located exactly opposite the CA institute on russel street!

The parathas are waste. They have lost the authenticity of being a punjabi dhaba by providing fried parathas and the cost is too high as well .Other than tea and kachori which is something one should really try they have nothing good to serve at all. I wanted to give 0 out of 5 but for tea and kachori i prefer giving 1.

Big disappointment. Think twice before going.

One of the most iconic post-SomeplaceElse joints for amazing North Indian food at throwaway prices.

Aalu gobhi parathas, chicken bharta, egg tarka, jeera rice, tawa rotis and the amazing chai are lip smacking.

Manage to enter by 12.25am and one can sit  till 1.30am (through cleaning and potato peeling extravaganzas, through). The breakfast is worth a visit, too.

There are some places where you want to go over and over again, simply because of one dish, whose taste is unmatched. Russel Dhaba is one such place and the Chicken Bharta is that particular dish. Though this is widely popular for their tea and snacks, you just can't miss the Chicken Bharta. Couple it with a butter roti, salad and a coke, it makes your lunch nothing short of bliss. Just the perfect dish.
Reasonable prices, tasty food, and that Chicken Bharta.
Lassi could have been better. No proper ambience, but since it's a dhaba, that's justified.
I am definitely coming back here very very soon.

Their alu paratha, tea and lassi will definitely make your heart go 'balle balle'. Though the place is not very clean and tip top but that is because it's not a restaurant but a dhaba. One must compromise in the life in order to have something extraordinary. Therefore, hygiene, dirt, dust and all the other negative characteristics can be kept aside for a moment only because of that huge dollop of butter over their alu parathas.

Russel Dhaba is an iconic place close to Maidan metro. They don't have much of seating or ac. Its more like a drive in, and people order and eat in there cars. The food and tea is to die for. The tea is 20 bucks but one of the best in kolkata and food ranges from alu/paneer/gobi paratha, tadka dal, samosa, nimki etc. Love the parathas served with home made butter and achar.. Divine..

Ambiance¬† might not be that attractive, but the food is great . Yesterday me and my wife went there for a lunch and had veg pulao, rajma and chicken bharta with salad.

Chicken varta was exceptionally good both quantity and quality wise but a little bit oily though. Veg pulao was tasty and rajma was good. All the waiters are friendly and suggests the options if require, but the aged cashier need to change his attitudes towards customer for better WOM.
We will definitely revisit ASAP for a glass of lassi.

When you spot rows of cars parked at the Russel Street and Middleton Street junction, you should know that this eatery is nearby. The Russel Dhaba has been one of my favourite hunting grounds when it comes to taste varieties of Paratha and Tadka. Most of the times I order food from there to my office which is nearby and other times I take food from there to my home. But if you really want to experience the Dhaba atmosphere then you should hit the mezzanine floor of the eatery and have the Paratha and Tadka.

Topical "pappe da dabha" this ambience & food reminds me of Amritsar or any north Indian dabha.......
This place was again a spontaneous decision, me n my friend was looking for a good joint for   Indian breakfast, it was planed to go India restaurant but we were disappointed to see it shut.
Zomato search helped once again and we decided on Russel 
If you always look for good ambience and hygienic cooking environment then this place is not for you, you may even see people taking bath.
Ordered for some samosa, sandwiches, aloo paratha and lassi...
Excellent breakfast stuff.... Literally reminded me of Amritsar breakfast
Paratha and lassi is must try !!!!!

Been their once. Went there one evening. Started off with their singharas (or samosyes as any north indian would say), and they tasted good with chutneys. And then tried their tawa rotis and chicken bharta as they fitted the students pockets good. And the chicken bharta was delicious. Finished off with glasses of lassi which were if not the best but on the better side, and served fresh in an earthen pot enhanced its feel and aroma, gave it that authentic rustic charm. Its really "dhaba" and not any glamorous hotel using that tag. Its like a highway joint just not on the highway. Dont expect super hygeine, clean white porcelain or suit boot waiters. Its all missing. But if ur tongue and tummy wants some real north indian delicacies, come without nakhras, fill ur belly and go away.

This place is at one of the happening places in kolkata. The food here is very good and tasty. the service is good. Lassi is a must try here.

The major problem comes with the cashier(sardar). He overcharges and tells menu card has old rates. If u ask for item wise bill he will shout saying " jab khaathe ho tab bata nahi lagta. Paise bharne mein kyaa jata hai". He is very unfriendly.¬†

Go to this place if u can bear such attitude.

2. Pure Punjabi type, North Indians Gonna love it because of some real Punjabi taste in Kolkata.
3. Aloo Paratha with butter¬† is yummy but one might find it expensive. (Around Rs 70-80 per paratha in the roadside dhaba is kind of expensive).
4. Lassi should be the attraction but it's a disappointment here.
5. Lot of staffs, so service is not an issue.

Great location for a late night hangout and dinner. It's very close to maidan metro station just in case u find it difficult to get here. 
Their stuffed parathas are pretty good. Their dhaba made mixed vegetable pickle is pretty tasty. Their serving sizes are kind of small but they serve good Indian food. Plus u can order from inside your car and eat it in the open with your friends and family. 
Great location, good food. Give it a shot.

One stop for all your Punjabi cravings. The first time we had ordered Rajma and roti. And to be honest I wasn't satisfied. The second time, I tried their ALU ka paratha and that was amazing. They serve it with a chunk of butter, which melts instantaneously, thanks to the kolkata heat and the hot paratha. With it they provide spicy and tangy pickle, and that is the most heavenly combo ever. Unless of course, they decide to include yogurt. The price is reasonable. And the food is tasty. Must visit, if you around the area.

This is where Calcutta goes to have chai!! :) Almost as iconic as Victoria Memorial ( take that, Queen Victoria!). Their chicken bharta is to die for, by the way. Breakfast scene or post dinner/party chai scene happens here. GO!

Looking for some after party food.. This is the place for the late nighters :) The food served here isn't that great but yes who cares when you're just trying to fill in your super hungry tummy. Chai here is yummy... The aroma travels right across the streets welcoming you :)  i have eaten Dals, Bhartas , paranthas and they taste good. But I will say a big NO NO to the pulaos they serve here.

Oh what a lovely place. Especially for those post midnight dinners. Perfect place to be with friends. Dont miss out on the chicken bharta and the tawa rotis especially. You could just go on and on and on. Lassi and tea both these disappoint you with the quality in terms of density but then the heavenly food makes up for it

Late night joints is the In thing in the country now and they are well needed too. With the adverse working hours in MNC's we need more of these small joints to grab a nectre of tea or quick bite in those wee hours of the night or to be precise early dawn. But what marks Russell Dhaba apart from a Sharma, Balwant or Desi Cuisine is the rumble of bullets that you get to hear whenever you visit this shady little iconic joint. It is THE ZONE for most of the Bullet Biker Gangs and one who comes here gets instantly energized by the rumbling energetic spasm of the Bullets' sound.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Coming back to the food unlike the above mentioned Russel Dhaba is also miles apart as they serve NonVeg but i would not recommend it as they are far superior in their Veg delicacies. i am huge huge huge fan of their Butter paneer Dal Tadka and especially all their Parathas. Mixed paratha is the kingpin here. I am not a huge fan of their Tea as it is less than mediocre a potent.

They serve you average food and the point is that you don't have too many options. In breads all you get is a maida ka phulka or chapati. Tea is hopeless... And not worth what they ask for. I think they use tea leaves dust than tea leaves to make tea.

From what I have heard is that their parathas are splendid but I have also heard that it‚Äôs too oily when served and topped with butter. FAT!!!

The owner who sits right at the door step is an arrogant old man and screams at his guests if it gets a little chaotic while parking. Have seen people enter into a tiff. Absolutely insulting unless you get a clear parking slot and the waiters help with the service promptly. 

They don‚Äôt serve you a bill post meal and this means you pay what they ask you for, any issues then the sardarji simply calls you to come and settle with him. Ideally nobody would want to deal with an angry old arrogant chap. Poora do numberi ka dhanda hai. 

Also like the waiters say, tissue mat mangiyega : ‚Äúgaadi mein kitne log hai, count karke tissue deta hai sardar‚Äù. Anyway carrry your own box of tissues or napkins.

Food: If you wanna grab a small bite then must try the aloo paratha and the chai. It's the best aloo paratha and tea I have had in the city. Although I am sad because the size of their parathas are decreasing slowly. For a bigger appetite, you can try their chicken butter masala, palak paneer and aloo gobi. They are sure to be good. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: They provide you plastic chairs & tables and absolutely nothing when it comes to decor. Certain corners of the dhaba is pretty dirty. People generally prefer having the food outside the dhaba under the sky or in their cars with friends more than inside the dhaba. It's good for a casual hangout with friends. I rate it 2.5/5.

Service: Very good service provided by limited number of very well-behaved staff. If you visit the place regularly you are sure to make friends with one of the waiters. Speed is medium. Remains open till pretty late so that's an advantage. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Certain items are slightly costlier than in other dhabas while other items are of standard rates.

Overall I give it 3.5/5.

The worst restaurants i have ever been to the staff and the two punjabi owners are very rude and they don't have any manners how to speak to the customers. I bought a cup of tea but there was an insect so i told them to give me a fresh cup of tea but they were very rude and told me its ur responsibility . I had to throw that cup in the bin and was forced to pay them. Punjabi dhabas are known for their food and friendly behavior but in this restaurant its vice versa..

I give ¬†a 3.5 rating to this just for the awesome "CHAI" they make. I used to go to ICAI for my trainings and every morning I used to see the morning walkers sitting in groups and enjoying the tea. This had been in my wish list since a long time. I had the opportunity to taste the delight¬†on a rainy day and since then it is at top in the list of my favorites. This is best suited to go with friends and family even at 9 o clock in the night.

As a child I used to often come to this Dhaba with my mom uncle and my grandmother to have their sandwiches and somehow a taste had developed for them even though they were just plain bread and coleslaw. But, later down the line the place being close to college when more visits were made, it is a tad bit overpriced compared to traditional dhabas. Food is good no doubt but the overall experience has always been bad

Oldest restuarant in the city of joy. Have been visiting the place since 2008. Food worth the money spent. A complete meal with family will cost you pocket a 1000 bucks. A tasty retreat for those longing for a allu paratha or chicken in pure punjabi style. Though it has problem for dine in, but people with their own vehicle enjoy the most. A must visit if you are a foodie.

Great place serving stuffed parathas with flavoured tea to have a sip. During peak hours the wait is worthy. Prices are reasonable. I would request you people not to order the mixed stuffed paratha as you are likely to get more amount of potato filling. Tea is a little over priced for students like me but its good. Russel dhaba after balwant singh's dhaba is the best in the town which is trying to bring the punjabi influence in the city not only with its food but also with its service. To rate the outlet i would give 
FOOD - 3.5 off 5
AMBIANCE- 2.5 off 5
SERVICE - 3.0 off 5

LITTLE RUSSEL DHABA, known for its hot chai and samosa. Though the place is pretty small but the seating arrangement is quite interesting as they have created a makeshift first floor with tables and chairs to sit and enjoy your meals. The paranthas to this place are worth trying and can be complimented with a glass of chilled lassi. Though apart from this I didnot find anything worth in this joint.

I often come here ones in two weeks with my parents and brother, we come here to eat dinner or simply mid-night snacks, we simply come here so far, a 30 minute journey from my house simply to eat one mouth watering supremely delicious chicken bharta. Russel street dhaba sells one of the best chicken bharta in the whole of calcutta, no place is any match for the chicken bharta in this place, the restaurant has only couple tables to dine in so people order the food and they bring it to UR car where u can eat and park UR car right outside the place. some people come here for the aluu paratha, I found nothing special about it. the aluu do pyaza was delicious and the chola bhatora had a lot of flavour but was a little tough. our total bill with 1 bharta, 1 aluu do pyaza, 1 chola bhatora & 10 roti's came up to around 800 rupees

One of the good roadside places in Kolkata to have chai samosa - quick service. The samosas are yum and different - small in size unlike other Cal places. Chai is ordinary but decent. Occasionally have tried food - very heavy but tastes good. There is no ambience per se - service is good if they feel you will tip them well otherwise "chalu" service. The Hygeine is a area of improvement. But a place one can try if you are nearby..

A ¬†over hyped joint in my opinion.It was once known for the famous kesar chai,lassi,samosas and the staple Punjabi tadka dish.Recently on back to back visits found out that almost every item's quality has gone downhill. The chai had no kesar and quite flavour less.Samosa was not fresh with aloo stuffing missing the punch. Lassi was too watery for my liking. Cannot comment on the once famous tadka and chicken dishes especially bharta. The joint seems to be solely surviving due to its awesome location-bang opposite the ICAI EIRC building.Hygiene was always an issue and still is. Some things never change, they say. Prices have been jacked up-samosa at Rs 10/- and large "bhar" of chai comes at Rs 20/-.

Location: Russell Street, diagonally opposite CA Institute.

This is one of those places which I have visited umpteen number of times may it be for lassi, tea or the Dhaba style food! 
This place serves decent food, but at the cost of hygiene levels. 
It's usually crowded and people prefer getting served in their cars itself, to which the servers happily cater. 
-Reason being the cramped up seating arrangements inside. 
Yes,this place also has a seating arrangement inside spread across two floors, the ground and the mezzanine. 

Summarizing the Fooding out here, 

‚Ä¢ What makes my taste buds happy? 
Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Aloo Do Pyaza, Vegetable Do Pyaza, Aloo Parathas, Butter Roti, Kesaria Tea, Lassi. 

‚Ä¢ What makes my taste buds sad? 
The excess of oil in the aloo parathas at times.

‚Ä¢ What makes me happy? 
Quick Service, Happy to help kind of staff, Pocket friendly prices. 

‚Ä¢ What makes me sad? 
The low hygiene levels, Fluctuations in the quality of food. 

Overall it has been a mixed experience.

If u are wondering what the hype is all about ? - just try their Butter Roti and Chicken Bharta - it really is  "THE BEST" Bharta i've ever had  - it's as they say  "Makkhan aur Malai Marke" . I once tried the Palak Paneer it wasn't upto the mark .
And as far as the complains about their Hygiene goes - i'm not much of a hygiene freak , but it really is edgy . One word of advice - always go for bottled water in this place . 
Prices are a bit inflated - the lassi is not worth trying  - the tea is good  - the service is okay and that's pretty much it .

What makes Russel Dhaba great is the fact that they open up at around 6:30 in the morning. The last time I visited this place, I ordered a Samosa followed by a Paratha. The food seemed great and reasonably priced at first. But then, I ended up having a running tummy after a while. 


Bonus Tip : The Chai at Russel Dhaba it totally worth a go!

My review is based absolutely on the tea they serve. 
So while returning from college it started raining heavily suddenly and I was drenched! 
So I decided to have some tea and warm myself a little as I was literally shivering by that time. 
The tea arrived in absolutely no time and ahh. It was heaven. 
I burnt my tongue (I've a tendency to do that a lot) but I couldn't stop sipping the tea. 
I paired my tea with the samosa and mathri. While the mathri tasted good, I didn't quiet like the filling of the samosa. 

When compared to the other tea serving joints this is comparatively heavy on pocket due to their popularity and location. However, it was worth it!

Located opposite CA institute on Russell Street plus being close to St. Xaviers, the dhaba has always been a favored destination for some samosa, nimki and kesaria tea for me. But overall the place disappointrs !!!

The sitting area is cramped up and very congested and i prefer to have the stuff served in my car. There is no decor as such. The staff service and hospitality varies as to who is serving you but they are all fast enough. The hygiene is a major concern !!!!!

The prices are not so low but reasonable enough like the other dhabas in the city. The food is very average in my opinion. The aloo parathas are good but am not so fond of their other offerings except for dal makhani which is good. I prefer this place for its great samosa and kesaria tea though i find that tea is not prepared that well all the time and basically depends on your luck. There are chana-chipswalas outside who provide nice chips to go alongside ur tea.
 
Pros:
1. Opens up early and serves till late night
2. Love their samosas and kesaria tea
3. Serves you in your car

Cons:
1. Unhygenic environment inside
2. Seating space is not so comfortable
3. Limited menu
4. Inconsistent food quality

People prefer to have their food in their cars while visiting this dhaba :D
Unlike the Highway Side dhabas we often see, its a total different experience.

Me along with my 3 more friends visited the dhaba at about 7 pm in the evening. With our stomachs burning in hunger we climbed the narrow stairs and reached the 1st floor(its like a half floor). The ground floor was congested and we decided to do lots of fun so we climbed to the top :P The roof was very short so we had to bend in order to stand :D The tables were not soo pretty, but not untidy as well :)

The server was an awesome friendly guy, we ordered in english,bengali and hindi :D He understood all and brought the food super fast. 

We ordered Chicken Bharta,Mutton Tarka,Egg Tarka and Aloo Do-Piyaza(we had a veggie friend). It was supported with butter rotis,parathas and salad :)

Let me describe the items now
Chicken Bharta- it was world class and the king in the table, we ended up ordering 2 plates.The dish was yummy and was really worth trying
Mutton Tarka-didnt like it much,was actually a normal tarka with 2 pieces of mutton in it. Nothing special.
Egg Tarka-it tasted good and was better than the mutton.lol
Aloo Do-piyaza-if bharta was the king this was the queen, so yummy onion and potato, i still remember the taste :P

The rotis were not tandoori but were hand made with ample butter coating in them. you can well imagine that we almost lost count of the rotis :D
The stuffed aloo paratha was also different and delicious :P

At the end we tasted some tea as well.It was heavenly.
People visiting this place should try their tea atleast.
Enjoy :)

I have had at this Dhaba a couple of times and wasn't too impressed with the food that they serve. Once I had the aloo paratha which was decent at best and then a romali roti with egg tadka. The roti was soft enough (maybe because it was hot and freshly made) but the tadka was the worst I have ever had. And I have had the tadka from the roadside vendor on Camac Street, at The Dhaba, Ballygunge, Jai Hind Dhaba and a few other dhbas. It just did not taste good enough. On the other occasion I had the chicken roll which was not that great either. The interiors are shabby and not too well maintained and the service is average. Most people tend to eat in their cars. But there are a lot of places with shabby interiors but they serve mouth watering food. Not visiting again. Ever.

As i had my college exams, the much awaited Russel's dhaba was again visited. One of my friend only owns the Dhaba and as one of my friend wanted to order chicken early in the morning, we again ended up ordering chicken bharta and rotis. We were very hungry and wanted to enjoy the very rare Russel dhaba special chicken bharta. Just because our friend was there, we could enjoy chicken bharta much before they usually serve( 11 am - 1 am at night). 

The bharta was really good and we ended up ordering one more Bharta. The onion salad tasted good. However, a tinge of red chilli powder could have made it even more tastier. As they did not had the soft paratha's which usually tastes good, they made a special paratha much like an aloo paratha. I personally did not like it because it had hell lot of oil and it was not much complimenting the bharta. 

The special thing about the bharta is the masala in which it is prepared. I have never tasted same or somewhat like bharta in any other restaurant or dhabas just like jai hind's romali roti. It was filling. 

Suggestions:-

1) Get some more items on the menu.
2) Renovate the Dhaba. It is very much old now. Requires cleanliness and hygiene will become an issue if not done in the right time.
3) As per the prices charged, quantity of food should be increased more. 

Overall, a superb place to grab a cup/bhaand of tea and move on.

Russell Dhaba is located just near the maidan metro diagonally opposite to ca institute. It is a very old Dhaba basically one of my friends. It offers awesome alu ka paratha and chicken bharta. One should not miss these two while  giving a visit to this Dhaba. It even offers awesome tea and decent lassi. But what makes this place different from other Dhaba is the different and rare  delicious and out of the world *chicken bharta* which they offer. However, it is very congusted and unhygienic and no proper care or concern is taken to renovate it or make it more clean despite the fact that it is earning profit. A 3.5 star rating for it. :)

This was one popular lunch joint when we were sales executives in the mid 90s. It was filling and wholesome, tasty food. However, now it is a much more polished presentation although the essential menu remains the same. The Tadka Dal Roti, Chicken Bhartha, Rice and Chicken Curry, Baingan Bhartha etc all remain good to taste. But, their tea is the best in the entire locality- served in clay khullar/ Bhaanr it is a great experience to slowly sip the thick milky "chaay" in a wintry evening.

I hope this is the one situated in the far end of russell street if we enter from park street..
first of all "i have seen the waiters clean dirt from basin using the spoon they serve with the food..".. and that also openly..can any place on earth beat this..the food is damn expensive comparing to what we get there..stingy place, smells bad, no ventilation..if people go over there to show they enjoy eating in a dhaba..plz don't do so the place is not worth a penny..
the only thing u can have there is the tea hoping that they atleast clean the utensils for making tea..

In a nutshell:

Traditional YUMM Dhaba food & some good chai & lassi at a super tiny two level eatery‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.aloo paranthas here r better than at most places in Delhi as well.

Short Description ‚Äì in case u r in a hurry:

Well, I love travelling across the country & bumping into roadside Dhabas. Except for the touristy ones a typical truck-walas Dhaba is usually characterized by Spartan interiors, efficient & fast service by ‚Äòchhotus‚Äô & piping hot freshly made food. Usually the food is prepared (not from scratch, but usually from a semi processed state) after the order is placed. In case of daals etc the tadka is done after the order is placed. Even the meats etc are given a special touch up before serving.

The interiors of Dhabas usually have basic cleanliness but they r hardly ‚Äòperfectly clean & hygenic‚Äô by any standards. Tables get a dose of regular ‚Äòpocha‚Äô & the interiors get a touch up I guess once a year. Russell Dhaba might have started like that many years back but has now become something in between a true blue roadside dhaba & a fancy ‚ÄòDhaba look-alike‚Äô restaurant like Mirch Masala Kolkata, Dhaba Kolkata or The Dhaba, Claridges, Surajkund. 

Loads of people park in front of Russell Dhaba & eat in their cars. I being me, straight walked inside, to get an experience of what it is like. The Ground floor is congested & has a bunch of tables & chairs for people to sit & eat. It also has a large area that is like a cash counter cum beverage storage cum Refrigerator space. The end of the small dining hall was the kitchen which was bustling with activity.

The first floor is low ceiling & one has to bow down at several instances to reach the table. Visible cleanliness in the restaurant in general was average ‚Äì Not too bad, Not good either. 

The staff members were good. The one serving us was really good. I don‚Äôt think they r trained in professional institutes & hence they might not behave like in large restaurants, However, a smile, a nice ‚Äòhuman to human‚Äô behavior resulted good & we got some really extraordinary attention (beyond expectation). Rotis, water etc got refilled at exactly the right time, not too early not too late. A bit extra food was proactively packed for us even before we cud ask for it & so on.

Prices ‚Äì I found that to b quite OK by today‚Äôs standards ‚Äì not cheap for sure but not exorbitant as well. I have heard people say that this place is expensive. However by standards of similar eateries in other metros of India serving this level of food, this is surely not much. However if one compares to say a similar eatery in Dhaka or Kathmandu, food at Russell Dhaba might seem to b expensive.

Detailed Description ‚Äì In case u have the Time to NJOY reading:

We started our lunch with Aloo Parantha. It had a crispy outer layer & soft, fat, nicely spiced yumm filling. Perfect in every way. A dollop of amul butter on the top made it even better. They had cut it into bite sized pieces so that one doesn't have to tear the paratha while eating. Very few places in delhi NCR make parathas as enjoyable as this. We super loved it & rate it 4.5/5.

Post this we ordered Daal tadka with egg. This is a Dish that I wud say is from the Pungali cuisine ‚Äì Bengal influenced Punjabi cuisine. While Punjabi cuisine has a plethora of daals & daal tadkas, I guess no one has heard about the variations (like egg tadka, mutton tadka., mushroom tadka etc)  in Punjab.The form that it is sold in Kolkata & rest of Bengal is a localization.

The Daal tadka with egg was very balanced, well spiced, not overtly spiced & the spices had got well entrenched in the dish. The taste was intense. The consistency was thick. Egg made its presence felt but did not overpower the taste of either the daal or the tadka. We really liked this quite a lot & rate it 4/5.

We then went for Bhindi pyaz. It has a severe ‚Äòexcess salt‚Äô induced execution issue ‚Äì I guess he put salt twice. It was not excessively spiced but not too bland either. They had almost stir fried the ingredients. All veggies including onion were crunchy & that made it really good. Tomatoes were in big pieces. The dish was surely in the right direction & conceptually better than many other places I have had bhindi. Had it not been the salt issue, I wud have given it 4/5. The salt issue takes the rating down to 2.5/5.

Last item on our lunch was Mutton do piaza. Lots of onion in the gravy gave a mild enjoyable sweetness that created a balance with the salt. Lots of green chillies made the curry hot. Crisp fried onions were sprinkled on the top. When mixed with the gravy, the crisp onions gave a nice texture to the curry. The Mutton was super soft, melt in the mouth kinds. It was not at all fibrous. Super liked the mutton pieces as well. I give this dish 4.5/5.

The Tea was strong, good & not too sweet. It was served in kulhar (bhaar / earthen cup). I rate this 4/5.

The Lassi was thick & unidirectionally sweet. It did not have a hint of salt or sour. It did not seem to b hand made as well. It did not have a malai layer on top. However it tasted good on its own. It also had a smooth creamy feel. I rate this lassi 3/5.

Rating of food at Russell Dhaba averages out to 3.75/5.

I wud like to revisit in the winter to try saag meat & other typically Punjabi food. Look forward to it.

Russell Dhaba is renowned among the office goers in the Maidan area for its refreshing tea, coming in at Rs. 10 & Rs. 20. Also, it is one of the few places nearby which are open for breakfast. 

Apart from that, do not expect anything great. The preparation is good but they don't forget to bathe your aloo paranthas in oil and butter, in spite of special requests. The singadas (samosas for the uninitiated) are also drenched in oil more often then not. I also find the proprietor to be a bit rude, though some of the waiters have befriended us.

Hygiene is a word unheard of here (they don't serve finger bowls and the liquid soap dispenser dispenses water most of the times) and seating inside is quite shabby and suffocating. 

Russell Dhaba is, in the end, a Dhaba! and so it lives up to its name (whether for good or bad, I can't exactly say). I give it a 3 for saving me countless times from the mid-day boredom at office.

I have mixed feelings about Russel Dhaba. It used to be a cheap food joint during my college days, and they made amazing Aloo Paratha and in winter Mooli and Gobi paratha. A recent return assured me of the quality of Aloo paratha topped with some butter and I was extremely happy munching it down along with a thick lassi. However, the place is not too clean, and my biggest issue last time was a bunch of quarreling men, out of which one was the guy at the cash, screaming for nearly half an hour while we were eating. Definitely not something I liked at all, so cutting marks there! The tea here is good, although expensive, even by Park St. Standards.

Dhabas in Calcutta are fast turning into expensive restaurants. While The Dhaba in Ballygunge has taken on the nature of a high-end sit-down restaurant, Russel Punjabi Dhaba, to give it its full name, has decided to increase prices without improving facilities. This dhaba used to be (and still is, by all accounts) a favourite among people who want good parathas or tea or lassi. However, on the last two occasions I went to the place, I was disappointed.

The lack of cleanliness is probably the first thing that hits you. Traditional dhabas are simple, but almost always clean. In this case, to find a muddy mess on the floor all the time in a place located somewhere like Russell Street is surprising. The quality of the water and the state of the crockery and cutlery are not good either.

The food is still good, but customers usually sit in their cars and eat, so they rarely see the state of things inside the place. The parathas, in particular, are very good. In winter, the Gobi Paratha is highly recommended. They also make good tea and lassi, but to charge thirty rupees per cup (or bhar in this case) of tea and fifty for the lassi seems to be overdoing things. The service is rudimentary - you place your order and get served inside or the food comes to the car - but efficient.

Therefore, if the owners invest a little in cleanliness and reduce prices on some items, this place will certainly become far better.

While a dainty little place appeals to our aesthetics when it comes to brilliant food one can never go wrong with a good dhaba. It is for those who love the rich delicious taste from the Northern part of our country. This place has been there at the end of Russell street where it meets Middleton Row from as far as I remember and serves amazingly good food. The place is cramped and one needs to climb tiny stairs to find a seat and the seats are huddled together due to lack of space but the beautiful aroma which hits you the moment you enter the place keeps you from complaining. I had ordered the standard palak paneer with hot rotis on a rainy January afternoon and the result was a completely satisfactory gastronomical experience. On other occasions I have simply dropped in for their wonderful aloo paranthas. The items are common enough and need no explanation but the taste is wonderfully delicious. It still baffles me as to how certain good dhabas whip up food which has that unique taste that no high end restaurant can produce. It is probably a magical secret that they hold. The food is probably more winter friendly or even monsoon friendly due to its rich spicy taste. The prices are a big attraction. Places like this are your saviour for those days when your pocket seems a bit light but then again such is the taste of the dhaba that even when you are brimming with cash you cannot but help think of the delicious chicken butter masala or chicken korma or even the vegetarian  counterparts such as mushroom masala and are forced to drop in to pack a few delicious dishes to make yourself happy. I personally prefer taking a parcel from this place because the ambiance is probably not highly suited for a woman to be dining alone but then again there are always other ways to enjoy their food int he comfort of your own home. may this place be there for eternity.

the dhaba isnt actually a dhaba, it looks like a pice hotel and charges like a 2star one. the food is tasty if you like only chicken. the really hungry foodie should walk in. in the evening the chai and the snacks are truly worth the money. you need to roll down the car window and you will have waiters taking your orders and serving them hot on the trot. dont step in as the innards of the shop are pretty unhygienic. a casual walk with a bhNar of chai and some masala makai will definitely relax you after a hard day's work.

Heard of this place so much. I was in the neighbourhood this afternoon and  decided to walk in for a quick lunch.

In spite of being warned, I was surprised at how small the place is. I had to actually look for the staircase to the mezzanine floor. The steep stairs are difficult to climb (especially for a heavyweight like me), and coming down I banged my head onto the thoughtfully padded ceiling.

The place is none too clean, but not filthy either. A little more space and things would have been much easier.

Once seated, the waiter came for orders. I asked for mutton dopiaza (waiter suggested chicken when i asked him to ensure that the pieces were decent) and rotis, along with Thums Up. Was surprised to see tandoori rotis are conspicuous by their absence.

Food was served quickly enough. The rotis were soft and nice and the chicken was tasty, very different from what is usually served. Not very oily or rich, but with a large sprinkling of browned onion and tomato. The chicken itself was reasonably big and very soft!

Was annoyed to see them serve 200 ml bottles of soft drinks. Probably a way for them to get people to order a second one (which I did). They couldn't even manage a Thums up the second time, so had to settle for a Coke.

Climbed downstairs to pay and it came to 190 for one plate chicken, 4 rotis and 2 soft drinks. I asked the sardarji at the counter about a tandoor and he went off on how bad tandoori rotis are for health... something I wasn't aware of!

I love this place just for its chai.....its the best....a plain cup of tea worth RS. 30 and samosas are wow.... Ambience is untidy,,,,not clean but the food served is really well done. Egg Tarka with plain roti are the best for me. Chicken Bharta is tasty too... Its better to have the food inside our car,,,the lassis are well done too. Fish Dry Fry is nice too.
Prices are quite affordable and quantity is imeense.
3.5 from my side...

Don't expect anything like an ambiance in this joint. It's a tiny and yes unclean dhaba. They have lovely aloo parathas (with loads of butter, gave a heart attack just looking at that but... what the heck!!) and the lassis will refresh you to no limits and make you feel like you have landed yourself in Punjab already. The chicken bharta was good too. And if you are looking for some snacks then you can have their tea which is again nice in a clay pot (bhaar) and have somosas and nimkis with it. so all in a good place but a no no in summers its a non a.c pocket friendly place...

The place is dingy, tiny and lacks any sort of ambience. the tables are shared by perople. you have to bend you head considerably while sitting on the makeshift mezzanine, and the wooden stairs are dangerous.The location is the only point in its favour, being bang in the office zone, at the middleton street russell street crossing
The parathas(aloo, gobi or panner) are good in size, and one paratha, along with a plate of curd and a khullar of lassi can be sufficient for office tiffin.
But the veg/non veg side dishes are ridiculously overpriced for their quantity or taste.
Best avoided, but the area lacks other quick serving sit in options, hence the crowd of office goers in lunch hours.

The Dhaba on Russel Street has been around forever and for all those party-goers on Park Street the night did not end with out a hot milky cup of dhaba chai ..... we also used to go and hang out there in the evening after work to chit chat and catch up with friends and the piping hot tea with the namkin and samaosa make for many happy memories. What most people dont know is that the dhaba serves pretty decent grub as well. The chicken bharta, paneer bhurji, kali dal, alu paratha and butter roti are fairly good incase the hunger pangs hit you.

Russel Dhaba is a favourite haunt for late nighters with hunger pangs. Till the late hours of the morning, this place remains occupied with a steady rush of people, having their fix of the delicious masala chai and the sumptuous Dhaba food.  

Try out the Singaras and the piping Hot Masala Chai!
