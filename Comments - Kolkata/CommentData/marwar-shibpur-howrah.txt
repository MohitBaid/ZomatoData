Quantity is pathetic..Even the items are overpriced as per the quality and quantity..The so called restaurant should go for a turnaround or else the only people eating out there will be the owner and his family..

Pathetic and stale food quality and very poor service will never recommend this place to anyone their are much better options available nearby than this .I'll prefer to have food from footpath counters which are at least fresh made.

A few years back this use to be the prime place for localities and I have eaten here 'n' number of times and got Indian veggies packed from here. Ambiance is okies with old style chairs and table, and dim lighting. Indian is good but with coming of so many new options nearby, thanks to avani mall food court this has lost its crowd. 
With this place not having itself registered on zomato order or foodpanda, this has lost its charm.

Located near sandhya bazar on G.T road, it enjoys the advantage of being located on the high street.
There is nothing special about the ambiance of the place, a small place with regular seating arrangements.
The staff here is a little untrained, but i still like to go there because its convenient for me, and doesn't disappoint me when i feel like having north indian food. The preparation is pretty decent. I like the sabzis and dal here, the breads served are well cooked too. Nothing exceptional about the food quality, but its fine considering the prices and the location.
Overall il recommend it to people who are nearby and in the mood of a pocket friendly north indian meal!

It's OK kind of when you taste the food. I dnt prefer it for dine out cz the tables are too small for even 3 ppl. Generally preferred by me for Indian food through home delivery. 
But ya the malai kofta here's just tastes yummy. Do try it if you visit this place.

It is a great place where you can go with the family or friends to enjoy the meal or food. Here food is very good specially I personally think of the Nargisi Kofta with white gravy is very good.

Though located in a non restaurant type area, this place offers a lot to eat under normal interiors. Prices are neither too high nor to low. Marwar suffers a serious problem of typical low standard staffs. Their staffs lack behavioural ethics. I would have given this place 3 stars if the owners hire better people.

Ambience is good. Its not too much flashy. The most important thing is the food which is damn good for the price. Staff is polite but order process take a bit time.

Price of the food won't break your pocket. The place is suitable and well recommended to dine. BTW, I forgot to mention that you should go for Rajasthani dishes only. Pizzas, Sandwich, Shakes aren't a good thing to order here. They really don't taste good.Â 

Other than Rajasthani, you can have Chinese.

Marwar is located in Sandhya Bazar area of G. T. Road. It is a pure vegetarian restaurant. The restaurant is cheap and best and serves a good option for students. I have been to Marwar more than a couple of times. 

The ambience is nothing to cherish about. Seating capacity is quite low around 25-30. Staff are polite but untrained. Service is on the slower side. Overall food quality is good.

So for food I give Marwar a 3/5.
