Today I have tried the mutton gravy dish. Though the taste is so so, it is never close to what we get from traditional Bengali restaurant. Its similar to what we get in northern states. I have ordered here based on the others' reviews, which appreciates their their Bengali food. But actually I felt, these reviews misguided me, landing me into some some food center which provides North Indian type food.

Ordered from here today. Wanted Bengali food but loved their Sunday Special menu. Will make you fall in love with their North Indian delicacies. 
And guess what they had a great offer today. They would give you a certain percentage of discount if you ask for it!! Now that is special, who would do that?

When you are far from home, when you are sitting in your cubical on a sad Monday morning, when your son & daughter is far and you miss them, or even when you are busy partying with your friends & there's no one to cook for, you'll find one unknown friend, who is waiting to give you that comfort touch with their home cooked food. Truly homemade is what defines The BR's Kitchen.

With the perfect combination of oil, spices and veggies the love for vegetarians is redefined in The BR'S kitchen. Ghar ka khana with a twist of their own is what you will find. Even the Biriyani is less spicy and oily. They also have a good delivery team even though they were a little late in reaching . But overall great experience

Homemade food redefined. Less spicy, less oily perfect for daily lunch and dinner. Subscriptions are also available just in case you want food daily from them. You'll never be bored as the keep changing their menu everyday. Also if you want to spice up a little, they have lovely spread on all Sundays, Sunday Special they call it. For the perfect evening snack they also have a lovely snacks menu starting from Rolls which cost as low as Rs 20

Starting from no plastic packaging to the excellent spread of Bengali and north Indian cuisine. The spread of Thali is amazing . With the perfect blend of Indian & Bengali dishes the Thali is sumptuous & perfect.
