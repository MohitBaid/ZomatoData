Its one of those restaurant  that brings back  memories of your childhood,i.e absolute nostalgia. 
It is a tiny restaurant ,the kind that is rampant in North Kolkata can be considered a sought of Heritage for Behala area.
Service is fast and brisk and food is an absolute delight. Fish Butter Fry which is one of the must taste items here, is in one word " Delicious".  The thin coating of batter, fried to perfection and absolute uniformity added to the visual appeal.The cut of fish seemed to be a Bengali version of Goujon, and tasted absolutely heavenly.It is so rare these days to taste Bhetki in its un adulterated form. Price is Rs100/- inclusive of GST.

Though this place has been one of my favourite childhood haunts this is the first time I am reviewing it. I generally avoid oily food but I always make an exception to their kormas and koshas. The fish fry is good and costs a 100 bucks. The mutton korma is so so yummy as well as pocket friendly( 150 per piece). If it's your first time please try the korma. It is a must!

have you tasted their fish fries, chicken fries, fingers, rolls?? they will leave a permanent appeal in your taste buds. the place is old, and the ambiance, stuff not for great rating. but i rate them only for their fries.
