Been here for a team dinner...it was a great experience...starting from the service to the food...everything was great...we were 13 people...12 buffet and 1 A-la-carte order was placed...we also ordered a Black Forest Cake which was good enough...the buffet menu item count was not huge...but whatever was there was truly amazing...we had both veg & non-veg people in our group...
Buffet Menu:
Welcome Drink(Blue Lagoon)

Chicken lemon coriander soup
sweet corn soup

Chicken tandoori kebab
Fish Finger
Ajwani Paneer
Crispy baby corn

tandoori roti
steamed rice
pulao

paneer dopiyaza
chicken kasa
sorshe fish (Basa fish)

Payesh
Mango pastry

The Sorse Basa was a great one to taste...also the starters and all the main course was good...the ambience is also good...it was good to have IPL on screen...Overall experience was good...recommended for a buffet venue...The fried Rice and a mashroom side dish was ordered seperately...they also tasted good...

They also have a bar counter...some offers were running at that time...we had teachers and tuborg on offer...

I have been here during the Pujo special buffet and it was worth going.
They have a variety of foods which are much better in taste than the other restaurants in the nearby area, at a reasonable price.
No complain about the ambiance and the service. You can have great food and spend time with your loved once.
Although they can improve the waiting time.

Food- 4/5
Ambiance - 3.5/5
Staff- - 4/5

Very good ambience and also the behaviour of the staff was very good. The decor of the place was also good.
Now coming to the food part it was very much a preparation of an underdog chef. Had a number of items as the place only had buffet when I visited so practically I don't remember the names. But the thing that was awe fully bad and got my attention was the stuffed bell pepper. Just disgusting and the only reason for this was the huge amount of salt which it contained.
Coming to the desert part yes the desert was average and as such nothing worth disgusting or astonishing was found my me which deserves mentioning.

Located on the 2nd floor of Indismart hotel near webel more, just opposite Jaisalmer. Was quite empty even on a Sunday evening. We had Drums of heaven which was well cooked and there were 5 succulent pieces of chicken for about 200 bucks which is quite cheap I'd say. We also had mojito which was okay, and Budweiser and chocolate brownie. They have a happy hour from 11am to 11pm but there isn't too much of a choice of drinks. Staff were quite welcoming and the seating area was spacious.

No tie up zomato.
Very very poor qulaity of food.
Too costly.

Hotel management tries out with different experiments while preparing the dish.

Chinese food tastes like indian spicy street chinese.
Their chinese dish are not at all authentic. I can get much better qulatiy with half cost in my locality

I m a foodie n tried here the chicken manchurian dry today with my friends but tasted like chicken pakoda....total waste.

Guys plz never ever step into this restaurant if you want to have a good food.

First of all they have no tie up with zomato for past 2 years. So all menu cards shown here are out of date. The food are huge costlier than the shown menu cards.

Now coming to the quality of the food. OMG!! how they can be so tasteless. We have tried Hakka mix and Gravy noodles.


Not recommended at all. Ruined our lunch today. Beware all !!!

Went for a team outing last sunday for the dinner. It was completely vacant. We ordered chicken tandoori, corn pepper salt, chicken malai kebab. We were surprised they took more than 1hr to bring tandoori and when we asked they told they dint have chicken tandoori pieces so had to prepare freshly but when we ordered for second time they denied which was surprising at a 3 star hotel. Anyways food was excellent so, we dint complain much. They gave huge pieces of tandoori legs. Corn pepper salt could have been more crispy. Malai kebab was good too. Coming to drinks they had 2+ 1 offer. Drinks were priced on higher side. I hope service could have been fast. Otherwise it was nice experience. Ambience is nice for family or team gathering. Loads of open space and enough space between tables so, ni interference with other people talking on other tables.

Visited this place couple of times for corporate buffet dinner. Food is average. I would rather say this is a restaurant of the Hotel Management school. Food is mostly prepared by their students.  Though the ambience is good, but service is average. Their card payment devices are faulty most of the times once i had some hassles by paying through corporate card while taking my team for dinner.

I have been here during the Pujo special buffet, on Asthami and I was not disappointed.
To be honest, the variety they had on the spread beat most of the other restaurants out there and the price was reasonable as well.
I generally try and avoid too much of red meat outside, but they just nailed it! I wanted to personally go and thank the cook for this!
They could, however, go for a bit more decor in the interiors. As compared to the other places in the same area, Xspicy looks average - Don't go by the looks though :)

We bought a coupon from groupon and went to this place for lunch buffet with out team mates. Ambiance was good but food item displayed in buffet we found it to be less in number but on inquiring we got to know that we few items are to be served on table.For starters in  both veg and nonveg one thing was good but other was average. Main course was okeyish but the thing which they were supposed to serve on table was way too bad and when we complained they took care of it and since we were done with our main course they made sure that dessert was served properly.Overall  I would recommend this place for budget buffet and if you find anything not so good make sure you tell them so that they can work on your feedback immediately.

I visited here for office dinner party and wish I could skip that.  Seriously I never had pathetic food like this. I gave 1 rating only due to location and decorations.  Coming to food on buffet - 

Welcome drinks tasted like cough syrup mixed in 7 up.
Chicken tandoori pathetic. Any street food shop can make better tandoor than this.
Naan, pulao (or fried rice),  fish preparation somehow okies type. 
They kept something called Chicken dopiyanja. But actually u can call that "Chicken  Ghent". Full with half cooked onions and tomatoes. Chicken pieces also not cooked properly, bones separated from chicken. Pathetic. 
Fruit custard somehow better in taste. 
If u want to taste "dry" malpoa .. Visit here. 
Ice Cream was hard like stones. 

Overall pathetic and not recommended....

If you have visited Chai Break, Barbeque Nation or Flames and Grills, you will be disappointed here.
Ambiance is good but food could be better. There are limited items on the buffet and they don't have prawns/ mutton in the menu.
Starter is served after a welcome drink and a soup, which is just one veg and one non veg for just one serving.
You will find one veg starter which will be different from the one served before but won't be as good as that, 2 chicken items in main course, one fish item which will be good. One veg item say paneer. One salad section with 3-4 items. Plain and jeera rice + naan. In desserts you will find one sweet dish, one vermicelli kheer and one frozen cake ice cream which will be all awesome.
So in nutshell : Limited started, Less main course items, Better fish items and paneer. Awesome desserts, Nice Ambiance.

Update- Food is tastier so increased the rating to 4 from 3.5 .

I provide such high rating for very few restaurants, because even for the popular chains, it is very tough not to find any place for improvements, only a few are the exceptions. But definitely this restaurant makes an exception.  Not sure because if it is a part of a big hotel, the hospitality and the staff behavior are remarkable, absolutely remarkable.  We went on a team lunch and opted for the buffet. Items were,yes, the other reviews are right, not too many in numbers. But how delicious and fresh were these. All of the items. Pocket pinch is also not so high and amazing deals on happy hours.Thumbs up fro me for the restro!!!!!

Finally visited this restaurant - which is just a stone's throw away from my office! The XSpicy restaurant is situated at the 2nd floor of the Indismart Hotel.

The place is spacious for 40 odd people with comfortable sofas, wooden chairs and tables. Was delighted to see a projector playing the India vs South Africa test match.

When I entered around 01:05 p.., the buffet was still being placed. After a waiting of 10 minutes, it finally started. I had veg noodles soup which was delicious.

Starters included Veg cispy Bon Bon. Knowing that I am a pure vegetarian, the curteous attendant Sumit arranged a couple of more veg starters for me. Special thanks to 
him, I was also served crispy veg baby corn and some Chinese starter consisting of vegetables (don't know thy name). On request, I was provided a superb green chutney. 

However, my delights ended with the end of starters and start of main course. Pretty ordinary main course - to say. I had kadhai paneer with capsicum (which was nice), mix veg (pretty ordinary), palak ki dal (blatantly cold - as if prepared an hour back), naans (good), steamed basmati rice (good), papads and salad. Although, the dal  was not upto the mark, I still had it because it was the only liquid gravy available. Steamed rice mixed with dal and paneer tasted nice with salads and papads.  
For desserts, I had mishti doi (very nice and fresh), barfi (just ok), pastry (good) and chhena poro (average). Unhappy to see that no ice creams were available  
(at least, vanilla should have been)!

They had a decent spread of non-veg items as well as a bar.

Waiting time is quite high as I believe there is not too much footfall at this place - so, only limited preparations are made.I had to wait some 10-12 minutes for a  
second helping of naans and some 6-8 minutes for a second helping of pastry.

However, service quality is commendable and staff try to meet all your expectations.
Ambience is decent and decor is also good.

Overall, a nice experience.

I went for a formal lunch and was overwhelmed by the food they served us. We went for the buffet and their was the bhetki sorshe....a must try for all foodie. The bhetki shorshe was fabulous. The ambience, the behavior of the waiters are all very calm and good. As indismart hotel gives training to students of IIHM, many of the students are often serving food and that makes the behavior of the staff lot better. On the whole a perfect dining as well as lunch family restaurant with not much taxation on your pocket. Considering the quality of food they serve and located at the heart of the IT hub of the city, the cost is very minimum and OK. Looking forward towards my next visit.

Its said that breakfast is the best meal of the day, couldn't agree more to it while my stay at Indismart hotel. Cozy comfortable hospitable and warm would be the right way to put it. Been a hater for oats, but for the awesomely sumptuous breakfast, masala oats were never this delicious. Cusine spread across different tastes(not to miss the muffins and donuts) stand out from any other breakfast buffet. Personal favorite: Cherry pancake+Chicken liver sauté.
Keep spreading the happiness guys, you got to my heart big-time!

Visited this place today with family. Came to know about the place through groupon only. I would say if you are a real foodie and have been visiting places,  you would be disappointed with the overall quality. The buffet spread was ok, but the flavour in almost everything was missing. The desserts were hopeless. So were the starters. The main course had a few palatable items like hinger Kachori, chana dal n Chingri malai curry, which helped us complete the meal. The staff I found were very courteous n cooperating. But that's not enough for me to consider a revisit to the place.

As soon as we (Me and a friend of mine) entered Xspicy on the second floor of the Indismart Hotel, we were greeted with a warm Subho Soshthi. I was pretty impressed by their hospitality at an instant and they maintained a very warm behavior throughout which I think is a really good positive point about the restaurant. 

We were welcomed with a drink which was called Basil and Gondhoraj Refresher and it was truly refreshing. The flavours of the Basil and Gondhoraj gave the perfect kick to my tastebuds and I loved it a lot. 

Soon, we were served the starters. For the vegetarian part, we had the Kashmiri Chop which was quite delicious, but I would have loved it even more with some Kasundi. For all the Non vegetarians, The topshe fry is a must try and it is really very tasty. The murgir mangshor chop is yet another good option for non veg starters. 

While we were being served our main course dishes, we had a plate of panchmeshali bhaja served right infront of us. That actually made me happy, firstly the way it was presented looked really organised and beautiful and secondly, all my favorite bhajas were a part of that. The steamed rice, paired with the Sabzi dal and bhaja was a complete bliss. I also loved the Moti Polao, which had those pretty little motis 
made of cottage cheese just enhanced the flavors. It was very well paired with the Darbari Paneer. 
The range of vegetarian food items was great. Being a hard core non vegetarian, I generally skip the veg dishes but I was blown away by the Aloo Dumurer Ghonto and the Posto Chichinge, 
Among the Non Vegetarian Items, the chingri rokomari, shorshe katla and the thakurbarir mangsho were amazing. And just to bring a change in taste, there was a Chicken Vinhalo.
Overall it was a very pleasant experience.

Located it the most rising and developing area of kolkata with parking no issue and easy to go with Located inside a hotel with ambience from outside looks great but inside xspicy which is on the 2nd floor is just average ... 
I tried buffet there. Place was empty that to on a sunday..
Items limited in starters main course or even desert.
Fish i found was good in both starter n main course. Chicken was spicy as the name says xpicy starters all were spicy.
I had paneer tikka in starter n fish fingers both tasty.
Food is nice but main course items are limited and deserts are not that great i just liked the ice cream ..
Yum factor is still missing in the food , needs improvements.
Staff was good and decent.
Price is ok but same price you can get better in kolkata.
No reason to recommend this but if nothing on the cards this can be tried...
If my review was helpful do comment or like.

On a Monday evening,we went to Xspicy for a dinner date, a part of experimenting with various restaurants which are not very popular yet. Since it was a Monday evening,the restaurant,to much of our delight was not crowded at all. We had a comfortable place to sit. However,on a Saturday/Sunday there might be a chance of the place appearing a bit dingy,something that we cannot associate with a 4 star experience.However,one cannot complain about the cleanliness of this place. Even the washroom was perfectly clean.
Shed aside this insufficiency and come to the other most essential part. This space is a diner's delight. We went for the buffet. They had us at the starters. They were eager to serve us without being over enthusiastic. All the starters(fish,vegetable,chicken and paneer) were so good that one may wish to have them for inner without even trying the main course. The buffet spread offered a good variety of food items.It was satisfying to the tummy and the tongue. We felt special when they served us Chilli Chicken in the main course and Gulab Jamun and Mishti Doin in desserts right in our table,even though it was not a part of the buffet. This gesture was sweet on the part of their efficient and courteous staff. The beer that came along wit the deal,added to our merriment.We will soon be back,with family and friends.

Worst menus ever.Food quality is too bad. Non veg items are very few. Buffet price is too much for the menu which is served. Would have given 0 if I could.

Decent place. Unlike other restaurants, starters are not that good, although I liked the chilly fish, chilly chicken and chicken kababs were not good. But, the main course was quite good, matar paneer, naan, fish, jeera rice and dal were upto the mark.
Dessert was also good, except the apple tarts.
Doi was the best among all of them!
Ambiance and service were very good :)
Overall, a more than decent experience.

This restaurant is indismart hotel's. Opp to globsyn building. The entrance since is of a hotel looks above average. Then u enter xspicy n boy it's shabby. Not good for dinner dates. The place gives a awkward feel owing to the decor n maintainence. Coming to food I wasn't experimental, ordered schezwan chow Hakka n garlic chicken. Unexpectedly, they tasted good. Loved the quantity n chicken portions in them. Would have given a completely satisfying n encouraging review had the place beckoned even for a bit. But alas! Will order take away for sure.

This is one of the finest place to hang out with friends and family. This is a 4 star hotel with a lovely Restrurant cum Bar. The buffet has a wide spread and it is very farely priced.
The food is also finger licking with a spontaneous and courteous service.
They are very famous for there themed food festivals.
A must visit place for those who loves to eat.

We went to celebrate a farewell party here,opted for dinner buffet.

The  buffet was in very cheap rate,but the food was great.There were lots of options in buffet menu which was quite surprising,if compared to price.

Food was good,both non-veg and veg items were tasty,few of them though wasn't as per expectations.

I loved their desert,it was yummuy.

Overall,good food at good price and a decent decoration.

Buffet spread is minimal.. Only one veg & one non-veg starter.. You have to wait infinitely to get the starters.. You also have to wait in front of the main course counters and repeatedly ask the waiters to refill.. Service is a disaster..

We were some 30 odd people who went for a dinner buffet at X-Spicy, it being quite near to our office. Won't say that all the foods were great, but few of them were quite good, specially the Thai Chicken Curry and Chicken Curry. The Dry Chilli Chicken was a disappointment.... It seemed the chef used only the bones to prepare it instead of the flesh - It was so pathetically bony. Jeera Rice was standard but what I liked the most was the Pineapple Mousse.... But, the service was not good compared to the price they charged. It was taking quite some time for the food to get refilled.

I would probably not recommend X-Spicy, instead, should suggest for other options at Saltlake Sector V if you are planning for a buffet lunch/dinner with your friends/colleagues.

I'd been to this place for a friend's birthday treat. It was the first time for all of us, even for the birthday girl. We were not sure of the restaurant's quality but we were not disappointed. We opted for the buffet. It had a decent spread. The starters were a little weak but the main course made up for that. The dessert section was not elaborate but they served 2 delicious desserts, the strawberry mousse cake and Gajar ka halwa.
Overall, the experience was good and wouldn't hesitate to recommend people to visit this place.

Given proximity from my office, many official meetings and gatherings of our office are held there. I work in a public sector organisation which has a tie up with this hotel. The food is below average and a strict "no no" for the price they charge. I understand that its run by students of a hotel management school and wonder how come the service is so unmanaged. God knows what kind of professionals they prepare. Let me describe what we faced in a dinner at Indismart today evening;-

As we approached the buffet spread, I find naan/ roti is under the process of making abd yet to be served. I opted for the salad and when I returned in 45 secs, the first lot of roti was exhausted. Around 5-7 rotis arrived which evaporated as soon as it was served. After 10mins of holding the plate, I was blessed with a quarter naan as four of oir colleagues could secure only one naan. 
There was such a scarce of roti  that we ended up with a half naan as dinner. The side dishes were served adequately which acted as our filler. In dessert section, sweets were exhausted. May be 20 sweets were kept for 50 people and were expected to share. We had to manage with the ice cream only. 
With this level of professionalism, its only good marketing and corporate tie ups thats running this hotel.

Went for a team dinner. Buffet was a combo of Chinese and Indian. Food quality is good. Has scope of improvement. Service staff are too slow to handle requests, need to be trained better. Ambience is good. Have heard from my friends ...food is very good...not sure if my expectations were high or was it one off the days were food was nice. Will have to try again ...

Tugged inside one of the by-lanes of this street (behind State Bank of India, Sector V branch) you have the Indismart hotel. XSpicy is one of the restaurants of this hotel.

We went there on a weekday at around 1:00pm (there were eleven of us). The restaurant was quite empty with only one group eating at a corner. However, within about 30 minutes, all the seats were taken and the restaurant was buzzing with activity. We decided to try out their buffet.

The buffet started with a mocktail which was served at the table. The mocktail was made up of sweet syrup, mango crush and cold drinks (most probably 7up). Next we had choices of starters:
1. Pasta (special attraction was a live pasta counter).
2. Carrot and corriander soup.
3. Choices of breads
4. Chilly fish dry
5. Corn bon bon
6. Achari Aloo
7. Chicken tikka.

The starters were sort of standard. I would have liked them to be a bit more warm/hot.

The main course consisted of:
1.Roti
2.Plain Steam rice
3.Matar Polao
4.Daal panch mal - this was awesome. The taste was exceptionally good.
5.Paneer butter masala
6.Dum aloo
7.Gobi tomato - The gobi definitely needed more cooking
8.Goan fish curry
9.Chicken kasha
10.Curd rice
11.Pickle chatni

Overall, the taste was good. Some of the dishes were standard in taste. Chicken kasha was really good and I really liked it.
The desert consisted of: 
1.Malpua
2.Apple pie
3.Pineapple mousse

I really liked the dessert. They were tasty. The mousse was exceptional and very well done.

The cost of buffet in this restaurant is Rs.418 + VAT + Service Tax which comes to somewhere near Rs.500. Considering the cost, I think there could be better options if we pay another 100 bucks. One would get much more wider range of buffet menu item choices in other restaurants.
Also, the staff needs to be better trained. For example, everytime they cleaned the plates, they took away additional items like glass of water, disposal plates, additional spoons etc. So every time we went for taking food, we had to come back to the table and get hold of the cutlery and other items by calling the staff. Overall, good restaurant, but could be better.

Good food, suited my taste very much. Non veg starters were good, especially the starter with chicken. Veg starters were not that good. Crispy babycorn was not that crispy. You wont get too many options in starters, just 2 veg and 2 non veg. Main course is decent enough. Pasta was horrible. But it was gajar ka hlawa in dessert that made my day. Just yummy. Staff was busy attending to some marriage ceremony in he banquet hall below. So we had to literally shout out for their attention. Overall a very decent restaurant.

I have been to this place twice.. the last was during Durga puja (ashtami) and there buffet was confined to bengali cuisine.. It was too elaborate starting from shona moonger dal n paanch rokomer bhaja to mourala maccher chochchori, chitol maacher muithya, chingrir malaikari, pabda maccher jhaal, kochi pathar jhol, gondhoraaj chicken. there was also a mongolian live counter..Chilli chicken was also there in the spread which was although lipsmackin but i don't know how that came under the bengali cuisine..However, the dessert was equally good- mango tart, chocolate cake and many more.... lastly the dark chocolate paan was simply out of the world...The best part is when the bill came. It was just 525 bucks for this whole spread..I must say the quality and taste of the food was really great and service was very warm..I would suggest its a must visit for all the FOODIES like me..

It is a restaurant in Indismart Hotel.
It is nice and people are very friendly. 
Food is good with reasonable price.
However variety is very low. They should come up with innovation in food preparations.

Pathetic  restaurant. Have been to this place 2 times. In my first visit i had buffet  which was of complete waste of money and time. I had to go again as i had an invite from my friend, this  time we bought a deal in snapdeal which is around 650 with unlimited drinks and food(for 2 hours). I REQUEST FOLKS NOT TO GO UNLESS  YOU REALLY WANT TO ADD A BAD REVIEW THE NEXT DAY LIKE ME. We hardly had  3 repeats(30 ml) and food was coming after 45 mins. We complained the same to duty manager out their and he advises we follow this way on snapdeal orders. We ended up before  2 hours and were really wanted to get out of that  place before getting CHEATED. 

I have been their  yesterday and my stomach aches today ! I wish i did not go their .

It was another occasion of our team celebration. The food here is good. But the taste is not too good but good only. We expected pretty high,but its not matched our expectation. however, the ambiance was good. On that day, there was india vs eng match.We enjoyed cricket as well in big screen. 

The service standard needs to be improved. I know, that young students are being experimented there, but from these days, they have to show their talent. The quality of food and service should pump up so as to attract people. 

I think my suggestions are going to be handy. I am really looking forward to have a visit along with my team.

Made a sudden plan to visit this restro. We opted the buffet lunch and it was a quite good buffet for such a low price of only Rs. 330 including tax. There is no separate option for starter and main course. So we started with Chicken Soup. There was a Tomato Soup also. There were two types of rice and then the veg items. Daal Maharaniwala was just mouth watering so was the Paneer Dalna and Alu Potol ar Rosha. Mixed veg was fantastic. There were couple of more veg items too but I didn't check it. Ok now come to the non veg part where there were Ruhi Fish, Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala and another prawn item. Although the prawns were not too big but it was too tasty and creamy. Fish and chicken dishes were mouth watering too. There were about 5 types of salads and at the desert section there were cake, Kheer and ice cream. The Kheer was just heavenly wonderful and full of kaju and pistas. The ambience of this restaurant is admirable which is just perfect for a date with your partner or for ganging out with friends or group lunch. The warm welcome and the nice behavior of the staffs made us feeling special. Service is extremely good so is their behavior and mostly the quality of food. To conclude I must say its a must visit restro for all the food lovers ok Kolkata and they will be surely happy when find the pocket pinch is just perfect according the food.

You won't know if this is a restaurant until you enter. It is on the 1st or 2nd floor of the Indismart Hotel. It is spread out on a big area with comfortable seating. The buffet here is always a surprise. It comprises of Chinese, Indian and Continental. So if you start off with a soup, save your tummy cause there are plenty of items to follow, none of which can be left alone. So just go pick your favorite cuisine or make a mix and match on your platter. I personally found the mutton/ lamb items to be good. There is this complimentary drink which I did not enjoy that much and also the dessert is below par. The best part is when you receive the cheque. You'll be surprised am sure as no other restaurant provides buffet at such cheap prices. Fast for the entire morning and then go for 'Xspicy' and you will return satiated.
