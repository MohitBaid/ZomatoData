This Halidram outlet is huge and the seating area is huge as well unlike the one near Exide .
You may visit this place with a couple of friends or your family .The outlet is just in the main road hence easily viewable .
I recommend all my vegetarian friends to visit this place for the variety of food and sweets available at this place .

We visited this place during our winter vacation in Kolkata. This is a wonderful vegetarian joint which probably has the best variety of food - snacks, meal, desserts and sweets. It even has some Chinese option and they are quite yummy too. The main attraction of this place is the amount of space. It is spreaded over two floors and each floor is like a football field. My daughter just could not stop running around the place. All the food options are of wonderful taste but some of them needs special mention - Chole Batura, Samosa, Dahi Vada, Chinese combo meal and faluda with icecream. The music is good, ambience wonderful and the price is reasonable. It is a self-service joint and people at the counters are courteous. The only negative we can think of is the delay is order processing if the food is not ready at the counter. We ordered a Chinese combo meal which was delivered quite late. But we enjoyed the wait as the other options were delivered over the counter. I would give a 4.5 for this place.

This is my go-to place for tasty veg cravings...

I have had food at both the Ballygunge as well as Camac Street outlets... both of them are very spacious. Ambiance is fine...and the quality of food served here is top notch.

My favourites here are Pav Bhaji and the Thalis...specially the Special Thali...very filling.
Raj Kachori..Chola Bhatura and Dosas are also nice...Pizza is small and taste is okayish...Had tried the milk shake with ice cream...it was thick but didn't taste that good.
Overall a very good place to have vegetarian food...Prices are not very low but fair enough for the quality :)

One of the biggest amongst the completely vegetarian outlets in Kolkata and very popular amongst people who does not mind having standard vegetarian fare at an affordable price. We had masala dosa...served with ubiquitous coconut chutney and sambhar. Quality is just run of the mill, but sufficient when you need a quick bite...

Sometimes we have a great craving for street food but don't wanna compromise the comfort of the restaurant. This place is a perfect example of such description. A mammoth 2 storied building have a variety of option to satisfy your cravings.
Tried their samosa chaat, paav bhaji, rajkochuri & chocolate milkshake.
The later two are recommended.
Apart from this they serve chole bature, dosa, & different chaat options are also available. The prices are expectedly on the higher side regarding the quantity, but worth it as you can spend as much hours as you can there. Perfect for group chitchat over food or with loved ones.
P.S.: They have options for chinese combo too, but to be noted they serve only veg. GST is applicable accordingly.

A pure veg restaurant from the house of a major sweets and snacks manufacturer. The chinese combo meal compromising of hakka noodles,salad,fried rice, chili potato and veg manchurian is worth a try. The desserts section is huge with an array of sweets and confectionary items. The Balushai was really good, but the famous 'Gulab Jamun' was a tad too sweet.The truffle pastry was awesome. However service can definitely be improved.

A place to be for quality veg food ( snacks to be specific). The brand haldiram never compromise with quality. Been their exide outlet many times but ballygunge outlet is my first time today. And when in Haldiram chhole-bhature is a must order item. Apart from chhole bhature I like their club kachori and dahivada. Lassi is another must order item in summer time. Thali options are also good. I liked this place better as this one is not as noisy as exide outlet. And the seats beside glasswall will give you a very nice view. There is no waiting for table as they have ample space and more tables than exide haldiram .

One of the best and reasonable vegetarian joints in Kolkata for hanging out with Family and Friends. Staring with snacks to Chaats to Fillers to South-Indian to Chinese to Sandwiches to Pizzas to Indian Thalis everything is available here. Based on one‚Äôs preference one can feast on whatever one likes.   The ambience is good and very spacious too. The coupon system works fine and is convenient too. I really love their Masala Dhosa and Chinese combo meal (Fried rice/Chow/Veg Manchurian/Chilli Potato and salad). The Chinese combo meal and a plate of Masala Dhosa are sufficient for 2 people‚Äôs lunch/dinner. A very pocket-friendly and cheerful place for dining.

I never visited this place personally. My mom had a pre-diwali reunion with her friends, so she got a chola batura platter packed for me. 
It's worth mentioning that although the packaging was fantastically sealed from all sides yet some contents spilled out:(
Coming to food...no doubts why haldiram is so famous for these stuff...pure ghee chola batura it was..for a person like me who pukes at the smell of ghee...this pure ghee chola batura had the flavour n softness but no strong smell of ghee...n I thank haldiram's for such expertise!! Will pay a visit soon:))

I won't talk much about its sweets as they are well known among people. Their cakes are soft and creamy too. The first floor consist of the food court.

Chinese combo meal- it has the chowmein, rice,veg Manchurian,coleslaw.

This place is quite underrated. On the lower floor, you have a shop which sells all kinds of sweets, and confectionery and other items from Haldiram. The upper floor is a huge, spacious food court.
This is the perfect place for VEGETARIANS, and they even have some options which are VEGAN (you have to check-some may contain dahi, gluten etc which are animal byproducts and hence non-vegan).
This is my favourite hangout since I turned Vegan for the animals, I request every non-vegetarian on Zomato to go out there at least once and check out all the amazing, nutritious food that vegetarians or vegans enjoy. You may just save a few lives which have the equal right to live. LIVE VEGAN!

I went there with family and we ate Raj Kachori chat, Sada vada, Chinese Bhel, Kulfi and phuchka. There was a nominal queue for the chat counters but service was fast. Overall a good place to have good quality veg snacks.

The biggest Haldiram outlet spanning over 2 storeys , the ground floor for sweets and 1st floor for savoureys.
There are a variety of snacks, street food and thalis available. The quality of food hardly ever falters.
Their Kulfi falooda , Raj Kachori Chaat, Samosa, Dahi Vada, Chole bature and other chaats are both easy on the pocket as per restaurant standards, and super tasty.
They even have pasta and Chinese thali, which are okayish.
The only complaint I have is the paneer kofta in the Indian thali being sour on one of my visits.
Haldiram is a welcome change for non-vegetarians who can't get themselves to go to veg diners. Love the spaciousness and self-service system.

Haldiram Food City is a decent place for vegetarians. If you are out with your family, you can definitely visit this place for an affordable lunch/dinner or evening snack.

We went there after our first round of pandal-hopping on Ashtami noon around 1 PM. We were a group of eight people and luckily found an eight seater at a cozy corner of the restaurant.

The food is good but nothing to write home about. We ordered Shahi thalis, chinese combo meals, Chhole bhature, dhoklas and Coke. 

The shahi thali is quite filling. We really loved the simple salad in the Chinese meal which had fresh, cruncy vegetables- red cabbage, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers. The dhoklas were amazingly soft and moist. If you are a dhokla lover, you might not be able able to stop at one plate, because we couldn't!

Finally, the cons-
There was no one to bring the orders to tables, we had to carry our trays all the way to our table. (Self service). This might not bother some people, but the place is so big, if you suddenly realise that your water bottle is empty or you just want one extra roti, you have to stop eating midway and go all the way to the counter. It's good if someone else does that for you, but nobody likes to get up to fetch something while eating his/her meal at a restaurant, right?

Pocket pinch-
Slightly less than INR 1000 for 8 people.

I've been to Haldiram a million times before and we always opt for its super delicious dosa or the chinese combo meal. We've tried almost every item that this place has to offer and we keep coming back for more. 

However, today there was a Rajasthani buffet (@ Rs 349 + GST) and i must say, i was surprised by how good it was. I've uploaded all the pictures of the sumptuous food along with this post. The urad dal puri and the dal halwa were always in high demand. Even the stuffed aloo dum was amazing. If i had to talk about each and every item that was offered today, this post would turn out to be an essay. Yes, the food was that good. 
And to put the cherry on the top, we went to the upper floor to have kulfi, which is a must if you're visiting this place.

This sprawling outlet is surely in its decline now.
I have been an ardent supporter of Haldiram for more than a decade now. But the service at this outlet is not only poor but also invested with a false notion of self-gratification that can eventually result to a great fall.
I have always been extremely disgusted with the long wait that the people servicing at the counters makes you go through. Why declare yourself open if individual units are yet to be operational? But today they performed a deed which was severely unethical, to say the least.
I had ordered a plate of Chole Batura at 1 this afternoon, only to receive two pieces of Batura and a bowl of Chole Masala after a gruelling wait of 20 minutes at the counter in a situation where there was nothing more than a dozen or two customers at the premises. When to my utter surprise, I pointed out that this order is incomplete as it has been customary at Haldiram's to incorporate Dum Aloo, pickle and fresh onion to this dish, my query gathered no response. On further interrogation, the concerned employee at Counter A stated that stocks have been exhausted by 12 noon. This made me enquire of any management personnel who might be in a position to explain such discrepancy. Consequently, I was asked to wait for another 5 minutes, after which two pieces of pickled potato was served to me in an aluminium foil.
I consider that not being able to provide the service which one is entitled to after prior payment of the complete amount is a violation of the rights that the consumer is vested with.
This concern must mend its way or face serious consequences hereafter.

I had went there for a dinner with my family.. The first thing I noticed upon entering was how the whole food court had a shabby and dirty look... From food littered on the floor to food on few tables and chairs too.. This was not the case when I had previously visited the place on numerous occasions. I would urge the management to look into it.

Food:

So we had ordered Phuckas which were decent. Next up was Cheese‚Äã Grilled Sandwich. It was oversalted and by a lot. We had to ask them to give us a new plate as it was not edible.. And they did, upon hearing our case. Then we ordered the Nan Thali which consisted of 1Butter Nan, Dal Makhani, Palak Paneer, Peas Pulao, Pickles and Onion.. The overall taste was blant.. with negligible amount of salt. Peas Pulao however was the best thing of that platter. We lastly ordered the Chinese Combo Meal.. It had Fried Rice, Chowmein, Veg Manchurian, Chilli Potato and a Salad.. This had a good taste overall.. But the only let down was the salad, which was pretty good earlier.. The combination of Fried rice - Chilli Potato works pretty well.. Rest of the two dishes also tasted good. Overall it was an extremely average dinner and left us disappointed.

Service:

The service is good. The staff are well behaved and are co-operative in matters of customizing your orders.

Ambience:

Haldiram's has a great ambience to enjoy your meal, whether its with your friends or family or by yourself. The food court approach is what that has appealed to people for so long and will continue to do so.

Haldiram food City located at Ballygunge is a pretty favourite place for everyone. Located opposite the BITM , this place is a must visit for trying out the south Indian as well as for Chole Bature , Pav Bhaji , there special combo Chinese meal. Apart from that they serve a lot of variety like the chat section where you can have different types of chats , the pizza section where the vegetarian burger are available. So Haldiram has got a lot to offer to the vegetarians as well as to those who love to experiment .

Overview is wil not b visitng again if found wid some other option.. bad service .. no customer value as we are forcing the counter people to work provide us food for free.. 
Visited for lunch with my friend for lunch. Ordered special thali. Left wid only 3 options i.e. gatta, kofta and palak paneer for sabji .. ordered palak paneer n kofta n butter naan.. now butter naan was gud.. but wat we found is palak paneer has less number of paneer cubes than gutta mixed in it. Wat a way to fool customers.. further ordered lassi and it was thick and extra sweet.. bad experience..

Absolutely tasteless Palak Paneer is served in the rumali roti platter. Bland and running gravy... The rumali roti itself is very chewy though served hot. Chola Bhatura and Pasta are the best stuff no doubt.. But donot try their Rumali Roti thali at any cost..

Located near Birla Mandir, Ballygunge Phari, this is a huge food court which is very easy to locate; very clean and well maintained. It offers you a variety of sweets, chocolates, food. Dosa to chola bhatura,  puchka to dahi vada, that defines it's range of food choices I guess. It's a veg food court so you'll get numerous kinds of veg dishes here. Haldiram products are found too as the name says. It is a family restaurant where people of all ages can be seen. Overall, I'd say that this place is pretty cool.

This place serves good vegetarian food and has an amazing ambience located near ice skating rink. We were a group of 5 and ordered chhole bhature , pav bhaji , dosa , idli and one meal. All these tasted pretty well but the chhole bhature was the best among the lot which is served with aloor dum and a decent amount of salad . Overall a very nice experience. :)

It is a good place to hangout with family.Food options are varied, starting from chats,phucka to chinese and Indian main course dishes.Not to foget the speciality,the mouth watering sweets.The Indian and chinese combo meals were good.The packaging was done with great effort.However the chinese combo meal was a bit more filling than the Indian one.The veg pizza was tasty with the right amount of crunch.

I really loved my experience at Haldiram Food City. It's a huge and sprawling space, really well decorated and weLL illuminated. The food is of good taste and quality but the quantity is a bit on the lesser side. We had ordered Pure Ghee Chole Bhature, Veg Pasta in White Sauce and Strawberry Milkshake. I would definitely like to come back to this place for trying other dishes, especially the Thalis.

During my college days this used to me my adda place and I was there almost everyday so I have tasted everything from their limited menu hence a generic review- This place is clean, food is hygienic, made in ghee, quantity is apt as far as per person portion is concerned, staff is friendly and cordial. Their must try is Chole Bhature, Raj Kachori, Masala Dosa, Jalebis, Gulab Jamun. The dessert section downstairs is also worth a visit. Overall a pocket friendly brand and outlet (except the sweets ;))

Just drop in there to try some food. Nice food. Great option for the vegetarians. Chaats are awesome. Had tried the rajkachori, it's was damn huge ball. Full of spice, equally balance of flavours. Dosa was equally good and the dips were just expectational. 
Just a suggestion if u guys can increase the beverage part it will really helpful.
Otherwise this place is always busy.

Haldiram food City one of the popular destinations for those, who loves Veg food. The food junction located bear the Ice Skating Rink, Ballygunge. Been there few days ago after a hectic day schedule.
They offers huge varieties of Sweet, laddo, snacks as well as Chinese, South Indian cuisine and also some quick bite item like Chat, Phuckha etc. The restaurant is 100% Veg, so for Non veg lovers like me, it might be difficult to choose the item. 

I ordered One Chinese Combo Meal and one Samosha Chat. 

The chat was mainly a smashed samosha, with steamed potatoes, chole etc as add on items. The chat itself is good but the chutney the served, make it more 'Chatpata' and moth watering. Overall tastes good. 

Now come to the main item, which is my all time personal favorite, Chienese Combo Meal. The meal includes Veg Noodles, Chilly Manchurian, Chilly Potato, Veg fried rice and Salad. All tastes good and the quantity is good for filling your empty yummy. 

With all the food mentioned above, it costs around 180INR, which is pretty decent amount . Haldiram is mainly famous for its Sweet, but come here and have their combo meal and South Indian items, I hope you will surely love it. Overall good dining experience.

The building is a beauty. The food is good and really pocket friendly. Though it's not really that up my radar but if you're looking for filling light food, at extremely affordable place, you've come to the right place. I'd recommend the Chola Bhatura and Chaat. Very nice!

I happened to visit this outlet of Haldiram‚Äôs during one of my older visits to Kolkata as a tourist - that was the time when I was yet to move to the City of Joy. Those time even Zomato ceased to exist. I was a kid back then and was very happy to visit it.

On my recent visit to the place, I spent time solely buying stuffs from the ground floor which deals in stuffs like sweets, cakes, chocolates and other food gifting ideas.

The place is spread over a large area - the upper floor is the food court where you get all kinds of vegetarian dishes, the ground floor is where all the packed items are sold.

I have memories of trying dhosa out here and recently tried their kaju barfi which was neatly done.

I have been to this place quite a number of times. I like the place because it is a huge one and the inside is very glittery and shiny and bright! Although I am not a big fan of vegetarian food, still I like haldiram because of its wide range of choices. According to me you must try their cheese pasta.. It's really yummy and the cheese pizza and sandwich as well! And yes I love their CHINESE BHEL. You must try this one. The thalis are good. If you are hungry you can go for it. The quantity is fine. Here it is self service. The prices are reasonable.

Raj Kachori
Chhole Bhature ( the quality has degraded a little though now)
Chinese Combo- very affordable and super yummy
Indian Nan Combo- Good quantity and creamy veggies! 
We love to go to Haldirams and its our first pick for a quick, delicious and affordable meal!

Bought a packet of Soan Papdi from Haldiram's. The soan papdi that you get here is quite different from the ones you get from a sweet shop. These are less sweet, honestly speaking. They give you a spoon inside the packet which helps in cutting the pieces since the pieces coalesce together. Haldiram's should seriously try to improve their soan papdis.

If you or in the mood for quality and variety vegetarian food, Haldiram Food City is the place. It has everything, from sweets to savory snacks and meals. I love the meals. My favorite is the luchi cholar daal. Being a bong, I love the Cholar Daal which tastes just like the authentic bengali homemade daal. The dosas are very popular too and rightly so. My favorite sweet on this earth is Haldiram's ladoos. I am obsessed with the ladoos that smell of pure ghee.

Good food doesn't always have to be non vegetarian, and the Haldiram's outlet at Ballygunge is a perfect example for that. I've been there twice and I've been blown away by the food both times. The ground floor serves small snacks and sweets, in addition to separate stalls for candies, chocolates adn ice cream, while the top floor serves heavier dishes like pav bhaji, chole bhature and a variety of chaats. The extremely falvourful and filling Raj Kachori Chaat has become a big favourite of mine. The value for money here is also excellent. I will definitely be revisiting this place again and again to savour the rest of their delicacies.

If you are looking a place to chat, to eat or to celebreate something with your friends or family. Haldiram is a good place. Just Indian taste. And very cheap. Although some food is spicy like Chinese combo and a little bit the Masala Dosa. My favorites Thali or chola bhatura.

Yummy veg food. What else do u need on a Saturday after office. When you are really Hungry. The multi storied outlet is one of the largest in the city. They have an exquisite array of Rajasthan's delights in both sweets and Savoury items. 

Tried the Nan Thali . Quantity was good. Quality is a given when you are at Haldirams. Located opposite to the iconic Birla Mandir. This place is a must visit if you are locality.

I have been to haldiram's this outlet many times and trust me I was satisfy with the food items whatever I  tasted. 
No wonder it is quite famous for the sweets but apart from sweet other items is also very good and tasty, one should go and try. 
Some other say its bit costly but I would say food is worth the price they charge. 
So recommended from my end.

I think this is the largest Haldiram outlet in Calcutta with the entire 3 or 4 floored building.
The ground floor is mainly confectionery, sweets and bakery with variety of chocolates and candies to choose from.
From the next floor starts all the food.
I like their chaats. Do not ever go for the gol gappas here.
For some heavy food I like their Chhola Bhatura. My favourite is the Pav Bhaji here.
I always order their Malai Lassi. Tried the kesar lassi once but didn't like it.
If you're a vegetarian then it's a good place with such a wide range of food all under one roof.

I always wanted to try this place and so finally I gave my first visit yesterday. We had chinese combo and rajkachori. Chinese was average, nothing special, the food is already prepared in bulk so you won't get it warm. Rajkachori was very good and a perfect chaat. The most impressive fact is that they provide quality food at decent price.

COST' WISE" speaking ..no matter what you consume it will be easy on your pocket!

My pick: Phuchkaa (served with two classic khatta- meetha- teekha paani),Dhokla,Chinese platter ,Rumali thali or Naan thali (you will like it provided you manage to finish the ¬†NAAN ¬†before it assumes a state which makes chewing ¬†difficult) ,gulab jamun ,kulfi......a range of patisserie and Farsan to take home!

My suggestion : Peek in and Pick!!

Involvement of staff is null as they follow the self-service technique (you have to serve yourself).. All of their items are made up of pure ghee so if you are not enough health conscious like me then go ahead and believe me you will not get disappoint...

Looking forward for more visits...:)

This place and its price hikes. 
There was a time when coming to Haldiram was a big deal, for its pocket friendly food and the tag name it holds. 
However I feel now that almost everything they serve is here has become too mainstream, in terms of taste as well. Be it the chhola bhatura or the raj kachori or the kulfi.. you can get better of these elsewhere. Sorry, you guys need changes.

Near Quest Mall, this big food mall stands high. The ground floor has the bakery and sweets section, the second floor has a well decorated restaurant and the third floor has the food court. 

I visited this food court with my family during pujas, hence the place was well lit up with good decorations. You strictly get veg food over here with a lot of variety. 

Coming to what we tried :

Phuchka. ( Good)
Masala Chai.( Amazing)
Pav Bhaji. ( Great to taste. A must try)
Plain Paper Dosa. ( Crisp and tasty)
Chola Bhatura. ( Must try)
Veg Margherita  pizza. ( Okayish, could have been much better.)
Chinese thali.( This dish is a big disappointment. Everything in the thali is tasteless.)
Gulab Jamun. ( Warm and fresh)

Altogether a place with good ambience and food( leaving few items). Price is really pocket friendly. Service is pretty fast. A good place to grab a snack. Kindly improve the quality of the food you provide us with.

It is The place to hang out with friends and enjoy good veg snacks.¬†The ambiance is very nice and the food is mention worthy. Idelicious, i 've had the dahi fuchka, which was very delicious; the dhokla came with a tangy chutney. the veg pizza was cheesy enough and the gulab jamuns were hot and fresh.Overall, the place serves very good food.

It was the first time we visited this place after a visit to quest mall.We decided to have dinner at teekha but as it was fully equipped we were left with no options other than Haldiram Food city.Haldiram is one of the biggest and reputed food chains of India.They have never compromised on their food quality and same goes for this outlet.It is the biggest outlet of Haldiram in Kolkata which is divided in three floors.As you enter the ground floor you will see the whole floor is for purchase of sweets and snacks while 1st floor has a dine-in area with small counter for different cuisines food to order and the 2nd floor consist of "teekha" restaurant and a hall for party and functions.

Service-The service at this place was quite fast and reliable.Inspite of heavy crowd the payment counter where you have to pay and then order food from different cuisine  counter was also working extremely fast.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place was noisy.The interiors are extremely simple but its a good place to hangout if you are running short of money.

Food-The food at this outlet was like any other haldiram outlet.It has still maintain the same taste and you will find extensive variety throughout their outlet.We had-
1:Chola bhatura
2:Raj kachori
3:Masala dosa
4:Gulab jamun
All the items were good but their "Chola bhatura" and "hot gulab jamun" is a must try.

IEver heard of a Food Mall? Or a 4-5 storey¬†building meant just for food? Yes, this is the place I'm talking about. As the name suggests, truly a Food city which is 101% vegetarian.¬†
What have you been looking for? Dhoklas, fafras, theplas, chole bhatura, kesar¬†jalebi, bhujia's¬†or any type of snack or veg dish you can think of, this is the place to get it from.

We got these platters from the Haldirams. Consisted of 2 chole bhaturas, daam¬†aloo, salad and anchaar. I guess the perfect meal for a perfect veg day. The dish was impressively well packed, beautifully cooked and tasted amazing. I loved the food.
Special mention: Dhokla. If you still haven't had a Dhokla from Haldirams. Please do it now. They're amazing.

This one is the largest Haldiram's outlet in the town I guess. Visited this place after going to Birla Mandir. This place is very close to Birla Mandir.
Huge space. Very clean and neatly maintained. A lot of seating arrangement are also there.
You will find here almost all the items that Haldiram's posses. From their very tasty Laddu and Gulab Jamum to Thali dishes serving good veg items.
This place is useful for any occasion, from Breakfast to Lunch or for small snacks or to have ice cream.
Worth visiting and also very pocket friendly.

Went to this place after visiting Quest mall. Since we were looking for very much pocket friendly food options, the outlets in the food court of quest didn't meet the criteria. The first floor is for all kinds of packaged food. The second floor has a sitting area and a restaurant. We could get a Chinese thali for mere 1000 bucks. The food was good, not extraordinary something, but made us full and satisfied in this budget. The sitting arena was extra advantage for us since we did'nt think we would find one at haldiram's.

Spread over two storeys this is a pure vegetarian restaurant. I have tried the Luchi cholar Dal, Chhola Bhatura, Club Kachori sabji. Fried in pure ghee they are very tasty. The chinese combo meal however is average. The best thing of this place is Kesaria Kulfi Faluda. It is one of the best i have tasted , creamy and  served with the right amount of faluda. The pricing is little on the higher side but is considerable as the food quality is brilliant.

Now, if you go by the property size and floor space, surely "Haldiram Food City" at Ballygunge can be claimed as a place equivalent to a gigantic food park, specialized in delicious vegetarian dishes.

Be it a get together, a hangout with friends, or a meetup or a reunion, this place perfectly fits in to any occasion over some gossips, selfies and off course, some yummy bites.

Genuinely good place to walk in, and the "Gulap Jamun" happens to be the must try. In fact they have a wide range of dishes to select from, according to your palate.

Location: If you're coming from Gariahat side, you'll encounter this before Quest mall. A few minutes from Ballygunge phari.

This place is kind of like a Mall. Trust me when I say it is huge. The ground floor and first floor is basic Haldiram's and the top floor is "teekha" bar and restaurant!

Ambience is nice, people of all age groups come here mainly because it's kind of cheap and big groups can be accommodated easily and all since the space is huge.

Food I had:

dhokla : It came with a dark chutney which I didn't like that much. Otherwise it was okay I would say,perfectly moist.

Gulba jamun was really delicious.

The pizzas(95 bucks each) were okay. Nothing special.

The dahi phuchka was good taste-wise. But, texture wise was horrible. The phuchkas were drenched in curd and hence, they turned soggy!¬†

What really bugged me were fountain cokes. 45 bucks!!!!

If you talk about having a good time with friends for a Hang out and full filled adda, Haldiram Food City is the place you can choose for all the Masti. Went there with so many friends of mine for quite a most awaited meet. The dine in is huge in the first floor with so many tables to grab. Live counters are at your service with cash payments and it take mins of time for your stuffs to get prepared.
With the huge group the list was smaller but the quantity was larger. The orders we took were

Dahi Puchka - Dahi puchka was very spicy and flavourful.

Veg cheese Pizza - It contained good amount of cheese in it with soft crust and veggies.

Gulab Jamun - Though i found it not to be fresh at all. It was a little hard.

Dhokla - Wrapped in the red sweet chutney, wat we can say was preloaded. Tasted nice but again average.

Soft drinks for sure - Coke it was.

Overall a very nice place for hang out and fun. Prices are pocket friendly.

Cleanest fuchka in town. Definately good for quick bites. Love their dhosas and pav bhaji too. And it all goes down well with the delicious tea. It's a such a huge place that you host your parties here and on a budget at that.

Now, if you go by the property size and floor space, surely "Haldiram Food City" at Ballygunge can be claimed as a place equivalent to a gigantic food park, specialized in delicious vegetarian dishes.

Be it a get together, a hangout with friends, or a meetup or a reunion, this place perfectly fits in to any occasion over some gossips, selfies and off course, some yummy bites.

Genuinely good place to walk in, and the "Gulap Jamun" happens to be the must try. In fact they have a wide range of dishes to select from, according to your palate.

Recommended.

Location: If you're coming from Gariahat side, you'll encounter this before Quest mall. A few minutes from Ballygunge phari.

This place is kind of like a Mall. Trust me when I say it is huge. The ground floor and first floor is basic Haldiram's and the top floor is "teekha" bar and restaurant!

Ambience is nice, people of all age groups come here mainly because it's kind of cheap and big groups can be accommodated easily and all since the space is huge.

Food I had:

dhokla : It came with a dark chutney which I didn't like that much. Otherwise it was okay I would say,perfectly moist.

Gulba jamun was really delicious.

The pizzas(95 bucks each) were okay. Nothing special.

The dahi phuchka was good taste-wise. But, texture wise was horrible. The phuchkas were drenched in curd and hence, they turned soggy!¬†

What really bugged me were fountain cokes. 45 bucks!!!!

If you talk about having a good time with friends for a Hang out and full filled adda, Haldiram Food City is the place you can choose for all the Masti. Went there with so many friends of mine for quite a most awaited meet. The dine in is huge in the first floor with so many tables to grab. Live counters are at your service with cash payments and it take mins of time for your stuffs to get prepared.
With the huge group the list was smaller but the quantity was larger. The orders we took were

Dahi Puchka - Dahi puchka was very spicy and flavourful.

Veg cheese Pizza - It contained good amount of cheese in it with soft crust and veggies.

Gulab Jamun - Though i found it not to be fresh at all. It was a little hard.

Dhokla - Wrapped in the red sweet chutney, wat we can say was preloaded. Tasted nice but again average.

Soft drinks for sure - Coke it was.

Overall a very nice place for hang out and fun. Prices are pocket friendly.

A big thumsup for the location. Possibly one of the better eating options in the immediate vicinity. This food city outlet is very well planned and relatively more hygienic than its exide counterpart.
Divided between three levels (ground, 1st n 2nd) this food mall houses Haldirams specialities like a vast areas of sweets, bakery products, packed snacks and a good number of options at the food court.
The bakery is all eggless and pastries are decent. 
The snack items worth trying are the chaats like dahi phuchka, papri chat, raj kachoris, 
Dhoklas are average. 
The pizza here is loaded with cheese but lacks in taste.
Chola bhatura and pav bhaji are yummy
 The north Indian combo thalis are average. Chinese combo is relatively better.
They serve club kachoris in the morning and they are worth trying. South Indian options are average.
I love the rasmalai, bundia and kulfi here. The kesaria lassi is also tasty. 

Overall a good place for an Indian breakfast.

This is an appropriate place to relish veg.food. I love this place. They have an array of food- from snacks to full course meal to sweets and desserts too. Pao bhaji and dahi phuckha are my favourite. 
My bestii and i went  to Haldirams to have snacks and walnut brownie. Took chili paneer roll,pasta sandwich(i hope the name is correct) and walnut brownie.

Chili paneer roll- i loved it. Its yummy and tasty. Must try

Pasta sandwich- its ok. Taste was good

Walnut brownie- it was soft and goey kind of. A bit dense i felt. Also a must try

Will visit again.

A brillant place to spent time with friends while munching on good vegetarian food. The whole building is dedicated to food and sweets. The groung food is dedicated to sweets and candies and baked items while the first floor is the food court where an wide array of food is available. We tasted their pizzas, dahi fuchkas, dhoklas and their signature gulab jamuns and liked the food. So next time if you are meeting many frds fix this as yr venue.

Haldiram's is a brand which needs no introduction. It has been there for decades,setting standards in pure veg food and sweets with reasonable rates. This place is huge and spread over two floors. It looks like a food court/lounge and seems clean. Downstairs is mainly for buying sweets and desserts,where as upstairs is where all the food and snacks are available. We had ordered the dahi phuchka, masala dhokla,vegetable pizza and gulab jamun,with a few Cokes. The dahi phuchka was tangy and tasty,as it should be. Each of the phuchkas were of a reasonable size and we quickly gobbled them up before they got soggy. The masala dhokla was smeared in red chutney,and came with green and sweet chutney on the plate. It was soft and I was happy with it. The veg pizza was filled with cheese and veggies on top :-). The gulab jamuns were lovely as always :-)

Though it's not the original "Haldiram's" restaurant but the food quality is good there. Nicely decorated & presented food items gives treat to your eyes & tummy as well. They have wide menu options available from quick munchies to complete main course food.

Located a bit close to Birla Temple & is easily accessible.

This is one place that never lets you down. When other restaurants in the vicinity don't let you in because you don't have a reservation, this place welcomes you with open arms. And there are so many positives in this place. The food is tasty and extremely reasonably priced.  There is always ample space and one doesn't have to wait outside.  The service is  quick and efficient.  You can hang around for a while as there are no waiters to bug you and give you not so subtle hints to leave. The choice of food is simple but even then quite varied because depending on your hunger levels you can go for desserts, snacks or set meals. I tried their Special Thali and it was delicious in taste and satisfying in quantity.

Located near Quest Mall in Ballygunge, I found this 2-storied Haldiram outlet the second best one in this city after the one at VIP road. It is huge with so much space that finding a seat will hardly be a problem except during rush hours. Went there and ordered pav bhaji, mixed sauce pasta, kesaria lassi and chocolate shake with ice cream. Pav bhaji was delicious and so was the pasta. The chocolate shake when served already had the vanilla ice cream melted inside it. It seemed good at the beginning but became sweeter with every sip. Would recommend the staff to look after that.

Anytime when you're hungry and dunno what to eat, go to Haldiram. The food court here has a ton of variety. Granted not all is great. But the live pasta counter is amazing, if you're able to customize it properly. Chinese is a bit underwhelming, but the north Indian, chola bhatura, pizzas etc are fine. The pricing is also reasonable. The sweets and desserts however are not upto the mark and drag down the experience.

Haldiram food quality and taste is very well known, so no question about it .  Excellent food . But what was disappointing was over cleanness of the place was not up to mark and secondly before you find food you have to find a chair ... infact you have to grab or steal a chair. This is something the management could always manage better was really surprised .

Located at ballygunge, this place is a well maintained and decent qsr. Has an escalator to the 2nd floor sitting area, for those who opt to seat and eat meals. The sitting space is huge compared to other haldiram outlets in kolkata. Brightly lit restaurant. 
The best things that i tried here (over time obviously) are gulabjamun, chole bhature, dosa, kesar milk and for fulfilling meals one can look up for chinese combo or the indian combo. For veggie lovers and healthy food one should always opt for this place.

I just love their chole bhature, raj kachori nd gulabjamuns. Although there are many other options that they offer. Somehow today i found the chanar malai (rasmalai) having a rotten smell nd the milk was not that thick that it used to be.

Though not absolutely against Veg food, but, if given a choice, I would definitely settle for a non-vegetarian spread. So, this one evening, a couple of friends dragged me into this magnum settlement to dodge the persistent humidity outside. The place is down right huge and is quite nicely managed. The service is fast, which helps you find your way to a table with food, within moments of entering the place.

While one us decided to settle for a masala dosa which was decent enough, (I have had plenty better at other places), the other settled for a samosa chat. While the first was still borderline impressive, the latter was such a disappointment. The samosa was absolutely cold, with fat crystallizing on top of it. This left us with a buttery and uncomfortably fat smeared top of our mouths. The sambar on the other hand the perfect balance of spicyness and tang, I could have easily had another bowl of it, if possible.

I settled for the veg combo meal, which included the veg hakka noodles and the veg manchurian. The noodles were down right mushy, either over boiled or tampered a lot with when serving to numerous dishes. But the Munchurian was extremely tasty and¬† I was pleasantly pleased with it.

This is one building you can't miss if you are in the area. It's a multi storey building with a Cafe in the ground floor and a self serve food court style joint in the first floor. It's completely veg and the variety is amazing. They have everything from chaat to pastas and pizzas to Chinese combo meals as well as a north Indian combo meal. Their chaats are delicious and I love their raj kachori and Puchkas. Their Chana Batura too is fantastic, Pav Bhaji is excellent. In fact all items are great and tremendous value for money.

We got a good place to sit and ordered for Masala Dosa, Nan Thali, Rumali Thai, Pao Bhaji, Chhola Batura, Gulab Jamun, Kulfi. It was self service i.e. you have to collect your order from the counters. All the dishes more or less tasted good. It is a nice vegetarian food joint to drop in anytime.

Though this place is highly regarded among the city dwellers, my experience was not too god, and hence the rating. The dosas are the best of all items served here (I'm not including sweets in this list). I've been there thrice to taste different items from the menu (I happened to be in Kolkata for three days and resided close to it). The chats and Indian chinese preparations are good. The worst part is the thaali. The quantity is very little and the quality doesn't justify the price.
Do I need to mention sweets are finger licking good ? C'mon you're in Kolkata. However try the gulab jamun, they are amazing here.

Haldiram has never compromised on their quality of food and is just doing the same at the present. This outlet is just huge. One of the biggest outlets of the city. Located just few metres from Ballygunge Phari and Quest Mall this place is paradise for veg food lovers. If you want to have some great food at very reasonable price you dont have to think twice in selecting your destination. Here you would get everything fron starters to combos to desserts. It has been many a times I visited this place and I enjoyed each every time. I am more interested in their sweets and dessert section as they serve high quality stuffs.
There are two sections. The lower section is the dessert section whereas the upper section is the main section for dine in.
A huge place with a ample sitting arrangements.
The food is quite good and never disappoints. I love their Raj Kachori, Masala Dosa, Chinese Thali and Veg Thali.

A definite go to options for Veg Food Lovers.

I think the quality of the food has gone down from earlier.

On a recent visit i ordered for the veg special thali chola bhatura and veg pizza. The pizza was about average and the chola bhatura was about decent. I was really disappointed by the thali though. The rumali roti served was cold and not freshly made. The kofta was too bland and the palak paneer not upto the mark. The only things i liked were the pulao, kali dal and gulabjamun.

The total bill was 600 which is okay but they must improve their quality. Seating was ok and staff was ok.

Haldirams was one of the first discounts of Kolkata . Located at 1st floor is food city , a pretty average food court with self service . They serve multiple cuisines . Their Iran Thai is very good and value for money item . The Chinese combo is also worth trying . Where they loose points is their continental offerings . Very bare basic recipe and cost cutting is evident . Beverages should definitely be skipped . My only point is that I totally understand that things are kept on the economical side but for things like cold coffee where we are charged a decent amount quality should be maintained .

This is a stark opposite to teekha. Serving good thalis and chaats to phuchkas. Each item is good and super pocket friendly. The ground floor has a pastry section and they have really good eggless pastries. Must try for anyone.

I love their chole bhatures! Inspite of being a hardcore lover of non-vegetarians cuisines I cannot resist myself from trying their speciality.
It is a better option to sit in and eat rather than ordering it at home. Their sweets need no special introduction, of course!

We couldn't believe our eyes as we saw this hoarding as we were passing by - Haldiram Food City. Our excitement grew no bounds, and we decided to come here for dinner. A well oragnised token system and two floors of authentic Haldiram's packed food as well as a restaurant lay in front of us. They had all sorts of south indian, north indian and chat cuisines, which catered to the needs of my confused family. The quantity was very filling and they also had a lot of combos and meals to pick from. Not only was the food delicious, it was also well priced. The best part about this place is that it is purely for vegetarians, and even have a display of desserts that are eggless. We visited this place twice, during our 5 day tenure at Kolkata and absolutely fell in love with this place.

Haldiram ‚Äì Now who hasn‚Äôt heard of it? A pretty famous veggie food joint known for snacks and chaats. This outlet in Ballygunge is quite big and has a large seating area. Pretty clean and almost always a little crowded.¬†
Plenty of options to order from. We ordered a Masala Dosa and Pav Bhaji. And it was quite delicious. They also serve Thali. So I ordered a Rumali Thali.¬†
Prices are pretty reasonable. Quality of the food is good. Overall, a nice place.

I visited this Haldiram outlet a long time back so I'm writing from memory. This place is quite big, with cool attractive decor, clean interior and spacious sitting area. I'd had the dhokla which had been very very tasty indeed. Haldiram's food really has its own special quality and taste, come to think of it. The items on display simply made me think of grabbing all the shelves and robbing them of its delightful contents! A vegetarian's delight and paradise for yummily gorgeous snacks, sweets and tasty treats, this eatery is quite a "food city" and a ready reckoner for Haldiram's food lovers.

Last to last week we visited here after a long time. Place is excellent Food is good Service is fantastic. We ordered  Raj kachori, veg pastas and strawberry milkshake. The raj kachori was quite good. The pasta also tasted nice and was full of cream and veggies. The milk shakes were good but we found it was less in quantity,though it tasted well. The restaurant's decor is also nice and every thing is quite systematic. One can also try masala dosa, phuchka and chola batora here, they are also nice. But the main drawback is their cleanliness, otherwise everything is good :)

A perfect vegetarian snack corner to try out for. Prices are pretty much affordable with above average quality food. Their dahi puchkas, dosa, dhokla, puchka, pav bhaji and gulab jamun should all be tasted and tried out once atleast. The combo meals can also be an option to try out for. Overall, a nice place :)

One of the best places for vegetarian food and is affordable at the same time. Since, this place is close to my workplace, I thought to pamper my mother on a Friday night, post work. We ordered for Chola Bhatura and Dahi Phuchka, which was quite light and tasty. Above everything, the place is huge and I like the ambience, too. Will try the veg thali and the sweets soon. :)

Haldiram is one of the most popular vegetarian hot spots. The food here is really really nice. It isn't anything too extravagant but it's good food which you can eat multiple times a week!
Talking about this place in particular, I absolutely love the ambience. It's enormous and lit up like a Christmas Tree! They're have the candy counter too! This is a really good place to hang out with friends!!
I had ordered Ice Tea which was quite disappointing as far as quantity was concerned. I have had the same thing at less than half the price at my college! The grilled sandwich was great. I had got it packed. The packing was vers well done. Then I truly this outlet called taffle which looked exactly like Kwality Wall's Swirls but taste wise, it was not really that great.
Nonetheless this is a wonderful place to spend a cheerful afternoon or evening with friends and family particularly in this really hot weather!
Happy Dining!

This is a decent place when you are in a mood for some chat or for that matter, their pasta. I ordered a pasta and it was a total mixed up thing. I don't mind penne and macaroni going in together but pistachios and tez leaves in a pasta were surprising. It was like a desi version of the quintessential Europe food. 
Ambience is good, so is the location.

I visited this food joint and enjoyed the snacks and sweets there. This outlet of Haldiram's in Kolkata is a class apart. Foodies and food conossieur's should make this a MUST VISIT while in Kolkata. Vegetarians will love their array of eggless cakes, parties and baked items. The most moving item here is the gulab jamun and although I am not very fond of gulabjamuns the one dished out here is the best you can get ....it was hot, soft, oozing with syrup and it just melted in my mouth. There were scores of sweets, savouries, chocolates, candies etc etc..and the decor, ambience all add to the taste.

A Veg-lover's paradise! I find no other phrase to aptly describe this food joint! Haldirams is undoubtedly one of the biggest food chains in this country and it has been successfully maintaining its reputation down the years by maintaining their standards. This particular food city or food lounge as I may take the opportunity say, is located more closer to Park Circus than it is to Gariahat. The place can easily be seen from the main road and is not a tough-find!As soon as you enter, you figure how big the outlet is. Spread over two-three floors, the ground floor is where you purchase the sweets and/or snacks and walk-away. We were in a mood of some light snacks and made our way upstairs. The dining area here is quite spacious. Houses numerous tables and chairs, yet runs full for most times of the day. There is a counter where you pay the amount and then walk on to the respective mini-counters as per your cuisine preference where they serve you the food.

There is a counter where you pay the amount and then walk on to the respective mini-counters as per your cuisine preference where they serve you the food.

We ordered for a combination of North Indian Thali, Masala Dosa and Chinese Thali. The review for Dosa was standard. However, the person who opted for Chinese Thali, didn't like it very much. I personally had asked for a North Indian One. Provided with fresh Tandoori Roti, Rice, Papad, Pickle, Sweet and three types of Sabji, each and every item was tasty and delectable. I specially liked their Dal Makhali and the Chola dish. There was a time when I wanted to go for extra Roti but my appetite gave up.

The entire thali may look less in quantity, but as you start eating and go on, you would feel that you may have ordered more than you could possibly gulp in. However, no matter how full you are, there is always room for some deserts. We ordered our traditional Kulfi and one Chocolate Ice creams. The Kulfi was as always good, but I found the one served near Rabindra Sadan to be superior in taste. Also, the touch of ghee was missing here!

Overall, a nice place to visit in with your friends.

Well I am not giving them a singel mark but it's not possible rather they should be catagories negative marking
All mess from the beginning
We reserved a table after few phone calls to get a proper information of booking as it is Sunday evening we are planning for. Well after being having reservation and we reached in proper time we have to wait another 15 min then what's the point of having reservation... and the funny thing no one is looking for reservations no maintaince for people having reservation or walk in.. well after we get in the ideal way that some one is come and tell the process how they are served and all after being waited another 10 min finally one person is came and explain us the process of service and then start the whole thing really pathetic service when you compare Sigree bar b Q nation or any of them. Starters are not served properly
Lack of food in main course
Total weast of money and time.
It's ruined our evening
We are not going at any futher cost to this place.

Nothing more than overrated street food. Only thing you get for the extra price is the seating area. Used to visit this place often back in 2007-09 when they had the supermarket at the 2nd floor. Then it was a nice option for lunch and shopping. But stopped going there after the market closed. 
The sweets section at the ground floor is still very good. But the Quality of the food on the 1st floor keeps deteriorating.

I have been a regular customer here and mostly prefer to take away the food. It has a very spacious and clear seating arrangement and is full during the weekends.

My observations for the below items:

Pav Bhaji
-It tastes okay though they can slightly cut down on the sourness. They should also increase the portion of Bhaji as it is not sufficient.

Chola Bhature
-Tastes really bad as the Chola is way too sweet for anyone's liking. The Bhatura has excessive oil and is overall inedible.

Luchi Cholar Dal
-Luchi is nice and thin but the major let down was again excessive sweetness and too much of turmeric.

Club Kachori Sabji
-The quantity and tastes is good but it must be consumes while it is still hot otherwise the Kachoris become rock solid.

Idly-Was nice, fresh and hot and tasted good.

Indian Thali
-It has a good portion size and tastes nice.

Gulab Jamun
-Is super soft though they can cut down on the sweetness here.

The price range of all the items is reasonable which explains the popularity.

Haldiram food court, opposite Birla mandir is an ideal place for hangout with friends. It has a veg food court which serves average vegetarian food. However, the desserts are quite good. 
I went there once with my friend to have our breakfast. We tried veg thali (comprising peas pulao, mix veg, dal makhani, tandoori roti) and kulfi falooda. Veg thali was average but the kulfi was good. 
Peas pulao 2.5/5 
tandoori roti 3/5 
mix veg 3/5 
dal makhani 4/5 
kulfi falooda 4.5/5 
This place is quite large and window seats are pretty awesome. Great place for clicking nice pics.üòÉ

Great place for family meals for days you want to choose from a wide array of vegetarian options.Every vegetarian street food is available under the roof from North Indian to South Indian and also popular International fast foods.Food here is good not of gourmet level but you have to keep in mind it is like a food factory where food is produced i huge amounts and real quick owing to its large demands.Secondly it must be noted food here is reasonably priced so you are getting value for money so don't  go there expecting the best dosa in town and the likes and you will not be disappointed.
   Besides there is option of north,south Indian and Chinese thalis.Besides keep your eyes open for their special thalis.These are really economical and great if you are going in crowds for plain fun and time well spent.Also on menu is all the traditional Indian desserts from gulab jamun to Kulfi faloosa.Also one can gorge on any street  food that one desires as the menu is quiet expansive.
   Besides on the ground level,one can find their in house Indian sweets,snacks and even cakes,all that haldiram's is originally known for.From coffee to natural ice-creams ,every food item is found under the same roof for days you want to gorge on hygienic vegetarian street foods without too much of a pinch in your pocket.

Family adda! This I what defines this place. From its start, this has been a regular place of visit on Saturday evenings for my family and I am sure many others, for some soulful indian snacks and even the stomach filling combos.

The place is brightly lit, well organised in terms of self service counters and even the staff serving and cleaning the place. A food court on the first floor and the ground floor houses the trademark Haldiram sweets and namkeens.

Coming to the food court, the food here surely lives up to the Haldiram reputation. U cud taste ghee in their preparations, which u wont in any other eatery. I just love the masala dosa they make. The masala filling surpasses that of many south indian restaurants I have had till now. Another thing to try is the Kesari Kulfi faluda. This is the nearest best kulfi to the now closed Rallis in new market. Also to be had are pao bhaji and the Chinese combo.

There is nothing special in the menu and neither is the menu vast. It is everyday food served with a lot of heart. ( it rhymed!üòú). In my numerous visits I have never had any complaints.

The HFC is located near ballygunge phari.Food here is mainly Indian veg snacks like panipuri,papri chaat,kachauri chaat, halwa etc. It also has eggless cakes, and a swirl joint inside the place is nice and simple .

We ordered Puchkas, Samosa chat, Dahi Puchka, Pav Bhaji & Luchi cholar daal .... Food was as usual very very yummy. Ended our meal with Hot Gulab Jamun & Kesari Kulfi Falooda üòä

Happens to be the best place to have authentic indian street foods and sitting and gossiping with friends or family. A huge place with ample of seatings is visited by many vegetarians every day. Being a complete non vegetarian , i immensely love this place from childhood. Everything starting from combos to chinese bhel and phuchkas to paw bhajis  have been tried my me. Yesterday went there on 26/01/16 after a family outing nearby. We were hungry so zeroed down to this place for some munching. Raj kachori chaat is one of our fav of haldiram so we took one plate and two plates of chole bature. Next we ordered kesari rasmalai and  kulfi with faluda. Rasmalai was dreamy. Everything else was also fine.

I was very annoyed with the quality of food served out here. Of other things, the chhole bhature was most disappointing. The bhatura was so elastic that I'm sure it was stale, and the chhola was average. Their service is such that they hardly help customers out with grievances.

Haldiram's Food City is a huge food court and a delight for vegetarians with so much food to choose from. I have innumerable memories wrapped in my mind about this place. In my school days at South Point, this was the place for our hangouts and 'adda' sessions.
The place is humongous with two main floors and some other lounges above it. Normal seating arrangements with loads of places to have a seat and try out your favourite chaat on the menu. Loads of counters ranging from a plethora of sweets, to cakes, pastries, pizzas, pastas are available at this food joint. But whenever I visit Haldiram's Food City at Ballygunge I try out their Chaats, Samosas, Kachoris and Panipuris. There is a South Indian counter as well.
‚Ä¢
The last time I went to this place I tried out their Samosa Chaat. are crushed & served with imli and green chutney along with chopped onion, coriander, chillies and curd that allover makes it a spicy, tangy and joyful experience. Chaats are so addictive that we can't get over it.
‚Ä¢
Next we tried out their Panipuris. The Puris and the tamarind water and pudina water tastes somewhat bland compared to what you get on road side phucka or panipuri stalls. But it did taste good when you blend the whole thing together and put it into your mouth. These guys maintain hygiene which is a fact that you will never get from any of the panipuri or chaat vendors.
‚Ä¢
Haldiram's Food City is a cool place to hangout with family and friends, just to sit and relax and gosspi for long hours. The ambiance is nothing special though but this is what you expect from a food court at very pocket-friendly prices.

Been to this food court of Haldirams and I have found out it's pretty huge and the options to eat are lots over here as they have two floors spread out just to cater their packaged snacks , sweets , chocolates in the ground floor and on the 1 st floor they have the food court to sit and eat like if you want to eat some platter meals then there are two three options with mini veg meal and special veg meal platter quite good enough to satisfy your hunger and if not other individual items are there like dosas , sandwiches , pizzas , dhoklas , Samosas, bhel and other quick snacking stuffs which also is pretty nice , thus if hunger is your call and if you are in and around ballygunge you can give this place a try .

Haldiram is one of my favourite food joints to have a quick bite. Although I don't like veg foods much but Haldiram provides with some really good veg items. The sweets and chocolates are also very nice to have. The place is really big so it is a good place to catch up with your friends(provided they like veg food)

This has to be the biggest Haldiram‚Äôs establishment in the city. It extends to about 2-3 floors, literally a city in its own. Haldiram‚Äôs is already a huge brand name and level of its quality and its consistency are pretty well known country wide. It‚Äôs a heaven for vegetarians with the variety of items available on the menu surpassing your expectations. The interiors are that which you‚Äôll find in any other Haldiram‚Äôs outlet, nothing major.

Coming to the food, we had Raj Kachori, Batata Puri and Chinese Bhel. The taste is amazing and quantity is enough. Also had Kesaria Rasmalai to cater to that sweet tooth.

The reason for the huge success of Haldiram‚Äôs is its sole concentration on Indian foods and way they prepare them. All items generally taste awesome with each of the flavours coming out right. The fact that over the years they have managed to perfect the skills over street food also puts them ahead of the competition, if there is any.

The place is very good point where you can have good food and spend some quality time. The place is actually one of its kind at least in south Kolkata. Good sitting arrangements. Spacious dinning area. The food is a bit pricey. Tasty food but they need to add more items in thair menu. It takes quite a lot of time to get the items you ordered by yourself, as everything is self service here. As obvious the place is never recommended for hardcore non-vegiterians.

Haldiram offers a wide array of food ranging from idly, vada, dosa to chana batura,candy, ice cream and even different flavoured cakes most of which are extremely delicious. But haldiram is mainly famous for it's insanely delicious sweets. A must visit!

Today visited Haldiram Food city in Ballygunge for lunch. After recently shifted from Delhi, I was looking for something like Haldiram outlets there. Thankfully today the search ended. It is very spacious; food and behaviour of staff were excellent. Chola Bhatura dish was prepared in Ghee and was very tasty. Thali was also good although choice of vegetables is less. They should add Shahi Paneer as this is favourite for kids. Sweets are available in many varieties and are delicious. Overall very nice experience. Value for money. Worth visiting again from Newtown :).

I took a chinese combo meal which contains everything written in the menu under the name, and dahi fuchka. Dahi fuchka was awesome and the combo meal was good too.
You can have a good food here in a lower price.
I thought to have a cold coffee later..but the combo meal was so heavy which is enough to cope up with a hungry person, that i couldn't order it. Anyway it was a nice and big spaced outlet, good one :)

The food is good but at times it is not at all good .  For example ,on sundays, there is a rush which they are not able to handle and they give uncooked sabzi in the thali or the naan not at all hot when they give, it looks like it was made a long time before and is  served now . The raj kachori  is fine not so good . Leaving the thali most of the things are good .

Being a vegetarian place , Haldiram Food City offers a wide variety of Food. Chole bhature, pav bhaji, luchi and cholar dal are very very good. The naan thali and rumali thaali is pretty good too. But I would suggest that when you go there , strictly stick to the Indian food. Because the Chinese thali , pastas and pizzas are not that great. You will have had better. You must try Raj kachori and papdi chaat. Although puchka tastes okay , you'd rather prefer the roadside one. And as Haldiram is famous for its sweets , do have them for dessert. It's a pocket friendly place with good food. And that is just the combination you need.

If you want to get up in between your 'nivaala' you can visit the place.

Great place for a hangout with friends. Their dosas are huge, pastas super tasty and kesaria jalebis to die for. So many vegetarian options, from pao bhaji to combo meals, both Indian and Chinese. And if in case you are in the mood for street food, you have come to the right place. Luscious Raj kachoris to mouthwatering chaats, its all here under a single roof. With a light music playing in the background, one can rewind and catch up, unhurried. On the ground floor is a beautiful spread of sweets and cakes, along with other snacks like bread pakoras and my favourite mushroom patties. From whichever part of India you are, you will surely find something to your taste.

I am not a veg guy, so I generally avoid to visit this kind of places which serve (at least when I was there) veg at a very high cost. But I had to give a treat to one of my veggie friends, so I decided to take him there.

Location:It is near the Ice-Skating Ring. If you are going from Gariahut side, you will find it on your right hand side. You can not miss this place because it is a big two stories building.

Ambiance:It is a nice place. This outlet of Haldiram is quite spacious and also cleaned one.

Rating: 4/5

Service:Self-service.  I do not like this policy because if you have a bulky order then it is very difficult to handle, and also you have to search for seats. Whatever, they served our food quite fast (expected because they served from the precooked food items).

Rating: 2.5/5

Cost:Cost for two is approximately 550 rupees. Accepts both cash and cards. To me, it was not VFM.

Rating: 3/5

Food:Food was okay, but not very taste. Quantity of the dishes were average. Specifically I remember that I did not like the noodles. Rice and other side dishes were okay.

Rating: 3/5

For vegetarian people, it may be a must visit place, but non-veg people, I do not think it is that much worthy to explore.

Everytime you can't opt for Non-Veg foods and being a foodie myself, love to swing in both ways. The foods are fresh, delicious, aroma makes me starving. A huge food court which is beautifully organized, clean as well. For me mouth watering dishes are Raj Kachuri, Paw Bhaji, Luchi Cholar Dal. Price is very much reasonable compared to others.

Plain dosa, raj kachori, luchi, chole bature are mouth-watering. It's a great place to hangout with friends, family, significant other all alike!

It's a huge place and being Haldiram, this place doesn't need any introduction. Just go there and enjoy the vegetarian food at reasonable cost. You can order anything from North Indian, South Indian, snacks, sweets etc. and you will not go wrong.

Perfect option for the vegetarians. Starting from the Idly, Dosa, Kachori, Dahi Vada to the milkshakes, every item is delicious af. Reasonable prices. Ambience is great. As the name suggests, this outlet is spacious and the name food city is really apt. Paprichat, Kulfi and the sweets are yummy too. A 4 star from me. Must try. Recommended.

Ambience is good. But its too noisy on sundays. Available fast food and must try their chinese thali. Its awesome. Pocket friendly and tastes good. Go here when you want to try diffrent menus like puchka, club kachori, Chola bhatura...
Also try Gulab Jamun. They serves it hot.

Haldiram Food City is unlike anything I have seen before. In concept, design and proportions, it looks like something out of a space movie :D But this is a vegetarian foodie paradise. I will go over the items in order. Cold coffee was watery yet packed a decent punch. Pav bhaji and Chinese bhel both delivered. The thali came with 2 subzis, both of which were average. The small pulao serving was the highlight. The chole in the chole batura was given a thumbs down by my companion. For dessert, we went with kesaria rasmalai which did not rock my world. Really quick service and fair hygiene levels. I wouldn‚Äôt mind revisiting for a snack or two.

My most favorite vegetarian restaurant. Really like their system. You pay the money once you have decided what to eat, collect the coupon give it in the counter and get your food. Takes 5 minutes to get your food once you have made up your mind. They are extremely organized, neat and clean. These guys made me realize that Chinese tastes equally good without chicken, prawn and eggs after I tasted their Chinese Combo for the first time. Ever since then its my favorite. Shahi Thali is another of my favorites and is a must try if you are going for lunch or dinner.

A heaven for the veggie lovers I have dropped in with my mom for a few early evening snacks. My mom loves south indian so we have had the Masala Dosa , Idly here which are quiet good. I love chaats so Dahi puchka, Papri chaat, Raj kachori are some other yummy stuffs I have had here. Besides these, I love Pao bhaji so I have had it here and its not bad. The lassi and the milkshake are okay too. Though a meat lover, seeing such a variety of yummy food displayed in the counters even my mouth waters badly.  A very good option for the veggies. Clean and spacious, self-service, but the price a little high.

The no-frills, pocket-friendly vegetarian eatery chain looks like a food court of sorts. The bright red and yellow chairs and the glass sides making for loads of sunlight to come through is sure to cheer one up. 
It's a really good place to have an Indian breakfast. Also if one is looking for a place to hangout with friends in a big group, without spending too much of money, and don't particularly crave for non-veg, then this is the ideal place. 
Just one thing - I always stick to their ghee doused Indian sweets as their pastries fail to impress me.

This branch is huge. Multiple floors. Lovely place for hangout, family get together, spending time with loved one. Or throwing children's bday party.
My favourite in Haldiram is Raj kachori chat, papri chat, samosa chat, dhokla. kulfi is outstanding!! And 'sweets' are needless to say!

This has been my favourite hangout destination in the city for quite some time now. They have a good variety of snacks and the overall setting of the place is very nice. You can spend hours at end here; as you munch on a samosa and sip a cold drink whil gazing at the fantastic view outside.  

However, I must admit that of late, their food quality has diminished. They have increased the prices of all items and at the same time reduced the sizes of several of them like the samosas, the pyaz kachoris, and the pastries,  among others. I had recently ordered a plate of Chola Bhatura which I used to like here. But I found that it wasn't fluffy the way it used to be. It appeared more like a paapad. Even the cold drink, which they charge around 40 rs,, does seem to contain a fair bit of water. I mean, I have had fountain coke several times in the past, but the coke that is being served here does not seem genuine at all. I hope they address this soon. Although I doubt they will given the crowds they get; but then again that is more because of their prominent location. 

Nevertheless, Haldiram's Ballygunge has a lot going for it. I love their dhoklas, paapri chaats, pastries, sweets, and several other items. I just wish that they would not have increased the prices of their products so much while reducing their size. Disappointed because of that. Otherwise, it still remains one of my preferred snacks outlets.

When ever in the lunch I wanted to eat something special I went to haldiram during my college days. It is close to my college only one auto is required to reach the place. I have tested all the items and I liked all of them specially the Chinese combo meal. It tests great. And in the evening I liked puchka the most. It tests awesome.

Generally non-vegetarians consider veg items "ghaas pus" but let me say haldirams doesnt serve ghaas at all. The place is huge with a superb location at ballygunje . The chinese thali, dahi vada, kulfi faluda are awsome and i really love the chinese salad they have. Each items are also available individually and wow! Each item tastes so good inspite of being a complete veg food court( Though onion and garlic are used ).
Love their pulao and dosas.
Their phuchkas are hygenic and trust me, made from good quality refined oil.
Every time i go i start loving veg dishes and this comment coming from a hard core non-veg girl explains all.

All wre like just as it should be. Good.

Conveniently located opposite to the Exide, it offers nice options for the vegetarian palate. The place is nothing fancy. I am not much of a veggie fan, but I have the palate to appreciate good food. I had the naan thali, chola bhatura and kesari raasmalai on couple of my visits. The taste was good though but certainly could have been a lot better. Nice for a quick and affordable veg meal.

REALLY rich people, if you really have a lot of money, give it to me... I would be a real good cook for you..
Or you could donate this for real hungry people who need food to satisfy hunger... Not to show off!!

But I should add 1 thing, their desserts are real yummy!!! My poor rating is for the addons they sell, like the chow mein and other stuffs they sell. If it were for the laddus and kaju-barfi, I would have given them a 4/5 rating.. :)

I am supremely biased towards this place and the reason is my love for deep fried food items! They serve practically everything I love! Starting from their deep fried club kachori ( an all time favourite ) to their kesariya jalebi (I bet this one is the best in town ) Gulab Jamuns ( freshly prepared and served hot ) chole bature, puchka, goey cheese smashed pizzas (only when I feel the need for extreme cheese rush! ) I get confused what to order first or rather how much to order. 
If I ever visit during the lunch hours I always order the thali - right proportions and the varied food items starting from dal to the buttery nun is super tasty! 
Very economically priced, a pure vegetarian restaurant just opposite to the CC&FC club, their seating area is huge and the view of of the lush green area of CCFC club through the huge glass windows is an added bonus! So much better than to stare at traffic while munching on something tasty. 
The service is prompt and the food served thankfully is under hygienic conditions. ( haven't found a single strand of hair, which I am usually prone to find most of the time sticking from my the depths of my plate ! thank you God! ) 
I am not a big fan of their dosas but again their Raj Kachori & Dahi Vada is one of the best in town for sure. They have absolutely no competition when it comes to wholesome veg dishes! 
It's always filled mostly with families and small wailing kids who likes to run around for some reason especially when I am trying to enjoy my food which makes it a little noisy and a bit annoying but again when you can have deep fried comfort food who cares about the noise?!  I keep coming back here and for good reason!

Let's just say when adults are upset or stressed they head to a bar, I head here. It's my junk food heaven. God bless the junk food oops sorry comfort food.

Coming to the menu.. From dahi bora,cutlets,dosas,idly to main course combo meals everything is available to satisfy your hunger..
Today i went there and ordered chola batora and chinese combo meal.. The combo meal has chowmein,fried rice,salad,vegetable munchurian..its my favourite dish whenever i come here. Even the cholas are quite tasty but i guess its quantity could be a little bigger considering the huge batoras..
I am a hardcore non veg..but even i was impressed the food!! So it will surely taste heavenly for veggies.. ;)

if u get a place to sit which happens to b a hard job to find most of the time..its an ideal place to chat and hang out..

Tried only a few items from there. The papri chat and dosa are delicious, the hot gulabjamuns to die for. Chinese vel is just okay-ish, the one time I had that, it had way too much onion for my liking. Though there are lots of dishes available, this is such an odd route for me that I can't come more often even if I want to. The environment is nice, even though kinda noisy from all the people.

I am a regular at this place ever since it opened up. It rarely disappoints. Food is great. Prices have slowly risen but still quite affordable. Would recommend the chats, especially Rajkachori. Their thalis are also quite nice. Its location is the USP which is why I eat here whenever I am Ballygunge/ Gariahat

You will never know the power of Vegetarian food, until you come across this place. A really spacious, big food court will give you ample freedom to munch on quality stuff with your medium or big size family.

I had Raj Kachori and Luchi Chholar Daal at a later time, both of these were delicious and magically healthy-looking despite fried in edible oil/ghee. Service was prompt and cleaning was good enough. A very very hygienic place to eat out.

Those who are very fond of Non-veg bites should also try these Veg platter. I, being a hardcore Non-Veg lover, recommend this place for all.

A great place to hang out with friends & family. It's spacious,with good ambience. The quality of some items like dahi vada,dhokla and chhole bature are better than the haldiram @exide rabindra sadan (according to me). The restaurant is two storeyed, ground floor is for deserts and stuffs and the top floor is for main course items like dosa,idli etc.

For that one evening when we decided to try veggie, we landed up at this Food City at Ballygunge. The sheer spread was a delight. I tried the samosa and the dhokla, while Mr. had a Raj Kachori and some Kesaria Rasmalai. No doubt the food was good, however, when we turned to the beverages, the Cappuccino as well as the Cold Coffee were big let downs. The coffee was watery, with hardly any taste or aroma of coffee, and being an avid coffee-lover, this was hardly acceptable. Mr. also got me a pack of their homemade chocolates, which was pretty good. Overall, a good place to sample some vegetarian fare at a very reasonable price. However, this was the first and the last time I tried the coffee here.

Its because of Haldiram that I started admiring vegetarian food. I along with my friends used to eat here daily in the afternoon after college. Food here is pure bliss. I have tasted everything from the food section, barring sweets. My personal favorite is the cheese and mushroom pasta in red and white sauce. Then I just simply love the chana batura, pao bhaji, Chinese combo meal and the Indian platter too. I often order sand witch or dhokla with ilaichi tea when I am low on cash. Otherwise i end my meal with the mouthwatering hot gulab jamun which has kesar in it or the kulfi which has an exquisite taste. What I observe about the food here is its eternal freshness, beautiful aroma and flavors that enhance the taste. I am a big fan of Haldiram. I wish they had gajar ka halwa too :( Oh and I just just skipped talking about the ambiance. People its amazing. It has a huge area which is extremely clean and hygienic with bright lights and transparent glass doors on all sides that gives you quite a view of the city. Just go and grab something with a cup of tea when its raining outside. You will feel the magic.

First off, the place is great if you are out shopping with kids. The place has candies, street food, snacks, sweets, icecream restaurants etc all under one roof. What I am not happy about it is why would Haldiram charge  their own customers for parking.I definitely won't visit again simply for that reason. The food was okay ...service was very slow. Took forever to get the bhature. The kesar kulfi was a DISASTER. Has someone from Haldiram tried it themselves? I would highly recommend them to do so...it is crap and not kulfi. If I want the mediocre food n extensive parking fees ( Rs. 60 for an hour and 3 mins), I am better off finding another restaurant. I definitely expected way more from a brand name like Haldiram.

Huge space and a calm atmosphere greets you as you step in the ground floor, lined by a never ending array of sweets and chocolates leaving ¬†you spoilt for choice! The first floor is another world, a one stop joint for all kinds of Indian street food - full of people, busy chatting over food and moving about to and from the self service kiosks. The yellow red plastic chairs look fitting in the bright atmosphere. I remember having Chola Batora, Dhokla many times here with mom and sister. The prices are very reasonable.

Haldiram Food City is a great place to try out North and South Indian dishes, snacks, Chinese and continental. Though they serve only vegetarian dishes they are worth a try, for their tastes. The restaurant has a huge collection of desserts, cakes, pastries, sweets and chocolates. Facilities they provide- self service, food served from alphabetically numbered counters, drinking water, wash-room, parking area and there is also a very big area of seating arrangement. Its absolutely a great place to get your friends group together and go for a long adda session with the yummy dishes on your tables. Its an equally cool place to hang-out with your family. I have been visiting the Exide junction Haldiram since my school days. Being a long time visitor my personal favourite combination is Chola Bhatora and Lassi. The following are totally irresistible dishes- dhokla, club kachori, Chinese combo and many more.

This is a very good place if you are looking for hanging out with friends in a vegetarian restaurant. You can get all kind of vegetarian food, as they say Haldiram's Food City. This is a very big building with car parking facility. In the first floor you will get all types of deserts like sweets ( Mithai/Mishti ), Cakes and Pastries, Candy. On the second floor you are getting the food court area where you can get the vegetarian foods. On the third floor there is a restaurant. And on the top floor there is a banquet hall.

Well indeed the name "haldiram food city" is absolutely justified. Located in ballygunge, this outlet is situated in a luxurious multi-storied squeaky clean and chique building. Its completely a huge palacious set up. The decor on every floor is top notch, ampleband comfortable sitting arrangements. On the ground floor they serve cakes, pastries, sweets, dry fruits, various packaged snacks, candies. Cozy couches and tables are provided for sitting and enjoying your favorite dessert. They offer so vast amount of varieties over here that i can bet you will get confused about which sweets to choose among the rest everytime you visit. The second floor is provided for main course and meals. Over here they serve multi cuisine meals(thalis) ranging from north indian thali(pulao+naan/tandoori roti roomali roti+daal+various curries), south indian (dhosa, utthapam, idlis etc), chinese thali(fried rice+chowmein+veg manchurian+chilli potato+salad), other varieties include- channa batura, pav bhaji, sabji kachori, chaats etc continental snd fast foods like burgers, pizzas, sandwiches are also served here. This place is vegeterian's paradise and the moment you enter the ambience will give you a soothing and holistic feeling. Its kind of a food carnival, a fiesta which takes place everyday. Visiting this place for a meal gives you a completely different as compared to other restaurants, its like joining a grand gala. And as far as the taste is concerned i can assure you that you will end up licking your fingers.

An awesome place to go to if u want awesome veggie food, multi cuisine on your mind but a little tight on your pocket. My friends literally laugh at me when I go to this place and order my favourite Pasta, but trust me they make one of the most amazing Pastas that too @70 bucks  (minus taxes).
In addition to their Pasta,  I love their dhoklas, chola bhatura, paw bhaji, dahi puchka and cheese pizza.

Standing tall at Ballygunge its a super huge place serving awesome mithai and candies (even pastries) on the ground floor and the rest on its first floor. A homely feeling but food is ordered and picked from these counters situated.

If u havent tried it yet high time you do and u won't be dissapointed.

Probably the best vegetarian restaurant in South Kolkata, haldiram food city have become our go-to place to lay off the meat for a day.. The chowmein and Chinese preparations are not quite good, but the Chhola Batura is excellent.. 2 huge Baturas. Accompanied by an excellent preparation of chhole, alur dum, achaar, and salads, its one platter you must try.. The thali is also good, and whatever the food we order, the quality is top class, without a shred of doubt..

Used to frequent this place a lot in 3-4 years back but not anymore. The one simple reason for stopping is the huge drop in service levels and the quality of food served at this place. There is nothing consistent about the taste and most of the times you end up eating something that you never wanted in the first place. Though many people might disagree to the comment I am making coz whenever you go to this place it‚Äôs always jam crowded with people who are willing to satisfy their hunger.

Only one Word comes in my mind this time about this place! BEWARE OF THIS PLACE HAVING PUJA SPECIAL VEG BUFFET! This is the second time I visited there in Mahasthami Buffet (Rajasthani Spread). Last year I visited with pleasant experience somehow value for money. This year with similar expectation (not with great), I had gone there today for lunch. Rs. 300+tax per pax. Not even worth of Rs. 100/-. Filthy tables with spots of left over foods, bees every where. Last time was also messy tables, but at least food made me satisfied. One live pasta counter is also vanished this year even with price higher than last year. You can not change your plate even if it is messy with various gravies. Items? As less as I talk would be better. One fruit salad(only Apple) and another chana salad. Dahi
 Bada. Green peas kachori and aloo dam were the only thing eatable. Paneer kulcha and one paneer gravy (God knows what they were intend to make!!!) we're all the thing you have. One mixed vegetables was just boiled and spoiled the mood (if you try to have it there) altogether. Two types of rice were there but you have to eat it dry. One sweet and sour vegetable was there but....???? One moong Dal halua and a little pastry were for desert and were ok. One fountain coke was included. During mid lunch suddenly they have decided to show mercy of giving a choice of having coke or ice cream (single scoop). By the time they announce I took coke. Rest of the food I better keep my mouth shut! I visited the first floor food court many a times. It's really refreshing. But every food lover should avoid their puja special buffet on the ground floor.

An excellent range of vegetarian items.................tried quite a few and loved all. The flip side is poor administration and management - in the afternoon, half of the huge hall doesn't get effect of air conditioning properly and the place being west facing, can be pretty uncomfortable .¬† 
¬†
What is even worse is the staff over there do not allow people to combine 2 tables - which I found absolutely ridiculous - we had more people than a 4 seater could accommodate and there were table vacant side by side, but they did not allow us to pull them and combine ( self help, we didn't even need their help)....................

The food court was one of its kind in the city when was opened few years back. But gradually started loosing its charm thanks to famous shopping malls where dining, shopping and entertainment is under one roof.
However coming to Haldiram Food Court we ordered Chinese & Indian Thalis in main course. Accompanied by Lassi Kesaria and Kulfi Faluda as dessert.
In Chinese the noodle was very dry, veg machurian was flat, fried rice was so so.
The Indian Thali was comparatively much better. The pulao rice was nice fragrant long grain, dal makhani was creamy, palak paneer melted inside mouth and the tandoori roti was soft.
Nothing else to say specially about lassi and kulfi as these are their trademarks.
My recommendation will be stick to their Indian dishes, chaats and sweets. Chinese dish or pizza is not their forte.
Parking space is there which has exorbitant charge of INR 30/hour. Its Haldiram's property which has only their restaurants and they are charging hefty parking fees for visitors to their restaurants only.

A tard bit expensive, but food quality is as good as ever. This two floored mammoth will be impossible to miss in the dusty and fast moving street. I had some Mumbaiya style batata puri- which was quite decent- very good to be precise. Though it costs me a hefty 60 bucks! (in Mumbai you can get the same for 30!) I also had a hazelnut ice cream- again overpriced.
I have rated it 3.5 considering the price factor. If it was made more affordable it is surely 4 rated! They have some chance of improvement in the hospitality- I asked for a glass of water- no one helped me there.

** Location = A walk towards Park Circus from Birla Mandir, you find this enormous building "Haldiram Food City" to your right.

** Brief = You are hungry, need to spend some time, you are okay with vegeterian delights then Haldiram Food City is a great place to visit.

** Ambiance = This place is huge and has alot of space for a even a group of 10 :D Here they have self service(even for water). You need to make payment previously and then get your food. They have a nice system of various kiosks named A,B,C etc. serving different dishes.

** Recommended = Pav Bhaji - Its very delicious and tasty.
Veg Cheese Sandwich - nicely prepared and pretty filling.
Chinese Thali - serving chow,rice,veg manchurian,a potato dish and salads.
I dont like the Indian thali here myself.
The GulabJamuns are must try here, they serve the best Hot Gulab Jamuns :D

** Purse Check = Rs.400/- ¬†for 2 people is enough :)

** Overall = Great ambiance, nice place to spend some time over some light or heavy veg food. Its a good place to hangout with your friends as well.

Cheers !!

You'll get variety of stuffs from Dahi Vada to Phuchka,Idli,thali,etc.I go to there every year specially on Sashti evening during Pujas.
Have tasted almost each and every item.The desserts are fantastic specially the Gulab Jamun,Kesari Ka Faluda,Jalebi.
Though I prefer the jalebis' of Gupta Brothers. They have a much better taste & r very crispy.
And then comes the Swirls next to the gates.
A great meal always end up with an ice-cream & if it is SWIRLS then it'ld be perfectly satisfactory ;)

Haldirams has been my all time favorite for veg food items and sweets. If I have to have veg food outside, I almost always go for Haldirmas, it's always bustling with colors and energy at this place. Among my favorite dishes - The chhola batora over there is awesome! I also like their Chinese thali, it's quite simple yet tasty.¬†

And then comes their sweets. They just don't have the simple Kaju Barfi, they make a lot of innovative sweets with kaju and pista. The presentation of the sweets is very classy, which is why I prefer to take a packet of Haldiram's sweets to my friends and relatives when I visit them.¬†The gulab Jamuns and Motichoor Laddoo needs special mention as well. These evergreen sweets are made here just the way they should be, just too good. A must visit from my side! Cheers!

Haldiram Food City is located near Birla Mandir ,Ballygunge.
It is a big place and has almost 3-4 floors.
Last time i went there was nice but this time I found the place not maintained.
The elevator was not working .
We had to climb the stairs up.
There was a food chart were the food items and there prices .
We choose lassi as we were thirsty but when we gave the order they charged us more .
From 35 to 48 .
And the lassies were served in a small earthen cups .
That was kinda cheating us .
Whatever it is the food was good .

Now this is a place for a vegetarian.... but please remember one thing that it is owned by haldiram and they will Indianize any cuisine given to them.... so stick to the things which you know that will be good at this place... the chola bhatura is great while the mal pua (sweet) is just awesome in this place... aside from that the chaats are good and the paw bhaji is really good as well... must try the puchkas of this place as the water given is the delhi style which is really cool.... other than this it is average to above average... place it looks very very big but on the right day people are prying around like vultures looking for a table... which can be really sad... the price here is not that expensive for this kind of food as compared to the rest of the city....

I used to visit this outlet quite often during my school life.Although now I rarely go to this place but it still remains my favourite.
The food plaza is in my opinion the best outlet in the city;better than the exide and airport outlet anyday.
Their dosas,chola batora n not to forget indian and chinese thali are my alltym favrt.Try their kesaria lassi...its the best in the city.And not to forget the kesaria jalebis and hot gulab jamuns are a must have for the ppl wd a sweet tooth.
Visit the place in winter for a special treat that is hardly availble in other outlets.....tha rajasthani gewar.Its yummm....and serve it with a variety of add ons like malai etc.
So next tym u dnt feel lk splurging on food n want to hv a halka fulka veg meal....this is the place????

This is a place apt for vegetarian people and the food is quite tasty. The chats, meals, luchi and dal, jalebi, jamun all are good and of best quality. Parking sometimes is a problem if You want to visit it on a weekend. I didn't like the dosas at all, May be I got used to south Indian food staying in Bangalore over a decade. Over all its good.

A heaven for vegetarian foodies! Humongous place , aptly named! Must try the hot gulabjamuns and kulfi for desserts. The food is great like other haldiram outlets. I liked the chats here more than the exide outlet, esp the raj kachouri. Nice place for family eat outs and birthday parties alike!

Chole Bature, Pav Bhaji, Dahi Puchka, Dhoklas and Dahi Vada--these items are served the best in town here.
Dosas are also crispy and tasty.
What I like most is the chutneys they provide there--both the mitha and the green one.
Seating arrangements are pretty ok and for light evening snacks this is a place to try out food specially for veggies.

The best place for pure vegetarian food in the city. The dosas, the sandwiches, all are awesome. My favourite is the Raj Kachori Chaat. Its an absolute must have. Along with that, the chola batora is top class too. The batora is huge, like simply huge. And you add to that, the sweets of Haldirams, which are excellent as usual. So, if you are in for a vegetarian snacks, this is the place to be.

Nice spacious place with huge variety - sweets, chocolates, South Indian, North Indian, Chinese, Pizza, chaat etc.. Plus off course grocery on top floor. Good concept must admit. Self service place. Has good food esp Idli, Dosa, Pav bhaji, Club kachori etc. Sweets are good esp sattu peda. North Indian thali and other stuff is as in most such places quite ordinary. This is overall a good place recommended for a quick bite or a general family outing where good is not the main agenda.

The adda lovers free zone.. and an escapade from boring old SCM :D.. located in one of the busiest places of South Kolakta, this huge food outlet in Ballygunge is a vegetarian's delight. Love their filling combo meals, Dahi phucka, Masala dosa, pastries, Masala dhokla, Masala tea, :D almost everything.. their chinese combo is one of my favourites. Only con is food can be a little too overpriced with respect to the quantity. :)

Do try out the veg and cheese sandwiches. Chole Bature and Dosas are also good. So is the Chinese Combos. So if you looking for a normal day eating out this is a good place to drop by. Ground floor has all your mouth watering sweets and first floor has all your snacks and meals. Good place to go to

Veg food.. I am always up for haldirams.
From sweets to food..maybe a bit pricey but still I love the quality always. They always kept their standard maintained in same way since they started and till now.
I tried almost all type of sweets..all are just yummy. No complaints. Turn your tastes buds from spicy to sweet and you will fall in love with sweets forever.
Then in spicy, I tried Chole Batura , Masala Dosa , Plain Dosa , Veg Chowmin , Dahi vada , Raj Kachori , Chats , Dahi phuchka and Dhokla. Tried these till now and I dont have any complaints. I love their food even if the price is a bit high. Even non-veg lovers will love their veg dishes.

Ambience is nice and comforting. Huge place, large seating arrangement, no one to disturb anyone. Overall, I surely recommend Haldiram's for veg tasters (non-veg too !)

Happy Eating :)

This outlet is best suited for take a ways. The menu is utterly delicious, and the place itself is very neat and clean. Everything is just fine. dosa is one of the best made here. Dahi fuchka and papri chat are so very good.
Please avoid the pizza and pasta. Ice creams are very well made. I will definitely go again.

This place always attracted me . The name itself is enough to tell the type of food one can get from this place .
It is pure veg , I wont say it is a restora but a place to hangout and have a few bites . Most of the dishes are prepared in Ghee , so if U are not fond of oily and high fat food then refrain from this place. 

It serves namkeen and mithai both and dishes ranges from south to north with all the mouthwatering bengali sweets to 

Price is high compared to any other place like gangurams and tiwari .
But the food quality is well . Another important fact to mention would be , the place is very clean and food hygene is maintained properly , the cooks use plastic gloves etc

As this place is just beside the road it has a strategic point and customers are plenty , though the place is not over crowded
As I said its a place to hangout with friends and have some bites to eat

in d upper floor do try the dahi fuchka and  d pasta .. for ur sweet tooth rasamalai is great so is gulab jamun 
ambience is buzzing .. staff are v cooperative .. u can sit there for hrs over a coffee .. 
the best part .. i happened to leave my mobile on d table wherewe were sitting one evening .. came back after half an hr only to realize dat the cleaning staff had returned it to the management if the owner comes by .. in these treachorous days .. i salute d spirit  .. this incident may bias my ratings .. but i cant help .. can i ??

Haldiram's is a known place thanks to its existence in every part of Kolkata. Be ir Busy Brabourne Road or High Flying Ultadanga or be it the Sophisticated Ballygunge Phari Joint or the Oldest Exide Dot...you want a Haldiram you got one. I was first introduced to the Giant Sweet master by my Brother In Law who was not yet my Brother in law then. i still compare the taste of the paneer pakoda i had then with any i have now...it was too good to have. But now after decades I with a very heavy heart say that the taste the grandeur the hygiene all is lost. The food is unpalatable, numerous times i took a chance thinking this time the Chola Bhatura wont make me sick...but alas that never was the case. The sweets are not as fresh as they used to be before. Pav Bhajis are sometimes too salty or the Spices are not cooked properly. In short Haldiram has compromised with their quality of food...for what only they know.

this Food city of Haldirams at Ballygunge is the most spacious & gorgeous one - in its looks and splendor. the food is same with that of the main joint and simply splendid which can lure any core non veges to explore the veg  magic of India. kolkata has expertise in delivering some 'chatpata' veg street foods - the sultry velpuri to spicy chick-pea chaats. but when you get to enjoy them & some more types (north indian dahi varas or batatapuri to south idlis or marathi paos) in a sophisticated restaurant, its a satisfaction of another level (though it costs much & the quantity is less than sufficient for that price). i would prefer the individual items to the combo meals or thalis (though they are quite popular) over here. besides, dahi bara is an item we can't have everywhere & even if we do its taste makes me repel. this particular item is a total win in Haldirams unlike anywhere else. among the desserts my all time favorite is kesariya malai & kesariya milk shake( which is not available in this joint). also some like gulapjamun, jalebi & even malai lassi were missing here, though we hit the place late at about 7.30pm. the staffs here are not too cordial but neither hostile; & point to be noted that Haldiram is where self service prevails (you have to collect your food from the respective counters) .overall it's a cool hangout place & this joint provides an amazing view of outside.

====MOST DETAILED REVIEWS====================================
Like most other non vegetarian people, my logic is when we have a vast choices for non veg dishes ; then why would I go to a Veg restaurant? Well we usually don't go there if its not Haldirams. ;) Among 3 Haldirams Food City- Probably this one is the best. But I like the Chowrangee (Exide Crossing) one too.

FOODS:
Only Fast Food, North Indian, South Indian, Desserts. 
PRO- 
1) Almost all the products are Yummy. Chola Bhatura, Dahi Phuchka, Chaats , Massala Dosa, Massala Dhokla, Raj Kachori , Special Thaali & Rumali Thaali  are too good.
2) They are well spicy and tasty. 
3) You will love these veg dishes no matter how big flesh monger you are. 
4) Desserts are good too. Gulaab Jamun and Mawa Sweets are highly Recommended.


CON- Quantity is so average. 
Panipuri is overpriced.
{rating: 4.5/5}

SERVICE:
PRO: Its a Self Serving food mart. In house sitting arrangement is there. Central AC is there. Food is served at an affordable time gap in almost all the cases. They have a well arranged Car (4 wheeler) parking area, separately. But you have to pay for it in a hourly basis. 

CON: All the stuffs are quite active , they are not meant for delivery of food, their behavior is excellent and their maintenance of the chain of hygiene is impressive. 
{rating: 4.0/5}

AMBIANCE:
PRO: Its nice, fresh and very homely. If you have to finish some personal discussions then you can do it here. You can hang out here with friends & family. You can sit here for long hours the ambiance can make you hungry but nobody is gonna disturb you and gonna make you angry.

CON: Its less like a conventional Restaurant :P 
{rating: 4.3/5}

PRICE: Price is standard but recently it has got a lil hike.
{Rating: 4.0/5}

Nearby Alternative: (Veg)
Govinda's, Bullygunj
Mission Cafe, Gol Park


ENJOY.
Happy Monsoon.

I frequently visited this place during my two years stay in Kolkata. From Chinese to street food, they have everything that satisfies your hunger and mind you it's  very economical. Weekends can get you into waiting for a seat,  hence I preferred takeaways. Their chines combo is yummy, and the farsaans and sweets are a legend in itself. A favorite joint for students and families.

Sitting arrangement of this place is pain..specially on Weekends. You need to fight to get a table. Once you get one table other person is standing on your head while you are eating..
To get the food you need to buy token and then join another queue to get your dish. Again, there is huge fight over that. Queues are never understood.
Sandwiches, chats and dal roti are good option, chinese combo is when you quickest thing to be served.
Pave bhaji is good at times.

When my family asks me to turn into a vegetarian for few days for some pujas I prefer going to haldiram n freak out on all the chats which is really amazing .. M not fond of the Chinese meals they serve or the chola bhatura as I find too much soda into it .. But the chats are lip smacking with a good combination of chutneys and dai.. A nice place for a change ..

To start off, I must say that this place is absolutely sprawling. There is a decent variety of cuisines available; Chinese, North Indian, South Indian and the usual 'chat-samosas'. A warning to the people who expect absolute authentic cuisine, I'm sorry to say that you won't get it. That being said I do enjoy the Paw Bhajis and Chole Bhature here and I can make do with the Chinese and Pasta as well. Overall a decent place to visit, extremely spacious and fast. And while one may argue that it's a tad expensive, I'll say it's worth it. (PS : I find the Gulab Jamuns of this place extremely delicious though they are indeed a tad overpriced.)

This place is HUGE!! It lives up to its name of a Food city. This is one of the few places offering only veg where the variety on offer is excellent. 
Located unmistakably in the the Ballygunj Main road this place has two storeys.The ground floor mainly serves the usual sweets and confectioneries. There are a vast variety of sweets on offer,many atypical and unique ones. The quality is quite good and reliable. The kaju barfis,gulab jamuns and rajbhogs are few of my personal favourites.
The 1st floor is the main food court where one can choose from Indian,chinese,fast food,snacks,kulfis,mocktails and what not! The kulfi is really nice and refreshing.The main course items are okayish.The Chola batura and the chats are worth a mention though.
The place has a nice spread out relaxed feel about it.The overall ambience is perfect for a nice casual meal.
The prices are moderate and the service is self service.
Overall this is quite a decent place for a relaxing diverse meal and more so if you are a vegeterain! :)

I happen to have my months of no-non-veg-food and places like these are a big hit during those times. The Halidiram's food city at Ballygunje is pretty and you can have a wonderful time admiring the street flow while munching on your vegetarian food. I visited this place 4 days after Holi hoping to get the 'thandai' which they said is available only during the two days of Holi to my disappointment.

However, the food is tasty and reasonably priced. After ordering and getting my tummy absolutely filled with ammazing paw bhaji, kachori chat (which was a bit too sweet) I saw a man having XXXL sized chola bhatura (yes I WAS checking his plate :P )

I was so full that I could not try that but next time first thing I eat here would be Chole Bhature. I visited this place after reading a few Zomato comments and expected the place to be crowded, but it was not. I could find a nice and comfortable corner to enjoy my lunch on a sultry march afternoon. The self service of this place could be a bit of a problem if you eating alone and have a huge meal to finish. 

I would love to go back here during evening time soon! Must visit for light snacks with large groups or small. The Kesar Lassi and all forms of sweet dishes would make this place a paradise if you have a sweet tooth!

P.S. The Chinese thali did not look as awesome as the others so, try Chinese at Haldiram's only when you are done tasting ALL the Indian food that they provide.

Haldiram Food City lives up to it's name 'city' when viewed from outside. The place looks rather massive. The ground floor is the place where they sell their usual sweets and confectioneries. 
On top of it is the food court. The place is completely vegetarian and so the place is a complete no no for those who swear by meat. The seating arrangement is well spread out and relaxed. 
They have an adequately tasty Chinese combo meal and Indian thali. I particularly love their phuchkas. They can be quite a delight. And finally their jalebis and milk shakes are pretty tasty too. 
One of the most value for money restaurants in the city.

This vegetarian food court is attractively laid out, well-located and has a friendly, informal atmosphere - not to mention the great food! My friends and I have come here several times either for a quick bite or for a long lazy chat over lunch. It's nice to watch your choice of meal being prepared at the food stations right before your eyes - that way, you get to have some degree of control over what is going into your meal. 
For me, the most special item here is the chola bhatura. They prepare pindi-style channa, unlike at most other joints - the spicy, chewy chickpeas go wonderfully well with the fluffy bhatura. The pasta with white sauce is also delicious, and the portions generous enough to share. The pav bhaji serves excellent bhaji, but the pav is a little too crispy for my taste. I like the coffee and strawberry milkshake, served in little earthen tumblers. I mostly stick to these items, as I'm not very fond of chaats or South Indian. The cheerful red and yellow chairs provide a bright splash of colour, and the music is lively yet not overtly loud. 
Haldiram's gets 4.5 stars for food quality, layout and prices. Love it!

The best place for chaats and bhel puri and the likes is out there on the streets of Kolkata. However, if you decide to have all this in a more hygienic environment go to Haldiram Food City. Decent chaats and vegetarian snack options are available here. One may also opt to order the more heavier varieties of foods such that it maybe a full meal. The process if quite simple. You choose what you want to have, go ahead and pay for what you want to have and then order the same. One may stick around and watch one's order being cooked or made right in front of them or one may go and get yourself seated. There is no ambiance as such because there are mostly large groups of people eating there and making a lot of noise. However, it is always clean and seating arrangements are customisable and convenient. Food is also decent. My favourites are the dahi phuchkas, raaj kachori and chola bhatura. The dosa is also decent. 
I have visited once in a while for a evening snack but for me a meal without a non vegetarian option is incomplete so this place is never under my consideration for lunch or dinner.

I have started liking this particular joint for the ample space and peaceful, no tension environment. It is a good place for a meet with a friend or a business associate as there is no similar space from Park St?Park Circus till Gariahat. The food is typical of Haldiram's but the service is efficient. The sitting arrangement is spacious and comfortable. Self-service is sometimes a bit of a bore for lazy-bones like me but I guess it gives a bit of exercise to us. The best part is that it is easy to have a discussion with a business associate or pure catching up with a friend without much of a distraction or disturbance. Good place.

Good Environment..fully air-conditioned and prices are less.It had not been changed for years that's why me and my friends like it soo much for lunch and snacks at times.It has good sale and the ones in the counter are very well behaved.
Dahi puchka tastes awesome! Plain puchka is good. Dhoklas are great,Chinese thalis are good too and loved it as well.
Dosa(masala) tastes good.Just need to improve the pastries as i have experienced that only the cream is sweet,not the cake.Do look to it..so unfortunately 4 stars.Please improve the quality of sauce also and service needs to be quicker as well.and helpers should also be kept because one person cannot carry to dosa's together to their place in case the one with that person is a youngster,and leaving the table is risky too.Overall,good.
DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT.

The   Haldiram's  located in Ballygunge is not as good as I had expected it to be on my first visit to the place... Being near to my school I had often gone there to get a good ,delicious meal.The food is really good. I loved their papri chat ,samosas and phuchka . But the main attraction was the sweets. It's purely delightful ....practically it's heaven for people with a sweet tooth.I don't like sweets usually but it's something different when I go there. The Ladoo,kaju barfi and rhimzhim are just awesome. The chocolates are great too.. The gulabjamun is also great.The Indian Thali is great..only the naan was too tough and cold..the dal makhani was the best..Well a good place for hanging out with friends and eating delicious food.The cost is more or less value for money. 
So in my opinion you may check this place out ( you may like it! )
bon appetit

In the mood for some street food but you literally don't mean having those from street thelas due to hygienic concern ? This might be what you should look for. Haldiram Food City is located in Syed Amer Ali Avenue (Ballygunge). Its a whole large building fully dedicated to Haldiram's sweets/namkeens shop and Haldiram's restaurant. The restaurant is a veggie friendly restaurant.

When we talk of street food, all that comes to our mind is available here. All kinds of Chaats, Kachoris, Thalis, Puchkas, Chole Bhature etc. are available here. Some of my favorites are Papdi Chaat, Puchka and Raj Kachori. If you are like me who loves Puchkas (better known as Golgappa and Panipuri to non-bengalis) but fear that having them from a street vendor would land yourself in hospital because of Cholera, Typhoid and other waterborne diseases, then you would love this place as I can guarantee you that having street food from this place is thousand times safe.

Moving over to sweets/snacks section of Haldiram, I would say that all varieties of sweets have been included. One will find sweets ranging from Barfi, Ladoo, Gulabjamun, Rasogolla, Pastries etc. For snacks, all that one can think of is available here. The range starts from Patties, Samosas and a long list. The Haldiram's famous namkeens are also available in the sweet/snack section. Range of chocolates are also available in this section.

The restaurant is not at all heavy on pockets and the food they serve is lite on stomach. You may visit this restaurant for afternoon lunch or evening snacks but dinner wise the restaurant is pretty variety-less. The size of the restaurant and the sweet shop both are worth praising. There are ample of tables and even on a weekend you will find a table either instantly or after a few minutes wait. You will also see the place becoming a big gossip area and many people not ordering food or have finished their food and gossiping in groups. Ambiance wise, the place is very much pleasing but a lot of background noises may spoil your mood. Also being fact that the restaurant only has self service so making bill at one counter and then getting your items prepare at several other counters could be frustrating sometimes if you have ordered like a ton of different items. I really wish that they should hire waiters and should take orders directly from the table. This will also reduce the amount of people who don't eat anything but just choose the place for gossip or hangout.

This is a very good place for trying out variety of vegetarian snacks. While they keep both North Indian and South Indian varieties, they also have a Chinese combo which can be tried out. All the items are pretty tasty. The best thing about this place is the cleanliness. The food items can be tried safely without worrying about any health issues. The ambience too is good with ample lighting and spacious seating area. They also have a ground floor area which sells varieties of sweet meats. Must try their Chole Batura which a fabulous filling dish complete with all condiments.

Being a veggie this place has always attracted me..situated few blocks away from the birla temple and near gurusaday road..

one should try the lunch which they serve for 150 bucks. although it ain't a pocket pinch to you..but the quantity os equally small. . I prefer having something from their wide range of snacks..spicy yet sweet.. no one can beat them at these...

lovely place! Located near some of the top schools of kolkata and if you visit it after school gives over you would find this place teeming with these students..
love the chinese thali, pav bhaji and raj kachori this place has to offer..
Ambience is simple, neat and chic and on Sundays such is the popularity that you would have to wait for nearly an hour to get a place to sit! However one downside is the self-service which makes the entire dining out experience very tiring.. also time taken to receive the food is very long and service could have been much faster!
Not a big fan of the haldirams fast food items and other cakes and chocolates sold here as well!
Find the place highly overpriced but considering its posh location most people would be willing to dish out more! Mediocre at best is how to describe it!

haldirams is a good joint for veggies and not like non vegs like me... it has wide spread of food items ranging from the barfi to chatpats snacky items and samosas etc. but there is nothing extraordinary about it its the run of the mill type... just an extension of big haldiram shop with some lavishly devorated ill themed deco.

Haldirams is located near ballygunge opposite Ice skating rink. And is situated in the second top floor as far as I remember. 

I had tried vada paw here and chola bhatura.
Both were good.

Pros:-
1) pure vegetarian restaurant
2) they have good amount of tables and chairs to accommodate people 
3) maintained and hygienic
4) ambience is ok
5) service is fast
6) prices are cheap. 
7) food quality and quantity is above average. 

Cons:-
1) can serve better 
2) should even take order and not just follow self service. 

Nevertheless it was a nice experience.

I personally don't like this place. Ground floor is good but as you go above, it is super crowded and I hate the ambience. Hospitality is bad, food is not excellent, but prices are reasonable. I don't like the noisy ambience at a foodspot.

This huge food plaza disappoints on account of its size. One would have expected to find a large variety of good food here. Instead, what one gets is a lot of over-priced bad fast food, along with the Haldiram's range of products.

The place is very antiseptic in appearance, but it compensates by having dirty tables and broken chairs. The self-service option means that the staff stay behind the counter all the time and rarely come out to see how the customers are managing.  The few sweepers on duty take a lot of time to clean anything.

The food is quite bad. Items that should be served hot are not always served so, making them difficult to eat. The portions are very small and seem to decrease on every visit. The fancy baked items are best avoided - standard snacks would be the only thing recommended here. Overall, not a good place to visit.

A very good place for vegetarians which is located in Ballygunge, opposite to the CCFC. 
Out of the three floors, the first two are food courts and the third one is a supermarket. 
The food courts are very spacious with comfortable seating arrangements. You'll find 
chocolates, desserts and snacks in the ground floor food court. I love the mushroom patties, 
mango cheesecake, laddoo, kaju barfi and most of the other sweets. Though all the sweets are amazingly good and reasonably priced, I would rather not recommend their firni (which lacks the taste of authentic firni). The major attraction is the confectionery which consists of 
an ample range of candies and chocolates including different types of marshmallows.
 On the first floor, one can avail the combo meals and thalis for a heavier fare. I personally like their chhola bhatura better, with a glass of kesariya lassi to finish off.
This place relies on self service and I find the system time saving and efficient.
Overall, it is worth a visit if you're hungry or you can just sit for hours with a friend over a cup of cardamom tea and a tidbit.

Located conveniently near the Gurusaday crossing, this place is a popular hangout for youngsters and the old alike. Spread over three floors, the ground floor is a confectionery and a bakery , the first floor being the food court and the second being sort of a supermarket. It actually is a great place if you love vegetarian food, for the choice of menu as well as the quality. Stuff I have always loved are the Chhola Bhathura, Pav Bhaji and the Thalis. The Gajar ka Halwa is a delight as also are the cakes they make. Crowds are huge and it is often difficult to get a place on weekdays and weekends alike if you have a slightly big group. A 4 on 5 for haldirams.

This place is indeed very popular among college folks and middle aged women doing kitty parties,for the wonderful meals which come at very reasonable rates. The Chinese combo meal has forever been my favourite,recently they have started serving chilli paneer as well in the meal. Their north Indian special thali is equally fantastic. For a light snack,foodies may try chana batura or dosa or raj kachori which is excellent. Great ambience,has a confectionary section downstairs which is also worth a try. I believe this place doesn't need any recommendation !

It's a great place to hangout with friends, especially when you have a large group! The first thing that strikes you is how huge the whole premise is. I am especially fond of the ground floor, which is stacked up with different kinds of chocolates, out of which the assorted box is a favorite of mine. Although it's a pure vegetarian restaurant, I have never felt the lack of options out here.

Had a not too great experience here this afternoon. Actually had got stuff packed Sunday night, chhole bhature for me and a thali for the better half. I liked the look of the veg thali and the paneer masala it had. Decided to try it for myself... so opted for the special thali.

Took the coupon and went top the counter. Was not terribly happy with the quantity served, and the way it was dished out. Was given an option of two vegetables (out of paneer palak, veg kofta, aloodum). I chose the not so nicely made palak paneer and the kofta which had gravy poured over it later!. There was kali dal, not as good as Sunday's. Had an option of 2 roomalis / 2 rotis or 1 butter naan. Chose the former. Also got some dryish pulao with it. The salad was sloppily put over the pickle, which I find annoying with the tastes getting mixed up. There was also a gulab jamun, which was dry and kind of hard. Sad. All for Rs 120 plus tax. I had a Thums Up to go with it, which, mercifully was up to the mark.

Tried a kulfi after that. The man was working on cleaning a freezer and he did not even wash his hands before serving out the kulfi. The plastic bowl it was served in looked dirty. There were marks on it and I took it back and they served me a fresh one. It was rather badly done. Not creamy enough at all for the almost Rs 60 it cost. Was icy!

Disappointing!

Incidentally, on the ground floor where they sell mithai, they have their own bakery products. I had tried the multigrain bread an dit was surprisingly good. Was a tad disappointed with it last time though. One of the counters that had some chocolate like stuff had cockroaches in the food area.

This place is very near to my home, its always a good idea to go here in weekdays as you can enjoy your food without having to wait for tables or stand in a long line to order. the menu is limited just like the fast food outlet but its good . I have tried samosa, dahi puchka, chats of all kinds, Masala dosa, Chinese combo meal, pav bhaji, chola batura, gulab jamun etc. and its pretty obvious that I have not tried everything on one day, I have been a regular here. whatever I have eaten here is good, at the ground floor they have different kinds of sweet which we always order from here. this is the only place in kolkata where I eat vegetarian and Like it as well.

Well haldiram's at ballygunge means a lot more than just any other restaurants or joints to me. I had my first date over here. It is a four stored building with a great capacity to accommodate people. The food court is basically divided into two parts. The ground floor is for bakery and desserts and the upstairs is for multi cuisine foods. 
We usually used to go upstairs as we were intended to have lunch or snacks. There are two big led tvs where music channels are shown. And if the tvs are turned off, songs are always played in the floor.
The quality of food is good. I like chana batura, masala dosa, cheese pizza, dahi vada, papdi chat etc etc. A unique thing I ever tasted here is chinese vel. Whenever I went there for lunch, I used to take chinese thali. It is a total meal for one within a such low price. It consists of fried rice, noodles, veg manchurian, chilli potato and a unique salad. The items are cooked very good and I love their cleanliness.
It is a cool place to hang out with your friends as well as family. The only drawback from my end is that it serves veg foods only. Otherwise a very good place.

Taste some interesting delicacies at Haldiram Food City

Kolkata is known as a food lover's paradise. In every nook and corner of the city one comes across food joints, fast food centres and restaurants. The city not only prides itself on its lip-smacking Bengali cuisine which attracts foodies from all over the world, Kolkata is one place where one can get the taste of world cuisine. Whether you want to dig into scrumptious Marwari delicacies or just want to have some Mexican bites, you are sure to find popular restaurants in Kolkata that offer all these cuisines. In recent years, the city has witnessed a mushroom growth of some top quality food joints that offer a variety of north Indian, Chinese and continental delicacies under one roof. Now if someone wants to try some authentic Marwari food as well as Chinese delicacies they can rarely find it in one restaurant. Among the varied food plazas that offer awesome Marwari, South Indian, Gujrathi, Chinese and Italian food as well as chaats, sandwiches and desserts, Haldiram Food City deserves special mention.

Haldiram's has many branches in Kolkata. However, I have only been to their Ballygunge Park branch. Located just opposite CCFC, Haldiram Food City is one place that any foodie would love to visit again once they taste the yummy chaats, snacks and other delicacies here. The plush food joint, sprawling over three floors is frequented by food lovers all the time. Though the place is not spotlessly clean, hygiene is one factor that is not overlooked here. The management at Haldiram's makes sure everyone wear gloves and caps while serving food. What I like about Haldiram's is that it offers some awesome street food served hygienically. I particularly like their papdi chat, kachori chat, raj kachori, puchkas, masala dosa and rumali thali (consisting 1 rumali or tandoori roti, dal makhani, one sanji, peas pulao, pickles and onion).

If you have a sweet tooth, then Haldiram's is definitely the right place for you! The taste of their kesaria rasmalai or kesaria kulfi faluda will linger in your mouth even after a long time. The next time you are near it, just drop in to try some of their succulent delicacies.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE VISITING THIS PLACE! An awesome place to hang out with and chit-chat with buddies.. this is a self-serve restaurant. I can never give up having their paneer dhokla and lassi kesaria which has been a longgg time favourite of mine along with the Kesariya Chai (a must try!) And yes, I always make it a point to pick up a packet of BROWN BREAD from their bakery section because it tastes heavenly. 


P.S.I have walked in a lot of times to find Himesh Reshammiya playing in the background.

If you like to eat chaat then Haldiram Food City is a good place to stop by. However it is certainly not where you get the best chaat in the city. On the plus side the food is hygenic , decently priced and ofcourse vegetarian. Personally I like the Raj Kachori and Samosa/Kachori Chaat as well as the Chola Bhatura. The Jalebi's are nice too. I am not too excited by the other stuff , its quiet ordinary and please don't expect much in terms of the ambience as its a noisy and crowded place.

OK, unlike the previous reviewer, I cannot vouch for the hygiene levels in this place (everything is made with unprotected hands!) But we did move from the US, so our standards may be different. However, the food does taste good, especially the chaat. They also do a good job of the Masala dosa and since we are south Indians, we know what we are talking about, at least in that department! Not so crazy about their veggie pizza or veggie burger though. Being vegetarians, we really love the concept. One thing that drove us nuts though was the loud music on the first floor, where the restaurant is, especially since we had a small infant with us. On the positive side, the place wasn't crowded at all for lunch on a Sunday and the elevator near the entrance made it easy for us to move about, even with a baby stroller. The ground floor is strictly for the sweet tooth, but be sure to stop by for a huge selection of both traditional mithai and pastries!

There is parking in the back but seems like they only have enough spots for a handfull of cars - certainly doesn't match the seating capacity of the restaurant.

Haldiram Food City.. It is located in Ballygunge. In a nutshell, it serves hygenic street food. It is Always (over) crowded, you can hardly get a table free especially during the peak hours of lunch and dinner but also otherwise. It is VERY annoying. The food is very reasonably priced but because it is double the street food prices so many consider such reasonable prices to be high :| Food is very okayish. If you want to grab a quick bite, it is fine. I like the Raj Kachori here. Almost everything else available here is pretty ordinary. It's just that you can be sure of the better quality than street food, but not the taste, maybe. Non Vegetarian Lovers, Sorry to say but this place is Strictly Vegetarian. Two stars from me.

Indian food - Chaat - Thali Meals - Samosa - Beverage ... all... its a one stop shop for everything you like. From Dal Makhni to Malpua, you'll get everything in one store. The perfect place for a quick grub. It is pocket friendly and has nice air conditioned atmosphere. Chola Bhatura is a must try here. It is perfectly made, with an array of other things along with it. A complete meal cheap price.. the north Indian thali gives you everything from roti to rice which comes at a very cheap price as well.

Ground floor's for desserts and chocolate ice cream scoop and in 1st floor you can find South Indian, Indian, Chinese veg dishes.
Ambiance is quite nice. Nice seating arrangements and lots of seats.
Masala dhosa is okay. But Must try Chola Batura, it is awesome. 
Noodles, Fried Rice and Veg Manchurian Combo is okay.
I tried lots of desserts. Desserts are very good, Specially pastries and Kaju Borfi And the Choco Cake.
Service is quick. Staffs are okay.
Quality and quantity both are good.
But the prices are quite expensive.
Over all its a good place to hangout with some nice veg dishes and desserts.

Very expensive. Food is strictly OK. The ambience is good, and it is quite spacious. But they have very limited type of sweets. Mostly dry variety. There are better sweet shops in Kolkata which are much cheaper and better. The store in clean, but apart from the look I did not see anything special in the store. It is good for people who wants vegeterian options. Kolkata has better restaurants and sweet shops than Haldiram's. Once again, very very expensive. A simple Kaju katli is Rupees 7 per peice ( that is the lowest priced item). In Kolkata there are many better sweet shops which sell the same item for much cheaper and the quality is either the same or better.
