One of the worst bar cum restaurant in kolkata.
The bars license should be cancelled.
They charge all types if taxes & when the customers protest they threaten to beat them up.
They even claim to be a government run bar.
I can't understand how this bar is still running despite all it's irregularities.

Avoid this third grade place at all costs... MOON bar, beside Diamond Plaza mall, situated on this very road is much better than this place... NIGHT QUEEN, KINGSTON (just opposite Night Queen) are among the worst bars of Kolkata. Very bad atmosphere. Tasteless food....

Typical bad place. Seriously its nothing but a dance bar. People throw away notes like " খোলামকুচি", rates are standard, one large peg of BP would cost you 170 rupees. I have not tried any food item over there but trust me, U wd be lucky if u dont try them. A very unhealthy environment, smoke, below average standard people with gutkha. Waitors are still "ok". Predominantly, Arsalan is just beside, so if u have placed any order over there and waiting for it to be delivered, drop in here to have few pegs or a beer may be. That's it!!

Cheap crowd gathers with the nightfall and sleaze bags trying to get drunk or if possible look drunk to score some random bar dancers, drooling on their drinks which is mostly adulterated with cheap plonks. I have been here once and have sworn never to come back.

Had to walk into this one as there was no other option and hunger was driving me crazy. I started regretting the decision as soon as I walked in. Bad food, bad ambiance and overpriced. To anyone who might come across this review, I strongly advise to stay away from this place. Go for anything else.

An absolute nonsense is what this restaurant cum bar was found by us. The ambience is absolutely cheap like a dance bar. The drink they serve is diluted with cheaper brands or water- I am  100% sure. They will play lousy music so hard that you cant hear your own team. Cheapness, Lousiness and Crappiness is what describes this place.  Oh yes, the food served at road side places are more tasty than this one.
I think its an illegal dance bar that operates under the disguise of normal bar. Guys. ... please AVOID.
