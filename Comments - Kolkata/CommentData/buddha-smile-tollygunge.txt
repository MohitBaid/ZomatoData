We live nearby and had never tried the place...we were supposed to have veg that day, we didnt think having veg Chinese would be a good idea but the restaurant's food proved us wrong. Amazing soups.

I have taken Chinese item. Food quality is really bad according to price, quantity is also less. While eating ,  I feel that the food is from a street counter like small shop, I can't say it a restaurant. I will not recommend it to anyone.

This place is situated at Netaji Nagar ,Tollygunge. The interior is spacious compared to other restaurants in this area. Coming to food we were utterly dissapointed. Altough the biriani was fine, the butter chicken was disastrous,Tandoori roti were hard.And to add to it the price was excessive compared to the food they served.

Went there on Ashtami. Chinese dishes prices had been hiked by 100bucks. Settled for Biriyani. Sadly Biriyani was tasteless. Absolutely bland. No seasoning. Only good thing is they gave two chicken pieces and 1pc of aloo per plate of Biriyani. The chicken pieces were really well cooked.

Went there on Ashtami night with sis and Mom. They had nice d√©cor. The Buddha statues and the lamps made for a nice ambience. They had hiked the prices of the Chinese dishes by 100rs. So, had to settle for Indian. We ordered two Chicken Biriyani. We were served without much delay. The Biriyani was served in a small steel Handi. The portions were really small. It's not even enough for one person with medium appetite. There were two pieces of Chicken and two pieces of aloo in each handi though which was nice. And the Chicken was really well cooked. But the taste of Biriyani was awful. It didn't even taste like Biriyani. No seasoning at all. It was not a nice meal at all. The bill was around 350. They charge GST.

I went there with my family and ambience was nice with Tibetan designs and various Buddha Statues. The staffs were courteous and always smiling and asking for feedbacks on how they can improve.

As far as the taste goes I'd say it was bit pale. I won't say bad but pale. So definitely there are lot of rooms for improvement on the taste. We ordered lots of dishes starting from Chicken Hot and Sour Soup which was bit pale, Pan Fried Chilli Fish was very good I'd say, BBQ Chicken was nice too, Buddha Special Mixed Fried Rice and Buddha Special Chicken Fried Rice which was again pale, Chicken in Schezuan Style was pale again, Hot Garlic Chicken which was good, Kung Pao Chicken which was pale too. We also had Mixed Noodles which was good and Hopan Rice Noodles which was good too.

Though in the end they do assured to improve the taste on our next visit as they are looking foreword for new Executive Chef by October.

Located at Netaji Nagar. This place caters to a variety of Chinese cuisines. Had ordered Pan Fried veg noodles BBQ chicken and Drums of Heaven. And boy, the mushrooms in the pan fried noodles were cooked to perfection almost melted in my mouth. Talking about the pan-fried noodles, there were equal portions of fried and boiled noodles. The BBQ chicken lacked the hint of spices somewhere and the Drums of Heaven was tender and juicy on the inside and had that right amount of crispiness on the outside. Overall, a nice dining experience.
The place was previously named as Tung Naam, and the decoration of the restaurant is pretty much the same. 
That's pretty much it! Looking forward to dine in again!

Just disgusting. First of all, went to it when its name was Tung Nam. According to the appearance, we thought it to be some great food joint. As we were discussing the menu, the waitor insisted to order food as per his choice but we didn't. We ordered for chicken lollypop. When it came, we found as soon that the chicken pieces were dipped in any sort of coloring liquid and was made look like spiced up lollipop pieces (orange colored). And as we proceeded eating, we found very uncooked and unprocessed chicken pieces as well as the overlying skin of the bird to be attached with more than one chicken piece. We literally could not have the food anymore, felt like vommitting it out as much we had taken and wasted the rest there immediately. But as we complained the same to the waitor, he seemed unbothered about the complain and tried to make us convince that chicken lollipop is being made like that and taste like that too, which was quite surprising and shocking too. Its the same restaurant again in a different name with same guys. Will never visit it again any day.

This place was previously named Tung Naam.
Interesting fact is,the staffs are same.Especially the waiter who took our order.He had some allergy to listen about what we wanted the food to be.
We ordered two starters of Chicken,which were that waiters choice.Our demand were,do not make it hot and spicy.
What he served was extreamely hot and spicy.We complained,he listened but said that the food he serves tastes like that only.
He did the same thing when the Restaurants name was Tung Naam.Just repeated.
Will never visit this place.
And the review is solely my personal opinion & experience,other's experience may vary.

Devouring Chinese food on weekends is extremely common amongst Bengalis. They need to have either some satisfying Chinese meal or some Kolkata style biriyani to satiate their taste buds and they wait patiently the entire week for these weekend gastronomic getaways, either with Chinese or with Mughlai cuisine. At least I have many friends (who are very busy in their professional lives) who follow this weekend eating out pattern. Lately we found the eating out options have increased exponentially in Kolkata. Food scenes and food related awareness are rapidly changing in this city, but this old habit of eating some Chinese food once in a while is still there existing in most of our lives! I specially love the old school Chinese and the ones which are cooked home style! So, like me if you are also looking for a pocket friendly restaurant serving lip smacking, amazing home style Chinese dishes, then ‚ÄòBuddha Smile‚Äô is surely the best available option. Few days back I was invited to this place for a food tasting session and I was simply mesmerized by the simplicity and flavors of each and every dish which was served.

Being a lover of Chinese cuisine, I'm always on the lookout for new options for Chinese food! And Kolkata never stops surprising me, as I always end up finding a hidden gem here and there! Buddha Smile is one such hidden gem near Netaji Nagar which will satiate your Chinese cravings to the core!

I was invited at a food tasting event here and it made my day! The place is beautiful. It is not your regular, dingy, stuffed eating house - Buddha Smile is spacious and well lit, since there are two walls made of glass! One can imagine how radiant such a place would look.

Without beating around the bush let me just start with the amazing spread.

STARTERS :

‚Ä¢ Bok Choy with Shitake Mushrooms - This is a very healthy and delicious veg dish with bokchoy, mushrooms and garlic. The bokchoy was juicy and had a mild flavour. The gorgeous glazed Shitake mushrooms and tender green bokchoy were tossed in soya sauce. If you're a fan of Veg food, you need to try this out!

‚Ä¢ Pepper Chilli Prawn - This was the perfect start to a perfect meal. The prawns were batter fried and were juicy inside. The prawns were tossed in black pepper, chillies and spring onion and tasted brilliant.

‚Ä¢ Roast Pork Chilli - Here comes the best dish of the afternoon. Being a pork lover, I'm more than enthusiastic about trying different pork dishes. So this was a stunning preparation. The pork was roasted using five spices and was tossed in chilli and soya sauce. The texture of the pork was smooth and soft, just the way I like it! Delicious!

‚Ä¢ Pork Spare Ribs - This is one of the best pork ribs I've ever tasted. The ribs were tossed in sweet and spicy chef's special sauce and was cooked on slow fire, thus giving it the perfect smoky flavour. This dish is highly recommended and if you step out of Buddha Smile without ordering this heavenly dish, you're surely missing out on life.

MAIN COURSE :

‚Ä¢ Double Pan Fried Noodles - Crispy fried noodles served with exotic vegetables, this tasted amazing! There was an abundance of veggies making it quite healthy if you forget the part that the noodles are fried! Honestly, I've always had a soft spot for fried noodles and this dish does absolute justice to my love for noodles. The light brown sauce added immense flavour to the noodles.

‚Ä¢ Seven Jewel Rice - The name has always intrigued me, and finally I got a chance to try out this dish. Studded with seven different ingredients such a bell peppers, carrots, spring onions, this fried rice is loaded with flavour. If you love fried rice, then this dish is absolutely recommended!

‚Ä¢ Steam Chicken - Sliced chicken was tossed in brown sauce and soya sauce giving it a very aromatic flavour. The chicken had a very subtle flavour which was enhanced by the use of garlic. The chicken pieces were tender and went great with the fried rice!

‚Ä¢ Prawn Spicy Hoi Sein with Tofu - I simply loved this dish! Fried prawns (my favourite) and tofu were tossed in the spicy hoi sein sauce, as a result of which the gravy turned out to be sweet and tangy. Oh how I loved this dish! The inclusion of tofu was quite an innovative idea, I must admit. But the prawns clearly stole the show! Strongly recommended! Oh and it tasted brilliant with the fried noodles!

DESSERT :

‚Ä¢ Toffee Banana with Ice-cream - The brilliant afternoon ended on a brilliant note with this amazing dessert. I'm not really fond of banana but this dessert completely blew my mind. The banana toffees were batter fried and coated with honey and sesame. Ah! Delicious! The ice-cream added to the brilliance of this dish. If you want to try out something new and innovative, go for this dessert, because it is bound to surprise you!

This is a homely place which definitely is a must visit. The residents of Tollygunge get a new and absolutely fantastic Chinese restaurant. Oh I'm so jealous! The pricing is reasonable, and the service is prompt. Each of the dishes are prepared with a lot of care and love, and that needs to be applauded. Buddha Smile, my friend is a must visit for every fanatic of Chinese cuisine.
All my love to Team Buddha Smile!

A very decent place to dine in especially with a large group. Comfortable and spacious one I must say. Prompt service üëç
Its moderately decorated with nice lamps and Budhha paintings. I really admired the painting there.
Well food was good too.. neither spicy nor too pale. One plate is enough for two.
We had Chicken chilli plum that was more of hot n sour flavour. Mixed rice was tasty.
Tried out their fried ice cream which was really amazing.. It was coated with cakey flavour and garnished with chocolatey sauce.
YUMM!

I ordered in Zomato order they accepted the order where min order was 99 I ordered of 340 they told that your location is more than 2km so you have to order more than 500. Order cancelled due to no available staff to deliver it. If there is no staff why they want to be on Zomato order. Never order from this restaurant. You will get more hunger but food will not come.

If you live in Kolkata, and you are a foodie, then you probably love Chinese. I, for one, particularly enthusiastic about it. The opening of a new Chinese restaurant somewhere close by is the definition of ‚Äògood news‚Äô for me. And, the feelings that rise from my stomach and fill my heart when that place puts good food on my plate are the defnitions of happiness and contentment. Recently, I received an invitation to join the opening dinner at Buddha Smile. And, as you must have already guessed, I excitedly went to attend the invitation, in pursuit of the said happiness and contentment!
