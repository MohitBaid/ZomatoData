Horrible food. Fish fry costs 150 rs. Per piece. My uncle bought 10 pieces for a party. Not only did he face criticism, people got sick by just tasting it. The fish tasted stale and had a very bad odour. By the way this is a live review. We are at the party, and everyone around me is trying to wash the taste of the stale fish off of their mouths.

Food was tasty. Great quantity. Add more varieties of  tasty bengali dishes to your menu! The decor is really nice. Well done, for a start. A place certainly recommended for dining out with family or friends.
