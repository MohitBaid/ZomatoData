Been at this small joint twice along with an office colligue. Both times for lunch and the items we ordered were the same. Laccha Paratha and Chicken Kosha. The quality was very good and extremely pocket friendly. I would like to mention here that this place doesnt have a big seating place, infact its very tiny. So I would recommend for Take Out from here.

Good place. Good people. Lacks seatting arrengement. good for take aways. But also they now give less quantity of biryani in one box than they used to previously. Must be due to tax and stuff i guess. Also the older brother taha is good natured. Than the younger one, forgot his name tho.

Its a small fast food take away joint just opposite to Denzong's Kitchen New Alipore. Its been 5-6 months i came to know abou this place and the very first thing i tried was an Egg Roll and they didnt disappoint. Then i upgraded my roll to a mutton roll and chicken roll and tbh one of the best rolls you will have in and around Behala. Mutton rolls are hardly available but their chicken roll is a must try and wanna try out mutton u might think of Mutton Tikiya Roll for once wont disappoint.

Its near my house and its a take away outlet. They make one of the best biriyani in kolkata. Price is budget friendly and awsome taste and quantity is also very good. Biriyani lovers must try.

This place is just a couple of minutes from my house. It's known for it's rolls mostly. I love them. But that I tried their biriyani. Honestly speaking, it was really good. The taste was amazing. Kinda light. And the price is also too low. :D

Its a take way joint in sahapur colony new alipore (beside saini hyundai showroom). Its a take away joint . They serve one of the best biriyanis in the south kolkata. I love their chicken biriyani. And it will only cost you 100 bucks. :o and mind you they are not the franchise of haji saheb. Yes next comes the rolls and kebabs. Kebabs are juicy and soft which are appetizing and flavorful . And their rolls are to die for. Succulent.  Specially their chicken rolls. Pocket pinch :-  200 approx. Thumbs up.  And am a regular customer. :) way to go guys.

Needless to say I was compelled to visit the place when there was no restaurant open in a Sunday evening. they have a very small place to eat in the first floor which is hot like anything and full of smoke. it is actually a take away counter. the biryani is not bad also the kebabs. the chicken kassa was under cooked. it's not a place to worth visiting.

Nice Mughlai restaurant  but d food is ok when compared to other Mughlai restaurants. Very crowded sometimes probably bcoz of the mouth watering food items on d display. Good to have a meal here.

Well its a crowded sweaty place situated in a by-lane in sahapur colony and nearly eclipsed by the variety of good eateries around. The place is crowded in the evenings as people hop in for rolls. Takeaway is recommended as they have no proper sitting area. Coming to the food the chicken biriyani is pretty tasteless and bland. The rolls are
a bit too oily for my preference but its the best bet considering the other items on the menu. The chicken dopiaza was overcooked but the rotis are good (whatever could go wrong with that). This probably should be your last resort if you are in the area.

Basically a moughlai restaurant im Sahapur Colony of New Alipore with takeaway and home delivery facility ,no dine in.We ordered the Mutton Tikia 30rs each and Rumali roti 5rs  each quite reasonable .
        Tastewise the Tikia and gravy was tasty but the mutton in the Tikia was very fibrous and the dish was rich and heavy beyond expection.

The very first thing that came to my mind when I saw this restaurant, that it was too cosy for anyone to sit and have a peaceful meal. so a "takeway" is something which is highly recommended here. If we talk about the location its situated in a lane which is a residential area and gathers decent number of customers..This place is the best if you are in a hurry and you want to taste a bit of mughlai items..The chicken and the mutton biryani they offer is somewhat good the price is reasonable. If you are looking for some curry items then this is not the place for you as all the curries are of same tastes and you cannot even make out if  its a korma or a kasa untill and unless you see the bill..

Haji's Kitchen - Not too Brilliant but Okay, Eatable. 
============================================
Brief: Haji's Kitchen is located at the small lane before you head towards Gupta brother from new Alipore petrol pump. It is located inside that small Sahapur colony lane on the left hand side where previously few Chinese fast food kiosks were there. I had tried this place quite some time back when it had just opened. The Biriyani prices at that particular time were kept quite quite low. 
=====================================================================
Food ordered: 

Had ordered:- 

1) Chicken Biriyani - The biriyani was satisfactory for the prices charged. It had oil on the higher side and the chicken meat had to be a little more cooked. 
=====================================================================
Recent News: 

Recently, they had been providing with some white chicken and something. They are trying to catch the crowd but not sure, whether people will prefer it in the long run or not. 
=====================================================================
Summary: 

Food presentation 3/5
Food quality 3/5
Food quantity 3.5/5
Taste 3.5/5
Hygiene 2.5/5
Ambience 3/5
Value for money 3.5/5
=====================================================================
Conclusion: 

A very average place with no parking space and is located inside a small lane. Takeaway Preferred.
