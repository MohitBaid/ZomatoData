It's a very nice place for food . The variety of drinks I am not much aware of , but the food is very good . Staff quality can improve though . Ambience is also okay . The biggest plus point for me is that it's only 5 mins walk from my place

The best thing that we liked was the option of NOT listening to the music.

Most of the bars in and around Kalyani Road Crossing are Singing bars. Here they have kept it separate with a different entry.

Food: Okay, with some good starters. Always better to be guided by the order takers rather than being experimental.

Certainly value for money and this place serves all the liquors in a very reasonable price.

Ambience is shabby but with working AC, you are not looking for something too bad, it's a quiet place to share few drinks with friends and hangout for some time.

I found it fine...

Few options of beer brands,ambience is average,specially decoration is poor,not well maintained, but its pocket friendly,i dont like like the dance and music floor,and didnt even visit that floor,bcoz the music and dance is so cheap and can entertain only cheap people,but if u have low in pocket,must try dream(apart from music and dance floor), try chicken 'jhaal' fry, chicken omlet, and chicken capsicum with your desired drinks..

A pocket freindly bar on the Barasat road, Dream's usp is in its cost effective menu. There isn't much to write about the food, starters would be the safest option and not too many drinks from the bar menu are available, so if you are choosy abot what goes in your glass, it would be better to give this place a miss.However, having said that, if you are a high school guy or a college goer, and if you are out with friends craving for a drink and some laid back time,come over. Cheers

this place is only for guys and it is d best budget bar in barrackpore. the ambiance is lousy but who cares when you get a large peg of blenders pride at rs 115. overall its clean ,the waiters are very friendly,quality of food is ok for drinks though i never went beyond starters. the best part is that they allow to have a fag.
if you stay near barrackpore and wish to have a drink in ac for minimum price then go for it
