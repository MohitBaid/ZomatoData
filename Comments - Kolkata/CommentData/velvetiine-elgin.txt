Velvetiine is cute and cozy bakery shop at Rye Street, Elgin Road, Kolkata. It has quite a variety of shakes, cakes and pastries that are a visual treat and tastes heavenly.. They have 3 branches in Kolkata and this the newly opened one. I tried a few things and the mixing and level of sweetness was perfect. Do try this bakery with the ones you know are a sweet tooth and kids. They will love it...

A Bakery is a place where products such as bread, cake, and pastries are baked or sold.  The art of baking origins from the Roman Empire. The Romans loved baked products and it had a rapid growth in it’s fame.  Gradually baked goods were demanded at feasts and weddings. Baking was finally a respectable profession and was an well known occupation.  Bakers started preparing stuff at their home and slowly baking was being promoted throughout Europe and soon expanded to Eastern and South-Eastern part of Asia.

This newly opened bakery , tucked in a bylane near Bhawanipur college is a place to be before the new year. The bakery has a variety of cakes , cookies and pastries . Tried the orange mousse which was creamy and delicious though not overtly sweet. The fruit cakes, plum cakes, and dundee cakes were soft, freshly baked and tempting. I loved the different shaped cookies which will be loved by all especially the children.Do pay a visit to the bakery to buy freshly baked cakes, pastries and cookies.

There’s something special about Velvetiine. It’s a tiny bakery located at Ray Street, tucked away in the lane opposite Aqua Jaca, Sarat Bose Road. But, once you reach it, you will have a tempting blast of colours from all the cookies and cupcakes and other delightful goodies to welcome you. Mark my words, you will be highly confused about what to pick. And, once you put your first pick into your mouth, you will want to go back for more! But, what’s special about Velvetiine is more than the pretty and delicious desserts, but the rusticity and warmth with which they welcome everyone. And, that rusticity is very much present in each and every item on the Christmas Special Menu at Velvetiine, Kolkata.

A small pretty bakery shop tucked in lanes near rashbihari restricting to vegetarian and eggless options. The veg savouries failed fascinating a nonvegan like me , after a thorough scrutiny i opted for a slice of Red velvet cake. The cake was moist with decent amount of cream cheese layering , quality seemed impressive but at steep 100 bucks was bit overpriced . The celebration cakes looked decoratively luscious , looking forward to order one soon!

Very average chocolate truffle cake. Even on specifying to use less cream , the cake was too creamy. Decoration was also poor, the greeting was written in red colour which was hardly visible.

I have been there and had their chocolate cupcake which costed Rs.100.. personally i think that amount for such a small cupcake is too much. I more of felt dizzy after having that loads of weird tasting cream on top and the cake itself tasted salty and sweet (didnt hit my tastebuds). Well the experience was NOT pleasant, but i hope to try out their cheesecake once...

This bakery is located just in the opposite lane of the gurudwara in kalighat. The entrance is pretty sweet and they provide a varied range of sweet goodies! From birthday cakes to pastries to cookies or chocolates, these people make almost everything which is sweet!
They also have a variety of savoury picks! We tried the rainbow jar cake and belgian chocolate cake jar and both were super tasty!

We also received a diwali hamper as sweet gesture and we loved it! It consists of nilgiri cookies, veg burger, assorted chocolates like mango truffle, pan choc, rose chocolate and the list goes on!
If you are looking to gift your loved ones some delicious sweetness then Velvetiine is the best pick! Udit Kapoor

Received Diwali Hamper for Tasting & Review @ Velvetiine, Kolkata☺

Velvetiine sent me a cute pink-peach hued - rose printed - basket shaped - thick paper hamper with big peach colored satin bows on both sides of it's paper handle. And I felt Happy Valentine's!

Immediately a kid nearby bursted a cracker, which also bursted my upcoming train of mushy thoughts, and I realized that it was Happy Diwali! Promptly I wheeled back to the pious cum fun mode that kick-started with the onset of just over Durga Puja!

India is a land of festivals. Good food consumption and offerance of the same is an integral part of our celebration. With time, though people still associate a particular selection of food with a particular festival, but at large they consume and/or offer anything that catches their fancy or gives them joy. 

Resultantly, during Diwali, along with home chefs and traditional mithai shops, most of the bakeries and patisseries also gear up with their attractively packaged Diwali platters.

Velvetiine, the Kalighat based dessert parlour is one such establishment that is all set with it's own set of cute Diwali Platters. Velvetiine specializes in customized desserts and their home delivery.

And who doesn't like to receive a platter of chocolatey goodies? Even Big B (the Bollywood Shehenshah) holds a Dairy Milk Chocolate and mouths the line 'Kuch meetha ho jaye' every Diwali, right inside our living rooms and bedrooms, via our humble TV!

My Diwali Hamper consisted of - 

- 2  Veg Corn Hot Dogs: The hot dogs were long oval breads, with their centres scooped out throughout the length, and filled with cheesy mayonnaise rich mixture containing corns kernels and julienned colored bell peppers.

- 2 Mango Truffles, 2 Paan Bourbons, 1 Almond Truffle, 1 Lime Truffle, 1 Nutella Stick: These were an assortment of chocolate and butter rich sweet munchies in different shapes and flavors. Some of them even contained chocolate dipped biscuits.

- 1 Belgium Chocolate Dessert Jar - It was a mini jar, like that of a jam, filled with alternate layers of dark chocolate cream and cake crumble, topped with a rose shaped chocolate and garnished with a generous portion of chocolate chips and caramelized almonds. The lid was covered with some decorative cloth, golden ribbon etc. for visual appeal.

All the items were nice. The desserts would pair well with a cup of coffee post dinner, or even otherwise.

Pricing of Hamper: Rs. 650/- approximately.

Note: The wooden tray and melamime plates used in the pics are from my personal collection. They were not sent by Velvetiine.

This is a rather small place located in Rashbihari Avenue. I was stunned by the pastries and desserts displayed which caught my eye as soon as I entered the place. Till date I never tried desserts at mio amore so I had a very tough selection. While my friend chose to have a chocolate pastry sprinkled on the top with white chocolate, I chose a 5 layered chocolate pastry sandwiched with nutella and Belgium chocolate. Both of them tasted heavenly. However, this place lacks proper sitting arrangements. Apart from that, everything about this place is perfect.

​Desserts form an eternal part of a meal. I always prefer to end my meal on a rather sweet note. Be it a sweet or a pastry, desserts are very close to my heart. Talking about my recent favourites in the city, there’s one such place which has somewhat left an impression in my mind, which always happens to drag me whenever I’m nearby. The place is none other than the patisserie, ‘Velvetiine‘ !

Cake shops aren’t new to the city. However patisseries or the new age boutique cake shops that have opened up recently are an welcome change from the monotony of pastry & snacks chains like monginis ( I liked this name more than mio amore) & the sugarr & spice. Sure Flurys, Cakes & Just Baked outlets did change the scenery of bakery , but they lacked the personalized touch the new patisseries have to offer.
Velvetiine is one such patisserie near Rashbehari crossing. Located in the lane opposite to the gurdwara , this year old shop makes some great egg less desserts. Apart from regular pastries, cakes & snacks they also sell made to order customized cakes. Do note though that they don’t have any seating arrangement as such, as they are primarily a take away & delivery outlet. Recently they invited members of our group PanchPhoron to try out some of their items specially introduced keeping the festival of Rakshabandhan in mind. We tried some of the items they had to offer.......

Velvetiine was a sad outlet. Soon after we entered, we realised that it was hotter inside than it was outside. The water vapour on the clear glass cake dome didn't make matters better. 
Hesitatingly, we ordered for a blueberry cheesecake which was served to us on a paper plate, already making us feel as if we're in for a 'monginis' or 'kathleen' kind of experience. Nevertheless, we went ahead and gave it a shot, only to realise that the top layer of blueberry syrup had become kinda rubbery. The cheesecake was a little on the sour side too.
We finished our order painstakingly and pushed off.
Considering that the location is quite nice, we hope this prompts the management of Velvetiine to strive for better, make amends and innovate.

In a quint lane in rashbehari, this bakery is doing some great things, with their well made sweets and savouries, I really have become a fan.
They have really great brownies and bread, classic but delicious.
Also they do greatly in party orders and decorations, they've done some for me and I loved it.

Go try it out. Or order in, they are on some of the delivery apps too!

I feel this place is a little overhyped. I mean if you are staying in that area,pretty desserts at such reasonable prices are obviously a must-have. Its good,but not never-had-before good..taste-wise.
The red-velvet pastry was nice. The chocolate mousse was better.

Heard about the place from a friend some time back. Recently I tried the Red Velvet Cheescake and the Mississippi Mudpie. I loved them both. The cheesecake was really soft and the filling was perfect. Price is a bit on the higher side but no compromise on the taste of the cakes.
Will love to visit again.

Had ordered 3 pastries and an apple crumble. 

I haven't had a better Apple Crumble anywhere else. Everything about it was just perfect. From the warm honey glazed crumbly pie to the succulent caramelised pieces of thinly sliced apples, just perfect. 

As for the pastries, they were good if not as amazing as the pie. 

Highly recommended. #ZenFood

I ordered an oreo cheesecake and a rainbow cheesecake. It was just yummylicious. I love the colours and the proper juicy texture with cheese cream of the rainbow cheesecake which was the win win between the both. I would love to drop in to try the other cakes. :D

1st of all heard a lot about this shop from zomato so was very much anxious to try some of their items . rainbow cake always attracted me hence i went for it. 1stly i was shocked to see the size of the piece of cake . it was too small at rs. 70 i expected a little better . anyways taste was decent and throughly enjoyed eating it. also tried their 5 layer chocolate cake which was again small and cost was rs. 85 . i feel the cost is too high compared to the quantity . overall i was satisfied. after even using 175 bucks i was still feeling hungry . hence will not prefer to go there again unless i earn too much money . my rating is high because of there quality . it was really good

A little neat and clean, cutely decorated place... with colourful well decorated cakes... service was ok... staffs very much clueless, had no idea regarding there products... I tried there 1. Oreo cheesecake... didn't liked at all, 2. Rainbow Cake... very good, 3. Truffle cake... very ordinary... after then placed an order for 1.5 pound truffle fondant for one of my friends anniversary, which was also very ordinary in taste but the deco was excellent... also the pocket pinch was heavy in the pocket...

Location: The alley opposite rasbehari gurdwara, it should fall on your right.
Review: It's a quaint little place tucked in the quiet lane opposite the gurdwara. I had been meaning to go there forever after going through the lovely reviews it got from zomato. Staying so close to the place I finally made up my mind to go there and sample the cake pops. However, it was unavailable. I tried the red velvette cheesecake, the blueberry cheesecake and the rainbow cake. The red velvette was soft and light. The blueberry cheesecake had the right balance of acidity. The rainbow cake was nice too. The prices are a tad bit on the steeper side. The owners are very humble and friendly. They make it a point to interact with the customers and get a feedback there itself. Looking forward to get back and try some more of the delectable fare.

Located just opposite of rashbehari gurudwar. This is a small place, they serve exotic cakes and savoiury item as well as assorted choclates. The quality of their cake is of very high standard but their price is a bit high minimum price of a cake starts from Rs40. I especially love the box they give in. One more thingh they only serve veg.

I must thank my dear Zomato friend Abhishek Kundu for introducing this place to me. My place of work being within its vicinity, I have passed by it countless times and have given a mere glance at its signboard thinking that it's a garment shop. It was when I read Abhishek's review that the real fact dawned upon me and here was I, at last, and I did not regret it.
It is a small cake shop ran by a mother and daughter duo. Daughter is the brain behind it, and her mother stood by her like a solid rock, helping her, and also enjoying in the process. I have not met any other person more passionate in their work as these two beautiful ladies.
It is a beautifully and tastefully decorated shop. The signboard does not speak out the treasure it was advertising. I adviced them to make a bigger signboard and make it a bit explicit, so that people would not be fooled by the word "velvet" and pass by it taking it to be a clothes shop.
Though I am a chocolate lover, I chose to have rainbow cake because of its looks. It is soft and tasty and I loved it. Later on at the request of the mother, I took corn focaccia bread. She warmed it for me. One bite and I was in heaven. It was soft and crunchy and I could feel the cheese melting in my mouth.
Then I tried some chocolates( how could I resist one, chocolate lover that I am?) I was attracted to one kewie filled dark chocolate. It was out of this world.
The price is also moderate.
I am determined to come here again and try the other products. These are all pure veg products so anybody can have them.
I wish the daughter Shraddha and her mother( I forgot to catch her name, sorry) all the best.

It is a little shop offering a lot of confectionary items ranging from cheesecake and muffins to breads and light savories.

★ LOCATION : It is located in the 'gali' right opposite Rashbehari Gurudwara, about 300m from Rashbehari Crossing/Kalighat Metro.

★ AMBIANCE : It is a tiny shop without any seating arrangement as such. The inside was very neat and decorated with streamers and ribbons during my visit.

★ FOOD : I bought OREO CHEESECAKE, RED VELVET CHEESECAKE, CHOCONUT MOUSSE, RAINBOW PASTRY and CHOCOLATE MUDPIE TART.

The Oreo Cheesecake was very ordinary to taste in comparison to the Red Velvet which was far better. The Rainbow Pastry was also delightful. However, the remaining two were my favourites. Am I saying this out of my eternal love for chocolate? Have to admit, nothing beats chocolate!
The Mudpie was lipsmacking and the best part of the day. I would love to visit it just to have a couple of those! Even the Choconut Mousse was pretty good for its price of ₹50.

★ PRICES : The prices fall towards the higher side. The average price comes within the ₹50-80 range.

★ SERVICE : The lady at the counter didn't seem very informed, although she helped a lot with another person who came in soon.

Overall the experience was a moderate one. Will visit to try more of the items, especially the Cake In Jar. :)

This is one small patisserie located in the alley opposite to the gurdwara near Rashbehari more. It is a small quaint place with a decoration matching a red and white theme. But the interiors didn't end up with a touch of perfection at every corner. I went there with my friend and both of us are dessert buffs. So, we had gorged upon four of their desserts, two each. We tried their Red Velvet Cheese Cake, Strawberry Cheese Cake, a chocolate cupcake and their much celebrated Mississippi Mudpie. The cheesecakes weren't really good. They claimed to use Philadelphia cream cheese but the cakes tasted more like Rich cream cake. As a Rich cream cake, they were good, really good but as a cheesecake Velvetiine didn't meet my expectations. The cupcake was good. I liked the warm chocolate sauce inside as they gave us one fresh from the oven. The Mississippi Mudpie also tasted good. All of their bakes are yummy, but they all miss a finesse, which I think is a backdrop. They can rename their products and sell them because they all are nice by standard, but not meet the traditional definition of well known dessert. The owner was really courteous and helped us with choosing from their widespread menu. You can surely pay a visit their and satisfy your sweet tooth. Happy Dining! :)

Previous week I have visited this bakery joint twice, I have ordered two one lbs cake, one chocolate gateaux and another black forest. Simple in design the chocolate gateaux is too chocolaty and really lip smacking in taste.

The biggest strong point of this outlet that they don't use any egg in their preparation therefore the veggies could try this outlet bakery product without compromising with the taste.

Seeing this place so close to my home. .serving variety of cheesecakes made me decide immediately that I'll pay a visit to Velvetiine.The price here is a bit on the higher side since their products are purely eggless.The owner was a sweet lady who was present there and she is very helpful.She suggested me to have the Red Velvet Cheesecake.It was out of the world! It was so light yet rich in texture. .The cream cheese filling and creamy topping..just WOW! Unfortunately I couldn't treat myself with more than 1 dessert(even though I wanted to!) because it made me full.Looking forward to trying out more sweet treats from Velvetiine.

Quite disappointed with the food. The Mudpie was too hard, with none of the expected softness of the chocolate in it. The oreo cheesecake was sour for some reason (and not in a nice cheesecake sour way) and the salted caramel, which I had heard about, wasn't even on display. The prices and the quality are extremely difficult to reconcile.

Velvetline when you look from outside it gives you a picture that it is a cafe but when you enter inside it comes out to be a small take way which caters to all eggless cakes and pastries. I tried there deserts and it tasted ok but the pricing is surely oh higher side. 
The pricing and taste both needs to be improved. The outside interior is good. The person at the counter is friendly and ready to help you and suggest you.

One of the few places in Calcutta where you get really good authentic dessert. 
The cakes have the perfect amount of sweetness and are really soft. I've had the cheesecakes, brownies, and quiches, all are top-notch, and the cakes are just amazing!! Love it.
I regularly order cakes from here and would definitely recommend it.
