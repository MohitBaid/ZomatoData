everything is good except the roti. I ordered rumali roti but the roti they provided was really thick hence hard to digest. And from my next order please make the food less spicy. Overall the experience was good. I will use again.

The delivery was super fast... never saw that kind of delivery as I ordered a vegetable fried rice and tandoori chicken... vegetables rice quality and quantity wise was very yummy, the oil used was also good. Tandoori chicken quantity wise was a dream, but quality wise  was not good,usually tandoori chicken is safe if you donâ€™t know the restaurant but I can vouch that you need not buy them here as itâ€™s was tasteless but edible.

This is a newly opened place near airport. Ordered today chicken tikka roll,Crispy chilli chicken and kulcha.Did not really expect the taste would be this awesome.Had the Best kulcha after a long time, Crispy chilli chicken was super tasty, crunchy and perfect blend of garlic. Roll was stuffed with chicken ,it's perfect for a meal.
Note : Got it delivered before the expected time ðŸ˜Š
