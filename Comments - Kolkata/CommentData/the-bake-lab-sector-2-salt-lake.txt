Ordered a custom made chocolate cake from The Bake Lab and it was delicious! Since it was a theme based cake, I feel the design could have been better with some finishing touches but anyhow it made for a great surprise birthday day cake for my husband.

At last a long due review on The Bake Lab. I order cake for every special occasion from this place and each time they deliver mouth watering cake. Generally we restrain ourself from eating fondue cake because of the sugar but we cannot resist eating the bake lab cake. The cakes are always perfect in every respect beat presentation, finishing, taste, texture. Sudha Aunty ( the lady behind creating delicious cake) is a wonderful person. She makes cake as per our request and always on time delivery. This is indeed the best place to order cake to make every occasion special.

I ordered this box of happiness for my mother's birthday and it proved to be an absolute delight among my family back in Kolkata! The customised cake was a treat for eyes as well as taste buds. Since I couldn't be present in person, Sudha ji took the effort of adding a birthday card along with the cake as per my request.
Highly recommended!

I couldnt have been more pleased with my decision to trust The Bake Lab for preparing a beautiful cake for my grandmother's 75th Birthday! 

The cake was delicious, and got even better as all the guests digged into it- layer by layer. 
Chocolate Truffle with a trail of beautiful flowers perfectly decorated and so tasteful! 

I still have the taste fresh in my mind. Thankyou so much for a wonderful memory of celebrations and happy times!
