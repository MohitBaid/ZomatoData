I visited this place during durga puja.  They had minimal number of dishes to serve and the service was mediocre.  They need a lot of improvement.

Great place for hangout with friend, food is good enough, but takes almost 1hr to bring one hukka. And food is quite costly too. But the main problem is the space. No seat for couple, always have to share seat with other couple or groups. Also have no option for parking for this place. Though it’s the only hukka parlour in barrackpore and it’s good overall.

Been here during durga puja and was very much disappointed with there service.
Me and my frnds thought of having hookahs and some appetizers but unfortunately being a hookah parlour they were not serving hookahs.
The interior decor was good.

Delivery boy asked for extra money. If you didn't pay it then some horrible moment waiting for you. Suggest don't go this type of resturant. Food quality is also very poor

Excellent atmosphere with bluish shade. Foods are in good quality. Ice cream shake with coffee is excellent.  Chili fish is awesome. Also one should try Kashmiri Polao.

The official hookah bar of barrackpore which doesn't serve hookah.  This cafe restaurant has a good location as it is near to chiriyamore(which is the most crowded place). This restaurant serves quality mocktails.  I have tried a wide range of mocktails from this place.  Its a must try when you are here.  The starters - dry chilly Chicken was good too.  There is a blue wash of light all over this place which will give you a dizzy feel along with the loud trendy music Being played in the background.. Its the best place to go out with a group of friends.  Couples should avoid this because it doesn't give them a silent quiet time for conversation.  This place should consistently serve hookah as it is Famous for it.

Visited the place at nabami night and the experience was horrible. They were not serving hukkah, especially which they are known for and didn't even care to put any notice outside the place.They hardly had any beverage in collection other than cold coffee.
Besides all these, a special mention goes to the staff behavior which was remarkably offending. They handed us the bill long before we were done with our drinks. Even their attitude towards their customer was too informal and unprofessional.
As per my experience it is basically a family restaurant with fancy lights and lounge-like set up. I would suggest everyone to try some other places if you are looking for a hukkah parlour or cafe.

Ordered food from Zomato and everything went smoothly. Their food is really tasty, specially their crispy chicken. The delivery person was very friendly and professional and I am overall extremely satisfied with the quality of their food and service. I would definitely order again.

The ambience n interiors are good. But if u really want to make it a happening place... please start working on it.
Wat use r those curtains wen u cannot give privacy..?? Obviously no one wants to celebrate their bdays or anniversaries n bachelorette parties wid 50 unknown ppl staring n commenting at u??? So please pull down d curtains wen d customers ask u to wen a celebration is in place...just like it is done in other good cafes.
Please start kiping some essential drinks always like virgin mojhito n limesoda... Not everyone wl drink wat u suggest always.
Please kip tissues on d tables. That's d most basic requirement.
N please... Play some good music. We need to ask for dat too? N kindly improve d lights too..add some yellow lights too. Pura blue h..na khana n drinks  samajh aa raha na log..
Please look into these matters asap.

Hookah seems to latest craze in town for some time, but we didn't expect any hookah bar in suburban like in Barrackpore. It's probably first hookah parlor in northern suburb of Kolkata, and it's good, rather to say better than many located in the main city. But it needs a little improvement.

They have a great bluish ambience to enjoy the hookah. Though all flavors are not good, and sometimes I miss Chai Break's awesomeness, Ringzone excels also in the foodsection. The waiters are good and cordial and serve fast. 

WIR (Will I return) : Yes, definitely.

Best place for passing out your free time with friends... Variety of hookahs flavours are available in different base varients.. Food quality is just awesome, from my personal opinion you should try their "Biryani" and " Triple Rice "...
They have a specialised mocktail counter with a huge variety..
Being one of the regulars it's a personal peace of opinion that you should visit atleast once too see this place..

Very Good Atmosphere to hangout with friends and most of all there are so many variants of flavours for HOOKAH at a very low cost... Loved very much. Tried the Mint one and it was awesome. Come one, come all

Newly opened hookah lounge cum restaurant in the very heart of Barrackpore....cordial staffs, extremely good food at a very reasonable price and most importantly what a wonderful ambience... finally the main attraction,, one of a kind in our town... the multifarious flavoured hookah...Wow!!! What else needed..Went with a few of my friends and ordered mocktails, some Chinese starters and main course...every single items were mouthwatering and tasty...A visit here is a must...The restaurant is gaining immense popularity...let's make it more popular....A full thumbs up.....
