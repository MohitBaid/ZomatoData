Picked up my breakfast yesterday from this place though I have had food from here many a times. Its a small joint located right opposite to the Quest Mall in the lane. I had taken Masala Dosas, Idlis and Vadas. The Masala Dosa was very good in taste and the quantity of filling was really good and flavourful. The Medu Vada were crisp and fresh and the idlis were also soft and fresh. The coconut chutney was really thick and nice not the flowing pani wali chutney types..but the sambhar I felt was stale. However as I mentioned I have had food here earlier as well. So I would recommend people to try their Non veg Thali, Masala Dosa, Appam and stew and filter coffee. Prices are very pocket friendly and the owner and staff are very friendly. The service is quick. Recommended!

A reasonably priced south indian budget cafe that serves more than idli, dosa and vada. You get lot many things like appam, puttu and Kerala style roast, Malayalam biryani (once a week) and many more things.

The coffee at â‚¹ 20/- is fair enough and so is the masala dosa at â‚¹ 50/-. Ultimate hit is the veg thali at â‚¹ 80/- which offers multiple helpings of sambhar, dal and sabzi... Want more in the thali, add chicken and fish item as you wish. 

The location is excellent, just opposite upmarket luxury mall. The menu is interesting and quality of food is good. The place is frequented mostly by regulars. I often go there for lunch. The food is fresh, healthy and light.

Recommended -
Veg thali
Paratha with chicken roast
Biryani
Appam and fish / chicken stew
Coffee

Extremely good biryani. A huge help for mallus in Calcutta. Must visit for chicken dishes and putte. After grabbing a couple beers at quest mall, come down for the food from here.

I remember my friend taking me to this restaurant, approximately five years back. Obviously back then, I wasn't a user on zomato. Then I've been visiting this restaurant quite often back then. And then after so many years, I finally stumbled across this restaurant on zomato and my heart shouted "i have to go there and relive the memories again". And so, I did.

This restaurant is situated in a lane near quest mall. It's a very small restaurant, no AC, only ceiling fans. I have noticed they have changed the name to South Indian restaurant but the food they served is sill tasty. It was around 11am and we badly wanted to eat breakfast. So we ordered for:
â€¢ Cheese masala dosa
â€¢ Dahi vada
â€¢ cheese mixed uttapa
â€¢ coffee
â€¢ black coffee
â€¢ mineral water 

Having one dosa is enough for one person, its very filling. The waiter was really nice and soft spoken, the service took about 10-15mins before serving us food, which is the standard time for any restaurants. All the food tasted good and particularly, dahi vada. I had to take a parcel home for that. 

Definitely coming back here again, it's worth the food with that price.

If you are looking for a South Indian joint serving dishes beyond the realms of the usual Dhosas and Idlis, then this is the place to be. Most people aren't aware of this name, and so was I at one point of time. Have heard countless praises of their Chicken Roast and other preparations. Unfortunately, all I had tried is a Dosa from this place. Looking forward to drop in soon to try the popular items here.

Went there for late evening lunch on saturday with 2 of my colligues. Only dosas were available at that time. Ordered 3 Onion Masala Dosas which were served quick n hot. Honestly speaking I liked the tastes, but my colligues disagreed. Its a small joint but clean. The service was good too. So as a 1st time visit I found the place n food decent enough to go back again. ðŸ˜Š

A hidden gem and a place to savour good non veg South Indian food at a pocket friendly rate. Only problem here is that they do not serve all the items everyday or throughout the day. So it is best to call before going if you are looking for something specific. 

The normal veg dosa and idlies here are decent. Do try their sada dossa with Chicken Curry and also their Kerala style Biryani (served only on Sundays).

Kera South Indian is one of those handful eateries in Kolkata that serve South Indian dishes beyond Dosa,Idli and Vada. It is not a very new restaurant. But people are mostly unaware of it. It is little lighter on the pocket compared to other non veg south Indian restaurants.

Fish curry rice is a must try item. It is prepared with a fish called Aila which is commonly consumed in Kerala. The spicy gravy is served with fine rice. The fish is itself oily like our very own Hilsha.
I have also tried their veg thali. The buttermilk that comes with the thali is refreshing. The coffee reminds me of my Bangalore days. It is served in a small steel glass along with a steel bowl which is a typical South Indian style.

The staffs are very courteous. The interior is not very comfortable to enjoy the food so it is better to get them packed. The quality of the food is the main reason to visit this unadorned eatery multiple times.

Kera is an authentic Malayali food place, as authentic as it can be for a budget place catering to a non-malayali crowd base in the midst of Biriyani hub of Park Circus.  The sambar, avial or the parippu isnt as nice as Ammini's (which is three times more expensive), but is, like I said, in spirit very true to Kerela's food. Of the many places in the city that insult and abuse a Meen (Fish) Curry (like Fisherman's Deck) in all possible manner by adding coconut milk to any fish gravy, this one acts as my saviour. 

Small, clean, basic and without air conditioning, if you happen to visit do have the Fish Curry and the chicken roast, either with a veg meal or malabar paranthas. Like you won't have dal at Arsalan, don't have masala dosa and uttapam here - for which the Brahmin eateries like Banana Leaf and Pai's serve up better options. Stick to non-veg and the specialities from Kerela, and you will be happy.

Weekday breakfasts include a wide array of Kerela cuisine specialities like Idiappam, puttu and appam - together with Kadala Curry or a stew, makes for a very hearty meal.

Kera South Indian is one of those rare restaurants in Kolkata (Calcutta), which serves both South Indian food and non-veg items. The menu here is big, but not all items are available throughout the day, or everyday. So it is best to give them a call before visiting, if you are planning to try something special. The place is small and simple. No fancy decorations, only few tables and chairs. Service is fast and friendly. If you want to try good Malayali food, then you can not give this place a miss.

"I've always maintained that food must take you somewhere. It must rekindle a memory from the past or form the basis for new ones " 
Kera takes you back to those wonderful little tea stall outgrown into restaurant feels , and the food here is a solace for every malayali in Calcutta. Nestled in a by lane, tucked away from the ruckus of park circus area, the tea that they serve here is worth your time and money. Try their dosa / porotta with chicken roast and then top it off with a couple of rounds of tea.

If you are in park circus area and looking for south indian food in pocket friendly range South Indian is the appropriate choice.The restaurant is small but very busy, their service is also very fast.They serves quality and tasty dhosas,dahi vada,idli and many dishes.You can't say 'elle' to their items,go for it.

been going there since i was a child. dropped by today after many years for lunch. nothing like a fresh homely south-indian meal in this weather. even the buttermilk they serve with the thali is delicious. not to mention authentic flavours and ingredients in the chutney and other condiments.Â 

this place is not even air conditioned but it is spotlessly clean and the service is impeccable.

South Indian; For a Non-vegetarian person like this restaurant would have done no justice but it actually did. 
The best part of this place is it's simplicity and light food. I just love the Dahi Vadas they serve, it's simply mouthwatering. Idli s with nadiyal chutney and sambhar... They are soft and fresh. This place have vegetarian and non vegetarian thaalis too, and they worth your every single penny. 

Do visit and taste the south in Kolkata. 
Thank You

Let's start from the service of this restaurant or you may call it an eat on the go place as this place isn't a place for you if you are a big complain box in terms of A/C or proper tables etc etc , as this is a totally different kind of a south Indian restaurant where non veg is available too with no fancy tables or interiors for the eyes to feel good , its food that is what this place is all about with less oil food be it with the dosas or anything else which is prepared very homely , clean and healthy for you .

My verdict - A yes

Good simple homely south indian food at reasonable rates. Disappointed though thAt the variety in menu is limited to what we get in every other south indian joint in the city ie dosa idli vada uttapam. Would have loved to see more variety since the owner is a keralite. Also. The sambar is disappointingly bad and completely unpalatable.

If you are looking for no frills attached South Indian food ..... This place does it spot on . And guess what !!??!!! Its not Vegetarian ! And when I realized that,  it gave me instant happiness. I have have Idli  and dosa here many times but what i have loved here is the Chicken roast and the fried fish . They make brilliant set meals and all of them come at really cheap prices . 

a vegetarian meal for two people costed us 150 bucks , only ! One must also try the fish dishes and the biriyanis . Simply Brilliant ! 

No frills attached . Modest seating...... great food ..... courteous staff

This is fairly good for a quick fix of South Indian food. I have eaten the masala dosa here several times and also tucked into steaming idlis and vada. Their coffee is also good, this place is quite economical for a low budget lunch or snack between work.
I have often eaten their parathas which are Kerala parathas and quite tasty and goes with everything.The masala uttapam is a another well made dish here and this place scores in term of hygiene and pricing.The service can be a bit slow and dragged out at times but regular customers are promptly served.The convenience and pricing make it an avergae joint but the taste is definitely not comparable to Banana Leaf which would be anyday way better.

One of the very few places that serve non-vegetarian South Indian dishes.

This small joint, not too far from Afza  or Krazy Kebab, served economically priced regular South Indian food. Do not expect the level of food at Banana Leaf etc and you wouldn't be disappointed. There is sufficient seating space, but it is not air-conditioned. They also do some regular north Indian food. I have tried the dosa and vada and they were pretty decent (vada was reheated). The non-vegetarian items are worth a try sitting there.
