So it was our first visit to the rooftop lounge/ cafe situated near Camac street. I must say when u enter the open area it looks very pretty and the ambience is pretty welcoming. The winter's afternoon looked amazing there. The cheese spring roll and the mushroom gilauti kawab was mouth licking but we were disappointed with the spaghetti cum pasta I don't know what exactly that wasüòÜ overall we dint regret spending our afternoon there, a nicely and lively place for a good time with friends.

For starters we ordered spicy panner bhurji buns and they were yummmm to say the least. Double thumbs up to the cocktail I ordered - Manga :)
For main course I had Thai green curry that was good as well.
Would love to go back again!!

This place scores soooooo high on the ambience!! Though a tad bit on the expensive side, it was a sublime experience sitting here on a winter afternoon and puffing on great hookah! Staff behaviour is very nice. Cocktails are interesting. Specially loved the 'Copper Monkey'. Food is superb too but would love a little more variety. There is nothing much to fault about this place. Will be visiting many more times!!

Located on the 9th floor of the fort Knox building in the camac street. It is very easy to located.

It is a well decorated rooftop lounge. The view of a part of Kolkata from there is nice.

Ordered tiger beef as it is one of their specialities and a draught. The beef steak were very soft, juicy and fat free tossed in red chilli sauce. It's taste was awesome. The quantity is good for 2 people.

Pocket pinch is on the higher side.

Monkey Bar is a rooftop lounge located right opposite to the British Council Library in Camac Street. Its a very easy place to locate.¬†

I must say as you enter the place it looks very pretty and the ambience is very good which gives you a pretty welcoming image of the place. The decor really stands out with a huge space to wine and dine. This place is great for party people especially during the weekends. the place is beautifully lit with fairy lights and the music is also not too loud. The best part about Monkey Bar is that the sheesha and the lip smacking food. The food tastes really good and the behaviour of the staff is very good.

An urbane ambience with lip-smacking food and excellent drinks, what more one can ask for! Manga, the Monkey Bar special cocktail is worth trying. Tangy in taste, we loved it. Butterfly chicken was delicious. Mutton keema ghotala could have been a little less salty. Mint flavoured chocolava cake was a treat. Presentation was aesthetically pleasing. Service was good. Icing on the cake is Victoria Memorial, St. Paul's Cathedral and Vidyasagar Setu, adorning the Kolkata skyline are visible from this place.

Located on 9th floor of Fort knox,great ambience  as both indoor as well as roof top seating is available along with good music. The view of Victoria and St. Paul's cathedral at a distance is also a sight to watch. 
Now,  coming to food,  we had ordered chicken chapli,  butterfly chicken( had heard a lot about it) and aunty's Berry chicken pulao. The food was overall good.

Monkey Bar is located right opposite to the British Council Library in Camac Street. Located on the 9th floor, the loud thumping music will introduce you to this swashbuckling place. 

Monkey Bar is pretty! Let's start with that. Covering a huge space to wine and dine, and a lively bar upping the ante all the time, Monkey Bar is a great place for party-mongers especially during the weekends. The place may be huge, but hardly 60 people can avail seating space, therefore the place isn't clogged. We went to this place in the month of December, and the place was lit with fairy lights and considering the rooftop seating the place looked heavenly excluding the ear-splitting music. Can't complain about the music though as it paired well with the overall ambience. The best part about Monkey Bar would be the rooftop Shisha Area. The wintry December breeze grazing your tipsy head while taking a deep puff of your mint flavoured Hookah will make you fall in love with this place. Even the cacophony of a bustling crowd didn't feel bad at that time. 

Coming to the section we die for; we opted for Smoked Chicken, Salami and Harissa Pizza and paired it with Chicken Nachos. The Pizza followed the ever-growing trend of thin crust Pizzas in Kolkata, but the large chunks of chicken and cheese rendered it edible. The chicken nachos was amazing and was dripped in a spicy sauce while topped with added cheese. Went ahead with the Kingfisher Premium and Vodka Martini at first. In the meantime ordered a 1.5l pitcher of Kingfisher Draught and an Antares Carmanere. The latter tasted amazing, but shelling out 650 for that seemed absurd. 

Didn't like their service when they served Hookah as they took their own sweet time to get it ready. Furthermore, they gave us the wrong flavours and the Paan Rasna had little Paan and more Rasna in it. Overall, an amazing place to party and get rid of your weekday demons. The pocket-drilling overall cost should not come as a surprise, but the amazing ambience and tasty dishes alongwith a wide range of drinks menu makes it a humdinger.

One of the best rooftop places in the city.  If the decor and the view and the outdoor seating doesn't impress you outta your wits,  the reasonable bar and the sumptuous servings of food definitely will.  

A must try here is the Mobar Pork, comes with noodles and will leave you begging for more succulent Pork. 
The pork ribs, best of its kind found in Kolkata,imo. 
Will leave you licking your fingertips long after the dish is gone.  
The Kingfisher Ultra for 220 was okay,  in a place like that it can be considered reasonable. 
The chicken nachos with cheese and dip was a real stunner.  Perfectly cooked and flavoured chicken blended with crunchy nachos really worked well.  
The desserts are some of the best in Kolkata. Both the Snicker Bar and the Mobar Sundae are perfect to the last T.  

It's a wonderful experience, the view is amazing,  do drop by with your group for drinks and great food. There's enough place for everyone.

5 stars for a 5 star bar!!

Don't know where or how to start, but I will try my best to describe the place. Let me not go into the food first, and start with the view. The view from this place is just majestic. Victoria, 2nd Hooghly Bridge, St.Paul's Cathedral, The 42, all are there in front of your eyes. The decors are mesmerizing. The place is cozy yet quite spacious.

Coming to the food, I have seldom had experiences where the dishes were so authentic and unique. The garnishing is incomparable, with the dishes being eye catching as well as lip smacking. Highly recommended.

Random and unexpected plans sometimes turn out to be the most memorable. This place has been there in frequent discussions among my friend circle for quite sometime. On 31st it was one among my few stopovers and I regret my decission for not spending the entire afternoon at that place.
The place is all set to cheer your mood up at once. Top-notch ambience, picture perfect decor, large window screens, roof garden with a hookah bar and 31st they were even preparing a stage which seemed somewhat like a karaoke event. The place seems to be quite happening and big hit among young stars.
It was my friends idea to spend the 31st noon after lunch over a few drinks and some good music.
Oh my god! their cocktails...am already a big fan! and according to me among all the places I have visited till date this one is the best at it.
Definitely have to come back for the appetizer and desert dishes seemed quite appealing! :p...
Um...budget is an issue here but you wont regret when you come out of that place with full satisfaction.

This is such a great place with the perfect look and setting. We ordered:
1. Chicken chimichurri
2. Kerala beef
3. Auntie Vinnie's Berry pulao
4. Butter chicken khichdi

All the items were great. Loved the Kerala beef, it was exactly how it is made. Butter chicken khichdi was amazing. Although I feel the quantity could've been better given the amount they charge. Nevertheless, a must visit place.

Worst service ever! The staff doesn't know how to speak to their guests. We wanted a seat in their open area and were asked to wait as there was no space. We were told there were 2 groups of people waiting before us. After 40 mins, when we asked again, we were told 5 groups were in queue ahead of us and the way the staff were responding to my questions, sucked. No one admitted to saying only 2 groups were ahead of us. To top it up, one superstar staff literally walked away while i was still speaking to him.

Honestly, Monkey bar might still be basking in the glory for getting a national chain to kolkata but they've not got their basics in place yet. If you don't want your self-respect to be murdered, literally, please don't go there! 
You're wise to make your own choice now!

This place was on our bucket list since long and I had to visit it when one of my best friend was in town during the Winter break and another close friend.We visited this place on an afternoon and was awed by it's beautiful view and ambience. The place scores a 5/5 on it's ambience and decor I feel.The food is extremely tasty and the cocktails are also perfectly blended according to their own specifications .I just thought that the service could have been better and the 10% Service charge which they levy it shouldn't be as it's illegal .Though they didn't force us to pay it but they shouldn't levy .Otherwise Monkey Bar is an ideal place to be with your girlfriends or for a perfect date.

Had heard a lot about this place from my cousins, hence decided to go. Since I had to hop to another place for proper meal, I settled for Kimchi veg baby potatoes and Ginger ale. Kimchi baby potatoes was rather too sweet and Ginger Ale lacked the exact proportion of strong ginger flavour and. Well, I have to come again yo try out other items but what was truly amazing was the decor! Classy with vintage video clippings of Hollywood movie being played on the projector, a porch cum seating arrangement overlooking Camac Street, a huge mural with portico, outdoor seating as well and the lights on the Christmas- from beam lights to ceiling lights and the reindeer's with it's sledge- basically I've rated it on the basis of the vibe and the decor. The music that is played here is also vintageüòç. It was soothing to listen to 'Look into my eye's after long.

Very nice ambience and an amazing view of kolkata. Tried their pizza and loaded nachos ..both were upto mark . They have 2 sections ,the indoor and the open area where they serve hookah . The open area is nicely adorned and the tables are under a canopy of lights and they were screening old hollywood movies on the giant screen which gave the vibe of an european cafe . The music is mostly new age pop and EDM and it's not hard on the ears. 
The negative point is that they sometimes don't allow stags and they reserve the right of entry based on your appearance (which frankly sounds very shallow to me ) . Otherwise a good place to chill and spend your evening .

The place is easy to locate, Monkey Bar is on the Ninth Floor, and has a spectacular view. The ambience is amazing.
We started with
Butterfly chicken- After having heard a lot about this dish, we tried it. It was really good, though we expected a lil more from it.
Pepperoni Pizza- A thin crust pizza beautiful cooked with Pork Pepperoni.
Pork Ribs-It was amazing. The pork was succulent and cooked beautifully.
For us, the pork ribs was the star dish.
For drinks, we had:
Hipster Smash-It has a soothing taste and was quite refreshing
Mangaa-It was okayyish.

Overall it was a peefect evening, and I would be looking forward to visit this place again.

It was Christmas Eve!¬†

To start off with the review I'd like to address the fact that it is quite a decent place to hangout and enjoy with your buddies especially if you have a reason to celebrate.¬†
Coming to the food,¬†
..we ordered Classic LIIT and Copper Monkey along with Pepperoni Picante Pizza to begin with. Then I had a "Trump's card" which had vodka as its base. Here I should mention how much warm the staff was given the overall scenario on a busy night like 24th itself. Service was pretty fast.¬†

Just when I thought I shouldn't order no more, the idea of tryin' out their new launch, "MAANGA" was tempting enough to cause a dilemma. Well, to replenish my desires I let go of myself and did get my very own share of the cocktail; refreshing, , on-point with summer and lives up to the name.¬†

Did a few shots of Kamikaze and Jager Bombs and was done for the night.¬†
¬†I do recommend this place if you do not have a tight budget.

With extreme trepidation, I turned up at Monkey Bar with a friend on Christmas Eve. Ever since we had found out that their menu was going to feature a few Korean dishes (and more) during the months of December and January, we had made plans for paying MB a visit. However, since we had not booked our seats in advance, I feared that we would have to wait outside for as long as the entire duration of a football match (if not more). That was not to be, however. They said that even though we would have to wait for at least half an hour before they could provide us with a table, we could sample some of their starters along with the drinks of our choice at the bar. 
We had reasons to celebrate. So my friend decided to try out Mangaa while my old school self settled for a Glenfiddich 15 yo. Advised adequately by a boy at the bar counter, we decided to then go for a Mobox (an assortment of 3 dishes which you can pick and choose from the menu). We opted for Butterfly Chicken, Tiger Beef and Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. The first of these three was a bit of a letdown. There's no denying the fact that it sure is tasty, but given the price at which it comes, one cannot help but wonder if this is just a pricier version of any roadside chaat with a little bit of chicken thrown in for small mercies. However, the next two more than made up for this. The Tiger Beef, undoubtedly, was the pick of the lot. The meat was tender and juicy. The spices had been perfectly blended. No wonder our generally cordial selves found each other fighting over a few spoonfuls of the aforementioned. The caramelised pork ribs were rather nice too. The nitpicker in me would, however, request the authorities to tone down the sweetness (try pinching yourself with your thumb and your index finger for accurate measures) a little.¬†
Just when we were on the verge of completing our Mobox, we were offered a place to sit. It was a small table right next to the entrance. How we wished for a seat next to the big glass-panelled wall! But I guess that might have been too much to ask for given the time constraints. Eager to try out what we had come for in the first place, and aware at the same time of the needlessly limited capacity of our respective stomachs, we decided to split a Korean Bibimbap. And I report with a sobbing heart that though the Bibimbap offered generous amounts of meat (along with sticky rice and the veggies, of course), it could not quite beat the high induced by the Tiger Beef.¬†
This place will easily draw in the bar-hopping Gen Ys of today's Kolkata, given the amount of space it has at its disposal, and the generally chilled out ambience. Given a choice, however, (wannabe) oldies like me who prioritise food above all else and prefer peace and quiet (or at least, people speaking in hushed voices) over cacophony, might head to a place that offers a similar spread minus the whole jing-bang. But then, even oldies feel like spreading their wings (or honouring their inner 'monkeys') once in a while!

Monkey Bar has to be one of the coolest bars/lounges in town. Located on the 9th floor of a high rise overlooking the posh Camac Street, this restaurant/bar offers one of the most pristine dining experiences. Look out and you will be amazed to discover your ‚Äúcity of joy‚Äù in a new light. 
The decor is chic and contemporary; I for once, forgot that I was in Kolkata and not an urban restaurant at Mumbai or Bangalore. EDM plays on to keep your feet tapping. The servers were courteous and are usually aware of what to recommend.
The signature Manga with vodka, Aam paana and sweet lime set the mood right for a light evening. However, I felt the cumin was a tad too strong and killed the flavour of the aam paana. The next cocktail was Hipster Mash. I must admit it was my mistake that I opted for this. It was too sweet for my liking, but may suit your palette. We order the Tiger Beef, a delicious mix of sliced beef with black beans and peppers and it was fabulous. A word of caution though, ask them to tone down the spices if you are not into spicy food. The nachos with chicken were the best I have had in town. Crisp corn nachos with tender chicken morsels, beans and cheese and you cnt go wrong. The chicken skewers were good to nibble at and the accompanying dip was great. 
Service was top-notch; we skipped the bowls since we had to head back elsewhere for dinner, but I shall be back soon.

None of the foods excepting tiger beef was good.
I have visited monkey bars in mumbai and chennai.
The behaviour of the staffs are way better than the one in kolkata.
You make a bill of around 20000 and you are still asked to step outside the bar because of time slots.
It was shame for me to take my friends from outside kolkata to such a place.I would recommend people to find better places in kolkata and not monkey bar.

This is one of the best place that I have visited so far.
And the one thing that I can assure you is once you go to this place, you will want to visit again. It's in the 9th floor of the Fort Knox Building in Camac Street.
The first thing that catches your eye is the ambience and the city skyline that is adorned with Victoria Memorial , Cathedral , Vidyasagar Setu and also The 42. The place in itself radiates positive vibes and there is good music played that no way irritates your ear or disturbs your speaking. The best time to visit this place will by in the late afternoon that is befor dusk , so that you can witness all the different shades of this beautiful place.
Now coming to food , I personally did not have a 'wow' experience with food. Maybe our choices could have been better. But also I won't say that the food was bad either. It wasn't bad but it didn't hit the taste bud very well too. Quantity wise , it's good enough. We took Reddy's Popcorn Chicken and Loaded Chicken Nachos.
Nachos was okay and if you don't prefer South Indian then don't go for the popcorn chicken.
Maybe next time , I will try something that will make me go gaga!
Service is good as well. The waiters are polite and quick. Also well behaved. Atleast with us , they were.
Then comes , drinks. A complete value for money.
They have a wide range of cocktails as well.
The price is definitely on a higher side but that compensates for every bit of your experience.
So , my recommendation is , this place is a must visit.

This is one of the best place that I have visited so far.
And the one thing that I can assure you is once you go to this place, you will want to visit again. It's in the 9th floor of the Fort Knox Building in Camac Street.
The first thing that catches your eye is the ambience and the city skyline that is adorned with Victoria Memorial , Cathedral , Vidyasagar Setu and also The 42. The place in itself radiates positive vibes and there is good music played that no way irritates your ear or disturbs your speaking. The best time to visit this place will by in the late afternoon that is befor dusk , so that you can witness all the different shades of this beautiful place.
Now coming to food , I personally did not have a 'wow' experience with food. Maybe our choices could have been better. But also I won't say that the food was bad either. It wasn't bad but it didn't hit the taste bud very well too. Quantity wise , it's good enough. We took Reddy's Popcorn Chicken and Loaded Chicken Nachos.
Nachos was okay and if you don't prefer South Indian then don't go for the popcorn chicken.
Maybe next time , I will try something that will make me go gaga!
Service is good as well. The waiters are polite and quick. Also well behaved. Atleast with us , they were.
Then comes , drinks. A complete value for money.
They have a wide range of cocktails as well.
The price is definitely on a higher side but that compensates for every bit of your experience.
So , my recommendation is , this place is a must visit.

The place is over hyped with perfectly unsocial manager standing at the door named ‚ÄúJOY‚Äù.
None of the foods excepting tiger beef was good.
I have visited monkey bars in mumbai and chennai.
The behaviour of the staffs are way better than the one in kolkata.
You make a bill of around 20000 and you are still asked to step outside the bar because of time slots.
It was shame for me to take my friends from outside kolkata to such a place.I would recommend people to find better places in kolkata and not monkey bar.

Keep this in your must visit places. On the 9th floor, beside Urban desi. Located at Camac street easily accessible. Ambience ,super ! Food taste , super ! Cocktails, Super! Decoration, Awsum. Just a boom time . Just after 9pm the crowd starts to pull in( actual time for party mood). Price is on the table, but good food n drink comes with a price. One will not regret. Must have their on house special Maanga and Lip smacking Sticker Korean Chicken Wings. Just go n have super time.

This place on the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street is a very lively bar with a classy ambiance. The dim light and the typical 90's gastro pub vibes it exudes is nice but the music is a little too loud in my opinion. 
I loved their wide variety of cocktails and specials and whiskey on the menu. 
I went there with a friend. We ordered the Mobar special pack a punch and for appetisers we ordered Reddy's popcorn chicken. Then we had Pepperoni Picante and Tiger Beef and the Mobark Boat for main course  and Vodka Martini. For dessert we had caramelised popcorn served with bowl full of chocolate frosting and candied corn sticks. 
To be honest tiger beef was a delight as was the modern take on steamboat aka the Mobark boat. The pizza ( Pepperoni Picante) could've been more cheesy and could've had a softer base instead of the flaky one. 
I absolutely loved the Pack a Punch but the vodka martini seemed to be a little dull on Absolut. 
And the service needs improvement. That's something that can irk you a little.

I visited Monkey Bar with a couple of friends after having an amazing experience at the Monkey Bars located in Delhi. The ambience is of a fancy high end diner as seatings are available in booths as well has high chairs. They also have a very cozy outdoor seating with the magnificent view of the entire city and Victoria Memorial. I think this place wins extra brownie points for the view it offers. My friends and I tried the red sangria and mangaa pitcher for drinks and the Mee goreng and farmers pizza for snacks. The Mee goreng was spicy and an interesting new dish that I tried although I found the noodles slightly greasy. I really enjoyed the mangaa and I recommend everyone to give it a try. Overall service is great and so is the music and I feel that monkey bar is a pretty good choice for a weekend outing or dining with friends.

I took my boyfriend out for a lunch date and discover this beautiful place as appropriate for a romantic one.  The decor and the view is highly impressive. You can enjoy your drink viewing Victoria memorial and Vidyasagar setu at distant. Food here is good. We ordered Tiger beef and butterfly chicken for starters and soulful chicken katsu bowl and Kerala beef fry for mains. I like their beef preparation and the meat was tender and perfectly cooked.. butterfly chicken is among the highly recommended one..but still I would mark Tiger beef over butterfly chicken. For mains I like chicken bowl more than that of Kerala beef fry. As I have tried Kerala beef fry at Kerala only so my expectations are really high..and I don't blame anyone :p

Completely rubbish place, my expectations was too high but, I am not satisfied at all. The food quality was decreasing day by day,  the ambience is not so good, they refused me to give sauteed  mushroom in spite paying 10% service charge. The server was trying to do something for us , but he was stopped by his senior (wearing white shirt), I try to make them understand that my vegetarian friend is coming from London to Monkey Bar,  & she is very fond of sauteed mushrooms, this is just garlic tossed mushroom nothing else, he was not listening me at all, he (weared white shirt) refused me.

In the appetizers chicken kimichuri and tiger beef were outstanding.. The beef dish seemed more like a salad.. Do not miss out on this cool happening place. They have a Different section for hookah so the smoke is not a bother

Amazing find in Kolkata for a Friday night out. I had huge expectation with this place after being in love with the Bangalore Monkey Bar for year.
We were stranded at the bar for nearly an hour. But the amazing food, drinks and the live band kept us going.
We ordered the signature Butterfly Chicken, the Keema Pav and the Hot Wings. We loved every bite of the food. 
In drinks we had the ' Not so Vanilla' and the Sangria with Edelweiss. They were ok. Though we found the Sangria an little stale with dead and drowned apples.
The ' Teen Pan' hookah was spectacular.
We will definitely go back again but a little early so that we can get a table :)

Whenever we go to Monkey Bar, we make sure we reach as early as possible, just after they open. It feels amazing to be there when there's nobody around.

We don't have their food anymore, all we do is grab a an espresso or cappuccino and stroll around in the airy outdoor section, chatting and planning about interesting stuffs to do. The outdoor section is not big, but has seating for both groups and couples.

These impromptu coffee dates at Monkey Bar are highly romantic! Yes, we know people rarely have coffee at Monkey bar, as this place is known for their cocktails, but we don't really care. Just join us someday, and you'd know what we are talking about.

There is nothing left to write about Monkey Bar, it seems. People have written detailed reviews. The ambience is to die for, tall French windows, high ceilings, soft lighting, many types of seating arrangements to suit your mood, paintings of our very own goopy gyne on the walls, plenty of sunlight, lovely music and of course, the stunning view from the ninth floor. The Victoria Memorial, St. Paul's cathedral, 2nd Hooghly bridge, the 42 can be seen at a distance, trying their best to stand out amidst all the tall buildings mushrooming in the city.

Reaching the place is easy. It's located in the popular Fort Knox building, find the elevator and it would take you to the entrance of the Monkey Bar. The elevator is not smooth. Trembles at times.

The service is a little slow at times, but the staff are extremely polite. There are plenty of options for alcoholics, the food is average. Coffee is not bad.

Our Pocket pinch on most of our visits are same-
1 Cappuccino- INR 95
1 Espresso- INR 85
Taxes- INR 9
Service charge- INR 18
TOTAL- INR 208

One of the most trendiest and coolest bar to hang out in city. Located at 9th Floor of Fort Knox, this was my second visit here. This time we opted for window seat, from where the scenario of city was magnificient. We ordered :-

1. Chili Cheese Dragons :- Six pieces of small spring rolls filled with cheese, coriander, green chili, capsicum accompanied with roasted garlic chili dip. Only one word came out of the mouth after having this dish and it was just awesome.

2. Bombay Vada Pav :- Four pieces of small vada pav with salted red chili and accompanied by green chutney was quite good.

3. Farmers Pizza :- Medium thin crust pizza with onion, olive, sweet corn, jalapeno, tomato and mozerella was absolute lovely. Quite good and another lovely dish we had over here.

4. Fresh Lime Soda :- Quite refreshing

5. The Snicker Bar :- Upon recommendation from staff, we ordered it in dessert section. With coffee praline ice cream and pastry cream, with layer of almond and hazelnut on chocolate cake, it was one of the best desserts I have ever in city. Truly recommend to all.

Interiors are mind blowing, Ambience is excellent, Staff are courteous and we even enjoyed live singing by band present over there.

Monkey Bar - the very famous renowned brand of bar restaurant now in the city of joy. Was there in the wishlist for quite a long time. And at last on a drenched rainy evening a sudden plan, made us to be there.

Location:
___________

It was on the camac Street. Fort Knox building 9th floor. Honestly speaking not sure about the location, so just blindly followed the Google map.

Decoration:
______________

Well the decoration is beautiful I would say. Surrounded by some old Kolkata pictures in a monkey way ( well it's all about monkey faces in the pic ) and the lights and decorations gives you an old British house feel. Loved it.

Now let's moved to the main segment.

Drinks:
____________

‚úì Not so vanilla - mix of vanilla, Absolute, expresso. Okay type. Nothing exciting.

‚úì Old fashioned on camac - whiskey based, punched with roasted almonds. It's quite good.

‚úì Copper Money - presented in copper glass, it's the mix of 100 pipers, orange juice and passionate fruit. Nice one. It's on the milder side.

‚úì Hipster smash - vodka, spiritz, watermelon juice mix. Okay type.

All the drinks are good and okay type. Would say nothing exciting about this. But not bad at all.

Food:
_______

‚úì lal Maas phulka tacos - hand made small roti used as tacos with shredded mutton. Excellent one.

‚úì Tiger Beef - amazing , just amazing. Fiber side was less. Cooked with pure excellence. One of the best beef I have ever had.

‚úì Prawn Pil pil - excellent item prepared with chili, garlic. Served with garlic toast.

Dessert:
___________

The sneaker Bar - wow, that's heavenly. You will taste every bit of milk chocolate with hazelnut taste and coffee based dessert.

The experience is pretty good. Well the drinks to us a bit let down. But the food was just amazing. I

Now drinks cost 1672 INR. And all the food item cost 1386 INR

** Do note that,their bill include a service charge. Ask them to remove if you unwilling to pay this.

To management:
___________________

It's lovely to be there. Enjoyed the environment a lot and the food need a special mention. Service was excellent also.

To all :
________

Give a jump, (higher than a monkey ;) ) and go to the money bar. You will have a great time for sure.


And till my next food hunt, happy fooding.

A friend's night out on a Saturday night led us to Monkey Bar. Though we had to wait for an hour to get in, but it was worth it. We got in at 11pm and the place was buzzing with music, packed tables. We got a table by the window with a great view of Victoria Memorial. Decor was nice with high ceilings, bar stools and a giant screen for the sports buff. Another thing which I liked (being a non smoker) was the totally separate smoking zone for the hookah and stuffs.

The options for alcohol is plenty with a large number of cocktails both traditional and some new age ones. We ordered a pitcher of Bourbon LIIT. Coming to the food, the options are limited but enough to go along with your drinks. We ordered Tiger beef and Pepperoni Pizza. The beef was really well cooked, had a smoky flavour and a must try. As far as the cocktail, it was pretty strong and after 3 pitches we all felt the kick. I would definitely recommend Monkey Bar as one of the best lounge bar in town.

The Monkey Bar is one of the finest dining bars that I have seen.

The location, decor, view; each n everything adds up to the beauty and ambience of this place. And these will justify the prices they charge. You will just enjoy your time there with the quality of food they serve. 
 
1. Pack a Punch ( Rum,Brandy, apple thyme shrub and cinnamon) : The blend was really awesome. 
2. Butter Fly Chicken
3. Koran Hot Wings
4. Chicken Pizza

We were there after our work. And Monkey bar made our day. 
Thanks.

Definitely a very good lounge in the city to start my review with.It has a very artsy yet cozy decor inside uou feel very at homely while having a few drinks with friends as well it has a nice outer deck to feel the winter breeze with a nice sheesha.Having itself in the 9 th floor it has been automatically boosted with that effervescent charm of kolkata skyline and that nice breezy air of that kind of height which really feels good at the outerdeck.The food was pretty descent and the sheesha eas really well prepared whihc i really like,all over a really good place wouldnt mind going back again.

The first thing that will attract you that's ambience. Every little things that we try to hide in our interiors, those have been decorated so beautifully with light and shadow, that is enough to blow you away. Next thing is the food. I must say, those are a bit overpriced. Specially the Goan Chorizo Pao. I would not recommend it to anybody. The tiger beef is just awesome which can tickle your taste buds heavily. Then when it comes to drinks, I would definitely say, go for the cocktails.. For two persons it would approximately cost Rs.3000 with food and drinks.

Overall had a good time; good quality of food & drinks, good ambiance, awesome rooftop view and pretty good hospitality but bit overpriced.

Butter Chicken Khichdi & Mix Flavour Nagarjuna was simply awesome. Butterfly Chicken & Mobar Caramelised Ribs was too good. Reddys Popcorn Chicken was bit different, liked it.

Two very important points I would like to share about my visit which very crucial from a customer point of view. The 2nd point is the reason for bit low rating or I would have rated at least 4 star.

1. They charged 10% service charge over the bill but I questioned the same that it's an optional thing, so they removed it without much hiccups and I appreciate the same for their cooperation.

2. Faced an awkward situation when a staff member stopped me clicking pics of the interiors, he asked me whether I have taken permission for the same. The staff said that the theme is unique and others may copy the same. I visited many themed restaurants earlier but nothing like this ever happened. I was shocked with the same but ignored it to discuss the incident with the manger as I was in a pretty good celebration mood and didn't wanted to spoil the same. So I ignored the incident that time and sharing now. Before visiting I have scanned the reviews in Zomato and found many interior pics of the bar. So the staff's statement totally contradicts when one visit Zomata and the facebook page itself.

This is a lovely place to visit with your buddies.Awesome ambience. It has both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.The open terrace is the place where you can enjoy hookah. The stunning view from this oh so hot ;) bar will add an extra spice to your mood.You can sip your cocktail and can enjoy the view of Victoria Memorial and the City of Joy. You can take the seats beside the window and can enjoy a romantic evening with your loved one sitting on the 9th floor and enjoying the view from there. The food and drinks are good with respect to the price(not excellent). 
We had ordered three cocktails and few snacks. 
a) Mangaa:- Its kind of a desi cocktail. It's a combination of vodka,aam panna, mixture of indian spices and lime.Personally, I didn't like the taste.
b) Bloody Red and White Lady:- Its Red Wine Sangria and White Wine Sangria.  Both the drinks consists of small pieces of apple.  The taste of the wine is great.  I liked the white wine more.
c) Butterfly Chicken:- The presentation of the food will hit directly to your heart. It is completely an eye candy. They serve three beautiful butterflies in one plate.The taste buds will be satisfied. A bit crispy on the outer and yummilicious inside. Altogether it's yum.
d) Chicken Chimichurri:- The tender chicken pieces were succulent.Those were prepared in parsley and coriander.There were 6 pieces in one plate.The taste was too good!! 
e) Pot Stickers:-Dumplings containing chicken, celery and jalape√±o were served with tomato sauce.The dumplings were very tender and soft. 5 dumplings were present in one serve.

I have a special affinity for places with good view. This place has a positive vibe, that brings smile on your face. So, We had ordered;
Mangaa(cocktail) : Loved the flavour.

Mad Men(cocktail) : If you're a whiskey person, you'll love it and you aren't one then this drink might turn you into one.

Sticky Korean Chicken Wings : succulent chicken wings. 

Pepperoni Piccante : The pizza toppings were pork pepperoni, chilli and mozzarella ; a match made in heaven. Loved it.

Love the interior, specially the high ceiling. The staff is very nice and welcoming.
It was a really good experience.

It has been in my bucket list since forever. And boy, I loved it. First time you step in the place,and boom, it's breathtaking.The Kolkata skyline looks so spectacular. They have a cozy smoking zone too. Now coming to service, we ordered their special butterfly chicken, whiskey and vodka martini. 
Butterfly chicken- 5/5 (It was yummilicious)
Shisha was pretty strong and great too. Later on, one of their staffs recommended us to have their smoked chicken pizza. That was good too.
Coming back? Definitely!
Kolkata needs to come up with more places like this.Loved it.

Monkey bar is the place recommended by zomato itself. Attractive ambience with live music and outdoor seating is something great. The food and services was equally good but  quantity of the food could have been more as the price we found a bit high.
Food we took :
1. Butterfly chicken - Their signature dish, fried base in shape of butterfly with stuffed crispy chicken.

2. Mobar caramelized ribs - It's a dish of pork where pork was very well cooked.

3. Thai seafood curry - prawn and squid in Thai curry served with rice, flavour was exceptionally good 

4.Goan xaccuti - Not much attractive . The only dish I regret on ordering 

5.smoked chicken harissa pizza - proper thin crust pizza with a cheesy flavour and enough toppings.

6- brownie cookie shake - DELICIOUS. 

overall a nice place to visit.

The only reason I'm giving it 3.5 because their prices are way too high! Where the food quantity is not good, compared to the price. But apart from that, this place is great! The moment you enter here, the ambience is what you'll fall in love with.. The scenic view of Kolkata from 9th floor, is just mesmerizing! Foods are yummy... We ordered Butterfly Chicken(must try), Mobar Caramelized Ribs, Thai Seafood Curry(it was very nice), Goan Xacutti(this was not that good), Smoked chicken harissa pizza(too good) and Brownie Cookie Shakeüòã. They have a separate open smoking area. The service was good. At the afternoons, it becomes crowded.. As this place is not that pocket friendly, I'll suggest you to go there with your family!

This place is very close to my heart, like literally.¬†

From the interior french window decors to the ambiance, the location, everything is top notch at this place. Such positive vibe all around, that the moment you enter this place, you would feel really good about everything.

Hopped onto this place on the Saptami evening, and luckily, found ourselves in the table, in the farthest corner.¬†

We started off with a few beers, and chicken satay which was deliciously prepared.¬†
The staff was amazing and handled the rush of the pujas with smooth ease.

For mains, we went for the Spaghetti aglio o lio and the bacon caesar salad, what gave me extra brownie points, was the crunchy hard bacon that they added.

This place ticks off a long wish list, and i would definitely come back over and over again for more

If I was given a penny for every time I fell in love with the Kolkata skyline and the street food, I would be a billionaire. What if I told you that one of the city joints gives you the best of both? Hard to believe, is it? Now imagine this, a fancy cocktail teamed with the classic Jhaal Muri and all of it while taking in a spectacular view of the Victoria Memorial.

Monkey Bar, is that cool, trendy gastropub, where you step in when the mood grabs you. The music is buzzy, the vibe is happy, and the ambience relaxed yet cool. Food is as important as the design and music and for once, the bar has kept abreast. Its trendy and affordable and, above all, high on taste! There is never a dull moment at this all-day gastro-pub, whether it is a casual outing with friends, a catch up after work with colleagues, a Sunday lunch with your family, a date with someone special, or getting your weekend mojo back. The vibe is trendy, young India.¬†¬†It is contemporary, yet, familiar. This is exactly my kind of place.

Do try the creative cocktails and the wide variety of lip-smacking dishes.

Went to this place to celebrate my birthday with two of my friends on 06Nov. The glass window seats were all occupied so we sat in the open terrace area. However the lighting there was very insufficient so we shifted to one of the window tables inside as soon as there was one vacant. The view from the window is nice as the restaurant is on the 9th floor. The ambiance of the restaurant is pleasant.

We began with mocktails. I had a ginger infused one which was okayish. They hardly have a choice in mocktails. Even the cocktails are few and the list has no Bloody Mary on it.  Then, I ordered Kung Fu rolls (vegetarian) and my friends ordered Butterfly Chicken and Devilled Fish. All three were tasty. The menu said that French Fries were complimentary with three starters. Hence, we asked for it, but a waiter argued with us that we had not ordered the three starters at the 'same time' (which was not true) so we can't get the fries. After a while he brought two small portions of banana and sweet potato chips. These were absolutely tasteless. We did not like his attitude too. Some of the waiters were not well versed with the menu. 

In the main course,  my friends had chicken khichdi, which they said was good. I had Mix Mushroom Bruscheta which was not very good as it had a sweetish flavour. As it is, the vegetarian choices in the main course are very limited. We ended with a dessert - Creme Brulee - which was satisfactory.

Overall, a middling experience.

This place has a very hip, industrial vibe with the high ceilings, and a breathtaking view of central Kolkata from the 9th floor windows. The skyline is adorned by the Victoria memorial, St Paul's cathedral and the 2nd hoogly bridge. It is the perfect place to enjoy the city lights after dark, while sipping on a drink.
We started off with a cocktail called Manga, which with the delicious kancha aam flavor packed a very potent punch. We also tried the mobar ribs, which were melt-in-the-mouth, fingerlickingly delicious and the butterfly chicken, which while looking very pretty, tasted kind of flat. We finished off with the monkeccino, which is the usual cold coffee with a hint of mint. The play-list was amazing and all in all, a very pleasant afternoon was passed in here.
On the down-side, the quantities are very less and this place charges service charge.

Well, I had been to this place on the 6th of November, 17 along with 2 of my friends.The place has a well bulit ambience, a great and decorated interior, well-behaved staff along with a rooftop which is situated on the 9th floor. The view from the top is damn good and you get to see Victoria memorial along with The 42. We had ordered a Kingfisher Draught Pither(1L) and a plate of GOAN CHORIZO PAO which was good in taste.The quality of the food was good but it was a bit on the costlier side. So in a nutshell, I would say that this place is good for spending quality time and for hangouts.

From the moment you enter Monkey Bar , you get positive vibes. It's decor and ambience is of international standards and the panoramic view of Kolkata just adds to the appeal. On the downside , service is a tad too slow and portions are not that big. Still , a wonderful place to dine. Also , love the karaoke nights here !

Some serious monkey business goes on in this place, no wonder why it's named like that! Having said that, I must also mention how I've been in love with Monkey Bar since it's inception in the City of Joy. The first time I visited was right after one week of its launch at the Fort Knox Building, and I kid you not, the killer decor with that view had me at their disposal.
Monkey Bar lives upto its name when food and service is concerned. Even though I prefer a fun night out with friends at this place, it's also perfect for a family dinner, and that's the best part. Have tried few of their Pizzas, Korean chicken wings and their signature dish - Butter Chicken Khichdi. What sets this place apart is their spacious interior and separate seating area for those who wants to order Hookah.
I'll never be tired of the awesomeness that Monkey Bar is!

Lovely high on energy place with well trained staffs offering intercuisine fusion foods--that's what Monkey bar is all about. We had ordered korean chicken, smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza and butter chicken khichdi. The food was beyond tasty,  especially the korean chicken was crispy from outside and evenly cooked and soft from inside, spiciness was properly balanced. Addition of sesame seeds in the dish has completed the tastefulness. One must try the fusion food butter chicken khichdi, the complementary sweet-tangy taste boosters, given along with the khichdi, are just perfect.üòã I liked the way they had kept a seperate terrace area for those who had ordered hookah, though it was not air-conditioned . The view of victoria memorial from the terrace was just spectacular. Definitely worth a second visit. üòä

Location: Although in a prime location, a little difficult to find using GPS alone.

Decor: Awesome. Huge place, pretty lights, ample seating area, beautiful decor.

Menu: The most impressive I've seen in a long time. There are just SO many dishes.

Food: Really, really tasty. I had Tiger beef steak. My friends had chicken chimichuri, lamb burger, and berry pulao. Perfect food, no complaints.

Drinks: Had copper monkey and mangaa. Liked mangaa very much. Copper monkey was okay.

Price: Pretty reasonable. A typical student can visit once a month or so. Although the 10% service charge was a bit steep.

Service: Hah, that's a story. My friend doesn't eat beef, ever. It was also a Tuesday, a day when she doesn't eat non vegetarian food at all. But that was our only chance to visit the place so she consented o eat chicken chimichurri. The server came and placed a dish in front of her. She started eating it. I tasted it. Quite spicy, we both agreed. 15 mins or so passed by, and the waiter came with another dish, placed it in front of us. This doesn't look like beef, I say to the waiter, this looks like chicken. He says yes mam this is chicken. I ask what is that then, pointing at my friend's plate. Beef steak, he says. We three stare at each other. My friend's face looked like she was contemplating puking out whatever she'd eaten. We didn't mind THAT much, but I feel like servers need to ask whose food what dish is before serving them. I'd have given a 5 star, if not for that incident.

Finally my search for a perfect gastro pub is over. Beautiful ambiance, wonderful staff, good crowd, soothing music, variety of alcohol and lip smacking food. A real secular joint and hope it stays this way and not get swayed away in pleasing the paneer loving rich Marvaris. They serve beef and pork. I tried the Keralla beef fry, Tiger Beef, Beef Gelauti and each and every item was amazing. I also ordered pork ribs, pil pil prawn, keema paw and chicken wings. I am a big eater and just loved their menu. Short, compact but very different. This will be on my regular. Please please never stop serving beef and pork.

Camac Street and Park Street have been coming up with some high-on-energy places that matches up to the night life of Mumbai and Delhi. It  is really nice to see that such places are getting a lot of space and acceptance in Kolkata.

Situated heart of Camac Street, this restaurant-cum-bar reminds me of the Mumbai pubs - high on energy, loud and pumping music, awesome drinks and good food. Easily one of the best places to go on a Friday/Saturday night to feel the pump. Excellent ambience and space.

Service is also good. Definitely more than worth a visit.

Well this is a pub I did enjoy visiting but the reason I have to out of the four pointer club is the food and drinks quantity. Based on the menu pricing the quantity is too less even for a two sharing. It's expected to take a 300+ dish and atleast share it among two but that will not satisfy either one's appetite. Same for the drinks with a pitcher costing 1500+. Otherwise the environment is cool, not so pub like but have a wonderful Kolkata skyline view with nice seating arrangements. The music was quite cool and at a limit where people can talk. The smoking with cigarettes and sisha have a separate area. The service was prompt and waiting was quite amicable. Overall a very worthy nice pub for a hangout with friends at a very convenient location.

Went with my better half and brother on the day of the opening of the Fifa U17 WC.Watched it over there on the big screen and loved it. Live music is pretty good (too loud at times). One of the great plus is you get an amazing view of our city of joy from here which adds up to the fantastic ambience. Had 1 pitcher of Mangaa,4 Hoegaardens,Butterfly chicken,Chicken Chapli,IT Aunty's daab chingri pizza and Mobar sundae sandwich as dessert. A must try at that time of the month when you have plenty to spend as this place will make your wallet become much lighter.Ratings on the 5 most important aspects:-

It will be great if you can manage one of the window side seat over here, the view outside is great, this restaurant is at 9th floor of the building. Initially the took 1000 per head, we were 3 so total of 3000 needed to be paid in advance, and it was like whatever we will have over there we need to pay the amount exceeding 3000, if your bill amount is less than 3k, you are at loss ;)
Lets now talk about food, we ordered prawn ghee roast which had ghee rice along with a prawn dish which tasted very nice and totally different than any bengali or Chinese prawn preparation. We had smoked chicken harissa pizza, loaded chicken nachos.
Though this place was a bit costly, still the experience was good.

Excellent food, great Ambience and good service - That's the best way to describe this place. If you are a non alcoholic and want to hang out in a Pub with your friends, go here n order their Ginger Beer. It's a virgin beer and the taste is amazing.

I am a regular here and the B'ful view of Victoria at night from their outdoor seating is what makes me go back again n again to the place.

Here are my picks with food - Loaded Nachos, Galouti Kebabs (pls see they are made with Beef) and Sausages. There are a must have on my table. The Galouti kebab will just melt in your mouth.

Music is good, they have Karaoke nights also on one of the days in the week.

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, Camac Street. Very easy to locate.
Valet parking is available.
Now coming to the place. Very beautifully designed with the perfect combination of modern and old Calcutta touch. The view of the Kolkata skyline is just mesmerizing. They also have an outdoor section for people who like to smoke.
Gives out a very positive vibe and happy ambience. Very well selected music is played.
The staff being very well behaved and tend to give very appropriate suggestion to make the guest's experience better.
Now as for the menu - both the food and drinks menu is very well designed with quite a big array of interesting items to select from.
I have been to this place twice and adding both up, we had ordered MOBAR CARAMELIZED RIBS, BUTTERFLY CHICKEN, SMOKED CHICKEN, SALAMI & HARISSA PIZZA. Coming to the drinks TOAST TO CALCUTTA, BOURBON LIIT, BEAMER LIIT, SANGRIA.
The food was lip smacking and the drinks were on point.
The perfect blend of good food, good drinks and good ambience.
So, foodies visit this place soon if you haven't already and enjoy the beautiful view of city whilst having some delicious food and drinks.

Monkey Bar makes you a happy soul just when you set your eyes on the excellent view from the place. 
A perfect ambience with perfect music, Monkey Bar is ideal for a day out where you want to unwind and sip on your favourite cocktail. Moreover, the range of in-house concoctions are definitely going to make you want more of them. The LIIT with Bourbon or the Old Fashioned on the Camac are must tries. If you have impending love for Gondhoraj lebu and prefer something refreshing, Toast to Calcutta is your way to go.

Brownie points for a rainy day as you would love to try out their Butter Chicken Khichdi.

The place with a great view, nice ambience and nice presentation of food. Well the food also tastes good. The menu is a bit different from the usual ones so those who love experimenting with food this place is a must visit. If you can grab those high chairs by the window then enjoy the Kolkata Skyline while you eat. The cocktails are really interesting. Tried mangaa and loved it. For food we opted for non veg mobox, which is basically 3 small non veg dishes with complimentary french fries and chips. But if you don't calculate the price of your dishes properly then you might end up paying more for opting for mobox. I opted for butterfly chicken, Keema ghotala and prawn pei pei. The service is good.
Post GST keep an eye on the bill. They still charge service tax which is now optional.

Location: Fort Knox building opposite British Council, camac street.

It is a spacious, well maintained, classy party and hangout destination. Great decor, superb lighting, nice music.

Food was good if not great, Barbeque chicken pizza could have been done in a much better way whereas the corn and cheese dish was very nice. The chocolate shake was just about ok!!But where this place disappointed was the concept of cover charge. This was new for me and it seemed more of a coercion to me and as foodies we must not really agree with these gimmicks!Price is obviously on the higher side.

Staff is nice and very quick with their service.

Whatta a brilliant visit during lunch last week.
The view is one of the best in the city with the iconic buildings -- cathedral, victoria and the 2nd hoogly bridge! The seating arrangements and decor are to good taste and comfort.
We went in the afternoon for lunch and ample daylight made us feel warm and cozy with the inside temperatur being apt. They also have a smoking area which can be enjoyed in the evening to the fullest i believe.
We ordered quite a few starters and few drinks.¬†
1 - Their special Sangria -- made quite well, but i wished to have a bit more fruits to bite on as well
2 - Mangga -- really good drink, you would love to keep on drinking and won't understand when it hit you!!
3 - Chilli Cheese dragons -- beautifull crispy spring rolls stuffed with generous amount of cheese¬†
4 - Pepeered Calamari -- nice , crispy, hint of sea food, and by adding twist of a lemon will make it a good option with your Mangga.

For other options, i have visit soon again! Impressive !

Located at the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, this joint is not for the tight-fisted as the prices of food and beverages are on the higher side. But once you enter the joint it more than makes up with the view of the typical Kolkata (including Victoria Memorial, The Maidan, St. Paul's Cathedral and The 42) you get from the lounge is worth every penny you spend here. Coming to the food, our primary aim was to fulfil the Nabami luncheon with our meat cravings which you usually do not get in your daily meals. And Boy Monkey Bar did NOT disappoint. We ordered Tiger Beef and Pork Bao with each having it's unique taste and deliciously retaining the original flavour and character of the meat, heavenly! For thirst quenchers we ordered the house-favourite Maanga (raw mango, aam panna & vodka) and Gondhoraj-lime infused Toast to Calcutta. Both were unique and very refreshing given the time of the day. More points to The Maanga for sheer innovation and delight-count. Next we went for the most instagrammed dish of the city, Butterfly Chicken. This again retained the original flavour of the meat and looked beautiful, but slightly lagged behind on taste in comparison to our previous 2 choices which were a knock out of the park! üëåüëå
For the second round of Tipsiness we preferred Hipster Smash (again a vodka-based refresher with cucumber and water melon, easy-breezy!) and Pack A Punch (Rum, Apple, Cinnamon) which were both unique in their own rights. We ended our love-affair with the place with the desserts, Mobar Sundae Sandwich, which was probably the only letdown of the afternoon. Nutella, Chocolate, Nuts, Cream, Fruits - too many things were tried to fit in and as a result the outcome was ordinary at the best. But other than the wrong choice of desserts, we had a perfect Durga Puja Nabami lunch at Monkey Bar. It's cool, It's Beautiful, and we are definitely coming back to re-live the memories before they fade. Thank You! ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫

Location = fort knox at the 9th level next to TBZ !!!
Parking is easy to find! Though I don't know about any occassional day as I visited this place during the afternoon on a thursday!

This builduing has been almost the same throughout since I use to visit with my dad!
So we entered the restaurant which was according to me was a laid back restaurant kinda setup sort of a modern countryside bar setup!!! May be because it was an emptied afternoon I couldn't get a feeling like being in a bar!

I quite liked the first appearance of the setup the music was classy which gave me more hope about the service ahead! Every song of the evening was too good to describe!
So we went for a table next to the tall glass windows and as it was the sunset hour it was amazing to look at, the variegated hue in the sky along with the heritage of kolkata Victoria Memorial, st Paul'scathedral and also a partial view of the Vidyasagar setu, we enjoyed the colours of nature a lot as it was on the 9th level!!!

Now coming to the food and service we ordered chilli cheese dragon as a the starter along with mangaa the much celebrated drinkout here a vodka martini and a old fashioned at camac which came after 15 mins and starter came once we were done with our drinks that was after waiting for 25 minutes which was unacceptable whereas  there were hardly any rush at that time there were only two more couples and we were afraid to order something else because of the time but we thought of giving it another try and placed order for a kebab platter with egg paratha, the most tasteless kebab and paratha I've ever had was that afternoon and the starter it was bland even with the sauce it had no taste, I can't describe how hopeful I was about this particular bar but it failed when it came to the food drastically, so so dissapointing it was as I mentioned about this to my friends several times but we were all so sad as we couldn't have had the satisfying stomach, I just hope they recover the food part.

The whole rating of mine goes to the ambience and the view, wish they've had impressed me with the service and the food too!!!

This is a very happening place in town..
I was not impressed by the pictures provided in zomato though..
But,i was surprised when i went there on Nabami night..
It was overcrowded..nd we were asked for a cover charge of ‚Çπ1000/head..(p.s.- i don‚Äôt know if they usually ask for a cover charge or it was due to the pujas)..
The ambience nd the crowd overthre is really nice..
Food is awesome..nd service is good too..
They also have an outdoor seating place with a huge screen nd a great dj..
Nd the best part is you can get a good view of The Victoria Memorial from there..

I am a food blogger who doesn't eat out as often as she should. But Monkey Bar was a miss I wanted to rectify for a long time. And we land up in the Calcutta one! 

Ambience: GREAT!!! 
High vaulted ceiling, spaced out tables, a separate smoking zone, reasonably sized bar counter, giant screens, smart DJ, clean restrooms...all good! 

Bar: GOOD!!!
We wait at the bar since a table would take about half hour. No flavoured vodkas available, a downer this one. We stick to normal Absolut and JD. The bartenders are very efficient when crowded. 

Service: PROMPT!!!
The servers are super eager to clear so be careful of that last sip; your glass may vanish before you get to it!! 

Food: We eat a lot, as usual! 

Devilled Fish: VERY GOOD!!! 
Chunks of fish tossed in copious amounts of ginger, garlic and chilli. Good texture, the coating on the fish just right and lots of flavour. 

Sticky Korean Chicken Wings: VERY BAD!!!
The wings look less than appetizing since they are almost the same colour as the bowl. Well so was the fish, but it had garnish! 
Described as "Fried chicken wings coated in spicy gochujang and sesame with a honey chilli glaze" - the only boxes I could tick off were fried, chicken, coated and sesame! There was no chilli, no honey and no flavour other than sesame which I love but here it just overwhelmed my palate.

Roasted Beet and Orange Salad: GOOD! 
The mustard dressing is phenomenal, not for the faint hearted though. I thought the lettuce was a bit too much in proportion to the beet and the feta and orange too less, but the overall taste was good. I have a feta fetish so there can never be enough feta!

Mobar Burger: EXCELLENT!!! 
Soft burger buns holding in two juicy tenderloin patties, cheese, caramelized onions...you can't go wrong with this one! Served with crispy fries, pickle and slaw. 

Mobar Pork: VERY GOOD!!! 
Double cooked, crispened pork belly with noodles and vegetables in black bean sauce. The sauce is packed with flavour and tasty enough for us to lick the bowl clean. The pork could have been crisper and quantity of noodles slightly less! 

Choco Lava Cake: EXCEPTIONAL!!! 
A dark chocolate cylinder that oozes the most incredible amount of molten chocolate, served with a perfect quenelle of mint ice cream. I don't eat chocolate but the perfect lava flow and the fact that the 18 year old at the table was weeping tears of joy while eating this dessert is good enough for me to rank it higher than everything else üòÉ 

I was tempted to score Monkey Bar Calcutta a 4.0. It has a lot going right. But tasteless chicken wings is an unpardonable food sin in my eyes. Hence this stays at 3.5.

Located at camac street in Fort Knox building. You can easily find Parking in the building. Menu is quite expansive. Love the ambience. If you love to dine and wine in company of a good crowd, tthe place. The crowd is much better than other places in Kolkata. Service is prompt and they know their stuff. Have already been here many times. Menu is reasonably priced. A great place to visit with friends and spouse.

The best bar in the town in terms of location this place is a simple treat for every person who wants to enjoy a good drink and a great view of Kolkata. The best part of this bar is not that it is perched at 9th floor of a building but that four iconic architectures of Kolkata the Victoria Memorial, St Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, Second Hooghly bridge and even the Howrah bridge can be partially seen from this place. The ambience is no doubt great with interiors giving u a feeling of a venetian cafe plus the projector displays playing the blank and white videos of the olden days of Charlie Chapman movies further adds to the perfect environment of the bar. The cocktails served here are good but the only drawback is that they charge too much for beer which can be easily reduced. The food is great though a little pricey considering the quantity they serve. Overall a great experience that one will have and a perfect destination for both chilling out with friends or for a dinner date with one‚Äôs special person in life. I would suggest everyone who is visiting Kolkata to pay a visit to this place atleast once.

Monkey Bar is perhaps one of the most prettiest places I have ever seen and you can literally see the Victoria and the Second bridge from their windows‚ù§Ô∏è_‚ù§Ô∏è

We ordered beer and kamikaze shots and they were pretty much the same so let me come to the food,We ordered Beef Bulgogi and BBQ Pork.Talking about presentation,they looked very exotic and if you are talking about taste,I didn‚Äôt expect it to be this good because it was just perfectüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏èüòåI had BBQ Pork and the meat was so tenderly cooked and they had veggies and butter rice to accompany with that.It was beautiful.I even tasted the beef dish and that was pretty good too.The portions may look a bit less but it was enough for me :3
I would love to visit this place again,both for it‚Äôs food and ambience.

Situated on the 9th level of the fort knox building, this happens to be the ultimate destination for chilling and having a good time with your friends...

After having lunch at afra tafri on ashtami afternoon we decided to spend some time off at monkey bar, the place that i have heard so much about. And for a moment all the gossips were right...

This place mainly packs a punch with their ambience and the fact that from the 9th level of fort knox the view of kolkata which you get is spectacular.. the place was totally packed but we were lucky for not having to wait..
The ambience was all well lit, but around 6pm or so they dimmed the lights and it became even better... So i would suggest that if u have to pop the special question, visit monkey bar and that too during evening... Don't think u would regret...

The staffs are courteous and friendly...

A great place.. we had a great time... Would like to visit again sometimes... ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

Went there during Durga Puja on Saptami night. As expected, it was overcrowded like all other places are during the Pujas. Loved the place, the ambience, the music, the view, the staff and food as well. We ordered CHILLI CHEESE DRAGONS, BUTTERFLY CHICKEN, TIKKI OF JOY, TIGER BEEF, VIRGIN MOJITO and CAIPIROSKA. All the items were good in taste especially the Butterfly Chicken and Chilli Cheese Dragons. These were just yumm. TIKKI was recommended in Zomato but we didn't like it much as compared to rest of the dishes. Overall it was a good experience being there. Would recommend to visit this place.

The fact that I disliked the most was that they are asking for service charges from customers even after the gst thing has been applied. Hence service charges should not be there in the first place, but I guess they are pretty ignorant about that. Their food and ambience is good but yes the classic l.i.i.t was not upto the mark. Hope they will improve their services in the future...

A lovely place with an attractive decor offering a scenic view of Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and some other landmarks of the city. The places beside the window are preferably the best positions to occupy to enjoy a cozy meal.
Lunched here with a university friend on Nabami. We gorged on their popular Butterfly Chicken, Iti Aunty's Daab Chingri Pizza and their signature dessert The Snicker Bar.
The Butterfly Chicken is a set of sweet, spicy bits of chicken tossed with sesame oil, chilli, honey and peppers and stuffed in their signature butterfly shells (my friend commented the crisp shells tasted like phuchka!). It comes in three pieces, but for the quantity offered we felt it was tad overpriced. With a taste like Chinese-style chicken, it was delish.
The pizza was a thin-crust pie of 6 big slices topped with slow-cooked prawns with tender coconut, ground mustard, chilli and fennel and garnished with coriander. This too was well-made and fresh, and tasted fine drizzled with Tabasco green pepper sauce offered at the table. 
The Snicker Bar was the piece de resistance and abdolutely lip-smacking exquisite to taste, possibly one of the most scrumptious desserts I've had till date. Consisting of milk chocolate ganache on a layer of hazelnut and almond crunch, flourless chocolate cake, peanut butter pastry cream and coffee praline ice-cream, it was mindblowingly delicious.
For European, Asian, American and North Indian cuisine with a variety, this place is a must visit. Would love to visit again soon! üòä

The place is beautiful. The ambience is Very vibrant, classic and comforting and the window side view of the Victoria memorial makes it a pla√ße to go again for that view. 

The place is quite famous for its non vegetarian dishes and have few limited items for vegetarians. We ordered Chilli cheese dragons, corn and cheese nuggets(the best corn and cheese nugget i had so far) and farmer's pizza( worth trying atleast once). 
Also ordered the caramel shake(which honestly could have been a lot lot better)

Also, the concept of drawing on table and the sheets where you can colour and play games makes it a place where one can kill time if they have to wait for their friends to arrive/ they are accompanied by kids. 

But overall the place is good, Staff courteous although the service is a little slow (only thing that let me down was that they at times rush the customers and that just puts one off ) but I am sure soon enough this place is gonna be perfect in all aspects. 

Must recommended if you are in a group.

The ambience is laidback and the place provides a good view of the Maidan & Kolkata Skyline.
However, they can afford to go a bit low on the music as it felt too loud for having a conversation.

Great food but one of the worst audio systems ever! It's better switched off. You cant hear the vocals but only the low end and even that has no definition. The midrange to vocals is non existent and drowned in the low quality bass. It's better you don't play music at all. Coming to the food you served one of the best pork I had in Kolkata , it was really good. But the sound system was a bummer , get a pro , get the accoustics corrected.

Place& Ambiance : the place is divided in two section , one section is for fine dinning and boozing and the other section where they serve hookah food and drinks, in case you want to have hookah you have to be in that section, music was not that great compare to other place

Staffs: staffs are just okay, onces you placed the order they hardly care if you want anything else and when they hardly attend you in proper way , you have to ask the  them to clear the table.

Food: we ordered panner khichdi , mocktail and hookah, panner khichdi was yummy and must try if you visit this place , hookah was okay ,staff dont care much if you like it or not and moctail was nice

I will start with the let down points, i.e.the service-it was slow, the waiters are not at all clear with their work, they need more training (atleast few of them), they are extremely confused & cannot present themselves to the guests. Apart from that, the place is awesome with awesome food & live music. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I enjoyed the live music very much, i wish i could upload the videos (u can check that out on my instagram). The musicians that day were amazing.
The ambiance & the outside view, i have only 1 word WOW, u can see Victoria Memorial, Cathedral Church, the 42 & many more things from this place. The smoking area is well planned & there is hookah available too.
Now comes the food, it was DELICIOUS. We ordered tiger beef which was 1 of my favourite & i still dream about that dish, chicken chimchuri this also tasted good but a bit oily, then we ordered mobar caramelised ribs & kerala beef. The quantity & the quality both were good & satisfactory.
Honestly, i would have given 4.5 rating to this place or 5, but because of the bad experience with the service had to give 4. But anyways, this place is a must try out, a bit expensive but worth it !!
We really enjoyed being in here, will definitely try out this place, again.

It's a well maintained place with a classy interior. The service is good. The Visual design of the food they serve is also good. There's also a separate hookah zone ,  provided with coolers , so that the rest of the people don't get disturbed by the smoke.Another good thing is the view from the windows , it's really amazing to watch.

This place is located bang in the middle of Camac Street Area. A high end posh bar and restaurant, my friends and I knew this would pinch our pockets hard when we came across it after a day of shopping.
The decor is tastefully done, and the area can easily seat around 25-30 people.
In the mood for some alcohol, we ordered a 250 mL glass of Kingfisher draught beer and a 60mL pint of Fuel Vodka. We also ordered a plate of Hot Wings. The food quality was good enough.
However, my main complaint is about the service. The waiter who took our order gave us completely wrong information about the price of Fuel Vodka and when it was time for us to pay the bill, we saw it hiked up. When asked for an explanation, the man simply apologized at having said the wrong price and went off nonchalantly.
Will think about coming back here.

The only good thing I found about this place was the ambiance and decor. The hospitality was not good. Staffs are not well versed with the menu. The quantity and quality of the food according to the price was not upto the mark. It's just worth a try.

From the bar you can view Vicoria Memorial in the night lights.

When I heard that monkey bar has opened in Kolkata, it was in my goto list. I expected this to be like the Bangalore one, but let me share my horrible experience:

Ambience : It is in a posh area in Camac street at the 9 th floor of the building. The area is not that big but it is nicely decorated. I think thats the end of the good part. The tables are badly aligned, water is leaking off from the AC's ( from all the AC's). When we complained they just changed the sit and again filled that sit with new customer. When they have complained they replied, its because of the weather change. I was confused whether to laugh or get angry after hearing that reply

Music : I have never heard such sad music on a Saturday night in a packed pub that too in loud volume. They don't have dance floors or place to dance then why were they playing music in such high volume where no one can hear voice just across a small table. And dance, i don't think anybody can dance in a pub on a Saturday night hearing Unfaithful by rihanna.

Food and Drinks : t was nothing special. Very limited options in drinks as well. They ran out of beer by 9 pm on a saturday night.

Service : Pathetic if i have to sum up in one word. They dont know what to say if any complains came in their way. And the best part or should I say the worst part of my evening when we paid the bill. When we paid the bill for the first time by card, the amount got deducted and we got the message but for some strange reason the machine didn't print the copy so they asked us to pay again. We have explained about the message that the money got deducted but they said the machine didn't accept. So we paid again and then went to talk with the manager. He said it happens, the money will come within 24 hours. After 72 hours we didn't receive the money and after checking the statement it showed that the money got deducted twice. Now we have to follow bank rules to get the rest of the money.

We just went there to have a great evening and we had a amazingly worst night in my life.
A small advice, if you need to start the pub culture in kolkata just don't rent a place , decorate nicely and then play loud music with average food and worst service. That we can do in our home only.

Thanks for your lovely service.

This place talks of class when you're out for a weekend brunch. A great menu, with a good many selection of sips and wines, with an extremely aesthetically done interior to allow the patrons to enjoy a panoramic view of the city skyline works best for Monkey Bar. Try their Baked Brie and nearly any item on their starter menu and you shall not be disappointed. The pizzas however aren't really "thin" crust as they lose their crispiness within minutes; the truffle pizza is good but not at par with the one at Sera Fina or La Cucina. It's a bit constricted on space and on live music evenings, it does get a bit too loud. Also, the selection of beers is poor as most of the times they're stocked out. Irrespective of these roadblocks, the entire space on Fort Knox and the food menu work out pretty well for Monkey Bar. It's best visited during brunch or lunch hours when it is relatively emptier and you can enjoy your drink with good conversations with the Victoria spire looming in the background.

The new age Gastro Pub has finally arrived in Kolkata and going by the reviews and media attentions, it has already taken the foodies by a storm.. Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, the first thing that catches the eyes is definitely the mesmerizing view overlooking a better segment of the Kolkata skyline.. The seats adjacent to the huge glass window are always recommendable as you get to overlook Victoria or Eden Gardens while sipping through some of their signature cocktails.. The decor has been done keeping in mind the legacy and tradition of Kolkata which I find markedly different from their theme at Mumbai outlet.. Service is professional and flawless with minimal time taken in serving the dishes.. They were having an offer where they served any 3 starters for Rs.900/-.. Coming to food, I sampled:
First off, they served a complimentary platter consisting of chips, breads and fries.. All items were crisp, crunchy and delicious..
Mangaa: A nice twist to Bengali's very own Aam Panna.. It was spicy with the cumin, salty and sweet to the right degree and vodka above all makes it heavenly..
Hipster Smash: The taste was as unique and funky as the name itself.. Never before I sampled a cocktail with a strong presence of cucumber at any pubs in Kolkata.. They added a nice touch by decorating the ice cube to resemble a watermelon cube.. Overall soothing and refreshing..
Butterfly Chicken: Chicken morsels saut√©ed with pepper, chilies and capsicums and served in crispy butterfly shells made from flour.. Absolutely lip-smacking and savor the flavors.. Recommended..
Devilled Fish: More like a pan-fried dish with added flavors of lemongrass and galangal.. They served fresh basa, which were crisp and tasteful..
Prawn Pil Pil: Another of their house specialty.. Prawns tossed in olive oil with lots of garlic and chilies.. However, the only issue I felt is they used too much oil, the prawns were literally swimming in the oil which dilutes the flavor to some extent..
Overall, it was a nice experience, not a full-fledged one but I do plan to venture into some of their other specialties next time.. Good to have an establishment like Monkey Bar finally in town, specially for the younger generation.. Our total cheque was Rs.2323/- (all incl.) as they charged 10% additional service charge..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 4.5/5

First of all I would like to focus on decor, which is quiet impressive. Ambience we cherished couldn't be better than this. Let's cut it short and we can talk about food and drinks. Food and drink is slightly overpriced where I deducted 0.5 from rating, otherwise it os capable to hold rating 5. We tried sangria, monkey mule, shandy, and manga in drinks and we tried pizza, and 3 to 4 starters. Food and drinks were worth drooling. Service was pretty courteous and fast. Overall it's good and you can visit as many times you feel you are down to pull yourself up.

Went for a quick bite to Monkey Bar and loved the ambience. From the exposed bricks to the massive windows with natural light streaming in, it is the perfect place to meet friends or even to sit alone with a book or work. The service staff are extremely polite and the menu is very well curated. Loved the Kung Fu rolls and the cold coffee (Monkeyccino)which had a dash of mint in it. Made this Instagram story and thought I'd share it on Zomato!

This is located in the top floor - 9th of Fort Knox building in Camac Street and adjacent to Urban Desi.

The first thing about this place is the view...Victoria Memorial and 2nd Hooghly Bridge, two icon infrastructure monuments of Kolkata.¬†

The decor was minimalistic with hanging lights (innovative hangers), perfect ambiance to grab a drink or two with friends. The servers were very attentive and courteous.

They have a live music section and the singer was doing a very good job.

Reddy's Popcorn Chicken - Crispy Fried Chicken with coconut shavings, curry leaves, black pepper and lemon. Didnt find it much crispy to my likings but otherwise a decent starter.
Prawn Pil Pil - Prawns tossed in olive oil with chilli garlic and parsley, served with garlic toast - This was quite good in taste.
Virgin Manga - This is a non alcoholic drink of Aam Panna. Quantity was less with more of ice.

Currently one of the most talked place to eat in Kolkata is Monkey Bar. So one fine Sunday afternoon we headed there for lunch. At the first look of the restaurant we were charmed and happy. Very lively decor and awesome view of Victoria Memorial, St. Paul's Cathedral and 2nd Hoogly bridge. Luckily we got one of the high seat to enjoy the whole view. But high seats are not much comfortable.
¬†After looking at the menu we are confused as so many innovative dishes are there. We want to try them all, but that's of course not possible :D. So we have ordered Butterfly Chicken, Chilli Cheese Dragon (as I am a cheese lover) for starter. Then we have ordered for Butter Chicken Khichdi and Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa Pizza. The butterfly chicken was unique in the presentation not much in the taste, it taste like some Chinese chicken dish. Chilli Cheese Dragon was spring roll full of cheese and so so. Butter Chicken Khichdi was really good, unique and filling. Pizza was fresh, with good taste and thin crust but some times the crust seems very hard. Lastly I had Monkeccino, as a coffee loved I loved it, but was expecting more mint flavor in that. 
I definitely want to go back for at least two times to try all of the unique dishes they are offering.

#loaded nachos and butterfly chicken wings were tasty and stuffed in special shapes.
The innovation of designing was pretty good.
The mustard fish mushroom and the desserts have a pinch of classic with mouth watering taste..
The mobar sundar sandwich was a three layered ice cream with brownie and the old monkey cake will be my all time preference,
The vodka with pinch of pudina and sprite took the charm with lemon topping.

Monkey Bar is a nice youthful place with decent ambience and good music. There is an indoor seating arrangement and an outdoor seating area which is basically the smoking/hukka zone. One can see Victoria memorial from this place which looks beautiful with the lighting effect. Service is great as the dishes pop out in no time. Nachos are a winner complementing the warm cheese served on the top. In veg, some dishes that we tried and will recommend will be rock corn tempura and nachos ofcourse. Paneer pakoda fulka tacos were average. In non-veg, must try will be butterfly chicken, chicken chimichuri and chicken chapli. 
As suggestion for the restaurant, number of food items can be increased as the quality of food is really good but the choice is limited. Also the option in mocktails should be increased.
Overall great experience!!

Thumbs up - A simple decor with proper usage of the area specially the terrace part. Awesome!! Food is good but the place makes it better. Good selection of drinks.

Thumbs down - nothing much really.

A must go place for everyone great music loud enough for u too enjoy it as well as talk to ur friends.

Located in the middle of the camac Street where one has to go round and round to reach because of one way lanes the place is at the rooftop and parking is a headache here though you have valet people which is chargeable. The place is good with very nice ambience but ok in service. The menu has limited items and charged too high. Drinks are average. I count mocktails, beverages and cocktails in drinks as hard drinks are same everywhere.

Went there on a rainy Sunday evening and thoroughly enjoyed my poison. There was live music which always adds onto the ambiance. Din't explore much on the Food Menu (though the options read interesting), so that is parked for the review edit.

A perfect place for meeting up friends.The place has an idyllic setting for the people to spend hours over drinks and snacks.The gastropub is located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox at Camac Street.I spent 3 hrs at this place and I don't regret it.This place is ideal for casual hangouts with a skyline view of the city.You will find a beautiful view of Kolkata's most beautiful and famous places like the Victoria Memorial and The Hoogly Bridge.You can choose to sit near the beautiful old fashioned windows and enjoy the city view or, sit near the attractive brick wall with interesting wall frames hung on them.The bar area gives you New York pub feels.The hookah area is outside with a beautiful set up.
Starting with their drinks menu,I was quiet happy to see that, they have included the best in their menu.The cocktail section was interesting but, I wish that they extend the menu in future.My friend who is a teetotaller, felt downhearted when she found that the mocktail menu did not have much variety.I hope the management will work on it.¬†
So,for drinks we chose "Trump Card" for cocktail which had a tangy and fresh taste.For mocktails,we ordered Monkeccino and Virgin Mangaa-an innovative twist to the famous Bengali Aam Pora Shorbot.
For food we ordered Sticky Korean Chicken Wings-it was soft and scrumptious and Smoked Chicken,Smoked Salami with Harissa Pizza-was not happy with its taste,as I found the toppings too dry.Overall the food was good.
I was not at all happy with the main course section,hence did not order from there.They had too much of South Indian or Bengali influenced dishes in their menu which I wasn't too happy about.For dessert we ordered their signature dessert-Mobar Sundae Sandwich,which is I think the best ice cream sandwich I have had ever.I strongly recommend everyone to try this.So,the starters and the dessert were the best part about their food menu.
The staff was not too prompt but,they were helpful.

Located in the 9th floor of Fort Knox in camac street, it scores mainly for its decor and awesome ambience.
It had three sections...one facing the outside from where the Victoria adorns the skyline, another smoking zone in the outside and another the normal seating place.
Soft English songs was the added bonus.
We mainly went in for the drinks however the food surprised us with its awesome quality.
We had Farmers pizza and Smoked chicken pizza, The rooster Booster burger, the hamburger and Go green burger.
The burgers and the pizza was awesome however not so much for the go green burger(maybe because I am sceptical towards veg)
Hookah option was also there 
The prices are slightly on the higher side however the ambience,the foods and the prompt service of the waiters gladly made up for it.
Hoping to visit soon to indulge in their other gastronomic delicacies!!!

We arrived at Monkey Bar on Sunday, my sister had gone through a major leg operation and she was on crutches. The booking person was not bothered and denied us a seat and said there is a queue of one hour! Did he really expect her to  wait on crutches for an hour? It is surprising how disable unfriendly and unthoughtful the place was! The apathy was alarming. I wish they were more considerate.

You can't miss this place if your in Kolkata. What a fantastic place to be in. The ambiance superb. The service top notch. The food out of this world.
If there is one place I won't mind visiting again and again it would definitely be Monkey Bar.
Went to this place with a friend and I wasn't disappointed.
We ordered draught beer, tiger beef, mabaro burger and hamburger.
The Tiger beef was cooked to perfection, haven't had such succulent beef. The only thing which I didn't like was that the dish was swimming in oil.
Both the burgers were excellent. It came with coleslaw, pickle and fries. The patty in both the burgers were excellent, seasoned right and had a smokey flavour.
This place is Highly Recommend. Specially for the excellent food.

Didn't have too much of an issue with the food overall. The pizza fries were pathetic. Nachos and the pizza were good. Though they show some wines in the menu but apparently nothing is in the stock. 
Our grouse was that we had to practically jump on the table to get someone's attention. Pizza took half an hour to arrive so basically it was a case of order not communicated and executed only after enquiring about the same. 
The two issues that really pissed me off. First was that we refused to pay the service charge. They had a debate with us regarding the same which is unnecessary. Most people simply change the bill instead of arguing about it. 
Second is that they advertise themselves as a place with valet parking but they don't have valet parking. It's a gross and blatant lie. Valet parking is only at night when the streets are empty. Zomato itself is to be blamed for spreading this lie. They simply refused to own up the lie. The management has some ethics to learn.

Such a relief to have a place like that in KOLKATA.¬†
Ambiance - *French-istic* - 5. A view that will make you fall in Love with the city all over again.¬†
Food -We went for brunch so couldn't explore the menu. (Until next time..!)
For cocktail I had HIPSTER SMASH - 5. - HEAVEN is the word.. Trust me on that. So refreshing and light. Perfect combinations of watermelon, cucumber and vodka. WORTH THE PRICE.¬†With that we ordered MED PLATTER.. For us the Pita bread was on a crunchy crispy side which is the only thing we didnt like. Apart from that everything on that platter was delicious and amazing.So no harm done. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Plus point - Quick Service.¬†
Pocket Pinch - Rs. 1000/- for 2 people.
A MUST VISIT.

First of I don't understand what's the fetish with KF beer this city has. If a restaurant/cafe is marketing itself as a beer mrkt (at least that's what MOBAR claims) u better get your inventory right. My merely having KF and some madpie brand...u r actually loosing the real beer lovers.... The only reason I rated it 2 was probably coz of the decor. Rest everything else is not worth mentioning even. The quality of food was barely falling under OK category. Music was tooooooo loud... I would rather go to a lounge if I want such a loud music...

Date of Visit ‚Äì 04/07/2017

Location ‚Äì It is located on 9th floor of famous Fort Knox building in camac street.

Ambience ‚Äì The place is divided into two sections, outdoor & indoor. In indoor there are few window seating arrangement which gives an excellent view.¬†

Service ‚Äì Service is good but not that great. Huge scope of improvement.

Food & Description ‚Äì After showers in morning & afternoon, in evening the weather was great. So decided to try this place as it has an outdoor seating arrangement with great view of the city. But to our disappointment, outdoor seating was closed due to wet floors & seat and all the window seats were pre occupied. But the ambience was so good that we dnt mind seating somewhere else. Coming to the food:

Mushroom Galouti - As and when the dish arrived, 1st thing that came to my mind is the quantity. It was too less to be called as complete dish. Taste was average.

Roasted Zucchini, Parmesan & Tomato Pizza - Thin Crust pizza topped with grilled zucchini ribbons, parmesan shavings, sun-dried tomatoes, chopped olives and loads of mushrooms. The pizza was amazing. Highly recommended.

Monkeccino - It was a cold coffee with a twist of mint. Being a coffee lover, I loved it.

Overall the experience was great. Awesome ambience & great food. Recommended.

Pocket Pinch - 1500 for 2 approx.

Monkey Bar has an ambience to die for. The openness of the place, the beautiful windows, the brilliant view of the city! And I haven't even gotten to the food yet.!
They serve the best food I've had in Kolkata. There. I said it. And if they keep up their quality of food and beverages, along with that ambience, I'll happily find excuses to go back there like I already do.
Out of all the cocktails and drinks I tried there, I fell in love with their "Not so Vanilla". I've had atleast 4 helpings of it on the same night. The "Tipsy Sherbet" was quite good too. Also, the Beer Cocktails are a hit! "The Peach Trip" and the "Beergarita" being my favourites. 
Onto the food. My favorite starter would be the "Tiger Beef". The beef is tender, and the dish is a total hit. I've never liked a beef starter better in my life. "The Mobar Bork" was also quite impressive. 
The star of the many nights that I've been there, has to be their "Soulful Bowls". If you haven't found the definition to "foodgasm" yet, try it out. I usually go for the BBQ Pork. And all the non-believers of this dish have slowly followed me on to these. 
Sometimes I crave going back there just to get back to one of those Soulful Bowls. And whoever came up with this name, knew what they were doing. 
Another thing that definitely needs a mention, is their service. They will take care of you. I mean it. There has never been a long wait for my food. Even on the busiest nights. They make you feel warm, welcome and at home. 
I love this place!

Ambience - A1
Food : Aglio olio spaghetti - ‚ù§Ô∏è
Drinks - good variety of cocktails & mocktails

They have two seating areas
One is in closed environment where they dont serve shisha but the atmosphere is really good
Other one is like an rooftop place where shisha is served - there you would feel the natural air - kind of cool environment

Great view. The food is experimental but who cares about the food! You can see Victoria Memorial, listen to the live band playing while lounging on the terrace. We had a happy time here in January. Our friend was getting married and we opted for a long leisurely lunch instead of a crazy bachelorette and we will have fond memories as we tucked into the delicious finger food, the quirky drinks(don't have the cocktail with bitters!) and talked for forever. Full marks for the service.

Monkey bar has been around in Kolkata for less than year and has already become one of the hottest gastropubs in town. There are few places which combine the ambience of a pub and the innovative menu of a top notch restaurant so seamlessly together. I've been to this place three times already, and I simply can't get enough. Granted, I am a quiet person, not much suited to the pub environment. But that's how good the food is; it draws you again and again despite all of that.

The restaurant is located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building, which provides a stunning view of Victoria Memorial and St. Paul's cathedral. There is a special outdoor seating arrangement too. The highlights of their menu are written in chalk on the walls as well as at the tables. The playlist is amazing too: from 50s rock n roll, 60s soul, 70s rock and 80s disco, they have it all.¬†

Well, so far so good. Coming to the real deal, starting with drinks. We've had a virgin copper monkey from the mocktail menu and from the cocktail menu we've tried the mangaa and copper monkey and hipster smash. I found the mangaa to be pretty good, but the others were a tad disappointing, especially the copper monkey which had way too much ice in my opinion. The mocktail was decent, not mind-blowing.

Innovation and quirky combos run through the entire menu almost like a uniting theme, and it starts from the appetizers. Among the ones I've tried, I've loved most of them.
1) Loaded Nachos - Decent, good portion size
2) Chilli Cheese Dragons - Pretty good, but the dipping sauce they serve with it is to die for.
3) Mushroom Bruschetta - Clearly the best veg starter I've had here. The ragout is almost meaty and the crispy bread goes brillantly with it. Meat lovers won't really miss the protein in this one.
4) Baked Brie - The experience of a cheese course, but better. The salty, sharp cheese was oozy, and the addition of sweet caramelised onions balanced out some of the salt. The pastry provided the texture needed, and the finely chopped apple, chilli oil and dollops of mayo ensured that each bite and different and unique.
5) Butterfly Chicken - One of their most popular dishes. We loved the crispy coating and the chicken was cooked to perfection. Pretty good.
6) Goan Chorizo Pao - ¬†The filling was delicious and smoky although the portion size could have been increased a tad more.
7) Tiger Beef - Haven't had this myself, but the others at the table seemed to enjoy it a lot.
8) Sticky Korean Chicken Wings - The chicken was tender and the sauce was amazing with its great balance of sweet and sour
9) Laal Maas Phulka Tacos - When it hit the table, it looked pretty exotic, but once you take a bite, you are greeted with an array of comforting and familiar flavours The richness of the mutton, the tang of the chutney, the fresh crunch of the onion encased in a flatbread : what's not to like?
10) Mobar Caramelised Ribs - I can;t emphasize how amazing this dish was. The pork was impeccably cooked, with just the right ratio of meat and fat, and the glaze raised it to another level altogether. A showstopper of a dish, and probably one of my most favourite starters on the menu

The mains are usually the low point in restaurants which go for fusion dishes, serving the same old, uninspired fare. Well, not here. Monkey bar serves some unique mains which you won't find anywhere else in Kolkata.
1) Iti Aunty's Daab Chingri - Basically a pizza topped with plump prawns tossed in good-ole kasundi with sprigs of coriander. The flavours were familiar and comforting, but I couldn't detect the daab (coconut) component in the dish. ¬†
2) Mobar Laksa - I can't describe in words how good this is. I love my noodle soups and nowhere else have I come across a broth so well balanced, not to mention the generous helping of chicken, prawn, egg, fried garlic and onion, ginger juliennes and two varieties of noodles in this one big, hearty bowl. Go for this if Southeast Asian food is your thing.
3) Soulful bowl - BBQ Pork - This dish reminded me of a korean bibimbap, although we chose pork belly rather than the traditional beef. The components went really well together, but the portion size was way too little in my opinion.
4) Butter Chicken Khichdi - Probably the most famous maincourse of the place, and it takes just one spoonful to realise why. It's a nonveg khichdi made in a makhni sauce with generous chunks of chicken with all the classic khichdi accompaniments. This is good-old comfort food, guaranteed to make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.
5) Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao - Delicious and flavourful, although I wished there was a bit more of a berry to add that acidic kick against all the richness. Nevertheless, a really good dish.
6) Mobar Bork - Pork belly with noodles. This dish smelled amazing when it hit the table, and while the pork was impeccably cooked, the dish tasted just a little flat, and probably needed just a tiny splash of vinegar to make it sing.¬†
7) Shaami Sliders - It's difficult to categorize this one as a starter or a main, but I decided to go with the latter. If you are one of those people who loves striding in the comfort zone of Indian food, this dish is for you. Although I might look like sliders, the patty is basically a shaami, a super-flavourful, melt-in-the-mouth shaami. Add to that the fries, the pickle and the mayo sauce, and you have a complete meal
8) Pork Pandi Curry - The pork, once again, was impeccably cooked. The sauce was jam-packed with flavour, heady with the aroma of curry leaf and coriander. The creamy coconut rice that was served with it was the perfect accompaniment to the richness of the pork.¬†

Now, coming to dessert. This place serves some amazing ones, featuring multiple components that come together to give you the most satisfying mouthful.¬†
1) Nolen Gur Creme Brulee - Probably the most subtle of them all. Very light, the custard is set just right, but the brulee layer did not provide adequate crunch and bitterness to counteract the sweetness.
2) Mobar Sundae Sandwich - Cake, ice-cream, nuts, candied fruit and a quenelle of whipped cream on top, this is the dessert which simply cannot go wrong, and guess what : it didn't.
3) Gondhoraj lime tart - A play on the classic lemon meringue pie, this dessert is a house favourite. The tart lime gel in particular is sublime and cuts through thew richness of the dish, leaving you with a fresh aftertaste.
4) The Snicker Bar - Chocolate, salted caramel, peanut butter, coffee : probably my most favourite dessert combination, and this dish delivers in concept as well as execution. Not only do the components work seamlessly together, each individual component is brilliantly executed. The salted caramel is textbook, the mousse is smooth and the ice cream gives you a smack of coffee right in the face. Undoubtedly one of the best desserts I've had so far.

Service is pretty quick and the servers are courteous. The place might not be one of the cheaper eats in town but considering the food, it's all worth it. I will be going back to this place time and time again. Keep up the good work, team Monkey Bar!

One of the worst restaurant in Calcutta i had ever visted. Firstly the food are not worthy according to the price, very little in quantity. Secondly the drinks are highly priced and now to the ambience part, its like you are sitting in a shopping mall where people are coming and seeing dresses which are displayed for sale. Not recommended to visit afternoon as the sun will stare at you from the glass roof top.! And its the only restaurant to take service charge from you if you are not aware of rules. Not recommended to visit for hangout! Rather you can visit for shopping.!

It was a sangria Wednesday for my girl gang. Good service, great music and lovely view! Would be great if there were a few more gluten free options though!

NO HAPPY HOURS was a big bummer! Especially when they are also hosting exhibitions (where there is a lot of extra noise, kids running amok, random people walking around and looking into your food &  very limited seating that you obviously can't choose).

Okay, it is a bit late review posting. Last week we visited this place. As I have seen the pictures previously, I was excited to visit these place. Reaching the place we found the window seats were already occupied so we headed for the open terrace and it was not a bad Idea also. The place is worth visiting, be it with your friends, family or loved ones.
The place itself is a attraction for many.
Coming to food, it's another factor for which you should visit. We ordered Butterfly chicken which is a recommended dish, and it's very much good to the mouth. Along with it we ordered kingfisher draught glass. Well I didn't like the beer too much. And they didn't have many options for beer. We wanted to taste pork ribs as many of the reviews said it's yummy. But going through the menu we didn't find any pork ribs. So we called the waiter for help. They asked us to order Mobar caramelised ribs, we were doubtful whether caramelised pork would be good or just a waste of money. But as the waiter kept on saying it would be a good dish to ordered, we headed for that dish. Surprisingly it was awesome. The pork was so soft and equally tasty that next time we would definitely order it. Wrapping the food journey we ordered their signature desert Mobar sundae sandwich. It was a layered dessert stuffed with caramel, ice-cream with jelly cubes,cake layers and topped with fresh cream. A different desert I have had so far.
And the waiters were also courteous
A
Overall a worth visiting place.
If you are looking for some good place to spend this weekend u can surely visit here.

They have huge variety in starters however, chilli cheese dragons are my personal favorite. The place is very lively. However, I found this place little expensive due to high service tax.

Visited this place for the first time. Unfortunately was there for a very short time hence couldn't sample anything from the menu.
However, just had a beer and hookah.
The atmosphere is electric, very upscale crowd and a very tastefully decorated place. It boasts of subtlety, class and oomph and the same time.
The team is extremely hospitable and welcoming.
Will definitely visit again to spend more time and to try something from the menu. The rating is bound to go up after that :)

Visited this place on last April. Great environment with live music and amazing view from window side. Had Mama's gal, manga, Tiger beef and butterfly chicken over there. Personally my favourite was butterfly chicken from presentation to taste it was mouth watering. Loved the ambience I'll surely visit this place again.

Monkey bar is not cheap. A cocktail will cost you around 400. Beer is normal price. I went to monkey bar for the decor, the ambience and the view. And it blew my mind, when the sun went down. So anyone who is interested in great decor and amazing views, it's a must visit. It's a great place to chill and enjoy the sky. The waiters are really really good and attend on you throughout. Love the place. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Location, near British council, Fort Knox.

According to ambience it's 5/5. Situated at 9th floor you will get a awesome view of the city. There are 3 tables in the main area adjacent to windows with a great view. We can get a lush green view towards maidan, Saints Paul cathedral, Victoria memorial and Tata Centre on your right. The decor is mind-blowing. It also have a open smoking zone with ample amount of sitting. We may enjoy your food outside if the weather is pleasent. When we entered we none of the window table was vacant so we opted the nearest one and requested the weather to shift us when one eye vacant. We first tried the Beer Factory items Monkey Mule. looks a lot like mojito but served in a beer mug(check my photos). It was not that great though, didn't have a strong portion of liqure. We also ordered hot wings alongwith it. It was awesome. Perfectly cooked, right amount of spices and well garnished. As we were four we went for preachers as it was more economic. We tried the shooter and please expect some real kick. After a while we went for a smoke in the smoking zone and we felt in love with the ambience. We requested to shift our table outside an they promptly did it again. Then we ordered Smoked chicken, chicken Salami and Harisha Pizza. The crust was thin and a little bit crunchy. I am still confused how I felt may be the shooter really kicked in at that moment :). We also tried the hookah, vanilla flavour. It won't run out quickly. Altogether it was a great experience. As per value for many I would give 3.5/5.

Good place capitalising on the awesome view from up the 9th floor of Fort Knox. Service is prompt and the waiters are courteous. There's an outdoor sitting area too where you can smoke a hookah while having a drink. Songs they were playing was just what I love. And they host Karaoke evenings too!
Quality of food is fine. Only thing that bothered me was that the guy serving us didn't bring us the exact drink that we ordered. So make double sure while ordering to get what you want. 
Overall a good place to hang out with your friends or loved ones.

Well, it's a nice place to have a drink and grab a bite. However, perhaps it's not the best place to have a conversation. Keeping that aside, the place looks and feels quite good for one's quintessential Friday/Saturday evenings with a bunch of friends one need not interact with much the rest of the evening.

Okay the hype surrounding Monkey Bar is crazy here. Everybody's going gaga over it. So I went, finally.

Got a table in the smoking zone, that has a cooler and overhead exhausts with a giant projector screen mute-playing old monochrome dance videos. Pretty cool and unexpected.

We had pitchers of draught beer.
For food, we had tiger beef and pork ribs, twice. The pork ribs are heavenly.
Courteous staff. Get the high tables.
The other ones are too big and you sit too far away from your friend. It's awkward and inconvenient.

Music. Just as I went in, they played "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" by Joan Jett & The Blackhearts". I've never heard that anywhere else, not even The Grid, which, according to me, has the coolest and most nostalgic playlists. The other songs at MB were just okay, and they should be played louder.

Highly recommended. If you wanna avoid too much crowd, don't go after 9.

I went to meet an old friend after a long time in the evening. The ambience was nice and the view of the sun setting was great . We had ordered Hail ceasar salad , Mee goreng and in deserts we had ordered Mobar sundae sandwich and Chocolate lava cake. The salad was nice and fresh with lettuce leaves and slightly roasted veggies. Mee goreng was an indonesian noodles which was great in taste . Slightly tangy and spicy , the noodle was perfectly cooked . Mobar sundae sandwich had different layers of cake ( salted caramel and chocolate) along with a layer of cream, tutti fruity, nutella and praline with whipped cream. Only the salted caramel was too salty so it was cutting off the chocolate taste too fast. The chocolate lava cake was served along with the mint ice cream. The cake was delicious with the chocolate oozing out as you put the spoon in but the mint ice cream was not going along with the cake . The level of cream in the ice cream was not balanced properly .

I had tasted their pork ribs at a food fair and had been wanting to try this place out ever since. Me and a friend decided to try this place out and for a Friday, it was not very crowded. They have indoor and outdoor seating arrangements. The tables for two were too close to each other and so we decided to try the outdoor seating, which turned out to be quite pleasant since they have coolers and fans airing it out, brownie points for that. We ordered pork ribs (no points for guessing why) and the tiger beef. The food was really really good. The table beside us was trying out pizzas which smelt divine, I‚Äôll definitely have to go back for that. Overall, good food in a decent ambience..a good experience.
P.S. for such a young place, the music selection could've been better

The place is located just beside urban dezi 9F. The place is very well done! The ceiling adds to its beauty. Big projectors for both indoor and outdoor help when a game is on! 
Food: The presentation was really good, however the taste was not over the top! "Small bites" fills up the finger food appetite. Price: tends to be on the higher end! With alcohol expect it to be at least 1000 per head! Good place to hangout with friends. Outdoor seating is always a plus! 
P.S: why is even called "MONKEY" bar?

Went to hangout with friends ... The top view from the rooftop is awesome ... We ordered drinks, cocktails and mocktails ... Then, ordered a platter of 3 starters and 3 home-made chips ... Loved hipstar smash with Absolut ... Quite innovative ... Popcorn chicken was average ... Korean chicken wings and devil fish was very tasty ... Rooster chicken burger was nice with lots of cheese ... Finally, mobarg ice-cream sandwich and choco lava cake with mint ice-cream was a sheer delight ... The only disadvantage was the lighting ... It's not a pub but still it was too dark ... Clicking pictures is a big problem there ...

Fantastic location, the view from 9th floor is good. They have 2 seating options. Either feel the whether or stay cozy inside. The crancky music there just pumps up the mood. The low light conditions makes it difficult to take pictures though.

Service was good, the response to the orders were quick. 

Food is delicious up there. Chilly Cheese Dragons were amazing. Platter and Pizza was descent.

I left Kolkata/ Howrah right after my class 12 was over to pursue law at a university in Sonepat. While I was not very hopeful of the conditions there, I was definitely sure that Delhi will provide me with ample opportunities to train my tastebuds, and make up for the lack of good, new food joints that I had experienced back home over the four years of my stay here. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Delhi does have a huge range of culinary options for consumers to choose from. And Kolkata is catching up too. Since I spend most of my two month long semester breaks here, I have decided to explore Kolkata And this is probably the first in a series of reviews of restaurants in Kolkata, new and old.

Well, the place looks perfect with the rooftop facility. However, the seating arrangements could improve. I mean, it seems as if they expect huge groups or maybe couples only. What about a group of four or three ? A lot of space is being wasted and the tables are quite close to one another as if we are participating in a debate. The menu could also include a lot more items. Especially the drinks section. Apart from these, the place is quite up to the standard and worth your money. Thumbs up but certain changes might fetch them a heart as well.

Having heard by many of my friends about this place, I finally decided to walk into this place. This place has undoubtedly got a beautiful ambience. Besides it is located in one of the renowned and lively lane. I decided to take the corner seat beside the window. But unfortunately the view was nothing to boast about. I ordered a loaded nachos which was loaded with kidney beans and was just above standard. I have had better nachos in other places. The drink I ordered was Margarita which was frozen and very nicely presented. The place is a bit expensive but it is fine for a one time visit. Rating it a four star greatly for the ambience.

I have been to a lot of newly opened pubs in Kolkata recently but this place stand out in front of the rest, starting from the ambience once you enter the place to the tune & mood of  music, this place would give you all the reasons to fall in love. We went there to drink but we end up eating a lot of food because of the delicious spread of menu they have which you will get in very few pubs in Kolkata. I loved the butter chicken khichdi and I found it very different and interesting in taste and the most fascinating part is they serve amazing desert which I rarely found in any pub in Kolkata. The deserts are worth a try. I would not call it a pocket friendly pub but it is definitely a worth spending pub. Happy drinking guys... \m/

Ambience: Undoubtedly this restaurant has got one of the best location across Kolkata. The open window view makes this place entertaining even if you are alone. Moreover when the frame comprise of the great Victoria Memorial ! Music not too loud, makes conversation easy and spaced out seating arrangements does not allow any interference from fellow visitors.

Food: If you are a Meat lover, this is the place to try ! A lot of options, though we could try only Pork RIbs and Keralian Beef curry, but kind of happy with the dishes they serve.

Drink: We ordered LIIT, well, I have had better ones before and it wasnt anything extraordinary. Later we ordered a Jager Bomb and I quite liked the concept ! Tequila options were also limited to house special only.¬†

Service: The service was late and I felt that the number of men in the floor were little less than the people they were serving.

Overall a happy experience. Would love to come back for more !

Located in the prime area of camac Street, this place is a gem. Top notch ambience and great food. A great place to hang out with friends. Recently been there, the day they started these combos, where you can order 3 starters for 700, served along with banana chips and fries. 
We ordered nachos which were great. And some chilli cheese spring rolls ( don't go for a third starter, coz we regretted not ordering another of this dish).  Absolutely delicious. We didn't like the butterfly shaped tart much. 
Don't remember the name of the dessert we ordered, but have attached the picture.
Service was pretty fast and friendly.

There is a certain reason why I keep suggesting Monkey Bar to anyone who intends to go for a drink. And I'm assured the reason is Joy Guha. 
I've seen well decked managers and well behaved ones. Then there's this person. 
He has an innate quality of developing and maintaining a personal relationship with every table. He somehow knows just when to go and have a word without disturbing the personal space. 
So he suggested  Tiger beef, Pork ribs, Beef Galouti and another fish starter. And I haven't eaten the whole day with the fear of losing the taste. 
The bartenders let you mix the drink to your taste and choice and that's another plus of the place. 
The ambience has always been maintained and barring the entry, there's nothing that should stop me from going back next time I'm out.
I could honestly write so much more but that'll never do justice to the experiences. 

Anticipation to this place has been building well before the gates opened. Let's just say, this is one place that lives up the the hype.
For starters, the entrance and the lifts are extremely shabby. On enquiring, we were assured that the mall is being worked upon and will be up to the standards soon. Till then, at least have the foul smell removed.
Joy Guha takes magic wherever he goes and Monkey Bar is the best example. The service was perfect. We were late and I really liked the politeness with which we were asked to make the last order. We had some pop corn chicken, glazed pork, beef galoti and each had its own charm. Extremely well done, you could cut the pork with a fork, the food here is as much important as the alcohol. The interiors are well decked up including the open air zone.

Had extremely high expectations of this place. To be honest some of them were met. Especially the ambience. But the food was kind of a let down. We had butterfly chicken  and caramelised pork. They were good, but not excellent. The management can look into the option of a happy hours window. Because the Liquor prices are pretty high..

A whole lot of foof and loads of fun - yup!! I was here. The butterfly chicken was awesum with crunchy crust, the buffalo cheese pizza was great. The cheesy corn rolls were yum and overly cheese as the way I love. The beverages of the ecening were sangria, maanga and beer - maanga is a must try. For main course I had aunt Vinnie's berry pulao and prawn ghee roast - the ghee roast was good but the pulao was a let down. It was bland biriyani rice with a droplet of gravy and few shreds of chicken. Over all the ambience was good with live music. Nice place for chilling out on a lazy Kolkata evening.

The food was good.But we were celebrating a friends bday, on a request to play a bday song we were blatantly refused, that was quite a bummer. Afterall, all u want to do is make the day a lil special and such a happening and highly rated joint did not deliver on that note.

The ambiance is excellent. One can see quarter of the city's landmark destinations from the window. We ordered a starter combo. The devilled fish was good. The laal maas phulka taco was something new and different and delicious. Worth a try. Then we had a lamb burger. The fries served alongside weren't crisp enough. The burger itself was tasty but the patty was somewhat hard.

When we asked for the bill we noticed that they had included service charge of 10%. We told that it's not mandatory but the person who gave us the bill said he didn't have official confirmation of that. We insisted him to check again and then he agreed to exclude it from the bill. 

Overall experience was really good and definitely I am coming back to this place again.

Thumbs Down : Small portions.

Food :

Cocktails - 
-> Mangaa - Refreshing. Must try.
-> LIT - You've probably had better. 

Starter -
-> Tiger Beef - Best dish we had here. Must try as well. Perfect flavours. Beautifully cooked beef.
-> Chicken Chimichuri - Good Flavours.

Desserts - 
-> Nolen Gur Cr√®me Brul√©e- Highly disappointing.
-> Gondhoraj Lime Tart - Unique flavours. Too sour at some point.

After a few months of hectic diet, I decided to binge, from no carb no sugar diet to a full platter of gooey, cheesy pizza and tall towers of soda -I was all set to chomp my way down and say "to hell" with calorie counts.Accompanying me were my partners in crime

What a beautiful outdoor seating area they have! That's the first thing that struck me when I visited this place with a friend. There's a lovely view of the skyline and the high seats are quite comfortable, unlike most specimens of their kind. We ordered a Butterfly Chicken and a Mushroom Galauti, along with Jameson for me and a litre of draft beer for him. Service was extremely prompt, everything making its appearance within ten minutes. The chicken is arrayed in butterfly shaped tartlets and tasted great, though it was a touch too tangy for me - I was expecting a more continental style of cooking. The mushroom galauti came with a great pudina chutney and was super smooth to taste. My friend really liked the draft beer, though I personally didn't care for it. I later had a Jim Bean White, and the bill for everything came to 1951 - a tad overpriced, if you ask me, but not exorbitantly so. One thing I did like very much about the bar is two booths near the entrance that allow you to book an Uber and Ola respectively. It's a great option for people returning late at night without their own conveyance. 
Definitely visit for the ambience and some tasty snacks!

One phrase : Sky-high Shocker!!

One of the best ambiances with whole of the city right under your nose gives you one of kind lavish experience ever!!!

We started with Tiger Beef and Chicken Chimichurri... beef was a bit over-spiced and the chimichurri was an average kebab like dish, so both weren't enough to vent us a the delight that was waiting for us...

Now came a recommended one here... Butterfly Chicken, an unique preparation with sweet and sour chicken dices served over butterfly shaped chips... just awesome!

Next, the one meal bowl Chicken Katsu... Oh my my...!! Concoctions of Butter-glazed rice, grilled chicken, beans, half-boiled eggs and what not... As soulful as the name is!!!!

Lastly, Nolen Gur Creme Brulee... I couldn't deduct the 0.5 for the dissatisfaction over the beef... Worth a second visit for this one only!!!!

A MUST for Kolkatans!

Drinks: Perfect. Mangaa was an overload of tangy. Toast to Calcutta was a surprising balance of - again - tangy flavours with gin. Beamer LIIT was strong as LIITs should be - favourite!

Food: Small portions. Nachos tasted more like chaat and less like nachos. Med Platter was a rather convoluted mess of flavours that did not balance each other out. The DIY Pizza was great: we asked them to put everything in the pizza apart from spinach. It was one of the better vegetarian pizzas I've had in my life. (The staff insisted we order a pizza and after it arrived, we realised why!)

Ambience: Whatever could've been said has been said. The skyline will knock your breath away, especially if you can manage to catch the sunset. Music isn't so loud that it drowns out conversation.

It doesn't cost a kidney but it also is not easy on the wallet. I'd have left happier if all the food had matched up to all the drinks.

Perfect place to spend your Saturday with amazing food and view. No doubt Monkey Bar has the best view in the City of Joy where you can see Victoria Memorial, St. Paul's Cathedral and Vidyasagar Setu while having a glass of Manga on a scorch summer afternoon. Go for the view, stay for the music and enjoy the good food. Service is prompt and friendly. My first visit was truly special in Monkey Bar where I got to experience one of the finest sunsets in Kolkata. :) Looking forward to come back soon.

Great place to hang out at with friends and enjoy some good food along with a drink or two. The appetiser menu is impressive, and the chilli cheese dragons and butterfly chicken definitely merit a second helping. The tiger beef was tender and succulent. The berry pulav was a unique one-pot dish of fragrant rice infused with meat balls and shredded chicken. Enjoyed my visit and would love to be there again.

Great ambience with a very spacious and well lit atmosphere. The appetiser menu is smashing. Particularly of note are the chilli cheese dragon, tiger beef and kimchi potatoes. Also highly recommend Aunty Vinnie's berry pulao which is a wholesome dish made with flavoured rice, shredded chicken and chicken keema balls. Of the drinks menu, I highly recommend the Old fashioned on Camac along with the Hipster Smash.

This pub is a gastronomical delight, I swear! Perfect ambience, beautiful decor and the outside sitting area is more beautiful, the view of Victoria Memorial from the 9th floor is a treat to my eyes and it also adds beauty to this splendid place. Coming to foods and drinks, had Mobar Caramelized Ribs and Pepperoni Pizza along with one ginger beer. Food was finger licking tasty but prices were quite on the higher side which is I will say okay because food was awesome. Service is very good and quick too. Highly recommended. :)

Food: 3.5/5
Butterfly Chicken and Peppered Calamari, both were delicious but the quantity was far too less for the price. I didn't like Chicken Chimichurri, was neither very soft nor was it very rich in flavour.

Drinks: 5/5
I absolutely LOVED the Margarita and Vodka Martini, very smooth.

Service: 4/5
Prompt and courteous.

Everything is worth a second visit, except that it is pretty expensive.

One of the few restaurants with a breathtaking view and an equally breathtaking ambience , is the monkey bar. Located in Fort Knox , this restaurant opened its doors to the people of Kolkata only last year. It is a part of the olive bar and kitchen. 
When we went , we ordered ginger beer , beer. , sangria , orange juice and fresh lime. The ginger beer was basically ginger ale. In food we ordered the Korean chicken wings , kimchi potatoes, mushroom pizza , chilli cheese dragons , chicken chimichurri and chilli fish. The chicken wings were the best I've had , the sauce being sticky , sweet and spicy. The chicken was cooked well. The kimchi potatoes were a bit dry , the chilli cheese dragons were very cheesy but the sauce they served it with was spicy and went well with it. Chicken chimichurri were pieces of chicken grilled on skewed with parsley , they tasted different , and the dip was basically onions and garlic suspended in oil. It went well together. The chilli fish had a lot of oil but it tasted good. Coming to the mushroom pizza , it was divine. All because of the truffle oil they used to drizzle it on top. The pizza was loaded with mushrooms of different types and dominated with the flavour of truffles. 
Later we had the vada pav, the laksa, chicken and paneer khichdis. The laksa was very creamy owing to the coconut milk and was very satisfying. The khichdis were moong dal khichdis and tasted good. They were each served with kachumbar, raita, ghee, papad and achaar. In the end we had the snicker bar. It consisted of dollops of meringue which were then blow torched , a bar with cake , chocolate mousse and peanut nougat in layers. It was served with coffee ice cream and resembled the snickers bar. Everything on that plate was made well. 
The staff is helpful and cooperative. They've made sure that the presentation of the food is beautiful and it really was.

Monkey bar is a great place.When you enters the monkey bar you will feel like you have come to a bar in hill station.Amazing view,I wish I had the dslr at that time.Ambience is really cool and mesmerising, specially the roof, it will please your heart.
Now let's come to the food.We have tried variety of items there.

Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao: chicken kebabs,shredded with chicken, saalan and irani berry with saffron,fried onions and potato salli,quantity is huge,enough for five of us, amazingly tasty,chicken is soft and the polao is delicious as well.

Devilled fish: Highly recommended for fish lovers,it's tantalising and mouthwatering.
Chicken Chimichurri: One of their signature dishes,chicken tenders flame grilled with coarsely ground parsley,coriander, chilli garlic, vinegar and olive oil, it's excellent in taste,must try.
In dessert you can try

The SnickerBar which I have tried,it's yummy,milk chocolate ganache on a layer of hazelnut and almond crunch,flourless chocolate cake,peanut butter pastry cream,coffee praline ice cream,i just can't get over with it.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart is also good which some of we triee,it's a lime curd with mint flavour and cookie crust.

Want to try their beef items next time.
Staffs are well maintained and service is also fast.A great place to dine and hangout.

Amazing rooftop views of the glittery Kolkata night-scape. The mesmerizing Victoria memorial adds to the splendor of the backdrop. The interiors have an English pub feel with an interesting mural reminiscent of the very essence of Kolkata. The food is a quirky fusion of different cuisines and flavors and despite much apprehension, it turned out to me quite palatable. Loved maanga, a cocktail with aam panna, lime and cumin. Very refreshing and the best way to beat the heat. We finished off on a sweet note with the snicker bar. Absolutely delightful rendition of the popular chocolate-peanut bar accompanied with coffee ice cream. An evening well spent.

Coming to the drink and food ; i am nota person who loves drinks so no hard ones for me - loved the Virgin Mangaa ( twist of Aam Panna and Sweet Lime ) , i would give a perfect score for the Crusty Thin crust Chicken and Harissa Pizza ; ordered a Chicken Chaapli ,but would prefer it had it been a little less dry . Coming to the desserts - ordered something different from the conventional Chocolate ones , The Snicker Bar - a really nice milk chocolate and peanut butter  cheesecake base with dollops of creamy Meringue .

Drinks are nice... I liked "copper monkey". 
I m a vegetarian... Didn't find too many great dishes but nachos and mei goreng ( they do it without the egg too) were good, mediterranean platter was ok.. Everything lz i tried was not even near to "ok"..
So don't have a high expectation on food but otherwise this place rocks.. Has a very good energy n its the best place to enjoy the sun down in the city!

Had recently treated my friends on my birthday here , i have a special affinity for places with a good view and open air , so the location allured me from the day it opened. The interiors are cool , food that we ordered were brilliant in terms of presentation , tasted nice as well but quantitatively a bit less owing the pricing and comparining with that served in delhi. The cocktails MAANGA and HIPSTER SMASH were both made nicely , i preferred the latter . BUTTERFLY CHICKEN is the one of the most beautiful dish you will get here , the CHEESE DRAGONS made me higher than even the drinks could do , the LAKSA was my kind of thing , delicious and a creamy one , the CAESAR SALAD and MOBAR ICE CREAM SANDWICH were great as well.
The slightest issue was the service ,though the food did not take much time to arrive but the servers weren't very attentive, their energy level was lower than we find at other gastropubs. Among quite a number of instances let me pick out one , I accidentally spilled a good amount of cocktail , they helped to clean the table but thats it, no one asked for replacing or for a second drink. Therefore they score goes down in terms of hospitality. A bit of interaction, positive attitude, serving with a smile can add more vibe to the place improving the overall experience.

The next visit , we had BEERGARITA , MAD MEN , TOAST TO CALCUTTA ( looks simple like a martini) , DABELI , CHICKEN POPCORN , KEEMA GHOTALA , AUNTY VINYS BERRY PULAO , MEE GORENG  , MEXICAN FRIES and SNICKER BAR. All the food was really good except the pulao and popcorn which were average. The dessert snicker bar is highly recommended.

Finally finally its down from my bucket list!!
The place was a huge attraction since its inception in kolkata and my urge has landed me there.
Located on the top floor of the Fort Knox building the place attracts a massive crowd.Ambiance was truly amazing,staffs were cordial and the food was awesome.

We ordered
1.Mad man and beer...both were good.
2.Butterfly Chicken-Highly recommend dish...the dish has 3 pieces of butterfly made with batter and filled with chicken pieces in between.Superawesome.
3.Aunt Vinnie's Berry Pulao-Another awesome dish...with a huge quantity.Form of Pulao with meat balls and shredden chicken gravy..must try!!

They charged extra taxes on liquor and extra service charge..so the pocket pinch is a bit high.

Would definitely look forward to the next visit.üòä

An awesome place to hang out. Amazing experience and the crowd was heart-stealing. Though it has very high cost. But while looking at environment and the crowd it pulls, the price seems valid. It is situated at such an high altitude that you can directly see Victoria Memorial from there. That view is delightful to watch. The music plays there forces you to stand up and tap on the floor. It has one lacuna that it does not have a proper dance floor, so people generally dance near table where they sit. If they work on it, this place will pull much more crowd hopefully.

Located in Fort Knox, this monkey bar has a more happening ambience than its Bangalore counterpart. With three kinds of LIT on the menu, and great music to go with it, monkey bar really scored candy points from me. 
The food was no less tasty. We took chicken butterfly and a pork starter. The pork was cooked very nicely and the pizza we later had was also very tasty. The dessert however didn't impress me much. The mint ice cream had an over powering taste of mint in it and the ice cream sandwich to go with it tasted a bit off towards the last layer. 
It was nonetheless an evening well spent. We came out all smiles. Could have been happier if the place was a little less pricey.

Okay. This place is in the top floor of the Fort Knox building in camac street. Its on the main road so locating it isnt a big problem. Me and my friend planned to visit this place on Sunday. We went there around 6.45-6.50pm and the place was already bit crowded. The drinks are bit costly compare to the other places in the city. We ordered for Mama's girl, tiger beef and soulful bowls with naga chilli pork. ü§ó
The ambience was amazing. There was an open area and a closed one. As its summer so we preferred the closed one as for the AC facility.We took the window seat and we could see the Victoria Memorial and the city lights. Music was very right,right volume and tracks played. The food arived and mama's girl was really good. Blend of vodka and pomegranate tasted nice but what scored more were both the dishes. We just loved it. Tiger beef was delicious and soulful bowl was more yummy. The pork was soft and tender. Spices were rightly added. ‚ù§
Unfortunately there was a small piece of wire found in the food. We complained that to the manager and he immediately replaced it with a fresh one and dint even charged for that dish later in the bill. So yes,the management was excellent üëå
We loved the entire experience there. Its a must visit for all the people who loves drinking in beautiful ambience and good food.

Monkey Bar is located at camac street, fort Knox building. I'd been there last week with my friends.  First off all ambiance is very good with live music. You will get a view of Victoria memorial hall. First we ordered mocktail virjin mojito orange flavour and also ordered pitcher of cocktail like virjin mojito orange flavour. Then we ordered stater items like 1. Chicken hot wings 2. Butterfly chicken 3. Chicken chimichurri 4.chicken chapli. Every item are very delicious and mouth-watering.Must try every item. After that we ordered main course like 1. Aunty Vinnie's Berry. 2. Kheema Ghotala. It is spicy mutton keema served with Pao. Atlast we ordered some desserts like 1. Morbar Sundae Sandwich. 2.old monkey Chocolate Cake 3. Molten Chocolate Shell. All desserts are delicious and tasty. Service is very quick and staff behavior also good..

Thumbs up for the ambience! It has a beautiful view from the 9th floor in the early evening. You can see all the way upto the lit-up Vidyasagar Setu, which reminded me of my college days. Victoria Memorial looked splendid. The hookah section was filled, so we sat in the air conditioned area. Coming to the food, the menu has a very innovative spread but the quantity isn't value for money. We tried Mobar Caramelised Ribs and Keema Ghotala. The ribs dish was amazing and succulent, but the quantity was too less. For desserts, we ordered The Snicker Bar and Nolen Gur Creme Brulee. Both were delicious. But with alcohol, the bill comes up to be a lot more than the one projected here.

A busy and loud Saturday night at Monkey Bar, first round at the bar (cleverly christened Mangaa), second round at a squished up table, noughties pop music blaring away, international standard decor, the swish set, stomachs overloaded with snacks (mac & cheese croquettes, nachos, day‚Äôs specials kimchi potatoes & my beloved dabeli).
 Everything about this place including the food wears a confident coolth but the latter remains short of a simple awesomeness.

I've been to this much hyped place in Kolkata a couple of times. Starting off with its decor and ambience which is decent. It's pretty vast. There is an open seating arrangement also. The food is not that amazing. I've tried pizzas which were dry. I've also tried their Thai curry which is decent. Nachos was extremely good once and bad the other time. Their dragon rolls which are cheese cigars is outstanding. 

Their sangrias (red wine) are alright. I really liked this not so vanilla drink. That's a must try.

What I like about this place is the ambience , music  and it's minimalist setting. 
The bar menu is not at all expansive and the food menu is not that good. If you're alright with finger food, fried appetizers, junks then you won't complaint.  It's a mediocre place but with good ambience that's why I am giving 3.5 stars. 
Ordered Thai green curry Chicken with steamed rice and it tasted shit .

One of the newest and, for sure, the nicest places to be in after the sun goes down. The ventilated seating paired with the pub inside add its own taste of uniqueness. Early evenings are not much fun here as the tempo gets going around 9pm. The menu is ample and delicious, although the numbers ahead of the names might feel a little over the roof. All in all a great place to be in.

My experience at Monkey Bar left me a little confused, was it a club trying to be a restaurant and bar or vice versa? I think they still need to find their identity. Though I must say the DJ between the 90's boy band songs and teeny bopper music refrained from dropping Bollywood bangers, coudos to him for this. It would have been better if the volume was a little lower so we could actually hear one another and the base levels were not pumped every now and then. The outdoor space they have, mainly for smokers and sheesha  puffers has a great view of the city, especially at night. The flaming bottle juggler clears the floor every now and then and entertains people as well as creates selfy moments which I'm sure many cherish #selfistan. The service I must say is good, especially for a Saturday night when I went. They handled orders really well. The menu is a little all over the place but the pork there is tender and juicy and they have a plethora of veg dishes too. Pizzas here are also good. All in all it was an ok experience and one can only wait and see where they go next as one of the additions to Kolkata's bar and restaurant scene or should I say club?

Classy ambiance. Soft music. Amazing view. Good cocktails and innovative but not over the top food.
The seating could be a bit optimized as everyone does not get the same view, therefore the high tables should be arranged in a better way.

Cocktails : Mangaa is very popular and is actually decent enough.
Hipster Smash : OK

Food : Prawn PIL PIL left me drooling. Very interesting mix of spices. indeed. Must have.

Just woke up from my food coma and decided to review what put me there in the first place! Good music ! Excellent decor and the views are to die for. I don't live in Kolkata any more and was visiting for a few days , but to be in an open air section , listen to classic anthems , with a cold beer and a view of  the VM , the cathedral ,the race course and Vidya Sagar Seth in the same frame is something special and nostalgic. And as if that wasn't enough , then comes the food.... we ordered the kimchi baby potatoes, and the Korean wings for starters....! And for the mains we ordered the Goan pork with paos, the mobar pork and the mobar laksa....Slow clap guys.... slow clap!!!you nailed it with the taste , quality, quantity and authenticity! Avantika I don't know if you'll read this but you have an amazing place ,please keep up the good work! Your staff are amazing too, prompt but not hovering , eager to ask for feedback and big smiles!! Like the one I had on my face before I passed out with all that food!

This joint would score 5 on 5 in terms of ambiance and decor .. in terms of drinks it's pretty pleasant but when it comes to food it's not that great .. we opted for chicken chimchuri kebab and chicken butterfly starters the latter was good but the former was pretty hard and had a peculiar taste .. though the service was pleasant but my expectations was not fully met..

One of my favourite places in this city. The ambience is absolutely awesome - outstanding views of the victoria memorial and st pauls cathedral from the venue. I personally enjoy the cocktails the most in this place especially the pack a punch. The way they serve jaeger bombs is very interesting - must try them! The resident DJ is always full of life and plays some really good music. For the non alcoholics, the ginger beer is amazing - very refreshing! 
Must try the mee goreng, the recently introduced tocos on the menu is MOUTHWATERING! Amongst other food items my personal favourites are the pot stickers, baked brie, paneer bhurji buns and not to forget the saag kebab! Every cafe serves the usual pizza and pasta which is also very good here but i'd suggest you to try the stuff i mentioned previously. Great service, great ambience, great music! I love this place. Good job guys! You are a breath of fresh airbin this city!

On my list for a long time after going through the amazing reviews,  this place did live upto the expectations totally. The ambience is excellent,  with lovely views of the city through its windows. The decor.... an essential  for any standard place these days... is impressive. The service is prompt, the service providers are on their toes all the time as regards the needs of the guests . Coming  to the food.... we ordered Keema Ghotala,  Butterfly Chicken, Mobar Caramelised Ribs and Chicken Chimichurri. The presentation of every dish was excellent. They did stand out in the flavours and taste departments too. This place is certainly one of the best of its kind in Kolkata, a must visit for people looking forward to having a good time.

The location is very good and the ambience as well. We ordered Devilled Fish as recommended. The fish was supposed to be boneless. But it had bones which was a shocker. This shows the negligence of the people managing the kitchen work. We had ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was good. But the Smoked Chicken pizza was highly disappointing. It was dry. The crust was so hard that it almost cut my lips. Since it's a gastro pub it is highly recommended to increase the standard of the food served. Not at all happy to burn a hole in my pocket and get such a poor experience in return.

Located in fort Knox building in Camac Street opposite urban desi in 9th floor. They have a separate sitting place for smokers.
Plus Point:
Victoria memorial view gives it a feel of exclusivity.
They do have 'different' plates.
Different kind of sitting place for all kind of groups.
Kolkata inspired mocktails menu- Tried 'pack a punch', it tasted good. Mojito seemed lighter.
Pizza was great
Attendants - so you can ask any of the attendant, rather than looking for the guy who served you earlier. Makes it a lot easier. Attendants speaks less and doesn't trouble you much.
Music was good but at time they did play really old songs (Shakira-Shakira)
Big screen for enjoying sports
Suggestion-
Would have been better if the bar area was in the middle with chairs all around rather than tucked in the corner.
Pocket Pinch - Rs 1300+ for two drinks and a pizza

This was in my bucket list for a long time. The place is a little hard to find in Camac Street but if you keep a sharp eye, you will see the sign. Monkey Bar offers you a chance to seat inside their ac restaurant or you can seat at the open rooftop restaurant. Both comes with a view of central Kolkata which is quite amazing.  Now coming to the food, we had Tiger beef, Devil Fish and Chicken Chimichuri with beers and a chocolate shake. The beef was extremely well cooked and the dish was deliciously well prepared. The fish was amazing too, coming from a guy who hates fish. The chicken had nothing special about it. Felt like normal kebabs only. Overall, the food was amazing. Will surely be visiting again for the other beef dishes.

I have to say. This is one of the best ambiences I have seen in Kolkata. Combine that with good food and awesome crowd and you have one experience which you will want to have again.

Occasion: Birthday celebration of a friend. 
Things ordered: VEG- Chilli Cheese Dragons, Saag Kebab, Spinach and feta cheese pizza, Paneer 65 
NON-VEG: some fish and some prawn dish. I am a Vegetarian so didn't pay much attention to this department. But the food was good is what I have heard from my friends. 
About the veg menu- Extremely different dishes you will find here. You won't feel that as a Vegetarian you have limited choices. The starters were too good. The saag kebab was something different and gave a new taste altogether. Chilli cheese dragons- lots of gooey cheese coming out of a spring roll covering. My liking. 
Pizza is love for me. I can have any type of pizza. And this one had feta cheese which is sour in taste. But the overall combination was delectable. 
Paneer 65 surprisingly came with Idli and chutney. Wierd combination and not so good taste of the dish. Can be missed. 

In the drinks department, there was a glitch. The cocktails didn't seem to have alcohol at all and we had to tell them to make the drinks stronger. Even the home made ginger beer, a non alcoholic drink had no taste of ginger. But they rectified it nonetheless. 

The best part- The Dessert. Mobar sundae sandwich is one of the best desserts I have eaten without doubt. Filled with cake and ice cream in a sandwich form, the taste is out of the world. 
Go and visit here for ambiance. Drinks might disappoint you but you will surely come out smiling.

Went here with office colleagues on a midweek night. Decently crowded considering it was a midweek. Good crowd, good music. The terrace sitting is excellent and gives one a view of the iconic Victoria Memorial and the illuminated Maa flyover.

Loved the Chicken 65 here, done in true mallu style, complete with 2 idlis. The devilled fish was good too. A friend ordered veg spring rolls which I didn't taste but she didn't seem displeased with it!

Stuck to my usual rum+coke drink so not sure about the cocktails here, but they sure have a long list.

Overall, decent visit, would surely go back.

The view of St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, Victoria Memorial is breathe taking. The panoramic view of its neighbours just adds to the delight of sight. But you can rarely find this part of the restaurant empty. We took the space with a couch and a few seats (more of a friends couch kinda setup). In those cozy chairs the delicacies and the drinks made our experience all the more happening. We ordered Butterfly wings (my friends ordered it twice though I didn‚Äôt fancy it much- moreover you get only three pieces per plate so order accordingly), chicken wings (i loved it!), chicken chimchuri is another must try, Devilled fish which wasn‚Äôt pleasing- we kinda found it raw and lots and lots of drinks.

For all the adventure freaks Mama‚Äôs girl is a must try: vodka based with chilli and pomegranates at the bottom- every sip was a blast in the mouth.
Manga- if you are a person that loves aam panna this is a must have. Awesomeness overloaded.
Mad Men: This is an overdose- whiskey with caffeine. This would really make you a monkey in the bar.
Pack on ¬†punch: the regular Rum Punch. The apple strips were so tasty I literally made sure to eat em from the drinks :P
And a few shots of Whiskey and Vodka.

This bar is definitely for the people who want to have some fun time. We had an awesome night. ¬†A special thanks to the crew who served us and put up with our menace- dancing and continuos ordering. You were really sweet and made us feel home.

IMPROVEMENTS: We really wish you have beer pitchers. Draught beer and more customisations on the menu. An improved lighting. The place where we sat was too dim. The lighting in the rest of the restaurant was good enough but our spot was in darkness :( .

The ambience: Probably one of the best in Kolkata. You have a clear view of Victoria, the 42 and some more breath-takers with a beer in your hand. Aha! 
The music: Cool. The house DJ is a Poets of the fall fan- just to give an idea what kinda music you should expect.
Parking: Paid and safe.

Housed on 9th floor, this restaurant gives you a panoramic view of Victoria memorial, St. Paul's Cathedral and surrounding. I visited this gastro-pub on a weekend evening ... place was almost buzzing with young vibrant crowd! They have got an open-air seating arrangement as well. The interior decor is quite cool and cozy! Dimly lit ambience is perfect for a dinner date.

Talking food... they have come up with their unique choice of dishes, most of which are fusion items. It seems they have done quite a bit of research and experiments before coming up with these large range of unconventional dishes. The presentation is amazing!

In appetizers we tried,
#Chicken chimichurri : succulent & tender pieces of grilled chicken braised with some sweet & sour flavoured sauce
#Mushroom galouti kebab : galouti kebab made out of mashed button mushroom, gonna melt down inside your mouth
#Butterfly chicken : tiny pieces of chicken cooked with herbs in sweet & sour sauce, served inside a shell, giving a formation of butterfly
In main, we ordered for
#Aunty Vinnie's berry pulao : pulao cooked with shredded chicken in gravy and berry... served with minced chicken fried balls and salaan
To complete dinner on a sweeter note, we counted on
#Molten chocolate in shell: literally molten chocolate in hard chocolate shell served with mint ice-cream
In the cocktail section as well, they have their own variety of poisons to offer! I had tried #Copper monkey : a cocktail in true sense as it contains whisky, rum... interestingly served in a copper container.

Pricing is moderately high. Staffs are quite courteous. Most importantly the waiting time between order placing and delivery on table is almost negligible.

I want to visit the place in daylight to get a glimpse of the surrounding and soak myself in the sunlight coming through the huge glass window pane, while enjoying the exotic foods and cocktails!

Visited this joint on Saraswati Puja. Liked this place through and through. The ambiance the lighting the seating arrangement everything appealed to me. The music selection over here is very good. Took me down the memory lane. The table arrangements were very quirky and innovative. The food was nicely cooked and the options here were very innovative although not many options are there to choose from. The drinks are a little bit overpriced. We had a cheese corn nuggets, berry pulao infused with chicken. They tasted very nice. Besides they have a large screen where one can catch sports also. Altogether it was a good visit and I would highly recommend this one.

Love everything about this place. The food, the music, the ambience. The best part about this place is that they divide the section between smokers and non-smokers; So no one is left unhappy. 

An amazing variety of cocktails and mocktails to choose from. The hummus that's served in the mezze platter here is the one of the best that I have had so far. Would love to go back every week. Highly recommended. 

P.S. Drop in to Monkey Bar on Tuesdays for some Karaoke fun with your friends!

Food :- too delicious, with dishes named creatively on the menu card. You shall find some good variety of mocktails unlike most other bars in Kolkata. Pricing is on the higher side. But never mind , they give you value for money and this also ensures the kind of people visiting the place have deep pockets!!!

The Restaurant, I would say has one of the best decorated interior in Kolkata. Situated on the 9th floor you have a nice view of the town. They play good music which can turn you on. Now on the drinks, they have many cocktail variety. I ordered Mangaa with Absolute which was amazing. I was not quite happy with the food. I ordered butterfly chicken, and Tiger Beef. Butterfly chicken was fine but quantity wise it was very less and a tag over price. Tiger Beef was very very spicy and was difficult to consume. 
My suggestion is to visit this place for superb ambience and for some cocktails.

With a nice ambiance and its rustic look this place offers a beautiful view of the city from the 9th Floor. Had visited with a group of friends and the super courteous crew along with the tasty cocktails and good food makes it a great place to chill out. Among the various things we ordered, the Galaouti killer, Mobar calamarized porks and the chocolate pot de creme with salted caramel deserves special mention. The pork ribs surely stands out of the rest for the super succulent texture and the rich barbecue sauce. ¬†Will surely visit again sometime soon.

Monkey Bar is the new attraction for the city.  
The best part is the window  from the 9th floor which shows the beauty of calcutta. 
The decor is breathtaking.  

The menu is innovative.  
The butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy together. The combination was wonderful.  It was equally appealing.  

Yes, the place is slightly overpriced, but comparatively the Ambience and the food us worth the visit. 
Service was good and happy.

Being quite a large group of people we got to try quite a few things of the menu.

We mostly splurge on the starters...unfortunately I don't remeber all the names so vague descriptions of the food are gonna have to be it for this review (was in a food comma). the order was the devil fish, a kimchi beef, achari chicken,  a Japanese style crispy baby corn, a bbq style pork rib @and some chicken botti kebabs.

All the food was quite nice, nothing exceptional but good. beware the devil fish though! That stuff will burn you! And if ur feeling a lil adventurous try their bhoot jalokia hot sauce.

The mains orders were the mushroom and truffle oil pizza the buffalo mozzarella pizza and hamburger and Mr. Chandraji (I think) mutton curry. The mutton was good (so I was told) and the same goes for the burger. The pizza though I didn't enjoy too much; the Base didn't seem too fresh and it was far too crispy due to the lack of sauce.

I did enjoy my drink though...the "healthy" banana nuttella smoothy was gone in one sip!

The service was good and the ambiance was also great.

It was a nice outing overall and it's a definite must visit atleast to sip on the banana nuttella smoothing and watch the kolkatta city scape

First time I went to monkey bar,  it was at our monthly foodie meet,  but I chose to eat a la carte by choice.  I had tried the chimichurri  chicken and the beetroot salad.  

The chicken  was to die for.  Soft,  succulent,  and beautifully  seasoned .  Two skewers made a generos portion.  The beetroot and orange salad was delicious  too.  

On my second visit,  I decided to go during the day,  since I wanted to enjoy the much talked about view.  Thankfully  it was a dry day,  and the place was empty.  We enjoyed good service and had delicious  food.  

I ordered the sticky Korean wings.  Although  there was nothing Korean about them,  but they did taste delicious .  

The pepper calamari was tag oily but delicious .  I guess the tempura batter wasn't chilled when it went into the oil.  

The laksa was absolutely  gorgeous !  We ate one...  And even packed another one.  The balance of the broth was beautiful .  Tad thicker than I like, but really yummy. 

I have decided,  I'm going to monkey bar every dry day.  Stunning view,  and beautiful  food.  The staff was very warm and served well.  

Cheers!

The moment you step onto the open area of this place, you are bound to be awestruck by the city line. Victoria and howrah bridge stand out while the rest of the city gleams beside them in the wintry afternoon. An added bonus is the live music. The decor inside is decent and nothing overwhelming. We ordered  smoked chicken salami harissa pizza, laal maas phulka tacos, and chicken chimichurri. The tacos were a nice  twist but I loved the chicken .As for drinks, we opted for mad men and old-fashioned on camac. We finished off with old monkey chocolate cake and ghondoraj lime tart. The tart had a nice twist. However, one cannot ignore the good old chocolate cake, the perfect ending for any meal. Overall, I would heartily recommend this place if you are looking for a peaceful time to gorge and gossip with your friends.

The best part about Monkey Bar is they haven't tried too hard to impress. As soon as you enter this place there is this certain breezy and refreshing energy all around. A lazy weekend afternoon and this place was filled with people and some lovely live music by talented duo. Started off with the butterfly Chicken which was as lovely as the name is, crispy spicy with the right amount of honey! In the drinks the Mojito was quite nice, but I found the Virgin manga unnecessarily overpriced for being aaam panna. In the mains we went for the Mobar pork, which was spicy pork belly with veggies and noodles. Though the dish was quite filling and delicious, but as far as pork belly is concerned I have had Better. But I loved the grilled bhetki with mashed potato and fried mushroom. Absolutely delicious. Ended the meal with their famous Snicker Bar (Which is a bliss for peanut butter lovers like me) and the Molten Lava Cake with mint icecream, which was average given the chocolate the cake was filled with was too light for my liking. Overall Monkey bar is surely trending in terms of their service, food and ambience and the buzz is worth for real.

Really well done place,they have not done too much to it and have let the space breathe with some decor here and there. I went a wintery late afternoon on a Sunday and there was a light vocal duo playing which was pretty good. Took the outside seating which has a pretty incredible view too

What I had:

:Kheema Ghotala - pretty good though I have had better. The dish went cold real quick so didn't enjoy it after few bites

:Mushroom and Truffle Oil Pizza - beautifully made. Loved how they loaded it with mushrooms.

:had some momo dish which was average

-Chilli Cheese Dragons : super bar food. Beautifully cheesy and brilliantly fried

-Baked Brie : looked promising on the menu but was below average

-Butterfly Chicken : This was my favorite dish in the Bangalore outlet but was very bad in here. Soggy Butterfly crust and the stuffing was tasteless and oily.

-Loaded Nachos : it is what it says

To Drink:

:Whiskey Sour - I asked them to make it with Jameson and it was amazing.

:Mojito Pitchers - very well made. 

Service was excellent and I wouldn't mind going over and over again

The first gastropub chain of the country spreads its branch to Calcutta, and that‚Äôs reason enough for me to hop in happiness. For the uninitiated, Gastropubs are places where the focus is equally on food and on the drinks, unlike regular restaurants which focus on food and serve some drinks too or like pubs primarily serving drinks with some food to nibble on. So basically it‚Äôs my kind of a place, to get the best of both worldsüòç.

The rainy Friday evening when I went to Monkey Bar, Kolkata on an invitation from Communications 2.0, was the perfect weather to gulp down a few cocktails with a room full of friends and known faces. Of the cocktails, the Mangaa with the right punch of Vodka and Aam Panna, was an instant hit at my table. Me however, not being an ardent Aam Panna fan, tilted more towards the Pack-a-Punch. It was the perfect concoction of rum and brandy, with apple and aromatics like thyme and cinnamon.

Another favourite was the basil infused, gin based Toast to Calcutta, with a generous dash of gondhoraj cordial.

Moving on to the food now, it was remarkable to see such a well-designed menu where even a number of vegetarian options succeeded to get me amply enticed. One was the Kerala Red Rice Salad with baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka), and it might be a great option for healthy-eaters.

I have a special place for brie in my heart, so the Baked Brie with Caramelised Onions & Marmalade, stuffed in puff pastry and served with a fruit compote, chilli oil & basil was my absolute favourite thing that night, without a doubt.

The menu includes some local delights tweaked the money way, like the Tikki of Joy which is basically Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. But the hero of the meaty plates for me was definitely the Tiger Beef. The slivers of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers, was a sheer joy for my tastebuds. The hit of chilli and the zing of ginger, accentuated with the tang of lemon with the meat as tender as in dreams, will surely be a party in your mouth!

And just when I thought things couldn‚Äôt get any better, came in the Butter Chicken Khichdi. The creamy mung daal khichdi with butter chicken folded in, served with Ghee, Papad, Dahi, Salad & Achaar is the ultimate comfort food and will be my personal recommendation to anyone who would bother to ask.

As the conversations and cocktails kept flowing mellifluously, came the sweetest bits of the evening at our tables. The desserts here were magical for me. The Gondhoraj Lime Tart, with its perfect tart shell filled with the glistening lime curd, and finished with torches meringue, was happiness on a plate.

Having said that, the Snicker Bar, was no less. The milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel was an elegant embodiment of the snicker bar, and a must have for all caramel freaks.
                                          ...

Monkey Bar has a great view of the city, good food, and fun activities, with a huge screen on one side which can distract me plenty. On a recent visit, quite liked their Tikki Of Joy, with rather flaky bhetki fillet coated and deep fried, as well as the Laal Maas Tacos, which is one of their signature dishes, and a dish I actually quite love. The Kheema Ghotala was nice, but my friend was slightly iffy about the cracked egg over the kheema which wasn't really hot, and so, like it was supposed to, didn't really cook the egg much. In drinks, I loved my glass of Tipsy Sherbet, while my friend was quite happy with her Toast to Calcutta, while we both had mixed feelings for the Mad Men - far too strange for our liking.

The food and drinks menu are innovative enough to make me wonder which one to have first!
I think I am soon to be a patron of this place.
Left a point for seeing what future holds for this place.
Only suggestion: Can u pls pls launch an offer on drinks to enable ppl like me to frequent this place more often????

Firstly, the d√©cor here is incredible. It's located on the 9th floor and the view is breathtaking. Moreover, the vibes are really good and the entire layout is very well done. 
The food champions the d√©cor as it's probably the best I've had. The food is Indian fusion and it's outstanding. It's well presented, and the service is great. (Try the butter chicken khichri and tiger beef)
All in all, I'd definitely revisit here multiple times because the food and the view combined make for a really great experience.

This place is located centrally in Fort Knox Building at Camac Street. It's bang opposite to Urban Desi. 

This place has quite a classy atmosphere and crowd. We went there during afternoon and the place was full. We sat in open air space. The overall decor of the place is pretty good! 

We had Loaded Nachos and Pizza which tasted good along with a few drinks! This place is a bit pricey. If you come here, you need to make up your mind that you are paying for the ambience rather than the food and drinks! It was 3 of us and the bill was for 3K. 

Looking forward to more such places in Kolkata!

In a nutshell - Great view & ambiance, great food, albeit not all dishes...and good shakes, albeit not all shakes.

First of all, we ended up here on a Thursday night when they have their Bar closed due to having a temporary license (or so I was told). Nonetheless, we decided to try this one as it is we weren't in the mood for drinks and we had read good reviews on Zomato and this place was also recommended by friends. 

This place has a good ambiance! Dimly lit and well decorated for a fine dine experience. They have an outdoor seating as well for hookah as well as smoking area - and it was a little cold here it being winters...but I personally liked the outdoor seating better...it has a much better view of the city. Outdoor they also have a huge projector screen where they played a couple of black and white ballroom dancing videos on repeat. Music was classic - loved it! All in all a good setting for a romantic or fine-dine evening!

I can't comment much on service since the place was pretty much empty therefore allowing us their undivided attention. Still, the staff was nice and the service was quick. They even offered to exchange the dish we didn't like which was really nice of them!

And now coming to the most important part - Food. We ordered Prawn Pil Pil, Rock Corn Tempura, Chilli Cheese Dragons and Saag Kebabs along with Monkeccino, Banana Nutella Shake and Brownie Cookie Shake.
Prawn Pil Pil - though I didn't have it, my friend who tried all the dishes proclaimed it to be the best dish of them all, by a margin! So I'd say you should definitely this one out! It is served with crispy garlic bread 
Chilli Cheese Dragons - they were fantastic! Melting cheese in your mouth with a gentle taste of green chilli and capsicum...this was my favorite dish for the evening! A must try I'd say!
Saag Kebab - this one was suggested to us by the serving staff and it turned out to be quite well! Tasted like the traditional hara bhara kebab, only better! It was covered with papad and served with salad and salsa sauce. In kebabs, definitely try this.
Rock Corn Tempura - this was the disappointing dish. It tasted like oil. And nothing else. They explained us how it is prepared and why it might taste of oil to us and even offered to exchange this dish. I wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone.
Food quantity was good for its price.
Shakes - Brownie Cookie shake is a must try!! Perfect blend of chocolate, brownie and cookie..thick and with each sip I could taste the brownie in it...this one was perfect! Banana Nutella shake was more biased towards Banana. And the Monkeccino, which was supposed to have mint flavor, completely lack mint flavor. Also, all shakes were served in the same kind of glass. They could improve with the presentation of shakes!

Overall, I loved this place for its awesome food! Would like to try out its cocktails some time soon...I'd certainly recommend this place to a friend. :)

If you are ready to spend a chunk of your salary on the very first day of the year,what could be a better place than this lounge. üòã The ambience lifts up the mood pretty well. We ordered some cocktails- copper monkey, mad men,sangria and a peg of 100 piper's. Sangria was the best of the lot. In sides,we had loaded nachos and Shammi Sliders. Nachos was well decorated and very very spicy. Shammi Sliders- the burgers were not up to the mark. Hope to have some great food on the next visit.

A review for this place has to begin with a  comment on the location of the place... Situatedvwhere Venom was long long time ago this place gives you the best view of the city.. sitting on a bar stool sipping your manga (signature drink) and looking out at the preciously lit Victoria..Ambience and the location just does the trick for this place... 
Food is unbelievable..Even a simple nachos is served so amazingly... The staff is good as well...
The drinks are all very good but I will agree with some of the reviewers the place is on the higher end and charge a good amount for the cocktails/alcohols.
But this place is a must visit...

Monkey bar located at 9th floor of Fort Knox building just opp. to Urban Desi. 

Food: I would say food here was tasty and quantity was also it was nice. The price for the food price was comparatively okay when you compare with other high end lounges. The price for drinks was bit high when you see you don't get any happy hours and also the Beamer LIIT we opted was very light hardly any alcohol quantity. Apart from that we opted for beers like hogarden, leffe & kingfisher. We took one reddys popcorn chicken which was spicy tangy tasty. Akso we opted for smoked chicken harissa pizza which was perfect for 2-3 person and was yummy.We took one hookah which costs 550 and it was the worst hookah I tasted lately. Hookah given was small with small base. It hardly gave dense smoke and started choking within few mins.

Only thing that's worst and could make you regret visiting this place is their taxes. We paid 50% amount of the actual bill in taxes. Our total bill excluding tax was 4250 and after tax it was 6046.

Service: Service was okay! Waiters were constantly naging us earlier to give some more order in drinks when it was vacant. Also, the food we ordered they tried to convince us for so long not to opt for that one even after we asked them to bring that only. Service was very slow later on and had to look out for them for mins to give next order.

Ambiance: Ambiance is something which is too die for. I would say this place looks stunning during the night and view outside is something to watch for. They have sperate section if you want to smoke and have hookah and that's nice. Even the view from the loo is stunning it will make you feel to stay their for some more timeüòÇ. Place is perfect for date but be ready to burn hole on the pocket.


Conclusion: Go if you are ready to pay the huge tax they ask for. I hope they check on the huge they ask for. Their are other lounges too who don't charge so much in tax and even if they charge they provide happy hours.

My friend and I went on Christmas Eve to Monkey Bar
There was a cover charge of 1000 bucks per person, redeemable at the restaurant. We ordered for a red wine sangria pitcher which was priced after tax 2600 and a teenie plate of appetizer. The drink tasted more of cranberry juice than alcohol and upon pointing that out at the bar, the bartender just poured in bacardi white rum into it. The place was crowded but with good music. Sadly, drinks were not up to the mark and wouldn't wanna come back here!

Classy & elegant!

We went on a weekday night at 9, had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table! Untill then we could stand at the bar and have fun! The place is big, has a very modern and classy decor, dim lighting.they have wooden furniture and high tables & chairs on both the flanks! There's a dance floor in front of the turntable, but it's very small, and don't think it's meant for dancing. The oper air portion is meant for smoking and hookah. It also has a projector screen which had BW cartoon videos adding to a psychedelic effect. Brilliant to go with alcohol! The place has a view to the Maidan Skyline with Victoria Memorial amidst it, offering quite a spectacular view! The music is great, I mean the best I've come across in the city!

The food was amazing, we ordered Rock corn tempura. It was different. They were crisp, tossed in a tangy sauce with roasted sesame to offer a brilliant bite and also had tempura morsels. Next came the Sticky Korean chicken wings. It were fried, and they said it was sauted in Gochuajang sauce. It too had sesame and chili honey coating, served with garlic mayo & tangy yougurtish dips, brilliant combination! 
The last was the Mac & cheese croquettes! Oh dear, what amazing, they had Mac & cheese inside the croquettes with a jalapeno strip on it, tasted too good to describe! 

The price is definitely on the stripper side with alcohol, but only food should serve your tastebuds really well! 
Will definitely recommend a friend & a must visit!

The ambience is great too and the service is quick! The cocktail Sangria which we ordrered was delicious and we ordered another round! We had hot wings, calamari and snicker bar. Everything was  very delicious.However I expected the place to be more happening! Maybe it's because we visited during the daytime.

The place is beautifully done but the staff really needs to work on its skills. Monkey bar has the sluggishest and the most callous staff, I have ever seen. They do not seem keen on entertaining customers and are engrossed in their own world, seem clueless, when it comes to getting people seated (we went in a group of 3 and were allocated a 10seater, despite the 3 seaters by the windows being empty), do not know to process cards, take away plates even while somebody is yet to eat (what kind of restaurant staff does that?) and exude an overall negative vibe. They need to be trained, otherwise it's like a good experience ruined!

Visited Monkey Bar again after about 5 months and yet again had a great experience. I ordered Chandra Ji's Mutton Curry again this time as well, albeit with some apprehension. It would have been tragic if it didn't  taste as well this time. But am happy that MB did not disappoint. Kudos to the chef. The mutton curry has all the ingredients of a soul food, yet has an elegance / sophistication of a very high standards. Tender pieces, perfectly cooked, nothing overdone, just right with a hint of basil. Served with some wonderful light pulao, non greasy with some  fried onions. MB - please do keep up the high standards.

Great food and drinks. Had a drink called Hot Toddy which was rather nice, especially if you have a sore throat and would want to avoid cold drinks. It has cinnamon and star anise and very unique. The live music was quite good. Will visit again.

Long glass ceilings and outdoor seating facility makes this place a great venue to relax and chill. However there are no happy hours, so the prices are a bit steep. The food is well priced and delicious. The cocktails are amazing with fresh fruits .they don't take reservations. However happy hours should seriously have been there.

The feel of the place is very cosmopolitan..the view is great..the whole ambience on Christmas Eve was warm and alive. However, the music is a big downside - one can hardly hear the person sitting beside. Moreover, the service is a bit slow - made us late. Our visit was had both positive and negative impact on us. When we entered the place we issued a receipt for 7 people of 7000 total. They told us it's redeemable. However, after finishing our dinner, the bill came upto ‚Çπ4500 approx plus taxes, amounting to ‚Çπ6400 approx. They said we have to make the base amount 7000 as they can't redeem that, and in that 7000 whatever taxes will be added we have to pay that by cash or card. God knows why they said it's redeemable!! We couldn't argue as we were already running late. Thinking its better to pay the taxes instead of incurring a double loss we ordered some more desserts. The 4 points are just for the good food.. although the amount was not sufficient. I was happy to find Leffe on the bar menu. We tried reddy's popcorn chicken and prawn pilpil (which was great!), Nachos (not great :/), chicken chimichurri (so-so). In the main course we had pizzas - baja chicken and smoked chicken (quite good)..for desserts we had mobar sandwich, molten chocolate in shell and Snickers bar..all of them just wonderful!

Had great fun dancing with friends and enjoyed the Christmas Eve.

The chain of Monkey Bars has received a overwhelming response in India. While Delhi chucked out to have the best of sumptuous experiences, Kolkata also did not lie far behind. In fact this recently launched bar in Kolkata is giving all foodies a perfect goal to relish their taste buds. Interiors To Fall For:

If you can ignore the terribly loud music you ll have a great time at the monkey bar. The food is really good and I must recommend the pork ribs . The place is extremely cosmopolitan and serves up a good selection of cocktails too. The view of Victoria is just fabulous from the open windows. However the music here is a huge minus. My friends and I  could hardly hear ourself think and felt relieved when we finally got to leave. Now hopefully that isn't the experience the management wanted for the guests.

The Monkey Bar, located on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac street is one of the relatively new and most talked about gastropubs in Kolkata. The place is done up neatly with wooden textures, British theatre style canopy design and tall windows. And to top it all, the panoramic view of Kolkata with the Victoria memorial and St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, welcomes you the very moment you set foot.

My friend, who was leaving the city soon wanted to go out for food and drinks and what could have been better than our decision to hit the Monkey Bar. Finally opened in Kolkata, one of the best-located bar there possibly is. On the 9th floor of Fort Knox on Camac Street, this looks down the beautiful Kolkata skyline with the 2nd bridge, Victoria, St. Pauls church and what not. The place is huge, quaintly decorated with the essential Bong touch both in the menu and the bar. Has an open area with a huge screen. 
For food we ordered the Mobar Caramelised Pork Ribs. Melt in the mouth pork meat. Smoked Chicken, Chicken Salami and Harissa pizza. For drinks we took the Beamer LIIT. Just the right punch of alcohol and tang! Lovely experience. Would definitely like to go back again.

The place has a chill vibe . Went with a few school buddies.  There is a open air section as well as an indoor section where you can sit and chill . Drinks were nice . Service could be better . The staff were not attentive enough . Lastly the music . There were people singing karaoke. I mean it's cool to sing and all but we expected some chill music with the setting .

After making its mark on Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore, Monkey Bar has finally made its way to Kolkata. Now you know I wanted to add in a cheesy ‚Äúmonkey‚Äù related pun in there but I‚Äôm exhibiting some restraint here for which I think I deserve some credit üòõ . There was a lot of buzz about the place among my foodie friends and I finally got to see why. One of the most prime-ly located joints in recent times (Fort Knox, Camac St.) that has a gorgeous view of the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and even Vidya Sagar Setu (or as it is also know as the New Hoogly Bridge). The gastro-pub has paid tribute to the city with some special menu inclusions apart from what they offer in general‚Ä¶they are known for taking familiar flavors/ingredients and adding a playful twist to them to satisfy both the comfort of the known as well as the need for something new of the diners...

Went yesterday with a business partner, wasn't really very particular about a place but since it was located near by thought of visiting it once. Few observations

1. The ambiance is nice and the interiors are pretty well done.

2. Music is pretty loud and if you are intending to have a prolonged conversation with someone it would be difficult. 

3. The biggest drawback is the food, we ordered two veg starters since my friend was veg. The quantity and the taste wasn't something justifying the price or the brand. The food was OK but it isn't something one will find difficult to prepare in there kitchen. 

Overall experience was okay since we primarily went there to seat and talk. But comparing the same with the likes to cafe mezzuna or the grid would make this place average at the best. Hope the management looks into it.

On the 9th floor at Fort Knox, the newly opened Monkey Bar is a beautiful place to visit. The place offers an unmatched view of the city and the interiors and a class apart which make it one step ahead of other places in the city.
The food on offer is delicious. The mushrooms I ordered and the chilli cheese dragons are a must try for all.
Overall a great new place to visit with a great atmosphere and very polite attendants.

This one is new in Kolkata, and is definitely pulling lot of crowd. I went there on a Friday evening with two of my friends and it was full of people. Located in camac street, near Urban Desi, not too difficult to locate. The moment you step in , the first thing you notice are the big french windows with a view to die for :), Howrah Bridge and Victoria Memorial at the same, who would not love that!¬†
Now coming to the food, its nothing extraordinary, very mediocre tasting with prices on the higher side. We ordered for 1 mix mushroom bruschetta, mushroom and truffle oil pizza, and tikki of joy (fish). The bruschetta and the pizza was very ordinary, bland in taste I would say. Tikki of joy was definitely good with very subtle flavours, perfectly cooked to perfection.
My rating is truly for the ambience and the fish, anyway one could always try out this place¬†
Thumbs up for the view :)

My visit to this place raised my bar of expectations from kolkatas nightlife.. Posh crowd, sophisticated ambience, soothing music, projector screen for matches, good food and superb hukka! The place has it all. We ordered for lebanese platter and cheese spring rolls, both finger licking good! The capuccino cofee was average but the hukka made up for it! A must visit for all the crazy kolkatans looking for a break from chai break!

Monkeying around in Monkey Bar ‚Äì Kolkata

On a lazy Sunday afternoon me and my friend were walking around Camac street when we happened to see a board for Monkey Bar near the Fort Knox building. I instantly knew Monkey Bar is finally in Kolkata. I had been a great fan of Monkey Bar during my days in Delhi and couldn‚Äôt wait to get in there.

The restaurant is located on the 9th Floor of the Fort Knox building, The building has a very tiny lift that took me to the 9th floor and a big entry door to the Bar awaited us there. The moment I entered it was such a relief to see high ceilings and a huge sitting area unlike the tiny lift that took us up to the building.

The Space: The place is divided into 3 sections as such, one with high tables with a stunning view of the Victoria Memorial on a clear day. The other side is the normal table of 4s and 2s. And the more beautiful section is the outdoor seating section, it ought to be the best place to sit on a lovely winter afternoon. I loved how high the ceiling and the space is and how airy the entire place felt so high above.

Food and Drinks: Now coming to the main part the food and drinks, I was pretty impressed by the Kolkata touch in the menu, drinks like ‚ÄòToast to Kolkata‚Äô & the very hilariously named ‚ÄòTrump card‚Äô really got me amused. Although I tried Mama‚Äôs Girl and Curry Martini,  I must say both were equally refreshing with the right amount of alcohol. They of course have the usual beer, rum, whisky as well but I was too tempted to try the new cocktails.

About the food now, just like the drinks, the food menu is very tempting too. I was so happy to see the variety of cuisines like Mediterranean, continental, of course Indian served with their own take added to it. I opted for the Med platter, a lip-smacking wholesome meal, their signature Futterfly, mushroom bruschetta and liver on toast. Does not just the sound of it water your mouth!

Watch-out for: I know that I have already said a lot of good things about the place (which they deserve), although a couple of things that did not please me much were, as the evening grew and more and more people started dropping by, the music decibel started going higher and higher, to the point where I was almost screaming to be able to chat with my friend. I should add though that when requested the staff did turn down the volume a tad bit, so that helps.

Pocket Pinch: I have to admit the hit on the pocket is on an expensive side. A meal for a couple with drinks would cost something around Rs 2000 plus.

All in all I think this place is one of those that the city had been waiting for a long time. And what more could we want than a lovely evening over looking the Victoria with amazing drinks and delicious food.

The ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô Kolkata Avatar is a welcome addition to it's watering hole map and what an experience it metes out! Located in the heart of the city (Camac Street) with a huge and lofty space, it exudes a comfort zone feel. The visual delight of the interior space couples well with a spectacular view of the Kolkata skyline from the restaurant.¬†

The cream de la cr√®me among the restaurant‚Äôs USP's is the outdoor seating arrangement of about 5-6 tables. Although open to air, yet it is air-conditioned to beat the muggier months. Incidentally during the clement months it would be a pronounced experience to soak in Kolkata‚Äôs mild winters. The corner verandah serves hookah for the y-generation and for those who love to smoke with their tipple it is a rather comfortable space. I loved the incipient November chill all through the evening in the outdoor! It would be an idyllic place all through the wintery months to soak in the chilled weather.

Though I am not a cocktail loving person, I ventured out to try some of their swinging concoctions. First shot was the famed Manga.

Sweet and Tangy Vodka based cocktail, it had an all desi flavour burst from the Aam Panna as the main base with its signature cumin flavour to follow. It comes in a kullar shaped glass with etched in a typical Hinglish font that sets the tone for a fusion evening. 
Next, was the more stylized ‚ÄòMad Men‚Äô a Bourbon base with Coffee Orange and a whiff of Rosemary spray, which, I really liked and got myself a double dose.

 
 

Getting headier, I tried out the Copper Monkey, lo and behold but predictably it was in a copper mug. I quite liked the passion fruit flavour and the hint of mint in it worked well.

¬†

Although christened as ‚ÄòMonkey Bar‚Äô one would be rather surprised to see a super array of fusion food alongwith some very innovative desi leaning twisters. One look at the menu and I was instantly attracted to the Laal Maas Phulka Tacos, Radish cake bites for its novelty, Mobar Caramelized Pork ribs for its slow cooking and the Butterfly Chicken for the signature shells. 
The Laal Maas in the Phulka Tacos was juicy and well done, served on a ¬†Bao Stand for appeal as well as to function as a 'hold on'.  The meat was unique in flavour and spiced up enough to support its Laal Maas Status! 

 

The radish /mooli cake bites were indeed a experience though one really cannot make out if radish is used as the main filling ingredient unless told. The Tempura batter and the black bean sauce make up for the frunchy bite and flavour of the Radish bites.

 

The caramelized rib was succulent and smokey, living up the 6-hour slow cooked traditional method. So was it's house sauce quite zesty and lip smacking. 

 

The Butterfly Chicken was perhaps the only dish, which I would give the pass, though a visual delight again. I was lead to believe or was expecting a Butter Chicken filling. Maybe that is a good idea too.

Overall this place is not all just ambience, though that feeling is certainly overwhelming and sets up the mood. The service, food and the liquid chemistry in the cocktails are commendable too.

With its French windows giving a glimpse of both the Victoria Memorial as well as the Howrah Bridge, the ambient lighting, great music, brick walls, a gorgeous skylight, a section that projects black and white motion picture and an apparently messy but ultimately symmetric seating arrangement that will please the OCD in you, Monkey Bar is hands down the best looking place in town. The ambiance, crowd and the location itself (9th floor of the Fort Knox building in Camac Street) itself demands a high rating. But it outdoes itself in the food department as well.¬†

The tiger beef is an instant classic. Perfectly cooked and just the right amount oily, this is a dish that I will highly recommend. The chettinad chicken samosas on the other hand flattered to deceive, definitely not worth the high price. Reddy's chicken popcorn though is a whole different story : small pieces of chicken fried with curry leaves, ¬†sesame, coconut shreds and a concoction of south Indian spices.¬†The name that will pique your interest however is the butter chicken khichudi. Bengali style sticky rice cooked amalgamated with Punjabi style chicken butter masala, this is a dish that has sharp flavors very well attuned for the Indian tongue. I absolutely loved it! 4 small cups containing curd, ghee, pickle and papad are given as accompaniments.¬†
¬†

And just everything else, their dessert section is more than competent too. While the snicker bar with its milk chocolate ganache on a crunchy almond base and a chocolate cake below may feel a tad too sweet, they provide a coffee ice cream to go with it and together the balance is delectable. The gondhoraj lime tart was more in my wheelhouse : the tangy lime curd really stood out. If I have to recommend one among these two I'd say take a leap of faith, ditch the always reliable chocolate and go for the tart.¬†

Here's to next time.

The famous brand is finally here in Kolkata. It's been three months since they opened doors on Camac Street and there's been no looking back for them :)
Had the opportunity to visit the place thanks to a bloggers meet. This is the brain child of chef Manu Chandra, the team, the food is crafted by him. The place epitomizes awesomeness in every inch. The place is big, read huge!! The huge old school windows lead you to stare at the city landscape with wide open eyes. They have an open seating arena, high rise chairs and comfortable sofas to choose from. They serve alcohol and hookah. They even arrange for sundowners on wintry afternoons, for you to sip on their lavish cocktails and enjoy the sun going down. The Victoria Memorial and the Howrah bridge are visual delights. They have their pub rules hence it is better to read them up and visit!
The crafted menu for the afternoon:

**Drinks**

Copper Monkey: Served in a copper vessel with a ¬†chunk of orange came this cocktail, whiskey based.

Manga: The ever famous drink, vodka based, a concoct of vodka and mango pulp.

Hipster Smash: Smacking name, and a refreshing drink! The array of colors are incredible. Mix of watermelon juice, a huge chunk of frozen watermelon and vodka.

Old Fashioned on Camac: The name might sound synonymous with rum but it is a whiskey based cocktail.

**Food**

Kerala Red Rice: A vegetarian and a non-vegetarians' delight! Thick red rice mixed with southern spices. It's spicy, it's crunchy, and it's tangy!!

Tiger Beef: The best, best, best beef is served here!! A bowlful of spicy meaty delight!! The shredded, well cooked, perfectly spiced beef served as the best chakna with the cocktails. Quite filling, good in quantity. Must order and highly recommended.

Butterfly Chicken: The outer coatings are designed like butterflies. Fried to perfection, oil less, the butterfly winged shaped cups are visual delights. Filled inside the cups are shredded chicken mixed in a nice sauce. Recommended for the sheer taste, intensity of the dish, and the efforts behind the perfect butterfly wings!

Shammi Sliders: These little burgers are lovely to look at. They do not fill you up completely yet leave you quite satisfied. The minced meat patties are perfect and there's no saucy drips. You actually do not mess yourself up eating this. Accompanied with some house special fries served inside a cute monkey bar wrapper.

Tikki of Joy: Quite a big hit down south, they decided to include it in their Kolkata menu as well. Huge chunks of bhetki frie to perfection. Served with onion rings and mint chutney. Crispy, ample fish in every mouthful, not oily at all.

Lal Maas Phulka Tacos: even sized parathas half rolled like rolls, filled with minced juicy meat. The meat is tender and you would feel like you are eating a roll, Kolkata style!!

**Desserts**

Gondhoraj Lime Tart: Tad a bit too bitter if eaten without the entire chunk. The idea is take a bit of the biscuit base, the creme, the lemon curd, the pistachio cake, and the raspberry sugared petals. And you could keep eating that and stare into the dreamy wintry sky line. But make sure to get a window seat..:)

Old Monkey Signature Chocolate Cake: What is a chocolate if it does not make you high!!! Well, this one sure does...a huge chunk of chocolate bar sprinkled with praline and caramel sauce. Served with a little scoop of ice cream...aaahhh never felt better!!¬†

Guys, agar aap Monkey Bar nahi gaye to please jaldi jaiye...it's waiting for you!! The coolest place in town to rock and roll. Try their karaoke nights or their usual dining hours, you will not be disappointing!!

The place has excellent ambience and definitely scores well on the food quality. However, the portions are really small adding on to the already heavy cost. Instead of 1500 for 2, its a place where you will incur Rs1500 per person. Plus the taxes are a lot on the pocket. Our regular bill of Rs 4800 had Rs2000 worth of taxes amounting to a total of Rs 6800! Paying 40% tax on top of my bill is not something I was looking forward to.

Pathetic place, the food quantity is so less, waiters don't understand anything, once you order the order only comes when you die hungry. We waited for  bill for almost 14 mins and then left, the waiter came running out to get the bill, and top of that the bill was wrong, they charged us for we didn't order also.

Over priced, lazy, pathetic place. Never visit.

Monkey bar is the newest attraction in town and rightly so, talking about interiors the biggest hit is the huge Windows showing the skyline of Calcutta, it's a breathtaking view from the 9th floor. 

The menu is quite innovative and the concoctions in terms of the cocktails are pretty darn good.

The food doesn't disappoint at all the butterfly chicken was crispy and juicy which is very rare a combination and the pork ribs had a smokey barbecue flavour to them and were very, very soft. 

The place is slightly expensive, but, with that ambience and quality, it's hardly an issue.

Read d reviews on Zomato n planned to pop over to dis place.
The interiors..ambience...music..crowd n d staff is absolutely perfect.
The view is jus mindblowing n d breeze is so soothing.
We ordered Prawn Pil Pil which was yum..
The Beef Pickle and the Pork Sausages were a bit disappointing.
We had two beers and a virgin mojito.
D thing dat was bit disappointing was dat our bill was 2368Rs...out of which 535Rs was jus all kinda tax.
Overall this place is one of d best plc to hangout around.

Six of us landed up at Monkey Bar on a Saturday evening. It was a nightlife hotspot at 19:30 hours already and we had to wait almost 40 minutes before we could be seated. We were ushered in and given the offer of crowding around the bar which we accepted.
The ambiance was great. Music was good and everyone seemed to be having a good time. Making a conversation wasn't the easiest thing to do but at places like this that is quite expected. 
We kicked off the evening with a portion of Loaded Nachos, 4 helpings of Pack a Punch, one Old Fashioned on Camac with bourbon and one Mama's Girl with Absolut. The last two we had to settle for because Toast to Calcutta couldn't me made due to lack of availability of gin. The nachos were appetizing and I liked my old fashioned with bourbon but the accompanying almond biscotti was too sweet for me. The pack a punch was good but the Mama's Girl was not appreciated by any one.
The Aam Admi Eggs went down well with me. It reminded me of the bhel puri walas and their chutneys. The eggs were soft but firm. It made me crave a bit for the soft, gooey and runny yolk. The Hispter Smash was nice but the Tipsy Sherbet was quite interesting for me because I have always wondered how alcohol would blend with rose syrup and Mo Bar did a wonderful job. The Copper Monkey was a bit like a fruity mint julep but I did like it. The Not so Vanilla was not quite my kind of cocktail with the creamy texture so I exchanged that for the Hipster Smash with a friend. The best cocktail according to me was by far the Mad Men. All the flavours combined really well and complimented each other beautifully. Coffee and orange always work well but the subtle rosemary was a delightful addition. 
The duck pita pockets were great. Oriental flavours in between a pita was an unusual combination but the pita seemed to go quite well with the duck in five spice and the hoisin sauce. The Kerala Beef Fry was nice but I would have loved to have it with Malabar parotta instead of the bread they served. The smoked chicken pizza was decent too. 
The service was very good. There was a period in between when we were very unhappy with the excruciatingly slow service but our server was extremely apologetic about it and cited the reason of a busy weekend evening for the barmen. It was understandable as far as I was concerned. The value for money is perhaps a bit on the lower side and I would say Mo Bar is a moderately expensive place. The food was mostly good. The drinks too were mostly very good. And I couldn't get enough of the Mad Men. So I will return for the Mad Men and to try the beef bulgogi, tiger beef, Goan chrizo pav, baked brie and prawn ghee roast. Recommended if one doesn't mind spending a bit.

Food, decor and ambience is top notch. Kolkata has got a Gem restaurant and bar. The view and seating is made for each other.

For the egg lovers-"Aam aadmi eggs. Sheer brilliant dish. Must try if you visit.

The staff needs to be a little polite and polished. Lack hospitality and softness. If they can improve upon this, it will be no doubt the finest joint in the city.

Will surely visit again.

Great food, smooth shisha and pleasant staff at a great location. The food served was fresh and tasty. Though the open area for shisha is a little congested. This is a perfect alternative to bar exchange since the staff is very pleasant. Had an outing with 8 of team mates on October 25, costed 7.5 k excluding alcohol. Will be my preferred location for after work outings as long as the staff is pleasant.

One of the new places opened in Calcutta. This place has a great view of the city with good music. When I say good music, I mean music in the background and you can hear the person sitting opposite to you. The service is spot on. The servers attend to you first and do not chit chat in a corner. Now the food, ordered a farmers pizza which was good enough for an evening snack. The best thing that happened during the evening was the hookah. It was so smooth yet gave the kick. After a very long had really good hookah. The price pinch is moderate too. Would definitely visit more often now.

Since its opening, have been there couple of times already. The evening view of the city is definitely one of the the ups of the place.¬†
The ambience is awesome and the right kind of classy touch interiors makes you want to come n relax with friends.¬†
The mocktails were good, and some dishes mentioning special mention are Chilli Cheese dragons, Med platter, Falafel Sliders and Mobar Laksa.¬†
Thanks Avantika for bringing the Monkey to town. :)

Unluckily I ended up to the place on a Thursday and it was a dry day there, but the food was phenomenal . The moment you see the menu you want to try everything .

We ordered loaded nacho was very good , beet and orange salad which was ok , kimchi baby potatoes is a must try.
For the mains I ordered paneer kichdi which was good and the soulful bowl chilly paneer was good too. 

Going to go again for the non- veg very soon .

The only good part about this place was the ambience and picturesque settings. Food is nothing worth mentioning. The spaghetti pasta was bad. Spring rolls & nachos were okay. Among the drinks, I really liked the Virgin Mangaa.

hi,
Was there for lunch.ambience is very good and the moment I entered it felt like its a lovely place for a winter lazy afternoon date. very clean.As we went in a large group the service was a bit slow.I hope as the restaurant ages it will be sorted out.butter chicken khichdi was good.smoothies and drink were also good.I had tried prawn which was also very tasty.I loved the interior,very classy specially the open area to sit.should try once.

A sensational space with a terrific view of the Calcutta skyline. While it is expensive and the cocktails might not cater to everyone, the food is experimantally delicious while the service is admirable.

Visited this place at Fort Knox building 9th floor- the new outlet to party with friends. Gorgeous interiors and a stellar reputation as a chain we went there with high expectations and we were satisfied.Spectacular view with good music and awsum food. Innovative cocktails , lipsmacking pork and beef dishes.A must try joint.

I think I would rate this place 95% purely for the ambience and the view....the truly quintessential bar and cafe where you can have an awesome conversation at an awesome side table with an awesome view of the metropolis named Kolkata that I am yet to see anywhere in this city....truth be told, I was bedazzled and enamoured by the view....a whole 6/5!!!

Then comes the hard reality....for the few drinks (7), couple of coffee and a few bites, it was almost ‚Çπ4.2k....time to pay for the view!!!!....maybe a tinge more so 3.5/5....but the few hours spent are worth sitting there provided the company / conversation is good....

Nothing to write home about the food taste, just an avg 3.5/5

In the evening they have a good lighting set up and inspite of the crowd, every table and it's occupants had their own space and not intruded upon....it didn't feel cluttered like other such hallmark Kolkatan joints....would have gone for a 4.5/5 but they totally managed to screw that up with thumping music, which could have been easily done through the softer and low volume lounge music!!!...killed the evening ambience....if the idea was to attract the vibrant gen then they missed the fact that there were a whole lot of couples and a few bunch who were engrossed in their own conversation and seemed a bit irritated with the thumping bass....so here's a 3/5 for ruining the awesome layout and view....

If I would ever come again, it would be for the view and the window seats....but guys, do get some class in the music, the environment should provide for individual space, the layout, lighting, setting and ambience are awesome but your music settings are truly questionable, at least this time round!!!

The newest addition to Camac Street, Monkey bar holds the promise of becoming one of the coolest hangouts for GenY. Situated on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building, it offers a panoramic view of the city through huge glass windows and what's more there's even arrangement for outdoor seating. The decor is charming and an awesome background score makes the ambience perfect for chilling out with your friends over great food and drinks. Firstly we ordered a butterfly chicken and duck pita pockets. The chicken was delicious and crispy tossed with bell peppers, chilli flakes and stuffed in crunchy butterfly shells and the duck meat marinated with spices and packed inside soft pita bread created fireworks in our mouths. We also went for a smoked chicken, chicken salami and harissa pizza which was superb, to say the least. There was another Hearty bowl, a heartwarming chicken broth with bean sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, flat noodles and bokchoy sprinkled with chilli oil. We finished off with Mobar Sundae Sandwich, an ice cream cake with nuts layered with nutella and tutti fruti. We also tried their hookah and the shisha is really good and strong. The service is more of less..efficient and the staff polite..but the pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side. They recently acquired their bar license, so would love to drop in again for a taste of their cocktails!

No doubt this place has an amazing ambience with an indoor and outdoor seating area styled in the form of british pub, but food and service is very very poor.¬† We went on ashtami night with friends, they took about an hour to prepare the chicken stacked as saslik to grill it. Once served, the dish was just tasteless.

Hi, if you love Calcutta , good music(and by good music I mean led zeppelin and pink flyod and classics as such ) and a brilliant view of Calcutta, this is the place to be. 

We ordered a pack up punch, Sangria and a 100 pipers based cocktail. All three were pretty different and pretty well made. 

We didn't order any food as we were so engrossed in the decor and view. 

The hospitality was brilliant. 

Do give it a visit.

Already visited twice in such a short span of opening its doors in Kolkata, Monkey Bar has been fabulous on both occasions. Situated on the top floor of Fort Knox, it provides a magnificent view of the Kolkata skyline with Victoria Memorial, St Pauls Cathedral, Hooghly bridge and the 42 which is the tallest building here.

The food has been great and is presented in a unique way. Ordered Chilli Cheese dragons, Mac and cheese croquettes, Butterfly chicken and Chicken Chimichurri on the first time along with Mangaa mocktail. On the repeat, we ordered Mobar caramel ribs, Tiger beef, Reddys popcorn chicken alongwith a Smoked chicken pizza. In drinks, we had copper monkey , house made ginger beer with a couple of KF ultras.

However special mention must go to the desserts, Snicker bar is just too good while Nolen gur creme brulee was delicious.
They have a small open air area for hookah as well. The service is prompt and the ambience is quite relaxing. The bar looks pretty while the music changes over time with comforting tracks during evening to partying ones as the night progresses on.

Overall, the Kolkata gastropub scene is proud to have Monkey bar in its lineup. Hope it gets better from here.Cant wait to visit soon again :)

Monkey bar in Delhi is a location that is a part of some very special memories so I had really high expectations from its Calcutta counterpart. It certainly did not disappoint. We ordered loaded chicken nachos, the butter chicken kichdi, smoked chicken pizza and others. The butter chicken khichdi was really impressive. So were the cocktails Maanga and Copper monkey. A little on the higher side when it comes to the pocket pinch, monkey bar did live up to all the expectations. And the view is just fantastic.

Just loved it.
The ambiance, the playlist, the skyline view, the staff management, the food and everything is just superb of this pub. This is located in the 9th floor of Knox building opposite to Urban desi. We visited late afternoon but the best time would be to hit this place in the evening. This can be an ideal place to go a date with your partner :)
The view of St. Paul's Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and Hooghly Bridge adds flavour to their ambiance.
Coming to food we had kingfisher premium beer, chicken wings and chocolate lava cake. All of the dishes were value for money. Overall had an excellent experience.
Coming back soon :)

Ok, so same night we visited The Great Booze Story and Monkey Bar, and I'll say Monkey Bar won big time. Just opposite Urban Desi (will visit soon), good collection of music, courteous and attentive staff, this is one venue that you would want to visit again. The ambience, the view of the The Victoria Memorial is just a sight to look at. Safe to say, I'll be coming back to this place soon

We visited Monkey Bar on Saptami evening, and had a spectacular time. The ambience is lively, the music is great, the decor very impressive and the service commendable.  
Now coming to the sumptuous meal; an assortment of drinks - whiskey, tequila, rum, virgin mojita, espresso -  was ordered with starters being Butterfly Chicken and Chicken Chapli. Yes, Butterfly Chicken is a definitely worth a try. In the main course, there was Aunty Vinnie's Berry Pulao. Tiger Beef was so delicious that two more dishes were ordered; this is must-try for beef lovers. This is the first place in Kolkata that I see so many beef dishes being offered. Galouti Killer was the other beef dish ordered and equally palatable. I had Mee Goreng which is an Indonesian dish of spiced noodles and got it topped with chicken. 
Overall, it was a great experience in this newly-opened gastropub.

Another fab newbie in the city

Talk about the Ambience, Food, Service or the Decor, it excels in all

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building at Camac Street, it offers a spectacular view of the city
 
The Decor and Seating Arrangements are well made 

They got a separate smoking area which is quite airy, and has ample seating space as well

Shisha was pretty decent and lasted quite a while

Now lets talk about the protagonist here

Nachos were crisp and loaded with cheese, the Platter was appealing and featured variety of items whereas the mocktails were on fleek 

But things which really caught our attention were Spaghetti and Paneer Khidchi

While the former was extremely tasty, the latter is a MUST have dish for sure

All in all, it was a happy dining experience for us

If you are in Calcutta and love the skyline and a few drinks to go along with it on a hot, rainy or crisp evening this is the place to be. Monkey Bar in Calcutta is done up beautifully and affords you a view of the Victoria Memorial, St Paul's Cathedral and the Hoogly Bridge. The have cocktails and food over and above what they offer in other cities. The hipster smash is delicious to say the least. As was the bourbon cocktail with almond bitters...

Visited today for lunch, and a had a lovely time! 
I suggest you get a table by the windows. The Kolkata skyline will definitely make your visit even more memorable. 
We tried the Maanga cocktail (5 stars, peeps!) with the Tiger Beef. I suggest you try both. Succulent meat with the zing of your drink makes for some very happy (read: tipsy) people. 
For mains, we tried the Mobar burger and it was heavenly! The Naga pork soulful bowl was fabulous too! Portions are great, flavour is gorgeous and staff is super sweet and nice. 
I hope you maintain what you've got going so I can visit again!

Nice decor , awsum view of the cityscape and great cocktails . Food is good to average with a twist and may not be liked by all.
We ordered pitchers of pack a punch,mangaa amd mohjito and the first is the best.

We stuck with finger food only and ordered 
Mushroom bruschetta(good),prawn pil pil(gr8), chicken churi(avg) and tiger beef(gr8)
Rounded everything off with aunty berry pulao which was delicious
 This a typical gastro bar with foot tapping music which is too loud at times, we had to ask it to be turned down.

The service could have been bettet and there  was confusion while seating. We were waiting at the bar for our table to be ready but some other guests jumped on that

Oh forgot to mention a outing here will surely burn a whole in your pocket

I went to monkey bar last night and I was pretty surprised. Read all the reviews and thoroughly analysed the place in my mind before I went there (it's what I do). 
The guy at the front desk (I believe he was the owner) was phenomenal. So welcoming, so easy going and so 'approachable'. The one at the front desk is the face of any restaurant. He told us we'll have to wait for 40, but we got a table in 20. Told us we'll have to share the table - but eventually we didn't have to. 
I think seating right outside the kitchen + bar worked for us. Didn't have to wait for the food (the cheese drum, nachos and mushroom + truffle oil pizza are INSANE). Ordered quite a bit on the liquor front - barring the martini everything else was really good (fun presentation too!) (including the ginger beer). We had heard so much about the desserts - total let down though (chocolava cake with mint ice cream was terrible I must confess - Mezzuna gets the big ups here). 
The staff was pretty alright (looked a little confused at times). 
Monkey bar must work on guest management (but it is only a few weeks old so it's okay). Thoroughly impressed with the ambience (trumps Mezzuna and all the other hot spots in the city several times over), food, booze and service. 
This place has my highest recommendation.

Bookmarks . ¬†It's got an amazing atmosphere with outdoor and indoor seating. Despite going on the weekend it gets the right amount of crowd that makes it a very happening place. Music was really good. We wanted to try a new cocktail, so we went for the ¬†toast to calcutta which was a little different and tasted quite good. Food on the other hand was quite unique. 
service is also impressed us. ¬† ¬†

The place is a little hard to find. But overall it's a nice place for the weekend chill!

Visited this place on 7th October with friends. We were a group of 11 but there is no place for such big group there.  The table we were given was ideal for 7 but we had to squeeze in.  Repeated request for chair felt to deaf ears till such time my friend pulled up the bar chair from the adjacent table. They have limited staff and one server was alloted to the tables.  Needless to say the service was pathetic and totally unacceptable. Our order for beer and ginger ale took 30 mins and after repeated reminders it arrived.  The food is average with limited option for Vegetarian. No one wants to eat "baigan pakora " or " vada pav" at such a place.  We were charged for one item that was ordered but not served. On pointing the same the server "argued" that we didn't realise but it was indeed served to us.  In no mood to hang around any more we just paid and left.  While waiting down for our car we met others who too were very disappointed with the place. 

This will be one of those places in kolkata that will soon be ticked off based on word or mouth and customer experience because of shabby service and attitude of the people who run it.

So finally visited Monkey Bar ! The ambience is good as compared to What we get to see in Kolkata.. but apart from that nothing spectacular and surely cannot be compared to the one in Mumbai ! The food is Too average . We had ordered the Nachos - this one was a disaster , pesto spaghetti ( penne pasta wasn't there!!) - yet again very bland and just not up to the mark . Though tempura and mezze platter was good BUT the Coconut ice cream Dessert was FABULOUS SO an extra 0.50 points for that !! Food needs to be worked upon , staff is courteous ! Best wishes .. hoping my next visit be better and with no complains !

I went this place with my friends and I would say this was amazing and was full packed in the weekend without liquor. There ambiance was very good and the music they place is also very nice . There drinks where also very good . They smoking and non smoking area also which was the best part of this place. Good place to spend with your friends. As we been to many other bars but I love this place as they have place to sit and there service was also excellent. They where pack but still there people know how to attend the gust which was very good in this bar. Pocket friendly and staff was excellent smiling and they working and they suggest also if you are new to this place and don't know what to order. I would suggest everyone for this place and sure you will be in love with this place. I basically tried everything on the menu (food and beverage), and yes it is all worth every penny
, I m fan of there menu and food, really enjoyed.¬†

ambience is good.. was excited to reach the place.. view n open air is also impressive.. u get a glimpse of the Victoria memorial
Although can't talk about the cocktails(coz we wet on 2nd oct, dry day), but we had the copper monkey mocktail and a ginger beer, we were very happy with both
But sadly food was extremely disappointing.. taste as well as quality is not upto the mark.. ordered the much talked about chicken butterfly, too sweet, no flavour of chicken n tasted Lyk beans on toast
Second ordered the spicy tomato spaghetti, worst I hav ever had, tasted like Maggi with tomato
Butter chicken khichadi was good,,, good innovation
Snickerbar, dessert, was well mind blowing if u hav a sweet tooth.. very nice and balanced taste
But the whole dining experience was not satisfactory

The only plus points are the ambience and the service.
The hookah is average and food simply disappoints.
The vada pao is good.
The Mac and cheese croquettes have peas in them..like who does peas with cheese and Mac..
Too bad with the experimentation guys..
And the potato rackett is also very bland.
Galauti is average..
You guys are better in other cities I have heard..so pls improve in Kolkata

The place is worst ever in all places that I do visit. What it seems from outside is not at all from inside. It's totally a different one and thats very disappointing for me. The hookah was so bad that I just left it after once. It was all a waste of money for me and that too a huge waste as it is very costly as per their brand name , but it's sad to say that it couldn't carry it'd brand name at all.

Location-Fort knox building(9th floor),Camac street.

Finally "Monkey bar" has opened its gate to kolkata.After establishing itself in Mumbai,Delhi and Bangalore its opening in kolkata was much awaited.This place is totally a fresh take on gastrobar culture.As we entered we were totally astonished with the beauty of this place.The best part about this place was the swanky interiors and the dazzling view.The menu was mouthwatering and creation of one of the finest chef Manu Chandra.But along with whole lot of positive aspects this place has its negative side too and that is its service and price.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is extremely calm and soothing.The interiors are extremely high-toned.The place is divided into two sections(Smoking and Non Smoking area)which is appreciated.And atlast for this segment,we can bet that this place has the best view in comparison to any of the eateries in Kolkata.

Service-We were extremely disappointed with the service at this place.The staff was extremely confused with our seating.They took about 15 minutes to make us sit and also the table on which we were seated was already reserved by someone due to which we have to change our table in between.We also have to urge them many a times to serve us water and take the order for the food.But on the other side we saw that the staff was trained very well with the dishes and helped us to choose the right dishes according to our starvation.

Food-The food at this place was good in taste but what astonished us the most was their presentation,it was just praise-worthy.We had-
1:Med platter
2:Spicy panner bhurji buns
3:Chilli cheese dragons

Among them our favourite was "Med platter".We also had sheesha at this place which we find extremely expensive.It cost us around 800+taxes.

Food-4/5
Service-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

This place is a must visit for experiencing its Ambiance and food oresentation.üòÉüòÉ

Woo another gastropub in town, I was super excited to explore this new place. Unfortunately they not yet started with alcohol. But yes for compensation they have this Non alcoholic beer in their menu card. Which is more like a ginger ale.¬†

Had recently visited the place.  Ambience was really good.  Soothing music and ample space worked well for me.  All the people were very courteous and response was very quick. We ordered nachos,  potato with rachlette cheese and pizza.  The food was yummmm. We asked for out of the menu toppings for pizza and they were more than happy to serve.  It was a pleasant experience.

Visited the place on 24Sep. A mix of pro's and cons. Remarkably expensive, considering service is yet to reach premium standards. Yet to get a bar license, staff seems confused about where to seat you if you walk in as a couple. While the outdoor sitting layout is nice, it's primarily used as a hookah space by boisterous youngsters, and the seating layout is remarkably cramped. Service also is a minus here with the server not asking or serving water if not called to do so. Portions are quite small against the charges. Chicken Chimichuri was good, folks lovers which was 3 cutlets of bhekti coated and fried was ok. The mushroom pizza was definitely a let down. With 2 soft drinks the tab came to ‚Çπ1650+. Not worth a revisit soon.

Kolkata welcomes Monkey Bar with whole hearted love and appreciation... and they deserve it... no doubts about that...

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, Camac Street... and I will suggest everyone to go there during the evening... you guys will get mesmerized with the view of our City of Joy... I bet no other gustopub have such plus point till date in Kolkata... they have an excellent intero which you can enjoy anytime... also the outdoor seating is pretty attracting...

The service was top notched... and the staffs are very courteous too...

Now coming straight to the food and drinks...

‚ô° Mac and cheese croquettes¬ª¬ª¬ª Awesome preparation... awesome taste gone good with chilli mayo and salsa...

The city known for its lyaad or lazy/laid back attitude just got another reason to monkey and laze around!. Chef-prenuer Manu Chandra‚Äôs ever so popular gastro pub, Monkey Bar has finally swung its way to the East!. The Monkey Bar Kolkata has opened in the ever so busy location of Camac Street. Located on the 9th Floor of Fort Knox Mall, the gastro pub has a sprawling view of the cityspace! No wonder, the owners have dedicated an entire wall of glass windows to let guests marvel at the beauty that is Kolkata!

Visited here for the first time. The food menu is different from what you come across usually in other restaurants. I think it's a perfect date spot as it has a beautiful Victoria building's view which looks amazing at night. Also the music was superb.
Pocket pinch : 600-700 per head. ( Food and mocktail)

Monkey stroll at a pre-launch of Monkey Bar in Kolkata..!

Looking for a quirky place where you can spend your evening, enjoying a spectacular view of the city‚Äôs skyline over a drink? The City of Joy opened doors to India‚Äôs first and favourite gastro-pub, Monkey Bar.  Known for its fresh and innovative cocktails, signature dishes with a playful twist and quality service, the new Monkey Bar in all set to amaze you.

Monkey Bar was first launched by Olive Caf√©s South Pvt. Ltd., a  of Olive Bar and Kitchen Pvt. Ltd in partnership with award winning chef Manu Chandra and hospitality operations expert Chetan Rampal and was first launched in Bangalore. Monkey Bar, the Indian avatar of the Gastropub, puts its own unique spin on the internationally popular concept of Gastropub wherein the emphasis is on fresh, innovative and affordable-in a trendy, chic atmosphere backed by excellent food and innovative cocktails at accessible prices.

Location:  Located on up-scale Camac Street, Monkey Bar is placed on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building.

Pocket Pinch: A meal for two without alcohol would cost around Rs. 1200 excluding taxes, and a meal for two with alcohol would be around Rs. 1800.

Decor and Ambience: Monkey Bar, Kolkata spread across 2,750 square feet of space weaves contextual references of colonial Calcutta into a contemporary designed space. The space is welcoming, intimate and effortlessly dramatic. It offers a panoramic view of iconic landmarks including St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral, Victoria Memorial and the Vidyasagar Setu. The spatial layout has 3 distinct areas that have been seamlessly woven together. The space features an airy atrium with a 24 feet high ceiling marked by large arched windows and a variety of seating options; a distinct elevated bar area and an open-to-sky terrace.  The elevated area houses the lengthy bar with a crimson facade wall built using hollow clay blocks and designed to create a geometrical pattern ‚Äì reminiscent of ‚Äòjaali‚Äô, which forms a feature of some of the landmark buildings of the City.

Amazing decor and awesome food. They had an outdoor sitting too which had a big screen playing Mickie and Minnie black and white cartoon synchronized with the songs being played. The cost is on the higher side but if you want to pamper yourself or people you love, this is the place to be. The amazing view is icing on the cake.

Finally the Monkey swings it ways to the East and hits Kolkata with a bang. Being the city flooded with thousands of Legendary Restaurant, cafes, street foods junctions and Highly admired sweet shops, but it was missing out with something we call a Gastronomy feature. Here it is Olive Caf√©s South Pvt. Ltd comes up with it. After serving the best to Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore the only Gastro Pub is all ready to take your breathe away with so much of excitement. The entire setup and ambiance is made up by keeping in mind the entire Calcuttan culture with posters of way back time of the hand rickshaws, Victoria memorial and Scenes of Durga Puja.

Monkey Bar opened its doors to the Kolkata crowd on the 6th of September and has ever since been rolling them inward, to let in the food fanatic Kolkatans. Being invited to the pre-launch tasting at Monkey Bar, allowed me to have a go at their mouth watering food and incredible mocktails. The mocktails were a personal preference; you can go bananas over their fabulously curated cocktails as well.

The ambience is lovely, very warm and urban. We ordered Aam Pannas, Tiger beef, Prawn Ghee Roast, Pepper Calamari. All of them were to die for. For dessert we ordered Nolen gurer creme br√ªl√©e.

Finally they have arrived in Kolkata after rocking Delhi , Mumbai , Bangalore etc. and a few of Corporate Monkeys could muster the courage and had enough stock of lame excuses (for residential purposes only) to visit this joint on the lazy Saturday afternoon last week. Very conveniently located at Camac Street , innovative food & drinks menu like Kerala Rice , Butterfly Chicken , Prawn Pil Pil and many more.¬† Personally I loved the ginger beer. It was a full house and it is nice to see that City of Joy has lapped up the Monkey Bar and the legendary versatile gastronomical journey of Kolkata has just added yet another feather . Must visit joint for foodies and a great place to unwind. Wishing luck and Highly recommended !!!!

After a lot of ho humm and hush hush conversations about Monkey Bar Kolkata is finally here. Right in the middle of the action zone in Camac Street on the top floor of Fort Knox building. This used to be the erstwhile Venom. 

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

Dim lights and chic interiors. A totally fresh take on gastropub culture. The place was almost full when we entered so 9 of us had to accommodate on a smaller table. They weren't serving alcohol today, and for the next few days also they are keeping the bar closed. we had to compromise on that and had to order the virgins. We had the much hyped 'maanga' which was nice and refreshing. Homemade ginger beer was good. Brownie cookie shake wasn't available. For starters we had chilli cheese dragons, cheese filled cigar rolls with spicy garlic sauce, the sauce was amazing. Rock Corn tempura was good, crisp and the teriyaki sauce was appropriately done. Loaded nachos was amazing. Potato with raclette which was fried potatoes topped with stringy mozzarella cheese, was basic and slightly spiced toped with pickled jalape√±os. We also ordered two types of pizza , roasted zucchini with parmesan and tomatoes and the other, mushrooms with truffle oil. I loved the mushroom one over the zucchini one. But the pizza looked a bit messy and wasn't also evenly crisp. Overall the service was spontaneous and amiable. I liked the overall experience though.

It was saturday the 3rd of september 2016 and i was on my bed relaxing as being a holiday for me but then i remembered that i had a very interesting day to happen as i had got an invitation by Gaurav of communication 2.0 for the preview of MONKEY BAR,KOLKATA . So i did not want to miss such a grand opportunity which i was invited for ,so i rushed and got ready in a few minutes without delaying any further and on stepping out of my home to realise that it was thundering and raining very heavily as a result transportation was a bit of issue ,nevertheless i had my full mind set to make it happen and be there battling the weather too .It took me around more than 2 hours to reach the place from Rajarhat to Monkey bar which is in the 9th floor of FORT KNOX BUILDING in Camac street. But i wasn‚Äôt complaining after i entered the great gastro -pub to see that i was a bit late in missing a lot of activities and drinks session but the food was not yet started spread which gave me a tap on my back and a bundle of happiness inside. Ask me why ? cause i am an non alcoholic drinker so i was not dissapointed with myself that way on entering late as my interest in the food tasting was yet to come .

Monkey Bar is a grown up version of a slightly more casual neighborhood bar. With about 300+ gastro pubs in India it is only a matter of time when people start aping. The Calcutta version is setting it apart from the rest of the so called gastro pubs.

We had the good fortune of going to the private opening of Monkey Bar Kolkata on the 1st September, 2016. It was a small party for about a 100 people. The mood was up beat and there was a sense of relief and satisfaction on the staff who were hosting us. It has taken Monkey Bar Kolkata a little over 8 months to complete the restaurant.

The staff is from all across the country. This makes for some good interaction with them ‚Äì that is if you care to chat them up. The cocktails are more involved. There is reasonable work that is done to create the drinks behind the counter. Work as in ingredients have been mixed and labor have been put in to create a concoction or mixes. Not just opening bottles and squirting premixes in a shaker and serving things up. Almost like an artisan touch. The bases are fermented in house; you can see the large glass jars filled and sitting happy on the bar counter.

To begins with the view is something you must visit let alone anything else. Add the food and you have method to mayhem. The care that goes in the food here is evident when you have your first bites. With Chef Manu Chandra at the helm of the kitchen things are definitely going to have certain standards in terms of flavor and quality. There is always going to be a reason behind why what ever has been done to the food in the kitchen here at Monkey Bar.

Expect massive flavors and good service. In fact it is so good to see the city opening up to the kinds of Monkey Bar. This is a place where you can come in and kick back with friends on a weekend. This is one tree that we two monkeys are happy to call home.

So finally Kolkata gets Monkey Bar!! 
I have always loved the Bangalore  and the Mumbai Monkey Bar because of the ambience.  
First day, the space and the view is amazing!! They had a very limited drinks menu considering first day. I had Toast to Calcutta, Manga and Copper Grin. Toast to Calcutta was refreshing, adding smoke gondhoraj lebu,  it tasted even better.  Manga is something I have drank before.  Copper Grin was okay. 
Let's get into the food menu.  Prawn ghee roast,  Vada Pav,  Keema Pav the menu took me back to Bombay and South. 
I had the Korean sticky wings,  since I already came to Monkey Bar  after having dinner,  I sticked to one starter and drinks!
I am planning to head back to Monkey Bar pretty soon for full fledged meal and lot of Toast to Calcutta! 
Please stock the bar as it is extremely disappointing to come to Monkey Bar and sit with limited choices in terms of alcohol.

Monkey Bar is on the 9th floor of the Fort Knox building on camac. Visit in the evening and if you're sitting by the window panes, you can see the Victoria Memorial, lights twinkling from The 42, and the outline of a part of the Parama flyover. It's so cool! 
The music is good and the place has a very funky feel to it. The food is good, not excellent. 
Loved the pizza and the Med platter.  Corn kernels were okayish. 
The Loaded Nachos were Brilliant!! Lots of sour cream and Mexican beans and fully loaded as the name suggests! No other places in kolkata (apart from the Big Nachos at

Yes, you read it correct alright. Monkey Bar has arrived here in our City Of Joy. I was lucky that I got an invite for a preview of the place before the launch. Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building, the view that Monkey Bar provides is unparalleled. A bunch of crazy fellow foodies and I waded through the water logged streets on 5th September and entered. I loved the ambiance and the entire decor. The way everything was set up gave me the feeling of being transported to another time altogether. Headed by Chef Manu Chandra, this place has already made its mark in Bangalore, Mumbai and Delhi. Kolkata being its latest stop, the team has given it their best and it is showing brilliantly.

This review might change. This post is influenced mostly due to the nonavailability of alcohol , and I did see two or three bottles of liquor , anyway , about the interiors and location , bloody superb amazing selection , love it , would suggest it anybody , the bartenders ( coke tenders üòÇ) seemed cocky , but it's a relief to see a high end restaurant serving beef, that's fresh and the it was good actually , would go again for the booze !

Went there in the evening today to check out all the hype surrounding it. Guess what! Wasn't disappointed at all. We took a seat right next to the window(yes, I have a fascination for tables next to Windows) and was mesmerised by the breathtaking view of the city. The music, ambience were perfect for a chilled out evening with a great date(note:my husband).
The lemon iced tea was very good.. Perfect in taste. The staff recommended ' the med platter 'as a great vegetarian option and we decided to try that. The platter had falafel, pita pockets, cheese and spinach filos, and the usual dips. The hummus was great and we were serves a hearty portion if it which made us happy coz it's the dips which usually are heroes of this dish. The babagonoush was great and it had a smokey taste which was really good. The curd and cucumber dip definitely needs improvement. It was runny and tasted like buttermilk! Had no taste and we left most of it. The best part of the ambience was hookah had a separate enclosure and wasn't served inside the main restaurant! Will definitely return to this place for a relaxing evening!

New place and pathetic service....guy at the reception refused to give a table coz I was alone and suggested a table outside in open when it was so  hot outside.After a while I was a given a table with no seat n ws suggested to stand n eat (brilliant!) Although after some protest a seat was provided.i even noticed couples were asked to share a table even when some of the tables were empty ! It was quite bizzare !! imagine going on a double date with some strangers ! It was like they just wanted to give table to group of 4 or more ,again like I said restaurant was not even full!

Food was served ..I ordered a prawn dish ,peach ice tea and the snicker bar for dessert.prawn dish was good ,the ice tea wasn't served n after 45 minutes of ordering I was told it's not available .the snicker bar was good (recommended) !! Some how all the servers were lost in their own world ,roaming around in groups n hardly paying attention to customers ..that too when there was no rush at all ! 
 
I am not tat critical while writing reviews but m quite surprised how casual the staff was while handling their customers (that too being a new place in town).I have been to monkey bar in Delhi and tat place is amazing ! 

Service - 0/5
Decor -4/5 (lovely view of Victoria memorial n hoogly bridge ) 
Food - 3.5 (would love to explore more) 

Must have - the snicker bar

City gets another gastropub, and this time it is a big one. It‚Äôs Monkey bar who has already made some good name in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore and is considered to be one of the happening places in town. The place here in Kolkata is situated at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building (Camac Street) beside Urban Desi. The food and beverages that you get at other cities are mostly present here and along with it you will get several beverages which have been specially curated for Calcutta. Hope this will turn out to be one of the coolest places in the city in the coming days. Since I was invited to the pre-inauguration Bloggers Meet over food tasting session at this place, I would like to pen down my tryst with this new place. But first, I would like to thank the team at Communications 2.0 for this invitation. Monkey bar is a part of Olive Cafe South Private Limited and is said to the pioneer gastropub first set up in Bangalore in 2012. With its new outlet in the city of joy it further spreads its wings and increases its pan-India fan base. I was very excited when I heard Monkey bar is coming to the city and then one fine day when the invitation to visit the place came to me, my excitements knew no bounds. I was eagerly looking forward to the day. Though it was raining cats and dogs on that day, but still I was determined enough to make it to the venue, and quite on-time!

Had been waiting eagerly for the opening of Monkey Bar and there I was dragging my fiance, paying a visit in the first week itself. However I would say i rather got slightly disappointed. The staff seemed amateur. They were very amiable but highly confused. Firstly it took them over 20-25mins with repetitive reminders to serve us water. And further disappointment was on asking for the drinks menu, they informed us they didn't have license for alcohol. Thus we had to settle for mocktails. The person who took our mocktail order was so confused. He was unsure of the mocktails on offer, we had to specifically cue him with names like green apple or blue lagoon etc. And oh, there was no paper napkins, spoons and forks or sauces kept on the table for us as some had mentioned in previous reviews - we had to ask for them. Probably they don't have them kept in advance in the open air section.
Now the good part - Everything else!
The ambience - Wow. The view of the Victoria Memorial is simply stunning. You can just sit and spend hours adoring your surroundings.
We ordered a teen paan hookah, along with a Virgin Mangaa- Loved it and a Green Apple Soda which was decent, not that great. Next on our list were the Butterflies, Rooster Booster Burger & Chicken 65. The first two were mouthwatering, especially the burger - juicy, filling, yummilicious. And then the cherry on the pie - the dessert - Snicker bar- I genuinely recommend this. Loved the way they serve it and the taste is heavenly.
Overall, had a lovely evening with the MoBar Mojo! Just wished I could give it a 5 star rating.

Monkey Bar is finally here in The City of Joy. Bought to us by Olive Caf√©s South Pvt. Ltd., a subsidiary of Olive Bar and Kitchen Pvt. Ltd, one of India‚Äôs premier stand-alone restaurant brands, helmed by award winning Chef Manu Chandra and hospitality operations expert Chetan Rampal, it was first launched in Bangalore in mid-2012, the gastropub currently has two outposts in Delhi, one in Bangalore and one in Mumbai and now opens in Kolkata with Avantika Saraogi coming on board, giving the brand a national footprint. Monkey Bar, the Indian avatar of the Gastropub, puts its own unique spin on the internationally popular concept. It has the essence of a pub backed by excellent food and service.

The Monkey has finally swung east, and that too it's making it's presence felt !! After Mumbai and Delhi now Kolkata hasit own "Monkey Bar". 
To start with It's an amazing property that has a breathtaking view. You can just gaze at Kolkata skyline while sipping some amazing cocktails.
Curated by acclaimed chef Manu Chandra, Monkey Bar's menu boasts of innovative food and drinks. I absolutely loved each and everything that i tasted but some of the items and drinks need spl mention.
Kerala Rice Salad- A salad made with wild red rice, blended with herbs and topped with curd chilli, the dish is indigenous and light.
Med Platter-A dish which is a visual delight in itself apart from being a total amalgamation of fritters and dips.
Tikki of Joy- A perfect dish to satisfy the bong fish craving.
Butterfly Chicken- Chicken blended with herbs placed inside a butterfly shaped shell.
Prawn Pil Pil- Perfectly prepared Prawn served with bread. Simple yet delicious
Laal Maas Phulka Tacos-Rajasthani laal mash intelligently placed inside tacos, a perfect fusion food.
Spare Pork Ribs- This is ansolutely recommended for those pork lovers. The meat is tender and cooked to perfection in barbecue sauce.
The drinks served quenched our thirst perfectly, among them some needs spl mentionlike Manga, Copper Monkey, Pink Punch. 
The desserts are absolutely delightful.Gondhoraj Lemon Tart is sweet, with a bit of tang!! There is Snicker Bar whichbis total bliss.
So with the coming of Monkey Bar i can safely say that gastronomic revolution has indeed hit our City of Joy.

The City of Joy is witnessing a major change in the gastronomic culture post the technological revolution of smartphones and wireless technology. There has been evolution of the global food and Calcuttans are gradually getting used to it. After many multinational and national pubs coming to Kolkata, it was the turn for Monkey Bar to refresh Kolkata with its gracious presence.

This 3rd September, I was invited to the Pre Launch of the Kolkata Chapter where the #MonkeySwungEast. It was a lovely happy afternoon where all the foodies, bloggers, critics and experts had a gala time with beautiful cocktails, mocktails and great good.

The place is located at the 9th floor of Fort Knox Building in Camac Street. Blessed with a wonderful view, you can see the Victoria Memorial, St. Paul‚Äôs Cathedral and Hooghly Bridge altogether. We had to pick up paper pieces with names of cocktails and sit at the assigned table to participate in games and quizzes. It was a lot of fun. Ambience is all classy with the bar and high chair along with couches. I loved the wall art on the gateway to the open air sitting area which is done with Gupi Bagha, Tana Rickshaw and all the nostalgic memoirs of Kolkata.

The food was equally good. There were many cocktails and I, being a teetotaler had the virgin versions of all the drinks. Some of them were great, actually. We had ‚Äì

Kerala Red Rice Salad - Baby spinach, red rice, raw mango, coconut, peanuts and upmensinkai (salted chilli from Karnataka). I generally do not eat chillies, but this one was so good. Loved it a lot.

Mac & Cheese Croquettes ‚Äì Golden fried broccoli and peas along with chilli mayo and salsa. I am a fan of cheese. So the croquettes were really admired.

Med Platter - Falafel, spinach, cheese filo parcels, hummus, smoked baba ganoush, roasted peppers, olives, with pita bread and labneh. The presentation of this platter was really an eye catching one. It was really good.

Smoked Beetroot and Beans Galouti - Melt in mouth vegetarian galouti on saffron laced taftan, onion and mint chutney. This dish too was okay.

Baked Brie ‚Äì Oh! I loved this dish. Brie cheese with filo surrounded by pineapple salsa. The cheese oozing out of the pastry created all the sensation. Loved this dish a lot. Had a huge share of it from my table.

Prawn Pil Pil - Tossed in olive oil with chilli, garlic and parsley. It was served with garlic rubbed toast. This was extremely delicious. Loved the dish a lot specially for its aroma and the garlic breads, specially.

Tikki of Joy - Kolkata inspired Bhetki fish cutlets with kasundi, fennel seed & coriander, served with mint chutney. This is one classic dish which no Calcuttan will ever fail to love. I was no exception.

Tiger Beef - Slices of steak tossed with chilli paste, black beans, galangal, ginger, bean sprouts, lemon, bok choy and peppers. This dish was a bit spicy, not suited to my taste but loved by my fellow foodies at the table.

Butterfly Chicken - Sweet, spicy, crispy bits of chicken tossed with sesame, chilli, honey and peppers; stuffed in our signature butterfly shells. The butterfly shells resembled to a savoury treat from the lands of Andhra Pradesh, popularly known as Phoolbu. This dish was unique, in presentation and taste.

Laal Maas Phulka Tacos ‚Äì Who doesn‚Äôt know about this classical delicacy of Rajasthan? Monkey Bar has successfully fused this Indian beauty along with Mexican Tacos. This twist in the cuisines creates the beauty of the culinary culture and here lies the skill of a chef, who is an artist in this case. Loved this dish for the innovation.

Spare Pork Ribs ‚Äì Trust me, it is the best pork dish I have had till date. The pork was so soft, juicy and tender that it literally melted inside the mouth. It was tossed in a tangy and sweet sauce which was really good. Writing the review after 5-6 days but I still can‚Äôt get over the beauty of the pork ribs.

Gondhoraj Lime Tart ‚Äì This was one unique dessert we have tried there. Lemon curd, torched meringue, lemon & mint gel, pistachio cake & cookie crust ‚Äì combination of all good things at one go. Loved the refreshing vibe of this dessert.

The Snicker Bar ‚Äì I am not a big Snicker fan. But this dessert along with the perfect swirls of the s‚Äômore has become one of the desserts to crave for at the strangest of times. Milk chocolate ganache, dark chocolate micro cake, hazelnut praline cream, salted caramel gel being the composition of this dessert, I loved it till the end.

Drinks ‚Äì Copper Monkey, Manga, Pack of Punch, Toast To Calcutta, Mad Men. I was in Team Copper Monkey. Had the virgin version of all the drinks. Liked the Manga to be the best, which they claim to be one of their signature cocktails along with Copper Monkey, which was also very good.

I would like to thank the nationally acclaimed figure Chef Manu Chandra to spend and share his valuable words about food and Team Monkey Bar for having us over and presenting a lifetime of memories. Best wishes to the team and may they prosper ahead. Happy Dining! :)

Monkey Bar has finally come to the City of Joy and promises to be a perfect place to have fun and relax. When we walked into the gastropub, the first thing that came to our minds was "classy and quirky".¬†
The best of it all is the stunning view.  You have a clear sight of the St. Paul's Cathedral and the Victoria Memorial in the distance. The service staff are swift and attentive.
 Another thoughtful design is the assortment of condiments and cutlery set on the tables. You can use them as you like instead of calling for the servers everytime. The cocktails are innovative, using a variety of ingredients and the food is lip-smackingly delicious! Our recommendations are the Mangaa and the Tipsy Sherbet among the drinks. With regards to the food, the vegetarian dishes are as good as the non vegetarian ones. We suggest the Med Platter and the Baked Brie among the vegetarian choices. For the non-vegetarians, the Prawn Pil Pil is a must try. To achieve full satiisfaction, do sample the Snicker Bar..it is to die for!

There used to be a time in Kolkata, when a discussion about food would generally lead towards traditional recipes and legendary restaurants that have been an inherent part of the city for decades. But now, that time has come and gone. Kolkata is experiencing a ‚Äòfood revolution‚Äô, where upcoming restaurants are trying to boost the dining scene by experimenting in scientific and artistic gastronomy.

Monkey Bar, gaining popularity for being the first gastropub in India, now has its doors open in Kolkata. After other metro cities like Bangalore, Mumbai and New Delhi, it was about time that even the City Of Joy got its own quality gastropub.

It is located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building, Camac Street. Monkey Bar has built up a huge reputation in the food industry since its inception at Bangalore, and thus one can expect some top-of-the-line interiors and service here. The d√©cor has a classic and heartfelt finesse. The restaurant in its entirety has been designed and crafted to showcase the cultural legacy of Kolkata. Even if this isn‚Äôt enough, you also get a spell-binding view of the Victoria Memorial and a couple of other landmarks in the city‚Äôs skyline, giving you a sort of mini tour of the Kolkata.

Nationally acclaimed, Chef Manu Chandra has done a commendable job in curating the menu. A major part of the menu at Monkey Bar has been designed from scratch especially for Kolkata. Though the food is inspired from pubs around the world, the dishes are traditional but with an unconventional and playful twist. This allows you to relish international flavours in homely dishes and indulge in your Indian roots.

In my opinion, Monkey Bar is the newest and best addition to the dining scene in Kolkata and will surely turn plenty heads towards itself, be it from the customers or competitors.

So folks that was about it from Monkey Bar.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !! ‚Ä¶

The wait is finally over. The moment you enter Monkey Bar, you get the feel of the one in Bangalore. The open air area is simply amazing, the view of Victoria Memorial is breathtaking. 
I loved the ambience of the inner section as well. Even though it has some basic monkey bar elements missing the place is great overall. 
We ordered the MoBar Classic Chilli Cheese Dragons which were to die for. 
For drinks we had the Copper One which was quite bad. It didn't taste of Alcohol at all. 
Taste of Calcutta was refreshing and nice. Pack a punch was also decent. 
All in all once they start functioning full time and properly it will be a great place. Super excited!

‚ÄãMonkey Bar finally opens its doors to the city of joy ! If we consider the scenario of Kolkata around two years back, then the word ‚Äògastropub‚Äò was just a term that we used to associate with the cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. But over a short passage of time, new gastropubs are being launched in the city, making it a more happening place to live in. Monkey Bar is the latest and perhaps the best introduction to the scenario of slowly evolving gastropubs in Kolkata. The excitement for its launch was doubled when I was invited to be a part of a bloggers meet, for the pre-inauguration of Monkey Bar, powered by¬†Communications¬†2.0
