One of the popular fast food eateries, have tried Fish Fry and Pakoras from this place. The place has nil ambiance but the service is on the faster side.

This one happens to be one of the most popular eateries in this area.... small but good food they have. Good for light evening snacks and passerbys biting in.

4.0 Rating for being the only fast food spot near my place. Once hungry, I just hop in here. As a fast food shop, it's really reasonable and satisfactory. Only problem is that mutton is never available in this shop, though it's written in the menu. Don't know why. Need to ask. If you're really hungry, then it's fine to sit and have food there. Rolls, fry, chow, chops, cutlets and gravy items are fine to order. Don't go for chicken lollipop. Shop closes by 10 P.M. Don't forget to hop in to their sweet shop just beside the snack shop. Things are generally fresh, trust me. Service is normal !

Just a few meters away from my house have been going here for a casual evening snack now and then ever since it opened quite a few years back. Rolls are good .. vegetable chop is recommended. Go for the basic Chinese items I prefer their fried rice over noodles .. stick to chili , sweet & sour or manchurian chicken don't be adventurous . Moghlai paratha is also very nice here. It used to be a lot cheaper back in the day with chicken pakoras to die for . But it's still cheap but the pakoras sadly did not retain their trademark taste. Looking forward to visit this place once I'm back in town.

Tripti is located just a few metres from my place. We usually go there for the evening snack. The food quality is good and with reasonable price. Chicken roll, chicken chowmin, chicken lollypop are the things which I have had.

The quality of the food is so so. The dining place is not good. The place is famous for different type of rolls like egg roll, chicken roll etc. The taste of the chowmein is not so good but economical.
