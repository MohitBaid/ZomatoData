Worst food as well as worst service 
The quality of the food is pathetic 
Most of the dishes are unavailable
Its better to stay hungry
Please try to avoid this restaurant..they take more than an hour or two to deliver the food

"Makhaana", a house which only delivers food but lacks dine in service for which it has been given 4.0 but the what covers it up is that it accept delivery order round the clock.
Yes, so only place in Howrah where one can get food anytime specially late night.
The cost is pocket friendly, the quantity is good, and the taste of the food is also good.
It is worth the cost you pay, providing 24 hours service is great.

Amazing food at reasonable price, a rare combination. It's like 'sone pe suhaga'. 24x7 home delivery and doesn't take more than 30-45 minutes.

Thinking of having a dinner with your family at night,well never think of ordering here. I just had the worst dinner of my life. Mouth burning,spicy food,which is made for tribals. Roti's look as if they are made of bricks and not wheat. So great service that the delivery man forgets to bring your order.So well behaved staff that the delivery man is arguing for the aforesaid mistake. All in all I would say if you want someone to have a bad time at bathroom in the morning please order the food for them. I just threw away the entire dinner into the dustbin. Worst food one can have.
