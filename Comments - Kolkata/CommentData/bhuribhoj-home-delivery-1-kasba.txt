Now enjoy our weekends with complete relaxation with the help of Bhuribhoj. 

If the rain is on, or may the sun is gone.  Lunch or dinner, u name it, they have it.  A complete platter of authentic Bengali cuisine is now just a call away.

Feeling tired on a Sunday with heavy duty household chores or you just feeling 'Laadh'. Mach, Bhaat Mangsho! chutir diner onksho! Deke nin Bhuribhoj, bhoriye debe apnar r apnar poribarer 'Bhuri' diye bibhinno rokomer shushaddu 'Bhoj'. 

Have ordered full course lunch last Weekend and was totally mesmerized to see the quality of food they serve.  Also their special order menu is too awesome. Has tasted some ( Super like for those) and planning for more on the special menu along with meals. Truly a fresh takeaway with all fresh ingredients and spices which rejuvenate your taste bud thoroughly.
