Place is good if you are not expecting too much from it.  It is a small place located between giants like pour house and 10D.  Prices are moderate and ambience is just average.  Service is particularly slow.  We received our hookah after our food.  Food is very mideocre,  we ordered a falafel which was dry and the dips lacked olive oil.  Hookah here is good.  Drinks are priced averagely.  But overall fails to provide with an experience.  Music is very loud which is not required.  They also switch on their cheap DJ lights sometimes .  Virgin mojito lacked the punch of mint too!

REVIEW #100 IN SECTOR 5 NEIGHBOURHOOD ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Thanks Zomato for providing me the platform to showcase my love for food!

Another lounge in the making at the coveted Sector 5 neighbourhood, and I could not stop myself from walking in and tasting a few of their items! Although, I am teetotaler as well as a pure vegetarian, a lounge might not seem the apt place for me, but the foodie in me convinced me to pay a visit and I ordered the below veg items from this place:-

(i)	Crispy babycorns ‚Äì Quite crispy and tasty, especially the presentation does impress you!

(ii)	Tomato shorba ‚Äì Surprisingly, it was served in a glass instead of a soup bowl, nevertheless, it warrants improvement ‚Äì maybe a pinch of lemon might help!

(iii)	Tandoori roti - Crisp

(iv)	Kadhai paneer ‚Äì Tasty, but somewhat oily ‚Äì the decent fusion of tomatoes, capsicum, onions etc does add to the taste

(v)	Green salads

(vi)	Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce ‚Äì A decent end to a nice meal!

Ambience rocks ‚Äì the typical ones you find in lounges and prices are reasonable. Food presentation rocks and you can literally stare and smile at the food items served to you!

D√©cor is great and an LCD TV atop keeps you engaged!

Service, however, needs to buck up!

Cheers!

Today at office we orderd a crab meal and a chicken busket.
Its really very hard to find crab in the preparation..its more like a veg kofta to me, with a very little amount of crab in it..they provide a dal with the meal, which is nice..
In the chicken busket the flavour of chicken is missing, sub marged by other spices..also the chicken was not fresh.in the fried chicken wings the amount of cotting is more than the chicken.. this was my first time to this restaurant...and i wont recommand the food at all

An above average restaurant located in sector 5.Ambience and service is good.We went there with the little coupon. At such a price it was a steal deal but the quality of food has gone down of late. We had chicken hot n sour soup , grilled chicken wings which was undercooked, chicken lababdar which was overcooked with naan. Hope the restaurant maintains the quality of food it offers.

Staff 9/10  very co-operative 
Ambience 8/10 ( till 4 pm ) they change the light sequence which makes the environment best for boozing with dim light and disco light alone with music 
Food 9/10 .. Theres huge variety on the menu..  Every item is must try..  
A good place to visit and its like one of my favourite  places

Ambience - 4/5, good place and nice decoration inside, small dance floor and DJ playing nice music but only con is the music is too loud, if somebody want to have a chitchat with friends then its a no no place or else it's a great place to be. 

Food : It's really awesome, you can try chicken badami murgh, fish kebab with lemon touch, crispy chilli baby corn

Drinks: If you compare that with the other bar and lounge in nearby areas it is on little expensive side and less of options. No cocktail options but variety of Hookahs are there. 

Staff : Very polite and courtes. 

All in all good place to be. Highly recommended

Located opp to barbeque nation, it is a small pub. The ambience was okayish,music was extremely loud but very pocket friendly. They have various combo offers. I tried a mocktail with 2 nonveg starter combo. It costed me Rs.800 inclusive of all taxes. I chose chicken lollipop and a chicken chilli dry item and they were really good. In the mocktails, i tried a mango base mocktail,virgin pina colada and virgin mojito. All the mocktails were amazing.

Another restro locator opened at the Infinity building,which serves a variety of menu. We went for lunch on Saturday. This place was vacant during that hour. Very nicely decorated with the comfy sofa at the corner. In spite of sitting beside the music system, the music was being played in a mild volume which made us feel comfortable. Unlike other lounge & bars which play loud music intentionally. We ordered sweet lime water,iced tea,badami tengri kebabs, grilled chicken wings. In main course we had jeera rice complementing with kaali daal, masala papad and Chicken rarah and Noodles with Devil's Prawn. Each of the items was so tasty.. Value for money, pocket friendly. The service is bit slow but the staffs are so courteous and friendly. We would like to revisit the place.Corporate discount is available if you carry your corporate id card.

Another one of those regular sector 5 joints which serve drinks at a very affordable range. They have offers ongoing on drinks,starters and hookah which doesn't pinch your pocket much. Taste wise, starters were very good. ¬†The barbeue wings had a tinge of lemon in it which gave it a very unique taste. We also had chicken 65 and chicken bell pepper in starters both of which were very tasty. Main course was comparatively disappointing. I would say its better to stick to their indian menu rather than going for continental choices. Because the chicken jumbo burger was absolutely a waste of money and also the american chopsuey had an overdose of tomato sauce in it. We also took an Indian combo of Dal makhani,chicken lababdar and naan which tasted far better than the other main course dishes. All in all, if you want a moderately priced bar and restaurant cum lounge in sector 5, saltlake, this place should fit your bill.

I went there with a deal from the Little App.
Value for money: 10/10 (only with Little App though :p)
Ambience: 9/10
Amount spent: Rs 200
Food: Soup, starter, indian bread, veg or non veg gravy, one scoop of vanilla ice cream.
The starter that I ordered was Grilled Chicken wings, it was good. But the main course was not up to the mark, Chicken lababdar and the sweet corn soup was okayish.
The overall experience was good given the pocket pinch of only Rs. 200.

Liked the d√©cor.
They also had spotlights ad disco lights along with some great music system.
I had drums of heaven and grilled chicken wings for starters.
They tasted great with the booze.
Then we had rice and chicken in black bean sauce, was tasty as well.
Expenses is also reasonable.
Only improvement they need is that they should add a few more drinks to their menu.
Would like to revisit.

Has visited this place couple of weeks back for dinner. It's generally vacant during the latter hours of the day as it's located in a commercial sector.

The restaurant has been nicely decorated with props and wallpapers and has a well furnished bar. There is even a setup for live music. Lighting is on the dimmer side. Seats are well arranged except for the corner ones which are slightly peculiar on design and can be uncomfortable.

Coming to the food, Tomato Pepper Soup & Sweet Corn Soup were too good. Full marks there. Hara Bhara Kebab was soft and flavourful. For main course we ordered Paneer Lababdaar and Veg Jhaal Farezi along with Butter Naan & Laccha Paratha. The taste was decent enough but the quantity could have been a bit more.

The service was fine.
They also serve hookah & alcohol.

Went with few colleagues. Liked the ambience the best was the blue light effect. We ordered hookah, whiskey, üç∫, vodka and diet Coke along with fish & chips, friskey's chicken basket and drums of heaven. Add on was the live music, the singer was good. Now coming to the pricing, it's quite cheap in terms of hookah, on the liquor and food side it's quite same compared to other places. However, to the food, the fish & chips üëçbut the friskey's chicken basket is üëé. One more thing, although the overall experience was good, even the staff's were friendly, and prompt, a small misunderstanding happened, we ordered for mojito, but they served us virgin mojito. Instead of a cocktail we received a mocktail. A small suggestion, the live music although good but that should be selected based upon the crowd. Since, I found maximum of the crowd seems to be office goers and Bengali, may be some Bengali folk or Hindi retro, peppy could also bring people to enjoy the music more.. Rest it's good.

It was my turn to give birthday treat at my office and together with another friend we searched throughout zomato and located this place. We were looking for budget restaurant and this seemed to fit our budget.

We made a reservation for 10 from before and they called at 12:30 to confirm.

Location- Since it is a very new place, opening just on December,2016; most people nearby are not even aware of its location. Had to call them for knowing the exact location. Its located inside infinity benchmark in the 1st floor beside funjabi tadka

Service- Since we booked table from before, we were cordially invited on entering and were introduced to our attendant of the day. It was quite empty being occupied by only one another group. We waited for other members to come for almost half n hour more without ordering food and they were patient. Service time was 20 minutes average per dish..but the attendants were very helpful and came on call for multiple times to clear doubts about menu.

Menu- It consists of hugeeeeee collection of food in its menu.. literally you will get lost within the menu card. Better you make a rough idea of what you want to have before visiting in person. We ordered dragon rolls as starters, various combinations of platters  in travellers meal section as maincourse. It came as combination of naan/rice, dal makhni, achar, salad and side dish choices of lamb/chicken/prawn lababdar/roghanjosh/kadhai. The best part was each of such meal came for 250 bucks only!! :O

 Another platter of Frisky 333 was ordered. It cosisted of assortment items from stuffed salamis, to sausages, fries, chicken wings, mashed potato, poached egg and what not! It came as complete surprise package for us.

All food were soul soothing. Dragon rolls were awwesome. They came with a sauce in shot glasses. The platters from travellers meal were great.but we regretted ordering them since they are most commonplace and we could have ventured other specialties of the place in their stead. Frisky 333 was finished in just a blink of an eye by all! :D

Ambience- The lighing and ambience is too good. We were provided sofas for comfortabl seating along the wall. A tad problem for us was that,though the name specifically mentions-'bar and lounge', we felt quite uncomfortable at first during entering for the smell of alcohol. But we got habituated after a while. 

Bill- 10 people were all full at just rs.3160!! By the volume of food ordered, this was much lower than we expected.

Negatives- its very hard to find one. Only one might be that, no desserts were available at the time other than shahi tukra.. and none of us had any craving for shahi tukra.. hence had to fulfill our sweet craving from quality swirls outside..

Altogether, great experience. Surely going to visit again. A must recommendation for all

This is after my 4th visit here. And I absolutely love the food and mocktails served by them. Their menu is huge, and offers something for everyone, be it a full stacked plate or some light finger food one might be craving. I especially like the Dragon Rolls and the jacket potatoes they serve. The preparation is very nice and the service is very friendly and courteous. Surprised as to why this place is not being discovered   by more people.

This review is based on my visit on a Monday evening, may be that's why their service wasn't upto the mark. First thing firsts, in places like this music can really set u off! On tv they were playing some hindi music channel which made me feel slight unsure about the place. Anyways, its priced less as compared to other new places in area. They don't have mocktails/ cocktails menu yet.. and they make WORST hookah.. we told them to okay it 4 times, still they would press on us to go on wd it n take deep puffs as we don't know how to do it. And other guests were also complaining about the hookah there.. food tastes good, so marks just for that. One time for me!

The place is easy to located near RDB cinemas. The interior is cool with a nice vibe. 
The food tasted good and the service was good too.

Visited this place on Valentine's day with my friends.
We comforted ourselves on a corner place that had an aquarium beside and it looked beautiful. The place is well decorated with good lights. They organised a live show that evening, the singer sang good many romantic songs from the 80s which made the environment romantic enough.
Coming to the food, we ordered Hakka noodles and Pizza which really tasted good. The hookah was moderate and  it choked too!
Coming to the staffs, they were really friendly and hospitable. Overall it was a nice experience

Another bar and lounge in this infinity building, which offers more than it looks. I went for lunch here today and was delighted with their food and service. Our server jayanta was sure to make our meal delightful, as we had quite a few complaints with the food and hookah. 
I ordered blueberry hookah, tandoori chicken, chicken lababdar meal, chicken handi pulao and cold drinks. The presentation here was very simple yet subtle, very well executed. Taste of chicken items, rice was very good! But we had problem with the chicken in handi pulao as it was chewy, not cooked properly. The chef came to replace the chicken and apologised, which I felt was very courteous and right thing to do.
We had issue with the hookah as it had a very bitter after effect, so the bar person came to rectify the whole thing. 
Decor of this place is really good with dim lights, seating arrangements are also pretty comfortable. The prices are quite reasonable for such good food, our bill was just about 1000 bucks after having so much. So I would definitely recommend this place for good food and the ambiance!

Went there on a Sunday evening and was quite impressed by the interior decor....Ordered blue lagoon, Virgin Mojito among drinks and fish and chips and Grilled chicken wings as starters and chicken noodles as main course. Each and every item was absolutely mouth watering and the staffs were very humble and polite. The prices are also reasonable.

Getting liquor and hookkah at the same place in Salt Lake was unthinkable until we landed here. The prices of sheesha, food n drinks are all on the lower side. The food is good. The ambiance is good. It looks more like a family restruant and does not have the feel of lounge. Too well lit to be called a pub. There should have been a dance floor in the middle!

Located opposite the Omg social cafe. The building opposite rdb cinema.

Ambience was good. And the lounge is well blocked up with sufficient seatings.

Food -
Sphagetti Aglio E Olio - Good. Very tastefull and delicious. Little less in quantity.

Mini Pepper Steaks - Awesome. Those mini steak are soo scrummy and mouth watering.
Served with french fries.

We also had the hookah. Which was equally good.

The service was attentive and very friendly.
Quantity and Quality was good and the pocket pinch was reasonable.
Happy visit.

I went there on 13th January 2015. I loved the ambience. Sitting arrangement was cosy and beautiful. The lightings were perfect. There was Dj playing awesome music. I was told they even do live performances.
The food was awesome with great presentation. I ordered one pot meal and it was pocket friendly. My friends ordered Akhuri sandwich which they said tasted wowsome and was pocket friendly too.
The service boy was very courteous. They didnt charge any service charge. 
A pocket friendly place for good food and great ambience.

This is a recently opened bar cum restaurant cum sheesha lounge and is located at the first floor of the infinity building..I visited it yesterday evening with my girl for a light dinner and what i experienced was indeed soothing to the mind, body and stomach alike ...as far as the decor goes it is really eye pleasing..there is an artifical waterfall inside and the tables (atleast the one we sat at) have glass tops with multi coloured stones embedded within..all these, in addition to the dim lights impart a charming flavour altogether to this place and sets you up for a really enjoyable time..the seating area is moderate but consists of chairs, tables and couches with pillows as well (probably for the hookah smokers)..we did'nt have hookah but were offered the couch and we gleefully accepted it...coming to their food catalogue , it is humongous..it will take you atleast 20 minutes to go through the entire catalogue properly...they are in real sense a multicuisine restaurant...the best part of the menu was that on the right sheet of the 2 sheet pages, the food items were mentioned along with the description and on the left sheet , the pictures of the dishes were displayed..this is something i hardly have seen in any of the restaurants i've been to...you get a real idea as to what you are going to have, when you order something alien to u, just by the guidance of the description and the illustrations..as far as the food is concerned we had just ordered a CALZONE ITALIENNE (chicken) and a coke....the calazone was served hot and fresh and looked exactly the same as it appeared in the menu...it was served with chilli flakes separately and tasted delicious...the quantity was sufficient for 2 and cost just rs 159...the simple coke, priced rs 39 was served with a lemon in it which enhanced the taste manifolds..so they know how to make each and every food or drink item of theirs interesting to taste..as far as the pricing goes, I will say that it is very much affordable if i consider the quality and quantity they serve..they also have hookahs at just 199..service boys are very courteous and attend you with utter politeness..service time is a little more than one would like but once you have the food , you will feel like it was worth the wait...they have kept the old kolkata bar culture alive by having live music performances and we were lucky enough to experience a beautiful voice taking us through our food and it made our time spent over there so much more enjoyable..moreover they are offering 15% discount on their food bill till jan 31st...they take no service charges either...so please hop in and have a great time with your inner circle...i will definitely come back again..

Been here on 1/1/17 .... Food was not that great... Had murgh tangri pulao... Chicken tasted bland and tasteless... Also had exotic mocktail which was expensive for the drink they provide...however drunken prawns on devilled eggs tasted good but still it was expensive for the dish they provided. Considering the fact that its new... It has to step its game up to stay in the competition. I hv to say it has very tuf competitiors....Live music was good!
