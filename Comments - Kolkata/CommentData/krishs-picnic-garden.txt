Picnic Garden has a good number of eateries. My brother stays in Picnic Garden and we often visit his place and order food home everytime.

Krish's is one of my favourite places. Not a single dish has ever disappointed me. Prices are decent and they maintain both quality and quantity. Their noodles and rice overflows with chicken, prawns and vegetables. Their ingredients are fresh.
I love their Pan Fried Momo, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, both Mixed Gravy and Hakka Noodles, Chilli Oyster Chicken and Chilli Prawn.

I'm simply in love with their food.. their pan fried momo.. n mixed Friedrice and mixed gravy chow r too good. They give quantity as well as quality food. The amount of chicken and prawn put in the friedrice and noodles is commendable.

Please avoid  buying from here. Buy from Prity's Kitchen, Hot oven, suruchi, red.bamboo shoot, flamez but never from this! They charge you prices like AC restaurants and serve you tasteless stuff. 
Chicken Fried rice @150 only has quantity. Uncooked veggies and tasteless rice. Its plain rice with veggies and chicken. 

Chilli Chicken is okish except that you will get this quality for Rs 100 fr 8 pcs. Else, they charge Rs 180 for 8 pieces! And it's nothing extraordinary

*** 29th April, 2016***
Ordered
3 Chk Fried Rice
1 Chk Noodles
1 Chilli Chicken

The rice was overflowed with chicken pieces, I'm seeing this after a very long time! The taste of rice was just ok, Krish has lost the charm they had in their dishes back in 2014 and early 2015s. Quantity is commendable.

Noodles was the first time. Good at taste, not so.many pieces of chicken, unhappy. Taste and quantity wise, very good.

Chilli Chicken: Very mild at flavour and spices. They have lost their cooking skills for sure. Too much of veggies, low on taste.

Good local take away outlet. Average in cooking but ingredients are fresh. 
Serving quantity is also good, 2 for 3 heads is normal for every main course dishes. Good quality Darjiling   Momo is the main attraction üòä 

Home delivery is the only reason for low ratings

It's one of those places you pass all the time and think to stop by but they always seem closed. 

I thought maybe they close early because the food is so great they just don't need to stay open that late.

So on one day I called out "sick" from work, I had the great idea to swing by and pick up a bunch of take out boxes and binge watch tv while stuffing my face with chinese food.

I didn't get too far from taking a bite out of the 6 different items we got and well there wasn't much complexity

Yes 5. Thats the rating. Cuz i eat from here every week. Suffer from withdrawal if i dont. Their menu is really miniscule. But whatever they make they hit it out of the ball park. Try their egg chicken fried rice, gravy noodles, pan fried chicken, hakka noodles, crispy fried baby corn, thukpa, fried and steamed momo(just writing these i am drooling). These are better than any competition. So much so we have stopped eating chinese elsewhere. And they are not very moderately priced either. However quantity is really good. Two plates of the main dish can satisfy three really hungry men. However word of caution dont try their fish items which are generally stale. Plus this is absolutely a takeaway/home delivery joint. Do try their fare you just might stop going elsewhere

Today I called them around 9.30pm and ordered for 1 Chicken Noodles,1 Chicken Rice, 1 Sweet N Sour Chicken and 1 Chicken Drumsticks. I mentioned over the call repeatedly not to egg in any of the items because me and my mother both are allergic to egg. After waiting for exactly 1 hour 30 minutes just for few items, they delivered 2 Chicken Egg Rice and the other side dishes.¬†

When I called them up to replace the order as we cannot eat any of the rices because both were having egg, the person on the other side said that they cannot change the order now and the best they can do is that they will arrange for some "ROTI"!!! IT WAS KIND OF A JOKE TO ME!!!¬†

I was feeling so angry at that point of time that I just asked the guy to take back the food and again a funny reply came from his end. He asked me to have only the side dishes for dinner and he will only take back those rices.!!!¬†

Somehow I managed to return the whole food and take back the money.!!!  I'm looking for other food delivery joints.!!!
Wish I could record the whole incident and share it over here.

Amazing food, I had steamed and pan fried momos (sauce requires to be a bit sweeter) quite a number of times. On 9/12/15 I had Meifoon and Garlic Chicken both were great specially the Meifoon. This outlet can through a tough competition to any good Chinese restaurant in Kolkata.

Quality is detoriating, may be they are not able to handle pressure. It's a small outlet. It was doing good as there was no other better option. But now another outlet with home delivery option (with good quality, quantity and reasonable prices) has come so people might switch to Momo Lovers Delicacyz. Anyways all the best Guys üëç

Good enough haunt for locals.
food wise fine.
price is a bit high but the quantity and quality makes up for it.
no respectable seating arrangement and lack of space is a downer..
the staff are active and attentive..

Being opened in a bad locality, there's nothing much to expect. It's a takeaway joint so it does not need to be told about ambience.¬†

Coming to the food, it is pretty tasty and their quantity is huge. The chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken are a must try. Momos are also decent.

Pertaining to the price, the quality and quantity should not be complained about and it is an overall yes when it comes to an evening and the mood is to eat something from outside or an evening with friends.

Food : Good 
Quantity : Very good
Ambience : Very bad

Whenever I wanted to eat different than homemade food, 'Krish's' is the only name that comes in my mind..because of the taste & it is also closer to my home.. Love the Momos & Noodles..(actually everything is delicious).. 
As per the quality and quantity..the prices are reasonable..
It is located near 'bat tala bus stand' .very small place..no sitting arrangements..not so much variety..and it opens only after 5pm..

oh dude. i had a home delivery. they make the most wonderful chicken-egg noodles. these noodles are typical sizes of noodles unlike those thin ones given by every one. the vegetable is absolute right amount and the oil is clean. the chicken are fresh and looks good to bite. i throughly recommend this and if i am not worng it serves the best noodles in the area. i think they should raise the price. too good to be true. i am very happy with their service too. its fast and within ten minutes the guy is on the door. well atleast it happens for me.  never been to the restaurent so cant comment on it. but for takeaway its ideal and clean and fresh.

they make decent noodles,starters and momo.its a very small shanty size etatery just adjacent to bat tala bust stop along 39 route.there's no place to eat there,its just for home delivery and take away.they alo make thuppa,which is scarce in most places in kolkata and manage to make it quite amicable. not a bad place to order from if you need a take out.short menu,not too much variety,but u get the regulars
