Not a restaurant to be mentioned as a great place to visit. If you want to have cheap booze and cheap food to go with it then this is the place. Not saying that it is a bad place but not for your weekend family outing. Visit with your friends to get drunk without burning a hole in your wallet. Fish and chips was a good tasting dish. Ordered more than one side dishes. But only snapped the fish finger which was not that tasty. Coating was thick and the fish was definitely not pure Betki. Well at that price what would u expect. Cheers!!!!

This place used to be a delight for me and my colleagues, as it was close to our office. The drink combos are good. We usually didn't go for main course meals, for obvious reasons. So starters and snacks was our deal. And the chicken starters are awesome. We used to go during the day so there wasn't much crowd. This place has served us well. A good place to hang out with friends.

We went there on Thursday just for a hang out and chilled beer. We were not satisfied because of the ambience plus the lack of choices in everything be it snacks, food or drinks. They should work on it as they are charging rates similar to other pubs. Disappointed.

Borderline shady, yet homely and worth every single buck of yours. 
Pocket pinch and the end of the month? Mishra's is the ultimate destination.
Although the interior is unimpressive and overall ambience lacks the required finesse, but the food is surprisingly good, fresh and cheap. Perfect place to hang out with friends and peers, 
And one of the rarest eateries in Salt Lake that offers you cheap booze and mouth watering delicacies at affordable rates.

Alcohol used to be cheap here but there has been a recent hike in prices. Do try their fish fry. It is worth every penny. A richly marinated fish deep fried served with veggies and french fries. The service has always been very good. Located in salt lake, mishra's make a short weekend visit for a drink and snacks !

Mishra's located in Saltlake is definitely a place worth mention. A decent set up for family eat out and also for friends hangout. Popular due to the offers on drinks, Mishra's  also serves quality food. We have often tried their Indian dishes which good in taste and not harsh on pockets. Chinese and continental preparations are also worth a mention. If you are in search of a budget restaurant with decent decor and ambience then Mishra's can end your search. 

For party rockers Mishra's is the perfect choice as you can always find happy hours. Also the starters are just yum and you may end up drinking more than your set limit. The staffs are quite friendly and the service is prompt.

Place for cheap booze!!! In and around salt lake only place to enjoy booze at cheap rates with good starters! Though all the varieties of starters are not delicious but its okay considering the price you pay. Visit only if you want to booze more and eat less. Don't visit of you want to eat more and drink 1-2 peg it will disappoint you

Perfect place to hangout with friends and enjoy the variety of cuisines served here. Visited Mishra's on Navami this year with our gang. The place was a packed house but still their service didn't go wrong. All of us were hungry to the core as had no time for food in between pandal hopping. But coming to Mishra's for dinner was a right decision We had table full of food...a mix of Indian and Chinese cuisines. We had also ordered for drinks and you have to see it to believe the offers they run on drinks. The food were very well cooked and the quality was not at all compromised even in the rush hours. 
A good place to be in with family and friends.

I prefer this place than discs as I get to rejuvenate myself without the crowd and noise. Mostly visit Mishra's after my office with friends and just get rid of the day's tension.

Guys looking out for a party place in a quiet ambience can check out this place.

My first ever review on Zomato. Hi all you foodies, here I am to review one of the finest places in Kolkata to be is Mishra's restaurant in Saltlake. A perfect decor for that lounge feeling and the calm ambience is sure to make your day. 

Been there a number of times and have always had a gala time. The staffs are very efficient and the service is very fast. Drinks have always been the main highlight of this place. Everytime  I visit, I discover a new offer on the drinks. They have the best selection of drinks at standard rates. 

For the food section, You must not miss out on their Indian Cuisines. They are well cooked are extremely delicious. The chinese and continental are also good but as I am Indian foodie I always go for that. 

Located at the heart of Saltlake, Mishra's is a place which will never disappoint your guests. Be it a party with friends or some quality time with your special one, you can try out Mishra's for all your moods.

Hi folks...I am here to finally review one of my most favourite restaurant..Mishra's. I am attached to this place since childhood. As I am a resident of saltlake, Mishra's was an frequent visit for me. Most of the time with families, we hit that place at almost every gathering. Then my college life was fun at Mishra's with friends and drinks. Now as I attend my office at sector 5, Mishra's is again my party zone.

I love the ambience there with friendly staffs to attend you. I also love the fact that they never run out of the offers on their exclusive brands of drinks. The food is always an attraction for me as I am a foodie on personal level. Now a days I mostly order starters which complements with the drinks. Their best item is the biryani, Chicken Kalmi Badami Kebab, Crispy Babycorn and a lot more which will extend my review.

Always wanted to review Mishra's on Zomato but thanks to my lazy nature and tight schedule, but I am happy that I finally fulfilled my wish.

Mishra's is an attachment for me and I am sure to all my friends and family as well. If you are a foodie and want a good time, you can try Mishra's, you will not be disappointed.

Mishra's for me will always be an one stop party place. Countless shots of drinks and their Indian starters will be easy on your pocket. I am a regular visitor of this place since my college days. Be it a birthday celebration or result day depression, Mishra's always stood by us.  The staffs here are so friendly, we used to chat with them on funny customer behavior. Located at the heart of Saltlake, Mishra's is the best place to hangout at affordable prices.

One of the oldest bar in Salt Lake, beside Silver Sands. Been coming here since 2003-2004. There have separate sections for Restaurants and bar. Also has a decent hotel with rooms to stay for the day and/or night for guests. The alcohol used to be super cheap here with comforting food. Countless pegs of white mischief with their Chola Makha as teaser and Egg Pakora. This used to be our staple menu for almost each and every evening. Not sure what is the current status now, but for me, this place will always hold a special place in my heart.

Comparatively new to the other Mishra's bar. The ambience is very average. The seating , food, crockery , service is average as well. Most of the customers seemed to be local residents of the neighbourhood and they seemed to be happy. Cost wise it can be called one of the cheapest bars of salt lake depending on what one wants to drink.

Celebrated my first anniversary at mishra's on a friend's recommendation and man we all had the time of our lives. The food, the decor, the ambience and specially the gala offers on liquor is bound to make your celebration a success. We were a bunch of 23 young guns looking out for a place to party. Discs were not in the option due to budget constraints. 

Mishra's in Saltlake has all the recipe you would want out of a decent place to hangout. Every cuisine we ordered were extremely well cooked. The offers on drinks are to die for. We all had drinks to the ultimate limit along with the food. At the end of the day, the bill was surprisingly within my budget.

Highly recommended place from a true foodie and a drinks lover. You would come back to Mishra's for sure.

A nice and cozy place to take some time out of the busy schedule and spend in peace. With a full bar at your service, you can select from the wide spread menu to go with your drinks. A well maintained dining space with good decor and light music would help you regain your energy.

I went last week with my colleagues and spent over 5 hours just trying starters with our drinks. Both Chinese and Indian items were deliciously cooked to perfection.

A good recommended place to hangout in Saltlake, especially the ambience and the friendly staffs.

According to my husband and his gang this was the only watering hole they knew in salt lake area, about 10-12 years back. The place has remained unaltered. You can find men of all ages sitting n sipping their glass. The fish finger us the most famous accompaniment. Its a place mainly visited for a quick drink en route office to home or to catch up with old friends and relive old moments. We have also started visiting this place. Warning, service is not prompt and check the drink what you are being served. If they don't have the brand you have ordered, they replace it with another option. Ideally they should before serving

Yummylicious food with a perfect romantic set up. You can come with your partners and spend cosy time here, as the music is low and a serene decor. You can find Mishra's at saltlake sector 3. I had come down all the way from lake gardens for lunch with my boyfriend. We both had a blast and we had drinks on rocks with delicious Indian starters. Yet our bill was within our budget as most of the drinks were on offer. 
I would recommend Mishra's to everyone who is looking out for a special date. Great job guys...keep it up.

WARNING : TAKING PHOTOS ARE PROHIBITED HERE. THEY CAN SNATCH YOUR PHONE AT ANY TIME. (Yet m a wild zomatian; managed to take some)

* Location : Near tank no 14,salt lake sec 3, this bar cum restaurant is one of the oldest and may be the only slandered pub in this area.

* Ambience : Mishra's is one of the oldest pub in salt lake area and to my opinion before the rush hr starts,it also plays the roll of family restaurant because you ll not find loud music,Insufficient lights here as other pubs offer you. A large hall room neatly cleaned and normally decorated to attract customers; no eye catching decor. Actually they have got enough business promotion and famous in salt lake,so probably they don't want more.
But I m not sure how much you ll like to have a quite drink in the evening business hours here. Its because the chairs and tables are too nearby to my liking and comfort. The hall room is naturally very congested in the evenings. They ve made some cubicle typo against the wall,where you can get some privacy. Otherwise its a NO NO pub and restaurant for family.
There is also a room down at the ground floor for controlling the rush I think because in occasions, when people couldn't get sit in any pub,they always are welcome here (its surely an added advantage).

* Food : 1. Unfortunately there is no offer in drinks at recently. if you take any drinks (3 pegs),then you get 8% discount. Varieties of drinks of your choice are there. I had ordered bourbon whisky and the good thing is, they give nuts as complimentary.
2. I wanted for a suggestion to take the best item from this food outlet with my drinks and they suggested for Fried Fish, (2 large pieces of fish fry in one plate)...beautifully made,very tasty and smooth and made with rich and pure betki fillet. I liked it the best. 👍👍👍
3. Chicken kebab : Always I prefer some kebab items as a starter. All kebabs are very good cooked here. I was confused which one to take and lastly I took chicken pahari kebab. Those big 6 pieces were very smooth and juicy. so I liked it so much. (rating 8 on 10) 👍👍👍

* Service : Staffs are well mannered, cordially they said not to take pics. They also suggested very well which food would be the best with drinks here. (rating 10 on 10)

* Price : drink's price and food (as per quality and quantity are concerned) is moderate and pocket friendly (rating 9 on 10). So its one of the famous pubs in salt lake area and well known.

* Recommended : Fish fry (10 on 10)..... really very very tasty. 👌👌👌 You can take those big pieces with your drinks or if you visit with your family at lunch or dinner or simply to take away. Whatever you do,no matter. But try their FISH FRIES once, its just awesome,incomparable one. 👏👏👏

Excellent place to visit with friends and family. Starting from beautiful ambience to delicious food and well behaved staffs, Mishra's has it all. Located at Saltlake sector 3. You can locate this place quite easily. I have been here for 5 to 6 times now. Everytime I get to spend quality time with my friends.

Drinks is a major attraction here, as a lot of deals are offered. The staffs will help you out with the best deals. For non alcoholic drinkers, Mishra's also has a number of mocktails on their menu. You can have the best family gathering with cuisines like North Indian, Chinese and continental. All kinds of drinks are also there to chill your dil.

For me it's a best place to hangout in your budget.

A combination of good food and comfortable environment has been my weakness. Visited this place last month with a common friend and had a blast. We had unlimited drinks accompanied with a variety of starters and had no room left for main course. But still we tried the biryani here and was highly impressed with the taste. 

This week I visited Mishra's with my girlfriend on valentine's day. A nice and cosy environment with no noise around is an added point for this place. We started with a few rounds of beer with assorted kebabs like mutton sheek kebab, fish Irani kebab, Etc. We ordered biryani and mutton rogan josh for main course. When it comes to biryani, my girlfriend is extremely choosy and always heads for the authentic ones. I am glad that my recommendation did not fail and she loved the food and the biryani offcourse.

Mishra's is located at saltlake sector 3 and is definitely a value for money place.

Hi there people, this is Subrata. I love travelling and food is my passion. As I am a traveller I have tasted food from a lot of places in India. Recently I visited Mishra's in Kolkata with some of my travel friends. All of us were so pleased with the service and hospitality of the place that I decided to put a review on Zomato. 

We were 7 of us, and started with some drinks and starters. In starters we had ordered for tandoori paneer, fried fish, cheese omelette and fish irani kebab. The main course were even better with chicken strognoff, malai kofta, dal makhani, mutton kasa, murgh makhani, biryani and garlic naan. All the dishes were perfectly cooked and delicious in taste. What attracted us more was the ambience and the behavior of the staffs. All of them were well dressed and courteous. The restaurant is well maintained and very hygienic.

All in all a perfect place to visit and have delicious yet sumptious quantity of food.

We often went there for drinks... ambiance was quite good here... deco was pretty ordinary... staffs and service is average... we order fried fish for sure, rather than that we have the fish tandoori, crispy chilli babycorn, dry chilli chicken and noodles... except fried fish all the dishes are just above average... I went there only because it's suits our budget, although the price was high, but other available options are higher...

Mishra's bar and restaurant never disappoints me. Yesterday was my third visit to the place and I had an awesome time with my friends. Had come down to saltlake to celebrate Christmas at a friend's place and came to Mishra's for dinner. This is a nice cosy place which serves Indian, Chinese and a few continental cuisines as well. But the main attraction of this place is the drinks they serve. We got good offers on drinks which was the best part of our Christmas celebration. 

We had ordered fried fish, tandoori chicken, fish Irani kebab and mutton shikari kebab for starters. For main course we had ordered mutton nawabi, chicken biryani, palak panner and naans. The food was nice and was served piping hot and was also value for money.

The staffs needs a special mention. Their courteous and respectful behavior will make you come back to this place. This review is to acknowledge the restaurant which has maintained it's consistency to give you delightful offers on drinks which is hard to find anywhere else. Hence a strong recommendation to all party animals.

If you are looking for a multicuisine restaurant with a decent bar, then Mishra's is the place to be. Can accommodate for over 50 people at a time, Mishra's manages to keep up it's excellent service level. And for a party animal like me, the place is apt to host get-togethers and parties for your friends. Huge discounts and deals are on almost all famous brands. 

Coming to food, I have tried out most of the dishes here and all the dishes manages to maintain their authentic taste. Chicken Kalmi Badami Kebab and Mutton Shikari Kebab needs a special mention here. For maincourse you can go for the Biryani, Prawn Malai Curry and Chicken Bharta.

Whenever I think of a party, Mishra's comes first in my mind. The ambience of the place is soothing and the staffs are very courteous. So my vote definitely goes to Mishra's, if you are looking for one.

I am a pure Bengali and a foodie as well, but living in Delhi, I have grown up on having mughlai cuisines which are best served in North India. When I visited Kolkata during the Pujas this year, I went to this place called Mishra's for a family get together. Mishra's restaurant I found they serve multiple cuisines and a lot of brands in drinks. We were around 20 people and all of us had various dishes from there menu. What surprised me most was the authenticity they provide to every dish, be it Mughlai, Chinese or Continental. I must say Kolkata is bringing up restaurants which can serve Mughlai dishes no less then North India. If I choose my favourite, it will definitely be the kulchas, palak paneer, navratan korma and mutton nawabi.

The place has a soothing environment with light music playing. The staffs are very humble and cooperative. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Mishra's and hence putting up this review. A thums up place for me for sure.

Being a vegetarian, it is always difficult to find decent eateries who can serve authentic vegetarian dishes along with a proper decor. Mishra's is one such restaurant I have marked on my list of comfort food. It not only serves delectable vegetarian dishes, it also has an interior to vote for. I often visit this place with my family for a nice dinner. Sometimes I also hangout with friends and according to them the non veg dishes are equally delectable. My favourite dishes at Mishra's will be palak paneer, malai kofta, veg au gratin, veg manchurian...etc. They have cook, who are trained to prepare these mouth watering dishes in authentic style. Not very highly priced, Mishra's will suit both your taste buds and your pocket. So if you want my vote, then it's a 3 cheers all the time here. Happy eating all !!!

Mishra's is among those few restaurants which I would prefer to visit any time with my friends. Located at Saltlake, not far from Saltlake stadium, at Mishra's other than yummy food, I find my peace of mind. Loud hangout places are not my type. At Mishra's I get to spend quality time with my friends and enjoy the food served here. 

Also now that all my friends like to party with hard drinks, Mishra's is the best choice to choose from great deals that goes on all the year round. My favourite combination at Mishra's will be a bottle of beer and their special tandoori chicken and fish finger.
Strongly recommended guys...you will have a great time..

Mishra's is unique in its own way. The ambience and the decor is best suited when you want to spend some time in private with your close people. Accompanied by a variety and yet delicious spread of cuisines and drinks, Mishra's has everything to relax your mood.
 Also great offers on rare drinks will make you feel special.

My favourite is definitely the Biryani served here, but every dish that we took was high on taste. So it is surely a thumps up place for me.

An absolute fantabulous place to hangout with friends and family. Went to Mishra's restaurant last weekend with old college friends for a reunion. People from all over the city had joined and we all were amazed by the quality of food Mishra's had served. A perfect ambience to booze and have fun. Starting from kebabs to Fish fingers...a variety of starters will satisfy your crave for starters.

Will surely recommend to all the people who wants to enjoy food and life. Way to go Mishra's...I am definitely coming back.

Visited this place on the night of Navaratri with whole family. A decent hangout place in saltlake, Mishra's has more to offer than just normal food. A serene ambience with friendly waiters. What excited me about Mishra's is the series of offers on drinks and the variety of cuisines at nominal rates. Out of the lot, Indian food at Mishra's were the best that I liked. 
So if you are a food lover and looking out for a cosy place with your loved ones then Mishra's is a good option to hangout.

Chiefly a bar with lots of families with ladies and children attending. Ambience is okeis better to say-cheap. The alcohols are steeply priced though ok at the salt lake standard. But the main problem is they stock very limited types of beverages although there is so much options on menu. Same goes for the food menu. They serve Ginger and chat masala and bitnoon with drinks which is nice in my opinion. Starter (kebabs) were ok. The mixed noodles was fine. Chicken side dishes tasted average, not bad, but nothing great as all of them tasted exactly similar.

Hello all you foodies...just celebrated Mahalaya with all my friends at Mishra's Saltlake. We had come all the way from Tollygunge looking out for a calm place to enjoy our day with good food and drinks. We entered Saltlake and saw Mishra's and thought of giving it a try. This place turned out much more than our expectation. Mishra's has the perfect cosy ambience which forces you to stay for long. The food they serve is of fine quality and taste. Mutton biryani and fish Irani kebab requires a special mention. The mutton is cooked to perfection and the fish is of best quality. Mishra's is also paradise for hard drinks lovers like us. They have innumerable offers going on special brands.
I have already planned my Saptami dinner at Mishra's with my family. This place is surely to look out for this pujas.

Mishra's - One of the most old and famous bar cum restaurant in Salt Lake. A very clean and calm place where you can enjoy your drink with various starters. This place used to be a Govt place previously however, they have turned the place into a bar cum restaurant. The ambience, interior (feel like you ar in late 60s or 70s), Waitors, rate of drinks are fair enough. But the rate of food is too high compared to the taste and quality. I had visited this place long back in my college days and recently when I dropped in again, it reverted that Nostalgia. We were 4 office colleagues visited this place on a friday. They have a discounted rate of alcohol if you order 3 pegs at a time which fitted our requirement as one of us drinks beer only. In food we ordered for Fried fish, Fish finger, Chicken tandoori, and in main course that beer guy ordered butter naan and chilli chicken. The taste of the food was normal, no mention required separately but again, rates were high. Overall, a standard place for hanging out. Check the pics -

This restaurant cum bar is tucked behind the broad way. It is predominantly a bar and family dining should be avoided at best.

We visited this place twice in last 1 year and found nothing special worth mentioning. The ambience is okay, food is okay and service is also okay. Only thing great abt this place is da open air smoking place...

Just a 'nice' place to hang out wid frnz and is recommended....

Very rarely you will find a cosy place to sit and have quality time with your special ones at an affordable cost. I had visited Mishras at saltlake with some of my old friends for lunch. We found a number of offers on a variety of drinks and hence we thought of indulging. We had also ordered starters like cheese pin, fried fish and tandoori aloo. All the dishes were deliciously good and hence we ordered some more. We had no idea of the time as we were having a great time at the quiet ambience of the restaurant. By the time we ordered our main course, it was already 5pm. Time just flew by as all friends met after so long.
The staffs of the restaurant were very friendly and curteous. All in all a great place with awsome food and ambience. Strongly recommended.

We had some interesting Groupon food coupons of this place which included biriyanis of our choice. All we decided was to order side dishes of our choice along with the biriyani and take the food away. But Mishra's just killed all our expectations. Only good thing about this place was its calm and quiet ambience. The staff was not really friendly and supportive. Every item available in the menu was way too overpriced. It took them forever to pack our food and deliver.  Anyway, later we found a place to sit down and have our meal. The mutton biriyani which i ordered for myself was completely worthless, and contained a small piece of mutton which was pretty tough to chew. My friend could hardly find a chicken in her plate, but thankfully she found a really small Alu. Hate to say, in spite of the fact that biriyani is one of our favourite dishes, we had to dispose off almost half of the tasteless rice we were served with.
Not really a perfect place to crash in when you hungry, and certainly not a one which I can recommend.

One thing I like about this place is that they serve food very quickly. I had ordered different menu per visit, to check if they really are good with time or they pre-cook some of the items and serve quickly. But to my expectation, they serve all dishes within minimum time, without compromising on quality.
Now coming to the ambiance, previously I used not to like this place, because of the gloominess, and the depressing environment. It always used to give me a feeling of being among the most depressed people in the world, accompanied with some cheap Bollywood songs. But on my recent visit, I found they have well decorated the place with colorful lights, and large open space. But they have reduced the quantity per plate. Overall nice pocket-friendly place, where the boozers can find great deals like buy 1 get 1 on pegs.

I hosted my daughter's 10th birthday at the top floor which was used as a banquet. Initial reservations on the "ambience" (bar / liquor)? That was fought off very easily with the good ambience of the banquet and excellent food...I hosted about 60 guests, and the kids had a blast, completely isolated from the so called "bad ambience".I strongly recommend this place for small family functions, with a reasonable price, excellent food (my first parameter), very friendly staff.My special Thanks to Mr Sivaji!!

Good food, quick service and light on the pocket- a perfect evening with friends at Mishra's. They have amazing offers on drinks. The section on the second floor has separate cubicles which is great if you want some privacy. We tried their Reshmi and Tikka kebabs and Fish Finger, all of which were good, but the Reshmi kebab was a tad on the drier side and lacked the necessary creaminess. However, the portions were adequate. Complimentary accompaniments included masala chickpeas and roasted peanuts, but they would charge extra if you take more, even if you consume more drinks.

The servers are friendly with a "happy to serve you" smile on their faces. Overall a good place to chill without thinking much about the moolah. Would hop in anytime to try their mains.

I live in Delhi and had come to Kolkata for a relative's wedding. Post all the marriage celebration I had 3 days to enjoy in Kolkata. We planned up for a family party and someone from the family suggested Mishra's at Saltlake will be a good place to hangout. We were a group of 16 people went to Mishra's for dinner. We had full course meal starting from drinks and starters to deserts. I must say that all the food served at Mishra's are of best quality and taste. They have a tremendous variety of food and drinks. The waiters were extremely curtious and very much patient with a group of 16 people with different choices. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and had a blast with our closed ones.

Coming back from Delhi, I am totally impressed with Mishra's and have decided to have our future gatherings at this place. Strong recommendation to all.

I live in Laketown with my parents and younger brother. Often on weekends we keep on exploring new restaurants in Kolkata. On the suggestion of one of our family friend we visited Mishra’s restaurant in Saltlake. On the very first visit we were awestruck by this place. A total family hangout with a wide range of dishes and at so reasonable price. We tried different tandoor items among which tandoor paneer and fish irani kebab were my favourite. The ambience, the décor and the service…everything was just perfect. 

Now Mishra’s is among one of our chosen restaurant and we keep coming back here atleast once every month. I would like to suggest Mishra’s to all those who look out for a decent place to eat out with friends and family. I would give full 5 rating to Mishra’s and wish them to continue serving their best.

I love the fact that almost throughout the year, Mishra's is running offers on drinks which reduces the load on my pocket. Me and my friends just loves to chill out here. My favorite dish has to be biriyani that is served here. The taste is just awsome and I can keep coming back to this place for biriyani. I would like to raise a toast for this excellent restaurant in saltlake.

We 20 IT friends came for small get together at MISHRA’S, sector-3, salt lake. The quality of food is really very high & the staff was also hospitable. The most important thing is the reasonable price of hard drinks & food which is minimum 20-30 % lower than the Park Street restaurant where we had the party last time. Every 3-4 months we join at any of this restaurant & had the get together.

A real value for money with quick service in a really good place

I have been an old timer to this place, you will find really good Indian dishes at a very reasonable price here. It's really very easy to locate and you can park your car right on the main road in front of the eatery. You will often find people spending hours here with their friends or colleagues chatting over a couple of drinks and tandoori chicken, etc. I don't remember an instance when I have been to this place and I have not tried their tasty tandoori chicken. 

Last time I visited this place, I had ordered for tandoori chicken, Chicken tikka masala, Dal makhani and Garlic naan. The tandoori chicken was nice and tasty but tad dry this time, though the chicken was well marinated and cooked, it comes with a green chutney which can still be better. The chicken tikka masala was really yum, very soft pieces of chicken in a super tasty gravy,  not very spicy and just perfectly spiced. Also I really loved the Dal makhani and Garlic naan. The naan was sprinkled with minced garlic and bit of sugar that gave it one unique flavour which I really enjoyed.

The place has a very simple ambiance, not at all shabby but not sophisticated either. Good part is - there are enough seating arrangements so you don't need to reserve everytime. Service is okayish with average waiting time of about 15 minutes. Overall a nice place to chill and have a great adda, while having some drinks and great food at reasonable prices. 

Cheers!

Well, this is one place you would not definitely call a great place for its decor or ambiance on anything of that sort. To me Mishras is great because I learnt how to take alcohol here, I spent time with my friends here and during puja when every other place is telling you to wait, may be because of its location Mishras always had a place for me. And the plus points- alcohol price and dry chilli chicken. I have been to many more nice pubs and bars but it will remain a place close to my heart.

this is place i regularly visit with my friends. decent price, good food. perfect place to relax with your friends over a couple of drinks and nice starters. fish fingers and chicken omelette are must have. move over to kababs - tandoori chicken, fish irani kabab, kalmi chicken kabab, fish tikka kabab - all are well cooked always with right kind of spice used to make them taste very good. in chinese, chilly chicken, garlic chicken are good. in main course one can try both indian as well as chinese, won't get disappointed ever with the quality of food here. they have enough tables so getting a seat won't be an issue even on the weekends. the staff there are very friendly and helpful. parking is available on the main road. off late i felt the place has become a bit loud with people turning up the volume with their chitchats. both food and alcohol price is reasonable, no complain here. decor is simple and uninteresting, no brownie point for that.

Mishra's is one of those old yet classic places for rendezvous near Sector V after long day of work. It’s like coffee house at Saltlake. The reason for its attraction is its low liquor price and good food to accompany this. There were times and still people had to stand in queue for an hour to get a cozy table for the gang especially on Fridays. 
You won’t find its decor or ambiance appealing. The surrounding will be crowded and people will be venting out their work related frustration over a glass drinks or two. Quantity and quality of food is value for money. 
You need to be patient with staffs who are trying to address multiple customers at the same time. They won’t be that professional or organized to handle such peak hours. 
Recommended Chicken 65 along with your favorite poison.

A decent restaurant which serves a different range of foods. Quality of food is good enough  to remember. Quantity served in each portion is decent, just enough to fill you. Its an old restaurant in this locality, interiors needs a bit of a makeover. Spacious and airy hall. Experience i  this restaurant was not bad, except for the time taken to serve food after placing the order.

With an unostentatious location and less-than-polished interiors, Mishra's may seem like just another average restaurant for many. My family, however, has been coming her eagerly for 15 years. And we all swear by their Indian food. 
The fish finger is undoubtedly the best in town. It's crispy, flavourful and with perfectly cooked tender fish. The reshmi kebab...ah. My father and I like it really well-done, and they deliver. Every time. Grilled all the way through, with a delightful scattering of spices on top. Our usual accompaniments are paneer butter masala and masala chola with laccha paratha. I could write a poem about the buttery goodness of the paneer, the delectable spiciness of the chola and the soft decadence of the paratha. I know, I know. I sound way too poetic. But seriously, this seemingly ordinary place has wowed my tastebuds beyond imagination. And they've never, ever skimped on quality. 
Foodies, believe me. This restaurant will blow your mind. Do not miss this.

This restaurant is located near South Bidhannagar Police Station , near Amul bus stop , sector iii , Salt Lake City.  We two went to this place at today evening and interior of this place is good and decent. We had chilli chicken and egg fried rice. Taste was not bad. Chicken was really yummy. Apart from food we also had brandy ( honey bee) and bacardi breezer. We did not like brandy but breezer was not bad. There was lots of other foods on the menu card. As a whole you can give a visit for once. It is not so disappointing.

This used to be a great place, but with time the place has lost its charm owing to the poor and incorrigibly irresponsible behavior of the staff. The guards will always try to threaten you getting banned if you don't give a good tip and the waiters won't serve you unless you're a good tipper. The place has slowly degraded intro a shady and shabby bar. It's a pathetic place overall. Not recommended anymore.

People mostly come here for alcoholic drinks. Salt Lake really lacks a proper accessible bar. Most people chill here with their buddies over a pint of beer or a peg of rum and coke. At least that's what I've inferred from the crowd I've been coming across in my visits. By comparision ,the restaurant seems woefully empty. However,the food is quite good here.At least I found it quite tasty.And they have a reasonably extensive menu. Apparently they have a wedding reception hall in the adjoining lodge within the area complex.So I assume they cater to large crowds as well (Just a speculation,I haven't yet asked). All in all this is a good watering hole in salt lake,but in the same breath I'd like to add that the food here is good too,so guys and gals give that an equal try as well !

Its a place where I visited only for drinks with cheerful buddies, and as far my understanding most of the younger generation do the same (wth a few exceptions may b) for this particular place.
In that respect this place is a welcome option as there are hardly any good Bar in that region of Saltlake city.
