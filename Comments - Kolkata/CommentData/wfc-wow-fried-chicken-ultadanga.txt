I love the mojitos they made. Cheap food. Tasty as well. Near the station. Love to go there. If you're chicken lover then do visit with your friends.

Just had wings and chicken kebab... Amazing chicken wings... and the chicken kebab is also good... but wings at such a low price were the best... definitely recommendable as the prices are very student friendly... kfc will have a tough competition now

Went here for the second time in the hope of having some delicious chicken wings in this rainy weather..however was disappointed to be informed that they don't have anything in their stock and is awaiting to be refilled from their other branch..my question is why keep the joint open when you have nothing to offer?
Crest fallen is the right word to describe the situation.

The ambience is really bad. The service is ok. The value for money is good. The quality and quantity of food is gd. The burgers are simple but tasty. The crispy fried chicken is ok.

I tried their fried chicken & Chillax combo. Yes, quality was good. They need to work on their chillax bcz in combo, I felt bad about mojito, taste of that not so good. For parcel order, packet charge is 3 rs. That is not good in ultadanga area. But overall, good healthy food, kfc type food, pocket friendly. In the monrg end,when enough money not in ur pocket bt also u want to have these type of fast food, then must try.

Nice Quality of foods, specially the Fried Kebab is My Favourite. You can try the dip also , the meal is also very good. The place is near the Bidhannagar railway station , you can travel from any part of KOLKATA

New place in the town.
Small place but is infested with insects which is a major drawback.
Their fried chicken wings taste quite delicious,fried kababs taste average while chicken popcorn & the mojitos taste quite bland.
Delivery is tad slow as the staffs are few in number.
