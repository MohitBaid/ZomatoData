The wait was finally over. I managed to make some time to pay a visit to this place. Since I was not acquianted with the Sreenagar area of Garia, I tracked down the restaurant using the app follwing the map. Its hardly 3-4 minutes from the Garia station. Walk straight along the Sreenagar Road without takiny any turns. You can spot it easily as it located on the road side. The resturant will be on your right. 

The outlet is very small having two tables outside with a few stools if one prefers have it there. I would personally suggest to pack your food and bring it home and enjoy. As I approached a bus went speedily and it flew massive dust which went over the restaurant as well. So imagone if you were having something and gets covered with dirt. I guess you won't want that to happen.

Since my pocket didn't suffice much I opted to try very ordinary item. I ordered Chicken Chowmein. Delivery time is quite impressive. I was delivered in around 4-5 minutes.

After I opened I discovered the mystery inside. Though the packet seemed small it was heavy when I was carrying it. And it was evident when I opened it. I preferred Hakka. The noodles were considerably thin. But don't go wrong with it. The chunks of chicken pieces will leave you satisfied. If you are willing to have a pack for 2 people then a full plate is fine but if you having it for yourself then I recommend you on having a half plate. It will I hope satiate your hunger.

The noodles weren't that very extraordinary kind of something to really applauad but were much more better and good in taste than the average local food outlets. What I liked moreover was the sauce they provided. They didn't provide chilli amd tomato sauce seperately rather packet them 50-50 in the pouch which looked really nice. The combination of the sauces really added a dofferent flavour to the noodles. 

Last but not the I would happily recommend people to try out this place. Happy eating!

Well this is my first time to Hot wings. Situated near garia station, towards Nayabad 1 no bus stand. They have sitting arrangements outside,and that too for few people. We ordered chilli chicken only,and packed it for home. The taste was okayish..chicken pieces were sufficient and price is pretty low really. :D

Outside seating is very bad, although the food was average, Tandoori was a bit more burned, and Biriyani was average, we ordered mixed noodles was good, but the price is very less, if you're planning for a college hangout then it's good

Add schezwan (Rs 15 extra) with any of the chow will double its taste and makes it much more spicy......

Hot Wings is the most value for money restaurant in Garia. The food is awesome and is very very cheap. The service is fast and the people are warm and welcoming. I had been ti Hot Wings with my friends and we had a great time there.  The onle thing I dislike about Hot Wings is the lack of proper seating space. They have an arrangement for outdoor seating but it isn't up to the mark. I.hope they do something about it soon.
