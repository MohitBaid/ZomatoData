Behold in the picture an Iced Tea. Just a regular Iced Tea that costs Rs. 425+ Taxes. YES, you heard that right. We hanged out at Brewin which is an extension of Park Plaza's reception area. It's nothing exclusive, not a Cafe to be honest, and the only amusement is seeing people check in and check out, for a view. The regular menu did not feature the cappuccino or the iced tea we ordered. And on asking them they said it's Rs. 114+ Taxes. So please ensure you view their menu for prices before ordering anything. Pretty disappointing experience since it wasn't worth the money.

Went for a quick breakfast. The guards stopped me at the main entrance and wanted to know where did I intend to go, I tried to make them understand in English, Hindi and Bengali, however they had no clue about the cafe. When I told them that I don't need assistance and I am aware of the place, they did let me in, half reluctantly.

Well, half of the items mentioned on the menu were not available. I wanted to have a salmon and boiled egg sandwich and an apple pie, however none of the items were available. I settled for a chicken croissantwich and cold coffee. The croissantwich was good; nice and fresh flaky pastry and a generous quantity of chicken cubes. The filling could have been more creamy though. The cold coffee was very basic and the consistency wasn't great. There were no options for addition of chocolate syrup or ice cream to the coffee. I wanted to have a pastry but the blueberry slice or the cherry slice did not appear appealing enough.

Overall an okayish experience.

Brewin ....is situated in the left hand corner of the lobby of Park Plaza.,just beside the main entrance. Small place but with good stuff. The pastries in the display shelf looked tempting and tasted good too. I liked the Brownie and puff that I had. Their stuff is steeply priced but that's expected in a hotel like Park Plaza. ( so you feel its ok,anyway as long as it's good to eat)

Brewin is a best place, and ms Moumita has given awesome service with ge8 smile. A sudden meet with my cousin and the urge to have a good conversation after work brought us here. Also it was very close to our meeting place. It is behind pantaloons gariahat, off gariahat road. A quiet and open café at ground floor with a very casual seating arrangements. Brewin serves a range of premium teas, coffees, smoothies and freshly squeezed fruit juices. Light snacks, savories and pastries are also available during the day., and ms Moumita has given awesome service with ge8 smile. 

Thank u.

During my stay at Park Plaza , I would cross this little pastry corner 3-4 times daily. Today I got an opportunity to stop and look at it closely.... it's quite nice actually. A host of chocolate desserts, cakes, pastries, donuts, I even spotted a black forest cake. They were kind enough to allow us to taste their assorted chocolates which were decent and had a freshness to them.
We picked up a chocolate cake for my niece's birthday and it turned out to be fantastic. Light and soft and flavoursome.

I shall be visiting this little corner again in the afternoon tomorrow to finish this review .

Until then, a solid 3.5 /5

Brewin is a bakery in the Park Plaza hotel located in Gariahat. The decor is very modern n clean and is on the lobby floor. We ordered 2 Lattes, a Chicken Puff, a Chicken wrap and a Chocolate tart. The food did not stand out and was very ordinary. The Puff was not very fresh and the Chocolate tart though big in size, the biscuit was soft and crumbly, not fresh at all. Park Plaza should train their staff properly  if they wish to compete with big names. The server took our order and disappeared for 20 mins. On being asked if the Chicken was halal, he did not have a clue what halal was. Anyway, I would like to visit Nyongyang and hope the food does not disappoint there

A sudden meet with my cousin and the urge to have a good conversation after work brought us here. Also it was very close to our meeting place. It is behind pantaloons gariahat, off gariahat road. A quiet and open café at ground floor with a very casual seating arrangements. Huge soft comfortable sofas are ideal for chilling out and having a chitchat over a cup of coffee. Beautiful simple but elegant décor mesmerized me, the chandelier hanging from the high ceiling, the side lamp were very unique. Order had to be placed at the desk. We went for chicken cheese sandwich, chicken puff, black forest pastry and coffee. Sandwich was average and the bread was not that fresh though the filling was tasty. Puff was also not fresh,not even the filling. But i loved the pastry. It was fresh, tasty and not too sweet, loved the large chocolate flakes on it. Coffee was good which was served with white sugar, brown sugar and sugar free. I just loved the aroma. I loved the tilted uneven shape of cup and plate in which they served the coffee. Service was good and fast.
