Visited this place yesterday with my friends. The interior was well decorated. Ordered chicken capsicum cheese pizza, paneer pizza and chicken drum of heaven. The worst pizza i have ever tasted in my whole life. The garnishing contained purple cabbages and cherry which was quite odd. Couldn't able to eat after 1 slice. And the drums of heaven was ok type.
It was totally a waste of money.
