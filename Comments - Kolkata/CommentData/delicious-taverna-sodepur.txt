I have tried crispy chicken and it taste fully waste..
The resturent is fully empty.
When you will enter in to the resturent you will feel too much uneasy.
Next they donot have every menu which shown in the menu card.
They will pressurised you to take high priced menu.
Aftr my order I have to wait for a long.
Next the food taste is not so good. I have just wasted Rs. 340.
Next they are asking for give good review in zomato to get 10% discout.
All the good reviews you are getting here all are fake.
I have also given 4.5 rating at shop to get 10% and now I am changing this.
So its my request dont go here else you will also waste a sunday evening like as me..

Location : dis multi cuisine family restaurant situated just opposite to sodepur dominos..

Decor & service: decorum of dis place is something different which can blow ur mind... Wooden ceiling , suprb interior with warm lit lights are quite impressive..
Staffs are well behaved.. Service was good enough..

Food: we ordered hakka chicken noodles, chicken with hot garlic sauce..

Hakka chicken noodles:(4/5) it was awesome.. Properly cooked noodles mixed with loads of veggies and chicken.. Quantity wise it is more than enough for two..

Chicken with hot garlic sauce:(4.5/5) 8 pieces of soft boneless chicken served in a bowl.. It was spicy and delicious..

Price: pricing is moderate..
Highly recommended!!

Staffs were very well-behaved and welcoming with a smiling face,always!

Heard from one of my friend regarding this outlet located opposite dominos sodepur. Expected a lot from this restaurant but totally impressive with whole over interior to food full package i think. Service people very much polite to us and attentive. Setup well am pleased!!!!! 
Suggested food items:

Whole Tandoori Kolkata Bhetki
Spicy fresh bhetki marinated with yogurt and spices. Size may be around 500-600gm. Its taste so amazing that i am totally speechless.

Panko crumb fried fish
I am totally satisfied with suggestion what they served to my family members. Its so crunchy taste like KFC served with spicy secrete dip on by side.

After that we generally ordered rest item like fried rice and chilli chicken. Chicken too soft but bit oily...!!!

From indian section we had Mutton Biriyani taste really so good amazing but its my suggestion serve raita with biriyani as a accompaniment.
Hope to see you again very soon i am going to be visit very soon....##

Few days back I went to this restaurant after couple of year. Really I was totally shocked with the interior it's awesome wow effect. Starting from entry it's rustic wall decor shadow painting with hanging bulb on top-amazing in short.
It's not finish yet decor with bamboo and colourful filament bulb.
After enter to the restaurant am totally speechless and shocked am questioning myself is it "Delicious Taverna" can't believe only I can say WoW effect to me....
Sits very much comfortable and entire wall was rustic  and hanging filament and also having wooden sitter and roof decor with water pipe with bulb..I think not yet complete total decor still in process but you guys rock. At last best restaurant in sodepur area we want to see you in top.
Coming to food really yummy vast changes everything. Service guys were very much polite to us and they well trained always smiley face well known with etiquetes. Today onwards I will be your regular guest hope to see you very soon. Just keep rocking!!!!!!!!!

Delicious taverna is located just opposite to Domino's and Bata sodepur branch, therefore it is very easy to located. The restaurant is a hidden gem in the locality which has renovated itself to a whole new avtar this year. The review is based on my second visit. I went there last Thursday for Astami lunch as it was raining heavily and have no other option left in hand because I was bored with the other restaurants of the locality so thought of giving it a try.
Earlier I have just visited the restaurant once and was aware of the fact that their food is no doubt good nut the interior. This time when I entered the restaurant I was surprised to see its new version totally changed decor and it was so cool. Now coming to the main part it's food, the food was no doubt good in all aspects. The quantity, quality with good price. Its a must visit restaurant in sodepur now as this area lacks good restaurants.

The restaurant is a hidden gem in the locality which has renovated itself to a whole new avtar this year. The review is based on my second visit. I went there last Thursday for Astami lunch as it was raining heavily and have no other option left in hand because I was bored with the other restaurants of the locality so thought of giving it a try.
Earlier I have just visited the restaurant once and was aware of the fact that their food is no doubt good nut the interior. This time when I entered the restaurant I was surprised to see its new version totally changed decor and it was so cool. Now coming to the main part it's food, the food was no doubt good in all aspects. The quantity, quality with good price. Its a must visit restaurant in sodepur now as this area lacks good restaurants.

Very old restaurant in sodepur area amrabati. They were having 32 capacity for sitting and also they have small banquet.
Restaurant started well at the beginning but suddenly food quality goes down frequently. But slowly slowly they maintain the standard, come up with new food dishes really it's full on and it pocket friendly. Tastewise beyond my expectation level amazing.
We had chicken kadai, butter naan and Briyani and two mocktail. Staff too friendly and caring attentive.

Also come with some continental dishes I didn't try like- squid, octopus, tandoori pomfret and crab and few conti dishes I didn't remember the name as service guy told us. I will surely visit very soon to taste the conti part.
But they have to work lot on ambience it's too old do something. Most probably I guess they already started with the decoration part.
Overall very good.go job guys keep it up

The ambience is not that great.The A.c was not working property the day I went here. The menu includes almost everything from the normal Indian and chinese cuisine. The quantity of food served is good but the quality is not that great. Service is average.

Visited here several times.. chinese dishes are very tasty but biriyani is not too good. We have tried chicken clear soup, fish fingers, mixed fried rice, schezwan chicken, sweet and sour chicken, mixed gravy noodles,chicken in hot garlic sauce,chicken manchurian,chilli fish.. I have also tried their tandoori naan ,chicken bharta and chicken kebabs..they were also good.One must try the fish finger here.. it is really delicious and the quality of fish is very good and so fresh.. hot garlic chicken was also very tasty.. mixed gravy noodles and chicken clear soup were okay.. reasonable price.. both the quality and quantity are satisfactory and the service staffs are well behaved and helpful.

One of my favourite places near my home. The food is very tasty specially the indian and continental ones. Staff is well behaved and they give you a homely comfort. Ambience is the only thing that they need to work upon and i'm sure they have plans for that too.

Bit expensive compared to a suburban restaurant. Visited December 30 also I was impressed by everything mentioned above. We had banzara kabab, achari kabab, butter nun, butter chicken & Mutton Shahi korma. All were good butter chicken was best shahi korma was very sweet you may want to try something else.

This restaurant has revamped. Their interior was so appealing it makes a lively ambience. I've been here during Durga puja so I expected quality to vary but the kabab, nan, Mutton kosha & chicken tikka masala was delicious as it's name suggests. May be the best restaurant of sodepur at this moment.

Tried fish finger & crispy fried chicken. Crispy chicken was awesome üëå Their Biriyani is also good 

Accepts cards also not only cash. Frustrating thing was we had to walk down to the washroom they didn't serve wash bowl.

Delicious Taverna is at walking distance from Sodepur Kanchkol. I had been there few times earlier. Today I ordered Hakka veg noodles and chicken Hong Kong. They served before the time they promised. Food was good, both in quantity and quality. But they need to update menu and contact on Zomato.

We ordered mutton dum biryani, pan fried veg noodles, prawn fried rice, chicken manchurian and fish in hot garlic sauce. All the Chinese dishes were very spicy and pungent and were a bit uncomfortable for us to eat them. But all the dishes tasted good. Biryani was okay, quantity was less though..

Another small restaurant near Amrabati crossing in sodepur. Small, clean place serving standard foods at reasonable prices. Good for families. Not popular with youngsters.

It's a standard one. Nothing much to describe but did not liked it much. Ambience is good but food quality is not upto the mark, specially Indian dishes. A negative remark to it.

This is one of the best restaurants in Sodepur. The variety in soups, Chinese and others is far more than other restaurants offer. Food quality is awesome. Service time is good as well. I will prefer going there again.
