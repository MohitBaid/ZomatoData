Reason being the quantity and little bit quality vs the price.
They serve really good Duncan Chicken and I love their chicken fried rice.
Their service is really quick, and if you want to dine then there's the upper room which is well decorated and fully air conditioned.
Rolls are pretty decent and size of roll is adequate.
This isn't your 'authentic' chinese eatery, it's your comfort chinese food where you can purchase mid quality good quantity chinese food even when you're broke.(like really broke)
Everything apart from a few flies here and there, is good.
If you're in Wellesley area and want good chinese food at cheap rate, you'd want to go to Food King.

Food King is located very close to my uncle's house at Ripon Street. The joint is a far cry from the places that I have been visiting of late. 
However that's where the saying "Don't judge a book by its cover" comes into the picture. 
The place serves some decent quality stuff. 

The fried rice and noodles are okay. They're fairly good but nothing to say much about. 

The rolls are also pretty good. I for one really like their Chicken Roll. 

But my favourite has to be the Chilli Prawns! They are really good! The Prawns are batter fried and some may not like the soggy texture but I love it. The gravy itself is also really good. 

As a whole, the place is definitely worth trying out but only if you happen to be nearby. I don't think it is worth coming from a far off place though, as the food is fairly good but nothing spectacular!

A fair score would be 3.25 but since that is not an option so 3.5 it is! 

Happy Dining!!

Came here a couple of times. Last time went for Chicken Fried Rice , Garlic Chicken and Chicken Roll . Taste wise it was okay best for takeaway. Small joint. Overall an okayish experience.

Well, Â this place happens to be near my office and we order more often than not. And ours is a fixed order- Duncan fried chicken and hakka noodles.
Well given the price, the chicken is pretty good- a tangy & spicy taste. hakka noodles are border line good- can do much better for the price they charge. The place is a shabby fast food joint, hence there's very little possibility of someone dining there itself. Most of their orders are home delivery or takeaways. My advice- Go here only and only for the Duncan Fried Chicken. Cheers!

Food is good. 
Quality and quantity is decent. 
The ambience is not that great hence I prefer take aways. 
This place is ok for a random lunch or dinner meal. 
Nothing fancy but tasty.

Good food at a reasonable price. Just 5 mins walking distance from my home so its like a homely place for me. Home delivery also available. Though not much place for a large gathering but good for a quick bite with frnds.
