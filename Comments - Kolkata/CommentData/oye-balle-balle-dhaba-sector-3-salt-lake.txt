Had a sudden visit yesterday night. This place is located near central park. 
The decor inside is  very beautiful. You can have the real Dhaba feel here. Everything here has a touch of some real feel. Lightings were impressive.
Now come to food.
We ordered ,
Butter nun - served into a pretty little basket. Impressive quality of food I must say. Loved this.

Chicken bharta -  deliciousüòã. They put an egg as topping. Nothing can be tastier than the combo of butter nun and chicken bharta. It's a heaven üòÇ shredded chicken into the tasty gravy felt so yummy.

Butter chicken - this just stole the show. The chicken pieces were like soyabean , too soft and juicy. A perfect blending of spices and sweetness. 

Chicken tandoori - another showstopperüòé. fabulously delicious. This comes with salad. Juicy and succulent. Nothing to say more about this dish I guess it's an universal favourite. And seriously they serve some real great foodüëå 

Quality and quantity both are generous.
Decoration was pretty impressive too. In every wall there's a Tv and so that I  could watch sports lol üòÇ. Basically there are total three or four Tv at the entire place which was really convenient.  The staffs were really courteous and we were impressed by their behaviour. Surely this place has been on my "abaar jabo" listüòç 

Definitely recommended.

Located in sector 3, salt lake.

Had only chicken biriyani and that also takeaway.
So can't detail on the servicing and the interior ambience.

Now coming to the food.
1. Price is too high compared to the over all thing of the biriyani.
2. Chicken pieces were not satisfying. It was a bony one .
3. The taste and quality of it was moderate.

Over all, the whole thing seemed so-so to me. So it's a 2.5.

The ambience of this place is good. We ordered tandoori paneer, garlic naan, paneer butter masala and special chicken biryani. The starter tandoori paneer tasted really well but rest others were average in taste. Tables n glasses were dirty. I think they should work on hygiene and serving the food on time. Rest the experience was good and yes the price is very reasonable!

Located near Karunamoyee, Saltlake, this Dhaba has a conventional menu just as others in Saltlake. The menu does not offer you anything out of the box, and the quality of food is pretty mediocre. To be frank, you would not find any difference between Rara Mutton and mutton keema! I  rated it 3 since it remains open till late hours in night.

Food- Bad.
Service- Bad.
The rating 1 I had to give was maybe for the decor. 
It in undoubtedly the worst biriyani I have ever had (and I do eat from a lot of places). This wasn't biriyani, this was merely pulao. The potato was almost shredded(quiet clearly it was taken from some other dish and dumped into the biriyani). The colour was white, absolutely tasteless and the rice grains were sticking to each other, like one big gluey mess. 

Very disappointed with the place, never coming back here again and would not recommend it to anyone! There are lots of eating joints nearby, it will be best to stay away from this restaurant!

A regular at this joint. Once a month atleast. But the disappointment caused today is unexplainable. My cousins who were dining there got me a takeaway. It undoubtedly was the most pathetic food I ever consumed. In edible. So much garlic in a dal that a lasoon chutney would not have. They might just apologise but it‚Äôs not acceptable. At all. A roadside eatery could provide much better !!!!!!

Not satisfied with the food. I was given a naan bread when i ordered a lachcha paratha (given in the pictures below). I dont know if its me or they just seemed to don‚Äôt know the difference between the naan and the lachcha paratha. The butter chicken was soggy. Im definitely not going to eat here again. Everything is over priced in ‚Äúoye‚Äù and i was astonished to see an extra menu for chinese cuisine ( thats the last thing someone would want to see in an indian restaurant)

It was my baby brother's birthday and I was in Kolkata. Since we were a lot of people, we decided to order food from outside and just make breads and rice at home.

Ordered the baby corn started and loved it to bits while didn't enjoy their Tandoori aloo much.

For main course we ordered Veg Jhalfrezi which was spicy for me. Loved the paneer butter masala and malai kofta.

The bill was 1752 for 3 portions of starters and 5 portions of gravies.

What I recommend is that you first try their rolls, which they make at a counter outside their restaurant & this counter opens only after 4pm. And of course I am talking about their non veg rolls since that's what I've tried. So good were the rolls that I decided to go to the restaurant and try their main menu. If you come here during lunch hours, you may find the place packed and thus the service may be very slow.
The food was okay & the place was fine. The food is good but not bad. If you feel like eating North Indian food and are around salt lake sector 5, you can give this place a go.

This place is a perfect example of not judging a book by it's cover.
The decor, the big truck outside,the ambience is deceiving and contradictory to the food served.
The food :-
Biryani is highly overpriced based on it's quality and taste. The Mutton piece was so dry as if it was separately boiled and served. The Quality of rice used made me sad. Real sad!
It was more like yellow rice.
....
A typical North Indian restaurant serving Chinese is bound to screw the dishes.
And they did a fine job screwing the same!
They added anything and everything to Chicken Schezwan Noodles to make it spicy. I have eaten lot of authentic Chinese and nowhere did i find dried and fried red chillies added to Schezwan Noodles. It was nowhere near to the taste of authentic Schezwan.
Going back to the ingredients,with some effort you can actually count the pieces of chicken in one index finger .
Oh! btw, call me up if it exceeds the 4th mark on your index finger.Mine stuck at 2!
Now,if you are wondering why there weren't any side dishes or starters ordered,the risk of disappointment was greater than myself!

We went to this place in search of a late night restaurant. And I say it was a very successful search. We were 4 people and our bellies were shouting 'FOOD' and we gave it ample amounts. Here goes the list:

NOTE: VEGETARIAN ITEMS ONLY!

Nilgiri Sheek Kebab: A suggestion by the person serving us, it was a kick start. Everything about the kebab was perfect. To be truthful it even felt pretty healthy.

Crispy Chilly Potato: We actually ordered baby corn, but due to its unavailability, it got replaced by potato. And trust me it was for the better. I anyways love potatoes ( I look like one too), but this dish increased my love for potatoes 10 times. If you love potatoes, go ahead and order it already.

Kabuli Naan: I thought cheese garlic naans are tasty, but then entered my life this crispy tasty piece of bread with overloaded peanut and cashew shreds and my life changed forever.

Special Dal Tadka: Stupendous. In just one word. I really never thought tadkas can be so delicious. Well there was double tadka here. And it complimented the Kabuli Naan too well.

Paneer Veg Pulao: The quantity was good and so was the taste. The amount of paneer and vegetables was also good.

Veg Jhalfrezi: Another tasty preparation. This and the pulao were a beautiful pair.

Paneer Lababdar: This was a red gravy of paneer. It was also good but nothing extraordinary.

Green Salad: Now we were so hungry that we had a plate of salad before the main course was served. Then we ordered another plate. And we also asked them to sprinkle a generous amount of chat masala. To that they really served the salad with a generous amount but also brought an additional bowl with chat masala in it. Cool right?

We also had rumali roti and tandoori roti which were as usual. I am not a huge fan of Indian food but today was really an exception. I ate till there was no place left in my tummy. The ambience, the food, the staff and the company were all perfect to the T. Thank you!

Quirky colourful interiors done in dhaba style , ample of seating space and eye-catching wall arts are sure to impress at the first glace.
However service is quite slow and food that we had were just average.
STUFFED TANDOORI ALOO was quite highly priced at Rs 210 with no significant stuffing where normal tandoori aloo is at 150  , and just two small drumsticks served in TANGRI KEBAB for Rs 220 is again too less for the price. CHICKEN LABABDAR was excessively oily and like any other indian red gravy , nothing home to write about. Kashmiri pulao was not available and replaced by PANEER VEG PULAO . GAJAR HALWA wasn't available as well , we opted for PHIRNI which can be made to taste much better . The corners of their menu card were worn out and needs to be laminated.

Green Salad: Now we were so hungry that we had a plate of salad before the main course was served. Then we ordered another plate. And we also asked them to sprinkle a generous amount of chat masala. To that they really served the salad with a generous amount but also brought an additional bowl with chat masala in it. Cool right?

We also had rumali roti and tandoori roti which were as usual. I am not a huge fan of Indian food but today was really an exception. I ate till there was no place left in my tummy. The ambience, the food, the staff and the company were all perfect to the T. Thank you!

Quirky colourful interiors done in dhaba style , ample of seating space and eye-catching wall arts are sure to impress at the first glace.
However service is quite slow and food that we had were just average.
STUFFED TANDOORI ALOO was quite highly priced at Rs 210 with no significant stuffing where normal tandoori aloo is at 150  , and just two small drumsticks served in TANGRI KEBAB for Rs 220 is again too less for the price. CHICKEN LABABDAR was excessively oily and like any other indian red gravy , nothing home to write about. Kashmiri pulao was not available and replaced by PANEER VEG PULAO . GAJAR HALWA wasn't available as well , we opted for PHIRNI which can be made to taste much better . The corners of their menu card were worn out and needs to be laminated.

LOCATION: right at the heart of salt lake sector 3 and beside steak and grill.

Went there at an extremely busy hour but luckily got a table for four within 20 mins. This particular restaurant is basically an expensive and more ornamented version of balle balle dhaba.
Food items tried:

1. MUTTON ROGAN JOSH‚Äî a spicy yet extremely tasty dish. Contained 3 big pieces of mutton which were soft and juicy.

2. TANDOORI CHICKEN BUTTER MASALA‚Äî this was a finger licking good item and tasted heavenly. It had two huge pieces of chicken and went perfectly with the butter naan ordered.

The staff members were very co operative and yet they were practically running from one corner to the other serving dishes and cleaning tables.
Additional items- BUTTER NAAN, GREEN SALAD, SOFT DRINKS.

Refer to my account for pictures.

On the evening of Ashtami when it's raining outside we decided not to go for pandal hopping nd decided to try oye balle balle dhaba for the 1st time via swiggy. But like rain spoiled our ashtami, also this dhaba failed to satisfy our stomach. We ordered Mttn Biryani, Chkn Biryani, 1 Masala Kulcha, 1Butter Naan & 1 Chkn Lababdar. All the foods were not value for money at all, both quality & quantity wise. Specialy I never seen such a small size of Masala Kulcha & Butter Naan in this price range. Also Chickens in Chkn Lababdar were undercooked. When you found a chicken undercook u can easily imagine the qualityüò¢üò¢üò¢

Nice concept. Methi parathe were made in a different yet special tasty way. The chicken pieces were aptly cooked and mixed with the gravy taste so well. Only improvement could be service. They could do better to get the staff some cotton wear and get them to attend to us faster.

Had been there for team dinner today and had a fantastic gastronomic experience. Located in the heart of Salt lake sector II, this place serves authentic Punjabi dishes.

Starters - We had ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Lasuni Kabab, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Crispy Chilli Potato. All were up to our expectations, but the Tandoori Chicken was just awesome - nicely roasted chicken marinated to the core - neither too dry not too juicy - just perfect.

Main course - Ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Reshmi Masala, Malai Kofta, Mushroom Masala, Garlic Nan, Kashmiri Pulao and Chicken Biriyani. Again all were up to the mark. But the Chicken Reshmi Masala stole the show. We were too full to order anything else. This place is definitely worth a second visit.

Ambience - 8 / 10
Food - 9 / 10
Service - 8 / 10

Overall - 8.5 / 10

Must have - Tandoori Chicken, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chicken Reshmi Masala

Tip - Order the main course while waiting for the starters to avoid delay.

We took a home delivery from this place. Quick Delivery. Packaging was just about satisfactory . 

We ordered a tandoori chicken full which had four chicken breasts. The size wasn't very big but tasted decent enough. Then 10 roomali rotis and two chicken bharta. The portion was good enough. The bharta tasted lil too sweet for my liking and the rotis were of decent size. The total bill came around 1380.

The tandoori chicken was perfectly grilled & the chicken was well cooked & tender & tasted very good too.The chicken bharta was also good. Coming to the biriyani,I was really pleased by the rich taste. Quality as well as quantity gets full marks. Am very happy that a good biriyani restaurant is located near my place.

When you don't feel like cooking for the evening or want your mom to rest for a day, hop in to Oye Balle Balle nd enjoy a sumptuous meal at a very fair price!
 When moving from FD park towards Karunamoyee, you can spot this place on your right! A huge lorry at the entrance, it's hard to miss!

About the food, well like any other city dhaba, they too make lipsmacking Chicken dishes and parhatha as well. I'm a rice person hence I went for Biriyani! It was good! Didn't expect such rich taste! 
 
The place wasn't much crowded so Service was smooth.. about the d√©cor, it has a wooden interior look with Funky cushions nd funny troll wall frames. My parents liked it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!

We used to go to the stereotyped restaurants for biriyani until my friend took me to this place and Mahsallah! I was mesmerized. We ordered Chicken Lehsooni Kebab, Fish Tikka , Mutton Biriyani, Tandoori Nun, Chicken Bharta, and ended with Firni.
I was astonished with food. The kebabs were juicy and lovely. Followed by the biriyani which was not oily and more importantly the chicken bharta had the dhaba feeling which was lovely. Finally we had firni which was also very tasty. 
Decor was very good. Gave a real dhaba feeling in Salt Lake. Staff behaviour was also nice. 
Pocket pinch: A bit higher range than usual.

Salt Lake is another area which is coming up strongly in the food scene of Kolkata, by adding a variety of themed restaurants to its collection at a fast pace.

Location and Parking-¬†
The restaurant is situated on the side of a service road in the vicinity of Karunamoyee crossing,just beside the Steak Factory restaurant and is quite easy to locate by Google Maps.Parking is free on the service road too.

Ambience-

The restaurant is innovatively decorated to give a vibe of a Dhaba and features lots of Indian Truck Art. In fact the facade is dominated by the front portion of a ‚ÄòPunjab Truck‚Äô. The interiors are vibrant with deep, rich hues everywhere, from the walls to the table-tops. They serve their food ‚Äòhighway-style‚Äô too, on stainless steel plates.¬†

Food:

We went there twice, both times on weekday dinner times and ordered the following-

Mutton Adrak-e-Punje- Was glad to find Mutton Kebabs in their menu. The mutton pieces were juicy and soft, with a hint of ginger.

Chicken Pahari Kebab- The succulent pieces of boneless chicken, with hints of mint and coriander,were done just right.

Mongolian Chicken- Boneless chicken chunks in a sweet and tangy semi-gravy, with bell peppers,onions,etc .We did an unlikely pairing by having it with rumali rotis.This was not on the regular menu though, but was a special for the day.

Mutton Rara Punjabi- Mutton chunks cooked in a spicy and thick gravy with keema and garnished with chopped coriander. Expectedly, it was quite heavy on the palate. We paired it with onion salad and plain tandoori rotis,which were soft with a little bit of crunch at the ‚Äòspotted‚Äô parts.

Kulfi and Firni- Dessert choice is limited here.We tried both on different days. Would have liked them better if the sweetness quotient was dialled down a notch or two.

Service: The staff are polite and prompt.

They are open till late night, so this place will be in my list for the days when the craving for some straightforward dhaba food strikes at some unwonted hour, like it did on one extremely windy and rainy Monday night.

The restaurant  creates a perfect pujabi wala feeling inside it.The kebabs tastes preety well.In the main course we ordered keema naan and chicken rara punjabi which tasted quite amazing.We also ordered mutton biriyani which seems  quite ok.Their service was pathetic.We went on  Sunday  and being a holiday knowing there will be lot of customers they complain that they  have insufficient stuffs.They served the food an hour later after you order.The most disappointing thing is that the staffs do not come to take the order you yourself have to call them.The rating was just given bcoz of their quality of food else it didn't deserve 2 also.

Oye is lik 10mins walking distance frm my house. 
So we visit thre quite often. 
Still remember the days when it just opened.... our eyes whre burning due to the exhaust gas frm Kitchen coming inside the restaurant. But now its all fine and we dine without crying :-P

Coming to Food we order. 
Chicken/Mutton Biriyani (Must Have). 
There are so many good places to have Biriyani in Kolkata frm Arsalan to Aminia etc etc... but i m a fan of oye's Biriyani.... just 1 word... WOW... its so good.. i cant express... u need to taste to believe it. 

Chicken Chap with Rumali Roti- our another all time fav at this restaurant. 
Try thre Garlic Naan or Kabuli Naan with chkn or mutton lababdar. 
Last but not the least Chkn Tandoori... its soft nd juicy frm inside and smokey frm outside... just what i want. 
Its not that expensive..... fr 2 persons the avg bill we hav is arnd 1k.Depends on whether u r ordering starter or not.
Hope you like the review,  its highly recommended fr trying out with frnds nd family.

Good place to visit( it's a 5 minute walk from my place) or order from if you are a late night person... Indian cuisine is the best here though not a lot of options to choose from...the ambience is also quite serene and cosy, much better than the clunky and cacophonic branch near city center. Perfect place for an unplanned last minute outing..

I guess it was a bad day for me. First of all the tandoori chicken had a very bad n rotten smell about it. When i complained it was changed immediately though. Then the replacement looked more like chicken fry than tandoori. Oil was everywhere. Next arrived the biriyani which was tasty. Chicken tikka masala was also good.
Service was good but not prompt.

I ordered a Chicken chilli garlic noodles which cost me ‚Çπ189/- including taxes and packaging charge. The noodles were worth every penny I spent. It was spicy, tasty and was in good quantity. Although, the appropriate time of delivering was 55 to 60 minutes but I got it after 1 hour and 30 minutes. So, my hunger was vanished by the time it was delivered.

I have only ordered online for delivery and never visited the restaurant. The food is quite flavoursome. The delivery is always early or on time and the food remains fresh and hot.
The only thing is that the main course subzis/ saag and daal solidifies or becomes hard due to the possible use of hydrogenated Fats like Vanaspati. I would recommend them to either use Pure Ghee or Refined Oil in such preparations and  it should be perfect and five star rating worthy.

Located in Sector 3, it is a beautifully Decorated, with great interiors. We had Lassi, Chicken Rara, and Garlic Naan, all of them were equally nice, though would prefer a boneless version of chicken next time. The service was great, but a bit unprofessional.

The restaurant is located near Karunamoyee. Just opposite of Central park in Salt Lake area. Went there with my girlfriend for lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated and filled with lots of 'Dhaba' vibes. We quickly settled down and ordered our food.

We Ordered : Tandoori Chicken, Mutton Rogan Josh and Keema Naan.

# Tandoori Chicken was perfectly grilled, soft and succulent pieces of chicken. Served with a delicious mint chutney.
# Mutton Rogan Josh had 3 pieces of mutton. It was the star of all the dishes. Tender pieces of mutton cooked in a rich and tasty gravy.
# Keema Naan was not that good as it lacked the stuffing of keema(minced meat) inside the naan.

Service was on the slower side and the staffs were needed to be more professional. Prices were also decent and they do charge all kinds of taxes. 
Overall a good place to visit with friends and family and do visit this place at night for their wonderful decorations........

One of the late night Dhaba in Salt Lake. Food is good, Ambience is average but the Staff needs to behave well as they took wrong order and didn't accept their mistake.

Located near karunamoyee. The interior is panjabi styled. Though very much clumsy. The staff was good, well mannered. We ordered chicken Pahari kabab, crispy chicken , mutton special biriyani, chicken special biriyani, Lassi, fresh lime soda and firni. Pahari kabab and crispy chicken was normal , quality of chicken was good but quantity was very less as compared to the price. Biriyani was good. Less spicy, well flavoured and good quantity. A special biriyani is enough for two person. Lassi was very bad. Not thick. Like a road stall. Price is very high. Firni was good but expensive. The overall experience was okay type.

Visited this "eye catchy" outlet few days back for Lunch.. I was highly impressed by the interance.. it looks good actually.. specially during night..
The place is good but a small one..
Interior is nice..
Tried both veg and non veg.. both were good..
Yellow daal was amazing..
Service is a bit on a slower side..
Quality of food can be much better.. but still a good place for lunch and dinner..

Do not try chinese - We went for a light dinner..we ordered chicken reshmi kebab, crispy babycorn as starter..babycorn was ok, but the kebab was not that much soft. In main course we ordered chilli garlic chowmin and veg Manchurian. Chowmin was ok..but the manchurian was damn bad. It had excess soya sauce which made it bitter, and the dish was overcooked as well. We told the same to the waiter and he replaced the dish, but still no difference. May be we should'nt have tried chinese in a dhaba, we could have tried some dhaba type khana. I am giving 2* only because of the starter.

Been here for a friend's treat. 

First of all the ambience of this place is really nice, they have tried to give it a punjabi touch with the big truck decor on gate and wall decors as well.

The food was really good, everything from starters, to main course, to delicious lassi and gulab jamun.

Thumbs up!

Oye Balle Balle Dhaba gave me and my partner the typical dhaba eating experience and it was fun.Located opposite to Central Park in Salt Lake city,this restaurant has some great dishes under it's belt.The staff was capable enough and the food was delicious.Chicken Pahari Kebab is a mouth watering starter and try out Chicken Tikka Masala.The classic dish will do justice to the money you will be investing.The decor is nice and so is the ambience.You can definitely give it a shot.

Well, some Punjabi daal makhani cravings ‚Äì and the OBBD ‚Äì to my rescue!

Had been planning to visit this place since long ‚Äì as it‚Äôs decor had captured my attention ‚Äì the Punjabi look and feel ‚Äì the truck d√©cor at the entrance ‚Äì had indeed aroused my tongue!

Finally, went for an office delivery from this place of the below items:-

(i)	Pudina paratha ‚Äì very presentable and tasty, also crispy!

(ii)	Tandoori roti ‚Äì fine, although it had become soggy (for which they cannot be blamed ‚Äì as this was a delivery, not a dine-in)

(iii)	Peas pulao ‚Äì Okayish ‚Äì nothing worth mentioning ‚Äì ghee seemed just too much into it!

(iv)	Corn palak ‚Äì pretty much a let-down ‚Äì for which I presume they ought not be blamed ‚Äì as good quality spinach is not available in summers ‚Äì this main course thus, seemed pretty candid.

(v)	Dal makhani ‚Äì The show-stopper ‚Äì the face saver ‚Äì the USP ‚Äì of this place ‚Äì indeed a plate of daal straight from the revered lands of Punjab ‚Äì God bless thy chef!

A decent mix of rajma as well as appropriate amount of butter ‚Äì as well as some sugar ‚Äì imparting it a low sweet taste ‚Äì just the perfect daal!

Delivery was pretty smooth and prices are high ‚Äì might consider a dine-in this time to relish the heavenly daal!

Cheers!

I went there with some of my friends after a brief photoshoot at salt lake. We were terribly tired in the scorching heat of summer. The ambience and hospitality were really appreciable as we reached there. We ordered chicken bharta and chicken malai kabab along with butter nun. Though the chicken items were good but nun was a big disappointment. You can check other items if you drop there at any miserable time.

I would like to describe a little incident as a review. A customer complained about a dead cockroach or an ant (not sure which one) inside his food. Things got agitated soon, the manager shouted back at the customer and soon other employees accompanied him. The man was disrespected and literally thrown out of the restaurant (no pushing or fighting though) , infront of his wife.

Surely never going back..

Ps.
Food was good. But such food is basically available all over kolkata now. Surely wont recommend anyone to visit with your family with such ill mannered managers around.:)

5 May, 2017: I saw rave reviews of this place and decided to order from here. It is a little confusing which one is which - "Balle Balle Dhaba" and "Oye Balle Balle Dhaba". We had ordered food before from the one right in front of City Center 1 before, but did not like it quite so much. I was surprised to see this is a different establishment. So, I ordered from here tonight. The food was good. Here are two photos. They look quite sumptuous. I will keep posting as I order more.

7 May, 2017: This time I ordered the Special Mutton Biryani and Mutton Do Pyaza. And, as usual, the pictures look fabulous. The food tastes okay.

8 May, 2017: I did not like the biryani yesterday. But when I tried homemade rotis with the Mutton Do Pyaza, they tasted quite nice. Wish they had better biryani.

Excellent ambience, a place where you can actually enjoy your food. However, there was lack of North Indian feels in the food. We ordered Fish Tikka in starters, which was the best starter item we had. The other item was Chicken Reshmi Kabab, which was hard. Reshmi kababs are meant to be soft. On complaining, we were told that it will be changed, it was, but it was still hard. 

Coming to the main course, quantity was low in comparison to the price, especially the Butter Chicken. Fish do Piaza was somewhat bland in taste. Again, Dal Makkhani was excellent, but its quantity was low. The amount of Garlic was less in Garlic Naan, and even the stuffing was less in Masala Kulcha. Overall, it was a good meal, but not worth of a second time visit.

This place is located near FE opposite to Central Park. We went there on a Saturday night around 12. Were quite hungry and quickly decided to order dal fry, mix veg, salad and kulchas. Food was served very quickly in 10 mins. Veg Jhal Frezi was very bland and dal seemed to have Become stale due to hot weather etc. Kulcha stuffing was not good either. We just gobbled our food quickly and moved out. Pocket friendly and good service. 1/5 for food quality and taste.

Chicken Tandoori Buttermasala goes great with Garlic Naan and hence this. Their tandoori buttermasala is just as you want, spicy- with the smoky tandoori flavour. It's rich gravy melts in your mouth. The chicken in soft and tender. Garlic naan is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, with rich flavour of garlic coming from the chopped burnt garlic. All in all the food is great.
Reshmi kebab at Oye Balle Balle Dhaba is one of its kind. Its fresh and tender. Chicken is soft, flavours explode when it goes into the mouth. Just a con, the pudina chutney isn't upto the mark. Else it's great.

What strikes you first is the decor. You are greeted by an authentic truck facade complete with windows , Wipers. Step inside and you see that the truck is actually their billing station. There was a tandoori aroma around when we entered and it smelt amazing.
The decor inside is also very well done. Wooden cartons hung upside down dot the ceiling . Walls are bare brick which make it look posh.
Go for the sofa seats as they have cushions.
Coming to the food, we ordered Pan Fried Chilli fish as starter , Lassi and Sweet Lime. It was excellent. For main course we had the Cheese Naan and Chicken Reshmi Masala . Cheese Naan was excellent and the chicken was the tenderest I have ever had . Put it simply it melted in my mouth. Just amazing !!!!!
Ended with Kulfi as dessert which was the best and creamiest I have ever had.

The staff were up on their toes and would change plates fill water and serve the following dish the moment you finished. 5 stars for the service.  

If you really want some authentic Punjabi food try it here. You.wont be disappointed.

It was our project lunch and all most all the restaurants near sector v had been explored by us on previous occassions. So, after getting a tip from one of our colleagues, we decided to come here. And I must say, we don't have any regrets about that.

In the entrance of the dhaba, a model of front view of a truck creates your mood. You know what to expect and what not to. Though the menu contains both mughlai and Chinese, we never indulged into the later one. The decoration of the restaurant was okay(the goodish okay) and it's specious.

Now the food:
Starter -

1. Adrak ke punje - mutton kebab, beautifully merinated and soft piece of mutton. Size was good. 2 pieces in one plate. This is the first time i ate a mutton kebab that actually has a big piece of mutton in it.
2. Chicken bhuna - this was not in the menu card, but the waiter suggested us. It was a bit spicy but delicious.

Main course -

1. Chicken and mutton biriyani - just mouth watering. I seriously recommend this biriyani to everyone‚Äã who loves kolkata biriyani. We had ordered special biriyani and one plate needed to be shared by 2 people. 2 special biriyani for three person will be more than sufficient.
2. Chicken reshmi kebab - just like any other good mughlai restaurant. 5 pieces in plate.
3. Mutton rogan josh - i personally hadn't tasted it, but the others who ordered this told us that it was good
4. Mutton rara - a bit more spicy. Not what i was expecting. Portion of chili was more. I'd not prefer it next day and i'd not recommend it. 3 pieces in a plate.

Now the price. It's a bit on the upper side but not much. We were 9 in a team and the bill was 6200/- including 20.5% tax. Tips was not required as service charge was included.

Over all, a refreshingly good restaurant for mughlai lovers. Go and try it out.

I don't why people have rated this restaurant so higher. Tried out their fish tikka, mutton rarah Punjabi and some other mutton dish. The fish served were not fresh and the all of the dishes were overpriced according to the quality of the food. Ambience is not that impressive as well.

Located near Central Park in Salt Lake this Dhaba has made a name for itself . Visited this place for lunch today . The front part is modelled like a truck which also act as their front desk . The interior is quite good with comfortable seating arrangement . One lantern in each table is provided to create the feel of a Dhaba . Staffs are well behaved & were always nearby to serve whenever needed . Coming to the food we ordered the following : 
Mutton adrak ke punje : The dish consists of two pieces of mutton , of considerable proportion , with associated salads . The mutton was nicely cooked & chewing the bones felt heavenly . The pudina chatney was outstanding & combined excellently with the dish .
Mutton Biryani : It comes with one piece of mutton & one piece of potato . The quantity is more than sufficient & the taste , smell was really good . 
Mutton Chap : We chose the with bone option as I am fond of chewing the bones of mutton . The gravy was perfectly cooked with required amount of oil & spices.
Butter Nun : Excellently cooked , soft & tasty it combined perfectly with Chap . 
Overall a nice & pleasant experience with desire to come back again .

eye catching exterior of a truck cabin.
lovely interior with hanging lights.
when we went today for lunch it was waiting of
more than 40 people but they arranged table for us in fifteen minutes, it was table for 20.
they told us they can accommodate 80 pax at a time.
they serve awsome punjabi food but the twist is being a dhaba they really serve mind blowing chinese.
I want to try some more dishes so I m going to visit again.

Located near central park, karunamoyee. Visited this place for dinner with family. Staffs were welcoming. Service was slow. No points for cleanliness. Lot of mosquitoes to disturb. Told various time to clean the table and it's below part, still the staff was waiting for whose order don't know, dissapointed. Ambience had the feeling of Punjabi dhaba. We had ordered crispy chilli baby corn and tandoori Aloo in starters, sweet corn in soup, methi Malai matar, Aloo do pyaza,  Malai kofta, Paneer Masala in vegetables, tandoori roti, lachha paratha, rumali in breads, fresh lime soda sweet in beverages and finally a masala papad. 
Food was delicious. Quality and quantity both was good.

Food was served cold and the taste was bland.The masala papad tasted okay, although there was a bit too much salad. Roomali roti was not soft. Perhaps a result of the Saturday night rush, but that only means that their kitchen staff is inadequate. Perhaps they should also reduce the menu a little.

It was love at first sight! The ambience was just awesome; the half truck billing box caught our attention, sparkling and glittering decoratives and wall hangings alongwith the posters gave it an ideal Punjabi touch. The food and delivery time was par excellence. We had half tandoori, butter naan, chicken bharta and sweet lime soda. All in all, a very satisfying affair, and we plan to visit again trying out the other Punjabi dishes on offer!!

Tussi Punjab se ho ji? 
Yes. That's what the name suggests us!!

When you see it from outside all you see is a truck, "punjab-Di-gaddi". Inside is the restaurant!! Located near karunamoyee, it won't be difficult for foodies to track. With a blend of punjabi decors and North Indian delicacies it brings out the essence of a true Punjab dhaba, only without the "chaukis".

The decoration was intuitive trying to bring up the Punjab culture while the menu was no different than any North Indian restaurant and was cheaper with chicken tikka butter masala to be the most delicious one of what I tried. You can opt for it. 

The management was prompt and welcoming. We haven't had any issues with that.

Overall the experience has been nice and I'm looking forward for another visit.

Wow! Im in love with this place.
Its quite a fairly sized restaurant. Well lit n comfortable seats.
We had ordered kadhai paneer, dal makhani, naan, kulcha. Everything was spicy n perfectly cooked.

If Im visiting a dhaba, i want my daal n paneer to be masaledaar. No doubt that the daal served here is one of the best I've tasted so far.
Im deducting 0.5 for few options in starters.
Please please increase the number of options in starters.
Have always ordered only main course over here as we don't wana fill our tummy with the starters! The quantity given is sufficient for 3 people.
Have visited this place quite a few times already n i know I'll be visiting it often in the future too!!

A place with very good interiors. Ambiance is also good. We ordered paneer tikka and crispy chilli potato in starter. Tikka wqs not up to mark n the portion was very less having 4 pcs. Crispy chilli potato was good. Then we ordered garlic naan butter naan makai roti rumali roti sarso saag aalu do piaza. All was delicious except makai ki roti since it was thin like tandoori. Then we ordered papad and sweet lime soda. Prices are on lower side. It cost us 1200 including tax. A must visit.

To be honest, the truck caught our attention. The most quirky entrance I ever saw. Yes! They do have a truck, in their entrance. And once you enter, it gives you a feeling of dhaba, but modernised. The decor is quirky and interesting. VERY. The car number plates, to walk graffiti, will surely make you feel amazed.
Coming to food,
We had ordered lime soda, butter tandoori roti, shahi paneer, and firni. The paneer delicacy is absolutely perfect. Not the too sweet gravy, but well balanced rich gravy with soft paneer cubes which simply metled in mouth. Firni, on the other hand was so great, that we ended up ordering 4 for the 2 of us. Its the best firni, i had so far.
Service, is brilliant, so is the price being quite reasonable.
I highly recommend this place

Visited Oye Balle Balle Dhaba located in FE Block, Salt Lake on 22nd January 2017 late night (No! It is different from the Balle Balle Dhaba, beside City Centre ‚Äì Salt Lake). It has been designed very well and gives a feel of a Dhaba on highways. Being a Vegetarian, we ordered for Aloo Dopyaja, Masala Kulcha, Roomali Roti, Fresh Lime Soda and an aerated drink. A forced inclusion was Onion Salad as they denied to serve complimentary Onions & Lemons. The food tasted nice but the drinks were not cold and almost served at room temperature, despite 2 shoutouts but it didn‚Äôt work out.

To begin with the ambience and the hospitality ..both are great..The interior and spacious sitting arrangements are impressive.
Coming to food I ordered both indian and chinese.The quality of food is great and upto the mark but i will advice to go for indian because the hunan chicken i tried was not upto the mark whereas the indian dishes impressed the taste buds.The quantity is quite less and hence not a full 5 rating.

After a matinee movie @RDB , me along with my friend planned for a lunch outside. As he was more inclined to DHABA type food so we came across this few others. The other options we had already opted and not in a mood for repeating. So we have decided to go for this and once we reach at this place we were excited by looking the truck outside.whem we step inside it seems the siting premise is bit congested. "DHABA PE free hoke pet bharke khaanna chahiye" ...This is what my friend's reaction to the siting arrangements. This place s also serving Chinese foods along with Indian, we planned to stick with Indian only. We ordered Tangri kebab in starter. The main course comprise of chicken tikka masala, mutton botoli masala,one plain rice and 3garlic naans. Wait there is a serious mistake. While receiving the order the waiter left in between. And came once we called him after a while.I asked one fresh lime soda and that's all for that day. Coming to the quality the kebab was just OK. The taste spoiled with heavy masala in mutton as well as chicken. Looking to the price it is bi pricy for food what they serve. Hate their hospitality. I will not repeat this place in future and that's for sure.

Does not live up to the standards it claims to have. I wasrather excited to try the punjabi fare.. however the sarson saag and makki rotis were far from the delicacy i had tasted at the roadside dhabas on my way to chandigarh... Not even close to the ones found in other establishments even in kolkata. The biryani was oily but palatable. The 3 rating is purely on the decor and ambience.. the food .. not so much

So, I accidentally ordered food from here today thinking that it was Balle Balle dhaba ( near CC 1 ) . However, the mutton biryani was a little disappointing. I was expecting it to be the same as that of Balle Balle dhaba but it was not that good which is surprising because both of them are kind of the same.

I was busy like hell and was working pathetically that day (around a month back) at the office and almost forgot to grab the sandwich that my house help has packed for the lunch. I had done with the 6th serving of the black coffee but somehow was not able to finish an analysis that was supposed to submit. It was about half-past one in the afternoon and I suddenly realized that the mobile phone was ringing and it was Poorna on the opposite side! ‚ÄúErrrrrrrr‚Äù this was my reaction as I didn‚Äôt have time to pick the call even. However, who can ignore Panuswari for that matter and I ended on talking to her and found she was nearby my office at Oye Balle Balle Dhaba and was having her lunch, in fact, it was an informal blogger‚Äôs table and she was adamant having me over there! After 5 minutes of loose talk I ended on asking ‚Äúwhy should I go and where is my formal invitation?‚Äù and what I got ‚Äúcome na‚Äù and who am I to ignore her lovely nagging by the way and I ended on driving there at Oye Balle Balle Dhaba. The place is located in Sector 3, Salt Lake and hardly 10 minutes‚Äô drive from my office.

Opted for home delivery last night. Was pleased with the person taking the delivery. Polite and knowledgeable about the food. He suggested chicken lasuni kebab for starter. It was excellent. The only problem being that I thought the portion was very less for the charge. They only served 2 pieces. 
Rest of the food was good. Had egg tarka, butter chicken, Chana and rumali roti. Only reason for not Gettin 5 on 5 is that the egg tarka n Chana was way too spicy. Only if they could reduce the chillies!

On entry to the restaurant we were greeted by Manager who was extremely polite. We requested him to suggest us some dishes as we were new to this place and didnt know about their style of prepration. We dislike spicy food so he recommended some white gravy based #punjabi dishes. We had a amazing non-vegetarian meal and it was excellent in all aspects. You could literally taste each ingredient in the dishes. Excellent service and hospitality too. Highly recommended. #BestDhaba

We visited this joint a few days ago for lunch. Comfy and spacious sitting arrangements¬† with less clutter. Waiters¬† were well mannered and responded every query about the food.
Coming to the food we ordered chicken tandoori,plain basmati rice and mutton¬† rogan josh with¬† salad.Mutton rogan josh was on the sweeter side although we wanted little spiced up.Overall food was good.
Would like to visit again.

After craving some great Punjabi food in Kolkata, we came here with a group of 8 and were quickly seated before the dinner rush. We started with #ChickenTangri and #TandooriPaneer, and for our meal ordered the #Murg Malai and #PaneerTikka butter masala has specially requested it to keep it spicy and it was all so Amazing. The fish do pyaz wasnt as good as others but i cant expect to get an excellent fish dish at a #Punjabi Dhaba as well. Don't miss this #Dhaba, and plan to come at an off time, because the other 4 in our group came in the late evening to meet a couple and had to wait 20 minutes.

‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†I'm staying with my cousin in #Saltlake and needed some Lunch. I just wanted something quick, inexpensive, nutritious. Walked to Sector 3, noticed this small place, saw the "Colourful Truck" outside the restaurant which caught my attention, thought how bad could it be, right?

#Delicious. Quick, #inexpensive, nutritious. Extensive menu, all cooked to order in the tiny kitchen area. I had the #Chicken butter masala, really good, possibly the best I've had. Hit the spot. Whole lunch costed me around Rs500.

The wooden chairs, window all rock back and multi-colour table cloth was giving it the feel of an actual dhaba. Reminds me of college days. I shall return.

While passing by the Sector 3, I was enchanted by the quirky truck at Oye Balle Balle #Dhaba. Though we were surprised by the Truck but it was the interiors which fascinated more. It was a mixed feeling of awesomeness and incredibility in the air with what they had done with the place. We ordered #Tandoori #Chicken and we were simply blown away by its tantalising taste. Service was excellent as the attendants were quite courteous and understanding. It was the #bestdhaba experience for me.

Get foodaholic here with amazing varieties of punjabi dhaba style food and proper dhaba ambience which very few restaurants provide!! The truck in the font door says it all and is very distinctive to spot while you pass by. Amazingly to my surprise they also have a chinese menu!!! The Chinese food here will give many Chinese restaurants a run for their money!! I wish my very best to the guys at Oye Balle Balle Dhaba for providing such amazing food which no one else in today's market provide!!!

Being a regular at Balle Balle Dhaba, we decided to pay a visit to this fresh new outlet. Well, to sum up my experience would be an understatement as I have always loved the food at Balle Balle Dhaba. This time Oye Balle Balle Dhaba lived up to its expectations and how!
For the two of us, we ordered fresh lime soda, chicken bharta, tandoori roti (butter) and mutton biriyani. As always, the dishes were delicious and well prepared. The tandoori roti was oozing with butter, the bharta was creamy and lipsmacking with shredded chicken pieces and a big thumbs up to the biriyani!! A delectable biriyani with such a succulent and juicy piece of mutton is a hard find, for sure!!
Coming to the decor, it was beautiful, with lights all around giving us the 'dhaba wala' feel. The chairs were really cosy and the best part was that it was really spacious!!
A big lorry at the entrance was the cynosure of all eyes and it did stand apart!! :D

To sum it up, my experience has always been fantastic at Balle Balle, but I guess Oye Balle Balle will take away all the brownie points this time!! :)

Going to visit this place again for their Chinese now!! :)

My never ending love for Indian food brings me here again and again. I am simply in love with this place. The very truck thingi outside tells you its a "Dhaba" and you gonna have fun. Ambience is so colourful and lively with few funny memes and handcrafted decor. Above everything Food is just Wow! This dhaba perfectly defines Indian food. (All types of Roti, naan, rice, Alloo da pyaza, dal makhni, egg curry etc etc etc) And I seriously felt like doing "balle balle" when I saw the bill because it was just perfect and in budget. In hindi- thore paise mei bhar peth khake jao. üôàüòú

A good place with a decent ambience...waiters r courteous ...
Went with one of my friend and ordered reshmi kebab which was up to the mark and just perfect.The boneless chicken bharta and biriyani will also satisfy your taste buds.
It was a pleasant experience overall.

For starters I had ordered crispy chilli baby corn but it wasn't that crispy. The main course was fine. We had dal tadka and kadai paneer and both of them was nice

Wallet mera bhara tha, note uss mey changa tha, modi ki andolan mein bas 500 ka panga tha. Had been to many places but all refused. I was all depressed and hungry.

To read a review and visit this dhaba in accordance to that perspective is the dumbest thing you can do. 
With eyes closed, one can always count on this dhaba. Food, service and ambience-you name it and you will get it. Period. Being a foodie, I never compromise on the quality and this dhaba never fails to amaze me. The staff force works round the clock and the desperation to keep the customers tagged in for life is just utter bliss. After a formula one pit stop, their delivery timings comes into competitionüòÅüòÅ.Never did I ever get a depressive response no matter how congested it becomes. Even at odd hours, late into the night, I always find a kitchen where everyone knows how I want my spices mixed. The owner/manager always finds a place amongst the customers to socialise and personally feel out for them. That's rare. And this combo is what gets you high and makes you come back for more. To sum it up, this venue is a poison if you want to die with a happy tummy and a sorted mind!!!!! Drift onto this dhaba if you are ever around cause this review will not summarise the "feel good factor"'!!!!!

Visited for lunch on 27Nov16. NOT an extension of the Balle Balle outlet at CC1, here are the pros and cons of this outlet opposite Salt Lake Central Park:
Pros
Nicely well lit vibrant ambience
Ample parking
@Service good but there is scope of improvement
Tasty food. Had chicken tandoori butter masala, Amritsar Daal tadka, roti, naan, firni, fresh lime soda
Pocket friendly-Tab for the above @870 post tax

Cons
Could be cleaner. Tables, glasses, toilets....just there could be better!

Location : Opposite to Central Park , Salt lake. Just beside Koshe Kosha ¬†on the main road to Karunamoyee itself.

Ambiance : They leave no stone unturned to remind you that it really is a roadside dhaba ! Part of the front facade has been converted to a truck ! ¬†A very moroccan vibe can be felt throughout . Service ¬†was nice , nothing extraordinary but the waiting time was disappointing ! Felt like forever that too when the place was deserted at 5 in the evening !¬†

Food : Although a dhaba screams out mughlai food but we decided to go for chinese ¬†which was there on the menu . Frankly we were just testing whether a chinese platter at a dhaba would be any good ! So we ordered the Mixed Fried Rice along with the roasted Lamb . Amount wise it was just about " OK ¬†" . ¬†If you're really looking for "amount" you should try NARGIS just 2 houses down the road .

Anyway by the time the food came , the Fried rice was very dry . Sure all the stuff was there , they didn't cheap out , but the taste was somewhat lacking . But the Roasted Lamb was very well made . It was juicy and did melt in my mouth . Overall it made the rice easier to swallow .¬†

Cost for 2 : ¬†700/- plus

Final conclusion : I will be visiting them for the actual Dhaba food but it just wasn't wise for them to put Chinese on the menu and not have the ability to recreate a simple dish like the Mixed fried rice ! We get it everyone likes chinese so you'll probably get those customers but the preparation wasn't upto the mark !! ¬†The entire experience was a mixed bag ..

Of all the dishes we ordered, the Dal Makhani was absolutely bang on. Wonderfully flavorsome and cooked to perfection! A must try for people looking to indulge in some wholesome food without the worry of adding on a few calories :-D. Will certainly order again!

Indulged in a lovely lunch at this kitschily decked beautiful dhaba-style eatery. Ambiance is very soothing and comfy, and the quirky bus front edifice is pretty innovative.
Ordered for tandoori roti, dal tadka, chicken biryani and chicken bharta which were mindblowing and delicious, followed by firni which was not so good but pretty decent.
For a hearty meal I strongly recommend this place for just anybody (and not only hungry foodies) willing to whet their appetite!

Urban dhaba with a quirky decor - pretty good food and outstanding service.
Here are my thoughts:

Pros:
1) Good Kebabs (try their bharwan aloo, it's innovative)
2) Outstanding breads - all of them (kabuli naan and pudina paratha esp.)
3) Good locality - ample parking space
4) Cordial Service, very!

Cons:
1) Pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side 
2) Non-veg main course menu is pretty succinct (I felt I needed more choices)

Worth a try if you are a dhaba food freak.

How would you resist a greasy chunk of assorted mutton tempting you to the core ? Can you skip the call of a lasoni nun to be dunked in the scrummy Chicken Bharta. If your mouth started watering, redeem the taste buds by dropping in here. Quaint setting, soft lights, live kitchen and an artificial chulha that you can see from outside would give you the proper feel of Dhaba, among the hearts of the city of Joy. Come and devour pure punjabi khana with the maska of indulgence.

Well, first of all I went there because it is located at a walking distance from Carnival cinemas where i went to catch a movie with my buddies. Generally I get very conscious and judgemental of any new restaurant... it's like out of my comfort zone. So when we got there at first I just wanted to taste tried out dishes. My buddies, being more adventurous, ordered dishes that I personally would never try. The ambience of the place was good and the decor was maintained to the theme of the restaurant. The food there was awesome, starting from the mutton biriyani to chicken hariyali kebab.. Thumbs up to this new reataurant around the corner.

It was almost midnight and we were looking out for some north Indian food on salt lake area. That's when we got reminded of OBBD and no sooner we were there ordering our favourite food. The ambiance is excellent with a huge seating area. Coming to the interior and decor... well this is one of the best interiors I have seen in √† long time. Loved the way the quirky colour combination enhanced the look of the restaurant. The vibrancy of the decor would lighten your mood and you would want to sit on those couches for long. The waiters are very courteous and prompt in taking orders and serving the food. We ordered a mutton rara Punjabi, yellow dal and garlic naan. Each and every item is worth mentioning. The authenticity of the taste of the dhaba food is commendable. The paan and cigarette booth outside adds to it. The truck body placed at the entrance makes you feel as if you are i√± Punjab Pind. The pinch is pocket is like any other dhaba. Overall a lovely place to sit and eat good food with family and friends

This is a lovely joint to have some lip smacking Punjabi khaana. The food and the service both are pretty good. This is must go joint in salt lake sector 3 whenever you drop by.

The decors, the ambience, and the food speak of punjab in volumes.
Chicken tandoori is a common dish, and can be judged pretty easily, and there's are not that good.
But the kebabs, uff amazing.
And to tip it off, the firni. 

The truck console and the decors will sink in, if only they lighted the candles and incandescents.

Nevertheless, good one.

I and my frnd turned up at this restaurant amidst the surga puja festival here ... The dhaba looked nice and decent from outside .... The decoration inside is also decent.... But.... The table attendants were really measurable .... But one of our orders was altered despite noting the order down twice!! Last of all the bill they brought to us ironically had an altered rate of an item too.. Moreover the table attendant did not sound to be aware of the rates even didn't seem bothered much...rather he offered for adjusting the excess amount next time.. Wonderful .isn't it... Anyway ... The food here seemed near about okay .. I would rate 3.1 for the food and minus 0.6 for the management..

It was dashami lunch with family....we choose this restaurant as it's new and near to our house.  Choosing it was worth. The interior is colourful n based on authentic dhaba environment. It is situated at salt lake, FE block opposite to netaji statue..
Food quality is good,service is fast. A good place to visit for friends and family get together.
We ordered for 
*Peas Pulao- the Pulao was average in taste.
*Fish Tikka Masala - it was really tasty n yummy.
* Chicken Lababdar- a preparation of Reshmi Kebab in white gravy. 
*Tandoori chicken
*Mutton Curry- it was light and the flavour  home made mutton was felt.
Over in all had a good experience, would like to visit again.

So I ended up here on Ashtami with my family with no previous knowledge of the place and let's just say I plan to visit it again. The d√©cor is really cosy and pretty and the food is brilliant. North Indian is much better than their Chinese dishes. I suggest that everyone should have Chicken bharta and Saag mutton.  Daal Tadka was also great! I am very satisfied.

Newly opened restaurant, lovely interiors and ambience. This restaurant has a typical Punjabi "showoff" attitude which is really attractive !! üòú
We had ordered a portion each of Murgh malai kebab, mutton achari punje kebab, butter naans and mutton rogan gosht.
The kebabs had 6 pieces in each portion, the naans (Indian flat bread made of refined flour) were fluffy and soft. Food was good both in terms of quality and quantity. The only thing I was put off was with the pricing, it was on the higher side. The same quality of food is served at many other restaurants in salt lake at a comparatively lower price. Anyway, the restaurant is popular as it seems thanks to the timing of its opening(coincided with Durga Puja of 2016).... but i am sure to make it popular even during off seasons.. they can lower the prices of the food by a few notches. Those 2 dishes of kababs will alone cost around Rs. 800 including tax. Going by the standards of the restaurant and people visiting it, people may not think of visiting it twice if they find same food at a lesser price few blocks down the lane.
Hotel staffs were very well mannered. Ambieance was good, interior deco was fantastic, food was good.  May visit it again!!! :-)

Took parcel yesterday from this place with 1 plate of mutton rogan josh, mutton kasha, paneer kulcha and fried rice. Mutton dishes were so so in taste with mostly bones (very less flesh may be because we took parcel so that we can't complain then and there). Kulcha was not at all up to the mark. Kashmiri Pulao was rich in fruits but also very oily. Would not recommend and don't want to go again. But yes the customer service was good and off course the decoration.

Had hit this place during Durga Puja time with my gang of 9 hungry humans. The waiting time was 30mins but we adjusted since Kolkata during Puja defies all sane rules. We took butter naan, plain naan, butter chicken and chicken reshmi butter masala from Indian cuisine and crispy baby corn, chicken noodles, chicken fried rice and chilly chicken from Chinese cuisine. Food was good - chicken was a little chewy, apart from that no other complaints.

Ambience is good 
Food is pathetic
We ordered paneer tikka and nilgiri kebab
Paneer Tikka was just different 
You won't believe we were served cold paneer 
It was room temperature
And height of misbehaviour, when asked to replace 
The server gave us paneer tikka which was again reheated in microwave 
The server confirmed reheating

Nilgiri kebab was also bad 
It was cold and some oil was applied on kebab
Kebab was crumbling and not even in the condition to be considered a kebab

Ruined the name of balle balle group

Rare are those days where good food comes in prices that are economical. Such is this place called Oye Balle Balle Dhaba. Having a bus as a display for camera obsessed teenagers, this place has become a hit among them and as a matter of fact, among adults.

If I have to speak about food, how may I say this- they tick off everything from your criteria list. Food quality, check. Quantity, double check. Flavour, there. Everything was perfect when it came to Oye Balle Balle Dhaba and its food.

We tried their Chicken Bharta. A plate of boneless chicken with generous amount of gravy. Thick and tasty and completed with a swirl of curd on top.

Next we tried their Chicken Tikka Masala. A reddish thick curry served with delicious pieces of chicken. Tender meat with spicy flavour. An absolute killer combination.

Their Chicken Biriyani was very good too. It was more than sufficient for two people and had legs pieces too.

The service of the place is fast. Hygienic, clean and nicely decorated. Oye Balle Balle Dhaba definitely knows how to run its restaurant.

Oye balle balle dhaba is a newly opened outlet of the balle balle dhaba situated adjacent to city centre. This newly opened outlet has an additional chinese menu. The interiors of this restaurant have been made with inexpensive materials used cleverly to give  a rusty yet aesthetically superior finish. We had pan fried chilli fish. The quality of the fish was very good.  We had pahari kebab, which had the right amount of everything in it. It was cooked to perfection with the herbs blending in seamlessly with the meat. The waiters were well behaved and very keen for gathering improvement points from the user.
