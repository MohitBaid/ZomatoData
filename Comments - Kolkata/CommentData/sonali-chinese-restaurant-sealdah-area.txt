Located very near to my place,I have visited this place twice or thrice i guess.. And i am absolutely surprised to find this place on zomato.. Now coming to the place it is a small eatery located near Surendranath College where you get good quantity of average food at a reasonable price with limited seating arrangements which is almost more than enough if you're running out of money and dying of hunger

The food here is really good however it is not appropriate for sit and dine. It's really small restaurant and it serves really good food at a very reasonable price.

It is pretty cool restaurant actually, with few unique foods.
In proper Sealdah area, it's hard to find quality Chinese restaurants, what they give, is usually quantity. Sonali is not quite bad restaurant...Compared to most of the nearby ones.
Food quality is average,, soups are quite good, chowmein , fried rice, chicken etc are average. I don't like the prawn preparations here usually. The quantity is humongous...half plate rice is more than sufficient for one person.
Only interesting thing is...Some food items, like *Sesame chicken (picture given), Jack fried Chicken, Sliced chicken with baby corn & mushroom, ...These items are unique and pretty good to eat. They are rarely found in any other restaurants.
Very inexpensive. There's no point of ambience here. Fast supply of food. Hygiene might be questionable.
You can visit here,, if you are going to eat Chinese in Sealdah-M.G. road area, then it's a good choice. Specially better than other nearby options .

Should say if you are in Sealdah nd need an immediate place to hop in for food....this shud be your choice.... bt if you are choosy abt da decor den dat vl dissapoint you absolutly...nothing can be more pocket-friendly than this...so one can have a decent  food at a very low cost which will fully satisfy your hunger..

The ratings of 2.9 on Zomato for this particular eatery might incite varied thoughts in the minds of Zomato users but the perspective should be very clear on what points a user rates.

Surely, this is not a premium range Chinese eatery and it is absolutely baseless to expect such taste or hospitality out here. However, one should keep in mind that, it is obviously better than the roadside vendor serving you his own recipe in the name of Chinese. Furthermore, you get to eat your food being seated which should be considered too.

The taste of the Chinese provided here is not a great one nor can it be termed tasteless. The behaviour of the staffs are okayish and it is a place for people expecting to have food to fill their stomach not their essence. It is generally filled with people of teenage to adult age group. The price they charge for the food they provide should be termed "moderate"; but, it is actually an eatery for cheap food.

A visit only if you are too experimental!

Sonali Chinese restaurant is located at Sealdah beside Surendranath Law College which mainly serves Chinese quick bites though not authentic one.

Shabby ambience with limited sitting arrangements.

Slow service and 

Tried Fried rice & Chilli Chicken. Fried rice was average, oily but quantity was sufficient. Chilli Chicken was spicy and was mediocre but again quantity was ample.

Pocket pinch is economical.

Conclusion - An average place for  average food at a cheap price.

Surprised to see this outlet on Zomato, I have visited here long back for a plate of Chowmine. Tried their Chicken Chowmine I remember it was almost Rs.50 a plate. Taste was average as it is supposed to be for Rs.50. The place is very small, and close to Sealdha Flyover from MG Road.

It's  a very good restaurants in the locality and the quality of food is also pretty good but one problem u have to face is the lack of service.... U have to sit for at least half an hour before ur order arrives no matter u order soup or chowmin.... The service needs to be improved... Irrespective of that the place is one of the best choice.

Situated at a very busy place in Sealdah this is one of the eateries which holds memories. From evening dates to sunday food cravings. Sonali has always stayed by my side. I know that this is by no means a proper chinese outlet and the food is not authentic chinese and more like a fused bengali chinese but the bang for buck and the good taste is what that brings me here. The ambience is nice but recently the service has gone bad due to the irritating person who sits near the entrance and takes orders. The food quality is moderate and my favourite would be the mixed hakka chowmien.

Well It's near surendranath college sealdah. I love this place because of the rate and the taste but recently the service became very bad. Last time I went there with my friend and ordered a plate of mixed fried rice and asked them to divide the it into two plate they just have my order and e empty plates and walked away. It's rude and they need to work on that. Thus, in short good food but service sucks which is a major turn off..... >.<

A small chinese restaurant in busy sealdah area. Sitting arrangement is very bad. I ordered fried rice and chilli chicken. I had to wait for a long time as the service is very slow. Rice was average. Chicken pieces seemed large in size but to my utter disappointment those contained very less amount of chicken and the size was increased by the coating resulting in a bland taste.
Caution: The behaviour of the manager/owner is very unpleasant.

No doubt about the fact that this restaurant serves the best Chinese in that area... I have visited this place since I was 9yrs old. And trust me Gravy Noodles are heavenly here. Before you go for sum thing else try this! They make it The Best. Price was very cheap earlier but now its been increasing gradually but its really pocket friendly. For all college goers I suggest this place offer u quality food in very little time.

Well this was a saviour for me whenever I am around sealdah area or near my college area as this place surprisingly serves some awesome Chinese food at some very cheap rates compared to the quantity they give , well now as far as I remember i have eaten here probably 40 to 50 times from the very beginning of my college life and till date they maintain the quantity of food and the atmosphere is same , its like an hidden gem in Kolkata to get s taste of good lip smacking chinese food , and let me add on that there is option for half plate of food if u can't go through a whole meal which is an advantage for a customer before ordering but lastly the only problem with this place is that it ain't some proper restaurant or a eatery for family as its just as a fast food joint or you may call it a quick bite place so the ambiance isn't much appealing yet a good place for pocket friendly and delicious food .

A very small Chinese restaurant with a very limited no of siting available, Sonali Chinese is just located nearby to one of the most crowded place in Kolkata that is Sealdah Railway Station. As per the name it offers a large variety of Chinese dieses but offers none of the Chinese decorations inside. The restaurant is based on a old building therefore the place doesn't look so good. The behavior of the owner of this place is not so great to the customers but who want to gossip with him, we are here for foods right?
So coming to the foods : This is needed to mentioned that this restaurant offers a very large number of dishes on their menu card that is hard to find on other restaurants nearby. When you will order something over there beware that you have enough time on your hand, because they take a long time to serve you. In mains Schezwan, Manchurian & Normal Noodles over here is tasted below average. On the other hand Fried Rice Dishes are tasteless. On side dishes Chilli Chicken & other dishes are over spicy & somehow not that great to mouth. But it is well to mention that for full plate dishes they offer very good quantity that is sufficient to fill a huge stomach. Although the prices is on the little higher side comparing it to nearby once.
Conclusion : If you are totally exhausted over in the crowd of Sealdah & hungry, and if you don't care about interiors of the restaurant and also doesn't care about the quality of the food and you just needed to fill your empty stomach then only visit this place. Otherwise there are a ton of options open nearby.
