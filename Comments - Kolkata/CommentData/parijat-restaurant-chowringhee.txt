This place boasts of one of the best locations in the city , near the Shakespeare Sarani & AJC Bose Road crossing & beside the AC Market , but the same can not said about it's ambience & maintainance .The place is in a dilapidated condition & no visible effort can be seen to improve the situation . Despite the drawback visit this place to have their rolls , be it egg chicken or their combination , which is quite good . The rolls are crisp & contain generous amount of stuffing. The prices are quite cheap considering their location. Earnestly request the management to look after this place with much more care .

Location is fantastic but like most Bengali businesses, lacked vision and drive. Has quite a limited menu and the furniture and ambiance is dilapidated and downright shoddy.

But, they make one of the best rolls in town. The paratha is crisp and light and the kebab is soft and yellowish. The sauce is minimal and the onions can be fried on request. They make a mean tikiya too and a fried rice which is more like a pulao. And that's not all.... They still serve tea in a pot complete with a strainer and separate milk and sugar..... So nostalgic. Makes for a good place to have a quick bite and pocket friendly too.

Tucked between two buildings at Theatre Road/Shakespeare Sarani and very close to Birla Planetarium, this is one relic of the bygone era. Shabby and unclean atmosphere and a very dingy ambiance, come here if you want decent food at cheap rates. The cooking here is standard and rarely drops to the below-par level, A perfect place for dating couples, hop in here if you want to enjoy simplicity.

Simple looking bengoli restaurant which serves Chinese and north indian cuisine too.
Place was average looking and also not so clean too. Hospitality was average. Service was good and also staff was friendly. Come to food they're very good in their bengoli snacks. Chinese and north indian cuisine was average. Only their veg and paneer rools was above average.

This is a small restaurant near the Birla Planetarium. Now I'm gonna deviate from my usual writing style, because this one was just full of surprises and they came serially in order. To start off with, it looked like such a shabby and small, unclean place that I had second thoughts about going in. That was till I noticed the staircase, and realised the actual restaurant is situated in the 1st floor. So with renewed hopes I ascended the stairs which led me into a small but clean cabin with decent seating arrangement. Now these are the two negatives about this place: 1) it's small, totally lacking resources to handle bigger crowds, and 2) the ambience. The rest of the story, however, is all a tell-tale of positives for this place. The service was rather nice- the waiters were very polite and helping, the service was pretty quick. The food was...unexpectedly delicious! Like they still serve such nice food in such cheap prices? In Kolkata? I mean this just makes these guys awesome! The food was excellently cooked, and the flavours were in all the right places by my scales. I'd definitely recommended this restaurant if you are out for a quiet lunch in that area on a working day (cause I really don't know about the holidays as the place, again, is pretty small).

Parijat restaurant is a very small eatery located on the busy Theatre Road crossing.It serves delicious rolls and after having rolls from here I have become very particular in my taste for rolls.These scrumptious rolls are heavenly and filling.They have generous amounts of kebabs in the rolls unlike many other places.The double chicken double egg roll is a must try.
The exterior is quite misleading and I would say Â its easy to overlook this place but I would suggest that the place be given a try as its value for money.

Try the rolls from this place. They are without any sauce but are amazing. The best part of this small joint is they cook in good oil and hence you will never fall ill. Parijat is a very small joint where you can order rice, dal, fish, chicken and mutton curry. You may also order for Chinese and North Indian dishes or a plate of sandwich or fish fry and finger chips. But whatever you order do try the Keema Matar from this place, it is simply yum!
However, the toughest task would be to locate this restaurant. It right at Theater road crossing. Chances are you may have crossed it several times but may have never seen it!

This place is like a small secret tucked away in between the folds of the city. A place thats so shabby and ordinary that under normal circumstances, it wouldn't even attract your attention. Standing near the Birla Planetarium end of the Shakespeare Sarani, this small funny looking place is sqeezed dwarfishly between two large buildings. The restaurant located on the first floor looking out over a busy thorougfare just makes it all worthwhile. Ambience is nil and cleanliness obviously isn't considered a virtue here. The 4 tables and 1 toothless server are all relics of a bygone age. The food however, is tasty and well cooked. The fare is mostly popular dishes you'd find at any small eatery in town I suggest you take the egg devil and rotis along with any of the fried snacks if they are available. None of the items on the menu commands an individual review. Food is overall good. Prices are likewise low. In fact, I challenge that its the lowest price in the radius of a mile. 

Chakraborty Tip : A quirky enough place to take your special someone. Give romantic restaurants a miss this once in favour of this place.  :)
