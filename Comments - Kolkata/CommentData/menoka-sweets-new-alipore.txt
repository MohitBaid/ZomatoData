Located in Chetla, this sweet shop is pretty small both in quality and quantity of area it acquires!!!
     
Food quality a bit above average, all over ,service pretty fast, no crowdy situations as such, hygiene and cleanliness (can't expect much out of such a small outlet) ; 

Their snacks, singaras,etc. along with the sweet tooth delicacies like kalakand, sandesh, rosogolla are pretty basic; their tok doi is somewhat better than the rest of the items!!!

Anyways ,  improvement required !!!

Menoka sweets is a small sweet shop located at Chetla.

Ambience is ok with quick service.

Tried their Chamcham, kalakand & singaara. Sweets were decent and singaara was ok, but nothing to rave about.

Overall an above average experience.

A decent sweet shop in and around Chetla, this is a quick option to try some snacks and/or sweets. Tried the Roshogolla and Samosas from this place, which tasted pretty decent.

Situated opposite Ahindra mancha (Chetla) , this is a small shop for sweets and snacks. Been a weekend customer here for last 3-4 months because of classes nearby. Their collection of sweets is pretty vast... Rosogolla, pantua, sorbhaja, chhanabhaja, khirkadam, rasamalai are pretty good... So is their malpoya and amritti. They sell fresh misti doi too. Furthermore their samosas (prepared in the morning and evening) and khasta kachuris (served in the noon and afternoon) are worth munching on. They dont have seating arrangements owing to lack of space. Still this probably is the best outlet of its kind in that locality...

Another relatively new sweet shop in Chetla at CIT Market. The taste & quality of sweets here is better than that in Desher Khabar. The shop is not so big & decorative like Desher Khabar but one will love the sweets here.

The classes of a course that I have joined recently are being held quite often at Chetla Ahindra mancha.This sweet shop is located bang opposite to Ahindra mancha and hence it has been my saviour during my sudden hunger pains.The quality of the sweets is average though.The samosas are inconsistent.They are sometimes tasty and sometimes totally bland and under fried.The sandeshes are average.The mishti doi is pretty decent though and is worth a shot.The range of sweets available is limited.The prices are reasonable.
