It generally takes 80 mins for this restaurant to deliver the food to me which I think is indeed a very very long time, it should ideally be 1 hour or less, then also if item is missing, it's a bit annoying. Last day, out of 4 food items I ordered, they gave me only 3 then after waiting for another 30 minutes I finally got the Biryani. So, it took a lot of time (75-80 mins) to finally reach the food to my belly.

I have ordered several times from this restaurant named Cassoulet restaurant.
What i like about this restaurant is the price and the quantity of food you get is pretty awesome.
Ordered :
2 chicken biryani
1 egg fried rice 
1 chilli chicken
The taste of the food was normal. You can't expect perfect 5 star taste at such cheaper rate. Chicken biryani contained 1 chicken leg piece 1 egg and 1 aaloo in it, salad was also given.it was good in taste. It was packed in plastic container.
Egg fried rice was tasty and the quantity was also very good for the price, i was quite amazed after seeing it.
Chilli chicken was was spicy and i felt it was overcooked too..
Food delivery was little bit delayed.
Overall it is great for ordering food without buring a hole in your pocket.
Ratings 3.5/5

I had ordered mutton biryani from this restaurant. The biryani was good . But the mutton was undercooked.
Maybe it's a one time thing. Aroma of the biryani was good and you can smell all the spices.

On a sunday i was feeling lathergic and did not want to cook.. then zomato came to my rescue.. i ordered the chicken pulao combo..the food was good... specially the butter chicken i just loved it... the quality of the rice was not that good though but what more one could expect at such price.. the quantity was enough for two persons.. the kababs were not juicy and tender..

I have ordered from here hundreds of times, If I am not in home but nearby my home(relative's place), then also I order from this restaurant.
This restaurant will run long for their pricing & behaviour towards customer. I have tried almost everything from their restaurant. Last year when I started orderung, there was no review of this restaurant but now see the review section, people are happy to order here. they fulfill people's wish within budget. there is no complaint, everything is okay & good. 1 thing I wanna tell them, please increase the size of chicken tikka/ chicken reshmi. otherwise no issues. the way you are fullfilling demand, that's great.
Highlights : their best items are Mutton Biryani, Chicken Kastoori, Tandoori Chicken(you cant find anywhere else within this pricing)
as the demand growing soon they will need to expand or open another branch to fulfill people's demand.

advice for restaurant - keep the prices like this, your business will be more than any big restaurant & people will order again & again from you.

I ordered garlic fried rice, chicken Singapore noodles, Malai Kofta and Chicken Masala. The noodles was decent albeit a bit too spicy. The chicken and malai kofta were also decent. However, the rice is solely responsible for this low rating. It is another thing if the food is not good but it is totally unacceptable if they are serving stale food. This joint here served stale rice. Even with garlic in it, the smell of staleness was evident. 
Sure, their rates are reasonable and everything and Zomato did an excellent job with the delivery but if a restaurant's food is making me fall sick the next morning,then that is just unacceptable. Please improve your quality. Customers are ready to pay more for quality food.

Hello friends,
Before i write something about this just one thing, its entirely my experience. I have ordered multiple times from this place, different dishes every time like chilly chicken, paneer butter masala, chicken do pyaza etc.
Every time i expected something but reality turns something else. Rate for each dishes are quite high considering its quality. Taste is not up to mark, its like okay okay...
But one thing if you have no other option when you want to eat something then only you can go for this. Its delivery speed is good and it accepts order till late night. This is the only reason I have ordered multiple times knowing its taste is not going to satisfy me.

Going through the ordering section I found this place. After Checking the reviews I decided to give it a try.I ordered their chinese best seller mixed frice, followed by chicken manchurian and dragon chicken.The mixed fried rice was good with enough amount of egg, shredded chicken and prawn. The quantity was good, can easily suppress the hunger of two people, Coming to the side dishes, the dragon chicken was tasty, came with six succulent chicken pieces. But the Chicken manchurian disappointed us, pretty average taste, with very small pieces of chicken. Pocket pinch was very much affordable. Will try their mughlai items in my next order.

Every food i have eaten is extra ordinary and the best of quality. Even in rush hours they have never failed. Biriyani is my favorite here but all the other items too are superb. I tried the tandoori parathas last week and it was just delicious...i guess only this restaurant serves so many different types of tandoori parathas..thank you for serving such good food at such low cost.. will miss the taste once i leave kolkata.

From a 2.5 rating to a 4 rating..

While scrolling through the restaurants that would deliver to my place,i stumbled upon this place.
So i thought of giving this place a shot.
Ordered chicken biryani,chicken reshmi kabab and chicken tikka kabab,chilli chicken and firni.
After the order was accepted by the restaurant ,i received the food after 90 mins.
1.Chicken biryani-The biryani was totally cold so i had to reheat it.It had enough amount of rice but the chicken piece was too small.
2.Chicken reshmi and tikka kabab-These are the most awful kababs i have ever had in my life.The kabas were chewy and not at all soft.Reshmi kabab was the worst.I dont know what spices they use for marination but kabab tasted mildly sweet in taste.
This dish was totally blunder.
3.Chilli chicken-It was good in taste .The gravy had chopped garlic ,sliced onions and capsicum.
4.Phirni-This is dish for which i gave a 2.5 rating otherwise i would have given a negative rating to them.Phirni had a strong flavour of kesar and was garnished with raisins.
The total bill was 329 after a 10% discount.

After i posted the review i got a call from the restaurant and they apologized for the food and asked if they could send some complimentary dishes.
So the next day the food arrived and i must say they worked on the points i had mentioned.
The chicken piece in the biryani was larger.
The main item that i complained about was the tikka.
And this time they made it very soft and succulent and the flavours were absolutely perfect.

Brownie points to this restaurant for actually listening to their customer's point and resolving the issue.
Would definitely order again..
Kudos the whole team.

Ordered online the Reshmi+Tikka Kabab Combo. For 130 Rupees it was more than satisfactory, with 12 pieces of Kababs and copious (read huge) side of Green Chutney and Onion slices. Did not rate 5 because the Kababs were chewy and not as succulent as I'd hoped. In all, would order again.

This was our second order from Cassoulet, and now it has become our favourite restaurant in Kestopur. Always good for quantity and price and this time quality was much better from last time (We ordered Kashmiri pulao and kadhai paneer). Other good things were very simple dish like a homemade food(less oil, good smell and taste). However, as an improvement, we may just suggest to include fewer spices (specifically the khada masalas, and some condiments).

Great food with great price . Food was amazingly fresh and yummy to the core. We ordered on phone and got it in 30 minutes flat. Biriyani was just brilliant and phirni was the best in kolkata. We had ordered the keema paratha too which was mouth watering. In whole this restaurant is just superb.

i have been ordering for 6 months now, mostly on phone but i must say that food at this outlet is fabulous. Yesterday night we had a party and we 5 friends ordered chicken tandoori, biriyani, mutton pulao, chicken chap combo, keema tandoori paratha and phirni. Food was amazing and outstanding. Quantity wise the food was too good and price is very cheap. The best part was the tandoori items which was just out of this world, it was too good to be true. Biriyani was light and no dalda. Phirni was cherry on the top...couldnt have asked for more, Thank you for making my party so yummy.

Yesterday I ordered 4 pkts of Veg pulao, 1 Kashmiri Aloo dam, and 1 Chicken do pyaza. Chicken pcs were just meatless full of bones, not upto the mark as per price charged. Veg pulao was too sweet and cashewnut and raisins were missing in it. Kashmiri aloo dam was however ok with great taste. The first two items should be improved in terms of quality as well as taste also.

The Cassoulet special rice was tasty and enough in quantity for a single person. The complete order was worth the amount paid for it. The food was good in terms of quality and quantity. I personally prefer less oily stuffs and hence keeping one star aside for a bit more oil. Else the overall experience is worth for a next time sure shot order. I would suggest that please use a bit less amount of oil as people nowadays prefer less oily foods:)

Pocket friendly... Quantity is ok respect to the price.
We ordered 2 cjicken biriyanis & 2 phirnis.

The chicjen biriyani had conquering smell of the ittar... Which should be reduced to moderate.
The chicken pieces were good in size but sjould have been softer n more juicy.

Their biryani is light and tastes good.
I ordered their special fried rice (chef) and special chicken Chinese . Both were quite good. Rice was filled with prawn chicken egg mushrooms.
However their chicken items indian do taste good but the chicken is not that good. It is not soft.

Ordered for chicken biryani , chili chicken and egg fried rice. Chilli chicken and fried rice wore pretty good. But the biryani had an overpowering rose essence. Delivery was very fast. Overall good with a reasonable pocket pinch!

Out of 10-12items which I have ordered, only 2 times were not upto the mark, rests were good in taste. Some items preparation should improve like - panir butter masala, chilly potato etc. Service is good - some times I got my order within 30mins even... expecting the same in future also & some tasty starter like chilly baby corn should add into your list. Taste of Phirni also should have to be improved.

I just dont know why good restaurants fail in their service. One of the best food outlets in kestopur but their service is so poor. You order food via phone and have to wait like 2 hours for the food to be delivered. Such poor service. Every time you call back to track your order, different people will receive calls and they are sound as if you never ordered. Such poor service. Kindly get your food by yourself if you dont want to be a sitting duck.

Ahh, what a great budget restaurant..er more an outlet though..but great nonetheless..got the eid special..chicken n mutton biriyanis,3 plates each, ind packed for throwaway prices.they offer for 5 plates too.calcutta style biriyani- better than i've had at many pricier outlets.long grain rice perfectly cooked, potato n meat melt in the mouth.the spice level just right, most budget biriyanis put a ton of ittar, not here.had chicken korma n paneer malai kofta as sides..both good dishes except the malai kofta can do with less whole cardamom(elaichi),tandoori roti was soft n not burnt as most places tend to make it.delivery was on time.overall, a great find, pocket friendly yet tasty, good portion sizes with a varied menu

I've ordered for home delivery from this restaurant many times now.¬†

The delivery was timely in most cases.¬†

I've tried starters as well as main course from this place, mostly, chicken gravy items, crispy chicken, baby corn. The food quality is good, but a bit too oily, especially for chicken biryani and chicken chap which I ordered.

Earlier there was 10% discount, but disappointed the discount is not existent now.

Like the kebab items, and the noodles.

Indian Maincourse needs improvement up here, as once i ordered chicken butter masala and it wasn't up to the mark.But overall for Casual Eating,You can try this place out. I am sure you will love it!

Seriously pathetic.
This rating is not just because of one day but series of consecutive orders. The review below is of last 3-4 orders
Crispy Chicken ordered was too saltly, and cheewy.
Crispy Babycorn was same. It was just salty with no other taste.
Chicken Bharta of today broke the records. After one hour of order, when the order dint arrive, we called, so then he said he will come. Now the quality was up to mark, and the quantity was just handful not even sufficient for a single person. When we called for complain, they said, come tomorrow morning as shop is closed now.

The issue after the complaint was resolved, and the order was resent which of good quality and in proper quantity.

Review based on a chicken biryani and green salad order.
Pros - cheap price + discount.
On time delivery.
Cons- biryani I ordered was dry ( don't know if they generally make it like that or not).
There was a weird smell throughout the dish. ( Maybe the oil they used was nearing rancidity).
Overall good food. Would try again.

This review is based on a home delivery done by Cassoulet restaurant through Zomato. We ordered for only two veg fried rice from here, originally the price should be rs100 but they have a 15% discount if you order through Zomato. So the amount came to rs85. The fried rice is really tasty. Even the delivery was quick, it came even before the estimated time slot given. I recommend it for people who stays in Kestopur for home delivery.

A very delicious and yummy experience for me. The best part is that total charges for the above 2 dishes is 127 only. The delivery person was very humble to me and he was open for suggestions . I would recommend this restaurant to everyone as it takes care of your special instructions regarding gravy as well as delivery point.

This review is based on a home delivery done by Cassoulet restaurant through Zomato. We ordered for only two veg fried rice from here, originally the price should be rs100 but they have a 15% discount if you order through Zomato. So the amount came to rs85. The fried rice is really tasty. Even the delivery was quick, it came even before the estimated time slot given. I recommend it for people who stays in Kestopur for home delivery.

As usual great food on time lovely taste the mutton was so good hardly any effort had to be put to debone the mutton which is generally the case in most of the outlets. .and the chicken masala was heavenly accompanied by  perfect tandoori roti's and Jeera Rice..Cheers  Team..Looking forward  to the Phirni in the evening missed out the same at lunch..

Ordered the Chicken biryani and Chap combo a day before yesterday.The food was average in taste, and the quantity was sufficient for the price charged and delivery was timely.But I was really put off since I found a hair in the biryani. That really turned me off.Would not recommend.

I am very regular to this food kiosk but their quality n quantity is deterioting everyday, I had ordered crispy chicken which costed Rs 105,was absolutely horrible. Quantity has been reduced like anything.I hv nvr ever expected this from cassoulet. Will think to reorder from here in future.

Most underrated restaurant!. restaurant deserve 5 star.
Today i ordered peas pulao and chicken tikka butter masala. food was just awesome and tasty!Unlike other restaurant peas pulao had cashew and raisins.
food was delivered exactly in 45 mins as promised. Quantity is for 2 people.Hence requesting to introduce half plate for single people like me.

no tax, no delivery charges! 15% discount. What more u want?

Amazing super delicious food. We have ordered many times and every time the food has been well prepared and delectable - both Chinese and Indian. Special mention to their biriyani and tandoori dishes - really mouth watering and heavenly.

Lip smacking food for both starters and main course category - we tried both Indian and Chinese cuisines and both were very good. A must try items: Chicken Bharta, Chicken Cutlet and Handi Chicken among others

if you are looking for a good food and yet pocket-friendly,¬† cassoulet is the best option in Samarpally, keshtopur. (Chinese cuisines). My Fav. Hot garlic chicken & Chicken tikka butter masala¬† (if you love spicy food )

I really don't understand why the rating is 3 in zomato???
We have ordered multiple time...and cassoulet never gave  us an opportunity for complaining ...
Whether it is a Chinese recipe or Indian recipe it is always comes more than our expectation...
