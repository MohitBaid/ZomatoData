Its a very small place to be in. The quality of food is also not that great and price is also relatively high, but the position of this place is good

We went for lunch and nothing other than biryani could satisfy our appetite .... The biryani tasted good... You might have to wait for sometime to dine inside....it is filled up during the festival seasons...also you could opt for 'take away' service which is very prompt... ambience is satisfactory ... Food qualityâ€‹ satisfactory too .... Could be given another visit

I must say  this is the worst dhaka biriyani house. though it is an a/c restaurant but service is very poor , food quality is not good. Sometimes you have to go out and search for the waiter , ask a multiple times for water, spoon n all. Wont recommend at all . Though I found the takeaway service was good enough, so you may give it a try for takeaways.

Started off well but now the biriyani parcel boxes are gradually getting smaller and the chicken pieces are bonier.... The service men have a secret trick of packing food... They create an illusion as if biriyani is heaped up in the box whereas the quality is actually insufficient!

Very good option for having some north Indian and Chinese foods... quite spacious... I tried there chicken biriyani and chicken reshmi kabab both were very tasty... but I find the chicken being bit chewy... Staffs and service was ok... Pocket pinch was bit high as per the quality...

We Ordered 3 chicken biriyani's (As biriyani is special in here) and 2 chicken kassa.
Both dishes were not bad at all.. Pretty decent i must say..
But the service of this restaurant was suck(very slow)
Interior is normal.
Overall good..

One of the very famous Biryani restaurant at Sodepur. Visited this place once for their Biryani. Biryani was okay type, not too much oil and made perfectly. Still lags much in quality as they asks to pay Rs.140 for Chicken Biryani which is almost near to what brands like Arsalan, Aminia. Prices here is bit higher.

Previously, they were a restaurant that I liked because they were the only ones that provided decent biriyani in the vicinity of Sodepur. But given my experience with Shiraz and Arsalan (which happens to be my all time favourite since 2003, in recent visits, I am liking their style of making and taste of Biriyani much more. 
Nothing extraordinary, but definitely the place to go to for your Biriyani fix and tandoor special dishes

I once visited the restaurant besides the roadside,the ambience was the same as that of the other dhaka.. but the biryani that we ordered was not up to the mark.. the was unfortunately two potatoes in the biryani which was offending and annoying.. 
Could have given a better performance...

This is the last place I'll go to for biriyani in sodepur .  Already there is a lack of good restaurants then there is this whose speciality is Biriyani . I don't like the chicken they give. The cooking is also not good.

Yesterday I went there for some parcel.... I reached there around 8:30 PM and ordered One Chicken Biriyani n one Chicken Reshmi Kabab.... Serving time was too slow.... Although staffs behavior are good.... Chicken Reshmi Kabab was not good because chicken was too chewy.... Biriyani's chicken pieces was very stiff.... Cost was reasonable....

Located opposite to the shriniketan. Been here 2-3 times. They used to serve standard biriyani. Nothing extraordinary. Food quality has fallen over past two years. 

Update May 5, 17
Food quality has improved. We ordered chicken biriyani with chicken chaap and mutton kosha and veg Hakka chowmein with veg Manchurian. Quality of biriyani has improved quite a bit. Mutton kosha was good and rest are standard.

A standard small restaurant in Sodepur. Started out much smaller though. Have got a longer list in the menu now! Food, ambience, price : standard. Recommended for biriyani lovers in and around Sodepur area only. Food is priced on similar lines with brands like Aminia, but quality is not upto that mark.

For this type of places, the locality faces food crisis. Don't even think about visting there during puja time. If ur a biriyani lover better visit barackpore.

Located just beside Readymade Centre.
One can easily find the place for the rich smell.
Initially it was only biriyani was served.
But few years back they also started the Chinese section.
I have tried both North Indian and Chinese dishes.
Good in quality and quantity.
For a sudden eating out this may be on your list if you dwell near to this joint.

Decent bieiyani house...
I usually go for takeaways...
Once during durga puja i went there for family lunch
And the biriyani was just yakk... Couldnt hav it. Chicken chap was too horrible...
I know it was durga puja and wishing for good food is myth... still they should have atleast serve edible food.
Anyways other then that experience
My other experiences were good
..
Mutton r tender n juicy...
Quantity is good

A very popular food joint for Biryani Lovers. Although the amount is good and sufficient for one person, the preparation is very rich. A soft drink or a glass of soda is a must if you choose to have a plate of biryani here. Overall an average food joint for having biryani. There are better biryani joints at Sodepur than this at a better price.

Recommended if you're a fan of Dhaka style biriyani.Â 
Located at a distance of max. 5 minutes of walk both from Sodepur Railway station and B.T. Road.Â 
Decent quality and quantity wise.Â 
Service is satisfactory.
Not a huge place, but you won't face a space crunch inside.Â All in all, you won't regret for what you're paying.
