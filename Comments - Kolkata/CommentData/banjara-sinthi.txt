It was a horrible experience. The food was not at all hot and it seemed stale. The taste was also not good. Very disappointed with the quality of the food. Though the cost is affordable but it was not satisfying.

Not more than 15minutes of walk from Sinthi More will lead you to this shelter of delicacies. Banjara will give you a discrete environment with handful of admirable items to get stuffed with. We had 'Mixed Hakka Noodles' alongwith 'Five Spices Chicken' . The firmly cooked noodles alongwith evenly steamed veggies & prawn will definitely tempt your taste bud. Coming to the 2nd one, the 'chickens' were superb. The chicken dipped along with the mixed vegan spicey gravys will slowly sooth your appetite. I suggest not to resist your stomach for giving a try over here ;)

It is a sub standard restaurant. What is really sad is the fact that most of the images used by the restaurant are downloaded from the web, they don't serve those dishes. I have been there once, very unfriendly waiters and poor hygiene with average food, which is Normal for a neighborhood restaurant as they are more or less usually like that, but the fact they are using fake images is misleading. But anyone with half of a brain should be able to figure that out.

Whenever you visit, you'll not find a single customer.
This fat lady..may be the onwer, always bzy with her phone .. will not listen to your suggestions.

Ordered egg fried rice, and lemon fish.
Rice was like some kind of Street food, and i must tell you. The fish was horrible. stinking like hell.and billed us 220 for that stinky lemon fish, and egg rice was 135.
Pay bit more and go somewhere else,but not here.

Chicken wrap Prawn, Chilli Mustard Chicken & Fish, Chicken Korean Stick, Gai Sai Takrai Chicken, Salt & Pepper Prawn, Chicken Ho Fan etc....All of this items are new creation by Banjara. So friends of North Kolkata , why are you waiting for???? Just go once and have some mouth watering dishes in a great ambience with your friends, family or beloved one whom you want to go with. Within Sinthimore area compare to the other restaurants this is the best place for having food or take away whichever you prefer I must say. So don't wait friends and just try their wonder creations must.

The worst restaurant in Baranagar. Any time you go there, you will find it empty. The locals faithfully avoid it, however despite knowing this, I went there recently with my friend as it was raining and we badly needed a shelter. We wanted to have a chicken pakora but that wasn't listed in the menu, but from my past experience I knew that it's available, so ordered it without asking for the price. What we got delivered was 8 pieces of flour and coriander leaves pakora with some sprinkles of chicken... the worst food I've ever had, and they charged us rs.180 for those coriander pakoras.¬†

Not only this, go any day and order anything, they always serve stale food, you can't even bite through the chicken pieces, taste like rubber or shoe-sole. If you are suicidal, then only go there.

We had a party at a friend's house. We wanted something with alcohol and went through zomato for reference. We found this resturant's name mentioning reasonable price. So we went there and ordered dry chilli chicken. The shop is under renovation and we were there for take away. The staffs were generous. The chicken was well cooked, a little overcooked but tasted awesome. The size was small, but the quantity was enough. It was a good experience.¬†P.S: The Menu is outdated, I was unable to get a pic as I left my mobile home.10 pcs Chilli Chicken- Rs.160

Been to this restaurant today as one of our regular visit.. The food is as normal very tasty sply the chinese food but the behaviour of the staff is very rude and not at all expectable from any hotel staff. Unfortunately it was required to change the diaper of my baby and my wife took her to bathroom and change the diaper.But as there was no dustbin avaiable in that washroom, she left the diaper at one corner beside the comod,away from normal view. And after she came out,the floor staff insisted us to take that baby diaper out of bathroom and forced to throw to the front road. We feel really humilated and embarrassed by the behaviour we received from the hotel staff and strongly recommend the restaurant owner to recruit staffs who have proper behaviourial training to work for any hotel industry.

20th of March, 2016 - Arguably one of the special days in my life. I have learnt many things on that day! Life will be as it should be, If you plan 'TOO HARD' for 'PERFECTION' it will be a total Chaos! That's what exactly happened at 'The Heart of The City of Joy' - Esplaned/Dhormotola. I APOLOGISE for what I did on that day. Countless hours of without sleep and efforts (I don't blame anyone) & it was (If I be absolute honest) ALL IN VAIN.¬†

When the beginning is not good, irrespective of whatever happens Its not perfect! Lets see....I failed to make it a Happy wala, or Picture Perfect B'day!¬†
Ta jai hok,¬†
1st of all I thank Banjara for allowing us to organise a Surprise Birthday party at their place! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! The service stuff were kind and very helpful.

Coming to the food we ordered many things (eg Chowmein, Chicken etc) and it was Yum. Loved it. Yes I will VISIT HERE AGAIN when all will be PERFECT and it will be pretty soon. Even if it's not perfect, I will come again.

I loved their ambience. Though we were on day time, next time I'll visit here at night! Food quantity is justified compared with the price.¬†

Thank You,

Soothing ambience, nice decorated inside. You would love the time to be spent here. The food quality is poor. The preparations doesn't taste good. Reasonably priced but needs improvement in the food quality.

Very good ambience. Well decorated. Food quality is average. Price is not very bad. But the main thing is food quality and taste which requires a lot improvement.

Banjara has been around for quite a while, and they have undergone some changes in ambience recently. The decor is spacious and inviting. The food is delicious. The quantity is more than sufficient, and this applies to the take away as well. Prompt service everytime I have been there. Whether a dinner with my family or for having a home delivery.

It has always been an easy option for me to drop down with or without reason here owing to its vicinity and mainly for its simple yet spacious decor and subtle dim light eve effect. So, it was primarily these factors that urged me to pay a visit there the last time. And seriously, this time really annoyed by their extreme delay in service. I mean, this is really heights, categorically every time they have some or the other issue for the same. I don't have much to say about the quality and the food as it good enough and reasonable as well. But trust me guyz, you got to presume that every customer to walks in, is in some kind of urgency even if he isn't and plan your services accordingly because each one look for a swift service these days.

I visited Banjara in the Puja's as my boyfriend stays there,he introduced me to this place. My group of friends were pretty much hungry.. So without giving a second thought.. We entered the place.. But it was strange to me..that in the peak season also the place was empty.. Not crowded.
The Decor was simple but good.. They serve north indian and chinese so we opted for chinese and order some noodles and fried rice and Chicken manchurian and chilli chicken.. All total the food was average.
People in Sithimore have misconception that this place is costly but it isn't rather its a good place for dinning.

I like the Reshmi Butter Masala . Their chicken Fried Rice is also good. The portion size is the best among all places in this locality. The Butter naan tends get chewy when eaten after half an hour. Takeaway is what makes me come back here.

The food quality of this restaurant is surprisingly good, certainly better than the other restaurants operating in the Sinthi-Baranagar area. I ordered for the first time from their restaurant this year only & my overall experience was very pleasing. The ordering & delivering procedures were handled with utmost courtesy. The items offered are nothing exceptional but the quality & quantities are decent. Try their Baked Chicken item which is definitely 'special'.

Visited last night for dinner. The place was decent with not much decorations or no specific ambiance but the food is reasonably good.
We ordered chicken kassa and some other chicken dish that I don't remember. But overall the food had good taste and was satisfying. 200 bucks per head is enough for this place and reasonably pocket friendly.

During the puja time i have visited this place with my family...they serve north indian and chinese and have a simple decor inside...the food is not that great yet a decent one located in the baranagar area ..

we ordered for fried rice,manchurian chicken, plain nan and mutton kasha and chicken bharta...all these items i have tasted were decent ones and quite filling...the food is good its plain and simple...and tastes good ..

the management people were friendly and servers were good but very slow in serving with the food...that is the con i find with the restaurant otherwise its a decent plce with family ..it is not that heavy on the pocket and a good place to be..

A moderate place to have dinner with friends and family. I found that people near sinthi area believe that this place is at the costlier side and thats y they don't prefer it. whereas I found it quite in budget. cost for 3 was 400.
