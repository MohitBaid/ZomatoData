Sarat Sweets on Surya Sen Street is another small outlet here in College Street area. They feature almost all kind of ordinary bengali sweets. I have visited here a numerous time and tasted their sweets. They range from average to good and comes with a small price tag of Rs.5-10

Tried their sweets a couple of time mostly while I used to go for dinner at Surya Sen Street. Sarat Sweets has an average quality sweets. Not satisfactory. You can only try the lancha which I found to be well. The Sandesh weren't good and had small size. Most of the sweets are priced at Rs.5.
Not much recommend.

Nothing special about it. Just a regular road side sweet shop. Quality is average. They sell only traditional sweets. Price is reasonable. Kochuri, singara are also available.

Located near College Square , it offers various sweets starting from Nolengur Sandesh , Rabri , Rosomalai , Chomchom & other sweets which are tasty but my personal favourite are the Raj Bhogs And Rosogollas. 
Not as great as Mouchak Or Putiram in that area but good enough .
