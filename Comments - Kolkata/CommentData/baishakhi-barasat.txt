it was my 1st anniversary.. i thought to order our get together dinner from baishakhi..never thought its going to be a blunder.ordered 5plates of biriyani.. and 5 plates were rotten. smell was horrible.. the mutton was hard. on the next day i decided to let them know about the incident. i went to the restaurant and spoke to a gentleman.. then another aged stuff come to me and said, i dont know whether its true or not, but didi ' erokom to hote e pare'.. i mean really!! is it very normal get embarrased on your special day?? i won't never recommend this place to anyone..but request to authority pls show some responsibility, we pay you for good food not for rotten, uneatable foods..

Ordered chilly fish which was not at all upto the mark. It proves the old saying 'bengalis cannot do business '.100%true.they compromise with the quality of food. Never order anything from this rotten one.

Went to this restaurant today for eating and relaxing on the day of mahasaptami, the first day of Durga Puja. The restaurant had arranged for a special festive menu with exclusively Bengali dishes, in addition to their normal menu, for the Puja period. We reached the restaurant at about 2.40 pm, and waited outside for about 20 minutes, because all the tables were occupied. We ultimately managed to get a table at about 3 pm.
I found that this restaurant has a shortage of space, which can be a problem on special days like today when more people visit restaurants to eat. Nearly half of the tables are arranged in such a way that, two people can sit on chairs and the remaining 2 or 3 people of that group will have to sit on cushioned benches placed against the wall ; so that they can lean their backs only against the wall. We were politely told that some of the items printed on the special festive menu card would not be available. The quality of the food served was quite satisfactory, and the staff were very polite, and the rates were quite economical. My overall impression of this restaurant  is that, it's a good place to eat at with an economical budget, on normal days when there are no crowds.

Easy to locate and pocket friendly restaurant at barasat colonymore. Food was not something very good but price wise decent and quantity was also good.Staffs are attentive and well behaved.i was not happy with ambience. It can be improved.ordered rice, dal, aluvaja, mach, murgir mangso and chatni. All items except fish were good. Fish was not fresh and had a bad smell. For this reason i am giving u 2.5.Other fish and prawn items were not available. One more thing..service was very slow.

Went there during the Kali puja in 2016 with a friend. This was one decent looking restaurant within the area. Even my friend had praised the food so had to give it a try. At around 3 pm when we went there, the place was already full, but the person outside assured to give us a table as soon as possible, and within 15 minutes we got a table. The place is not very big, but not very small either. There was nothing extraordinary about the ambience to be honest, but thats okay. The lights were dimmed, which was soothing. We ordered chicken biriyani, one plate each. It took about another 15-20 minutes for the food to come. At first we thought the quantity was less but it was more than enough. The portions of chicken and potato were generous. The biriyani was really delicious. Beautiful aroma, finely cooked, awesome taste. The the balance of flavour, spices and oil was perfect. It was one of the best biriyanis I had ever tasted. The behaviour of the staff was okay, nothing to complain. At the time we visited, there were no taxes. Overall good experience in a place like Barasat. Worth another visit.

Food is served fresh. The Chinese delicacies r a must have. It's d specialty of this place. Tandoori platter r d next best thing..if one wants to hav north Indian.
Chilli chicken.. mix fried rice.. Manchurians.. tikkas.. they r some of my favorites. We all wl however highly recommend a little renovation n makeover of d interiors! Dey look very boring n old.

Service was good. We ordered chiken biriyani, veg fried rice and mughlai chiken. The quantity of biriyani was quite good but it lacked the flavour and essence, so did the veg fried rice. I liked the mughlai chiken though and the garnishing was colourful! Overall it's ok for a quick dine out and pocketfriendly.

I stay at Barasat in a place, very near to this restaurant, hence quite aware of the good and not so good aspects of this restaurant. My suggestion is....do not go there for Chinese items, as it is not bad, but not that good and comparable with any Chinese restaurant....however coming to North Indian food it is just opposite, starting from tandoor to main course gravy, nun, Biriyani, everything is excellent...small place, good ambiance, humble behavior of staffs, reasonable price, good and tasty food

Good sitting though not great. Ordered gravy noodles, fried rice, chili chicken, didn't go for any experiments cause i was skeptical. Gravy of noodles was good, but the noodles used were sub standard. Chicken pieces were good in chili chicken, the fried rice was average, it didn't contain even a single drop of soya sauce!!! Cmmon, it's chinese, you have to use soya sauce or oyster sauce!!!!

Cozy little outlet with decent food.
If you are expecting brilliant decor, great service and an experience worth revisiting..... this place will surely disappoint.
The location being Barasat and the number of customers being few, we must not have high-end expectations.
You live in Barasat and you have had a terrible day at work, completely exhausted and need a quick refreshment through foodomance (romance with food).... not in a mood to travel much, then this can be the place for you.
Recommendations : Pan Fried Chilly Fish, Chicken Handi and Mutton Biriyani (if you prefer it light and dry).
Never had a chance to try their Bengali Cuisine, so no opinion on that.

The food here sells just for its location (right at Colony More) and for people's crave for fast food.
Food quality is average to okay. Quantity is fine. Services are very slow. Ambience is kinda stuffy.
Once I ordered the normal Chicken Tikka and the pieces were so so so much dry and over-grilled.
