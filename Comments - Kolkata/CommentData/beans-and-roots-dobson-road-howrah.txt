THE place for the coffee lovers! Haven't come across so many varieties of coffee under one roof.. everything in-house and quality of products being used is given the top most priority.. even though not a coffee lover but Portugal Mazagran just made my day.. Must try!  Looking forward to try more!

Was not an ardour coffee lover untill i found BEANS & ROOTS. Tried cold portugal masagran ( basically its coffee lemonade) and Brazilian cold coffee.....

1. Portual masagan is not available anywhere in kolkata, its a substitute for iced lemon tea. JUST LOVED IT GUYS.
2. Cold coffee is very easily available in kolkata, but once u try in here, u ll surely gonna forget abt the likes of barista, ccd, starbucks and others.

Its a place where u would love to go again and again. Whenever i go to howrah side, i m surely going to visit BEANS & ROOTS without fail. Icing on the cake is pricing is very reasonable.
THUMBS UP GUYS..
keep up the good work.

Amazing hands at work. They just exactly know how to blend it right. New stuff around and also can't be debated that the tasteful caffeine is in the right hands at Beans and Roots. My experience was as good as it could be. : )

A beautiful joint, the perfect place to hangout with your friends while sipping on a cup, no let me correct, on several cups of coffee. The variety, the taste, the presentation is bound to leave you in awe. The iced coffees are to die for. Craving for more!

In the end,all you want is a good cup of coffee !!

To start with,this place has a refreshing look to it.Not the usual over exaggerated coffee pictures everywhere,with unnecessary over the top quotes written all over.

This joint relies on the one thing that the customers look for the most....Great tasting coffee !!

They have a knack for experimenting with different kind of coffees from different parts of the globe.I have had my share of the Starbucks and the CCDs...and I can safely say that Beans and Roots has satisfied the coffee lover in me the most.

What's good about them is the commitment towards providing good quality products with continuous innovation and all this at amazing prices.

To sum it up in one line :

Coffee lovers,you have found your paradise !!

This is the place to visit if you are crossing this area. This place has this enchanting coffee aroma all around it which is quite tempting as a coffee lover!!
Even the staffs are warm and welcoming ..We tried three flavoured cold coffee which had perfect blend of chocolate and Irish coffee and the hot Mocha was just perfect.. it's totally value for money with varied menu and a must visit for coffee lovers!!
