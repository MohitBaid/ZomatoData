This is a nice place with good decor and a lot of items in the menu list. I was impressed to see the varieties of items that they serve at this small restaurant. 
The menu contains snacks, sandwiches, north Indian cuisine, Bengali cuisine and Chinese cuisine etc. at a reasonable price. 
The food is not great but good. I preferred the Bengali cuisine.

Drishti is a in house multi cuisine restaurant in Hotel Sudesh Tower near Desapriya Park. The decoration of the restaurant is nice. The ambience is good .. But the pricing is too high.

Drishti is a in house multi cuisine restaurant in Hotel Sudesh Tower near Desapriya Park. The decoration of the restaurant is nice. We went there for a lunch. 
We were the only guest in the restaurant at 3 PM. The behaviour of the stuff was very good. They welcomed us warmly and gave us a good seat.
We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala And Butter Nun. Butter Nun was really tasty but Chicken Tikka Marsala was average. It contains 8 very small pieces of chicken. They also provide a complementary mocktail. 
Nice place near Desapriya Park to have lunch or dinner.

Drishti is the restaurant of Sudesh Banquet & Hotel. The restaurant is like a hidden gem in this area. The location might be a little tricky to find. It is located in a by lane of Sarat bose Rd. Nearest landmark being the deshapriya park. 

Sampled the #VegetableMakkhanwala & #PaneerDoPyaza with #ButterNaan & all tasted delicious. The paneer do pyaza is a must try, though the butter naan lacked in butter. 

The interiors are nothing extravagant but seem ok. The seats are comfortable & the staff courteous. The ambiance and interiors can be improved with better & warm lighting. On the whole it's a good option in this area.

I will surely have the Grill Cheese Chicken Sandwich from here whenever I visit Kolkata next time. You just gotta eat that sandwich and I promise you won't be disappointed! I had ordered a thornless fish curry too (I don't remember the name of the dish) and to be honest, it was the best fish curry I ever had! The only small complain is that the spread of buffet can be better, but the sandwich and fish curry make up for it! Amazing experience overall.

"Drishti"- An unusual name for a restaurant. Whatever the name is, the place is good. The only problem is the location. You can't find it until you know there is a restaurant. 
Last Sunday I went there with my group of friends, a huge one. I was searching for such a restaurant which will be spacious and not that famous instead, will serve good food. Thanks to

Lets with the question I asked myself after my first visit to Drishti :
"HOW COME I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE BEFORE?"

A few friends accompanied me for lunch. Honestly, all of us were awestruck by the entire experience.
We were escorted inside the hotel to the multicuisine restaurant.

The first surprise was a complimentary fruit juice. All smiles throughout the table. :)

We loved the minimal ambiance and the brilliant hospitality. The entire food was served to us, and for that purpose, one of the staff members stayed near us throughout the meal.

Coming to the food, they made an absolutely lip-smacking DAL MAKHANI. NAAN and TANDOORI ROTI made good accompaniments.

The CHICKEN TANDOORI was satisfying and the spicy, tender pieces were served well.

Moving apart from the North Indian cuisine, the AMERICAN CHOPSUEY tasted different (in a positive sense). Its sauce was not the reddish one I was accustomed to, hence the chopsuey looked more like a plate of gravy noodles.

The amazing experience finished with the extacy of a pocket-friendly bill (read : exceptionally pocket-friendly bill), and that made my day.

Foodie or not, I recommend this place to everyone!

Location: Off Sarat Bose Road. 

This multi-cuisine restaurant is located in one of the bylanes off Sarat Bose Road. 
It's more like a hidden gem and is not known to a lot of people. 
This places serves delightful food with excellent hospitality. 
The ambiance is quite simple and subtle. The interiors were nicely done. 
Being near to my place, visited it a couple of weeks back along with my family. 

Coming straight to the fooding, had ordered the following: 

Dal Makhani 
The black lentils were perfectly cooked and retained a creamy texture. Was delicious. 

Pindi Chana
Perfectly boiled chickpeas tossed and tempered with Indian spices. 
Tasted great. 

Vegetable Makhanwala 
It was more like the Vegetable Jhalfarezi, but with a creamy texture and the veggies being slightly tossed (read: sauté) in butter. Could have been slightly more flavored (read: addition of spices). 
Was decent enough. 

Tandoori Roti 
Was made as per personal preferences (read: soft/crisp) 

Pudina Paratha 
Had the right amount of Pudina powder in it and was served with a slight brush of butter. 

Masala Kulcha 
The Kulcha was nicely baked and was served with a dollop of butter on top, but, what disappointed me was the lack of flavours in the filling. The filling also lacked a bit of salt. 

The staff was courteous and the service was prompt. 
A pocket friendly affair. 

A plus for the place to also have home delivery facilities. 

Overall a good experience. 
-Revisiting soon. Yet to try the remaining Cuisines.

People prolly don't know about this place for whatever reason... Their bad. The food here is as good as some reputed restaurant or anything. Or prolly even better than what we conventionally go to. The service is brilliant. And so is the food. Totally worth a visit.
