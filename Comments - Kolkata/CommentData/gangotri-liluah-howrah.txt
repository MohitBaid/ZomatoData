One of the best Veg Restaurants.... Tried Paneer 65, it's awesome....so far the best preparation I've. Mysore Masala Dosa is also a great new item to be try out. The menu card shown here is not the actual one.

Location: Near MCKV School.
Ambiance: As of a sweet shop. Dont expect trained staff, but they do a decent job in serving.
Sweets and snacks here are fresh, tastes decent. Love the bombay patties here. 
Today tried a cutlet which I found extra oily. The bread patties I tried had similar fillings like a cutlet and is very heavy.

Pocket pinch is very low and has scattered chairs for seating downstairs and some proper seating in their restaurant upstairs.

P.S: My review is based upon the snacks and sweets counter and not the restaurant upstairs.

Recently I have been here..... Firstly.. It doesn't look like a restaurant.... While I entered..... It was a total mess of chairs and tables lying here and there... Then I came to know.. That need to go upstairs.... And that too.. I had to ask them personally.... Then they told... Otherwise they were busy laughing and giggling among themselves... The ambience is too dim.... The snack was good... To be honest... But service is bad... There is no sink upstairs... The staff was making unpleasant noises while arranging chairs...

Worst food,worst service,staffs are too slow and very careless. Worst taste.. never go here. You will totally waste your Money.  Think before going here. Staff service  looks like in a park.

The ambience is good and so is the food. Servicing by staff was too slow. The quality and quantity of food is also good. Overall a good veg restaurant.!!

The sweets there are well tasted. It is specialized in North and South Indian dishes mainly and we ordered something which is buttery. Yes you get that right the Pav Bhaji. Being a bong foodie, I can't control my "mouth-watering" when I see sweets ðŸ˜Š. Though we had to wait much here mbut wait was worth. Pav bhaji was awesome with right amount of everything and of course the variety of sweets. Aha! Kaju barfi and this took my heart.
