One of the best in Bhawanipur area for awesome South India food. Quantity absolutely matches with prices offered and no compromise on quality.

A tiny restaurant beside the induction, near the children's Park in Bhawanipur. This place is specialized in their South Indian food. I had ordered a masala cheese dosa and a plate of idli. Never had such an amazing dosa. Idli was soft too. The coconut chutney is the cherry on the cake. Very pocket friendly. Do not expect good ambience from it. A must visit for the South Indian lovers!

Do not expect an ambience for this tiny restaurant. They are experts when it comes to South Indian food. Class apart. I have never had such soft and delicious Idly ever.Be it Dosa or uttapam everything is just so good. Have eaten in this joint several times and would keep going here .

This place may not look like its a hidden gem in bhawanipore. But it is a very well known resto or a outlet for south indian dishes. Dosas they make are a foodie's delight and deserve clap for maitaining the standard of its dishes. I love cheese masala dosa and idlis here. The coconut chutney they make us the best i had at kolkata. But the problem with this place is that it stays closed most of the time, reasons unknown. And also the rush is so much here. But overall a nice joint for refreshmnt.

I had an amazing South Indian breakfast here this morning. This one has been an all time favourite place for takeaway but I remember not using the seating because of limited capacity they have.

We used the car service today and it was a really nice and steamy hot breakfast in this beautiful rainy morning. 

Coming to USP of this place, it has to be the idlis. They serve massive sized ones, fluffy soft and just perfect. I think their idli is the biggest in Kolkata keeping in mind most other eateries. For me personally finishing a full plate as in two pieces became quite a task towards the end. 

The coconut chutney served is really nice and thick. It is topped with urad dal, mustard seeds and curry leaves which have been tempered in oil with a hint of red chilli powder.

The sambhar was not as good today as it usually is. I love the sambhar from 
here. Today something was slightly amiss  though.

The vadas here are good too. Today I had no space left for them after the idlis though.
I am a fan of their Masala dosas , specially the Masala. The dosa size is just perfect. And they make it perfectly as per instructions.

The idlis here are must try. This place has a huge fan following and regular customers so food here runs out of stock very fast. 

The prices are totally pocket friendly. The staff is pleasant and attentive. They keep filling up the chutney and sambhar bowls.

The menu is quite limited in terms of variety but in terms of taste this place ranks amongst my top 5 south Indian favourites in Kolkata.

Good food, small outlet and very friendly on pocket.
You must try out the dosa's out here. 

Recommended for takeaway's coz usually you would find rush during evenings.

A very small place near Chakraberia. It serves excellent South Indian food. It is not hi-fi, swanky place but a very simple and small joint. Their butter masala dosa and idli are really great.

Idli size is very nice.
price is also very ok.
place is small but food being good makes over that.
the price in the menu here and price in menu exactly there did not match
maybe here is the old menu.
