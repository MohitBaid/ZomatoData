One has to make an effort to search for this restaurant even if one is a local.  The place is an example of marketing gone absolutely wrong.  The store is situated near Garia More, just behind Aminia restaurant. As is understood from the nameof the store, they highlight a theme based on Harry Potter, although how it affects their culinary is beyond my imagination. The restaurant has some photos of various characters from the Harry Potter series and the television happens to screen HP films. 
The waiters are ill trained and service is unattractive. They lacked knowledge about the menu and we were on our own. 

Coming to the food, frankly we did not expect much. 
Service was fast as we were the only diners in a Saturday nightüòêüòë.. However as the dishes started to arrive one after another we were overwhelmed by the quality and quantity it offers. I had the best Sweet corn soup and Garlic fish in quite some time over here.
 The price is justifiable and pocket friendly(they don't charge GST). 
Overall this restaurant deserve more footfall and appreciation. If you are tired of the conventional restaurants in the Garia locality, try this one.  It would be a pleasant change.

I love to explore new restaurants. On this Diwali, I suggested my friends to go to Hogwartz Den (just behind Aminia Garia).they agreed and we went there. We got amazed by the food and the service. I must recommend people to go and explore the noshes. I don't write any review on Zomato. I found the ambience great..!!!

The ambiance of Hogwarts den restuarant is too good...the restuarant ambiance is based on Harry potter story....
Now lets talk about the food....I orderd their hogwartz den special kebab....it's just 4.6 out of 5....too good...
They have Chinese and north Indian dishes. ..
The food quality is good...the behaviour of servants r really good...the serve the food very fast...

New restro
Just beside aminia garia
Prices inclusive of gst
Ordered tandoori rooti plain nun and chicken bharta
Food was good in taste good quality and quantity
Ambience is very nice specially for harry potter fans
They lack in waiter service..
As only 2 waiters were there and it was difficult for them to handle so many people at a time
Tables were left uncleaned after one finished their food we had to ask them repeatedly for cleaning and giving extra spoons, tissue paper..
Nevermind new restro hope to see  the service and food improved üëç

It is not at all clean. The glasses,the spoons everything was so damn dirty wid all white white stuffs in it. Infact the waiters there just isn't bother to clean the table after a group left. They were serving on the same dirty table. The food was ok.

Must try their chicken tandoori, its awesome, soft and juicy. Other foods like biriyani and naan are quite ordinary and i would rate them 3/5. The price is pretty high relative to the quantity.
The environment, as the name suggests,  is preety much magical with Harry Potter poster all around.A good place for potter fans

We had ordered for Chicken Thai Soup, Fish with salt and pepper as Starters, Mixed Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken in the main course.
Soup was ok, fish with salt and pepper was tasty but more on a saltier side, however they asked to replace the same.
Mixed Fried rice included prawn which was stinking. But they replaced the same with Chicken and egg Fried rice which was good to taste. However they charged us only for the Chicken and Egg Fried rice. Kung Pao chicken was nice.
Overall food was nice, but I must say that their service is good. Staffs are courteous enough.

As the name suggests, it's a theme based restaurant. I was surprised to see the interior decoration because from outside it will come as some random little eatery.
Coming to the menu..They have a wide variety of options printed on the menu but I am not sure how much of it is available, because two or three things we asked for was not available only at 7pm. 
I just ordered for drums of heaven and it took them around 25mins to bring it on table. 12pieces of drums of heaven, tasted kind of okay, quality was not that great either. Asked for fresh lime soda which didn't had much of soda.
They don't charge any gst as of now. There is huge prospect for development. I hope they make the most of it.

Superb.
Mindblowing.
Went on the auspicious day of Ganesh Chaturthi.
Though i was instructed by my mom to have VEG that day,i couldnt resist myself seeing such an appealing name infront of me.
Those who are using SAMSUNG mobile phones,they must know the service centre at garia.
And this hidden gem is just opposite to Samsung Service Centre.
It was a #WOW from me,when i entered the place.
Superb decoration.
Being a Harry Potter fan,i felt Nostalgic.Each and every detail in the restaurant created a magical ambience.
Now coming to food.
We didnt had the luck to get served with Indian & Tandoor dishes.
Left with the choice of Chinese,ordered Bar-b-cue chicken as starter.It was delicious.
Then ordered Kung Pao chicken and a Mixed fried rice.
The fried rice stole the show.
Oh it was great.The flavours,the authentic taste and the generous amount of quantity.
The three dishes left two apetites filled to the brim with utter satisfaction.
The staffs are just too good.They greeted us,and served us well.
Will definitely visit again and hereby i reccomend each and everyone to just visit once and take a tour from Mr.Potters empire.
Keep it up guys.

Located just near Garia More, this is the new addition to the dinning options in the area. Though from the outside you will not be able to guess much about why the name Hogwartz Den, but once inside you will surely be surprised. The decor is very nicely done, in lines with the name. It's a Harry porter themed restaurant, and they have done the maximum that is possible with the limited space they had. Well decorated starry themed ceilings, Hogwarts castle like walls and just the right amount of lighting, ¬†with good sitting arrangements, a television playing Harry porter movies and some light music being played through out. They have a small mock-tail counter. Staff is helpful, though needs a little more grooming. Food is very good though we ordered very limited dishes ie. a chicken fried rice and Thai chicken in red curry paste along with fresh lime soda. All the items were aptly prepared and suited my taste. One must visit the place as they have a very good menu, with multiple options.¬†

I will surely visit again just to try few more of the menu options and obviously because of the excellent decor.

This place opened a few weeks ago . As the name suggests its a themed restora . And the theme is based around j k rowling's Harry Potter .
Situated in garia its a little hard to spot unless you already know where it is . I had been planning to visit this place since its opening .
So i went to lunch with a friend around 3 pm .

AMBIENCE : The ambience of the place is cool and soothing. Themed according to the castle in the HP movies .it has deep blue painted ceiling with hanging candles and stuff and a ton of HP pictures on the wall .  I mostly saw tables for 4 persons , so if your going with a large group it may be a little problem , but the staff can come up with a solution i guess .

FOOD : This place offers a wide variety of food and drinks (mocktails) nothing alcoholic. The cuisine is chinese and indian both available . We ordered indian dishes which were navratna pulao , chicken reshmi buttermasala and fish tikka kebab . Now the waiter said it would take time . So after 1 hr we got served .

QUALITY : The starter fish tikka kebab was amazing . With spicy flavour and tender cooking it was totaly what you want to be served.  The chicken reshmi buttermasala was also good . But things went downhill on the navaratna pulao . It was sweet .. too much sweet . Sweet to the extent that you could feel the sugar few times while chewing . And frankly that is not what you want in your main course . While the dish was presented grandly but the presence of too much sugar along with fruits turned it into a dessert .
Please we ordered navaratna pulao , but instead we got a dessert sweeter than 'gajar ka halwa ' . 
Well its something that can be improved but to the chef i would say that please dont make the main course that much sweet . Even if its pulao , that level of sugar disables a person from eating .nobody wants every spoon to be sweet like "payesh" . Specially not in the main course.

PRICE :The prices are available in the menu card . But i consider 600 rs for two person quite average these days . The food we had was also around 600 so its not going to burn your pocket . 

Overall experience i would say the place is worth a visit. I would go again to visit this place and order chinese dishes and try them . I would definitely avoid pulao and would recommend others to do so . Since the other dishes i had was very good and nicely cooked and the fish was fresh , i have high hopes for this place .

I have ordered Garlic fish, Fish Hogwartz den Special kebab, Special noodles Mengo rain thai style and bbq chicken. All the items ware superb and the Smokey ¬†Fish special kebab is a must try in a rainy evening. May be the price is little above average but then the quantity and the quality speaks for it. I really recommend all to try it out.

Very poor management of staff. 
Staff are not well trained. 
They are busy in playing games and gathering at cash counter to enjoy their stuffs. 
Very late delivery of ordered food. 
Food is so so. 
Interior is good. 
Have to wait more than 40 mins for a chicken tengri kabab.

From outside, I assumed it to be a small place but it wonders me when you go up the stairs, how much big space they actually have managed to get. The butterbeer was pretty much soda normal, but the starters and main course were awesome. We had about 8-9 dishes over diff courses and I really appreciate the generous quantity and the spicy taste. ¬†
What the restro lacks is good publicity. Also the decoration could be improved. Little small things at cheap prices, which even my friend was feeling eager to offer herself for the upgradation :p And the music should match what harry potter stuff you show on tv, peppy numbers go against the theme.

This place is easy to locate as it saves one from the hustle of Garia Main Road. I visited the resturaunt very recently and I am quite satisfied with it's service. The staffs are very welcoming. Also, the ambience is quite catchy and nice. As the name suggests, it is a Harry Potter themed resturaunt. The food served was finger licking. I personally liked Kung Pao chicken a lot. The food served was fresh and delicious. Also the rate at which the food is offered is also quite resonable. Hence, it is a thumbs up from my side.

The decor is really nice. Starry skies above and photos of Harry, Ron, Hermione surrounding you. Food was decent. Chinese,Indian,Mongolian are available. But the day I visited nothing could be served except tandoori dishes. Anyway, the kebabs weren't bad, especially the hariyali kebab was lipsmacking. Biriyani tasted fine,with subtle fusion of spices,but not rich and exquisite in taste like the other famous biriyani hubs. Overall I liked the place,and more because of the theme! üòäüòä
But it would be really more appropriate if the background music goes with the theme (musics from Harry Potter series), and not any other peppy numbers. A theme based menu would definitely be an add on! ‚ò∫

This restaurant is really close to my house so I decided to visit this place for dinner. The name is really innovative. The ambience is quite okay with a wallpaper. A large TV keeps playing Harry Potter movies. But the ambience could have been better with the waiters wearing the robes to give a feel of it and the tables could have had some quirky cutlery for the overall look.
Now coming to the food: I had ordered Manchow soup which was utterly disgusting. The soup was really thick and spicy. I had to add a lot or vinegar to make it edible. Next we ordered for chowmein which was as good as what we make in our homes. Nothing special or tasty. Infact I would say it was below average, for the main course we ordered for garlic chicken which was below average as well. The chicken was also as simple as the one we prepare at homes.
There was nothing special or delicious about the food. They have a lot to improve and work on.
