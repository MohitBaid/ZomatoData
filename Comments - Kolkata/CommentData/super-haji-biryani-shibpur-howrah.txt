Quantity wise enough for the price.quality and tastes also good.you can get biriyani of your choice from aloo to chicken in whole evening. service is also not slow.so overall as a local biriyani shop,it justifies kindly all aspects

Very bad experience....Even can be called as the worst experience ever the restaurant have no place to sit .... The restaurant is dirty all around the price is low and also the food quality....I have tasted their food and that is just worst . It's full of extra salt and oil comes out of it and the way they fill the packets are also very unhygienic.

If you want 'sasta' Biryani, this place is a must visit. For the first time in my life, I heard 'Aloo(potato) Biryani' that too in Rs. 40 !! Anyway, taste is good. But for most of the time, rice is not properly mixed with spices. Many a times I have got rice in one side and spices under them - separate.
While you are here, try their chicken chap. 'It's good' good.
Please don't sit there and have their food - the restaurant is so small that air does not properly circulate inside - so it's hot & humid for most of the time. Try them for takeaways.
Happy eating!
