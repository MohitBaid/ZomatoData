There is no denying the fact that Panna has been ruling the Behala Trap Depot region with Panna‚Äôs Oil Mill, Panna‚Äôs Fresh N Bakes, or Panna Sweets. Decades ago, when there was hardly any fancy restaurant at Behala, Panna‚Äôs Kitchen has dominated the area. But, sadly to say, gone were the days when Panna‚Äôs Kitchen reflects good food and fine dining. With the introduction of Swiggy and Foodpanda in the last couple of years, I could hardly remember any days that I have actually went out for a fine dinner. Further the addition of major restaurant chains including Arsalan and Aminia have raised the level of competition. In the last decade, Behala has witnessed the introduction of various food joints, restaurant and cafes particularly at the James Long Sarani. After visiting the Winter Flower Show at The Agri- Horticulture Society, we headed to Panna‚Äôs Kitchen for dinner.
                                                                ...

Well we have been having panna's food since childhood. They serve good food at pocket friendly prices. Their biriyani is light and tasty. Try chicken maharaja along with naan or tandoori roti. Their rolls are very famous in this area as well. Quantity of all the dishes are quite reasonable. I enjoy being there

Very poor service...the food quality is not good at all... the manager is not willing to assist when they make wrong home delivery... how can you deliver a mutton biryani without the mutton!!! When you call them to let them know, they asked us to travel all the way to their restaurant to get the mutton pieces!! Terrible.

There once was a time, in my childhood, when visiting Panna's Kitchen felt like an outing in itself to me. The intimate seating arrangements of the cubicle sofas with dimly lit ambiance and admirable presentation made the customers have a personalized experience. Gone are those days since the expansion into a dining hall space, which doesn't remotely exude the novelty of having your own corner! Half a decade or so ago, had I reviewed this place, I'd have given it at least a 4... Times change! 

It's been a long time since I've tasted the food of this beloved restaurant. Last Monday, my brother brought takeout from this place and it was their iconic Mixed Fried Rice. It's disheartening to see the quality to have taken an embarrassing pratfall. It borders on being bland. The quantity is indeed enough for two moderately hungry bellies. The chicken pieces were soft but had minimal seasoning since no flavor of any marination was there to satisfy the taste buds and so were the shrimps which were although cooked to perfection, was lacking any distinct flavour other than the only seasoning of salt. The rice was a tad too dry. To sum up, the nostalgia of this place was absent in the flavour through and through.

P.S - Sorry about the bad quality of the pictures. My mobile cam is really bad.

This well known restuarent is situated in behala. Panna offers a good ambience. I have visited here twice. My first visit was not that special as I didnt like the food. Chatpata chicken didnt appeal to my taste buds. However on my second visit, I found this place average. Moreover I would suggest that - Go for chinese delicacies instead of mughal dishes.

Food is really good over here . This is the 2nd time I am visiting over here .
Crispy chilly babycorn was nice.
Masala kulcha was awesome and the butter on it took it to the next level.
Mix vej was not up to the mark .
Mix fried rice played a good role with chicken manchurian....
Ambience was really good and the serving time was decent too.
The main thing is that ZOMATO SHOULD CORRECT THE PRICE FOR TWO TABLE .. I THINK IT SHOULD BE 600 FOR TWO.
300 FOR TWO IS A MISS LEADING FROM ZOMATO'S PART.

Used to be regular clients of Panna's Kitchen during their initial days and till the time we had to move out of Kolkata. The food was excellent and quality and quantity was good value for money. The place was always over crowded but Satinath made us feel at home and served us early. Though it was near home but like all Kolkata restaurants never had home delivery so we had to bring home delivery by ourselves. What a sarcasm!! Anyhow over years as the clientele increased leaps and bounds they became more commercialized both in relations and taste. Still their Mutton & Chicken Biryanis taste linger in mouth as like their Chinese dishes and Moghlai preparation.

Over all it's an average restaurant for me, the food isn't as it was expected. According to the Price of the dishes the food isn't that exiting or that tasty and it's a request keep the restaurant a bit more clean and tidy. I stay in Mumbai and I've eaten food in all king of restaurants, I was here in calcutta for some work and one of my friend suggested me this place and let me tell you that the food wasn't that good nighter the quantity nor the quality. Pardon me for the language of its a bit on the harsh side but it's the bitter truth as expected to get from a review.

I have got no idea how I missed out to review this place. It is just a few mins from my place and it has been the hosting place for many get togethers for the maybe past 12years. I have literally tasted all their dishes in the menu. They serve really tasty chinese as well as Indian cuisine. The special mention would be the soups and barbeque chicken. Their kebabs and biriyani is also worth mentioning. As I have had mostly all itmes so its a bit hard to each one. So I am review the food I had on my recent visit.
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup, cream of mushroom soup, mixed fried rice, noodles, manchurian chicken , hot garlic chicken, kashmiri polau and chicken achari. All the items were delicious. The kashmiri polau was really tasty.
The decor is very simple and they have not changed it since the very start. The stafs are very polite and well behaved.

Being nearer to my house I have visited this place quite a number of times. Somehow I feel this restaurant is slightly overpriced. Last night had Murg Malai kebabs, laccha parantha, butter nun, mutton biriyani and mutton mustani. Murg Malai kebabs were on the sweeter side ,it had cheese and was perfectly made.  Coming to laccha parantha it was absolutely disastrous. When I am paying 51 bucks for a single piece of parantha I expect something good but unfortunately it was absolute waste. On the other hand butter nun was okayish. Mutton Mustani had six succulent pieces and was quite good. As they serve both mughlai and Chinese dishes I find their Chinese dishes  better.

And their daal makhani is a show stealer..their fish and mutton items i miss so badly.. Mutton so soft and succulent.. Same with their Chinese.. Noodles are soft and translucent.. And the ambience makes u relax with old classics playing gently in the background... How i miss pannas kitchen..

This place is regarded as one of the legendary restaurants of Calcutta albeit Behala is sometimes considered to be a city of its own with little or no connection whatsoever with Calcutta. To reach this place one must get off at Behala Tram Depot stoppage and search for the Vidyasagar Hospital entrance. Cards are not accepted so make sure to carry cash.
Visited this place on ashtami after some pandal hopping as we had wanted to find out why the Behala folk held this place with such high regards. One thing a huge waiting line says about any place is that the food must be good! And that was true in our case!
The place is a bit small and cramped up which can get a bit claustrophobic for some. But their food more than makes up for it. One thing to be noted is that their restaurant menu card is not on display on zomato.
We had ordered Special Mutton Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Butter Naan. This place is a pocket friendly place so one thing you wont have a problem with certainly is their pricing. The things that you look for in that ultimate plate of chicken reshmi butter masala are :
1. Succulent pieces of tender chicken well roasted
2. Buttery thick yet smooth gravy which when mixed with those chicken pieces makes your taste buds tingle
So this is a must try
The butter naan was quite well done and they were certainly generous with the butter.
The one thing we were surprised about was the quality and quantity balance maintained by the restaurant during pujos. Most restaurants cheat on these two factors during the pujos. The biryani was quite good with decent pieces of mutton and a really soft piece of potato. The pieces of mutton were not too tender but edible and this flaw can be overlooked due to the pujo rush. There were absolutely no complaints regarding the quantity. Would really want to visit this place and try their chicken reshmi butter masala yet again.

As a teenager, this was our place to dine in on almost all of the occasions. Pretty cheap prices and food was great too! But this was the scenario 6-7years earlier.
Had their chicken roll today after hearing so much about it. I didn't find it tasty! The paratha was well fried ,less oily but the chicken stuffing inside was too dry. Most of the bites resulted in having big onion and capsicum pieces in my mouth. I am really in doubt to whether dine here again or not after having their roll. I guess their quality has gotten worse.

Located at Behala Tram Depot near Vidyasagar Hospital. Everyone in Behala knows about the vast business of the Panna's. Panna's Kitchen is one of them. The ambience is good. It is good for family dine-outs. Spacious as well. Very well behaved staff. Coming to the food, I prefer their Chinese Menu than the Mughlai, whereas their Mughlai menu is also favourite of many. I have been there for 4 times and have taken home delivery for quite a few times as well. I have tried both their Chinese and Muglai items. I must say their Fried Rice is very good, it is very light and healthy. All other items are also good as well. I keep visiting or ordering food from them.

The dishes of chicken are really good,no doubt.
It also provides ample amount of food in a reasonable price.
However,
As the restaurant is at the third floor and to access the dining service of this restaurant, one has to climb up staircases of 3 floors because no lift services are provided.

The most popular multi cuisine family restaurant of behala. Have visited multiple times. It has it all that a popular basic multi cuisine joint needs.Being the most popular one it attracts lot of people specially during any holiday.The restaurant has a large sitting area,which comes as relief when the queue is too long. Menu comprises of North Indian and Chinese mostly. The Chinese food are decent in taste,so are the north indian counterparts. Biryani tastes fine. Ambience is comfortable,sometimes with a little music playing on. Tables are clean and stuffs are nice. 
If you drop in here with a big group or your family,its a decent place to dine in as there are large comfy tables.

One of the oldest Restaurant of Behala & still going good.

Food: The food in this place comprises of an wide array of Chinese and Mughlai dishes. Have visited here multiple times and had Chinese as well as Mughlai dishes. The Mughlai is somehow slightly better than the Chinese counterpart. Biriyani as well as the Kulcha and rotis are of standard quantity and quality. The Maharaja chicken and the Reshmi butter chicken are an all time favourite here. Overall the food is sufficient with standard amount of quality and quantity.

Ambience: Visited this place innumerable amount of times. The decor is nothing special but is clean and well maintained. Seating arrangements are compact and privacy isn't much available. The restaurant is located in the lane of Vidyasagar Hospital on the 2nd floor of Panna Building. 

Service: Though I know few waiters by their name and the rest by their faces, I still cannot deny that the service can improve a bit. Waiting time can be reduced and the sloppy kind of service can be made professional type. Cash and card accepted. Parking is available.                    

Overall: A perfect place for value for money. Definitely recommended for any Behala resident.

LOCATION: It's located right at the heart of Behala trum depot/ Behala Bazar. Feel free to ask any vendor nearby and you'll be guided well.
Have always ordered chinese here, and it's never been disappointing so far. All chinese chicken, fish and prawn preparations are worth a try.

Its an absolute favourite of mine.We (I,my friends,my parents) have tried almost every dish from here and except the  too sweet lemon chicken,none of them disappointed us.
The food is really great and not even too expensive.

Over time,they have curtailed down their menu,which I dislike,and sometimes certain items are unavailable.
Other than that, absolutely no complaints.

It is definitely a good restaurant.
The ambience is nice. 
Prices r moderate,not very cheap but majority of the food r delicious.
Well what i found in so many years, they cook almost every indian/tandoor dishes very very well.
They dont do justice with chinese food- the general chilli chicken is quite bland.Gravy noodles is bland as well.
So avoid chinese.
Among indian chicken recipes, my favorite is chicken reshmi butter masala. However d rest r good too.
Have their kulchas or tandoor chicken or naan-they excel in all of them.
Panna's biriyani is quite light and might not hurt the stomach and is hence a good rival to its nearby joint HAJI.
But till now, they cud not defeat haji in their rolls.
Overall the restaurant is worth a lazy afternoon for a quick yummy lunch.
No extra vat, good ambience, good food, polite staffs overall make this plcae very good
However go well before 4pm or after 6pm. The restaurant stays closed for 2 hrs.

Panna's Kitchen is not at all a new name!! Though many people have still not visited the same. You might have tasted Biriyani @ many places but according to me Panna's Biriyani is the lightest one!! Even I can say that u don't need to wash your hands with soap after having it within any spoon!! I have also tried their Chicken Bharta!! It's really delicious, though a bit oily!! But u can give it a try at least!!

A place where I used to hangout during my college days. Things have changed a lot in past ten years. They have upgraded and relocated their restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant is so-so. Obviously  much better than the earlier one. Food tastes good. Inexpensive.

Value for money. Not a fine dining category restaurant but if you want a tasty and sumptuous meal  at a reasonable cost in a decent ambience then this is your place. Pros - all taxes are included in the menu card price hence no added vat or service tax. Cons - You will have to climb some steep stairs upto the second floor, quite tedious for elderly persons.

For the first time ever, I had combined Indian oriental food with Chinese. Result was pleasant. Ordered Barbecue Chicken and Tandoori Chicken as starter. Just one word. Fabulous! It was really tasty and optimally cooked. Further, I ordered main course on Chinese cuisine. Hakka noodles was quite good (I have had better, though). I liked the fried rice more. The Tofu (please stop calling it "paneer") Manchurian was average, but the gravy helped it taste merely better. The experience was nice, except for one thing. The restaurant did not serve beverages or desserts for some reason best known to them. Overall, one foodie to another, try it out!!! üòã

Panna's Kitchen is Good family restaurant. Lots of options are available from variety of cuisine. Ambience is not so good. We had ordered chicken lollypop and chicken butter masala and naan. Food was well cooked and it was tasty. Service is good and staffs are also very friendly. It is best for middle class family to have dinner on weekend. Rates are also normal. I think price on their menu is inclusive of VAT.
So overall it is good restaurant offering multicuisine.

By the time we informed the waiter we had consumed part of it. We asked to cancel the dish the waiter denied as we consumed part of it. The facility does not even have a complain register. Food lovers must avoid!!!

But it's nt easily recognize as it's a resturant.. coz it has located in 3rd floor of a multi storied building with lots of shops.. ambience is ok.   I visited this place with my friends.. we ordered 1 special mutton biriyani, 1 mix fried rice, rajshahi chicken, chili chicken n lachha paratha . The taste of food was really very good. Specially i like chili chicken the most . Also I tasted little bit of biriyani n rajsahi chicken.. both r also good. Service was quite well. Overall it's nice experience about food.

One of the oldest chinese and indian eatery in Behala which has gone a little lacklustre with time but still a crowd favourite when it comes to pocket pinch.... a typical huge array of dishes to choose from right from rolls to kebabs to biriyani to chowmeins and gravies.... situated on the main road of DH road at the entrance for Vidyasagar hospital, the place is easy to locate but parking is a big issue.... dont expect themed ambience or polite and helpful servers as they stay extremely busy and dont care too much about customer service since the rush is there 365 days.... but its a good place to visit when you have a big group to feed within budget or are not in a mood of too much experimentation and wants to keep it simple....

This bistro has been the go-to place for most people of Behala for many years. Now that Behala is full of other high-end restaurants, this place is slowly losing its craze. It is located in Behala Tramdepot area, near the Vidyasagar Hospital, and a has two parts. The one nearer to the main road is the roll-counter and the dine-in restaurant is a few steps away from this counter. The rolls they serve are good but the Haji Saheb rolls are even better. They serve 6-7 types of rolls and I have tried the Egg Roll, Chicken Roll, Paneer Roll and Mutton Roll. All of them were very delicious with spicy stuffings. However, if you are in this area and are looking for rolls then you should prefer visiting Haji Saheb, which is only a few steps away from Panna's Kitchen.

Now coming to the dine-in restaurant, it is still one of the better places to visit for having food even after the emergence of many favoured restaurant outlets in and around this area in recent times. I don't know why Zomato has listed the menu of the roll-counter only. Panna's Kitchen is famous for its dine-in section and its menu is not listed here. Anyway, this place serves amazing Mughlai, North Indian and Chinese cuisines. I, being a localite, have visited this food joint several times. The ambience is good with dim lights and light music playing their respective parts. It is spacious and can accommodate around 50 people at a time. The service is prompt and the staff is very courteous. They have a good knowledge of all the dishes and hence, consult them before ordering an item which you aren't familiar with. I have had the Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Mixed Fried Rice, Schezwan Chicken, Thai Chicken Crispy, Butter Chicken. None of the dishes had disappointed me. The Biriyanis are good and are recommended. The Chicken items were tasty and complemented the Biriyani and the Fried Rice really well. The Thai Chicken Crispy was full of flavours and was very delicious. This item too is recommended.¬†

All in all, this is a standard food joint with decent food and service. The pocket pinch too is low as the food items are available at reasonable prices. The only matter of concern is the kitchen, where the food gets prepared. It is located just adjacent to the dine-in area and is often visible when the door is opened by the waiters to get the prepared food. The kitchen is not very clean and seems unhygienic. This should be taken care of by the people concerned as maintaining hygiene is an indispensable factor for any restaurant or food-joint.

To start with a statement - this is the finest multi-cuisine restaurant in the Behala /Taratalla area, even after the arrival of brands in the area. However, sadly this place is highly underrated. Firstly, the staff are extremely courteous and very helpful, but professional; they know how not to be intrusive. Secondly, the food is quite good. They might be termed a multi cuisine restaurant, but if you ask me, their specialty is North Indian food. Very good. For starters, they have Chef's special fish which is probably the best dish they make. Along with that, my favourite is the fresh lime soda (garnished with cherries and a slice of lemon) which I find to be of absolutely the perfect mix. The mutton is very tender and the chicken bharta is classic. I have always avoided the chinese in the menu, though. I would definitely recommend this place.

Unfortunately, the metro-rail construction work has made the place inaccessible for the past few years.

Pannas Kitchen use to be the go to restaurant for Behala'iets during the early 2000. They cater both Chinese and Indian food.
With the passage of time other franchises have opened shop and I feel Panna' s kitchen has not been able to keep pace. The d√©cor seems to be stuck in a time zone.So is large part of the menu. The Indian food that they prepare still tastes good, with a tinge of sweetness in almost all dishes.Good for the Bengali taste buds I guess.
The Chinese delicacies are a concern as well as the raw materials like fish which is bordering on just being stale.
A dish like chicken in Barbeque Sauce would taste of ketchup and no other. My last food experience at this restaurant was not a pleasarable one.Still just for the past memories and previous food experiences at this restaurant over the years my rating is Three.

This is a favorite place for biriyani and roll lovers,i have mostly opted for take-away although i have dined in here thrice,they prepare equally tasty north indian and chinese food. They're a competitor of haji saheb somehow, if you want to taste really tasty biriyani and if you're concerned about your health and digestion equally then you must visit this place(the biriyani of haji saheb tastes good too but they use too muchh dalda which I think is not much healthy and not easy to digest), I think people of behala have visited or must visit this place at least once in their lifetime.... I have been visiting this place since my childhood and it has never disappointed me

Another place of eating out for behalites from age old. Almost eaten every item. The biriyani , the food, the rolls , are just mind blowing. From a behalites u can't expect a rating below 4. It has given me a glimpse of restaurant during my school days

Standing right on D.H.Road, the very name of Panna is associated with assurance for every Behalites. I can proudly say I have tasted Biriyani from the first lot that was cooked in this restaurant, I have seen this restaurant grow, even though I am more of a take away customer for Panna's. The biriyani till date is equally delicious and so is their roll. I have not tried their chinese though, but the name assures, it wont be bad. The biriyani they serve is light and the quantity is very good. Price is normal and taste, well, superb!!

The staffs were courteous and friendly. I think, all the foodies in behala have went there. "Panna's" is one of the best restaurants in behala.

A very old eatery in behala. I am sure each and everyone know this place. It use to be a nice fine dining family restaurant. Recently I visited this place with my brother and my experience was different from the previous visits. The biryani use to be their usp. We ordered for mutton biryani and it was bad. The mutton was not well cooked and it had a strong raw meat smell. Another dish which was their signature was chicken lababdar. The quality of that dish has also degraded over the years. The only thing which was edible was the fresh lime soda. The staff members are cordial and the ambience is nice.

Recommended by one of my teachers the experience of  Panna's kitchen was very disappointing to me. We ordered mixed rice,chilli chicken and fresh lime soda. The staff served the food only when I asked him to serve. He served only once after that we ourselves served our food as no one came to help. The quality of rice was very cheap and it was over cooked. Among 12 pieces of chicken  3 pieces of chicken were a bit rotten which smelt really bad and they marinated the chicken with cinnamon powder to cover the smell. We couldn't complete our meal as we were feeling that we are going to vomit. Fresh lime soda was good. When we complaint about the chicken they handled very politely and offered that they will exchange the dish. But we refused as we didn't want to have another bite after this bad experience.

Went there with my brother for a treat. Ambience is good and the seating place is quite big. We ordered Chef's Special Prawn for starters which was suggested by the waiter and Chicken in Chili Oyster Sauce, Devils Chicken and Mixed Fried Rice. Their waiting time normal like other restaurants only. The starter was very good specially the prawns were quite big and the rice was good too specially their quantity was a lot. Oyster sauces gravy was very good even the devils chicken pieces were good but the gravy of devil's chicken wasn't that good. The surprising thing was the price. We were shocked too see the starter we ordered being priced at Rs 400 and Mixed Fried Rice at Rs 200. Could have given 4 if the price would have been less.

The best of the best in and around Behala.  Every single dish is awesome. A bit costly but who cares? When you have both quality and quantity you don't need to head anywhere else.  It also has an attached roll counter which is also very good. Though you have to wait a while for your orders but its worth the wait.  Such is the demand that you have to pre book your seats on special days!

This is arguably the best biryani in Behala. Way better than Haji or Darbar. The atmosphere is posh but surprisingly, the pricing is pretty reasonable. The North Indian is my favorite over here although I do like the Chinese too. The mutton is really great and soft, which is a rarity. I frequent this place and happy to say that it never disappoints. Its veg dishes are equally good and delicious. No doubt this is one of the Legendary restaurants in Behala

This place is located on the Diamond Harbour Road, Behala, opposite Shidheshwari Kali Temple, at the Tram Depot bus stop.

I have been going here for over ten years, ever since this place first came up. I have tried both their dine-in and take away on several occasions. They serve both Chinese and North Indian foods. I have tried a variety of items on their menu, from Mutton Biriyani to Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Gravy Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Tai Chi Chicken, Shezwuan Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Naans and many other items including Chicken Rolls. This used to be our go-to restaurant for any family occasion before Hatari and now Chowman, came up closer to our home. Ever since then I stopped ordering from them since there are other options right near where I live. I have always loved this place because of their quality of food. The quantity per plate is also more than enough for one person, for main dishes and for 2-3 people, for side dishes. All the items I have had be it North Indian or Chinese were super delicious, with Mixed Gravy Noodles being my favourite. So recently, after quite a few years I decided to try them once again and boy the quality is still the same. The Mixed Gravy Noodles@‚Çπ175 tastes just as good as that of Chowman (with only difference being that they don't serve pork) and is one of the best I have had anywhere in Kolkata. The price for most of the items are less than that of Chowman and they don't add extra taxes as item prices are inclusive of VAT also no extra charges for packing if you are bringing it home, only service tax is extra on dine-in.

All in all I would say that the quality is just as good as Chowman's minus the extra tax but on the down side they don't serve pork but have North Indian dishes on the menu list. The ambience is not anything spectacular but the service of the staffs is great. I will rate them as the second best Chinese food joint along with Chowman, bested only by Hatari, in Behala, if purely going on the basis of quality and quantity. In terms of North Indian food, I will put them on the same level as their next-door-neighbours, Haji Saheb, with Jafran, Marufaz and now Aminia, probably offering better among places in Behala.

So if you want to try out a place in Behala, that could offer you a wide array of dishes both Chinese and North Indian at a very affordable price with good enough quantity and excellent quality, remember to try out this place.

Well, there are endless things which can be said about this place. First of all, its my "childhood restaurant",staying in Behala this was one of the go to places where you can have good quality food. The name Panna has its own reputation in this area. They deals in everything from Restaurant to oil mills, spices to sweet shop and now recently they have also opened a bakery. So they have been a very dominating name for years now. The place used to serve some high quality food but its very sad to say that those days are gone. The quality and quantity has gone down while the price have increased.

Location:
Located in Diamond Harbour Road in Behala. Just near the lane which goes to Vidyasagar Hospital. Not a tough place to find though as everyone in the locality knows about the place and you can easily ask for direction.

Service:
There is a mixed review about their service. As their is a rush on weekends the service is slow and it takes a lot of time before you get your food on your table. The staffs who are working for years and seeing me from childhood knows me well and are well behaved.

Ambience:
Nothing great in this section. Nothing to impress about, just a comfortable place to have some good food. 

Food:
I have visited this place numerous times and I have seen the taste changing from excellent to very good and then to good. Its sad that I have to say something to one of my favourite restaurants. The Chinese Section was/is pretty good. They make good chinese dishes which was excellent few years back. I do not prefer the Indian Dishes here but have tasted quite a few times which was decent.
Well you can try the general dishes here:
#Mixed Fried Rice
#Chicken Noodles
#Chinese Side Dishes

You can always go for their Rolls. They make some good quality rolls still now and I prefer eating rolls from here. They have a small take away counter for Biryani and Rolls downstairs.

Last Words:
Well, it aches to give this place a 3/5 but its what this place deserves. Its high time this place should give a quality check and bring back the old form. Still this is one of the best restaurants in Behala and you can always go for this place.

The once much touted Chinese go to place in behala,has certainly seen better days. Now all you get is leathery chicken pieces and rotten boiled eggs in biriyanis . that being said, there have been moments of satisfaction when i visited the place or ordered take away.
Special mention: mixed Thai fried rice, chicken in chilli wine sauce, fish amritsari, crisply chilli mushroom, chicken tikka masala.
Of course their biriyani is non greasy so it might just make you believe that's not that bad for your heart.
Dining in is an okay experience. Never liked some of the waiting staff members. But hey, you can certainly enjoy the food.

Nice-ish food.

Comfortable decor. 

Friendly staff. 


Sadly, Panna's Kitchen isn't what it used to be.

I have been visiting this place since my childhood and although the frequency of visits have lessened, it's still one okay place in my opinion. 

Try : 
Biriyani - It's good-ish. That is, it stands nowhere in competition with the nearby outlets of Aminia and Arsalan but it's still good. A little heavy and spicy, in my opinion. 

Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala - This has been a childhood treat with many sweet memories involved and the last time I tried this, it was still pretty good. Thick, creamy, aromatic gravy with large pieces of nicely cooked chicken Reshmi Tikkas. 

Chef's special Fish - This dish is no more what it used to be. Large chunks of fish, batter fried, then tossed in with peppers in a sweet and spicy sauce with cashew nuts. The last time I tried this, I was served overcooked fish with a coating tougher than rhinoceros hide. But, the rest of it still tasted good. 

Barbecue chicken - I love this one. The sweet, sticky sauce is childishly sinful. 

Shanghai Chicken - Long strips of chicken cooked in a red, spicy gravy. 
Order this with the fried rice which is pretty good, light, fluffy, subtle.

If you aren't up for spending a lot of money but your taste buds rebel for some lip smacking spicy food, you can give this joint a try. The ambience is very nice and comforting.

I have been coming here since childhood and it is surely one the best places to eat in the Behala area. With my recent encounter, I had the first unfortunate experience - the shredded chilli chicken that we ordered had a foul taste of uncooked soy sauce in it. But I was very pleased with the fact that they took the complaint humbly and made it a point to remake the dish. Apart from this tiny hiccup, the place has otherwise been flawless which makes me return for more. Dishes to try have to be the mixed fried rice and Manchurian chicken. Chef's special prawn is another fine choice among the starters.

An average restuarent, nothing more than that. My guess is people visit this place only to taste something different one in a while when they kind of need a break from daily food. 

More often or not I have tried Indian foods rather than Chinese..... But the latter one isn't so unfavorable. 

They have two establishments, one that resides behind the express counter. Other one, you have to walk a little bit of a distance inside the side lane, but that is only open on days when there is a huge rush. 

Quality of food varies from good to worst. Sometimes, even I had to return the page served as it was not fit to eat. So rounding off - try to not experiment with your dishes, order regular stuff to fill your stomach only to shell out more money out of your pocket rather you deserved more someplace else.

An age old Indian restaurant with a mediocre ambience and excellent food quality. 
The take away and the sit-in sections are separated by a few buildings. 

## The special mutton biriani and chicken mastana are must haves. 

The sit-in section is on the third floor and there are no elevators , so those who have a problem with that should avail the take away.

A veteran when behala comes into play. The first restaurant i visited after residing in behala would be panna's kithen. They have a varied range of cuisines, out of which id chose chinese. They prepare dishes with utmost care. The ambiance is also great.
I have been here for about 20 times now and i still love their bar-b-q chicken!

Earlier, "Panna's Kitchen" was a pioneer in Behala area for serving amazingly delicious cuisines. But in course of time, the quality of food has detoriated shockingly and so has decreased the footfall, eventually.
In last few years, many new food joints have opened up in the locality and so has increased the competition. So, in a competitive market, when all other food joints are consistently working hard to maintain and upgrade their standard and quality of cuisines, this restaurant is severely lagging behind in the same.
My last couple of experience is very disappointing(as it was one of my favorite restaurant once, and I can feel the difference now).
Currently there is no difference between "Panna's Kitchen" and any other 'Tom Dick and Harry' food joints. So can't rate it more than 2.5

A good place to have some food in this locality. The biriyani is good and comes in quite a handful quantity. The chilli chicken also tastes quite nice while the tandoori rotis are a let down.
The gravy dishes of mutton are not that good to talk about, but some of the chicken ones are lovable.
Recommended for a try. The price is worth it.

@Panna's kitchen

This restaurant remains closed from 4 to 6 in the evening. I entered the restaurant around 3.20 today and the waiters as well as the manager denied food in the menu. They were full of attitude and made faces like I was not welcome. The manager even before offering me food told me that I have to leave the restaurant by 4 as they will lock the gates. Their behaviour created a very embarrassing situation in front of the other customers and I was  compelled to leave without having my lunch.

Its a nice place to dine in with family. I came here in a family get-together. We ordered barbecue chicken as starter, Mutton biriyani,chicken butter masala,Mixed fried rice, chicken maharaja and chicken Manchurian and masala cola at the end.

Barbecue chicken was okayish. 

Biriyani and friedrice were too good . Chicken butter Masala was not good . On the other hand chicken Manchurian and chicken maharaja were delicious.

Masala cola was just horrible.....even I couldn't finish it.


I will recommend everyone to try their Chinese dishes rather than north Indian dishes .

The place is currently very inconvenient to reach because of the ongoing metro work nearby. Panna's Kitchen is distributed in two parts. One for home delivery or take aways and the other is the actual restaurant. The take away counter is located on the ground floor and is easily visible but the restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of a very weird building.
The portions are very good and the taste as well as hygiene is top grade. The staff here is well versed and helpful.
The prices here are a bit too high according to the location and the food they serve. Comparatively Jai Hind Dhaba, Hazra is a far better option to consider.
Overall a nice place to be with family, but the prices are a deal-breaker.

If you are a Behala resident, then u already know this place. I like visiting this time place. The ambience of the restaurant is also good. A light music plays when you have your dinner or lunch. Perfect for family as well as friends hangouts. The quality of food is very good. Moreover I like their Biriyanis, Kebabs and the Barbeque chicken. Their food is bit light which doesn't make u uncomfortable even if u have a bit more than your capacity. The mocktails are also mouthwatering. Overall a good restaurant to dine in. Everyone who hasn't been here still now, please go. It won't disappoint you.

THERE TANDOOR,BIRYANI AND INDIAN PREPARATIONS AR GOOD AND MANY ARE EXCEPTIONAL ESPECIALLY THE TIKKA MASALA.BIRYANI IS LIGHT AND LITLLE DIFFERENTLY PREPARED THAN THE REGULAR BIRYANI JOINTS.
I PERSONALLY NEVER LIKED THEIR CHINESE FOOD ESPECIALLY FRIE RICE AND NOODLES.SATISFACTORY SERVICE AND REASONABLE PRICING APART FROM PRIME LOCATION MAKES THEM ONE OF THE POPULAR RESTAURANTS IN BEHALA.

Worst ever experience at this restaurant. Half of the things not available. Waiters behaviour was so rude and reluctant that it seems management had decided to shut down the restaurant and will pay them salary for rest of their life doing nothing. If any body want I can give that waiter' s name also. And the height was that when I asked for a glass of any soft drink one of the other waiter told that they don't sell it though the bottles were clearly visible behind their back door. Anyways I  hope u people have reached up to over saturation level and so started treating guests not as god bt as dog. And also trust me being a resident of behala I will make sure none of my friends and family will  ever visit your restaurant.

since i live around behala, so panna's kitchen is always the first choice for standard chinese food.. the ambience is quite soothing, the music and the service is satisfactory. food quality nice, not like 'super yummy delicious', but 'okay not bad'..¬†

but i would like to comment on the price of the dishes.. the price is high in comparison to the food quality and service..¬†

and here in zomato cost for 2 is written 350rs, which is incorrect. i went there last week and mixed fried rice or mixed hakka noodles was rs200 and the chinese chicken dishes are rs200. +service tax and vat. which on average makes it cost for 2 as rs 350 totally impossible!!!

It's a surprise to see that panna's kitchen got such a poor rating. I went here a lot of tyms and I was never disappointed. The biriyani is superb also there are few sides dishes like chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken maharaja, these are worth mentioning. Their barbeque chicken is just to die for. From the soup menu I had their chicken manchow soup a couple of tyms, its great. Service is prompt. They could work a bit on the decorations but the place is huge, plenty of seats so no complains. One of the most pocket-friendly restaurant in behala.

Although the menu was limited due to Durga Puja, they covered all the basic Chinese & north Indian items. We were 5 and ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Hot Garlic Chicken, Naan, Chicken Bharta and salad. All the food was delivered quite soon and tasted great. All the food items were cooked perfectly with little amount of spices and oil, hence good for the stomach. The chicken pieces were big and tender which is what I always like about Panna's Kitchen.
I visit Panna's Kitchen every year during Durga Puja & they have maintained their quality and quantity also.

Me and my friends suddenly made a plan to have some rolls at Panna which is very famous. But finally decided to have some heavy foods. Hence went to their dining area.
It is located inside a lane and the restro is situated on the 2nd floor. Which was very tiring to climb the starirs after some serious walking.
Now coming to their ambience the dining area is very big in size. The area is very quiet and the lights are also very mild.
Now coming to their dishes we ordered are Mixed Noodles Gravy, Mix Hakka Noodles@ and Chicken Chili Grilled Rice.
I personally liked the mixed noodles gravy. I didn't like the other two dishes. Some of my friends though liked those bt according to me they were not that special. But the gravy noodles was really awesome.
More over that they don't charge any extra VAT.
The servicing was also very friendly though we had to wait for a while for our dinner to be arrived.
Hence 3 * is given keeping every thing in mind...

Behala tram depot is synonymous with multifarious outlets of Panna, be it sweets or spices. The restaurant of Panna enterprise is quite popular because of its reasonable rates and quick service. Food served is tasty and of good quantity. Had been there a couple of times and it's quite spacious though there's nothing significant about the decor. Tried North Indian food there. The biriyani dishes are light and tastes ordinary. The butter chicken is nice. But the nans & kebabs are really good, especially the tangri kebab and the chicken punjabi preparation is gorgeous. Overall a good place to fill your tummy or gorge with friends on a moderate budget.

Some staffs are so rude and arrogant that you would want to get up and get out of the restaurant. No doubt that panna's kitchen is mostly empty nowadays. Bad food quality and bad mouthed waiters. Move over Panna! Coz we have the new Hataris, Hajis, Arsalans, chowman and many more awesome restaurants in town and those are way better than it!

The mutton biriyani is really less oily containg a large amount easily can be shared by 2 persons.We also ordered Chicken bori kabab which was just great.
Thee only negativity was..when we went in the afternoon,the variety of mocktails were not found..and thus we had to quench it by ordering Fresh Lime Soda.

In D.H.Road there's less good outlets but Panna's Kitchen of Behala is not only good, I think one of the best. We ordered 4 Biryani and 1 Chicken Rajdhani or something. I didn't remember. But this chicken is delicious, I did never taste a chicken like this before. And Biryani is also very good. I think whatever it is if you want a delicious lunch in a busy place like Behala then go for Panna's Kitchen.

Popular and situated in a very crowded market area in Behala, ¬†you enter this place though a staircase in a gali.
There is not much you can say about the ambiance since it is like a normal eatery where they serve you with food at cheaper rates than the more upmarket places.
Chinese food is bland but not bad. They taste normal, more like better homemade food.
Avoid the mock-tails since they are exceptionally bad.
Closed between 4 to 5, this is a place to visit if you don't have enough options and don't wish to go much far.

Just another budget friendly mediocre restaurant to be. Like any mediocre  restaurant in Kolkata , food here tastes a bit sweet as it suits the palate of locals. It is not  for people wanting to have some authentic north Indian cuisine, as this the case with most of the restaurants in Kolkata serving so called "north Indian" dishes.

Simple place with good food. Mughlai dishes are good over here. Service men are polite. Pocket friendly with normal price. Navaratna pulao is one of the famous dishes. Chicken pepper salt is my personal favourite. Over all nice place.

A good place to dine, lunch anything. The best part of this restaurant is the price of items, its cheap and in the gasp of ¬†middle class people. The food quality and quantity are both exceptional. Situated at the heart of Behala, it offers you a wide variety of north indian food. The waiters are well behaved and it offers a good place to spend time with family.

It is located opposite Sidheswari Kali mandir, very near to vidyasagar hospital. . It was during durga puja last year after a lot of pandal hopping we reached here for lunch.. had to wait for about 35mins. Ordered basic items from the menu card as we were very hungry,ordered chicken fried rice n chicken chowmin n chilli chicken n salad. The service was very quick. we didn't have to wait much .taste was good. Ambience was nice n the bill was pocket friendly.

Panna's kitchen is located right infront of vidyasagar hospital serving an easy access to people. The place is easy to locate and though from the front view it doesn't appear to be a big restaurant, when one goes to the second floor it surely catches our attention. Panna's has two restaurants but the new one is more beautiful
Dim lights, soulful music and a casual seating arrangement are the first things that catches our notice. The waiters are helpful as they make u understand each dish when asked for. The food quality is good and healthy( they use sunflower oil in their items not dalda). Taste is light and surely one wouldn' t get a stomach ache as the place is very hygenic.
I am coming to this place from nearly a decade as this was once the most expensive restaurant in behala and is still now one of the costliest places to have food. But surely one can shell some extra money for hygiene and quality.
4.5 stars for being so good and tasty. This is panna' s kitchen, one of my fav eateries in my neighbourhood.

Ambience is quite crass. Though the management has tried it's utmost best to deck up the rooftop and make an ambience worth the dining experience but the people love screaming so something's never tend to go the right way.

Food is a delight. Located at the heart of behala, easy for one to commute to the restaurant. Servers are really sweet and food is on the table before one knows it. There is a particular importance given to hygine which is a plus. The chefs special fish is a must eat. For quick pick ups the biryani is worth every penny you pay.

Overall a good dining experience. If you visit once you would want to visit again. Happy eating.

I am not a big fan of the food they serve at Panna's Kitchen. Most of the time you won't find much on the menu and on special occasions such as Durga puja, you hardly get anything. Unless you are very hungry and not willing to spend much, I would definitely suggest you to go for someplace else.

At the table and dining now so this is as fresh as it can be... 

Waiters here have extreme attitude, they decide what u shud have and decide on when you should be done with your starters...  they will pick up the quarter plates when they have the main course ready, yes thats rite, without bothering to ask you. 

Such snobs, the waiters dont even know which dish has what. Ridiculous service,  i'd give them a -5 just for that. 

The only saving grace Is The good food. Perhaps  the chefs need to look elsewhere if they want their culinary skills to be appreciated.

Visited only once there, that too for the first time and last time. The quality of food was not upto the mark. The chicken served in Chinese dishes were just thin streaks of chicken and not the normal chicken pieces one is used to have at any normal Chinese restaurants. Service was so so.. Had to wait for 1-2 hours as it was a Sunday to get a seat and the expectations gathered did not fulfil it's mark. That's why a 1*...

Being the restaurant most closest to our house, and also being light on the pocket, Panna's Kitchen is invariably the place we end up in whenever a friend gives a treat. The food is very good considering the price. The ambiance is also pretty good. The service though isn't up to the mark and could improve. Both the Mughlai dishes and the Chinese dishes are adequate in quantity and taste. If you're looking for a quick bite which won't burn a hole in your pocket, Panna's Kitchen is the place to go to.

Tasted many dishes like mixed fried rice with chilli chicken, mixed hakka noodles with schezwan chicken, then mutton biryani with chicken chap, nuns and tandoori rotis with chicken reshmi masala and many more.

Both of them were awesome but lollypop was really great crispy tossed with sauce it was delicious. Afterwards we ordered Chilly chicken n fried rice that was a flop as it was less salty and less spicy. Briyani n Chicken tandori masala were great. Had a good experience. Waiters' cracks poor joke that has to be kept in mind :P. Had a good time though thanks a friend of ours..

Panna's Kitchen located in a narrow street near Behala Tram Depot is foodie's delight. I have visited this restaurant many times and have tried close to 25-30 items on offer on their menu & therefore can vouch for the quality they offer. Biriyani, Chicken Butter Masala, Reshmi Kabab, BBQ Chicken is what I prefer to have in this place. I really like the shakes they serve with a cool little paper umbrella with it.¬†

Given the number of customers they serve the service is really quick and the waiters are really helpful. Nothing great about the ambiance. The pain point is there is no reservation system and one has to wait on the road for their turn.

Food: 4.5/5

This is a nice place, specially the extension they made on second floor ( the ground floor is too congested and stuffy).¬†¬†The food is tasty and they serve generous proportions. The ambience is good. The pan fried fish and the shredded chicken in oyster sauce are my favourites. They make quite a decent biriyani, though not the best. The greatest thing about the biriyani here is the limited amount of oil they use.¬†The staff is helpul. But the place remains quite crowded always and you need to wait before taking your parcel.

This place is very near to my house and perhaps is the only place decent enough to dine in behala thru out the last few decades. I have eaten here many times so I dont know how to review it. In one word its awesome. Any dish, anything u order is awesome. The mutton in the biriyani is so soft that u can merely scoop off the meat by the spoon. Quantity wise, quality wise they do more than justice to the price set for the items. Only drawback, being one of the few good restaurants in behala, on most days during the prime time u won't get a place here. 
Synopsis: try anything u won't be disappointed ever. Also it would never cost you more than 600 for 2 persons.

Panna's Kitchen is truly a nice restaurant serving good food. The ambiance may be not up to the mark, but their service is incredibly fast and more or less neat as well. Speaking about the food, it is quite good and there's a lot of variety to choose from. The BBQ chicken is one of my favorites,

We are regulars at Panna's since it opened shop. It was the meeting point for us during our clandestine romance period and it has seen us through our bickering married couple period ;)

Panna is a true surprise package. Very few restaurants can boast of the fact that both Chinese and Indian cuisines are equally good. Panna's biriyani and kababs used to be my favourite (Recently it has lost its place to Baharat). But the Chinese is still as mouthwatering. BBQ Chicken is a must have as the starter. Bang Bang Chicken and oyster chicken are our favourite side dishes. All types of rice and noodles preparations are good. I liked the old place with cosy sofas more than the new one. However, the food is super yumm and so we don't really mind. Thumbs up and please keep up serving us the yummy food...

A very good place...
Specially the shef special kebab was good rest of the food was a bit more than average.
But the main problem was in coordination like when we were standing in line people down stairs asked us to go up as their table was free but when we went upstairs their was utter choase customer here and there all waiting for a table and all...
More over there was no booking system.
We had to wait a long time to get a place but other than this the place it's ambience waiter every thing was good even food was served timely.

I would not be able to say much about the place or the service since I remember going there once that too as a kid. However takeaways from Panna reaches my doorstep very often! I can give 3.7 stars to this place JUST for their FOOD. Really good Chinese at a very affordable price! My favorites are their chicken fried rice, hakka noodles, schezuan chicken, garlic chicken. As far as i remember my visit, i cannot miss the lovely mocktails decorated with lil umbrellas that they offer. I am a very happy customer of Panna's kitchen since i get very good food at a very affordable price. And the location is ideal for locals as well as flying customers!

We were four people waiting at the queue number 123  outside this restaurant around 10pm. I had the plan to go arsalan or Kowloon.then skipped because of my cousin. after entering the place,I understood the reason.what a delicious biryani.the price is 130 only.
The place is small like several other south Kolkata popular restaurant. The price is adopt for  family, friend and food loving community.
Mutton maharaja tasted beautiful.
The serving tune is quick.
The staffs are okay.
The ambience is very south Kolkata like.
Don't miss their biryani combined with 2/3 pieces mutton, perfectly cooked potato and boiled egg.

Panna's Kitchen has been my place for a healthy dose of Biryani in Behala. Priced reasonably, the Biryani comes with an egg, which is like a plus. The seating is nice too, with impressive service. Another thing to try here is the Rezala. The takeaway service is offered at a different counter which keeps the service fast. I'm a regular here. But if you are here for a while, do so by at Panna's.

It is very near to my home and hence I am not sure how many times I have been to this restaurant, should be in the range of a few hundreds by now. Almost each and every waiters and manger knows my family by now. There is not a single dish on the menu which I have not tried. So here goes my take on some of the favorites.

1. You cannot beat the Tandoori chicken of this place compare it with some of the best available in Kolkata and I am sure it will be in the top 5 list. Biryani is OK sort of not the best.

2. Devil's chicken, Lemon chicken and Schezwan chicken, really goon one

3. Fish tandoor is awesome. But do not try it if you are going to have it alone, you will not be able to move to the main course.

Don't go for sizzlers / mocktails, this is not the best place to have this.¬†

Its not going to pinch your pocket, meal for 4 would cost you around 1200.

A friend introduced me to this joint, and i must say, a wholehearted 'thank you' to him. I take this opportunity to share my experience there:
-> This eatery is almost on the main D. H. Road, and so, I didn't have to spend too much time in either reaching there, or locating the place;¬†
-> food is reasonable, and i must say, the taste is 'good' (won't rate is extraordinary, but not bad either)... however, I must caution that this is not a place where you'll like to go for fine dining;¬†
-> pricing is very attractive, and it won't pinch to go there again and again :); and finally,¬†
-> a major issue with the place is that it is located on the 1st/2nd floor of a building (without a lift)... so, elderly people, or people with knee problems, should avoid going there.

The first visit was way back in the late 1990s when they had a roof top dining place in the 2nd outlet they have. I was there on my birthday. Now i have been there uncountable times. They have two outlets which are two buildings away from each other situated in the heart of Behala and is one of the best food hub in that area. 

¬†The food here is really good and not that oily and has quite a few variety available. The quality and quantity are really good. 
The waiters here are very polite and helpful and takes good care of you. The 2nd outlet is much more spacious and well decorated than the former one which is rather very small and shabby. 

I love the biriyani here as its not too oily and mainly their chinese section is a worth mention as the tastes are really good.

Pocket Pinch - 600+ tax for 2.

The biggest plus point about this place is, during Puja, when everywhere else the food quality deteriorates , Panna maintains their good taste even during Puja rush.

One of the more decent restaurants of Behala. Its located near Behala Tram Depot or at least what used to be a tram depot. There are 2 sections or rather branches of this place, located very close to each other and fortunately I have been to both of them. The one closer to the main road is more compact and the place gives you a old nostalgic feeling. Try to get a seating on the upper floor as I assure you its more peaceful. The other extension has a bit more up to date furniture and decorations. Both the places serve decent amount of food for the price and they taste normal, nothing special. There is no noticeable variety on the menu which is a let down. The servers are very friendly and cater to your needs when and if required. The biryanis are the drinks are pretty nice here. The prices are of normal standard and so pretty pocket friendly place. Hope they introduce something new to the menu soon.

Sizzlers are served with noodles ..It remain closed from 3:00pm-6:00pm.¬†If you want a family hang out table reservation will be a safe option.

I ordered takeaway from this place after two years and I must say, the quality and quantity, both have degraded.
Previously, they used to give pack the rice or Pulav in boxes, but nowadays it is given in plastic containers, which were only used for side dishes.
The takeaway order was simple: Pulav and Paneer Butter Masala. It cost me 300 bucks in exchange for a very substandard taste of food. The Pulav wasn't a Pulav. It was a mixture of multi-colored rice and veggies along with a sprinkling of cashews and raisins. And the all-pervasive smell of "meetha ator". I wonder from where they imported this version of improvised Pulav. The paneer was so-so, in fact, better than the Pulav. The quantity of the main dish was much much less than what it used to be, while the side lasted another day of breakfast, lunch as well as dinner.
Thoroughly disappointed with the quality. And yes, you can't just serve multicolored rice with veggies and call it  "Pulav", hoping to be saved by the sprinkling of cashews and raisins. It was clearly prepared for Fried Rice,as I remember from 2 years back, that they used to serve Fried Rice in a Pulav-like style. Now, I'm sure they're mixing and matching or simply did it because they weren't prepared.

This place is always busy and getting there isn't tough at all. Located on the D.H.Road, this place has got a facelift a couple of years back. The food is value for money though the quality of food is about average. Their fried rice and noodles are a bit oily as per my opinion. The side dishes are better and yes,one won't be much disappointed trying out there biryani and chicken butter masala though I feel the other nearby restaurant serves these better. Overall an average restaurant, with some highs and lows in the quality of food they serve.

I have had lunch couple of times at this place. Located on the busy D.H. Road at the heart of Behala this place reminds me of long waiting time. I remember, once on a Sunday afternoon I had to wait here for near about 45 minutes to get 4 chicken biriyanis packed! But anyways, I do like their chicken and mutton biriyanis, chicken butter masala, chicken chap, etc. I have tried their Chinese preparations as well (or rather the Indianized chinese dishes) like chicken fried rice or chilli chicken, but on any given day I would go for their Biriyanis rather than trying their Chinese. The mutton or chicken pieces in their biriyanis are always very well cooked, but the biriyanis (overall) could be made a bit less dry (though I guess many like it this way). So if you talk about eateries in Behala then Panna's Kitchen should always be on that list. Also their special chicken biriyani with two pieces of chicken, one egg and sweet potato is something amazing, the quantity in there is huge and is definitely tad too much for a single person to gulp down. Do try out their biriyanis!

Though I havn't tasted much of their dishes but I really liked their Mixed Fried Rice & Chili Chicken. Heard from many of by friends that these two are the best dishes on the menu & I can tell u I ain't disappointed after tasting it. It quite delicious but Chili Chicken could have been better. Which was a huge disappointing was their Biryani (both Chicken & Mutton). It was jst not upto the reputation. However Mutton Kosha & Chicken is good. Hoping to try their other dishes in future.

Panna is known for its biriyani from a long time now. I've been here a lot. But the last time I went there with some of my friends and the biriyani was extremely good. We each ordered a plate. We also had some chicken some other time. And the butter chicken was really good. Good place, reasonable price,a bit crowded sometimes and the waiters didn't seem that friendly in nature.

Starting from its sweet shop to the restaurant, Panna has really got the business rolling. Whoever stays in Behala has surely dined at Panna or got a take away. Their biriyani is really good and the gravy chowmein is delicious. However, I think their speciality lies in the Indian cuisine. The kebabs are very tasty and the chicken bharta has just the right amount of everything, which makes it so desirable. Also, the quantity is sufficient for two adults and the prices will go easy on your pocket.

The most appetizing dish is schezwan fried rice.....its worth the money!!! ....Shangai chicken is also mouth-watering.....but apart from this two I found the other dishes like fried rice, chiili chicken, garlic chicken, shredded chicken not as excellent as these two but its satisfying. There are few others like chowmein, chicken momo which I found totally bland.

Located at the heart of Behala (Tram Depot), Panna's Kitchen is worth a visit, specially with family & friends. It is an extremely popular restaurant. The service is good but one has to be patient post ordering to get their food. Very few restaurants can boast of serving equally good chinese and mughlai, you get it here. I love their mixed fried rice, with garlic chicken or shredded lamb. Biryani served here is great and a hot favorite amongst most Behalites, which gives close competition to Haji Saheb (a popular nearby restaurant). I would recommend Chicken Lababdar to go with the Biryani, even the Bharta is quite tasty. Avoid going during the Pujas, as you might have to wait for 2-3 hours in the queue quite easily. The place is air-conditioned, credit/debit cards accepted (would advise to check with the hotel staff if the swipe machine is working every time you visit), lacks privacy due to the seating arrangement, music playing at the background. Happy eating!

I have been visiting the place since my school days and still think its the most over hyped restro in Behala. Every time after hearing good eviews from friends and acquaintances, I thot may b I didnt try the correct dish.. Yet to discover !! Anyways

 Location is near Behala tramdepot on the road where Vidyasagar Hospital is located. Ambiance is nice nothing great. I have faced delays in service several times during peak hours. Coming to food, its nothing extraordinary. I find their kinda Chinese a little bland and higher on Garlic. Moghlai food is not impressive as wll.. U will get btr stuff in Arsalan or Haji.Few of their dishes which I used to like was Tai Chin Chicken and Barbeque Chicken. Recntly found that Tai Chin chckn has lost its crispiness and they have reduced cashewnuts in the dish. Barbeque chicken has also become sweeter..

Vinal verdict: I suggest u will get btr food at cheaper rate in Behala.

At the time of puja the place is crowded so you have to put your name first and then they call you :) .I have visited the place many times and it has some nice memories to it. We always order the chicken tikka which I felt is pretty good  follwed by Biriyani or Mixed fried rice chilli chicken and some other chinese chicken.  Last year we ordered noodles which was great. 

The place jhas nice ambience and the waiters really take a good care. i always enjoy the chinese food here along with the Biriyani.

Summary : A hidden gem in suburbia. 

Details : How often is it that a completely nondescript restaurant, tucked away in an equally nondescript lane turns out to be fabulous ? That sums up the experience of lunching at Panna, an unassuming restaurant near the Behala tram depot. On our way back from a weekend away from the city, my companion suggests  that we make a halt at Panna, with the promise that it would be worth every minute of the delay. We have some difficulty finding Panna, as the eponymous family that runs the place also own a sweet shop and an oil mill in the locality. When we reach the restaurant, housed in a featureless box-like building, this reviewer is unimpressed. The dingy stairway to the restaurant is unwelcoming. The restaurant itself is low on ambience, with dining tables arranged haphazardly in a large rectangular hall. The staff, however, are helpful and attentive, and at their suggestion, we ask for a mutton Gandhari kabab, butter naan, and a chicken tawa masala. Waiting for our order to arrive, I notice a look of satisfaction in most of the diners, and feel encouraged. The Gandhari kabab arrives soon after, not a large helping, but enough for both of us. The kabab is simply wonderful. The spice mixture is mild but warm and has a slight tang, the meat is done to melt-in-your-mouth perfection. The mains arrive soon after this satisfying entr√©e. The butter naans are large, well-fluffed and dripping with butter. The chicken tawa masala comes as large helpings of very good cuts of chicken in a smooth yellow gravy with pieces of crunchy capsicum. Like the kabab, I make no attempt to deconstruct the gravy, preferring simply to savour the taste. In combination with the buttery naan, it is excellent. Both of us tuck away in bliss. Though tempted to try the biriyani our neighbour is relishing we yield to prudence and decide to come back another day. In spite of its obscure location and poor ambience, Panna is a gem of a place to have really good Awadh khana if you find yourself in the deep south of the city.

I have been eating here ever since it was a limited seated eatery right at the corner of a bustling behala market....but the food quality never dropped....till date, i have taken so many of my friends here and they swear by this place....

though it claims to serve mughlai and chinese..everyone tends to favour the chinese more...there Gravy CHowmein is extremely comforting....The Garlic Chicken...the Lemon Chincken...Shanghai Chicken...the Crispy Chilli Babycorn....all are just yumm...

Well back when there was no Arsalan at taratala....this was the place for amazing mutton biriyani and chicken chaap....but its better to stick to the chinese array...

Prices are very decent, considering the tremendous quantity served here...
Overall, not a bad place for dine-out....espcly if you are dead-hungry and dont want to search around...

Went there with family thrice, and once with my friends and returned with a great experience every time. I've been there in June'13 last.

The place is well lit and slight background music was awesome. The staff was very cooperative. 

I'd personally suggest you to avoid biriyani. Except biriyani, all other Chinese items are well enough. 

Panna's Kitchen does not accept food coupons. It also does not offer Home Delivery. Other modern amenities are also missing here. All these are some of the negatives of this restaurant.

I'd rate Panna 4/5...

I had visited this place couple of times.There are some negative as well as positive overview from my end.They accept card if and only if your bill amount is more than 500 and doesn't receive any food coupon.Even most of the time their machine doesn't work and they ask to pay by cash.Parking facility is not available here.If restaurant get full,then you have to wait in a queue and that is also beside road. They doesn't provide home delivery and if you want to take away then you will be charged for the container also.
Quality of food is good if and only if you choose from Mughlai cuisine.Chinese dishes are not upto the mark in Panna's kitchen.Quantity is more than sufficient for one person.But service is pretty slow.
Overall this restaurant is good and you can visit there once or twice.You will not regret,just plan to keep some extra times in your hand.

i had panna's cantonese gravy noodles (mixed) today..frankly speaking i expected a better taste. the noodles whose very name suggests "gravy" lacked gravy and was pretty dry. the amount of chicken was good ans its size was well and good but prawn was too little in quantity and there was only two small pieces of brocoli in the whole dish. only carrot and onions ruled the place.. the quantity of egg was not up to the mark. i have had better noodles from panna's kitchen in the past and today the taste really disappointed me as i expected a lot more from this food joint.



----- 04 Aug, 2013 -----

panna serves excellent chinese and their cantonese white gravy chowmin is the best. love their biriyani too. their other food items r good too. but  they should improve their rolls as they are like any street rolls with no speciality. ambiance is excellent with soft music and polite staff. ideal for a romantic dinner or a family dinner. food comes at decent time and if also late the taste beats all. the kashmiri polao was little too sweet but other items r decent enough to make panna a must visit for foodies.

A friend had introduced this restaurant to me on his birthday, and the lunching experience was a great one. The ambience was good with the dim incandescent lighting arrangements. Coming to the food, I loved the Chinese dishes - the lemon chicken as well as the generous portions of fried rice and noodles. From the Indian cuisine, we tried out the mutton biryani , which was nicely cooked and its taste was quite satisfactory.
The waiters are polite (and funny). When one of them was asked which of two dishes was better, he smartly replied, "Both are better." 
Prices are reasonable. Oh, did I mention that they had gifted me a pen too?

When i first thought of reviewing eateries i visted,i was torn between Banana Leaf and Panna's Kitchen;however, the former preceded,and Panna's is next up on my list ...
well,my first dig at this place was on a friend P's birthday..and thanks to her assorted choices that i tasted the chinese platter,out here,
ever since,I swear by the Lemon Chicken,of this place because I'm quite sure that it comes straight from cloud 9 :)
The Schezwan Chicken is another celebrity,in Panna's bandwagon ethereal tasting delicacies...the chicken is just so juicy and tender,i can very well reminisce ,when it was being served,i felt like pouring the entire content of the serving bowl on my plate..I was that desperate!!!(relax i didn't do so,etiquettes,you know!!)
...Crispy Chilli Baby Corn...its something which inspired me to bring in babycorns at home,which i'd otherwise never opt for :P; nevertheless,
the starters out here are mesmerising,and ya obviously,tastebud tickling :)..
My personal favourites here are the reshmi kabab,  shammi kabab,i bet,you will never regret ordering these...oh yes,i can't help but mention..
the mutton biriyani,
i never imagined  that the meat in biriyani could be so tender that you could separate it,with your fork...
Chicken Sweet and Sour,is sweeter than it sounds,and I always smile along the entire process of assimilating it(insanity i guess!!)

the rice dishes alongwith the pulaos are also worth mentioning,especially,the Mixed fried rice...a perfect blend of seasonings...

I consider its location a major con,its difficult to locate.especially for people who are entirely new to the area...because the actual landmark that people point ou by the name PANNA,is actually the oil mill...

I guess the best part about this place is its ambience,a dreamy lightwork,,,soft karaoke playing in the backdrop...aaaah!!! its a perfect place to eat in peace...and to eat like a glatton ,because the quantity of the food served,is something which is till date a plus point..I have been here with my camaraderie,and been here with my family,and everytime,its been an unique experience altogether,amidst the peals of laughter,teasings,sharings,and pranks of friends and affectionate warmth of loved ones...

Its one of a kind feeling out here...and i do happily take up the respo to recommend it to several other food bugs,like me, Visit this place...

J'adore ce lieu parce que j'ai raison = ]

Today was my second day at Panna's Kitchen. Since i happen to be a die hard fan of Chinese cuisine, i chose some of the Chinese options that was available in the menu. The food did take some time to be served but was delicious...I never come to Behala for any reason except to meet one of my cousins here...she has in fact suggested me to this place..

Having said all good things, the one major mood bugger was the fact that this one would allow you to pay through credit card only if the amount comes to INR 500. This becomes a problem specially if you have 2 people having food..and even after having a good lunch the cost just doesn't come to 500..more than often i see their machine doesn't work...

A plan to have a delightful lunch or dinner really can be possible in PANNA'S KITCHEN. If you are a lover of fast food and delicious North Indian food, your destination should be none other than 4/N D.H Road, Behala, Kol-34. Panna's kitchen is near Behala tram depot. A short review of Panna's Kitchen shows that it accept credit cards, which will be a great help for most people who prefer transactions through credit cards. Another plus point of this restaurant is that it is just beside Diamond Harbour road, so while passing through you can easily spent some time there in their Air conditioned room and enjoy the real taste of North Indian thick tasty gravies and mouth watering delicious fast food.

But Panna's Kitchen does not accept food coupons. It does not offer Home Delivery. Other modern amenities are also missing here. All these are some of the negatives of this restaurant. If the restaurant can start accepting food coupons, then it will attract many food lovers from far and near. The unavailability of home delivery is one of the major drawbacks of this restaurant. Many people cannot go to a restaurant and eat there, and many other people don't like to sit in a restaurant and spent their precious time eating there, as it is much easier to order food on the phone. But as this facility is not available here, it is a great problem for those who want to eat packed food directly at home. It is also a loss for the restaurant as they are unable to reach lots and lots of people who want home delivery. Panna's Kitchen also does not have any car parking facility, which makes it far more inaccessible than any other big restaurant, (take for example YO FOODIES at High land park, Kolkata). Most of the top restaurants have a parking lot which proves a great help for those who have a car. Another major drawback of Panna's Kitchen is that it cannot satisfy those who are vegetarian. Panna's Kitchen does not have many vegetarian food options. In Kolkata, there are a large number of people who are  purely vegetarian and don't like non-veg  food. Panna's Kitchen proves a great failure in this field. 

There are many drawbacks of this restaurant, located at 4/N Diamond Harbour road in Behala. Avoid it unless you live close by.

Went out to dine with family around 8pm.This restaurant is located beside Panna Oil mill.The service was really good and amicable staff.Ambience was serene.We ordered chicken kasa,mixed hakka noodles,simple pulao and kashmiri pulao.At the takeaway counter,we got Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka,paneer roll,chicken biryani and Tandoori Chicken packed .
Though their non-veg stuff was scrumptious but the kashmiri pulao was a disappointment as it was too sweet and too full of fruits.But next time would definitely try and grab a rooftop or terrace table.
Worth a visit!

I tend to rate restaurants solely on the quality, price and taste of the food they serve. Location, ambiance, hospitality all come second to me. Having said that, it is not true of course when my pocket is heavy and I go for the expensive ones. 
This is one of my all time favorites. The mutton biriyani comes with a tender piece. Unlike in most restaurants the biriyani over here is very light to your stomach and yet has that aroma of saffron and whatever else.

The Chinese over here is also very delicious, but I end up having biriyani over here every time I go. Personally this restaurant to me serves the best biriyanis in Kolkata. Happy to see it in number 2 in the "brilliant biriyani" collection.

If u r searching for a restaurant for 'good' food within the perimeter of Khidirpore to Joka, then PANNA is the right place for u..
whether u r going with ur frnds or only with ur girlfriend, Panna would be a nice stop...
on normal days, its pretty empty & provides enough opportunity to have a nice chat with ur partner..
it serves north indian n chinese food, though if u want to taste chinese like Mainland China, u will obviously be dissapointed...
the ambience is pretty cool, although the waiters take some unnecessary time in delivering the order...
and above all, its very very pocket friendly....
a filling dinner for two would not cost u more than 300/-....
the food is also very good...
specially if u have tasted their Chicken Butter Masala, u will want to came again n again....

P.S- if u r going on ur first date, its quite a nice place to take ur date.. u will b able to make a nice impression without a large hole in ur pocket... :) :)

I did a review on Haji babu. This too is a budget joint. Ok same tips for new comers. Watch out for metro construction. This is what we do when we do take out. Park the vehicle inside the hospital complex :D much less hassle ...

We do take out from office. Here we do IndianChinese or should I say BengaliChinese LOL

Joints like this are cook dependent and cooks are easily tradable commodity. Some might tend to disagree but these are QSR - quick service restaurants. Few make it successful in this deal. Some persistent problems which effects the food quality - lack of perfection or standardization in back-end operation, lack of proper cold storage facility and really bad supply chain infrastructure in India. So one can never be sure of the same taste in these places. 

Panna is a local joint and the owner has built it brick by brick, customer by customer. The location is great. These type of joints has lot to do with the audience and the type of economic environment surrounding it. Considering that this is okay for locals for a hassle free take out, outsiders I don't think it's worth the adventure. 

We will do take out again, some Sunday afternoon when we go back to work at our archaic office area :) ( seriously you think I'm laughing, u gotta c the place)

If you're looking at food and food alone, then Panna's Kitchen is one of the best places to visit. There are very few restaurants in Behala that can boast of such high quality of food in terms of taste and even variety. Among their non-veg items, the Chicken Lababdar, Lemon Chicken, and Chicken Butter Masala are definitely worthy of mention. Vegetarians needn't feel left behind either as they offer excellent Sweet and Sour Veg and Veg Manchurian. Their noodles, especially the Schezwan noodles are excellent. 
If you're ok with not paying mind to the lack of ambience and slightly slow service, you will certainly not be disappointed since the food on offer is truly worth trying out!
My rating: 3.5 stars

The entrance is quite disastrous to the new building. There are lots of street dogs once you enter the building basement from where the stairs begin & the atmosphere is quite filthy as its just beside a Government Hospital & also its quite tiring to climb so many stairs before you finally reach your destination for food on the 3rd floor. The old one was much better. But once you enter the dining space, the whole ambiance changes & is quite soothing. The waiters are warm, but won`t serve you anything unless you mention that when they deliver the foods on your table. Thats a big negative in terms of how you treat a customer. And one waiter seemed so slow that it would take ages for him to serve a food, it seemed that he was strolling in a park, but that was an exception. 
Now coming to the food, I'll give my thumps up to most of the dishes. They are awesome in quality, quantity & taste. Their Mocktails are superb specially Pinacolada. All the kebabs are excellent. Ill definitely recommend the Kalmi Kebab, its just out of the world. Also other starters are superb. While coming to the main dish, you can go for Noodles, Fried Rice or Rotis & any Gravy item. I have dined there quite a number of times, but only once i found the Chicken in the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala to be a little on the harder side.
Also I do not know the exact reason as to why the food tastes much much better in the Dinner than in the Lunch. The only item that I did not like much was the Chicken Biriyani; its not at all upto the mark.
But overall its a great place to eat whether that be with family or friends or even alone when you find no other partner.
