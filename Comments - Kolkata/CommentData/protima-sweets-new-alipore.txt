Surprised to see this shop on zomato,personally speaking I feel it is one of the best sweet meat shops in Chetla area(p.s it is listed wrongly in new alipore),rather it is located at the end of the wider area of CIT market just beside Barua biryani shop.Their shorbhajas are excellent,along with their rasgullas and size&taste of the their sweets is also reasonable pricewise.A recommended shop to visit in this area.last but not the least it is one of the few shops in chetla where you can get sugar free sweets too

First of all the shop is located in Chetla and not New Alipore. The sweets are very tasty according to me... Atleast better than any other sweet shop of chetla.... The shorbhaja of this shop is so yummy, a must try..

Im a bit surprised to find out this shop in zomato. Its just an ordinary sweet shop which every para/locality has.. frstly its not located in new alipore,its at chetla (near alipore). It offers different varieties of regular sweets at reasonable price. Wenever any puja or get together s there we get rasogolla, dahi, kaju barfi from this shop.
