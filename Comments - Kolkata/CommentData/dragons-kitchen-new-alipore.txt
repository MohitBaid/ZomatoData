I ordered the the mixed noodles and hot garlic chicken through swiggy. On receiving the food, I was quite impressed by the quantity on offer.Generally these combos essentially mean you have to sacrifice on the size of the the respective portions which to my delight was not the case here. The noodles was pretty ordinary though with a generous dose of egg and chicken.
The garlic chicken had 4 pieces of orange coloured chicken in revolting looking orange water. The gravy, if you can call it that was just hot with no other flavour whatsoever. The pieces were 'chewey' and bland.

If you're just on the lookout for lots of food without tickling your wallet give Dragon's Kitchen a chance. Chances are that your taste buds won't be tickled though.
