Being a diabetic, I've pretty much given up on sweets and not a stroll beside the glass-cabinets go by without once eyeing the arrays of delicacies and regretting! Well, yesterday was an auspicious occasion and there couldn't have been any better reason to sinfully indulge.

The assortment of sweets brought had such a high demand that the pictures taken won't do it justice and sadly, I don't even know the names of half of the sweets... So, I'll refrain from that. The first bite into that luxurious rabri made me reminisce of the days when, once, my friends and I took upon a venture to try the 10 best sweet shops of Kolkata in a month(which certainly ended up being a 2month venture with about 16 shops). The sweets were rich with milk, butter and ghee and dense in texture and yet not too sweet(except one item) to impede the merriment.

I, explicitly, deny to take part in the tug of war between North Calcutta and South Calcutta, but what I'll say is this, Kamdhenu's deserved a place on my 16 shop spree rather than some where the only milk used comes from the udders of the word 'heritage'.

Those sweets know black magic. Cause the moment you enter, you get pulled in. You dont look at your wallet and just keep on pulling notes. Every sweet comes in with a distinct flavour and taste. And watch out for those rasogollas.

We were in Kolkata for a meeting and had to fly back to Mumbai the next day.
Some of our colleagues suggested to try different kinds of Sandesh Kamdhenu prepares.
So we took 4 packs of assorted Sandesh to take back home.

The flavours were really amazing and each other kind was amazing and sweetness was optimal.

We were glad that we took stuff from there as we had to gift it to few people 

I personally liked the gulab and chocolate Sandesh.

I don't exactly remember the name of all the sweets that mom got packed but from the ones I remember, there's one "gurer chomchom"- the best one, then there was the amshotto misti, langcha n god knows what else!!😂 No sweet is below 10 bucks but then all are worth the price!:)

This review is specially for the baked rosogolla from Kamdhenu. It is unlike any other baked rosogolla available in town. It is truly baked, browned and put in a milky sauce. More like baked rasomalai..anyway whatever it is...it's definitely good..juicy, not two sweet and the rosogolla are just divine.

No complaints about the delicious sweets but the staffs have big attitude issues. Once i visited to buy 5 or 6 different items in 5 quantities each. They were so reluctant to mix and match them in a box first. Then they made me wait for around 10 mins while we came before many customers the staffs attended them first. One of the items we wanted was 5 kanchagolla but one man ordered 10 of them so the staff packed all of them to the man even before he came much later . When we complained about that the staff rudely said " are ato kichu ache dekhun na ki neben?' Our bill was almost 350 but instead being insulted or insult the staff we left. The staffs gave us a gesture as if we were street dogs walked into a mall

Well I had their sweets without knowing their names but i can say that the four Sweets i had each were worth trying. Prices range from Rs.8 to Rs.35. The store is well decoratorated and very clean.

Though previously I have tried mistis from most of the well known sweet makers in the city and around, Kamdhenu's is a new one on my list. My verdict – I simply fell in love with them, and I crave for more. I tried two to three varieties and all of them were awesome in taste. I would definitely like to try more varieties of mistis and snacks as well before I can tag them as one of the best sweet makers in the city.

When one of the famous mishti brand of Jadavpur-Santoshpur area, decided to open an outlet near my neighborhood, I was oh so excited!! 

I'm a fan of their beautiful creations. The mishtis are worth dying for. 

This particular outlet is located bang on Lake Market, right beside Lake Mall. A very beautiful outlet indeed, done up with fancy lights and wall decor. 

Coming to the mishtis, one of my all time fav is their rabri. It is simply amazing. Priced at 500/kg it is divine to taste.
Next comes baked lyangcha which is price at 20/piece. Extremely tasteful.
The baked rosogollas are very good too, priced at 15/piece.

The staff is very well mannered and warm, tending to our needs very well. 

Love this place.❤

Kamdhenu's situated in a prominent location in Lake Market is very easy to spot and easily accessible. The shop is not very big but it has a good variety of sweets and savoury items. Moreover it is well maintained and kept clean. Once you enter the shop it becomes quite a difficult task to choose which mishti to have. Yes one is really spoilt for choice. Their mishtis, the ones that I had were excellent. The chena mishti was soft and fresh and not too sweet. This shop is a part of a chain of shops mostly in South Kolkata and their variety is good.The staff behaviour too was good and they try their best to serve fast in spite of the rush of customers.

Although a small outlet with a limited stock, Kamdhenu does not disappoint when it comes to quality. Visited this outlet on the day of Kali Puja in november to get some mishti doi and sandesh. The mishti doi was a fine example of how good kamdhenu is in making bengeli sweets. I have already described the taste and quality of the sandeshes in my review of the Santoshpur outlet. So will not go into that. But if you are in the area, do try out their mishti doi once.

Use Coupon Code "SFOODS" to get Rs 100 off on your Zomato online order with online payment. It's safe and reliable.

For Some Reason, my older review isn't present,so rewriting this as an update, 

This is located just at the outsides of Lake Mall and has quite a good amount of crowd. 
Services are slow, since the staff keeps on chatting among themselves(this is common in Jadavpur's kamdhenu also. 

The sweets are really good. The designs and types change every now and then, without any regularity, which is also common for all the branches of kamdhenu. Big orders requires booking 7 days in advance not 8..9..and so on.. 

They have a huge variety and newer varieties are quite common. You won't be disappointed with their quality but mind you, the prices are a bit high, but the taste makes up for it.

I have been a regular and voracious eater of Kamdhenu's sweets for the last two years when they opened their new outlet in Lake Market. The shop is located in a very convenient location and very visible from the Rashbehari Avenue. 
 
I am fond of the Chinese Roll ( Rs 20/- per piece) , the Makha Sandesh , Dry Rabri , Wet Rabri  and  Raso malai . They are all superb with controlled quantity of sugar. The baked Rosogolla and Baked Chamcham priced at Rs 15/- per piece tastes unique. One can also try with  sandesh of divergent taste at Rs 12/- a piece. What attracts me the most is the "Nikhuti " and " Sita Bhog" . These two are rarely found now and the taste here is awesome. 

The shop also keeps the snacks - Radhaballavi with Alur Dom ( earlier they used to serve the cholar dal), Paneer Chop (awesome)  and Dhokla. The Dahi ( yogurt) is superb and I take it with the Rasogolla and Kamala Bhog , the combination is lethal. The Pantua /Lady Cany is very good. 

The behaviour of the staff is cordial and the ambience and the decoration of the shop is quite good.

Located right outside Lake Mall and goes by the name of Kamdhenu Sweets Pvt. Ltd., is a well known name in South Kolkata when it comes to sweets. The place has a good collection of sweets and savories available at descent price bracket. The store is modern and well maintained unlike some very old sweet shops in Kolkata.

From last couple of months, I have started visiting them a lot. I tend to prefer them over Jugal's. The main reason has to be their savories. I love their Dhoklas, they are shaped like idli but taste very good with imli (tamarind) chutney. Also do not underestimate their collection of sweets, they taste great.

Would surely recommend this outlet for Bengali sweet lovers :)

Kamdhenu, the sweet shop is situated right at the heart of Lake market. This place has raised itself to legendary status since it first started a couple of years ago. Their sweets are just awesome. There is no other way to describe it. I have not tried a single item that I have not liked. Even their Radhaballavi is just delicious. Baked roshoholla, rabri, dried rabri, gurer chomchom, these are my favourites. 
The items are a bit overpriced I suppose and that is bit of a letdown, but it still draws quite a crowd everyday, 30 days a month. And with the decreasing standard of legendary sweet shops like 'Sen Mahashay', 'Ganguram' , it becomes that much easier to take over the market. There are no seating arrangement as is the case with most sweet shops and that sometime is quite frustrating. Other than that, This sweet shop is awesome, and I'll keep visiting.

Kamdhenu is a hidden gem in a city buzzing with sweetmeat shops at every corner. This outlet is located near Lake mall and is conveniently located if I must add that. 
Have tried the staple sweets here but the stand out is their gur mishti doi. It is sublime. Thick, not too sweet and well balanced with the gur flavour. 
Prices here are quiet decent and I honestly recommend this place if you are in the vicinity.

One of the many reasons, I despise people living in Southern Kolkata. Premier sweet shops, good restaurants, lovely malls; they seem to have it all. Kamdhenu, another legendary name when it comes to sweets has this recent outlet of theirs opened up at Lake Mall. Located at a place, where you have two other heavyweight giants in the vicinity, this has to be a bold move, and I must say they are doing pretty well to keep up to the competition.

The interiors here are neatly done. The service is fast and smooth and the people on the other side of the counter are quite well behaved. I had dropped in on one fine evening to try their Radhaballavis and Mishti Doi. I couldn't however resist my temptations from the beckoning sight of the lovely Roshogollas and ultimately fell a victim to those lovely beauties as well. Pricewise, I cannot complain. The quality is pretty good and I actually prefer Kamdhenu over the likes of Bancharam when it comes to sweets. Overall, a fine and lovely place to drop by if you are around.

Kamdhenu's came, Kamdhenu's saw, Kamdhenu's conquered. This store opened two years ago and this outlet had won everybody's heart in the Lake Market Area. Sen mohasay, Bancharam, Girish, Deshbandhi have lose the battle of desserts with Kamdhenu's. I am a frequent visiter of this place. I love both their sweet and savoury items. I love their radhapallavi, singaras, chilli paneer, baked rosogollas, kalo jam, rosogollas etc. The behaviour of the staff is praiseworthy. If you go there by 7 p.m you may not find all the items  because of the huge demand. In a nutsell, it is the  best store for sweets in this area.

Newest in the area but already number one by sell beating the likes of Bancharam, Sen Mahasay, Girish, Nalin Chandra Dey. On the eve of any festival, they run out of stock due to heavy rush.

Showstopper indeed. Situated at the ground floor outside Lake Mall-it has redefined the passion for mishti in and around rashbehari area. They have to take on the big daddies around the area like bancharam, sen mahasay and i bet they are feeling the heat. Alike other kamdhenu shop, it is neatly done inside with prompt service. To name a few of their top draw, try out their butter roll, kaju don, baikuntha bhog, dry rabri, baked rasogolla, baked chomchom, mishti doi and many many more. Pocket pinch... Haha... Cant say... Depends on your sweet desires. :)

‘Kamdhenu’s’ is quite a reputed name in the world of sweets and desserts, particularly Bengali sweets. They serve the traditional sweets with some special touch in them that gives this place the competitive edge in this era of Balaram Mullick, Banchharams, etc. One relatively newer branch of this sweetshop has been opened up at the ground floor of Lake Mall, near Lake Market. The huge array of sweets surely draws interest of every Bangali in the vicinity who is passing by this spot. This place is very close to Sen Mahasay and Banchharam, so a healthy competition is always there that is definitely good to maintain good quality and customer service of any eatery.

LOCATION - - - - - The shop is located near Lake market and before Rashbehari crossing if you are approaching from Gariahat. It is at the ground floor of Lake Mall facing the main road. Park your car by the roadside before approaching this spot, since this area in itself is pretty congested and you might not get any parking spot right in front of the shop.

AMBIANCE - - - - - The shop is quite spacious considering it is a sweet shop and it is neatly done. The interiors are quite urban and can be termed as a new-age sweet shop! I specially liked their false ceiling work and its finish. Though you will not find any sit-and-eat option but you will hardly face any issue standing there even if the place is very crowded. The place is air conditioned and ranks quite high in terms if cleanliness.

FOOD - - - - - I tried their Rosogollas and Kaju Don there. Then I carried back some other sweets as take-away, like the Cream Chom-Chom and Malai Sandwich. The Rosogolla was simply melting in the mouth and was just amazing! Must Try! So was the Kaju Don, it was such a bliss. Also then I tried the other two varieties if sweets after carrying them back home. I just loved the Malai Sandwich for that enticing age-old aroma of the sandesh which was sandwiched between two firm sheets of bit hardened Malai. It is lovely to have this as dessert after lunch or dinner. The sandesh was extremely fresh and tastes better if consumed right after purchasing from the shop and not after storing it in refrigerator. Now coming to the Cream Chom-Chom, it was extremely delicate to say the least. It had a milky finish to it and completely soaked in that sweetened milky solution, it is better to put it straight in your mouth at one go. It will melt right there in your mouth in a jiffy. The sweet is topped with pesta, kaju and jelly and looks pretty tempting. Must try! 

And just wanted to share one note - regarding longevity of a sweet, it is advisable to get that information from the sweet shop itself while purchasing that sweet.

PRICE - - - - - The place is much more reasonably priced when compared to Balaram Mullick or Banchharams. You will easily find amazing sweets at INR 12/- or 15/- which is quite a feat these days when prices (of sweets) have gone up just like anything. So if you want to have some really good traditional Bengali sweets (with some modern day touch) at very reasonable price, then Kamdhenu’s is your place to be.

SERVICE - - - - - There were total 5 (five) people serving the customers that day, so it is expected that there will be almost no waiting time at the counter, but that was not the case in reality, that’s because everyone was not equally skilled or they were not working at the same pace like others. But overall due to presence of few efficient employees there, customers were served quite promptly and in-sequence. Average waiting time was also pretty reasonable and acceptable. The people/servers were overall courteous and were patient to listen to the orders and while interacting with the customers. 

SUMMARY - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.7/5
Food quality: 4.2/5
Food presentation: 3.9/5
Value for money: 4.2/5
Ambiance: 3.7/5
Service: 3.6/5

Overall, I will recommend this place for availability of huge variety of sweets which have been innovated and evolved though ages and prepared to perfection. Also the place scores high in terms of hygiene and cleanliness and moreover the sweets are correctly priced. Hence, a thumbs up from my end and hopefully you will also like their sweets and spread the word, if you already haven’t!

The dark horse.....

In a space dominated by Balaram Mullick,Gupta Brothers,Banchharam and others Kamdhenu is quietly increasing the number of stores and introducing a range of sweets which combine traditional fried sweets like chomchom with wet Sandesh coating,they are giving serious competition to the others.

I will just list one awesome sweet I bought,the name of which I do not know,whose picture I'm sharing and is perhaps the best piece of sweet I've had lately.

I had 4 at one go incidentally........

Another outlet of Kamdhenu located near Lake Market area. One day at dinner table my mom gave me 2 new sweets which i didn't had before. When i asked her, she said she has bought them from Kamdhenu's lake market outlet. The taste of those two sweets were just awesome and i liked them so much, that the very next day i went there to check and found that those two sweets are called "Kaju Don" and "Butter Roll". I had 2 pieces of each while standing at the shop and also packed for home. There are also other different sweets as well which are also good to taste but my personal suggestion to all would be "Kaju Don" and "Butter Roll" from kamdhenu. Now a days, when ever I went near by Lake Market area, i don't forget to drop in at their shop and have my favourite. "Kaju Don" and "Butter Roll".

Kamdhenu's is one of the recently opened sweet shops selling new age sweets along with the age old trafitional ones but with a twist. In an age where everything has to be updated , kamdhenu has tried and has been successsful in keeping their sweets with the changing time. Rosogolla has become baked rosogolla and rabri has become dry rabri. Not one of my most favourites but yes surely one of my favourites among the sweet shops.

Location -- at lake mall , lake market. Outside .. On the left side of the main gate.

Ambience -- like all other kamdhenu shop , neat and clean and organised. Stacked with sweets . But one thing i found wierd , the box they provide with sweets was of their bagha jatin' s branch. Rest is okay with hygenic and tasty and colourful sweets.

Sweets -- sweets from kamdhenu are always new-age. They though retain the old flavours still have a twist to it. Some sweets may taste similar to traditional ones but their name and looks give them a new touch. I love their baked rasogolla and baked chomchom. Dry rabri is good but somehow too sweet.

Overall, quite a good place to try and have sweets . Recommended if u want to go beyond the age old bengali sweets.

kamdhenu has earned quite a reputation for its sweets and this branch is one of the newer editions to the kamdhenu fraternity..located on the ground floor of lake mall it offers decent variety of sweets may be not as big as the baghajatin or santoshpur one still....prices are a touch high one may say ,to maintain the quality

Best Mishti Doi I have had in a long long time. Their vegetable chops and rosogollas are also really good. Never disappointed me! I am so glad it opened a branch in Lake Market.

The baked malakiri and dry rabri are one of the few favourites. Misthi doi is also very deliciously good. The dahi vada served are also simple in taste.

The best sweets store of Kolkata is now in Lake Market! From ambiance to decoration, from the sweets to their staffs this shop from Kamdhenu's is perfect from every angle. Though they have some stores across Kolkata this sweet shop stands apart and excels in every aspect.The sweets they offer are authentic. Though my personal favourites are many but some of them are Gulabjamun, baked items, misti doi, laddoo. Hope they will continue and expand their excellent services in the city.

The best mishti doi I've had ever! Wonderfully tempered with great texture & consistency. Absolutely Orgasmic! The sweets are fantastic as well. The baked stuffs are worth a try. A pocket-friendly and extremely good sweet shop.

This is considerably a newly opened joint of the acclaimed sweet shop "Kamdhenu's". Located in lake market, adjacent to Lake mall entrance. Due to its prime location, this is the joint of "kamdhenu" which is frequently visited by me the most.
Be it any time of the day, this joint says cluttered with people in such a way that it becomes an uphill battle to locate the sweets of your choice in the showcase and place your order.
But the sheer quality and anuthentic taste that comes with the creations of "Kamdhenu's" makes all such hassles worth it.
They offer the similar variety of sweets and snacks which is also offered in their other branches like the ones in jadavpur(baghajatin) and all.
Just a single look to the never ending list of  marvelous and succumbing sweets like- BADSHA-BHOG, KAJU-DON, KHEERPULI SANDESH, BUTTER ROLL, CHINESE ROLL, BOIKUNTHA BHOG, MILK TOTA, BAKED CHAMCHAM, DRY RABRI, CREAM CHAMCHAM, PARADISE, BABU SANDESH, SHARBHAJA, LADDU, CHENA BARFI, MALAI SANDWICH, MILKOSE, MAKHA SANDESH, KACHA GOLLA, RAS MALAI etc; eliminates all the stress keeps your sorrows at bay. 
Taking a bite into their wonderous and tempting sweet creation completely rejuvinates you from inside.
The staffs operating in this joint are very much efficient and handles enormous amount of crowd with complete dedication. They are very helpful and helps us to make the best choices. 
Although most of their products gets sold off by late evening but even if some of it doesn't gets cleared off in time; the staffs automatically discards them and advices us not to go for them.
Hence, overall a quality sweet shop in the heart of city of joy, which compliments the sweet eating fiesta of the bengalis efficiently.
