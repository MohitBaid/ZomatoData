Awesome food, even though the delivery took an hour the wait was worth it. Food was awesome total value for money. Ordered the super cheese burst margherita and choco hazel ut mousse. All was very good. Keep up the good work. New place and it was probably their first day so won't blame them for the late delivery but deduction half a star.
