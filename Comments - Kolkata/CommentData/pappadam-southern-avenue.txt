Small cosy restaurant serving south Indian delicacy at reasonable prices. We tried SQUID KALI MIRCH as starter. It was nice and crispy with kali mirch tadka..a very new concept.., a must try in this place. Next, we tried MUTTON PLATTER which consisted of Mutton stew and Appam. The Mutton stew was subtle in taste and it's combination with appam was excellent. Quantity was sufficient for two persons. All these in 500 bucks. Service was very polite. Totally value for money. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

A Goan and coastal cuisine restaurant at the heart of Kolkata and churning out such amazing dishes is worth a visit. By the same owners of “The Biriyani Company”, Pappadam is all set to please your taste buds with its coastal flavors. I started off with Pappadam and Butter Milk, it tastes so good that one glass was not enough for me! The other starters that I tried was Chicken 65 and Squid Kali Mirch. The chicken was good as usual, but I cannot go ahead without talking about the Squid Kali Mirch. So fresh and tasty, one can feel the black pepper as well as the soft and crunchy squid on each bite. It is a must have.

The main course consisted of Paneer Koliwada, Lemon rice and Goan Fish Curry (Pomfret). I am a fish lover, hence I thoroughly enjoyed the rice with the fish curry! Ohh there was paneer as well, it tasted good but the fish curry was better!! (This is a biased opinion by the way!!) 

Then comes the show stopper, Kerala dry mutton paired with freshly prepared appams. It was accompanied by chicken chettinad, but the mutton was pure bliss. The mix of the spices was done optimally and the meat was soft and the appam made a heavenly combination. Must have!!

I tried the Halwa, it had the right amount of sweetness with a nice texture. The presentation and taste was perfect.

A restaurant serving Coastal Cuisine in Kolkata is not rare but it is not very common either. 
Pappadam, from the house of TBC churns out Goan and coastal cuisine. We went with minimal expectations only to be assured that the food is excellent. It is fresh, and not rich. It is not defined by its spiciness quotient, and very easy to digest.

And, they were right! 
We were in for a complete treat. We began with the good old chaach, Chicken 65 and squid pepper and salt. It blew us away completely! the squid was crunchy, not soggy, very fresh. Each bite was a lot of squid and a nice peppery taste. 
This was followed by the Paneer Koliwada and lemon rice. The lemon rice will surprise you in a good way. 
The kerala dry mutton with the appam is my favorite pair ever! The chicken chettinad is also recommended but nothing like the soft mutton. 

And for desserts, good old halwa it was!

A small and sweet place located in an alley near Mudiali Club. It serves coastal dishes especially from south India.
I ordered their Kerala Dry Roast chicken which was nicely spiced with tender chicken pieces.
Neer Dosa melts in your mouth and their malabar paratha is a dry and crispy version of the lachha paratha which went nicely with the chicken,

I ended the meal with theie kesari halwa...superb in one word, it had kajus and raisins inside and it is on the sweeter side.

Their staffs are nice and friendly as well.

Brilliant food.... Called for the pepper squid and mutton platter.... The squid was perfectly cooked (which is very rare as most places overcook them) and spiked with lots of whole peppers and bell peppers... Outstanding after adding a dash of lemon... The mutton stew in the platter was just beautiful... Subtle and mildly sweet and you could actually taste the mutton's umami in the liquid.... Just amazing (although the mutton could have been a little more tender).... The platter also had appam which was very well done as well... Service was great too....Seriously people get over your fried rice, chilli chicken and biryani for a change and give the other beautiful flavors of our country a shot... Trust me, they won't disappoint (not out here at least).

Being a typical South Indian, I had this sudden cravings for Malabar Parotta. We chose to go to this place to satiate my hunger.

The place ornately depicts the Kerala culture. The cuisine is a typical malabari one with traces of Andhra, Tamil Nadu and Goan.

ORDER: We placed order for Malabar Parotta, mutton vindaloo, Goan fish curry, rice and rasam.

The Goan fish curry is a must try for anyone that loves to have coconut in their meal- this was a delicacy to the taste buds. Dear Mutton lovers- the Vindaloo is a blast of flavours. The tomato rasam was the perfect finish. I brought home some so I could relish it in dinner too.
We left the hotel with full tummies and big smiles on our face. Wonders a perfect meal can do!

The place had only 5 tables 2(2 seaters), 2(4 sweaters) and 1(7 seater) with one man serving, he was a pleasant chap but his availability was constrained, for smthn as simple as refilling water, we had to wait till he pops his head from the kitchen door. 

Value for money: 4/5
Taste of food: 4/5

Service: 3/5

So a restaurant featuring coastal cuisine in the city of joy , Pappadam scored quite high terms of food and just about average for the rest of it on my first and only visit .
It was a weekday early evening couple of months back , we opened its door to find a small dimly lit room (looked like a garadge space utilized) with absorbing pinkish walls and even darker curtains , some wall hangings and decorating antiques, seatings not matching anything around the room tending to make the ambience quite dull and gloomy. An old window air conditioner was put on which somehow managed to cool down the temperature. No music , no vibes and we being the sole diners found it quite boring. I felt there was a extension to  another, a proper room inside , but when enquired the waiter refused to let us go there.

On the contrary the food was absolutely stunning. Though they took a good amount of time to serve , but each dish was worth ordering.
We started with SQUID KALI MIRCH , soft and perfectly fried buttery squids mixed with bellpeppers , chillies and onions ,faint hearted should beware of the peppery heat.
KERALA CHICKEN DRY ROAST had soft chunks of chicken tossed in a red gravy with rich blend of spices 
The  MUTTON PLATTER included Kerala Mutton Stew and Neer Dosa with pickle and pappad, the MUTTON STEW  was an aromatic simple curry of incredibly soft mutton falling off the bone , potatoes onions and curry leaves in a coconut milk based gravy , tasted subtle yet delicious as i paired it with APPAM , a heavenly match to be precise. The NEER DOSA is a thin lacy crepe made of rice batter and i was enthralled to try it out for the first time. The entire platter was value for money.
Probably a better ambience would have fetched more marks , but if nearby and craving for some delightful coastal food on budget , Pappadam is quite a good place to try out .

Ordered in food so cannot comment on the ambience.they were very very late in delivery.also they were rude.when i enquired on phone how much longer it would take to prepare,they were non comittal and had the audacity to reply,cant say,might take  15 mins or one hour.only when threatened with a cancellation of order,did they quicken their pace.

Coming to food,the squid with black pepper was good,though the squids were a bit chewy.mutton stew was extremely sweet and hence we did not like it at all.the neer dosa was sticky and stuck to the alluminium foil in which it was clumsily wrapped.

Not recommended

Visited this place twice and got food delivered a couple of times as well. The place has a homely feel with a vibrant South Indian decor. Regarding the food the veg stew, mutton stew were both tasty and less spicy options. The star of the menu was definitely the squid kali mirch. The fish rava fry is also an item worth trying. Their  combo meals are a good value of money and come with papad, salad and dry red chilies.

A very decent ,Well decorated homely and pocket friendly restaurent. Neer dosa, appam, mutton strew, kroggi crab, ghee roasted crab are their signature dish. I am a seafood lover I mostly order the crab. I love the ghee roasted crab and the food quality is also very good. But you must try the ghee roasted crab.

For a girl who left a part of her soul behind in Bombay, the lack of coastal dining options in Kolkata was often a pet peeve.  What are you craving these days people would ask? Neer Dosa and gassi from Gajalee I'd say. So of course when I see on neer dosa on another will remain unnamed-restaurant-menu I wasted no time in ordering it online. Only to be told that they didn't have neer dosa that day. The replacement  they offered was woefully inadequate and forgettable.

But this is a problem with us diehard romantics and foodies. We are always prepared to get our hearts broken while on the quest for that perfect meal. 

So when I see Pappadam's review on a popular food ordering app,  I had steeled myself to be disappointed. But I wasn't my neer dosa and andhra chicken curry were exactly what I was craving. Despite the 50 minute it traveled the dosa remained soft and moist.  Excited at my triumph I pass on the good news to fellow friend and foodie and we order it again at home. This time the chicken curry and gassi were not quite as great. 

But intrepid foodie that I am I wanted to give Pappadam one more chance to let me love its food. This time we drove there (this despite a hungry husband (HH) who had spent hours in a department store lugging products and would, after a five month gap, like a taste of Biryani). 

So we arrived following Zomato directions and are a little disconcerted to find the place empty, the ac switched off.  The ac is switched on the second I enter of course and that minor occurrence (on  a weekday evening in a new restaurant so it's absolutely understandable) remains the only teeny weeny blip on on our dining experience.

we walk  in to a cheery small room ,  with south silks for curtains and a homey vibe.  

we are ready to order from the word go as we had already planned all that we wanted to it on the drive to the restaurant. For starters we order Rawa Fried Bekti, Squid Kali Mirch an Kerala dry mutton.  Rawa Fried bekti was well seasoned (and super quick!) though a little on the thin side (but only if you want to nitpick). The squid kali mirch was crisp, and not at all chewy (often a tough task with squid i have found) . I cant claim to know its origins but the bell peppers and generous dose of crushed black pepper made for a nice crunch. So what if i cant identify it with a particular state or area. 

I wasnt quite through with the squid when the best part of the appetisers arrived - Kerala Dry Mutton and chaas. Ooh man, what is it about this subtle spicy, mustard and curry patta combination with soft juicy masala coated mutton. HH, were he the swooning kind of man, would have swooned. "This is so much better than Biryani," he says.  Too happy eating, I dont even bother to day I told you so.

Next up Neer Dosa and Andhra chicken curry. They had definitely take an note of my long winded feedback i figured. Because this time it was perfect. Spicy and fiery and so perfect with soft neer dosa that you could soak up the gravy with, we were left asking for more.  B  the time we were through with the appetisers we had already decided on  having the Meen Moilee. Creamy, smooth meen moilee with soft fluffy appams provide the perfect foil our previous order, the coconut milk gravy's inherent sweetness provided the perfect foil to the fiery curry.

Even their chaas which can be too watery or too spicy in places, was well balanced and smooth. 

This was meal we wanted our palates to remember.  So dessert was out of the question. What a lovely meal! 

And we were so hungry, and the service so quick that we didn't even think to photograph out food.

We visited this place to have our dinner on a Saturday night, We located this place easily , thanks to GPS..
When we entered into this joint, it was empty but, this joint has a vibrant feelings due to its colorful decor inside..
Now coming to food, We had Squid Kali Mirch , Mutton Stew Platter and Prawn Gassi Platter accompanied with Appam and Neer Dosa .. Actually we opted for Idiyappam .. but according to the steward, they don't make Idiyappam nowadays. We both were disheartened not to have Idiyappam.. Then we opted for Appam and Neer Dosa.. 
Squid Kali Mirch was really good in terms of taste, we really liked as they put a little bit extra pepper. At the beginning, they served one plate of Pappadam with Raita.. It was good as well.. Mutton Stew was good in terms of quality and quantity, they put potato pieces in the stew but, in the  authentic South Indian Mutton Stew, they do not put potato, it was rather a bengali version of Mutton Stew.. nevertheless, we liked the taste. We did not find Prawn Gassi very attractive because smell of the spice was very high and we did not like that.. Later, at the end, I opted to have one buttermilk, and it was good  .. 
At the end of the day, I will say we had a decent dinner..

Found this newly opened restaurant at zomato. My craving for sea food and curiosity for other coastal dishes brought me here. 
It's a newly opened restaurant, as I was told it was opened November last year. 
Interior is neat and nice. Clever touch of south India in the decor can be felt immediately after entering. 
Coming to the food part, there are various mouthwatering combos. Ordered chicken platter and prawn platter. 
Neer dosa and appam both are brilliant. Specially neer dosa. Chicken chettinad and prawn gassi were very tasty too. 
Price is very reasonable and behaviour of the staff is worth mentioning.

Lake market Area sometimes known as the mini madras of Kolkata, has grown beyond the Tam Bram offerings of Idlis, Vadas, Dosas

After Laxmi Vilas disappeared more than a decade and a half ago until Tamarind move closer to Rash Behari from Paddapukur the seeker of Kerala fish curry had to go to SIR - that imaginatively titled ‘South Indian Restaurant’ -  at Park Circus.

Happily, this is now history, within a radius of a kilometer and a half we have four coastal non-vegetarian curries from the south (in addition to the rest of the Coast). Pappadam is the latest addition.

The intrepid Doctor who runs the Biryani Company has ventured into this space along a genuine south Indian cook.

The restaurant at Mudiali has positioned its offerings somewhere in between Amminis and Coastal Machan. Its priced a shade less and the menu larger than Amminis but less than both Tamarind and Coastal Machan. Nice cozy place the food authentic. The footfalls seem limited as of now but the taste should bring the people in. The service which is good as of now will need more hands to cope. Go for it. And go beyond coastal to Lamb and Chicken. You won’t regret it

It's an overwhelming experience to visit Pappadam-Coastal Cuisine restaurant, on the recommendation of a friend. The food quality is amazing and the ambience is at par. The Malabari Paratha and Mutton Vindaloo should be given a try as they are very much delectable. The Shrimp Kali Mirch is also a tasty starter, different from conventional ones. 
The filter coffee is just ordinary one. Pocket pinch is on a lower side. Service is appreciable. 

Overall, highly recommended.

Went for a small family dinner just to taste some Aapam. Pappadam has a lovely decor with a calm ambience. The staff were very helpful in choosing the right dishes. We loved the Mutton Stew and Aapam on a platter. We started with a plate of Chicken65 and that really set the ball rolling. At about Rs 1000 it was much more than our money's worth. We are indeed lucky to have chanced upon a place like this and hope to go back again soon! A great experience!

After we visited we were served papaddam and fried chilli. Papaddam was crispy and the fried chilli tastes salty. We had it with butter milk. Butter milk was really tasty. As a starter we ordered shrimp kali Mitch, it was served hot and the shrimps were fresh and the preparation was nicely done. I haven't tried this type of food before. From main we took Malabar mutton curry and neer dosa. In one plate there are 4 neer dosas. We had neer dosa with Malabar mutton curry. This idea is completely new to me...as we always have dosa in some different way. The mutton curry has a strong taste of coconut milk, sambar spices but it goes pretty fine with neer dosa. In dessert we ordered halwa, which comes as 2 rhombus in a single plate...the halwa was hot, smells if good ghee and light in sweet, which I really appreciate. All over the ambience was good, service is also good. Hope I visit there again.

This is one of the gems that Zomato helped us find. It is tucked away in my not too frequently visited area. But surely I will be frequenting this place more often.

Loved the ambiance and the decor. It was homely and had a feel of a cafe in Pondicherry.

They served us the with some pappadam and unbelievably delicious fried stuffed chilies on the house. 

We ordered Squid Kali Mirch and Butter Milk as starter. And Pork Vindaloo with Steamed Rice.

The squid dish was simply awesome. Lightly sauteed with onion, yellow and red bell-peppers with the right amount of fresh cracked peppers. The buttermilk was thick, creamy and spicy. The pork was soft and melt in the mouth in a mildly vinegar tasting curry. It was rich without being too spicy.

I loved other things on the menu and would love to go there again.

Last but not the least, the service was fantastic. It was cordial and homely. Attentive yet not too intrusive.

We started with Pappadam and Butter Milk (👌), followed by Chicken 65 (👍), Squid Kali Mirch (👌) , Malabar Paratha (👍), Chicken Chettinad (👍) and ended with Halwa (as complementary).
The most noticeable thing is, prices are within ones budget. 😀

Went there tomorrow, we weren't keen on eating anything heavy. Just went for some evening snacks. We suddenly spotted this piece, because of its beautiful board hanging at the top.

The place was spacious, and the decor is amazing and with a home like ambience. Its a South Inidan theme-based restaurant. At the time when we were there the place was all empty. We were the only one.

Ordered 'South Indian Filter Coffee' and 'Chicken 65'. Well, the Coffee was good,refreshing, bit different from all the coffee i had till now. I didn't find the chicken item that good, expected a lot better.

But yea on my next visit, i would love to try out their other items as well. :)

Dropped in looking at the bright vibrant board.  The place was so warm and full of positive  energies.  Bright,  vibrant decor just brought  a smile to my face. The lovely purple curtains,  the brass lamps and the really colorful  place mats and wall arts, truly capture the essence of southern India.  

The service staff are warm and very friendly.  The service  was also very prompt.  

We began with Squid  Kali  Mirch  which was minimal  in prepping but the cracked  pepper just made it perfect.  

For mains we had the Andhra  chicken curry platter with aapam  and the Goan fish curry with neer  dosa.  Both the combo  meals were good in portions and both gravies were very different  from each  other.  The fish was a milk aromatic gravy while the Andhra chicken was tangy and robust.  

We also ordered the lovely kerela dry mutton.  The meat was really soft and tender and the balance of flavors  was mind blowing.  

They served dried Curd chilies  with the food and they were stunning.  

The meal ended with a yummy rawa kesari / halwa which was perfectly  balanced.  That the level of sweetness was just perfect.  

I'd love to come back again soon.  

Kudos!

This is one of the gems that Zomato helped us find. It is tucked away in my not too frequently visited area. But surely I will be frequenting this place more often.

Loved the ambiance and the decor. It was homely and had a feel of a cafe in Pondicherry.

They served us the with some pappadam and unbelievably delicious fried stuffed chilies on the house. 

We ordered Squid Kali Mirch and Butter Milk as starter. And Pork Vindaloo with Steamed Rice.

The squid dish was simply awesome. Lightly sauteed with onion, yellow and red bell-peppers with the right amount of fresh cracked peppers. The buttermilk was thick, creamy and spicy. The pork was soft and melt in the mouth in a mildly vinegar tasting curry. It was rich without being too spicy.

I loved other things on the menu and would love to go there again.

Last but not the least, the service was fantastic. It was cordial and homely. Attentive yet not too intrusive.

A good place to taste costal cuisine for the food lovers. The ambiance is good and the service was nice.
We started with Pappadam and Butter Milk (👌), followed by Chicken 65 (👍), Squid Kali Mirch (👌) , Malabar Paratha (👍), Chicken Chettinad (👍) and ended with Halwa (as complementary).
The most noticeable thing is, prices are within ones budget. 😀

Redefining Coastal Food – The Culinary Brilliance at Pappadam..!

Shattering the old cliché about Costal Food, Pappadam comes to the food scene of Kolkata with much expectations and pleasantries. Located very close to Mudiali Club, Pappadam aims to bring in much freshness and a well-deserved change from the regular cuisine scene predominant in this city. Run by a season veteran and an entrepreneur, the interior of this restaurant is very simple but has just the riht décor to make you feel homely. Adored with some regional statues and paintings, this is one restaurant which is much devoid from the hustle and bustle and would give you the homely feeling. The team of #panchphoron was very recently called upon for a food tasting session, and following were the dishes/items presented to us.
                                                                ...

Pappadam is a cozy and stylish new restaurant located on SR Das road near Mudiali Club. The 30 seater restaurant is tastefully decorated with vibrant colours and and warm lighting. The food is South Indian Coastal. It samples a broad range of dishes ranging from Goa, Coorg, Chettinad, Andhra, Konkani and Malabari. This type of cuisine is not that common in Kolkata and I don't think I have been to another restaurant quite like this in this city. We tried the squid Kali Mirch and Chicken Chettinad for starters. The squid was clearly fresh and perfectly cooked, so that it was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The chicken was soft and succulent covered in spices which sing on your palate, but never overpowering. For mains we tried the appam and mutton stew, Goan Fish curry, Lemon Rice and Goan Beans. Each dish was unique with distinct flavour profile. As expected, spices are centre stage on most dishes but they are exquisitely well balanced. You can pick up on familiar notes of spices and herbs in each dish, but they do not overpower the dish or the palate. The appam and mutton stew is the kind of dish you could happily eat almost every day of your life. The light fluffy hoppers combine perfectly with the mellow delicately flavoured stew, and provides a great contrast to the bold flavours of dishes like the Goan Fish Curry. Complemented with a steaming hot cup of rassam and ending on an innovative desert which combines appams with the Bengali favourite nolen gur, this was an almost perfect meal. The service is excellent, with attentive staff and the prices extremely reasonable. Highly Recommended.

I had visited pappadam in a couple of occasions.....
Hailing from the coastal areas of Maharashtra and karnataka I really wanted to see coastal food coming up in Calcutta..... After disappointment with Santa's Fantasea....I expected a lot from pappadam.
But the same result! The xacuti  lacked the flavours of the roasted spices. Gassi didn't have the earthy flavour of the mangalorean curry it tastes like any usual curry with curry leaves.
Their appams are made with dosa batter with little sugar.....Which is just a shortcut....And no fermentation with yeast and it lacks the fluff and tanginess because it tastes like any other dosa from a ready-made batter.
The crab ghee roast was just crab in a chaanp gravy.....It had keora essence in it !! No Bedgi chilly paste ! That was a thoroughly dissapointing.
The rava fish fry came with two long fillets.....I basically ate the rava pieces more as the fillet was so thin it just broke in pieces inside. They should consider giving a thicker piece or a smaller piece.
Prawns koliwada were good.
So all in all its yet to reach there . The food taste is fine but authenticity is nowhere!
And lastly please give customers the bill in pappadams name and not in biryani company's and charge vat on that .

What a delightful little place!The decor is really nice and the food is surprisingly good. It's great on your wallet too. The menu covers more or less the entire coastal cuisine.  Food also doesn't have a lot of oil. Can't comment on the service but as we were the only ones there, we were looked after well!

If you like seafood in Goan masala then this is the place to be in Kolkata. They serve great sea food specifically Coorgi Roast crab and Goan pomfret fish curry is best. Though I personally not a great lover of sea food but liked these items. There platter's were also good

​Coastal cuisine is steadily making its way into Kolkata’s food map. The newest addition is Pappadam, from the owners of The Biryani Company. Located near Mudiali Club, this restaurant, with a homely ambience, serves amazing stuff. I visited this place on an invitation for a food tasting event. Let’s get into details.

Ask anyone who doesn’t live in the coastal area about the food available along the coastline of almost 8000 km, and you will hear some common words: curry leaves, coconuts, vegetarian, etc. According to the misconception of most, non-veg food is non-existent in coastal areas. At best, a rare few people will come up with Bombay duck or Pork Vindaloo. Thankfully, to rid the minds of Kolkata’s foodies from ideas, Pappadam is here! If you’re one of the people who have little or no idea about the wide range of cuisines and delicacies from near the coast of India, then the Indian coastal menu at Pappadam in Kolkata will completely change your mind.

Being a food lover i love to try out new restaurants always . So when i heard about the coastal cuisines in Pappadam i HAD to go and give it a try.  And i wasn't disappointed at all. its a small joint but the colours and the decor gives a warm cosy feel and reminds u of the south. For starters we took the Squid Kali Mirch , which really set the mood with its spicy flavour. For the mains we tried  the Coorgi Roast Crab and the Prawn GassI. The crab ,pretty awesomely cooked, was soft , spicy and the smell of ghee just added to its awesomeness. The prawn had a semi thick gravy and u could taste the different masalas used in it. Overall had nothing to complain on my 1st visit and would love to come again to try the rest of the menu. And  its definitely on the recommended list !

Living in Southern Avenue, I must admit that the discovery of the restaurant was by accident, due to a wrong turn. Be that as it may, we were intrigued with its proximity to the Biriyani Company (which is owned by the same couple). Deciding to give it a try, we went in expecting not very much. But it was to change and how! We tried the Prawn platter, with appams and neer dosa for accompaniment. The prawn was luscious, creamy and spicy. The appam had tender centres and crisp papery edges. We also ordered for the Squid Pepper Fry. Which was heavenly, minus the telltale fishiness.The platter came with fried pappadams (hence the name, perhaps? :P), salad and a fried and salted chilli. Props for this chilli. The pocket pinch was negligent, with a perfect bill of about 690 for two. That it accepts cards, is a plus of course. Will go there again and do highly recommend this place to fellow connoisseurs of coastal food that is authentic and lip-smacking.

On a nippy Winter evening, we had the privilege of going for food tasting to this one month old Restaurant that serves some amazing and interesting Coastal Cuisine. The name itself has such a catchy ring to it; Pappadam means "Papad", just if you were wondering. It's a quaint little place that has such a comfy feel to it. With some quirky colours and paintings and the Kanjeevaram Saree turned into some lovely Curtains, this place is super-welcoming and beautiful. We met the lovely Owners, Mr & Mrs Banerjee, who clearly are ardent food lovers! The lovely food tasting meet started with some lip-smacking entrees. Rawa Bhetki Fry was heavenly! We Calcuttans are used to the usual bread-crumb fried Fish Fry but the Rawa (Sooji) coating was a welcome change. The Fish was fresh as ever and we were told that Mr.Banerjee himself hand-picks the best fish in the market for his restaurant. The Fish Fry had a slight Ajwain flavour and was so mildly fried, keeping the juices intact. A star, this one! :) 
Next we tried the Squid Kali Mirch, another start entree. The Squid was fried to perfection and was tossed in the onion, capsicum and black pepper. Yum yum yum!🙌🏽 We are not very huge fans of the Chicken 65 that we've tried in most of the places in Kolkata, but the one in Pappadam had such an authentic taste! We totally loved the Chicken 65 (Hyderabad special) with a crunchy exterior and juicy interior, full of flavours and not one flavour over-powered the taste of chicken. Full marks! 
The main course was laid out after and just looking at them had us salivating even more! We love Neer Dosa and were so happy to know they serve them! Neer Dosa is an extremely light pan-cake made with ground rice and coconut milk and has a slight sweet taste to it. We had that with some amazing, succulent, melt-in-the-mouth Mutton! The Coorgi Crab made with Garlic deserves a standing ovation. Such minimal masala but still bursting with flavours! The Andhra Chicken again was so delicious, with a slight tang to it, also, went so well with our Neer Dosa. The Tomato Rice and Lemon Rice were superb! We could smell desi ghee in the Tomato Rice and the roasted Peanuts in the rice went so well with the entire dish. We love Lemon Rice and we love it even more when the fried Urad Dal chunks are incorporated! Lots of eating joints do-away with the Urad Dal in their Lemon Rice. It gives it such a nice crunch! Must-try, again. :D The Prawn Gassi (from Karnataka) was tangy and fresh and best had with steamed rice. 
By the end of our meal, we could'nt move, not even our eyes (okay, exaggerating), that indicated that we've eaten too well and our tummy were more than satisfied. 
All you lovers of Coastal food and even the ones that are yet to try Coastal food, this is THE place for you to go, right now. From Maharashtra to Kerala, they cover food from all parts and even more, making each of them taste as authentic.🙌🏽 We cannot wait to go back for some more... okay, a LOT more. :D
