At first glance you probably won't even notice the place. It's tucked away in a corner. One evening, decided to give it a try and was really disappointed. The staff are least interested and they served flavoured ice to me on a thermacol plate. Imagine the horror I went through while eating it. Apparently that's how they've always been serving it. Please avoid.
