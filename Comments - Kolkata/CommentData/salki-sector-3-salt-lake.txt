This is a local fast food kinda shop so don't expect much from it. The mughlai paratha & chicken pakoras are decent. Considering the price I even like their fish fry. The noodles are okayish. They also serve the typical bengali fish or chicken curry and stuff but mainly it's good for a little fast food take away.

Actually, the location is weird. But food, not bad. You'd like it if you're hungry and looking for a pocket friendly okayish meal, specially dinner.

Not bad, not bad really. Very pocket friendly but the quality is only okayish. I have only tried snacks from here but they do offer many dishes.

Gets the job done. The Alu dum is nice. Everything on the sweeter side, which i have no qualms about.

Looks like a hotel type Bengali restaurant. I wanna try it out. I love restaurants meant for the blue collar workers.
