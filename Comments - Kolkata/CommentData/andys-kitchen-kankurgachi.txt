Too much chilly. I had a dry chicken item and chilly chicken gravy. Wow. Too much and I repeat, too much chilly. Goes great with a few drinks but not while you are sober. Not ordering again. My stomach still hurts.

If you really look into hygiene,don't ever go to this place to buy food,but make sure you home deliver it, because the place is really dirty but their food tastes awesome.It is dirt cheap.The chicken pakoras are very yummy.8 pieces of juicy boneless chicken wrapped in a really spicy batter full of green chillies and onions just at 100 bucks.Another speaciality is the Special soup.Onion,peppers, chicken,prawn,egg, mushrooms this will seem more like a gravy because its really thick and very soothingly tasty.Both this dishes together go very well and are a must try from this place.
