Live worms in Chilli sauce - horrible place.

We were taken there as a part of Kolkata day tour of WBTC on 28th March 2017. No other resturants or eating places nearby (as it generally happens with Tour operators - they take you to places where you are forced to eat at a place of their choice). When we reached there, it had no other patrons. 

We ordered Chinese. The dishes were brought after around 10 mins. but without accompanying sauces (Chilli, Vinegar & Soya). When asked for, the sauces were brought but to our horror we found the Chilli Sauce literally had white worms in it.

When we complained, the chilli sauce was replaced, but not even an apology from either the staff or the manager.

Food too was very ordinary and not worth the price.

Avoid totally if you have a choice.

Went there for a lunch around 2 months ago. The resto was empty still I had to wait nearly 10 minutes before they ask me for water and then another 10 minutes for the water. Then I did not wait for their hospitality anymore and proactively ordered for chicken biriyani. After 30 minutes they served me something that can not be called biriyani. Then came the bill part. It was 140 in the menu card and I did not find single reason to give them a tip but they added 10 rupees to the bill as tax. Such a pathetic restaurant it is. My advice will be don't go for their polished outlook, rather have street food if you are hungry.

Begin to write with Mumbai boy and just happened to stay at hotel heaven for 1 day...so am totally aware of bengali taste buds...but anyways...here goes my review...we ordered lunch at the hotel room which was finally served but with lot of delay...we asked for heaven spl. Chelo kabab but it was unavailable...even the veg thali was not available...being narrowed down to choices and time we finally ordered murg hydrabadi, panner tikka masala and parathas as well as reshmi kababs...food was warm and freshly prepared...taste was nothing short of excellent...kababs were nt quite wat I had ij mind...bt d taste and freshness of chicken more than made up for it...veggies and curry was just right spicy and oily...even the parathas were soft and yummy...totally loved the food...quantity was quite good considering the price...wud love to dine at this place again if in kolkata...

Restaurant 62 situated just opposite to my office Bamboo Villa, A.J.C. Bose Road. They provide Chinese and Indian meals so everyone can eat exactly what they crave. We ate at Restaurant 62 this afternoon and it was nice, as usual. We started with the ‘Chicken Clear Soup’ which taste average. Then I had ‘Chicken 62’ as starter along with ‘Sprite’. For main course my friend tried ‘Chicken Manchurian’ and ‘Korean Fried Rice’. I went for ‘Garlic Chicken’ & ‘Chili Garlic Noodles’. I just love their Garlic Chicken though my dining companion found the Chicken Manchurian a little fishy for his taste. The food was average but flavourful, I think original spices should made them more delicious. For desserts we had the ‘Darsan’ with honey and vanilla ice cream ... amazing! Service was bit sloppy! If you're looking for Asian cuisine, near ripon street crossing go there.
