Ordered the combo via Zomato. One shawarma wrap, one piece of grilled chicken, and a portion of salad. The shawarma wrap had a teeny tiny amount of chicken and mayo inside. It was too dry to eat. The saving grace was the pita bread which was fluffy and soft. The salad was again too dry with too little dressing. And the grilled chicken was a chunk of boiled chicken. No seasoning at all. And none of the food items tasted like Lebanese food at all. They felt like something you'd eat when you have upset stomach. When I think Lebanese, I think that Mediterranean spice palate, slow grilled chicken and parsley. What I got was nothing like that. Disappointed.

yesterday evening, i have visited this place for lebanese roll , the quality of the bread of the roll was so poor and it can be assumed that they clearing there old bread stock by serving such kind of cheap breads to prepare the lebanese roll. stinky smell was coming from the bread ...overall a big NO NO to visit again !

Visited this place quite a few times with my friends. Being a Lebanese fan we were actually craving for it since long. After tuition we headed to Lake Mall and almost rushed like hungry labs after our Shawarma salad was prepared. I love the bread and the humus which has mayonnaise, chicken, veggies and yeah olives. It's one of my favorite things. The taste was great. But the bread was cold and hard. But we managed. It was overall a good experience.

They serve the very best kind of Grilled Chicken with blood all over the chicken. Also, serving mixed noodles with hair in it. 
A must mention is the staff's commendable (Read:Horrible) behaviour when they are pointed out with their mistake. 
And also, they charge you for the blood stained food that you don't eat. 
Onek heck of an experience we had here during Durga Pujo.

I regret not clicking the picture of the Grilled chicken we were served with blood garnished.

I had ordered a plate of chicken singapore noodles, chicken hakka noodles and a chicken shawarma wrap. The pita bread was not fresh, the chicken was too dry also having found a couple of burnt chunks. If you compare it with Go Lebanese nearby, its pretty average. Coming to the Noodles, I have no idea why a lebanese joint needs to prepare chinese. Nonetheless, the prices were cheap and I ordered. Singapore Noodles had many ingredients but was bland. Haka was pretty horrible. In short, even though the prices are very competitive, its not worth it. 
p.s- menu's old. I ordered via swiggy where the new one is present.

Small place located in Deshapriya Park right beside Zeeshan Deshapriya Park and Dosa@Twist. Easy on the pocket and serving tasty food this place is frequented by college goers. The Shawarma Salad is something i swear by here and it is a must try item here. The chicken salad is mixed with veggies in tartar sauce and served with pita bread and tahini paste. The chicken is very well roasted and tastes amazing. Plus the quantity is pretty decent. 
The Shawarma Roll is decent enough but nothing too special about it owing to its size. But nevertheless a nice place to visit when a change of flavour is required from time to time. Do try it out. No complaints regarding the taste.

Visited it thousand times but dropping in the review now. Tucked in just beside Zeeshan near deshapriya park this joint have a limited menu for your tastebuds. Ratings solely given based on the taste it offers. Go order anything from the lebanese menu with your eyes closed I'm sure you will not be disappointed, but sometimes some items are not available. Need to work alot on service & ambience. Shawarma wrap & salad are recommended.
P.S.: They have chinese menu too.

No complaints on food, as it's always good, and I order from them time and again.
However the delivery person came today was horrible, he carried 4 dishes of Shawarma salad (aluminum foil box) inside his normal backpack, and all the boxes were smashed at the time he delivered. When we asked about it, he blamed the restaurant for bad packaging and went off.

I had ordered 1 Chinese non veg combo @ just Rs99 (after 15%) discount from Royal Lebanese.
Pros:
-plus point is no delivery charges is added.
-quantity  was good for a single person. 

Cons:
 - The order was some what delayed by 20-25 minutes. 
-I had ordered the Chinese non veg combo which consists of veg rice+veg chow+chilli fish & chicken BUT I JUST GOT RICE & CHICKEN. NO CHOW AND FISH WAS THERE.(Though the quantity of rice was good and 4pc small chicken were there... as mentioned in the pros).
-The delivery boy was also a little unfriendly.

The only good thing about the place is Shawarma roll. We got too bad service from the staffs there,ac was not working at all,was it only for show then? The arabi biriyani is not anything different from simple chicken biriyani. Overall it was not at all a nice experience. Improvement is needed in everything. Quantity is worth its money, so the quality should also be.

I‚Äôve only had Chicken Shawarma from here; it tasted similar to what is available at most such eateries. I wouldn‚Äôt put it as the best, since that distinction (according to my opinion) is reserved for the Shawarma from Ar-han Thai :) However, their service is prompt; moreover the location near the Deshapriya Park junction makes it an easy choice for those in South Kolkata.

So I suggested her this place as none of us had tried it earlier. We ordered for their shawarma combo on swiggy. Delivery was quick. The combo had one shawarma roll, one shawarma salad and one piece of grilled chicken. The salad was okay. It missed the tangy element. Loved the roll and the chicken though. The portion size of this combo was decent enough to serve one.

Ordered from this restaurant via Zomato.
I asked for the Chicken Arabi Biryani - which had one piece of chicken. It was almost similar to the Kolkata Biryani sans the piece of potato which accompanies it.
I also had the Grilled Chicken which had a really nice taste to it.
The lack of any gravy Lebanese items in the Zomato home delivery menu was a real let down though. The meal felt really dry with biryani, grilled chicken and pita bread.
Would recommend the addition of atleast a couple of gravy dishes in the menu.

Only order if willing to compromise on almost everything for reasonable tasting shawarma. I've ordered my last when the ordered food arrived 45 mins late & half the food was upturned into the plastic packet it arrived in. Zomato does not take responsibility for packaging so.. it is entirely your problem if the ordered items are simply mashed together & dumped in a packet & delivered to you.

I called for it via Swiggy and it has to be worst Lebanese experience ever. Firstly, the pita bread was not fresh. And it was extremely thick and rubbery. The paneer shawarma was bland to the last bite. The paneer was not even marinated like it is in other Lebanese restaurants.just raw pieces of paneer added to the mix.The grilled chicken was dripping of oil and undercooked. And the chicken salad had no pita bread. All the dishes were barely edible. It was complete waste of money.

The restaurant is a take away counter , with the signature rotisserie revolving in front of the counter , making the chicken look oh-so-delicious . The shawarma rolls here are a popular pick , and is made with a soft pita bread base , filled with oodles of taratur sauce that is sure to stain your dress if you're not careful ! The Shawarma Roll here is a filling option for hungry souls on the move , and is served pretty quick . Overall , a nice place for the lovers of Lebanese cuisine  .

It was pretty close to 1.30pm which falls under the lunch timings so, you obviously expect that they will be up and active by then. 
They have a special menu as combos, but you will be disappointed to hear that it will take time either due to the cook being late or just that it's not their main focus. When on a budget, its better to get a non veg combo for Rs 100 rather than a Shawarma roll. But I had no choice. -1 for this.

*Food*
Shawarma roll was quite filling, good at taste, thick and juicy,  but their special sauce was slightly sweet, I told them to make it spicy. Rs 100 for this is a hype but unfortunately this is one of the lowest prices. 

Won't say, its not value for money.

Both the items were made to perfection and tasted awesome. This joint also has simple but clean seating arrangements. Moreover, it cost us Rs. 240 including taxes. We could not ask for more and were purely satisfied.

Royal Lebanese is located at Desapriya Park, Kolkata. This eatery is specialised in serving Lebanese Cuisine.

Ambience is nice with prompt service and friendly staffs.

Tried Shawarma wrap and special Biriyani. Both are just awesome, healthy and totally enjoyable. A must try.

Pocket pinch is reasonable too.

In general a good Lebanese food joint. The chicken and the Roti they used in Swabarma Wrap is really of good quality. 
A take away joint. Nice and prompt service to cope with the crowd

Don't know about it's other outlets (or if it has any?), but this one has taken the preparation of Shawarma very lightly. Tasted mediocre, lacked authenticity. The roll bread was too small and could have been gulped in a go. It appeared that they should put in some extra effort in almost all aspects to keep up to its "Royal" title.

Recently renovated and besides the mouth watering shawarma, they have brought in a lot of chinese dishes. The place looks great. And in every aspect fulfills the criterias for a small restaurant. The quantity is enough for 2. The service though is on slower side. 
P.S. They don't charge taxes of any kind.

Located on Sarat Bose Road near Deshapriya park(moving from Gariahat towards Rashbehari, turn left), I went there for shawarma wrap. I didn't know earlier they served other cuisines too. The place was totally empty that evening and the service was fast. The chicken shawarma wraps costing 100 bucks each were okayish. I have had better. The coriander chutney they served the wrap with was a delight for the taste buds. Due to some mechanical failure, they weren't accepting cards. Overall, not a bad place for snacking.

Best can be described as a Drive Inn roadside restaurant, the food is average in quality, price is normal. But having food during summer evening would be very difficult as there is not proper sitting arrangement and the heat from the kitchen do come on to the road.
¬†Iranian Sish Kebab was just horrible, quality of food was not up to the mark, pieces of chicken were very fibrous and not fresh also there was nothing Iranian about it.

Royal Lebanese as the name suggested here we can get Lebanese dishes. One of the popular restaurant in deshopriya park locality. I had been there many a time's. Recently the resto have been renovated beautifully. The ambience is nice and soothing. Coming straight to the point since we are foodies! The complimenting dish of this restaurant is the "Shawarma Roll" mouth watering dish with lots of flavour. The key ingredients are pita bread with roasted chicken stuffed with fresh vegetable's & lots of liquid mayonnaise. With every bite you can experience the burst of mayonnaise filling your mouth...It's too good! The dish is only Rs 100.
You can try the other dishes too. The price is reasonable.
But you must try "Shawarma Roll" once in this resto,if you are a fan of mayonnaise.
I hope you will like it :)

I have been one of the regular customers since when they started their outlet in desopriyo park. This has been in the priority list for a long time. But sadly the quality isn't up to the mark in the present day scenario. Once even I had the experience to have kind of smelly Shawarma, n they didn't agree to that and refused to accept their fault. Since that time I have never visited this place though. I do hope they are now providing better quality food that what they used to serve during my last visit . ‚ò∫

It is very good that zomato is providing lebanese foods at doorstep ¬†but for two times I have experienced impolite ¬†behaviour from your executives. The distance of my home from your outlet is nearly 4.3km. It is also mentioned that "minimum order is 99" still two of your executives were irritated to deliver the food because of the distance. If your executives are so much annoyed to deliver up to this distance then it should be clearly mentionedin the website ¬†that "within this ____ km home delivery available". ¬†Definately will think about ordering food via Zomato from this outlet. Thanking You.

We both ordered their combo menu as the food contents were intriguing,the food looked great but as soon as the first bite went it we doubted about the freshness of the food,gradually after trying their other items on the combo box we were 100% sure the food was not FRESH. Especially the chicken,was more than 2 weeks old,the inner meat was black-brown in color and it was dry which by no effort fell off its bone. It made me vomit after an hour and my sister as well.

Frankly, used to go there only for the Shawarmas and that quality too has deteriorated. I usually love the grilled chicken in these middle-eastern joints, but their grilled is way too dry and slightly bland. Haven't been there in a long time especially since the competition for this kind of cuisine is quite furious in the city now.

These are the usual items on which the business mostly runs, and it is better that you order these instead of trying something new when visiting this place.

I used to be a big fan of this place. Spent my college days eating here after classes. Recently I order a chicken shawarma salad online through zomato.
The delivery was ahead of time but the food was absolutely revolting.
The salad lacked  tahini sauce which was barely present and was completely devoid of taste. The pita bread however was good.
Majorly disappointed!
It's a shame that they have deteriorated their standards.

It was my first taste of Lebanese cuisine but I can't say it was very good. The place was not hard to find. It is located on the road connecting Southern Avenue and Deshapriya Park just beside Zeeshan and Dosa@Twist. The outward appearance was not that appealing nor was the inside.We went there today(6.10.2016) at around 4pm and was asked to come back an hour later. When we went there 1.5 hrs later, we got seated immediately and by the time we got around to eat, thankfully the place cleared and we were the only ones there. The place was small but air-conditioned. Not more than 8-10tables were there. The problem with the menu was that all the Lebanese dishes were not displayed there though they served. So, we had to order without consulting the menu. We ordered Chicken Shwarma Salad, Chicken Shwarma Roll and Chicken Arbi Biriyani. The service was quick. One thing I didn't like was that the dishes were served in paper plates and water in plastic glasses. They really need to change that. Coming to the food, I thought the taste of both the Shwarma Salad and Roll was nice enough. There were sufficient chunks of chicken in them. The chicken pieces were bit hard though. Even the bread served with the salad tasted like it was not even baked. The Arbi Biriyani tasted like any other normal Biriyani. Nothing Arbi about it. The chicken pieces smelt weird. Overall the place did not actually serve good food to us. But to our starving stomach, they tasted like heaven and we could ignore all the not so likeable things about this place.
P.S. Don't use their washroom. It's GROSS to say the least.
P.P.S.They don't charge tax. But they ask for tips.

Frankly, I dig Lebanese food. So I'll never let go of an opportunity to dig into shawarma's.
Today evening, I suddenly started craving for shawarma's and that is when Zomato food delivery came to my rescue!

I quickly ordered 2 shawarma rolls (obviously chicken) from the closest Lebanese outlet, which is Royal Lebanese. 

The shawarma's tasted really good, oozing with the sour cream and mayo. And filled with chunks of well cooked chicken. 
Something I would like to mention - with every bite, my mouth was filled with chicken. So these people really do justice to the "chicken" shawarma roll. 

Overall an amazing tummy filling experience that too, at such low prices. 
Loved it! 

Pocket pinch - 200! 
Hah! We still have such cheap places in Kolkata. Such a delight to a perpetually broke person like me.

But i settled for the shawarma roll. Food wasbgood though the very outlook of the outlet was unimpressive. The sitting area was cosy but the approach needs to be revamped.

I wont even give a 1. Sheer misbehaviour and ignorance. When i ordered online a discount was applied and the amount came to 102. Nut when it got delivered the bill was of the original 120 ruppees. I have ordered a million times from zomato and from various places. This has never occured. This was my first time orderibg from here. When i called them up the staff didnt even know that such discounts were applied on their food and asked me to contact zomato instead. Whereas it is them who are associated. On top of that their was misbehaviour and no acceptance of the mistake. 18 bucks is not the complain. But this ignorance and poor customer interaction is. Hopefully it would be looked into.

This place made me fall head over heels in love with Lebanese food. Located in Deshapriya Park, close to Lake Mall, this place serves amazing Lebanese dishes at very reasonable rates. I have tried their Shawarma Salad served with Pita bread and it was absolutely amazing. The only backdrop of the place is the lack of space and poor seating arrangement. As a result, people mostly go for take-away. If improved in this section, this place is sure to attract a lot of customers and earn a lot more points.

Honestly speaking, I've no clue why this restaurant is so underrated. It has been a day since my latest visit to this eatery but this was also the first time I opted to dine in rather than grabbing a quick byte from the delivery counter.

The seating arrangement is surprisingly beautiful. I liked it a lot. I was not expecting such a specious dine in area. 
Personally, I loved the food. We ordered a number of dishes and I liked each one of them except for one, the chelo kebab. It was lacking flavors. 
The customer service was quite good and the staff seemed real friendly. Warm greetings, good food, pretty dine in area,  that huge menu ( that just goes on and on), and good service - it's everything you would want from a restaurant. I could not find flaws that would result in such low customer ratings.
The thing that impressed me the most came with the bill, or rather in it. They don't charge any VAT or service charge!!! I mean how many restaurants do that nowadays?? 
I am really impressed with the restaurant, even more so than I was before. I'll surely visit again and would recommend everyone to do the same. If I had to find any flaws it would be like finding a needle out of a hay stash. I think they should cut down on there menu considerably as it is too huge fr their own good. 
This restaurant is everything a restaurant should be and is very easy on the pocket. Students out there, This one is a must.
Cheers :)

Have been there couple of hours ago.. A small restaurant with average interior decor.. We ordered grilled chicken full (8 pcs), chicken chello kabab,shawarma salad and chicken momo.. Grilled chicken was quite salt-less.. It should be little bit more spicy (from my perception) .. Chicken chello kabab was good with normal rice.. Nothing spcl in it.. Shawarma salad was really tasty i liked that with pita bread...bread not so hard.. Which was good.... And lastly chicken momo tastes awsome and soup too.. Their service and management quite good.. And the most important part is, its a pocket friendly food hub... We were surprised to see the bill because they did not charge the tax....Good food hub for student like us.... Over all this place did not disappoint me at all... i would love to visit there again...

While Royal Lebanese has a lot to offer, it is the shawarmas and the salads that have people returning for more. I consider myself in the same category.  The soft pita breads are topped generously with shredded chicken and diced onions, peppers and tomatoes, and smeared with a  satisfactory layer of mayonnaise. 
All in all decent shawarmas, but there is a lot of work that needs to be put into the rest of the menu.

Shawarma is one of those food items which is in the trending list nowadays. Its one of the most loved food items for sure. As a lebanese food lover and specially shawarma I try many places. In this competitive market being distinctive and winning customer's heart is really difficult. 
Royal Lebanese is located in Deshapriya Park, just beside Zeeshan.
As the name suggests it serves lebanese cuisine.
The place is very small with a sitting capacity of 8-10 people.
The quality of food is decent and the taste was nice.
I had a Chicken Shawarma Salad which was nice. The chicken could have been little soft though.
The service was pretty good and my order came quite fast. The staffs were well behaved.
Pocket pinch was reasonable.

Overall a decent place to have shawarmas.

3.5/5

Located near Desapriya Park, Shwarmas are what these guys are mostly known for. Soft grilled chicken covered in a bed of mayonnaise and wrapped in a pita bread. Sumptuous, filling and tasty; a single serving can fill up your stomach. The service was pretty fast as well.

A very small place but good food.
The chicken Shawarma is a must try. ¬†Pita bread filled with delicious mouth watering creamy chicken and served with some Pudina Dhania Chatni. ¬†Taste is really good and satisfying. It is very filling and one roll will surely be sufficient for many.
The Shawarma salad is also very good and great to taste.
The quantity is quite filling.

It was a Thursday evening and me and my cousin Tanwyee Ray , a fellow food blogger, was dying to catch up after a long time. We decided on a place close by her home and she suggested this place, she has been here before. On Sarat Bose road, one has to go to the opposite of Deshapriya park and down towards Ravindra Sarovar lake.
Royal lebanese, the name gave me a feel that it will be bigger place with inviting decoration. But in both front it was disappointing. In a busy time and someone not acquainted with the area might miss this food joint. Its ordinary appeal may be missed by someone who is looking for some random hangout over food.
They have a takeaway counter and small seating arrangement passed that. Appearance of Royal lebanese is where they lost out. They had a small seating arrangement upstairs which has been moved down.

We went inside and it was limited seating. Seatings are decent but nothing to talk about. Bright light and mono-coloured walls with no d√©cor. 

Service was decent, with few tables to wait upon only one person was managing every table with a bit of help. Staffs were polite. Downside was that they mixed our order of cold drinks but it was not a big issue.
Food was superb. They had many other times on their menu, however, we decided to stick with lebanese, as it is their speciality. We decided to just have a short bite so we ordered chicken grilled and shawarma salad. Shawarma salad was excellent, it had chopped vegetables and little chopped pieces of chicken in it all mixed in a thick gravy, and it  was served with pitta bread. 
 Next was grilled chicken, which medium size pieces. We ordered a half plate and was served with six pieces. Chicken was cooked right as it was soft. It was not at all spicy. It felt more liked home cooked chicken but with a slight tangy taste. The grilled chicken was also served with pitta bread.

In the end, the service and the food was excellent which made up for the lack in d√©cor and seating arrangement. I would recommend Royal lebanese as more for a quick bite or takeaway.

Calm and good place for couple and as well as family. Attendant's behaviour is very good. Service is quick. I have experienced Lebanese first time so I don't want to compare it. But I must say that I enjoyed my food. I have taken Shawarma Roll & Shawarma Salad. Both are delicious üòã. I have visited Royal Lebanese at Deshapriya park branch.

As I was walking towards 'Go Lebanese', I bumped into this place and decided to parcel home a plate of hummus and pita. The hummus was fresh and chilled, with the man at the counter generously dripping olive oil before packing it off. It was creamy and quite nice, though a little more Tahini and a touch of garlic may be nicer (for the mashed chickpeas overpowered the taste a bit). It came with a green chutney which I expected to be jalapeno, but turned out to be a tangy coriander chutney. I didn't like that chutney much and gave it a pass.

Overall, pretty satisfying meal. I intend to go back to try more items, but given my love for Hummus over everything else, I will probably end up having hummus every single time !

The place is an absolute delight for any foodie. This Shawarma junction serves the perfect kind of Lebanese delicacies with just the right flavour to it. We ordered for a Chicken Shawarma wrap along with a Mutton Shawarma wrap; and pita bread with humus. The wraps were awesome at every bite and the pita bread was so subtle and soft; it was much better than I had earlier in other Lebanese joints. 

I have heard good reviews about its Falafel as well. Gotta try that next. No doubt why Ironman loves this joint too.

It is located very near to the Deshapriya Park. Just an ordinary food joint serving Lebanese food items. Ambiance inside is a big big letdown. Not clean and way too less spacious. Tried Grilled Chicken with Mayonnaise Sauce. Chicken was prepared well but couldn't have been more succulent. Pita breads were hard and under-prepared. My overall 3 rating is only for the well prepared chicken and quantity served.

What we ordered - Grilled Chicken with Mayonnaise Sauce

This place came up soon after Go Lebanese. But in comparison to that, this place was a complete flop. We had tried the Shawarma Wrap from here. And what was that? The Pita bread was thick as leather, the chicken too fibrous and dry. And the sauce, it was hardly present. A major thumbdown!

Another Lebanese joint. They opened after Go Lebanese in Southern Avenue. I started having shawarma from them quitting Go Lebanese just for one reason and that was the pricing. But then in a few days, they increased and equalled their prices with the later and thus I shifted back to them. The quality of the food is not bad with a polite service. So I don't really have a complaint about this place but nevertheless, personal choices.

I visited this outlet yesterday at around 12:15-12:30 in the midnight ... Located at the crossing of Desopriyo park right opposite to the Indian Oil petrol pump.
It's a small outlet with a sitting capacity of around 20 ppl.. 
We wanted some food for dinner but the person serving seems to be like not interested to do business whatever we wanted to order he denied saying it will take longer time .. Even though we wanted a simple chicken noodles .. So we ended up ordering Chicken Shawarma Roll and it was moderate and ordinary in taste...

This is located exactly besides zee shan of desapriya park. This is mostly a take away but they do hv a small space upstairs with small revolving chairs.Service is average but polite staff.Space is too short for a restaurant. But food is really good. They serve authentic lebanese food.We had full grilled chicken . About 8 pieces of chickens served with delicious mayonese sauce n green chutney.One plate full is enough for two.Also sawarma wrap is very tasty.Also do try arabian chicken biriyani it is really light served with one chicken piece. Food quality is very good but expense is really low.Nice place to be with friends or take away.Only reason why it loses out is the space.

But the quality and taste is 'finger-lickin-good'

Went there to have Shawarma several times.Even had the saladas.The place is pretty nice.Its mainly a takeaway counter.I mean you can sit and have your food but you see..you have to climb super thin stairs to enter a sort of a cabin..which is airconditioned and the roof has soft cushions at places so that your head does not get a BANG
Coming to food quality...the shawarmas were very nice each and every single time I had it..sweetish mayo with coleslaw with roasted chicken and veggis wrapped in pitta bread..very tasty
The salad..though I had only once was tasty too.
So If you want some nice and different type of food you can try out Royal Lebanese it won't disappoint

Have taken food from Royal Lebanese several times primary reason being its one of the only outlets open till late at night in the area. Food is fluctuating to put it mildly. Sometimes their Chicken Shawarmas are good and sometimes they are undercooked and cold. The kebabs are decent but I find the ones from another lebanese outlet in the area better.¬†

Staff are novice but polite. I feel they should keep the outlet cleaner as the last time I went there the state of the kitchen concerned me.

Near the renowned Maharani/Maharaja, Royal Lebanese is located brilliantly on the Sarat Bose Road. Although there is a small dine-in option for which you will have to take the narrow stairs, this place is mostly for having shawarmas like rolls standing outside the outlet. And they are pretty good with white sauce presented to you liberally on soft pita bread, if you're into that kind of thing. Do not expect too much from the place but 300 bucks will get you way too much value for two.

Being a huge fan of Lebanese food (thanks to Piccadilly of Mumbai), I took my parents to this over-hyped place expecting some mouth watering items when I came back to Kolkata. But I was thoroughly disappointed. I don't care much about decor in an eatery as long as the food is good but here it wasn't the case. The sitting place was tiny and crammed up. The salads were too sweet. The shawarma was nowhere close to authentic and not very tasty either... the chicken pieces were hard and insipid. The biryani although claimed to be Mediterranean- styled was in reality nothing but a poor variation of the Calcutta biryani. For people who have never tasted Lebanese food might find the items novel but I can assure you that true Lebanese food is much more delicious than what is served here. Service was not at all impressive.

i love this place!
and i was having a great craving for chello kebab one day so i decided to try the chello kebab here!
i have only one word for it - HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!
you can say it was the worst decision of my life regarding food!
first of all as we know chello kebab consist of kebabs poached egg and most importantly plain rice with butter!
what these people served was three half cooked chicken kebabs along with th rice from their biriyani! i was so disappointed!!!
i was a lover of this place¬†but now i will just think before going to this place again!!

Thumbs down to this food joint. 
Horrible taste.. It's like wastage of money. It's so inconsistant in terms of quality and quantity.
Be it the Lebanese shawarma or mutton salona or fish tikka or mutton arbi biriyani nothing could satisfy my taste bud. 
I strongly criticize this place.

We ordered for sawarma salad,Arbi Biriyani and chicken salona..The Sawarma was ok ok...but the Arbi biriyani they claimed to have no oil(what they said when we asked what is special about this),absolute oil free but it had enough oil and the chicken salona was simple bengali chicken curry somewhat red in colour..never want to visit again..

With lebanese being one of the newly added favourites of calcuttans .. this place has become popular among college students and food lovers. Royal lebanese is in my top list of the cuisine and visited by me numerous times. Shawarma roll and shawarma salads are best in here as well as their unique lebanese chello kebabs and grilled chicken. One can sit here and eat or take home and enjoy :)

Located just beside the Zeeshan outlet at Deshapriyo Park , Royal Lebanese is a famous Lebanese outlet . 

Shawarma roll , an emerging street food in Kolkata , is slowly gaining prominence . Well , I am a fan of lebanese dishes , and for me to describe this joint's shawarma food is easy . 

Having tried it either , I can feel the difference . The bread is well baked , the amount of chicken filling has increased , and quality too . 
For Rs.100/- , this shawarma now stands in a good position among the other competitors .

If someone can make you love a cuisine when you try it for the first time, you must understand that the food is great. The only outlet of Royal Lebanese to serve freshly cooked foods and that too with great taste. This is the place to be if you intend to try out Lebanese cuisine for the first time, and I can assure you won't be disappointed.

it's just beside zeeshan in deshapriya more. we had chicken sawarma and chicken arbi biriyani. both were awesome. arbi biriyani is much lighter than normal biriyanis. the place is small so don't take along a big gang of friends. 2-3 people together is good.

The first time i had the taste of lebanese cuisine was from this place only. The seating on the first floor is very small and that creates a massive problem if the number of customer is large.   If the space gets filled up then the only option that is left is the simple chairs on the footpath. And having a swarma roll or salad there is troublesome. The previous day i went there, the seating place was very dirty and some people even left chicken bones on the table. It was a horrible sight!! Please provide a better ambience is what i can say.

As far as the quality of food is concerned, this outlet is better than their most other outlets. The food is tasty and most of the time all the items are available except for the desert. 

The people working there are warm and cordial and they explain to u the cuisine ifu r a first time visitor.( it happened yo me when i visited for the first time) . 

Overall a nice place to have swarma. Just that 1 point less is for the ambience on the first floor.

This place is so small but so awesome. I loved the chicken shawarma roll here. I have also had iranian kay kabab and chicken arbi biriyani... And so much food were given to us... Me and my brother just loved it... And the biriyani is so light .. I just loved it.
I wish the pieces of chicken given to us were a little less dry... But then again maybe its the specialty of labanese.... Anyway we just loved it here.
The place is small but cute.
Nice working staff..
And very pocket friendly as well.

Have tried this place only once, conveniently located in Sarat Bose Road and very near to the crossing, this place can be easily spotted. Thankfully didn't have to sit inside, this place doesn't look appealing enough to actually sit inside and dine in. We ordered Iranian shish kebab and a chicken shawarma for take away, and both the dishes were pretty good to eat. Not a huge shawarma fan I do not understand the big deal about this sudden craze for shawarma joints, but honestly the chicken kebab was quite good to eat and of excellent quality, nicely spiced with good flavours and really good quality wise this one dish should be tried if and when one comes here. There's more to shawarma for sure and this joint does serve some good quality kebabs, so do try them if you land up here. 
Staff mostly don't seem interested to serve but that's okay because I don't find people really interested to eat here either, the attitude of the people working here should definitely change for sure. The final verdict would be : A good place to have a light bite now and then, nothing great and perfectly average! Come here if you don't have anywhere else to go.

Royal Lebanese is another Lebanese outlet in an area now sprawling with mushrooming shops and outlets. One of four Lebanese outlets in close proximity. 

While they started strong, the service and the food has dipped drastically. The staff isn't bothered about the food. Most of the time they're out of one component or the other. The small eating area upstairs isn't too looked after either. 

I'd recommend dropping by the more popular Go Lebanese, barely another 3 minutes away or the newly opened Lebanese Delights near Deshapriya Park Road.

Their arbi biryani is excellent, so are all their kebabs. It moves beyond shawarma and pita in the name of lebanese food, and brings to you these amazing items. The rice served with the kebabs and the rice in the biryani is so light. You can enjoy a huge meal without feeling stuffed. :)

I was very hungry and thus this place caught my eyes. I like shawarma a lot so this place seemed a rational choice. The chicken shawarma and the shawarma salad which they provide is a little better than average but the chelo kebab which we ordered was disappointing. Location is very good. Service is somewhat fine.

Its only about food, because they hardly hav any sitting. Its more a take away than dine in. But they are sevring kolkata lebanese food in reasonable prices. The swarma roll and swarma salad is quite good in taste. I am very fond of their arabian biriyani, beacause it brings change in your tastebuds which have got bored by regular moghlai biriyani. 
The kebabs are also good. Sashlik kebab is worth trying. And they make the pita and hummus quite well.
But all the kebabs are not available always.
I am going back soon to try the deserts.

I really don't prefer anything else from here apart from Shwarma dats what it's famous for, and the reason why I don't prefer other items on the menu are firstly it isn't that good and compared to Shwarma those are way behind in taste. So next time around one grab a Shwarma and you won't be  disappointed. I am particularly referring to Sarat base road outlet. I didn't know it just other outlet someone has mentioned I'm the comments below so I am mentioning it that I am referring to Sarat bose road outlet.

This joint near deshapriya park has been quite famous for some time for its lebanese foods.Tried the food and I was surprised ! 
The quality of food was really great and they dont compromise on quantity.Must try. Only thing is you have to take away the food or order a home delivery as the seating arrangement is not suitable.
We ordered : Shwarma Roll & Salad, Mutton Chello kebab.
The roll and salad were awesome and I'm itching to try it out again.The rice in chello kebab was well prepared but the mutton was a bit dry..which hardly mattered. 

Want to try it again for sure !

I've always loved this joint for the food, but the Deshopriyo Park branch fails with regards to the ambiance and decor - really poor there, even the AC doesn't work most of the time, seats are uncomfortable.

The food obviously made up for it - their shawarma salad is excellent. Overall, yes, worth a visit, but for takeaway rather than sit-in dining.

Royal Lebanese- This little outlet is present on Sarat Bose Road,just beside Zeeshan. The large chicken shwarma stack attracts the attention of every passerby...and i feel like stealing it everyday?This is the place where i had my first chicken shwarma wrap. Ambience is zero. There are some tools outside..and there is a tiny room on the first floor with table and tools again. Coming to the food part-
I had chicken shwarma wrap here. The chicken pieces were juicy, tender, succulent. The mayonaese added life to the wrap. The use of olives surprised me. 4 out of 5.
On my next visit i had chicken shwarma salad served with four pita bread. I loved this dish a lot as well. Sometimes i felt like not sharing it with my girl.. ?.. 4 out of 5.
Their chicken shwarma stack did not have any enclosure around it which was a big letdown. Recently, they have put a glass enclosure around it which is great. Overall good food, not so nice ambience.

hi visited this place on sunday afternoon with the family to begin with the seating area upstairs is absolutely dingy and dirty.The service was fast but the quality of food was absolutely disappointing ,we ordered a shawarma which was passable a biryani which was sub standard and a chello kebab which was just some pieces of ¬†kebabs on rice which ¬†people who have had the legendary chello kebab of peter cat would know is not what one expects when one orders a chello kebab.We ordered for 2 cokes which the waiter said were brought from the next shop for rs13 each and added the same to our bill .For some reason the same waiter called someone and told him that he had got 2 cokes from the next shop and served them to us whereupon he was told to issue a bill of 30 each which was very strange because he had already taken the payment from me.An absolutely disappointing afternoon it was after which we had to go elsewhere to finish our lunch.

I first stumbled on to Royal Lebanese while hunting for food with a bunch of friends post a movie. We had tried another Lebanese joint in the vicinity but they were still not ready and our growling tummy brought us here. We decided to try the Arbi Biryani because being Bengali's, Biryani features as one of our favourites...but it was a complete let down. We had to wait for almost half an hour until we got the food. The chicken was dry and uncooked and the rice was bland and tasteless. The interior of the place was a complete let down as well. It was unclean and dingy. 

This happened to be my first experience with Royal Lebanese and I was very wary about going for it the second time. I was very specific about not having the shwarma from here because I was afraid it would be an epic fail like the Arbi Biryani from the outlet. I happened to taste the chicken shwarma from here thanks to my father, who brought it home once and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the mayo was more than adequate and pretty tasty but the chicken was not well seasoned. It was a little bland. The second time I had shwarma from here, I found that the wrap was much well seasoned and I didn't have anything to complain about.

With the price range lower than the other Lebanese joints close by, its a good pick for a quick bite. They should however pay more attention to the interior and the seasoning of the food they prepare.

Shawarma Roll at its best. I have not tried much of their menu, but let me tell you, you cannot go wrong with a Shawarma Roll and the Tahini Sauce. The grilled wing is awesome too. However, their seating arrangement is quite wired. A little cabin like seating place will give a 'Adda' type feel. Visit there with friends, have rolls and chat for hours.

It looks clumsy and the ambience is really poor. I do visit htis place often when I do have less money left lazying around DP region :P

Shawarma Roll at its best. I have not tried much of their menu, but let me tell you, you cannot go wrong with a Shawarma Roll and the Tahini Sauce. The grilled wing is awesome too. However, their seating arrangement is quite wired. A little cabin like seating place will give a 'Adda' type feel. Visit there with friends, have rolls and chat for hours.

I have visited this place for more than 5 times with my girlfriend.
Me and my G.F. both love to have Shawarma Roll.
Every time we visit there we order one Shawarma Roll and one Shawarma Salad.
Its a good lebanese food joint.
They also have a seating arrangement in the upstairs.

Despite great tasting food available here, the slouchy service cant be ignored. Please be prepared to confirm your food order for atleast thrice, yes thats the best of service you can expect there. ¬†Take away is advised, atleast I won't stop visiting as the kebabs and shawarma here are something that my sister and myself swear by.

I am so in love with his place and their Shawarma, both roll and salad. As for others who are complaining that there are other better Lebanese joints, I really have tried almost all of them and then making this statement. And also I am not the only one, I got friends too who accept that they do serve the best Tahini sauce. Also for a change he grilled chicken goes awesomely with pita bread and extra sauce. I mean this literally, there are times I am sad, and there are times when I just pack a shawarma to be had at home and I am so more happy! Only con I would mention here is the seating area, that is too suffocatingly small or else I would have given this place the 1.5 points that I have not.

Food quality is not satisfied except the salad, biriyani is to dry so does the kebab. Service is fast but reqd to look after the food quality for repeat customers.

One of the two Lebanese joints located on the sarat bose joints, I'd rate this place 2nd to the the other one. Only good things are the prompt staff n the seating arrangement above. The food is cheap n okayish. I like the roasted chicken above other dishes served here. Good as a quick bite.

Food quality has deteriorated. Yet I like it. 
The salad and roll is good. You get extra sauce if you ask. 
Other than that the kebabs are too try. The biriyani too weird.

Come here just for the shawarma.

Happy eating!

First time I tried Lebanese was at this place. Their shwarma rolls are excellent, their special oil & fat Free biriyani (I seriously dont know how that is possible??) is average. If you go only for the rolls the place is great but the biriyani is not up to the mark it's infact quite bland. Its best to take away from here, Does not have a very large place to sit and the sitting place gets cramped very soon. Service ¬†while having in the restaurant is not very good... So to sum up its only good for rolls and if you only takeaway food..

You want to check how Kolkata can surprise you with Lebanese food. Then, you definitely don't want to visit Royal Lebanese.¬†
They have successfully spoiled the class of lebanese food set by the pioneers of Shwarma in Kolkata, Go Lebanese. These guys just try to copy the original brand Go Lebanese.¬†
But seriously their food tastes shit. i hated it. The Hummus is just tasteless and the Shwarma, though filling can't mark a good impression.¬†
Ladies and Gentlemen if you want to try real good shwarma try Go Lebanese. :)

This place is a small take away joint serving really nice mouthwatering Lebanese food. I have been there twice and both the times the quality of the food satisfied me. The chicken shawarma is absolutely delicious and very filling indeed. I have also tried out the irani kebab which they serve with pita bread and is again delicious. The mutton biryani however was very disappointing.

The order arrived an hour late, which was still okay. But the food was totally cold. The shawarma was already torn into several parts. But still the taste was good. The cello kebab was pathetic. The rice was as if scooped from some biriyani pack, it was cold and tasteless. The chicken chunks were dry and hard as rock. Overall, a very bad experience. Will never order again from them. Waste of money. The 1.5 is for the taste of the Shawarma....

This place is just beside Zeeshan at Deshapriya Park. I've been here 3-4 times. The food is okay-ish. It's definitely not the best lebanese I've had.

The shawarma roll has a lot of filling but the sauce/humus does not taste that great! But on the up side this place is pocket friendly. :) It's definitely worth an evening snack every now and then.

Placed very near to Deshapriya Park Stop (Just Opposite), the place is very easy to find. Like its older brother 'Go Lebanese', this place is also very compact and small. Though it has a sitting arrangement in the first floor, it is better not to take those stairs as they seem rather fragile. Coming to food quality and hospitality, since the nearby Lebanese joint Go Lebanese has gone dim over the years, this place is now can be called as the heart of Lebanese Food around Deshapriya Park area. Their Shawarma is an absolute delight to have, and so is their grilled chicken. Though I must say that the Pita bread they serve is most of the times not optimally good. The last time I visited this place they were out of Mint Chutney, that goes hand in hand with Lebanese Food, which was a drawback. This also tells you of their consistency. Overall a good eatery for Lebanese Food without pinching the pocket much. The staffs were also okay. If only the outlet was a bit more spacious, with more consistent food quality, it would easily turn into an ideal dinner or lunch place rather than only a road side eatery.

Though there are several outlets of Royal Lebanese now in Kolkata, I have been only trying from this outlet beside Zeeshan at Desapriya Park. This outlet is close to another great Lebanese food joint (or alternative) 'Go Lebanese' and I have found that both these eateries serve almost similar food items. No doubt the localites are being treated to some of the the best Lebanese dishes the city has to offer.¬†

When you are here at Royal Lebanese, you should definitely go for Grilled Chicken, Shawarma Roll, Humus & Pita bread. Though there is a small seating arrangement in the first floor but I always prefer to take-away from their ground floor counter. The service is quite fast and the person sitting at billing counter lets you know if there is a bit of waiting time. Coming to the food item I like most - the Grilled Chicken is something for which I keep on visiting this place time and again. I always go for one Full Grilled Chicken and ask them not to cut it into pieces, the chicken is optimally spiced and succulent, it is always grilled to perfection, it comes with pita bread, onion/chilies and Pudina Chutney - together they taste so good. But there have been couple of occasions where I found the pita bread to be extremely dry and hard which can really spoil the whole dish. Leaving aside these few instances it has been a pleasant experience for me dining at this place. Though I suggest getting a better sitting arrangement with some nice ambiance will attract more foodies to this place.

With Lebanese cuisine becoming popular in the city with each passing day this food joint surely has got the potential to make it big in this scenario. Their dishes have got the flavors with depth in them, that makes me recommend this place to anyone in love with Lebanese cuisine. Cheers!

Location: Sarat Bose Road. 

Located right beside Zeeshan and Paparazzi Cafe, this outlet of Royal Lebanese, as the name suggests excells in Lebanese Fooding and yes, they serves decent Lebanese food. 
It's divided into two sections, the ground floor being occupied by the takeaway counter and the first floor turned into a small sit-n-dine place with minimal seating facility. 
-Its best to opt for a takeaway. 

Being close to my place have visited this outlet quite a few times and have always stuck to the Paneer Shawarma Wrap and Humus and Pita Bread. 
What I have noticed until now is that the amount of veggies they put into the wrap fluctuates according to their whims and fancies plus the amount of Mayo pushed into is way too much which literally kills the flavour of the whole wrap. 
And, the fluffiness of the Pita bread fluctuates as well, at times it's soft and at times it starts breaking off. The hummus however tasted good. 

These fluctuations make the experiences fluctuate as well. 
Would wish for a stabilized service whatsoever. :-)

This best describes this small outlet serving Lebanese food, located near Deshapriya Park. Seating space is a constraint, but the food is awesome. 
I ordered their Chicken Arbi Biriyani and Iranish Fish Sish Kebab with Masala Cold Drinks.
Special mention for the Chicken Biriyani-less oily yet tast. Chicken was cooked to perfection.
Iranian Fish Sish Kebab was heavenly. Chunks of Bhetki fish perfectly cooked and served in Kebab style with green chutney. I kept licking my fingers and the plates unless they were clean.
Enjoyed every bit of the servings and shall definetely visit the again, perhaps at their other outlets at Minto Park or recently opened outlet near City Centre-I.
This outlet is a must-try.

Went with some batch-mates a week ago to fulfill our starvation during lunch hours.Frankly speaking,this place have utterly disappointed me.The first and foremost thing that made me down is the accomodation of this place.Hardly it is a 8-seater resturant with a single long platform where you are supposed to keep your plate and eat  but yes, this place is Air-Conditioned.They don't take much time to serve hardly within 20 minutes you will be served with your order.
Now coming to the point of quality of food....
We have ordered Mutton Biriyani and Shwarma...
Biriyani is literally pathetic but the Raita  that is served along with Biriyani had made my day...simply awesome....
And about the Shwarma...more and more that I tell about it will not be enough...This is for the first time I have this food and will love to have it for plenty in future compromising the quantity of this item.Only Shwarma is not enough to fulfill your appetite for lunch.You need to order some other dishes too.
I would like to visit the place again only for Shwarmas,still haven't tasted other dishes yet.Improvement of seating arrangement  is highly recommended to the management.

On two visits to Royal Lebanese, I've had their Chicken Shawarma (obviously), the Chicken Arbi Biryani, and the Iranian Kay Kabab. The Shawarma was pretty good, although there wasn't really anything extraordinary to differentiate it from the Shawarma at most other outlets (which are pretty good themselves). The Arbi Biryani, however, is a different ballgame altogether. I've had biryani from most of the famous Mughlai restaurants of Kolkata, and this is nothing like it, but in a really good way. The biryani comes with a piece of mutton, a potato, and Irani raita. The texture of the biryani was somewhat on the drier side, as opposed to the Mughlai biryani which is somewhat more moist.But the raita made all the difference in the world. It was simply beautiful, a nice creamy texture with just a hint of sourness that blended with the biryani extraordinarily well. The mutton was well cooked, tender enough but with a slight grilled edge to it. The Iranian Kay Kababs by themselves were really good, but they didn't make a great combo with the pita bread, as the overall effect was too dry. Overall, a really good experience.

Honestly I am amazed by the quality of food provided...we ordered for a home delivery took one hour and thirty minutes to deliver ( deshpriya park to Lake market)....I wasn't upset because I thought food is being cooked fresh so I really didn't have a problem, followed up only once. We ordered of One mutton Arbi Biryani, One mutton Chello Kebab and one Iranian Fish Tikka ...now let me come to each of the dishes.....before I go any further I have had arab food all through my life in different countries and its a shame that these guys are calling this arab food...any arab will have a heart attack having this food...the food was cold to start with, there was no basic difference between Indian biryani and Arabi biryani...just I could smell a bit of olive oil....Chello Kebab..shame on these guys....I would request the owner to go to Peter Cat and have the Chello Kebab..Don't have to go to Iran that's too far ..... just terrible...extremely hard mutton Seekh kebabs given along with cold saffron colored rice.... last came the fish...the fish was not even cooked properly it was raw inside and we had to throw it away...I do like medium rare....but thats for stake not for fish.... anyway terrible experience...guys think twice before you go to this place...and I paid 520 Rs. for the three dishes ( no extra home delivery cost)...

A place I have visited often and got home delivered many times as well. Food is good, the shwarma, the grilled chicken, the biryani, chelo kabab all are good. So if food is all that matters to you then Royal Lebanese is good. But thats where the good part ends. 

Seating is barely enough for 4-5persons which is on a mezanine floor above the shop. And if you are taller than 5.7-5.8 your head is bound to hit the ceiling.

If you are ordering Royal lebanese home plz keep enough time in hand. They have a single delivery guy for more than 1 outlet of theirs, as told to me by the delivery guy. It will take at least an hr to an hr and 15min to get food delivered to even 2kms. Personal experience many times. And when you tell the delivery guy why so late, he is rude and arrogant and says "I am not responsible, if you have issues speak to the guy who took your order. I have to handle multiple outlets so its not my fault" So post this experience, my wife and I have decided to stop ordering from Royal Lebanese

Have always loved the Go lebanese shawarmas and inspite of passing by this outlet innumerable times, dint try them until recently when i had the falafel wrap which was utterly disappointing. The falafels were very mediocre and the wrap was laden with mayo with minimal veggies that killed it. The kitchen area seemed clean to me which is the only positive i could derive but the food quality was horrible and they suffer from the same habit as so many other lebanese joints in the city which is to load your wraps with mayo instead of the veggies!!!

Opting for delivery? DON'T. This place probably has the worst customer service in all of Calcutta. I ordered a Mutton Chello kebab at 11:40 AM. Called up the buggers an hour later and they told me it's on the way. Same thing 2 hours hence.
At 2:30 they had the gumption to call me. A lady called up and said in a very ingratiating voice" Dekhun Sir, Mutton Chello kebab ta to poaa jaccey na. Ami ki ekta chikcken chello kebab pathaiye debo?"

I did the most polite thing I could think of under such circumstances (I was starving) . I did not utter any expletives. I slammed the phone down.

Lesson leant. Rant over

Cheers fellow foodies. Avoid this place like plague.

Whenever I go to Priya for watching a movie, I make sure I have a Shawarma Roll from here. The first time I got introduced to Shawarma was Spencers, and since then i love eating shawarmas. But this shawarma is indeed one of the best in town. Other items are pretty decent. But when it comes to Shawarma Roll and Shawarma Salad, this is THE place to have it. My high rating is only for the SHAWARMA ROLL and SHAWARMA SALAD.

This is the first place I tried shawarma after go lebanese and I wasn't disappointed. They knew what they were doing. Good tasty shawarma and the grilled chicken was just marvelous. The shawarma salad was a little low on the quantity side but if we overlook that then it is okay. This place was a good competition to Go Lebanese. But it has it's drawbacks. The staff is really slow and takes a long time to serve. And also lacks a proper seating arrangement.
            

Edit(08-09-2016):Ordered a plate of Chicken Shawarma Salad from here after ages. It was the most tasteless Shawarma I have ever had. It was on the verge of being inedible. Disgusted. It felt as as they just boiled everything together and packed it. Never coming here again.

Before visiting this place I heard many good reviews about this place. But it was really a horrifying experience for me. I ordered chello kebab. The rice was not at well cooked and was half boiled. The chicken kebab (as they call it kebab) is not at all tasty. It was dry and I hardly got any taste of kebab. The day was completely spoilt.

Located near deshapriya park, Royal Lebanese comes to notice easily.. On my b'day my boyfriend and i decided to try out some Lebanese food and visited the small joint. We ordered the chicken shawarma roll. Now it was around 2-2:30pm and they said it'll take a little time to prepare the sauce so we went upstairs and waited. The place is REALLY small. But the low point was neither the space nor the narrow stairs but the lack of cleanliness.

While we were asked to wait for 15 mins, the order arrived more than 30 mins later by which time both our appetite and patience had come to the edge. But as i tasted the shawarma, all these were instantly forgotten. The roll was pretty tasty with sumptuous amount of chicken and other fillings in it. Both our hunger and taste buds were satisfied and we liked it so much that we ordered another one. Surprisingly they made it, packed it in less than two mins! 

Overall it was a nice experience apart from the initial slow service. But as it has made me crave for Lebanese food insanely, i'll surely visit Royal Lebanese again.

I have been visiting thia place quite some time and surprisingly this is one place where the food quality and staff behaviour has deteriorated consistently.  Today I was utterly disappointed with the food and staff behaviour as I had ordered a shawarma and the guy just wrapped the bread with just chicken blatantly stating he won't put any veggies just because he didn't have them chopped and he would have to chop veggies then. I had to yell at the guy and then after kerping me waiting he preapared the roll. This is preposterous I mean I am paying for the food so at least they should serve quality food !! Mr. owner if u read this please make sure your food quality improves and your staff behaves properly else your joint is gone!!!

This Lebanese restaurant close to deshapriya park is a nice option for the gariahat shoppers to munch on a shawarma.
Ambience 6/10
Best as a take away. The first floor area is quite untidy and you'll definitely feel the space crunch especially if you have a good height. can't accommodate more than 8 people,but yes there is an ac.
Food Presentation 6/10
Whatever you order will be served along with onion and chilies and green chutney. Nothing special about it.
Food Quality 7/10
The shawarma salad is good,but not great. In fact I find their Hummus Nashib with pita bread much better here! What you should not order is the fish kebab,it has too much mustard sauce! But the hummus is a must try!
Food Quantity 7/10
Any platter will fill your tummy during snack hours. however,for a proper meal,you must order more that one dish per person.
Cost effectiveness 8/10
The prices are similar to most of the Lebanese outlets in the city.
Overall 34/50

Well .... Royal Lebanese is the place where I  tasted my first Chicken Shawarma wrap ... And all it did is increase my craving for Lebanese food !!!!!
Well,this place is conviniently located at Deshapriya park crossing....and after a hard day's work,if you are damn hungry and wanna grab a quick bite,this place is a great choice!!!! 
Me and my friend ordered a chicken shawarma wrap and a chicken shawarma salad!! And.... Both of them tasted great !!! The wrap was deliciously filled with chicken,vegetables and white sauce in a soft pita roll !! Salad had the same filling but with two pita breads !!! Both of them were served with yummy green chutni and onions !!!!
The only disappointment was the seating place....its in the first floor and the stairs are really steep !!! There is no seperate table...only some tools and a common attached eating platform !!!!
Overall...I will give it 3.5 stars !!!! Its a great place to grab a quick bite and satisfy your hunger !!

This is the worst of the four Lebanese joints I have tried around the city. The taste is farthest from authentic and borders on almost indian. The shawarma was dry. They are always out of the mutton dishes. The Iranian kebab portion was good but but there was nothing Iranian about it. More so it was served with rice. Dry and with  artificial coloring. None of the mains were not accompanied by hummus. The pita was soggy and doughy.
If you want to try Lebanese, this is the last place to consider.

I love grilled chicken. So, I take shops selling grilled chicken very seriously. Needless to say I'm going to scrutinize to a huge extent. 
I was happy to see the price of one full chicken. 250 bucks. Pretty modest if you ask me. Anyhow when I actually went to the shop.. I got the first shocker. The price was 330 rupees. And the reason he gave was so lame I have to mention it.... 'The chicken is jumbo sized'.  Since I was really hungry and craving chicken, I put up with his polished business skills and asked for it. I would have pardoned the high pricing had the taste been up to the mark. 
Grilled chicken is maroonish in color. What they gave was brown. The chicken was NOT properly cooked and the flavour was meek.
Now we get a special white sauce along with grilled chicken...it is supposed to complimentary..yet it wasnt. Kuboos(pita bread) is supposed yo be complimentary.. It wasn't. The quantity of sauce and bread they gave was laughable.
If you're looking for quality Arabian dishes..go to an authentic outlet..not this rip off.
Everything was a let down.
Thank you :)

Food was excellent, but the staff and service was very disappointing. I went with my colleague on 27.11.13 afternoon and found that there was no staff infront of the store, waited for some time but still no body came to take the order. Then i had to peep inside and ask the staff if they can take the order. Then after almost 2 mins a staff (probably his name was BIRJU) came out. We ordered for chicken shawarma roll and a salad. I was quite stunned to see that the staff was not at all interested to prepare the order, in fact that staff was insisting us to accept the roll which was prepared early and lying outside. When we refused, they were very dissatisfied and started on calling another staff to prepare the roll. The staff who came out first clearly refused that he wont prepare the roll, but after constant request from mr. Birju, he agreed and started preparing the roll. We got the roll after atleast 15 mins post we placed the order. Now the wait for salad started, which ended after around 25 mins post order. 

I will again say the food taste was very good (thats why 2.5), but the staff's behavior and service was YUK

Well, this is my first review for any restaurant in Kolkata and what an "eating out" experience it's turned out to be! The only reason this is my first review is because I was waiting for that ONE "Out of The World" experience to start writing my reviews and I'm glad that I got the opportunity today after visiting this joint with my wife and 2 kids. However, before I even start reviewing the food, please note that this is definitely NOT a place for "Dining In" (and the guys are realistic enough to accept that and advice a visit to their Hindustan Park outlet which is more spacious for a better Dine - In experience. Now for the review item-wise:

1. Shawarma Salad - Simply fantastic and delicious. The amount of Mayonnaise was just right for the salad and tossing was also perfect. It was the best Shawarma salad I've ever had (and believe me, I've had a lot of them from my days of working in Bangalore). It was so good even my 2 year old discarded everything else and started enjoying the salad.

2. Grilled Chicken - Grilled to Perfection with the right amount of seasoning. Simple lip - smacking.

3. Iranian Sheesh Kabab - More like Chicken Reshmi Kabab (which we are more accustomed to), my elder son simply loved it and made his displeasure clear when asked to share.

4. Iranian Kay Kabab - Prepared using Iranian Herbs & Spices, this dish is the only one which wasn't really up to  the mark and hence the "Near Perfect" rating.

PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION - SHAWARMA SALAD.

Today I went to this place. After reading the raving reviews here I planned on giving my friends a treat here. But sadly when I entered the place I was thoroughly disappointed. More so by the reviewers here. No one here has cared to mention that this place doesn't have proper sitting arrangements. They just have a bench and few stools. May be the food is great which we didn't get to try because we needed a proper place to sit and eat but the ambience is not good at all. They should not call themselves a proper restaurant because they are not.

Across the road from Deshapriya Park, is Royal Lebanese. The take away counter takes up the ground floor, while a tiny restaurant with limited seating is on top. Try the Chicken shawarma wrap (Rs 80) here, with strips of grilled chicken with a distinct smoky flavour, some mayonnaise, chopped tomatoes and capsicum in fresh pita, The Iranian Fish Tikka (Rs 150) on the other hand has tender chunks of fish served with green chutney and enveloped in pita. If you‚Äôre looking for a local take on Lebanese food, this is it.

My second Lebanese adventure, this time Shawarma salad instead of wrap. This outlet is meant for take away services. So plan accordingly. Poor service. Took a lot of time to prepare our food. Could have garnished the salad better and served more variety of sauces. The pita breads were cold. Overall experience was not quite good.

Kolkata is facing an invasion for some time, an invasion not with swords or bullets, but with pita breads and shawarmas. Though from my childhood I have seen many places that tried to provide at least some items of Lebanese cuisine, in the recent past there has been a great improvement, both in terms of quality and quantity. One of the fore runners in providing street-side Lebanese food is Royal Lebanese.

There is nothing much to write about their ambiance since this is primarily a take away. I had gone inside once and still regret it. The space is even less than a proper bathroom. The ceiling is very low, so tall people, be careful. The place is crammed and stuffy. There are small chairs that would make you sit clumsily on them. But since Zomato has not mentioned this place as a dine-in I won't deduct any marks for the ambiance.

I have had food from here a lot of times and this "lot of times" is simply because of their great quality and taste. The food is really top class. They have done proper justice to the cuisine by keeping a proper balance between Eastern and European tastes. Lebanese cuisine primarily uses poultry as its meat and hence I would recommend all to abstain from the mutton preparations, though I have never had them. The sahwarma salad is definitely among the best that Kolkata can provide. They give sufficient number of pita breads along with it. The breads can be made better and bigger , but the money at which it comes makes up for it.  However the salad is yummy, juicy and properly mixed, preserving the necessary creamy texture along with  the properly grilled chicken pieces. I would also recommend their grilled chicken. Its simply too good. Most of the times I stick to the salad, but once I did the blunder of ordering Biriyani. For all those who love their Biriyani in the standard style and taste this would be a heart break. Since they serve oil -less biriyani, the taste gets compromised a lot. However, why would anyone order Biriyani from here. Overall the food is really worth giving full credit to. I would love to see them add other items to their menu but still there is no denying the fact that this place can satisfy me with their great preparations. Love it.

Its small & colorful joint near heart of Gariahut....After a hectic shopping schedule the food at Royal Lebanese was a treat for a food lover like me!! It wasnt authentic Lebanese food but tasty enough! 
Humus Naseeb & pita bread & the special chicken biriyani was good! I ate & packed as well.
The price was moderate but unfortunately everything mentioned in menu was't ready, same time no cold drinks served. That needs to be added soon! 
Overall neat,clean place with good service & food!

although the taste is indianised but none the less it was delicious... thats what matters at the end of the day. hearing a lot abt their arbi biryani from my friends will give it a shot in a few days. 

P.s. their work area is clean... which is a big plus considering the traffic that they have

IF YOU PLAN TO EAT HERE, YOU NEED TO READ THIS REVIEW.

Well... Now here is a review that ain't gonna praise a restaurant that serves arguably good food. I felt the food is okay, though not entirely authentic Lebanese. The pita breads were thin, and this is probably the only Lebasene outlet that makes you eat kabab with Pudina Chutney!!! I mean, What is it, chicken pakora????!!!!! The Shawarma Wrap was good, though.

However, the basic intention of this review is NOT to talk about the cuisine. It is to talk about DISHONESTY & being BLATANT LIARS. Let me tell you the story in details:

We decided to have Lebanese food for lunch and thought that we would opt for home delivey. Zomato reviews made me try out Royal Lebanese. 

11:30 am: The restaurant opening time is 11:30 am according to Zomato listings. I called them up at around that time, and the person who answered the call informed me that home delivery wouldn't start before 1:30 pm. He did not take my order and asked me to call them back at around 1 pm. 

1:00 pm: I called them again 5 minutes before 1 pm. This time the same guy answered my call and took the order. He informed me that the order will be delivered by 2 pm. I was okay with that. 

2 pm: The guy called me back and informed me that they have ran out of Mutton dishes, and if it was okay if he replaced them with Chicken preparations. I agreed. I asked him about when I can expect my order delivered, since it was already 2 pm. He told me that the delivery guy is out to deliver some other order, and will come to me next. From reading the previous reviews on Zomato, I was prepared for their delayed home delivery service. 

2:45 pm: I called the guy to inquire about the status of the order. He told me that the delivery guy was out for delivery. I threatened him that I will have tocancel the order if it is not delivered in some more time. He told me that he will call up the delivery guy and ask him where he is.

3:05 pm: I called again!!! I was pissed off big time by then, and was on the verge of canceling the order. This time, the guy told me that the delivery guy HAS MISSED MY STREET and went into some other road. However, now he is near my home. I asked the guy to give me the cell no. of the delivery guy, to which he said that the delivery guy has my no. and will call me up when he reaches.

3:15 pm: The order is delivered.... and THE DELIVERY GUY INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD TO HURRY TO DELIVER THE ORDER SINCE THE RESTAURANT PEOPLE HAD JUST HANDED HIM THE PARCEL 5 MINUTES BACK!!! HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT IT IS A COMMON PRACTICE BY THIS RESTAURANT TO LIE BLATANTLY ABOUT THE ORDER STATUS. ALSO, HE NEVER WENT OUT FOR ANY OTHER DELIVERY BEFORE COMING TO ME AND THAT HE NEVER MISSED MY STREET ("..aami kaachhei thaaki", he told me!!!). THE ENTIRE STORY OF HIM BEING DELAYED DUE TO A PREVIOUS DELIVERY AND MESSING UP MY ADDRESS TURNED OUT TO BE FALSE..... A BLATANT LIE.

After this revelation (which I was suspecting, anyway), the quality of the food didn't matter much. These people are bloody dishonest liars who do not have the slightest sense of business or professionalism. If it were possible, I would have given these thugs a minus ten.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Stay away from these crooks.

Today we wanted Lebanese food home delivered instead of picking up some biriyani (which was our earlier plan). Once the food arrived, honestly, if someone blindfolded me and asked what I was eating, I probably would have told that I was eating Biriyani with Kosha mangsho!! That was our LEBANESE food experience today. The food was tasty, quality was not bad at all. But trust me, as I have had authentic Lebanese food thousands of times while I lived abroad, and I myself can cook middle eastern dishes, this Royal Lebanese food is anything but Lebanese. A Chello kabab with green chillies in it!! A Lebanese kabab to eat with green chilli-mint chutney!! Are you serious? The veg biryani, for a second I thought the delivery boy must have picked up from a Mughlai food store on his way to our home! It was so Mughlai!! And the Pita bread that is single layered and no pocket at all!! And one reviewer tells us here that the Royal Lebanese guy told that the thin pita bread is intentional, as a thicker one won't bake properly and the customers will have their stomach upset!! Are you kidding me? So the entire Middle East have their stomach upset or the thick, pocketed Pita bread does not exist in this world! And Paneer in Lebanese cuisine!!! WOW!!
Do us a favour and change the name of this restaurant to anything you like, except Lebanese. For those who are uninitiated in Lebanese fare, this restaurant is creating wrong idea about Lebanese food. 
People, if you do not care about how Lebanese food tastes like, you will like Royal Lebanese. And if you are looking to know how good Lebanese foods are, go some place else.

Royal Lebanese is definitely one such place where satisfaction rating is high - a mix of quality of fresh food, service, location and of course 'for a song' price!
I ordered Paneer Shawarma Roll, Falafel Sandwich & Humus with Pita Bread and sat inside my car putting up some good music tracks to wait for my meal as I generally have to do at other places. But to my surprise, all the three orders were brought to me in different good quality plates,neatly wrapped and under 10 minutes!!! 
Fresh they were for sure, the aroma was strong, herbs with olives well placed in the presentation. Falafel Sandwich was crisp, different and good to taste. Important observation is that the hummus was not very thick that sometimes becomes nauseating, it had good consistency, Pita bread was thin comparatively - I went up to the gentleman behind the cash counter to ask why this so. He explained that if the bread is made thick, then it wont get bakes properly from one side and that constant eating of such breads at regular intervals may upset the stomach. His explanation and communication skills added for 0.5 extra ratings here totaling 4.0 (Great).
Price for two - Rs 200 approx

Amazing food. I go all the way from garfa just to grab their food. Simply love the shawarma. The grilled chicken is to dieeee for. The chello kebab is simply yummy. The best part is the restaurant is so pocket-friendly that you can keep hogging without feeling a pinch in your pocket. The staff with their smile also add a refreshing touch. Simply love you guys... Oh God, feel like having a grilled chicken right now. Royal Lebanese, i guess you will see me at the counter tomorrow itself.

try grilled chicken.its their best serve and is yummilicious with the spicy green chutney and good portion of mayo,served is soft and filling pita bread.
the shwarma roll tasted as good as go lebanese,yet 15 rupees cheaper,but at times i have the chicken hard and chewy.the shawarma roll is better made at the other joint.
the hummus is disastrous in itself.the chicken in hummus were so hard.i tried it in 2 occassions ,and it was equally miserable both the time.
the positive aspect is you can sit and eat in a.c.,though not very comfortable due to narrow and steep flight of stairs and the low ceiling height,yet its needed in scorching summer and monsoon

aaj gayi royal lebanese pe at around 4 pm..was damn hungry and the pocket was pretty empty after a full day puja shopping..wanted some non oily stuff and so thought for the non oily arbi biriyani that royal lebanese serves and  mind it..it was just awsomeee...the taste was mind vlowing and it was surely oil free..the little quantity u will find on ur fingers is just extra virgin olive oil which can give relief to the calorie conscious people which excludes me for sure..the iranian raita which comes with it is like a breeze of relief from the monotonous taste of the biriyani..the size of the chicken was good too...atleast better than mughlai restaurants..the next thing we had today was the swarma roll and it was good as usual..the sitting arrangement though not spacious was good enough for two..the food came within 5 mins and so the timing seemed better than most..in all it can be rated as one of the best and cheapest food joint in kolkata in which we can satisfy our hunger and our heart



----- 03 Aug, 2013 -----

been there on 2nd aug..had a shwarma salad. i must tell one thing.its damn better than south city spenser wala shwarma salad.  the price was affordable enough specially for students like us. one salad for two is good enough too. though they should  really arrange for seating arrangementbut on the whole what matters is taste for me. so its a thumps up for this one. loved ur shwarma..

this is mainly a take away but it has a very nice subatomic sized sitting place upstair. i loved this tiny part of it ,as it gives relief in humid kolkata weather. 
they donot charge extra for serving in d teensy ac part. it has 6 or 7 tool to sit which is uncomfy a bit ,but in that little space much shouldnt be expected.
now, their shawarma was absolutely delicious with perfectly cooked chicken on rotisserie, pita bread n the mayonese.
the humus were good though not great, with the good chunks of chicken. the pita bread served with this are enough to fill 2 people.
i liked their food a lot and i will be bumping in when ever i m near to the place.

Avoid their home delivery. Although we frequently order from here, we placed an order at 8.50 p.m. but received the food at 10.50 p.m. Our house is a 7 minute drive from their restaurant. A two hour delay for dinner, especially Lebanese food, is a big letdown.
Do try their Chicken Shawarma, Pita and Hummus Chicken along with Chelo Kebab. Food is tasty so do pick up your shawarmas from here which fills your stomach up when you are super hungry!

I had ordered their Shawarma roll,Arbi Mutton Biryani and Chicken salona for home delivery.The Shawarma was quite nice.The speciality of the Biryani was it was really less oily compared to all other Biryanis.I found it different but somehow I prefer the traditional biryanis.Those who do not like oily food and oily biryani will like this.The Chicken item was also well made and very less oily.The quantity of the food items were very good.
I have not been to this place in person.So cant comment about the ambience and decor and service.One thing I can say is that their home delivery came really late.They promised they will send the food around 9.But the food arrived around 10.

one of the better take away joints. with a wide array of lebanese foods that taste ok for the prices charged. the shwarmas are ok. but the pick of the lot is the arbi biriyani. one thing that the place lacks is consistency. one day the biriyani blows your mind off and on other days its just a lumpy mess. a 3 rating cause of the specks of good food they sometimes serve.

I give this restaurant a 1 rating, because -2 is not possible. We had the worst possible Chicken Arbi Biriyani here. The rice felt and tasted like  boiled rubber strips. The Chicken itself was flavorless and under cooked. The seating area upstairs was dirty,dinghy and wet! NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!

if you are crazy for lebanese food , then do not give this little joint off deshapriya park a miss.. makes delectable food especially iranian fish sish kabab, mutton arbi biriyani and bajbouja... the arbi biriyani was indeed a miracle with sumptuous quantities of rice( good enough for two ), nice juicy pieces of mutton and an irresistible taste....but , one thing i would want them to improve on is the shawarma... found it a bit dry on both the occasions when i tried it.... but, overall , a good experience with minimum stress on the pockets...

A cheap 2nd grade place, passing any grovel they can conjure as Lebanese, which is very difficult to reconcile with after waiting for about an hour and a half. Have been a bit adventurous and tried out more or less everything on the menu. Havent found anything to write home about.  

Be ready to wait for about an hour and a half after you are told that it will take 20, have people served out of turn, and hear excuses like "the gas ran out", "we are out of sauce", "we are out of chicken". 

The hummus is as unpalatable as the hubris.   

On the plus side, it is cheap.

Desperately wanted to go for authentic Lebanese cuisine for quite a while now...hence motivated and dragged my colleagues along to Royal Lebanese at Deshapriya Park stoppage...
High on expectation and low on patience we reached and asked the guy at the counter where to take a seat?...He didnt look much excited..to say the least. In fact it was as if he was trying to dissuade us from waiting by repeatedly highlighting that we need to wait for a "LONG time" and also that we "HAVE TO" collect the order ourselves by coming down after 20mins...so that doesnt say much about service...
Anyways...it was gonna take more than that to scare us away...so we ordered..and headed upstairs convincing ourselves that the wait will be worth it....it wasnt really sooo worth it... :(
Had Shawarma (good), Chicken Kay Kebab (Not so good) and Arbi Chicken Biriyani (just ok)..

So heres my scores...

Thumbs Up: :)

- Shawarma (6/10) - the better of their offerings..had better though...I would recommend Shawarma at Ar Han Thai @ Burp, Forum Mall, over this, if you really want the best.. 
- Reasonably priced (6/10) - easy on the pocket
- Location (8/10) - located centrally

Thumbs Down: :(

- Service (5/10) - Could have been better...
- Space (4/10) - the obvious lack of it...also needs cleaning in the dining area
- Chicken Kay Kebab (4/10) - I still prefer Mughlai kebabs any day to these...sad but true..
- Arbi Biriyani -  I still prefer my Arsalan Muglai Biriyani any day to carrot laden arbi biriyani..sad but true..

All in all...a one time visit for me..atleast till the time I find the need to go back to them and give them a second chance...

Had food from here some 6 months back and would not recommend this over Go Lebanese. The Chicken Shawarma was just ok, but the hummus sauce with it was awful in taste. The kebabs we ordered were a disaster. Trust me, there were 6 of us and no of us managed to have more than one bite of that horrible kebab. Moreover, they made us wait almost 50 minutes to deliver our food and at the end of it all, all we got was okayish shawarma and horrible kebabs. Thumbs down to this place. I sincerely hope they improve their quality and service by leaps and bounds to be able to draw attention to the Go Lebanese faithfuls. Till then, Go Lebanese all the way :) ..

Food: 3/5
Service: 1/5 (very slow)
Ambiance: 1/5 (Take away is recommended)
Must try: Shawarma Roll and Iranian Kebabs.

Just in curiosity after seeing lot of reviews for Royal Lebanese went there today (23rd June, 2013) with my friends. First of all it's not a restaurant it's a typical Fast Food Stall having seating arrangements upstairs just above the main stall with steep narrow stairs and counter top along the side of the wall for eating (no tables because of small space) purpose. After we arrived there, the upstairs was full so we had to wait. In the meantime they were running out of pita bread, once the pita bread was ready we ordered couple of Shawarma Roll and it taste very nice with chicken and mayo.

As per the service it's just aweful, they hardly care about what you order or want to have (especially upstairs). We ordered 2 full Afgani mutton biriyani and Semak (fish) Lebanah. Quantity wise it's equal to 1 plate of biriyani if ordered half. Biriyani was quite light in taste, less oil/dalda was used and the rice was bit dry. We waited for the fish to come but it never reached us even after giving reminders so we decided to move on.

I went there with high hopes but it seems they were having tough time to manage all orders. I have never seen such confused staff in a small stall like this. I could not try other dishes due to their lack of seriousness towards the service. Before leaving the place I peeped into their kitchen and saw hot kebabs pierced into the seekh which seems to be delicious but my bad luck, will try those next time.

I rated 3 just for the food. Ambiance is quite messed up and water spilled all over the place. Take away is recommended.

Nice location and very close to my house and all so was kind of unsure about it. I have had the shawarma role before, its definitely good, however, I felt that probably the amount of chicken which goes into it is a tad lesser than Go Lebanese and the mayo could have been better.
Nevertheless it was pretty good and I quite enjoyed it.
Of course there is a seating upstairs and the area is congested and all which has been voiced quite a number of times by fellow reviewers on zomato.
I also remember my uncle having brought many kebabs from that place and I did like it a lot back then...It was when royal lebanese had just started.
Now the specific reason for this review is simple I was in the mood for some biryani today. I did not want to go far and I totally do not like the Zeeshaan Biryani or the Alibaba one and thus I was thinking of ta'am but then since I had a budget crunch I had to stay away from Ta'am because going to Ta'am and not ordering the Mutton Irani chaap alongside would be a shame. Thus was suddenly reminded of royal lebanese and the fact that they also serve biryani which is like applauded by fellow reviewers.
Now the biryani which I had was huge in quantity and was more than filling for 2 people. Now I do not know how they cook biryani in Arab but what the biryani was very very light and I thought it lacked the masala a bit. I also think there was a spelling mistake in the way Arab is spelt but that is fine I guess. The rice was not that good, the chicken pieces were pretty big and so was the aloo however the lacked any taste. What I like about biryani is that the aloo and the chicken takes the taste of the masala but that was definitely missing and I think the aloo was under cooked a bit too. It was as if the aloo and the chicken were cooked separately and put into the biryani.
However not very bad but then not at all comparable to the standards of arsalan, India, Royal, Ta'am, Southern Aminia or even Saima. If they work on it they may be able to do a lot better, I wish to have the Humus Naseeb and Pita bread though that is the last item left to try from this place.
OK I had to edit it some more as my mother just brought in The shawarma salad and I did not like it that much..I felt the mayo was too runny instead of the thick mayo at Go Lebanese and the chicken were too chewy and not juicy as it should be while my sister felt she could not find the taste of chicken clearly and we all agreed that the amount of veggies that go into this salad seemed less than the one at Go Lebanese. I for one definitely missed the olives....Thus dissatisfied again....As I said they need to work more on their cooking department cause they definitely have a very good location.

I couldn't enjoy the shawarma is my straight cut review. Their sauce tasted weird,not the yummy creamy thingie. Their hummus is okayish,bt a certain fish kebab (i can't recall the name ) was just a chunk of fish basted with mustard sauce,that tasted disastrous,at least to me. they claim to have an air conditioned seating arrangement but there are hardly 8 chairs there,the ceiling was just six feet above the floor(it struck my head) and has a pile of unused plates at one corner of the slab.
 I was not very happy with the experience!

To be honest, I tried shawarma after almost 2 years. The shawarmas u find abroad are actually far better but why am I comparing a street food in calcutta vs a street food in Toronto or Montreal. Why put mayo in shawarma when the actual sauce is totally different. The shawarma salad with the pita on side was ok. But the pita was more like maida ka roti but uncooked with dry maida sticking on fingers. Guys the location of your shop is great but please get an enclosure in front so that dirt doesn't stick to the chicken laid totally open on the polluted road. 
I've heard a lot about this new place in Hazra and will review it once I visit the place.

Loved the food. And I agree the Shawarma roll was impeccable to say the least. When I had gone there 2 weeks ago, it was 70 (The menu still shows 70), however, they increased the price to 80. But believe me, its still worth the price.

The kebabs were lip-smacking as well. Both Kay Kebab and Shish Kebab were simply awesome. But I didn't  like the Iranian Biriyani. A bit too bland for my taste.  

They have a nice location near Deshapriya park. They should be able to put up a decent place to sit soon enough. For now, they are more of a To-Go store, and the sitting place upstairs is just there for the sake of it.

I also tried Go Lebanese store just a few blocks away. They seem more crowded, but I agree with the previous comment, that Royal Lebanese is just more cheaper and tastier.

Recommended---YES
Will go again-- Definitiely.

EDIT III: Disappointed big time with this joint. I had visited about 2 weeks ago and ordered a full plate of grilled chicken. We marvelled at the 8 big, succulent chunks of chicken spilling from our plate (pic given). But when we visited today and ordered the same, the pieces were about half in mass. We ordered Shawarma rolls, only to be surprised again- gone are the big fat rolls stuffed with chicken and sauce. The rolls were skimpy and hardly contained more chicken than the regular paratha rolls you get at Arsalan or Only Alibaba. Sorry, I don't feel it is nearly worth the 100 charged. One of my friends ordered extra hummus with the grilled chicken and they served hardly two tablespoons of it, not at all justified at the hopping price of Rs.30. It's not as if hummus is made of some super exotic ingredient found in handful of stores- its just chickpea mash and sesame paste and maybe yoghurt. The difference between food served in the span of two weeks is too stark. Even the staff and service quality has gone down. When we visited the joint, they said the grilled chicken will be another half an hour. We came back after half an hour and they asked us to sit for yet another half an hour throughout which one of the staff members kept prompting us 'chicken would take too long' as though they wanted us to leave. I don't understand, is Royal Lebanese incapable of serving customers at 3 in the afternoon?

What happened? I don't recommend this place anymore. I love Lebanese food and I don't want to put off Lebanese food novices off by this food. After one and a half years (that's how long I have been a loyal customer at this place), I am going to go Shawarma hunting elsewhere.

________________________________________________________________________________
EDIT II: After they hitched their prices up, I have been there 3 times, and I must say, for once, I am all for price hike. The rolls are loaded with chicken and sauce and the waiter seemed very friendly these three times. Wish such improvement could be seen in the quantity of hummus as well.

________________________________________________________________________________
EDIT: I went back again a week ago and, on a whim, ordered the Chelo. I did not expect a dish like Peter Cat's, but what we did get was not expected at all because the picture on the menu is completely misleading. You don't get two sticks of kebab, but six individual slivers of weirdly shaped herb-and-mince-meat patty (which also had an unappetizing yellow colour, by the way). The portion of rice was disappointingly small too, not to mention it was the same rice served with the colourful Biriyani. When light-heartedly asked to be generous with the shawarma sauce, the waiter rudely replied pay 20 rupees for that.
________________________________________________________________________________

This place is an absolute delight for anyone who is sick and tired of the same old biriyani or what passes for Chinese in Kolkata. It's almost unbelievable that such an inexpensive restaurant is located in such a convenient place (just a few paces from Deshopriyo Park; you cannot get lost even if you try!).

I tried the chicken Arbi biriyani; it was lightly spiced and served with two chunky, succulent pieces of chicken. The Hummus and Pita dish had a generous portion of shredded rotisserie chicken. The hummus had a robust tang to it which I liked, but there's mixed opinion about this. For instance, my friend who had the same thing thought the hummus could be a bit more mellow. The Shawarma Roll is generously stuffed with chicken and bells peppers, and I liked the sauce too, even though it tasted more cheesy than the traditional tahini topping.

The place is tidy but a little cramped. But I guess I really can't complain after getting such good food at such a low price.

Lovely food! I bumped into this corner randomly & soon after having my first bite I realised what a wise decision I had taken. The Shwarma Roll was impeccable & way better than its competitor Go Lebanese (ps: cheaper! did I mention?!?).I found the food processing hygienic so one need not worry about that. Its cheap & very convenient for take away/delivery. I again look forward to dine here!

Being in the mood for a snack, I walked upto Royal Lebanese as people had been talking positively about this place. I ordered a chicken shawarma roll. Service was quick although the place is really tiny. But, unfortunately the food is not what I expected it to be. I've had much better shawarmas elsewhere. It had lots of mayonnaise in it, a bit too much for my liking. Its cheap, yes . I'd give this place another try sometime, till then it'll be just a 2.5.

i just came back from this place,and i have to say i am darn pissed.its a small place opp deshapriya park,specifically the old age kurry klub.its mainly for takeaway,upstairs they have tool for 8,so eating there is not a comfy business. we ordered arabi biryani,chelo kebab,grilled chicken and cold drink.the food is decent and the price rate is a breeze.they don't apply vat,and the grilled chicken was very tasty,a must try for you.but eating out,atleast when you are shelling out the dimes,is about the total experience and never on the food alone.we had ordered 3 biryani,and the grilled chicken regular which was priced at 110.the waiter had intimated  us that the day's poultry was a tad too large and they would serve a super jumbo portion at 140 instead,to which we had agreed.but when they gave the bill,they had charged for 4 biryanis and  rs 180 for the grilled chicken.with any hospitable place,they would have immediately rectified this mistake on their part.but here,they just kept arguing and it was a less than amicable settlement in the end.we came back with a bitter taste!

I really liked the Lebanese delicacies at Royal Lebanese!
4 out of 5

What I like about Lebanese cuisine is the freshness of the ingredients and the strong aroma of the herbs and spices that are used for seasoning food. For a long time, I have been looking for a popular food joint in Kolkata where I could get the same taste of authentic Lebanese cuisine as I had in a popular Lebanese restaurant in Turkey. I came across many restaurants serving lip smacking Chinese, Indian or Continental dishes, but could not find a single restaurant that solely specialized in Lebanese cuisine. It was only a few days back when I discovered a cosy, little Lebanese restaurant on Sarat Bose Road. Located just opposite Deshapriya Park, Royal Lebanese is one such restaurant in Kolkata where you get to eat lip smacking Lebanese food at very nominal rates (food for two costs Rs.200 approximately + tax)! 

Actually, I was walking on the road just opposite Deshapriya Park when my eyes suddenly fell on the restaurant's signboard. Totally exhausted after work, I decided to pacify my hungry gut that was already giving me signals that it wanted fooooood!  To be very frank I did not like their seating arrangement - the place is too cramped up and has only a few chairs and tables. It is not a perfect place to dine with family or group of friends, but I was alone and overlooked these issues. Once comfortably seated, I flipped the pages of their menu and finally settled for some Humus Nasseb & Pita Bread ( unique chicken preparation where juicy chicken chunks are served with Humus and Pita bread), Iranian Kay Kabab ( a delicious dish of marinated chunks of chicken breast , charcoal skewered and served with Pita bread and sauce), and chicken arbi biryani ( a tasty preparation of special rice, potato, carrot, 2 pieces of chicken seasoned with ghee and extra virgin olive oil and served with Irani raita.  

I must say that food was really good and I was reminded of the popular Lebanese restaurant I ate at in Istanbul while I was holidaying there. The use of olive oil, spices and herbs were in right proportions to tantalize my taste buds. After a sumptuous meal, I ordered some bajbouja (a scrumptious almond dessert prepared with semolina) which was delicious. Lebanese food is neither too spicy nor too oily, and you will surely like the rawness and freshness of the varied ingredients used for preparing Lebanese food. Just hit this place once and you'll know what I mean.

starting again with the good points . our area, that is deshapriya park now has 2 lebanese food stations. Being the new entrant this one currently offers lesser price and also has more generous chunks of meat etc. 
The bad part is there is no sitting arrangement . It is also ill managed and the guys running the show are many and often arguing with each other.
Hopefully in few months these issues will get resolved . oh,  by the way they charge around 40 rupees for home delivery.

As the second (newer) outlet that serves Lebanese food in that neighbourhood, Royal Lebanese sees brisk business. This eatery does have a small section for sitting and eating, but it is very cramped. There are a few chairs on the pavement where one can sit.

The food seems to be ordinary. The Chicken Shawarma Wrap has a fair amount of meat, but the sauce inside the wrap tasted a little dodgy. The waiting period for orders is quite high, and the pavement here is narrower, making it difficult for customers to stand and pedestrians to pass.

The cashier is polite and takes orders quickly, but the waiters who serve are sometimes brusque. Overall, not bad, but nothing fantastic either.

I really liked the Lebanese delicacies at Royal Lebanese!
4 out of 5

What I like about Lebanese cuisine is the freshness of the ingredients and the strong aroma of the herbs and spices that are used for seasoning food. For a long time, I have been looking for a popular food joint in Kolkata where I could get the same taste of authentic Lebanese cuisine as I had in a popular Lebanese restaurant in Turkey. I came across many restaurants serving lip smacking Chinese, Indian or Continental dishes, but could not find a single restaurant that solely specialized in Lebanese cuisine. It was only a few days back when I discovered a cosy, little Lebanese restaurant on Sarat Bose Road. Located just opposite Deshapriya Park, Royal Lebanese is one such restaurant in Kolkata where you get to eat lip smacking Lebanese food at very nominal rates (food for two costs Rs.200 approximately + tax)! 

Actually, I was walking on the road just opposite Deshapriya Park when my eyes suddenly fell on the restaurant's signboard. Totally exhausted after work, I decided to pacify my hungry gut that was already giving me signals that it wanted fooooood!  To be very frank I did not like their seating arrangement - the place is too cramped up and has only a few chairs and tables. It is not a perfect place to dine with family or group of friends, but I was alone and overlooked these issues. Once comfortably seated, I flipped the pages of their menu and finally settled for some Humus Nasseb & Pita Bread ( unique chicken preparation where juicy chicken chunks are served with Humus and Pita bread), Iranian Kay Kabab ( a delicious dish of marinated chunks of chicken breast , charcoal skewered and served with Pita bread and sauce), and chicken arbi biryani ( a tasty preparation of special rice, potato, carrot, 2 pieces of chicken seasoned with ghee and extra virgin olive oil and served with Irani raita.  

I must say that food was really good and I was reminded of the popular Lebanese restaurant I ate at in Istanbul while I was holidaying there. The use of olive oil, spices and herbs were in right proportions to tantalize my taste buds. After a sumptuous meal, I ordered some bajbouja (a scrumptious almond dessert prepared with semolina) which was delicious. Lebanese food is neither too spicy nor too oily, and you will surely like the rawness and freshness of the varied ingredients used for preparing Lebanese food. Just hit this place once and you'll know what I mean.

starting again with the good points . our area, that is deshapriya park now has 2 lebanese food stations. Being the new entrant this one currently offers lesser price and also has more generous chunks of meat etc. 
The bad part is there is no sitting arrangement . It is also ill managed and the guys running the show are many and often arguing with each other.
Hopefully in few months these issues will get resolved . oh,  by the way they charge around 40 rupees for home delivery.

As the second (newer) outlet that serves Lebanese food in that neighbourhood, Royal Lebanese sees brisk business. This eatery does have a small section for sitting and eating, but it is very cramped. There are a few chairs on the pavement where one can sit.

The food seems to be ordinary. The Chicken Shawarma Wrap has a fair amount of meat, but the sauce inside the wrap tasted a little dodgy. The waiting period for orders is quite high, and the pavement here is narrower, making it difficult for customers to stand and pedestrians to pass.

The cashier is polite and takes orders quickly, but the waiters who serve are sometimes brusque. Overall, not bad, but nothing fantastic either.

Some things I will never be able to understand in this life: why  roads in Cal have to be so congested, politics,  and baba ganoush /hummus.

Otherwise, everything is good and well with Lebanese preparations (however authentic they may be here) in Royal Lebanese.

I have tested Royal Lebanese takeaway service on 2 Sundays, and both times most interesting items were sold out/unavailable. Okay, leaves me some space for exploring.

I have had shawarma salad - my fav snack- and I must tell it was pretty nice. Loaded with sweet red and yellow capsicums, purple cabbage,  yummy sauce and chunks of juicy chicken, it really made my whole lunch. Then there were baba ganoush and hummus servings with soft white pita quarters (my son polished half of them with honey)....and last, but not the least,. their BIRYANI.

For me, it is awesome! Really, I  am not the type who would crave for dalda-potato-loaded Kolkata biryanis....but this was quite a revelation!! Burst of colors and flavors :  yellow, white and orange rice grains, orange carrot and green bean chunks, with no heavy fat and no egg/potato.... I just loved it and finally found the perfect biryani for myself! And the chicken pieces in the biryaini tasted just right.

Really nice place for takeaway, and indulging ur taste buds if you want a break from excess oil and masala. Wish they would deliver locally (but I am staying too far)

I was initially apprehensive ordering food from this restaurant having read a few reviews here. However I decided to give it a go. I ordered Grilled Chicken, Mutton Chello Kebab and Chicken Salona. The Grilled chicken was almost perfect...it was grilled to perfection but could've used a bit more sauce. The Chello kebab was a surprise. It isn't the Chelo we are used to in Peter Cat. The rice is a pilaff and is spiced instead of buttered. The minced mutton kebabs were excellent. I was satisfied overall with the Chello. The Chicken salona was a let down. The gravy they used tasted and smelled stale. I would however reserve further judgement till I try a few more items on their menu.

One of my fav places to have lebanese food. Love their falafel sandwich and chicken shawarma. Its a place where you will have to sit outside and eat. The seating arrangements upstairs is very less to the crowd they get. They should think of increasing the space to accomodate everyone. The food is awesome.

Small place by the road side, with excellent lebanese food. Love the veg salad and the falafel sandwich here. The food is always fresh, and the staff is very polite. 
However a shabby place to sit and eat, as the dining area is very small and claustrophobic.  The food is yummy and does not pinch your pocket much. An awesome place for a quick grab.

Excellent place for take aways.There is another joint called Go Lebanese a few metres away but Royal Lebanese wins hands down.The food is slightly better than Go Lebanese and the prices are lesser.I dont know why a couple of reviewers have said that Go Lebanese is cheaper.

The main difference between them is the behaviour of the staff.At Go Lebanese I have driven  in my car and have been treated very well,couple of weeks later i went their on my evening stroll and the owner behaved as if i was asking the food for free.

Anyways coming to the food,not much difference,the ex-Chef of Go Lebanese and his 2 helpers are the ones who opened Royal Lebanese.

The Shawarma of both places are almost the same,but Royal Lebanese is 70rs and Go Lebanese is 85.

The grilled chicken is better at the Royal Lebanese

Honey Boney Chicken is Good at Go Lebanese,but no idea if thats Lebanese.

Try the Arbi Biriyani at Royal Lebanese,mildly spiced,no use of Dalda and slight use of ghee plus the chicken is tender.They have added a piece of Potato to give it the Kolkata flavour.

The best dish though is the Shawarma Salad which is awesome.

Must visit this place once.

Well this place came up very near to the Best Lebanese place I had ever been to! And When I heard it has a dine in area I was extremely excited! With a lot of expectations I climbed up the staircase to my dismay! The so called seating are at first glance looked like a loo transformed into a dining area. Very cramped up, with a wash basin, and disposable plates stacked up in the corner. Extremely clumsy inside I must say! Not pleasant at all! 
However still keeping the spirits up I first ordered a Humus Nashib with Pita Bread. This was more or less nice to taste. Then I saw they have Chelo Kabab on their menu, so i ordered one. This if I may say so was terrible to say the least! I do not have any idea what they served up as Chicken kababs with rice, tasted suspiciously of rubber! Then finally I decided to order one Shawarma roll. Now it looked nice, but the mayonnaise they used tasted funny, not the normal yummy mayo you expect in a shawarma roll! 
Was extremely disappointed since just a few steps ahead was a place where I would get Lebanese food worth my money and time. And i suggest the same thing to everyone. Please walk ahead, go to Go lebanese, order and get a place to sit and eat! Better! :)

All young boys with uniform. not a good place to sit and eat but a very good food outlet for people to bring home food.  the menu given in zomato needs to be updated  since maghluba rice and semak wasn't available. instead we got chicken Iranian rice, which was sort of a modified special Indian biriyani. the shawarma roll was delicately made and was the awesomest  any type of roll I ever had. it was moist, juicy, melted in your mouth literally. a great array of awesome flavours exploded with a bang in the mouth. you must have atleast one in your life.  the employees were efficient and polite. the raita given with chicken Iranian rice  was also good.  intact shawarma is the best thing about this place. do stop by .

Excellent Middle Eastern food. I am a fan of their Chicken Lebanese salad which I order almost everytime I go. If I am feeling peckish, the chicken shwarma is my food of choice. 

Another factor in their favor is the warm welcome provided to their patrons. Previously, I used to go to Go Lebanese. But the manner in which its proprietor selectively treats its patrons disgusted me. The seemingly well off received better hospitality compared to customers who appear less prosperous. But, in Royal Lebanese, all customers are treated royally (pun intended).

It seems that my bosses have the best taste buds and perfect knowledge about the restaurant in and around the city- a big thank you to zomato.com (you have made dining easy). This was my second team lunch and we had ordered food from Royal Lebanese, Sarat Bose Road. I had the Paneer Shawarma Roll. Initally it seems to be over-priced but when you eat it, you feel the worth. The roll was awesome. They had been kind enough to stuff in lots of paneer and cheese. Its always good to eat good. It was the best roll I ever had and it was Zomato that helped me make the choice. I would love recommending this place to everyone and would definitely step in again whenever possible.

hate their grilled chicken.......so poor and salty that i left the entire food after having only 1 piece. the swarma salad is perhaps their best serving.. didnt like the mughluba rice..the served with the rice it not at all edible. most of the dishes are not available. service is very poor and unprofessional. but the only good thing about the place is that the salad is worth the money.

I come here for the Hummus Nasheeb with the Pita bread and the grilled chicken. The Shawarma, I feel, is not their best offering. That said, this place is pretty unpredictable, as the food here mostly get out of stock. However, full value for money, but more of a takeaway than a dine-in place.

update:Tried the Arbi Oil-free biryani. This was pretty bad. Dry, overly spiced, with a superficial potato thrown in. It was a truly weird combination which totally took away every bit of goodness from my heart about the place. I dont really care much for "diet stuff". What I do care about is the quality of food. This, sadly, stuck to my throat.

Placed strategically on the corner of Sarat Bose Road, a stone's throw away from Deshopriyo Park - Royal Lebanese is here to stay.

Starting off with the cornerstone of any Lebanese menu will be the Chicken Shawarma Roll. Priced at 70 Rs. only, it is a treat and quite a reasonably priced one as well. Both the Grilled Chicken and the Chello Kabab are brilliant and are worth tasting.

Special mention should be made of the Humus Naseeb and Pita Bread which is slowly increasing its 'fan-following'. One can always see a small crowd of people clamoring over the menu and the Shawarma Roll which just keeps on disappearing as soon as it is being made.

There is also a dine-in facility which is available above the kitchen below. 

The only disappointment is the orders taken on the telephone as well as the speed of the home delivery. Often times, orders placed on the phone are not prepared on time and one has to wait for quite a while during pickup. Home delivery, also, is a little late than expected.

FINAL VERDICT - Royal Lebanese is a good, solid small Lebanese joint that offers us a good variety of food and the quality is top notch. Highly recommended.

Loved the food.. specially shawarma salad.. chelo kabab could be more tasty specially the rice with it. Otherwise a pocket friendly Lebanese restaurant. They do take some time to deliver food  but the taste of the food makes you forget that.. hope they dont start rising the price suddenly that may affect it..

I simply love their food. After ages I had good Lebanese food. I still remember having  having Lebanese food in Dubai but this one in Kolkata did not fail to impress me. The shawarma is amazing and delicious and the roti just melts in your mouth. The grilled chicken too is very well made. The ambience seems very small and not very attractive but the awesome food attracts you there undoubtedly. 
In conclusion all of you must try the food and I'm sure you too will fall in love with the Lebanese food.

Was on an evening stroll, when i saw this joint with a large crowd in front of it. Its a newly opened food joint, serving good Arabian cuisine.
I tasted the shawarma roll and the chelo kebab. Both the dishes were amazingly tasty and also reasonably priced.
Go Lebanese is just a stone's throw distance away, but this joint has priced the shawarma at 70-, whereas the other charges 85-, and both are of the same standard. 
This is definetly a must visit place for all shawarma lovers.

I visited there recently. Its located beside Zeeshan at Deshapriya Park. 

I tasted the Chicken Shawarma Roll. I think that roll is actually chicken wrap..the shape is not so like a roll.....its simply mind-blowing,,,,Rs.70 is worth of it. I also tasted the Grilled Chicken.....its awesome too. Ambience is ordinary and apparently there is no  sitting arrangement.

 I would rate 4.0 for Royal Lebanese.
