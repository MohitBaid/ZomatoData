Looking for that perfect hideout to spend a warm and cozy winter evening? Fret not, Kaffiesta will have you sorted. Yet another feather in the cap for the ever growing Southern Avenue area, this beautiful little joint is just what you need to enjoy some heartfelt conversations over good food. The interiors look straight out of a magazine, with all those quirky poster sparkling on the glittery walls. It felt like we've stepped inside a fairyland, quite literally! The best part is that all of these have been done incredibly within a minimal space accommodated for hardly 15-18 people. Nevertheless, the good food and calm environment makes up for it. So, we tried few signatures from here :

Starter and sandwiches >>
‚ú≥ Grilled chicken Poutine (4/5)
‚ú≥ Grilled chicken Sandwich (4/5)

Pasta >>
‚ú≥ Primevera Pasta (4/5)

Steaks >>
‚ú≥ Chicken Steak in pepper sauce (4/5)
‚ú≥ Chicken Steak in mushroom sauce (4/5)

Burgers >>
‚ú≥ Kaffiesta Off-roads burger (3.5/5)
‚ú≥ Classic US hamburger (5/5)

Beverages >>
‚ú≥ Fresh Lime Soda (4/5)
‚ú≥ Chocolate shake (4/5)
‚ú≥ Strawberry shake (3/5)
‚ú≥ Butterscotch shake (3/5)

While I'm not much of a burger fan, the hamburger here managed to impress me quite well. The patty was juicy and the right amount of crispy with loads of mayo oozing out. Also, I liked how the staffs are attentive and always on the run to help you if need be. All in all, a great place to dig into lipsmacking yet affordable food in a peaceful ambience. Would surely visit again to try other dishes. ‚ù§

Kaffiesta Steak is the new kid in the block that has been the talk of town for quite sometime now. Located in the bylanes of Keyatala, this one is easily accessible from Vivekananda Park. It is a 16-18 seater restaurant. Though the space is cramped but the space management has been done very well. Simplistic yet catchy d√©cor with wall lights in form of coffee mugs and cool frames make the interiors look cosy and comfortable. Light music playing in the background sets up the mood quite nicely. 
Here are the dishes that we tried. 

üç∏Fresh Lime Soda: Refreshing

üçΩGrilled Chicken Poutine: French fries along with minced chicken tossed in tomato sauce and mayo on top. 

üçΩGrilled Chicken Sandwich: Very fulfilling and Tasty.

üçΩUS Hamburger: Came with a beef patty with vegetables with a sunny side up on top and loaded with mayo. 

üçΩKaffiesta Offroads burger: Chicken patty with tomato slices and sunny side up and oodles of mayo. Accompanied with French fries and dip. 

üçΩPrimevera Pasta- Penne Pasta with loads of Chicken. It was pretty good. 

üçΩChicken Steak in mushroom sauce: Served with mashed potatoes and saut√©ed vegetables, it was a bit salty but tasted great with the mashed potatoes. 

üçΩChicken Steak in pepper sauce- Served with herb rice and saut√©ed vegetables, I liked it a lot.

üç∏Chocolate Shake
üç∏Butterscotch Shake
üç∏Strawberry Shake

All in all a great place to visit especially if you are with your lover. Pretty sure the ambience will blow you over.

This is one thing place where we close eyes and reach out for pocket friendly yet high quality continental cuisine. Friendly service and warmth of decor deserves special mention. We have tried a lot of things from the menu. And nothing has ever disappointed us. Special mention should be made of chicken wings fried. And try the fondue for sure.

Situated in one of the bylanes of Keyatala road it is convenient to reach from Vivekananda Park side as well as Golpark side. A very small area beautifully utilised with a semi open kitchen view. Bright lights and vibrant colours. The water bottle are cute too with cool texts on them. The walls are filled with posters and frames. Comfortable seating arrangements and all in all a good ambience. We ordered

Fresh Lime Soda

Sandwich:

Grilled Chicken Sandwich

Pasta:

Primevera pasta

Steak

Chicken Steak in Mushroom sauce

Chicken Steak in Pepper sauce

Burger:¬† 

Kaffiesta off-road burger

Classic US Hamburger

Shakes:

Butterscotch shake

Chocolate shake

Strawberry shake

I loved their beautiful presentation of each dish. The service is pretty fast compared to the food that we got. Staff members are very courteous and did a splendid job in keeping up with our constant demands. Steaks were a bit salty and could be rectified from next time. The burgers and sandwiches we're great. We had some Wonderful shakes. Butterscotch shake was marvellous. Chocolate shake had the best presentation. I will definitely recommend this place to someone looking for a place to have steak in this area.

Food is top-notch, especially my beef tenderloin steak. If you are thinking steak, the name of Kaffiesta should be burning in your brain eyes in neon, cause this is the place to come and spend those green leaves! Also, try and devour the whole menu, cause that's my goal.

This cafe is a perfect place to spend a winter evening. It is beautifully decorated and is great for the ones who love clicking pictures a lot. Coming to the food we ordered tenderloin steak, mutton chapli burger, strawberry milkshake and chocolate fondue. The mutton chapli is my favorite among the ones I tried out. Simply in love with it. The steak is decent and the chocolate fondue is amazing. The strawberry shake was a bit too sweet but looks really nice. Overall a lovely place and will surely visit again.

After seeing the above 4 rating we decided to visit this place for dinner. It is a well decorated little cosy place with pretty lights and a diner kind of feel.
¬†
¬† We ordered two lime sodas and two main dishes according to the server's suggestion.
The dishes were Grilled Chicken Steak and Mexican Jerk Chicken Sizzler. Quantity was good. Served with veggies and mashed potato, the chicken in both the dishes were bland and over cooked.

I have tasted far better steaks in many places and this one really tasted funny. We told the server that it was okay, nothing 'out of the world' (which we expected because of the very high rating 4.4/5 at that time). The price was reasonable which was the best part!

Ambience - 4.5/5
Service-4/5
Food Quantity- 4/5
Food taste- 3.5/5 ( Rating according to what we had)
Location - 3.5/5 (A little inside in the lanes of Southern Avenue so we had to take an Uber)

We visited this place looking at the good reviews but it turned out to be nearly a nightmare. The service is slower than the cargo trains. After sitting for half an hour we were served the drink which was the only good thing about their menu...the cheese for the fondue was not hot at all. Then the bread for the burger was stale and the egg was tasteless...the chicken stake has cold vegetables while the pasta made us feel nauseous. We had no idea a place with such good ratings would serve such bad food. Never going to visit this place again.
In short terrible food even after waiting for an hour. I wish I could give a negative rating but that would also be high for this place....it's that bad.

Went to this place on 31st December .Was expecting it to be  crowded but the place was too small and can accommodate not more than 15 people at a time.
Service was okay .I ordered a Poutine and a couple of Steaks .The poutine was served pretty quickly but it took  them ages to serve the Steaks.
The Poutine was really good ,I would recommend people to try it ,and the Steaks were good too.We took a  chicken steak and a beef steak, both were good but the Poutine was really amazing .

'Kaffiesta Steaks' is the newest addition in the expanding foodscape of Southern Avenue. Located in the by lanes of Southern Avenue, this is a steakhouse which strives to provide quality food in a quirky atmosphere.

We went here at 6.30 p.m last week.¬† The restaurant lacks space. Only one or two tables can accommodate four people.The legroom is also minimal. The decorations were unique,quirky with hanging lights etc. Quotes of Joey Tribbiani and other characters were being kept as laminated pictures on the walls which had a brick sticker on them for a rugged feeling. Songs were played which made it an enjoyable atmosphere.

Coming to the food,we ordered:-
1)Non-Veg Cheese Fondue- Cheese Fondue is a delicacy which is served with molten cheese and French bread.We spear a French Bread piece into the molten cheese¬† and eat it. This concept becomes grander when you get you dip chicken and pork items into a pot of molten cheese. There were chicken and ham salami, livers, etc along with breads etc. This dish was a delectable one.

2)Kaffiesta Fried Chicken- This dish serves a battered chicken fry with French fires and mayo dip, The dish seems a bit overpriced however the chicken tasted really delicious.

The cons of this restaurant can be attributed to the space crunch and slow service. The food takes forever to come,the bill takes forever to come. The management should look into this.

All in all a good restaurant which can improve its services and I will visit again.

Well, I'm really at a loss for words. There is no complaint about the food. Let me be absolutely clear about that. But then, their customer service was a complete different proposition altogether.

We had been planning to visit this place for a very long time and finally did so on Christmas for dinner. First of all, it's a very small joint with a limited seating capacity and their biggest table could accomodate 4 only. We were 5 in number and had called them beforehand to enquire about table availability a couple of times and not once were we informed abt the limited seating capacity. We only found out abt that once we reached. Now, since Uber availability was poor, we decided to stick to Kaffiesta. When we enquired abt the table, we were informed that we would get a table in 2 minutes. And their 2 minutes turned out to be 30minutes long. Finally we were accommodated at a table and order was placed. We ordered a grilled chicken poutine for starters and for mains we ordered a grilled Bhetki sizzler and a grilled Prawn sizzler both with garlic butter sauce, a chicken steak sizzler for my younger son, a Kaffiesta Monsta Burger for my elder son and a Bengal Tiger sizzler for myself.
Here comes the twist in the tale. In the description of the burger, it was clearly mentioned that it's a double patty burger but when the burger arrived, it contained shredded grilled chicken. When we enquired about the discrepancy, the steward had no answer and informed the owner in the kitchen. By luck - good or bad i don't know - we were seated right in front of the kitchen and could clearly hear the owners' unwillingness to come out and answer our queries. Finally she came out and informed us that the burger doesn't come with a patty. When we pointed out the description given clearly in the menu card, we were informed that it was a printing mistake. Whew! A cafe running for over 3 months (I'm sure it's been longer than that), has not had the time to change their menu cards if there was a printing mistake??? I found that a bit strange. Finally the owner informed us that they don't have patty avbl at the moment and was wude enough to ask us if we want to have it or cancel it. We cancelled the order but what hurt pissed me off the most is the nonchalance of the owners at a kid going without food on Christmas night. Really really sloppy customer service. Oh! And we had thought of adding a Babughat Fish to our existing order but the steward returned from the kitchen informing us no more orders can be placed as the kitchen had closed down. That was another irritant for us coz no one even bothered informing us that the kitchen was closing down and no more orders wud b entertained.

Overall a very poor experience and doesnt deserve even the 2 that i gave them. Those are for the only saving grace, the food.

This place is a really small one located in one of the small lanes of Southern Avenue.

Ambience- well lit and coloured walls give a good cafe feel. The seats are quite comfy but appeared to be a bit cramped up since they had to accommodate as many chairs and tables in a small place. The staff are quite courteous.

Menu- the menu has all the typical items any cafe has to offer. The prices are reasonable.

Food and beverages- we took kaffiesta special schnitzel open burger and mutton chapli burger. For beverages I had something new called the Cinnamon cafe mocha and chocolate shake.
The burgers were good. ( don't be fooled by the term open burger, it's not something very innovative, they just don't put the topmost bread over the patty and leave it slanting from a side coz it will damage the sunny side egg kept at the top )..[ you cannot eat these burgers without being messy ]. 
The shake was good. The cafe mocha was a bit turn off. It's cinnamon flavour I get it,but it just didn't have the chocolate flavour a mocha is supposed to have.

Overall a moderate experience. Will recommend the place if anybody is nearby and want to drop in for a snack.

This is one of the best steak houses in Kolkata. Little difficult to find out (that might be a roadblock for their popularity) but follow your Gmap.

Interior design is catchy but their sitting arrangements are odd and they made it congested in order to arrange maximum seats. Staffs were courteous and helpful.

We visited on 24th Dec. They introduced few new dishes this Christmas and we were fortunate enough to try these. We started with cheese fondue as per their recommendation. It was filled with sausage, salami, kebab, prawn, strips, black olives, garlic bread and a bowl full of white sauce on top of an oven. This was the best one of the day. Then we took beef tenderloin steak & pork ribs sizzler. Beef was perfectly cooked very soft and tasty served with plain jeera rice & poached egg but the gravy we choose was of red wine and it appeared bland. Pork rib was not baby rib it was one large rib served with smashed potatoes tests pretty well.

We found this new gem on Zomato while hunting for a place which serves great steaks. A small place with about just 4-5 tables, tastefully decorated. We ordered pepper steak, roast beef, tenderloin steak, pork ribs and classic US hamburger. The food took a while to come as they have just one service staff (or must have been the case on that particular day). 
Coming to the food, it was absolutely divine. The tenderloin, the pork ribs so well cooked and packed with flavours. Honestly i wasnt expecting it to be this good. Cannot comment on the burger as i did not have it but my friend who did said it was brilliant. I am already looking forward to go to this place again and try the other dishes

Owing to a number of positive reveiws and feedback, decided to try this place out for Christmas Dinner.
The seating area is very small, with accomodation for 5-6 tables at best. As a result there was a bit of a queue on our arrival, and we had to wait for about half an hour to get our table.
Decor is nice and warm, and their playlist is also decent.
Now coming to the food, we ordered:

Raspberry Mojito: Decent Mojito, however no delectable taste of raspberries.

Spiced Coffee Mocha: I had expected this would be served at the beginning with the Mojito. But alas the drink didn't arrive even after we had finished our starter. So I cancelled it. Not great management.

Deep Fried Maccheesy: Not at all what the menu describes it to be. No jalapenos, hardly any cheese inside. These were basically macaroni pasta coated with crumbs and deep-fried. Hurt my pocket a little bit to be paying ‚Çπ150 for five tiny balls of these.

Cheese Fondue: This item was on their special's menu. As good as it looked, it was a joke in the name of a cheese fondue. The dipping bowl had anything but molten cheese in it. It tasted like a white pasta sauce, without any gooeyness of real cheese. I didn't pay my money to be served a bowl of white sauce, that too cold. Big disappointment.

Tenderloin Steak with Mushroom Sauce: Probably the only dish that tasted good and saved the rating from being even lower. Although the steak was cooked a bit too much for our liking (we had asked for medium-rare), it tasted good. The sauce was also decent.

Desserts: Unfortunately, they didn't have any dessert other than brownie and ice-cream. So we went without desserts.

Now coming to the management, it was really sloppy. We had to ask for the menu card to be brought to us, all the dishes took a lot of time to be served, and finally when we asked for the bill, I saw that they didn't even bill the Cheese Fondue. As much as I didn't want to pay for that pathetic excuse for a fondue, I still brought it to their notice and payed for it. Maybe the experience wasn't up to the mark since I was expecting way too much, or maybe it was due to the Christmas rush. Whatever it be, I'd still like to give this place a second chance to try out the famous burgers.

Christmas lunch at the place was a mixed experience. Long waiting time (more than an hour), as the place is too small and cosy and not properly managed. Slow and uncoordinated service (we ordered fresh lime soda salt, it came sweet).
In contrary the place is smartly decorated and looks pretty.
Now coming to the food.
Prawn in a blanket, as they call bacon wrapped prawns. It was 5 pieces of nice, juicy and succulent platter. Interesting and delicious mango salsa sauce which keeps you wanting for more.
Tenderloin steak: The mushroom sauce, nicely done mashed potatoes are the pros. Now coming to the cons the size of the steak was not worth the price, although they add shrimps and egg. It is small compared to all the steak houses I visited for the price listed Rs. 360/-.
Pork Ribs: Again lovely mashed potatoes but overly overdone ribs. The fat melted away. I love fatty ribs but it had all the fat washed off due to overcooking. I guess making pork ribs a sizzler was not a good idea at all. The sauce too was way too tangy for me. Not worth for money.
Had only one kind of dessert is another problem. The only silver lining is their prices are inclusive of taxes in this GST dominated society.
A more coordinated staff relation and better management would make it more welcoming for steak lovers like me.

Yet another solid addition to the forever expanding food scene in Southern Avenue, Kaffiesta is a small, colorful steakhouse that serves protein the way most of us like it the best : tasty, affordable and in generous quantity. Here's an account of how our recent visit unfolded.¬†¬†¬†

We are at first a bit shocked by how small the joint is, the place can barely accommodate 10-15 people at a time. The decor however is really eye catching and the low rise chairs with colorful cushions seem like they have been designed for a make believe toy world. We make ourselves comfortable in one such table and the service is prompt.

The beef bhuna that arrives first is nothing like how a bhuna should be. Tossed in ample bellpeppers and cooked in a light gravy, the dish is really tasty but confusion remains about the nomenclature. The mac n cheese crumb balls is crunchy with a really soft interior and melts in your mouth. The accompanying mayo dip turns out to be too sweet for my taste, however.

In between waiting for the mains I order a glass of hot chocolate. Others go for the butterscotch shake. The hot chocolate is comforting and the steak and ribs arrive sooner than later. The steak is medium well done and cooked in a red wine jus with a poached egg and shrimps as topping. One of the better steaks in town. The rib cooked in barbecue sauce is how it should be.¬†

The bill comes to around 1400 and we leave fairly satisfied and looking forward to our next visit.

Located at a walkable distance from Basanti Devi college,the restaurant is small yet well decorated and light up. It is presently decorated in Xmas theme with stars and bells all around.
We went in today evening and it was empty but soon it got filled.Saw a group of people celebrating their birthday,while they played happy birthday song for them! Certainly a good gesture from them.
We ordered-
Non Veg Fondue-This was simply amazing! Served with a bowl of cheese sauce bubbling over cute little candle and assortment of sausages,salami,garlic bread ,prawns and grilled chicken.
Kaffiesta fried chicken- well to be true I was disappointed at the size of the piece of chkn but when I tasted it was just an amazing piece of well marinated chicken.
Loved the feel of the place.
The service was slow.
Would visit again.
HappyEating!

The restaurant is small and cozy and beautifully decorated with small frames hanging on the wall and a other trinkets here and there.
I had gone with my friend and we ordered grilled chicken poutine and chicken pasta in arabiata sauce. The food was good. We ordered strawberry mojito and chocolate shake to go with our food. 
The food was good but the shake a bit disappointing. And they charged a bit more than what was written on the menu. 
The staff actually waited untill we finished our first dish so that we were immediately served with hot food after 
The service was good and the staff was polite.

Location- little hard to find but calm.
Ambience- comfortable.
Decor- minimal and Smart use of space.
Lighting- very good.
Food- totally average.
Price- okay.
Service- horrible. 
Washroom- really bad. I think it is for the workers of the building. 
We ordered 4 food items Chilli pork with rice, tenderloin steak, non veg cheese fondue, chocolate shake and butterscotch shake and butterscotch shake they ask us to wait for a while to wait for a while a while because the place was full ( it is a very small place. approximately 18 to 20 people can fit in.which is not an issue). I asked for the shakes first because that thing is easy to make and doesn't take a lot of of time, then we can wait for a while. It took 30 minutes to get the shakes taste was good. but the next dish took another 30 mins to come. After finishing that it again took 30minutes to get the steak(it was for my boyfriend as do not eat beef). After finishing that i was waiting for my meal i asked for it and realized they do not remember that i ordered the chill pork. I was so hungry and disguted. The dish took another 20minutes to come and i was not Happy with the quantity and the taste. It was too spicy just dipped in chili sauce. That forces me to think that To cover up for their mistake, they served the pork hastily. when i reached for the napkins i realized there were no napkin on my table. 
If a restaurant have sitting arrangement of 20 people that means they have the capacity to serve 20 people at a tym if not then...... Their quantity is very miniscule in contrast to the price.My lunch became afternoon snack. Never going back.

Definitely a meat lovers paradise! Kaffiesta Steaks have quite an impressive menu comprising of steaks,grilled meat,sausages and burgers as well!

Ordered pork sausages well cooked with bell peppers and onions.

Grilled chicken steak in choice of sauce, they give you 3 options, mushroom sauce,pepper sauce and red wine sauce; I chose pepper sauce which had a tangy taste. I loved this dish! ‚ù§

Next was dunken shank, which was lamb sizzler prepared in red wine sauce. This too was good!

Kaffiesta Steaks is a newly opened cafe that caters to an American culture of casual dining. There's a lot of interesting entries on the a la carte menu to order from. We ordered a few things that seemed to be gastronomically appealing. 
The cheese fondue (non veg) and tempura shrimps were really delightful as entrees.
We ordered Mexican jerk chicken in red wine Ju and in mushroom sauce as well as pork ribs for main course. 
And then their famed chocolate fondue for dessert.
The food served was very aesthetically pleasing but was not that good. And the service was very laid back. The effort to make it better was visible but it quite didn't pay off.

First the ambience is really nice but shortage of space. Behaviour of the staff is good. And the food we ordered Cucumber mojito, Orange mojito, Mexican Chicken Steak and Chicken Steak. I can just say one word awesome. Spices, combination of flavours, preparation is just perfect but bit time consuming preparation. As we know "Sabar ka phal mitha hota hai" so it's worthy.

This place is a small but well decorated place on Keyatala road that serves awesome American style dishes ! If you have a food list then this place deserves a place in the top 10 !
I started with the Strawberry Mojito which was really refreshing and the Spicy Chicken Wings which was sumptuous and juicy. Then the Minced Meat Poutine was melt in your mouth gorgeous with amply french fries and cheese to accompany it ! As they serve great burgers, I tried the Bacon and Shrimp burger was was really tasty and the Chicken Burger which was one of the best I‚Äôve had in Kolkata ! I also had the Orange Mojito to gobble all these dishes down which just had a subtle hint of orange and wasn‚Äôt overpowering ! At last I tried the Goan Prawn Curry with Rice Bowl from their new menu and it was the highlight of the meal for me ! It‚Äôs a must for anyone visiting them ! I would recommend this place to one and all and advise to go there early as the place gets filled up fast ! Enjoy !

This place is no less than meat paradise. If you're craving for real good stakes and magnificent burgers this is the place you should head to. Their burgers are absolutely humongous and very filling. The ambience and the interiors are absolutely splendid. The service is good too and staff is extremely generous. This 20-seater dine-in is a great place to fulfil your meat greed. Perfect place to fill your stomach & catch up with you small gang of buddies.

Coming to the food journey, starting with mocktails, we ordered for -Watermelon Mojito & Orange Mojito. Both the drinks were absolutely refreshing.
The food we ordered included - Spicy Chicken Wings, Minced Meat Poutine, Double Patty Burger, Spicy Shrimp & Bacon Burger, Goan Prawn Curry & Rice Bowl. All the portions were just great and the burgers were extremely juicy and delicious. This place lives upto it's name and honestly they're bound to make your stomach happy and glee with delicious food. Would love to visit again soon to try out more of their items on the menu. Would definitely recommend this place for all the hardcore meat lovers.

Yummy burgers, if you are a burger fan definitely visit, if not still visit. Located at P-464, Keyatala Road, Southern Avenue, Kolkata. Just beside Wendy's Saloon and Spa.¬†

The food here is awesome, reasonable and filling. They were so flavorful and juicy that after a while I just stopped trying to wipe my face clean and dug in. My all time favorites are the Spicy Chicken Wings, Spicy Shrimps and Chicken Burger. Spicy Shrimps is always cooked to perfection and Spicy Chicken Wings are nice and tender and a joy to eat. The wings definitely are worth a try once. Definitely a mention to the Chicken Burger as that is one thing a foodie out there cannot miss. The mocktails - Orange and Strawberry Mojito were good too. Nothing will disappoint you. I promise. It's just beyond great. Would definitely go there again and again. Whole heartedly recommend the place. <3

This place is definately a meat-lovers paradise. Located in one of the by-lanes of Keyatala, this place serves some awesome burgers, fondue,stakes and other dishes as well. The things we had:
Kaffiesta Orange Mojito-loved it. Very refreshing.
Kaffiesta Strawberry Mojito- flavours were beautifully balanced.
Spicy Chicken Wings- crispy fried wings. They were tender and juicy. Totally loved it. Highly recommended.
Minced Meat Poutine- french fries topped with minced mutton and sauces. The fries were crispy and the gravy from the minced mutton was yumm.
Spicy Shrimp Bacon Slider- Burger incorporating prawns and bacon slices. Its tasted heavenly. Recommended
Chicken Burger- the patty was beautifully cooked. It was quite filling. Enough to satisy one's hungry soul.
goan prawn curry with rice bowl- i simply loved this one. The coconut gravy prawn and the herbed rice was a match made in heaven combination. Highly Recommended.
I absolutely loved this place. Will visit again to try their fondues and steaks.

This place is amazing! They've got almost everything correct :
Ambiance ‚úî
Location ‚úî
Food ‚úî‚úî
Okay so the decoration is on point, quality of music can improve though (not really spacious either) but it's still a good little place to hang out nonetheless.
Now coming to the food :
Bade Mian (with beef) as starter
Non-veg Fondue
Pork Ribs (sizzler)
Tenderloin Steak (with mashed potatoes and mushroom sauce)
Strawberry and Mango Shake
We ordered a lot and boy o boy, weren't they good! The beef in bade mian was tender and tasted really nice, non-veg fondue was one of those rare dishes which looks good and tastes even better, pork ribs was as expected : sizzling, soft and delicious in the mouth, tenderloin steak was again amazing even though it came to tired tastebuds. This place never ceases to amaze you. Finally came the smoothies, and this is where looks can be deceiving, the shakes looked nothing like the ones that was shown in the menu, tasted average, nothing great about it!
I would have given it a full 5stars given how impressed I was but the lack of a proper washroom, not enough room for a large group and the fact that cocktails weren't available, held me back! Anyways definitely worth a second visit.

Ordered Chicken Steak, BBQ Prawn & Deep fried fish fillet. All are served with Jeera Rice & boiled Veg. All are right cooked and tasty. Portion are good enough for one person. I would like to suggest, people should have option to order mashed potatoes or fries instead of Jeera Rice.

Awesome decor and ambiece, just in one word beautiful. Coming to the food we both tried beef steak medium rare it was awesome soft juicy from inside properly grilled from outside though the sauteed veggies have scope for improvement. This place is new lets not be critical on petty issues, service was good too but i just love their chocolate fondue it was very innovative served with fruits, peanut butter and one scoop of vanilla icecream just must try.
Scoop of improvement is working on fast service and accompaniments they give with steaks. Wish them all the best.

A thought: Fundamentally, all restaurants need to ask themselves a basic question:¬†do they want to be taken seriously with what they serve? Or should we not read too much into it?¬† Why so?

It's because, if you review Housefull or Golmaal Returns with a lens of Kapoor and Sons or to make it starker, Death in the Gunj, its a tad unfair to the restaurant. So for restaurants, who want you to enjoy a casual meal/snack should defer from calling themselves as experts, or specialists, it kind of changes the lens. So my take on KS is based on it being a casual food joint and not a specialty place.

~ Side note ~

There are all types of people who enjoy food "made their way", like adding chili powder to Stroganoff to make it spicier!¬† Like removing fat from Pork Chops, or adding tomato ketchup to a¬† quarter rack, or asking a Hyderabadi Biriyani to be less spicy!

What many do not realize, there is a definition, of how an item is to be made, and sticking to it, often requires you to develop a palate for it. But, in the age of instant gratification, most restaurants "fine tune" to suit their larger audiences.¬†

This 'adjustment' makes them believe they will get more footfalls. But what happens is they become more like the others, the wannashines!¬† They lose the authenticity for which someone would ve paid a premium.¬† For the rest, their 'creative liberties' are tagged under fusion food.

Eventually, they fade away, for being ordinary. There are fewer restaurants which cross the 5-year mark of its existence because breaking-even is a long-term event in the hospitality segment and is based on authenticity not compromise.

~ Back to review ~

Ambience :

The place is brightly designed, with quotes from Kafka (?) to mugs with bright LED's concealed on the walls. Someone's cozy corner is somebody's cramped seating, depending on what stage your relationship is, so make your own assessment. The music is mostly upbeat discotheque chartbusters and the hygiene is quite decent.

Menu : 

We ordered Chicken Caesar Salad, Grilled Bhetki, Drunken Shank and Tiramisu.

What works : 

The plating was quite impressive, the staff is courteous and reasonably well informed about the menu. The cutlery was new and proper, like the steak knife was particularly impressive. Some of the ingredients were of good quality like the iceberg lettuce was fresh, the chicken chunks were good, the white sauce in the grilled Bhetki was nicely done with no residual smell of other oils.¬†

Clearly, this is not a sufficient data set to comment on the entire menu, so I will restrict it only the items I have savored. The gravy in the lamb shank was cooked well, vegetables and mashed potatoes were evenly cooked.

What could've have been better :

Lamb Shanks need to have meat fall off the bone, not wrestle to whittle out a morsel. It can't be a¬† "mangsho¬†Jhol er piece " ( a.k.a railway mutton curry) served on a sizzler plate. There were next little veges, one tiny baby corn, a couple of carrots and poor quality cabbage leaf at the base. The meat was tough and chewy and unevenly cooked.

The Beckti, oops Bhetki, was a thin slice, with not adequate fish meat. Typically, 1 Kg Bhetki would cost around INR 876, their dish is priced at INR 340. Now I understand they could get a more expensive cut, add overheads etc, but I wouldn't be convinced of a 50g-70gm piece being priced at 340 bucks.

See for me, 340, raises expectations. Likewise charging 150 bucks for a portion of garlic bread, is not smart pricing for the restaurant its cadre.

The Tiramisu was mostly a chocolate mousse, high on cocoa low on Mascarpone, and very little balance of coffee to give us a complete finish. No¬†two ounces of dark rum, or Kahlua to leave a memory on your palate.

Anecdotes :¬†¬†

But, like I said before, If I take off my 'specialty lens', then none of the above matters really. If you couldn't care less about these fine-tuning aspects, then I guess you would rate it more than 4 stars if not 5. And I won't judge you for that, because to each his own, I respect what you like, even though I may not agree with it.

Overall:¬† ¬†it does warrant a¬† revisit, try a few other items to either confirm my insight or change it, which looks unlikely, but am always open to stand corrected. I would recommend you try for sure, especially if you appreciate Italian or American fast food, but do remember to wear the right lens to set expectations correctly.

amazing place and the food is to die for, totally fond of thier cheese fondue and steaks, we had a big birthday lunch there and the price is quite less compare to any restaurants, a plate of steak with mashed potato/ rice, veggies costs only rs 280/-, beef/ chicken stragonoff was so creamy served with rice for only Rs 280/-. Just loved their tempura shrimps, gamberoni di olio prawns in creamy sauce, This place is loaded with fish items, lamb, beef, pork and chicken, so guys try your hand on this place am sure you will not be disappointed.

amazing decor though small, beautifully lit and liked the colourful cushions. Food is too good, from nonveg fondue, tenderloin steak in mushroom sauce, it was so creamy with mushrooms on the top made it just perfect that too at a price of 280 is pretty reasonable. Nonveg fondue was like a meat bonanza but only chicken and two pieces of prawn. Heard their pork ribs is also very good, will try next time.

My family had gone to celebrate my bil's birthday here. We all love the food! We all agreed Kaffiesta Steak cooked the best steak in town after trying steaks from different places. We ordered a variety of different dishes n none of them disappointed us. 

We ate Spicy Chicken wings(the wings are huge), Stuff Potatoes(non-veg), Deep Fried Maccheesey, Prawn in Blanket, Steak Tenderloin, Kaffiester Offroader Burger, Pepper Steak, Classic US Burger, Chicken Steak Sizzler. 

The ambiance is really warm although the place is small. The staffs are really attentive and friendly. The price of the dishes are all really reasonable. Will be recommending Kaffiesta to all our friends who love a good, tender and juicy STEAK!

This is a new place for all meat lovers in the city. I was here yesterday with my friends for dinner. Located near Keyatala Road, the place though small, looks elegant with the modern decor. 

 The dishes which I tried here are. 

‚Ä¢ Banana Smoothie - The smoothie was consistent and tasted good. It was further topped with cream and banana slices. 

‚Ä¢ Orange Mojito - This was chilled and refreshing. The flavour of orange was quite good. 

‚Ä¢ Non Veg Fondue - A variety of grilled meat, which included shrimps, spicy chicken, salami, sausages, etc were served with a bowl of molten cheese. The meat tasted heavenly with the hot and molten cheese. 

‚Ä¢ Beef Bhuna - This was a semi-gravy and mild spicy preparation where beef chunks were tossed with onion, garlic, bell peppers and spices. It tasted quite good. The beef was soft and tender. 

‚Ä¢ Bademian Chicken - Grilled chicken cubes with onion and bell peppers were served in a hanging skewer. The chicken was well cooked. 

‚Ä¢ Beef Burger - A juicy beef patty was stuffed between breads, along with cheese, lettuce and a fried egg. It was juicy and tasted beautiful. 

‚Ä¢ Grilled Seabass - A soft and delicate basa fillet was drizzled with a creamy rice and served with rice/ mashed potato and grilled veggies. I loved the texture of the fish. 

‚Ä¢ Chocolate Fondue - A bowl of warm molten chocolate can anytime make my day and yesterday wasn't an exception. It was served with chopped fruits ( banana, kiwi and apple ), vanilla ice cream and peanut butter. 

Overall, it was a great experience with some amazing food. The fondues and the burgers are a must try.

Located in a small lane of keyatala road, near Vivekanda park , this cafe is quite popular for its steaks and burgers. The interiors are well lit ,and if you are selfie addict ,this place boasts of enough light for good pictures. So visited this cafe and here is

Visited this cute little cafe yesterday. Had heard about this place for quite some time. Was very satisfied with their food and service. The ambience is very peppy and something I liked quite a lot. 

Coming to the food directly.

We had ordered a number of drinks which included Raspberry mojito, Orange Mojito, Cucumber Mint mojito, Strawberry milkshake and Banana milkshake.

For starters we had Bade Miyaan Chicken which was basically soft and juicy chicken kebabs, Non Veg Fondue which was love. Next up was Tempura Prawns which was crispy and flavourful. Lastly we opted for the Beef Bhuna which was sheer beauty. 

For mains we went with their signature Beef Burger which had a juicy patty and was topped with a sunny side up! Next we had the Chicken Stroganoff which was great to say the least. The herb rice tasted just right. And finally we gave their Grilled Sea Bass a try for which I'm thankful. The creamy succulent fish served with herb rice can win everybody's heart. 

We ended our food fiesta with their much talked about Chocolate Fondue. Looked damn appealing. If you're a chocoholic, you should definitely go for this one. 

Overall I loved this really small and cosy cafe. Their menu is perfect for every meat lover. However, their service is a tad bit slow, but the amazing food totally makes up for it.

4.2 rating on Zomato and the wonderful reviews on this eatery drove my expectation to the stars. 
The place is really small with quirky interiors. Coming to the food, we ordered a BEEF BHUNA which was served to us in less than 5 mins and was delicious.
Next up, we ordered 3 steaks(tenderloin in pepper sauce, grilled chicken in mushroom sauce and steak and the city in red wine sauce) and 2 coffee( one regular, one with caramel). 
To our surprise, these orders took more than 35 mins.
Not just that but they messed up the steak which was supposed to be in mushroom sauce and made it in pepper sauce.
On rectifying them, the waiter said he'll change it. And guess what? The new steak came in 10 secs.
How? They just replaced the sauce. Is this what I'll pay 280+ tax for? Absolutely NOT. In the picture below, this fact can clearly be seen. The pepper sauce was floating below the grilled chicken.
The waiter however denied this fact and said it was "jus". They later owned up and wanted to replace the steak to which we denied as we were too full. They requested to give us a complimentary brownie.
So sweet of them? NO. THE BROWNIE HAD AN INSECT IN IT. IS THIS HOW YOU MAKE UP FOR YOUR MISTAKE? Utterly disgusted, we showed it to them and asked for the bill.
No discount whatsoever was levied. 
Also, their main priority was the group of food bloggers who had come. They just made us feel as if we were eating for free?! 
Highly disappointed. Never visiting this place ever.

This place is extremely over hyped I don't know for what. The service staff is not at all equipped and has no idea about the menu. The service is also absolutely unworthy. Takes a lifetime to respond to a guest call, leave alone the order. 
We had ordered a particular steak with a sauce and the wrong sauce was served to which the waiter argued saying it was the jus of the meat! We are from catering colleges and have freshly come out of 5 star properties, so we are not this cheaply fooled. 
Nevertheless, accepting their mistake they wanted to replace the dish which we didn't want to. So they gave a complimentary brownie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I appreciate this gesture, but, JUST THE GESTURE. That ice cream had a God damn insect stuck to it. We paid a bill of Rs. 1340 and not a penny was worth it. The food is a 4/10 and the service is not worth getting marked. A horrible experience.

My order was delayed by 40 min just because they were busy serving food bloggers. My mushroom sauce was mixed up with pepper sauce and when confronted the waiter denied and told us it was the juices from the chicken. When they realised their mistake they offered us a brownie but again served with a dead insect on it. We told them about it and they said it must have landed now. The food was cold and I am utterly disappointed.

5 minutes walk from Hindustan Park, located amidst a cluster of cafes at Southern Avenue, this small eatery is serving good food at very reasonable prices.
Their mocktails are refreshing, starters are mouth watering. Main course portion size might disappoint you a bit but considering the prices, I wouldn't complain.
Must Orders -
Raspberry Mojito
Tempura Prawn
Grilled Chicken Burger
Chocolate Fondue

Though the staff is courteous, still there's room for improvement in the service.

Recommended for the good food at pocket friendly price.

This area in and around Keyatala has some of the best cafes and restaurants in town now. And it's amazing that all of them are equally good.

Kaffiesta is small-ish; they can probably seat 16-17 people at a time. Even the washroom is out back.
They have this red-brick wall with framed food quotes. And another white wall with colourful coffee mugs dug into them. Neat.

We ordered a Banana Milkshake first and then Tempura Prawn and a plate of Beef Bhuna. The bhuna was so perfectly cooked, it's as good as what you get in those small shops in the bylanes of Park Circus.
The prawn too, very soft. Keep the dip, it goes with most other items.

Next, we ordered a Classic US Hamburger and Chicken Stroganoff. You have to be a little careful with the hamburger, there's a lot of things apart from the poached egg and it's slippery and gets messy real quick. But the taste makes up for all of that. They take their own sweet time to cook the patty, but it's worth every bit of the wait.

The Stroganoff was the best of the lot. Just the right amount of sour cream.

Oh and we also ordered a Chocolate Fondue. Usual.

Overall, recommended. I'll revisit soon.

This place has been on my bucket list for a long time and i finally managed to tick it off today. Located in one of the busy Lanes of southern avenue, if you aren't acquainted with the area, GPS does a tremendous job in leading you to this place. 

The place is not that spacious but the food definitely packs a solid punch and the prices are extremely reasonable and competitive. The interiors and the decor of this place is quite pretty and visually attractive and the manager is extremely friendly. 
The beverages that we ordered were quite refreshing, well presented and quite delectable! 

-- The rasberry mojito is something which i would suggest. I really loved it and it was quite well prepared. 

--  The banana milkshake was quite crafty and visually appealing. Extremely user friendly too! 

-- The strawberry milkshake had the right amount of ingredients to make it shine amount the rest. 
-- The basil cucumber mojito was good too. 

Now coming to the food, it was pretty good and definitely worth the money. 
-- The non veg fondue would be the ideal chicken lover's paradise! The presentation of this dish was commendable. 

-- the bademian chicken is basically your chicken skewer's and it comes in the form of five succulent pieces of chicken. 
-- You should definitely try their Burger's. I had the grilled chicken burger and it was a classic! Unparalleled in taste! 

-- The chicken stroganoff was extremely filling and loaded with chicken. One portion is more than enough for two.

-- Steaks are their speciality and the chicken steak spoke volumes of the quality of this place. 
-- The chocolate fondue is a must try if you are dining at this place. 
I really enjoyed my visit to this place. The menu is quite elaborate and i would definitely try their other dishes in my next visit.

A lively little room full of vibrancy and aroma. 
We ordered for a variety of mocktails, like orange and raspberry mojito, banana milkshake, strawberry milkshake and cucumber mojito.
For starters tastes the chicken bademiyan, basically chicken skewers with garlic bread. Lovely combo though. Also the non veg fondue is a must try. Portion is pretty lot, to suffice 3 . 
Tempura prawns were my favourite. Crispy and fresh prawns served with a sweet sauce. 
For the main course we ordered for chicken stroganoff, chicken steak in red wine jus sauce , fish steak, chicken burger and the open pork burger. All were pretty standard and tasted great. 
Dessert included the much popular chocolate fondue which came along with fresh bananas, strawberry, kiwis and apples. A perfect endingüòç

This is a cute, little place right beside Vivekananda Park, Southern Avenue. Done up in white and orange, the decor exudes warmth. You're welcomed with broad smiles too.
Coming to the topic of food now-
We were a big bunch and we tried their recommended dishes. In starters we had :
Bademiyan Chicken- chicken in skewers which was quite well made
Non-veg Fondue- it had chicken and shrimps in cheese fondue
Beef bhuna- was quite juicy, spicy and well made.
In drinks and shakes we had Strawberry and Banana milkshakes - these were delicious - and Basil Cucumber Mojito and Orange mojito. Both were refreshing, especially the orange and cucumber mojitos.
For the main course there was Classic US Hamburger and Chicken steak. All the main dishes were delectable. The chicken steak was cooked to perfection.
Lastly, we had Chocolate Fondue with sliced strawberries, bananas and apples.
Overall my experience here was great. This is a great place for a date or get-together with your friends group. Good food and efficient service are the high points here.

Kaffiesta Steaks is tucked in a quaint by-lane of Purna Das Road. Right on entering this place you will be embraced by the warmth of the mellow lighting, and the little wooden chairs and tables.
Now, coming to the food.
Me and my friends decided to indulge ourselves with the starters and drinks mainly. So, we ordered the strawberry shake, raspberry mojito, orange mojito, beef bhuna, cheese Fondue and tempura prawns. For mains, we only had space in our tummy for one burger and a grilled sea-bass. For dessert we indulged ourselves with the chocolate fondue.

The taste and presentation of each and every dish was spot-on. The shake was thick with dollops of whipped cream. Both the mojitos refreshed the palate with its lemon and mint infused goodness. I personally liked the raspberry one more than the orange variant.
Among the plethora of starters we ordered, my favourite was the beef bhuna. The strips of tender beef swimming in a spicy gravy was amazing. The cheese Fondue was an elaborate affair with an array of cold cuts and bread waiting to be dipped into the ooey-gooey cheesy goodness. The tempura prawns too were fried to golden perfection and served with a deliciously creamy tartar sauce.
The burger is one of the best I've had in the city. There were sizable chunks of juicy chicken, thick strips of fatty bacon, and a perfectly fried egg enclosed between two sesame buns. It was difficult to finish even though we were sharing a single burger between two people. The grilled sea-bass comprised of a delicately cooked fillet of fish in a white sauce served with mash and steamed veggies. Though the fish tasted good, the sauce was under-seasoned.
The dessert was a decadent affair with simmering chocolate in a fondue bowl, surrounded by little treats like strawberries, kiwis, bananas, vanilla ice-cream and a dollop of peanut butter.
I would totally suggest these place to everyone out there. It has the potential to blow your minds.

FOOD: 4.5/5

I had already checked the reviews and the pictures, so this place was on my list as soon as I got back to kolkata. Though the restaurant is pretty small, it's lively lighting, it's well thought out decor, gives you pretty good vibes. We ordered tenderloin steak with herb rice and extra veggies and drunken shank with herb rice. The waiter was quite courteous. Coming to the food, the tenderloin steak done medium rare, had just the right amount of tenderness. But the limelight was definitely on the drunken shank. Its presentation to its flavours everything was on point. The lamb just melts in your mouth and keeps you admiring its softness and its flavours for the next few seconds. I have never been a mutton or a lamb person, but this place has definitely made me one. This place is a must visit for steak and sizzler lovers and DO TRY THE DRUNKEN SHANK!!!!

This is a casual dining restaurant which serves a wide range of American and Italian dishes. The place is small but the decor is beautiful with paintings, wall hangings, hanging lights and wall textures. I went with my friends for some evening snacks. 
We ordered :
1. Non veg fondue - this is a platter with chicken, pork sausages, the cheese with the meal balls taste amazing. 
2. Bruschetta - I love bruschettas. The mushrooms and the crispness made it even better. 
3. Tenderloin steak - steaks are love, that too beef steak. It is served with veggies, the tender beef steak was great to taste. 
4. Pork ribs - this had perfectly cooked pork ribs, juicy and tastier than ever. 
5. Tough guy fillet burger ( beef) - soft and chewy beef with cheese and veggies and French fries were heavenly.
6. Seafood risotto - the risotto was really good in taste, it has chicken and prawn pieces, a cheesy affair. 
7. Chocolate mousse - this is creamy and chocolatey and you will fall in love with it.
8.  Brownie and icecream- this is my favourite dessert and the brownies were very soft. The hot brownies and vanilla ice cream stole my heart.

This is the new kid in the block, just in the lane beside Mrs. Magpie. I have been longing for a good steak house in Kolkata, and my experiences with the present ones have been bad to moderate, but mostly never good. But, this place is sure to set things changing! I have been here a couple of times, but some dishes already are calling me back!

1. Non-veg Cheese Fondue : A platter full of meat with a cheese dip. Tell me, can you resist the temptation? Sausages, shrimps, chicken, garlic bread with a thick, creamy cheese - it ticks off all the right boxes.

2. Tenderloin Steak : Medium rare, choose your sauce : Red Wine, Pepper, Black Bean, and I would say none of them will disappoint you.

3. Beef Stroganoff : Again, one of the better dishes. Not quite the creamy stroganoff you would want, but the taste is unique and delicious!

Cons: Pork Ribs, Mexican Jerk Grilled Chicken, and Seafood Risotto didn't impress me much and also there are hardly any options for desserts. 

However, I believe the joint is pretty promising, and their steaks are definitely one of the better ones!

Order a Greek salad, beef tenderloin with red wine sauce and grilled chicken steak with mushrooms.

Greek salad- Very average and really had no Greek taste to it what so ever. Very small serving.

Beef tenderloin- Was okay but nothing to rave over. Mashed potato was very bland. 

Chicken steak- Was by far the nicest thing but also like the beef very small portion.

Sauces- Both just tasted like thyme, Big over kill. 

Service- Was ok until I tried to give some feed back about the sauces tasting only of thyme. The waiter did not except or want to take any feedback. 

Over all- Would not recommend.

Ah-may-zing. This quaint little eatery is a hidden gem. It had been on my wishlist, and today I decided to pay this place a visit.

Decor: The decor is snazzy, typical of a pub, striking the right balance between stylish and cozy. It's well-lit, and the warm light is perfect for taking photos. Shutterbugs won't be disappointed with this place. A playlist of a mixed bag of songs is played in the background, and its volume is well-calibrated so that it doesn't feel intrusive.

Food: We ordered Poutine with grilled chicken, one tenderloin steak, and one chicken steak, both with pepper sauce and potato mash. For drinks, we had Strawberry mojito and Cucumber mojito.

The poutine comes in ample portion for two. It comes with hot mayo, salsa (actually, pico de gallo), and sour cream. Loved the hot mayo, as I personally dislike the slight heaviness of the sour cream. However, the sour cream they serve is quite light. The fries were fried perfectly, being crispy without being oily. In fact, I was a bit surprised to see the french fry to be so crispy without being oily. Pair that with the grilled chicken, the olives, the salsa, and the spicy mayo, and you have a definite winner.

Then came the steaks. They were perfectly cooked, with mashed potato and veggies on the side. Now, the steak and the pepper sauce was spot on. But most eateries worth their salt can serve a properly done steak with a delectable sauce. What sets Kaffiesta Steaks apart is that they have paired it with extremely well-seasoned veggies. Because, I've had steaks at many a joint, but most provide blandly seasoned boiled veggies. But, this place shines there. They have served an extremely tender and perfectly-cooked steak with a sauce that will tantalize your taste buds, and have paired it beautifully seasoned veggies and mashed potato. I couldn't figure out what it was, but it was probably a hint of toasted parsley leaves that made that butter-smooth potato mash heavenly.

As for the drinks, I was glad to see that the strawberry mojito didn't have that typical cough-syrupy taste. But, have that with your starters. Its sweet flavour doesn't go well with steaks. The cucumber mojito, on the other hand, provides a cool relief to your palate and goes hand in hand with the steaks.

We wanted to have dessert, but were way too full after the main course.

Service: The person who took our order was extremely well-versed with the menu. In fact, we were ordering for well-done beef steak when he suggested that we should go for medium rare, because well-done steak would be a bit stiff. And he was exactly right. The medium rare steak was soft without being chewy or raw.  The service was quick, and is plenty fast than some other eateries of same stature.

Pocket-pinch: The bill came to within Rs. 1200, which is well reasonable.

Final words: With good food, admirable decor and laudable service, Kaffiesta Steaks has ticked all the boxes. The only thing that might be going against it is its location. It's just a few minutes' walk from Filler's or Wise Owl or Mrs. Magpie. Once you visit this place, it becomes all too easy to spot its location the next time. But for the first time visitors, this might be a little bit tricky to spot. Also, inclusion of a few more items on the menu would be a welcome change. I do wish this joint a very bright future, because, truly, they deserve it. For me, it's a visit-again spot.

I am die hard fan of steaks so tried this new place, its quite crowded as we reached on friday evening, took the table jus beside the cup light fitted wall it is very pretty indeed my friend just loved it. 
Food-related we ordered Tenderlion it was seriously tender tenderloin perfectly presented with mashed potato and portion of sauteed vegetables. 
pork chops-They dont have ribs but have pork chops,  no fat at all very succulent well cooked served with  herb rice and their inhouse bbq sauce, bbq sauce was swt and tangy, it was good. They might improve more with time.
Grilled chicken steak - it was good too, good portion for one.
Bill came to around 1100 with drinks which is pretty cheap compare to the food we had.. Hope they take a little bigger place and maintain the standard.

chocolate shake was simple but tasty, presented with whipped cream and nuts on the top. 
Dessert-Try the tiramisu it just melts on your mouth.
price is cheap and affordable.

Ordered for chicken and tenderloin steak burgers. Along with Mac cheese balls. The crumb fried chicken burger was not crunchy. Only one part was covered with batter. Rest just tasted like boiled chicken. There was no seasoning. Neither on the egg nor in the patty. The bread did not taste fresh. Must have been sourced from the local lake market stalls. 
The tenderloin again had no seasoning. The burgers just didn't have any salt. Period. 
Apparently the burgers were supposed to have cheese. Couldn't taste any. 
The maccheese was an absolute disaster. No taste no cheese. Had to throw. French fries were cold and limp. Obviously was not freshly fried. It seemed the chicken and tenderloin was just boiled in.the morning or maybe even yesterday, and hurriedly put in between buns. 
Terrible is an understatement. I am still trying to figure out what I ate!

located near fillers 3 minute walk just enter the lane of fillers and take first left come straight on your right side you can spot kaffiesta steaks and if you are coming from purna das road just take opposite lane to azad hind dhaba, after entering the lane take second left you will find kaffiesta steaks. 
Now coming to the decor it is a beautifully decorated cafe with lights fitted on colourfull cups on the wall, comfortable seating arrangements with colourful cushions which my girlfriend was bowled over, though the place is small.
Food we ordered spicy chicken wings they serve four pieces of succulent spicy chicken with dips is sufficient for four and it was really good would highly recommend.
Non veg cheese fondue which this place is famous for, full meat platter with chicken ham, salami, sausage, chicken kebabs, prawn and variety of breads and bread sticks, cheese was warm and tasted good, good portion for four and price is pretty cheap compared to what they are giving.
For the main course ordered tenderloin steak it was a well done steak which was juicy and sauce was also creamy and full of mushrooms.
Guys must try its good, cheap, service was upto the mark too so five stars for me.

1. Cucumber and basil mojito - There was a significant absence of cucumber or basil... Just a basic mint and lime mojito. Tasted good none the less.
2. Raspberry mojito - Despite the slight bitter aftertaste, it was quite good.

Overall the drinks quality can be increased... The thin glasses barely hold a few sipfulls.

3. Pork chops - We had ordered ribs but were served chops. The meat was succulent and juicy and the overall taste was good. The only downside was the sauce which tasted too indianised.

The dish was categorised as a sizzler, however it was merely served on a room temperature sizzler plate. There was no sizzle whatsoever. But this is just a technical nitpicking as it did not affect the taste of the dish in any which way.

4. Tenderloin steak - This was quite perfect in every which way. Truly a good steak.

Beautiful place and good food at a very reasonable price.. located in keyatala road 5 min walk from purnadas road and Vivekananda park, just beside wendys salon is must visit for food lovers. Tried tenderlion steak medium rare made perfectly, pork chop on bbq sauce which was ordered by a friend which she simply loved and also a canadian snack poutine for a starter which is basically fries topped with salsa, mexican spreads and we ordered extra beef bhuna over it, yummy it was. Service was good too, owners are always there to look after any problem. would like to visit again for trying something else from there scrumptious menu. They have pastas to rissotos to burgers and variety of deserts, hope they keep and maintain the standard throughout. ideal place for get together though its small but for the price for sure, pocket pinch would be really cheap.

A value for money experience at Kaffiesta Steaks

Food:
Fondue (Non Veg): The fondue wasn't cheesy at all. Tasted more like hot, sticky milk.
Grilled Chicken Steak: Very good. The chicken, mash, veggies and the sauce came together very well. 

Staff: Courteous

Ambiance: Generic but good enough; well lit; cosy. 

Will come back again. Lots more to try!

Today we visited kaffiesta steaks located in the heart of southern avenue at keyatala. We kicked things off with a raspberry mojito and a chocolate shake. For starters we ordered Non-veg cheese fondue. It was a real treat with various kinds of chicken delicacies along with boiling cheese. Since Kaffiesta is serious about grill we ordered a Grilled Chicken Steak and a Mexican Jerk Chicken Sizzler. The Grilled Chicken Steak came along with mashed potatoes and in pepper sauce. Not to forget an omelette with its sunny side up. The pepper sauce had nothing to brag about but it was OK. Mexican Jerk Chicken was served in red wine sauce along with herb rice.service was excellent .owner was extremely friendly...it costed almost 1400 for all this we ordered ..

A small, one room restaurant with comfortable seating for small groups of 2 to 4 people, located near Mrs. Magpie. It's difficult to locate at first and I had to use Google maps despite taking an uber. Ambience is pleasant with bright, quirky lighting as is the trend nowadays and the playlist of trendy pop songs lighten the mood. Coming to the food, we had the poutine for starter which is French fries with sour cream sauce and your choice of toppings. We chose grilled chicken and it was simply delicious. The fries are served with salsa, sour cream and a mayo dip. 
We also ordered a pork sausage sandwich. It's more of a slider and is served with French fries. It tasted quite good and was really filling. The pork sausage is authentic and not the frozen package goods that are found in retail chains. We also ordered a grilled sea bass fillet sizzler and chose garlic butter rice as the side. It definitely lived up to our expectations. The portion size is good as compared to other restaurants and the taste was sumptuous enough to make us think about visiting again. Cafe frost was our only order from the beverages menu which was a normal decent and thick cold coffee. 
The prices are very reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food. There is also no added tax yet so that's a plus point. 
The only downside is the fact that they don't have a washroom although they said they would soon be constructing one. The place also looks understaffed with only one waiter who was doing everything from waiting on us to cleaning tables. He was however extremely professional and well versed with the menu . I hope the management looks into the washroom matter soon. Would definitely visit this place again.

A very newly opened steak place in Southern Avenue.
Dropped in for an early heavy dinner. 
We had Bruschettas, a plate having six of them of three different types - Mushroom, Pesto and Tomato. I liked them in the order I wrote.
After Bruschetta, we had the Non Veg Fondue which consisted of chicken salami, sausages, grilled chicken strips, smoked chicken pieces, cream cracker biscuit, breadsticks, a piece of plain french loaf and garlic bread each.
The Seafood Risotto was nice - full of prawns and crabmeat. The Chicken Steak tasted good but only one of them was undercooked.
The Chocolate Shake was very good.
But among all of it, the Chocolate Mousse was clearly a winner.

Kolkata's food scene has always been one of the best in the country and this place just made it a little bit better. Wanted to try a new place and am glad we found this. A small pretty place in southern avenue which opened just a month or so back, run by a couple who makes sure that it is just as they would like it and personally will come and help you in any problems you are facing in their restaurant. The first thing that intrigued me was their menu, with so many delicious options it was very hard to decide what to order. We finally went with some pork sausages for starters which was absolutely delicious but little heavy and can be a meal itself, oh, they also make their sausages at home which was a surprise when we tasted the dish that's why we had to confirm. For mains we ordered a beef steak and the city and it was cooked to perfection! Very juicy and tender and just exploding with flavor!! We ordered a chocolate shake and hot chocolate with it. The chocolate shake was a bit too sweet for me but my friend absolutely loved it. The total bill came to around 800 bucks so yes , it is pocket friendly too!! I would highly recommend this place and I can surely say I'll probably become a regular here myself if they can maintain this standard of food and services.

Its always fun to explore a new restaurant! After much planning and with loads of expectations yesterday we planned a dinner at Kaffiesta Steaks. A Steak was a must and along with it we ordered Fondue (nin-veg platter). The ambience is good. The decor is quirky and they played a few good songs. Service is on-point. The Grilled Chicken Steak was perfect, but I am a little disappointed with the  vegetables that came with it. And in the Fondue, the cheese broth could have been better and the sausages did not taste good. Apart from this,  it was a good dinner. The experience was good.

I just had a visit to the restaurant a week ago. Precisely I had the following experience 

LOCATION- It is located just beside wendy's. An easy to locate in the busy streets of southern Avenue.

DECOR- The resturant has wooden furniture along with colourful cushions. Though it is quite small, ranging within  15-20 seaters. The interior and the food quotes on the wall are quite interesting though.

FOOD- Coming to food, we ordered 
1. Bade mian - The presentation of this food was superb and unique. It had 6 pieces of chicken along with two breads (also available in beef). Taste was good but i didnt find anything out of the box.
2. Non- veg Cheese Fondue- If you are a non- veg lover, this is something worth a try, a plate filled up with sausages, bacons, salami etc. Accompanied by a big bowl of hot cheese dip. This made me fall in love with this place‚ù§
3. Mutton Chapli Burger- That was a full fledged burger.. accompanied with french fries and topped with an egg Pouch. Something mutton lovers will rejoice eating
4. Mexican jerk chicken- A good sizzler along with herb rice and grilled chicken steaks accompanied by some veggies. A good main couse to try.
5. Ice cream- We ordered plain chocolate ice cream and it was well decorated and came along with a reasonable price.

Overall, it was a good eexperience with this new cafe. Our overall pocket pinch was 1330. Do visit once for their FONDUE‚ù§

An ideal place for steak lovers. We went there and tried some steaks, mock tails and desserts. It's located in southern avenue. We ordered tenderloin steak, chicken grilled steak, Raspberry mohito and chocolate Brownie with vanilla ice cream. Tenderloin steak and grilled chicken steak were really delicious as they were served with our choice of sauce (pepper sauce). I would give Raspberry mohito and Brownie with vanilla ice cream a thumbs up. A newly opened restaurant worth trying for. We Would love to visit again. Loved it. :)

A newly opened joint with a good variety of food, so we decided to give this a try. And i have to say i was impressed. The flavor and the quality of the food was really good. Although the place is small i really liked the decor. Coming to the food we ordered beef bhuna, tenderloin burger and pork chops. The beef bhuna tasted great, the meat was soft and masala was just right. Only gripe i had was it could have been spicier. I had to add chilli flakes to make it right. They could just ask the customers whether they want spicy or not. A touch more of green chillies would do wonders. Coming to the pork chops that dish just blew me away. Nothing fancy just salt and with butter garlic thyme and rosemary. It was done right. The best pork chops i have ever had hands down. Lastly the burger, the patty was juicy the bun was toasted nicely. Classic burger done Justice.
Only negative thing i have to say is the portions are a bit on the small side.
I would definitely would love to visit this place again.

Once again a big thank you to zomato for helping me find this place. It had a cute decor with scrumptious food at reasonable price. Located at keyatala it's convenient to reach and has plenty of parking available. Their sausages taste amazing and their food comes in a moderate quantity. Their chicken steak is a must try along with their mojitos. We also ordered for Mac n cheese which was satisfying along with chicken tetrazini. This was not authentic tetrazini and more like pasta in white sause but nevertheless it tasted nice. Only thing this place is very small has only 4-5 tables so might seem a bit cramped up. Overall a nice experience and wouldn't mind visiting again.

A small cafe in southern avenue, that has a small area but has successfully utilised the space well. 
We started off with some raspberry mojito, that tasted pretty well, but let me tell you it looked nothing like the one in the menu, but overall it was pretty tasty.
2nd was a chocolate shake we had which too, to our dismay shall look nothing like the one in the menu, which looks way more delicious that how it is in reality.
The main course we had was of mac cheesy. This was surprisingly good and oh-so-cheesy, it came with a small garlic bread which too tasted well, but the garlic bread was ridiculously small. 
But, the mac cheesy won the prize. I'd surely love to visit this place again for the mac cheesy. But I'd love if the drinks had some consistency with the pictures shown.

Loved the hipster decor. Ambiance was really good. We visited during high noon, so the place was pretty much empty. Location is pretty easy to find.

Given that it's a new restaurant, they still haven't started serving all the dishes that are in the menu, yet. Nevertheless, the food was amazing.

We ordered a beef Steaks and the City (clever name) with mushroom sauce and herb rice, pork ribs with their homemade barbecue sauce and mashed potatoes and a fresh lime soda.

Now the fresh lime soda was as good as a simple soda can get. Nothing much to say there. The beef was cooked medium rare, and the piece was succulent, juicy and had the perfect texture. The seasoning was evenly spread and the sauce was perfect (a little less, given that it was served with rice which soaks up the sauce). The pork rib was a big, single piece of rib and my my, did it taste sinful. The sauce was one of the best barbecue sauces I've ever had. The pork was cooked just perfectly and once again, the seasoning was perfect. We didn't have to reach out for the shaker even once. The mashed potatoes were smooth and lumpless, and complemented the dish perfectly.

I liked the pork better, though.

The staff was courteous and seemed to know what they were doing. We were pretty happy with the service overall. Will surely visit again.

We ordered: 
poutine : tastes heavenly,the dips are brilliant and the portion is,well, good for 4people which 2 of us tried to finish but failed!
And The fries were at the base,we barely made it to the base....
4.5/5

Non veg cheese fondue : 4/5 the fondue is thick, beautiful, warm smooth , everything a fondue should be and the portion of it again was enough for 4! Yet another thing we couldn't finish.
It had salami(2kinds), grilled chicken,shredded baked chicken, bread sticks ,prawns(2) other kinds of bread,sausages.

Jasmine tea: It smelt nice...i didn't have it so i don't know the taste,but it looked golden.Teabag tea,so i dont expect it to be groundbreaking.

Cinnamon Caf√© mocha: 2/5
Not a fan of this.the powdered cinnamon over it was off-putting,Foam lovers will probably love it,i love my coffee rather thick and black and sweet.It wasn't upto the mark.

Couldn't taste the famous ribs and the tenderloin because the portions of these were so filling! Everybody said the portions were small,i don't get it! It's huge! Atleast the two we had.

Prices: perfectly reasonable.Perfect place for a friendly hangout and even a date! The woody decor is wonderful.

Lunch time, was looking for a steak house, found kaffiesta steaks on the plush bylanes of southern avenue, just take opposite lane to purna das azad hind , after entering the lane leave the first lane and stop at the second lane you will find kaffiesta. It was almost packed up for saturday lunch had to wait for a table, Decor is awesome very clean and well maintaned, thumbs up, coming to the main part is the food for starters ordered prawn in blanket it is basically bacon wrapped prawn tossed in sauce,just fantastic, price is also not very high compare to the quality served,qty to be checked once also ordered beef keema poutine it is basically canadian snack as in fries topped with beef keema served with different sauces like salsa, mexican, mayo etc, it was yummy. For the main course ordered tenderlion steak well done cooked, i enjoyed with mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables while my friend ordered italian tetrazzini pasta with chicken served with foccacia, she said she liked it very much. They have introduced in the menu ferroro rocher brownie which was yum served with vanilla icecrean topped with chcolate, strawberry sauce and chocochips for only rs 120.. worth it!! really impressed with this joint, all d very best.

Food is good, perfect small steakhouse kind of a diner what we call is US. Appreciate young owners to come up with this idea. Food is no nonsense, they focused mainly on good quality food rather than presentation and all. Would recommend their steaks and burgers. Their kaffiesta offroader burger is amazing better than any burger joint here, and also tried bbq prawn steak which was well cooked, portion was ok later they might increase a bit. Good place.. Good food.

Adamant management who can't differentiate between raw and medium rare meat. Extremely displeased by this new eatery. Not revisiting again due to the high handedness of the management in dealing with customer complaints. The deliberate avoidance displayed by the owners in spite of the repeated and multiple complaints in their presence is Appalling to say the least.

Visited kaffiesta steaks for lunch , it was full we had to wait for 20 minutes for table for 4, it is very well decorated and well maintained, we tried 2 starters 1 spicy chicken wings and stuffed potato. They serve 4 big wings, portion was goodfor four and tasted amazing. We ordered for the main course it was mexican jerk sizzler, Tenderloin steak and porkrib sizzler.
Lets come to the tenderloin, tried with mushroom sauce it was yummy and meat was properly cooked better than any other place in kol, i have tried many joints out here. Mexican jerk sizzler we tried with herb rice and saut√©ed vegetables, its basically Caribbean style chicken, chef has done full justice to it, last we ordered pork ribs it was good too portion was appropriate and filling, it tasted good. Would definitely recommend this place as its cheap and pocket friendly. Good for college goers.

If you like eating your pork ribs raw then you must visit this place.
Went to this place with a friend , Ordered a starter called (Badhe Miyan) which is basically beef skewers.
The name might contain the word "badha" but the portion was too small which costs 310rs, and to top it all, the meat was cold.
Then we ordered for a pork sausage which was decently cooked even tasted alright.
We ordered for a pork ribs and a tenderloin steak in the main course.Pork ribs turned out to be raw. When we showed them the food is raw , they said that we ordered for a medium rare pork ribs
( where as we ordered for a medium rare tenderloin, so they basically messed up our order ), so that's why it is a "little pink" around the bones. Their "little pink" is called red in our dictionary. I almost started chewing it when I realised that what they have served is partly raw. I had to throw most of it.
There is a huge difference between medium rare and raw anyway , when we tried to give them feedback and asked one of the managers or staffs to come , they kept fighting with each other behind the glass for a long time. Moreover , the attitude was so defensive , after messing up our order they were absolutely adamant and kept saying that we ordered for a medium rare pork ribs (which we didn't) and it is not their fault.
The waiter repeated the order , he didn't mention medium rare anywhere for the pork.
When we mentioned the issue, they took several minutes and came back with their order slip showing us that it is written medium rare and kept repeating the same thing till the very end.

When we asked them for a feedback form , they said we do not have any system for that.
The food is absolutely not value for money. The cut of the Tenderloin steak was like a fish fillet.
The appearance might seem cozy and friendly but the people serving were not apologetic or friendly.
We had to pay some 1300rs , most of it was for some cold beef and raw pork ribs.
Food should be treated with love and care. This is probably the most horrendous experience I ever had.
Thanks for ruining our dinner Kaffiesta Steaks.

It was a great experience dining here. The place is small but beautifully decorated with unique and colourful things around. Coming to food. We ordered:
Lemongrass chicken: it is chicken in skewers with a lemongrass flavour. Unique in taste
Non veg cheese fondue: this is heavenly. Different types of non veg kababs n salamis with melted cheese dip, with garlic bread. Just awesome. N quite filling
Chicken mexican jerk sizzler: grilled chicken with a hatke flavour, served with rice n veg. Good one
Presentation deserves full marks. Staffs are helpful n service is quick.
Also easy to locate, in the lane beside nazrul mancha bus stop. New one in the area. Must try. It is quite pocket friendly.

Have tried this place with group of friends, it is beautifully lit up, lot of positivity and one wall they have highlighted with cup lights on it, i would call it a selfie wall. Now coming to thefood we ordered beef steak very well cooked, served with mashed potato and saut√©ed veggies, we also ordered cheese fondue non veg it was a platter full of meat from shrimps to chicken to salami to variety of bread sticks and foccaccia which is absolutely their speciality,then we ordered pork rib sizzler and bhetki sizzler, kaffiesta doesnt give basa fish but pure bhetki at a very reasonable price, and also the pork rib which is also properly cooked andportion is also quite plentifull. They serve no nonsense food. Would recommend everyone to atleast try them asap. Guys price is very reasonable.

Found this place under ""newly opened" and decided to experiment. Needless to say NO REGRETS! AWESOME FOOD! Great service. Quaint lil place with a charm of its own. Pocket friendly too. Will be visiting soon for sure. Would recommend to all!

For the cafe: Darjeeling tea was not up to the mark. Mac n cheese should have had been baked with a crust of bread crumbs n cheese. Wish you success, cheers!

Located just next to Wendy's Salon in Southern Avenue, this quaint and cute little place is an absolute pleasure. Besides having a very homely vibe, their menu is quite extensive and isn't too much of a burden when it comes to the pocket pinch. With three starters, three main courses, two refreshments and a cuppa Darjeeling tea, the bill came upto 1990 inclusive of tax. The Ceasars salad was absolutely fresh and very well balanced. The Poutine with sausages was to die for. Their fondue is an absolute must try, especially with the variety that they have! Their pork rib was extremely soft, juicy and succulent! The only two complaints I have however was they the Mac and Cheese which we were served didn't have the grilled crust that is usually associated with the dish, and that the tea they used for thirty Darjeeling tea could have been of better quality. All in all it was a fantastic experience and I can't wait to come back here again. I'd definitely recommend this place to people.

A new restaurant, perfect modern day setup  with latest pop music in the background which you would enjoy. A very well lit place. 
The owner herself is a Chef. A really nice lady. She took the order and all the food she recommended were good.
Ordered - spicy chicken wings. Deep fried chicken wings nothing special in it.
Tough guy fillet steak burger - absolutely marvelous. The Matty and the sauces blended well. Should have ordered more than one. 
Tenderloin steak - tasted awesome. 
Drunk shank - it was cheese based sizzler the steam was better though. 
Wanted to try the cheese foundae it was not available.

Kaffiesta Steaks is located a bit interior but then that shouldn't stop you from visiting the place. This place is the comfiest place I have ever visited. I wish I could stay there forever. 
  The decoration was amazing, it is located in a silent area. As soon as I entered I fell in love with the place. They have comfortable wooden chairs with cute lil pillows. 
 The food was also good. I had ordered a chocolate shake which was amazing. The next was cheese balls, they were delightful and then we ordered a pasta. The pasta disappointed me a bit. But the rest was amazing.

The ambience- 5/5 
Food- 4.5/5

This place is a must visit. :)

A newly opened steakhouse tucked in one of the by-lanes of Hindustan Park. The decor is pretty amazing, but the seating arrangement is somewhat uncomfortable. The 2 seaters were so small that there was barely any room for keeping our plates. As the place is newly opened, the waiter was not able to resolve our queries and that's acceptable. We ordered beef bhuna, pork steak in pepper sauce, classic US hamburger and fresh lime soda. The beef bhuna could have been spicier, but it was scrumptious. The pork was bursting with flavors and meat was very juicy. I am not a burger fan, but my partner said it was good. The only thing that disappointed me was quantity. The quantity was not all satisfactory. Else, everything was perfect.

Couldn't wait to try out the new steak house and checked in on the second day of opening. Needless to say , there were quite many teething troubles which we usually expect from a newborn and my rating has excused them for time being .
The restaurant holds a small square room with wooden chairs with colourful cushions and quirky wall arts . the space has an overburdened seating capacity with tables having less than necessarty isolation . One would surely find difficult to dine on a crowded occasion and a rearrangement is strongly recommended.
The staff has to be trained with time.
Many items weren't available including bacon and prawn.
we ordered for a KHASHIR MANGSHO BURGER which came with fries salad and salsa on a round wooden slab. i absolutely loved the kosha mangsho reduction which was the highlight of the platter , however usage of better burger bun is recommended.
the next order was jerk chicken in mexican sauce but we were served with GRILLED CHICKEN in Herb sauce as we noticed in the bill. Anyway , the plating wasn't impressive , the veggies served in saute were of huge sizes half not cooked properly. the rice had no flavours and craved for some more boiling and the chicken could have been a bit softer.
the first experience wasn't a very impressive one , hope to try some more from the menu soon.

We discovered the store suddenly while walking looking for a place which was opened. We were pleasantly surprised by the place. The decor is adorable and homely with brightly coloured cushions and comfortable seats. My friend and I ended up ordering the prawns in a blanket and the tenderloin steak and I must say everything was delicious . The bacon was amongst the freshest I have had in a while, and the steak was done correctly at the requested medium rare. The owners and the staff was very friendly and eager to help. All in all it was a fantastic experience and would love to go back.

This place is just 5 days old when we found it. I must say, I was absolutely delighted with this place.

It's small and cozy, with pretty furniture and amazing decor. They have a 4 member team full of passion and love for their trade.

We had a large variety of items. We had the Poutine which had a bed of fries loaded with paneer and pork sausages, served along with 3 dips. The sausages were bursting with flavour, and soft. The fries, which are also served with burgers, were perfectly crispy.

Then we had the tenderloin steak and we had it in red wine jus. Very few places make their steaks this good and this is one of them, that too at such a decent price. The level of doneness we asked for was medium rare, and it was obeyed perfectly. On top of that they rested the meat too, so the meat was tender and juicy and full of flavour. These people know how to perfect their beef.

We also ordered burgers of different varieties. Each of them was enough for a person, the buns were crisp and were loaded with juicy meat.

We also had a risotto. The bechemel sauce was perfect. It had grated parmesan over it, and tasted fabulous.

They have a small and comfortable menu, easy to choose from. They also have very friendly and welcoming staff. The entire experience was pleasing. We'll definitely go for more.

To put a rainy Durgapuja-afternoon to good use, my friend and I decided to treat ourselves to a good steak. We spotted this extremely cute little joint near Purna Das road- bright and cosy, comfortable and colourful !! 
As you enter the place, what'll strike you first is the lovely use of different colours in the cushions, walls, lighting and entire decor of this place - it acts as a natural 'mood-elevator' !
The extremely warm stuff n superbly delicious food add to the euphoria. 
We had a tenderloin steak and prawn in blanket (which is basically prawn wrapped in bacon). While the steak was perfectly cooked n tasted great, the latter won my heart . I have never tasted a better platter of prawn-n-bacon anywhere else !

The only thumbs-down is the size of the place, the tables n chairs look quite cramped in such a small space. 
But if you are a believer of 'quality over quantity' and are looking for a cosy place for that perfect adda with a dear friend, this is where you should head to . 

P.s. - there is ample space for parking around the place

The newest steak house on the block. It's a small and a very nicely decorated place, with nice minimalistic posters in frames and a white brick wall with a number of cups which serve as light. As of now I've tried the pork rib, tenderloin steak and the chicken steak sizzlers and none of them have disappointed me. 

The pork rib was awesome. It was soft, tender and perfectly cooked. It didn't turned tough/chewy as time passed by and the pepper sauce was a perfect match with the pork rib.

The tenderloin steak was probably the best tenderloins in this locality(I'm saying locality because there are some good steakhouses in southern avenue). I opted for the same pepper sauce the one which I got with the pork rib and it was a hit. Soft, tender, jucy tenderloin steak it what you'll be getting in here. But unfortunately they don't have the bigger steaks for now probably they will introduce it in the future.

The chicken steak sizzler was equally good. It wasn't for me because a friend of mine was having it and it was his first experience with continental cuisine. He really liked it and he was totally full. I tried a bit of the chicken which was there in the item and it was tremendous. It was so soft and jucy and tasted super good.

Conclusion, they are just 4 days old and they are serving very good foods and they crew is very nice and friendly. If they continue this, and I hope they do, they might give tough competition to some big names.

One of the newest places in the City of Joy, and I believe it's here to stay. Located at Keyatala Road, this is a little gem in my opinion. The decor is classy, the music was soothing, the staff courteous. When it comes to the crux of the matter, the food, we were content and satisfied. We had Beef Bhuna, Pork Sausages and Prawns in a Blanket for starters. All of them worked perfectly as appetizers, especially the Pork Sausages. In main course, we had Beef Pepper Steak, Pork Ribs, Beef Tenderloin Steak and Grilled Chicken Steak. The portions were good enough to satiate your tummy yet not too heavy to overburden it. In short, a very satisfying dinner on Shashthi.

PS - To all the Instagram junkies out there : The lighting at this place is perfect for your photos.

New in town but already giving a competition to the big guys.. From ambience to food, it was like out of the world. A food worth its bucks. Would have rated 5.0 but the only drawback is that it doesn't have a proper washroom. Otherwise its a must visit place at Golpark.

A new steak house in the bylanes of Southern Avenue just born yesterday... A small cosy yet beautifully decorated place, serving extraordinary dishes... Staffs are extremely courteous... Service was fast too... We tried...

#Starters#

‚ù§ Poutine ~ Mainly it was french fries loaded with chicken n cheese... They are serving it with three excellent dips... Mind blowing one...

‚ù§ Fondue ~ You guys are quite familiar with it's veg version, but how many of you did tried the non veg version of it??? If you didn't, then do try it from here... A platter full of shrimps, shredded chicken, sausages and cream cracker biscuits with a hot pot of molten cheese as dip... Just insane...

‚ù§ Bade Mian ~ A hanging skewer having delicious soft n succulent tasty chicken chunks with bell peppers grilled with perfection came with two pieces of garlic bread... Well presented n extremely tasty too...

#Main Course#

‚ù§ Mutton chapli burger ~ Awesome one... They are throwing serious challenge to many famous burger joints... The party was tasty n juicy... And the dressing was just perfect...

‚ù§ Fried chicken burger ~ Delicious...

‚ù§ Mexican jerk chicken sizzler ~ Mind blowing...

‚ù§ Pork ribs sizzler ~ Another master piece from the kitchen... Excellent... Just excellent...

#Desert#

‚ù§ Brownie with icecream ~ Nice one to end the treat...

We can go for their cucumber, strawberry or virgin mojito... All were quite refreshing...

Now the main attraction of this place is... It's very very pocket friendly guys... So this puja go and hit it up... You will not get dishearten for sure...

Location : If you're traveling from Golpark side, take the lane right next to the Golpark petrol pump. Head straight until you find Azad Hind Dhaba on your right. Take the lane opposite to the Dhaba, walk straight, you'll see garden cafe. Cross garden cafe and take the first left after that and you'll reach the steak house.

Decor & Ambience : Bright Lights? Check. Woody decor? Check. Positive vibes? Double check. Nice choice of music? Triple check.

Food :

The menu of this place is very interesting. From steaks to pastas to burgers, they've got it all.

*Non veg cheese fondue platter : Sausages, shrimps, chicken, breadsticks, garlic bread, crackers served along with a pot of luscious molten cheese. Everything was grilled amazingly well. And the fondue was thick and creamy and everything a good fondue should be.

*Poutine : Fries. Sauce. Cheese. Chicken. What not to like?

* Bade Miyan : Espetada styled grilled chicken skewer, served with garlic bread. The chicken pieces were tender and succulent and I quite liked this dish.

*Mutton Chapli burger : Minced mutton patty,spiced, grilled, topped with a fried egg and served inside two buns. I loved loved loved this burger.

*Fried chicken burger : Crunchy crispy crumb fried chicken burger served with fries. Again, loved this burger.

*Pork chop : The pork was nicely cooked. The sauce was yum. They don't serve the usual BBQ suace that most Kolkata restaurants serve. It was very good.

Service : Service was quite prompt. The staff is courteous and very well behaved. The owners are very humble and they manage everything themselves.

This place is definitely a must visit if you're a fan of anything American.

Was pleasantly surprised when dropped into Kaffiesta Steaks last evening. The place is easy to spot. Enter the lane right opposite to Azad Hind Dhaba (Purnadas Road) and simply take the second left, and you have Kaffiesta Steaks glowing right in front of you. The fact that there is enough provision for parking made things slightly less worrying for us. 

Coming to the food. We tried the Poutine, the Bademia, the Non Veg Cheese fondue platter for starters. 

While I loved the poutine and the Bademia, gemmed with tender chicken pieces, the fondue platter stole the show for me. Right from spiced sausages to garlic prawns, from freshly baked foccacio to toasty garlic bread, the platter left us impressed to bits. 

Moving to the mains, the Jerk Chicken, The Mutton Chapli Kebab and the Fried Chicken Burger are all very impressive. If you love fried patties, then there is no way you can say a no to the fried chicken burger, with slaw and fries on the side, this is the best dish of food for you.

My favourite out of the mains was the jerk chicken platter, paired beautifully with buttery herb rice and buttered veggies. This sizzling dish is a complete meal in itself. 

We gulped all of this down with healthy servings of Virging and Cucumber Mojitos. Dropping in at the Kaffiesta on another day of the pujas is a given now.

Mexican Jerk Chicken: it's a full fledged mexican type grilled chicken,superb.

Drinks:
Virgin Mojito; as usual refresing one.

Cucumber Mojiti: It's cool and fizzy,flavoured.

Dessert:¬†
