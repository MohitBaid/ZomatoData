Well made juicy fried chicken. We tried chicken cheese burger and chicken popcorn. Both the dishes were excellent. The taste was very similar to KFC. They also give 10% discount to students on showing ID card! Definitely worth a visit..

A great choice if you want to enjoy some burgers and fries. It's almost like Kfc and pocket friendly. Combos are very cool n they give a extra chicken only at Rs1. Quite a cool decor. Food tastes good.

Conveniently located at Park Circus 7 point (opposite to Arsalan), this place is a must visit if you are craving for Fried Chicken and Burgers.

It's a small place which can accommodate around 12 people. The menu offers Burgers, Fried Chicken, Chicken Wings, Fiery Chicken accompanied by dips, french fries and soft drinks. Their combo meal is a must try and can be shared by 4.

Mr. Fat Bird is quite concerned about the pocket pinch. You will get the food at dirt cheap prices. Apart from that, if you are a student, get 10% off just by showing your id card. If you give a Facebook check-in, yet another attractive offer will surprise you! Overall, you are bound to leave the place with a happy tummy and a happier wallet!

The service is quite impressive. You will not get a chance to complain about anything.

Recommended!

The food is below average. It's a KFC ripoff that fails to deliver. However, it is quite easy on the pocket therefore it attracts a lot of people who survive on a student's budget (read broke). The food, though not very tasty, is definitely filling.

Well at the heart of park circus crossing finally opens a place where you can chill with friends and indulge in your favourite delicacy.... Chicken!!!!!
Easy on the pocket and a filling experience will definitely make you visit over and again...
You can order anything from the burger to the fried chicken and nothing will disappoint...
Finally something as good as KFC and much easier on the pocket.
Food 5/5
Service 5/5
Ambience 4/5

Pathetic experience.their opening time is 12.30pm.but,after 12.50,they don't open.after opening,when we visit,they tell that,they took minimum 30 minutes for preparation.dont tell you about their food item,as we don't even tasted this.but,the staff behaviour is not good.i don't visit this in future.ONE KIND REQUEST FPR THE AUTHORITY,KINDLY PROVIDE YOUR EXACT LOCATION IN THE GOOGLE MAP.THE GOOGLE MAP SHOW IT JUST OPPOSITE THE KALA MANDIR.

A little birdie took us to its mother and it turned out to be one big family of Fat Birds. So Mr. Fat Bird came down at the heavily congested Park Circus 7 Point Crossing. "Heading over to thr biriyani den Arsalan?" he asked. Let's catch up with the Chicken Family happily living across the street - he added. So we went for a happy chicken meal, as we were suffering from an Obsessive Chicken Disorders.
Ah! They sure had a cure for our OCD, a fried chicken just at Re. 1 absolutely free. So we had a gala meal of tender succulent chicken strips, fried chicken and a rice bowl just for 140 INR and hot fiery chicken wings just 80 INR. Now hold it here comes the surprise Mr. Fat Bird took us for a ride on Facebook and there we got a Fried Chicken just by checking in (on FB) and adding Re 1 to the bill.
So if you are suffering from OCD make sure you visit the Chicken Family living at The Park Circus Crossing.

In last few years Kolkata got many alternatives of CCD and Barista and seriously they are way better than CCD and Barista. This joint Mr. Fat Bird trying to be the alternative of KFC. Unfortunately they are way behind. Taste-wise their crispy fried chicken has no match with KFC. The seasoning is very poor. The ketchup is the saviour. The mojito is basically syrup and carbonated water. Portion is also not heavy. It is justifying the price. As a whole they need a good amount of reform in their recipe to be a contender of KFC.

The burgers and fried chicken are just awesome. Value for money is great. Marination, blend of herbs and spices is simply mouth watering. Drinks are cool, too. We as PREM-E-ASHA (premeasha@gmail.com) tried Blue Lagoon along with burgers and fried chicken. Must visit for one and all, if you are around 7 point corner. Hemant, Sohail. & Rana are amazing as young entrepreneurs with a welcome smile! We look forward to an association with them in the near future. GOD BLESS Mr. FAT BIRD!
