Try out rasgulla, dahi vara, and rasmalai. I used to visit this shop very often while returning home from my college, it's located just at the Kalighat bus stoppage. Rasgullas are simply from heaven.... One also must try out their can version for gifting purpose.

Another favourite place of mine. I know this place for last 20 years and had celebrated plenty of joyful moment here. I used to play in BTA just opposite to this place attached with Jogesh Mime Academy beside Kalighat Tram Depot. After practise I used to visit K.C. Das to grab some food along with my friends with a huge hunger. Luchi-Chholar Dal is still my favorite apart from Rasogolla and Kara Paker Sandesh. The shop holds the history on its wall which gives me goosebumps knowing abou Nabin Maira and history of Rasogolla.

It is located at Kalighat crossing. Went there and tried few of their items. Everything was good. Price is on the higher side but the quality compensates for it...

This K.C. Das Grandson outlet is located near Kalighat Tram Depot.

No sitting arrangements.

Not so clean.

Tried their famous rosogolla , doi bara & Samosa. Rosogolla was no doubt delicious & fresh. Doi bara was nice. Samosa was tasty with nice fillings.

Pocket pinch is bit high.

This outlet needs to be revamped.

The Esplanade counterpart is way better.

দেখতে যতটা ভালো খেতে ততটা নয় । মান আগের তুলনায় ঝুলে গেছে । এদিক থেকে সিঙ্গারার স্বাদ ভালো বলব । রসগোল্লা মাঝারি । একমাত্র সরভাজা খেয়ে খানিক ভালো লাগল ।

The age old legendary K.C.Das Grandson is not so great anymore. This outlet of K.C.Das Grandson is located opposite to the Kalighat Tram Depot. This outlet is a fairly big one, but there is utter lack of hygiene and cleanliness. One can see, the shelves of sweets having spots of the 'torkari'  served with radhaballavi. 

Coming to the food, their rosogolla is the only edible item. There are straight high tables attached to the wall where you can keep your plate of food and eat, but I doubt if it is ever cleaned. The doi bora is sometimes good, sometimes horrible, sometimes it is too salty, sometimes it is sour. The other sweetmeats here also does not taste good. 

All in all, this outlet needs a massive upgrade in every sphere. I will only visit after that.

This place is just on the opposite of  kalighat tram depot and on the right hand side of the signal crossing. The place is clean  more or less but there are no seating arrangements.
This age old heritage sweet brand no longer can boost of its legendary quality of all its sweets. It's rosogollas are still a delicacy but their luchi and cholar dal is a big no. Kalakand, chanar jalebi is still satisfactory but rest most of the sweets have degraded in quality. It's a dissapointment that a sweet shop of such stature no longer sells sweets of any of its earlier qualities.
The staff are not very cordial always but ate courteous in nature.

Dropped by this outlet one day after a disastrous experience with evening snacks.Had two varieties of malpua(aatar and chhanar).The channar malpua was fluffy and soft.It was good but could cut down a little on the sickly sweet taste.But aatar malpua was too good.It had crispy edges laced around a spongy centre.The sweetness was in right amount.Loved it to the fullest.Will surely drop by to try their savories some day.Pricing is totally reasonable.

Located close to Kalighat Metro Station, this place is quite popular among locals mostly due to the iconic Rasagullas. Dropped in here once and tried Samosas on the go and two Rasagulla to finish with. The Samosa was hot and the filling was quite tasty. The Rasagulla was soft, and simply melted inside the mouth. Not sure about the other products though. Hopefully, they retain their quality.

Its unbelievable that his old heritage sweet shop has turned into average sweet outlet due to its degrading  quality day by day. Varieties of sweets are very limited and with average taste. Only the ghee malpua tasted good. Luchi cholar daal was just awful. Other swwets - gaja, shar bhaja was just soaked in drum of sweet syrup.

Stepping into the shop gives you the feel of heritage...
But the sweets are not up to the mark. I would say its kind of mediocre...
Tried their rasmalai, pranohara, gurer sondesh and rasagolla...
Rasmalai was a huge disappointment.... Pranohara and gurer sondesh were average... Well I was happy dat atleast d rasagolla was gud

One must  maintain quality to remain in d market.

Just visited this sweet shop yesterday. In my sweet loving experience till now I had tasted the best rasgulla ever. Rasgullas and rasmalai's are just sumptuous and lip smacking, too spongy and too soft. Rasgullas from the other shops generally contains maida and sujis and elaichi flavors too. But here one can find it in its purest forms made from cow milk which is very rare now a days. Tried their veg kofta and radaballavi...... Yummilicious.....
And also had chocolate rasgula first time, don't know how to describe the yummy thing, soft, chocolaty, just heavenly.
Next time in Kolkatta, I will definitely come here for their rasgullas and syrupy sweets.

I have a deep and meaningful respect for and relation with KC Das Grandson. I used to spend my days watching the sweets being made, and have tasted their rasgulla and pantua almost right from the oven. In my experience, KC Das is one of the biggest names when it comes to sweets in Kolkata. Each and every item on offer is not only tasty, but also comes with a hint of uniqueness, which is rarely seen in any other big or medium sweet shop. Thank you for all those sweet memories.

Using the name with the international brand value, this place is just not worth it. The sandeshes are often stuffed with suji and maida and I even have experiences of taking home stale sweets that tasted rotten. So not at all recommended.

Bobbed into this place after a visit to the Kalighat temple...
With my diet not permiting Rosgullas or sweets I wanted to try something different and was adviced to try the "Radha Ballavi" with the Dum aloo.

First time I had heard about it , let alone tasted it before !! Loved it ..:)
Hardened my resolve to delve deeper to explore Bengali cuisine. 

Ambiance is non existent..there is a one foot counter along the wall where you can park your plate and eat. This is one of those heritage destinations I guess, so why complain about the ambiance.

Worth a visit when you go to the Kalighat temple

Location: Opposite Kalighat Pumping Station; A few meters from Rashbehari crossing (towards Jatin Das Park Metro Station).

K.C. Das is a renowned name in the sweet industry and has been serving the people of City of Joy for years now. Famous for its Rosogullas, this place holds a special place in everyone's heart. One just can't afford missing out the Rosogullas out here. :)
And, the same goes for me! Guests coming over and sweets needed; here I was on April 19, 2015 at 19:20 hours for a takeaway of Chocolate Rossogulla and Plain Rossogulla.
The shop looked quite old with scratched display cases, granite wall-side tables which had cracks and needed repairs; a bit of renovation here please. 

- Chocolate Rossogulla
Was absolutely delicious. Soft, chocolatey and mouth-melting. Heat it a bit in the microwave oven and it would taste great!
Recommended.

- Plain Rossogulla
Balanced sweetness which simply disappeared in the mouth. Tasted good.

While I waited for my takeaway, sampled the Luchi which was served with Cholar Dal.
- The Luchi and dal were reheated in the microwave oven before service. 
On one hand, the luchis weren't fluffy and were quite oily (highly disappointed) whereas on the other, the Cholar dal was of the dry variant yet, tasted decent. Overall a miss.

The server was quite friendly and polite who served at a prompt speed.
Prices were found to be pocket friendly.

• Hygiene is a bit of an issue at this outlet.

Overall an average experience.
- You're traveling and also love Rosogullas? Opt for their canned Rossogullas. :)

This is one of the many out lets of K.C. Das and Grandson. 

It is situated near Kalighat Temple. The prices of sweets do not pinch your pocket though quality is good. Many people buy canned products from this outlet after visiting Kalighat Temple. Along with sweets you can eat from an assortment of snacks like doi-bora etc.  It has got a look of 70s.

As I was visiting Kalighat Temple today evening...we found this outlet of K.C DAS just beside lane of Kalighat Metro Station.. To be Very frank this outlet will not attract you by its looks...not very much upto date interior..but who cares; we were craving for Rasgullas... 
FOOD-》 we take one canned rasgullas for home because we were not hungry that time. I think K.C das rasgullas didn't need any explanations..they are awesome. Other than that there was plenty amount of sweet varieties like laddu, sandesh, doi, many. . 
LOCATION-》the lane beside Kalighat metro station. . Which leads to kalighat Temple. 
I would suggest you for take away and enjoy at home!! :)

Though K.C.Das is mainly known for popularising the rasagullas in canned format..i am more fond of their other snacks..the radha ballavi with dum aloo,kanchkolar kofta and chop..brings back the childhood memories..The most famous bengali symbols: the mishti doi and rosogulla are however very average,if you want to try typical mishti doi and rasagulla visit north calcutta,the rasamalai and ice cream mishtis are pretty good though,and the diabetic sandesh..a bliss for the diabetics..all in all it used to be better in the past..presently its cashing on the old glory..
