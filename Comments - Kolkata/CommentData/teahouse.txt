So, I visited this place for a quick catch-up and tried their iced tea. I tried the blueberry iced tree and I must admit it is one of the best I have had. Totally amazing.
Also the guys at the counter are very decent and an affordable place.

Located inside the campus opposite the rdb boulevard pantaloons on the line of keventers and noodle story they boast of simple grubs too. However was just waiting for sometime and decided to go for a fancy tea. The disapointment was being a sunday two not so interested servers were there and kept on saying not available to most of that I choose, infact they werent sure about what they have. I settled for a simply lemon tea to reduce their confusions. I was asked if i need sugar, answered in affirmative. However when my concotion arrived with a 20 rupee bill, it was less on the sugar. However it was refreshing and fairly priced at one styrofoam cup full. The variety they boast of, if available will make them a staple choice. Improvements suggested

I tried this place for the first time and honestly the  corn cheese grilled sandwich was really nice and the quantity of cheese and quality of the sandwich was commendable I would definitely come back again and try other dishes here.

The behavior of the staff is also polite.

Being a tea-lover, this place was quite a discovery. I love their chocolate tea. Quite unique and tasty. The owner is a very friendly guy. The staffs are well-behaved too.

Quality of the service has been deteriorating each day. I have been a regular to this joint and mostly order a ginger elaichi tea but often i started getting a normal tea with no ginger or elaichi...informing the people across the counter did not help... earlier sandwiches ordered were better off than the current one's.. they also used to serve wafers with sandwiches but stopped it. Seems they have become too complacent and have taken regular customers for granted.

I have been a fan of Tea House the first day I visited them based out of Sector V, opposite Pantaloons. No one offered me Quality & Price together. But here every item at Tea House is reasonably priced with utmost quality, taste & hygiene which is Incredible. The owners are very warm & polite with their customers. I have recommended Tea House to my friends & colleagues and they are having good time there. I wish lots of success to Tea House. Keep up the good work!!!

A new snacks joint in the premises of Omega Building, offers some unique food and beverages. Tried their mango, lemon, aam panna iced tea. All of them are pretty good. Aam panna was the best of lot. Also tried their tea house special Maggi, it was filled with cheese and vegetables and it was filling and tasty. The owner is a humble person and asks personally for feedback.

This joint opposite to Pantaloons in Sector V doesn't have any proper sitting arrangement. However their service is great with the man managing the counter showing great hospitality. Their kesar tea offering is excellent. Their regular tea size offering is my suggested sizeable proportion as the large offering may be too large for some. Overall nice experience

Located at Sector 5, Omega building - opposite to Pantaloons, Tea House serves varieties of teas, coffees, shakes and snacks. I tried the Moroccan Mint Tea. It tasted good but a dash of lemon would've made it perfect. They also have few unique items on the menu such as chinese poha, maggi sandwich and so on. Chinese poha is made with soya sauce, vinegar and bell peppers. Wonder how this traditional Indian dish would taste with Chinese flavours. ;) Nice combination, I say. 

All the items on the menu are priced very reasonably, service is quick and quality of food is good. Try it out once! :)
