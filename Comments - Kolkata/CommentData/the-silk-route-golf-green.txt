Had our Sosthi Lunch there. A small nicely decorated restro near Bikramgarh More tucked on the first floor of the building just right side of the road towards bikramgarh. We had Dry Chilli Chicken as starter which was really good both in taste & quantity. In nain course we opted for Moon fung fried rice & Sweet-n-Dour chicken. Both the dishes were awsome. Moon fung rice was very light & less oily. Sweet n sour chicken had the perfect balance of sweetness & the sour part. Our bill was only 610 for these 3 dishes. They dont charge any extra taxes/GST.

The food is cheap but the quality is likewise.we ordered some pork dish and blackbean sauce lamb which was simply burnt. Really a let down. The lime juice was totally bullcrap. The ceiling will literally hit your head if you stand straigh. The view of the road is good.

A little but cozy place to be. Quality and quantity both are excellent! This place lies just beside the crossing of golf green. They charge no extra tax. Must visit!

The place is little small but nice .
Food quality is very nice and also the quantity.
But serving was too late may be we were a group of 8 to 10 people.
Price is reasonable.

I ordered mixed hakka chowmin, garlic chicken from swiggy. Ther servics was prompt..the food is just lip smacking. Tasty food and amount is more than enough for an individual for sure. I want to visit their place for once.

If space constraint wasn't an issue this restaurant would have got more ratings :)
Conveniently located in the golf green area this restaurant is nice n neat when it comes to the presentation of food. 
It's a family restaurant though not quite spacious for more than 3 families at a time.
Food is good n fresh. 
Thumbs up for the hospitality :)
We had ordered hot garlic fish with mixed üçö.
Both the quality and quantity was too good. More than enough for two!
Prices were tax included n the pocket pinch isn't high :)

This place is a favourite. It is a tiny shop located on golam hossain road, if you are walking towards golf green from Lords more, this will be one of the first houses on a road to your left, exactly opposite to the chowman outlet. It's entrance is so narrow,climbing up the stairs might freak you out,but the interiors are delightful and cozy. It can barely accommodate 5 tables, but the food makes up for it. Their Chinese is absolutely awesome. Just the right amount of spice with the perfect blend. The staff is really courteous and polite. And the pocket pinch is pretty low.
PS. Somehow every time we have visited silk route, we were so hungry that we couldn't wait to click pictures. So sorry about it
