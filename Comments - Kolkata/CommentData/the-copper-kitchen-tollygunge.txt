I haven't been to this place but have ordered food from here. Kadhai paneer and pulao was what i ordered. Taste of pulao was excellent. Kadhai paneer was however average.

For a decent dining experience you can visit this place.

Chinese dishes are the main cuisine here .
The price is little but up .


Kebabs are tasty though .

Pathetically slow service, damn rude and ignorant staff, hardly any items available in the menu.  You order something and they will serve you something else. Hated this stupid joint and never visiting again. 
Gave old stale vegetables cut into salad.
If you think otherwise try it for yourself.

Another hidden gem in kolkata. The food is very tasty and pocket friendly. A must go for North Indian cuisine lovers. However the place is small, so it is suggested to make a prior reservation. Ambience is pretty good, but it can get a bit suffocating because of the size and poor kitchen exhaust, so - 0.5 for that. Otherwise a 5 on 5 place.

Small place for a quiet family eat out. Not such a big place for a big place party but their home delivery service makes up for that. Food is really tasty & affordable. If you get surprise visits at home & need to order good restro food then u should call up here or can come here too... My fav masala kulcha, matar paneer & mixed veg. Tandoori roti wasnt as good as I expected but rest were yummy. This place is near my house so finally I have a place were I can have a good dining experience & home delivery facility.

A great place for all the veg lovers.  The place is very well maintained with cosy seating arrangements. The staffs are very polite and well behaved. I would like to visit once again. We tried dahi kebab, crispy chilli babycorn, roasted potato, kulcha, naan, singapore fried rice and manchurian. The manchurian was average. The babycorn was very tasty with all spices in right amounts. Dahi kebab was a new twist on the plate. It tasted nice. Overall, a great experience.

Let's start off by pointing out that this is a veg restaurant but nevertheless, this is a beautiful place. The menu is filled with various dishes to choose from, each being delicious in it's own way. I had Jeera Rice, Dal Makhhani and Schezwan Noodles. Though not a paneer fan, I actually liked the Crispy Paneer Babycorn available here as well. Every other dish were amazing and the overall experience inside the small yet beautiful place accompanied by the prompt service of the staff was vivid. This will be a treat for everyone who visits this place regardless of their food preferences.

A decent place to go and chill. Ambience is fairly satisfying. But indeed there is more scope for development. If you are looking for a place to just sit back and relax and enjoy food with your friends this place can solve the purpose. Easy to locate and not over crowded even on weekends. The service was fast and the staff was courteous. Everything was fine. It was a good dinning experience.

I have been to this place twice now .Being non vegetarians, I n my husband hardly go to any pure vegetarian restaurants. I like only home cooked vegetarian but my husband is a hardcore non vegetarian foodie . Hence it was a complete surprise for me that he actually loved the food and enjoyed it enough for us to visit back to back in the same week !
 As for me, I still have the taste of the tomato Dhania shorba lingering on my taste buds .Just loved it ! Their tandoori malai broccoli is one of its kind and has this amazing aroma and flavour which engulfs you completely and you just feel like having the entire plate yourself ! Apart from this the Pahadi paneer kabab and haryali paneer kababs are delicious ..cheese kulcha is a must try !the desserts also won't disappoint you !
Ambience is nice ..decor is very well done highlighted by beautiful classy chic modern lamps . 
 If it can appeal to a hardcore non vegetarian like my husband, I would safely recommend everyone to try. The second visit was for my grandmom's birthday and we were even assisted with her wheelchair. Owner is friendly and helpful and staff is courteous. Will definitely return soon to try their Chinese ,but yes even then would definitely have the tomato shorba and broccoli even if it doesn't go with Chinese main course !lol üëçüèªüòÄ

I had ordered dinner from The Copper Kitchen last night via Swiggy. 
   I ordered Dal Makhni and kadhai paneer and both were yum. They were not very spicy, it was like having good taste with less spice. The breads were a bit smaller in size but then it was really soft. 
My favourite would be Pudina Paratha and Masala Kulcha. 
  It was pocket friendly as well. Wouldn't mind trying this place again. :)

The food though is good enough for a decent restaurant. I had ordered dal makhni and paneer butter masala along with various breads. The breads especially pudina paratha was good and so was the dal. Garlic naam could though he improved with more garlic and butter. Overall a decent experience to have and I wouldnt mind ordering food again from here.

This is my first review and I am sorry for the fact that it has to be a negative one. I had made an order which was due for delivery at around 9.45pm, but as it was not delivered till 10.40pm, I had to cancel the same. Upon the initial delay, I was assured that the order would be delivered within 5-10 minutes and I had to followup the same, first with zomato and then with the restaurant. 
After one or two calls, during which I was assured that the order was despatched and i would be receiving it at the earliest, the restaurant refused to attend any of my further calls. I had even contacted the zomato customer care, which requested me not to cancel the order as they would take care of the same and ensure faster delivery. I had guests come over, who had to bear the trouble of waiting for so long. At around 10.40pm when it seemed that the order would not be delivered, I had to cancel the order. I was embarrassed to have kept my guests waiting for so long. If this is the way zomato handles food delivery, then I urge that no orders should be made through zomato, as the customer may be let down in the time of need.

A quaint little place close to Bangur Hospital with a warm ambience and friendly, courteous staff. And above all, delicious food that's super pocket-friendly.

A group of us, old college friends (all vegetarians!) , decided to give this new place a try last Sunday for a late lunch.
We ordered Jeera Tamatar Dania Shorba (don't go by the name, it had the perfect amount of seasoning!), Tandoori Mushrooms, and Tandoori Malai Broccoli to start with. The Tandoori Malai Broccoli is a must try! (however much you might roll your eyes, dear non-vegetarians!) Needless to say we ordered more of it.

For mains, we tried Hyderabadi Shufta, Paneer Begum Bahar, and Dal Tadka with Garlic Naan and Cheese Kulcha. The dal and naan were decent, nothing out of the ordinary. But the rest put this place right up my revisit list!
For the Hyderabad Begum Bahar, expect a semi-gravy mixed vegetable curry cooked in some special, secret, ground spices that make it a balanced, flavourful dish (that we ended up wanting more of.) And the Paneer is a slightly sweet, and spicy preparation of super fresh, juicy, soft malai paneer in a thick tomato-based gravy (that I'm craving for lunch again!)
The quality and taste of the food were a real pleasant surprise and the bill at the end of the meal was a surprising low for the food high we were all on!
The Copper Kitchen takes budget eating up several notches and will save you from your mid-month cravings and fast-emptying-wallet woes. It's not fancy fine dining, but the food could well have been served out of a higher priced, fancier restaurant.
Tollygunge has a new, small friendly neighborhood restaurant that serves absolutely delicious food and for me, made travelling from Alipore worth it!

We were 7 people and took lunch at this place. 

Ambience :We liked the ambience and sitting arrangements. It is small place just started 4 months ago. 

Location : On Russa Road 2nd lane just after Prince Anwar Shah Road Crossing with Despran Sasmal Road. Second lane after the crossing on the left on going towards Tollygunge. 

Food: Awesome food @ best value for money pricing.

We had ordered for starters 
1. Tandoori Malai Broccoli 
2. Tandoori Bhuna Aloo
3. Manchow Soup

In main course we ordered 
1. Veg. Fried Rice
2. Chilli Garlic Noodles 
3. American Chopsuey 
4. Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice 
5. Veg. Manchurian 
6. Roasted Papad

About the starters both the Tandoori items was mind blowing. Specifically Tandoori Malai Broccoli. Soo soft soo tasty. Just Like butter.... The Tandoor Bhuna Aloo was also tasty.

In main course all items were served hot and ultimate tasty. We enjoyed the place the food to the fullest. 
I must recommend a visit to this place. 

When the Manager provided us with the bill it was daammm cheap. They provided us with 10 percent discount too. Unbelievable what a fine afternoon and lovely time we spend at this place.

Running a pure veg restaurant in Kolkata is a big ask, but then they have used this as an advantage. Soothing ambience, good service, and most importantly, great food(taste, texture and looks wise), hence the smaller than average portion sizes don't hurt. Can improve on the tandoori rotis though. Garlic naan is really nice.

Been here with Friends for a Sunday Brunch,  the place is artistically decorated with a great theme based touch. The menu items were reasonably priced in fact the portions served were value for money. We started with Tandoori Malai Broccoli and Tandoori Mushroom Tikka,  Hariyali Paneer Tikka,  the Broccoli was the best i have tasted so far,  we complimented the owner for their signature dish. It is a must try for anyone visiting the place,  the mushrooms were good too, the quality of the paneer in the tikka was awesome it didn't take any effort to dig into it. For main course we had Hyderbadi Vegetable Shufta, Paneer Begum Bahar and Dal Makhani along with Garlic Naan,  Cheese Kulcha and Jeera Rice. The @Hyderbadi Shufta was simply delicious,  same goes for Cheese Kulcha,  we could even have it without the veggies,  so soft and tasty. The sumptuous meal ended with brownie and the sinful dessert was a treat in itself. All in all we had a wonderful time as the group enjoyed a great get together with a equally great meal.  Thumbs up to the team for their great effort.

I went there seeing the rating of 4 plus. I must say that I was thoroughly disappointed. The main door was closed, the side entrance was dark and slippery.

Upon entering the decor was pleasant and you guys have done a good job with the interiors. However I noticed flies. 

Tandoori platter was a good concept, but the portion was small. The tandoori aloo smelt stale. It was also half bakes. Imagine eating a raw potato. 

Alu dum was sweet, yes sweet. It could have been better, less sweet and with a hint of ginger and garam masala spice. 

Sweet corn soup was hot and tasty, perhaps one of the highlights of the evening. 

Tandoori roti was okay. Yellow dal was tasty. However it was filled to the brim and was spilt while serving. 

My plates got cleared before my last morsel was consumed. So this is more of a waiter training etiquette. 

No western dishes were available. Some of the Indian dishes were also not available. 

The used dishes were stacked up in view of the visitors which can be avoided. 

Overall an avoidable experience unless you guys put in a massive effort to work on the suggestions. 

Thank you.

For main course we had cheese kultcha and one mix veg kinda thing, though i dont remember the proper name. I would update the exact name when i go their next time. Main course was also good.

I visited this place easy to locate. I like ambience here... quite hygienic, excellent seating arrangement.
Here i tried as starter 'Paneer Hariyali Tikka' and in main course Veg jhalfrezi, kadhai paneer, vegetable rice, Masala Kulcha.
I found all these cuisines are nice in taste.
Reasonable price light on pocket.
Waiting time is less.
Nice courteous staff.
Keep it up "The Copper Kitchen" Team :-)

Dropped by last Saturday afternoon. It is a part of a hotel or at least seems so. The space is generous to fit in 20 25 people. After we took a seat we started deciding on the menu. To be honest, I am delighted with the food of this pure vegetarian restaurant. I opted for this place solely viewing the reviews on zomato where non vegetarian people were quite impressed with the food. 
We ordered the Tandoori Malai broccoli for starters and it is great. For the main course we settled for Garlic nun, Paneer butter masala and the cheese kulcha which was recommended by the waiter. I want to thank him for his suggestion. I loved them all. 
The staff was polite and friendly. It is quite light on the pocket as well. 
I am not giving it a 5 rating just because I cannot applaud the ambience much but it was fair. Great food :)

I was staying in Tollygunge and had almost given up looking for Restaurants serving North Indian vegetarian food in the area. Once this place popped up in the Zomato search and after heeding it's rave reviews plus the awesome Menu, I decided to give it a shot. As soon as I entered the place , i was given amazingly warm welcome by the manager itself. The staff was absolutely courteous as well. Beautifully decorated Ambience is icing on the cake. Though I couldn't have tandoori malai broccoli, I suggest you to try it for sure. I had tandoori mushroom tikka and rajma here, found them upto the expectations. Must visit. A hidden gem in south Kolkata.

Pure out of this world vegetarian food. Being a  relatively new joint it mostly serves North Indian flavours. The courteous staff and perfectly lit place is perfect for your dinner plans. There are a few must-have dishes on the menu but tandoori malai broccoli  and the cheese kulcha shouldn't be missed. Keep up the good work.

I have been to this place twice now. During my first visit I had tried my hands on their Indian Cuisine and Chinese on the second. I will have to say that both of it were absolutely amazing. Their food quality and preparation is really really nice.
Service time is also pretty quick. The place is little small, but very much tidy and clean.
Another good thing is its a purely vegetarian restaurant which is not easy to look around for.

Highlights
Tandoori Broccoli - ( I can bet you would not have anything like this anywhere in cal, its to die for)
Manchow Soup
Vegetables in Hunan Sause
Indian too was very delicious.

One thing that I did not like much was the hakka noodles and the fried rice, i think a lot more could have been done to make it different and more tempting.

All in all, its a fab place and not at all a pocket pincher.

Kudos to the team.

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian foodie i do like vegetarian foods, it‚Äôs not like that i always eat non-vegetarian dishes,by if you ask me what is your favorite then i will answer non-vegetarian.not only non-vegetarian dishes side by side i always eat vegetarian foods, there are some selective places which i really like to eat vegetarian foods. recently i and my fellow foodie friends are¬†invited to a restaurant over a food tasting session. it was a¬†vegetarian joint, i was really excited after entering inside the restaurant. the decoration is massive,different types of stylish & beautiful lighting effects illuminated entire restaurant. interiors are quite classy as well as the¬†ambiance. located near Tollygunge,walking distance from Russa Road,ground floor section of Hotel Myra. we all are welcomed there by the management of the restaurant.

The name itself defines the quality of the place.
Well the best place to be with friends family n couples too..
The best part about the kitchen is that it's a pure veg restaurant serving delicious food items n such soothing dim light ambience..
I have experienced both fast food n main course..n I must say that it really creates a benchmark for all others now.
Foods must have out there are:
Paneer Tikka
Roasted Mushroom
Manchao Soup
Brocolli
Fried Rice n Munchurian
Cheese Tandoor..is awesome
Do order cheese items n Chinese...they are best at it 
The place serves you it's best with cleanliness n quality, plating of food was beautifully done, n yes it does come with fast service.
Don't forget to have lime soda!!
Well done n keep up with the quality.

"The Idea is to serve the people who wants pure veg food in Tollygunge area" - The partners who created this fantastic kitchen style restaurant at heart of south Kolkata.

The hand crafted ambience gives a very personal feelings while dining with family or in couple. The staffs are polite and best part is the owners are extra careful about the customers.

You'll find best in class veg food like #cheesebroccolikabab #masala alu kabab, & last but not the least mouth watering Indian dishes Like #Dalmakkhani #CheeseKulcha.

In short, all the dishes over there are exotic and finger licking like. Specially Shreyansh, the owner himself is wonderful person.

The only veg fine dining restaurant available in Tollygunge area. It's located at Hotel Myra in Russa road. The interior is unique and it sticks to it's name giving itself a Royal feeling. The place is cosy and perfect for families. Service is good and the waiters are trained well. I had Tandoori Malai Broccoli which was crispy and juicy. The Spring Roll was delicious. Next we had penne pasta which was also nice. The rates are easy on pocket and you would always wish to try something new here. The menu is full of variety. Overall it was totally worth it. Must recommended place for everyone.

If I had an option to rate this place 10 out of 5, I would have done that. Let me tell you the best things about this place!
You enter - What an Ambience! Lighting, tables, decor and everything is just wow!

You sit - Courteous staff. I would also like to mention that the staff knows the menu very well. They will help you with your order and will make sure it's served Hot on your table.

When you wait for your food: You can only admire the lights, the sense of admiration, crockery they put on your table, it felt like I was dining at the best place in town. 

When the food arrives: Just don't wait! Eat that food. Everything we ordered was par excellence. I have been to hundreds of restaurants but this place has a different yet the best taste in this city. A MUST TRY!

The bill: This was icing on the cake. Extremely pocket friendly. Just amazing. 

P.S. : We loved the place sooo much we booked the place for a get together party of our college reunion for 25 people. 

This city needs more places like this!

I visited The Copper Kitchen last week and was so impressed with the versatility of the menu from Chinese to Indian to continental the place has it all. I tried the Hot and Sour Soup, Paneer Tikka, American corn pepper salt, dal makhni and garlic naan which was just delicious! But my favourite part was paneer butter masala, it was the best I have had! It's great ambience is just an added bonus. Overall it's an amazing place and a must try for all vegetarians!
