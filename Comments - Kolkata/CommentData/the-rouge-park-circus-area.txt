Nobody makes Red Velvet cupcakes better than them! The best pick obviously is one with the cream cheese frosting. Chocolate ganache frosting is good too. I also tried their macaroons, which weren't too great. It's a cute little cafe to spend time and the staff is also very courteous. Rouge needs to upgrade their menu.

Been here a few times. 
The cafe is small and cozy and very beautifully decorated. They're speciality is the red velvet cupcake and it does not disappoint. Although the size of the cupcake is pretty small the taste makes up for it. 
The chocolate cupcake and the cappuccino is also good. 
It isn't too light on the pocket and the cupcakes are highly priced. Would recommend for a small meet as the cafe is small.

I am reviewing this place solely on the basis of their red velvet products because i firmly believe this place serves the best red velvet products in the city of joy,be it the cupcakes,pastries or brownies they are just impeccable and when it comes to that cream cheese frosting its truly one of the best things i have ever tasted;Definitely a must try for every red velvet fan out there,the prices are on the higher side and let it be know they charge 10 rs for a paper bag.

A lovely small cafe known for their rouge/red velvet cupcakes, The Rouge should be on your wishlist if you are fond of pretty cakes and dainty desserts.

Having a dainty look of a chic and cute European cafe, with wallpapered walls, decoupage art, teapots, mirror-shaped cupcake wall ornaments, mugs, jars, and adorable-looking cakes adorning shelves, the bakery adds to the warmth of a cheerful autumn evening as much as the servers offer the warmest hospitality and cordial service.

I of course tried the red velvet cupcake with chocolate ganache (the other option is the cream cheese frosting) which was exquisitely delicious. Smooth and yummy, it was perfectly accompanied with hot cappuccino that was also well made. The delicate leaf latte art atop the coffee is worth the mention.

As far as bakery and desserts are concerned The Rouge need not jostle for a place among other well-known cake shops or dessert parlours in the city, but has been successful in carving a niche for itself and hopefully shall continue to satisfy guests/customers with their delightful sweet offeeings.

This was my first time here, I was very much impressed by the ambience of the place very soothing, cute and cup-cakie.
We tried red velvet cup cake, chocolove cup cake and some'more cup cake. Everything were super delicious, but I would like to mention that I didn't really feel the difference between chocolove and some'more cup cake except for the marshmallow touch.
All in all I loved it and will definitely visit again.

This place has always been in my bucket list but i finally got a chance to pay a visit over here. Situated in park circus ( even though i think its in theatre road ), nevertheless this small dessert shop is every dessert lover's dreams.

It was totally empty when we entered. The space is very small with 3 or 4 tables. You can see the counter when you enter and they sell various milkshakes and desserts. I ordered for a milkshake that has oreo and peanut butter. My friend ordered for a milkshake that uses any cupcake according to the customer's choice and preference. Both the drinks are absolutely good and delicious but however, the server did not blend mine too well so i was having difficultly in drinking mine. I told him and he fixed it. We also ordered for one white and pink macaroons. The macaroons are not that great over here as the pink one was a little bit soft and the white one was a bit okay.

A bit expensive. All of those costed rs509. But worth a visit.

Now that I have tried quite a lot of items from this bake shop , and everything is awesome , no flaw in a single thing , they make the miniest of cupackes and macroons and decorate them with utmost care and precision, i heartily recommend you to try this place out anytime you want to satisfy your sweet tooth. My personal favourites are the cheesecakes and red velvet cupcake with cream cheese. Located conveniently at Beck bagan crossing , easy to spot , and interior decorations mimic the fairy tale backgrounds with pink dominating over shades of pastel blue and yellow, floral prints and lots of colourful jars , mirrors and pots shelved on both sides with a central display of the Bakery goods , three tables and few seats as well as their packaging is great . Pricing is bit on higher side , but their quality is worth a buy , so do grab some goodies if nearbuy.

#FTTsays Walking on AJC Bose Road, you'll come across a quaint, little cafe with an attractive blue door. You will stare at the macaroons stand display and I swear you will be pulled right in. ‚ù§ The minute you enter you will see this old floral and vintage wallpaper all around with attractive bright blue and yellow colored frames hanging on the wall. And straight up you will find the baked goods on display! üòç This place doesn't feel like Kolkata. What is feels like is an old cafe in some old English town, which was revamped anew to keep up with the times. This cafe is truly a respite from the city life! 
Coming to the food, they sell mainly desserts here. We feel it sells the best cupcakes in town! Then there are cakes, cheesecakes, tarts, brownies, macaroons, eclairs, truffles, and shakes to choose from as well!
üç∞ The signature best seller here is the Red Velvet Cupcake. They serve it both with cream cheese and chocolate truffle. We chose the classic cream cheese one. The cupcake is so spongy, it bounces back as we were cutting into it. The cupcake was moist, the kind we enjoy, with ganache filling in the centre. And it was topped with the most well blended, light and fluffy cream cheese frosting ever! (We're or exaggerating! We challenge you! Try it!) üòã
üç∞ The next one we tried was the Nutty Professor. It's a chocolate cupcake with as the name suggests, a nutty flavour and texture to the cupcake. First of all, the cupcake was a mini, on top on being so super light, that it just dissolved into our taste buds! The frosting on top was a perfect blend of dark chocolate and cream topped with crunchy nuts! ü§§
üç∞ The next mini cupcake was called Rubus. It was a vanilla and raspberry based cupcake with raspberry filling and frosting. The combination was like a flavourful explosion in our mouths! 
üçπLastly, The Oreo Shake was simply milk, ice cream and Oreo chunks. Sounds simple, right? Nope! It's the thickest milkshake in town! "Slurpy" (it's an FTT made up word; derived from slurp üòú) is word! It came topped with whipped cream and Oreo biscuits! Each sip was filled with whipped cream and Oreo chunks, and was super satisfying. 
We left the place with nothing but a huge food belly, and ingrained with smiling faces! üòÅ

#FTTfact The statistics for cupcakes consumed in one sitting is: 29 cupcakes in 30 seconds! üò±

I've never been to the place. Got red velvet cupcakes delivered from here via Swiggy. It was a total disheartening experience. I felt too disgusted on opening the box. The frosting of the cakes got all messed up. But the taste quite made up for it. I would  rather visit the place next time..never ordering again.

With an ideal location, occupying a comfortable corner on the bustling AJC Bose Road. It is a definite delight to chat up over cupcakes and Coffee at this place. It has a grand reputation for pioneering the red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting in this part of the City. Also, the Chocolate Cupcakes are very moist. Cheesecake is a little overrated.
The d√©cor is lovely and very Western classical pieces are used to pep up this patisserie. The ambiance is comfortable and cosy. Evenings are great spent here.
Service is a little slow.
It is a deeper did into your pockets.
But surely try out the cupcakes they are still one of the good ones.

This pretty little cake shop is located right opposite La Martiniere School campus , at Beckbagan, and is a two minutes drive away from Park Circus Arsalan. The interiors of this cake shop look cute as a button , with a mirror on the wall that will remind you of Snow White's tale. They have small chairs with round tables , and one wall is decorated with messages written on tissue papers to express gratitude towards this tiny wonderland. The Red Velvet Cupcake here tastes divine , with white chocolate cream on top of a deliciously well baked Red Velvet Cake. It is a must try item on their list of tiny sweet somethings. The Raspberry Cheesecake has a layer of Raspberry jam on top of a thick layer of Cheesecake, and a thin biscuit base at the bottom. It tastes amazing too. The   restaurant is self serve , so take your pretty somethings before you reach the table . Of you're a Red Velvet person, you just can't miss this place!

Food - A cute little place for the sweet toothed. Flavours are really good and tasty. We tasted the red velvet cream cheese and chocolate hazelnut cupcakes which were real yummmm! Nutty praline is also a must try here. Macaroons are famous here. I personally not being a macaroni lover tasted only the coffee macaroni. 

Ambience - Such a cute place to visit. A small outlet for 10 people approx. 

Service - Attendants are such well mannered. Lovely service. 

Rates - A bit high compared to other bakeries. But is worth it. But appropriate rates for party cakes.

However, options should be more diverse and the menu definitely needs expansion and more variety.

Verdict: the brownie was okay ,a bit hard for my liking have had better.. the red velvet cupcake with cream cheese topping was an absolute delight.. it was soft moist and very very tasty..
Both of these babies added to a billing of 190 rs..

The decor of The Rouge is really sweet even though it's not spacious enough. This place serves dainty pastries and desserts. I'd tasted my first red velvet cake here, 3 years ago, and from then their 'Red Velvet with Chocolate Truflle' has been my all time favourite. I'll never ever get over it.
I love their mousse as well.
But somehow I wasn't pleased by their Milk Chocolate Praline Cheesecake. It was very dry.
The Rouge will always be a favourite bakery of mine.

There are two types of varieties in cupcakes, the regular and the mini. The Mini are the cute looking ones, and worth a try. Apart from this they offer a variety of Macaroons. These are small but flavourful.¬†

Hello Visitors and my dear friends..¬†

When I entered this place, the first thing you see is cupcakes. Easily located with great ambience. I had tasted an orange panna cotta and the must have The Rough (Red Velvet Cake). Orange Panna Cotta was not bad but the Rough just took away my heart. Thanks Rough for the lovely experience.

Also, the Nutty Professor is a must try too :)

The only thing to improve is staff service. The no of service should be more to cater the needs at the very moment.

Delicious Rouge :)

This bakery is located just at the turning of Beck Bagan. It's a pretty little cafe with a very cute ambiance. Loved the interiors a lot. Coming to the pastries we had tried their red velvet with cheese cream cup cake. They were simply amazing. Staffs were courteous too.

Awesome cupcakes.. Fav is the cheese red velvet cake and Choco love cupcake. Their macroons are super cute and delicious.. Only that their sizes could be a little bigger. Their packaging is also very sturdy.  Loved their decor.. The store is easy to locate also.. The behaviour of the staff is really generous and their service is also really quick.. 

Overall, loved the cakes to bits..

It's a very small cozy place with not a lot of place to sit but a great food. Rouge never upsets you. I am a big fan of their macaroons and little cup cakes. Their desserts are to die for. But you cannot expect a takeaway cake from this place. You shall have to preorder it. Limited stocks

I had bookmarked this caf√© and finally gave a visit today.
Pretty little caf√© with hardly a seating for 12 people.
The red velvet with cream cheese cupcake really lived up to my expectations. Perfectly moist and soft, proper balance of sweetness with the cream cheese.. it was heavenly! Probably really the best in town!
Raspberry Macaroon was good but very tiny. A bottle cap size macaroon for ‚Çπ40!
Staffs were well behaved except their way of presenting the bill. The other customer got a basket where they could leave their payment but we were only given the bill with no idea where to leave the payment.
Only let-down is the price. Otherwise it deserves a 4.0!
Definitely coming back to try the other stuffs. In my wishlist, creme brulee, tarts and the other macaroons.

This cute little bakery is located just opposite the back gate of La Martiniere for Girls on the turn on the road. It doesn't seat too many people and is in the smaller side but the interiors are cute and appropriate. We ordered the classic Rouge cupcake, an Oreo cupcake, a green tea and a Banana Split milkshake. The regular sized cupcakes are priced at 100 each which is a little expensive considering they aren't very big. The Rouge is a red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting and is the best thing on the menu. The Oreo cupcake tastes almost like a regular chocolate cupcake with half an Oreo on top. The icings are especially delicious. The milkshake was a big let down - 199 before taxes and it tasted extremely average. We didn't even end up finishing it and I'm a big advocate for not wasting. All in all it's a decent experience - conveniently located and many "social media worthy" pictures can be taken but I wouldn't say it's the best place for cupcakes in the city.

A tiny little place at the end of AJC Bose road, straight right to Lamartine for girl's school. The place is small and old(the decorative items one the Window needs some attention) but serves delicious deserts. One of the desert places that has sitting options as well , though not large enough.

Went in there to try eclair for the first time but it was not available and was told that it is made specifically when preordered.

Comming to the cup cakes, its brilliant the best I have tried till now, fresh delicious as it should be. Tried the choco love and red velvet choco ones, the red Velvet was claas apart. Though was unhappy with the size, the mini ones are half the price of normal ones but 1/4th the size.

Tried macaroons the coffe flavoured and hazelnut ones. It was cute little ones and tasted great. 
I also tried an orange based mousse called panacotta which was ok, fresh but not amazing like previous two options.

The best part about this places is that the prices on the menu is inclusive of taxes and you don't pay extra over the menu prices which I hate in other places. Highly recommended that a larger sized macaroon be served and mini sizes to be not that mini.

I've only been to rouge once, which was roughly 3 years back and all I remember from that visit is "wow, this place is small, but hey! It's cute" after which I've always preferred to order cupcakes from rouge and have them at the comfort of my own home.

I've tried two cupcakes and loved them so much that I don't experiment with my order more, the red velvet cupcake which has a chocolate ganache in the middle and is moist yet crumbly, the best part is the icing which is perfectly sour just what goes with red velvet. The second cupcake I eat is the creme Br√ªl√©e cupcake which is amazing. 

The items here are slightly on the expensive side, but there is no lack of taste in the food.

Okay so this place in short if i m asked to say, then it is too costly, and the quantity or the size of the cakes are not worth the price that you pay for it..the macarons are of the size of that of coins.. Even the taste is nothing extra special, so if you are planning to visit this place,visit only if You are not searching for a pocket friendly place.. Nothing much special about this place..

Rouge is a teeny weeny patisserie in my locality. I was greatly impressed by the decor which was visible from outside. From inside the place is not so spacious but cosy.
They have got a few items on their menu and all of them are sweet which goes well for me but it is a little heavy on your pocket.
The cupcakes coming for 50 bucks is too small in contrast with the cupcakes priced 100 bucks.
Their signature Rouge aka the ref velvet is one of a kind if not the best in the city.
But I have taken quite a liking for it.
The classic chocolate cupcake with dark chocolate ganache is yet another stellar addition to the menu. The macaroons are pretty amazing too.

The Rouge,located near beckbagan bus stop, is a cute little cafe which offers some yummy and delicious sweet items. It can hardly fill a couple of handful people. My sole intention was to have red velvet cupcakes but besides that i also took the following:
Red velvet creamcheese cupcakes(regular/large size)
Macaroons(chocolate,coffe and hazelnut flavour)
Cheesecake(chocolate cheesecake)
Brownies(red velvet brownie and chocolate brownie)

Red velvet cupcakes- they come in two sizes(small and regular/large). The small ones are way too small so if you want to get the full flavour i would suggest to go for the regular/large sizes. The cupcakes are really soft,yummy and delicious. The balance of the cream cheese was good. I loved it.

Macaroons- the macaroons are small in size. Its texture was good. Soft inside and crunchy at the outside. I loved it also.

Chocolate Cheesecake- this one was also good in taste. It was soft and creamy. Comparing the price,the cheesecake is a bit small in size.

Brownies- the brownies also comes in two flavours- red velvet and chocolate. Both were okhayish. The chocolate brownie was better than the red velvet one. Though the red velvet brownie was soft but it lacked  texture and that delicious brownie flavour.

Overall i loved this cafe and the red velvet cupcakes. I will surely visit this place to try their shakes amd try the other items as well.

The rouge is a tiny place for ppl who want to satisfy their sweet tooth. The place I think could hv been a tad bigger. The best thing is their red velvet cake with cream cheese. I think it's d best I've had in Kolkata. But it comes in 2 sizes. The one for rs 50 is like half the size of a table tennis ball I wud say and the one for rs 100 was 4 times larger than the small one. I felt it's a strategy to make ppl buy the larger one but I felt this was a little unfair. Also I felt since they hv a proper menu nd seating arrangements they should add few savory dishes to d menu as the menu only has desserts in it

Kolkata means Sweets , being a Bengali I always take pride in the best Mishti available across the globe . Today I found this small place who specializes in Cupcakes and macaroons . The best I have ever tasted . For all the sweet lovers , please visit this place and I bet you will immediately fall in love with the cuteness of this place. My personal favorite is the Red Velvet Cupcake and the Creme Belle . Also do try the Oreo milk shake .

The first thing that would strike one when you pass by this patisserie cafe is the macaroons mountain decorating the display window. This is a just a sneak peak to all the lovely goodies in stock. 

This place has heavenly cupcakes, macaroons, tarts and cakes. Recently they have stocked up on savoury goods also.


The Raspberry, mocha and chocolate macaroons are my favourites. Don't go on the colour while deciding on the flavour it's always better to ask the attendant. The macaroons are just superb crunchy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside.

They make the best red velvet cake in Kolkata. Be it the texture of the cake or the cheese cream icing. It's just perfection. 

The cupcakes available in mini and normal versions are available in many flavours.

I ordered the following cupcakes
The nutty professor
Red velvet 
Eggless chocolate cupcake
Creme brulee

And assorted macaroons

Each and everything here is good. A regular cupcake with all the icing can be a bit too much for one person to finish. I prefer sharing so I can try more flavours each time.

The regular packaging available here is so good that the cupcakes and macaroons make great gifting options.

They were as amazing as expected and totally loved them though the rates were a little higher than expected but nothing too much. Totally worth a second visit.

Some of the best cupcakes in town. They customizes according to your fancies, such a great gift idea. I had them customized for someone's baby shower, and they were very well appreciated. The guy over there very happily communicated on whtasapp and I sent him images I had downloaded from the Internet and he could manage to do very similar ones for me. And the red velvet cupcake is totally out of the world. I am so glad zomato offers delivery, it's my savior every time I need to gift something and am short on time. A big thumbs up!!

 Delicious Red Velvet Cupcake and I recently tried Oreo cupcake which was also great . The cupcakes are so moist and soft with beautiful dressing  on top.
The macaroons are very average, not that chewy. 

Overall they serve one of the best cupcakes in town so if you're in the mood to indulge in some  heavenly cupcakes , do give it a shot !

We have not met anyone till date who is not fond of Cupcakes. We, on the other hand, have a very different relationship with the humble Cupcakes. The kind of connection that can't be explained, the one's that stay forever? Oh, you get it. Good Cupcakes make us cry out of happiness. We've been looking for the perfect Cupcakes here in Kolkata after having the best ones in Mumbai (post coming up soon) and we stopped our search at our old favorite, The Rouge. Their Cupcake spread is impressive with exciting flavours like "The Rupus" (made with raspberry extract), "Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e" (one of the best) and "Lemon" (so fresh and yum)! Their Red Velvet Cup Cake though is a little doughy, we felt. We like our Cupcakes crumbly and fluffy and they have exactly that, with not a hint of artificial flavors. We are not fond of fondant as topping for our cakes and thank heavens they don't use them. The prices would pinch your pockets a bit (Rs.35/45 plus tax for the tiny ones) but then who's complaining when these little bundles of joy can turn any dull day exciting!‚ú®

I had the s'more, creme brulee and the coffee mini cupcakes too. They were amazing. The creme brulee in particular was so good , because the icing had been blowtorched and had the exact flavour of the cream br√ªl√©e. I also had the chocolate truffle slice and the milk chocolate cheesecake and both were good. The cheesecake had bits of chocolate in between. The truffle cake was really rich and delicious. It is definitely one of my favourite places for cupcakes.

It's a tiny, cute little bakery situated at beckbagan.
The interiors are very tastefully done.
Went there all alone and regretted not bringing alone my special one.
The red velvet cupcake with its light cream topping was sinfully sweet!
But what really made my day was the cheesecake!
Literally the best one I had ever had!
A bit overpriced undoubtedly but the taste is worth it!

I came for the cheesecake and got to chose from the 3 varieties of the day (choc, raspberry & blueberry). All 3 were FABULOUS! I will be looking out for the other varieties.

The place looks lovely and feels cosy, the door especially made me feel like I was entering Hogsmeade üòÑ

It is however a little more pricy then other bakeries. I wanted to try some of the cupcakes but they were really small for their price. All in all it was worth the trek though.

Just had my first piece of confectionary from this outlet and I must say that I simply loved it. It is slightly pricy but given the quality of food you get, one can say with ease that the price paid is worth it. It is not just the cakes themselves but the packaging that accompanies it as well which simply puts a smile upon one's face. I had ordered the Blueberry Cheese Cake and it was yum, straight out of the bat. Would be visiting it again for The Rogue has got an admirer in me now.

Ordered cupcakes via Swiggy and thoroughly disappointed with the way they were packed and delivered. It looked less like cupcakes and more like a mess. If you want to position and maintain yourself as a premium bakery in Kolkata then instead of merely focussing on a fancy name and the other trappings, concentrate on delighting the customer both through quality of your food & delivery/packaging. Until then to me I ll always rue this order from rogue!

Looks like a doll's house , albeit a grown up doll with a taste for pink. Practically everything here is pink , which can take some getting used to. Notable solely for its cupcakes , they do make them pretty well. However , its 100 bucks a pop , which is expensive for a fist-sized cupcake. Star item : Red Velvet Cupcake. Located behind a premier South Kolkata school , I'm sure it draws girls by hordes.

Went last Friday and have to say I was kind of disappointed. The interior decoration is very cute but it's in need of maintenance. 
Now the food, I ordered the red velvet (with cream cheese), s'more, chocolate with chocolate truffle and the key lime cupcakes. All the cupcakes were pretty good and I especially loved the red velvet one. However it seems a lot of the items I saw on the menu in Zomato are no longer available. For instance I really wanted to try the √©clairs, but they said they don't have any and I didn't see any on the menu. 
Also I had a clean brown boy (I know that sounds dirty and racist but that's actually a hot chocolate drink topped with whipped cream) which was honestly quite bland and not nearly chocolatey enough to be called a hot chocolate. 
Yeah pretty disappointed.

A slice of cake for 110/-........!! Wow. 
 Tarts and mousse tasted good.......
You seriously need to change your staff.......I saw a man coming in and chatting with them and he asks for a glass of water with ice cubes in it............after he leaves I ask for a glass and they get a 1 litre overpriced mineral water bottle......... üòõüòõ

Absolute rubbish desserts. Over expensive, no value for money. Placed an online order and the wrong order was delivered. The brownie seemed as if it was made 14 days ago. Most definitely the worst desserts had in a long long time. Stay away from this place!

This was the first place I hit with my college peeps when I first joined college. Near my college, a pretty little bakery dessert place. what more could I ask for? The macaroons were so tempting and has many varieties. We ordered a hot chocolate with whipped cream, and they served a huge cup of it. Who would have been sad about that? *_* last but not least, had to get my hands on the mini cupcakes with delicious frosting, and a brownie .. overall experience for me 4.5/5
Please, it's a request for the authority to change the macaroons piece of decoration, because from outside it looks attractive but from the inside it comes out to be shabby, worn out, and dirty. Otherwise loved it.

Which place let's you wait for a friend for 1.5 hours? This little place does. To be honest, it's quite a famous desert parlour which was in my bucket list for a while. As for the decor goes, it's not very sassy or doesn't look too pink overboard. But like a British tea house maybe. There's not enough space for more than 3-4 tables. About food, we had to try to red velvet cupcake. And trust me, I have tried it at different places. But this has to be the best. Very moist, and smooth. Not very sweet. And tastes very fresh. 
We also tried the Pineapple panacota, which we didn't like. But the chocolate mouse was extra ordinary. The dark chocolate shavings on rich chocolate mouse. A big thumbs up for this place. 
P.s. they don't even charge tax. 
It's right next to my office, hence I know where I shall spend my evenings ;)

Located in the corner of AJC Bose Road, opposite to La Martinere for Girls back gate.
Though the location is a disadvantage as the area outside is occupied by the hawkers and nobody would like to see a paanwala while eating Cup cakes.¬†Though, once inside it it becomes a quiet cosy little place.¬†

Red Velvet with Cheese frosting is the hot rage out here. Very well made. One of the best in town. But the bigger version, the Red Velvet cake is pure heaven.

A little pinch to the pocket. But you do pay for good quality.

Heard soo much about the red velvet cupcake of this place, how could I not pay my respect to it.

After 2yrs of staying in Kolkata, finally managed to get a taste.

Location: Very bad location, biggest disadvantage. Exteriors of the bakery is crowded and extremely dirty. ( even though it's a part of the street, it's also a part of the parlour)

Ambience: it's a cute cosy beautiful place, you can spend hours Jus gossiping with your loved ones.
It can house max 10 people which would be almost crowding upüòí

Ordered: 
Red Velvet Cupcake with Cheese Frosting, I have tried this particular delight almost everywhere but never has it tasted this good. Soft, Fresh, the lil chocolaty taste, all made it Sinful. And if that was not enough the frosting, "don't ask or read, Just go and taste". Guys if you go here, this is compulsory!!

Creme Br√ªl√©e: Hahaaa.. Perfection, I am heading here soon for another of this. I don't even feel like describing cos it might not live up to the taste ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Service: just one staff, first I thought he was very frustrated. But later I found him to be very polite and humble.

Pocket Pinch: A lil high, but for the taste, you could indulge once in a while!!

Sadly Tiramisu wasn't available, which i wanted to try.

The place is beautifully decorated like that of a fairy tale with pink wallpapers and little mirrors on the wall, reminding you of Snow White! The space is too cramped to allow for more than 4-5 people, but once you manage a seat, the ambiance is nice, and so is the decor for taking numerous selfies (the people seated there were anyway doing that). 
I had ordered for a take-away and the list included Macaroons and a Milk Chocolate Praline Cheescake. 

None of them were at all close to what I was expecting. The macaroons are too small and yet the price is comparatively high. They do not even have the proper taste of macaroons. All the flavours more or less taste the same, and are too sweet. The Cheesecake was comparatively better than the Macaroons, but not up to the mark. The milk and the cheese ratio was just not good enough. 

I do not wish to go back to the shop, in spite of the high rating in Zomato, unless I just want to get some comfort from the scorching sun.

Why bother deliverying when you dont know how to pack it. Ridiculous. Come on guys, step up!

Ordered oine through Zomato, and got a prompt delivery. However, once i opened it, was shocked to see the cupcake was attempted to be kept in plave using tissue paper! Needless to say, that didnt work out too well.

This old but famous outlet on Park Street is very synonymous with Kolkata's heritage!
I had been here ages ago but I wanted to try out their famous cup cakes, so after dropping my wife at the Parlour, I stepped inside for a bite of some¬† mini cup cakes & a cup of tea.

Even though much hasn't changed,it was a good few minutes spent!

Can spent quite and enjoyable time with your best buddies and can speak your heart out to your loved one.

Was actually pretty disappointed by the size of the cupcakes, as well as the taste. The mini cupcakes are even smaller than the ones served at magpie, but the taste not even half as good in comparison. The cold coffee was very unsatisfactory in taste and amount for the price. The tea ok. Macaroons ok. Thing is, after spending such amounts on the items, neither the taste buds nor my stomach was satisfied. I for one, love desserts, and wouldn't mind spending, if the taste touches me. But like I said, this place has seriously disappointed me.

This place is a dream. My favourite has always been their red velvet cream cheese. 

#musttry#foodtherapy 

The cupcake is moist and gooey . The best part of this treat is in the centre , which has dark chocolate filling. The dark chocolate filling can be replaced with cream cheese filling , on request. The cream cheese has just the right taste and right consistency. 

The place is done up like a doll house and definitely the cutest hangout in the city.

Was in that area and dying for a shot of caffeine to boost my spirit.It is just on the opposite footpath of the back gate of La Martinere for girls .

Opted for tea which came in pretty cups. The place has a collection of muffins but you only get specific 6 varieties on any given day and they are quite pricey, even if you go for their small ones which are actually tiny.....suited for children or for doll's tea party. The Rouge muffin was ok....nothing extraordinary, the toppings were too sweet at times.

If you are trying to bring back some muffins home then there is a minimum number of muffins which you need to buy.I bought 6 minis and they cost around 400-500. 

I was telling myself that it would have been better had we walked backwards a bit and gone into Kookie Jar or Cakes in Rawdon street.

It is all right if you want to have tea only and hang out with your friends.

I am quite surprised with the rather low rating. I mean I expect it to atleast be more than 4! The Rouge is a beautiful little dessert shop located at a rather unflattering place but it still looks wonderful! I had gone with a few of my friends and we tried lots of different items. I had originally prepared the following 'To eat' list -
1.Cupcakes
a.Red Velvet with Cream Cheese
b.Chocolate Raspberry
c.Key Lime
d.Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e
2.Tarts
a.Chocolate
b.Salted Caramel
3.Chocolate Brownies
4.Tiramisu
5.Panacotta
6.Macaroons
a.Raspberry
b.Coffee
c.Chocolate
7.Chocolate Pastry Cream Choux
8.Cheese Cake
9.Chocolate Truffes
Sadly quite a few items weren't available which is one of the reasons why I only give a 4!

Coming to what we got to try :
The cupcakes were all really really delicious. I loved the creme Br√ªl√©e cupcake a lot! My only complaint is that they were VERY VERY small! We ordered the red velvet cupcake with Cream Cheese frosting and I really liked it a lot. I am not quite fond of icings, but this cream cheese icing was very delicious!
The macaroons were also VERY small. They tasted quite nice but the cupcakes were better.
My favourite dish was the blueberry cheesecake. Oh my god! I have never had such a delicious cheesecake ever! It was hands down the best of the lot. We ordered another one. Again, the problem was that it was tiny and for 180 rupees! But unlike the cupcakes and macaroons, I did not mind paying so much because the taste was really really great.
We also ordered a chocolate brownie but it was quite ordinary and certainly the least impressive. I can assure you, I make better brownies than that! In saying that, I don't mean it's not good, all I think is that it's not at the same level as the other treats.

All in all, it's a wonderful place with really delicious desserts! My only complaint is that the prices are a bit too high whereas the quantity is a bit too less.
Nonetheless, it's definitely a must try! You don't want to miss out on this if you love desserts! Trust me :)

Lovely tiny place with good ambiance and of course amazing cupcakes . Tried the macaroons and the cupcakes which were great. My favourite was the cupcake which was dark chocolate topped with raspberry cream i think it was lil ms crazy . The mini cupcakes were actually quite "mini" however the latte on the other hand was served in a big coffee cup. I love cafes with good coffee, and rouge didn't disappoint. Service was fast and friendly. 
Great place to come with besties or your loved one.

Nice little joint, tucked away in a quiet corner in AJC Bose road, from outside it doesn't look like a bakery but inside it's quite nice and warm. Done in subtle pastel shades, mis matched chairs and lots of little showpieces. 
Inside there are hardly 6-9 chairs if I am not wrong, it's a small place but their pastries and cupcakes are super delicious! 
The coffee is nice and creamy, the Black Forest cake was just about okay, not that great but the red velvet cupcake was to die for! Smooth with a chocolate filling it completely melts in your mouth! Never ever have I tasted such a perfectly made red velvet cake in Kolkata for sure. It's the best if I am not wrong! 
Can't wait to go back and try their other desserts especially cupcakes. Staff looks disgruntled and disinterested most of the time but if the desserts are this good, I don't think I even care!

The red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting here is HEAVENLY. That and the decor make this place worth a visit,despite the fact that its a little costly. But then,cafes are mostly unnecessarily costly and there's no point whining over that.

The day we went the tiramisu and margharita cupcakes were missing,so we couldnt try out the items in the menu which happen to stand out. Settled for a lemon cupcake and some mocha cupcake which were pretty nice.
The cold coffee is very plain and not at all worth the price,dont get deceived by how pretty it looks.
Macaroons are too small for that price and nothing extraordinary.

To sum it up,dont miss the red velvet cupcake here! With cream cheese frosting,ofcourse.

P.S. : The staff seemed to be pretty confused,they forgot about some of the items that had been ordered,etc. Or maybe they were just having a bad day. :3

My brother recommended me this cute little place near La Martiniere for girls school...So checked the reviews here n dropped by to try their desserts :) As I stepped in I was quite impressed by their colorful decor..the selves kinda gave an English granny's kitchen vibe ... Pretty and cozy setting :)

We ordered blueberry cheesecake, chocolate and raspberry macaroons n Panna cotta.

The cheesecake was just out of this world!!! I SIMPLY loved it!! The macaroons were good..but the panna cotta was a huge disappointment !! Tasted like cake frosting !! Nothing like a good wobbly panna cotta..Was way too heavy on the palate!

Pocket pinch was high too..! So rating it 3 just for the cheesecake and the colorful decor.

If you love all things cute and elegant, then The Rouge is the place for you. I just love the macaroons here. So I brought my friend here after lunch for desserts. Although we planned to try their other desserts like Tiramisu and Panacotta, they were not available. Hence, the macaroons and cupcakes came to our rescue. Coffee, raspberry and chocolate hazelnut macaroons - we ordered these. They were like being just out of the world. I think that The Rouge serves the best macaroons in Kolkata. You have surely gotta come here for the macaroons only. We also ordered two mini cupcakes - red velvet cheese cake with two different kinds of frosting, cream cheese and butter cream. We didn't have place in our stomach to try more, so we had to stop here and try the mini sized cupcakes only. They were soft with the perfect balance of chocolate and the red tinge. The frosting was light yet creamy and delicious. You would start craving more and more for these after one.
The decor was cute, elegant. The floral wall with an elegant vintage mirror and those vintage looking wall hangings cheered up the look of the cafe. They also had provisions for writing messages or doodles in tissue papers and hang them from the shelves in the cafe. The furniture were comfortable, colourful and funny.
The staffs were sweet and courteous. There was a man at the counter who helped us out with the servings and took photos of me and my friend happily when we requested him to.
If you love bakes and all things cute, The Rouge is your place. It is definitely recommended and you have gotta come here. Happy Dining! :)

After lunch at Afraa deli today I came with my friend here to fulfill our dessert cravings.Since we were too full from lunch we couldn't try much from here.We asked for tiramisu and panacotta.We were told that they are not available.So we opted for macaroons and mini cupcakes.

Macaroons-They were amazing..like biteable sized pieces of heaven! We had the chocolate hazelnut, raspberry and coffee macaroons.All of them were top notch.The outer coating was so flaky with smooth yummy filling inside.I liked the chocolate hazelnut ones the most while my friend liked the coffee macaroon.I loved these so much that I packed some for home.

Red velvet mini cup cake-I opted for cream cheese frosting while my friend chose butter cream frosting.These were so good, light and the flavour of cream cheese was too good.

Looking forward to visiting this place many more times to try the other sweet treats.. :)

If nothing else, just go for the red velvet cupcake with cream cheese topping. You won't find anything like it. It's basically a cup of heaven. I decided to try other desserts (macaroons, chocolate pastry and cheesecake) with similar expectations; but they weren't really up to the mark.

A "Premium Cup Cake Store". This place mainly stocks cupcakes of different flavours, macaroons, pastries along with cold and hot beverages. Quality of the stuff is good but not out of the world. Also it has v less choices. Prices are high as the macaroons were v small. One can look forward for a bill of ‚Çπ 1000 ( 2 persons) for some pastries and coffee. Its good for dates where one tends to have a quality time with less crowd. Cheers..

grimm's proverbial candy house sans the man-eater

There's few things to enjoy in Rouge despite its flaws.The grand floral pink against a white backdrop with candy ordained glass facade overlooking the ajc bose flyover provides a cue to feel good even on a rough day.The bonhomie disposition continues with their offerings-the truffles and cupcakes jousting with souffles and macroons for attention.We ordered raspberry cheesecake,a red velvet cupcake and an assortment of macroons.It is when the goodies are served on table that an air of dissent settles in.You start to remember a particular cakeshop in jadavpur that serves red velvet cake with fondant(rogue serves with cheesecream),or one tiny boulangerie near ballygunge phari whose macroons now seem freakishly enormous-which could readily eat up the babies staring back at you. Pardon my French,but painting an unflattering picture then becomes too inevitable¬† as rouge's penchant for grand backdrops,impressive as they are,comes in the way of its confectionery firmament.To quote Herman Hesse,their effort then seems "merely artistic dilettantes given to improvisation and feckless fancy.."

What I am in no position to offer,but will say anyway is that Rouge needs to shift its focus from bon vivant ambience to old-style quantity driven business,if it looks to avoid triggering a backlash of unfulfilled expectations.The outlet in quest mall,for instance,has gone under the wraps,providing Rouge an unique urgency and also an opportunity to reinvent themselves.If they come out of their echo-chambers,they should become pervious to how their clientele feel about a dining experience at rouge,and that would be quite a start to making a few quick changes.And frankly,I believe to represent all the foodaholics of this gastromaniac city,when I say,we would¬† love to see this le-petit "candyhouse" survive an initial stumble and have the fairy tale live on.

The Blueberry Cheesecake was soft and airy with a beautiful compote on top, the red-velvet was just the way I like it with a luxurious cream cheese frosted upon. The macaroons were just about okay and so was the Darjeeling tea without milk. The place is cute with colourful interiors and all, but fails to surprise. The menu is decent and very run-of-the-mill. A nice place to have a quick cake with a coffee. The location is very convenient though. Not recommended for serious dessert lovers who can't do without their Creme Brulee.

Felt like having something sweet and chocolatey. This place was picked by my friend and it's nearby my house. There is not much to be said about the place, it's a small place with enough room to have 3-4 set of chairs and table for couples. However the cup cakes with had both chocolate based were really good. I found it wasn't the softest cupcakes I had but still they were really great with taste flavour and texture as well. The chocolate flavour wasn't to sweet in neither the bottom cake itself nor it was to much on the top. I would definitely recommend people have a look at this place for sure!!!

Very easy to locate... bang opposite to La Martiniere school for girls... a small place with classy deco... good seating arrangements... I went for a takeaway, opted there red velvet chocolate truffle and raspberry chocolate cupcakes and one almond tart, the tart was excellent but the cupcakes are good... whatever the staffs are very friendly... service was quick... pocket pinch was bit high...

Well went to rouge on one of my friend's birthday..it is just opposite to la martinere for girls school.
The interior is quite nice but all the pastries listed in the menu are not available at all time
We had red velvet cup cake with butter cream frosting and chocolate truffle cake
The butter cream frosting was to die for...'heaven on a spoon'...and the chocolate truffle was also very good
But the 'mini' cupcakes and macaroons are way too small for the price..
Overall It was very good

I am 101% sure that best red velvet with creamcheese icing are available here. Place has a nice decor. Floral and graceful surround. Just that i didnt find the customized work satisfactory. I had ordered cupcakes with customized fondant work on it. It was not at all looking near to what i have shown in the picture. Otherwise, food and service are good.

This place is THE place to get the best cupcakes in town! I've been here time and again to enjoy those little treats!

Ambiance (4/5) : Cute, warm, cosy cafe. Makes you go all awww. 

Service (3/5) : Nice, polite service. Usually they serve stuff from under the counter. Slow when asked to make a shake/coffee.

Food (4.5/5) : LOVE the red velvet! The cupcakes are too yummy. All of them. They have those puddings too nowadays, which decent. But the red velvets here are to die for! If you feel like having all the flavours, go for the mini versions. They are a delight! The macaroons are really good too and I keep gifting my friends and family with boxes of these! Coffee and shakes here are okay. 

Vfm (3.5/5) : Yes, everyone must go. Cute place, great cupvakes, not so easy on the pocket, but definitely worth a visit.

I did not have the time to stop over at this place so many had someone pickup a few things for me.Among which include their chocolate brownie,the coffee macaroons,an almond tart,and a chocolate tart.Not a big fan of the red velvet cupcakes so gave that one a miss.Have to say one of he best brownies that ive tasted.the texture of that piece of cake was simply amazing.The tarts were decent as well.The only thing that disappointed me were the macaroons.Dont get me wrong.They tasted fantastic but the size of the macaroons was what left me bewildered.Why make something  that tastes so good sooooo small.I mean come one guys u can make them a little bigger especially when you are charging 40bucks .Apart from that id say it was a good experience.

Being a student of Alliance Fran√ßaise du Bengale, we used to be a regular to this joint until quiet recently. The ambience is very warm, cuddly, feels like home. We frequented the cupcakes, those √©clairs, coffee, and the drinks. Amongst the warm cupcakes, the comments on the boards inside, the good people, the beautiful packaging for the takeaways-the perfect Valentine's gift, its difficult to say which stole my heart away most.
Bon app√©tit!

I absolutely love their Red Velvet cupcakes they taste divine !!! They also have an adorable interior! The cafe space is pretty small and located in a rather congested area, would love to see another branch somewhere cleaner. But when it comes to cupcakes in Kolkata this is definitely where you should go. I recently ordered my graduation cake from them with rain chocolate filling which was delicious and very aesthetically pleasing. They take orders of pictures from the Internet ! You can just give them a photo of the cake you want and they will recreate it and it will taste great too !!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è.üí´

My first visit to this place was 2 years ago and since that day I have been a fan of their red velvet creamcheese cupcake. I love it so much that I've never wanted to try anything else. However this time we thought of experimenting with some new flavours and were not quite impressed by them. They looked quite tempting but didn't taste too well. We ordered a Nutty professor and Lil miss crazy cupcake. Lil miss crazy has a raspberry frosting and was ordinary to taste. Nutty professor was not good at all. After this incident, I would probably only stick to red velvet when it comes to The rouge. For people who haven't tried this place Red velvet cupcake is a must have! And other flavours can be tried once in a while. Some other things that are nice here include Chocolate Cheesecake and blueberry cheesecake.

Quietly located at the Beckbagan crossing this place is a small heaven for those with sweet-tooth. The Rouge is famous for its cupcakes and macaroons. Since this joint is located exactly opposite to my workplace we have the pleasures of giving in to our guilty desires once in a while. The cupcakes come in two sizes - mini and regular. While the mini does justice to its name and is really small, you need the Regular size to fulfil your cravings. This place is most famous for its Red Velvet Cupcake which is an absolute indulgent. The Nutty Professor is a dud and without anything 'nutty' about it. Lil Miss Crazy is nice raspberry flavored cupcake and is quite decent.

The red-velvet cupcake is to die for, a must must try! The cream frosting is so perfect. Pricing I would say, just okay.
Glad to see such a place here in Kolkata, but yes, may be they could consider making the place a tad bit bigger.
Nevertheless even more happy to see their outlet in Quest mall....Shopping and cup-cakes, what a wonderful world! ;D

Been here quite a few times, and yet it is after atleast a dozen visits that I'm writing this review. Why?
Well this place leaves me confused, sometimes I find their confectionary concotions great tasting and sometimes it is just utter crap to say the least. Perhaps it is because of the very nature of the food they serve- confectionary- ingredients, mainly dairy products might differ or even the quantity of things might get mishandled from day to day operations. 
Anyway, they are known for their red velvet cupcakes and yea they're good but I strongly believe they can do better. For I never feel the urge to visit this place on my own, it's always been because of some friend or the other. They also serve macaroons, which again is good but can be done better. I'm no macaroon/cupcake aficionado but I can say there is room for improvement. 
The place itself is a very nicely done feminine cafeteria‚Äì mostly white and few colours of pink, purple or pastel green. Ambience is definitely a USP for it helps setting in the mood for sinful cupcakes. 
This is one place where the eye catches more fancy than the taste buds. Cheers!

This place never fails to surprise me. Although a bit small, the cupcakes are heavenly. Red velvet is a regular thing to order, but if you want to try something else , then do try Creme Brule√©, which is superlight unlike Red velvet and simply melts in your mouth. The caramelised sugar coating adds a twist to the softness of it. The hot chocolate is also an absolute favourite there and satisfies you without really burning a hole in your pocket.

I've visited this place many times and enjoyed their Red Velvet cupcakes, cheesecakes, and Kit Kat shake.!
In my last visit I had Blueberry Cheesecake which was very different from the blueberry cheesecakes I've had earlier at other places and was very tasty.!
We also had a Shake and Bake in which we can add a cupcake of our choice, we opted for Red Velvet and the resulting shake was awesome.!

Giving a distinct French look and feel to the way the interiors are done here in red and white, with a prominent mountain of variegated macaroons, The Rouge is a pretty decent place to satisfy one's sugar rush cravings. Only because its desserts are too sweet! Great idea bringing macaroons in the city! The constricted space probably augments the feel of a patisserie when you're indoors. However, the positioning of your name outside needs to be worked on, because there's this tree that sort of blocks it all out (and I am anti-deforestation) - put something on the doors or somewhere, and it'll turn just perfect. Waiting for you guys to launch more items on the menu and too much of sweet can actually balance itself well with a couple of sandwiches if you can arrange the logistics for that!

The cupcakes are perfectly baked.Just the right amount of sweet,dense,and melts in your mouth.The red velvet is my fave the other flavours are so so.This is a little overhyped and pricing is on the higher side(200-300 bucks for two) I feel.The tarts and brownies are good.The cream cheese frosting is yum and it's tough to get right so I was surprised that rouge nailed it. Macarons are perfect presentation wise but when it comes to taste it's meh.Tried the raspberry flavour and was underwhelmed because the filling was chewy and didn't taste like anything let alone raspberry.

This goodie of pure happiness was gifted by Rouge.
Taste-4/5 absolutely beautiful cupcakes and brownies. Macaroons could have been filled a tad more.
Quality-5/5 freshly baked and right out of the oven
Quantity - 4/5 balances itself well with the price 
Ambience -4/5 looks like a little French bakery.
Must try is their red velvet brownie. One of the bests I have had ever. even better than theobroma.

Well this place is P-E-R-F-E-C-T.. Situated exactly at Beckbagan crossing, this easy to locate cafe has a very unique touch to it.. From the hangout sign to the door, you just can't miss this one.. A small cozy looking and cozy feeling cafe, well decorated and maintained.. With candy-ish interiors and pretty pretty wallpapers and framed articles, the ambience is super welcoming.. The staff is really polite, courteous and efficient.. Seating arrangements are limited but that is made up for with the wide range of sweet sweet quickbites you get here.. Having specialities in rainbow and red velvet cupcakes and personally being a super picky person on red velvets, this is heaven.. The flavor is perfect and the sponge is soft.. And the cream cheese is really good too with the lingering authentic taste.. We also tried the choco love cupcake and that was also delicious.. The coffee proportion is huge and enough to suffice for a coffee high for the entire day.. Rates are quite reasonable and it's just a really happy place to be..
A full solid 5 for The Rouge.. It was a great experience.. And here's a promise to keep visiting every time I visit Kolkata..

Loved the small cozy ambiance. This was my first visit to the joint, although I've had their cupcakes on previous occasions.

I don't know why the Red Velvet cupcake is their signature dish when they have something as powerful as the Creme Br√ªl√©e at their arsenal. Bless them!! It's divine‚Ä¶ more divine than anything in the fairy land of cupcakes. Apart from the the Creme Br√ªl√©e and the Red Velvet, I've loved their Lil Miss Crazy and Nutty Professor cupcakes.

The decor is just so lovely and colorful, and the staff members are always lively. The Rouge, over the past couple of months, has definitely become my "marquee" when it comes to being in the mood to try out cupcakes in Kolkata.

Maybe I am in that phase of my life when I am going to the right places but trying out the not-so-right items on the menu. I say this because I go to The Rouge and do not try their red-velvet cupcakes which is their specialty.¬†

The first thing that caught my attention about The Rouge was the decor - pretty cake art near the window, cute wallpapers and the use of pastel shades - absolutely adorable and charming; it appealed to the 16 year old girl in me even though I am way past my teenage years.¬†
The service is not fast; however, I didn't mind the wait AT ALL because there is so much to look at and moreover, the ambiance is very peaceful and quiet (which is a rare combination with all that cuteness). Two thumbs up for the interiors. Also, the person who served us was sweet, polite and friendly.

Dear Rouge, you served awesome Hot Mocha and yummylicious cupcakes and I am kinda sorta in love with you for that.¬†I have tried cupcakes from Mrs. Magpie and I can say that without a doubt, YOU CUPCAKE BETTER.¬†Also, your menu  on Zomato needs to be updated.¬†
Their creme brulee cupcake and one other cupcake that starts with Li'l-Miss-..... (I am forgetting the name) are delicious.¬†

There is this banana, peanut butter and chocolate shake they serve which is nice. No regrets trying this out but I have come to the conclusion that I am not a peanut butter person. A special mention to the glass bottles in which they serve their shakes - very CUTE presentation (yes, I am using this word a little too much, so guilty as charged! :D )

However, the macaroons are REALLY BAD. Especially the coffee one. It has a weird taste; I don't have words to describe it. The Hazelnut macaroon is slightly better but I wouldn't recommend it either. In the end, we tried the Walnut Tart and this did not taste good either.¬†

However, my overall experience was good and next time, I guess I will order better.¬†
Ambiance - 4.7/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 3.5/5 (I feel that this place deserves a better rating and I hope to visit soon and update my review. However, this is my rating on the basis of my first experience.)

If you are reading my review and you are going to The Rouge for the first time, do order the following and I am sure you won't be disappointed.
Hot Mocha
Kitkat Shake
Oreo Shake (if you are still in school)
Red Velvet CupcakeCreme Brulee Cupcake
Li'l Miss ..... ( I don't remember the third word; you can check it in the menu)

Visited this place after hearing a lot about it from a friend but was pretty dissapointed. l wanted to buy cupcakes but i was surprised to see how  'mini' the mini cupcakes were for the prices charged against them . Some of the cupcakes didn't even look as pretty as I was told. So I just settled for some macaroons which too were quite pricey and really small. They tasted good. Maybe they should seriously consider increasing the sizes of the cupcakes if they want to continue charging so much.

What would you do if You are stranded due to torrential rains just a stone-throw away from The Rouge? Ofcourse you thank the rain Gods and step into the oh-so-pretty and petite place for something that would be worth having on a rainy evening. I exactly did so today around 7ish. Ordered my favourite Red Velvet Cup Cake and a Green Tea. The Rouge has absolutely no snacking options, which is a downside I would say. There are only cupcakes, tarts, cakes, et all sweet..alongwith teas,coffees and shakes. Its time they introduced atleast a few snacking options like sandwiches, puffs, croissants etc. My cupcake was absolutely delightful, and was a moodlifter on an otherwise mundane weekday post-work. And Green tea kept the calories gained by the cupcake under control. Lol. Next time would try their Kit-Kat shake which seemed to be a popular choice.

This place had been on my list for quite sometime and I chanced upon it, unplanned, a week back.¬†
The interiors look clean and pretty at first sight but once you sit to eat, you realise how the space could have been (possibly) better utilised.
Selected items from the menu were available and I went for the Choco Love cupcake with chocolate frosting. The 'mini' seemed to mock my appetite so I went for the 'regular' insead!
The cupcake looks ordinary and honestly I wasn't expecting much. But I have to admit, it blew me away. The cupcake was adequately moist with a dense chocolate frosting that I couldn't have enough of!
I would rate it a 3.5 but the extra 0.5 goes just for the frosting which was super amazing!

The pretty little place looks straight out of a fairy tale, though the space is crammed with tiny chairs and tables. 
Known for their red velvets, the rouge cupcake with generous frosting was magic in the mouth. 
The creme brul√© cupcake was nothing like anything I have ever tasted before. It's a assoc cupcake topped with custard covered in a hard caramel layer, and one has to crack the caramel with a tap of the spoon like in a real creme brul√©. Thumbs up for this one!
However, the macaroons were too sugary for my liking, in spite of its perfect texture. 
Overlooking the space crunch, the other downsides were -
1. Not everything on the menu was available and has small ticks beside the available things. Also, the menus with dog ears look worn out. So basically they need to revamp their menu.
2. There's absolutely nothing savoury on the menu. Okay, it will shift the focus of might say, but something salty in between sweet bites would have been nice.

The best red velvet cake with cream cheese. It's to die for. I am not too much of a chocolate person so red velvet is just perfect for me. 4 of us completed the entire cake of 1 pound in just 10 mins still wanting more.

You can imagine how perfect it was.

The .5 less is just for the macaroon sitting on top which very very bad. A place which makes perfect cakes and cupcakes can't afford to goof up so badly on the macaroon. 

Love it at all times üòçüòçüòç

Best cupcake in Kolkata. :')
Decent macarons.¬†
Do try the red velvet cupcake with fresh cream, the chocomint cupcake, the Creme Brulee one, walnut tart.¬†
Quite liked their Choux too. :')

Their cheesecake is surprisingly dense, not sweet and real nice.

This is a quaint little patisserie, placed conveniently at the Beckbagan crossing. I have been here twice with friends and had only had cupcakes. It seems such a waste to have anything other than Red Velvet Cupcakes with Cream Cheese. I also tried the ones with butter cream frosting but I would prefer to stick to the classic. It's a nice place to put your feet up and relax after tuitions and such.
The staff is friendly and very helpful. One of them readily offered to click a snap of us when we were struggling with the groupfie. :-)

Surprises are something that personally doesn't appeal to me that much. That said, when I got a message from The Rouge saying that I had been chosen to receive a box of happiness....it made my day. Waking up to such things were on my bucket list, thank you Rouge for making it happen.¬†Coming to the part after I opened the box, it looked like a picture perfect treasure chest containing the following items. 1. Mini almond tea cake
2. Mini red velvet brownie¬†
3. Mini chocolate brownie¬†
4. Chocolate macaron
5. Chocolate hazelnut macaron
6. Raspberry macaron
7. Vanilla milk chocolate cupcake
8. Red velvet with cream cheese cupcake¬†
9. Chocolove mini
10. Mini Oreo cupcake¬†
11. Mini raspberry vanilla cupcake
12. Chocolate hazelnut miniNeedless to say, all of them were delightful except for the mini almond tea cake which was little too bland according to my taste. But overall, the quality is what amazed me the most, everything in that box was oven fresh and smelled like a charm. The ingredients inside were of very high quality. The cupcakes were beautifully made and what stood out was the fact that the batter in every one of these were extremely consistent, there was not a single moment where it kinda mashed up inside the mouth. Another thing that impressed me was the fact that the cafe actually advises the consumers to consume everything within 2 days, not that it lasts that long being as mazing as it is...but still a fair point to make.¬†Overall, a strong recommendation from my end to whoever who swears by cupcakes and macaroons. This place is pretty and it will blow your mind like it blew mine.¬†Ps. This is my first review in over 9 months, so you know the extent of my affection to wards this place and its food that sort of ended the drought and brought me back. The Rouge, I love you.

Expenditure / VFM : Totally depends on your appetite for sweets. Mine has ranged between 100 to 800 ( at one time)

Ambience/ Service : Cupcakes must have been invented in some fairytale. That's perhaps the only plausible explanation for all the 'cupcakes n scones' places being cutesy-fairytale-ish. Well this is another such set-up and totally lives up to the the spirit. 
Personally, I have some nostalgic values attached to this place which makes it dearer to me. Being 2 steps away from my school, this place had become the usual haunt for me n my pals during my high-schools days. And this was also the first of these 'pink places' I went to before discovering many others in the concurrent years. So, as for me I love the pinkness of this place.

What to Order : The Rouge i.e. the red velvet cupcake.
Here I have had the best red velvet cupcake with the richest, creamiest icing. One of my other favourite for red velvet cakes is this place called 'Elma's Bakery' in Hauz Khas in Delhi, and I literally swear by their desserts. Bit when it comes to cupcakes, I would still go for The Rouge. Great work on taste and quality. A must visit for sweet-tooths.

All of us had read those fairy tales in our childhood. The ones where the entire city was a very beautiful place with sweet shops round every corner. Well if you are planning to visit Rouge , please try recollecting those pictutes that usually accompanied those sweet shops. Heavy decorated mirrors, flower wall papers everywhere, small seats( as if we were all dwarfs). The moment you enter Rouge you get that picture and then the smell of freshly baked cakes hits you. For "deserts kinda" people this place is a must visit. From macaroons to cupcakes to croquembouche this place has it all. For cupcake regulars I need not say anything about the red velvet cupcakes and also the chocolate ganache ones. Those who haven't tried them try them at once. Macaroons are my personal favourite , the mint chocolate one being an absolute bliss. Amazing place with amazing cupcakes.

I couldn't save my 0.5 for anything better. I  not too fond of desserts or u may say I have a refined taste for them. Coz m too selective.. Oh wow this place won me at the entrance.

It is located bang opposite of LA martinere for girls. A very small outlet. But u couldn't get better.the ambience is ohhh so pretty.. Pink wallpapers with pastel shades furniture. Very soft spoken staff. A beautiful and colorful array of cakes and cupcakes.
We had the rouge cupcake.. The 1st bite was sensational. So soft. The chocolate was sooooo smooth. A must try. Have many visits coming across.
Loved the place. Also there were paper napkins with messages hanging on a wall that seemed nice too. Check out the pics.:)

I wonder why I never rated this place. One of the best, if not THE BEST places for cupcakes and coffee.¬†
The location is pretty odd though ( towards park circus, there is no parking)
Rouge is pretty small and compact and usually the display stocks the essentials. Their rev velvet buttercream/creamcheese cupcakes are a hit and I feel steal the show!¬†Other favorites include chocochip ones.¬†

The cupcakes are priced very decent and taste absolutely amazing.¬†
A major drawback is the extremely limited menu and no savories to rescue you after pure sugary indulgence!¬†

Overall The Rouge deserves a 4 for those amazing cupcakes!
Cheers

This pretty place near park circus/beckbagan area(just opposite la martiniere for girls ) is a must visit just for their Red velvet cupcake with cream cheese topping . I just cannot have enough of them. However, the other items on the menu are not as special and it would have been wonderful if they included some savoury items as well. Prices are neither cheap nor pocket-boring ! Visit the place for their cosy and cute d√©cor and their red velvet wonder ÔÅä

Who knew the cupcakes in the land of rasgulla would taste better than the rasgullas!! The big O and the red velvet cupcakes were super soft and yum. The chocolate cupcake as rich and chocolaty. The red velvet with chocolate icing was a disappointment. The chocolate cheesecake was out of the world, never had something like that! The shakes were average too. In all a great place to hangout with friends.

Over the years the size of the macarons have decreased, along with the quality, taste and appearance. Only thing that hasn't changed are the high prices. Visited this place today and couldn't have been more disappointed. The macarons were dense and not pleasing to the palate. Complete waste of money. Will avoid this place hereafter.

This was a lovely little place that I found - and on a hot and humid summer day no less - which I would recommend to anyone in a heartbeat. True I did not go there for the menu but I ended up becoming a fan nonetheless.

Their red velvet cupcakes are delectable and their shakes are lovely. They suggested that "The 5 dollar shake" would go well with what I ordered - and considering they had crushed oreos in the preparation which I don't like, I loved it. And heck they gave enough for me to comment that it was pretty sizable. Oh and I love how the shakes had movie references attached to them, kind of felt nice.

I also ended up buying macaroons for home and they tasted nice enough though the ROI could be a bit better on them. Having said that the ROI on the entire meal was pretty good - in short yes they are not pricey.

I would recommend this place highly to people who have a sweet tooth and even those who don't.

Place is easy to locate in park circus area. Although it's a small outlet, interiors are good but place is quite congested . they don't have variety of pastries . I tried red velvet with chocolate frosting and raspberry macaroons. They were usual , you may get far better red velvet pastries in other exotic places like Paris cafe. service was good and efficient. I enjoyed my dessert . if you have sudden craving for sweets or you are a sweet tooth person , give this place a try. It is one of the listed place for pastries. Give it a visit.

f you haven't been to The Rouge before, you may have some trouble locating it because it inconspicuously lies between two stores at the Park Circus crossing, a little ahead of the Minto Park flyover. The interiors are reminiscent of Paris Cafe, but the menu here has way more pastry options available. The place is slightly crammed and you may have trouble if you visit them in large groups. The macaroon towers placed by the window and the shelves lined with bottles of milk shake make for very quaint decor. 

We ordered their specialty, The Rouge, which is their red velvet cupcake, the Rubus and Lil Miss Crazy cupcakes. The red velvet cupcake was undoubtedly the most delectable option on their menu. It looks gorgeous and the sour cream frosting compliments the cupcake beautifully. Their macaroons, though dismally tiny, are delightfully brittle. They melt in your mouth and are packed with flavour. The mint-chocolate and milk chocolate macaroons were my personal favourites.

The staff is friendly, the service prompt and pastry options aplenty. I loved the place and would recommend it to anyone with a sweet tooth.

I have tried and made my family and friends taste the red velvet cupcakes from this place. The red velvet cupcakes with different frosting is SINFUL and to die for. Not really tried anything but I keep seeing pictures of the cakes they bake for clients and they look really pretty and tempting. Although I have one complain that they have very limited options and qty available on the racks.I hope to remain loyal if they promise to keep up the quality.A little heavy on the pocket, but never mind!

In my search of finding red velvet cupcakes in Kolkata I came across this place via Zomato. Quite a few months back on a Saturday evening  I landed in this little cafe/bakery situated in a very easy to spot corner of Beckbagan with my friend. This review has been long pending.

Rouge has a very elegant decor, with real pretty mirrors, rosy wallpapers and lights along with the baked goodies used for display. It gives a doll house feel ! Although the space is not big with hardly 4 tables or so, its been utilized well.
We got a table for two and ordered a cappuccino, a latte with some red velvet cupcakes (we had to go for multiple minis as the regular one wasn't available) with cream cheese frosting.
The coffees were decent  however, the red velvet mini cupcake failed to please. The cake was soft, fresh and spongy but had very little cream cheese (So little I could hardly feel the taste :-/ ) and a lot of chocolate ganache filling which I hadn't expected or, wanted.

Anyways, upon telling the guy serving us he said they had their kitchen right behind working on cupcakes at the moment could customize for us. So I ordered a box of mini cupcakes to-go with cream cheese filing and the guy agreed.
Pretty happy with the deal we left as happy customers until I opened the box @home and found the same we had in the cafe with chocolate ganache filling and tiny topping of creamecheese were packed and sold to us. 
Extremely disappointing would be an understatement as the staff literally fooled us.
Hence my rating :

Ambience: 3/5
Food quality and taste: 2.5/5

The Rouge is a cute little place but I can't say I loved it. The cupcakes that I picked from the menu were not available. The Cream Cheese Red Velvet cupcake, I feel, is overhyped. However, one of their beverages, Go Gaga, is quite a quirky invention and I recommend it those wanting to try something new. 
All in all, there are other cafes and patisseries I'd pick over this.

Location: Near Innside Story

We hit this place after a lunch at Haji Saheb to satisfy our dessert cravings. The AMBIANCE here gives a feel of an American bakery shop with a sweet pinkish interior, a shelf with a surprising way to show off the compliments by happy customers, tea set candles, designer cakes, macaroon croquembouches, and a display case for their fare.

About the ORDER, after a bit a of contemplations, we called for the following:

- Macaroons (Raspberry & Coffee)
The slight raspberry flavored cream in the macaroon tasted good. However, on the other hand the coffee flavored macaroon was a let down as it lacked the flavor.

- Chocolove Cupcake (Mini)
The cupcake was spongy and had the right amount of sweetness. Delicious.
Recommended. 

- Truffle cake (slice)
The truffle cake was spongy but felt too dry. The chocolate also lacked the balance of sweetness to it. Disappointed.

The STAFF was friendly and the SERVICE was quick. 

PRICES felt as a pinch in regards to quality.

An above average experience.

Okay so this place was pretty disappointing since I've heard so much about it and of course about the red velvet cake. 
It makes me sad writing reviews about these places which are known for certain things are they tend to disappoint me. Half the things I wanted to order were not available hence I was forced to eat stuff what I didn't plan on, especially when this place was topping my list. 
So I ordered, blueberry cheesecake, raspberry macroon , red velvet cupcake and Kitkat shake. 
Raspberry macroon was perfectly good. One of the best I've had. So was the cheesecake good. 
Coming to the red velvet cupcake , this was pure disappointment ! Didn't like it AT ALL. 
And so was the Kitkat shake. It wasn't at all up to the mark. 
Nevertheless, the pretty decor did a good job and made me happy. And the bill was something I thought was high considering the quality and quantity of the food.

We walked into this cutely decorated fairyland of sorts awaiting to satisfy out sweetooth...

The staff are well trained and helpful alongside a plus is that ,there‚Äôs no music ,so one can hold their conversations without getting distracted much.

Coming to the food...we ordered  1 the rouge regular cup cake, 2 Macaroons (Raspberry & Hazelnut ) , 1 Blueberry Cheesecake, 1 Kit for Kat shake.

As for the cupcake & cheesecake both weren‚Äôt anything out of the ordinary or even near to it coming to the taste or quality. As per the macaroons yes they were really good and well baked to the extent of not being brittle on the layering aswl.  As for kit kat shake it wasn‚Äôt  so great either,it was firstly too light for a shake and also the chocolate quotient was light aswl.

The bill came upto 550 for all the above which surely doesn‚Äôt justify the billing in terms of quality or quantity.

The only word to describe it would be W-O-W <3
Been there once and already in love with it.
Decor, check.
Ambiance, check.
Cup Cakes, check.
Macaroon, check.
Truffle, check.
Not to forget, the staff there are extremely helpful and cooperating. We had called up to know the exact spot and they patiently guided us. The only bad part is it's location. It's extremely easy to be missed. One of the best places I've been to.

The Rouge is located in a place that you might miss in a blink. Of course now its too famous to be missed. It is a small and cute place and during most occasions you will find only one server around. They do have a good collection of shakes and I have had their Big Red and The Oreo. The Dirty White Boy is good too. But what will win you over are the macarons (there is a grave spelling mistake on the menu! They are not called macaroons! Macaroons are a totally different entity), the cup cakes and the decor!
I think they could bring about more flavours in their collection of macarons! among the ones they serve, I like their Rasperry and Coffee best! They should buckle up because a lot of other places in town now serve them! Some are really authentic.
On the brighter side, their cup cakes are to die for! The Rouge, obviously is the best one of the lot, both, with cream cheese and choco ganache! Finger Lickin' Good! The Lemon and Chocomint is great as well!¬†
I am sure their cakes will be a feast! Will have to try them some time.

Rouge is a quaint patisserie which is situated directly across the back gate of La Martiniere for Girls. One is transported to a wonderland quintessential of English summers, the moment they enter the eatery. It is safe to say that the ambience is extremely impressive and the eclectic, quirky layout and props, complete with two macaroon towers, excite the palate immediately. 
The choice of cupcakes and macaroons are limited but from the selection available they are all spot on in taste and appearance. A must try is the classic red velvet cupcake with a dual choice of buttercream : vanilla or chocolate. The chocolate cupcake is equally delicious, though it does prove to be a little heavy, as a chocoholic I have no complaints. The drinks are tasty and have eccentric names such as The Lady Gaga ("devoid of eyeliner!", notifies the menu board). Rouge also has cool discount offers --- if you 'Like' their Facebook page, they dock 20% from the actual amount. Students get discounts as well, provided Student IDs are shown as proof (hear, hear, LMG!). A chalkboard is placed outside which displays the Specials as well as cheery messages like "shout 'It's Raining!' (this was on a particularly horrid rainy day) as soon as you enter to receive a 5% discount" which thrilled me and my friends to no extent. Offers such as these are meant to be grabbed as the delicacies of Rouge do tend to burn a hole in your pocket. 
The servers are extremely friendly and as a regular, I'm pleased to report that the bubbly attendant at the counter remembers and chirps out my order, even before I can say "The usual", though it is advised to experiment. 
To conclude, if you're visiting Cal, do take the time to finish off your trip with a Rouge cupcake. You'll be grinning from ear to ear thanks to the sugar rush by the end of it.

This place, though small, has one of the most amazing redvelvet cupcakes in the city. My personal favorite is the one with cream cheese. These for me are the heroes in this place. The place is cozy and surrounds you with loads of colours. Its hygenic and clean, there can be instances where they run out of these cupcakes as they are very much in demand. The prices do appear to be a bit steep but atleast for the cupcakes they are well worth the price

Had gone to place an order for a cake and I must say I was utterly disappointed by the staff interaction. I was asking for various options available and I was handed over a menu card and said you can have a look at it and get back to us after a couple of days. The staff then just went inside the kitchen and didn't bother coming out for 5 mins whereas I was standing at the counter all this while. Anyways after 5 mins from his busy schedule he did manage to see me again standing right in front of the counter. To my amusement he asks me again is there anything you want ? I could not believe his attitude towards a customer. Quite a surprising incident . Hope they improve their attitude soon.

Cream Cheese Red Velvet Cupcakes literally melts in your mouth and the awesomeness lingers for sometime. Well.. The Rouge for you.  
The ambience is neat and pretty and has this fairy book kind of a feel. Though the food is a tad bit pricey.. For cup cake lovers its worth it.
The Rouge deserves a 4.5 with cream cheese topping.  :D

The first place in Kolkata where I had a cupcake. The decor is simple yet elegant with a display shelf of macaroon tower standing out. The ambience is warm and cosy. They offer a variety of cupcakes which are oh! So yummy. Especially the red velvet cupcakes and chocolate ones. The prices are on the higher side given the small portions they have to offer, but its still a must visit place. Rating 3

Rouge is highly overrated in my opinion. A definite treat for the eye, delights the taste buds but at such prices , i somehow did not find it that much worthy.

Located at the juncture between circus avenue and a j v bose road, its a tiny cafe with really cute decor. The shop is very inviting with couple of tables inside and small chairs to sit which were a bit discomfortable to me. The staff are reasonably warm. The decor is amazing and any new guest definitely keeps looking around for sometime. 

Known for its cupcakes, i liked them too but do not have that much of a love for them, so was not bowled over. Red velvet cupcake is what they suggest and is their bestseller. I tried their blueberry cheesecake and chocolate pastry as well. The cheesecake was just good but for 200 bucks, it was way overpriced. The chocolate pastry was bit too dark to my liking. The hot coffees are very basic. 

Overall i feel disappointed everytime i come here. Would definitely prefer some desserts, coffee at afraa deli or mocha nearby.

I was a Rouge loyalist. ¬†But consecutively 2 annoying experiences have made me loathe the place!Just yesterday, I wanted to gift this to a friend. So I called up and ordered knowing the guy in the counter takes a gazillion years to make it. I told him to make it ready within half n hour so that I could pick it up. When I went, it just wasn't ready. The guy in the counter was pretty arrogant stating the fact "I am the only guy". Then why exactly did he take the order and reassure me over the phone in the first place? I am done with Rouge. Once I got a stale cupcake and now this. Just HORRIBLE.
Never again visiting Rouge again. Such little respect they have for clients.

========1/09/2014=========
Okay was MAJORLY disappointed by the service of Rouge today.
Ordered a nutty professor and a red velvet cake.
Our office bell boy went to get the order.
When he returned with it, we found the nutty professor's cream to be sour.Called up. A guy picked up.
And he offered to replace the ICING of the cupcake. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
Didn't even have the decency to replace it as a whole.Considering we are regular customers, this was extremely unanticipated.

Okay I'm not much into patisseries but yes this one was worth it. A pretty small outlet but a very cute one. The guys are smart and fast behind the counter. I ordered for a Red Velvet Cupcake with Cream Cheese. I can't tell you how much i enjoyed it. Yummilicious. The best one they say. I ordered for The Java milkshake which was really nice.

Till this Sunday, I had been dying to try Rouge as one of my friends loved it and I saw a number of selfies on Facebook. So, on Sunday I come all the way from New Town to try the pattisiere out. The parking place was not a problem for me as there was parking spaces just under the flyover. From the outside it looks like a cute cafe and macaroon towers were stacked up against the display case. I pushed the green door and if I said I was disappointed, I wouldn't be exaggerating. The cafe is no more that 100 ft2 area. There are tiny tables and chairs. Everything was pink and a little too bright. Caf√©s should be pastel not bright. I think there were no more than 12 cupcakes to choose from. There was only a few coffees and milkshakes. Cramped space, rude cashier and very less variety was something I wasn't expecting when I was going there. If you really want to eat good cakes and cupcakes, I recommend Paris cafe. I have gone there and I absolutely loved it. Rouge was a disappointment. Not going to go there again. However the rouge cream cheese cupcake I had was not bad, yet I had tasted better.

Quaint and homey : The Rouge with a simple menu selection of coffee/tea, desserts and cupcakes of various tastes and textures delicately decorated and delicious! The caf√© is an ideal location for coffee and conversations with a delight of these sinful cakes and you are attended to by very friendly and welcoming but professional staff. Adorable place with good music where a simple cup of coffee with a cupcake or macaroon always feels awesome - thats 'The Rouge'.

Whether or not you have a sweet tooth must try : 
The All Nighter with macaroons, Cocoa Twixplosion or Shake & Bake the signature Red Velvet / Nutty Proffessor.

The very best in quality, taste and freshness.... a must visit in Kolkata.

I have never been very fascinated with cupcakes and all those people in my network whose opinions, with regards to food and food outlets, I value associated The Rouge with cupcakes. I do have a sweet tooth and also am very fond of macarons but I never felt the urge to visit The Rouge until this last Monday. Also to my mind parking one's car seemed like quite a challenge. Fortunately as we were passing by The Rouge and an empty parking spot beckoned at us.
We stepped in and immediately took a liking to the place. Quaint and tiny. The decor was pretty nice, the white panels with the pinkish wallpaper with a flowery design came across as very girly to me but somehow it suited the place. My companion though liked the decor. There were just two staff members in the cafe. Either of them took turns at serving at the table and manning the cash counter. And both were quite warm and hospitable. There were just three or four tables but the chair were quite comfortable.
We went for a regular Rouge with cream cheese, a regular Chocomint, an Oreo shake, a double shot espresso and a couple of macarosn. As I said I am not a big fan of cupcakes but this red velvet was mind blowing. The cream cheese too had a distinctive flavour, the sweetness of cream and the slight sourness of curd blended beautifully together. The texture of the cupcake was amazing. It was adequately moist to the core, neither too moist nor too dry. The mint cupcake was disappointing as far as I am concerned. My companion too tended to agree. The Oreo Shake too was nice but the coffee fell short of my expectations. The macarons were good but the Raspberry in my opinion was better than the coffee one.
The value for money quotient is not the best here but the red velvet cupcakes here will make it worth your while and money.

Rouge is like a Parisian lady, effortlessly well turned out, chic, cool and so so beautiful :) their cupcakes are to die for especially the redvelvet cupcake (named the rouge)  and their blueberry cupcake with cream whipped on top. Their shakes are superb n so so filling. I personally love th bottle-like glasses they are served in. All their shakes are pretty good like their kitkat shake, Oreo shake, shake and bake(where v choose our favourite muffin to be mixed in th shake) but I like th kitkat shake th best of th lot. N th best part is that they split the shake in two if we ask them to. The staff is very polite and courteous. The only backdraw is that they don serve any savouries and its basically sugar o overload after the shakes and muffins. The chocolate cheesecake is an absolute delight though overpriced. All in all rouge Is a dessert lover's paradise :)

This place is pure prettiness. It's like you step inside the eatery and you swim in prettiness and cuteness till your fingers get pruned.

Ambiance:
For all the first-time visitors, you will only look at the tiny cute little decorations for the first fifteen minutes. Their cupcakes are so lovely to just look at. It's a tiny joint with little seating space but it will take you to a fairy-tale-esque world of its own.

Food:
An ideal place to go for some sinful indulgence. It's a pure bliss to toss up their tiny cupcakes and drown in its taste and cream. Their signature red velvet is to die for! Soft and tasteful, it just melts in your mouth as the chocolate filling of the cupcake is out.

Service:
Their service is decent and prices are good.

When you leave this place, I'm sure you will have a smile on your face. :)

The Rouge has some tasty offerings, to be sure, however it lacks a bit of integrity.

Recently I went with my friend from the States (I am American too, but live in Kolkata) so he could check out this nice little spot. I told him to get a milkshake as I remember them being tasty. That was a hit. We especially like the branding efforts of Rouge - and the milk containers with "Rouge" embedded on them is a nice touch..

But, as you know, branding isn't just about ambiance and touch - but about the product.

Rouge has around 20 cupcakes listed on their menu. But in reality only a fraction of them (maybe 6-8) are readily available at the store. I asked the counterman if i could order a Carrot Cake Cupcake. "No, sir - that is not available." Ok.. Well, how about the Mocha.." "No - no sir." It led me to ask, "Why don't we just start with what you DO actually have!" Unreal. The amount of cupcakes they don't carry exceed the amount they do - even though they are all on the menu. Frustrating. To make matters worse, I was told that all 20 cupcakes are cycled around. Wrong. I have been there enough times to know that 5-6 of the 8 that are on display are there EVERY time... Nice try. Finally, the "cream cheese" frosting they claim is also inferior to bona fide cream cheese frosting. Those of you who have had real cream cheese frosting will notice this right away. Oh, and the credit card machine didn't work. Nice. 

As a westerner (and sweets lover), I find this inconsistency highly frustrating. However, maybe folks in Kolkata do not get offended by this? Do you? In the West if any type of eatery didn't have over 50% of their main offerings on the menu, that would spell doom. One could only hope for more I guess.

Two days back I got a great great great news and I could not  contain my happiness so I had to, had to, had to have some sweet indulgence and what can be better than The Rouge. 

I was my first time there. Such cute decor to suit a patisserie, cute cakes and macaroon towers, coffee cups and candles in display. The place is small but very neat. Right at the moment you enter the place you'll see the display where yummy looking cupcakes, macaroon tarts and cakes were in display which immediately lights up your mood and you began to feel hungry.

I ordered Red Velvet Cheese Cupcake with Cheese Cream Frosting, another Cupcake called the Nutty Professor and the yummiest dark chocolate and raspberry Macaroons with a cup of Cafe Mocha Latte. The most amazing cupcakes I'v ever had, not too sweet and perfect for my taste buds. And about the macaroons...... they were OH! SO YUMMY.... absolutely melt in mouth. The coffee was OK.

The sweet surrender was just perfect. Still wish they had some soda based drinks, mocktails and floaters in their menu because you can not always be in the mood for coffee or milkshakes.

The bill was rs.303/-  including all charges which was okay. 

Overall a great experience.

A small cupcake and coffee place plus patisserie on the corner of AJC Bose Rd and Circus Avenue. I have visited this a couple of times, just dropped in for a coffee. I tried a cupcake once and it was pretty nice. On both occasions I have had their coffee. Reasonably priced and tasty enough. The place itself is tiny, about 3-4 tables. The glass display has a small range of very inviting looking pastries on display.

Its a nice place to sit in solitude or with quiet company, within the surrounding hustle-bustle.

Been to Rouge once and must say quite impressive for a tiny place like that. Overall experience was good. Ambience is neat and clean and it was pleasantly cool even with the problems with the A.C.. We had ordered a cr√®me brule and a nutty professor. I hear from my friend who took me there that the latter its usually not available. The Nutty Professor can comprise of a meal in itself for any individual, tasty but very rich to digest!!! The Cr√®me Brule was fresh and moist, the top was perfectly baked. The only disappointment was the Banana milk shake which was less banana and more vanilla. It was initially served at room temperature but with a little ice it tasted like a good vanilla milkshake. Would definitely go again. the only impediment keeping me from visiting this place again is the parking problem. Otherwise would have to just drive past and wait for another opportunity.

Really strange experience! Went there by car after noticing the place in Zomato. The inside was colder, cute deco and all, but the AC was off. When we asked it to be switched on, the guy in the counter nonchalantly replied it was not working. But clearly it WAS working a while ago (for it was still colder than outside, but stuffy). Well, who knows, it might have broken down just before we stepped in! So we decided to leave a note. In the meantime the guy in the counter had left. When he came back, he looked very disturbed to see us still waiting, and when we asked for a pen and paper/comments book, he rudely replied there was no such thing in the shop. 
Clearly not the best experience, after all the plans of going there in this heat to have some nice time.

The only thing I would like to say about this place is that they have TO DIE FOR cupcakes! I don't know about anything else but I only go there for their cupcakes. They are just mouth watering and delicious. The Ambience is GREAT and COSY. The service is a little slow because there is usually just one or two people in the cafe. Well, Im not complaining here. 

If you don't have much time and you want to catch up with a friend for desserts this is a good place. The costs are okay, maybe on the higher side if you see the size but it's worth it! :D

This is one place that I could never really make up my mind about ! The reasons are as follows....the place itself is extremely pretty. The decor, the paper napkins with messages written by Rouge lovers, the glass wall and display self with a macaroon tower....its all very cute. The glass case displays the goodies available for the day and the server was polite. I would have expected to love this place if it weren't for the quantity of the goods served. The mini cupcakes were literally bite-sized. We had ordered the Red Velvet, Java Java and Lemon cupcakes....the 'java java' was the coffee flavored one and I quite liked the taste....the problem is that it kinda ends even before you have started. We also ordered the Hazelnut and the Rasberry Macaroons....the hazelnut one was actually good but the rasberry one didn't appeal to us. The macaroons too were tiny. I wouldn't mind the prices but what we are offered should be a bit substantial atleast. This is my only problem with this otherwise lovely and utterly cute place ! :)

I have been using Zomato for quite a while now, mainly for reading the reviews and suddenly I felt like I should be a part of this food frenzy Zomato community and this is when I write my first review.

Went to this place three months back on a Saturday evening along with two friends. It wasn't difficult to locate this little but brightly lit place, ideal for spending quality time with close friends. The interiors were cutely done.
 Now since it was months ago I didn't exactly remember what I had, but thanks to zomato that I now remember that I had a Lemon Cupcake ( read: Lemon), a tiny bit of a Mocha with Espresso Cupcake for my friend ( read: Java Java) and a "Raspberry Passion Fruit ( read: Macaroon) and a Hazelnut one. I am honestly not a great fan of cupcakes but I liked the taste of them both and to mention that they come in minuscule portions. Coming to the macaroon, which I was having for the first time, I must admit that it wasn't at all pleasing to my palate. Actually there were hardly any macaroons on their display shelf, and the ones we were looking for had already been depleted of their stock, so the attendant there asked us if we could wait for sometime he could get us our macaroons. Fair enough!! since we had nothing important to do we decided to wait. But the macaroons which came were not at all crispy, rather it fell apart after I had my first bite and maybe one is not supposed to have freshly baked macaroons which I believe contributed to its fallacy.   And about the price some may find it on the higher side given the portions they have to offer, but it's good enough a try...

Well to start with, today I turn 22 , and on that note I decided to go for a cake that means a lot to me ! We'll basically I also wanted to eat something apart from " kookier jar" ! Well no offence to people who love kookie jar but I think it's time we go and explore some of these amazing bakeries or patisseries that have opened up in this city of joy. Come to think of it, where in Calcutta would you find a perfect red velvet cupcake with cream cheese frosting eh ! Don't worry, you have this place to indulge in all those flavours you have been waiting for ! Plus you also get the bragging rights to show off to other cities like Mumbai or Delhi who go on yapping about their so-very classy cake shops and cupcake corners... So here's to all the girls , go to The Rouge and have a great time gossiping in the most Parisian environment I have ever been to in this city...... And come to think of it,  it's really worth it !

A few days back we decided to visit The Rouge for some desserts, and loved the sugary sweet decor. My friend wanted cupcakes, so did I, so the two of us ordered a few things we saw on display. I am always a sucker for anything that has mint in it, so I went for the Chocomint, while my friend got the Red Velvet. I was happy with my cupcake - it was minty, chocolate-laden and nice, but I felt it was a tad on the drier side - but still quite good. My friend on the other hand loved her Red Velvet cupcake. I decided to pack a few macarons and got a pack of five chocolate ones. The macarons were quite addictive - with a rich, thick chocolate ganache in the center and lovely pink and blue crisp outer shell. I could not stop munching on them.

Update : Bought the creme brulee cupcake and the red velvet (with cream cheese) and a cup of coffee. The red velvet cream cheese was very nice, but the creme brulee took the cake. Literally.

Though it is a place with an excellent ambience,and a tasty selection of cupcakes,it loses out on its ratings because of its overpriced menu card. Too overpriced.

Cutie Pie!
Ambience: The red 'The Rouge' banner, the cute entrance with a little black board beside it, a wide glass display (which is also serves as one of the walls rendering a sense of space to the tiny 10/12 seater delicatessen) with colourful macaoons and tarts and what nots make you adore the place even before you enter! On entering, its all white and rosy and just so cosy. The warm lighting does wonders for this place!  The counter has a display shelf full of mouthwatering cupcakes including their signature Red Velvet and macaroons! Though the place is tiny yet you never feel claustrophobic thanks to the clean and contemporary decor and the glass wall overlooking A.J.C Bose Road. There is a display shelf on one of the walls as well displaying colourful knick-knacks and paper napkins with messages from 'dear customers'.
Service: Prompt, efficient and always with a smile. Thank you!
Food: My mouth is watering even as I start writing about the soft, gooey, melt-in-your-mouth cupcakes with delicious toppings, the thickest shakes in town and the crunchy macaroons! There are also varieties of tea and coffee and cakes and tarts to choose from. To those who are skeptical about the right side of the menu, remember, all good things come with a price and in this case, quite literally! 
Recommendation: Their signature Red Velvet cupcake and try it with cream cheese topping...its divine! The Oreo shake is the thickest in town and served in cute and very English milk bottles.
Cheerio!

Okay, firstly I'd like to thank Zomato because this is a platform where foodies can interact with each other and write and talk about the food joints they love because  that is how I found a fellow foodie and a great pal, Chandradeep   :)
Thanks a lot, Zomato. So, he and I went to this little cafe today and the experience follows :

The Rouge : Very adorable little cafe that sits on Circular Mansion bereft of all other big eateries. Its very eye-catching.
Very pretty, small and adorable little place that is meant to fulfill all your sweet tooth pangs.
One cannot boast a lot about ambience because it isnt big, but whatever it is, it very charming.
There is a signboard outside which reads "Happyness available 7 days a week"    
             :D

Now, coming to the desserts : :
1. Banana shake
2. Oreo shake
3. Red velvet cupcake (cream n' cheese)
4. Macaroons (raspberry)

The Banana shake was yummy and tasted really great. Now, interestingly, these shakes come in glass milk bottles. Very adorable! :D
My friend had an Oreo shake and he totally worshipped it. 
The macaroons tasted really good and crispy. The raspberry juice inside blended perfectly with the chocolate layer inside and the macaroons were small, adorable and pink! :D

But, the show stealer was the cupcake, the Red Velvet cupcake.
It was just deliciously sinful. The layer of cream n cheese on top blended beautifully with the cupcake, we had ordered the regular size which costed us 100 bucks. A bit steep, I believe.

But, the taste is just terrific. I loved this quaint little cafe that looks very humble and welcoming.
While you're leaving, you can write a small message on the paper napkins as they keep them as a memento.
Go, and experience some sweet bites from here. Its worth!

Pocket pinch : :  400 /- for two

Cheers! :)

Tucked away in a cute little corner off a busy street, The Rouge is that perfect escape to your fantasy candy land. The decor is charming, and although it covers very little area,with only 3-4 tables, the ambience is cosy and warm. I'd visited with a friend, one late autumn afternoon,and bagged the seats that stared out into the street.
We'd ordered for a Chai Latte and two large cupcakes each. While I opted for a Want S'more, my friend, I believe,went for a Pinacolada. The cupcakes were as tasty as they looked, and the Chai Latte, though not quite after my taste, wasn't as bad either.
The prices are tipped towards the extravagant, and although its not someplace where  students like us can hang out every other day, The Rouge would be a perfect spot to sit and pamper yourself to a creamy cupcake every once in a while. 

Recommended. :)

I was delighted by the decor. It was cute and charming. However since I went at the end of the day, there was very little left on the desert counter.  I found the cupcakes not too appealing, the shape and finish were all wobbly. The prices for beverage were quite high. Overall it seemed to be a good change, if one wants a different experience, but not my kind of destination outlet. Mrs. Magpie, Afra Deli, Cafe Paris and Vanilla Creperie would still be better destinations.

When I see a cake shop with a catchy decor, I tend to assume it is a means to bring people to their cakes, not the only means to  to get people in. I had a choco-mint  here and the choc cupcake though was somewhat chocolaty, the mint cream (which was not the correct icing) was mildly sweet and nothing was minty about it. It disappointed me greatly as I was expecting the delicious combination of tastes of mint and chocolate, and ended up having that was like what one gets at  average road-side cake shops.

First time I am giving any place a 5.0 out of 5.0 and u guys deserve it. As soon as me and my friend entered the place the ambience and the interiors woow ed us away. It was just soo simple and yet elegant and breathtaking. The colours were divine with tons of pastels and I just loved the small victorian romantic feel of the cafe. Okay enough of the interiors.And best of all notice the awesome things people have written on the napkins which the cafe keeps as a souvenir in the place. We wrote one too. 
Coming down to cupcakes umm its not a negative point but the place doesn't have all the cupcakes in store all the time. They run out and you might guess why. So you can always check out whats available from the display. We luckily got almost all the cupcakes we wanted to taste and had the mini ones. To tell you the truth the service and the politeness of the people are really to notice. They are so polite and happy to serve you. Good things to know is you get a free mini cupcake if u check into facebook from there. I did it instantly and showed them and I got it free without any issues. The cupcakes are just out of this world. The different flavours from red velvet to marshmallow to creme br√ªlee all was decadent and divine. 
The coffee and the shakes are worth tasting too. Also the macaroons were just melt in your mouth kind so yummy and perfectly sweet. 
People who ever is reading this I would blindly recommend this place to you guys take your friend your girl friend or just be there alone and have a taste of real cupcakes rouge has to offer. One thing carrying cash is preferable cz sometimes their card machine gives trouble. Over all outside the busy streets of AJC Bose Road this is a small cozy warm cafe which is another world itself. Thanks and rouge thanks you for the yummiest cupcakes ever. :) :)

The rouge - A girl's paradise. 
<><><><><><><><><><><>
Rouge is located at 222,circular mansion , AJC Bose road . They basically serves deserts . The interiors of rouge is inspired by new york and does create an impact 

Pros :
1) We tried the hot chocolate which was very good. 
2) Their cupcakes are mouth watering we tried the rainbow , Choco love and rubus. 
3) Their macaroon the raspberry and dark chocolate are a must try .

Cons:
1) the prices are extravagant 
2) more items could be added in menu 
<><><><><><><><><><><>
Funny but Amazing tactics to Advertise: If you check-in at rouge, you get a mini cup cake free. :P 
<><><><><><><><><><><>
Conclusion: 

Overall the rouge is a fun place to visit to satiate your sweet cravings .its a 3.5 from me .

Wow! This place is amazing. The cupcakes they make out here are delicious. Its a cute little place with tiny chairs and tables. The post-its stuck arnd are a good idea of leaving a sweet msg before you leave. The staff is well mannered and and he was a well spoken man. 
He gave us some good suggestions and we loved them. 

The rates are so reasonable for the quality and the quantity of the cupcake. We even loved the packaging, it was eco friendly cuz its paper and its even chic. 

On the whole i love this place and people should try it out. There is a lot of surprises in that little cafe!!!

I read a lot of reviews saying that the prices are not worth it but wherever I have had good cupcakes I have always paid the same price for it. and the size might not be big but the taste is good. the creme brulee is amazing and so is the red velvet with the creme cheese topping.its worth the price. Totally.!!!

the most important and attractive thing about this place is it's  decor!it's like a dollhouse i must say!sweet wallpapers...cute furniture and little little things in the decor make you wanna get some for your self and visit the place more often!!though the thing that would put iron chains on u your legs and just doesn't let you enter this place would be it's insanely high pricing!!i mean who on earth (except five stars may be) sells you cupcakes that to pretty tini-mini ones for Rs.95- 100/- and like one -bite cupcakes for 50/-!!! :O
also in spite the cupcakes are good and look attractive the fact that yoy're paying soo much for them makes you just not want them!and if you take a parcel they just provide you with the box and if you ask them as to why are you not gettin their bag, they say well it's an additional 20/- for that!!!!makes you scream WHAT?!?!
the decor as i mentioned earlier is very gud and the staff is too!!bt this place gets a 4 from my side!

I started to go to Rouge when they first opened after reading an article about it in the paper.
I was curious and it was probably one the first stores of its kind at the time.

The store is a corner location, however difficult to find as the signage is somewhat covered due to stalls directly in front. The decor was cute, however very small with little seating.

I fell in love with their Red Velvet cupcake and their shakes. The portion sizes were appropriate for the price, and the flavours delicious. Being a cupcake lover, I began going there at least once a fortnight. It was always a nice experience,

I found that a few months after visiting consistently, that their portion sizes appeared smaller, and the quality and taste of their cupcakes were not as good as they used to be at the start. Not sure why this is. 

I have tried it a few more times after the more recent experiences, and found that they still were not as they used to be which was quite disappointing for me. I now have not been to The Rouge for at least a few months.

One word to describe this place is 'sweet'. It refers to the girly fairy-tale-inspired decor, the small size and the less seating capacity, and of course the food (they serve only desserts). A joint serving only milkshakes and cupcakes doesn't make sense, but the milkshakes are really good and so are some of the cupcakes. 

Overall nice place to spend time (thanks to the decor), rather than eating. A little expensive too.

It is another little dessert/cafe joint! They serve Cupcakes and Milkshakes and mini muffins! Pretty place, with nice decorated seating arrangements, well furnished! Not many places to sit though. Its a nice place to sit, especially for the ambiance! They have got nice range of milkshakes but the muffins are nothing extraordinary!
Revisited few days back and tried their Red Velvet with Cream Cheese. Loved it. Tried their Blueberry Cheesecake with too was really nice so were their macaroons. On my first visit, which was on the valentines day, they had chocolate covered strawberry pops which were heavenly. Loved that too. 
I however find Rouge a little over prices for the quantity. Do visit especially for their red velvet.

Taste: I quite liked it. My favorite is their milkshakes. Try it!

Warning: One of their staff is over-smart. He tried to misguide me. I asked for their Cheesecake and he pointed out to a cupcake and stressed that it is a cheesecake. When I let known that I know the difference, he was sheepish. At any rate, an unsettling event.

The place looks like a fairytale and the location is perfect for catching the after school crowd. But there's very,very few seats in here and it's situated on this grubby patch of road,very easily missed,really.
Now,for the food. They have coffees and cakes:rather predictable. The coffee flavours are similar to the ones in any kolkata cafe and frankly,I prefer the much cosier Mocha(a stone's throw from the rouge) if I'm going to drink a cup of coffee and relax.
As for the cupcakes,cute as little buttons but not all that spectacular to taste,they're priced sky-high,sliding into your tummy in one little bite. That's a letdown. Plus,even if they have delicious flavours on offer,they're not always available. Another disappointment is the exorbitant packing charges. If you make packing your food so expensive when you can't provide a fairly decent amount of place to sit,that makes little sense.
Macaroons are nice,but again,easily available at Afraa or other leading patisseries. If you're coming here,what I'd really suggest is booking birthday cakes here. These are really yummy,value for money.
And how can I forget,madeleines! Reasonably priced and rare to find,do try the classic french dessert with a cup of coffee. :)

I visit Kolkata once in a way and expect the very best when it comes to food. After all, thats an important part of what Kolkata is all about!

This place took me by surprise. Candy floss and butterflies is what came to my mind the second I walked it. Albeit very small, it was cute. And then I was told, I must try the Red Velvet Cup cake. Now I was introduced to Red Velvet Cake just a week back in Delhi and had throughly enjoyed it. So here I was in Foodie heaven ready to dig. 

The cupcake has chocolate frosting(dint seem right) and the base was ... DRY! 
And for the size of the cupcake, I was paying a bit too much. And if a Delhite says that in Kolkata, it rings alarm bells!

I would give this place a miss!

Undoubtedly the best cupcakes in Calcutta. Perfectly moist cakes with a variety of interesting frostings.
My favourite : Creme Br√ªlee . It's best eaten at the Cafe. Crunchy caramel on top and silky smooth custard underneath. Wonder how the came up with that flavour. 
Other flavours that are essential for any cupcake lover to try are The Rouge ( their signature cupcake with buttercream, cream cheese or chocolate frosting) 
Surprisingly, the best macaroons I have ever had. I've had macaroons from laduree and these are at par if not better sometimes.
Refreshing new place in Calcutta! Must try!

The rouge has the tendency to grow on you.. And once you're hooked on to it, you can live your dream of walking into your very own central perk and ask for the "regular"! 
The rouge is one of the prettiest places i have ever walked into.. Starting with the decor to the beautiful cupcakes on display, you can't get enough of this place.. For one, no other place in calcutta makes macroons and cupcakes like they do.. They keep it looking simple and pretty :) 
Its a place that you should try at least once to decide for yourself and trust me, it's the experience is what counts :)

The Rouge creates a perfect ambiance for a coffee and a chat over their yummy cupcakes and delicious macaroons. I am sure its a big hit with the college and high school crowd though the prices are not the most pocket friendly. Their signature Red Velvet Cupcake is really tasty and I also particularly liked the Lemon Curd Cupcake and the Chocomint Cupcake .... I do hope they add some savory items to their menu soon just to give their patrons taste buds another dimension.

The Rouge.. Located near The La Martinere For Girls School.. Arguably the best cupcake I have had in this city! Perfectly moist with rich buttercream. The Red Velvet Cup Cake - their signature cupcake with cream cheese frosting is SO awesome :D  The choco mint is also very nice.. the place is very tastefully done up .. it looks really nice with macaroon towers and all but awfully expensive. The pricing is a big issue. They could also do with a bit more creativity on their cupcakes for that price, because it is just frosting and no intricate sugar work on it.
Three and half stars from me.

With a location like that, they shud be minting money. not wit exorbitant prices but with volumes. the case is reverse here.

the cup cakes are very ordinary . they dont taste bad for kolkata standards, but for sum1 who has seen and eaten good cup cakes, this place is just Average. 
hardly any decoration, no sugar work, just frosting. 

very small cup cakes. and not delicate. although the place is very tastefully done up but awfully expensive. cup cakes are supposed to be hand crafted, shud look like pieces of art. 

there are some house bakers in delhi who do business from homes who make better cup cakes than these.. 

long long way to go ..

Was very excited to hear about a cupcake place in Calcutta, and while I agree with Jun on the price point, Rouge lived up to its reputation. Tiny space turned into a cute cafe.  Mrinalini has described it perfectly, its straight out of a lil tea place in Europe.

5 Star on the cupcakes and decor, didn't get a chance to taste the macarons as they were sold out :(. Pricing might be an issue, but if you really think about it, its cheaper than Barista and WAY better in taste/ambiance.

All in all - well done Rouge!

Good Cupcakes! Pricing is an issue.
The macarons  were overpriced for their size. Worse we ordered, Dareeling Tea and were surprises to be offered, Twinings tea bags priced at Rs. 60!. C'mon a dollar for an Rs.8 tea bag!. Thats not nice.

Will I return? Probably not.

I love cupcakes and hence I loved The Rouge! Arguably the best cupcake I have had in this city! Perfectly moist with rich buttercream (I loved the ones with raspberry and chocolate buttercream). 
The decor of the shop is lovely, it seems to be the perfect setting for any romcom movie shot, where the actress sits in a cafe by the road reading a book and wonders away! It is slightly highly priced but if you are a cupcake fan its a MUST GO! 
Seriously it reminded me of the small sweet teashops in Europe, you will get the same feel.

If you're a cupcake fan, the Rouge is definitely where you should head. Kolkata has it's fair share of ice-cream/dessert outlets, but this place is unique in its own right. Starting from the Rouge's bright interiors to the friendly staff, this place is sure to give you a good experience. The best part ofcourse is the quality of the cupcakes and the wide variety of them. For those of you looking for something new in the city, be sure to check this place out.

My children went crazy when they first stepped into the place because the first thing they saw was the macaroon tower! They caught my eye too! I loved how they had a banana cupcake because it tasted good and it was also very healthy! Now when they want a treat ill always bring them here, because you can taste the freshness in the products
