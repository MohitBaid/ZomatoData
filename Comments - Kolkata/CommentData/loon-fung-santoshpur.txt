Ordered through Zomato around 9.40pm and recieved the order finally at 15 minutes to midnight. Meanwhile, they kept lying at different intervals that the food had been dispatched already. The noodles smelled of cheap plastic (possibly the containers). Amounts were small. The veg side dish was barely a few spoonfuls. It was apparent that they had run out of food. Zomato support does not seem to have any immediate control over the restaurant and Zomato should not keep the online ordering option for such restaurants because it is an indirect endorsement. They offered to put half the amount of the order in my account but I really wish I would have cancelled the order. It is a waste of time and money and a mood spoiler.

I really don't know why this place got such poor ratings??
Food's comparable to that from the great restros of Kolkata China town... At much less price!!
Although this place has a cosy neat place off the em bypass at ajoy nagar, it mostly functions like a takeaway or a home delivery...... Don't knw why?

Ratings:
Food. . . . . . . . . 8.5/10
Value for money.. 9/10
Ambience.........7.5/10
Delivery............7.5/10

Not hygenic, hair strands in the food. Bad behaviour by delivery guy. Not at all satisfied by this place. Taste wise also it's not satisfactory. Probably would have given zero if there was an option.

Ordered soup online. Delivered on time and warm too. But the blandest sweet corn soup I ever tasted! No accompaniments provided along with either! And first time a home delivery that didnt even send menu cards along!
