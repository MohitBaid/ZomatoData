Used to lunch here when my mom isn't in home. The thali's they provide are very much like homemade dishes. The fish currys they made is very light, without any rich spices or oils and they add veggies to it, that's why i like it. The place is large enough and its located exactly in chowmatha. Only drawback is when there is a loadshedding the lights remain on here but no fans, so you have to eat without fans ,then  ..lol!..
