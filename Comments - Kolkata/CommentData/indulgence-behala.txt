Ordered a pure chocolate cake that was fresh,moist and undoubtedly delicious! The rich chocolate ganache amidst the soft layers of sponge cake makes for an absolute treat. Highly recommended!

The cake was absolutely perfect. When I ate the first bite of the cake, I had to admit that it was the best cake I ever had. The presentation and decoration was remarkable. This bakery is a bit different, and I would like you guys to try this sometime. I'm sure you won't get disappointed.

I feel nothing could match the fresh taste of this bakery. It is affordable and excellent. If you are looking for something different, this is a must try. I have already had fruit cakes, fudge cakes, cupcakes, fondant ones and more. I am definitely going to be a regular customer. Cheers to this amazing place!!
