Even though the place being near to my house I never tried this joint. After going through the reviews here, I decided to have the biriyani. The quantity as everyone said was really generous. I had the chicken biriyani with egg (very few places have the egg now and I couldn't resist it!!). Taste wise it was okay, had the smell and the flavour. The chicken in the biriyani was also well prepared. Only con, it was a little dry. But at 140 bucks and with the quantity they give it's worth a try.

Was a bit skeptical abput trying thus take away outlet but was repentant on not trying ot earlier. Had Chicken Biriyani that was perhaps from the Andromeda Galaxy.Exquisite! The people are real friendly.The quantity is fulsome.The price is tad-high,however I believe that you have to spend to eat good.
Reminded me of my friend's mom and the awsome biriyanis she cooks.Definitely recommended.

A great takeaway restaurant in North Kolkata. But more importantly, one of the best place in the city to have some quality Biryani at very reasonable rates. The quantity is more than enough. But the service is not that fast.

It is a small restaurant. No seating arrangement is there, you can get both moghlai and Chinese dish. Price of the food is very reasonable although quality and quantity of food is good.. I specially like mutton biriyani and garlic chicken.

Whenever we think of excellent but affordable biriyani, this is the only place that we think of. This place is mainly for take aways. The quantities are HUGE and the quality is also good. The quality of rice they give is really good, the chicken- moist and tender, not at all dry. So is their reshmi and tikka kebabs. Their chicken masala is also a must try. Never expected such a small food stall to have such amazing food. I have tried their chicken chow mein as well, and trust me, 1 plate of that is more than enough for 2 people with loads of chicken in it. No, the chow mein is not authentic chinese but they really taste good. I have never seen any food shop to be this generous with the quantity. Who cares what the shop looks like? As long as u can take away good quality food at affordable prices, sit and have it at the comforts of home, what could you ask for more?

Swad is basically a shop (less of a restaurant) tat sells Biriyani and other similar items. The sitting place is very congested; but they told they are planning to get a AC sitting soon. 
D Biriyani is their speciality; the taste is good; won't say excellent. The price is cheap. It's best for carry back home and eat.

Swad Restaurant is another roadside food counter located in Maniktala, few steps away from Blood Bank. You will found this restaurant crowded most of the time in evening. Unfortunately they don't have any sittings options available, not even chairs or stools on footpath. They cover a huge menu from Indian, Tandoor to Chinese but only the common dishes are available. I was willing to taste their Chopsuey but ultimately shattled with plain Egg Chowmein as evening snacks.

Egg Chowmein : Chowmein was very thin. Not a huge number of vegetables used but well mixed. Eggs & spices were also well mixed. It felt little bit oily but that's okey for most people. Taste wise not impressive, it didn't tasted that good. Some odd spicey taste were felt. As expected the sauces provided was very bad & made the noodles taste disgusting. Quantity was quite average, may be tummy filling for some people.

Prices were little bit higher than same catagory of food counters. Their food quality isn't satisfying & their lower rating shows it well. No at all recommended.

Swad's chicken biriyani is awesome. Quantity also is quite good I must say. Only backlog is there is no arrangement of sitting. Other dishes like reshmi kabab, chicken tandoori are also of quite good quality. Price is also reasonable.

Swad is my ideal biryani joint. Cheap-ish Biryani, but still good Biryani. They serve up massive portions, and they aren't stingy.

Their biryani has the rice, the meat and the potato. Add a few rupees more and they'll throw in an egg as well. The food is good enough for me -- I could have this 3 times a week. The only problem with Swad is that they don't sell 'chaap'. They do sell 'korma' and 'tarka', but that's no accompaniment for Biryani. Luckily enough, Swad is located right next to another Biryani joint, which does serve up oily chaap.

They're prompt and they're good value for money. My ideal Friday night.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Good food at reasonable price. Biriyani is worth trying. The drawback is there is no place to sit and dine. You can only go for take away services. The quantity is quite good and a plate of fried rice or chowmin can be sufficient for two.

I love the biriyani of this small food joint on the busy route of maniktalaand dinendra street. The price is lower than other popular hotspots around this area. The quality of rice is too much. But the size of meat is small.
The ambience is inapproriate for dine in. It is preferrable to parcel the food.

Go For Chicken Clear Soup & Chicken Biryani. The other food items are injurious to health. 
The cash collectors act as if they are doing us a huge favour by giving us food , they are exremely rude and don't know how to talk even their body language reeks of rudeness . Btw the place is totally unhygienic and there is only option of take away thats it. Thank God no dine in.
