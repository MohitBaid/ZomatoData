This sweet shop has come up in College Street just few years back, just in front of my eyes. Those days, I was very regular to college Street area due to my tutuion commitments there.

Though I am not much fond of sweet, the visit here was owing to various other reasons, primarily being visiting a friend's house and similar stuffs.

The people out here are extremely friend and polite. They will not ignore you even in the peak hours. The area inside is clean and stands out from the rest.

I have generally took sweets and stuffs from here for others and hardly remember trying anything. Though, I have tried few sandeshes which turned out to be very good.

I haven't visited this place in recent past and would surely like to visit it.

A simple sweet confectionary located at College Street, selling Bengali sweets at a reasonable price.

Service is good.

Tried Rosogolla & Sondesh . Both were nice & fresh but still nothing to rave about.

Kalpana Sweets is located in Surya Sen Street. The place serves good quality sweets. I have been here a number of times sweets are good quality. I liked their Rosogolla and lancha very much.
