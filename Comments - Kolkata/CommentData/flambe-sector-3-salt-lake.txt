We went to Flambé on dashami during the pujas. We ordered Chicken tangri kebab, Fish orly, Lat me kai, Apple sangria & Sizzling brownie with ice-cream from the menu. Of all the dishes, the chicken was undoubtedly the best. The brownie was not so good according to me as it was not soft enough and too big for one person to complete. Overall, it has a decent number of items that one can order.

very spacious restaurant in the heart of salt lake city. on the second floor of the soujourn it gives a panoramic view of the stadium and the adjoining area which is a feast for the eyes because of its lushness. 
the soups are hot and appetising and there is a variety of mocktails to accompany the lunch or dinner. The starters in the menu increase the appetite because of their unique taste and the main course is delicious to the taste bud and satisfying to the soul.
hot gulab jamuns and ice cream are the best options to finish off the meal.

Food -4/5
Ambience -3/5 ( More of restaurant at a hotel)
Service -4/5
Price -4/5
Hygiene- 4.5/5
Parking -4/5

This place is located right opposite the Yuva Bharati Stadium. It's a small and quaint eatery located in silence of Salt Lake. This restaurant is basically the restaurant for Hotel Sojourn. 

Coming to the ambience, there is nothing wrong or bad but its small with around 5-6 tables. This eatery is frequented more by nearby people who come for a casual snacks or people who stay at the hotel.

Pricing is ok with almost all snacks items being set at ~200-300

We had ordered Tandoori Paneer and Fish Fingers. Both of them were fresh and juicy and nice in taste. 

Service was prompt with hotel staff doubling as waiters.

Parking can be done in the service lane.

USP- Situated right opposite Salt Lake Stadium, this small and quiet place is quite a pull to have quick yet flamboyant snacks/ meal.

Restaurant of The sojourn - flambé located at the 2nd floor of the renowned hotel- serves a multicuisine food. On the broadway of salt lake, just beside the AMRI hospital - the service riad in front of it has a decent place to park your car. 
Coming to the ambience - a well lit area with good seating arrangements. The pillars in between gives it a classy look.
Service again they are quite generous. Food ordered is served fast and promptly. People serving are well behaved.
Food- we had :
Chicken tom yum soup- tangy but quite tasty 
Badshahi tangdi- well coooked leg pieces cooked in a creamy paste; 4 pieces in one plate
Masala kulcha- very well made, a tasty stuffing with soft outer layer
Malai kofta- a little on sweeter side but gives a good company
Radiwala gosht- a must try, the thick keema gravy with tender mutton pieces: just too good
Caramel custard- well made, not so sweet; just the way it should be 
In a nutshell- prices are on a little higher side but the taste will never disappoint.

This is located beside charnock city. A decent restaurant with amazing decorum. Service is quite good. We took the little app deal-lunch for two is Rs490. In that we had tom yum soup which didn't tastes well, in starter we had kurkure lemon chicken which was moderate, then in main course we had veg hakka chowmin and manchurian chicken which still tastes good, and in dessert we had hot fudge brownie which was yummy. In short the place is nice but the food quality can be better.

Flambe is located conveniently beside the amri hospital. They have a parking lot for two wheelers,dont know about four wheelers. Entering the hotel ,it has a very soothing ambience. The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor. Being a 3star restaurant the interior is classy and posh. Coming to the food and service, we ordered tomato soup and veg seekh kabab for starters.
I liked the taste of both the soup and kabab.We were served 4 pieces of kabab accompanied by green chutney.
For main course we ordered veg pulao,dal fry ,paneer butter masala and stuffed kulcha.
Veg pulao-It was totally bland ,it felt like the rice was just mixed with vegetables and they forgot to add anything else. So 1 out of 5 for it.
Dal was okayish but the quantity was too less.
Paneer butter masala was good but again quantity was very less.We were served some 4 pieces of paneer.2 out of 5 for both the dishes.
Stuffed kulcha-This was my favourite.i just loved the taste ,the stuffing in it perfectly complemented the kulcha.4 out of 5.
For desert we opted for hot fudge brownie with chocolate sauce-Brownie was awesome .It was warm and chocolaty and perfectly satiated my sweet buds.
I would give a 5 out of 5 for brownie.
Service was very quick,the waiter was also friendly with us.

Located in salt lake , a multi cuisine restaurant, with a tranquil and lush green atmosphere coupled with modern architecture offers mainly Indian and Chinese cuisine.
For starters , we took chicken let me kai, kurkure lemon chicken which were average.Fresh lime soda was decent.
For main course , we had Vegetables in green Thai sauce, Kung pao vegetables, fish in hot garlic sauce, Hunan chicken, Schezwan fried rice, mix Hakka noodles, Singaporean noodles, cucumber salad and green salad .
Kung pao vegetables was nicely done and went well with Singaporean noodles, vegetables in green Thai sauce and mix Hakka noodles were average. Fish in hot garlic sauce was pretty good. Hunan chicken was nicely cooked and delectable .
At last it was time for desserts, we had Caramel custard and Darsan, both were enjoyable.
Ambience was good, staffs were polite, service was bit slow. Pocket pinch is fine.

After pandal hopping on ashtami we were looking for an indian restaurant to have some roti & boti without much hullaballoo in a quiet cosy place. My brother in law & husband are very frequent to this place & late night food for them means Sojourn..! Valet parking available, warm welcome by the outdoor staff , lift with a view of main road takes u up to the restaurant. Nice cosy place, tables were nicely laid, loved the lightings & ambience. We ordered Nan, gandhoraj murgi, jhinga Shabnami, daal makkhanwala, aerated drinks & brownie with ice cream. The taste was good but the portion was too less, the curries served was too less to have with breads or rice. Otherwise the service & staff were quick and taste was good.

Try their mutton raan or tandoori chilli chicken (yes, it's yummy) or go for continental option. Lot of variety, nice ambience, affordable price point and good service....

Flambe is the main restaurant at The Sojourn Hotel which is located in Sector 3, near Salt Lake Stadium. The restro is on the 2nd floor, next to their bar, Qube.

The interiors and decor is pretty classy and is set in a dim lit ambience. The place is big enough to accommodate 50-60 people. The menu is extensive and has both Indian and Chinese cuisines.

Coming to the food, for soups we had Manchow and Sweet Corn. The crispy fried noodles with the manchow soup were nice. Although the both the broths were average.
In starters, Crispy Chilli Babycorn was nice both in terms of quality and quantity. Veg Seekh Kebab could have been better.
Vegetable Balls and Crispy Veg in Chilli Garlic Sauce were also okayish.
Same was the situation with Fried Rice and Hakka Noodles.
In short, all the food items had minor flaws here and there which affected the over all taste.

Desserts, however, were a saving grace. The Fudge Brownie was too good with a tempting presentation and chocolate sauce all over. Darsaan was quite amazing too and had been well prepared.

The service needs to improve and the staff needs to be a bit more courteous. To sum it up, this place can be a one time visit, just for the sake of trying out a new spot.

Once or twice after an alcohol marathon at their pub - QUBE , i have stopped by this place for dinner. It's strategically located in salt lake sector 3, near AMRI. I love the complete glass lift that goes to the restaurant!! Well on most occasions the place was deserted and even if there were guests they were mostly in house. They interiors are tastefully done with lots of glass that overlooks the road, the staff are diligent, the food is quite good. They also offer a variety of cuisines- North Indian, Chinese, Bengali,Continental; though I have only had chinese or salads there. I love the food quality, but prices are slightly high.

I hope they would do some brand promotions to bring in more guests. I wish them the very best for the future!!

I've visited Sojourn countless numbers of times, it being really close to home, and hence the most favored by my family. They have a simple decoration and is quite cozy. The food is really good, both Indian and Continental. I really like their Stroganoff and Fish florentine.
The staff is extremely friendly and are really nice to us all the times that we visit.

Update – this year we decided to try out some of the continental items on offer – I went for a chicken steak and my mother ordered a plate of chicken penne pasta in white sauce. Both the items were extremely flavourless. We had also ordered a plate of fried bhetki as starter, which was only slightly better. And the chicken biriyani, which was my father’s choice for the night, was equally disappointing. I don’t know whether their quality has taken a nosedive or they are extremely inept at handling continental fare. I would recommend others to stick to their Indian and Asian offerings.

PS – they also charged 35 bucks for a bottle of mineral water priced at 20 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ashtami night of Durga Pujo means a visit to Salt Lake with family, and invariably culminates with dinner at Sojourn. They stay open well into the night, at least during the Pujo days, when even the established names in the vicinity and beyond have shut shop. Also, I have never found this place to be overly crowded; just the right number of patrons and the proper amount of chitter-chatter around you to enjoy a comfortable meal. And the best part - they welcome you with the sound of 'dhaak' playing.

Flambe offers Chinese, continental, and Indian dishes. I don't know whether it's because of the Pujo, but the Indian choices on the menu always out-number their Chinese and continental counterparts. We usually go for Chinese, and all the preparations are quite tasty. Moreover, the portions are quite large, and the servings are usually enough for 3 to 4 people. Special mention must be made of the fish orly here. Pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side, but when it's the season of festivities, we are not too judgmental about this aspect.

Flambe turned out to be one of my worst dining experiences in recent times. 

Located on hotel sojourn , it's SUPPOSED to be their family restaurant. But the loud television, guys drinking and talking loudly were few things that suggested otherwise. The decor is very ok and I missed some good music alongside. The staff service is not up to the mark too.

Coming to food, the place has a variety of options to try from at reasonable prices. Tried the clear soup , manchow soup and crispy shilling babycorn. Food was very okkayish with good serving sizes. But just could not bear the place for its main course.

Overall, a pretty pathetic place to dine in my opinion.

We went there twice.
First time with the groupon buffet deal.
Lemme tell you that I wasn't much aware of this restro before but as I was looking for some buffet spread in groupon. I've been to almost all buffet places in salt lake but not this so we opted for & the deal was quiet reasonable. 
Its a real good hotel, very neat, good ambience, nice behaviour of ppl out there but there was only one starter in the buffet menue. Though it was mentioned already & deal based stuff are like that only so we wanted to add something in starter outside the buffet. 
They suggested chic taangri & it was super delicious.
The rest of the food were ok ok.
&& the next time I took my sis along.the first thing I ordered was the chic taangri & this time it was definitely ala carte!!

Sojourn's continental dishes are really good, lots of time I went for a lunch here and the lamb sizzler is my fav. Few of Indian dishes are also nice. I like the service and overall ambience.

Nothing to go ga-ga for Flambe-Hotel The Sojourn. Food was just OK. Ambience gives you a feeling of hang over as the curtains and the walls weren't washed since ages. The portion which they give for rice is quiet less. I would say the attendants were quiet active and very courteous. I think this restaurant runs because of the staff and not food. When I say "make it little spicy", so it doesn't mean the chef needs to pour in all spices he have in his stock. The chilli chicken really brought tears in my eyes. It's the staff behaviour that makes up for all the flaws. Thus, a very average place with average food...
Thank you

Be it the deshi delights or saucy chinese, your pick is always served, chow down these yummies at The Sojourn. The Sojourn is a 3-star hotel located in Salt Lake just beside AMRI Hospital and opposite of Yuba Bharati Stadium. Flambe, a multi-cuisine restaurant located within the walls of Sojourn Hotel, engages taste buds with food mainly Indian & Chinese delicacy. The tranquil locality with lush green vegetation provides a soothing and relaxing respite from the turmoil of everyday busy life. Replete with modern facilities and exquisite architecture, effort is put to ensure guests feel home. Diner indulges while their inner selves sway softly to easy listening music.

It was already late for lunch so we started off with ‘Chicken Let Me Kai’ & ‘Kurkure Lemon Chicken’ both starters were very average. In fact Kurkure Lemon Chicken was the worst I have eaten till now; cook must have thinking something else while making this dish. ‘Fresh Lime Soda’ had decent taste and nothing to complain about. For Main course we ordered ‘Vegetables in Green Thai Sauce’, ‘Kung Pao Veg’, ‘Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce’, ‘Hunan Chicken’, ‘Schezwan Fried Rice’, ‘Mix Hakka Noodles’, ‘Singaporean Noodles’, ‘Cucumber Salad’ and ‘Green Salad’.  Kung Pao Vegetables was nicely done and it went well with Singaporean Noodles but Vegetables in Green Thai Sauce was missing that tuning with Mix Hakka Noodles and tastes average. Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce had nice flavour but it tasted salty enough to ruin my mood. Hunan Chicken was well cooked and finally I got something to enjoy. For desserts we opted for ‘Caramel Custard’ and ‘Darsan’. Both desserts were enjoyable, nice way to finish our lunch.

Had a Chinese meal at Flambé yesterday. The ambience and decor is pretty good. The sofas offer a plush and comfortable seating. 
The service is average though , and there was quite a delay to serve the food, even though the number of guests were few.
The Chinese items we ordered were a bit spicier than our liking. The caramel custard with chocolate sauce came without the chocolate sauce, and on being asked, were told that this is how it comes ????. The food can be categorized as average. The portions were adequate though.

Walked into this place for a quick lunch and a beer. Was not looking for a new experience or anything. I'm from Cal where the food is generally good and I found all the local favorites on the menu. I ordered the Fish Orly, a Cal continental staple made famous by Bijoli Grill. Nearly 45 min later I was served piping hot fish coated in soggy batter which tasted like wet cardboard. The food was taken out of the freezer, sat on the counter and was then microwaved. Cheats!
Avoid this shithole at all costs. If you are at AMRI or at the old age home at the corner and fancy desi Chinese or Tibetan food then walk over to the Blue Poppy at the Sikkim House down the road. That's what I did. The complete lack of ambience there is more than made up for the great food they serve.

Flambe - The Sojourn, located opposite the Salt Lake Stadium and beside the AMRI, is one of the "easiest to find" restaurants in the city. 
Ups for the restaurant: The ambiance and the neat decor, the taste and quality of the food. Tangri Lajawab (Chicken cooked in tandoor but topped with lots of cheese) is an appetizer to be a must on the platter. Redhiwala Gosht is nice too. 
Downs: The limited choice of desserts.
Overall, it is a good dining experience. People working at Flambe...all the best for the years to come!
