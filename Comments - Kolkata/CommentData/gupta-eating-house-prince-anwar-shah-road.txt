It is slightly difficult to find this place.The food served here is simply delicious.And I don't know how to do they manage such awesome food with such cheaper rates.The eating place is very small.Only two small tables are there.so its better to pack your food.They serve a variety of dishes.The items are generally spicy.Have tried their Tadka,Butter Paneer,Egg tadka,chana masala and have been left fully satisfied.Never had any digestion problems either.Service is lightning fast here.Would surely recommend this restaurant to everyone

Its a very little shop mainly take away joint. They have two shops but seating capacity is 8-10. But ambience is not that good so I recommend for taking away. They make good food in comparison to their cost. I have tried chana masala, kofta, chilli chicken, chicken kabab, palak paneer. They use same set of spices for all types of dishes. But they are tasty and I never faced any kind of digestion prob ;)
