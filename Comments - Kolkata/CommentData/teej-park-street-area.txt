A pure vegetarian restaurant that serves food at pocket friendly prices and liquor at throwaway rates is a boon for fans of Rajasthani cuisine. 
Though the restaurant serves North Indian and other fare, to get the best out of your Teej experience, do order the dal-batati-churma, a Rajasthani specialty. 
The restaurant is almost always crowded, so there might be a slight wait for the tables but the ambience and food quite make up for it.

Visited this place yesterday.
A nice place veg restro situated above Gangaur, Park Street.
Restro serving pure veg food specially rajasthani food thats really good in taste.
Ambiance is nice. Inspite of monday, it was almost full.
Serving staff is well behaved and interiour gives u a feel of some rajasthani haveli..

If i tlk abt food its is good but not wht i expected after seeing interiours..

Overall a nice llace to visit along with friends and family.
A place if u want to spend nice time and good food with some rajasthani taste of music and food.

Experience was okayish...service was not that good...food also nothing much to write about as the gravy tasted same in all the items. Roti was chewy and hard..only bonus is that it’s a pure veg restaurant but there are better ones at the same price range

I didn't like this place at all... 
We ordered Thali which was pathetic. The taste was very bad. 
We ordered palaak paneer and Roti also. 
Rori tandoori is highly overpriced.  I have not eaten a tandoori roti for Rs. 75 in five star hotels. Palaak paneer was okaish. 
The only respite was chilly babycorn which was good.  Surprisingly in a Rajasthani type hotel,  a Chinese starter was good. 
Overall disappointed.

Finally the wait got over and we visited this place on 27th August. I loved the decor. Ordered fusion platter and Soup of the day which was Tamatar Dhania Shorba.
We were just 2 people so got full by having this much. Excellent food. Great decor. Great service. Loved Teej ❤️

Location- Situated in the russel street, it has one of the prime location in kolkata. Available fee parking space.
Ambience- Traditional rajasthani ambience is surely gonna win your heart. The cutleries used will also give a rajasthani flavour.
Food- North Indian food, be it paneer sabji or dal makhani, everything has a good taste. Pudina lachha paratha is a good option for bread. They serve hard drinks too at a reasonable rate, so its a cherry on the cake.
Price- Being such a famous and reputed restaurant in kolkata, the price they charge is quite reasonable. A group of 4 can have their full fledged dinner for 1500 only.
Overall- A nice place for sunday dinner with family.

Went to the Restaurant today.

Asked the Staff if Jain Thali is available (speficially saying that even Carrots would not be acceptable to us). He said everything would be available. He said that he would substitute the Potato Sabzi with Mixed veg (without carrots).

When the Thali was served, the Mixed Veg had Carrots. On Complaining, he replaced it with Paneer. So Now, I had the Maharaja Thali with 2 Paneer Sabzi and 2 Black Dals Period.

Some mins later, he asks that the Kulcha has Potato so what I would like in place. I asked for Lacchedar Paratha and someone shouts from behind that It is not possible. THE GUYS COMMENTS WERE VERY VERY RUDE.

Lost all interest in eating the food. Even the usual Chaas or Jal Zeera was not served. 

Service : Horrible
Staff Behaviour : RUDE.

They need to improve their behaviour otherwise people will SURELY avoid the Restaurant.

The ethnicity of the restaurant was worth mentioning... from German silver spoons and glass to pure silver dishes... the restaurant made us feel like we have travelled all the way to Punjab or Rajasthan to have our thali. The thali was unlimited... with Punjabi thali having preparations like paneer butter masala, mixed vegetable Kali dal... with choice of rotis. All except sweets and chaanch was unlimited. It was value for money meal and a nice ambience to have typical north Indian Veg thali.

Too good to be a legend.
This restaurant has been here for like ages and I got a chance to be here for the first time. The ambience is what amazed me. The decor was absolutely stunning. The staff is here for ages and are veterans in their business. 
We only had the starters. We tried the American corn salt and pepper, spring roll and corn ke seekh kebab. They were awesome. I only didn't like the American corn salt and pepper, since they were not that great compared to others.

Nothing to say about the ambience... Just about normal... 
Lets come to the food --->
Soups :- We ordered sweet corn soup and manchow soup which was pretty good and had a decent texture.
Starters:- Crispy chilli baby corn and dahi wale kebab. Both were excellent. The kebab was perfectly grilled just loved it. :)
Main Course:- For main course we had dal teej ( one of the signature dishes) which was not very good but satisfying. Shaam savera was the dish which disappointed me. It is supposed to have paneer/chena inside but it looked as if it was made of spinach only. Even the gravy's texture was not good. It was not creamy at all. The rajasthani thali was perfect undoubtedly. Biryani was bland.. Some more spices would have definitely went well.

Corn soup which was horrible.. then we ordered the main course the vegetables  were bad.. then we complained the waiters were good but the manager (cashier )was very rude and behaved badly.. i think if teej goes on this way then we need to atop going out there..

TEEJ by its name only we get a feeling of something traditional. The place interior is core and ethnic which gave the feel of Rajasthani background and the service people are also dress like that with a pagdi on their heads which made me feel more of traditional. From the plates to the interior to the dress of the service people. Come to the food it provide the best vegetarian food which is lovely for the pure vegetarian lovers. On top of this this place serve drinks vegetarian restaurant which provides drinks is a great combo. Loved the place hope to visit again traditionally 😀

Spellbound and awestruck. Terrific thalis and a great ambience too. Going to Gangaur and instead shifted to Teej was perhaps the best decision we ever took. We friends went for a casual lunch and instead were subjected to this awesome rajasthani thali. All the products were good, especially the chachh and the rotis. Must go for any north Indian who misses his home in Kolkata.

This place is all a veg or a marwadi resto should be. From their Rajasthani thali to chinese soup they deserve a thumbs up from both hands. Its serves the best Rajasthani platter in park street. 
Try their Munchow soup, Fusion Platter, Garlic naan and panner tikka masala. I love this place so much and yet have been here only twice bcoz its costly mann.. The staff members and the waiters ee very courteous and the ambience is also killer. Would recommend this place to every1.

The whole place is decorated with different rajasthani elements ,staffs,waiters,gatekeepers  are dressed in rajasthani attire...Ambience is too good.

Its a perfect all vegetarian family eating out place. Looks good. The whole decor is very Rajasthani. Waiters dress the similar way. It has best royal looking bar, like you would see in Jodhpur palaces thing. The utensils are biig thalis, and silver ware. And the paintings in stair case is a sure eye catcher.. minus one point for the food taste. I have tasted better authentic Rajasthani food in lesser famous restaurants in town.. this one sure doesn't serve the authentic tasting thing. Pinch in pocket 3.5/5. Other north Indian food tastes ok

Went there for lunch with my family in September, 2016. What a horrible experience. The food was pathetic and worse was the attitude of the staff there. They were literally making faces while serving and taking orders. Absolutely no other guests at this restaurant while we were there, which goes on to show how much business they are doing these days. Well deserved. Someone who has not tasted genuine Rajasthani fare will probably like the food here. Nevertheless, I can forgive the taste of the food but not the unprofessional behavior of the staff. Moreover, the decor looks tacky & old, to say the least. Never Again.

I have been visiting this place since childhood, my father used to take us there on special occasions. It had a real class and I used to be in awe of its magnificent maharaja style decoration coupled with a royal delicious spread. There is no doubt that it has lost some of its charm over the years, but we still do visit this place maybe couple of times in a year. The food is really good, specially malai kofta, dal makhani and breads. The cutlery is all bronze and you should once visit it if you haven't been already.

Had ordered Dal Baati Churma and other Rajasthani dishes, rather to have Dal Baati Churma, had specially visited this place. They serve authentic Rajasthani cuisine. The food was pretty good and the quantity was more than sufficient. After all the efforts, couldn't finish the food afterall. Like the decors and the ambience. Overall, a goid experience. :)

A pure vegetarian, family restaurant. This place is a definitely worth a visit if you're looking for good vegetarian food, with a decent atmosphere. The service here is pretty reliable as they guide you through the menu. They know what they are serving and they are quick at it. The food is pretty good and standard. 
The ambience is great. It's soothing, and there's a great music playing along. 
We had, masala kulcha, Butter naan, dal Teej, Panner Sartaj, Paneer Kulcha, Gratin and Veg Pulao. 
It gives you a pure Rajasthani vibe, as they have kept the interiors intact to their roots. It was lovely being there. :)

Heaven for Pure Vegetarian marwadi foodies!!
Guys every item at this place offers proper north Indian taste. Rajasthan themed restaurant with soft Rajasthani music playing inside brings you into a completely different world. Quality of food is awesome & they know the proper combination of spices to be used while cooking veg north indian food. Almost every restaurant have  "Daal Makhani" on their menu card but no one can beat the taste of "Daal Makhani" here at Teej.. A must try!!

You will truly get the feel of being in Rajasthan once you enter this place. The decor is so good, one will feel like going on admiring the interiors. The food is excellent and a whole lot different to that served in many vegetarian restaurants of Kolkata. Make sure you are that much hungry before ordering a thali otherwise you will end up wasting food. The service is prompt and excellent. The Thalis are good, so also some of the traditional stuff like Jodhpur Mirch ke pakode. The entry to this place is a bit difficult to locate and if you aren't specifically searching for this place then it is very easy to miss the entry. So do be careful on that. That I guess is the only drawback, otherwise it is one of the best vegetarian restaurants to be at in Kolkata.

Easy to locate. Beside Gangaur Sweets, Russel Street. The restaurant is on the 1st floor of the building.

It was a Sunday afternoon & we had to wait for 10 minutes. Fair enough.

The decor has a royal touch - 3.5/5.

We ordered Kesaria Lassi - 5/5 and Rajsi Thali - 3.5/5.

I would have rated the Rajsi Thali 4.5 until few days back, but recently I've had the Rajasthani thali at Maharaja Bhog in Mumbai, which was way better. More varieties & food tastes much much better.
Anyway, for Rajasthani thali in Kolkata, Teej is the best option for you.

Service is prompt - 5/5.

Portion is good - 5/5.

Recommended!
            

Okay I would like to add few more things based on my recent visit to Teej again.

We had Paneer Kulcha - 4/5,  Jaipuri Vegetables - 4/5, Pasta in White Sauce 5/5 & Mango Delight - 3/5.

Again, Recommended!

A destination for royal rajasthani cuisine.
Ordered Maharaja Rajasthani Thali.
Right from Daal Bati Churma to belmi puri, it was wholesome rajwada cuisine with blended fragnance of royality.
Its a unlimited thali for which you just have to pay 400 bucks which is quite pocket friendly.
Fine dining, royal ambience, courteous staff is their USP.
Space and waiting time is problem on weekends.
Higly recommanded to veggie lovers.

Teej - The real adobe of Rajasthani & Gujarati cuisine in Kolkata.

It's more than a restaurant, it's an experience; an experience everyone must have at least once while in Kolkata.
Ambiance is royal, and by royal I mean Rajasthani royal. The windows and architecture reminds you of the palaces where kings used to live back in time. Silver plated utensils. Courteous staff, I would recommend you to ask them about signature specials of Teej. You get two options there: A La Carte or Thali. You wont regret either. Bar is available inside, so you dont have to be 'dry' just because you are in a Veg restaurant. :)

I have tried Maharaja Thali and Rajasthani Thali there. Both were amazing, you wont be able to count the dishes in your thali, trust me.

If you prefer North Indian (I know I do) in a generic way, I suggest you go for Maharaja Thali. It is an amalgam of Rajasthani and conventional North Indian delicacies. Rajasthani Thali might get a little too 'technical' for some.

Realistic cost for two comes to 1100-1300. This restaurant is a God-send, have fun!

So to sum it up if you looking forward to try some good North Indian (especially marwari) food it's a must go place. Good place to go with your family. It's a theme based pure veg restaurant , exploring the rajasthani culture. So if you want to experience the proper rajasthani Fort kind of experience it's the right place. What compliments it is it amazing food. Even for non-vegetarians it will be a delight to have veg food. Good quantity of food, coupled with swift cordial service & not a great pinch to the pocket. I'll definitely recommend a dine out at teej.

For people nursing a Rajasthan-sized Marwari hangover, Teej is an obvious choice. More than a month after spending 2 weeks in Rajasthan, we were still missing the tawa parathas and simple subzis. So we hoped for some nostalgia at Teej. Several of the a-la-carte options were very tempting but in the end, thali it was. We had the Rajsi thali which was everything we were expecting. Chaas, dal bati churma, gatte, ker sangri, aloo, missi roti. New for us was the super thin yet stuffed bedwi puri which was almost puran poli-like in appearance and a worthy competitor to radhaballavi. I loved it. The chaas was refreshing. Everything on the thali was above average, satisfying. The sangri though had yogurt mixed through. My guess is the yogurt had gone bad which left the sangri with a weird taste. Quite the disappointment. I also missed a khichdi, either the regular or bajra. Dessert was a random chamcham from Gangaur downstairs. Nevertheless, it was excellent! Good meal and great choice for those vegetarians who like an accompanying drink!

A positive word about the decor and ambience, it takes you right back. Especially one of the wooden painted doors looks like it was pulled right out of a Marwar fort palace.

Disclaimer: My review is primarily based on the fact that I have had similar themed restaurants with better service and food quality.
This place has a very nice ambience with a Rajasthani setup. They serve the food in silver-polished ware. Feels like a king!!
The food is very good. We had tried the Rajasthani Thali and Maharaja Thali and everything in it was lip-smacking. However, I feel the Thali missed a drink - something like Jaljeera or Masala Chaas would have been a good accompaniment with the sumptuous food.
The service is pretty good and the staffs keeps on checking if you need anything.
One con about the place is that they serve the Thali with all the food already served in it. This results into a lot of wastage of food. I would prefer the food/dishes being served in front of us so that people take only what they want and how much they want.

Christmas eve, went to Teej for dinner. Group of 4 adults and a kid. Having heard so much abt this place from our relatives, i had high expectations from this place.
Ambience: It was rustic, comfortable and inviting. The painitings in the outside walls reminded me of chowki dhaani in mumbai. The menu reminded me of the same too..
Food:  For starters against my wishes we ordered for a chinese starter along with Indian starters. Crispy chilli babycorn, a stuffed aloo starter, masala papad and tomato soup. The crispy chilli baby corn was the best i have ever had. Sweet and spicy it just was perfect for the chilly weather. All the starters were amazing and we were enjoying a lovely meal. 
Mains we ordered for a paneer sartaj, paneer in mild cashew gravy and a dal makhni along with bedwi puri (small soft tawa rotis with spicy lentil fillings) and masala kulchas. The bedwi was a first and tasted nice on its own. it was like a soft flat version of a kulcha. Paneer was soft as expected in any restaurants in kolkatta. For desserts we ordered a kulfi which was rock hard and was complete disappointment.
Service: The service was prompt and attentive . Being Christmas eve, the guys did well to keep the place bustling and orders moving.
Great food and great atmosphere indeed.

Missed Rajasthani and Gujrati food ever since Rajdhani shut down its operation in Kolkata. So went to Teej. Liked the Dal Bati Churma..Service is good, though I think price is a little more than Rajdhani. A variety of daal could be better than just one daal.Also a few chutneys and achaars would be desirable along with the Thali...Rest all is ok

I read all the good reviews here in zomato and visited this place. We ordered one rajasthani thali and one north  indian thali. I had lot of expectation for rajasthani food which was about to be broken. 
Many dishes in the thali including churma and bati were full of dust. You can feel the same while chewing. I went there specially for the churma. 
The service was horrible. You need to call the waiter everytime you need anything. There is no attention to customers although it was almost empty restaurant. 
Now comes ambience and cleanliness. As you walk to stairs you can see visibly dirty carpets. The cloths and pagdi of waiters were so poor and dirty. The lack of cleanliness was everywhere around the place. 
I am really disappointed.

As usual, visited Gangaur for breakfast, but it was a full house owing to today being a Sunday and this being a festive season.
The security guard advised me to walk in to Teej instead with an affirmation that the same breakfast would be served at Teej instead of Gangaur!
So, entered Teej for the first time in my life and was impressed by the interior decor. The management has tried a lot to give it a Rajasthani Rajwad look! There are hand made paintings and Raajsi decors everywhere. Even the windows are styled according to Havelis!
We ordered Club Kachori, Jalebi and Kesharia tea. We were served in silver plates with banana leaves placed atop - indeed, we got a "Monarch" feeling. The first round of Kachoris were not nice - overcooked in haste - black and maroon.
So, we requested replacement of the same. The manager instantly replaced the same with better crisp ones. Kachori as usual was nice and sabji hot and tasty. Kesharia jalebi was also very good. Tea was ok.
Later, we ordered paper masala dosa - which was tasty. Also, chutney and sambhar were nice. 
Service should have been much better - I believe that since these staff generally serve lunch and dinner - they did not have god experience with serving breakfast - and they kept on making quite a few mistakes.
Prices are a bit on the higher side but the ambience was nice and we enjoyed our breakfast peacefully!

Visited this place with a friend and our criteria was to have veg food without garlic and onion. The 1st thing that impressed us was the decor. The images of Rajas and Ranis, the intricate paintings on the walls and ceilings, the windows and doors, all give a feeling as if we are in the middle of the dessert state. 
We ordered for Rajasthani thali and soon we got thali with 10 food items and 2 special types of rotis. Food was good and I cannot comment much in that as I am new to Rajasthani dishes but the service was even better. We did not order to repeat Dal but as soon as they found that we have done with dal, fresh hot dal arrived to relish our palate. Now that's really impressive.

We tried out this place a couple of months back. One of the best places to have Rajasthani food. Situated in the hubbub of park street, you can still blink and miss the entrance. The ambience is soothing and has a typical old-age feel to it which makes you feel at home. The servers are attentive and helpful.

The food is amazing. We ordered Dhania Paneer Seek Kebab, Naan, Rajasthani Masala Puri, Pindi Chana and Pudina Alu. We simply loved it. 

The Pudina Alu and the Masala Puri were our favourites

You should consider going there if you are craving for authentic rajasthani food! I liked both rajasthani and the north indian thalis but the ambience suits the rajasthani cuisine served! Even the crockery they use are like that! Nice place to dine.They serve good quantity without compromising with the quality.

Warning: do not go to this place if you aren't hungry like a dog.

Located above Gangaur near the India Hobby Centre, this place can be easily missed unless you are specifically searching for it. Do not go for ala carte because there's clearly some other speciality of this place: thalis. 

There are two options: punjabi and rajasthani and both equally good and wholesome. Have never been able to finish off either of the thalis in the four times I have ordered them (too much food wasted).

What works in its favor is that you have a bar available, too, so a beer along with the punjabi thali works just great.

Tip: do not go just for a casual drink or two. The aunties will kill you with judging eyes.

My Dad's personal favourite for god knows how long, Teej is the first choice when he thinks of north indian food. The veg dum biryani is by far the best I have had in Kolkata. 
Famous for its Rajasthani food, it hardly has been able to please my taste buds.

Located just off Park Street, this place has a quaint and small looking entrance, and never would you expect it to lead to a nice big space with decor that makes this establishment look rather grand. The food is wonderful and the service is really good. The staff and the management always take enough care to be present at your beck and call. The food is Delicious. I'm a hardcore meat eater but this is one of the very few places that I've actually enjoyed vegetarian food in.

Have tried a variety of dishes here but the thali is simply lip smacking.. The thali had sangri, kadhi, daal, gatte, 2 types of bread,2 sweets, dahi vada etc and othr stuffs which i dnt remember now.. The thali was grtt.. It is wasnt too oily although the thali has too much of variety merely making it impossible for ppl to finish it.. Although i personally feel tht this plc lacks dessert and thy shud add on sum  !!

I visited the restaurant on a Sunday night,  was astonished to see a queue and was told to wait for 45 minutes,  thankfully some people did not have patience enough and my turn came in faster. 

The goodies first 
The food was not very spicy and neither too oily. I personally liked lemon corriander soup,  jalzeera,  jodhpuri gatta and teej dal. 

The thaali is also a good option (great value for money proposition) 

The negatives 
The cutlery used was very old and a big turn off, also the quantity of food per dish could be increased (is what I personally feel)
My over all rating for this restaurant is 7 on 10

I can't believe I had not discovered this place until only a few years ago. This is a heaven for veggie like me. The ambiance is exquisite with and so is the food. 

There is soft Rajasthani folk music playing as  you enter the place and you will also be greeted by beautiful Rajasthani paintings adorning the walls. I go there mainly for their Thalis which are so deliciously fulfilling that you are completely satiated by the end of it. I like the North Indian Thali the most which has a royal spread containing paneer butter masala, alu dum, mixed vegetables, kaali daal, kulcha and rice along with a sweet dish. All of the items are very tasty and are served to you repeatedly until you are completely full. To be honest, you need to have a big stomach to take down everything that the Thali offers. Apart from the thali, there are innumerable other items on the Teej menu that you can try. Paneer Makkhan Malai and Bedwi Puri are the other items that I really loved. Their Biriyani too is very good. I am yet to try out other options on the menu and can't wait to visit the place again.

I keep visiting the place once every three months or so and will do so soon again. I have just one grouse: their Thali has the same items always. I had asked them to add some variety to it when I last visited and would request them to do so again. It would make visiting Teej that much more exciting. Nevertheless, Teej is one of my favourite restros and I hope they don't let their standards fall. Two thumbs up to Teej!

Authentic Rajasthani are probably the best words to describe this beautiful and mesmerisingly decorated restaurant. Be it the steps marked with golden at the edges leading up to the restaurant or the colorful Rajasthani decors inside. 

The servers, staff and everyone else was very well behaved and treated us with all the courtesy there is in the world. Perfect Rajasthani way I must say. 

A group of 6 and we still couldn't eat a lot. Maybe it was just the beer. 😉 

We started off with Bhuna Paneer, Mirchi k Pakode and beer. Their beer collection is pretty small though. We had Kingfisher strong and Heineken. This was then followed by ordering Rajasthani and North Indian thalis. When the Thalis were served we couldn't belive the number of itmes on it. 
The Rajasthani thali had about ten of them which included the very famous Dal Bati Churma and Gatte ki subzi. 
The North Indian thali had paneer butter masala, stuffed naan, dal makhni and mixed vegetables among others. 
Both the Thalis were really really tasty. Each and every item on it was just lip smacking. 
The Dal makhni was a little average otherwise it was all awesome. 

If I go there again I'm pretty sure I'd order the same Thalis but this time without getting full on beer. And I'd recommend the same for everyone. 

All in all a very satisfying experience. Or I could just say brilliant awesomeness!

To a bengali like me, it was a perfect and happy detour from the regular and common cuisines. The decor couldnt have been better and the servers are so happy to help. Dal bati churma was new for me, so one of them voluntarily helped me in eating it the right way. Another thing I liked was the turban worn by the servers. We had ordered the rajsi thali and the one thing i didnt expect here was the ''unlimited'' part of the dishes in the thali except buttermilk and dahi vada.

Whenever we say “eating out … and going for a vegetarian restaurant”, the faces around do not look that interested. Well … everyone have their own choice … and we like Veg and Non-Veg equally … of course depending upon our mood. So when we decided to go for a complete vegetarian lunch last month, my wife suggested Teej, the Rajasthani theme restaurant. We have had lunch here a few times before and just loved it. Apart from its grand decor, the first thing you will notice are the friendly waiters. When we visited for the first time they patiently described each dish in detail for us. That was some experience!!!

The best authentic Rajasthani food is served here. Do go there and only order the Rajasthani thaali. And you will fall in love with it. They serve kadhi , kair sangri, gatta and tandoori roti. Paneer khurchan is also good. Do order that. For drinks you can order the Chaas. It's very refreshing. In the end , gulab jamun will do the work for you. It's cheap , and has good quality food. And if you crave Rajasthani thaali, look no further.

Had a nice dinner at Teej. While my friend is used to Rajasthani khana, it was a whole new experience for me. We went with the Rajsi Thali which turned out to be a very good choice. We had the Chhach for drink, a delicious drink made of buttermilk, very digestive - here they added mint to it giving it a tangy flavour.

The place has a very warm atmosphere. The staff is friendly and helpful. Conveniently located on Russell Street, this place is highly recommended for vegetarians in the city.

What an amazing experience it was. Easily the top 5 vegetarian joint in Kolkata.

The plan to visit there was made in a tizzy, not much thought went into that. But boy do I wish I had been here before, absolutely I do.

It is located in Russell street just the lane opposite to Park hotel. The setup is authentic Rajasthani back drop ,with everything of the pre modern era somewhat similar to a Marwar household,all beautifully culminating into a wonderful experience.

Food:
Pudina Paneer tikka - what softness in the paneer tikka, what mouth watering taste, what beautiful presentation. Full points to this preparation. It just was the best of this stuff I have had before!!

Sweet Lassi - lassi was made to perfection with the right amount of all the ingredients, it did not taste like an odd mix of sugar curd and rose water but actually delicious lassi which I enjoyed to the fullest.

Daccai paneer - this Bangladeshi paneer preparation was the first I had had of it, but believe me when I say that I am a fan now. It was spicy with big chuncks of paneer, had a tantalizing sour and sweet taste to it and was cooked to perfection.

Veg ala Bake - I have had veg au gratin before in other places but I have to tell you to try this when you visit. Its one of the best gratins I have had, perfect crunchy outer crust and even more so inside,soft and super good.

Garlic naan & Masala kulcha- wonderfully cooked and soft yet hard to have with generous amount of butter in them ( believe me I have seen less butter in butter naan).

Great day, great food ,the only thing worth noticing and pointing out is the delivery/service wait time. It's a lot more than normal.

Please do visit with your family and see for yourself what I am so on and on about. 
like to see more thoughts around this place

Provided they don't let you down on a fine day ; )

            They preferred pulao, mix-veg., wonder of wonders Tutti-Frutti, um... Delicious.
            My next target will Veg. Kofte. I back out only for stairs climbing . @71yrs. It is hectic for me. Food & Qty. Is excellent not like those other Calcutta spciality Rstnt. Teej's Interior will take u to Raj. ambience. Overall My family's every member was very satisfied. I love it.

This restaurant scored full on all fronts. Beginning with the not so usual entrance and the attire of the waiters to the wonderful ambience done in traditional Rajasthani palatial style, this restaurant definitely deserves a try.
We ordered a Blue Sapphire drink, Laccha paratha,Garlic naan and Pudina naan with Paneer Nawabi. The drink was a refreshing one with the definite taste of coconut milk lingering in the throat and the tangy apple alongwith it. The paneer nawabi and the garlic naan tasted awesome. The soft yet crisp naans were definitely a feast. The Paneer Nawabi was astonishingly juicy and the gravy was perfect.Infact, would like to rate it among the best I had at Kolkata. The laccha paratha was the only one not so special going by their standards. However, barring that the gentle and courteous behavior of the staff needs to be appreciated as well. The is a perfect relaxing spot with the soft traditional music in the background away grom the hustle bustle of the busy street nearby.
P.S Was so famished, I almost forgot to click pics.However a few !!!

This is a place whose ambience is such that you won't feel that you are in Kolkata, you'll feel you're in Rajasthan indeed. Teej in Russell Street is a unit of Gangaur and serves very tasty Rajasthani Thali. The food is very homely, the rotis and the different types of veggies. The hospitality is also very warm.
Very good place to visit with family for Rajasthani food.!

Non-vegetarians need not come but if you do you will be treated to one of the finest meals that you have ever had.  You will be surrounded by beautiful Rajasthani decor and excellent service.  Make sure you have one of the thalis.

The food here is amazingly delicious which combined with Rajasthani style interiors and impeccable service makes up for a great place to eat. I would definitely love to visit this place again during my next visit to Kolkata. This place serves only vegetarian food so those who prefer eating non veg must eat elsewhere.

In my trip to Darjeeling after landing in kolkata we were looking for some good restaurant I came across this place. In spite of being reluctant about eating veg I was forcibly taken to this place. But the experience was amazing. Superb ambience. Quiet place. Very tasty Rajasthani food. Use of brass plates for food and tall brass vessels for water was unique. Will definitely visit on my next visit to Kolkata.

A very nice place, it scores full on ambience and interiors. The moment you step in you can feel the Rajasthani vibe. I went here to grab a quick lunch and tried the Rajasthani Thali. The thali had Ker Sangri, Dal, Kadhi, Gatte, Two types of breads, two sweets, one dahi vada and some other things I don't remember as I visited it in March'14 and am reviewing it now. The thali was great indeed, as it is difficult to find good north indian vegetarian food in the one of the worst cities on India - Kolkata. There is nothing except Park Street area to eat out at good places rest all is S*#T.

There is nothing great about this restaurant. It is like any other joint. No great taste in food. People who has written great reviews here wonder whether they ever experienced good vegetarian food. In India restaurants run on a certain formula i.e. one standard gravy prepared and kept aside and then mix with all whether one asks for Matar Paneer, Gobi Masala or Kadai chicken. Teej was also no different than this formula driven recipe.

While walking out, two people expecting tips was an additional displeasure.

Awesome place. Went there to grab a quick lunch. Though it is near to my office, I had never actually been there. The place looks small from outside, and it was a pleasant shock when I entered, as lo, it was a very beautifully decorated, sprawling place. The place is decorated like a palace, with intricate murals and royal stuff. So, back to food. We ordered paneer kadhaiwala, which would be enough for three people, a pudina naan and a butter naan. Absolute bliss! It tasted so good, yummm! Though a wee bit pricey, but it's just worth it. The service is prompt and hospitable, too. Everything is great, just go there already.

One of those restaurants without a huge sign board and yet a waiting line every single night. 

The decor exudes a very old-world-Rajasthani-luxe feel. The waiters are dressed in Indian attire as well. The music being played is Rajasthani folk. The feeling of being immersed in such an ambience is very delightful to say the least.

The complimentary amuse-bouche is a stack of well baked papads along with a pickle. I'd recommend trying their mango sweet chutney. They serve it only during the mango season as a part of the complimentary amuse-bouche.

It is a multi-cuisine restaurant, but we chose to give the Rajasthani cuisine a try. 


Dal ki pakori - 
    Amazing quantity. Good taste. Oil free. Served with green chutney. 

Rajasthani Thali - 
    Amazing quantity. Low-oil. Even with the low oil, the taste was very authentic and delicious. The Rajasthani thali comes with a huge variety that includes 2 types of breads, rice, Dal, 2 types of Veggies, 2 types of sweets, and a beverage. 

In my opinion, it is more than what a person can eat.
I'd also say that if you're opting for the thali, the starters can be very well skipped.


If you want to have authentic Rajasthani cuisine in Kolkata, this is one of the only places that serves it, and lucky for us, it does an exemplary job at that. 
It is also the highest rated Rajasthani cuisine serving restaurant on Zomato in Kolkata, and for good reason. 

A special mention for their hospitality and the fact they consciously deliver less oily food, keeping the authenticity and deliciousness intact.

This restaurant is situated in Russell Street and is sister concern of Gangaur. Went their with family for morning breakfast. Same menu was served what they serve down stairs in Gangaur. Breakfast was good and service was also fast but this place really needs a makeover of everything. Furnitures are old crockeries and cutleries need a polish as they are of German silver and copper ones. Place had started looking old. Owners should look into this aspect otherwise food is good. Pure vegetarian restaurant.

I am very fond of rajasthani and gujarati thaalis. It was a birthday occasion when my family gave a surprise dinner reservation here. It was quite a long time ago and recent i remembered this place. It was an unique rajasthani fare that i got. It matched the standards of the rajasthani food i had in rajasthan itself. If you are in mood for fresh but not boring veg food and a quiet, calm ambience, this place is worth a visit. The staff is friendly. For first timers, there is always someone to guide you through the intricate and elaborative rajasthani style of eating through the thaali platter!!

Its a part of the gangaur snacks restaurant. I had visited here on a puja day. As my friends love rajasthani food. Its a much smaller place than gangaur.however it has given it really ethnic interiors to give a rajasthani haveli feel. The cutlery used is like the silver utensils.As the rajasthani custom is to serve guests in silver utensils. So they have followed the customs:):) amazing feel. The doormen are also very courteous. They begin with ' padharo mhare desh' which means 'welcome to my place'. I love limited menu cards with variety, as it makes easier to decide on your order. So our order was simple, kaali dal- which was simply amazing very smooth texture, hyderabadi moti- mix vegetables of corn peas and capsicum with yellow gravy not too spicy different taste, rotis- missi roti tandoori roti. The missi one stood by the traditional rajasthani style with a spoonful of ghee and let me tell u.it was fantastic. Also the subz biriyani was good.
The staff is well versed with the menu. Food quality is very good. Service very good . A must visit to get the feel of rajasthan:):)

Went for a family gathering. Staff was courteous and served well. Food is decent but some of the items lack rajesthani taste which the restaurant specializes in. We tried several mocktails which were not good. Not sure if Kolkata has other options for rajesthani food but will not prefer to visit again. They can do much better with ambience.

A small place amidst parkstreet ( russel street actually ) . This tiny place is dedicated to rajasthani classical veggy items . Good food , comfortable ambience and a good service . Try their aloo nazakt , dahi kebab as a starter . For main course opt for afgani naan , masala kulcha  along with dahi kair sangri , kasturi vegetables , panner methi malai or jodhpuri sabji . U can also try their dal bati churma , rajasthani masala puri or veggy ala cart teez biriyani . They serve a few real good mocktail like sea breeze , blue sapphire , kesaria lassi . They also have a decent bar , but I do personally consider veggy items are not a good companion of liquor . Any way , if u are veg or want to have a rajasthani style dinner some day and want to booze definitely u can go for teez . Try any one from the above items , believe me they are really good . 
Costs around 800 for two widout liquor .

This place has been given a Rajasthani look.
The ambiance is great.

Coming straight to the point,

Lahsuni Kalmi Vada
Tasted great!

Paneer Nawabi
Delicious! Was recommended by the staff. 

Dal Panchratan
Five different pulses cooked together with the right balance of spices. 
Absolutely delicious!!
Highly recommended. 

Pudina Lachha Paratha
Was recommended by the staff, considering my mains.
Loved it, complemented well with the mains.

Bedwi Puri
A filling of lentils mixed with spices.
Great to taste. 

Other great dishes include Shahi Kofta, Alu Udaigiri, Dal Teej, Muglai Paneer and obviously Dal Bati Churma. 

Staff out here is courteous and well-informed, but a little laid back.

Prices are moderate.

Overall a great experience. :-)

Being a strict non vegetarian, this restaurant never really featured on my wishlist. But one fine day,  when i actually felt like trying out some veg delicacies for lunch, I chose Teej as it was conveniently located close to my office. It was a farewell treat from my boss and i loved every nibble of d food that was served here. We took paneer dhania seekh kabab for starters, which was very light, but at d same time, very flavourful. For d main course, we hd masala kulcha, veg biryani n paneer nawabi,which was an in-house speciality. 
For all non veg biryani lovers, d biryani ala teej is a must try- u might just want to change ur opinion abt veg food after having dat. However my personal favourite was d paneer nawabi..which was a delicately prepared paneer delicacy that will make ur taste buds wanting for more.  D meal was served with complementary papad n raita to go wth d biryani. For drinks we had taken kesariya lassi n chach, which was again v good. By dis tym we were so full dat we decided not just to skip desserts but to walk back to our office which was almost a km away. 
Overall d experience was excellent n i wud love to go back to teej to try out thr rajasthani thalis.

Conveniently located restaurant in park street , this is a pure veg restaurant serving alcohol as well.
Interiors are modernized rajasthani . They use the hammered stainless steel crockery which is something different and i like. 
Weekends and Sundays are packed and you can expect a queue.
Staff are ok , they do what they are supposed to do not very pushy not very quick , just ok
Coming to the food there are 3 items i love over here 
Teej ala bake , though this is a rajasthani north indian restaurant 
Samudri Khazana , only when you get over paneer and dal  
Paneer Tikka Masala
Breads are good and soft . Everything else just serves the purpose

Since my parents love eating at pure vegetarian outlets. This place comes to our first preference for family dinner...

Located in Russel Street , right beside gangaur. This place is easy to find.

They welcome u with a smiling namaste both at entrance of main gate & as u enter the restaurant.The staff is dressed in traditional Rajasthani clothes. The decor is simple.But getting seats are time taking on weekends.

 Wide variety on the menu to choose from.... For starters v ordered aloo nazakat ( house speciality) n i strongly recommend it.. N pudhina panner tikka is delicious...

Coming to main course ... V ordered daal teej which is good . Samudri khazana which  sounded interesting was actually a mix veg with american corn .. Taste good if u like american corn. Panner nawabi was good as always. In indian breads lachha paratha doesn't match my expectation.In baked v ordered veg au gratin was mouth watering.

After such a lovely main course. Desserts were a disappointment. The menu lacked options. 

Service was good. Staff here are very polite n helpful. 

Overall a nice place to eat.

Teej is a rajasthani themed restaurant located  near park street(russel street) .It is right beside ganguar and has been serving brilliant food as far as a marwari like me is concerned.Their menu includes versions of north indian starters ,rajasthani specialities and even a few contintental dishes.

Standouts for me are the blue sappire mocktail it is such a diiferent blend,jodhpuri mirchi ke pakode,dal baati churma,dahi kair sanghri,shahi kofta and so many the list is endless.Must try here is the special or rajsi thali, indeed you feel like a king feasting on portions of their choicest delicacies.The rajasthani masala puri, and pudina laccha paratha are just wonderful accompaniments to mains like paneer nawabi (mouth watering),udaigiri aloo.
To end your meal the rajasthani kulfi is a must .

The staff are welcoming and good,though sometimes delay the service a little,but overall the entire experience for me always has been wonderful enough to bring me back for more:)

We were out to have dosas but the place we intended to have it at was closed and hence we headed over to teej to try some rajathani food. My friends and I have heard a lot about this place and hence didn't think twice before heading there.

We ordered three thalis, two rajathani and one north indian on the waiter's insistence that ordering thali is a better option. Food looked bad and tasted awful. Definitely the worst food I have eaten in years. Left a bad taste and definitely spoiled our evening. Never ever am I going back there.

Sometime in 2007/2008 this place served great food. The Daal baati thali was great. I returned here again to savour the same, but I faced great disappointment and regret for having gone there. The restaurant hardly had people, and the food was sad. Its time that the "Times food award" given to them, be taken back, as it puts people into a wrong presumption, of the restaurant being a good place to go. Surprisingly, its quite pricey too!

The ambiance is good and so is the presentation. The thing which striked me is its name. Teej is a traditional hindu word having resemblance with God and with such a name if u serve cocktails thats quite uncool.

Rajasthani Thali which we prdered was awfully tasteless . Service was good though. 0.5 marks for taste and 2 for good service.



----- 02 Mar, 2014 -----

The standard of rajasthani thali was not upto the mark as baring one or two dishes the thali was almost tasteless. But the service was good.

We were out to have dosas but the place we intended to have it at was closed and hence we headed over to teej to try some rajathani food. My friends and I have heard a lot about this place and hence didn't think twice before heading there.

We ordered three thalis, two rajathani and one north indian on the waiter's insistence that ordering thali is a better option. Food looked bad and tasted awful. Definitely the worst food I have eaten in years. Left a bad taste and definitely spoiled our evening. Never ever am I going back there.

One of my vegan friends named this diner as he visited earlier with his family. So we decided revisit there. This place is not easy to find if you don’t know the area I noticed. You have to climb on the second floor to reach the premise. 

The restaurant is furnished luxuriously with heavy wood furnishings. They have a mini bar which is brightly lighted in the corner of the room. They have a good ambiance with a little Tadka of eye pleasing paintings, royal Menakari on walls. 

I had ordered Palak Aap ki Pasand with Pudina Laccha Paratha, I was not hungry though. My friend had ordered Rajsi Thali. My palak patties was wrapped around processed cheese and loaded with creamy gravy. That dish melted in my mouth with no time. And my Pudina paratha complimented it quiet well. The Rajsi Thali was loaded with famous Rajathani components. But they have a weird policy that if someone shares his or her Thali he or she will not get unlimited service. As I tasted the thali, the enticing flavors were coming from everywhere. The Thali had Dal Baati Churma, Gatte Ki Sabzi, Tandoori Roti, Kadhi, Papad, Saada Chawal, and many more.  I could not hold myself back from eating. 

On the terms of service the one who served us was not very friendly, and was not responding properly. But we managed to survive. If you are looking for good vegan food with a twist, you can try it out.

I miss my veggie friend with whom I used to visit Teej... :(
Ambience: Exotic! This is how a themed restaurant should be. On entering Teej you will temporarily forget you are in Kolkata. From the outer decor, to the narrow stairs, to the ornately carved and embellished door and the colourful, glass and mirror worked interiors to the traditionally dressed staff, this restaurant on Russel Street is themed to the t.
Service: Very efficient, prompt and friendly. They even explain the traditional Rajasthani dishes to the uninitiated, which is quite helpful for us inquisitive foodies.
Food: If you ask me, I'll suggest you take the Rajsi thali and the Maharaja thali which are unlimited thalis and will give a taste of Rajasthan. From there you can ask the staff about the different items and choose what best suits your palate and order it some more for free! And, ohh, it's all vegetarian.
Recommendation: The Rajsi and the Maharaja thalis.

Visited Teej for lunch during Puja i.e. 13.10.2013 with family.. Located in Russel Street, the place is very conveniently located.. 

First thing: Its my debut visit to this place.

Ambiance: They welcome you with a smiling NAMASTE at the entrance of the main gate as well as once you enter the restaurant... The staff is wearing Rajasthani clothes to give the feel for the same... 

Menu: Since it was Puja, they had limited Puja Menu rather than their original one... We ordered the following:

1.  Rajasthani Thail (Jain) - It was an unlimited Thali.. In case one shares, it becomes limited... They had Dal Baati Churma, Gatte Ki Sabzi, Tandoori Roti, Kadhi, Papad, Saada Chawal, Chhas, Beans, Chenna Pias... Since we could not share it, just tasted Gatte ki sabzi which was authentic Rajasthani

2. Maharaja Thali (Jain) - It was too an unlimited Thali.. In case one shares, it becomes limited... They had Tandoori Roti, Dal Makhani, Bhindi, Saada Chawal, Chhas, Papad, Chenna Pais, Salad, - Couldnt taste this one

3. Veg Biryani - The Biryani was good with the rice was cooked perfectly with right blended of spices... Was served with Vegetable raita which tasted nice being the curd was not sour.. Even the quantity was good for two person

4. Dal Makhani (Jain) - It was great in taste and also went well with our Biryani.. The best part was that it didn't had too much kidney beans in the dal unlike other restaurants... 

5. Masala Chhas - Since all Gujarati people food is incomplete without Chhass... It was good but i personally found little more masala in the Chhas

Service: It was quick and with a smiling on their face.

Cons: Since it was an unlimited Thali, we were expecting that people would be serving themselves rather than asking for items (since we get the same service at the same cost in other Thali restaurants)

Overall, it was above satisfaction debut..

If you are a vegetarian,  this is really a nice foodie destination for you. Their food quality is very good and cooking is very authentic. The rajasthani delicacies of this place are very mouth watering. The famous daal bati churma is really good. ambience of this place is something which I should not forget to mention. You will be pleased to eat here. You will also enjoy the service pretty good. so overall it is a good place to hang out for veg eating and classy dining.

Teej is a pretty old and known restaurant from the owners of Gangaur. It is one of the few pure vegetarians restaurants. They do serve liquor. The place serves north indian and rajasthani cuisines. The decor is simple with a rajasthani feel to it. Sitting capacity is quite good but still getting seats are time taking on weekends.

The utensils are all silver polished with banana leaves on your dinner plates which i like. The dal pakoras, DAL BATI CHURMA  are great. I love their kebabs especially the dhania paneer kebab which is heavenly. The dal is amazing and other main course dishes are great too. I love the pineapple raita they make. Deserts are very limited but i like the kulfi they serve.

Pros:
1) Rajasthani ambience is refreshing 
2) Dal pakora is a must have
3) Food is very good
4) Service is quick, warm

Cons:
1) It serves only vegetarian food
2) Deserts are very limited 
3) Long waiting queues on weekends 

Please follow me to read my other reviews.

I visited this place a year ago with mah cousins on the occasion of Rakshabandhan! When I entered i was warm welcomed by the waiters wearing Rajasthani Dresses. Ambiance was upto the mark. Then We Ordered Corn Soup n Daal Pakora which were very much delicious. Coming to the Main Course we ordered Maharaja Thali for everyone of us. there were so many items in the Thali. We were served very much delicately n nicely.  I think it is the best Veg Restaurant Of Kolkata.

Before a month ago, I wanted to throw my birthday treat over there with 14 friends. So I called their number for some discount on 14 Maharaja Thalis, But to say sorry, they clearly denied.

Then I visited Rajdhani Restaurant located in Mani Square mall who offered us 25% discount on Thalis and 1 thali free for the birthday boy! And my prestige with my friends got high too. So I Will Suggest you to think over my comments and offer some discounts on the Birthday Parties. 

Your Wellwisher!

Teej is located in Russel Street and offers food of Rajasthani cuisine. The ambience is traditional and gives you the feel of Rajasthan.

The staff wears traditional rajasthani dresses and are quite helpful as they explains you the dishes. The quality of food is good. We ordered pakora for starters and had Dal Bati Churma, Missi Roti, Sangri Ker in the maincourse. The quantity was fair and the price was on the higher spectrum.

Teej lacks in desserts but is a place recommended for vegetarians and lovers of traditional Rajasthani food.

I usually stick to non-veg establishments,truth be told. However, some time back our director in the office threw a party here, and I was one of the guests. The restaurant was easy to locate. The place was jam packed, but thankfully, we had reservations. The decor was superb, and so was the ambience. The waiters were bedecked in a traditional style,and seemed quietly competent . The food was good,and pretty much authentic. A good place for traditional north indian vegetarian fare. However, sometimes asking for a refill can be a problem because of the long time it takes. The prices seemed to be on the higher end of the spectrum, but then again, this IS park street,and besides, they do go a long way in trying to create the elegant ambience. A must visit for vegetarians. And for all the carnivores out there, an occasional visit won't harm you either .

Teej has been around for quite a while and was one of those restaurants I passed often but did not step into because I am a hardcore non-vegetarian. Recently I was invited their for a friends birthday so I got a chance to sample the food at Teej. I was quite impressed with what I sampled .... Personal favourites the Dal Teej , the Bedwi Puri , Paneer Sartaj were really good. For starters the Kalmi Vada and Dal ki Pakori were yummy. Also one of my fellow diners had the rajasthani thali and said it was excellent. Our meal ended on a seet note with kulfi and gulab jamun both of which were spot on.

If you love pure vegetarian food then Teej is a good option which you might wish to consider. I, personally have pure meaty meal hence I was not amazed but the food did impress me to some extend the interiors are quite intricate and has a feel and touch of Rajasthan. 
The staff are quite well mannered and cordial. The pricing too is very reasonable and you can easily afford it.
Try their kaali dal it's awesome and so is there 'sarso ka saag'. 
Overall I rate it 3.5 cause I missed my meat but the food quality and quantity is quite good I must admit. You can easily rate it 4 if you are a pure vegetarian.

Teej serves fairly good Rajasthani food. Apart from traditional Rajasthani dishes, it also serves some Oriental and North Indian dishes, but those are best avoided.

The place is very well decorated. The staff wear traditional dress and are very polite. They also explain the dishes to customers, and in some cases, advise them on the best way to enjoy the dish. The furniture is very good. Metal goblets and cutlery accentuate the charm of the place. I did feel that some of the items were a little overpriced, though.

We ordered the Dal Bati Churma and the Dahi Kair Saangri, along with a couple of Missi Rotis. The Dal Bati Churma was quite good. However, the restaurant should serve larger batis or more batis per dish - we had to content ourselves with two small-sized batis. The Dahi Kair Saangri was spicier and went very well with the Missi Roti. I also liked the sweet mango chutney served as a condiment after the order was placed.

Overall, a nice place to eat, and one I would like to visit again.

Conveniently located at Russel Street, this eatery above Gangaur and Domino's is a splendidly put up Rajasthani resto..The ambiance is exquisite and you are made to feel like an esteemed guest. Once inside, you are greeted by the staff and as you go through its menu, you see a variety of items put up together.
I am a fan of their Maharaja Thalia which is Rajasthani and their Rajsi Thali which is the north Indian variety. The Dal Baati is super good as well. Gulab Jamun is deliciously sinful.
Go to Teej to savour the flavours of north and west within a good ambiance.
4 stars from me for Teej.

located at park street and serves pure rajasthani food. I am not a  vegetarian food lover but i really liked this place.. Went there recently with friends and first time,,,i tasted veggie food. Ambience is rajasthani type with great wood crafting and nice sitting arrangement. Time for food,,,food quality is delightful and food quantity is good. Half of the time i think,,that it remains uncrowded and the exterior structure and design of this restaurant is very nicely done. Prices are affordable and i had tasted Biriyani-Ala-Teej,Raita Manpasand,Laccha and some preparation of sabjis which was enough.. Staffs are well-mannered and they wear a rajashtani type uniform....A massive suggestion goes to veggie food lover to taste their food,,,you may like it. I would rate 4.0 for them..

If you want to taste the best Rajasthani food then this is the place to visit.The thali has so many different items and all are delicious.I loved the Dal-Bati-Churma and the complementary Papad that was so huge that it almost resemlbed a roti. Many types of roti were available.The North Indian thali was also good,specially the paranthas.A complimentary beer along with the thali makes the perfect combo.

It is a bit overpriced but the vintage rajasthani decor and the folk music playing in the background perfectly sets the mood and more than makes up for it.

A must visit for all the foodies out there :)
