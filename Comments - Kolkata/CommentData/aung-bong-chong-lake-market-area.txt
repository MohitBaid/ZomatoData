New place.. Good food.. Tasty items.. Reasonble.. Behind lake mall.. Beside tandoor house.. The best part is they also serve combo meals (chinese n Indian) ..but there is a time limit.. If u want to hve those combos then u have to be there within 3:00 p.m.

A small restaurant located on the street behind the Lake Mall On lake road. The inside is decorated with small hanging lamps with Chinese shades and wall papers of old bricks. 
The menu is divided into two parts, Bengali(Bong) and Chinese(Chong). Our selection of dish was Thsi Soup, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Apple Chingrir Bora and Gondhoraj Chicken. Though the taste of the food is little bit on the bland side, I personally liked it as less salt and better oil is used compared to other restaurants' who serve food at this price. 
The waiter is polite and always has a smile on his face. They have potential to flourish. My next choice will be the Bengali menu if I visit.

The restaurant is placed just behind the Lake Mall, making it very much easily accessible.
The staff here is good and they were much decent.The interiors are neatly decorated and maintain.
Coming to the food, it may not be an exceptional or one of a kind place, but is quite good compared to most other small Chinese joints in the city(I have not tried the Bengali dishes here)

To sum it up, it is worth a bang for the bucks :)

I've been here several times with my family and friends.. it's just behind lake mall which is very easy to locate.. Aung Bong Chong is pocket friendly as well nd a mindblowing place to chill out with pals.. Now coming to the quantity of the food, I would say it's sufficient for 2 people.. the owners and waiters are extremely polite and sweet which makes the places even better. I've tried both bengali and Chinese cuisines . Both were lip smacking.. Nevertheless, I prefer Chinese cuisine more . The honey glazed chicken wings is one of my favourite dish here.. I even loved the Bhetki paturi and the gondhoraj paneer .. would love to visit here again and I suggest everyone to go and taste the mouth watering food here.

Hello Food Lovers,

Last night visited Yang bong chong, I don't know why I'm ordered there bengali thali, if I ordered chinese there that should be better,

Anyway, 
If  you have low budget I recommend this resturant perfect for you..
Tried 1 veg and CHICKEN thali,

Food taste not so good enough, but not too bad also, but I am not satisfied there , why we try resturant?  Because we always find new taste but their taste just normal like home food feelings, no special taste found there ... 
Will again visit there for Chinese hope will find better taste than thalis ..

Thanks .
