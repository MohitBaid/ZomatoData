I love how the Moong vadas swell up, one it is put in the oil to fry. Their process of making it is fascinating. The vadas are no doubt amazing, but the chutneys served her also yum. There are two types garlic chutney and Pudina chutney, it's spicy and a burst of flavours. Served hot and always a crowded place. The also have Facebook page named "Victoria Vada"
The president of Britain visited their shop too. The place is right in front of Vardaan Market.
