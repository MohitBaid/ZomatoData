Environment was good... And food also... But the food was expensive specially for the students like me... And the washroom is very small also...

I ordered the food on Swiggy, and boy must i say i was in for a surprise.
A) they readily and willingly customised my order to my taste.
B) the way they packed and sent the food was great. Every condiment in a separate box.
C) the food was spectacular. The paneer shashlik satay, and the pan fried tallaa-something was fantastic. Fresh flavors, crunchy noodles, and the dips, to drool.

You just have to have to eat here.

Nice decor post remodelling. Staff is really friendly. Coming to the food, one of the best in the city. We keep on visiting this place again and again. Service is a little slow, but the wait is definitely worth it.

Went looking for an old haunt, Kurry Klub and was quite appalled to see a new restaurant, Rozario's, in its stead. Had almost started walking back when I saw the old name in rather small print. Tthat gave me the courage to venture inside.
The decor had changed, with the lighting much brighter. Frankly, not to my taste. But thankfully, that was the only change I noticed. The food and the service were as good as ever. Most importantly, the Fusion Kebab Platter managed to match my memory-coloured expectations. And the pinch to the pocket remains as reasonable as ever.
One sour note though. A fellow patron, seated next to us continuously talked loudly over his cell, making some darned workplace thing or the other. Can't people extend a minimum common courtesy to each other? No aspersions on the restaurant, of course.

Really bad food and service is also bad.
Munna Kumar is the restaurant manager who was sitting quietly while the issues kept arising.

Food took longer than the waiter informed at the time of Order. 
The fresh lime soda has dirt inside it and their sugar syrup is dirty
The chicken quality is rubbery and I suggest to avoid the chicken dishes as the quality is bad. 

This is a live review.

Rozario's is the new name for the old Kurry Klub in Deshapriya park.They have renovated their decor to bright yellow walls which gave a happy feel as we walked in.Simple decor with delicious food is what Rozario's follow.The staff is absolutely delightful always on their toes for suggestions and service.We went for their ever famous cheese fondue as the starter. Served with bread and chicken orly the hot fondue bowl sat pretty in front of me.The orly was a bit dry but by the end I was running my fingers around the fondue bowl licking every drop of cheese.Salty with a hint of garlic ,smooth and creamy this fondue is simply love.Next we opted for the pescado el cilantro-oven baked fish topped with spicy tomato sauce served with cilantro rice.The cilantro rice was fluffy ,light -cilantro being the star of the dish.The fish was baked to perfection with a tangy tomato gravy on top.The gravy might seems a little too tangy but have a spoonful with the rice and all the flavours create a fusion in your palate.Wholesome food filled with simplicity that touches your soul.Team Rozario's have done a great job

A very late written review. 
I visited this place months back with my family to celebrate my sisters birthday. 
It had newly opened with a new name though this restaurant was situated and had been running in the same place for 23 years. 

I had been here before so I knew how the old place looked and the redecorating is excellent.  Loved it! 
The food tastes the same still and has had some additions to it! 
We tried the satays for a change . Extra effort was taken to present them as it was my sisters birthday. The staff even got us a cake which was a nice gesture.  

The food is reasonable and the ambience is good. 
I personally loved the music as it is both a mix of old and new.  I even had a good chat with the lady out there and she was kind enough to get extra gravy for my grand  mother. 

All in all it was a great experience.  
The food is different and the presentation is pretty cool!. We even had our names put on the sticky post wall as I call it!!  . 
I'm surely visiting this place again with my family.  

Oh yes and a special mention to their dessert tacos. Such a treat!!  I haven't had dessert tacos anywhere else in kolkata and it's pretty awesome.

Don't go otherwise you will suffer a lot!

If you are looking for some innovative fusion food, Rozario's is the place to come to.. Located close to Desapriya park, it is a small cozy place serving some awesome food.
For starters, we had the Fusion Kebabs.. It consisted of Murgh tikka, Murgh reshmi tikka, Creole potato, Chicken yakitori, Fish tikka accompanied by nasigoreng rice. 
For main course, there was
Mackerel sauteed in sweet chilli sauce
Mini Naan 
Dal makhni
Tandoori pork makhni 
Vegetable and dry fruit pulao 
Mexican grilled chicken with Mexican rice.
Everything was excellent, especially the pork.. It is a must try!
For Pujo, they will be serving Tandoori Hilsa and Tandoori Pomfret.. Can't wait to try those too!!

Kurry Klub had a very special place in my heart for its delicious cheese fondue. It was very  upsetting to a large number over people who had some amazing moments there. But we were happily surprised to know that the reins of the restaurant was handed over to the grand daughter.She did a commendable work at revamping the place. Giving everything a modernised approach.We were invited for a special luncheon at Rozario’s.

To begin with I wonder how so many people have given this place a 4star and 5star review. Last evening (chaturthi day of Puja) we had gone with so much expectation to this newly renovated restaurant (as we had quite good memories with the erstwhile kurry klub), and the final outcome was totally opposite....DISAPPOINTING to be precise.

Firstly, when I asked the lady over the phone about the availability of veg food items, she informed me that everything except nachos and tacos is available in the special Durga puja menu. But while ordering, the selection was quite limited, with baby corn, cheese foundue, chilli paneer and paneer tikka being the only veg starters. The all time favorite 'patata con salsa' was not available in the limited menu. The lady was quite rude and dint respond much. 

The staff was not much helpful either. 

We ordered crispy chilli baby corn, spaghetti in white sauce, Mexican rice with potato, paneer makhani and garlic nan. The baby corn was not up to the mark at all. In the name of the dip, there was only chilli sauce. Spaghetti was good and the Mexican rice was a saving grace. The paneer makhani had a whole lot of butter floating on top, so much that I had to ask for a bowl to remove it. The vinegar onions were stale.

To top it all the prices were quite high.

All in all nothing much to expect and I never intend to go back there.

Durga pujo is already here and Rozario's is all set to give you a warm welcome with there mind blowing puja special menu . The interior is not like any regular one but a bit different and really a mood lifting . Many beautiful photos hunging on the wall every where , paper cuttings , the ambience is good as well , and staffs r very friendly i will say . Overall i will say its an awesome place to try something different this puja appart from those regular chinese or indian food . They really got some awesome fusion of Mexican , Indian and Italian cuisine which tastes heavenly . As we bongs are born foodies , so I will just say opposite to Desapriyo Park stoppage take the Sarat Bose Road and a 2-3 mins of walking will lead you to this stop .

It was a pre puja foodies meet and a thanks to Tanmay Basak for inviting me and Christia Rozario for hosting us . I just love their food and looking forward to visit it again this puja . We tried some of their puja special dishes :

# Fusion kebab :

* Murgh tikka- The Kebabs were very tasty , tender and juicy .

* Murgh reshmi tikka- It was very well prepared and perfect mix of spices .

* Creole potato- This was good as well , and very well cooked .

* Chicken yakitori- This one I tried for the first time and it was quiet impressive .

* Fish tikka- The fish was very fresh , soft , moist and very delicious .

# Nasigoreng rice-This one was pretty good .

# Mackerel sauteed in sweet chilli sauce: Me being a spice lover I just loved this preparation , and will recommand this to everyone . I wound say this one was one of the best ..

# Mini Naan- The Naan tasted really nice and crispy.

# Dal makhni- It was good less spicy and buttery , good for people who r in diet ..

# Tandoori pork makhni- It was for the first time that I tried something with pork in Indian style . I would say its was the best of the lot , as it tasted heavenly . There was almost no fat present , and the greavy was just finger licking , resembles to mutton boti masala . Its like heaven for pork lovers .

And if you don't feel comfortable with Pork, not to worry , there is a good news , Rozario's is serving Tandoor Pomfret and Tandoor Hilsa as part of their Puja Special menu.

# Vegetable and dry fruit pulao- Even though, I don't really like dry fruits in my rice, this one tasted really nice and the flavour of Zafran was quite great.

# Mexican grilled chicken with Mexican rice- This dish was served in a really unique utensil mainly used in Middle East . The grilled Chicken was just mouthwatering . And the Mexican rice was also good .

Pujo is finally here and Rozario's is all geared up to blow your mind away with their own special Puja menu. As foodies, we like to have options. So, it's very much gratifying to see the elaborate menu that they have come up with having all the continental cuisines as well as our very own Indian cuisine and each one of them tasting just as divine. 
Coming to décor, the walls were painted a lively yellow colour with pretty frames hung all over the place. And there was a wall which had sticky notes all over it where all the guests have left behind some kind words about the restaurant. That added the personal touch to it. All in all, it creates a great ambience where you can bring your friends to chill with as well as have a date with your significant other.  Here are some of the dishes we tasted as part of our Blogger's meet. 
 
√Fusion kebab :
*Murgh tikka- This one was really tasty. The kabab was soft and juicy.  
*Murgh reshmi tikka- I found it really delicious. The flavour of the spices used were really prominent. 
*Creole potato- Being an aloo lover, I loved this one. 
*Chicken yakitori- This one impressed me a lot. Out of all the kababs, I liked this one the most.
*Fish tikka- The kabab was soft and moist and utterly delicious. 
*Accompanied by nasigoreng rice-This one was pretty great too. 

√Mackerel sauteed in sweet chilli sauce: Me being a non-spicy person, the lingering taste of the chilli was felt really overpowering to me. Nonetheless, the taste was damn good. This one was one of favourites. 

√Mini Naan- The Naan had gotten cold because we took a lot of time clicking the pictures, but even then, they tasted really nice and crispy. 

√Dal makhni- All those health conscious people who stay away from this dish because of its fat content, here's a good news for you. Rozario's makes this dish in a very healthy way without overdoing it with more cream and butter. So, it's perfect for you people.

√Tandoori pork makhni: This one was the best of the lot. I really really loved this dish. This is the first time, I tried Pork in an indian preparation. I was literally licking the gravy off my fingers. The gravy was amazing and the pork had almost no fat in it. In short, heaven for the pork lovers. 
And if you don't feel comfortable with Pork, fret not. Rozario's is also serving Tandoor Pomfret and Tandoor Hilsa as part of their Puja Special menu. 

√Vegetable and dry fruit pulao: Even though, I don't really like dry fruits in my rice, this one tasted really nice. The flavour of Zafran was quite great.

√Mexican grilled chicken with Mexican rice: This dish was served in a really unique utensil. The grilled Chicken was just fantastic. And the Mexican rice just added to the delightful experience. This one's highly recommended.

Pujo is around the corner and so this beautiful little place has a new Pujo special Fusion menu to offer.
The items included are:
1. Fusion kebab platter which consists of:
Murgh Tikka
Murgh Reshmi Tikka
Creole Potato
Chicken Yakitori
Fish tikka
Accompanied by Nasigoreng rice
The presentation is superb and so is the taste of the kebabs. The Indonesian rice is a fusion delight.
2. Mackerel sautèed in Sweet Chilli sauce: I loved this sea fish and the sauce was O so delicious.
3. Mini Naan: Light and crispy
4. Dal makhani: This could be better. With some more tadka.
5. Tandoori Pork makhni: This is the first time Pork was served in such a gravy preparation and it was delicious.
For those who want to avoid Pork; the Pujo menu has Tandoori Pomfret or Tandoori Hilsa for them.
6. Vegetable and dry fruit pulao: The strong Zafraani flavour was palatable.
7. Mexican Grilled Chicken with Mexican Rice; the fusion element and Mexican delights served in a middle Eastern utensil.
I personally recommend this place for a Fusion "pet pujo" this Puja.
The ambience is quite quaint and tidy. Actually the framed photos on the walls are a mood lifter for food lovers.
I am delighted to dine with you people, heart warming foodies;

Visited this place few days back...Ambiance is good..
Names on the menu are not easy to figure out...but the waiter helped us out nicely...:)

So we ordered Tallarines De Huevo...Schezwan Tallarines... Buffalo Wings and Thai Curry Chicken Satay...

Buffalo Wings-- It was delicious...Just too good...After tasting it...we just wanted more of it...Wished it had more chicken to it..maybe lollipop like pieces...Quantity was just too less for the price but taste was bang onn!!

Schezwan Tallarines-- This is actually schezwan noodles...This was also very nice...not over-spicy
..nd quantity this time was okayish..

Tallarines De Huevo-- This is Stir Fried Egg Noodles...nd this was superb...This place makes very good noodles man...Try it out noodle lovers...!!!

Thai Curry Chicken Satay-- Oh yesss...this was also very very tasty...but again very less quantity for the price...we wished for more again...😆😆

Now we got 2 free mocktails..as there is an offer that u get 2 free mocktails id bill reaches above 1000...one mocktail free for bill above Rs500 is also another offer...Look out for these 2 offers written outside the restaurant..as the people there did not seem to be tell us about these offers...but when we asked that we noticed this outside...they immediately gave us our mocktails...

Mocktails tasted fine...one layer of one mocktail(the pink layer of the pink yellow one) tastef bad though the other layer was tasty...nd the other mocktail was goooddd...

So to sum it up...a very satisfying experience...pocket pinch though is on the higher side...

Now we got 2 free mocktails..as there is an offer that u get 2 free mocktails id bill reaches above 1000...one mocktail free for bill above Rs500 is also another offer...Look out for these 2 offers written outside the restaurant..as the people there did not seem to be tell us about these offers...but when we asked that we noticed this outside...they immediately gave us our mocktails...

Mocktails tasted fine...one layer of one mocktail(the pink layer of the pink yellow one) tastef bad though the other layer was tasty...nd the other mocktail was goooddd...

So to sum it up...a very satisfying experience...pocket pinch though is on the higher side...

I have taken long time to Pen down this blog. Really Long !! Started it long time back. But due to some technical problem I lost my Hard Disk data. I was also bit lazy to complete this up. This store belongs to my Dear Friend Christia, Daughter of renowned Chef Pradip Rozario. Sorry Christia for late upload.

Rozario once known as Kurry Club was reopened at 126 Sarat Bose Road. This was my first official visit as a food critic with my group. We were invited by the owner Ms Christia Rozario whom we simply wanna thank from the bottom of our heart. Although the weather looked a bit dull. But it simply wouldn't stop foodies like us from visiting and searching for food. 
The restaurant is situated in a beautiful place and is not at all difficult to find. The interior is also beautifully decorated. The furniture's are very beautiful and also well arranged. Also the ambiance is very good for any food lover and also the music at the background adds to the tally. It is definitely a place to visit with family, loved ones, friends. 
We were actually invited for a 3-course meal. The items served are as follows: 
•Paneer wrapped in noddle satay: Along with this we were provided with salad and pickle. The pander is served with noodle and also with a makhni gravy. It is a unique food of its kind. It was very soft and crispy and had an own appeal
•Balinese Chicken Satay : It was served with salad and basil rice. Any non-vegetarian would simply order it at the beginning. It's taste was simply the best and one would surely remember it to a great extent. 
•Veg seek kebab: It was provided with sweet chilli mayo. It gives a beautiful taste and also it has a wonderful appeal of its own. 
Note: All the foods served are very healthy and free from hazardous oil as well. So it simply fulfill the motto:"Eat healthy stay healthy"
Main Course: 
•Pescado Cilantro with basil rice: 
It is generally Mexican tangy fish and prawn which is generally served with basil rice. It will surely fulfill your hunger at one stroke. Also it is much healthy and delicious. It has a wonderful taste and one would easily fall in love with it after having a bite.
• Salsa salccicia: Well it is actually Spaghetti which is served with pork sausage. It also had a wonderful taste and the pork is simply wonderful enough. One will surely love having such a dish and is very much ideal in the diet of every foodie. So it is definitely something worth eating. 
Dessert: I always have a special soft corner for any type of dessert. And it even got softer once I saw this. Taco served with scoop of vanilla ice cream and topped with sprinkles. It was so delicious that one would simply want more and more of the dish. After a delicious meal one always expects a wonderful dessert because of the phenomenon of 
"A Happy Ending". And this dish is considered absolutely as a very happy ending after a wonderful meal. 
So on integrating all the above factors we can easily say that this place is simply one of the best restaurant in Kolkata and one can come here not only with family also with friends and beloved ones. The hospitality was absolutely wonderful and the cleanliness, the atmosphere, the interior would definitely make you visit this place again in the future. 
And thank you Ms Cristia Rozario for inviting us and serving us such beautiful dishes  and keep up the good work. 
A special thank to team for giving me an opportunity to work beside you and thank you

We miss the old kurry Klub.
The food was not upto the mark.

We ordered for veg platter and it was pathetic.

I hope they start serving Indian food again like before .

Finally i am all set to pen down this review that i've been procrastinating for ever; all thanks to the evil effects of drastic weather change!
Well, the formerly well-known KURRY KLUB has been revamped and renamed as Rozario (which happens to be the surname of the owner's family) and it is fully operational since a month now. And that's a very good news for us foodies, especially when the Durga puja is so near and we all need a good place to dine in after the tiresome pandal hopping!
● LOCATION : cross the Deshapriya Park petrol pump and walk a minute towards Lake. Just opposite to the famous Maharaja tea & snacks joint.
● FOOD: It has restructured its menu and given it a whole new dimension. Some of the newly introduced dishes that i tried are as follows:
1. STARTERS comprising of the Satays:-
a) Veg seekh kebab with sweet chili mayo dip: an extremely healthy vegetarian option for kebab as it's made oil-free (informed by our humble host)
b) Balinese Chicken Satay: made of minced chicken infused with lemon grass, served with salad & basil rice. Highly recommended!
c) Paneer wrapped in noodle Satay: Paneer satay wrapped in noodles, served with makhni gravy and salad. Another treat for the vegetarians.
2. MAIN COURSE:-
a) Pescado en Cilantro with Basil Rice : Tangy Mexican fish and prawn preparation served with Basil rice. It was not overly tangy. It had just the correct amount of tang and spice. Must try!
b) Salsa Salsiccia:
Spaghetti cooked in the Aglio Olio style which involves pasta lightly sauteed with minced garlic and olive oil. This one was served with the house-made Pork Sausages. Highly recommended!
3. DESSERT:-
Dessert Tacos: vanilla ice-cream served in Taco shells along with sprinkles. A bundle of joy to wrap up the gastronomical roller-coaster! Must try!

So, to wrap up the review:
Food : 4/5
Service: 4/5
Ambience: 4.5/5
Cleanliness: 4.5/5
Value for money: 4/5
Lastly, an hearty thanks to the owners for hosting us so generously. And thank you

Delicious Food. Good and simple decor. Tried the Italian Romeo Penne which was named after the owners son.  A unique twist to the dish with both marinara and bechamel.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  Also tried the Mongolian fondue soup which is actually made in the table itself. Not very rich.  Very delicate ingredients. A bit of Thai flavors in it which was nice.  For desserts, had tried the crepe fantasia. A very ordinary crepe was given a tempting plate up.  The ice cream and sugar cup crumble added to it.  
All in all,  a good experience. Very pocket friendly and homely environment.  
Thanks guys!

Kurry Club, a very famous restaurant situated in Sarat Bose Road, now re-opened as Rozario, serving Mexican and Italian. One fine day we (our group of seven) were called for 3 course lunch invitation. The owner, Ms Christia Rozario's warm hospitality, made our visit to this place, worth it. 
 
Interiors of this place is decently done, framed pictures can be seen almost in every wall with wooden furnitures all around. Ambience also scores a  good rating, with the music playing in the background, you can enjoy your meal heartily.

Now the main part of the review, the food. Since, it was a 3 course meal, we had 3 types of starters, 2 main courses and 1 dessert.

Starters: 
Veg Seekh Kebab - served with sweet chilli mayo. This kebab is no oil speciality, hence healthy in one world. The sweet chilli mayo goes well with the kebabs, giving your taste palate, a very unusual taste.

Paneer wrapped in noodle satay - served with salad and pickle. A very interesting dish, here the paneer is wrapped with noodle, tossed in makhni gravy. The paneer is soft inside with the noodle part a bit crusty however soft since tossed in gravy. The salad, dressed in vinegar accompanies the dish well. 

Balinese Chicken Satay - served with salad and basil rice. The star attractor of the starters. The satay, infused with minced lemon grass. Best among the rest.

Maincourse:
Pescado Cilantro with Basil Rice - Tangy fish and prawn mexican dish, served with basil rice. The quantity served is enough to satiate your hunger. The tanginess in the dish will tingle the taste buds. 

Salsa Salccicia - Spaghetti served with house going pork sausage. Yes, you read that right, their pork sausages are home made and tastes extremely delicious. The spaghetti was light and cooked till perfection. 

Dessert:
Dessert Tacos - My personal favourite amongst all. A fusion dessert; tacos served with scoop of vanilla ice cream and topped with sprinkles. A mixture of sweet and salty taste altogether. A must try for sweet cravers.

Service, ambience, cleanliness deserve a good score. Overall a pleasant experience. Kurry Club made its own good name and reputation, we have the same expectation from Rozario's too. 

All the very best Team Rozario's !

Thank you

I went to this venue with my foodie friends and really had an awesome time. Thanks to Christia sis, who hosted us beautifully. I really didn't feel that Rozario is 1 month old, because they did everything so perfectly, it mesmerises me even now, when I'm boarding my flight for Dehradun.
We had a wholesome brunch that day and I still remember that, I didn't have anything for the dinner...hahaha....
We had Balinese chicken satay as our starter. Basically, it is minced lemon grass infused Satay with salad and basil rice. I must say, it was so delicious that it literally increased my hunger and expectations.
We went on to have Paneer wrapped in noodle satay which is basically, Paneer wrapped in noodle, tossed in makhni gravy with salad and pickle. I must say that, this concept is highly innovative. Who the hell can imagine that dal makhni gravy can compliment paneer so well. Really great! We also had Veg seekh kebab (with sweet chilli mayo) and Garlic bread toast to kill our hunger.
The ambiance was so classy that we spent some time capturing each other's pictures as well. I felt like, "This is the last day I'm going to live." I've never felt so good before.
Okay! We ordered our main course and believe me! Oh boy! This was the climax! Haha! What a damn good presentation! I was stunned! It consisted Pescado cilantro with basil rice which is a sexy preparation of Mexican tangy fish and prawn served with basil rice. It also had, Salsa salccicia which is a preparation of spaghetti with house going pork sausage. I found some shops here in my city which don't wash pork before cooking. But this was really hygienic, I must say. The amount of oil they use while cooking is really less. Hence, less chances of stomach-upset.
A sweet ending is particularly needed, when you have a dessert. Hence, we chose to have Dessert tacos. I think, so far, this dish was THE BEST. Kono kotha hobe na! It was crispy, sweet and had a vanilla scoop with some toppings. Ahh! Marvelous!
Christia my sister! Keep up your good work.
Thanks for the invitation

I thoroughly enjoyed the food there. The ambience is fresh and has that authentic cafe feel. If u are a person who really enjoys good food and loves a cool simple ambience, this place is for you. It is also so easy to find, right on Sarat Bose Road, can't wait to go back and try some more of their dishes.

A fresh burst of colour and some solace as u get inside Rosario's.  The only place in Calcutta serving you quality satays at a good price. The Thai curry and Balinese chicken satay is a must try... Lovely n calm ambience and locationally too good!

I grew up eating at this place i even went inside the kitchen once . The chef was so kind to let me. When i saw the change i was taken a back but in a good way no matter what you do i will always love KURRY KLUB. this place is like my second home. A place i loved going to on every weekend. Eating the cheese fondue and the fusion kebab was a weekly thing. No wonder i gained so much weight. ..hehehehe. but im glad to see the new change. The satays are adventorous. They do have a twist to them. The good mkxture of thai flavors with indian spices really made me happy. I went with my grand mother and she cannot eat garlic. The chef actually took the effort to make her the same without any garlic from scratch. A small effort but not unnoticed. I will always visit you guys more and more. More power to you. And keep bringing new tasty dishes to the city. Thanks guys!

My family being a big k.k. Fusion fan, made us try tgis place. Firstly the ambience was a big disappointment! And menu seemed so incomplete. Hardly any choices for vegetarians too! The staff doesnt even know how to smile. 
Except the spinach cheese fondue everything was a disaster. Really regretted going there.

Erstwhile, kurry Klub, now Rozario's is a serious disappointment. The menu is incomplete and the service is insanely slow. What is served is absolutely unexpected and incomplete. The staff are not trained enuff to tell you what you will get in the new menu. Hidden behind the names are unpleasant surprises. 

Where on earth do you expect a veg platter which will have almost everything deep fried except potatoes??

At 8pm in an empty restaurant they are not in a position to serve Mojito. 

I call the owners to think about it, I was such a fan of kurry Klub and kept recommending the place and menu to my acquaintances. 

The one point rating is only for the makeover which is also a disaster with old age furniture and table cloths. Water glasses are so outdated and with lack of options, one would wish to have the kurry Klub menu.

Another shameful thing was that the lady owner was present when we entered and when we called for her to complain and show her the below the standard stuff, she sent her employees back saying she wouldn't attend as she is busy and to write a note for her in a small stick-ons pad. 

Utterly ridiculous!!!

Previously known as KURRY CLUB. Saw on T2 that the owner has handed over the reigns of the resturant to his daughter , the pictures on T2 of the new offerings (satay/skewers...etc) plus the interiors looked very appealing. So gave it a visit with family for dinner just a few days back. The moment we entered, we were let down by the new interiors......the cosy feel of Kurry Club is gone......now it looks more like an ordinary sweet shop...not even a cafe, with a huge display counter upfront, a soft drink chiller just adjacent to the entrance, a huge board on the wall where menu is written in chalk and very ugly and outdated furniture ( specially the laminates used on tables).....table cloths previously used are gone. 

Coming to food we ordered for the all time hit Non-Veg Fondu with chiken orley ...which was good. Next we ordred for the meat platter (newly introduced).....this was a disaster. The satay/skewers was very chewy and dry, lacked taste and tenderness. I have had satay in Thailand and many places around the globe, they taste heavenly.....but in Rozario's it was a let down. Even the fritters and buffalo wings were very very very average.....had to order a few soft drinks to flush every thing down. Skipped main course...could not take it any more.

In my opinion Kurry Club was much much better in all respects.

They have done away with the Indian cuisine.......and a few other items, most of it form the previous menu is still there. Used to love the Fusion Kabak....it' no more there in the menu.
