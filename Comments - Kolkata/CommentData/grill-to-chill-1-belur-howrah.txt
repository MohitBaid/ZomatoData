Good quality food and very reasonable on the pocket. Also the ambience is excellent. Service is good too. Location is bang on GT Road. Only issue is that due to entry space bigger cars will have slight problem getting inside the main portico. Recommended.

This place is excellent.
Good decor.
Great food.
Good service.
An ideal place for a family dinner/lunch.
The size of this place is a little small and it doesn't have a table large table but the staff there gets it done for you.

Been here today as it newly openned. Ordered chicken tandoori which was good to taste at first but after sometimes I discovered it was not well cooked from inside. Staffs are not really trained but do not misbehave and try hard to satisfy customers..  I also tried fried chicked and honey chicken. Honey chicken was good but fried chicken was not.

Newly opened Good family restaurant at uttarpara.. Dis one is a multi cuisine restaurant.. From appetizer to dessert, they have huge variety in their menu card..

Located near uttarpara college bus stand.. 5 mins walking distance from ballykhal.. If you r not from dis area thn also u don't have to face any difficulties to find dis one.. 

Best well decorated eatery at uttarpara. ambiance is too good.. Nice and sober decorative ceiling lights makes der ambiance much beautiful.. Service is a bit slow. Staffs are well behaved bt not dat much professional. Air-conditioned dinning have few sitting arrangements.. If u wanna go on any holiday or weekend u ve to wait a long outside..

Now coming to d food, we ordered coke, fresh lime soda, chicken drumstick ,honey chicken, mix fried rice, mutton biriyani(takeaway),chilli chicken dry, butter nun, chicken do piyaza, ice cream..

Chicken drumstick(4/5) - it was good enough.  Crispy nd spicy.. 

Honey chicken (1.5/5) - small pieces of fried chicken coated wid honey and sesame seeds.  I can't even say dat was any snacks item.  Rather i can say it was a chicken dessert..  

Butter nun(3/5) - nothing much to say about dis..usual taste of nun.. Though it named as butter nun Bt butter was invisible..

Chicken do piyaza(3.5/5)-  umm well..  Finally i gt some good main course ovr der..  It was tasty and properly cooked.. 

Mutton biriyani(4/5)- i can say dis is d best cooked dish from dis restro.. Yummy flavoured rice with boiled potato, One big piece of juicy ,soft mutton was der.. 

Mixed fried rice(4/5)- dis one was also good enough..  Proper portion of veggies, egg and chicken was mixed with rice.. It was too good.. 


Dry chilli chicken(3.5/5)- it had average taste.. Some pieces of chicken was not fresh, chewy..

Pricing is moderate..  All over i had a good experience.. Some of der food were really disappointing bt some of those were also pretty good..

Food was good.. but the staffs are really untrained.. that's why their service is slow and inappropriate. But the food was really good.. and the most important thing for me is, it's just 3mins away from my home.. :-p

Good food. Professional members and they have empathy to show if late to deliver the food. I enjoyed. But space is bit low. Seat needs to be increased.

Went recently. Had Crispy Chicken and few more stuff. Food was better than other restaurants in the area. Teenagers will love this kind of ambience with their lovable ones. Service was good. Online payment options can be added as the time of digital payment. Keep up the good work.

My experience was quiet good,my order was chicken friedrice and dry chilli garlic pepper chicken(very good).The rice was not good but they apologised and soon changed it and gave chicken hakka noodles(we changed the order).
Ambience is nice and the budget is also pocket friendly.

I went there hopping to have Briyani but unfortunately I get a cold Briyani and the aloo was not properly cooked and it's like I'm on diet and I having a which is just boiled and serve and the Chicken piece has no taste and when I told to a waiter that this is a briyani please have a bite of it he refused.
Worst Briyani ever experience.
