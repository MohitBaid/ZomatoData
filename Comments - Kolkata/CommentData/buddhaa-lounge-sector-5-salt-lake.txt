Thud place is located in some good place in sector 5 but it has lost its view after being in the lane inside. The inside ambiance is quite good decorated. I heard a lots of good and bad things about the place. But it didn't served alcohol that day but we friends enjoyed it was cheap and good food.

This place has good food,good music and good ambience. The place is not that huge though. There are not many Continental dishes available. Mostly it's a pub.

A very bad experience!! Extremely poor service.. They play really high music and then they don't attend. We had to shout to call upon the attendants. We had ordered 4 plates of fried rice and they just served us with two plates stating that each bowl has the quantity equivalent to two bowls. The same thing was repeated with Hunan chicken we asked for two and they served us with just one stating the above reason. However the rice was uncooked and the chicken too had nothing extraordinary. 

Highly not recommended!

Three of us went to this place on a Saturday evening. There was 2:1 offer going on any drinks so we ordered breezer,whiskey and tequilla shots.

In food we ordered the following:
‚àö Thai Dry Chicken
‚àö Chicken in corn and mushroom
‚àö Fish in Chilly oyster sauce
‚àö Shanghai chicken
Each and every food was very tasty and sumptuous.
We also had one teen paan hookah.

They should really improve their service. We have to ask for ice several times and it was even charged for 35/- in the bill. I have been drinking for the past 10 years and I have never seen any bar charging for ice.
Infact they have pool board inside the pub so we went and played few games but while we asked for bill they asked us how many games did we play. There was no such information that it was chargeable neither we were informed about it. Finally we talked to the manager and then he did not charge for that.

Overall a nice place to eat and drink but they should really work on their service.

The food is really pathetic. Hunan chicken smells like uncooked chicken. Service is also very poor. Waited for 3 hours for the food. Still the food was cold. They told 1 plate rice will enough for 2 person. But 2 plate can't feed even 2 people. 

The worst experience i have ever had. I will not recommded to anybody. I wish i could rate this 0 star. 

THANKS FOR WASTING OUR TIME.

Well, another lounge in the making at the coveted Sector 5, Saltlake area and another dig at it!

They are conveniently situated in the corner of the 1st floor of the Bytes Food Court, Infinity Benchmark building. I finally entered this place and was thoroughly impressed with the ambience ‚Äì they display good night life and a fine ambience for disc lovers and hookah smokers!

They have also tried to impart a Buddha theme with some Thai d√©cor, a Buddha statue meditating, Buddha paintings adoring the walls etc. I was seated on a huge comfortable sofa set and ordered the below:-

Fresh lime soda (sweet / salt) ‚Äì Excellent ‚Äì perfectly chilled and high on taste with a couple of red cherries adoring it

Veg Chowmein ‚Äì Great, good presentation also and oil content reasonable

Chilly paneer - crispy and hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiighly spicy, gravy being particularly tasty

To make matters worse, they forgot to serve me water to soothe my tongue which was wounded due to the highly spicy paneer!

Service was somewhat helter-skelter, but still I felt that the attendants were nice!

Overall, a good experience and totally worth the price I paid!

Went into here first time as Barbeque nation was chockablock that day. Went in around 1:45 pm on a Wednesday and it was empty. Little surprised but I was happy because that means not much noise around. Ordered 2 plates of kebabs and kept waiting. At 2:20 ( after about 35 min) I enquired the status and they said it will still take another 15 min to deliver. On confronting they said the Tandoor was not ready and they apologised for not informing the same. Bu that time I had also placed the main course. Finally the food was served at 2:40. By that time we were fuming with the way they treated us. Food was good but the service was pathetic to say the list. 
Venture on your own risk plz.

We didn't plan to visit Buddha lounge. Since we were a group of 12 people we were not getting any place where they could accommodate 12 people at 10:40pm on a Friday night. We were standing right below the building and we were almost on the verge to visit ocean grill when this guy from Buddha lounge came to us and requested us to at least see their ambience and give them a chance. He then offered us 20% discount on food and drinks along with 40% discount on hookah and no additional taxes  (none at all). Needless to say , we agreed to give it a try.
Here is the list of food we ordered:
Thai dry chicken 
Shanghai chicken 
Chili garlic fish 
Mixed pan fried noodles 
Hunan chicken 
Hot garlic chicken 
Crispy chicken in honey chilli sauce 
Chicken steak in mushroom sauce 
Grilled fish in butter garlic sauce.
The food tasted really good especially the chili garlic fish.they also customise the food according to your liking. The noodle did lack salt.
Now the negatives: 
We also ordered for fresh like soda and it was by far the worst fresh lime soda we had tasted. The lemon that they used  was bitter and there was way too much salt and we asked for mixed soda which means there should have been a sweet element too. Do i need to say more?
The noodle practically had no salt. We had to ask for extra salt  and pepper because when they finally served the food it was 12:30am, so we didn't have time to send it back to the kitchen because we were all starving which brings me to there service. Everything is flawed in this place. From beginning to end. Considering it is a new place their lounge sofas and cushions were extremely dirty.  The dim lighting couldn't hide the fact. The place that was given to sit on was not cleaned after the previous guests left. They started cleaning all the spilled food after we were already seated. While serving food they didn't provide us with any serving spoon with the dish. We had to constantly ask for forks and spoon. They kept switching off the air conditioner and it was suffocating all the time. We had to ask so many times to put the a/c back on. I have never experienced this before. They have terrible service. At one point we thought that the food won't arrive at all because we placed the order at 10:45pm. It arrived at 12:30am. The chef did a good job and the guy who was serving the drinks was really sweet too and the only genuine one too. Will I visit this place again ?? Well not at my own expense at least

Dull music, very expensive drinks,pathetic service & non trained staffs.... that's my experience about this place. Except the ambiance this place has nothing to offer. I went with my group of friends & nothing was told to us when we entered this place however when we asked for the bill it was around 2300(approx) but we were forced to pay 2500 as they have a coupon system of 250rs each...We ordered fish finger & crispy babycorn & both the item was below average and to top it up it took them more than 30mins to serve. If I have to describe the music than I would say "pathetic". Overall awful experience... Definitely will never recommend this place to anyone.

Some simple items like fish finger took almost 30mins to be served...Pls ask for coupon system if any while entry or at time of bill u might feel cheated.
DJ was ok but not great. Only recommend for hookah lovers... Food and drinks are on higher side... A better brand like 10Downing street offers better food n drinks at better rates.... Fish finger in conti menu was served with kasundi (mustard sauce) mixed with ketchup.. (low grade) rather than the tarter sauce....

Will not go next time.... For interior I give 3.... Nicely made but management must look into hiring better service men....

Last but not the least we were not given change for balance amount and had to forcibly buy 2water bottles....

Located in Salt Lake Sector 5 right opposite Pour House, went to this lounge with a friend and ordered their pizza combo which had a small pizza, some fries and a soft drink. I liked the pizza till I had devoured one slice of it. By the time I had reached the second slice, the crust became way too hard for my teeth. Fries were the only good part about the entire combo meal.
The staff won't care about your presence which seemed unprofessional. Really liked the interior though. Would have liked it more had the place not been so shady.

Well, this is one of the restaurant cum bar cum sheesha lounges located on the first floor of the infinity building..visited it last sunday with a friend and my girl in order to spend a relaxed evening...starting with the ambience and decor, it is completely themed on gautam buddha, is quite dark with mainly dark red red couches, big enough in size to accomodate a sizeable group...they also had a separate non smoking area , isolated from the smoking zone, for the ones who just want to have food over there..overall, the setting inside will get you into the grooves for relaxed dancing , drinking and smoking..they have a provision for a dj playing his music and a dance floor right in front of him amidst the very well chosen disco type lights..as for food, we chose their combo no. 5 which included a crispy chilli baby corn (though the quantity was more than sufficient for 2,it was'nt much crispy and at the same time was a touch too burnt ) , a blue berry mint hookah (was really mild and a really good to hookah to smoke) and a coke.. it cost us rs 399 and they don't charge any extra taxes (i.e. the combo price mentioned in the menu was inclusive of all taxes and not hideous as the menus in many of the restaurants tend to do)..coming to the overall prices, i would say it is moderate...service though can be a lot better...was personally not too pleased with the service..however there are a few things they should be more sincere about , to mention one, i had visited buddhaa lounge one more time 2 weeks back to encash a little deal to which they blatantly replied, "we don't accept little anymore"..fine enough..but then they should take their name off little..when i asked for the same, they said "yaa..il contact them"..the result is, even a couple of days back the little deals for buddhaa lounge were still showing..these things should really be taken care of..anyways was overall an okay experience and might come back here for the hookah again..

Me and my friends went to Buddha Lounge in a rainy afternoon, around 1:20pm. There was only one place occupied when we entered so it was kinda dead. We took the pool room as we wanted to play it. We ordered a fruit chillam hookah, 3 redbulls and one oreo shake.

Positive points:
- a very nice ambiance and decorations.
- good music selection 
- bathrooms are very nice
- hookah was very nice  

Negative points:
- extremely slow service. I had to ask for my oreo shake 4 times. And when my friend asked one of the server, he told us he was going for a lunch break and someone else will serve us.
- not at all spacious for playing pool. You need a lot of room for your body movements which unfortunately, it lacks.

Went there today at evening for trying out this place, as they are having 40% discount on hookah.
The decor is strictly following the theme that is buddha, when you enter you get see a big statue of buddha, on the left of which they have comfy couches, also there is a gadda kind of seating arrangement for big groups. On right they have a bar setup. There is a live dj playing not so cool music in between and a tv that was showing Crime patrol, in such an amazing lounge. So there is a huge lack of professionalism in the attitude of the staff and not at all well managed.
Service was slow compared to the crowd which was our group and another couple at one end, but staff was well behaved.
We went with the basic chilli mushroom and baby corn, with blueberry mint shisha. Shisha was decent, but food was very average so was the plating.
It has a very good potential as a lounge but other lounges nearby are doing pretty well and attracting all the crowd. Whereas this one is just an average place, which needs to buck up.

Card wasn't accepted when we went there on 23rd July. Food quality wasn't good. Dj was good.. Service isn't good. Hookah was ok. Lot of space for improvement
