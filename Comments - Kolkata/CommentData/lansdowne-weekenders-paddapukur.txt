I tasted their muffins and loved them. They had the perfect blend of sweetness and bitterness of chocolate. If you like a balanced dessert , neither too sweet, nor too sour or bitter, i recommend their muffins. I did not have time to taste the other wonderful looking dishes, but the all looked scrumptious. A refreshing take on food.
