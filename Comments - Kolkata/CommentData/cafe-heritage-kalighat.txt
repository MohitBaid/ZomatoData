Cozy place. Staffs tries their best to satisfy the needs of the customers. Hooka is good. Tried chicken club sandwich with chicken sweet corn soup. Quantity is okay. Tastes good. 
 
This place is near Mudiali. Opposite of Peep In.

Staffs are very helpful. The location of the place is a big negetive mark. However if managed well they can do much better.

I ordered from Swiggy today. I ordered Mexican Pizza, Chicken Burger and Chicken sweetcorn soup.  But when I opened the Pizza  box it was a nightmare. The entire Pizza toppings including the cheese had fallen on one side and only the bread was there. Also, it was sooo oily. They don't know how to make a Pizza? My kid did "eww" and did not eat. Had to throw it away. The burger bun was stale. Horrible experience. And I have tasted waaay better soups than this.

Nice and friendly staffs, good ambience, nice sitting arrangements. Hookah was good. Had a good time over there. Should go with friends. It's in kalighat road just near sarobar. Easy access and you won't face any difficulties finding the place. Give it try.

I'm not satisfied to go there.. Ambience was good.
But the service is really needed to improve.. First of all I ordered kimma kimma pizza and sizzling brownie with icecream. Within five minutes they told.. Sizzling brownie isn't possible.. But it is in the menu card. What the level of irresponsibility.. ! ..then we have ordered mini sundae... Okay.. After 20 minutes they gave us Mini sundae.. I think we all eat icecream at last..ðŸ˜‚ they gave us that at first.. After 30 minutes we had knocked them for pizza.. Then they told that...They have forgotten the order.. But their cafe was empty.. Just they all r watching TV.. What a service.. !! I just cannot imagine ..in which audacity they have opened a cafe ...!!!

Last but not the least ~ The proper menu card which we have seen in zomato , they haven't that.. We all r go through the menu card for the items and its prices.. Kindly pls update your menu card in zomato.. They have increased their price..its OK.. But they should update it.. Isn't it..???
But must say food was good no doubt..

We were too hungry and found this nearby restaurant. We ordered a cheese sandwich...The sandwich was served raw...One the worst places I've been...
Not recommended! 
Ps- the interiors, though are glamarous!

"Very poor behaviour of the owner."Â 
Â I went to this place to meet a director and to discuss about his new work. We took this place and asked them to put down the curtains. First of all the owner said these are only for show and not for privacy. When we said that we have some important thing to discuss on thus we want it to be close so that we can concentrate and talk peacefully. Then the owner it cannot be done because the customer behind your sit cannot see the tv, and the owner showed a very poor behaviour with his customer and even cancelled our order.

Disgusting ambience and yes the customer base is unsuitable for anybody coming from good family backgrounds and the management is very bad. Please don't come to this place if you have got some dignity. I made this mistake today and I will never suggest this place to anybody.

Only for the ambience and interior. Ordered chicken nuggets and Indian pizza. The nuggets were very less in quantity, compared to the price. The pizza wasn't good in taste. Surely won't be visiting again.

This charu market area badly needed a cafÃ© since long. You might have passed by this cafÃ© and never noticed it. Located on the four point crossing near the Ravindra Sarovar metro station and opposite the old famous "Peep in" this place is a surprise. There is white door which gives you an impression that the cafÃ© would be a very basic one but once you push the door and enter, its brilliant!
The ambience is soo cool and so is the seating arrangement. There are proper coops with cushions and curtains where you can sit, relax and chat for hours.
Seesha is available.
Coming to the food, tasted quite a few things.  Chicken sandwich, pizza and a few chicken dishes.
The beverages are bit overpriced.
Overall you can come over if you are somewhere around and desperately need a place to hangout.

Went to this place on sunday at around 9.30. There were hardly 4-5 people there. Decent cozy set up with quick service. The food, hookah and even the mocktails were good. Reasonable rates and value for money.

Surprisingly good food for a hookah cafe. I have tried the sandwiches, the chicken fries, the noodles and the chilli chicken and they were all up to the mark. Special mention for the chicken kebab sandwich and the chicken fries. Very fresh and soft meat. Friendly staff. Ambience is decent, too. Will definitely go back here to try the other items on their menu.

This cafe is situated just a few mins away from Rabindra Sarovar Metro station. If you are going towards Rashbehari from Tolly then it will be on your left hand side. Interiors were good too with proper seating arrangements. Coming to food we had their Italian sphagetti which tasted amazing then we had their chicken barbeque pizza which wasn't that great. From beverages we had fresh lime soda. It was surprising to hear that they don't serve regular water. Service was okayish.

I am very disappointed with the service of this restaurant.
The food was not too tasty to give special mention.
The hookah was fair.
The menu card had the price of cold drinks as Rs70. Neither they separately mentioned the amount for 300ml or 600ml nor they told us that the 600ml price is not printed. Once we ordered two bottles of the same they charged us 125rs for each bottle in the final bill. When we talked about it they said sorry and we had to suffer for their mistake.
An unpleasant experience for sure.
