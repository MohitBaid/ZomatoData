There were a lot of hype about this place among my friends.
At last we got a complimentary food from zomato and ended up tasting the brownies and cookies.
It was really yummy.
A must visit for all the cafe enthusiasts.
And a perfect evening goes well with cookies and a cup of coffee !!

This is one stop shop for all your sweet cravings. Their brownies are a favorite indulgence for us. I have ordered a few customized gourmet cakes for parties and the look and taste is just spectacular! Must try for any event.

Delicious collection, must try for bread lovers. Brown bread is the best find at attractive prices too. Had tried mason jar Sweets for Rakhi and was appreciated by one and all
