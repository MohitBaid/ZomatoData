Have visited this joint a few times. It's located near La Martiniere for Boys School. The interiors are nice and funky. However the food and service can be improved a lot. Time taken to serve the food after ordering is more than the usual average waiting time. So....the items that I had here are :

DRINKS 
Green Apple Fizzy - (2/5) Didn't like it much. Was much too sweet for my liking.
Oreo Shake - (3.5/5) Average. Could have been much better if it would have been more chocolaty.
Virgin Mojito - (3/5) Average. 
Fresh Lime Soda - (3.5/5) Refreshing but average.

STARTERS
Mexican Chicken Skewers - (3/5) Taste is average and tge portion sizes are too small. The dollop of plain curd on top somehow does not complement the dish.
Chicken Nachos - (3.5/5) Quantity is good, eniugh for 3 people. Generous amount of chicken and toppings provided. However, taste is average.

MAINS
Grilled Fish with Lemon Caper Sauce : (3.5/5) The fish is fresh and tge sauce is quite nice. However it fails to deliver the desired punch.
Stuffed Chicken Steak - (4/5) The steak was stuffed with spinach and tastedvery nice. In fact the the best item i had here. The sauce that came alongwith it was smooth and creamy. The side of veggies were nicely done and tge mashed potatoes were smooth.
Classic Chicken Steak - (3.5/5) Average taste. Had much better in other places. Tried it trice with pepper, mushroom and BBQ sauce. Would recomment the mushroom sauce. It's the best. The sides provided were also average.
Tandoori Chicken Steak - (2.5/5) Not good. The steak was nice, spicy, tender and well done. But the sauce was a disaster and clashed with the steak horribly. The veggies were soggy and tge mashed potato had lumps.
Chicken Stroganoff - (2.5/5) A disaster. Bland in taste. Worst stroganoff ever.
Mutton Steak - (3/5) Average taste. Nothing extraordinary.
Mutton Cheese Burst Burger - (3.5) Again, quite average. Overloaded with tomato and lettuce. The cheesy portion was not adequate for it to be justified as a chesse burst. Any regular burger has that much amount of cheese, sometimes even more.

Overall, a place one can go to for average Continental food without burning a hole in the pocket

This restaurant is located just opposite to La Martiniere for boys bus stop on AJC Bose road. The stairs are quite steep to step on which leads to the dinning area. The place was little stuffy  and smelt of sizzler which made us cough for sometime after stepping in. We ordered the following-

*Food*
1. DC special chicken: this dish was different and really nice. 
2. Grilled fish skewers: it was really spicy and had thin stripes of fish on the grill. 
3. Chicken lasagne: this dish was extremely disappointing in terms of both quantity and taste. 
4. Pesto chicken pizza: I had added an extra cheese topping to this and I am truly happy about that. Even after the addition the cheese seemed to be too less. It also didn't please my taste buds. 
*Beverages*
1. Orange juice: the usual one.
2. Virgin Pina colada: tasted fine.
3. Berry blast: best compared to others.

The staff was polite and attentive. I am just not happy with their quantity in each dish and the taste was nothing great. I expected better.

It's a great place for a quick bite. Take your friends along and have a gala time. However, the area is small so be aware of the time when you're planning to go to avoid the crowd. The food is really food and is amazingly pocket friendly. Good ambience, good food, good time and all on a budget. Totally thumbs up!

Amongst all the recent places I have been Deli Cravings was probably the best. Take a mere 5 minutes walk from Exide more towards Minto Park, AJC Bose Road to reach this joint. The kitchen is on the ground floor and on the first floor they have a compact seating arrangement. The interior does not have much detailing except for some contrasting red and blue sofas, and a glass wall overlooking the city trails of a busy Kolkata street.

There was only one staff member present the whole time and he was very polite and attentive. Drinks were the first to arrive on our table. The Mango Chilli twist had the perfectly balanced sweetness of mango and hit of chilli. The Paan Mojito had Betel leaves and other sweeteners that we find in a Misti Paan. Both drinks were unusual and tempting. They did not serve any kind of chatny or dip with Chicken Harissa Kebab and it felt a little dry. Harissa is a mixture of different chilli pastes but the kebabs were not that flavoursome. Chicken in chilli orange sauce had really nice orange gravy. Grilled Fish in Filo Basket had three fillets of fish and some vegetables in the middle of a basket made of Filo Pastry. Last two dishes were absolutely toothsome. And for me this was an a fulfilling dine experience.

A good place with a different taste of food. However the staff behaviour was lukewarm and lacked the warmth that was expected. However the price was really economic and our meal for two with mocktails, main course and dessert only cost us 1k. The mocktails were good. I tried the ice cream soda with mango flavour and shepherd's pie. However the shepherds pie was a little down in competition than that at spicecraft. The ice cream was also good. And this place is a good visit for everybody atleast once.

It is like the heaven for junk eaters, especially the students of my college (the neighbours). They serve absolutely finger-licking food and then you are bound to come here again and again!! This time we have tried mexican hotpot, grilled chicken with barbeque sauce and grilled fish with lemon and caeper sauce. Grilled fish and grilled chicken were amazing, but mexican hotpot did not have that mexican flavour (except the spiciness). It was only basil and coriander  that we could remember after having the dish. We also had a nice cafe frappe there.  And the best part is, it's highly pocket friendly to satisfy your craving.

A simple review for deli cravings
Pros
Good location
Seating is always available
They have home delivery
Prices are reasonable for the quality
Personal favourites: Classic chicken steak, stuffed chicken steak, chili orange chicken

Cons
Finding a place to park
Sometimes they take a little too long to prepare food(It's worth it though)

Overall
It's a must place try for continental food, almost all the dishes are pretty good and the prices are fair. A must visit for foodies

This little place at Minto Park is just the perfect spot for a hangout. It has a cool and peppy decor and courteous staff. The menu has variety and the food is of satisfactory quality and quantity. The chicken steaks are a must try. The pasta is also tasty. Also, the beverages are a must. The milk shakes taste super. The pricing however is slightly on the higher side.

This place is an absolute gem. With alot of Continental joints failing to make a mark with their inflated prices and average preperations, I am usually very sceptical before trying out a place specializing in this cuisine. 
Seeing the good reviews and low prices, I decided to give this place a try. A very good decision, indeed.

The interiors are modest and comfortable. Their USP is the wide variety of food at such competitive prices. 
Have tried their Cheese Fries, Chicken Stroganoff, Chicken Roulade, Chicken Burger, Mexican Chicken Pizza, Mexican Hot Pot and a Veg steak (cannot remember the exact name)

Each dish was prepared so well. Their Stroganoff and Cheese fries are to die for. Burgers are juicy and the best I have had in that price bracket. 

Overall, a place worth trying and revisiting-again and again.

A lousy afternoon was perfectly poised with eccentric ambience of this place. This joint is located at minto park, walking distance from rabindra sadan metro station.
So, this place was in my wishlist for quite a long time. With the rating so high it was tempting.. so we decided to pay a visit here
Not a big place but spacious enough to accommodate 15-20 people at a time.
Coming to food, in one word it was delicious.
We had mexican chicken skewers, tandoori chicken steak, chicken chinese sizzler, chef's special pizza and chocolate fondant..
Overall this place is nice and pocket friendly!

This place is a 3mins walk from Minto park. The decor is pretty simple yet nice. For starters we ordered Mexican Chicken Skewers. It was a little  spicier than we expected, but nevertheless it tasted good. Then we opted for Chef's non veg special pizza, which was thin crust, had two types of toppings of chicken and loads of cheese (♥♥♥).
Also we ordered the Chinese chicken sizzler and tandoori chicken steak. Both tasted pretty good.
For desserts we chose to have the classic chocolate fondant. It was AMAZING! the outer part of the cake had just the right amount of sweetness whereas the molten chocolate inside was LOVE! it was served with a scoop of ice cream.
Overall this place is a good option for lunch or dinner with family or friends. The icing on the cake is that it's not too hard on the pocket! 😃

Only two tables were occupied, still the staff got confused about what we ordered! Strange!! So absent minded!! We asked him about fish chips and prawn in Habanero sauce but asked for the later only.The food was served after 25 mins and the staff came with both and said both are good and we can have them! Donno wat nonsense is this! We refused to have both and he took away. Next we ordered chicken lasagna and we were disappointed! Mozzarella cheese is an important ingredient of lasagna and the staff was stubborn enough to say that it's never so.Zero knowledge about food! Just a layer of cheese was given on top whereas it should trickle down the entire thing. Chicken was cut into minute pieces like that inside a momo!! Total waste of money! Mocktails tasted good. Please don't visit this place.

After so many orders from zomato, this is undoubtedly the best value for money order I have ever placed. The fish was fresh, herb rice was aromatic and the quantity was perfect (not very high or not very low either). The delivery was very quick, way before estimated time. I need to mention that it is not the nearest restaurant zomato order. 
As a prime member I received the complimentary Brownie-A-La. It was real treat and the quantity was enough for two.

The place serves brilliant quality and tasty food and provides you to choose from a whole lot of options. Located close to the Minto Park crossing, on the main road, the place is quite easy to spot!!

The place is near minto park... After hearing a lot we decided to visit..
Service is a bit slow ambience is pretty good.. staffs are good and friendly...
Coming to the food part we ordered

1ST Mexican Chicken skewars --- This dish was very tasty and spicy, but given the price quantity is too much low, very small in size...

2ND Classic Chicken steak with bbq sauce --- This was a bellyfuller though it is pretty much in the ordinary side by taste....

3RD Grilled fish with mango chilli sauce --- This dish suprises me, it is very light, well cooked and tastes good dish, its not amazing but good...

4TH Chocolate fondant cake --- This was amazing, from the decor of the plate to the taste of it, pretty good....

5TH Brownie a la mode --- It is another amazing desert, every inch of this dish is just mouthwatering...

Overall the place is a bit high side on the price given the quantity but the deserts are beautiful... Maybe vist again not very soon..

I've been here twice and ordered different things on both occasions so as to deliver a fair and just review. In my first experience I ordered the mutton burger and a sandwich. Unfortunately the servers were not pleasant or very educated about their own menu. The food itself took quite a while. Even the drinks somehow took 20 mins to make which made no sense. The second time I visited I went with the mindset that the service food and waiting time would be unchanged. Yet for all I was pleasantly surprised. The waiter had a smile and even greeted us. He even asked us how the food was which i sometimes find annoying but did not mind this time. I had the bolognese and the loaded nachos this time all were delivery within 15 mins including our drinks which were excellent by the way. The food had significantly improved in quality and i would definitely visit this place again!! I may even change my rating depending on how the next visit goes. I wish I took more pictures of the food though...

I had a really good experience visiting this place. I alongwith my office friend went there at the evening. 
It is located near DB Desai's office, Minto Park. 
The place is albeit small, yet it's a hidden gem. 
The decor is good but I find they need to improve the seating arrangement. It is just average. 
We ordered pizza, pasta, lasagne & Litchi mocktail. 
Everything tasted well. 
They took a lot of time to get the pizza ready. So it will be better if you ask them before ordering. 
Visit soon!

A small joint located just near minto park, its very easy to locate as it's just on the main road.
The ambience is not that great really, actually a bit drab, but the food totally makes up for it!
For starters we had chicken wings and chicken bell papers.
For main dish came chicken lasagne, chicken stroganoff, Shepherd's pie and chicken stuffed steak..All were totally amazing!
For desert we ordered chocolate fondent and that was actually very yummy.liquid chocolate filling cake alongside vanilla Icecream topped with chocolate sauce.
All together it was a good experiemce.
Pocket pinch is not that high too.

I've been here on one occasion, with my mom and cousin. Perhaps it's because we were in a hurry to get our Puja shopping complete, that we couldn't explore the menu to find the perfect dish that would make me give them a higher rating. 

I'll start with the ease with which we located this little joint, it's bang opposite La Martiniere for Boy's. I'd heard of this place from a couple of friends and also gone through its zomato page, which further urged me to go here and see for myself what the hullabaloo is all about. 

We ordered three drinks - the green apple mojito, the Virgin mojito and a glass of that refreshing fresh lime soda. The drinks were quite good, very energising and more than satisfactory. The mojitos were not overpowering-ly minty, and did hold well the taste of each ingredient that went into it. There's nothing to say about the fresh lime soda, it's a classic and one would need special talent to ruin that. 

When we had cooled down, we ventured into the food menu and since it was some time in the evening, it seemed appropriate to order some appetizers instead of any main dishes. I was dying to try the mozzarella sticks, so we got a plate of those, we got a plate of the chicken brushchetta and a plate of the red pepper chicken. 

The mozzarella sticks were good but bland, and not crispy of gooey enough, but maybe that's cause I wanted to take too many pictures of it first and it cooled down in the process. But I had higher expectations of those. But the barbecue sauce (I suppose?) they serve with it was the saving grace that binded the entire thing together and gave the bland taste a lift. 

Then came the brushchetta, which was also alright. Nothing extravagant. However, the tomato sauce was overpowering and didn't do much to the other ingredients. There was also a large amount of topping on the brushchetta, which I personally felt that was the cause of the overwhelming-ness of the dish. But still, thumbs up for the generous amount of chicken, which a lot of restaurants may have skimped out on. 

And finally the red pepper chicken. Taste wise this was amaze. Really. A little tangy, a little spicy had a nice zing about it. Very flavourful and all the flavours actually went REALLY well with each other. And brownie points to Deli Cravings for the sheer taste of this beautiful dish. 

The HUGE issue I had right from the moment the mozzarella sticks arrived at the table till the moment we'd devoured the red pepper chicken, was the tiny portions they serve. REALLY tiny. I don't know if this is a new development or it was this way from the beginning. If Deli Cravings is trying to convince people that it's like an all American diner, perhaps they should research on the gargantuan portions American diners serve. Especially the red pepper chicken, there were like 5-6teeny tiny little pieces of chicken on the serving plate. For the sake of argument, if it's the really reasonable pricing that makes you serve such minuscule "bites" of food to hungry customers, you can notch it up a little. But please refrain from insulting my hunger pangs by serving things I need a microscope to look at. 

That done, I will again give Deli Cravings brownie points for an extremely courteous staff and their immaculate service. The staff is ridiculously nice, and really takes their time to help you through the menu and recommends dishes/drinks that people will genuinely appreciate. 

I would go back again to try more things off their menu to find something I cannot complain about. I will MAYBE recommend it to friends but only because the pocket pinch is minimal and the food decent on the taste buds. 

P.S Yellow lights are more pleasing than white lights.

I have been ordering from this place for months now. But only recently I had a chance to go there and dine with a friend. 

We had ordered:

1. Mexican Cheese Fries - The only good part was the plain Fries. The beans were extremely spicy. There was hardly any cheese on it.

2. Bruschetta - They were moderately good but the excess cheese (like the ones in garlic bread) completely ruined it. 

3. Chicken Steak in Pepper Sauce - My go to dish even for home deliveries. It's filling for one person if you're not having anything else. The Pepper sauce is the star. They have other sauce options as well. It is served with some grilled veggies and mashed potato. 

4. Oreo Shake - Apart from half an Oreo biscuit on top of the glass, I couldn't taste Oreo in the entire shake. I could only taste milk with a slight chocolate flavour. It was too thin to be named a Shake and too milky to find any trace of Oreo. A complete disaster.

The service time was a little longer than expected but that could be because we were the only ones there. The staff on the other hand is prompt and courteous.

Very nice place to treat your friends without burning a hole in your pocket. I would recommend the chilli orange sauce with chicken or prawns, Mexican hot pot, stuffed chicken steak, grilled fish with mango chilli sauce, had mutton lasagna and shepherd's pie both but they tasted the same. In pizza, harissa and zingara peri peri were good but of thin crust. I know the chocolate fondet is very famous here, but i personally didn't like it. The hot chocolate dark was very good.

Celebrated my birthday at Deli Cravings this evening. I ordered a Chicken Roulade, which was cooked to perfection. Succulent chicken pieces on a bed of rice and creamy beautiful pinkish sauce-was like a walk through the most mouth watering flavors and colors! The waiter recommended a stuffed chicken steak dish for my Mother- which came out cooked perfectly and stuffed with juicy beautifully cooked spinach and cheese with creamy mashed potatoes. Brother and dad ordered lasagna, and they loved it as much. We were so impressed with the food that we had to order desserts. The banana with toffee, brownie with ice cream and my Dad's Fruity Bliss ice cream  were as delectable as they looked! I am really impressed with the food and the simplicity but elegance of the presentation plus the prices are so reasonable for such good service. I will definitely go back again to try some more new dishes and highly recommend!

If your budget is limited but you want to have some Continental food, then this is your place. This place serves wide variety of Continental food but due to time constraint I couldn't experiment much in the menu, so I ordered classic chicken steak which was delicious to eat. The ambience is also pretty much good here but while eating you would often notice that the waiters are starting at you which is pretty much irritating. But overall the place is great especially for student population. So this should be included in your buck list.

I visited this cafe with high expectations after viewing it on zomato. However my expectations were not met with in the least . The food items have a standard price however the quantity served is extremely less. Moreover the place has flies and the servers on the top floor seem to stare at the customers while they eat. Both these things didn't sit well with me. We had ordered "Chicken Stroganoff" and "Chicken Cheese Burst Burger". The stroganoff had a delicious cheeesy white sauce. That was the only good part of our meal . The chicken cubes in the stroganoff was just plain chicken. I feel it could have been seasoned . As far as the cheese burst burger is concerned , I didn't find any cheese inside it. There was just a very thin layer of watery liquid inside it unlike the photos of the same burger I have seen on zomato. This was a one time visit for me.

I had been to Deli Cravings a while back so this review is long overdue. 
The place is a new joint, service is impeccable and so is the ambiance. It's mostly for the student crowd, it is cost friendly and the menu has a huge variety. 
What we ordered:- Mozzarella Cheese Sticks, Chilli Orange Sauce in Chicken, Margarita Pizza with add on chicken and two Mocktails. 
The Mozzarella Cheese Sticks were soft gooey and was made to perfection. I loved the sauce accompanying the sticks. 
The Chicken in Chilli Orange Sauce was something different, I enjoyed the taste. An experiment which
was successful. 
The Pizza was a let down, I didn't enjoy it. Specially the pizza sauce. It was extremely sweet for my liking. I don't know how can anyone go wrong with pizza.  Appreciative that they added the chicken, since it was a first for them. 
The Mocktails aren't anything to rave about, this area requires improvement.
I loved the music which was playing in the background, the attentive staff and the new variety of dishes they have. Will definitely come back and try other dishes. They should work on the above mentioned areas.

Rs 650 for two isn't that approx value.
Ambience was good.
Ordered creamy mushroom soup (good one), black mojito (too much mint), chicken lasagna( okay-ish),
Chicken skewers in bbq sauce  ( didn't liked much), chocolate fondant  ( basically was a type of choco lava cake and not that much soft and moist, changed my knowledge about chocolate fondant :v ).
Staffs were good but they are like starring you all the time.
Overall experience not so bad.

The restaurant is located in Minto Park near the flyover. The ambience is ordinary and the staffs are cordial. The food taste was really good but the quantity was impossibly less. We ordered-
1) Mexican chicken skewers (veryyy less in quantity but the taste was really good)
2) Stuffed mushrooms (again taste was good but had only 3 balls of it)
3)Stuffed chicken steak ( it was ok types and kind of tasteless)
4)Chicken BBQ sizzler ( it was good but again quantity was quite less when compared to other restaurants where I have had sizzlers)
5)Chocolate fondant ( I don't know why they call it fondant when it is just a basic chocolate lava cake, but the taste was good)
Bill was 1200 including GST
So in all it's reasonable restaurant but if you want to have a sumptuous meal then I guess you'll have to order 10 dishes. 
I don't  recommended this restaurant for lunch or dinner.

I think I have tried almost everything from the menu and my favourite is Nutella crepe with banana...whatever new I may try I always order one crepe. It's something I just can't seem to stop eating. One bite and I am addicted. The other items to try are their burgers, chicken steak, gnocchi in red pepper sauce, grilled fish.

The décor supplemented by the rich taste of their food will surely leave you grasping for words. We had chicken lasagna, cream of mushroom soup and chicken in chilly and orange sauce. The food had us spellbound amidst the picturesque scenario of a busy city in the back ground. The quantity is a cause of concern over here.

Its located near ajc bose college . when we entered the restaurant it was completely empty with us being the 1st customers for the night. Ordered expresso chicken steak and chocolate fondant. The steak was the worst that i have ever tried. The Mexican rice served with it was better in taste than the 3 slices of chicken itself. The chicken lacked the coffee favour to it so the name given to it seemed quite irrelevant. The chicken was chewy and felt half cooked. Very disappointed. But the chocolate fondant saved the day and hence this rating just goes for the dessert only. Would never come back again. Had a bad experience.

I and my friend happen to chance upon this place. We were hungry and this place was on the main road so we hopped in. When we found out it's Mexican we were glad, but the quantity and quantity of food wasn't up to the mark at all. The chicken wings tasted nothing great, and we found bones in the streak. The size of the meat in the streak was also very small. Overall wasn't happy at all. No wonder the place stays empty most of the time, as I heard later.

The restaurant has a good service and if you prefer delivery, then they are sufficient in doing so without delays. I must say, the menu is quite appeasing and the food equally so. Their signature Deli Special Salad is a must try and so is their choice of mediterrean food. Its hard to pick just one dish off a menu with a decent array of choices. Ideal for a casual hangout and for foodies looking to feed themselves with good food.

As far as the food is concerned tasted quite... We ordered stuffed chicken steak, classic chicken steak, fish, pasta, shepherd's pie and a pizza and also a starter everything tasted nice... The fish had a thick batter, chicken was tough. 
For dessert brownie which tasted really sweet and the ice cream was all melted, the crapes tasted really good that was the best dessert do try it...

This a small ordinary looking food joint with good food. The ambience is very ordinary but i liked the glass windows which gave a view of the busy street. Coming to the food, we ordered the mexican chicken skewers which was rather good. For mains we ordered 1) *stuffed chicken steak* (which was absolutely delicous) 2) grilled fish with spicy mango sauce ( ok,this didnt taste bad, but my point is the fish wasnt grilled it was fried. It tasted good but it wasnt "grilled" fish) 3)mexican chicken hot pot (personally i didnot like the taste of this, it was a good dish i guess,just not my type).For dessert we got a nutella banana crepe which was good. Our total bill was around 1400/- so its pretty pocket friendly 😃

Deli craving is located bang opposite LMB and next to the NISSAN showroom. It is quite easy to locate. 
The decor is quite mediocre with a huge window overlooking the busy street. Visited it on a Friday afternoon and it was quite empty. 

Coming to the food we ordered the highly recommend chicken skewers, the stuffed chicken steak, Mexican hot pot and grilled fish with chilli mango sauce. For desserts we had the Nutella crepes. 
 
The skewers were 5 in number and were juicy and delicious. My favourite among the mains was definitely the stuffed chicken steak. Loved everything about it. The Mexican hot pot was tangy and quite delicious too. The grilled fish although was absolutely yummy wasn't actually grilled but Pan fried- not a complaint when you are getting such delicious food. The fish was cooked to perfection. The Nutella crepes were great too- you can't find anything wrong with Nutella. 

The staff were friendly and courteous. However service was quite slow keeping in mind that there weren't many diners when we visited. 

Anyway, this place was a great find and would visit again- especially for the stuffed chicken 😋

This place is indeed a hidden gem. It took us a while to locate it but the effort was worth it. They serve a flare of Mexican and Continental dishes that will bring you back to the place craving for more. 

Location : It's located right on the opposite street of LMB school. There's a Nissan showroom nearby so if you can locate that you will be able to locate this place. 

Decor : The place is not decked up with quirky stuffs or mind blowing decor but it does have red sofas and a painted wall. It has a TV which was on when we entered.

Food Ordered : Chicken Roulade - Rs 220
Grilled Chicken Steak - Rs 260 
Cranberry juice and thumps up. 
Now coming to the food the plating is very neat and attractive. The chicken roulade had stuffed olives, capers, corn and egg which was served in beetroot sauce which gave it a tint of pink color , sesame, green beans and herb rice. The beetroot sauce was creamy , chicken was cooked perfectly and was succulent. The beans were a bit bland but it compliments the dish well. The herb rice was full of mild flavour. This dish was very subtle yet bursting with flavours. 
The grilled chicken steak was delicious. The steak cooked to perfection. It was stuffed generously with spinach and mushroom. The white sauce was very creamy , smooth and complimented the steak very  well. The steak was served with sesame, green beans and mashed potato. 
The portions they serve is quite large and filling for one person. The food is so good that it will tantalize your taste buds.  The best thing about this place is that the pocket pinch is on the lower side. The staff was very polite and courteous. Also the service is quick. 
This place has stolen my heart. I'll revisit this place again and again to try some more dishes on their menu. Deli Cravings will leave you craving for more. The Sassy Gastronaut  highly recommends this place. Do check out this eatery guys I can vouch for this place that it  will not disappoint you.

A small place situated just beside the Prime Plaza Hotel. I loved it's Non-veg dishes.  Had a chicken steak sizzler and a classic chicken steak with mushroom sauce.  Both were lovely and filling.  Vegetarian dishes were less than average. Mexican pizza was unsatisfactory and Mexican fries was a disgrace to other dishes. We even had veg lasagna which was pretty good.  Service is good though I expected more from this place after noticing the zomato reviews.

Great varieties of italian dishes . Though the quantity is very less.. Not enough for even 1 people. We  ordered fish & prawn sizzler. It was okayish. We also ordered chicken wings. Its not at all worth the money. If you guys are planning to have lunch there, bunk it. Its a good place for pizzas and sandwiches. Stick to that only

I have been here once and it is the most reasonable place once can find in 2017! The food is incredible with quality ingredients. I had ordered pasta : Aglio Olio and trust me when I say this, it was incredible. It has the freshest olives, pasta tossed in olive oil. I absolutely loved it. Had ordered some mocktails to go with it and the mocktail was 70 bucks per glass . Where can one find a mocktail for 70 bucks! Love this place.

Do you love to try new foods but your wallet is not supporting you? Well Deli Cravings is here. Opposite to La Marts for Boys, this heaven of foodies resides. 
Their thin crust pizza is absolutely amazing. That too at rs. 200! 
Their Mexican burger is absolute delight at rs. 150!
The grilled fish in lemon caper sauce is something, I would go for again and again. And I really don't like fish. So you can imagine. 
For dessert lovers there is a good news in the name of Chocolate Fondant. It will melt your heart. Literally. :') 
Relatively fast service, good ambience and great foods. Giving them anything less than 5 is a crime!

Its a cute little place on the first floor in Minto Park. We had Oreo Shake, Brownie Shake, Blueberry Shake and Chicken burger. The price is very reasonable. And the quantities are okayish. The burger tasted very different from the conventional ones we usually have and it was served with thick potato wedges than the normal French fries. Very filling. Brownie shake was the best! It had bits and pieces of Brownie inside it and we had to actually ask the waiters to give us a spoon so that we can scrouch even the last settling pieces inside the glass. The blueberry smoothie tasted soothing, a slight flavour of chewing gum. The Oreo shake was equally good with an Oreo in the top.

Well there are only few cafes in town which impresses me, Deli Cravings is one of them.

Located in the midst of offices in minto park area this place stands like an oasis. 

Was very impressed to find out that it had a valet parking available.... Honestly how many restaurants in city offers this so welcoming service.. First impression that it cares ....

Food: was throughly continental food along with the italian fares. Taste was very delicate, and no overdose of spices/ oil.  Also, felt the stuff served was fresh. We enjoyed the chicken steak and tandoori steak. Breads.

Ambience: though this place is a cafe you can have good time by seating beside the large glass window overlooking the busy street. And music was relaxing too.

Value: prices was reasonable. However would love to have promotions and happy hours as this place is mostly frequented by office goers than party crowds.

Wish all the best 👍. And please keep up the quality.

Cute little joint located on AJC Bose Road next to Park Prime.  Cashier on the ground floor with seating space and a screen on the 1st floor serving a mix of continental and carafe cuisine.

While the food is tasty I personally feel the quantities for the price isn't feasible. If I was to compare it to similar places I have eaten at this place would lose out entirely on the quantity vs cost factor. If quantities are small pricing should be levied accordingly.

On the taste front no complaints be it the cream of chicken soup, the chicken cheese burst burger, the lamb burger or the double party lamb burger. If the above issue could be addressed by increasing the portions it would be perfect.

Cheers,

This place has some amazing food.  Being next door I drop by in quite frequently.  
Starters they have a dish in mushroom can't remember the name but it's  a must have if u are a mushroom lover.  
Their pizzas are also amazing.  Thin crust freshly baked bases.  
Main course.  Fish in chilli mango sauce 3 pcs fish served with some herbed rice is a must must have. 

Their sizzlers in all 3 meats are amazing be it fish prawn or chicken.  They lack potatoes in most of their sizzlers which is missed if u are a sizzler lover.  

Their agio olio is also very well prepared but the spaghetti quality they use could be upgraded as the spaghetti being thin compensates the taste of the more authentic Italian taste.  

Since I don't have a sweet tooth I rarely have deserts but I did try their crepe and it was really nice. 

One must give this place a try.

Well, we were having cravings for steak so decided try this place out. It was completely empty on a Monday evening. The decor was basic. Nothing extraordinary. The only good thing was the view we were getting from the glass ceilings. Then comes the food. We ordered peri peri skewers,paan Mojito, stuffed chicken steak and Mutton Lasagna. Peri peri skewers were superb and the best one. It was very yummy 😁 Paan Mojito was good too. But the steak wasn't good enough. It was dry and hard.😣 And the mutton Lasagna was okayish. There was only a single layer of cheese which was disappointing. 😓
The portions were very less. So less that after having all this,our stomach wasnt totally full  😐
The waiters were cordial enough. 😊
Now  when the bill came it was more than 1k. So cost for 2 is definitely not 650. 
It wasn't a complete happy visit for me.

This place is very diner-like in its decor and I liked the insides.The food here was not up to the mark though.The portions of the Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken Cheese Burst Burger were very small compared to the pricing and the taste was well, okay, not something to talk home about.The best and only good part about this place(apart from the decor) were the beverages.Both the Kiwi Soda Fizzy and the Brownie Shake tasted great and were quite good on the portions too.All in all, it is an alright place, not freakishly bad nor charmingly good.

I visited this place a number of times. This is a small joint serving really good continental food. 
Their Chicken Stroganoff is a must try! The herb rice and the chicken in white sauce is delicious.
They made me love pastas, which I was not quite fond of before. The creamy white sauced, Alfredo Pasta and the green, slightly spicy, Pesto Cream Pasta are really good, I simply love them. 
Their steaks are good but not extraordinary.
We were disappointed with their Shepard's Pie and Chicken Lasagna. I hope they will improve them. 
Tried Margarita Mojito, Blue Lagoon and Fresh Lime Soda, all of them were quite nice. 
We once ordered Brownie cake from the desserts section, but they served us a Brownie Frappe which was too sweet. 
The ambience is bright and colourful. 
The price is reasonable. 
If you are in for continental food, do visit this place!

16th May 2017 - My first visit here with friends. This is a very decent neat and clean place with an awesome ambience for the live tv and pleasant background music running all the time. Coming to food we have mozeralla chesse sticks as starter, classic chicken steak in BBQ sauce and one veg cheese burst burger. Food was awesome specially the mozeralla chesse sticks. My first impression here was great. Definitely visiting again.

Conveniently located opposite to La Martiniere, Deli Cravings is easy to spot. A steep flight of stairs will take you to the dining hall which is well-lit and has a TV screen. 

For starters we ordered  Red Pepper Chicken  and for drinks we ordered 1 Virgin Mojito 1 Margarita mojito and one black Mojito. For main course we ordered two chicken steaks, one with pepper sauce and another with BBQ sauce. 

The drinks were extremely nice full of basil leaves. The black Mojito was essentially a Virgin Mojito with coke instead of Sprite. However, the quantity of the drinks left us wanting for more. 

As for the main course the steak sauce was absolutely brilliant but one of the Steaks was chewy and dry. It was probably overcooked or was on heat for too long. It's a shame really, because that pepper sauce and bbq sauce was one of the best I have ever had. The mashed potato and the veggies that came with it was perfectly seasoned and not bland, unlike the ones most of the eateries serve. 

The red pepper chicken was spicy and is excellent for starter, but we would have loved to see a mint dip with it. 

For dessert, we had chocolate fondant. It is fancy name for molten chocolate cake or Choco Lava cake. The cake comes freshly made, straight out of the oven, warm and decadent with a scoop of ice-cream. It was really delicious and made for a wonderful end to dinner. 

The bill for a starter,  2 steaks, 4 drinks and a dessert came to 1400, which, given the flavor of the food, is worth it. The only gripe is the dryness of the chewy steaks, which really frustrates me because that sauce was overwhelmingly flavorful. Had that steak been perfect, I would have rated them 5/5.

The staff were courteous and the service was prompt.

I had the veggie steak here expecting a regular steak, sauce, veggies and rice. This version was missing most of those elements. The steak was a deep fried potato patty. There was a small serving of veggies. No sauce or rice to be found. It made for an unbalanced dish and was unsurprisingly, not satisfying.

The split banana and caramel dessert was an unmitigated disaster. The less said about it, the better. It made no sense as a concept and frankly looked terrible and tasted worse.  

What I can give credit for is the very good service. I used their wifi, shifted tables, worked for nearly an hour and there was no fuss.

Ordered a margarita pizza from Deli Cravings after reading some really good reviews about the place. Though the thin crust pizza looked good but I don't think that I can say the same about the taste, it was just average. Though I might taste other pizzas from their menu before coming down to any conclusion.

Most of the time, when you talk of a good restaurant you are talking about  a couple of signature dishes that made your day. The long list of kolkata must visit restaurants and pubs thrive on one dish maybe two. In fact I know of a pub in park street that serves the best ala kiev you will have ever had- their steak on the other hand is worth flossing with. So it is a genuine delight when you find a restaurant that can boast of ALL excellent dishes. It would be a waste of time to go through the menu one dish at a time. The dish I vote for as the sunflower among bright roses is the chicken roulade with beetroot sauce. It is a truly innovative dish- the roulade is stuffed with spinach and the sauce is both delicious are -for the lack of a better term- eye candy. Try the innovative drinks like the paan mojito. Take the lemon salad with a mild inflection on bitters (brilliant choice chef!) Try the fried fish or the fish in filo. Flaky, fluffy- divine! I will take my time with the menu, so should you.

I visited this place on a Saturday morning with my so called date 😅. He suggested this place and to be honest this place is a gem. The ambience is quite cosy and comfortable. The staff members are quite courteous and well behaved. The service is a bit slow though. But then it gives you time to enjoy the food and the ambience. They play good music. Although I haven't found any reason for them to keep the TV on without sound.
We had ordered Mexican Cheese Fries, Mexican Chicken Skewers, Piri Piri Fish Skewers, Stuffed Chicken Steak, Grilled Fish with Mango Chili Sauce and Nutella Crepe. Every item was well cooked and delicious. However I couldn't eat the Fish Skewers as it was a bit too fishy. The dessert was to kill for, honesty.
It is a nice place to visit with anybody. Friends or family or a date. Give it a visit. It is a bit expensive but the food is worth it.

A scorching summer and a craving stomach...does not go hand in hand. But for a food lover, craving for the food is the only thing that matter. So giving a damn to d burning 38 degree heat in which the sun is roasting the city... I went out for another food expedition to this newly found spot,courtesy zomato.

Located on d busy ajc Bose road beneath the flyover ..dis little food joint is easy to spot. On d first look it seems nothing special. Even when u climb up dose stairs to the dining area above,the decor fails to amaze u. But when it comes to the food, it surely greets u with a pleasant surprise!
  We were two people, we ordered bar-b-q chicken wings,Caesar salad with Chicken, shepherd's pie and for the drink, green Hawaiian mocktail and pain mojito in d first go.
Caesar salad was simply OK. Not bad but nothing special of it to be mentioned . Rather I found it to be a little too salty.  Barbecue chicken wings were crisp and tangy outside and juicy inside . Loved it. Shepherd s pie was a new dish for us...loved it thoroughly. The minced mutton in d bottom of the pan and covered with creamy cheese..yum. pan mojito was a very interesting Mocktail... the shredded betel leaves adds a very different taste to d simple mojito...though i personally believe that some alcohol would have made it more charming...after all ,being virgin is not so cool u know! B)
 Delighted by the dishes..we also ordered for a Mexican pizza.. though a bit spicy the crust was thin and crisp and toppings were perfect. Ten on ten!
 The stuffs are very courteous and smiling.. service is a bit slow but not complaining on that. But yah,management should  think about the decor.it's very ordinary for such a place that serves so good food,not to mention at so reasonable prices.
Nice experience guys! Would definitely like to come back very soon with a big gang!
Cheers and happy eating!😄😄😊😋

So i went this place as i was staying at parkprime and its located next to it. I ordered a veg falafal and tea. Falafal was just perfect in taste and completely value for money. I would say i havent ate falafal which was so well made in a long long time, tea was nice just may be if cups handles would have have been little bigger would have been great, as it was difficult to hold the cup when tea was hot.

I have eaten here several times. The taste quality and quantities served are great. The very fact that they have catered to a poor-continental-loving crowd makes them not only loved by many but also finds a lot of school and college goers daily.

I have personally liked the tandoori chicken steak. Its a immensely thoughtful and successful experiment of fusion. Apart form that they have kicked off with a great hospitality. Their manager somehow takes personal interest in every table multiple times and we seldom find anything to complain about.

These day I go there just to soak the cozy cool sitout a burger and some chilled mocktails in the mornings to start the day afresh.

on 13th April 2017. We visited this restaurant. 
There we ordered Expresso Chicken Steak, Black Currant mocktail and Oreo shake. 
So, the food explained the experience of having good food. Oreo shake was a bit bland look but who cares if it feels so good to taste. and then comes the garnishment of black currant mocktail on a small pretty whiskey glass with  pudina leaves.💕
Expresso Chicken steak was wonderful with mexican rice and grilled chicken. 
Thank You Deli Cravings​ for serving such delicious food and well the service was good too 💕

So i went this place as i was staying at parkprime and its located next to it. I ordered a veg falafal and tea. Falafal was just perfect in taste and completely value for money. I would say i havent ate falafal which was so well made in a long long time, tea was nice just may be if cups handles would have have been little bigger would have been great, as it was difficult to hold the cup when tea was hot.

I have eaten here several times. The taste quality and quantities served are great. The very fact that they have catered to a poor-continental-loving crowd makes them not only loved by many but also finds a lot of school and college goers daily.

I have personally liked the tandoori chicken steak. Its a immensely thoughtful and successful experiment of fusion. Apart form that they have kicked off with a great hospitality. Their manager somehow takes personal interest in every table multiple times and we seldom find anything to complain about.

These day I go there just to soak the cozy cool sitout a burger and some chilled mocktails in the mornings to start the day afresh.

on 13th April 2017. We visited this restaurant. 
There we ordered Expresso Chicken Steak, Black Currant mocktail and Oreo shake. 
So, the food explained the experience of having good food. Oreo shake was a bit bland look but who cares if it feels so good to taste. and then comes the garnishment of black currant mocktail on a small pretty whiskey glass with  pudina leaves.💕
Expresso Chicken steak was wonderful with mexican rice and grilled chicken. 
Thank You Deli Cravings​ for serving such delicious food and well the service was good too 💕

Always on the lookout for new places serving good food at reasonable prices, we came across Deli Cravings at Minto Park. A perfect place to hang out and grab a bite with friends. The restaurant is situated just opposite to La Martiniere for Boys and is easy to locate. The ambience is nice and calm, decorations simple and seating arrangements quite comfy. Now coming to the food, we ordered Loaded Chicken Nachos and Mexican Chicken skewers, both of which tasted fantastic. Loved the spicy marinade on the skewers and tangy salsa on the nachos. For main course we got Grilled fish with Lemon caper sauce, Barbeque Chicken skewers and Chicken Lasagne. While we were disappointed with the first two dishes- the fish was well cooked but way too salty and the sauce too sweet for the sizzlers, the wonderful lasagne more than made up for it. The meal ended on a sweet note with the mindblowingly good Chocolate fondant which we reordered because you can never have enough of chocolate! 

We also had Black mojito, Green apple mojito and Mango and orange soda to go with the meal. They were quite nicely prepared, could do less with the crushed basil though. 

The service was very good and courteous. They helped by giving some recommendations and made the experience much more enjoyable. Would definitely visit again!

Quite a good place to hang out with friends on weekends as stress busters, with some soul nourishing food! Decent ambience, though service is a bit delayed, yet within the reach of ur pocket. We had the following:

#peri peri fish skewers- fish rolls rolled in skewers tossed in hot n spicy black periperi sauce that tasted really good.

#shepherd's pie- the curried minced mutton layered with cheese n baked till perfection is just awesome in taste n flavoured with Italian herbs.

#Alfredo chicken pasta- a white cheesy gravy in pasta with veggies n chopped grilled chicken over the mix. Herbs adds flavour n topped with cheese n baked till perfection.

#chicken barbeque sizzler- chicken breast grilled with veggies, rice n barbeque gravy with sizzling sizzles makes u give a wide grin on ur face of happiness!

#paan mohito- cool mohito with crushed masala paan gives u the unique flavor that will sooth ur mind cool ur soul..

Overall, it's a good to go with place with decent quality food.

It is situated right opposite to La Martiniere for Boys and therefore easy to locate. It had a very friendly Ambience and the view was very good indeed. We started with the watermelon mojito and the Blueberry Mojito. The watermelon mojito was good but the Blueberry mojito tasted like cough syrup, so we didn't like it. Then we ordered for the mushroom appetizers which were very well made. For the main course we had pasta with arabiata sauce.However for the price they were charging ,the quantity was very small. For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake which was given along with ice cream. The chocolate brownie that we ordered was made in a fashion of the chocolate Lava cake so it wasn't actually a brownie. But this was very nicely made. We didn't have to wait long enough for a food to arrive and the waiters were also very courteous.

Pathetic place, waiters are very unprofessional and quality of food is very compromising. On giving feedback the representative gave lame excuses.
We ordered​ cheese garlic bread which merely had a flavour of garlic. On reading reviews on Zomato we tried paan mojito which tasted very refreshing but then that drink seemed very complicated to drink as they provided us with thin straw and thick straw was not available. In main course they suggested us cottage cheese platter which was another blunder. Quantity was very little which was good because the quality and taste was very bad.
It was just, time pathetically wasted.

I believe Deli cravings is one of a budget restaurant in kolkata for students. Situated near Minto park, it is really close to the busy streets so the view from the restaurant is not very pleasant. However, the food is really good. The place was really vacant when we arrived there at around 8, we were the only customers there. The service was nice and prompt. For drinks we ordered for fresh lime soda, americano and kit Kat shake. For food we ordered Caesar salad with chicken, Hawaiian sandwich and chicken cheese burger add on mushroom and coleslaw. Good was really good and it was cheap too. Total came around rs922 for three. Recommended.

There are a few places where you get good continental foods at great prices. Well luckily I have THE ONE! A cosy joint at deli cravings tick all the right boxes. Though a bit low in the decor department it makes up for this shortcoming with really good food. I tried their Hawaiian veg salad, tandoori steak and grilled fish with mango sauce. I absolutely loved the grilled fish. Not all places can get your fish right. But this place just nailed it. A great place for an amazing food. And of course the staff is very courteous and efficient. Extra brownie points for that!

I ordered a starter n pizza from this restaurant. The starter was stuffed mushrooms which lacked proper seasoning. Order a chef special veg pizza which was highly disappointing. The base was stale, had to throw away the entire pizza after having a bite. Apparently it was a thin crust pizza....Which was only crispy on the outer edge. The base towards the center was soft like a thick chapati. Hv never eaten such pizza in life.

May be the restaurant does not treat the home delivery orders on the same lines like the walk-in customer.

First things first, I ordered for home delivery and it arrived in 25 minutes flat at Ballygunge 👌I ordered the chicken steak burger, chicken stroganoff & Nutella crepe. The burger was juicy and very fulfilling, the stroganoff very good as well though the quantity of rice was a little less. The crepe was a real downer as it was made with chocolate sauce instead of Nutella 😭 Negative points for that...

Located just opposite La Martinere for Boys,this space is quite easy to locate. Coming to food, we had classic chicken steak, which was perfectly cooked and Greek salad which was too sauted to perfection. The service was real quick. The ambience is quite chilled out. The perfect place for your brunch venue.
The staff out there is quite warm and friendly.
Just be careful with your pocket, a bit heavy on this side!

I visited Deli Cravings today for a small bite as we were passing Minto Park. The place hosts a few tables on the first floor with a glass window overlooking La Martinere and AJC Bose Road. We had ordered for Mozzarella Sticks and Cheese Burst Lamb burger. The sticks were decent, rich and creamy inside and complete with the sweet and spicy sauce served with it. However,  the burger was a let down as it tasted just about average. It was nothing close to what a cheese burst should be. The menu also has many options in pastas and other continental and few Mexican cuisines. Overall a decent place. Pricing is moderately on the higher side. The staff is courteous and the service pretty quick.

Ambience: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Affordability: 5/5
Complementary: Garlic Bread

The highlight for me at this place was the very courteous staff who not only helped me around with menu but also signed me up for a loyalty program thereby getting me a free Garlic Bread.

We ordered a White Sauce Penné Pasta: very appetising and tasteful.
The free Garlic Bread was decent.
The Kit Kat shake we ordered was something i would recommend at this place. They were hospital enough to get the shake a 1/2. (Much appreciated btw)
But the let down for me was Pizza Mexicana, the thin crust was quite soggy and pretty bland in taste.

They did ask for our feedback and agreed to work better on it.
Definitely looking forward to getting back here, super affordable for a good after-college hangout with good food.

Deli Cravings is very easy to locate, right beside the United Bank of India bus stop, opposite the La Martinere for Boys school at Minto Park.
They serve wonderful continental dishes at moderate price. Seating arrangement is simple, beside a glass window overlooking the La Marts grounds and a busy AJC Bose road.
We ordered:
STARTERS--> ◽Chicken balls in ogliolio dip (8 balls, but too small, seriously!!)◽Mexican Chicken skewers (5 small pieces, but very tasty)
MAIN COURSE-->◽Tandoori Chicken Steak (3 thinly sliced pieces of grilled chicken, with gravy potato and fried lady's fingers)◽Classic Chicken Steak (2 wholesome chicken breasts, in BBQ sauce, with mashed potato and grilled vegetables)◽Grilled fish in Mango Chilli sauce (3 thick and large fillets of bassa fish, with rice and spinach, great quantity)
DESSERT--> 
◽Chocolate Fondant (best of the lot, hot liquid chocolate inside brownie, with vanilla)
Overall, it was a nice eating experience, quantity should be increased per serving, going by the prices they charge.

Ok lets talk about the food. We ordered  fish in mango sauce, was good. And classic chicken steak was also a good one but i liked the chicken dish more.. In other hands my friend liked the fish dish more. Well its depending upon person to person. At the end its a budget friendly place which u must try..

Deli Cravings  makes you crave for more.Starting with mozzarella sticks to Mexican chicken skewers...enough to arouse taste buds. Moving on to   D Bomb Chicken burger.... it was a double patty burger which could have used a little more cheese. Nonetheless it was tasty enough. Pasta Alfredo was adequately cheesy with a sumptuous helping of chicken. Last but not the least, the chocolate fondant stole our heart....hot chocolate oozing out of a perfectly baked cake coupled with vanilla icecream. In a nutshell, a cosy setup which provides you with yummilicious food at reasonable price

I ordered takeaway from Zomato from this place today as I was craving Stroganoff. The order was delivered within 15 mins sharp from Minto Park to Ballygunj, which is commendable! The chicken Stroganoff was creamy and full of peppers and came with a bed of herb rice, perfectly cooked, buttery and very light. I loved it, only thing quantity should have been more, but since it was all cheese, which is filing, so I don't mind.

Pretty costly but very good food. 

Located on a prominent spot, this place offers very delicious American and Continental food. The ambience is simple and soothing and very pleasing. Service was also very good. 

We ordered Tomato and Basil soup to start, which was very delicious and amazing. Starter was Red Pepper Chicken which was spicy as I like but the quantity was less. 
Main dishes we had were Veggie Cheese Burst Burger and Mutton Steak. The steak was good but the Burger was amazing. Delicious, juicy, cheesy and rightly spicy. Loved it. 

The bill came to around ₹600 but the tax of 20% took it to around ₹800. So, VFM is not so great, I would say.

Nothing great about the ambience with loys of vinyl funny paintings on the wall. Ordered cream of mushroom soup and a lamb cheese burster burger for take away. The soup tasted yummy and though the burger lamb patty was stuffed with meat only but overdone with too much of dry herbs. Price is very pocket friendly.

Today was my second visit to this restaurant. I ordered chicken mexican salad, red pepper chicken, chefs choice non veg pizza and chocolate fondant. I didnot like the red pepper chicken..... It was oily and not anything special. And the amount was very small. But the other dishes were excellent. The salad was perfect. The pizza was small, but it costed only 200 rupees, so I can't complain. Fondant was great too. 
We visited this restaurant about 5 months ago once. The peri peri fish skewers was great. And the steak was also really good. The prices are comparatively cheaper. 
Apart from food, the ambience is okish, the view of the road is good. Musics played are bad....really. Overall it was a good experience and I look forward to taste their other dishes like stroganoff.

If anyone is CRAVING for some change in their taste buds i will recommend this place.
Located just opposite of La Martiniere School for boys. The fooding area is in the first floor housed with some cool graffiti and the view of the busy road outside.
To be served we ordered
1. Red Hawaiian: a mocktail of 3 juices namely watermelon, lime & orange refreshing to start with.
2. Chicken Roulade: the most eye catching dish of the menu, rice & stuffed diced chicken served in a pink beetroot sauce.
3. Stroganoff: for me this tasted the best of all we tried, the white mushroom sauce immersed my mouth & crave for more.
4. Mexican Hot Pot: a very spicy dish those who can eat spices should go for it otherwise not.
5. Chocolate Fondant: liquid chocolate inside the hot brownie sided with a scoop of ice cream worth to be tried at the very last.
Overall a very good experience, don't go by zomato's info of pocket pinch, it is somewhere around 1k for two. Staffs are very friendly & are at your service all time. The rating would have been 5 out of 5 but the food portion to price ratio was a lil disappointing. Worth visiting atleast once.

The stuffed Chicken steak and creme pasta are a delight.

Order chicken lasagna, chicken cheese burst burger and classic steak. The burger was amazing full marks to that. Lasagna felt too cheesy still it was very decent and steak was not so well done. The meat was very chewy and kinda felt it should have been roasted more. 
It's pocket friendly, a must try for all the students who are on a budget and looking for continental food.

Great food and good price.
Was in my bucket list for a while,
Tried, classic chicken steak with mushroom sauce. The sauce was so good, that my friend and I fought over who shall finish it up. First time, I saw steak with the bones. Which was a negative point. Otherwise, the dish is great. Next, Mexican item, Mexican hot pot, the rice itself was delicious, the chicken on the side had a great cook, so did the tomato based gravy. And the best part of the meal. Desert.
Usually, people dont order desert. But, the chocolate fondant was so damn delicious. We ordered two after that.The moment you tear the outer layer. Warm chocolate comes out. Which is absolute pure heaven . If there's one thing I shall always come back for is the food. Service is a bit slow. The high rating is for that excellent fondant.

We went to Deli Cravings for a late lunch/early dinner or whatever those super heavy and super awesome 5 pm meals are :p The space in the ground floor is quite small, but the floor upstairs is spacious. The ambience was just perfect, with slight music and the live match screening. 

We ordered a Mexican Salad which was supposed to be "very very spicy", tasted pretty normal to me. Apart from that we had ordered Chicken steak, Gnocchi, Chocolate Fondant and two mojitos, Margarita and Black Current. 

Everything tasted amazing, especially the fondant! The service was prompt and total value for money.

After hearing some good words about this place I decided to step in one lazy Sunday afternoon for a light lunch. Interiors are pleasant. It's simplistic, nothing superfluous. The view from the giant glass wall makes all the difference.

Food is excellent and requires much accolade. Tried the fish and chips, veg ceasar salad , lemon iced tea and Darjeeling tea. The fish and chips were exquisite, both quality and taste were commendable. The veg ceasar salad was delightful with just the right combination of veggies, crouton and ceasar dressing. The Darjeeling tea was simple Earl Grey. The lemon iced tea came in a midsized glass. It was refreshing. The prices were cheap.

This dinner located right beside Chrome Hotel now renamed to Park Prime , near minto park is a must trt

It was my 1st visit to this place and i think I'm gonna go there some more! The food here tastes amazing. Brilliant dishes and well served. I don't remember the names the food we had there (LOL) but they were all beautifully made.

The place itself is very decent with all its decorated walls and the super nice comfortable seats. I loved them to.

I would recommend this place to all who would like to try out the Mexicanó style for a change!

was in the wishlist for a longtime and finally was able to get time on a quite lazy sunday afternoon after the pujas 2016 was over.... a nice location which is on the AJC BOSE road.... opposite LA Marts boys school and beside the chrome hotel.... we parked our motorbike right in front of the restaurant which is based on the 1st floor while the billing desk n kitchen is on the ground floor.... once you climb the stairs.... you come to the dining floor.... looks small on the onset but can comfortably seat 35+.... the seats are comfortable while the decor has a big graphity while everything else is kept simple,  the big window on one side overlooks the ajc bose road and looks serene.... 
coming to the food, we ordered the fish piri skewers... chicken stroganoff and fish in filo basket and nutella crepes for desserts..... let me quickly put the bottom line here...  the food is excellent.... no complains whatsoever....i gave a score of 5 even though there was a tiny hair in the fish dish but they took it away and replaced it.... the quantity might surprise some since its on the lower side but what makes the food so incredibly good is that every flavor can be distinctively felt.... the garlic,  the cream,  lemon,  mustard everything..... the staffs were courtious, and had an eye for detail.... the service was prompt and fast.... wat else can u ask for.... all the food was for exactly inr 800 while there was tax of around 180....overall a very satisfying experience and truly recommended.... all the best

My best friend and i went to this food station to have our lunch after some shopping. 

Location: this is just opposite to La Martiniere School for boys

Decoration:The place is decorated with funky graffiti on blue walls; 

Food: 
We ordered chicken arabbiata and chicken and chicken lasagna. Both of them were quitr good.

Chicken arabbiata- it was pasta with tomato sauce,corn and yellow and green zucchini. The taste of the sauce was good but somehow it wasnt perfect. 

Chicken lasagna- this particular dish was served with one garlic bread. It was very good. The balance of the flavour was spot on. It was too yummy. 

Desserts: 
We both ordered brownie a la mode. Both didnt love it. I have had better brownies. The brownie and the chocolate sauce was bitter and there was no sign of that smooth dense fudge which both of us expected. Wasnt satisfied at all with the brownie.

Service: Though the staffs were very gentle and helpful but thw service was very slow. They need to work on the service.

Overall i was satisfied with the main course but not with the desserts. I hope they work on the service and desserts.

Just as good food is a pre-requisite to all other factors that attributes a joint namely, ambience, decor,etc; similarly all these factors get marred if good food isn't one of them.
I have been procrastinating to write this review for so long, so here I am.
The location of this joint is so conspicuous, that even someone who sucks at directions can locate it out.
Just few kms from Minto Park towards Sealdah.
Climbing upstairs, we set out to the eatery section. Not highly spacious, yet not poky.
Has a funky vibe with all the wall paintings and furniture colour; glass panes facing the road adds to its fun. Specially when it rains, it's amazing.

Started with three Mojitos, other mocktails being unavailable that day: Virgin, Watermelon, Pineapple. Each had its unique refreshing taste, I'm thankful for that.
Now for solids, Caesar Salad with chicken toppings, well dressed and throws light taste.
Mexican Chicken Skewers was beautifully marinated and made our taste buds happy, though the chicken could have been a bit tender.
Classic Chicken Steak in BBQ Sauce was a bliss. The strong flavour of carefully grilled chicken was complemented by the mellowness of mashed potato and sauted vegetables, it was revivifying.
Lastly, Chicken Lasagna, man indulge yourself in Cheese land. So richly creamy, each bite sends 'all smiles' stimuli to cerebrum. Garlic Bread should be added a few more. One doesn't suffice the content of Lasagne, at all.
Sadly we couldn't get any dessert, cause some staff went to serve a Banquet Party. Never mind, there's always a next time and I'll make sure of that. xD

At the end, such prices much wow.
The menu list is not much extravagant, but the most important thing is to fulfill the requirements of all the present dishes over there, instead of putting a lot of dishes and being unable to serve them or cook them properly. So it doesn't matter.
All these continental dishes made to near perfection, cause nothing is perfect you know, lol; and it doesn't even tax you much.
Long live you guys. Cheers!

√ ADDITION, Second Visit.
Yep thought I'd talk about some more times I've tried the other time.
Let's get to it.
Strawberry Blast as a mocktail wasn't bad at all. Blend of ice cream and soda frizzy was compatible. However, Classic Deli Lemonade was on a too sweet note.
Mexican Cheese Fries was bland and like regular fries with some corn-cheese gravy topping. Kind of a no-no from me.
Piri-Piri Fish Skewers was tangy, sweet and spicy. Then admix wasn't incongruous, really well done.
Tandoori Chicken Steak, though lacklustre compared to Classic Chicken Steak I've had last time, yet managed to be the best of the three dishes this time. Was served with dressed potato and crispy paper-thin okra fries.

Heard there would be an expand in their menu with the inclusion of Sizzlers. Keen on trying that out.
Keep on making good food!

Food isn't that great and I felt the price should hv been lower given the quantity they serve nd d ambience of d place. Located next to the lane that leads to jdbi so I think they should exploit this opportunity and open the restaurant earlier than 11 o clock..since d college opens at 7 and d students require a place Tht is near to college nd opens early.

Zomato says a meal for 2 people at Deli Cravings will cost approx Rs.650. Well I beg to differ. A wholesome filling meal (lunch/ dinner) for 2 will cost around Rs.1100 (including taxes).

Location: Minto Park. Opposite to La Marts Boys School.
The restaurant is on the 1st floor and the kitchen is on the ground floor.

Service: Good. Staff is polite and courteous.

Food: We ordered Mexican Chicken Skewers and Piri Piri Fish Skewers for starters. 1st one was okayish.The fish skewers tasted good & literally melted in the mouth.

For Main Course we ordered Chicken Roulade, FishnChips and Grilled Fish in Mango Chilli Sauce. Chicken Roulade was not available.
FishnChips was served with french fries and 2 different dips. This dish tasted slightly better than average.
Grilled Fish in Mango Chilli Sauce was great. Though the hint of chilli was missing nevertheless the herb rice along with the fish tasted really good.

Price & Portion: At a glance the price may seem cheap, however the quantity of the starters will definitely make you feel that the prices should've been cheaper.
Poor portion sizes of the starters will disappoint you.
Quantity of the main course dishes: Good.

Recommended.

Deli Cravings occupies a prime position, literally! Situated just beside Park Prime, Minto Park locating is a child's play. Went there on a Sunday evening to satisfy the growing need of continental cravings along with a few friends and it turned out to be a pleasant experience.
We had ordered chicken loaded Nachos for starters and the mains consisted ofChicken Stroganoff(my favv), Mexican Hot Pot and a Cordon Blue Mutton ( don't know why I did that!). I can't find anything faulty with Stroganoff because of my biasness towards it and here was no exception. The hot pot was spicy with generous chunks of chicken among veggies accompanying it.
To cool off we had a Choco Shake which had a scoop of Ice cream to go with each. The prices are pocket friendly and ambience is pretty good too, though we did not get the prime seats. An interactive owner, who asked for a feedback and I only had positive things to say. The only thing that left me a tad disappointed, was the quantity of the portions served. Being a vociferous eater, they we minuscule with respect to me.
Nevertheless, great value for money and will visit again!! 😊

I am simply moved by the hospitality of the staff and by the wonderful taste of the food they serve. They guided us about the selection and starting from mexican chicken skewers to nutela crepe we just got indulged in the delicious food deep down. My personal favorite is grilled fish with mango chilli sauce and the brownie a la mode. I am looking forward to  visit the place again in near future. 
In a nutshell, fantastic food at reasonable price!

A beautifully decorated, clean restaurant which serves u with amazing continental and mexican food.. my experience was really very nice.. today. Me and a friend , after listening a lot about them went to this restaurant with the hope of getting our taste buds satisfied.. and yes! It did its work pretty well.. the interior was extremely catchy with good staffs helping us out with our food... now, coming to food. The foods that we ordered were
1) mexican chicken skewers as the starter
2) chicken stroganoff and
3) grilled fish with mango chilli sauce as the maincourse and
4) classic lemonade
Now, the chicken skewers were extremely tasty and the chicken was soft and juicy.. but the meal looked small and not appetizing as we were extremely hungry at that point of time. But the main course which was the stroganoff and the grilled fish were amazing. Both the dishes were very skillfully served on the plate.. not only that it tasted amazing.. the herby flavoured rice tasted amazingly well with the tangy mango gravy with a hint of chilli to satisfy the taste buds... the creamy chicken and mushroom broth was just amazing in the stroganoff. Both the dishes were properly cooked.. now coming to the mocktail.. it quite justified the cranberry flavour and went well with the dishes...
Overall, i had a nice experience and the foods are a must try.. really looking forward to this place.. well done guys!! :D

My nouveau tryst with continental,ushered me towards this eatery,roughly a 10 min walk from Ashok Hall.Right on the main road,to the right,if you're heading there from Exide,locating it was not an issue.
Decided to hook on to Piri Piri fish skewers for starters...and then went on to Pesto Chicken Risotto and Chicken Stroganoff. Skewers were quite appetizing,but the serving was meagre..
Risotto,simply bowled me over,its a must try from here...However, Stroganoff did not quite impress me,probably because i was still under the influence of that magical risotto..A quick tip,I'd suggest you don't go for risotto and Stroganoff simultaneously... Pocket pinch was moderate...will be back to try out their steak and Shepherd's Pie.

A good place to go for a weekday continental luncheon. Nice ambience with a street view of Kolkata . We decided to try the Pesto risotto and Chicken Stroganoff for main course and for starter the Piri Piri fish skew . The Risotto did all the magic for my continental craving taste bud . The Stroganoff had a lighter touch of spices as it should be.. Being a bong I could identify the perfect tenderness of the Fish skew . Added with good service it was a perfect lunch on the go..

The place has an average ambience. Service is good. We ordered classic chicken steak amd lamb cheese burst burger along with a choco frappe. The burger was ok....but nothing extraordinary. The classic steak was my order....and it was very salty and cheesy. It lacked oregano, basil, pepper or spice. I felt like the taste was wrong. And the chicken was stiff....could have been softened more. The mash potato had almost no seasoning.... I am not saying spices but not even the basic taste. I have had better mash potato. The choco frappe was good. Overall nothing really peaked our interest. Rather down on the spice end. Continental spices or mexican spice...whatever it is was missing. Not a very good place to lunch.

Chicken stroganoff was as usual creamy nd delicious
Chicken roulade. I thought beet root sauce won't be a good choice but later realized that this was the best dish among all at there.
Fish in mango sauce. Ordered 2 plates of this. It was good.
Bolognese was perfect.
Shepard's pie yummy..
Chicken skewers was also tasty.
Chef's special pizza. I liked the harissa side more.
Lamb something..cant recall the name exactly..it was so so..
Overall experience is good. The staffs are courteous as well.

This had been on my bucket list for quite sometime and Now, I can gladly say it is one of the best Continental eateries I have been to. We ordered a berry blast : a creamy cooler with crushed strawberries and a Classic Lemonade : a refreshing drink with the much loved cranberry juice and lime. We had a Piri Piri Fish skewers for starter and it was delicious. The small strips of fish was well cooked and melted as soon we put it our mouth. The piri piri sauce was too good.

We also had a cheesy Chicken Stroganoff : juicy chicken and mushroom served with herb rice, a crispy Fish and Chips with an awesome tartar dip and a very filling and lip-smacking Minced Mutton Steak.
The proportions were good and the quality of the food was great.
I will be back soon for more. Highly recommended to those who love continental food.

Situated just beside The Chrome Hotel, this is one hidden treasure. One of the best continental restaurants I've been to. We took two drinks. A creamy Berry Blast. And a classic Lemonade mocktail, a concoction of cranberry juice, lime and orange juice topped with ice chips. 
For starters, we took Piri Piri Fish Skewers, which were an absolute delight. The portions were a bit less, but the fish was melt-in-the-mouth. For main course, we took Fish and Chips, Minced Mutton steak and Chicken Stroganoff. The steak was very delicious and the fish dish was delectable. 
A nice Sunday Brunch, and cost-efficient.

This gem of a place has been long in our wish list. Finally we fulfilled our "deli cravings". Deli cravings serves great quality of continental and middle eastern delicacies at affordable price.
First of all we tried CHICKEN FALAFEL wrap which was superb in terms of both quality and quantity.
The CHICKEN STROGANOFF was out of the world. Tender chicken cubes and bell peppers were simmered in a cheesy and creamy sause..but not too over powering. The combination of the same with herbed rice was blissful to our palette.
PENNE ARRABBIATA was spicy and flavourful. But we will rate this dish slightly lower than the previous two.
The decor and the presentation was very good. Service is prompt and polite - gives a fine dinning experience.

Apart from the steak factory, I haven't had an appetising steak in a while. Deli cravings fulfilled this wish of mine. Located near La martinere for boys, this restaurant does justice to its name. Decked up and walls filled with relevant graffitis and enough to fit a swarm of teenagers. There is nothing extraordinary about this place still it manages to find a place in your heart. The décor is delightful and the food, exquisite. We ordered a stuffed chicken steak and a tandoori chicken steak. Well cooked and filling, stuffed one is not only delicious but filling too. The other one is delicious too. The soda fizz they have over there is nice but nothing to brag about. Coming to the dessert,  chocolate fondant, common yet beatific. Should visit this place and try out the aforementioned dishes as well as the ones in the menu.

Located at AJC Bose Road, this is a cute little place which serves mouth watering continental dishes .  The interior and decor are done in casual style with few seating arrangements.  After settling ourselves we ordered for Mexican Chicken Skewers, Tandoori Chicken Steak, Chicken Lasagna & Grilled Fish with Lemon Caper Sauce. The preparation of Mexican Chicken Skewers was done in the authentic style and was finger licking good. The Tandoori Chicken Steak was extremely flavourful and was on spicy side, which I loved to the core. It was served with veggies and mashed potato. The chicken was soft, perfectly marinated and cooked. The Chicken Lasagna could have been a bit better because being a cheese lover I expected it to be a little cheesier. But above all these the Grilled Fish topped the list. It was beautifully presented and was served with herb rice. The rice blended perfectly with the fish which was spicy, juicy and tempting. Will definitely revisit the place for this one. The staff was courteous and even the service was good.


Overall a nice compact economical place for a tasty meal!!

One of my favorite restaurant in Kolkata. The name of the restaurant is quite different. Staffs are very well behaved and very gentle. The interior is very cool and foody looking and the  music is very much relaxing. Now as for the food I already told that its one of my favorite restaurant.
I ordered a Classic Chicken Steak in Bar-b-q sauce. The taste is mouth warming,presentation is beautiful. It was served with Mashed potato and grilled beans. A chicken steak with a glass of virgin mojito from this restaurant will surely be remembered.

We ordered the chef's special pizza and the classic chicken steak. The prices are very reasonable and the quality of the food is good. Although I was not too impressed with the quantity. Also, they took a lot of cooking time which is unprecedented. If you are in minto park and looking for a place to drop in for a bite, this place is good enough.

The restaurant is located on the main road, right opposite La Marts Boys school, and is very easy to locate. The kitchen is in the ground floor, and the seating is in the floor above. It's quite spacious, and while one wall is decorated with funky paintings, the other wall is an extended window overlooking Loudon Street. The staff members are very attentive and well behaved. The food is quite good. The stroganoff was creamy and delicious, and didn't have the kind of monotony that most white cheese/cream/white sauce based dishes seem to have. The herb rice went nicely with it. The stuffed chicken was great, as well. The stuffing was quite good, though I would have liked it to taste a little more spinach-y, and a little more. The mashed potato it came with was very grainy, and the roasted beans were unseasoned. The meat itself was soft, juicy and plump - in a word, perfect! I also ordered an orange prawn dish for starter,but I was a little disappointed. For a starter, it had too much gravy. The prawns were too tiny and less in number. The general taste of the dish didn't have the orange flavour, but it was quite tasty. I particularly liked the fact that even though it was sweet, it was well balanced and not sugary. (I'm not too fond of sweetness in my dishes.) I sipped on a Green Hawaiian mocktail while waiting for the dishes to arrive, and it was full of different flavours. It was amazingly refreshing. Everything here is quite affordable, though the dishes were a little less in quantity, which was especially true in case of the chicken stroganoff and the chilli orange prawn. Altogether, I liked this place and would like to return.

Not very familiar with this side of town, I went there for a friend's birthday treat. We started with cheese balls and ordered the Classic Chicken Steak with mushroom sauce for the main course. The cheese balls very nice. Nothing special. The steak well cooked and the sauce complimented the meat well. The plating was impeccable. The place is definitely inexpensive and the food worth the while.

Service is satisfactory.We ordered chicken tacos,classic chicken steak,grilled fish in mango gravy,margarita mojito and strawberry soda. Chicken tacos were a disappointment since they didn't serve any dips with it,chicken was not soft,grilled fish was good though and so was the mojito.Soda was a massacre.overall an average experience

After a long hiatus , I am back with a review. This time for Deli Cravings at Minto Park. At last we friends got time in midst of our busy schedule of internship to hang out there. We ordered BBQ cottage cheese skewers,  Veg Pizza Al funghi,  Shepherd's pie in the non-vegetarian section and in the desert Chocolate fondant with vanilla ice cream. Shepherd's pie was good , so was the BBQ cottage cheese. Though I liked the dessert most. But pizza was disappointing. Nevertheless the place has a decent decor, nice view and reasonable price.

This pleasant little eatery located just opposite the LA Martniere Boys school in Minto park was in my bucket list for the longest time ever. And I finally checked it off today with my friend over lunch. This place is very apt for meet ups with friends, for students and for people who are ardent lovers of continental cuisine. 
We ordered for Blue Hawaiian for Mocktail. It's a very pretty mocktail as it comes in three layers. Though it can come off as too sweet but when mixed properly. It tastes pretty good.
For starters we got Piri Piri Fish Skewers. Though it was very well made in the tangy BBQ sauce, I'm a tad bit disappointed with the quantity. It comes in little portions and is really small in size.
However the main course was lip smacking and a complete delight to the taste buds. We ordered for Chicken Roulade and Shepherd's Pie.
Chicken roulade: The chicken Roulade was absolutely brilliant. Special mention goes to the beatroot sauce with which it was garnished. It was yummy. The spinach and corn stuffing  inside the chicken tasted brilliant.
Shepherds Pie: Again a little disappointed with the quantity. Could have been a little more. But very tasty nevertheless. It is served with one slice of garlic bread and the mashed potato layer and the meat layer complemented each other.
Now comes the best part of my meal. The Nutella Crepe which we ordered for desserts. The nutella and banana slices inside the crepe tasted like heaven. It's a must have totally.
The servers are very well behaved and polite and very helpful in selecting the right dish. We were also told that a lot of new delicacies like Lasagne,Risotto are going to get added to the menu. So very looking forward to that.
All in all, this place is a must visit for every food lover because it serves delicious continental food at very moderate prices.

This place is apt for students and casual meetups. They have Wifi service which is always nice. It is located just beside the road and is easily accessible which is also a plus.
The ambience is standard for a small restaurant and this place is not expensive which makes it even more attractive.
Coming to the food, We ordered-
Mexican Chicken Skewers- Really tasty, tender and well cooked meat.
PiriPiri Fish Skewers- Well cooked and tender but I felt the sauce it was cooked in was taken to far leaving a bitter aftertaste.
Classic Chicken Steak- Cooked well, tasty bbq sauce, generously served sides
Harissa Pizza- Would have liked a larger sized pizza. But generous serving of toppings and thin crunchy crust which was delicious
Nutella Crepes- Crepes were nice but whatever was on it was not Nutella but Hershey's chocolate syrup. People of my age can very well tell the difference so it was a letdown.

Overall, a nice experience and good for quick bites.

The location is sound though amidst din of the city the place is a pleasure . The decor is very touching with an ambience to match it. It was Ananya's Prebirthday celebration. The waiters as reviewed are very helpful. We ordered some of the famous cuisines offered by the restaurant namely Classic Chicken Steak, Lamb Cordon Bleu, Minced Lamb Steak and Grilled Fish with Mango Chilli Sauce. The service was a bit slow, the only con i could notice apart from some foreign particle floating on Ananya's glass.
The amount was a bit less but I think the taste of the dishes speaks for it, judging quality over quantity. In a nutshell the meal was a fabulous one.

This one's not going to strike a chord if you're an admirer of cozy/stylized eateries with their ambiance-specific-music and pretty place settings, with ample light and drama. Nope. But if you love food and worship it for it's true worth (enough to not care too much about ambiance).. this place does far from disappoint. :P

Located right next to Park Prime Hotel, AJC Bose Road (opp. La Martiniere for Boys), Deli Cravings is pretty easy to locate. 

Coming to the food, the smoked tomato and basil soup seemed tangy and vibrant. The Caesar Salad with chicken toppings as add-on tasted creamy and delicious but seemed to be scant in Croutons (which I hear is an important ingredient for that dish). For the main course we had ordered a platter of Stroganoff and another of the Stuffed Chicken Steak. I'm a newbie with regards to Russian (or Brazilian?) Cuisine, but all I can say is the herb rice was light and seasoned well and the sauce was creamy with well cooked chunks of chicken and mushroom with every bite. The Stuffed Chicken Steak was tastier still, the slightly burnt juicy flavor worked well with mashed potatoes and sauteed beans. To wash it all down, a glass of chilled Virgin Mojito felt pleasant. 

If you are okay with simpleton eateries which dazzle you with their FOOD ONLY, Deli Cravings is a good place. It was a fine eat-out all in all, and for lovers of Continental Platters or relatively cheaper pocket pinches (not compensating on the taste), I would recommend this one!

If you prefer continental delicacies and are an ardent meat lover and desperately trying to avoid burning a hole in your pocket, look no further than this little eatery over at minto park right beside the Park Prime hotel ! We dropped by one evening, voraciously hungry (having skipped lunch) and straightaway ordered an assortment of dishes like cream of chicken soup, mozarella cheese sticks and mexican chicken skewers. More than the presentation, we were blown away by the taste! Our main course was even better, chicken roulade, lamb cordon bleu and chicken stroganoff. The chicken roulade had chicken legs stuffed with olives, corn and egg and served with sesame green beans and herb rice along with a tasty beetroot sauce that exploded into all kinds of deliciousness in our mouths. The lamb cordon bleu was deep fried and went along superbly with sauteed vegetables and mashed potato. The stroganoff was also a delight! Our only complaint was that they didnt have any options for desserts! They served us banana crepes with nutella but then again, you can never go wrong with that, so we polished off our plates within seconds! And best part is that the place is really pocket friendly! So next time you have any continental cravings, do visit this hidden gem of a place!

This place is located opposite la martiners boys school in minto park. It's a two storey building...and quite difficult to locate perhaps. The seating area is quite spacious .

Coming to the food, we ordered mozzarella cheese sticks for starters, a blue lagoon , blue Hawaiian, and for main course, one classic chicken steak in barbeque sauce and one fish in mango chilli sauce. 

First came the starter, and the quantity was disappointing to say the least. Though it tasted good , but we didn't expected it to be so less. 

Then came the coolers, which were okay.

But what damage the starters did , the main course made up for it. The chicken steak was really good . It came with mashed potatoes and sauted vegetables and both were nice. But the best part of the day was fish in mango chilli sauce. It was delicious. The sauce , the herb rice and the softness of the fish. It was the best dish of the day. Hope to come here again sometime.

P.S . The 0.5 deduction is only because of the quantity of the starter. It was really disappointing.

This place in one word is student's favorite. Located on the main road, this place is mainly a student's hub. I was there with two of my friends. What we ordered was fish in pepper sauce, lamb steak and bolognese spaghetti. The fish steak and the spaghetti no doubt very tasty and was worth the bucks, but the lamb steak despite being very tasty, was too less for one person. Service is extremely slow. I hope they really improve on that. Otherwise, this is one of my favourite steak places. :)

It's one of the cheapest cafes I've been in all of Kolkata despite being located in one of the most posh areas. The cafe is neat and the staff is extremely welcoming. Here, selective food dishes are good in terms of taste. For example, their burgers are great alongwith their steak platters. The stuffed chicken steak is a must have. The desserts suck, though.

The foodie that I am...I have followed this place right from the time the interiors were being done. Reason being it's proximity to my house.
And I was one of their first customers too.
Yesterday I was craving pizza and pasta when I ordered from deli cravings.

My favourites are the 
Yummy fries topped with cheese , salsa and baked beans.

The spaghetti alio olio topped with olives, cheese and sundries tomatoes and loads of garlic and herbs

And the al funghi pizza

The USP of this place is the quality of food they provide at totally pocket friendly prices.
Here you get pasta and pizza both at a price which we pay only for either of them in other cafes.

The food ordered was yummy and the way the order was handled was extremely pleasant.

Any of you out there looking for a quality place which is easy on the pocket, Deli Cravings is highly recommended.

Must try the Pesto preparations and desserts when you're here, they are mouth watering good. The prices are very reasonable but they should look more into the quantity of the cuisines. The waiters are courteous and very welcoming. Looking forward to drop in soon.

Location - Opposite to La Martinier boy's school. This joint has two floors where in the first floor they have the kitchen and in the second the seating arrangement. We went in there at around 5 in the evening for my sister's treat. It was almost vacant at that time.

Ambiance - Nothing extraordinary. It's good. The walls are painted with vibrant shades and the interior is well maintained. Music was not too loud.

Food - We ordered orange soda fizzy, Kiwi soda fizzy, berry blast mocktail, pink panther mocktail, brownie shake and creme frappe from the beverages sections. Among all of these berry blast was the best. For starters we had chicken skewers as this is one of the most reviewed item of theirs. For main course we ordered chicken mexican pizza and chicken harissa pizza. We wanted to order country fried chicken but that wasn't available. Pizzas were good but each took around 30mins to get delivered. Coming to the last section of desserts we ordered chocolate fondant and brownie a la mode. Chocolate fondant was superb.

Staff Management - Good.

Service - Late.

Pocket-pinch - Worth it.

Deli craving is a place that might not give a big impression to begin with, but definitely delights you with superb food at extremely affordable prices. 

Located near park prime hotel, restaurant has two floors, one is mainly the kitchen with the dining area above it. Decor is average. Small sofa sets are available to sit that are reasonably well spaced. Staff are warm and polite.

Coming to food, place serves continental, Mexican and fusion food with decent serving portions. I tried the spaghetti alio olio that was well made. BBQ cottage cheese skewers with Mexican rice was superb. Cottage cheese was well marinated and had lovely flavours. Mexican rice had a smokiness to it that made it really special. Loaded nachos was a disappointment. Nachos were flavoured that I din't like. It was bit clumsy and messed up with inadequate feta. Iced tea and other mocktail was nice.

Overall a definite bang for the buck for me.

After hearing a lot about Deli Cravings, I finally decided to try their steaks. Ordered a fish stake with pepper sauce which is not a part of their main menu but if you request they make the sauce of your choice. 
The fish was Basa and the quantity was much for one person. The sauce was good enough, neither too spicy nor too flat. The fish however, wasn't seasoned well. The herb rice that accompanied was flat, like it's supposed to be. The spinach, okay-ish. 
I loved the lamb stake my friend ordered better. Overall an average experience.

Two of us,went into deli cravings,for a late lunch.we had much time so we decided to take things slowly. The restora is very well And simply decorated. upstairs,the road facing seating arrangement made me happy.waiter came in,very polite and well mannered.
Now the main part,THE FOOD. One after another,we ordered-
1.chocolate shake.
2.loaded chicken nachos.
3.classic chicken steak with BBQ sauce.
4. Harissa pizza
5.Alfredo pasta(in white sauce).
6. Green apple soda.
Drinks were asusual and standard.
Nachos were crisp and tasteful.a value for money.
While the steak left me unsatisfied. The chicken was overdone( which should be soft) and BBQ Sauce was not Upto the mark. Not worth of ₹210. When we told that to the manager(probably),he apologised. Thin crust Harissa pizza was full of meat,we enjoyed the crispness of the pizza.
Pasta Alfredo was tasteful,penne pasta with white sauce gave our tongue a friendly call. Ended up with Green apple soda. All these made a bill of ₹1048.(including all taxes)

Zingara Peri Peri was one of my favourites. It's a thin crust pizza with minced mutton topping. It's quite tasty. The garlic bread was a pretty good too. The mocktails were also pretty good. They not only tasted good, they were quite good looking.

My friend suggested this place for lunch. We ordered classic chicken steak, lamb cordon bleu, and fish and chips. We also added French fries and potato skins. The meat was really cooked well, the lamb being the star. The steak had a buttery sauce with mushrooms which was delicious for me. The fish was nicely cooked and very light. The potato skins had a tangy center, which was a bit unexpected. It was really okay-ish. 
A bit of disappointment was the fact that the food arrived quite late. 
The decor is chic, the staff is friendly.
All in all, a nice and chic place to drop in for lunch if in the area.

Somehow I had great expectations from this place and it was a letdown. 
I went to this place yesterday. The décor was great with some really interesting graffiti. 
We had ordered Mozzarella Sticks, Mexican Chicken Skewers and Mexican Chicken Pizza. The mozzarella sticks were ordinary. But it was a good appetiser. The chicken skewers were a disappointment. Except for the fancy design, it had nothing to offer. The taste was bland and it tasted more like kebabs. More Indian than Mexican. The Mexican chicken pizza was the only good thing we had. A thin crust pizza with ample amount of toppings and just the right amount of jalapeño and cheese and lots of meat. The crust was a little hard towards the side, but that can be overlooked.
The staff is friendly and the service is quick. But the place isn't impressive enough to visit again.

Love this one! I have been here twice in the past week and I have had the Piri Piri Fish in the starters, and Stuffed Chicken Steak, Tandoori Chicken steak, Chicken Roulade , Lamb Cordon Bleu in the main course, and its really good. In the drinks section I have had cappucino and the Choco Frappe. They  were good too, but it was the main course that bowled me out. It may be a bit expensive, but it is worth it here.

Fantastic Food Joint. It is also in the meat cravings collection in zomato.
The ambiance has  got  an american touch too.
Special mention dishes are chicken skewers , stuffed chicken stake,  fish in mango chili sauce and prawn newburg.Prices are justified. Too much tasty food.

This is a sweet and quaint little place for continental / Mexican food at low prices! The best part of this restaurant is that one can taste a varsity of dishes because of the low price hence is suitable for college / school students with budget.
We had :
1. Stuffed mushroom - one of a kind and a must try for all mushroom lovers
2. Fish piri piri skewers - extremely soft and juicy fish with hint of spice and BBQ sauce. Try.
3. Chicken burger - nothing special
4. Classic chicken steak with mushroom sauce : mild flavourd . Good.
Service was extremely good and the staff were extremely polite...
Two thumbs up for this place which makes you visit again and again

I could have given this restaurant a complete 5 points for that I loved everything about it.
A normal yet perfect ambience with exceptionally humble service and the best continental food in the city. Hands down! You won't really get such sumptuous dishes in so low prices.
Started with Kiwi, We ordered #MexicanChickenSkewers, grilled strips of tender chicken in spicy Mexican Merinate,  in starter which was absolutely delightful.  Relished every single bite of #GrilledFishwithMangoChilliSauce, Pan grilled buttered fish with sauteed spinach and herb rice , #LambCordonBleu, Crumbed and golden fried lamb cutlet with cheese served with mashed potato and Sauteed Vegetables in the main course. Probably the best lamb preparation I have tasted till now.
And we ended our Cravings of sweet tooth by #ChocolateFondant, Classic chocolate cake with molten center . They took a little time to serve the dessert but it was worth the wait!   Once you visit this place, you will not stop going gaga about it, specially the food.

Nice ambiance, the staff was also nice. But the food was not at all good. Moreover, it was highly overpriced.The primary reason of me going here was because I wanted to taste pie, the kind you see in Hollywood movies being made at home or served in diners. Well, the Shepherd's pie was nothing like that. It was more like a monolayered lasagna- a layer of cheese on top with some keema type thing under. Tasted horrible. Ate it only because I paid 250 bucks + tax for it.My friend took a burger, which was surprisingly average, or a little below it. You can get better burgers at lesser prices.Enjoyed the mojitos though. A paan one for me and a green apple one for my friend.All in all, a bad experience. If I ever go back there, it would be only to try the steak.

This eatery is located at Minto Park, and one can easily reach this place availing the metro facility, as it is just a 10 minute walk from the exide gate of the Rabindra Sadan metro station. It is convenient to locate, and one can even avail buses or taxis if he/she doesn't wish to walk!

Coming to the ambience, it was nothing really special. They could possibly improve a bit on this. Also, the service was slow, but the staff members were very courteous.

So first, we ordered for Mexican Chicken Skewers and blue lagoon. The chicken was good, and it was served in a very stylish way, but we felt that the chicken could've been warmer than what it was. The mocktail was nice! The only problem was, that they added a lot of sugar in it, more than what was necessary.

Next we went for Grilled Fish with Mango Chilli Sauce and Virgin Pina Colada. The fish was just out of the world! It was delicately cooked, flooded with spices and flavours, and was very tender! It was served along with herb rice and spinach, which we think was absolutely average as compared to the fish. The mocktail this time was freakishly amazing. Moreover, the quantity of the mocktail was good, too.

We decided to wrap up our meal with a dessert, so we ordered for Chocolate Fondant. We were disappointed as it arrived 20 minutes after we ordered for it! Moreover, there was noone else in the restaurant apart from us, so there wasn't any reason for the unnecessary delay. Nevertheless, the dish tasted good!

Deli cravings is a place that has potential to improve. The food is good! And that's why these people need to work more on the finer details of dining. But overall, it was a good experience.

Happy eating!

Recommended dish - Grilled Fish with Mango Chilli Sauce

Recommended mocktail - Virgin Pina Colada

Located right on the AJC Bose Road near Minto Park, this place is very easy to find. The ambience is good with a 'clean' look and no unnecessary gimmicks. But the best thing about the place is the food. The Stroganoff was amazingly delicious and the Sheperd's Pie was heavenly. Overall, a gastronomic delight.

Deli cravings is one of the finest continental destination within your budget. After hearing and reading so much of mixed reviews about this place mostly very positive I wanted to visit them.

USP
-> Very pocket friendly

**Location**
Located just near the minto park crossing this place is situated beside the Chrome Hotel. You have to be very cautious specially if you are travelling with your car to this place because you can miss this place at a blink of an eye. Parking is an issue though you can park in front of the place after a certain time in the evening if you are lucky enough.

**Decor & Ambiance**
There is not much to say about the decor it is simple and straight. Normal tables and cubicle like furniture was too simple for a place like this. No such special ambiance to mention to be very specific. A huge room for improvement in this area.

**Food**
This is the area they really good at. I liked the fact that they serve you fresh food which is big turn on.
On my visit to this place tried the below mentioned:

Beverages
Cappuccino Coffee:
It was decent and met the expectations.

Green apple Mojito: Very refreshing and the flavors blended really well.. Liked it..

Tropical Blue: This drink is a layered drink which didn't taste that well when I took the first sip. But got used to it gradually.

Starters:
Mexican Chicken Skewers:
Presentation was really nice and the taste was just abt okay.. A decent one but I believe they have other special starters too.

Mains
Harrisa Pizza:
Pizza took a while but it was worth a wait it was good in taste. The thin crust pizza base got a little stiff but overall it was tangled my taste buds.

Grill fish with mango chilli sauce:
This one was delicious. I simply loved this one and the sauce was so good. Quality of the fish was excellent.
#MUST TRY

Non availability of my choice of dessert was a let down :( was expecting to try a dessert as well.
 
**Service**
The behavior of the people serving their was really commendable. They are extremely gentle and at your service everytime. Though may be a little training on the technical front would make this a lot better may be near to perfect.

A cosy and lovely restaurant.. Very easy to detect.. I went there with a friend who was totally in love with this place.. The food was tasty, well decorated.. The staffs were friendly and helpful. I loved the burger and the blue lagoon though i thought that it could have been sweeter but i think that's my ignorance.. My friend ordered the chicken steak which was tempting by looks and as u fulfill the temptation u will indulge yourself more.. The same for the chocolate fondate... It has so much calories but that allured me so much that later i felt guilty about it.. And thanx @siddhartha for his lovely pics

    Do visit this place if you're looking for a pocket friendly Italian Restautant!

Was interested in this resturant as the reviews and ratings are great.. Well, we ordered fish and chips, chef's special pizza..
The fish and chips was great, really liked it. But the pizza was not at all good. They kept us waiting for half an hour, which was okay, as we knew preparation takes time, but the saying "sabar ka phal meetha hota hay" went to garbage after seeing the result. Pizza was "papad bhaja" absolutely like eating a fried bread piece.. And ofcourse the drink black current was not as good as expected..

Situated beside the Chrome Hotel in Minto Park..this place is a absolute delight for people who craves continental cuisine. We had ordered pink panther and pinacolada mocktails with cheesy garlic bread and classic grill chicken with mushroom sauce -mashed potatoes and garlic sautéed veggies. Very impressed with the food quality, it was a pleasure to eat there. The mushroom sauce was very good and perfectly grilled chicken. Definitely will be going back soon.

After reading great reviews on Zomato we ordered food from here today and I am so glad that this did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered Veg Potato Skins, which was well made and the stuffing was yummy. We also ordered Stuffed Chicken Steak and Chicken Stroganoff. The stuffed chicken steak was awesome and each componen , the chicken, the filling, the mash, the sauce - was delicious. The stroganoff was equally good. Our total came to Rs. 700, which is quite reasonable. Overall I loved the food, its pocket-friendly and therefore its a must try.

Went for the second time today evening for some snack with my friend. The location is very prominent as it is just opposite to the Constantia building / La Martiniere School. Coming to the decor, it has a nice simplistic interior yet appealing. The television added to the entertainment which was missing during my first visit.
We had Hot and Sour soup, Mexican Chicken Pizza, Cold drinks and a mocktail called Blue Hawaii. The soup was brilliant and so was the mocktail. The pizza had a crust too thin to carry it over till the mouth ! Also, it was a tad more oily what I felt. 
Coming to the service, the manager of the upper floor where we sat was doing a brilliant job with his nice and tender attitude towards the guests and his as well as the other attendants' smile on the face was a real add on to the vibe of the restaurant, which uplifted my rating to 4.0. So kudos to the team. 
Last but not the least, talking about the pricing, it would simply not even feel a pinch even in the pocket as the restaurant what I believe primarily caters to the student mass and therefore brilliantly stategized their pricing to suit their client base's needs. So, all in all, I would definitely recommend this Deli and would crave for more and more new dishes to come up from their kitchen !

Brilliant food at very reasonable prices - this is what the place is about. I have totally fallen in love with this place. Located at minto park, this place is known for its ambiance though I didn't find any reason for that. The decor is quite ordinary with bright coloured graffiti on walls and decent seating arrangement. There's a large glass window wall through which you can have a view of the busy traffic and the La Martiniere for boys. Now enough of these less important things, let me hop straight to the subject of interest. We ordered :

#Margarita - Refreshing with tinge of tang

#Cravings lemonade - A flavourful punch of orange juice with classic lemonade.

#Classic chicken steak in bbq sauce - Looked mouth-watering, tasted delicious. Two medium sized chicken steak cooked beautifully in a sweet, smoky bbq sauce. They did total justice with the mashed potatoes and sauteed mini vegetables as well. 

#Mexican Chicken Hot Pot - Now this was the star of the show,a mexican stew served with mexican rice. An explosion of flavours at the very first morsel. The sweetness of the corn, the freshness of the veggies and chicken chunks with the tanginess of the lemon and mexican spices was a pleasure to my stomach as well as to my heart. 

This restaurant is definitely going on my list of favourites. Will surely gonna visit again !!

A very good food joint thats what come to my mind about this place. Thumbs up would be the fish dishes, they were so good, special mention goes to fish in Chilli mango sauce, a must try for all, rest of the food was also good, Thumbs down would be the constraints in menu card, when the foods are so good you tend to want more dishes in a menu, second one would be the mocktails, They didn't do justice to the food, well that can be pardoned off for the great food. Complaint would be they didn't put the barcelona vs granada match on the TV even after a request.

Ordered stuffed chicken steak, harissa pizza and hawaiian blue. The chicken steak was a chicken breast stuffed with a tangy spinach stuffing served with mushroom sauce, a very buttery mash and sesame green beans. Everything complements eachother. The pizza has thin and crispy crust and is topped with a special sauce which is unlike any other pizza sauces. The hawaiian blue is more appealing to the eyes than the taste buds. Its blue curacao with sprite topped with orange juice and hence the layers of colour.

A girl made a list comprising of restaurants she wanted to visit. Today was the day she chopped off one name from the list with a happy pleasing smile - Deli Cravings.

Known for its Ambience at Zomato, this place didn't impress much on that front though. Decent interior with perfect graffiti of animated foodies, a girl was a bit disappointed with the positioning of the sofas and the tables as it seemed far from each other making it almost difficult to relax with your back at the sofa and munching food from the table at the same time. Overall, ambience and seating was satisfactory.

Coming to the food, a girl ordered :--

1) Fresh Lime Soda Fizzy- It was cool & refreshing and a totally value for money stuff .
2) Tropical Blue Soda Fizzy- The flavour was a lil overpowering the drink, but it was refreshing also.
3) Mexican Chicken Skewers- It was spicy, the chicken had a whirlpool of flavours in it and it was brilliantly presented, but quantity served is very less. So it was kind of a necessary evil, good for the taste buds but bad for a tight pocket.
4)Chicken Cheese burst burger- Although i felt they could have given more mayo, still it was the best burger I have tasted till now. Served with French fries, the USP of the burger is its awesomely juicy and flavorful patty. One bite at the burger and you could feel a burst of flavors in your mouth. Loved it!!
5) Classic Chicken Steak in BBQ sauce- Undoubtedly, the best dish of today( hands down). The sauce was thick and creamy, the two big sized pieces of chicken steak was soft,well marinated and prepared, and it was served with delicious sauteed veggies along with mashed potato. Overall, a perfect main course dish which both satisfies your hunger and wallet.
§§ RATINGS TIME :
→ FOOD : 5/5
→ SERVICE : 4/5
→ AMBIENCE : 3/5
→ VFM : 5/5
To top it all, the service is excellent with really well behaved and courteous waiters.
Overall, a place where the tag of "value for money" is very well maintained in accordance with some brilliant continental food they have in offer.
Overall, a girl is impressed.
Hence, RECOMMENDED!!

This place made me happy. 

Deli Cravings isn't very difficult to find, right beside Chrome Hotel (that big hotel with port hole like windows) on AJC Bose Road, Minto Park. 

Once you enter, you are directed upstairs to a cosy eating space with comfortable sitting arrangement and quirky graffiti on a wall and a large glass window panel in the opposite. They do not clean the window pane well but nevertheless, it makes the place very well lit and bright. 

In a hot summer afternoon, I had found only about two other tables occupied which gave the place a quite ambience. Soft music in the background filled the silence. The place seemed to have a very calm and soothing atmosphere. 

Today was my first visit. I had read reviews about this place in Zomato and was curious to visit. 

Food was pretty much great. 
I had ordered :
•Cafe Frappe - Coffee blended with Ice Cream. Tasted like it should taste, that is, good. 

•Italian Ice Cream Soda - Watermelon juice with Passion Fruit syrup, some salty-sour masala and foam on top. The drink looked very refreshing but the flavour didn't go well for me, watermelon and passion fruit didn't seem to marry well. 

I must mention here that they actually have an appreciable variety of mocktails and beverages on their menu and the above drink was an order out of curiosity. It might have not panned out well for me but I'm still excited to try the other options, anyway !

•Spaghetti Bolognese - Spot on. Tangy, flavoursome Bolognese sauce with generous amount of lamb mince with properly cooked spaghetti pasta. A surprisingly delightful dish. 

•Chicken Cheeseburst Burger - I'm still having sweet dreams about this burger ! Okay so, no cheese had 'burst' out of the patty but the patty was a crispy fried piece of heaven with a succulent minced chicken inside, blended with cheese and a gorgeous combination of flavours. The mayo dressing complemented the flavours of the patty only too well. The burger buns were toasted crispy with butter on the outside and very fresh and soft inside. Overall, a very scrumptious burger that made me so very happy. :) 
The burger came with a good helping of fries on the side. 

Prices were much reasonable. The whole meal had cost about 600/- including all taxes. Considering the food that I was served and the happy feeling in my tummy, the bill didn't hurt my purse at all ! 

About service, it was quick enough. The waiter who served us was a soft spoken, polite and friendly soul but perhaps with a little lack of information about the menu. Also, I had put in some effort to explain to him what exactly a sunny side up was for an add on egg I wished to order with the burger. But he was very cooperative nonetheless and our experience was quite pleasant and hassle free.
 Over all, a great experience. I am much excited and is looking forward to plenty of revisits in the near future to try out every other goodie that they has to offer.

Honestly I had bookmarked this place after a lot of good feedback from my fellow foodies friends. Had the chance to visit it yesterday.
Located off minto park- sarat bose road ( pretty close to JD birla college lane) this restaurant has a very good location.
From the outside it resembled a diner look and feel. The restaurant is divided between two levels. The ground floor has the kitchen and drinks area and the seating is on the level above.
The interiors didn't please me at all but I ignored it since I was yet to tty the food.
The order was-
1) Mexican cheese fries
2) spinach, corn and olive pizza
3) veg steak

They got all the three dishes together! That was reason enough for me to feel absolutely disappointed!
You can't just get everything together.!
As a result the food got cold and I was honestly not finding the taste good.
The Mexican cheese fries wre nice to taste but well soggy fries isn't my thing.
The pizza was served without olives which they fixed later by just adding piec exes of olives on the prepared pizza! I didn't like the sauce of the pizza.
The veg steak was decent with the grilled veggies being the highlight but overall there was so sauce so balance the different textures in the dish. The salsa served no purpose and honestly was very less in quantity for two pieces of veg patty.
Despite my disappointed which I let them know.. They didn't honestly bother in making things right.

Overall a not so pleasant experience and I am certain that I will not return anytime soon.

Centrally located, cool interiors, friendly service, and a good array of choices. The first look will surely not disappoint you. For starters we had Mexican Chicken Skewers which was very soft and better than other Skewers I have had. For main course we had, Chef's Spcl Pizza and Grilled Fish with herbed rice. Both of them were really very very good with Pizza full of cheese and chicken and the Fish utterly soft. A must visit. Also, Chocolate Fondant for dessert is a must have.

We went to this place for desert one fine afternoon. The place is located near La Martiniere on the opposite footpath. Speaking of the ambience, a group of teens and pre-teens were ruling the place. They were extremely noisy and went on dropping cutlery and shouting, bringing the place down basically.
For a place known for it's "ambiance" according to Zomato, it was a big let down. We ordered a host of drinks, most of them pretty forgettable apart from the Mango Icy Blast which was basically flavoured crushed ice. Reminded us a lot of our school days spent eating Gola.  The drinks were each served at an interval of 10 minutes or more,which was really awkward for a big group like ours.
The Chocolate Fondant which is supposed to be a speciality did look nice at first glance. But a molten centre made of raw undercooked flour is not how you go about it.
Next we ordered a Pasta, just to get away from the sweet taste in our mouth. The spaghetti was not bad.
Lots of better options nearby.

It was an unplanned drop in to this place. Suddenly made up my mind to visit this place and i can say it loud that it was a good decesion made from my end to visit this amazing place.
Decor is very simple yet attractive; they have a nice range of food and drinks. I sarted with fresh lime soda which was made with correct balance of ingredients. Then my course included steak and it was just amazing... overall i enjoyed a lot and i am very excited to visit again. Infact i deliberately skiped the desert so tht th place drags me here again very soon out of curiosity to try th dishes i didnt taste yet.... 
It's a must visit place.

A near perfect gastronomic experience marred by a tiny glitch at the end. 
Deli Cravings have been on my wish list for a long time, especially because it serves good continental stuff at affordable prices. Super easy to locate, right beside Chrome Hotel at Minto Park. The actual dining is on the first floor and if you get a sit beside the window, you can enjoy views of the busy AJC Bose Road.
Anyway coming to the food, me and my mom ordered for a cream of chicken soup and Mexican Chicken skewers. My mother got a pina colada and me a green apple soda to go with the starters. The soup was brilliant. It was rich, smooth, creamy. The croutons added a dash of crunch to break in the creaminess of the soup. Amble amounts of chicken...ample amounts of white sauce...it was splendid. The skewers were spicy and the chicken was brilliantly done. The soda and the pina colada were both refreshing. 
The main course was chicken stroganoff and chicken steak in BBQ sauce. The stroganoff was nicely complimented with buttered rice, had good amounts of mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was very creamy, not watery like some eateries do to this classic dish. The steak was again brilliant. The bbq sauce had the ample amount of sweetness and zing and it complimented the creamy, cheesy taste of the stroganoff brilliantly. The chicken was grilled well, though I found it a bit hard..maybe a personal feeling!!!
The only downside was the chocolate fondant. It smelt of raw flour....it was a total disappointment. 
The service was excellent. The servers are doing a great job. The owner is a friendly young man and he took our feedback personally...he even apologised for the dessert. 
The best part...the pocket pinch...a full 4-course continental meal for two at only 1100 INR including taxes; I guess nothing can beat this one. If you are in this part of the town and craving for some continental food, drop in here....your stomach and your wallet will both be satiated.

Burger lovers THIS PLACE IS A MUST VISIT. 
One of my friends recommended me to go this place. Firstly I doubted but then I thanked him. 
I ordered pizza, French fries and mix pasta. 
Every item was extremely well presented. 
Taste seemed to be better with every bite.

Well! It's almost like my second home since it's just round the corner(of my college). To start with, I've literally lost count of the number of times I've been here. Yeah the food is that good! I just keep coming back. Have tried most from their main course menu. Absolute favorites are their thin crust pizzas, chicken steak in mushroom sauce & the good old fish & chips. And the best part? It's not even heavy on your pocket! 😁😁

After being bookmarked for do many days, finally checked this place out.
Smart interiors nd spacious ambience is a sure hit according to me.
We ordered Harissa Pizza, Bbq Chicken Steak and Chocolate Fondant with Mango Soda Fizzy and Kiwi Soda Fizzy.
Both the drinks were nice and refreshing, at the proper temperature.
The thin crust pizza was cheesy yet crunchy and the steak nicely cooked with the amazing sauce. But what really made my night was the oozy fondant with ice-cream.
Surely gonna go back and dig In to the rest of the menu.

I love deli cravings. The food is to die for. Truth be told I was a tad bit disappointed when they started charging taxes, but I suppose the food is worth it. As opposed to other restaurants in the city which serve continental food, DC is by far the most affordable and satisfying. Do stop by asap and try out the classic steak in a delicious bbq sauce coupled with a refreshing mojito. The three sauce pasta is very filling as well. There is honestly hardly anything on the menu which I haven't tried, whether it's the shepherd's pie, spaghetti, white sauce pasta, tandoori steak, pizza,crepes,kiwi soda drink etc. The variety in the menu will have you spoilt for choice.

Located right on road side .. heard a lot about this place.. finally dropped in today with a friend.. two storeyed .. ubercool grafitii.. basic interiors and sober staff.. food was quite good 
Ordered : 
 margharita pizza 
Chicken steak in bbq sauce 
Chocolate fondant
The pizza was thin crusted , moderate cheese and seasoning , good size , overall tasty
The steak was tender , properly cooked with mashed potato and sauted vegetables . The vegetables were though a bit overfried , tasted good.
The bbq sauce in my opinion should have been more 
The chocolate fondant was really good. Perfectly cooked with ample softness and gooiness with perfect chocolate sauce oozing out. The vanilla ice cream though could have been better. Very runny , and frothy . A thick , creamy vanilla ice cream of better quality would have gelled better 
Left with filled stomach and an urge to revisit to try the other varied menu which seemed to promise to be good.
Pocket pinch : 521 for two ( the wallet smiled too ;) )

My friend and I went to the place after going through the numerous Zomato reviews.
It is very easy to locate; right opposite La Martiniere for Boys School.

We ordered 3 items.
1. Classic Chicken Steak (BBQ sauce).
There were two; good-sized pieces; with fresh veggies and mashed potato. The chicken was soft. What I loved the most was the bbq sauce (Hoped there was more of it on the plate though)
2. Margherita Pizza. 
It took them 35 minutes to serve us the pizza (they asked us twice if we were ready to wait for that long. Well; we were!!) I really liked the pizza and I am happy I went for this all-time classic pizza. 
3. Chocolate Fondant.
The dessert was DELICIOUS. Loved it!! Though the ice cream had already melted by the time the dish arrived on our table; the chocolava more than made up for it!!

It costed us 520 bucks; inclusive of taxes!!

The place is very reasonably priced . The interior is simple and has a nice casual vibe to it. The glass-wall overlooks the busy@ road.

The staff was very prompt and serivce was more than satisfactory.

Would love to go and try their burgers the next time :D

My friend took me to this place a few weeks back, I was completely blown away. The ambience was amazing! The food was amazing as well, we ordered Alfredo pasta, BBQ cottage cheeze skewers, Green apple soda, and for desserts we had brownie! The service was amazing! Bang on 5stars! Keep doing the good job!!

I had heard pretty good reviews about the place and when finally I got a chance to dine out at this place I was needless to say thrilled. We didn't have much difficulty in locating the restaurant, really liked the quirky interior and the small yet comfy feel of the place. We ordered Mexican Chicken Skewers and Stuffed Mushrooms for starters. For mains we had Classic Chicken steak and Stroganoff and for dessert we had banana toffee. The sevice was pretty okay, they didnt make us wait long for our food. The food however was good but nowhere near great. Frankly I was a tad bit disappointed.  The only real highlight of the entire meal I would say was the banana toffee. And I happen to be a person who doesn't even like bananas.

An unplanned dinner took me to this realy quirky place suggested by a friend...she joined along as in her words she was craving deli cravings..the decor stands out with the couches and the wall painted in bright colours..coming to the food orderd for the mexican grilled skewers and garlic bread .the presentation was neat but nothing dat would please the eye. The garlic bread tasted ok. It was followed by the dish of the evening the spaghetti bolognese. it was yum both in terms of  taste and presentation. Then came the stuffed chicken steak served with mashed potato and chicken pasta .i am huge fan of mashed potato and i think this one definitely lacked flavour. The grilled fish in mango chilli sauce was hot for my friend's pallet but then again i luv chilli. a great job on the sauce.. guys.it sent a sensation through the tongue..not to forget the bluebery icyblast which was quite yumm..great job on the quiry style and the food..i would to like to visit again as 'my cravings for deli cravings' has juat began

The rave reviews of this place on zomato made me go to this place. I invited a friend over as I was that confident . 
Firstly . .easy to find . .nice to sit. You would think the place is small but actually the upstairs seating area is really adequate and quirky . 
A whole side was glass overlooking  La Marts and the road. We went for the recommended dishes . .not being in a mood to experiment. . .we ordered fresh lime sodas . .stuffed mushrooms(they guessed it even before we asked them) . .chicken skewers . .stroganoff and steak in bbq sauce .
I will not say I am disappointed but yes I was not satisfied . .Its really cool . .easy on the pocket . .good service . .but the food is not traditional steakhouse stuff and has fallen prey to bad experimentation it seems.I loved the presentation . .but the stuffed mushroom did not really enhance the taste but actually tried to cover it up . .the barbeque sauce was not what it should be . .tickling your taste buds . .and the chicken pieces were somehow hard to cut.

They really need to start serving cutting knives too.

Conveniently located in the Minto Park area right opposite La Matiniere School, this place has a lot to offer. To aptly put it I would say "chota packet bara dhamaka". A small place, the walls have a quirky decor, nicely done, full marks for staff etiquette. Above all the food is good. For all the Paan lovers try the Paan Mojito it's refreshing. The Caesar salad is tasty at the same time high on nutrition quotient. Cottage Cheese Steak was just okay - I would suggest some flavors could be added to the mashed potatoes & paneer for a better taste. Not high on pocket pinch as well.

It is located beside the hotel Park Prime and you can conveniently spot it. We had quality time eating and chatting. We tried cream of mushroom soup, which was thick and creamy. Cottage cheese steak was served with sauteed veggies in cilantro and mashed potatoes. Mexican veg. pizza was decent. In mocktail we had Berry blast shake and blue Hawaiian mocktail. Saving the best for the last, the desserts. Chocolate fondant and Banana toffee were show stealers. Pure sinful. Prices are pocket-friendly and the staff is humble. I would recommend strongly.

Located near J.D.Birla Institute,lower rawdon Street...it is a nice food joint of medium budget. Decor and ambience is also fair enough. They generally serve continental dishes which is quite good in taste and also of fair quantity. The Mexican and harissa pizza is a must try . Fish n chips is also good. But the steaks over there needs some improvement in taste. Overall it is good for students hangout.

Located right beside the Nissan car showroom, near Minto Park crossing, this is a small joint serving continental food. Went there for an early dinner. 
The ambience is cool and the decor is decent with comfortable red sofas. The staff is also polite and well-mannered. 
We ordered the following items: 
• Berry crush mocktail: 3/5 
The strawberry flavour was a little overpowering. Otherwise it was decent, the consistency was that of a shake, since it had ice cream in it too. 
• Blue Hawaiian mocktail: 5/5 
Initially I wanted the Pink Panther mocktail, but they said that they ran out of strawberry syrup hence settled for this. But I wasn't disappointed. This was made superb, with the perfect blend of sweetness and tangyness.
• Mexican cheese fries: 4/5
A great starter. Crispy french fries topped with salsa, baked beans and cheese. However, the serving of cheese could have been a little more generous. 
• Stuffed chicken steak: 3.5/5
A thick chicken breast stuffed with spinach and mushrooms (as per the menu) served with green beans and mash. However we didn't really find too many mushrooms inside, the chicken was stuffed with mostly spinach. Nevertheless, it was pretty tasty with the creamy sauce. The green beans were a let down though. 
• Grilled fish in chilly mango sauce: 4/5
Three fish fillets were served for this dish, and that is really great considering the price charged for it. It came with herbed rice and sauteed spinach. The covering of the fillets was a little thick, and a bit too spicy as well for our taste. But the fish inside was soft and fresh, and tasted great as well. Loved the sauce with the herbed rice. It gives you a sweet taste at first, and a sudden burst of mild hotness towards the end. Great sauce! 
A great experience overall. Would revisit!

Deli Cravings was there on our wish list for a very long time and a few weeks back we finally got to tick it off. We dropped in for lunch sometime around 3 and got ourselves settled at the corner sofa facing the wall. The place is nicely done with minimal effects and subtly resembled an usual American pub with plush sofas and marble top tables.
We ordered a Chicken BBQ Steak Burger, Chicken Cheeseburst Burger, Italian Cream Soda and a Craving's Lemonade. Service was fast and all the items came in within 15 minutes. The cheese-burst patty had a dollop of mayonnaise, fresh lettuce, sliced tomatoes and onions completing the burger. After taking my first bite, the secret of the rather yummy patty was revealed as some cheese started to ooze out from it. The sight of cheese always excites me to no bounds. Different layers of flavors from my cheeseburst burger mingled together to create a lovable fusion and I was immediately in bliss. However, a bite from his BBQ chicken steak burger and my mind was blown. There was definitely more character to that burger. It wasn't the fancier looking one, but the chicken steak patty was immensely juicy, had a crisp skin and tasted heavenly when combined with the pickled onion rings. We both felt that the BBQ sauce was a bit runnier than it should have been. The French fries weren't soggy and tasted fine.
Coming to the drinks, my pretty looking Italian cream soda was a whirlpool of fruit flavours. There was the distinctive taste of watermelon and a overpowering sweetness of the fresh cream topping. If you like a lot of sweetness in your mocktail, then this is definitely a good choice. The Craving's lemonade however was exactly what we both had been longing for on that hot, sweltering afternoon to calm our senses and also to wash away the leftover grease from the burgers. It had the tangy freshness of orange along with the popping spirit of soda and was a great palate cleanser.
The food was filling, delectable, affordable and of good quality and the service was fast and cordial. The burgers, sans any frills have limited options but are hugely satisfying. Would love to try out more from this place soon!

This restaurant is a hidden gem.
Location: Located on the opposite street of LMB school just beside the Nissan and other vheicles' showroom(I've attached a photo of the showroom, if u spot the showroom U'll easily find this eatery)

A few stairs took us to the first floor, where we settled down on one of the sofas. Decor was nice, western songs playing in the background with the tv switched off. The sofas are really comfy and the red chairs and tables look attractive.

The behavior of the staff was very good. They were extremely polite and courteous.

Dishes ordered :
1) Chicken wings in BBQ sauce
2) Mexican chicken skewers
3) fish in Mango chili sauce
4) choco fondant cake

1)The chicken wings were delish. Bone in, skin on wings grilled and tossed in this lovely sticky sweet n spicy BBQ sauce. And yum those crispy chicken skins. Who doesn't like crispy chicken skin?
{ 4 wings per serving- ₹150}

2) I asked for piri piri chicken but they only had piri piri fish, so instead the staff suggested us this dish. Skewered chicken marinated in spices, grilled and served with a dollop of sour cream and fresh herbs with sprinkle of pepper powder. It was delicious as well. 
{ 5 pieces per serving- ₹150}

3)This is the dish that won my heart over. May be because of the 3 generous fillets of fish that was served, or may be the sauce was amazing or may be being a Bengali, I love fish. Whatever be the reason, this dish was friggin' awesome. 3 large fillets of fish coated in some kind of batter, fried and served in mango chili sauce, with fried greens and herb rice. The fish was perfectly cooked, nice and flaky. The sauce was perfect with just the right amount of chili and tang. The greens were crunchy and tasty as well as the rice.
{ 3 pieces of fish with greens and rice per serving- ₹220}

4) We asked for banana split, but it was unavailable so instead they suggested the choco fondant cake. It is basically a choco lava cake( smooth thick chocolate sauce filled inside the cake) with a huge dollop of vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce with powdered sugar sprinkled on top. The combination of the warm cake and the cold ice cream was perfect with just the right balance of sweetness. Loved it
{one cake,one scoop of ice cream per serving- ₹120}

Verdict: Highly recommended. U wont be disappointed. Cheers!

P.S.- The price written on the menu card of all the dishes ar exclusive of VA.

This place offers a wide range of delicious continental delicacies at a very reasonable price.. Very easy to locate.. Fun decor... Well behaved staff.. Amazing food. 
We ordered tropical blue for drinks and it was chilled and fresh...for starters we had piri piri fish skewers...the fish was very soft and immediately melts in your mouth...thereafter we ordered a classic chicken steak in BBQ sauce and grilled fish with mango chili sauce... Both these dishes were equally tasty not only in terms of quality but also quantity... I loved the place and everything that is had to offer and would like to recommend it to everyone looking for good continental eatery :)

Just one word for this restaurant...FLAWLESS! I went there with my cousins for a late lunch around 4:15 and what a treat we had!
I had been wanting to come here for a long time but my first impression was quite worrying. We entered and were guided to the first floor where the tables were present. The place was absolutely empty! This kind of got us worried about the food.
But before coming to food, let's talk about the decor. From outside it looks very lacklustre, but inside it's certainly brighter. Not too many decorations, apart from the mirror which I loved! The place has a nice lively diner kind of atmosphere.

Now, coming to food, we had ordered :

Starters

Chicken Wings : Absolutely delicious! Loved the chicken to bits and pieces. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce on the chicken had a perfect balance of sweet and spicy and it just blew me away! Very hard to fault this dish.

Mexican Chicken Skewers : Another wonderful dish. I absolutely loved the flavours and the presentation was quite simple yet beautiful. I was just salivating when I saw it. The spices went together perfectly and again, the chicken was perfectly moist and succulent.

Garlic Prawns - This dish had a very nice flavour and the prawns were cooked wonderfully. The garlic, the bell peppers, the prawns, all went really well together. Though there proportion of bell pepper was the tad too high, and because of this tiny complaint, I have to say this dish was the least impressive, notify because of bad flavour but simply because the other dishes were so sublime.

Mains

Aglio e Olio Pasta with Prawns - The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente! Loved the flavour of the various herbs and the serving was quite generous too. There was a good amount of prawns and I thoroughly enjoyed the dish.

Chicken Cheese Burst Burger - The burger is definitely one of the nicest burgers I have ever had! Loved the patty and it tasted amazing. But what knocked me off completely were there fries. OH MY GOD! I have never had more delicious fries. I kept wanting more and more!!!

Chicken Steak Burger with BBQ sauce - Another really delicious burger! Loved the flavour! The chicken was so juicy that I got my hands completely dirty! But I didn't mind as the food was so perfect! And well the fries have received their fair share of appreciation :-P

Chef's Special Pizza - The pizza is a thin crust one and I loved everything about it. It was very cheesy and had great flavour. Loved the crust too. There were 8 slices and the meal as a whole was quite filling.

This place serves some great quality food and the best part is the really cheap prices. All this cost less than 1500 and I could not be any happier! I would definitely be back soon trying their others wonderful sounding dishes! You must try this place. The experience is quite priceless!

This is a small continental joint near minto park with a vibrant ambiance and some really good food.
I went there on my birthday. My friend surprised me with the help of their staff who are extremely well behaved ; they got me a chocolate brownie with lots of chocolate sauce and a candle on top and played a happy birthday song ^_^ It was lovely and the brownie tasted awesome. 

We ordered fresh lime sodas, chicken (cheese burst) burger and chef's special no veg pizza . 

The lime soda was very refreshing and tasted perfect.

The burger was a delightful surprise. With a tasty patty and lots of cheese it was the best burger I had in a long time. It was served with a generous portion of french fries. 

The 8 inch thin crust pizza was little spicy and my taste buds appreciated it all the more thus! 

I would definitely come back here again.

This place is situated just opposite to la martiniere for boys school, near minto park. It is a two storey joint with the restaurant in the upper floor n the ground floor is mainly devoted to kitchen. The interior is simple, nothing out of the ordinary but clean. Coming to food, we ordered a mango icyblast, strawberry icyblast and an oreo shake from the drinks section.  They were absolutely refreshing in dis hot summer times. We also had chicken alfredo pasta, stuffed chicken steak,  mexican chicken skewers and chicken wings. The steak was good enough though not the best, mexican skewers  had tender chicken n a spicy tangy delicious flavour and the wings were served in a mouthwatering hot n sweet sauce. But the winner of all was da pasta dish, the creamy white  sauce was amazing, definitely a must try for all. 
All in all this place is reasonable n serves some quality dishes. Surely a thumbs up from my side.

Good things come in small packages...after a visit to this eatery that was all i could say, this is arguably the best continental restaurant at a pricepoint which everyone can afford...the fish in mango chilly sauce and the chicken steak with the spinach stuffing are the best...the ambience is good, the services are good and we found the hotel manager personally looking after the guests.....the location is just beside the park prime(ex- chrome) on minto park. A must visit...

I m just bowled over... loved each and every item.. so unique!! super delicious !! gastronomic experience ... 😍😍 so different from the quintessential kebabs ,biryani and Chinese and yet will leave ur taste buds tickling And yearning for more..
I wud say the price I not cheap as the quantity provided for one dish is OK for one person( atleast a foodie like me:-P) .. again u get fantastic quality food at a very good price
coming to the food we had :
chicken Mexican skewers- lovely ... it was the first that we tried and first impression makes a huge difference
secondly stuffed mushroom again a vry popular dish
garlic bread hot and soft jst melts in ur mouth,

in the mains we had
fish in mango chilli sauce- have this dish as soon as it is served ,otherwise the batter of the fish will get soggy and loose it's crispiness
stuffed chicken steak- we were eating stirfried beans and smashed potato like it was made in Germany!! 😜😜
and harissa chicken pizza- quite spicy ,thin crust... nice..lots of chicken bt I still prefer the soft bread pizzas
also had cooler hawai blue and fresh lime soda frizzy for 45/- 👍👍👍
I will recommend deli cravings to everyone who wants to try out something new and will visit again and again bcoz I absolutely loved it..😍😍

Situated at Minto Park, found this delightful cafe through Zomato under Student Faves. 
The décor is chic and uncluttered. The service is good and the staff polite. 
Coming to the food, we had the ginger mojito, loaded nachos, chicken cheeseburst burger and nutella pancakes. 
The ginger mojito was really refreshing for a hot, summer day.
Nachos were good, loaded with salsa and cream and cheese. 
The cheeseburst was the BEST with cheese oozing out from the center. Really loved this burger. The caramelized onions were a nice, unexpected touch. 
Coming to the dessert, the pancakes were thin and filled with nutella and banana pieces. Only thought would be that the pieces should have been sliced thinner. 
Overall, we had a wonderful lunch without burning through our pockets.

A small place on the main road near exide. Colourfully done up :) we called for a mushroom cappuccino and trust me it was the best mushroom soup I've ever had. A prawn starter which tasted very good but the prawn was either frozen ones or boiled before cooked. A chicken steak stuffed with spinach was really nice though a little hard.l but the mashed potatoes with were nice and creamy. The service is top class. One place I would certainly go back!

We had Mexican chicken skewers and stuffed mushrooms for starters and pasta alfredo & stuffed chicken steak.
every food was well cooked delicious. Serving right on time, no delay even at times like 6:30pm or so.
Ambience pretty good if you r not expecting some hifi decor. Let d pics do the rest of talking :D

If anyone wanna know how to serve delicious Continental food at cheap dirt prices while maintaining quality close to perfection, this is the place one should come down to! Located conveniently opposite to La Martinere School of Boys on the main road, this should fall on your left or right, depending on the fact whether you are heading towards Minto Park Crossing or coming from Minto Park towards Park Circus!

The restaurant has been divided into two floors. With the ground floor comprising of the cash/reception counter and the washroom, the maximum portion of it has been dedicated to the kitchen. The first floor consists of the sitting are with marble slab covered table tops and convenient sitting places. Although, there menu isn't quite exhaustive and needs further modification/addition, a lot of varieties are served here and should be able to satisfy your quench for gluttony. Having made a couple of visits here, both for dine-in and take-away, its time I should put up a review for the same.

Dishes I have tried:

Mozzarella Sticks:- Apparently fried mozzarrella coated with some batter. The cheese was hard and did not melt in the mouth. Also the chilli dipping didn't throw much of a punch.

Mexican Cheese Fries:- When you lock up the ever favorite french fries, some cheese, jalapenos and baked beans; you get one hell of a family! And apparently this is what the dish is all about. Freshly prepared French Fries topped with cheesy sauce and loads of jalapenos and baked beans; the perfect fusion of Continental and Mexican food!

Note:- The Cheesy Sauce needs to be thickened a bit. The way it is put upon the fries, only the top layer of the fries enjoys the coating of the cheesy sauce, completely depriving the lower layer of anything and letting them remain dry. And you really cannot serve french fries without ketchup. Try having Ketchup as one of the ingredient. I am sure, the flavors that would come out won't disappoint!

Chicken Wings:- Large pieces of Chicken Wings baked perfectly and topped with the tangy Barbeque Sauce. This is apparently the only starter which can fill up your tummy like a proper main-course dish would do.

Lamb (CheeseBurst) Burger:- Crispy lamb patty, apparently stuffed with cheese. The accompanying veggies weren't much and this was mostly a no-frill/no-nonsense burger! Although the quantity of cheese was rather negligible and needs to be worked upon. I had tried this many months back and hence am not sure if the owner had worked upon this (Had provided my feedback personally to the owner)

Stuffed Chicken Steak:- Huge piece of a Chicken breast stuffed with spinach and mushroom and topped with the cheesy and creamy mushroom sauce. Mashed potatoes and veggies being the obvious partners, this dish really packs a punch in your mouth. The sides are perfectly charred and the spinach filling gives a unique taste to this dish.

Note:- The sides are sometimes over-grilled making the skin hard with time. The chef should work on this.

Classic Chicken Steak (BBQ/Mushroom/Pepper):- Simililar sized as stuffed steak but without the filling. That doesn't make any difference as all the 3 sauces carry a unique flavor and would make you realize that you are having the best steak at the prices they offer in entire Kolkata. Nothing much to write on this as words are falling short.

Note:- The quantity of mashed potato should be increased.

Chicken Roulade:- Usual composition of a Roulade, as it should be. However, didn't like the utterly sweet beetroot sauce.

Mexican Hot-Pot:- Spicy and tangy as any Mexican dish should be. Goes well with the rice.

Grilled Fish with Mango Chilli Sauce:- Bought this for take-away. Although the fish was fresh and flaky, the batter had gone soggy. Didn't like the mango chilli sauce either. Should have rather tried this for dine-in instead of a take-away.

Fish & Chips:- Check!

Pizza (Non-Veg):- Harrisa/Mexican/Chef's Special.

Thin crust with oozing mozzarella. All three of them have their unique flavors that's surely gonna hit your tongue!

Deserts:- Nutella Crepe.

What else do you expect when the sinful nutella gets packed with bananas within a crepe?

Banana Toffee:- The Toffee sauce was a tad bit too much for me.

Soda Fizzy + Icy Blast:- Green Apple for both.

Though liked Soda Fizzy more when compared to Icy Blast.

The restaurant did not used to charge VAT earlier as they weren't registered. However, with months, they eventually got registered and probably now has their license. Thus, one needs to pay a nominal VAT (Unless they have also introduced Service Tax and/or Service Charge) which I am not aware of!

The staff here are super-friendly. I made a couple of visits after the restaurant was opened and post which I went back there almost after a gap of 2-3 months! All the staffs were changed, but the manager who was in charge of coordinating things had no trouble recognizing my face! I found the staffs however, a bit under-trained. Unless it for the person managing things, interacting with the customers can turn out to be wee-bit difficult!

I wish I could give this a perfect 5, inspite of few flaws in certain dishes here and there. I am not doing so, because I want this restaurant to evolve and do better. I was told that the menu is supposedly going to have a change in few months as the owners were abroad. The next time I would probably visit in, I am expecting some more varieties of continental items including some sizzlers. :-)

One small suggestion though:- Try and project prices in your menu card inclusive of VAT. It carries a psychological advantage!

And for everyone else, try dropping in here ASAP. I am sure you won't be disappointed. :-)

We went there today itself around the afternoon. The interior is quite nice and simple. But the food is not that simple. After going through a lot of Zomato reviews, we ordered Stuffed Mushrooms. I didn't expect it to be such a delight.  Amazingly tasty and a beautiful little thing to look at . It will actually urge you to click a snap of it. Apart from being an eye pleaser , it did please our taste buds as well. For the mains, we opted for Chicken stuffed steak, Chicken roulade and Stroganoff. Each of these were amazing in their own ways. All these fancy dishes without burning a whole in your pocket is the cherry on the cake. I would definitely come back soon.

After going through some suggestions, finally tried this place... "Deli Cravings" with a friend of mine. So this is my feedback about the place.

Positives:
1. Firstly the location is the easiest to find as its bang opposite of la marts boys n just beside park prime. It's absolutely easy to locate. 
2. The decor goes well with the food that the place is offering along with nice music.
3. Food that we ordered was fish n chips, shepherds pie n classic chicken steak.

Fish n chips gives u the best quality fish with crispy fries-coleslaw n di.
Shepherds pie was just yummm.
Chicken steak was quite filling as its offers to two pieces of chicken in it...

4. Price: Anybody who has an idea of how u r charged in any of the places who 
serves you this kind of food I'm sure will find this place cheaper than those. 

Awesome food without pinch in the pocket.

Negative:
They will make u crave for their food... ;)
Sorry didn't find any negatives. 

We were so full that we couldn't try for the dessert.. So may be will visit the place very soon again...


It's a place where u can have good food n "adda" with friends and family n just relax n njoyy.

After reading the reviews and seeing the ratings on zomato, we visited this place on holi. They didn't have cold drinks or anything soda-based, which was a bad start. Then we ordered country friend chicken, they didn't have that! The final order was Piri Piri Fish, Tandoori Chicken, Shepherd's Pie and Garlic Bread. The fish and chicken both were too spicy. Even the potato which came with the chicken was spicy! We couldn't get any other taste whereas the shepherd's pie had too much potato and less lamb filling. The filling was so pasty that we couldn't taste the lamb only! Moreover quantity was disappointing as compared to the prices! The only good thing was the garlic bread. After such an experience, we dared not order more. We went and ate at another place because we were still hungry!
I don't understand why our experience was so bad while it has such great reviews! Truly disappointing. I would definitely give second thoughts on visiting this place again!

Wanted to go to this restaurant since a long time and finally got to go there today. It's a small place located beside Park Prime. Coming to the food, we ordered the creamy mushroom soup and hot and sour soup. While the mushroom soup was heavenly the hot and sour soup was a bit spicy for our liking and was a bit thick as well. We also ordered the Caesar Salad was nice but the croutons in it tasted weird. However the manager later explained that they prepared it differently. The stuffed mushroom was too good. Liked its mayo dip as well. We had also ordered Mexican Hot Pot and BBQ cottage cheese skewers which were also nice. The Mexicana Pizza that we ordered was absolutely lip smacking! It was quite different from the usual pizzas. The sauce , the cheese and the toppings were also really nice. All in all loved the food. The service was great and the prices were really reasonable. This place is thus a must try and I would surely visit it again .

Visited this place on holi. It was empty which was such a relief. Very easy to locate, near Minto Park.
Coming to the food. Ordered two soups the mushroom soup and veg hot and sour. Do try the mushroom soup, its amazing. The hot and sour soup can be passed. We ordered Caesars Salad and Stuffed Mushroom. Caesars Salad was quite good, but not really the best. Their Stuffed Mushroom is a must have and the sauce they serve with it is really nice and smooth.
For the main course we ordered BBQ skewed cottage cheese and Mexican hot pot. Both the dishes were really good. The Paneer cooked really well and the gravy of the hot pot was absolutely great. Served with Mexican rice it is a complete wholesome meal in it self.
Finally we ordered the Mexican Pizza. I would really not say much about it. Just go and try it and then tell me.
It is really pocket friendly. Students would love this place. I would be back surely.

Aaah...never been this satisfied with continental food :) well a total worth the spent restro! 
We ordered two lemon cravings and one Hawaiian Blue mocktails.. the lemon cravings were fresh and chilled, while the Hawaiian blue looked amazing, but was too sweet.
Next we ordered chicken wings in Barbeque sauce which I highly recommend, coz it was amazing.
For mains we ordered stuffed chicken steak, lamb bolognese and Mexican hotpot.  The Mexican hot pot was very spicy and tangy...but it was amazing! 
We finished it off with brownie with ice cream and an extra helping of ice-cream with nutella crepes. We did not like the nutella crepes as it had a banana filling and it did not really go with the nutella.

I have discovered this place only recently and it has become an instant favourite right away.
What brilliant food! We ordered stuffed mushrooms and cheese jalapeño balls for starters. 
The stuffed mushrooms are to die for!
For main course we had their stuffed chicken steak ,bolognese and veg burger.
The steak and the bolognese were really good.
My friend said the veg burger too was nice. 
For dessert we had chocolate fondue, it was so yummy!The quantity of the food is really good!
I only have a problem with a giant screen TV that is always on in the place.
I find it to be quite distracting.
Apart from that this is an awesome discovery!

This is truly a hidden gem. Located right on the main road , it looks as though it'll be like any other average restaurant. But it's definitely not. We had the green apple icy blast drink which was really good , Mexican chicken skewers , chicken and veg cheese burst burger, kit Kat shake , Ginger mojito, Mexican cheese fries, cottage cheese skewers and the stuffed chicken steak. The chicken skewer was really tangy and good , with the flavour of garlic predominating ; the burger was also really cooked well, with a cheese filling inside the patty; the Mexican cheese fries were something new , as if fries had replaced nachos. I really liked this concept. The stuffed chicken steak was good too , with a spinach and corn filling served with a creamy mushroom sauce and an equally creamy mashed potatoes. The cottage cheese skewers were good and were served with Mexican rice which did not taste that good. But the potatoes it was served with had a strong taste of basil so I instantly liked it. It's a very good place with good quality and quantity food , but service is a bit slow. However , the food masks everything . It is worth paying a visit.

I have been eyeing this place for quite sometime now and finally made it there. The experience was very satisfying considering the quality,quantity,price of food and the comfortable seating arrangement. I don't know why some of the reviewers have said that portions are not enough. We were two people and every dish has enough quantity for two.

We had the stuffed mushrooms which is,I must say,a very well-thought out recipe. The crispy exterior and the juicy interior makes it delicious. I felt it was a little less saltier than it should have been though,but that's okay.
The grilled fish in mango chilli sauce had three fillets *yay* with a side of herb rice. This was a great dish. The fish was tasty and soft and buttery. I wish they had given a little more sauce. :3 
For dessert, banana in toffee sauce. Now this one depends on your taste really.Dont go for it,if you hate bananas, like me. :P My friend seemed to like it so I cant really say it was not a good one. 

The interiors are simple. Colourful yet not overdone.

Great place for a hearty meal without upsetting your wallet.

Finding this restuarant is very easy, its in the main road and 5 mins walking distance to minto park 4 point crossing towards lower loudon street.
Seating arrangements on the first floor which was pretty big and ambiance was very good, also we were the first customer in today so place was very clean.
Hospitality and behaviour of the staffs were too good and friendly.
Tried some of their dishes below:

Chicken Caeser Salad--- This particular salad was just mind blowing, excellent dressing with caeser sauce and I must say that this is my best salad till date.

Green tea with Honey--- According to my partner this was also very good.

Flavoured Iced Tea--- This particular drink was very good in taste and one thing you should remember that you have drink it fast otherwise ice will melt and due to excess water you will not enjoy the taste of it.

Chicken Roulade Steak--- This steak was served with spicy beans and herb rice. It comes in kebab like 6 pcs of chicken with some stuffing under it. Excellent taste btw.

Pesto Cream Chicken pasta with parmisian cheese--- This particular pasta was good but not great as other upper mentioned dishes.

Quantity is not sufficient for one people per dish (Specially foodie like me).
Really enjoyed the food and I'll definitely go again..

Deli Cravings is a hidden gem, with incredibly, incredibly pocket friendly (a fresh lime soda is for only 45 bucks, dessert for about 140, soup for 100, and starter for about 150 !!!) food, extremely friendly, polite and efficient staff as well as prime location (on AJC Bose Road opp LMB).

Food-wise, it is also quite a deal as well.

The stuffed mushroom starter, which is mushroom stuffed with spinach and deep fried in a light batter, turned out to be an excellent dish. I have often fretted that restaurants in Calcutta often ignore the dips and sauces, serving ready from market mayonnaise and ketchup, but the mayonnaise dip that came with the starter was outstanding - light and fluffy, and seasoned with fresh herbs, paprika and olive oil. Whatever else you order, I insist that you order this dish, please !

My parents shared a hot and sour chicken soup, which was very rich, flavour-some, garlic-y and quite wholesome. I usually avoid an oriental starter or soup (which is bolder on flavors) with continental meal (which is blander) because it mixes my taste palette, but if that's not an issue with you, this is something you can order.

In the mains, the fish in mango chilli sauce came with hearty three portions of fish, herb rice and sauted spinach. The fish was very good to taste, except the sauce was a basic honey chilli sauce and not mango chilli sauce. The sauted spinach was slightly bland though.

We ordered two chicken main courses - the stuffed chicken breast with spinach was pretty good (even though the spinach filling was the same as in the mushroom starter), though the chicken could have been a little softer. I really liked the mushroom sauce on it though - it does seem like everything Mushroom is this place's specialty- as also the sauteed beans which came tossed in sesame seed. Sesame seeds, though used more on Oriental than continental greens, really elevated the beans from the usual boiled and sauteed version. The mashed potato was just average.

The more risque chicken roulade in beetroot sauce was kinda okay-ish, mainly because beetroot sauce is a very difficult thing to really make appetizing. The roulades in itself were pretty good, though with the same spinach filling !

We wrapped up our meal  with a dessert, which was three pancakes with banana and nutella filling, all for 140 bucks. The pancakes were really fresh and fluffy and dish was overall pretty good, except, what was served was chocolate sauce and not nutella.

Our whole meal cost us a paltry 1250 bucks, which is, like I mentioned, quite a deal !

My only suggestion would be that a little more honesty in serving items mentioned in the menu would help (or alternatively, changing the menu, to what is actually being served). And, if the menu is being changed, a little look into the proof reading will help - the lawyer in me felt really distracted by lack of uniformity in spacing (often missing), in the dessert and drinks menu. ;)

The BEST!

A delight to the tastebuds if you're in the mood for continental food. From the staff to the food, everything was simply amazing!
We ordered Fish and Chips to go first, then Grilled fish with mango chilli sauce, two chocolate shakes and by the end when were already loaded ordered a Mexican chicken skewered just to cover the best of what they had to offer.

Coming to the fish and chips, it was absolutely mind blowing from the crispy ness on the outside to the soft bhetki inside and the French fries just added to it. Absolute delight! Then came in the grilled fish, the sauce was one of the best and they even offered some extra rice as they saw we were over with it, amazing staff I tell you. Chocolate shakes were nicely made too. Now comes the Mexican chicken skewers, so this dish just made my day, placed in small tandoor sticks, there were 5 of them, very spicy and on the top were a splash of yoghurt that just made it awesome. And it was a perfect end to our meal.

Overall this a place I'm surely paying a visit next month to try out their grilled chicken and lamb lasagna. The staff showed their courtesy not only inside but also outside the restaurant, when they saw me boarding my bike, that shows how truly well behaved they were.

A perfect 5/5 in all respect.

This place surprised me. The food was so good, like you can only understand once you taste it. My personal favourite was the mushroom cream soup, well this goes for the mushroom lovers, a must try. The starters as well as the main course made my tummy really happy. This place will not disappoint you . I went there for lunch so had a lot and came out happy. Must try. Eat and be merry. Cheers!

Having been introduced to this place by my brother, craig, i have become almost a regular here... the hospitality is wonderful, the place though situated on the main road amongst the hustle and bustle of traffic, is amazingly quiet with gud music playing in the background, never too crowded. Being a postgraduate student, with stress on the word student, our pockets are never too loaded with cash, this place is affordable for everyone. Coming to the food, the cheese burst burgers are extremely delicious and i cant have just enough of them, yesterday though i tried the sheperds pie and the barbeque chicken wings along with my personal favourite the cheese burst burger. Keep spreading the love deli cravings,  cause we crave the good food u make!

This review is pending for a week. After shopping at Quest we wanted a comfortable n reasonable place to eat dinner. So ditching all the honchos at Quest searched zomato.Discovered Deli Cravings opposite LMB headed my team like Columbus. We reached in 10 minutes,  greeted with warm reception. We took the seats overlooking the road. We settled for main course directly. The captain was very cooperative and patient to explain the dishes as well as his recommendation. The order was crisp...one stuffed chicken steak, one classic chicken steak,  one crispy prawn burger , Mexican chicken skewers and cheese garlic bread.  The cheese garlic bread arrived first...which was yummilicious. The prawn burger had golden fried prawn and a generous amount of coleslaw. Divine to be precise.Served with lots of crispy golden fries. The Classic Steak was ordered with barbecue sauce accompanied by mash and grilled veggies. Perfect to the last T. The bomber was the Stuffed Steak....filled with mushroom, cheese and spinach. Bellisimo.A special mention on their hospitality. The owner walked up to find if everything was enjoyed. We were delighted to get such gourmet food at such reasonable pricing. The Mexican chicken skewers were delicately spiced n tangy , grilled perfectly. It was melt in mouth experience . The dessert was excellent. ...we ordered Choco Lava cake...they had given complimentary vanilla ice cream to accompany. It was super soft....with warm gooey chocolate molten  lava overflowing. Can't get better. Everything including tax came to 1200 bucks....that was heavenly. Foodies I strongly recommend this place for burgers, steaks and all comfort food. CHEERS TO EXPLORATION 😀😀😀 with

Having come across this fairly new place on Zomato,we decided to try out Deli Cravings for lunch today!
Situated right on the main road opp. La Martiniere,this is a lovely little place to have a nice time.
Coming to the food,we ordered one cappucino,a choco frappe, mexican chinese skewers, Stroganoff and a bbq chicken steak!
The coffees were one of the best we've had in this city. The Stroganoff really blew my mind too. It was delicious!
The prices were quite reasonable as well.
Definitely going back again to try their Pizzas and Pastas. Also their Shepherd's Pie and Bolognese for next time ;)

We went here a week before christmas  and it is One of my best enjoyed meals till date.  This place is bound to make you come back again and again
Decor is simple,  too simple I think. Space is good enough.  Styled in an American deli restro outfit.  
We had.ample portions of those excellent continental dishes.  

Stuffed roasted chicken, Minced Lamb steak with pepper sauce, Classic Fish and Chips, Shepherd's Pie,  Burger. And we ended it on a sweet note with the Banana toffee caramel. @
Every damn dish was almost perfect leaving the mutton steak which I didn't like that much. 

I specially mention the Shepherds pie,  fish n chips and the banana toffee. Absolutely Made to perfection.

The chef came up later and we thanked him with all our hearts for such a wonderful meal.

In the eve of Christmas, we first visit here. First reaction after having dinner, we just like, Omg what was that!! Just awesome foods. A must visit restaurent in Kolkata.Food:1. Superb in taste.2. You can't get Pizza, Chicken steak, Cappuccino in this price of such quality in any other restuarent.3. The pizza, mainly the Chef's spcl pizza is just awestruck. The Dominos, Pizza hut is far away behind in making pizzas. :p4. A real budget friendly restaurent in a place like Minto Park.Decor: The decoration is not much, but it's quite good. I really love to be hang out there with my friends. Alresdy visited two times. Looking forward for our next visit & try out some snacks.

Anyways coming to the review point, 
Place is quite big.. Music is there, lights.. 
Roadside, convenient place.. 
Easy to locate and reach! 
Food is above average, good.. 
Serves perfect! 
Thought it would cost more, but trust me.. 
You wont regret once the bill comes! 
Along with the tax, my bill was less and cheaper than the rest restaurants.. 
You will enjoy.. 
You Could go with friends, family and gf/bf..

It was both Christmas and my birthday celebration. I and Koninika De found this joint out on zomato and i decided to throw my birthday party here. It's located near chrome hotel just opposite to La Martiniere for boys school. We reached there at around 1.15pm and we were worried about the availability of tables. The staff assured us of that. There are two floors. The ground floor has no tables and is rather a waiting area with a sofa and a beautiful mirror with a basin. We went upstairs and it was so colorful. The red sofas and colorful cartoon graphics, wallpapers and strongly lighted interior gave a festive touch. The road side section of this floor is covered with clean glass,ideal for a view of the road.  
                We ordered stuffed mushrooms, red pepper chicken and garlic prawns for our starter. All of them were awesome specially mushroom. I could have never imagined that mushroom could taste so delicious. For main course we ordered Shepherd's pie, stuffed chicken steak, prawn newburg, grilled fish with mango chilli sauce and zingara peri peri pizza. Shepherd's pie was average in taste. I like stuffed chicken steak. The breast piece of chicken is stuffed with mushroom and then grilled with white sauce and it was served with mashed potato and beans and tasted good. Prawn dish was served with sautéed vegetables and herb rice and a very unique preparation. Pizza was average and they took a long time to serve it. But the show stopper was fish with mango chilli sauce. It was out of the world. The aroma and flavour of the dish was so unique and none of us had ever tasted such a dish. 
                    The staffs were very helpful. One of my friends

Visited Deli Cravings today with two of my friends after hearing rave reviews from another! We ordered Pink Lemonade and Berry Blast for drinks, stuffed mushrooms and Non-veg Mexican Pizza for starters and  Bolognese with meat sauce, Stroganoff and Non-veg Mexican Hot-pot for main course. Until the drinks and the starters everything was really good but the mains disappointed us big time! All of us felt only the Stroganoff was good enough. The Bolognese felt really heavy because of the texture of the sauce and the sauce was too salty for my taste. I feel had there been less sauce and meat balls in the sphagetti instead of that thick meat sauce it would have tasted better. My friend too didn't like The Non-veg Mexican Hot Pot much - the rice was okay but there were not many chicken pieces in the Mexican Hot Pot gravy and the taste too was not upto her liking. Keeping the food part aside, we felt the staff were really friendly and the service too was quick. We even had the Chef coming up to ask us how the food was. So I'd like to give them a few brownie points for this. I really want to visit this place a second time and taste the other dishes. Hopefully we'll have a better experience (food wise) next time around!

When I first came to know about the restaurant I just curious about the restaurant.Everybody is saying that this is a good budget restaurant and probably one of the restaurant who does not compromise with the taste within budget.
So today I visited this restaurant.Its exactly situated opposite of the last martiener boys school on A.J.C.Bose road.The restaurant is based on vibrant color.But I think they need to change the wall painting..Its does not go with the actual restaurant.Prferaable design they can think about it.
Now coming to the service.It was very good and the waiters are well aware of food choice and their field of expertise.Waiters are very courteous.The service was quick too.
Now coming to the main point "The food"
We have ordered so many dishes me tioned as per below:
1. Paan mojito; probably the best and unique mojito I HV tasted till date.The presence of paan I can taste in with every sip.the drink was containing the mint leaves which gave it a completely refreshing flavour and looks to.
2.Fresh soda lime sweet: The soda was as usual.The sweetness is coming front.it was refreshing too.
3.stuffed mushrooms:
That was really good.Mushroomes are really well cooked but only thing is that it does not need the puterside oily skin.so please take Seriously about the health meter of the food.
3.Classic chicken stake: 
This dish was average . one of the chicken piece was not cooked properly.but the other piece was juicy tendered.served with sauté veggies and mashed potato with butter and veggies.Those are really good..
4.Grilled fish with mango sauce:
This was a sweet dish.the pieces of fish are well cooked.served with spinach and rice.the spinach are not so good..
One little suggestion they need to add the more no. Of necesay..
So overall experience was good.so I am rating it as 3.5.

Edit: Tried out the Lamb Cordon Bleu- its basically a crumb fried lamb cutlet served with a delicious sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and sautéed vegetables. The best dish I've tried here so far :)

After reading favourable reviews , i visited this place today. 
Coming straight to the point. The quantity of the starters is very less. The jalapeno cheese balls i ordered were the size of cheetos cheese balls if not a bit bigger. Same goes for the stuffed mushroom. However that dish is one of the best dishes i have had in recent times. Kudos to the chef for that. 
The chefs special veg pizza was alright. 
The mexican chicken pizza was pretty good. 
Now you might ask why should you visit this place then, the answer is …really pocket friendly food (and i mean really) which is yummy by compromising on the proportions. 
Service was slow. Staff was good . 
I'll suggest visitors to order one starter per person or two. pizzas can be shared by two.

We had our light meal with TOMATO AND BASIL SOUP , really really well made with a strong flavour of basil, CHICKEN GREEK SALAD with fresh lettuce, bell pepper onions olives in lemon dressing , loved it too . I ordered for a STUFFED CHICKEN STEAK , which came as a juicy chicken stuffed with mushrooms and spinach with mushroom sauce , lovely potato mash and sauteed beans. I enjoyed it. Will visit again for more. And yes , prices are inclusive of taxes ! So just had these in 500 bucks ONLY.

Well, as  Adeline Virginia Woolf said once "one cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dinned well" has now predominantly become true when I had my dinner today at Deli Cravings. Being non vegetarian we started with fried Chkn wings in BBQ sauce and went on with Garlic Prawns, stuffed chkn steak, grilled fish with mango chilli sauce. Then opted for dessert in which we had. brownie a la mode and chocolate fondant which completed the course since we possessed single stomach each. Now, did I say dinner? Well do not limit yourself. You can start off with Lunch should you feel like and enjoy the ambience, well behaved staff and the variety of delicious food for longer time and if you are lucky you get to meet the "chefe de cozinha" (the great chef)by EOD. A must visit place if you are looking for something extra ordinary for your tastebuds and that too without badly affecting your pocket. To the owner and his all staffs my best complements - 'you folks rock'

It gives me immense pleasure to review this place. First, because i found a hidden gem in this place. Secondly, I was recommended this place at the time when I had almost lost hope in the concept of a place which is unbelievably reasonable and serves amazing Italian and Continental food without hookah! The place is very conveniently located in minto park!
What we ordered:
1. Cheese burst burger- We were told that the Patty would ooze out cheese. Sadly it did not. Surprisingly I still liked it. It's really hard to impress me with something, in which I was promised an overdose of cheese and then deprived of it. The Patty was perfectly done. Ample amount of salad. Perfectly cooked fries, though they lacked proper seasoning. A small suggestion- please don't grill the burger bun, leave it uncooked from the top and the texture will be something brilliant! Overall, a very nice experience.
2. Barbeque cottage cheese steak- It was very well presented. They say "well begun is half the battle won". Well, it was true in the case of this dish . I knew it was going to be special without even trying it. Paneer cubes marinated with barbeque sauce and grilled, along with bell peppers went really well with the Mexican rice, which was by the way a little flat in taste. A little more seasoning and spice would have made it more Mexican. Loved the panner skewers though. Tasted excellent. That smoky flavour, the softness, the aroma, the taste. Bang on! I would like to make a special mention about the chopped potatoes they serve alongside this dish. It was special. So brilliantly seasoned and coated with parsley. Amazing! The best thing about the dish was that serving of chopped potatoes.
3. Pasta alfredo- cheesy, creamy, exotic! Do you need anything else in a white sauce pasta? I have never liked mushrooms more than I did in that pasta. One could smell the aromatic basil from a distance.
4. Mexican fries with cheese- I loved the thought behind that dish. Iam sure the innovator of that dish is a crazy foodie like me. However, I was so full by that time, that I can't say much about the taste because that will not completely be fair.
Coming to the ambiance, all I can say is that it is a cafe and it looks like one. Peaceful, good music, spacious, comfortable seating.
The staff and the owners, both are very cordial.
Please keep up the good work and you have the potential to be really popular among foodies. Good luck!
P.s: this review is totally unbiassed and based on my experience!

We has ordered cheese burst garlic bread ( they served in room temperature),  mix sauce pasta, stuffed cheese mushroom ( amazing starter),  cheese burst veggie burger( was too served in room temperature),  cafe frappe, pineapple shake. Quality and quantity both were good.  But owner had the courtesy to accept it's fault and promised to improve it.

Okay, so I was hungry last night because there was nothing good cooked at home for dinner. So, I decided to try this this new joint right outside my lane. I ordered stuffed mushrooms and veggie cheese burst burger. The burger had a very different taste to it. I would definitely order food from Deli Cravings the next time we are to order something. 

Amazing food and even better taste. Highly recommended for finger food and shakes.

Located somewhere beside the park prime,J.D. Birla college,below AJC Bose Flyover and opposite LMB school😂 Oops! That's a lot of information,sadly I don't have much to say about the food. This newbee in Minto park is a pocket friendly joint and made keeping in mind the large number of popular schools and colleges in that area. Now coming back to our experience,it was me who insisted my friends to try this out. We sat on the not so comfortable seating and ordered for loaded chicken nachos. I am a zomato freak so is my dear friend we had a brief idea from the reviews that the food will be taking a lot of time to come to our table and it did. I will surely comment about the peppy young fresh decor of the place with glass panels. The nachos was toooooooooo less in quantity for the three hungry girls who just wanted good food. Sadder part? The nachos were nothing but Cornitos chips! The main course was chicken stroganoff and stuffed chicken steak along with paan,watermelon,green apple mojito. Well the food was pretty good and one plate clearly servers just one person. I should comment about the paan mojito as it was pretty different and refreshing. See now, be it the Stroganoff,the Steak,the Nachos all were not bad but my expectations! My mind always goes back to Irish Grande Nachos and Mocambo's Chicken Stroganoff ,Codfather's Chicken steak. I am the pre spoiled foodie😂this place is not bad at all!You can definitely give this place a try! Heard the this crust pizza is pretty good never tried though😜

This place is just opposite to the LMB school. We ordered for shepherd's pie, lamb cordon bleu, lamb steak and stuffed chicken steak. After the order was placed it was really a long wait. Almost after 45 mins the food arrived. The lamb cordon and the lamb steak was good but the chicken steak and shepherd's pie did not impress me. They do have a wide variety of choices. Plating of the food was nice.

Located just beside Chrome hotel, this is a small cosy place which has a colorful and urban look. It's more of a hangout place for students, considering the pocket friendly prices of the dishes. Food is good, although the portions seem to be smaller than other places. Presentation gets them a few points more though. We'd ordered stuffed chicken breast and chicken roulade. In terms of taste, they won us over. Ambience was alright. Same old pop numbers you get to hear at all those hangout places.

As the name sounds, the place is as exciting. One-for the fact it's located near minto park, in the heart of the city and secondly for its exquisite food. I really enjoyed the delicacies being served by the chef & strongly recommend all foodies for a hospitable visit.
DO Try the inventive & mouth watering Desserts !!!

Located Near Minto Park. Its a small Cozy Place. 

Mocktails are great and very polite staff.

Parking is a problem which needs to be attended

Visited this place quite a few times and I must say that I am getting addicted to its food. Every dish in the menu card is worth a try, without putting a big hole in your pocket. Since every dish is made fresh, you have to give the chef some extra time. But it is worth the wait.

Alright! This place is prety decent, nothing fancy about the interiors.... they have kept it simple n straight i guess..but thats what, sometimes simplicity is all that is needed... :)
Located right outside Chrome hotel (ajc bose road)... anyways... i came to know about this place through one of the food blogs and the lady had only good things to talk about this place..so i quickly checked out in zomato and their menu interested me... specially the name "chicken cheese burst burger" well, it reminded me of my bangalore days... i was excited to try this burger here and to see if it matched the taste of bangalore's... went there with my frnd and we ordered Mexican hot pot (rice based dish) and my favourite cheese burst burger along with Lindt Hot chocolate.... hot pot had a tangy chicken gravy with rice the combination seemed prety good, the quantity looked prety low but then when once you're done with  the whole plate u feel percfectly full...you wont feel hungry or over eaten... so thums up to that item :)
Lindt hot chocolate was little disappointing though but it was ok, not bad i would say...and regarding my burger, if i hadn't gone with any expectations regarding the burger then it would have been better... all i was thinking was about the burger available at truffles in b'lore...so it was little disappointing... but then if u compare with burgers available in calcutta its right there on the top 5.... the patty was crisp, the buns ver soft and the best part when i took the bite cheese was oozing out of the patty (hahaha, i sure most of ur already hungry when read oozing cheese) :D
Anyways, all in all a very good place to hanout with friends, it wont pinch ur wallet either cuz the foods r well reasonably rated :) excellent service i must say....ohh btw!! The best part about the restaurant is that the price you see on the menu includes all the stupid tax we pay in other hotels.... so what u see is what you pay.. :)

Here's my voting out of 5:
Food: 4.5
Ambience: 4.5
Service: 5
Music: cant remember if they were playing anything..

@Admin, i have a suggestion if your reading this... there should be 2 size of burgers (regular/XL) regular is what your serving and XL would be a bigger one diametrically... if you know what i mean... along with ketchup bottles  there should also be mayonnaise sqeezy bottle too only for guests who are ordering for burger.... there are bunch of people like me who likes lotto mayonnaise.. ;)

Me being a foodie lover..ive been to many food  joints in DELHI NCR.  KOLKATA  and many cities in india and abroad.  Ive tasted from street food to high end Gourmet   all type of servings but what comes in the end is the taste and the budget.   Well this place passed  both tests.  Its excellant in taste and very nice on pocket.  U can go out with frnds n family n  enjoy a good meal at a very good price....non veg is very good  N yes i loved the fish   if u dont make good fish in kolkata.  Then no good.  But this place passed the fish test   firstly the SMELL ...FRESH....N TASTE  all the three... worth giving this place a shot for allll.......

Deli Cravings was in my list after I heard about it from my common friends. The ambience is good. The staffs helpful & patient as took my time to look through the menu to order. The very first thing that struck me is the variety & competitive price they were offering. My friends and I decided to try a bit of everything. Burgers were lovely, pizzas were soft with loads of toppings, pastas were fresh as the cheese just melted in my mouth & then there was the wonderful juicy steak. Overall it was a feast over one of the best dishes served to me ever!! People in Kolkata loves & appreciates food & to me this place sits right on top. Very well done to the staffs & owners. I will certainly keep visiting as and when I travel to Kolkata :)

To be honest finally a place with a difference I am talkin of both veg and non veg... Me being a veggie I can see something different from other food joints... Presentation and portions are really nice... You must try the veggie burger... It's patty is not the monotonous kinds of McDonald's or KFC or other joints..: food is fresh and not frozen... The pizzas are well designed and priced for its size... You won't get bored eating the whole thing.. You may want more!!! The lamb burger is cooked the American way grilled and not fried!!! Looked delicious could not taste!!! Looking forward to new items to the menu!!!
