Firstly I have a good experience about this fast food joint..  It's really reasonable according to the fast food available at chowrasta as only Prince fast food is there..  Apart from that all are Restaurant..  And the menu almost consists of 150 items.. You must try their Rolls and Noodles. I ordered a Chicken pakora and Egg tarka - 2plates,  Paratha - 6pcs.  It was around 320/- Thanks for the Tasty Pakora once again.  üëç

I usually don't start writing on a negative note but couldn't help here. This is just a fast food takeaway centre with seating arrangement only for 5 people. This is located in Behala Chowrasta near Janakalyan bus stop. The food is bland, and the worst part is it is overpriced. The food in the stalls outside is way cheaper and tastier. This place needs a lot of improvement.

Being a customer here from 6 months I can bet that ,Here the food quality is excellent and can be rated 6 star........This fast food center provides customers with good quality food and service.....their quality of food is good enough to beat Fast food centers like Hazi Saheb-which provides bad quality of food at an exorbitant price........the staffs here are polite with their customers......everyone should try out with their food and the service they provide.....

Nice experience with them.  As we placed a booking for our guests at home.  They provided really good food.  We ordered Fish Manchurian and fried rice with chicken Pakora. And lastly 8 plates of chicken momo.  It is really worth having it over there with pocket friendly charges . Thanks üòä

Im in love with this fast food restaurant. Their hakka noodles and chicken rolls are beyond excellence. Since i am a foodie, my experience says that this is the only fast food center which provides everything fresh, be it chicken or anything else, all over kolkata.  Truly amazing. Three cheers to its owner.

I tried chicken hakka noodles.its not that good. It seemes the noodles were undercooked or something. But the quantity is more than enough.üòä
I also tried prawn fried rice and schezwan chicken. I asked to make the chicken spicy. But it wasnt spicy. But nevertheless i liked the chicken and the rice. I will definitely try the biryani from this outlet.

Worst biryani ever. I am seriously regretting buying ut from here

This fast food centre provides the best quality of food in the town... Not only their quality their quantity is absolutely outstanding. The momo they provide that tastes awesome. And their biriyani is mouthwatering. One thing i have to admit that their dry chilly chicken has got something really to do with the taste buds.. It thoroughly instigates ur taste buds.

A great fast food centre doesn't distinguish itself by how few mistakes it makes but how well they handle those mistakes... Its one of those kind  that actually problematizes your proportion of thinking that whether you went out or you came home.. And royal fast food does that at the same point of time.. Hats off.. Im hooked...

This place is hardly one month old. They serve widespread items but unfortunately few items were not available at the counter. This kind of unprofessionalism is not expected if you want to stay in the race. Till now I have tasted their rolls to much of my surprise it's quality is outstanding and fried with perfect amount of oil. Ordered mixed fried rice and chilly chicken of them none of them was upto the mark moreover i found that chilly chicken bland. They charge reasonable amount of money for a single plate but it lacks qualitywise. Thank you.

I have ordered both the Chicken and Mutton Biryani from here and this is currently my favorite Biryani delivery place in the neighborhood. The quantity is satisfying and the Biryani is bae! It looks classy i.e. white and brown rice with blessed chicken chunks - light and non-greasy and exceptionally tasty. More power to you!

I tried the chicken fried momo from here today. It was more like vegetable fried momo (couldn't find a single piece of chicken in the momo). The soup was totally tasteless with a few pieces of onions floating on it. I regret wasting Rs. 80 on that crap.
