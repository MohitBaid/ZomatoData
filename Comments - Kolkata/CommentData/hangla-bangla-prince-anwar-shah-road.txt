Good Chinese food with affordable rates.

Basically takeaway food joint, Friendly Staffs, Quick Service, Quantity and Quality both were good and enough for two. 

This is kinda hidden gem ‚ù§ 

Located in the Poddar Nagar Bylanes (Opposite Jodhpur Park Taltala Ground) 

Below pictures are Mixed Fried Rice (Rs.60 half plate ) ,  Chicken Manchurian - 8 Chicken Chunks (Rs.90) and Crispy Chicken - 12 pieces (Rs.80 ) üòÉ

Crispy Chicken as a starter is a must try. 

Mixed Fried Rice tastes very good with lots of egg, chicken and Prawn. 

Chicken Manchurian tastes perfect with correct amount of spices and pieces are tender as well ‚ù§

This is by far the tastiest chinese Ive had in Kolkata in such a great price. My favortie would be the crispy chicken. I have no idea even without a tawa how could they manage to get that tandoor taste. All my colleagues at work keep ordering from here. They have only take aways for now as its been just a few months since its run-on! But the service and the quantity is no doubt top quality. The location is super convinient. If you are super tired of shopping from South city, grab a bite from here and let your taste buds do the job... 
Definitely a 5!!!! ‚úåÔ∏è

Why a rating of 4? Without a hesitation it's a 4. I have ordered from  here a lot many times since the time this place had opened and not one time has it disappointed me with respect to the quantity or the quality of food.  Keeping in view that it is still an infant in terms of the months of operation I am keen to know what would be the momentum when it grows into an adult one!! 
I especially love their fried rice.  I would say all the food items on the menu list is worth a taste! 
And the price is so reasonable.  

Located conveniently near South city mall,  this place is up for serious competition in the food world.  Highly recommended.  :)

On our way back from work, we decided to quickly order & pickup from the outlet. We ordered Fish Finger, Chicken Fried Rice & Hot Garlic Chicken. By the time we reached their outlet the food was packed & ready to go. Both the quantity & the quality of the food surprised us in a pleasant way. Simple Chinese food made in the tastiest way. Succulent chicken, fresh fish & fragrant fried rice won our hearts. And what's best is, it is very very affordable. We are definitely ordering again. Keep it up!
