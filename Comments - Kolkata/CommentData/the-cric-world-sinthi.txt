This is a very underrated place due to its location... although it serves good food but the service is a bit unprofessional. 
The location is not so great and the ambience is average.
You can give it a try if you are really hungry near sinthi area.

Very very underrated place. Probably because of the location.
Offers u lip-smacking food in a very comfortable atmospheric. I don't know of any other place where u can enjoy ur food while sitting cross-legged on faux grass.
The staff is polite and courteous.
And the food! It's just delightful! I personally feel Indian cuisine is their forte. The quantity is more  than satisfactory for the bill they charge.
I would very much recommend this place for a relaxed lunch or dinner.

I found this one to be the most comfy restaurant in Baranagar area. I would have given it 5 rating. But due to the price range I have given it 4.

We were full and actually looking for some appetizers. We destined for another place that day but because of that place was closed that day we came up here and ordered only starter. Chicken malai kabab and crispy Chicken. Both the items were too good. I will definitely visit again to have their main courses and desserts.

First of all, the restaurant isn't located at Sinthi or Sinthirmore (and it's not opposite the famous Sinthi Circus ground either). It's location has been aptly pointed out in some reviews. The entrance is adjacent to a garbage dump (gross!) and you need to climb a steep flight of stairs to get to the actual restaurant. If the main restaurant is full they let you sit at the top floor which is just a small hall with plastic tables and chairs. The restaurant itself is simply decorated with strange seating arrangements; a majority of the seating is devoted to lounging but not all guests are there to lounge. Having said that their service is decent and the food acceptable. Sadly, they do not serve any continental dishes most of the times (so, may be it's time to update their menu).

Not exactly what the name suggests

Ambience: Located on BT road near the Sinthi Crossing just opposite the Sinthi maidan, this restaurant had grabbed a lot of attention when it opened. Once we even had to return because the place was full. However, the day we got the chance to dine there, we were informed that the main floor is booked for some birthday party, so we had to sit on the upper floor. The upper floor had absolutely nothing related to cricket. A large Tv screen was placed with vengaboys songs playing. Standard table and chairs were placed and nothing special was there that suggested anything about the name Cric World.

Food: We ordered Tandoori murgh and Chicken Chopsuey. The tandoori murgh that came was dry and hard. The chicken seemed to have been cooked a day before. Salad along with the tandoori was only onions and nothing else. Next came the chicken chopsuey. The chopsuey was nothing like a chopsuey. It was plain mixed gravy noodles. Even the signature omlet was absent. Food quality was so so disappointing. I mean why even bother to put an item in the menu if they can’t even cook that item!!

Service: Service was worthless. Had to get up from the table and walk to the bar to call a waiter to give water every time. Cash n card was accepted. Parking was available in front of the restaurant. 

Overall: Visit at your own risk. Even restaurants like Banjara and Capnil gives better food and services than them.

But I didn't like the seating arrangement.

Nice ambience,sitting arrangement is two good.nice place to hangout with your friends.well decor,staffs are really cooperative,well mannered,prompt service.now the main part is food.their Indian cuisines are good,but Chinese are disaster.we ordered the following foods:-
Crispy chicken- it's really crispy n good in taste
Gandhraj Mahi Tikka- good in taste
Tangdi Kebab- don't try ,it was terribly bad
Drums of heaven- it would be better named as Drums of hell.Plsssss don't try this.
Malai tikka- good in taste
Veg Fried rice- I got confused whether it was a veg fried rice or it was a peas pulao.
Chicken 65 gravy- it was a disaster.those who had chicken 65 in other places they will actually forget the taste.
So my suggestion for the foodie's is don't try their Chinese item except crispy chicken,rather go for Indians .& My request to the management team please try to improve the food quality.there are very few restaurants from dunlop to sinthi area & like me other people were also happy when we found such a well decor restaurant in this area but if you people don't improve the food quality then it will be big loss for foodie's like us.

The ambience is quite good.. u can sit cross-legged, relax and watch matches. I went there basically to try their chicken sizzler, but to my bad, they didn't have anything continental, even though it was weekend. They didn't even have most of the drinks written on the menu. So, after a while, we ordered fresh lime soda, chicken gravy noodles, hong kong rice and black pepper chicken. The food was quite good. But they take ages to serve. We got our food atleast after half n hour to 45 mins. Also, they did a blunder on the bill. We ordered a single rice, but they put that as 3. Luckily I noticed it. So be careful before you pay and make sure you ordered all the food written at the bill. Though they promptly adjusted their mistake. Apart from that, a good place. My boyfriend loved the place, as he could watch his game without me nagging for taking me out.

A multicuisine restaurant located near the baranagar thana. The ambience is good. The seating arrangements are comfortable and spacious. There is a separate room style arrangement for larger groups. In another section the seating arrangement is done in such way that you and sit flat on the faux grass floor and enjoy the meal in utter comfort. Dining table seating arrangement is also available. The quantity provided is large. The only drawback is that the service is delayed. And the quantity of food provided in home delivery facility is less than that provided in dine in.

The place has a very good decor given the location it's in, interiors are well planned.
We went during on Navami, ordered a crispy chilo baby corn, mixed noodles and garlic chicken. The baby corn was crispy, had a strong likeable ginger flavour. The noodles lacked salt, however had less than decent amount of flesh, enough veggies though. The garlic chicken was pathetic, the chicken pieces were uneven in sizes and had a thick coating, felt disastrous to my taste buds.
The misery didn't end here. I was overcharged ₹10 extra for the noodles, which I got corrected and then to top it all, the balance I received was had ₹10 less. The restaurant seemed to lack proper administration and must be improved upon. Very poor experience.


Recommended: Don't venture into their Chinese, it's as poor as it gets. Sarson Mahi Tikka is one lovely dish they prepare

Good food and ambiance at reasonable price is everything a foodie can desire for. The milkshakes are awesome and so is the mojito (non alcoholic). The afghan chicken as starter is mild amd tasty. Tanfoor can spice up the taste. I would suggest trying mutton hafna in main course besides chicken bharta. They accept sodexo coupons. They have a great lounge where cricket matches can be watched ad enjoyed with friends. They are thinking about opening a bar as well.

We ordered food from the restaurant some days before. We had ordered chicken reshmi tikka masala, fried rice and paneer lababdar. Fried rice was hard and footpath style. Paneer was so so. But the chicken reshmi masala was so bad that we couldn't eat it. We didn't expect that bad quality from a restaurant like that. This is not our first time, this was our 2nd time experience. We are very disappointed.

We went to The Cric World yesterday for dinner. Each and every item was delicious. The staff was extremely courteous and well behaved. Infact, they made us feel at home. Excellent service. I will highly recommend this place. The ambience is fantastic. Undoubtedly, the best restaurant in the area.

The place has a very good decor given the location it's in, interiors are well planned.
We went during on Navami, ordered a crispy chilo baby corn, mixed noodles and garlic chicken. The baby corn was crispy, had a strong likeable ginger flavour. The noodles lacked salt, however had less than decent amount of flesh, enough veggies though. The garlic chicken was pathetic, the chicken pieces were uneven in sizes and had a thick coating, felt disastrous to my taste buds.
The misery didn't end here. I was overcharged ₹10 extra for the noodles, which I got corrected and then to top it all, the balance I received was had ₹10 less. The restaurant seemed to lack proper administration and must be improved upon. Very poor experience.


Recommended: Don't venture into their Chinese, it's as poor as it gets. Sarson Mahi Tikka is one lovely dish they prepare

Good food and ambiance at reasonable price is everything a foodie can desire for. The milkshakes are awesome and so is the mojito (non alcoholic). The afghan chicken as starter is mild amd tasty. Tanfoor can spice up the taste. I would suggest trying mutton hafna in main course besides chicken bharta. They accept sodexo coupons. They have a great lounge where cricket matches can be watched ad enjoyed with friends. They are thinking about opening a bar as well.

**Location = Located at Ghoshpara, on the 1st floor of CESC office.

** Brief = Have visited the place quite often being very close to my residence. They do not accept cards(as per my last visit)

**Ambiance = The ambiance is the one thing which attracts loads of people. A big place with a large screen to view cricket matches/other sports and enjoy your food, a great combo.

**Things tried = Tandoori Chicken, Crispy Chilly Baby Corn(one of my favourites), Murg Malai Tikka, Schezwan Fried Rice(Chicken),Chicken 65, Hong kong Chicken, Hot Garlic Fish.

I have tried mostly the chinese items here and they prepare their dishes with great dedication and the servers are always very attentive. Though they take a bit longer than usual to serve their food, but the large screen and the sitting arrangement makes up for it.
**Recommended = Crispy Chilly Baby Corn, Murg Malai Tikka, Hot Garlic Fish.

** Purse Check = Rs.700 for 2 people would be enough.

** Overall = I have not gorged on their Indian and Continental dishes with much precision. Hopefully going to taste them soon. Cheers :)

This one is located at ghospara stoppage near sinthi.. A place known for its ambience.. Nd i would giv a 10out of 10 for it! Very comfy seating arrangements wd good staffs . coming to the food. We ordered fresh lime soda, crispy chicken, crispy baby corn, hongkong fried rice , chicken 65 and tutty fruity.. Crispy chicken tasted d best whereas babycorn was little too spicy .. Fried rice nd chicken 65 was nice.. Most of d items in the menu card are not available nd d staffs don seem to ever  heard bout "chopsuey" although varieties of d same are added in d menu card wch ws realy surprising... Nd none of d continental items r available... To make it short nice place for hangout .. Nd d foods available r worth eating !

The cric world is located at sinthi more. The exterior is not so appealing but the interior decor is lovely. The ambience is fabulous. Its an all n all chill out place with friends. Coming to the food. The zomato menu is not what they provide there. We went for chinese. For starters we ordered crispy chicken which was delicious. A bit sweet but delicious nonetheless. For mains we had ordered schezwan rice,mixed noodles,hot garlic chicken n chicken 65. There was a major problem with the chicken 65. We had found a hair in it. The waiters then n there gave a fresh dish though. Coming to the taste the schezwan rice lacked seasoning. But hot garlic was good. And the noodles n chicken 65 also tasted good. The starters though took 20 mins time to come. I would suggest go for Indian menu in this restaurant.  The waiters could not even recommend a proper dish. The waiters looked confused but were helpful. But its a must visit for all. To enjoy the ambience.

From Dunlop to Sinthi one would find at least seven restaurants more or less well known. The Cric World , although very new,  has already made itself established.  I have been there for four times. But the latest incident that happened within the past two days made me determined to recommend this restaurant to the other customers and to write this  review. Certainly, I would visit Cric World again and again:

On 5th of July, I visited the restaurant along with two of my family member and had Garlic Prawn (dry)  as starter. We all appreciated the item. Later after having dinner I also packed a few items for my parents at home. To our surprise, we found, hot garlic prawn, one of the items that we brought home is unpalatable. Immediately we called up the Manager of the Cric World and he , after hearing the incident,  promised to send us a freshly prepared dry garlic prawn. We also ordered a cric world special veg hakka chowmin along with it. It took one hour to deliver the items to my home. The delivery boy was very humble and well behaved and to my surprise refused to accept tips to compensate for  the late arrival and mistake they had committed in cooking . 

They next day we tested the items that were kept in the freezer. The prawn item was again repugnant had a bad odour. This time the cric world special veg hakka chowmin was not so special. We got disheartened and in the evening called up the Manager  again stating him the problem in detail. To my surprise,  this time the Manager himself came to deliver the items. I was just overwhelmed the way he tackled the problem. Not only the Cric World  compensated us but also honoured their customers in an exemplary way. Rest of the restaurants in this locality and beyond should learn manners and quality of service from the Cric World.

Some pros and cons about this restaurant. 

Pros: 1)  Chinese and Indian foods are better.

           2)  Ambiance is good.

           3) Service quality is very good.

Cons: 1) Not all the items listed in the menu card are available 

            2) The tables in the back side, where one is supposed sit with folded legs, are of discomforting heights at least for the ladies and aged persons.

           3) Also aged person can not seat on that (folded leg sitting or lean on the wall)section of the restaurant.

           4) Debit or credit card is not accepted.

This restaurant is located at sinthi more, on the 1st floor of cesc office. As the name suggests it is a cricket themed restaurant.
There's a giant screen to watch matches during different cricket tournaments. Seating arrangement is quite nice. It's like a stadium.
Been there 2-3 times. It's not fully open yet. Continental dishes are on the menu but actually not available. About food quality Chinese dishes are below average but Indian dishes are quite good. Fish malai tikka is worth mentioning.

I visited this place few weeks back and I would start by saying that the interior design is a very welcome move by the management. It is airy, refreshing and spacious, at least when compared to all other restaurants in this area. 
The food was really good with sufficient quantity and up to the mark quality. The cheese garlic Naan was awesome and so was the soup. But the stellar dish was chicken Bharta,  very nicely cooked and has juicy chunks of chicken. 
Suggestion for improvement : please try to start offering continental items.

This is a recent food joint in Baranagar area, the first of its kind in the region. The interiors, decor and ambience are perfect. These factors play a crucial role in drawing customers to a restaurant..but what next? The food ofcourse..to keep customers visiting again the food has to be good. I have been here twice, once with my friend and the second time with my family..the second time being not because I liked it the first time but I wanted to give the place a second chance to satiate my tastebuds. I have tried both chinese and north indian but none of the dishes were that good to move it to the next level. The staffs working here don't seem to be prompt in action. It takes quite sometime for the staffs to come and welcome their guests and handover the menucard. The standard serving time after placing a order should be 20mins but here they take double of the time. Simple items such as fresh lime soda are not served during peak hours. The chefs as well as the staffs need to go that extra mile to make it a success. They should be good at managing guests during peak hours and service should be prompt. If continental items are not served then please remove them from the menucard. Cric world needs to go a long way to make it a success. Its a good start up but then lacks a lot from the gastronomic point of view. All the best.
P.S. - I would have rated it as 2.5 but giving the extra 0.5 for the decor and to promote it.

Yes, the ambience is one of the best that I've ever seen. I mean this is the only place where you can have your food by 'Paa Gutiye Boshe' 'Babu Hoye Boshe'
Though there are option for normal sitting arrangements as well, but there is a big screen where there will be cricket streaming (though it was WWE when we went there) but 
'Matite Paa Mele Boshe Chinese Khabar Mojatai Aladaa' That is the best part. Food I'd say can be a lot better.
We ordered for Drums if Heaven which is a chicken starter. It tested yum but the chicken was not at all fresh. 
Kulcha and Naan was good. The crispy baby corn was not 'Crisp' and the Alur Dam was too rich.

If the food was good or perhaps a bit better my rating would be 4.5!!!

#TheCricWorld - If you're reading this please make your food quality a bit better and I would then highly recommend this to everyone which is located on B. T. Road near Sinthee more.

We had kashimiri pulao, kashmiri naan, butter naan, garlic naan, biryani, chicken bharta, and some mutton roghanjosh. The food standards were okay, and service is decent. But very good place as a sports bar.. Psst. a bar with no alcohol.

Till when the food was not served I was thinking of inviting all my friends here. Interesting seating arrangements. But after having the food I dropped the idea.. Not sure if the quality of food deteriorated recently because of Puja.. But the except the mocktail nothing I found good there..

This new resturant is situated at the top of the CESC office, Ghoshpara. First coming to the decor...it is awesome and interesting. A very good place for hangout with friends. The environment here is very relaxing and is like home. The setting is like a cricket gallery,a big tv screen is fitted on the wall where cricket matches are shown. Now coming to the food...it is average...the mixed fried rice they serbe is good. Staffs are good.

We visited this restaurent on the auspicious day of Mahalaya and it is situated at one minute drive from Sinthee More ( opposite Disha Eye Hospital).

We were not expecting anything great in terms of food and service as it was recently opened only on 15th Aug 2015.

Overall experience was good, they have probably the best decor in that part of the city giving it a lounge cum restaurent look. The way sitting arrangement was done in 1st floor with giant screen, bar and a place where u can relax and have food just like a bed, I was wondering that they must be awaiting their alcohol licence but the owner confirmed that they want to keep this way with no plans to serve alcohol.

Now some quick pros and cons -

Pros 
1. Very good ambience
2. Nice decor and atlast a good restaurent for people staying near Sinthee
3. Quality of food was decent ( being vegetarian we tried their paneer Sikh kabab, soup, fried rice, Hakka chowmein and chilly paneer)
4. Owner was very friendly and continuously taking feedback

Cons
1. Very bad smell at the entry due to open drainage system in front
2. No security at the entrance to guide us where to park the car etc. The front of the restaurent can be made more visually appealing.
3. We tried calling from Zomato but nobody picked the call if after trying for 15 minutes. I don't know why but I was charged for those call as the call was diverted. I brought this issue to the owner and he handed me the menu for home delivery with some mobile numbers.
4. Service needs to improve a lot in case they want to compete with their competitors in the south.
5. Continental and desserts were not available which they want to start along with breakfast post puja.

My final verdict is it is a must go specially for people residing in Sinthee, tobin road, Baranagar, Chiriyamore etc. As we finally have a decent restaurent. I plan to visit them as and when they start their breakfast service.

Nice ambience and service. The taste and quantity of the food is mediocre. It is a bit pricey with respect to taste. A bar would be nice in this ambience

North kolkata faces a dearth of true lounge experience compared to the South..but that seems to be taken care of by Cric World..the ambience and atmosphere depicts that of a sports lounge with a giant projector screen showcasing the latest in sports throughout the day..on match days its a big bonus as it will draw the sport frenzy crowd..the bar is yet not open bt everything seems  to be in place..me and my gf ordered mushroom pepper dry and roasted chicken chilly for starters..the meal was really tasty but the quantity could have been a bit more to our liking..the hospitality is good..the main draw must be the seating arrangement..u can literally spread out your arms and legs in a comfy bed like spread..we finished out meal with mango and strawberry shakes..its truly refreshing and delightful..👍🏻 to the management for bringing such a great experience for north kolkatans..keep up the good work!..

Went to this place on 3rd october 2015 with family. Ambience was very good. We had north indian vegeterian food. The food too tasted good especially black daal. Overall a good experience. The price was in mid segment, not too costly.

First of all full marks to ambience 10/10, food is good here but the only thing that is worrying about is staff service otherwise everything is good and really it is surprising to have a restaurant like this on b.t. road.

Good Restaurant...with awesome ambiance.. went out with colleagues after a long tiring working day @ ofc... the long sofa type sitting arrangement took away the fatigues... good food (though a bit spicy n hot for few dishes)...friendly hosts as well. Overall rating by me would be 3 out of 5.. Could go far if quantity is revised as per price...

First impressions: decor- wow, seating- wow. These 2 r d first things u will notice wen u enter this restro. Forget couch.... for the lazy/lethargic/lyadh public's this s d place. We went there fr lunch. The citrus cooler and blue lagoon drinks r average but the virgin mojito is good. Dont go for green apple mojito and pineapple crush. The roasted chicken chilly, mutton rogan josh is good and the chicken tikka was very good. Biriyani was average but the egg noodles was good. I would refrain from the idea of ordering fried rice here. I was disappointed because their continental dishes were not available.

This place has recently opened up and many people don't even know of it yet. First of all when you enter, the first thing that hits you is the decor. It's rare to see such a fancy restaurant in the B.T.Road area. The boithok-khana like seating arrangement, the big screen projector where they show matches... it all blew my mind. The staff is also extremely well-mannered and paid special attention to each patron.
Coming to the food... have only been here once but will surely be coming back again!! We had ordered cheese balls and mushroom starters... both were delicious! They only thing that upset me was such good food but the quantity of starters was too less. However, the main course more than filled us up... so can't complain. They also have a huge range of continental dishes one can try which you don't get anywhere nearby. And if u are there, do try the Tutti-Fruity ice cream.

I always felt there are no good restaurants on B.T road..but this newly opened restaurant is like a gift for the inhabitants of this area. The Ambience is quite awesome and the quality of food they serve is also very good.
Menu is quite huge and variety of mocktails are available. Since the restaurant is new, i hv been there twice and tried veg items as well as non veg items. They were delicious and drink was also refreshing. Overall this is the best restaurant i hv been to among the restaurants present on long bt road.
U should try it.
