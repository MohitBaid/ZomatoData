It was with my friends on navami afternoon

Awesome lunch served

We ordered
1. Veg thali
2. Mutton kosa
3. Chicken kosa
4. Chatni

When it comes to the greatest festival of bengal its a sure thing we like to eat bengali food.

The food quality was exclusive
The veg thali consisted of ALU POSTO, DAL AND STEEMED RICE. The alu posto was unique and the dal was also real tasty.
The came the showstopper MUTTON KOSA AND CHICKEN KOSA
Both were vry good regarding the price
The mutton pieces literally melted inside our mouths and the chicken were a bit hard but tasted real good.
All meals require a perfect ending which came with the chatni which was exclusive. It tasted just like my mother makes in home.

Its not a highly rated place but if u r a bit low on your pocket and want tasty yet reasonable priced food congo u have found one.

Will surely be coming back next year
Same day same time same venue same friends

Heard a lot abt its biriyani n mutton chaap. Finally had it and it's worth the praise . Biriyani was super aromatic n mutton chaap was oily n juicy as it should be . A must have but yes work out the extra oil n fats u intake

Start with location : Near Shyanbazer Tram depo (Fariapukur).

Since my childhood I am fan of this Dhaba (restaurant), just because of Tadka and Rumali roti.

Not so cleaned but there foods are finger licking,
Staff are friendly Open till midnight (depends on stocks)

Recommendations
Tadka( authentic)
Mutton Tikkia
Chicken Chap
Rumali Roti

These all you will get in evening.

As they sell normal Bengali food for lunch.

Get parcel that will be a good choice rather eating there. 3* only for food.

Authentic Bengali cuisine from both sides of Bengal and in very original price. Really value for money, awesome formalities. Every bite is finger licking and presentation is that good too. Ambience is a negative because of its small place but overall very intuitive.

Hotel priya is situated in shyam bazar,kolkata. Serves all kinds of cuisines. My favourite us the bengali food that they serve. Starting from vetki machher paturi, chingri machher malaikari, shak, ilish machher bhapa... i can go on all day with the delicious menu. If u are a bengali and have not tasted fish from here, then my friend you are at a loss! This place is a small restaurant with very little place to sit and eat, and even then the amount of rush you can see during any normal weekday is just phenomenal. This just proves that even though the ambience is not the kind people would prefer, the quality of food out-stands everything else. A must must must visit for all the foodies. Enjoy the food at home or sit there itself and relish! Dont forget to ask for the chatniðŸ˜œ

Yesterday I was shopping in Hatibagan area and Suddenly I found this non-ac food joint out of no where. Anyway it was pretty much crowded when I got there. In one word its a "pice hotel", just like in old calcutta. They had so many things to offer on their menu. Apart from plain rice & daal, plenty of fish items were there. I ordered rice, daal and "Doi Rui".
Food items were great in taste and the pieces of fish were gigantic. My tummy was filled with happiness.
As it was in noon I cannot comment on the food items of evening. Within Rs. 130/- my lunch was done, so its pocket friendly one too.
I would definitely recommend people to go to this place and have a nice and warm meal, but if you are looking for sitting comfort or brand then its not the right place for you.

Just a pati bhaat er hotel with all the kinds of items in their menu. Their chaap is horrible as well as thier chicken kassa. Roomali roti is highseller because its cheap and thin.I hate their location since its always crowded. Havnt tried their rice and other items so cant comment on that. I dont recommend anybody to go to this place.

Very small food joint. Suitable for takeaway. Mainly specializes in Bengali food during lunch time with all authentic Bengali dishes available. Food is oily and spicy and that's why tasty. From evening they start preparing biryani, tarka, chicken chap and side dishes of chicken and mutton only. No fish items are available in the night. Rumali roti and double egg butter tarka is very good. Biryani was good few years back but now they have compromised a lot on quality. Size of the mutton and quality is not good at all.
All other items are average and nothing extraordinary. It's a typical small scale restaurant which will be very friendly on your pocket but at the cost of very spicy and oily food. Ambience is not good for dine in.

Very old type hotel. Almost packed crowd through out the day. Situated in a prime location near Shyambazar. Just in the opposite lane of Talkieshow House. Serving people for long time with quality and pocket friendly prices. They serve mainly Bengali dishes like Rice, Fish, Chicken, Mutton etc. Take away facility I available. Lately they also use to serve Rumali Roti, Chana Masala, Paneer Butter Masala, Biriyani etc. Due to its emmense popularity the lane often use to call Priya Gali.

This is my worst experience ever in a restaurant... If u can call it so. They have no queue system for seating guests. U have to wrestle to get a seat. The owner and the serving boys use filthy and derogatory language. On one instance, I was told by the owner that i must maintain a queue and he has no such responsibility as such. Also a senior citizen standing beside me was revised admission arbitrarily. To add to this, when I requested the owner to at least behave properly, he started hurling abuses and threatened me that he won't serve food to me... As if I was a Beggar at his door. He even threatened to beat me up. This is perhaps the most horrendous restaurant or rather roadside eatery I have ever had. If anyone of u care for your self respect, never ever visit this place. And yes, the do serve stale fish.. I u do dare to reach the table

Worst hotel I ever visited till now. I must say they don't have proper manner to treat customer....the cashier or service boy don't know the menu items properly. Now come to the food, nothing exceptional, the mutton chap was full of dalda...although rumali roti was good enough....for small take away containers they charged 10/- per container, it is not acceptable at all....I will not recommend this hotel unless don't have much choices.

Only con about this place is there sitting arrangement too crowdy it's like your Chingrir Sur may land on someone else's plate ewwww. If you plan for a takeaway then it's the best pocket friendly  delicious Bengali resto you would ever come across.

It's situated in a galli just opposite to the Aminia, Fariapukur. It's one of those good old 'paise' hotels in Kolkata. During afternoon they serve varieties of Bengali dishes to relish. Banana leaf and earthen pot of water(vanr) welcome you at the table. Then rice, dal, bhaja and macher matha die bandhakopi (Cabbage with fish head) remind me of thakuma-didimar hater ranna. Ah wonderful if you ever have lost between languages. And the mutton curry. 4 decent sized pieces of juicy mutton make my day. Extra rice...to complement with...

Located in fariapukur. Hotel priya is serving local husbands with food for a long time when his wife is not in a mood to cook :p not recommended to have a dine-in as the seating arrangement is not good, fine for take aways. They also serve till late nights around 12:30-1pm so when nothing is available we try priya hotel. Try out the egg tadka, mutton chap and romali roti, u'll be satisfied.

The final lunch of the tour and we decided to visit this joint . It turned out to be a good choice indeed . We wanted to try biryani but unfortunately they told us it is available only in the evening past 6. But we still decided to have a go at whatever they had for lunch and ended up eating Fish and Rice with bhaja and dal. It was a treat ,  enjoyed it  totally . Thank you Zomato.

Good food. Reasonable price. Comes in a generous quantity. Delicious. 
I guess, the bengali food here is to die for. People have a thing for its North Indian delights too. But I cannot really tell you about it. We had ordered rice, daal, mutton, prawns and some vegetable curries here, all of which were savory! Although the place is a little shabby and cramped up and in dire need of a renovation, the food nailed it big time!

As a child, I would literally rave about their Ruhi posto, biryani and mutton kasha. I cannot describe how tasty they'd make it. But it is a thing of the past now. After years, I tried the same items from this joint last week and I was beyond disappointed. The 2 point rating? A faint hope that they will bounce back to their previous glory.

Chicken n mutton items r ok type,but fishes r more preferable. For dinner,muttin tikia n romali ruti r must try....n quality of mutton biriyani is comparable to Arsalan easily. all BHETO BANGALI' should try d foods....but u ll b comfortable wid home delivery,u cant sit n eat properly n peacefully in rush hours.

This place was a life saver during Choturthi when it was the only place available at 12 at night.
The place was packed,the ambience typical of an eatery.
Ordered chicken bharta,roomali roti and chicken kasha. The quantity of bharta was very less compared to the 170 rs they charged us for it. The food tasted okayish.
Overall,not worth going in my opinion.

Being a biriyani gourmet means that you end up trying the dish from various odd joints. And sometimes you are pleasantly surprised indeed. Hotel Priya has made sure that its biriyani remains top class for the 20 odd years that I have been frequenting it. There is no presence of ambience. It is a local joint where you can have your regular rice and dal too. So I would strongly recommend takeaways. The chicken chap and tikia are also a worthy mention.
If you are in this part of the town, do give Hotel Priya a try.

This is one shitty place to eat considering the sitting arrangements which are not comfy at all , their staff group is full of children which is not very welcome at all and goes all the way against the rule of child labor. This place is best for take away. 
But still after all of that negativity, I have rated this place a 3.5 just because their taste in food. Their Chanp (Both Mutton & Chicken), Tikias are absolutely like a piece of heaven. I haven't checked out their Bengali menu though. The Biriyani they serve and the piece of meat therewith is also of good quality. Over the last decade I've been eating at this eatery and I'd say that their food quality hasn't got decreased any bit, and they are very popular among the neighborhood. 
If you are in a light mood to enjoy good food with friends or alone this place won't disappoint you.
P.S. They don't charge any tax or vat either and this place is non-AC of course. They Serve different menu for lunch and dinner and though it is written here in Zomato that this place opens at around 6 pm, which they may do, but still I must caution you that you won't get their special Tikias and Chanp till 7 pm. So visit a little late.
Hope this little neighborhood eatery surprises you in a good way.

The Description: If u wanna eat Real Bengali food... Come to this place... They really make some good finger licking Bengali dishes.. Before the Hatinagan market at the fariapukur.Â I often take parcel from here.Â 

The Ambience: Its a small hotel type with limited seats.

The Food: Mutton is very Tasty and so as the Prawn items.... U may also go for the Fish items.. There food will make you feel like home.Â All the items are not available everyday and everytime.. it depends on the day what they make....

The Conclusion: Â But overall its a very good place to eat a Bengali Flavor...

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
