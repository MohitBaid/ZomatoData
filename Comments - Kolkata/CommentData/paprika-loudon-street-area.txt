Ordered a sour cherry and hazelnut dark chocolate cake. They did a wonderful job of it, improvising with regular cherries. Staff was efficient and easy to deal with.

We had ordered for home delivery. The best item was ravioli with pesto sauce!!! It was next level. Also ordered Penang curry and seven layer baked nachos. In dessert ordered a unique item called chocolate ball. It was the first time we experienced such a crazy rise crisp dessert insider a chocolate ball.

Great service, awesome food, and lovely presentation. Whether it be its delivery service or its catering Paprika delivers on all fronts. Paprika gets a 5 on 5 from me.

I just went to a party, the food was great, I had to fins out where it was sourced from and it was Paprika.

Well it was just really well made, sounded and tasted like a great personal catering solution for those small parties at home, over a great match or movie.
But the host did have something to say about the price, a bit on the higher side, but again, haven't ordered from here yet, just eaten the food.
