Pretty average place... I didn't liked the ambience of the place... deco was not at all attractive... service was very very slow... nothing to say about their staffs... all I can ignore if the food they served was good... but unfortunately the it was very bad... we tried their special chowmin n chicken with mushrooms... pocket pinch was ok...

Konica Restaurant is situated beside Lokosanskiti Bhavan at sodepur.... I tried there Konica Special Chowmin & Chicken with Mushroom.... Both tasted very average.... They provided total two nos mushroom in the side dish (Chicken with Mushroom) .... Ambiance and Interior deco was not eye catching.... Staffs are friendly but serving time was too slow.... Cost was ok...

Childhood favourite restaurant! For the most juicy and tasty chicken dishes they served. Over the years lot has changed, including the upspringing of many restaurants in its vicinity, which has dented its market badly. Quite a small place there, but the food served is good!

The price is certainly cheap here, so is the food quality. We felt the quality is below average. We had actually went for home delivery from here. The minimum order amount was 300/-. 
A simple suggestion to the restaurant management would be: make your food tasty, you won't have to worry about the minimum order amount. ;)

It is really cheap here but the food quality is below average. It is just like a normal restaurant to hit on when you are on a budget...

Wrong address given. It is in Sodepur. Not in Barrackpore.
