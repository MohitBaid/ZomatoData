Biriyani taste fluctuates and you cannot be guaranteed, but the quantity is at quite sufficient.
Heard the rolls are flavoursome, shall try soon enough

Rumaan the name of the restaurantâ€‹ has been derived from the Persian word 'Excellence'. From the name itself gives one an idea about the type of environment to expect. Friendly Staff gives you a feeling of exclusivity and the service is top-notch. Higly recommend to the people who 'demand' authentic Dhaba-like experience.

I have always loved this idea of open air dining!! Rumaan is a great place for Mughlai lovers and it will not disappoint your unending love for kebabs too. The service is pretty good and even if its not speedy, its worth the wait. We had tandoori chicken, mutton biriyani but my favourite was malai reshmi kebab. Its just delicious! So if your looking for a place to gorge in scrumptious mughlai cuisine, Rumaan is the place for you!
