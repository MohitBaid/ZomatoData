Finally we got ourselves our own Hard Rock! So we had to try it as early as possible. I've been to the Bangalore and Hyderabad HRC's and this one didn't fail to amaze me either. We'd ordered

Mac n cheese- It was super cheesy and creamy and very filling.
Chicken Texan sandwich- This tasted amazing but wouldn't be enough for one person.
Atomic chicken burger- Again heavenly

Grilled Jamaican pulled chicken- This wasn't anything liked all the grilled chicken I've had elsewhere. The uniquely done mashed potato side made it very different from the others and made it taste great.

Last but not the least, we ordered the hot fudge brownie and homemade apple cobbler both of which were out of the world. 

So, I'd recommend everyone to visit this place at least once and for me, I'd love to go there every month. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Awesome electrifying ambiance with a live DJ playing music video on a biiig screen. The servers are too good and they interact with you just like friends. We ordered pasta and grilled chicken. Both were superlative. The cocktail suggested by the restaurant guy was also good. The crowd was young and the music was foot tapping. We definitely had a good time.

Awesome food and amazing ambience. I visited 2 days after the cafe opened its doors. And visited again 3 days later. The music took me back to the rocking 90s which was great. The food is pricey but tasty. Would go back again.

Been there and do feel that food is not up to the mark. I have ordered Mac and cheese. It tasted like I am having pasta with fine flour. This is my 4th visit to any HRC(Bangalore,LA & MN) and I‚Äôm a big fan of American food.
Coming to the positive part and the service and ambiance of the restaurant will surely wow you. You will get some common vive of music around there.
Overall it‚Äôs a good place to hang out but unfortunately there are many better places out there.

Their Original Legendary Burger! 
A juicy 1 Lb Beef burger topped with smoked Bacon, Cheddar cheese, golden fried onion rings, crisp lettuce & tomato. 
The Burger was great & heavy ,perfect for one person's dinner/lunch. 
They have a very lively atmosphere and it felt like a really nice place to chill with some really good quality music playing all the time.

One of the most anticipated restaurants which Kolkata welcomed last year,Hard Rock lives up to it‚Äôs name.First and foremost the most beautiful feature of Hard Rock is it‚Äôs ambience,I fell in love with it.The cafe gives us all those American vibes where people go on to have drinks with their friends in the weekend nights and enjoy live music or watch live football matches on the big screen.Hard Rock has got all those elements and this restaurant just made me remember my dad because he loves music and this restaurant is full of it.Now coming to the food,we order pork bbq ribs or which was seasoned by their homemade hickory sauce.Ok I never had hickory sauce before tbh I never knew something like this existed so after having it,I could feel that the money was all worth it because the pork literally melted in my mouth and that sauce tasted amazing.It was neither too spicy nor too sweet,just having the perfect blend of flavours.I am so going to have those ribs when I visit Hard Rock again :3‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Then we ordered their original legendary burger which is their specialty.Ok I found the taste of this burger to be a bit bland because their were no flavours in it though the onion rings which were inside it tasted delicious though they could have been more crispy.
Lastly for desert we ordered hot fudge brownie and this thing came in such a giant glass it almost looked liked it was a trophy cup full of brownies and ice cream :3 It is quite impressive of them that they actually concentrated on presenting a very very soft and goey brownie which I don‚Äôt expect from restaurants in general because most of the cakes or brownies which doesn‚Äôt fall in their cuisine,taste like rubbish.So yes hot fudge brownie impressed me and how.You cannot complete that huge glass of goodness all by yourself so you have to share with your dear ones.Like I could feel that I cannot eat more of it but I wanted to continue so badly :‚Äô‚Äô3
Lastly the price is a bit on the higher side because the bill came out to be Rs 3300 for two of us but believe me it‚Äôs worth it.
Hard Rock is worth all the hype.Go there for it‚Äôs ambience,it‚Äôs music and obviously the food :)

A place worthy of visiting! The giant global cafe chain finally landed in Kolkata and we couldn‚Äôt wait for it. Terrific Ambience. Will keep you rock n roll all the time. Awesome food. I would be short of adjectives if I start describing this place. Nice decor. Will definitely live upto your expectations with which we all visit Hard Rock cafe. There is even a store in the ground floor with rocking tees and accessories. Budget tip: Do try the jumbo combo platter. It will suffice two easily.

We actually visited this place on the eve of Christmas.I dint get time to pen down the reviews for a while due to busy schedule.Anyways time to analyze the every aspect of this cafe~
Food~
1.Classic Legendary Burger~Tasted good
2.Chicken Wings~Tasted delicious
Drinks~
1.Ordered two mocktails~Sorry for forgetting the names of both but both tasted amazing.
Quantity and Quality ~
Both quantity and quality wise the drinks and food are served in right proportion with proper quantity and quality.The food being properly cooked.
Presentation ~
The food and drinks are both presented in a very appealing way.
Behavior of staffs~
They are very polite and all are dressed up in a very rocking style.They will also interact with you once you enter HRC.
Now finally coming to the most talked about thing,the ambience~
HRC has got a rocking ambience which will really boost your energy.They have got live music facility and also rest of the time they play EDM too which is a treat to the ears.Right from the music to lights to the interior decor this place will surely amaze you.
Value for money~
Now if you want to enjoy your food in a rocking ambience you have to shell out some extra expenses.
Now coming to the overall verdict~
I really loved this place a hell lot and once you visit this place you will surely have a lively time.However when I visited this place I tried to order desserts which weren't available,neither half of the food items also.And they weren't serving alcohols also.I have rated it four just coz half of the food items weren't available at that time which highly disappointed me.
  So do visit this place once and I am sure you won't be disappointed at all.

Food on the plate: To be very frank I didn't like what they initially served which was a dull pizza. But after that  Mac n cheese and cocktails were good. Legendary burger was a good show but was okay okay in taste. 4/5

Decorations: the restaurant is nicely decorated  .From guitar of guns n roses to hat of Elton John to dress of Nicky Minaj. This place has it all. They have a souvenir shop at downstairs which has great collection of HRC stuffs but bit pricy. 5/5

Ambience: No one can match the ambience that Hard Rock cafe creates, and that is the only reason why it is Hard Rock Cafe. Great music coupled with Flash mob dance from their staffs can't be ignored. 5/5

Cost: cost is on the higher side. If you want to just have a drink and a burger and enjoy great music. Have a Walk through a pop museum, experience pop culture, then it is a must go. But if you want to party hard, I mean drink to the neck then you must definitely take your credit card along with your debit card. 4/5

My first visit to any pub in Kolkata.
I had visited Hard Rock Cafe Bangalore earlier. Compare to Bangalore , This place needs a lot of improvements.
Most of the drinks are unavailable as Hard Rock Cafe Kolkata was operating on Daily Liquor Licence. The ambiance is poor as local bands are not performing. Only few gigs are happening. 
But the food was awesome as usual. We were served by Firoz and he had done everything from his side to make us happy. Please try Pork Rib over there.

There has been a huge hype among the youngsters of the city as soon as Hard Rock Cafe opened its outlet at Park Street. And when we went there, we found so much more than we had expected.
AMBIENCE:
The place is huge. On the ground floor, there is a hard rock shop where you can shop from. The cafe is on the first floor. There is a huge screen, where rock songs are played all throughout. There is a DJ section to set your mood. The staff is just perfect for a place like this. They are all uber cool, yet hardworking and polite. They suggest you about the food and click pictures for you as many as you want. Yet they always have a smile on their faces. There are "rock treasures" all beautifully adorned on the walls and the lighting is just perfect. I believe this cafe has the best ambience in town. It is always boozing with so much energy and excitement.
FOOD:
This is where I found it a bit overrated. The food is quite overpriced, though tasty. The quantity is satisfactory.
What we tried:
Jumbo Combo NonVeg
Twisted Mac and Cheese
French Fries
The total pocket pinch was around Rs. 1200, which we found decent, if not comforting.
The jumbo combo was the best, the onion rings being scrumptious. There were a huge range of dips to have the food with.
Would I visit this place again?
Yes, many times, but may be go careful on the bill.

They really guide you with your orders in terms of quantity as well (like how many dishes we should order). The variations in cocktails were much impressing and food tasted really good. Really looking forward for another visit soon.

Finally after a long wait....Hard Rock Cafe finally arrives to Rock Kolkata.Being a die hard rock and metal fan it was compulsory for me to visit this place.The ambience is no doubt excellent ,the foods awesome,one must try the chicken wings it's very tasty and unique in its taste.The price is steep almost the same as chilis.people who are die hard metal heads don't expect much from the music as they play only the bands and songs which are very popular, like non Jovi's it's my life,Bryan adams,coldplay.Sometimes they even play pop bands...I mean how can u play one direction in hard rock cafe.shouldn't you play bands that rock?? Led Zeppelin,motorhead, megadeth,iron maidenand many more.Few tracks they played were good though of gnr,enter sandman of Metallica, can I play with madness of iron maiden and system of a down.The staff there are very courteous and attentive they even forwarded my request for a track.

Finally it's in Kolkataüíö one of the prettiest cafe in the cityüíö 
Ambience : 5/5
Food : food tastes good. They server alcohol after 7pm. Then they have their amazing show. All of the member dance together.  If you go there then must try their combo starter, which is amazing.
Service : 5/5 
All over it was a nice experience. I'd love to go there again.

The name stands for itself.Being a much-awaited addition to the pubs in Kolkata, Hard Rock attracts a lot of guests, especially if its a Friday night (or any weekend evening for that matter), so our waiting time was really long, more than 50 minutes!!
But as you enter the pub the lively crowd and the awesome ambience welcome you to a happening experience of music, good food & great service! However, there is no live music or DJ, its a giant screen playing rock music. People of 90s will have a great time revisiting "Evanescence", "Red Hot Chilli Peppers", "U2", "Papa Roach" and "Linkin Park" followed by recent numbers too...
We ordered Hickory Smoked Berbeque chicken and Herbed Grilled Chicken, and beer and Electric Ice tea in drinks which was more than sufficient for two... However, I will suggest the truly value for money is the Jumbo Combo Nonveg which goes extremely well with drinks...Rs 2500 bill all included was pretty expected given that its Hard Rock. The highlight of the evening was the staff tapping their feet on YMCA!!

Hard rock cafe is in town. Finally!
Had to visit. Went to this much awaited place a few days back. I just loved the experience. Food was really good, but the best part was the ambiance.
Food we ordered-
1. Mashed potato- nicely seasoned mashed potato that came with a liquidy sauce. I enjoyed the taste of the dish overall.
2. Onion ring - crispy onion rings served with two different sauces. Crispy and tasty! I liked the sauce with mayo base, the red sauce, not so much.
3. Fajita- cottage cheese fajita, the whole assortment was perfect. No complaints.
4. Mac n cheese- delicious. My fav dish of the evening.
5. Mocktails- did not disappoint. Nothing out of the ordinary, but refreshing and good.
We wanted to have dessert, but there was no eggless option available other that basic ice cream, so that was a bit disappointing.
During our visit, the bartenders got up on the counters and danced to YMCA and a few other songs. I thoroughly enjoyed it! A very good experience overall. A must go restaurant for music lover!

The most happening place in town right now and HRC is doing the justice, lovely ambience, lively music, stuffs are treating like friends do. I've spent my birthday there yesterday evening and it was so damn amazing! If you haven't been there yet, what you're waiting for. Go there and have a sip in beer, sangria, LIIT or whatever you may like.

Finally kolkata has its own hard rock cafe. The ambience of this place is simply too good, always buzzing with loud music of rock bands. The place is extremely spacious. The service is good as well and the food is simply delicious but the prices are a bit on the higher side. The liquor prices are fine. Will surely visit this place again and again for everything. Lastly when we were leaving the staff were dancing to the tune of the music which is a great tradition of hard rock cafe. 
The decor is nice as well.

Need I say more?!?
Food Ambience Service was simply Excellent
They were playing music of my favourite rock bands!
They prepared my steak within 10 minutes, it was juicy tender and delicious.
The burger was huge.
We had a mocktail Mango Berry Cooler which had a heavenly taste and was mesmerising.
Finally for dessert we had a hot fudge brownie. This one was absolutely mind-blowing and had so much of goodness filled in it.

If you're not aware of HRC reputation its time you visit it asap.
Highly recommended.
Cant wait to try out their other items and drinks.

Food is good, the quality and quantity is upto the mark considering the price. Cocktails are well balanced. I will recommend this place to everyone, it is a one time must. Great place for friends to hang out.

Finally Kolkata has its own Hard Rock Cafe.. Located conveniently in Park street, housed inside Park Mansion. I have been to Hrc, blore but was really excited to visit this one. In the ground floor, there is the Rock shop and in the First floor, the dining and bar.. When i went, it was buzzing with people so i chose a bar high tool. They still did not have the alcohol license, so it is available post 6pm. We went for the package they have, 3drinks and 1 food for 1499+gst.. We ordered 1 hurricane,1 liit and 1 mai tai one on and for food, fajita chicken flat bread. The liit and mai tai were amazing but the hurricane was not very potent to our liking. The flatbread was delicious. Service and ambience deserve full marks. Will visit again.

Having already been to the Worli and Bangalore ones, I feel this one still has a lot to do to live up to the brand.

While the food and beverages were great, the service was very poor. The guy never came back to check if we wanted something else from the menu after the initial order. Additionally, we had to wait for a very long time and ask repeatedly to get someone clear the table and bring the bill. And when the bill was produced, we had to again wait for another 10-15mins for the person to come and collect the payment and that too only after I had asked multiple times for  someone to be sent to collect the payment. Ordering and paying was a real pain. Definitely not what I have seen in the other HRCs.

All in all, after the food was done, we had to wait for close to 20-25mins for the bill and the payment to be sorted which was shockingly poor.

Also, note that they already add Service Charge of 10% and later again come back asking for a tip even after such poor service.

Music was as good as ever.

Coolest thing about HRC, the interiors are all so unique. That's a big achievement in itself, considering it's such a huge chain.
The collection of memorabilia is fascinating too. From Ozzy Osbourne's leather pants to John McVie's Fender bass, it's pure awesomeness!

Also, the only place in Kolkata with better music than The GRID.

So, I went with a few colleagues. Ordered rum, whisky and a mocktail.

For food, we ordered the legendary chicken burger, fajita and a tenderloin steak. All very good, as expected. I had the steak made rare medium and it was exactly rare medium. Very few places here that can do that. And I could have a kilo of those mashed potatoes on a full stomach; that good!

And the playlist is just perfect. It's like they can guess which song you wanna hear next. So you have these comfy sofas, beautiful lights, thumping music, delicious food and the entire staff suddenly getting on the stage and dancing to Y.M.C.A., you can't not love this place. They'll conquer the scene here pretty soon. We had to leave at at 9. There were at least 40 people waiting to get in.

Highly recommended!

I ordered Jumbo non veg and Barbeque cooked chicken.

1. Food: Horrible to say the least. I had to take anti emetics after taking the food.
2. Ambience: Good. Only reason to give 1.5 stars.
3. Staff: Negative markings should be given. 1st they gave us a seat in an isolated place behind which people smoke. After saying that we wont seat there they changed our seat. They also levied 10 percent service charge which is illegal as they are charging it directly.

Go here if you want to waste your hard earned money .

All good things that you expect from HRC. Amazing ambience, staff and food.

 Ordered the Atomic Burger. The best Burger i had since coming back to India last year and it did justice to my  year long Burger craving. 

The red wine sangria was good as well. 

Two things to point out here for people new to HRC, like me: not a place where you go to have a conversation. You are usually shouting at your friends to be heard over the music. At its rather a heavy blow to your pockets.

Definitely a party destination every resident of Kolkata was waiting for long. Nothing new to be said about Hard Rock Caf√®. Superb and Excellent as usual. However, I'd like to highlight 2 things so that the management can take care of the same to ensure enriched experiences for the visitors.

1stly, being a long awaited party destination it's attracting huge crowd leading to long queues. But the most disappointing fact is that few of the  people came who may be are familiar or known to someone in the local destination's management and owing to that they're enjoying privileged entry without even standing at the queue. And if you raise your voice against this then you receive sarcasm. This is not expected from Hard Rock Cafe. I've visited quite a few around the country and even around the world but then this type of behavior is very disappointing.

2ndly, as per the GOI's rule paying service charge is completely at the discretion of the customer and he may chose to opt out. However my bill contained a service charge amount for which when I demanded explanation or removal of the amount no one paid any heed to it. 

Looking forward to partying Hard Rock Style

In trend these days,as it has opened newly in the town,so decided to pay a visit today. Though being a bit overpriced,the ambience here is just wonderful. It more or less makes up for the pricings. Plus the staff out here are way too good and they dance up too the beats of the music being played. The decor too is top notch.

Well well well !!What do we have in kolkata..
Yes my friends, Hard Rock Cafe is now officially part of the heritage of kolkata and to our suprise it has surpassed all the expectations and hype that we were looking for , thanks to an outstanding service and to the perfect ambience for a city of Rock Culture.
Being a food enthusiast,me and my wife choose the perfect date to visit this place .It is located above park mansion just beside reliance istore in park street. As it was weekend and most of us in kolkata was looking for a place to party,there was a big line beside its door step and i wont complain about it cause its worth it üòúüòú .After standing for 45 minutes we got our chance to enter this place. The entire chain is divided into two parts , on the ground floor they offer a ROCK SHOP which have all the collectables like beer mug, tshirts which are exclusive to HRC  . The main Cafe is on the 2nd floor and its very spacious with a big bar counter and a giant screen infront of which dance enthusiasts and drunk enthusiasts can indulge in the groove of some amazing collection of Hard Rock songs‚úåüèª.

After standing for sometime we met this guy ‚ÄòShankar‚Äô who introduced us to the best couple seat in the house and we found our new love for a place for party because the service ,behaviour that he offered on our first visit. 

We asked shankar to recommend us the best starter dish , so with his recommendation we took wings with hot sause and chicken tender fry , both the dish was well prepared and gave the perfect pinch to our drinks of the day which was a ‚ÄòCornora Rita ‚Äò  a perfect choice for me and my wife by Shankar .

With the night on the rise the party got a little bit dull but again to our surprise we got a surprise performance from the staffs of HRC. Another thing to watch was the song collection, they blend hard rock song with new pop chartbasters of 2017 which made the party more enjoyable for the crowd and the night glorious. As we were already very late we did not get a chance to taste their legendary burger which i will surely try on our next visit.

Suggestions: not needed for this legendary food chain , we want the same energy throughout the year and as for myself being a hard rock fun, i really am looking forward for the live performance and more and more hard rock song collection in the playlist .

Thank you HRC for completing one of my life‚Äôs goal ü§üüèª happy new year to all of you and JOY ROCK  üç∫ü§üüèª KEEP ROCKING IN THE HARD WAY

The name itself is iconic considering it was like forever in Kolkata‚Äôs wish list.So when it open its door finally in Park Street,  (next to GKB optics showroom), it was time to fill the checklist. The first thing is the atmosphere inside - rock music playing on a large screen and courteous smile welcomes you. The ambience was electrifying considering it was 30th dec night. We wanted to start with veg starters and hence we opted for jumbo veg platter.The quality of the same is decent (nothing extraordinary). However we love the grilled chicken that came next perfectly grilled and tender. Coming to alcohol their menu card doesn‚Äôt give u clarity whether the prices are written for 30ml or 60ml( do confirm prior ordering) . Alcohol prices are premium over here. A 60ml Vat69 will pinch you 550 bucks.Overall (3/5) rating considering a lot of food to be explored.
PS - They will charge 10% service charge flat unless u confront them when they will  drop the same from the bill, a practice they should stop immediately as per govt directives.

This place is all about the feels and less about the food. 
This is not to say that the food is bad, but the ambience is what makes it the hype it is. The decor, seating and music is top notch but the show stealer is the staff. The staff is the coolest and the friendliest that you'll find anywhere in the city. And if you are lucky, you'll even get to see them climb on to the platform and perform a dance routine like a band of rockstars!
Coming to the food, the drinks are good, the food is good. Not exceptional but pretty good. The price, ofcourse, is high. But then, right now they are running an offer which is pretty good. 

Even if you don't get any discount offer, the place is definitely worth it.

Food - average (truly speaking didn‚Äôt like much)
Staff- here I will give 5/5, simply awesome staff, very helpful, very friendly, 
Price - moderate 
Overall I think this place is overhyped , as this is new in Kolkata. So visit this place once but not in Christmas if u don‚Äôt want to stand in the queue.

I would have rather given a negative rating. Horrible experience with the staffs. I had ordered Sangria which I couldn't drink rather my white clothes had and that too all thanks to the super active staffs who made this incident happened. Never recommending this place to anyone. Other HRC's in delhi and Bangalore are far better according to me.

Hey guys, so I had been to HRC Kolkata this 24th, on the Christmas eve and the Park Street area was already so LIT and beautifully decorated. So HRC is in the heart of Park Street that‚Äôs in the Park Mansion. So due to the festive season, there was a cover charge of 2500/- per head which included unlimited Indian liquors and unlimited mocktails. 
‚ù£Ô∏èComing to the food, it‚Äôs so yummy and quite affordable as well. We started off with the favourite Non veg combo platter which is quite huge and has quite a number of variations including chicken wings, fish fingers, onion rings and more.
‚ù£Ô∏èNext up we had the Herb Chicken Steak ü•© which is again one of my personal favourites ever since I had one in Bangalore! It‚Äôs served with smashed potatoes and veggies.
Overall the place, ambiance, live music everything is just amazing and perfect for an evening brunch. üíñüëçüèª

Okay.. If you are a Rock Lover (mostly soft rocks).. Then this is the place...HardRock Cafe can knock out contemporaries like Irish House ( although not similar).. Staff members are really courteous.. ( I recommend this guy called Diptashish). Missing: Live Music/ Comedy shows may be.. High Points: Ambience and Collection of Rock music.. Low Points: as of now..nothing.. Hope I can expect more..

Located in an easy to find location on park street,went there with friends on Christmas! We thought we had to wait for long as there was a long queue ahead of us but we got a table for 3 real quick.The place was a treat for the eyes with rock music playing on a large screen and photos and instruments of iconic rockstars on the walls.For starters,we ordered the jumbo non-veg platter which had 3 veg and 2 non-veg items with 3 dips.It was enough for the three of us and all the items tasted great but it would be better if they could include more non veg items in it. We also order mango berry cooler which was a refreshing drink with mango,pineapple,strawberry puree with lime soda.We got the Jamaican grilled jerk chicken with cheesy mashed potato and veggies.Finally ordered the hot fudge brownie (enough to share).We were awestruck with the amount served and it tasted absolutely delightful with whipped cream,walnuts,ice cream and hot chocolate sauce on top of one of the best brownies I have ever tasted! In all, the experiemce was awesome.Special mention to the staff who were super helpful. Will surely visit again :)

Been to almost 100 pubs and restaurants in the city and this is the ONLY place I just could not resist myself from giving a review. 

Firstly, the important question everyone has been asking about. Yes, liqour is available and from today onwards it will be available all day long. Not after 7pm like the previous week but from the time it opens.

For prices, check any other HRC outlet menu on zomato and it is more or less the same with hardly a RS. 10-50 variance on each item.

Now the good stuff. 
The ambience, I do NOT have words to describe it and I have NOT experienced such an amazing atmosphere in any place in this city. I might be a bit partial since they play the kind of music I like, but I sincerely think it would be very difficult for someone to not have a good time over there.

The service, and the attendants, again, nothing like I have ever seen before in this city. To whoever who was serving my table, sorry I forgot your name, you were awesome. 

No point talking about food taste and quality as it is the same (great, as expected) as other outlets and there are more than enough reviews over there.

Prices are a bit high, as usual for any HRC outlet but it's definitely worth it. 

Food - 4.5/5
Price - 3/5
Ambience - 10/5. üòä
Service - 10/5. üòä

Tried this newly opened cafe one evening. Ambience is awesome. The decor matches to the theme. The music makes the environment very lively. It's also very spacious and comfy. I loved it. 
Food is little costly. Ordered different desserts-Hot Fudge Brownie and Classic Diner Style Milk Shake. Both tasted really good.
Service was also good.

It's a great place to catch up with your old friends.

I had been waiting for years for Hard Rock Cafe to arrive in kolkata and finally it's here and it didn't disappoint . Firstly the ambience is true to the hard rock theme , the interiors have a classic timeless look  and adorned with rock memorabilia . Very friendly staff who suggest the right kind of choices from the menu . The music is ofcourse of the rock genre and the food is decent . 
Their LIIT is awesome , though I would suggest they can make it a bit more strong . 
I have been to Hard Rock cafes in Mumbai and bangalore and I personally feel this one is a bit smaller in size but they have made up for it with their grandiose . It's definitely worth a visit specially for rock lovers .

Located in the heart of Park street,just after the flurys signal,me and a friend hopped in after christmas today in the afternoon.Realised they don't serve alcohol before 7pm tsk tsk. Anyway we still went it and the decor is nothing as per the other HRC's in the country.I was a little disappointed.The place was almost empty and there was no hassle in there.The staff was very courteous and the service was very swift but the food was COLD.They served us cold fries with our smoked pork and chicken.The wings were salty and not sour or tangy or whatever the sauces mentioned.I cannot eat salty food and I very well know how tangy tastes.Anyway,the pork ribs were great and I loved it,so was the coffee and the strawberry lime drink my friend ordered. I think they need to work on this outlet a lot to get it right.

Couldn't deduct even .001.
I've visited HRC in Bangalore and Hyderabad earlier and was never disappointed. In terms of food and ambience, this is a dream place to be for a music lover and foodie. The Kolkata outlet is nothing less. Finally a competition to Someplace Else!

Courtesy: Visited HRC Kolkata on 24th December which happened to be Sunday. However, thanks to the membership, was seated immediately. Staffs escorted us all the way to the table and since I was enthusiastic about live gigs, was seated  to stage facing table. Sam, our waitress, was too sweet to handle and helped a lot to figure out a proper order for two. Arindam, on other hand, suggested for a wonderful dessert for which I would be grateful to him. Not only that, but also both of them were jolly good fellas. 10 on 10 for that.

Food: Having tried their legendary burgers before, I ordered for chicken wings and steak this time. My friend opted for salad. All the food were amazing. The dessert, Oreo cheesecake, is what I call "Cherry on top". True to their fame for food.

Vibe: Do I need to even start! Killer ambience. Deadly decor. Super active and stylish Staff. And on top of that good music. Looking to have a good time - Sorted!!

The vibe of this place sets right on the point. The decor is classic & the staff is really friendly. 
We tried their Chicken Tenders, Twisted Mac & Cheese, Legendary Burger & Brownie Sundae along with Berrilicious & Strawberry Lemonade. All the items were top notch but what stood out the most was the Mac & Cheese & the dessert. Quick service. Looking forward to come here again.

Finally Hard Rock Cafe has arrived in Kolkata.

As soon as you enter, you are greeted with the "ROCK SHOP" and a bunch of really friendly staff who ask you for the number of heads in your group and amicably rush to check for table availability.

In the meanwhile, you can explore a bit in the "ROCK SHOP". I saw one of the patent white round neck T-Shirt. It was being retailed for Rs.839.

We were given the table in just 5 minutes. Seating arrangement is on the first floor and one of the staff escorted us to our table. After we were seated on our table, I just looked around and boy oh boy.. What an ambiance..!! Live music stage, a huge bar with the Hard Rock Cafe logo on top of it, a gigantic projector screen right behind the stage, huge musical instruments being displayed in glass cases all across the walls, different types of table (depending upon the number of people).¬†

This place was reasonably crowded when we went there in the later afternoon. The staff here is really well versed with their offerings and helped me in placing the order. The staff also had a very stylish attire and clicked pictures for us when we asked them.

We ordered the following:

*Veg Jumbo Combo Starters: This starter was a combo and included Bruschettas, Onion Rings, Spring Rolls and Potato Cheese Croquettes. All tasted good. The spring rolls and bruschettas were comparatively better. Onion Rings can be made a little less oily.

*Pasta Arrabiata: It was prepared very well with the right amount of veggies and it tasted very good.

*Mocktails: We ordered three mocktails and all were great in taste. Recommended Mocktail will be Mango Tango.

Now coming towards something which was the only disappointing part in my entire visit, the staff never served us water. We had to ask for it and then we were provided with the same.

Looking forward to more visits to this place.

Date of Visit: 23/12/2017

Number of Heads: 3

Bill Amount: Rs.2003

I had the best burgers and steaks of my life on HRC! 
From their warm welcome to their ambience, choice of music and food- I love absolutely everything!
While I got in, I was wished good evening by the lady standing in front of the door. Before taking orders the waiter will shake hands and introduce himself to you. 

They serve orders really REALLY fast. It took them around 8 minutes to serve us the juice , steak and burger.

They have a huge screen where they play mostly 80s rock, just exactly what I love. The decor is just like one expects in one of the best cafes. 

Coming to the food, we ordered Atomic burger(chicken), tenderloin steak, French fries, mango berry cooler and an ice cream served with brownie (I forgot the name, but you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs picture taking an entire page in their menu) for dessert. 
The burger bun was perfect, so was the chicken patties and all the other things stuffed inside. I feel they should increase the quantity of fries they serve. We had over cooked tenderloin steak which was absolutely perfect with the cheddar cheese (I don‚Äôt like my steak to be too chewy). Next time I‚Äôm going to have my steak topped with bacon. The juice was awesome, the first sip completely won me over. The dessert was also absolutely fine and enough for two people. 
I‚Äôll visit the place over and over again!

I've visited HRC in Bangalore and Hyderabad earlier and was never disappointed. In terms of food and ambience, this is a dream place to be for a music lover and foodie. The Kolkata outlet is nothing less. Finally a competition to Someplace Else!

Courtesy: Visited HRC Kolkata on 24th December which happened to be Sunday. However, thanks to the membership, was seated immediately. Staffs escorted us all the way to the table and since I was enthusiastic about live gigs, was seated  to stage facing table. Sam, our waitress, was too sweet to handle and helped a lot to figure out a proper order for two. Arindam, on other hand, suggested for a wonderful dessert for which I would be grateful to him. Not only that, but also both of them were jolly good fellas. 10 on 10 for that.

Food: Having tried their legendary burgers before, I ordered for chicken wings and steak this time. My friend opted for salad. All the food were amazing. The dessert, Oreo cheesecake, is what I call "Cherry on top". True to their fame for food.

Vibe: Do I need to even start! Killer ambience. Deadly decor. Super active and stylish Staff. And on top of that good music. Looking to have a good time - Sorted!!

The vibe of this place sets right on the point. The decor is classic & the staff is really friendly. 
We tried their Chicken Tenders, Twisted Mac & Cheese, Legendary Burger & Brownie Sundae along with Berrilicious & Strawberry Lemonade. All the items were top notch but what stood out the most was the Mac & Cheese & the dessert. Quick service. Looking forward to come here again.

Finally Hard Rock Cafe has arrived in Kolkata.

As soon as you enter, you are greeted with the "ROCK SHOP" and a bunch of really friendly staff who ask you for the number of heads in your group and amicably rush to check for table availability.

In the meanwhile, you can explore a bit in the "ROCK SHOP". I saw one of the patent white round neck T-Shirt. It was being retailed for Rs.839.

We were given the table in just 5 minutes. Seating arrangement is on the first floor and one of the staff escorted us to our table. After we were seated on our table, I just looked around and boy oh boy.. What an ambiance..!! Live music stage, a huge bar with the Hard Rock Cafe logo on top of it, a gigantic projector screen right behind the stage, huge musical instruments being displayed in glass cases all across the walls, different types of table (depending upon the number of people).¬†

This place was reasonably crowded when we went there in the later afternoon. The staff here is really well versed with their offerings and helped me in placing the order. The staff also had a very stylish attire and clicked pictures for us when we asked them.

We ordered the following:

*Veg Jumbo Combo Starters: This starter was a combo and included Bruschettas, Onion Rings, Spring Rolls and Potato Cheese Croquettes. All tasted good. The spring rolls and bruschettas were comparatively better. Onion Rings can be made a little less oily.

*Pasta Arrabiata: It was prepared very well with the right amount of veggies and it tasted very good.

*Mocktails: We ordered three mocktails and all were great in taste. Recommended Mocktail will be Mango Tango.

Now coming towards something which was the only disappointing part in my entire visit, the staff never served us water. We had to ask for it and then we were provided with the same.

Looking forward to more visits to this place.

Date of Visit: 23/12/2017

Number of Heads: 3

Bill Amount: Rs.2003

Confirm before coming if u want alcohol as they don't have permanent licence.
Ambiance is not at all like hard rock Cafe. Needs a lot of improvement in ambiance and staff training and please get your license ASAP

I was just about to leave for kolkata when I saw news about HRC to be opening soon in Park Street. No place would have been justified for HRC other than Park Street! Located at a prime location , it was pretty easy to spot. Been to HRC's in Bangalore and Delhi, so was pretty much excited for kolkata. Finally I made it on the 25th. The place is pretty A! I loved the ambience. There was not much of a rush. Had to wait for 15 minutes, probably because they serve booze after 7(license issues). There's a giant screen where you could find your love for classic rock. They were playing Led Zep as I entered. The staff was pretty courteous and proactive. Order was served in no time! The food was absolutely delicious. Their pork ribs were out of the world! Yet to try out the burgers , probably the next time!

Much awaited ‚ÄúHard rock cafe,kolkata‚Äù the shutter is finally open and so we went with excitement.

The food was unquestionably amazing, ambience was undoubtedly excellent.

Sad part is THEY ARE NOT SERVING ALCOHOL YET, so don‚Äôt go there expecting some hard drink with some hard rock music.

Coming back to food, you must try the legendary burger, its one of the signature dishes, also the non veg combo is worth tasting.

I generally do not summarize my review at the very beginning, but this one will be an exception. In one sentence, HRC Kolkata is possibly THE BEST themed restaurant in Kolkata right now.

I will detail my today's visit summary as follows -
1. Management - Because of the Christmas Eve, Park street was packed with people and needless to say there was a huge crowd waiting to get inside this brand new joint. The management did the task of crowd management very efficiently. I must admit the entire planning was very effective.
2. Staff - Each and every memeber of the staff have been extremely courteous.
3. Food - We ordered Tupelo Chicken Tenders for starters, for main course Atomic Burger and Jamaican Grilled Fish Steak. The Tupelo chicken had a perfect blend of spices, and the burger's meat patty was very juicy. Since I am not a big broccoli lover, the veggies in the fish steak were a major setback for me, but that is a completely personal choice. The cocktail - Purple Haze and another blue thingey (whose name I forgot) were good as well.
4. Ambience - In one word "ECSTATIC". Even with lack of live music performance, the atmosphere was very lively and the choice of music was awesome. When the HRC staff jumped on the center tables to dance, all the patrons left their tables and joined in. It was an amazing scene.

I would surely recommend everyone to try this place at least once to bask in the experience. One small thing to nitpick - the waiter forgot one of our drinks order. I am willing to let that slide given the rush of crowd and loud music. I would call my experience a 5* experience and definitely visit HRC Kolkata again.

To the management, keep up the good work guys.

No matter wat the day is, wat the ocassion is, when you know Hard Rock Cafe (HRC) has opened in the city u should not waste time, wait for reviews and wait for the pics to mark ur footsteps into this legendary cafe.
AMBIENCE: IT WAAASSS ABSO-BLOODY-LUTELY AWESOMMEEEE. PERIOD!!
No words can describe the feeling, craziness and decorum with which HRC has been opened and i literally enjoyed every moment there.

FOOD: BIRA checked, double berry cooler checked, mango cooler checked.
That followed with two platters- one non-veg and one veg (Yes!! I had some pure veggie friends there accompanying me). But that didnt fill our apetite (probably coz we were craving for more from that place) so we went for steaks: tenderloin steak- best i have ever had in kolkata; chicken steak- soft juicy breast pieces with a unique sauce which complimented the whole preperation.

I dont have anything more to say except the fact that one should be there to witness a change in how a cafe is being projected in the city.

P.S- It was only the 2nd day after opening of HRC and they also have live performances by there super-cool staffs.

We were literally out of places to go on Christmas Eve for a lunch, but I always bore in my mind that Kolkata has come up with the best newest thing ever. Yes, it was none other than the Hard Rock Cafe outlet at Park Street and once we came across the glowing sign against a white wall and a large wooden door underneath, we couldn't resist the temptation of going in and checking it out even if it was for a lunch.

Now a lot of people kept asking afterwards if we had to pre book in order to get seats, I would like to mention that it's always better to make a reservation by either a phone call or a notification 2 to 3 hours earlier than you visit, but when we went there was a small queue and we were okay with standing outside for a while. It gave us some time to check out the HRC tees and goodies store on the ground floor and look at some of the memorabilia on the walls.

This was indeed my first visit to a Hard Rock Cafe outlet, but if you are a Rock and Rockn'Roll and this is just the best eatery for you. Once we got in, we went up a winding staircase to the main eating hall and was fascinated with the ambience and decor. In between is the provision for restrooms at a floor below the main hall. The wall is adorned by memorabilia of major rockstars over the decades from the early 1960s to the 90s. Elvis Presley, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, The Beatles, The Doors, Freddie Mercury and Queen, you name it and they have a piece of memorabilia in honour of all these stalwarts up on the walls already. One could indeed get lost in time while going around the entire place clicking photographs and reading the bit of information written there about everyone if one is a true hard rock fan. There are television sets on some walls showing footage of people enjoying themselves at HRC outlets all around the world.

"Going around the entire place" surely does give you a hint about how large the eatery is, it indeed seats around 150 people with the ceiling being around 40 feet high decorated with reflective glass. There are arched hallways leading to every segment. There is a main sitting area in the front and there are places to sit on the either side of it. The main seating area overlooks a stage with a 7' x 7' screen in the backdrop, with provisions for colourful stage light and a projector to display videos on the screen. There is a music console placed right behind the sitting area, behind which is the mini bar with the very familiar glowing sign that says "Hard Rock Cafe."

Now we went in the afternoon, so there wasn't too much of a rush, and we were immediately shown to our seats by a gracious waiter, Suddam who was also prompt in handing over the menu and taking the order. The ambience was absolutely electric, with all genres of rock music being played loud enough for people to get into the mood as soon as they seat themselves. Here I must mention, that they serve alcohol only after 7pm and there are provisions for live gigs in the evenings which we missed.

We ordered 2 entr√©e dishes and one mocktail. The service was prompt and food was served hot. Herb grilled chicken and Barbecue grilled jerk chicken had two pieces of stuffed chicken breast with mashed potatoes and assorted veggies comprising carrots, broccoli and corn. Barbecue chicken was served with Barbecue sauce. Herb grilled chicken had small pieces of mushrooms sprinkled upon it. The chicken was soft and very well cooked. It felt juicy in the mouth, and delicious to taste, leaving behind a memory in the taste buds. The mashed potatoes were boiled properly and tasted just perfect with the sauce. They were considerate with the portions of food, but the price attached was slightly steeper than other eateries in the same area, I felt. The non alcoholic beverages had a lot of fruity options. Wild Berry smoothie was what we settled upon after much debate. It was served pink in a 400ml glass with a pineapple slice on top. It was an eclectic mix of bananas, coconuts, strawberries, pineapple, guava and other fruits I couldn't figure out by myself. It cost us close to 1400 for the items discussed above. Of course one is free to invest on other dishes, they have a wide range of burgers, appetizers, sandwiches and other options on entr√©e dishes. Non alcoholic beverages and desserts also have some innovation. However, I felt the number of vegetarian options were less on the menu, which could be a deterrent for vegans and strict vegetarians. Overall, 2500 for two (including appetisers, beverages without alcohol and desserts) is what one has to sign under the bill on an eatout or luncheon to enjoy a satisfactory meal. However, one could walk in to have a bite or two of their very exquisite sandwiches and burgers. A lot of options on bacon, ham, and beef are to be discovered.

Overall I would like to say, that the place has a lot of room for improvement on the menu. The Happy Hours in the evening, live gigs and provisions for keeping the restaurant open till midnight is what should probably be attracting a thick crowd in future to this outlet of an iconic multinational brand of eateries. As for me, I would really look forward to many more visits to the Hard Rock Caf√© in future.

Cheers!

Late upload..

1971 - London, 2004 - Mumbai & finally 2017 - Kolkata - the long journey of this iconic brand says all about it‚Äôs far reaching popularity.. The eighth outlet in India opened on Thursday and i walked in on the fourth day of it‚Äôs existence yesterday for a Christmas eve lunch and man what a lunch it was.. 

Ambience: My last visit to any HRC outlet was last year at their Gurgaon outlet but this one is something else altogether.. 161 seater spread over 10000 sqft across three levels - the theme is constant with all other HRC - rock and more rock everywhere you look - the walls are filled with priceless memorabilia of iconic rock artists of the world.. Huge ceilings covered with glass impressions add to the overall grandeur of the property.. The sound and light set up is undoubtedly the best in Kolkata for any eatery - you can simply spend hours inside the cafe just enjoying the music.. A separate stage set up with LED screens are in place for live performances which is the soul of any HRC across the globe - i  strongly hope this will act as a major platform for local musicians and their gigs and thus will be a great boost for indie music in town..

Service: Impeccable to say the least..

FOOD: Now, let‚Äôs get to the real deal.. 

#LEGENDARYCHOCOLATE: The chocolate shake was thick and delicious - very creamy and a complete chocolatey affair.. 

#ORIGINALLEGENDARYHRCBURGER: This is their flagship burger and it‚Äôs loaded with a half lb beefy buffalo patty, their trademark onion rings and loads of crispy bacon & cheese.. It tasted amazing for sure but the presence of too many vegetables (and that also cut too thick) for a hardcore carnivore like me was killing the meaty taste a bit.. Having said that, it is still legendary for sure..

#HICKORYSMOKEDRIBS: Now, that was truly the star of the spread - this was dope.. Seriously tender barbecued pork ribs (one massive cut) falling of the bone rubbed with their signature hickory sauce is a paradise for any pork lover.. It is far better than TGIF & even Chillis too both in terms of taste & pocket pinch.. You have to taste it to get that porky high feeling.. 

#CHOCOOREOBAKEDCHEESECAKE: What an ending that was to a grand meal.. This one looked attractive and tasted heavenly.. The thick creamy cheese cake layered with oreo chocolate was a melt in the mouth experience - something that will linger on my taste buds for a long time.. This one was epic..

Overall pocket pinch is slightly on the higher end but considering the kind of ambience, service & food & drink options in store for you - i would say that it is a fair deal.. Out here - it is not merely a meal - it is an experience to savour for a long time.. #ParkStreet is finally back with a bang.. 

Verdict: #STRONGLYRECOMMENDED (but choose your dishes wisely)

Journey of an #EpicureanCineTrotter continues..

As i recall the bits and pieces of  yesterday night's experience, i cannot but be thrilled with the Christmas eve we had with hrc Kolkata. It was an amazing cocktail of food, booze and music. Ambience is excellent and the huge floor space is the cherry on the cake for the party goers with the usual hard rock themed wall decorations. The 2499 package of three hours unlimited drinks was good and the interesting thing is that you can directly go to the bar and take your drinks away rather waiting for the waiter. Food menu was at par with the classic continental restaurants. The waiters were courteous, helpful and it was really nice to see them enjoying, clicking selfies, performing hand in hand in between, not to mention Dev, our buddy who was really cool. And oh the music, it was electrifying and the band  was also superb. Overall it was a galvanising one hell of an experience to start with and Kolkata have a new hot destination for the rock- head party people to look forward to. Cheers.

The newly opened Hard Rock Cafe has occupied the area , where , Veda used to be. The interiors are very well done , with dim lighting , souvenirs and a sort of hall of fame of legends and their artefacts. The ground floor is a shop selling Hard Rock Cafe merchandise. The restaurant and bar is upstairs. They have liquor license after 6pm . 
We ordered virgin mojito and chocolate milkshake which were good. For starters we had 
Jumbo non veg platter - it consisted of bruschetta , which was very crunchy and drenched in olive oil , with a Parmesan shaving on top , chicken tenders which were steaming hot and crunchy , egg rolls filled with spinach and corn , chicken wings which were well seasoned and onion rings which had a delicious panko coating. These were served with barbecue dip, sour cream , spicy honey mustard. A must have. 
We ordered chicken flatbread which was basically flatbread pizza with a pesto base , red cheddar and mozzarella with barbecued chicken on top. It was served with sour cream. 
For main course we had the Mac and cheese which was creamy and was served with two slices of baguette smeared with extra virgin olive oil ; chicken steak which was served with mashed potatoes , gravy and boiled vegetables , jerk chicken steak and the chicken atom burger. The burger was the highlight of the day as it was huge and had cheddar, fried onions and jalape√±os , a meaty chicken patty , lettuce , olives and their own seasoned mayonnaise. It was served with fries. 
The food at Hard Rock Cafe is really of great standard. The prices are reasonable for a pub/restaurant. However , we were a little disappointed by the  service. Our waiter wasn‚Äôt available most of time. The manager was very friendly and helpful. Great ambience and great food.

So this unexpected thing happned on our first visit here . 

There were two of us , famished and hopeful of finding our share of decent food . We decided to check out the place. what followed was unprecidented,to say the least.

While the ambience was top notch and the framed guitars only added to it, the place was pretty much full and crowded.

Despite the buzz, we got a decent seat and ordered our food , which happned to include 2 chicken steak dishes and one chocolate milkshake.

Staff members were very pleasant and polite.Rather friendly, if i must say. So far, the place was winning with its awesome vibe , soothing lights, music and friendly staff.

Then the wait began. 15-20 had passed and we decided to flag down our waitress. She informed it was a bit late and will be out soon. 

So we waited some more. Now, 45 minutes had passed since we ordered and she approached and informed us that the chocolate is no longer in stock , so we must choose between strawberry and vanilla.

At this point, we were hungry, frustrated and quite furious. We asked her to change it to strawberry shake and bring our food as soon as possible. 

The shake was out in 10 minutes and then we waited some more. We were tired and decided to pay or the shake and leave. 

As soon as we were about to, the manager himself hurried to our table and apologised profusely for the delayed order. He said the drink is on him and we must give them few minutes more. 

We decided to stay a little longer and see what they were up to. 5 minutes later, our food arrived , smoking hot and looking delicious. We couldnt wait a minute to hop in and started carving and biting into it as voraciously as possible. 

To say, the food was compensating for our foul mood, is an understatement. It was as good as they come. After a long wait of 50 -55 minutes, it took us only couple of them to devour the whole thing. 

We quickly asked for the bill and were getting ready to head out. Soon, the waiter arrived and informed us that the WHOLE BILL HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. 

Shocked as we were, we asked for the manager , who in fact gave us a free meal!

He apologised once more and asked us to visit again. 'That's the least i can do' he said.

No matter how much we insisted on paying, he was just too adamant , sincerely so.

A long wait and then a surprise on Christmas eve, eve ... we couldnt have asked for a more dramatic turn of events. 

So folks, if you are in Hard rock cafe, even a long wait may turn out to be a blessing. 

Looking forward to visiting here again. The next time, we hope to pay the bill , so they better hurry up with the order.

In a nutshell, this was an experience we are not forgetting anytime soon. Thanks HRC. loved yall .

This recently opened place has been creating a lot of buzz among people. Being situated in one of the main party hub of Kolkata it is attracting a lot of crowd too. We had a long queue ahead of us and so decided to wait in the bar area. The crowd and music was awesome. But the food was just fine.

Finally, HRC opened up in the 'City Of Joy'. Having been a regular visitor of HRC across India and abroad, I can openly vouch that Calcutta HRC has the friendliest staffs among all of them. Mr.¬†Asif and Shankar were friendly and quite welcoming. Coming to the decor, the place is filled with memorabilias of some of the legendary musicians like Bob Dylan, B.B.King, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, to name a few. For the food, THE LEGENDARY BURGER is a must have and will always be my favorite. The burger consists of beef patty along with smoked bacon, lettuce, onion rings and tomatoes. The beef patty was cooked perfectly to my liking. I took the Long Island Iced Tea for the drink which was a tad tangy for my taste. The only downside is that they have a temporary liquor license which is applicable after 7p.m.¬†
The big question is will I come back?
The answer is HELL YEAH!¬†
P.S. Always keep on playing the classic rock. ;)

Hi I am very hard core fan of HRC but after yesterday nights incident I do not know what to say I am totally numb . I always listen to music and was watching Eminem and coming down to staircase to leave for my home. I was rapping the tracks and watching the video when suddenly a lady crossed by asking for space. She then left off and went outside the outlet but within few seconds a guy who seems to be her husband started using foul language claiming that I showed his wife my middle finger which I didn't do to her. Every body was there including all store people and manager but no one opened there mouth at all and one of the HRC employee told to throw me out that word he used and then that guy started hitting me despite I told I have lens in my eyes. I was just waiting until he completes and get satisfied. Then i left the place . While I was walking towards to get a taxi one young couple told me why I didn't go to police and complaint. They told I should protest but it was so bad what happened. Thanks to entire staff and cree of HRC for accommodating me and love you gave for last 7-8 odd years across all the HRC. Finally all ends and now I believe there tag 'All is one'.... If we can't respect music and claim all this then better we don't 'Save the planet'..... Bye... Complaint has been raised to HRC world wide team and ipenforcement team ,..... But complaint is not a solution .. good bye HRC... Do your business..

Ambience is similar to any HRC but I would say a tad on the lesser energy side. The crowd was mixed from kids to youngsters to middle aged ppl too. Well the pina colada and the Bloody Mary cocktails were very very good! The non veg platter was good too. The atomic burger was a sad thing with the patty that had no salt and was slightly burnt. And the pita in the fajita was slightly tough. And hence the .5 less in the rating. Special mention is surely the service. Was too quick and prompt and the guy responsible for our table really was very prompt and attentive. Kudos to that.

Food was gud but not very good and as the name suggests, rock music was getting played most of the time. Service is a little slow here but the staff is quiet friendly. Best day to visit is thursday when you can see live band performances.

At last much awaited Hard Rock Cafe comes to Kolkata and the crazy Kolkata crowd embraced it like one of its own. Great atmosphere, no need to mention. A must visit place definitely. Well the goodwill comes with its own price. So the place is costly as u can imagine. One pint of domestic beer costs around 225 to 350. And the food is also costly. But who cares. Hard Rock Cafe was never supposed to be cheap. We ordered 11 pints of beer and a Jumbo Combo which is actually a staple dish at 750 rupees. Not that great tasting. But who cares. Want to visit this place again on a event night. On all other days in-house dj plays rock numbers. For 11 pints and one jumbo combo the pocket pinch was apprx 4400 including service charge and gst. Yes they charge service charge. Definitely a must visit place with great memorabilia hanging on the walls. Njoy frnds. Cheers !!

Hard Rock Caf√© is finally there in the city so a check-in here was mandatory for me. Have been hearing alot about this place which resulted in my expectations to be high. I went on Saturday for a brunch and this place has lived upto my expectations very well.

This place is covered in a two storeyed building, the ground floor offers you wide range of merchandise from the ‚ÄúRock Shop‚Äù store, which is their own brand and the caf√© is located in the 1st floor, must say its quite a spacious one with the entire floor divided into 5-6 region resulting in a convenient sitting and eating joint, also consisting of a huge bar area and a podium for live performance too.

Now comes the Food i ordered for the Following:
1) Jumbo Combo Non-Veg- INR750 (A must try)
2) Caesar Salad- INR385 (serves you with fish anchovy oil which is healthy and yum)
3) Fresh Lime soda- INR125

The quality of the food is palatable and quantity is sufficient to serve three people easily, the food attendants were very responsive with every bit of querry about the music, interior, menu, ingredients etc and most importantly assisted with quick service on the table.

Finally, this place costed me INR1500 (inclusive of taxes and service charges), which is absolutely worth for the standard of service and the quality they maintained.

Will definitely visit here again for their Live band performance and exploring other dishes on the menu.

Have been to hard rock in other cities and thought its crazy that kolkata got its first. We decided to check it out but it was a dissapointment. The food wasnt great. Presentation was excellent. Order was misplaced. We were charged extra, had problem with the bill. Ambience and music its a thumbs up other than that it hurts to say it was such a dissapointment. Mocktail that was made for us that also had too much lime in it.

Hard Rock Cafe. A brand synonymous to expensive food. Great food. Rock culture. Fabulous ambiance. And friendly staff. 

I have been an HRC fan for quite some time now. So when it opened up its doors in Kolkata, I knew I had to go. The ambiance is great, there‚Äôs rock music always playing on a big screen, so if you‚Äôre the kind who likes quiet places - this isn‚Äôt where you should be. 

Coming to the food, we ordered a virgin pina colada. A must have for me. HRC pinacolada really set a very high standard that no cafe or restaurant I have ever visited has been able to match up to. The chilli cheese toast was soft moist and had a generous helping of cheese. 
The rock star dish of the evening - their burgers.
I ordered an original legendary burger, however, I asked my patty to be replaced with a chicken one, and the servers very politely adhered to my request. We also ordered the atomic burger, it was divine. I always like burgers having generous amount of cheese and a homemade authentic patty. It ticked all the important boxes. The burgers are pricey here no doubt, but have it once and if you‚Äôre a true burger fan, you‚Äôll know why. Their burgers come with a side of fries. Mine one was over salted but I was too into the food to have cared. 

If you don‚Äôt mind spending a tad bit much on good food, this is one place you should definitely visit.

Then i pushed them to take my number and as expected didn‚Äôt get a call back. Arrogance is good trait to have but only when used in moderation. HRC is a brand and hope it continues to do well.

Special mention to the sound system which is amazing. There was a live band performance from 8.30pm. Sadly we couldnt stay till then but the music sounded fantastic during the sound check. Downstairs they have a shop selling hard rock accessories.

The most awaited pub and eatery is here in town The Hard Rock Cafe Kolkata.The name doesnt need an introduction but lets talk about how amazing it is all over again.So my first hard rock was Hard Rock New york City which was a heaven in the form of a pub but Hard Rock kolkata is no less.It has killed with the ambience no other place in city can match up to it in todays date.Starting from the staff and service, the staffs were so courtious and well informed about the entire menu and great recommendations,they made sure each of us had a great time while we are there.The food eas very fresh,tasty,amazing spice balance in each time and with great quantity.We ordered for the big non veg combo platter which eas huge in size and served three of us very easily.The alcohol is just another level ,amazing mixologists in the house makes great cocktails,try out the Big Kabule Nah, a white rum based cocktail which tastes great in mouth.Ambience wise it has raised the bar to a different level,the steal railings on the top blends amazing with the classy velvetty wall tagged with rock posters.A very rare blend of urban and artsy taste of interiors,a one of a kind in the city.Amazing place do give it a try guys.

The most awaited pub and eatery is here in town The Hard Rock Cafe Kolkata.The name doesnt need an introduction but lets talk about how amazing it is all over again.So my first hard rock was Hard Rock New york City which was a heaven in the form of a pub but Hard Rock kolkata is no less.It has killed with the ambience no other place in city can match up to it in todays date.Starting from the staff and service, the staffs were so courtious and well informed about the entire menu and great recommendations,they made sure each of us had a great time while we are there.The food eas very fresh,tasty,amazing spice balance in each time and with great quantity.We ordered for the big non veg combo platter which eas huge in size and served three of us very easily.The alcohol is just another level ,amazing mixologists in the house makes great cocktails,try out the Big Kabule Nah, a white rum based cocktail which tastes great in mouth.Ambience wise it has raised the bar to a different level,the steal railings on the top blends amazing with the classy velvetty wall tagged with rock posters.A very rare blend of urban and artsy taste of interiors,a one of a kind in the city.Amazing place do give it a try guys.

I believe HRC needs no introduction, the music is the ambience and this place got it right. The waiters were happy serving and joyfully roaming around with quick chats with the customers while they execute their speedy service.

The food was served hot and promptly...we started off with the jumbo non veg platter, followed by atomic burger, pork ribs, BBQ Chicken, Local Legendary Burger and Grilled chicken with herbs.
There were too many French fries on the table definitely, apart from this, the mashed potato and mushrooms were good.

The chicken was dry in most of our dishes, it did not have the juicy flavours, the pork ribs was tender and juicy but the chicken was definitely a disappointment. The bread with the burgers was extremely soft and as expected.

In drinks we had LIIT, sex on beach, pinacolada and a line of large and double large Gin shots. They did not have beers- were only serving corona and kingfisher ultra which was again a disappointment to draught beer and Heineken lovers.

The occasional playing of the YMCA song and the staff dancing to it was very uplifting, we danced and screamed around our tables. Overall the experience was overwhelming only if they got the chicken more juicy and satiated our tastebuds.

This is a nice place to party but get ready for the long bill you are gonna get at the end of it. It costed us around 24000 for 6 people.

So it's time for the most discussed place now a days in Kolkata. HRC is a must visit place not only for the huge double storeyed building but for the amazing and unique decor. The place is full of music. Best place to have drink with friends. Yeah it will hurt your pocket initially but trust me the place is worth it. Food is amazing and with the ambience it looks more deliciousüòâüòâ Well we miss the live music but will visit again to enjoy the wonderful placeüòÅ

Finally we got ourselves our own Hard Rock! So we had to try it as early as possible. I've been to the Bangalore and Hyderabad HRC's and this one didn't fail to amaze me either. We'd ordered

Mac n cheese- It was super cheesy and creamy and very filling.
Chicken Texan sandwich- This tasted amazing but wouldn't be enough for one person.
Atomic chicken burger- Again heavenly

Grilled Jamaican pulled chicken- This wasn't anything liked all the grilled chicken I've had elsewhere. The uniquely done mashed potato side made it very different from the others and made it taste great.

Last but not the least, we ordered the hot fudge brownie and homemade apple cobbler both of which were out of the world. 

So, I'd recommend everyone to visit this place at least once and for me, I'd love to go there every month. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Awesome electrifying ambiance with a live DJ playing music video on a biiig screen. The servers are too good and they interact with you just like friends. We ordered pasta and grilled chicken. Both were superlative. The cocktail suggested by the restaurant guy was also good. The crowd was young and the music was foot tapping. We definitely had a good time.

Been there and do feel that food is not up to the mark. I have ordered Mac and cheese. It tasted like I am having pasta with fine flour. This is my 4th visit to any HRC(Bangalore,LA & MN) and I‚Äôm a big fan of American food.
Coming to the positive part and the service and ambiance of the restaurant will surely wow you. You will get some common vive of music around there.
Overall it‚Äôs a good place to hang out but unfortunately there are many better places out there.

Their Original Legendary Burger! 
A juicy 1 Lb Beef burger topped with smoked Bacon, Cheddar cheese, golden fried onion rings, crisp lettuce & tomato. 
The Burger was great & heavy ,perfect for one person's dinner/lunch. 
They have a very lively atmosphere and it felt like a really nice place to chill with some really good quality music playing all the time.

One of the most anticipated restaurants which Kolkata welcomed last year,Hard Rock lives up to it‚Äôs name.First and foremost the most beautiful feature of Hard Rock is it‚Äôs ambience,I fell in love with it.The cafe gives us all those American vibes where people go on to have drinks with their friends in the weekend nights and enjoy live music or watch live football matches on the big screen.Hard Rock has got all those elements and this restaurant just made me remember my dad because he loves music and this restaurant is full of it.Now coming to the food,we order pork bbq ribs or which was seasoned by their homemade hickory sauce.Ok I never had hickory sauce before tbh I never knew something like this existed so after having it,I could feel that the money was all worth it because the pork literally melted in my mouth and that sauce tasted amazing.It was neither too spicy nor too sweet,just having the perfect blend of flavours.I am so going to have those ribs when I visit Hard Rock again :3‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Then we ordered their original legendary burger which is their specialty.Ok I found the taste of this burger to be a bit bland because their were no flavours in it though the onion rings which were inside it tasted delicious though they could have been more crispy.
Lastly for desert we ordered hot fudge brownie and this thing came in such a giant glass it almost looked liked it was a trophy cup full of brownies and ice cream :3 It is quite impressive of them that they actually concentrated on presenting a very very soft and goey brownie which I don‚Äôt expect from restaurants in general because most of the cakes or brownies which doesn‚Äôt fall in their cuisine,taste like rubbish.So yes hot fudge brownie impressed me and how.You cannot complete that huge glass of goodness all by yourself so you have to share with your dear ones.Like I could feel that I cannot eat more of it but I wanted to continue so badly :‚Äô‚Äô3
Lastly the price is a bit on the higher side because the bill came out to be Rs 3300 for two of us but believe me it‚Äôs worth it.
Hard Rock is worth all the hype.Go there for it‚Äôs ambience,it‚Äôs music and obviously the food :)

So, I am finally reviewing, the city's latest hub, The Hard Rock cafe.
First things first, ambience wise HRC Kolkata is double storeyed and huge, but yeah nothing to go gaga, I felt, having visited both HRC Worli and HRC Saket. Also at this stage HRC is not serving anything beyond Tex-mex in Kolkata, so if you are not a fan, its going to be a disappointment.
The drinks menu is also limited. The legendary Kran-a-Kazi not being on the bar menu was a turn off for me.
The staff is somewhat lost. The expresso machines weren't working.

Now, the crowd!üòÇ

From 40 year old couples, to family crowds with creepy grandpas, it had it allüòÇ. Disappointment! Seems like all and sundry is flocking in, courtesy all the buzz. I hope the crowd shall be more chic and youthful when live performances go on floor, late at night.
Oh, did I mention? HRC was playing Bollywood instead of Rock yesterday?üòÇ
‚¨Ü
This was what I had written on Monday following my visit on Sunday. Today morning, I discovered my review has been deleted by the management, which was appalling. As an unbiased reviewer, I wrote my honest review, and if the restaurant management starts deleting negetive reviews, instead of solving problems of the visitors, then the whole purpose of Zomato, gets defeated. Honestly, my review's deletion or appearance hardly matters me as I'm not a professional food blogger or something, but I felt this to be an encroachment upon my fundamental right of freedom of expression, thus I wrote to Zomato about it, following which I see it reappear now.
I thought I visited Hard Rock Cafe Kolkata at the wrong hour, seeing all positive reviews and yet an underwhelming experience, so I was planning a second visit honestly to judge the place in its heyhour. But now I know why I only see positive reviews and my chances of a revisit are as less as my updated rating.

A place worthy of visiting! The giant global cafe chain finally landed in Kolkata and we couldn‚Äôt wait for it. Terrific Ambience. Will keep you rock n roll all the time. Awesome food. I would be short of adjectives if I start describing this place. Nice decor. Will definitely live upto your expectations with which we all visit Hard Rock cafe. There is even a store in the ground floor with rocking tees and accessories. Budget tip: Do try the jumbo combo platter. It will suffice two easily.

We actually visited this place on the eve of Christmas.I dint get time to pen down the reviews for a while due to busy schedule.Anyways time to analyze the every aspect of this cafe~
Food~
1.Classic Legendary Burger~Tasted good
2.Chicken Wings~Tasted delicious
Drinks~
1.Ordered two mocktails~Sorry for forgetting the names of both but both tasted amazing.
Quantity and Quality ~
Both quantity and quality wise the drinks and food are served in right proportion with proper quantity and quality.The food being properly cooked.
Presentation ~
The food and drinks are both presented in a very appealing way.
Behavior of staffs~
They are very polite and all are dressed up in a very rocking style.They will also interact with you once you enter HRC.
Now finally coming to the most talked about thing,the ambience~
HRC has got a rocking ambience which will really boost your energy.They have got live music facility and also rest of the time they play EDM too which is a treat to the ears.Right from the music to lights to the interior decor this place will surely amaze you.
Value for money~
Now if you want to enjoy your food in a rocking ambience you have to shell out some extra expenses.
Now coming to the overall verdict~
I really loved this place a hell lot and once you visit this place you will surely have a lively time.However when I visited this place I tried to order desserts which weren't available,neither half of the food items also.And they weren't serving alcohols also.I have rated it four just coz half of the food items weren't available at that time which highly disappointed me.
  So do visit this place once and I am sure you won't be disappointed at all.

Food on the plate: To be very frank I didn't like what they initially served which was a dull pizza. But after that  Mac n cheese and cocktails were good. Legendary burger was a good show but was okay okay in taste. 4/5

Decorations: the restaurant is nicely decorated  .From guitar of guns n roses to hat of Elton John to dress of Nicky Minaj. This place has it all. They have a souvenir shop at downstairs which has great collection of HRC stuffs but bit pricy. 5/5

Ambience: No one can match the ambience that Hard Rock cafe creates, and that is the only reason why it is Hard Rock Cafe. Great music coupled with Flash mob dance from their staffs can't be ignored. 5/5

Cost: cost is on the higher side. If you want to just have a drink and a burger and enjoy great music. Have a Walk through a pop museum, experience pop culture, then it is a must go. But if you want to party hard, I mean drink to the neck then you must definitely take your credit card along with your debit card. 4/5

My first visit to any pub in Kolkata.
I had visited Hard Rock Cafe Bangalore earlier. Compare to Bangalore , This place needs a lot of improvements.
Most of the drinks are unavailable as Hard Rock Cafe Kolkata was operating on Daily Liquor Licence. The ambiance is poor as local bands are not performing. Only few gigs are happening. 
But the food was awesome as usual. We were served by Firoz and he had done everything from his side to make us happy. Please try Pork Rib over there.

There has been a huge hype among the youngsters of the city as soon as Hard Rock Cafe opened its outlet at Park Street. And when we went there, we found so much more than we had expected.
AMBIENCE:
The place is huge. On the ground floor, there is a hard rock shop where you can shop from. The cafe is on the first floor. There is a huge screen, where rock songs are played all throughout. There is a DJ section to set your mood. The staff is just perfect for a place like this. They are all uber cool, yet hardworking and polite. They suggest you about the food and click pictures for you as many as you want. Yet they always have a smile on their faces. There are "rock treasures" all beautifully adorned on the walls and the lighting is just perfect. I believe this cafe has the best ambience in town. It is always boozing with so much energy and excitement.
FOOD:
This is where I found it a bit overrated. The food is quite overpriced, though tasty. The quantity is satisfactory.
What we tried:
Jumbo Combo NonVeg
Twisted Mac and Cheese
French Fries
The total pocket pinch was around Rs. 1200, which we found decent, if not comforting.
The jumbo combo was the best, the onion rings being scrumptious. There were a huge range of dips to have the food with.
Would I visit this place again?
Yes, many times, but may be go careful on the bill.

Hard Rock Cafe, Kolkata, much awaited place for Kolkata as well as for its dwellers. This was my first visit and it did met my expectations very aptly. The staffs are very courteous and friendly. They really guide you with your orders in terms of quantity as well (like how many dishes we should order). The variations in cocktails were much impressing and food tasted really good. Really looking forward for another visit soon.

Finally after a long wait....Hard Rock Cafe finally arrives to Rock Kolkata.Being a die hard rock and metal fan it was compulsory for me to visit this place.The ambience is no doubt excellent ,the foods awesome,one must try the chicken wings it's very tasty and unique in its taste.The price is steep almost the same as chilis.people who are die hard metal heads don't expect much from the music as they play only the bands and songs which are very popular, like non Jovi's it's my life,Bryan adams,coldplay.Sometimes they even play pop bands...I mean how can u play one direction in hard rock cafe.shouldn't you play bands that rock?? Led Zeppelin,motorhead, megadeth,iron maidenand many more.Few tracks they played were good though of gnr,enter sandman of Metallica, can I play with madness of iron maiden and system of a down.The staff there are very courteous and attentive they even forwarded my request for a track.

The name stands for itself.Being a much-awaited addition to the pubs in Kolkata, Hard Rock attracts a lot of guests, especially if its a Friday night (or any weekend evening for that matter), so our waiting time was really long, more than 50 minutes!!
But as you enter the pub the lively crowd and the awesome ambience welcome you to a happening experience of music, good food & great service! However, there is no live music or DJ, its a giant screen playing rock music. People of 90s will have a great time revisiting "Evanescence", "Red Hot Chilli Peppers", "U2", "Papa Roach" and "Linkin Park" followed by recent numbers too...
We ordered Hickory Smoked Berbeque chicken and Herbed Grilled Chicken, and beer and Electric Ice tea in drinks which was more than sufficient for two... However, I will suggest the truly value for money is the Jumbo Combo Nonveg which goes extremely well with drinks...Rs 2500 bill all included was pretty expected given that its Hard Rock. The highlight of the evening was the staff tapping their feet on YMCA!!

Hard rock cafe is in town. Finally!
Had to visit. Went to this much awaited place a few days back. I just loved the experience. Food was really good, but the best part was the ambiance.
Food we ordered-
1. Mashed potato- nicely seasoned mashed potato that came with a liquidy sauce. I enjoyed the taste of the dish overall.
2. Onion ring - crispy onion rings served with two different sauces. Crispy and tasty! I liked the sauce with mayo base, the red sauce, not so much.
3. Fajita- cottage cheese fajita, the whole assortment was perfect. No complaints.
4. Mac n cheese- delicious. My fav dish of the evening.
5. Mocktails- did not disappoint. Nothing out of the ordinary, but refreshing and good.
We wanted to have dessert, but there was no eggless option available other that basic ice cream, so that was a bit disappointing.
During our visit, the bartenders got up on the counters and danced to YMCA and a few other songs. I thoroughly enjoyed it! A very good experience overall. A must go restaurant for music lover!

The service is good as well and the food is simply delicious but the prices are a bit on the higher side. The liquor prices are fine. Will surely visit this place again and again for everything. Lastly when we were leaving the staff were dancing to the tune of the music which is a great tradition of hard rock cafe. 
The decor is nice as well.

Need I say more?!?
Food Ambience Service was simply Excellent
They were playing music of my favourite rock bands!
They prepared my steak within 10 minutes, it was juicy tender and delicious.
The burger was huge.
We had a mocktail Mango Berry Cooler which had a heavenly taste and was mesmerising.
Finally for dessert we had a hot fudge brownie. This one was absolutely mind-blowing and had so much of goodness filled in it.

If you're not aware of HRC reputation its time you visit it asap.
Highly recommended.
Cant wait to try out their other items and drinks.

In the ground floor, there is the Rock shop and in the First floor, the dining and bar.. When i went, it was buzzing with people so i chose a bar high tool. They still did not have the alcohol license, so it is available post 6pm. We went for the package they have, 3drinks and 1 food for 1499+gst.. We ordered 1 hurricane,1 liit and 1 mai tai one on and for food, fajita chicken flat bread. The liit and mai tai were amazing but the hurricane was not very potent to our liking. The flatbread was delicious. Service and ambience deserve full marks. Will visit again.

Having already been to the Worli and Bangalore ones, I feel this one still has a lot to do to live up to the brand.

While the food and beverages were great, the service was very poor. The guy never came back to check if we wanted something else from the menu after the initial order. Additionally, we had to wait for a very long time and ask repeatedly to get someone clear the table and bring the bill. And when the bill was produced, we had to again wait for another 10-15mins for the person to come and collect the payment and that too only after I had asked multiple times for  someone to be sent to collect the payment. Ordering and paying was a real pain. Definitely not what I have seen in the other HRCs.

All in all, after the food was done, we had to wait for close to 20-25mins for the bill and the payment to be sorted which was shockingly poor.

Also, note that they already add Service Charge of 10% and later again come back asking for a tip even after such poor service.

Music was as good as ever.

Coolest thing about HRC, the interiors are all so unique. That's a big achievement in itself, considering it's such a huge chain.
The collection of memorabilia is fascinating too. From Ozzy Osbourne's leather pants to John McVie's Fender bass, it's pure awesomeness!

Also, the only place in Kolkata with better music than The GRID.

So, I went with a few colleagues. Ordered rum, whisky and a mocktail.

For food, we ordered the legendary chicken burger, fajita and a tenderloin steak. All very good, as expected. I had the steak made rare medium and it was exactly rare medium. Very few places here that can do that. And I could have a kilo of those mashed potatoes on a full stomach; that good!

And the playlist is just perfect. It's like they can guess which song you wanna hear next. So you have these comfy sofas, beautiful lights, thumping music, delicious food and the entire staff suddenly getting on the stage and dancing to Y.M.C.A., you can't not love this place. They'll conquer the scene here pretty soon. We had to leave at at 9. There were at least 40 people waiting to get in.

Highly recommended!

I ordered Jumbo non veg and Barbeque cooked chicken.

1. Food: Horrible to say the least. I had to take anti emetics after taking the food.
2. Ambience: Good. Only reason to give 1.5 stars.
3. Staff: Negative markings should be given. 1st they gave us a seat in an isolated place behind which people smoke. After saying that we wont seat there they changed our seat. They also levied 10 percent service charge which is illegal as they are charging it directly.

Go here if you want to waste your hard earned money .

The most happening place right now in Kolkata would be here. Had to visit it. The ambience is really good. The people waiting on us were really cordial. The cost of food is really high. They also have merchandise there so that's pretty cool.
Presentation of food is amazing.
Try the classic hard rock cafe burger.
Overall a must visit.

All good things that you expect from HRC. Amazing ambience, staff and food.

 Ordered the Atomic Burger. The best Burger i had since coming back to India last year and it did justice to my  year long Burger craving. 

The red wine sangria was good as well. 

Two things to point out here for people new to HRC, like me: not a place where you go to have a conversation. You are usually shouting at your friends to be heard over the music. At its rather a heavy blow to your pockets.

Definitely a party destination every resident of Kolkata was waiting for long. Nothing new to be said about Hard Rock Caf√®. Superb and Excellent as usual. However, I'd like to highlight 2 things so that the management can take care of the same to ensure enriched experiences for the visitors.

1stly, being a long awaited party destination it's attracting huge crowd leading to long queues. But the most disappointing fact is that few of the  people came who may be are familiar or known to someone in the local destination's management and owing to that they're enjoying privileged entry without even standing at the queue. And if you raise your voice against this then you receive sarcasm. This is not expected from Hard Rock Cafe. I've visited quite a few around the country and even around the world but then this type of behavior is very disappointing.

2ndly, as per the GOI's rule paying service charge is completely at the discretion of the customer and he may chose to opt out. However my bill contained a service charge amount for which when I demanded explanation or removal of the amount no one paid any heed to it. 

Looking forward to partying Hard Rock Style

In trend these days,as it has opened newly in the town,so decided to pay a visit today. Though being a bit overpriced,the ambience here is just wonderful. It more or less makes up for the pricings. Plus the staff out here are way too good and they dance up too the beats of the music being played. The decor too is top notch.

Well well well !!What do we have in kolkata..
Yes my friends, Hard Rock Cafe is now officially part of the heritage of kolkata and to our suprise it has surpassed all the expectations and hype that we were looking for , thanks to an outstanding service and to the perfect ambience for a city of Rock Culture.
Being a food enthusiast,me and my wife choose the perfect date to visit this place .It is located above park mansion just beside reliance istore in park street. As it was weekend and most of us in kolkata was looking for a place to party,there was a big line beside its door step and i wont complain about it cause its worth it üòúüòú .After standing for 45 minutes we got our chance to enter this place. The entire chain is divided into two parts , on the ground floor they offer a ROCK SHOP which have all the collectables like beer mug, tshirts which are exclusive to HRC  . The main Cafe is on the 2nd floor and its very spacious with a big bar counter and a giant screen infront of which dance enthusiasts and drunk enthusiasts can indulge in the groove of some amazing collection of Hard Rock songs‚úåüèª.

After standing for sometime we met this guy ‚ÄòShankar‚Äô who introduced us to the best couple seat in the house and we found our new love for a place for party because the service ,behaviour that he offered on our first visit. 

We asked shankar to recommend us the best starter dish , so with his recommendation we took wings with hot sause and chicken tender fry , both the dish was well prepared and gave the perfect pinch to our drinks of the day which was a ‚ÄòCornora Rita ‚Äò  a perfect choice for me and my wife by Shankar .

With the night on the rise the party got a little bit dull but again to our surprise we got a surprise performance from the staffs of HRC. Another thing to watch was the song collection, they blend hard rock song with new pop chartbasters of 2017 which made the party more enjoyable for the crowd and the night glorious. As we were already very late we did not get a chance to taste their legendary burger which i will surely try on our next visit.

Suggestions: not needed for this legendary food chain , we want the same energy throughout the year and as for myself being a hard rock fun, i really am looking forward for the live performance and more and more hard rock song collection in the playlist .

Thank you HRC for completing one of my life‚Äôs goal ü§üüèª happy new year to all of you and JOY ROCK  üç∫ü§üüèª KEEP ROCKING IN THE HARD WAY

The name itself is iconic considering it was like forever in Kolkata‚Äôs wish list.So when it open its door finally in Park Street,  (next to GKB optics showroom), it was time to fill the checklist. The first thing is the atmosphere inside - rock music playing on a large screen and courteous smile welcomes you. The ambience was electrifying considering it was 30th dec night. We wanted to start with veg starters and hence we opted for jumbo veg platter.The quality of the same is decent (nothing extraordinary). However we love the grilled chicken that came next perfectly grilled and tender. Coming to alcohol their menu card doesn‚Äôt give u clarity whether the prices are written for 30ml or 60ml( do confirm prior ordering) . Alcohol prices are premium over here. A 60ml Vat69 will pinch you 550 bucks.Overall (3/5) rating considering a lot of food to be explored.
PS - They will charge 10% service charge flat unless u confront them when they will  drop the same from the bill, a practice they should stop immediately as per govt directives.

People like me , who are in search of a place with quality music and hangout with friends .. Hrc is a sure thing!

The legendary HRC burger with bacons n sumptuous beef patty is just the best in the city . Accompanied by Paneer shasilk n sex on the beach!!!!

I had an awesome time :)

This place is all about the feels and less about the food. 
This is not to say that the food is bad, but the ambience is what makes it the hype it is. The decor, seating and music is top notch but the show stealer is the staff. The staff is the coolest and the friendliest that you'll find anywhere in the city. And if you are lucky, you'll even get to see them climb on to the platform and perform a dance routine like a band of rockstars!
Coming to the food, the drinks are good, the food is good. Not exceptional but pretty good. The price, ofcourse, is high. But then, right now they are running an offer which is pretty good. 

Even if you don't get any discount offer, the place is definitely worth it.

I would have rather given a negative rating. Horrible experience with the staffs. I had ordered Sangria which I couldn't drink rather my white clothes had and that too all thanks to the super active staffs who made this incident happened. Never recommending this place to anyone. Other HRC's in delhi and Bangalore are far better according to me.

Hey guys, so I had been to HRC Kolkata this 24th, on the Christmas eve and the Park Street area was already so LIT and beautifully decorated. So HRC is in the heart of Park Street that‚Äôs in the Park Mansion. So due to the festive season, there was a cover charge of 2500/- per head which included unlimited Indian liquors and unlimited mocktails. 
‚ù£Ô∏èComing to the food, it‚Äôs so yummy and quite affordable as well. We started off with the favourite Non veg combo platter which is quite huge and has quite a number of variations including chicken wings, fish fingers, onion rings and more.
‚ù£Ô∏èNext up we had the Herb Chicken Steak ü•© which is again one of my personal favourites ever since I had one in Bangalore! It‚Äôs served with smashed potatoes and veggies.
Overall the place, ambiance, live music everything is just amazing and perfect for an evening brunch. üíñüëçüèª

Staff members are really courteous.. ( I recommend this guy called Diptashish). Missing: Live Music/ Comedy shows may be.. High Points: Ambience and Collection of Rock music.. Low Points: as of now..nothing.. Hope I can expect more..

Located in an easy to find location on park street,went there with friends on Christmas! We thought we had to wait for long as there was a long queue ahead of us but we got a table for 3 real quick.The place was a treat for the eyes with rock music playing on a large screen and photos and instruments of iconic rockstars on the walls.For starters,we ordered the jumbo non-veg platter which had 3 veg and 2 non-veg items with 3 dips.It was enough for the three of us and all the items tasted great but it would be better if they could include more non veg items in it. We also order mango berry cooler which was a refreshing drink with mango,pineapple,strawberry puree with lime soda.We got the Jamaican grilled jerk chicken with cheesy mashed potato and veggies.Finally ordered the hot fudge brownie (enough to share).We were awestruck with the amount served and it tasted absolutely delightful with whipped cream,walnuts,ice cream and hot chocolate sauce on top of one of the best brownies I have ever tasted! In all, the experiemce was awesome.Special mention to the staff who were super helpful. Will surely visit again :)

Been to almost 100 pubs and restaurants in the city and this is the ONLY place I just could not resist myself from giving a review. 

Firstly, the important question everyone has been asking about. Yes, liqour is available and from today onwards it will be available all day long. Not after 7pm like the previous week but from the time it opens.

For prices, check any other HRC outlet menu on zomato and it is more or less the same with hardly a RS. 10-50 variance on each item.

Now the good stuff. 
The ambience, I do NOT have words to describe it and I have NOT experienced such an amazing atmosphere in any place in this city. I might be a bit partial since they play the kind of music I like, but I sincerely think it would be very difficult for someone to not have a good time over there.

The service, and the attendants, again, nothing like I have ever seen before in this city. To whoever who was serving my table, sorry I forgot your name, you were awesome. 

No point talking about food taste and quality as it is the same (great, as expected) as other outlets and there are more than enough reviews over there.

Prices are a bit high, as usual for any HRC outlet but it's definitely worth it. 

Food - 4.5/5
Price - 3/5
Ambience - 10/5. üòä
Service - 10/5. üòä

Food is little costly. Ordered different desserts-Hot Fudge Brownie and Classic Diner Style Milk Shake. Both tasted really good.
Service was also good.

I had been waiting for years for Hard Rock Cafe to arrive in kolkata and finally it's here and it didn't disappoint . Firstly the ambience is true to the hard rock theme , the interiors have a classic timeless look  and adorned with rock memorabilia . Very friendly staff who suggest the right kind of choices from the menu . The music is ofcourse of the rock genre and the food is decent . 
Their LIIT is awesome , though I would suggest they can make it a bit more strong . 
I have been to Hard Rock cafes in Mumbai and bangalore and I personally feel this one is a bit smaller in size but they have made up for it with their grandiose . It's definitely worth a visit specially for rock lovers .

Hard rock cafe is a reputed name in the restaurant chain . They opened their first outlet in kolkata , park street . I visited on 25th dec 2017 . They staff were extremely nice.  The restaurant is decorated with pieces from metal and rock band stuff.  Overall ambiance is good . The food‚Ä¶.. overall food experience was good , as expected from such a brand . But I personally‚Äã feel the price should be a bit less , but that is, my opinion anyways . Someone else might think differently‚Ä¶

Located in the heart of Park street,just after the flurys signal,me and a friend hopped in after christmas today in the afternoon.Realised they don't serve alcohol before 7pm tsk tsk. Anyway we still went it and the decor is nothing as per the other HRC's in the country.I was a little disappointed.The place was almost empty and there was no hassle in there.The staff was very courteous and the service was very swift but the food was COLD.They served us cold fries with our smoked pork and chicken.The wings were salty and not sour or tangy or whatever the sauces mentioned.I cannot eat salty food and I very well know how tangy tastes.Anyway,the pork ribs were great and I loved it,so was the coffee and the strawberry lime drink my friend ordered. I think they need to work on this outlet a lot to get it right.

I've visited HRC in Bangalore and Hyderabad earlier and was never disappointed. In terms of food and ambience, this is a dream place to be for a music lover and foodie. The Kolkata outlet is nothing less. Finally a competition to Someplace Else!

Courtesy: Visited HRC Kolkata on 24th December which happened to be Sunday. However, thanks to the membership, was seated immediately. Staffs escorted us all the way to the table and since I was enthusiastic about live gigs, was seated  to stage facing table. Sam, our waitress, was too sweet to handle and helped a lot to figure out a proper order for two. Arindam, on other hand, suggested for a wonderful dessert for which I would be grateful to him. Not only that, but also both of them were jolly good fellas. 10 on 10 for that.

Food: Having tried their legendary burgers before, I ordered for chicken wings and steak this time. My friend opted for salad. All the food were amazing. The dessert, Oreo cheesecake, is what I call "Cherry on top". True to their fame for food.

Vibe: Do I need to even start! Killer ambience. Deadly decor. Super active and stylish Staff. And on top of that good music. Looking to have a good time - Sorted!!

Finally Hard Rock Cafe has arrived in Kolkata.

As soon as you enter, you are greeted with the "ROCK SHOP" and a bunch of really friendly staff who ask you for the number of heads in your group and amicably rush to check for table availability.

In the meanwhile, you can explore a bit in the "ROCK SHOP". I saw one of the patent white round neck T-Shirt. It was being retailed for Rs.839.

We were given the table in just 5 minutes. Seating arrangement is on the first floor and one of the staff escorted us to our table. After we were seated on our table, I just looked around and boy oh boy.. What an ambiance..!! Live music stage, a huge bar with the Hard Rock Cafe logo on top of it, a gigantic projector screen right behind the stage, huge musical instruments being displayed in glass cases all across the walls, different types of table (depending upon the number of people).¬†

This place was reasonably crowded when we went there in the later afternoon. The staff here is really well versed with their offerings and helped me in placing the order. The staff also had a very stylish attire and clicked pictures for us when we asked them.

We ordered the following:

*Veg Jumbo Combo Starters: This starter was a combo and included Bruschettas, Onion Rings, Spring Rolls and Potato Cheese Croquettes. All tasted good. The spring rolls and bruschettas were comparatively better. Onion Rings can be made a little less oily.

*Pasta Arrabiata: It was prepared very well with the right amount of veggies and it tasted very good.

*Mocktails: We ordered three mocktails and all were great in taste. Recommended Mocktail will be Mango Tango.

Now coming towards something which was the only disappointing part in my entire visit, the staff never served us water. We had to ask for it and then we were provided with the same.

Looking forward to more visits to this place.

Date of Visit: 23/12/2017

Number of Heads: 3

Bill Amount: Rs.2003

I had the best burgers and steaks of my life on HRC! 
From their warm welcome to their ambience, choice of music and food- I love absolutely everything!
While I got in, I was wished good evening by the lady standing in front of the door. Before taking orders the waiter will shake hands and introduce himself to you. 

They serve orders really REALLY fast. It took them around 8 minutes to serve us the juice , steak and burger.

They have a huge screen where they play mostly 80s rock, just exactly what I love. The decor is just like one expects in one of the best cafes. 

Coming to the food, we ordered Atomic burger(chicken), tenderloin steak, French fries, mango berry cooler and an ice cream served with brownie (I forgot the name, but you‚Äôll find it‚Äôs picture taking an entire page in their menu) for dessert. 
The burger bun was perfect, so was the chicken patties and all the other things stuffed inside. I feel they should increase the quantity of fries they serve. We had over cooked tenderloin steak which was absolutely perfect with the cheddar cheese (I don‚Äôt like my steak to be too chewy). Next time I‚Äôm going to have my steak topped with bacon. The juice was awesome, the first sip completely won me over. The dessert was also absolutely fine and enough for two people. 
I‚Äôll visit the place over and over again!

‚Ä¢Amazing ambience(reminds us of the golden era of rock culture)
‚Ä¢extremely helpful and polite staffs

I was just about to leave for kolkata when I saw news about HRC to be opening soon in Park Street. No place would have been justified for HRC other than Park Street! Located at a prime location , it was pretty easy to spot. Been to HRC's in Bangalore and Delhi, so was pretty much excited for kolkata. Finally I made it on the 25th. The place is pretty A! I loved the ambience. There was not much of a rush. Had to wait for 15 minutes, probably because they serve booze after 7(license issues). There's a giant screen where you could find your love for classic rock. They were playing Led Zep as I entered. The staff was pretty courteous and proactive. Order was served in no time! The food was absolutely delicious. Their pork ribs were out of the world! Yet to try out the burgers , probably the next time!

Much awaited ‚ÄúHard rock cafe,kolkata‚Äù the shutter is finally open and so we went with excitement.

The food was unquestionably amazing, ambience was undoubtedly excellent.

Sad part is THEY ARE NOT SERVING ALCOHOL YET, so don‚Äôt go there expecting some hard drink with some hard rock music.

Coming back to food, you must try the legendary burger, its one of the signature dishes, also the non veg combo is worth tasting.

I generally do not summarize my review at the very beginning, but this one will be an exception. In one sentence, HRC Kolkata is possibly THE BEST themed restaurant in Kolkata right now.

I will detail my today's visit summary as follows -
1. Management - Because of the Christmas Eve, Park street was packed with people and needless to say there was a huge crowd waiting to get inside this brand new joint. The management did the task of crowd management very efficiently. I must admit the entire planning was very effective.
2. Staff - Each and every memeber of the staff have been extremely courteous.
3. Food - We ordered Tupelo Chicken Tenders for starters, for main course Atomic Burger and Jamaican Grilled Fish Steak. The Tupelo chicken had a perfect blend of spices, and the burger's meat patty was very juicy. Since I am not a big broccoli lover, the veggies in the fish steak were a major setback for me, but that is a completely personal choice. The cocktail - Purple Haze and another blue thingey (whose name I forgot) were good as well.
4. Ambience - In one word "ECSTATIC". Even with lack of live music performance, the atmosphere was very lively and the choice of music was awesome. When the HRC staff jumped on the center tables to dance, all the patrons left their tables and joined in. It was an amazing scene.

I would surely recommend everyone to try this place at least once to bask in the experience. One small thing to nitpick - the waiter forgot one of our drinks order. I am willing to let that slide given the rush of crowd and loud music. I would call my experience a 5* experience and definitely visit HRC Kolkata again.

To the management, keep up the good work guys.

No matter wat the day is, wat the ocassion is, when you know Hard Rock Cafe (HRC) has opened in the city u should not waste time, wait for reviews and wait for the pics to mark ur footsteps into this legendary cafe.
AMBIENCE: IT WAAASSS ABSO-BLOODY-LUTELY AWESOMMEEEE. PERIOD!!
No words can describe the feeling, craziness and decorum with which HRC has been opened and i literally enjoyed every moment there.

FOOD: BIRA checked, double berry cooler checked, mango cooler checked.
That followed with two platters- one non-veg and one veg (Yes!! I had some pure veggie friends there accompanying me). But that didnt fill our apetite (probably coz we were craving for more from that place) so we went for steaks: tenderloin steak- best i have ever had in kolkata; chicken steak- soft juicy breast pieces with a unique sauce which complimented the whole preperation.

I dont have anything more to say except the fact that one should be there to witness a change in how a cafe is being projected in the city.

P.S- It was only the 2nd day after opening of HRC and they also have live performances by there super-cool staffs.

We were literally out of places to go on Christmas Eve for a lunch, but I always bore in my mind that Kolkata has come up with the best newest thing ever. Yes, it was none other than the Hard Rock Cafe outlet at Park Street and once we came across the glowing sign against a white wall and a large wooden door underneath, we couldn't resist the temptation of going in and checking it out even if it was for a lunch.

Now a lot of people kept asking afterwards if we had to pre book in order to get seats, I would like to mention that it's always better to make a reservation by either a phone call or a notification 2 to 3 hours earlier than you visit, but when we went there was a small queue and we were okay with standing outside for a while. It gave us some time to check out the HRC tees and goodies store on the ground floor and look at some of the memorabilia on the walls.

This was indeed my first visit to a Hard Rock Cafe outlet, but if you are a Rock and Rockn'Roll and this is just the best eatery for you. Once we got in, we went up a winding staircase to the main eating hall and was fascinated with the ambience and decor. In between is the provision for restrooms at a floor below the main hall. The wall is adorned by memorabilia of major rockstars over the decades from the early 1960s to the 90s. Elvis Presley, Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, Eric Clapton, The Beatles, The Doors, Freddie Mercury and Queen, you name it and they have a piece of memorabilia in honour of all these stalwarts up on the walls already. One could indeed get lost in time while going around the entire place clicking photographs and reading the bit of information written there about everyone if one is a true hard rock fan. There are television sets on some walls showing footage of people enjoying themselves at HRC outlets all around the world.

"Going around the entire place" surely does give you a hint about how large the eatery is, it indeed seats around 150 people with the ceiling being around 40 feet high decorated with reflective glass. There are arched hallways leading to every segment. There is a main sitting area in the front and there are places to sit on the either side of it. The main seating area overlooks a stage with a 7' x 7' screen in the backdrop, with provisions for colourful stage light and a projector to display videos on the screen. There is a music console placed right behind the sitting area, behind which is the mini bar with the very familiar glowing sign that says "Hard Rock Cafe."

Now we went in the afternoon, so there wasn't too much of a rush, and we were immediately shown to our seats by a gracious waiter, Suddam who was also prompt in handing over the menu and taking the order. The ambience was absolutely electric, with all genres of rock music being played loud enough for people to get into the mood as soon as they seat themselves. Here I must mention, that they serve alcohol only after 7pm and there are provisions for live gigs in the evenings which we missed.

We ordered 2 entr√©e dishes and one mocktail. The service was prompt and food was served hot. Herb grilled chicken and Barbecue grilled jerk chicken had two pieces of stuffed chicken breast with mashed potatoes and assorted veggies comprising carrots, broccoli and corn. Barbecue chicken was served with Barbecue sauce. Herb grilled chicken had small pieces of mushrooms sprinkled upon it. The chicken was soft and very well cooked. It felt juicy in the mouth, and delicious to taste, leaving behind a memory in the taste buds. The mashed potatoes were boiled properly and tasted just perfect with the sauce. They were considerate with the portions of food, but the price attached was slightly steeper than other eateries in the same area, I felt. The non alcoholic beverages had a lot of fruity options. Wild Berry smoothie was what we settled upon after much debate. It was served pink in a 400ml glass with a pineapple slice on top. It was an eclectic mix of bananas, coconuts, strawberries, pineapple, guava and other fruits I couldn't figure out by myself. It cost us close to 1400 for the items discussed above. Of course one is free to invest on other dishes, they have a wide range of burgers, appetizers, sandwiches and other options on entr√©e dishes. Non alcoholic beverages and desserts also have some innovation. However, I felt the number of vegetarian options were less on the menu, which could be a deterrent for vegans and strict vegetarians. Overall, 2500 for two (including appetisers, beverages without alcohol and desserts) is what one has to sign under the bill on an eatout or luncheon to enjoy a satisfactory meal. However, one could walk in to have a bite or two of their very exquisite sandwiches and burgers. A lot of options on bacon, ham, and beef are to be discovered.

Overall I would like to say, that the place has a lot of room for improvement on the menu. The Happy Hours in the evening, live gigs and provisions for keeping the restaurant open till midnight is what should probably be attracting a thick crowd in future to this outlet of an iconic multinational brand of eateries. As for me, I would really look forward to many more visits to the Hard Rock Caf√© in future.

Cheers!

Late upload..

1971 - London, 2004 - Mumbai & finally 2017 - Kolkata - the long journey of this iconic brand says all about it‚Äôs far reaching popularity.. The eighth outlet in India opened on Thursday and i walked in on the fourth day of it‚Äôs existence yesterday for a Christmas eve lunch and man what a lunch it was.. 

Ambience: My last visit to any HRC outlet was last year at their Gurgaon outlet but this one is something else altogether.. 161 seater spread over 10000 sqft across three levels - the theme is constant with all other HRC - rock and more rock everywhere you look - the walls are filled with priceless memorabilia of iconic rock artists of the world.. Huge ceilings covered with glass impressions add to the overall grandeur of the property.. The sound and light set up is undoubtedly the best in Kolkata for any eatery - you can simply spend hours inside the cafe just enjoying the music.. A separate stage set up with LED screens are in place for live performances which is the soul of any HRC across the globe - i  strongly hope this will act as a major platform for local musicians and their gigs and thus will be a great boost for indie music in town..

Service: Impeccable to say the least..

FOOD: Now, let‚Äôs get to the real deal.. 

#LEGENDARYCHOCOLATE: The chocolate shake was thick and delicious - very creamy and a complete chocolatey affair.. 

#ORIGINALLEGENDARYHRCBURGER: This is their flagship burger and it‚Äôs loaded with a half lb beefy buffalo patty, their trademark onion rings and loads of crispy bacon & cheese.. It tasted amazing for sure but the presence of too many vegetables (and that also cut too thick) for a hardcore carnivore like me was killing the meaty taste a bit.. Having said that, it is still legendary for sure..

#HICKORYSMOKEDRIBS: Now, that was truly the star of the spread - this was dope.. Seriously tender barbecued pork ribs (one massive cut) falling of the bone rubbed with their signature hickory sauce is a paradise for any pork lover.. It is far better than TGIF & even Chillis too both in terms of taste & pocket pinch.. You have to taste it to get that porky high feeling.. 

#CHOCOOREOBAKEDCHEESECAKE: What an ending that was to a grand meal.. This one looked attractive and tasted heavenly.. The thick creamy cheese cake layered with oreo chocolate was a melt in the mouth experience - something that will linger on my taste buds for a long time.. This one was epic..

Overall pocket pinch is slightly on the higher end but considering the kind of ambience, service & food & drink options in store for you - i would say that it is a fair deal.. Out here - it is not merely a meal - it is an experience to savour for a long time.. #ParkStreet is finally back with a bang.. 

Verdict: #STRONGLYRECOMMENDED (but choose your dishes wisely)

Journey of an #EpicureanCineTrotter continues..

As i recall the bits and pieces of  yesterday night's experience, i cannot but be thrilled with the Christmas eve we had with hrc Kolkata. It was an amazing cocktail of food, booze and music. Ambience is excellent and the huge floor space is the cherry on the cake for the party goers with the usual hard rock themed wall decorations. The 2499 package of three hours unlimited drinks was good and the interesting thing is that you can directly go to the bar and take your drinks away rather waiting for the waiter. Food menu was at par with the classic continental restaurants. The waiters were courteous, helpful and it was really nice to see them enjoying, clicking selfies, performing hand in hand in between, not to mention Dev, our buddy who was really cool. And oh the music, it was electrifying and the band  was also superb. Overall it was a galvanising one hell of an experience to start with and Kolkata have a new hot destination for the rock- head party people to look forward to. Cheers.

The newly opened Hard Rock Cafe has occupied the area , where , Veda used to be. The interiors are very well done , with dim lighting , souvenirs and a sort of hall of fame of legends and their artefacts. The ground floor is a shop selling Hard Rock Cafe merchandise. The restaurant and bar is upstairs. They have liquor license after 6pm . 
We ordered virgin mojito and chocolate milkshake which were good. For starters we had 
Jumbo non veg platter - it consisted of bruschetta , which was very crunchy and drenched in olive oil , with a Parmesan shaving on top , chicken tenders which were steaming hot and crunchy , egg rolls filled with spinach and corn , chicken wings which were well seasoned and onion rings which had a delicious panko coating. These were served with barbecue dip, sour cream , spicy honey mustard. A must have. 
We ordered chicken flatbread which was basically flatbread pizza with a pesto base , red cheddar and mozzarella with barbecued chicken on top. It was served with sour cream. 
For main course we had the Mac and cheese which was creamy and was served with two slices of baguette smeared with extra virgin olive oil ; chicken steak which was served with mashed potatoes , gravy and boiled vegetables , jerk chicken steak and the chicken atom burger. The burger was the highlight of the day as it was huge and had cheddar, fried onions and jalape√±os , a meaty chicken patty , lettuce , olives and their own seasoned mayonnaise. It was served with fries. 
The food at Hard Rock Cafe is really of great standard. The prices are reasonable for a pub/restaurant. However , we were a little disappointed by the  service. Our waiter wasn‚Äôt available most of time. The manager was very friendly and helpful. Great ambience and great food.

So this unexpected thing happned on our first visit here . 

There were two of us , famished and hopeful of finding our share of decent food . We decided to check out the place. what followed was unprecidented,to say the least.

While the ambience was top notch and the framed guitars only added to it, the place was pretty much full and crowded.

Despite the buzz, we got a decent seat and ordered our food , which happned to include 2 chicken steak dishes and one chocolate milkshake.

Staff members were very pleasant and polite.Rather friendly, if i must say. So far, the place was winning with its awesome vibe , soothing lights, music and friendly staff.

Then the wait began. 15-20 had passed and we decided to flag down our waitress. She informed it was a bit late and will be out soon. 

So we waited some more. Now, 45 minutes had passed since we ordered and she approached and informed us that the chocolate is no longer in stock , so we must choose between strawberry and vanilla.

At this point, we were hungry, frustrated and quite furious. We asked her to change it to strawberry shake and bring our food as soon as possible. 

The shake was out in 10 minutes and then we waited some more. We were tired and decided to pay or the shake and leave. 

As soon as we were about to, the manager himself hurried to our table and apologised profusely for the delayed order. He said the drink is on him and we must give them few minutes more. 

We decided to stay a little longer and see what they were up to. 5 minutes later, our food arrived , smoking hot and looking delicious. We couldnt wait a minute to hop in and started carving and biting into it as voraciously as possible. 

To say, the food was compensating for our foul mood, is an understatement. It was as good as they come. After a long wait of 50 -55 minutes, it took us only couple of them to devour the whole thing. 

We quickly asked for the bill and were getting ready to head out. Soon, the waiter arrived and informed us that the WHOLE BILL HAS BEEN TAKEN CARE OF. 

Shocked as we were, we asked for the manager , who in fact gave us a free meal!

He apologised once more and asked us to visit again. 'That's the least i can do' he said.

No matter how much we insisted on paying, he was just too adamant , sincerely so.

A long wait and then a surprise on Christmas eve, eve ... we couldnt have asked for a more dramatic turn of events. 

So folks, if you are in Hard rock cafe, even a long wait may turn out to be a blessing. 

Looking forward to visiting here again. The next time, we hope to pay the bill , so they better hurry up with the order.

In a nutshell, this was an experience we are not forgetting anytime soon. Thanks HRC. loved yall .

This recently opened place has been creating a lot of buzz among people. Being situated in one of the main party hub of Kolkata it is attracting a lot of crowd too. We had a long queue ahead of us and so decided to wait in the bar area. The crowd and music was awesome. But the food was just fine.

Ubercool ambience, funky rock music in the background, palatable delights in huge proportions, extremely warm hospitality with genuinely CARING staffs and the memorabilias which are actual hand me downs from the ICONS in ROCK music themselves- this outlet has indeed brought the best of HARD ROCK franchise to Kolkata......loved the ATOMIC BURGER, TEXAN SANDWICH and MANGO BERRY COOLER......met this staff from Hard Rock Cafe Mumbai who has come in as a trainer who gave me a wonderful tour around the cafe......indeed a memorable experience

Very friendly staff, great interior design. Dissapointed as no live music yet. Also no a la carte alcohol. Go for Burgers since they taste good. Mocktails are ok. Loved the dessert at the end.
Overall : will go again for some groovy music and atom burger!

Finally, HRC opened up in the 'City Of Joy'. Having been a regular visitor of HRC across India and abroad, I can openly vouch that Calcutta HRC has the friendliest staffs among all of them. Mr.¬†Asif and Shankar were friendly and quite welcoming. Coming to the decor, the place is filled with memorabilias of some of the legendary musicians like Bob Dylan, B.B.King, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, to name a few. For the food, THE LEGENDARY BURGER is a must have and will always be my favorite. The burger consists of beef patty along with smoked bacon, lettuce, onion rings and tomatoes. The beef patty was cooked perfectly to my liking. I took the Long Island Iced Tea for the drink which was a tad tangy for my taste. The only downside is that they have a temporary liquor license which is applicable after 7p.m.¬†
The big question is will I come back?
The answer is HELL YEAH!¬†
P.S. Always keep on playing the classic rock. ;)

Hi I am very hard core fan of HRC but after yesterday nights incident I do not know what to say I am totally numb . I always listen to music and was watching Eminem and coming down to staircase to leave for my home. I was rapping the tracks and watching the video when suddenly a lady crossed by asking for space. She then left off and went outside the outlet but within few seconds a guy who seems to be her husband started using foul language claiming that I showed his wife my middle finger which I didn't do to her. Every body was there including all store people and manager but no one opened there mouth at all and one of the HRC employee told to throw me out that word he used and then that guy started hitting me despite I told I have lens in my eyes. I was just waiting until he completes and get satisfied. Then i left the place . While I was walking towards to get a taxi one young couple told me why I didn't go to police and complaint. They told I should protest but it was so bad what happened. Thanks to entire staff and cree of HRC for accommodating me and love you gave for last 7-8 odd years across all the HRC. Finally all ends and now I believe there tag 'All is one'.... If we can't respect music and claim all this then better we don't 'Save the planet'..... Bye... Complaint has been raised to HRC world wide team and ipenforcement team ,..... But complaint is not a solution .. good bye HRC... Do your business..

Guys, you have done a great job by opening HRC in the heart of Kolkata. Let's expect that the standard will remain to where it belongs. Keep on updating in your FB page if you are going to organize any shows on weekends or for that matter. And please upload the menu card over here :)

Kolkata finally has HARD ROCK CAFE located in the Park Street Area. The place is absolute lit with simple but fantastic interior, great staff members, live music and obviously great food. I went there with my friends and were the first guest to visit the place. We were welcomed with cheers and claps by everyone. The place is definitely amazing. I would love to visit the place again ‚ù§

We went to Hard Rock in Kolkata with great expectations, having experienced the cafe in other places and we were not disappointed. 
Great ambiance, excellent food and to top it all, awesome service. Easily one of the best places in Kolkata.
