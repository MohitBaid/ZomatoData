Given the area and crowd, would have not opted to eat from here. But given the situation and urgency, we had to. Tried their rolls only.

It's situated just beside simla biriyani... it's mainly a takeaway fast food joint... if you want to have there food there, you have to sit on the road side bench and have it... when I reached its just 7:00 pm and the counter was fully crowded... I have there chicken chowmin and a egg chop... both are good... it's very unhygenic place... staffs are little arrogant, but it's ok you can't expect anything more form such a ordinary place... service was fast... positive things are quantity they provide is huge and it's very pocket friendly options in the locality...
