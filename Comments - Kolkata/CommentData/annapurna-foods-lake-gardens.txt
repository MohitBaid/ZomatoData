Located at Lord's crossing, this joint provides Indian and Chinese food at cheap prices with stress mainly on quantity.
The Chicken Chaap on display looks tempting but is too oily and solidifies easily.
Their Momos are good but the thickness of the dough can be made thinner.
If you're alone and low on cash and need to have a meal,let me suggest their Chinese combo pack - Chicken Fried Rice(more than sufficient for 1 person),2 pieces of Chilli Chicken with ample gravy and a piece of Chicken Lollypop/2 pieces of Fish Finger(depending on availability). All this for just Rs. 100.
So if you're low on money and really need to stuff your stomach, their combo meal is a viable option.
But a word of caution,if you're a hygiene freak,do avoid this place at all costs because their hygiene is questionable.

This is a small kiosk but the food served is great. You get all types of veg and non veg food items. Momo is delicious. A plate of chicken momo with 6 pcs of momo is worth every penny. Each pc is full of chicken. I also had chicken kebab which was delicious.  U get a biryani combo too which is so pocket friendly  and af@fordable.  Good place for take away however  eating there is difficult as u have to stand and eat.

But didn't like the mixed fried rice & chicken chaap. Chicken smelt bad & didn't seemed fresh.

Chinese products are good enough. Will not recommend Biryani from this restaurant as their are two more better biryani giants close to this with almost same cost.¬†

Overall good for Chinese and Fast food.

Annapurna Foods is located at Lords More. This place definitely runs because of it's location. We were at a friends place nearby and hence, we decided to do a takeaway from this joint.¬†
=====
What we ordered:-

‚Ä¢ 3 Chicken Rolls - The rolls were very average. Nothing extraordinary. Just like a street food roll shop.

‚Ä¢ Chicken Cutlet - The chicken cutlet was stuffed and had a very thick coating. They took sometime to fry it. Tasted fine but then, health wise not at all.¬†

=====
Pros:

¬†
‚Ä¢ Prime Location
‚Ä¢ Pocket friendly
‚Ä¢ Service speed is good.

Cons:¬†

‚Ä¢ No proper hygiene.
‚Ä¢ No proper ambience.¬†
=====
Expert Suggestion:

‚Ä¢ Keep your place of work clean.
‚Ä¢ Make the coating of cutlet less thick.

One of the most brightly lit up take away joints in lake gardens. It is bound to catch anybody's attention. This shop initially started off with rolls and fast food, but now they will satisfy your taste buds with almost anything. Too bad that they can't accomodate an outdoor seating. These guys are pretty fast in preparing and serving food. Food comes sufficient quantity. It might seem a bit pricey as compared to other fast food vendors nevertheless quality suffices the cost.

One more take away joint in the food hub that the Lords crossing has become in Kolkata.

Proximity to my office which is full of foodies like me has made us regular customers.

However today we zeroed in here when our favourite chicken cutlet was not available at the adjoining Samrat.

So two dozens of chicken cutlet were packed from here and consumed immediately.

Solid chunk of chicken and a hard crust but a heart of gold.With mustard and Bengali tea afterwards......the festive season is here folks!!!!!

Annapurna is mainly a take way restaurant located at the lords more. I goes there almost once a week. I just love their tondoor dishes. They're good in North Indian dishes. Chicken tandoor and Chicken reshmi kebab are two dishes I always buy from there. The price is cheap and quality is very good.

Its a take-away counter and home delivery too. Its an Aam Aadmi's food joint but you will be surprised by their chinese preparations. I have seen them from their inception since lake gardens falls in my regular route and do feel that Chinese is their strong point over Tandoor. Amongst all the hyped in and around lake gardens/golfgreen, Annapurna Food's price vs quality/quantity remains unmatched till date. Don't get confused, there's 2 shops by same name - the one on the left Annapurna Foods is the authentic one (right one is aweful). Attaching herewith recent menu cards as the ones above are extinct, hope this helps my fellows foodies out here.

Well mine called for a Thai chicken and Chicken Rezala along with Fried rice. Food is average...quantity...well..some of it is still left over.
Every late night travellers and IT zombies should try this at least once...especially the Thupka and Momos

Food is average. They deliver sufficient quantity of food at low prices, the momos being exceptions (I think momos are a bit overpriced in this shop and don't taste good either). But the food quality is not very good. More or less in every rice preparation one finds the rice a bit undercooked. Home delivery service is prompt.

Amazingly delicious n shockingly cheap!!chinese cuisine is at par with any other lavish restaurant.... Tibetan thupka is mouth watering... Kebabs n rolls are nice too... 

Only one demerit.... Improper waste management leading to disgusting odour around the place... They wash their dishes and dispose all waste around the road which smells like a dumpyard.... 

Choice is yours !! This is the best place for deliciously unhygienic food..

The name suggests its natur in culinary business becuase the archaic meaning of Annapurna is one who feeds you well and it definitely does that.

We ordered for probably 5th or 6th time and its as good as that of the first time we had. Can not say very authentic chinese like the Kolkata Chinatown food joints, but its very good food with more than sufficient quantity. We ordered Schezwan fried-rice and chicken with fried-rice, dry chilli chicken and garlic chicken. The taste is far better than any other eatery at this price range. However, not all the items in the menu are good to taste. They are to be left alone when choosing for an ala-carte order. Economic price list for the entire ala-carte menu.

The most surprising and truly appreciable thing is the owner himself came to deliver food all the way to Ganguly Bagan in his own car as he was short of delivery staffs for it was a Sunday. This shows their professionalism and dedication.

Few improvements like better packaging with plastic containers and an updated printed menu card with every delivery would get them more business I guess.

A perfect take away place. Being a resident of Lake Gardens, this place is like my emergency get away. Though they're growing very fast with the pricing but nevertheless the food is better than the most other kitchens in the locality.

Annapurna Foods is a small eatery located at Lord's More. Just beside Kalpana Sweets, this place serves good food. 
Though their kababs are the only thing i love.. . The reshmi kebab is a must try. 
Egg roll is ok type.. more on the Bland side.. 
Their chicken momos are good. The sauce used to be a bit spicier before. The soup served with the momos is palatable. 
All in all, a good food joint. I am an extremely irregular Customer ?

Annapurna is a favourite when we hang out at some friend's place, near the area.
We mostly order the combo meal of chicken fried rice, chilly chicken (4 pieces) and fish finger (2 pieces)
At just 100 bucks, your tummy and soul, both are well satiated...
Also, we get it delivered at the homes of the respective friend, so...the comfort factor is an added bonus...



Must add that their Indian Combo is just mindblowing. The last time we ordered a dinner from here I wished to order the Indian combo in place of the Chinese one that I always order. It was just unbelievably good. A huge quantity of rice and an abundance of cashew and raisins in the Khuska Polao, succulent chicken pieces (albeit in a little oily gravy) and perfectly done sheek kabab. All for just 110 bucks.

This food joint is located at Lake Gardens Lords More Crossing.They have variety of rolls, chicken pakora, chowmien,fried rice and kabab. I liked their chicken momos which are quite tasty.Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet are something which are recommended.
Their quantity is good and the food tasty.Last time I paid a visit, besides indian, chines and tandoori dishes, they were also serving thukpa.

It's a take away. The momos and shaslik kebabs are amazing. They used to serve pulao and mutton kosha in their combo lunch pack. I wish they would bring that back.

Had   the  momo   from  this  place  a  few  months  back    and was  quite  happy   with  the  experience!  The  momo   was  soft  and   filled  with  chicken... the  read  chili  sauce was   good  enough   and   the  soup   surpassed the other   road  side  small  places...it  was piping  hot  and  had  quite  a  nice  flavour  to  it! Would   like  to  visit  for  more  soon!

A personal favourite of mine for snack items and i have tasted most of their items over the years as this place happens to be close to my residence.Lords Bakery crossing has plenty of street food options but this place stands out from the rest. Prices are reasonable as in most footpath joints but the best part is that they have managed to maintain the quality of their items on offer. Recommended items- chicken chow mien-both dry and gravy options, chicken momo, rolls, fish fry, fish finger, chicken cutlet and the staple chilly chicken. Quantity is adequate with quality stuffing. I cannot comment on the prawn dishes as i am seriously allergic towards sea food.Strongly advised to pack the food  as it is not feasible to have the food right on the busy pavement amidst the cacophony on the streets.

I am a fan of certain small places, and this one, smack right on the Lake Gardens Lords More Crossing, and while waiting for the bus to come ( I hate Bus No. 223) I have often packed away food. They have a nice assortment of rolls, especially chicken and mutton rolls, but they also make a nice chicken pakora, and a decent enough chicken chowmien. My last order was a garlic chicken (boneless), Chicken fried rice, and the chicken seekh kabab. the chicken sheekh kabab was nice, with small chunks of chicken. I also really like their chicken momos which are soft, tasty and value for money.

This place provided a decent enough option for people who live in and around Lake Gardens and has quite a fan following among the locals .  Its situated at Lords Bakery beside the equally popular Samrat. Try out the Fish Fry , Chicken Cutlet , Chilly Chicken (Boneless) , Chilly Prawn and Egg Chicken Chowmein all of which are pretty decent. Portions and price are both good as well. I am looking forward to trying the Chicken Momo's based on the recommendation of my fellow foodie  Payal :-)

I am pretty surprised with the Zomato ratings about this place because it is definitely better than just a well or average. Though honestly I have not tried several items on the menu, the ones that have remained as the champions have to be the chicken momo and chicken cutlet. They give 6 pieces of momos for 60 rupees which is pretty much the average price at any other shop of this scale. But what makes it better than other places is the stuffing. The stuffing genuinely has chicken and not just cabbage and onion. It is also stuffed well, as much a momo needs. It is absolutely wrong to have a notion that until momos are stuffed to the brim, it is not a good one. Actual momos always have a certain air gap that allows the steam to rush out with a bite.
They carefully pack the stalk too for takeaway which is a bonus point. The stalk is stirred well with spring onion, carrot and pepper, making it go perfectly well with the steaming hot momos. The chicken cutlet too is really worth appreciating because it does not drip oil, tastes good, genuinely has a slab of chicken coated in a tangy-sweet-chilli marination. I enjoy having both the cutlet and momos with the chilli sauce they provide. It is basically a really good takeaway option in the Lake Gardens area brimming with several fast food restaurants.
