It was my 1st experience to order at this restaurant, I ordered cheese grilled sandwich & brownie was complementary from zomato.

cheese grilled sandwich - they send it with chips, like which was good. cheese was melted & mixed well with mayonese which was delicious to eat....

brownie - they send liquid chocolate in a pouch which was good & only few restaurants do this, which was impressive. brownie was very soft & fluffy & it was walnut brownie too. it was a good experience to order from them.

I am going to review only the food here. This is a casual cool joint with lots of games ranging from foosball to pool, Jenga and a lot of other board games too.Food served is purely vegetarian. Had crispy chilli babycorn,spaghetti aglio olio and a Spinach Cannelloni. The crispy chilli babycorn was the best I had in quite a long time.It is crispy on the outside and had a hint of sweetness as well as spiciness. The spaghetti was disappointing though. It had dry red chillies and a lot of oil with negligible grated cheese on top. Seemed more Indian than Italian. Cannelloni was good though it the spinach was very less and the sweetcorns were too much in quantity.All in all, an above average meal. This place is great for kids.

I went to this restaurant during the Durga Pujas with my friends and it is one of the best veg restaurants I've ever been to. The food was delicious and the staff members were cordial. We ordered Penne Arrabbiata, Spaghetti aglio olio, Baked potatoes, Cold coffee with ice cream & Kitkat shake. The Kitkat shake was extremely tasty & my favourite, all the other dishes were also quite nicely done. 
It has a selfie corner as well as a gaming zone, which is sure to attract kids & teenagers.

I'm yet to visit the restaurant but have ordered from this place few times. They seem to have a decent list of items on their menu, but I love Chinese, do that's what I sticked to. Usualy I do not order any "special" from anywhere because one never knows what other's "special" is. But given the reviews this restaurant has received over time, I thought I should put my faith in them. In my recent delivery, I ordered Smash Street special fried rice, vegetable manchurian and my favorite snack, nachos. I must say, there was nothing special about the fried rice, the nachos' toppings felt dry and boring and the manchurian balls a tad bit less fried. Yet I give them 3.5 because it tasted fairly good, didn't give me an upset stomach and I slept well. Waiting to visit the place where all the "smashing" happens

Good food, board games, pool table, foosball. You want more? There's this game similar to paintball but with lazer guns. It's really worth a try. 

Must visit.

The best Veg Cafe in town. we usually  always go out for non veg but it was pujas so chose a veg one which turned out to be quite a good decision. we did not regret even for a single time for  compromising with veg food instead of non veg. the crispy chilly baby corn, pizza, pasta , kitkat shake and death by chocolate indeed slayed us. the ambiance with the little games indeed made the visit much more interesting. the service was fine and the staff are cordial. they have got ample of options for you to choose from the menu. would love to visit again.

Went today with my Sister's & Brother's for bhai dhuj celebration . This one is easy to locate. Just above Gupta brothers , near BF block swimming pool.

One of the worst management I have ever seen in Kolkata. They have just opened a cafe without any knowledge of hospitality

Food is OK ok but the management will definitely spoil your mood, its a very noisy place.The games are just around the food tables and the noice of people playing makes the experience just like you are sitting in Fish Market and when complained to the management they will reply in simple words " WE ARE HELPLESS". They don't Know at all how to handle all guest at a time.  The path to lift is whole slippery and oily as it is used by Gupta's to bring sweets to their shop. 

Don't waste your money by going here 
Will recommend to avoid this place as there are many good option now in Kolkata

The ambience is laid back enough, although who charges for foosball man?
The servers are prompt but utterly clueless.
The service is fast and food affordable.
The cheese garlic bread was tasty.
Schezwan rice was good enough.
So cheesy pizza tasted too much like ketchup, if you like ketchup on pizzas, this ones for you.
Death by chocolate was tasty.
When asked what the difference between death by chocolate and chocolate sundae was, we were they were the same dish but with a 4rs price difference.
Not a place i would recommend at all.

nice decor, kids friendly, added game area, good option to throw veg birthday parties. Their pure veg (non Jain) foods are lip smacking. They make very good quality smoothies with lots of options. Staffs are very knowledgable and can read customer's mind. Other restaurants in this segment should learn from them. It's very popular in this area already. Very rejuvenating experience every time.

One of the limited cafes offering arcade games. You get a football style pool game apart from a game of pool. Loved the 3 player ice hockey, saw that here for the first time. Also it has a collection of board games to keep you hooked up in your place. Though its enjoyable but they cost much, no games credits is given for the food you purchase. You got to pay separately for it.

Games are enjoyable when you are playing, not when you are an audience there and have come for fooding.
Tried a corn canopy which was the only thing I liked here, small corn tarts filled with goodness. The kitkat shake lacked thickness and didn't find any kit kat crunches in it. The lasagne we ordered was indeed a joke. No lasagne sheets in a lasagne, it was something between a lasagne and gratin, it was also very low on quantity.

The games are just around the food tables and the noice of people playing makes the experience not appreciable for the dinners. Would have loved it had the interiors had separate portion for dining, and not just between the games.

So starting with there was a selfie booth where u can take selfies with various props, then there was a pool table, a room for virtual gaming and laser tag was also available. In short this can be one of the coolest place to have fun and chill with friends. Now coming to food, we ordered a veg schezwan rice, Paneer Manchurian and a pizza (any 4 toppings). The quality of food was just amazing and this was the best pizza I have ever had. The staffs were courteous and the service was quick. Really had a good time.( Deserve 5 star rating)

Entering the space, one would feel incredible due to the marvelous ambience created here with the great lighting, aesthetic environment and awesome interior decoration. There are a wide variety of games here which are super fun and include a wide variety. Coming to the food, it's so delicious one would wipe clean their plates right away. Long story short, it is definitely one of the best places to visit in Kolkata to have fun with friends, eat great food and hangout together. 
PS - They enable you to capture these memories too with their very own selfie station with cool props!

I would have given it a minus 5 star if possible. But anyway coming to the Point, I found this place to be horrible with horrible food and no good quality in games. Even they had a foosball that was damaged and they charged that separately. I ordered a pizza it was not upto that mark. The staff can't control the crowd like the children running everywhere. So I would recommend that this is not a right place if you want some good food or time.  Literally SMASHED OUR DAY.

We had Napolitano crust pizza which was well balanced and reasonably well priced. Customer support was great . Although I would say the Activity zone should have been more spacious.

I ordered Pizza and got a complimentary brownie with it.

As mentioned by me in my order chat, I am highly disappointed with the order.

Quality issues:

1. I had stomach aching for 2 hours.
2. The food was soiled and tasted bad.
3. The pizza looked like it was soaked in some bad oil or bad cheese.
4. Spinach used was not fresh at all. It was smelling.
5. Tbh, the whole pizza was smelling odd.
6. Food was not fresh. Rather the raw materials used were not fresh.

Quantity issues:

1. The toppings were like feeding a baby. I could hardly see the topping.
2. The brownie which was complimentary, was shown as charging 160. It was like, please at least give some quantity. If it would have been cost of 80-100, I could have understood.

Packing issues:

1. The packing was moderate.
2. The packing charges are shown as 20 for each stuff. The packing is worth 5 rupees, not 20.

Pricing is so high for such a tasteless and soggy food. I will never order again.

Moreover, I had such a heavy stomach ache, that I could not eat post coming from office.

I still have stomach ache.

Attached are 2 photographs of the packaging. Not at all Upton the mark.

Veg restaurant which also allows u to play indoor games

Food: The place serves veg food. We ordered a veg burger, Cheese sandwich and Greek salad. All of them tasted shit, only the salad was palatable. Along with this, we ordered Hazel Nut Coffee Sparkle, Death by Chocolate and Sizzling brownie. Sizzling brownie and Death by chocolate was good. But the Sparkle thing was so damn worthless that we felt like puking.

Ambiance: The place has a lot of collection of games and selfie rooms with props. However, almost all the games are paid, which means u cannot access them without paying extra bucks. Due to the presence of games in the place, u will get a lot unruly rich kids creating chaos all over the place. So, don’t expect any privacy. The entrance of the restaurant is shabby as well. It is located near the swimming pool of sector 1.

Service: Service is so-so. Takes a lot of time to serve. Cash and card is accepted. Pocket pinch is very high. 

Overall: I am not gonna visit this place anymore. But if u are a vegetarian and love irritating kids screaming beside ur table, u can always drop by.

We went to Smash Street to try out the Laser Tag there. We took the 299(+taxes) combo which gave us one 12-minute game of Laser Tag, one starter and one mocktail/shake. The first time we went, the food was amazing, the drinks were 300 ml each and we had enough food to share with the five of us there. Laser Tag was amazing too, the best fun we had! And it definitely called for a second time!
However, when we went there the next time, we were twelve of us and we took the same combo but this time the drinks were served in 100 ml glasses and the food was okayish. And, also, we had to split into groups of six each cause they had only six jackets, and one of the jackets wasn't working and responding to the laser shots hit.
This previous experience dropped the rating from 4.5 to 3!

Laser tag? Foosball? Dart? Photo booth with props? Food? If you want them all under one roof, this is the place to visit. However the lack of maintenance of the interior and the couches left me a lot disappointed. The food is okayish, nothing extraordinary. The service is slow, but if you are planning to spend a day with your big gang while engaging in various fun activities, you can consider visiting this place.

Not a very good experience. Ambience is okayish. But the food is highly disappointing. Especially the quantity,Which is not even sufficient for one person.
The Zomato app recommended potato rosti to be their best fish , so we tried it out. But it tasted very bad. Then we ordered pan fried noodles, pasta and babycorn, all of which were very less in quantity and nothing great in taste. Not going there again.

One of the best places to hang out with friends. First, get inside and play some games, while you get in the mood to eat. Then, order starters and eat some. Then more games!!!! Laser tag or pool afterwards maybe. dinner time thereafter! 

Get groovy and get crazy, one of the best places to visit I with friends.

I along with my girlfriend went for the first time. We went during lunch hours. The ambience was very good. Lots of games for kids as well as adults. Good to see that they were not serving hookah which made a ideal place for family and kids. Now comes the food. We ordered mango juice and redbull mojito. Mango juice tasted as usual but redbull mojito tasted very well. Manchow soup was very delicious with perfect taste of garlic and all spices added in it. White sauce pasta was also very good. The service was prompt and quick. Would give 4.5/5, 0.5 deducted bcoz the choice of music played was not nice as compared to a cafe. Else everything was good and would like to visit again.

Located near swimming pool area, Salt lake, this is one one the coolest place to be in. The selfie booth with props, different board games, table games, dart, etc, makes this place an ideal hangout place for the young generation. The food is also great. We had Spicy Pan Fried Noodles which was full of authentic exotic veggies, Napolitano Pizza, and the yummp Kikat Shake.

We tried chinese starters and italian main course, everything was flavorsome and tasty. However sizzlers were a big disappointment, dry and bland, recipe should be improved upon. Alltogether, a fun place with something for everyone.

Place and food is good.
But I have been experiencing issues. I had once shared my number with them for a booking, and since then this cafe sends me promotional messages from different random numbers everyday.  I even get texts at 2 in the night from random numbers on WHATSAPP.  This is harassment. There have been at least 10-15 such numbers already. This has left me with a very bad experience and I would discourage people to visit this place as your privacy can be in danger, just like mine.

A sudden plan at this place was made with high expectations which could not be met since all the highlight of the place, i.e., all the games were chargeable.
However, this dissappointment was made good by the lipsmacking pesto penne pasta - it was as creamy as it could be with a perfect balance of basil and cheese. The pizza was good but the hakka noodles lacked the necessary spices and should never be ordered without manchurian.
The place is a must visit if one is looking forward to clicking pictures, have food and spend on games.

Went there to celebrate a friends bday. I was sceptical about this place but trust me its a must visit .
Talking about decor its nothing extraordinary but nice ,they have some half circle type of seating arrangement.
The food there was awesome we first ordered the smas street special potato rosti - it was grated potato pancake with lots of melted cheese,though the quantity was bit less but it was yum ,next we ordered cheese garlic bread ,nice n crunchy it was.For the main course we ordered chili garlic noodles ,schezwan rice and paneer manchurian .The noodles had a very distinct flavour of garlic which i loved the most next the paneer manchurian was good it had six small manchurian balls , and the schezwan rice was good too.
We also played 3 rounds of foosbal ,lasertag and car racing , i loved playing foosball and lasertag. It costs us around 1200+ taxes so i felt that it was a bit high on pocket.
And yes they have a selfie booth where you can click pictures using the props.
The behaviour of the staff was extremely cordial ,they were very friendly.
We enjoyed a lott.A must go if you love playing games with some lip smacking food items .
Thanks smash street for making the visit memorable for us.

Sorry Sourav and Sovit for making my debut to your place so late but better late than never right. This place redefines the whole cool cafe concept of a great dining experience with games and a super cool selfie corner. I loved the decor simple and comfortable. They boast of so many attractions like laser tag, pool, air hockey and a variety of board games to spend quality time with friends or family.

The food was great. We ordered for Dahi kebab which was slightly dry for my palette but the flavors were bang on. The tandoori aloo made in mustard oil was different and unique and beautifully grilled. The extra kick of basil on the veg au gratin made it different. The high point of my eating journey was the fusili in pesto sauce. The perfect balance of basil and garlic made the pasta absolutely lovely. Garlic bread with cheese was perfectly baked.

Coming to the drinks, we had the kitkat shake and oreo shake. I liked the oreo shake more but both were nice. They were not very thick which makes it easy to drink. It had the right consistency and perfectly sweet.

Cannot wait to go back and try some other stuff on the menu.

Since we went their in odd time, didn't find the decor very appealing. I was expecting a very cosy Ambiance but instead it turned out to be normal. It's not that big even and moreover went their out of peer pressure since m not fond of veggies. The place is divided into many sections-food,selfie,gaming etc. They charged extra bucks for game. We went their with lil deals offer.
The offer include
1 round of foosball-The game was not even working.
2 cold coffee-ok ok type
1veg pizza/pasta- We chose 4 toppings pizza and instead of that we were served paneer tikka pizza
1 cottage cheese cigar- Very simple nothing extraordinary.
And we ordered 1 extra cheese sandwich- It was also very normal for me.
For me it was'nt that great and I won't recommend it until any one of our foodie turns out to be a gamer!

Went to this place on a birthday party of a kid. This place is located in Saltlake swimming pool area on the 2nd floor of Gupta brothers. Interiors are just ok with very limited sitting area. Foosball tables are broken, pool table is quite small and air hockey is not as per standard. Baby corn was not crispy, pasta was just ok and pizza was not that great. Noodles were good. Not recommending.

This place was in my list since I read about it.But it turned into a horrible experience.I went for chilling out at this place after pandal hopping for the whole day.My legs were paining terribly and thanks to the ugly and elusive location that it made things worse.After a lot of hard work when we finally reached there,we were shocked to see the shady ambience. The interiors looked as if it was done years before and no maintenance was done since then.We tried Cola float,which tasted bad and dull. The Kitkat shake was made by a miser, i guess.No trace of kitkat  except, 1/4 of a stick floating on the top.It tasted like kid's chocolate milk.
The games cost a bomb.I don't know for what.The selfie zone was too small for even two people to stand comfortably.
Overall bad experience.Never coming back.
P.S-The waiters almost irritate you to order stuff as soon as you step in.They will just hover beside your table till you order.You can't even settle down comfortably and talk to your friends for few minutes.

This place is without a doubt an entertainment paradise. They have so many different games and activities lined up that you could easily spend your entire day here without allowing boredom to seep into your street (pun!).

If we just talk about the ambience or the myriad varieties of games that they offer, this place would easily get a score of perfect five. However, if we add the food, the awesomeness tones down a bit. I am definitely not implying that the food is bad. Far from it actually. The food is very good and on a general day, it would appeal to a majority of people who love vegetarian dishes. The thing is, the food here pales in comparison to the epic atmosphere. 

I tried the Dahi Kebab, the Smash Street special Sizzler, and a Kit-Kat shake. The Dahi kebab was more or less good. It had a home-made feel to it and the mint chutney accompanying it was actually very tangy. 
The sizzler was kind of underwhelming. The taste was okay-ish. Not the best sizzler I have ever had. Also, the quantity was rather toned down. 
As for the shake, it was actually very good, however, I must add that its taste was very ephemeral. The taste of melted chocolate didn't linger and that's quite disappointing. 

The place can work on its food which is good but can be improved a lot. As for the ambience, it is just perfect. A nice spot for hanging out with buddies.

Very ideally located in the heart of salt lake city
This a place for gamers.
The games were spectacular, one was very different - footpool - you got to play pool by foot - very innovative yet amazing.
Had a good time here - somehow expensive but could be spent.

Located just above Gupta brothers, saltlake city. Went there in evening time. It was fully empty. Ambience was good. Please NOTE, there is no shisha,  still they have written in their page in zomato, that smoking area is available. So kindly remove that tag, if you don't have in your cafe. Staffs were welcoming and helpful. Food was delicious, yummy. We can visit it with friends and family. We had ordered corn canopy, veg. Lasagne,  nachos classic, green apple Mojito🍸. Place was huge. 
Recommended. 
Cheers!

Smash is a nice place to hang out with buddies. The ambience is what attracts me the most about this place.Not only can you chill out with your friends, you also have myriadbindoor games to indulge yourself in. The food and the drinks are good. Overall a very nice place.

Perfect place to hang out with friends.... With loud music and wide varity of games being available along with good food .... We tried out the peprica pizza which non veg lovers won't like certainly...the beverages were also nice but the time they took to serve us with them was too high..  Over all the ambience was good.the staffs were friendly and helpfull... I liked the selfie booth..we played a game o pool and too round of laser tag . both of them were awesome but when we wanted to play laser tag in team mode the programing most probably failed badly as the jackets stoped working and we had to start an individual game all over again... Over all it was a nice experience... And a. Nice place to try out with friends

⊙ This is the perfect place for people who think Badshah and Honey Singh are the best things that have ever happened to music.
⊙ Food quality's average.
⊙ They have something called a Cola Float which will leave you confused as to whether it's cola served with  ice-cream or the other way around.
⊙ All of the games, one of the main highlights of this place, are chargeable.
⊙All this place achieved to accomplish was smash a perfectly good evening of our lives!

We went to this place after looking at the cool pictures, they only have veg food so please do plan accordingly so that ur not disappointed like I was. It's a fun place, more like a cafe. Loved the pizza and pasta that we had ordered. It did taste like Indian version of Italian food but good. You have so many games to play at your table, or play pool, or PS or the football pool. The entrance to the place is shabby and very slippery since it goes thru the kitchen of the GUPTA brothers and there is this smell that lingers and irritates u. From the perspective of drink no matter what you order it tastes quite similar to each other.

No issues. We wanted to try a new place altogether and this place was worth every single penny.
But the service was really great. Hatoffs !!
The ambience, food quality along with the quantity at a very reasonable price after the hectic office work made my day. 

Not to forget but special thanks for the complimentary hot chocolate brownie with ice cream. 

Would love to visit this place again.

Keep up the good work. All the Best :)

This is a new place where they have games like darts, PlayStation, fooseball, board games and pool. 

The décor inside is very innovative. Check out the ceiling once you are inside it. The entrance is a bit shabby. Smash Street is on top of Gupta Brothers. 

The food is vegetarian. The food was very tasty and it was not very expensive too. We had a variety of food like the soya mushroom and the paneer. The chili garlic noodles was also delicious. 

There was a selfie booth too for all the selfie freaks.. This place is definitely one of the most happening place in town. I am definitely going back again...

Regarding the games - played almost everything from Foosball to Laser Tag. With a Karaoke - Smash Street would be like the complete thing. Looking forward to visit again next month probably.

I went to smash street along with my two best friends. This is place is crazy! Ambience was good. We had Smash Street Sizzler along with 4 kinds of shakes and cold coffees, and i must say everything was damn tasty! "Brownie shake" is a must try!!We played almost every game from foosball to pool to laser tag! My personal favourite was foosball. I would recommend everybody to try that.
Selfie booth is great. Though i would recommend you to add more and different kind of props.
Also, please do add some new games and features( like TRAMPOLINE GAMES, table tennis, KARAOKE MACHINE, kick the can, jenga ). I would love to revisit this place and i will highly recommend everyone about this place.

Went to Smash Street to celebrate my birthday. This place has totally lived up to its expectations. It is a place where you can go both with your family as well as friends. It has a wide array of games, from board games such as taboo (my personal favorite) to pool, Foosball, air hockey and guess what, Laser Tag too among the others! It also has a dedicated selfie booth with endless props.
Coming to food, we ordered a potato rosti (their signature dish), a 4 toppings pizza, a So Cheesy Pizza, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Nutella Shake, Brownie Shake and Cold Coffee.
Potato Rosti : It was horrible. It was just mashed potatoes with salt and negligible amount of cheese. Couldn't believe they claimed it to be their signature dish. However, due to another huge birthday party going on along with sudden rush and limited staff, it was justified. Rating : 1/5
Pizza : While the 4 topping pizza definitely improved our moods which had been spoilt by the rosti, the So Cheeeesy Pizza was a huge turn on. It was simply delicious. To both the pizzas : 4/5
Noodles : The Chilli Garlic Noodles was probably one of the best noodles I've ever had. It was served in good portions and was totally spicy. A must try. 4/5
Shakes and Cold Coffee : The Cold Coffee was amazing. However, it was the nutella shake that blew our minds. It is highly recommended. So is the brownie shake. These 2 shakes were the main attraction. To the cold coffee : 4/5, brownie shake : 4.5/5 and nutella shake : 5/5
This place is a must visit with friends. Would like to thank the staff for being so cordial and helping me have an amazing birthday! Only improvements in rosti is recommended.

So.  This was unexpected. 

Right out of nowhere, this place hits you with the chillest vibes in the city.

Great food. Incredible service. And the ambience is phenomenal. I spent an evening playing chess and enjoying my meal of the best tomato basil soup I've had in years, a glass of wonderful oreo milkshake, a spicy metronation pizza and some classic nachos.

Highly recommended.

Decent place.. good ambience, good music.. And they have games... Which makes it a very fun place to visit when ur with friends and are looking for that extra bit of interactive fun. 
Quality of food is good. We ordered cottage cheese cigars, the smash street chef special pizza, classic mojito, fruit punch (which was a friendship day special) and hot chocolate. The food was pretty good.. However they took a long time to serve and didn't give any serving spoons with the dishes. Will come back again to explore the gaming options. 
PS... The decor is very fun and they gave props which are wonderfully selfie centric.

Poor quality of food and presentation. Seems like there has been a shift of chef. Earlier experiences were good however, recent experience has been a disaster.

Great hangout to have a nice entertainment with good yummy food with fun. Each n every item served was worth the order. Lazer tag is a great advantage and the selfie box is also interesting. Nice visit n good time spent. Staff is courteous too.

A great place to unwind and chill with your group or blow off steam over laser tag and other games. Laser tag, the main attraction of this place, is really fun and worth all the money. Also, the selfie booth is pretty fun.
The central location helps. The people are helpful and very hospitable. Though, it wish they didn't have an only-veg menu.
Overall a really fun place and I'll definitely pay more visits for the games.

A great place to unwind and chill with your group or blow off steam over laser tag and other games. Laser tag, the main attraction of this place, is really fun and worth all the money. Also, the selfie booth is pretty fun.
The central location helps. The people are helpful and very hospitable. Though, it wish they didn't have an only-veg menu.
Overall a really fun place and I'll definitely pay more visits for the games.

Full points on the decor for this one! The place is located on the second floor of a building and the outside is a little dirty. However, once you enter the actual restaurant you're sure to love the ambience. Coming to the food, it's strictly vegetarian so that might be a problem to a lot of people like me. Regardless, we ordered soup, some cigar with dip (it was just paneer fingers with a fancy name), so cheesy pizza and blueberry shake. Food was very average to be honest and quantities weren't so great either. The corn in the pizza pretty much ruined the pizza. The shake, however, was great and better than most I've tasted in the city. The ambience makes up for a lot which might be lacking in the food.

Location of the place is quiet odd.. i mean it is very difficult to find it out, for people who stays in south... it is a cool place to hangout with friends...interior is quiet cool... you will get many games there...though you have to pay for it...  and there is a selfie box... along with some free accessories... anyway the ambience was good... we ordered chilly garlic noodles...it was good... and the service was quiet fast which i liked the most...

I had walked into Smash Street in hope of some Mocktails  but they surprised me. With an array of games- video games, board games, pool, laser tag(yeah that is right, Laser Tag), a selfie counter, quirky interiors i was frankly impressed. 

This restaurant is located in Salt Lake sector 1, close to the swimming pool, just above Gupta Brothers. 
Sunny Pradhan, the Manager was unimpressive. The rest of the staff were forthcoming, but not well equipped with the menu. 

I had the Kiwi Cooler and Nutella Shake. The Kiwi Cooler was a brilliant looking green colored drink that became the cover pic of my facebook page. tI came in a salt rimmed glass, garnished with crushed ice & lemon slices. But the taste was synthetic and the quantity was too less, i was frankly unhappy. The Nutella shake was deliciously thick, creamy and tasted awesome. 

Wish the team a great future !

This smart and stylish café is themed around "Inception," equipped with a selfie booth, lazer tag, motion gaming etc. Had takeaway from here of Napolitano pizza and French fries. 
The pizza was of gigantic size, with 8 slices suitable for a family. I was amazed to find that considering its size and relatively big slices its price is quite cheap! The crusts are thin and soft, coated with cheesy mozzarella embedded with mushroom. The seasoning to be sprinkled on the pizzapie was okay but chili flakes were tad spicy. The french fries are the classic, salty, light and crispy fried potato fingers usually accompanied with burgers which tasted heavenly when dipped in tomato ketchup. They'd provided paper napkins and plastic forks with the food.
For pasta, burgers, pizzas, snacks, wraps, noodles, soups etc. this hip and happening vegetatian café "where rest is prohibited" is a great hangout place for today's youth and to chill out with buddies. 
My only complaint is that the pizza was delivered in a squeezed and crumpled paper box unlike a hard carboard one delivered by Pizza Hut or Domino's. The pizza wrapped in silver foil too had gone cold when delivered so had to warm up the slices in the oven. Also the guy taking the order had informed since it'd been a busy evening they would take an hour to deliver which they did.

I visited this place thinking it would be somewhat similar to Smaaash in Mumbai. Well it was almost similar except that it was empty. Another shocker was that I went on Saturday evening! We were the only group in this whole place. 

Anyways, the place is really interesting. 
They have a variety of games that you will love playing and they have a nice groovy music too.

Games that they have: 
• Pool 
• Leg pool
• 3 way air hockey
• Darts 
• Foosball 
• Xbox
• LASER TAG!!!
• Ludo, Taboo!

Games 5/5

Music: 5/5
The music is too good with all the latest songs being played.

Service: 3/5
The staff is lazy and unresponsive. Maybe they are too used to an empty place and thus don't respond. 

Ambience: 4/5
The place is really well made and nicely decorated. They have apt quotes put up on walls and their ceiling is pretty interesting too!

Food: 3/5
They have a veg menu which is a shocker! The options were quite less and the taste was not that great. 
We had ordered pasta, nachos, garlic bread, guava juice, and paneer poppers.

Value for money: Definitely yes!

Visited this place on a Saturday evening with a friend, but was surprised to find it empty. Another shocker was that the place serves Veg food. YES!!!!! Such a cool cafe, with games, laser tag, a pool table, photobooth and many board games to keep you entertained serves just Vegetarian food.  :(
Ordered one Cheese Grilled Sandwich with Cafe Irish. Both were average. If you are in a group, you might as well enjoy, playing pool, doing laser tag, posing in the photo booth etc. That's it though.

This seems to be a little over rated. The concept is good with all sorts of games like Pool, Foosball, private room for games as well to keep you occupied while you are here. Service is good as well but the quality of food and drinks really needs a lot of improvement. Even the quality of coffee was sad. The overall ambience will give you a feel of you being in a game parlour rather than a cafe or a restaurant. Visit this place only if you are interested in the games on offer and not for the food.

Smash Street - A unique concept seen in the city of joy.
=====
Location + Intro: 

It is located very near to the Salt Lake swimming pool. Walk a bit and you will surely locate it. 

Smash street was on my wishlist since a long time. I had been to smash street with a friend of mine. This place is nice. It has selfie booth, games such as air hockey, ps4, foosball and stuff like that. The place is very nicely done and the ambiance is nice. 

They only cater vegetarian food and does not deal in alcohol or sheesha. It's a good place for family and friend get together. 
=====
What i had:-

• Virgin Mojito - It was nice. But it lacked a kick. It was not refreshing as i thought it would be. A large scope of improvements lies therein.

• Smash Street Special Pizza - It was indeed special. It had a lot of veges inside it with cheese as well. I liked it. The presentation as well quality was nice. ✌✌

• Kitkat Shake - My friend ordered for it and said it was average. 
=====
Pros:

• Pure vegetarian place with no alcohol or hookah.

• A gaming hub.

• A selfie Booth.

• Large seating capacity.

• Made in such a way that both friend's and family can visit here.

• Courteous staffs.

• Amazing ambiance.

• Reasonably priced. 

Cons:

• Shake as well as soda drinks needs to be improvised.

• Service can be enhanced too.
=====
Meal for two: 450-900 approx.
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4.2/5

Food Quantity 4/5

Food Presentation 4/5

Taste 4/5

Hospitality 3.7/5

Value for Money 3.8/5

Ambience 4.1/5
=====
Conclusion:

I had a nice experience here. I might revisit it again. ❤ ❤

Today we had a different but delightful experience while we were hungry for an evening meal . We were in sector 1 , salt lake and had completed a movie . On browsing through the choices we came across " Smash Street " , a place where "rest is prohibited " . Certainly , a cafe cum gamezone where you get to play a lot of games like :-

1. Laser Tag.
2. Fusball.
3. 8 ball pool .

They also have live sports screening and wifi . But we were very hungry and went there to have a quick bite . 

--------------------------------------------------------------
LOCATION
--------------------------------------------------------------
This is located at the "swimming pool " stoppage of sector 1 , salt lake . This is under CF block . Once you reach there , you will see a huge Gupta brothers eatery and "Smash Street " will be on the top floor of that restaurant . If you are coming from city centre then you have to reserve an auto because normally they donot travel here by route .

--------------------------------------------------------------
FOOD
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Potato rosti ( 3.5 / 5 ) - From the appetizers section we ordered this dish which is supposed to be their signature dish . This is roasted potato strips in the midst of a cheesy layer or broth . Frankly, the dish tasted great as the potato strip was well cooked and the cheese was perfect on it . Just felt the potato layer could have been more fatter to make this dish a little more devouring . But , still it's a one time must try dish for every foodie and compulsory for the vegetarians.

2. Spaghetti agli olio ( 4 / 5 ) :- Simply loved it . This dish has its origins in Napoli, Italy . The main ingredients of this dish are : olive oil, minced girl tossed with spaghetti and chilli flakes added on top . I thought the flavor was spot on . And the chilli flakes added a bit of spicy goodness to it so that after every gulp you could feel a burn in your throat . This was my first time with this dish and i absolutely loved the way it turned out .

3. Strawberry shake ( 4 / 5 ) :- The perfect cooler for the spicy spaghetti. No complains here as the shake was spot on in both quality and quantity .

----------------------------------------------------------------
AMBIENCE
----------------------------------------------------------------
This is a place where you generally donot go as a couple ,unless you partner is good enough to experience anything and everything . A very spacious place with lots of seats and I didnot spot any two seaters since it expects groups coming in . On crowdy days and whenever there is a game it will certainly go loud so going in a group can be a good idea . There is a phone booth conceptualised as a selfie booth , which is a really cool thing . Something to take back as a memory .

The service was good as the staff was very helpful in explaining the items which helped us a lot in food selection . 

As a final verdict, this is a certainly worthy of a one-time visit if you are looking to taste their food.  For others , like if you are into gaming stuff then you can always hang out here whenever you are strolling nearby . A good experience for me .

Sole reason for going to this place was “Laser Tag”, after all how many places do you know of in Kolkata where you have Laser Tag. Besides, they have plenty of other games to keep you entertained, and if you are hungry, yay there’s food too. :P

Located near swimming pool, it has a quite spacious seating area. A nice place to hang out with friends. Quick service. Friendly staff. Can’t say much about the food. Go there if you want to have fun.

Smash Street a one of a kind place. From the décor, menu to the games really has a lot of different things to offer. 
This was my first visit but we got to try only finger foods because we had to rush hence no games 😢
Well the FOOD was really good. 
I completely fell in love with the corn canopy! Small breads baked with cheese corn olives. Really amazing. 
We also had pizza though not upto the mark. 
Strawberry shake was decent. 
But I surely loved the service. 
Will visit again soon.

I'm actually unexpectedly impressed by this place!
Well, people mostly know this place because of the various fun games like laser tag etc and the overall quirky and appealing ambiance. But being the judgmental food freak that I am, I'm actually impressed by the taste of food here. Yes I know, it's only vegetarian food. But that's ok with me if the taste can compensate. We only tried a pizza, a finger food and a strawberry shake this time, but I must say I was blown away by the corn canopies and their simplistic crunch plus melt in the mouth flavour! The burgers seemed pretty good and reasonably priced too. I think I'm definitely going to come back for more. And not just laser tag next time.

If you have fun and not just food, you must try this place as they have the pool table for football which is like...crazy, but take nothing away from the food, as theh excel in that as well, must try the lasagne....

Smash Street, as the name indicates, is a chill cafe to hand out with friends and enjoy a game or several while taking finger food breaks. 

Positives:
- the seating area is quite spacious
- there are a number of games to keep you entertained
- the service is decent 
- the camera friendly selfie booth with props is quite an attraction 

Negatives:
- not suitable for those who like to enjoy a quiet meal in a mesmerising ambiance
- the food is decent enough to suit the gaming center + cafe atmosphere, for example, our 'Death by Chocolate' was more creamy than chocolatey, but it was good nevertheless.

This place is more of a game parlour cum restaurant. One of its kind in Salt Lake it has huge attraction of young teenagers looking to have some fun. It is specially famous for its Laser Tag . We tried the Italian cuisine there comprising of Pizza ,Pasta and also many desserts. Overall this place is a fine place to spend a Friday eve or a Saturday afternoon !

This place can be tricky to locate, but given it has a huge Smash Street logo just above the Gupta Brothers outlet, it’s not gonna miss your sight.
The concept is to merge the indoor gaming and café experience together to form a combo unique to the city. In addition to board games, they boast of having foosball, snooker, air hockey, play station (that too in a personalised room of yours). There is even a game setup where you can play snooker with footballs and you yourselves are cue sticks. There is even a selfie booth where you click endlessly with props and wigs. Its spread over a huge area thus providing for a formidable seating space. Another eye catching highlight is their ceiling which is designed to mirror a street outlook. Other than that the décor is pretty much average with dim lightings.

As it was a sultry afternoon, we decided to start off with some coolers/beverages.
★    Sunrise : The best refreshments during summers are fruit juices and what can be better than some of them combined. This beverage is a mix of orange, pineapple and lime juice with a dash of grenadine. It was really energising.

★    Blue Lagoon Float : It was technically blue lagoon topped with vanilla ice cream. A normal combination, nothing too great about it.

For the food we had…
★    Crispy Chilli Babycorn : I can say that I have had better babycorn at other places. All the elements of spices were right. However they were a bit mushy, the only down point.

★    Lasagna : Its not listed on their menu, but they do serve it. It was the first time for me trying this pasta based dish, and boy I loved it. It comes loaded with different types of cheese, long pasta, mushrooms and bell peppers. Its an absolute delight for all vegetarians.

The service needs a boost as it tends to be slow at times. The prices are really low-key. All in all this place deserves 3.5 but an extra 0.5 for the innovation they have come up with. Will be back definitely to try out the gaming section.

Good concept with various of games to play. Your time will just fly once you step inside the cafe. 
Right from board games to foosball to 8 ball pool to laser tag, you can try out every game possible. 
You can go crazy in the selfie corner and pose differently with so many different categories of stuff.
The food is mainly finger food but tastes good . 
Always in a mood to come into this place !

After months of deliberation , we decided to visit this place. Ambience is exquisite , loved it. It is extremely spacious as well , staff were extremely polite and helpful. Normally I don't visit Veg joints but had to come here to experience the Laser Tag Game .
Laser Tag left me awestruck and certainly am gonna come back again to play this beautiful game. 
 Coming to the other aspects Selfie Booth was great and then there is Foosball , Air Hockey etc you name it. 
Finally in terms of food we went for Cheese Grilled Sandwich which was good. 
Overall an excellent experience.

If you want to get insulted go to this place.
The staff members are highly uneducated and have no sense of understanding of hospitality.
Just because we need to keep our kids happy .... We need to swallow the unruly behaviour.

Basically : come and pay money for kids happiness but the overall experience is not a healthy and friendly one.

I am in a state of shock ....

Just because today you have customers in excess you have the audacity to show disrespect to customers .....
It's too much of an overconfidence ....

Well if the readers can understand my annoyance it is good .... If someone cannot ... Please go and have a first hand experience ....

I just hope that this feedback gives them a good sense and other people suffer a little less !
Time is so precious .... As well as Money ...

We cannot afford to lose both ...

I have invested my time so that someone can gain from my experience and save time and money !!

This place is quite good if someone wants to just hang out with friends and play games.
But foodies, stay away from this place.
Looking at the ambience, you might feel like going back home without even bothering to check out the menu card.
But all narcissists out there, it has got a selfie booth.

This place is for people who can tolerate a not so peaceful ambience with food. I would definitely agree that it is a joint where we can enjoy games as well as food but it would be appreciated if sections are made different. Too noisy a place to even enjoy food. Too loud music. No special food. I ordered bbq burger which was horrible . Coffee tasted okay but was served cold. Pizza was horrible. Just a thin crust of bread with cheese and no toppings. Pasta, French fries, chocolate milk shake and lassania were fine. Really liked their pasta in white sauce. Even the games are over priced. Pocket pinch for food is on the lower side. Wouldn't like to visit again.

After going through scores of fun places,  we boiled down to smash street.  This is one places that will surprise you.  I spent around 5 hours just sitting here playing games and enjoying food.  It offers a fairly limited but unique set of delicacies at a very reasonable. Price.  Besides there are a plethora of board games,  Lazer tag,  pool and simulator.  Has a photo booth and various props for selfies and fairly big projector screen for those sports fanatics.  A perfect place to spend time with your friends.  The best part is,  there is something for everyone..in the menu and at the place. Amazing!

On a quiet weekday afternoon, we arrived at Smash Street. Zomato led us there and boy, am I glad it did. It is quite a big place with board games galore. You could easily spend a couple of hours here. They have plenty of snack options to keep you going. While we waited for the food, we got started with one of my favorites, Taboo :D The classic nachos were satisfying. Dollops of creme fraiche and loads of toppings. The rosti, which is a recent love of mine, came with a sauce (cashew? mushroom?). I loved this version; we needed more but restrained ourselves. The kit kat shake was average.

Sadly, they weren't serving wraps that day. The macaroni wrap was so tempting in my imagination! We settled for the al funghi pizza and mac n cheese. The pizza was just a regular thin crust pizza, nothing about it stood out. But by dint of being pizza, was satisfying :) The mac n cheese was better; probably a good thing that it wasn't sinful levels of cheesy. Nevertheless, we were stuffed by the end of the meal.

Time flew. Great Zomato discovery. One of its kind in this part of town.

Was looking for a place to hang out in the late evening of the new year day... All places being crowded n que'd we decided to check in at Smash Street near our home.. What we found was a nice, cosy n well decorated place.. The interiors Wr nice.. staff behvr was good.. N best point is that this is a place where u can spend time playing games as well.. Bowling.. Billiards... And u don't hv to sit idle till the food is being served.. The place was surprisingly empty (that too in a day whr u hv to wait for hours b4 u cn place ur order).. probably less people want to taste veg food on the new year day.. But inspite of veg menu they hv got good variety.. Italian..Chinese.. Continental.. And the quality of food ws also great.. So a 4.5 from me..

Smash street is perhaps one of the best places for a group of 7-8 people to go,  in case they are in the salt lake area. Sitting atop a Gupta brothers outlet,  and surrounded by a Sharma tea and a ghanghor outlet,  I bet some foodies (read vegetarians) will get wayward en route to smash street and end up feasting on the regulars. If u can resist  all the temptation   though,  and make it to the 2nd floor,  u r indeed up for some delight. 

Smash street is wonderfully maintained,  one if the better themed cafes I have seen in town. With pizza Hut style centre tables alternating with ice hockey tables and snooker boards,  the place is a visual delight. U can go laser tagging up one floor, and they have good combos available for the same. The place abounds in board games,  and there are enough ways to entertain urself. The ambience is lively enough to fill your fone with a fresh lease of insta selfies. 

The food is almost cheap given the ambience and everything,  and one would have expected it to be heavier on the pocket. It's a pleasant surprise,  with sandwiches costing in the double digit only. The sandwiches were a delight. We didn't really get to hog as much as we wanted,  but I would definitely go back for more! 

It would have been wonderful if they had a separate smoking zone with Hookahs,  coz with all the other amenities available,  u would expect it to not stay behind on this account. The service is impeccable. Brilliant ambience. All in all,  if u can spend 300-400 at one go,  one should try this joint out once!

A great place to visit if you have a group and you all want to involve yourselves in some fun activities. The interior is really cool with loads of places to take groupfies or selfies. The only things that are not so cool are the eatables and i hope that the food quality will improve. One special mention please try to include non vegetarian items in the food category, which i am sure will take SMASH STREET to another level. Nevertheless i visited this place twice in my one week holiday and i really had a great time. THANKS SMASH STREET for adding all the fun elements in my holiday week. SMASH STREET see ya soon!!

Interiors was decent and the place was spacious too.. Games were overcharged ...Apart from games..there's even a selfie latte with interesting props... Coming to food
Ordered Chef's special garlic bread which comes with mayonnaise dip.. It was well prepared...
Even ordered Pizza which was crisp and had enough toppings on each slice...
Mixed sauce pasta even tasted yum
And d best was Mexican rice with jacket potatoes.. Perhaps I'm a potato freak...that's why... It had perfect blend of spices and the gravy on top of potatoes was absolute relish to taste buds...

An average place. Much hyped according to the photos but summing up it is among the teenage-hanging-out Cafe. The place throngs with a lot of activities like fussball,giant screen For gaming, pool table but all comes at a dear price. The laser tag option is also available at the venue but I think a lot of improvement is required( refer to lets lazer tag / the next level which are providing a more enthusiastic lazer tag experience). Coming to the food, its common as compared to other cafes like the pastas, risottos, burgers, sandwiches and the common beverages. A suggestion to all cafes- Try to include a signature dish which draws the crowd and is best served at the place only (e.g "The chocolate avalanche" at Bon Appetit). Overall this place has tried to provide something different i.e. Activities which should be managed properly and evolve as per the time passes.

Had visited this place last Sunday for my bday celebration & had a forgettable experience.Firstly coming to games,had enquired from them abt chargeability&was informed only laser tag is chargeable rest are all free. On accessing them one of the board was defective whereas games other than board games were chargeable.Now seriously which wicked person in this world wud visit a restro to play CHESS or STOCK Exchange. In this day & age, when restros with stereotype menus are trying to woo the diners with added advantage this is the place with no extra benefit. We ordered chinese food and frankly speaking food was average & I have had better chinese food than this at 10-15 places. On requesting for non-onion& garlic food for my parents, I was bluntly denied on my face ...AGAIN THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE in the hospitality industry. In the end just felt like leaving the place asap.

Selfies & others are ok and u can visit this place if you want to spend Rs 4,000-5,000 just for playing CHESS.

Location: Salt Lake Sector 1. Opposite some Maidan. Beside Gupta Brothers. 

Ambience: Mecca for Indoor Gaming lovers. They've got Foosball,Pool,Laser Tag, Foot Snooker.. Pheww! They also have a selfie booth and Screen Live Matches!


Food: Ordered fried Rice and Vegetables in Hot Sauce. Food is really good. Though they have limited items in their menu but they serve good food. A plate of anything Serves 2 people optimally. Rice was just rightly cooked with a pinch of salt and tossed with vegetables. Hot Garlic Sauce had the accurate amount of spices and consistency. 


I'd love to visit you again and play like a kid again! Kudos to you guys for thinking differently and coming up with something other than a Hookah Parlour! ☺

Visited this place today evening and I swear it was worth the visit. This place is absolutely perfect for catching up with friends in a gang. :D The ambience is totally different and justifies the feature "themed restaurant." Whether you are a gamer or not you will surely lovely this place. This place didn't bore us at all. If you are a gamer you will be confused with too many options. :P Even if you are not a gamer you will surely be pleased with their food and their selfie booth! The selfie booth is a total new concept and attracts a lot of people. They have funny placards and props which adds more excitement to the selfie-lovers. :) Coming to food, we started with their coffee latte which was nice as compared to their price and lot better than CCD coffees! Potato wedges (deep fry served with cream cheese sauce) was okayish. I loved their crispy chili babycorn. It was served hot. Last but not the least sizzling brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate was the order of the day! I have had the best brownie here. :) The waiters were decent enough.

The place has a good ambience. Specially the gaming sections are the best in the city. But the only thing I didn't liked was the quantity and quality of food. 
We ordered a fried rice, hakka noodles and manchirian for main course the taste was not upto the mark and yhe quantity of manchurian was very poor in a plate of manchurian there were just 5 balls. It was very disappointing. Apart from fooding it can be a good game parlour. 
The interior was also very good. We also ordered chocolate shake and cold coffee with ice cream the cold coffee was good but the shake was just ok.

A good concept.. 
It has games and food both. Makes for a perfect hangout with friends. An ideal for teens I must say. U go there on a wkend and it is full of school kids.
They have laser tag, billiards, darts, foosball and a few other games. It is a concept which Kolkata has not seen before. So kudus for that.
And yes, there are plethora of board games like taboo, scrabble, plot-4 etc fr the lazy ones 😉
They have a selfie zone too with a lot f funny placards and props which is perfect fr all d selfie lovers out there.
The entire restaurant has a fun appeal to it. For instance, the tables are cassette shaped. 
The food and beverages were good too. I enjoyed the arrabiatta and the risotto! But must f the things that we wanted were not available. The mgnt must take care of this.

The service was good too. The waiters were very frndly. 

The price is decent. Around 300-400 per person including mocktails.

Overall, a great place to hangout especially in the Salt lake side of the city which has a dearth of places.

This place is great to be with friends given the selfie booth, those placards and props and variety of activities and games. We were a group of 9/10 people and had decided to take a combo deal which had laser tag+starter+soft drink. The food quantity was reduced. No focus on presentation. The cold drink was just not cold. We later ordered Nachos (which was not in the combo option), and it was presented well with good quantity. Such double standards in deals is not acceptable. But overall, its fun out here. :)

Apart from the ones already mentioned in other reviews, they also have good number of board games and card games which come complementary with the food. And now coming to the food, Lasagne, Pasta, Babycorn were quite good. Smash Street Special Sizzler and the mango shake was kind of average for its price I guess. Overall, I rate this place highly as I had lot of fun and would like to visit soon after college with friends.

Last day in Kolkata today. I wanted to try my Favorite Italian food and was searching for a restaurant around my place. That's when I saw  Smash Street in Zomato. I kinda liked the menu and went straight to that place. We were bit late and it was around 9 when we reached there. It's a game place with restaurant. You have snooker table, video games and much more inside. Amazing interior with all fun elements to jazz up your mood. 
We ordered a Corn Canopy, Mixed Tomato Pasta and a Mushroom and Spinach Cannelloni. We also ordered a blueberry ice tea and a mix fruit drink. The food was simply awesome.. Especially the Cannelloni.. Chanceless.. I loved this place and I seriously gonna miss this. I am so sad that I found it on my last day in Kolkata. Those who have a love for Italian food please visit here. I recommend this place for fun and food. It's very much affordable by price too..

I visited this place with my cousins and it was so much so much fun. Since it was a week day I felt the service was really swift and food was lip smacking! Since we were the only people that day it felt like a private party! The Italian sizzler is a must try! Also the concept of board games was fresh and new and really enjoyable! Only complaint was that to play other games the price was a bit high! Nonetheless the game of foosball made it worth the cost! I would say it's a must visit! Given the reasonable price, good quality food and swift service! Special mention for the selfie booth and props, it made the experience a little more memorable!

Good gaming place but the food is very bad. It's over priced. Quantity is very less.. music is loud. But light effects n interiors are awesome. Good cafe to click picture n lasertag but not to have food..

I wasn't aware of this place yet I've been visiting Swimming pool area for years now. It stunned me with such a gorgeous décor and brilliant theme. One can get entertained by plating games, taking selfies in the selfie booth, watch live games and many more.

The place has a distinct charm about it and one can visit with family, friends or someone special without a thought. The menu is rich with verities of options to choose from and nothing would disappoint you for sure. The quality, thee service and the charges, all make this joint a class apart. I've seen very few vegetarian joins with this level of perfection.

I'm glad for such a nice joint to hangout in this area. Swimming pool site anyways is one of the most famous places to hang out and have fun and Smash Street just made the locality perfect.

Finally went here today after several plan cancellation. But with the build in excitement the people seemed to lag a bit.... The food seriously average .... The games are good but seeing the time restrictions the price is on the higher side. 

Recommended only of you have a big group and wanna play games.

Visited this place for my cousin's birthday and we all had a great time. The place is done up beautifully and the delicious food adds to the great experience. The best part about it is the laser tag area and the various board games. I played foosball and laser tag and in the board games, guess who. Coming to the food, we had ordered crispy chilli babycorn, nachos, sizzler, pan fried mushroom, pasta, Hakka noodles, margarita pizza, garlic bread, gourmet pizza and fried rice. Everything tasted really good. In the drinks we had a mojito which I did not like. There was too much mint in it. Prices were reasonable. Would definitely visit this place again.

This place is exactly in saltlake swimming pool nd share the building with gupta brothers..
As u enter u see all gaming environment all around..pool table to air hockey everything. .one side u hve the the sitting area.
Its an innovative place in kolkata as u also have a swlfie booth with different sign nd quotation boards nd funny props to add to ur selfies..we had an awesome time clicking pictures.
There are lot of free board games to play with friends like stock exchange, soctland yard and even card games like tabo and uno..if u hve a group of friends u vl hve a fin time very relaxing nd dese r free..
We ordered hakka noodles and for sides v had vegetables wth hot garlic sause which was very yummmyyyy .italian sizzler was a total disappointment as the pasta was nt well marinated and very dry..
Kikat shake was satisfactory.
The service was quiet good and tge waiters are very cooperative..
Overall I loved the new concept of games thing was something kolkata needed..
A must visit place with a good gang to have fun..so must visit fr everyone

For long there was a need for friends to hangout at a place where waiting for food wouldn't be a problem. Where running out of topics to discuss about wasn't frustrating and where the excitement are always high.
Smash street delivers like it's name. It smashes it's customers with various games and a wide range of casual snack and meals. The decor is very fancy that has managed to attract the GenX.
Starting from board games, pool, foosball, Need for Speed (Most Wanted) on a giant screen, FIFA and a selfie booth for the 'nautanki wale', it's the full package. The food served is decent.
Due to the upkeep and the huge fixed cost because of the decor I had presumed that everything would be priced a little high. The games last mostly for 20-30 mins and they charge around the high 100s. I played a game of foosball along with two of my friends and was charged 150 greens for just 20 minutes. The food prices are decent.
Other than that, the fancy get up, the lovely games and the whole vibe is exciting and entertaining. It will be a huge success if they can keep it up and incur lesser costs in future. I hope they stay cuz only God knows how badly the youths of Kolkata need joints like this.

Money spent here is TOTALLY worth it! After rounds of laser tag,foosball,footpool,pool and an NFS (Need For Speed)car race, the menu here is an absolute delight! The special sizzler was lipsmacking! The pizzas were delicious (special mention:calzone pizza) and the blueberry icetea was packed with a punch! The only letdown was basic lemon icetea which one should avoid here. The staff is friendly and are keen for customer feedback which is a thumbs up! However, the bill included two items which we didnt order! So future foodies: keep an eye out!

It is situated above gupta brothers on the 3rd and 4th floor. The 2 floor space, offers a variety of options to have fun and chill around. Among the games, footpool is something different to play. Talking about the food, it has a scope for betterment. There could have been a staircase inside the restaurant, that connected both the floors, for convenience. All in all, one can spend a lot of time enjoying here.

Let me start by reviewing the food:
Pasta Salad - it was a weird Indian-ised version of Pasta Salad and it was BAD
Smash Street Special Sizzler - the quantity of one sizzler was not sufficient for two people + way too spicy 
Cappuccino - Way too bitter inspite of adding two pouches of sugar. 
Oreo Shake - Haha! The less said the better. The chef of Smash Street needs to learn how to make an Oreo Shake from the chef of Paris Cafe. 

Okay, now let's talk about the ambience:
1) Pathetic choice of music
2) Very noisy. Felt less like a cafe and more like a playhouse for school kids. 
3) There should be a time limit for using the Selfie Booth. We were there for around 40 minutes and the entire time, this one group of girls kept on clicking pics in the Selfie Booth. I am not kidding. They clicked pictures for 40 minutes straight. 
4) The service is slow. 
The only plus points about this place:
1) Nice seating
2) Funny quirky posters 

On the whole, I wouldn't recommend this place to anybody.

Amazing place
Good for living back the child hood days 
I along with my friends visited this place today 
All the staff are co-operative 
But all of them are not aware of the ongoing offers.
We called and enquires about the offer, we were said that the offer is valid on Sunday but we were denied at the counter

We played laser tag and foot pool 
Both were good 
A bit over priced 

All over a new NYC place for youngsters to chill.

Well after a long time i am back to writing reviews -- Hello to all those wonderful people who have liked my posts and pictures and the foodies of the millennium ; As for those who have no idea who i am , Its okay to be less informed about great people ;) 

So here it goes , my friend and i planned a short visit to some place near our house thats comparatively new and less visited ... So we went to Smash Street. First recommendation being the poor entrance -- you need to do justice to the name- you HAVE to build a better entrance . VIA GUPTA BROTHERS' back area is no way to a nice hang out . 

We ordered for the POTATO Rosti - this thin crisp bakes potato bed smothered with cheese thats slightly spiced up -- SIMPLY AWESOME -- but you need to give a bigger portion - thats not even a snack for one normal human being . And the awesomeness left us hungry for more ! Next we ordered for the Italian Sizzler - which again was really good - perfectly spiced and seasoned and al dente pasta . Not many places know what this means but bang on Smash ! The portion is perfect - for 2 hungry people ! Lastly we ordered for the cheese cake slice and OH MY GOD ! Its HUGE ! And i actually mean it when say something like that - its meant for at least 3 to 4 people- i remember my friend's expression when she saw this huge piece ! But then it tastes good - i have a weak point in my heart for cheesecakes so i loved it - probably why the size never mattered ;) but you seriously need to reduce the size of the slice -- you are giving away way too much sweetness :) 

So these 3 dishes might not define or determine the kind of place this is but hey ,thats why say - " come back for more " .
Keep loving , 

Anamika

Firstly the negative point is that the entry is through a side lane and on the 2nd floor.. quite a fleet of stairs to climb. But once u go in it has a cool retro look. There are board games but all of it at one corner not very enticing and welcoming.  The staff is very soft spoken and well behaved.. coming to food we ordered ceaser salad clubsandwich devil's drink and cheese cake.. best was devil's drink very spicy and cool.. tried ordering jalapeño poppers but it was not available.. club sandwich was not tasty enuf so don't waste money on it.. The menu is hattkey but a bit expensive for my pocket..

The place is good..you enter and expect to have a nice time there only until you see the prices for the games, which can blow away your mind because they are way too pricey..and if you decide to do your pocket a favour by not playing then there is nothing special left about it..Food is average. Went with high expectations, came back disappointed.

Everytime you go to a new place, you kind of expect it to be different from the usual places you go to. Smash street was definitely not like one of the places you have seen, it was completely exceptional. From the interiors to the tempting menu chart, everything was rich and amazingly done. The games, photo booth and the projector setups just wont let you leave early. The entire setup was a delight to watch. Everything from the roof details to the flooring seemed to define the contempo very gaily. This is probably the best place i've visited since a long time and i'd love to come here again and again. Food is too good, you cant help but order more. I loved the ambience it gave me. The hangings on the wall just adds on to the lively mood. This is one place where not just the youngsters but everyone would love coming to. And not to forget, the staff is very well behaved. Also, Raunaq was very kind to give us discounts :p
P.S SMASH STREET's LETS LASER TAG IS LIKE THE PERFECT THING  EVER.

Smash Street is basically a place to chill with anyone you be it friends,cousins or even grand parents.. This is the only place which satisfies the need of people from every age group.. ?
Amazing ambience soothing lights some bright colours on the wall and catchy quotes.. ??
Food is delicious and is presented quite well..???
Coming to the games Laser tag is super fun with some new ideas which can only be revealed if you visit there..
Pool table is well managed and is quite feasible..?
A new concept of foot pool which serves as manor attraction.. ⚽?
Eyefinity room will bring out the kid in you and even older people will get excited to play the game for once..?
Other games like foosball and air hockey are also available..
Coming to the most entertaining part The SELFIE booth with very attractive and innovative props girls are surely going to have a gala time..?
They even have screening for Matches which is a plus point too and you can join them to support your teams..
Awesome place to hangout a must must visit place at least once in a while..??
My experience was amazing looking forward to keep visiting it again and again ??

Situated near salt lake swimming pool,above gupta brothers.
Wao ! The first word I can coin for this place.Large and spacious..yet soothing ambience with perfect mood lightings.
Interios is done with a new concept with street design on the ceiling.
The place is divided into two floors..where 1st floor have ps3,pool table,fooseball,a gaming room with projector( under work) ,and lots of board games.Dine- in area is even in the same floor.
Selfie booth is designed in a corner with varieties of props.Quirky quotes on the walls is an add on.
2nd floor is just gaming area & have laser tag,air hockey.

Coming to the food: had ordered creamy sauce pasta,nachos,smash street special sizzler,kit-kat shake.
Every food tasted was upto the mark.
Service was quick and was serverd with great hospitality in no time.
Last but not the least...a wonderful place to visit.
Recommended: A must visit..both with friends and family!!

I visited smash street 2 weeks ago with my friends. It was a birthday surprise for my friend who thoroughly enjoyed the place and the food. 
LOCATION: Smash street is located in the popular CF block (close to subway,fillers) 
AMBIANCE: The place is divided over 2 levels with different gaming and sports activities like laser tag, foosball, board games, Footpool etc

I really like their ceiling which gives you an upside down feel ( there are windows, lamp posts and road tracks resembling a road)

Another attraction is the selfie booth with a number of props for the selfie-holics

FOOD: We ordered for nachos with cheese and salsa which was decent. (The cheese sauce had mayo :/ )
Later we ordered for chilli garlic noodles along with paneer manchurian and it was tasty. 
An italian sizzler was also ordered, I particularly liked their arrabiatta spaghetti in the sizzler. But the sizzler in itself wasnt sufficient portionwise
We also ordered for a cannelloni which was tasty.

The food was good and the games got us hooked for 3 hours! 

A good activity zone coupled with nice food, smash street is a total adda zone!

Pathetic experience ... Played what they say "Eyefinity" ... Told us the game would be for 8-12 mins ... So we sat down ... But the controls went absurd ... We were nt pressing NOs but still it was switching on and the game was over in 2:14 mins only ... The same happened in the second game ... Later on the third game i noticed that the guy beside with the keyboard who was setting the game was playing instead of us ... Being hardcore gamers it was the most disgusting experience i have ever had in my life and would never suggest anyone to go here ...

Smash street is basically a fun place with some very decent food.First thing you notice are the framed quirky quotes on the walls of the cafe and the very young feel to the place.Its a big place comprising two floors.One floor is made for  laser tag and other floor has a cafe.It also has pool tables,fooseball,ps3,selfie booth wid props and one big projector screen with a gaming station.Also it has a large screen in the cafe area which will be good for watching matches.
Coming to the food, we ordered crispy chilli babycorn ,mixed sauce pasta and sunrise mocktail.
The babycorn was really crispy but it was on the sweet side so I dint like it that much.
The pasta was good,it had a very thick creamy sauce and had the right combination of red and white sauces.
The sunrise had three layers of flavours.One layer had blue curacao,the second layer had orange flavour and the third one was probably pomegranate.It was pretty refreshing.

The staff is very courteous and the quantity is good.Thank God they dont keep hukkah !
Being a non-hukkah person i was tired of going to hukkah places for hanging out.
Also hope they show EPL matches here !
Wil surely visit again.

Ok so this is gonna be a mixed review. 
First up. The place was awesome. It's amazing for both friends and family. Nice hangout. You have board games, football with a twist, video game, snooker and laser tag. Absolutely great combo . So 5* for this.

Next comes fooding and dining. Just the opposite of what was abovementioned. No taste at all . Be it drinks, be it food. The service took ages. So 1* for this. 

Hence , 3* on an average.

Alas a place spread over two floors to chill and play some games. They have regular pool and poolball which is a combo of football and pool. Apart from that they have a laser tag arena along with air hockey, Foosball and board games. There is also a selfie booth with different props. The interiors are also amazingly designed. In short, a perfect place for anyone looking to hang out at a non-hukka place. Finally!
The mix sauce risotto was very nicely done, noodles were also good but the pasta sizzler could be improved. No negative points.
Laser tag is 220 per person and poolball is 150 per person.

The smash street is divided into 2 floors the first one for ambience and other indoor sports and the top floor(3rd floor) for laser tag , well to start up with i would first like to talk abt the interiors of the 2nd floor .. it has a look of a street as soon as u enter the room u will amazed to see how elegantly they hav designed there walls and ceiling giving the impression of a side street of european countries, which will completely take you by surprise, there is a pool table on the right side frm the enterance followed by a  stimulating gaming room,     (although i havent played it but looking at the projector size it will definately thrill the gaming freaks ) then there is a seprate corner for a very unique game called football billiard , came to knw its the first of its kind in the country . Now the main part the ambience looking at the menu it is clear that it has a continental menu but i was surprised to see the cost which was really low looking at the overall interior of the place it hardly pinch an individuals pocket me and my friends ordered a mexican tex mex on barbq sauce , mexican red sauce pasta a raunch bbq burger some soft drinks and we also played 3 games of pool and all adds upto the cost of 1200 something which was really amazing . The quantity is really good and the taste was amazing its worth every penny .. as compare to the veg menu of bikers cafe the taste was much better .. in my opinion its a perfect place for friends , family and couples .. thumbs up ????

A very nice place to host a birthday party or to hangout with friends. A lot of space to breathe free, lot of games to play, a dedicated selfie booth with innumerable props make it a very different experience altogether. Warm and quick service coupled with good food makes the visit worth a mention. For all those who don't like hookah, it's a hookah- free place:)

A great concept n perfect for all age groups. After a long time something in salt lake area that caters to needs of both children n adult. A much needed break from the typical hookah bar joints. Food is also relishing just that quantity needs to be improved.
