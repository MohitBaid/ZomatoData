Located on the main road itself. Serves good food. They offer both Chinese and Indian. Tried out their  biryani and the quantity is good enough according to price. The ambience is quite calm and cozy. Good for both family dining or with group of friends.

If you are in Gariahat, you MUST try Bedouin. One of the finest chowmein and chicken I have had in a long long time. Mouthwatering taste. Fair pricing.

It will get 5 out of 5 when it comes to quantity of food...If you are in Bedouin please try crispy baby corn....It able to create such impression that you visit many more times just for this....and according to my view it's not the place for biriyani or any mughlai dishes...so better go for Chinese and Bengali...

After a tiresome outing whole day I was feeling very hungry so while checking through zomato found this place to be most suitable to fill my biruyani hunger...üòÖüòÄ

Located just few steps away from gariahat more... and it can be easily located from the main road.. but he entrance is a bit tricky.. 

It's a double storeyed restaurant.. We decided to hop onto the 2nd floor... being 7pm and weekday it was as expected vacant.. The service person's were watching TV...

Now coming to the food we ordered chicken and mutton biriyani  (half) which is not shown in the zomato menu... and chicken tikka masala half..

The biriyani was enough in quantity.. We were amazed by the quantity just at 110 bucks.. They provided an aloo.. an egg.. and a mutton piece.. and sufficient quantity of rice.. so beware before ordering food.. based on your appetite..

The biriyani was simply üòçüëçüëå the spices were perfectly blended..The aroma of the biryani was amazing... and it was light on stomach too..

The chicken tikka masala was too much spicy but the gravy was really awesome... 4 pieces of boneless chicken pieces in a super spicy gravy..A perfect accompaniment with the biriyaniüòÄ

The service was also good.. The food was served within 10mins... and they provided water time to time..

Overall if u r hungry and looking for some superb pocket friendly mughlai cuisine.. This is the place..üòÄ

The food here is delicious and portions served are abundant. They offer a wide variety of cuisines which is always a crowd pleaser. This pocket pinch isn't much either. Therefore Bedouin is a popular choice for casual lunch or dinner plans or post gariahat-shopping munchies. That being said, they can definitely improve on their service and ambiance.
I'd recommend you try their Tangri Kabab. It melts in your mouth and is so delicious.

One of my favourite places in school/college life. The reason being the food is quite decent, tasty, a simple decor and the POCKET PINCH! It is an extremely pocket friendly place. Although the name has a Punjabi ring to it, I love their Chinese recipes more. The Chinese dishes are very simple and tasty.  I won't go into Decor, food and service related ratings. 

My suggestion is if you are shopping near Gariahat area and want a good meal at a budget rate, this is the place to go!

We have ordered biryani and chicken tikka butter masala. Amazing it was. No doubt food is too much good. But now a days all foodies want a wow type interior .. They should do some change on heir interior. Otherwise its fine..

Visted this place on 24.09.2017(‡¶ö‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶•‡ßÄ) . When the scorching heat of sun was literally sucking our energy and the pandal hopping was making us too weak to walk without food, this place came to our sight for saving us üòù. The restaurant was cozy, air conditioned. We ordered the all time famous
1. Chicken Fried Rice (170/-)(2)
2. Chilli Chicken (8 pieces 200/-)(1)
3.Mixed Chowmin (200/-)(1)
4. Chicken Manchurian (8 pieces 200/-)(1)
5. Mineral water (2)
We were a group of 6 people and the total cost for above mentioned dishes were 1416/-
The quantity was really good and the quality as well. A good place for satisfying hunger! :)

Went there for saptami dinner. Although there was a huge rush, we got a table for 6 people after waiting for only 15 minutes. There is 2 floors to accomodate people- a spacious restaurant. At first we were very delighted to get everything available we ordered in that busy festive night. But when the starter came, it was a horrible experience. The Chicken reshmi kebab was so much hard. There was also no chutney available with that. Coming to indian breads there was no difference between butter nun and tandoori roti. Both were hard also. We had chicken bharta and Bedouin special mutton curry as side dishes. Both the items were bland. Specially in bharta there was no spice i felt.

Have come here before...but this time was awful...Don't come here during rushes/ festivals etc...they are extremely unprofessional and inefficient in handling rush! If u don't have any option and happened to be there during durga pujo time order only Biryani...it's  a no brainer and they'll never make u disappointed...otherwise, here's my experience today:

Ordered - 

tandoori chicken - got some ugly looking burnt chicken - which seems like has been re-heated 1/2 times...had to return it

Reshmi chicken - stiff but edible!

Chicken Biryani -satisfactory 

Chicken side dish - some puja special curry - was good

Chicken chowmein - didn't reach to my plate - waited for 30-40 mins..had to cancel the order

In festive season you have to face a long queue but they are really best in organising for you.
Well serving. The food was tasty but not to much hot as usual, it may good to you or bad, depeands on your choice.
Very good atmosphere and one of the good point is the regular air conditioner instead of centeral AC. Wash-room is too small.

Horrible!

You order your stuffs and expect it to be delivered to your table after 45-60 mins.Serving time is too much. Poor service!

The tables for two, in the balcony side won't be available during rainy season because rainwater fo comes to visit that area. Bad Maintenance!

While ordering, the waiteress was pushing me to order something from the drinks. I mean I know right what I need, you don't have to push! Poor skills of the waiter n waitress! Not efficient enough.

Food : Biriyani was good in taste and enough for 2 people. But..but..but I ordered chicken lollipop..OMG ..What did they serve? Some bones with teeny tiny portion of muscles n ligaments of a chicken coated in a pathetic batter of besan, cornflour, green chilli paste and coriander. They should name it "Batter Bones" instead of "Chicken Lollipop". Not expected this kind of a dish from such a reputed and old restaurant. Highly Disappointed!

This is a well known restaurant in the Gariahat area and we are visiting this place since our childhood days..Seating arrangement is distributed in the 1st and 2nd floor, so this is very spacious. We had their one of the best chinese starters-crispy chicken- 8pieces of chicken pieces fried and tossed in a garlic chilly sauce making it tangy and spicy. We also frequently taste their crispy baby corn-very juicy and mouth watering delicious. In mughlai dishes we had Mutton biryani-not so much popular but okayish type. Their famous dishes are chicken chaap,chicken tikka masala, chicken lababdar, mutton bhuna etc. We frequently order these dishes. These goes best with indian breads-rumali and nun. They also have some thali and enough for a single person and there are varieties of these thalis.

Stale roti which tasted as raw as leather. Stale and cold food , just taken out from the fridge and served. Mutton Shammi tikia was so greasy and oily...strange they named it Shammi tikia without even knowing what Shammi tikia is...its basically an insult to the true and authentic Shammi tikia ..Coming to the fish tikka , I still doubt whether it was fish or some  adulterated products... Wen we asked them to change the roti , they gave lame excuses like it got cold while bringing !!  Unprofessional staffs, not trained to handle customers . One of my frnds had food poisoning after that .. this explains why there was hardly any customer... Friends until n unless u want to pay for getting sick don't even think of visiting this place . Don't compromise on ur health and hygiene for a cheaper alternative.

Last afternoon we went to Bedouin Gariahat. Its easy to locate . We ordered Bedouin special in starters (veg) which was pretty good . Well cooked veggies - tomatoes , onion, capsicum, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli. Also we had ordered fried rice and veg manchurian . The rice was good, smelled and tasted lovely the manchurian somehow was a turn down   .
For desert we had rocky road - vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce.

Bedouin was the first restaurant I went to when I Shifted from Nagpur to Kolkata back in 2013. Keeping apart all comparisons with its nearby competitions, this is a place where you'll get a small glympse of what a Bengali food restaurant and its bangaliana style service and food means.

Well since my first visit there, I had a constant order for every meal I visited for:
Lunch used to include Fish cutlet/paneer pakoda, Peas pulao/jeera rice, Chicken/paneer tikka butter masala(well I love a bit of spiciness in every part of my life) and Masala Coldrinks/lassi to end the cosy feeling.
For dinner main course would include Tandoori rooti/nun in place of the rice items.

Coming to the quality if service, the people in the restaurant just are lovely to interact. I literally talk to all people in the restaurant they also seem to like my small chatterings(Mind you, I can talk a lot when in moodüòú). As for the preparation, each item is made to the point to taste as it should owing to its name. One would admire that delicious smell when they bring the items to serve you. A must visit if you are in for a quick but delicious lunch

Bedouin is one of the popular Bengali and Mughlai cuisine restaurant located near the Gariahut crossing. If you coming from Kalighat metro, it will on your right side few steps before the Crossing. So lets come and discover this place.

Positive Point -

1. Sitting arrangements - They had huge sitting arrangements. So you don't have to wait if you will be there in the busy hours.

2. Thali System - The offers various kinda thali option with a low price tag. The items in a single thali are enough for one person.

3. Pricing - With decent pricing of every item, you can choose as much dish as you want within your budget.

Negative Point -

1. Service & management - The stuffs are less caring about their customer's satisfaction point and the serving time is too much. If have to wait a long time to get your food served.

Now lets come to the food. We ordered -

1. Mocktail(City Of Joy) - Rather than a mocktail, it was lassi in nature with a touch of strawberry flavours. Tastes good but with an expectation of mocktail, it was totally a failure.

2. Thali no 4. - From multiple options, we choose this one. The thali consists of One Laccha Paratha(They served us Roomali roti, instead of Paratha), 2Pcs. of Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Salad(With neglecting amount of salad, the kebab were served. Kebab were juicy and tastes good), 2Pcs. of Fish Reshmi Butter Masala(Fish pieces were soft and well cooked and the gravy tastes well), 1 Mutton Biriyani (Not worthy in one word, almost saltless and the spices amount was too minimum) and 1Pcs. of Chicken Chap(Okayish type, not so good.) Overall not so good as I expected.

3. Mutton Biriyani - With an expectation that, this time it will be good, but Bedouin fail to keep the promise. It was same in tastes like the Thali Biriyani. Absolutely not worthy.

4. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala - The dish tastes good. Chicken tikka pieces were well grilled, soft and juicy and the gravy was really finger licking.

5. Desserts - We ordered Butterscotch ice-cream with honey and Sundae rough roads. Honey touch in the butterscotch ice cream really impressed me and it tastes good also but the Sundae was not so special. With some chopped dry fruits and choco sauce on top, it feels like normal vanilla ice cream.

In conclusion, I will say Bedouin really fails to keep my expectation. With major failure in Biriyani, I will now think twice before my second visit. One thing that only impressed me, is the Thali system and the decent pricing. Overall not so satisfactory dining experience.

Last afternoon we went to Bedouin Gariahat. Its easy to locate . We ordered Bedouin special in starters (veg) which was pretty good . Well cooked veggies - tomatoes , onion, capsicum, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli. Also we had ordered fried rice and veg manchurian . The rice was good, smelled and tasted lovely the manchurian somehow was a turn down   .
For desert we had rocky road - vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce.

Bedouin was the first restaurant I went to when I Shifted from Nagpur to Kolkata back in 2013. Keeping apart all comparisons with its nearby competitions, this is a place where you'll get a small glympse of what a Bengali food restaurant and its bangaliana style service and food means.

Well since my first visit there, I had a constant order for every meal I visited for:
Lunch used to include Fish cutlet/paneer pakoda, Peas pulao/jeera rice, Chicken/paneer tikka butter masala(well I love a bit of spiciness in every part of my life) and Masala Coldrinks/lassi to end the cosy feeling.
For dinner main course would include Tandoori rooti/nun in place of the rice items.

Coming to the quality if service, the people in the restaurant just are lovely to interact. I literally talk to all people in the restaurant they also seem to like my small chatterings(Mind you, I can talk a lot when in moodüòú). As for the preparation, each item is made to the point to taste as it should owing to its name. One would admire that delicious smell when they bring the items to serve you. A must visit if you are in for a quick but delicious lunch

Bedouin is one of the popular Bengali and Mughlai cuisine restaurant located near the Gariahut crossing. If you coming from Kalighat metro, it will on your right side few steps before the Crossing. So lets come and discover this place.

Positive Point -

1. Sitting arrangements - They had huge sitting arrangements. So you don't have to wait if you will be there in the busy hours.

2. Thali System - The offers various kinda thali option with a low price tag. The items in a single thali are enough for one person.

3. Pricing - With decent pricing of every item, you can choose as much dish as you want within your budget.

Negative Point -

1. Service & management - The stuffs are less caring about their customer's satisfaction point and the serving time is too much. If have to wait a long time to get your food served.

Now lets come to the food. We ordered -

At the heart of South Calcutta, this is the best restaurant to have mughlai cuisine. 
Chinese cuisine is good but not as good as other restaurants nearby. 
Ambience is fine. 
Mughlai cuisine is just too delicious. 
Each and every dish is too good. 
Biriyani, rezala, chap, kasha are really good here. 
Rotis and naans are served hot and soft. 
Kebabs are very good too. 
Price is reasonable as per quality. 
Staffs are very well behaved. 
Moreover there is a feedback session here where you can give your reviews about the food.

Exactly at gariahat, when you are exhausted after shopping , you need a good ac restaurant nearby and Bedouin is the best escape place for it.
It has a wide range of menu from evening snacks to proper meal.
I ordered their mixed cantonese chowmein: whixh is a semi gravy chowmein . And trust me you would like it if you are a healthy person. No masala but great taste. you will certainly thank me for this . A 4/5 for it.
They have recently started with a few mocktail options . I ordered blue buoy , which was fine along the food but had nothing special about it. It was blant and ordinary ,a 3/5.
staff are very courteous and friendly.

One of the oldest multicuisine restaurants in town, it has a nice decor and good food at good price. Variety is good. You need to know the location well ( Gariahat More that is). They offer a huge variety of North Indian food like Chilli Chicken, Fried Rice as well as Chowmein. As this is a famous eatery for all shoppers at Gariahat, you are almost always destined to meet a crowd. My favourite is a chicken dish after all the hustle and bustle at Gariahat.

Ambience : The interior is below average.The mocktail is made right infront of the dining space and the constant noise of the blender is a big turn off.Overall, 3.5/10
Staffs : Extremely well behaved and welcoming.A complete 10/10.
Food : We ordered the veg thali which came for 200 bucks.It had one naan,one li'l kadai full of vegetable biryani with chunks of fresh veggies,paneer and a well cooked potato,dal makhani,paneer butter masala,one stuffed tomato and salad.The meal was enough to feed two and tasted more than amazing.
Price : There is no point in taking the service tax along with the 14.5 % tax.That makes it way too priced.

This is a good restaurant and it offers varieties of cuisine from North Indian dishes to Chinese platter. We have visited this place quite a number of times while we went for shopping at Gariahat.
The restaurant is spacious and a good place to visit with your family and friends. It is simple in decor, neat and clean.
Once I went there with my best friend after shopping and we have ordered for some Chicken lollipop kind of things(my bad I have forgot the exact name of the dish) and Chicken hakka noodles and Blue Lagoon.
The chicken hakka noodles was good but a bit oily. The chicken lollipop was nice.
Quantity was really good. I liked the Blue Lagoon it was good in taste.
Service is fast but the staffs intervene way too much and that sometimes kills the privacy of the people. Being courteous is good but they are somewhat over-courteous and I did not like that very much. Otherwise well and good.

This review is on behalf of my mother, Sampa Das. She was invited along 14 other friends by Mr Shankar Paul and Mrs Tripti Paul to a friendly lunch adda. All most all of them are senior citizens. The whole group, especially mother is overwhelmed by the quality and quantity of the food and the cordial service of the service boys. They enjoyed a lot having veg Bengali thali, ilish machh and chingri machh. They also had ice cream there. They specially mentioned that the service persons were very cordial and helpful. Most women in this group are very good cook too. So impressing them by bengali cuisine is not a matter of joke. Kudos to Bedouin-Sher e Bengal.

The restaurant located near gariahat surely is a nice place to grab a meal thinking about the pocket pinch. The ambience is so-so and the food decent! Yesterday we ordered a special biriyani and a chicken reshmi butter masala! They were insisting on getting their new drinks tried but we didn't as it would not be worth the price! A slight improvement in the courtesy of the waiters would be appreciable.

Located opposite Basanti Debi College at Gariahat,this place gives you tasty food-great in both quality and quantity at a reasonable rate.I went out with five others and we has ordered some mocktails first. The only thing I disliked a bit perhaps was the Virgin Mojito I ordered.It tasted a bit different from my expectation. The Blue Lagoon tasted great. We had some succulent starters-Chicken Tandoori and also Chicken Pakoras. In the main course,we had naan and chicken reshmi butter masala, and mixed chowmein and chicken manchurian.Everything was so perfect in taste.In desserts,we had firni,which wasn't too mindblowing,but tasty nevertheless. Now the waiter here was great in the sense that he gave us some great suggestions about how much food to order.One plate of Mixed Chowmein was actually sufficient for two adults and a kid!
Overall,great service,great food.
Shall definitely visit again!
P.S-do not forget to notice the three tigers(soft toys) before getting up the stairs!üòÅ

Went there a week ago. Ambience is okay type, nothing special. Took "city of joy" as the mocktail, but it was not much impressive. Odered Executive Lunch Thali No. 4. It was sufficient for one. Taste of all the dishes was okay. Also odered mutton biriyani and chicken tikka butter masala. Quality of biriyani should be improved, but the butter masala was tasty. In the deserts,  we ordered butterscotch icecream with honey and sundae rough roads, both were good. Pocket pinch was satisfactory but the the extra vat and tax made it much higher. Overall, if you are really hungry, you might take a look. Not at all suitable for any special occasions.

Staffs are courteous and proffesional . Ordered fish fry and kebabs for starters and chilli chicken with mushroom and hakka noodles fr the main course. The fish fry had a huge size and was very tasty. The kebabs weren't up to the mark though. The noodles were perfect though the chilli chicken with mushroom wasn't spicy at all...overall enjoyed the food very much

Always a pleasure to visit this restaurant. The waiters are extremely friendly and quite paternal too sometimes for those who are regular faces..Being a multicuisine restaurant, it lives up to its name. Have tried their authentic Bengali thalis as well as the mughlai dishes. Also the Chinese food is too good even comparable to the lovely Chinese restaurants of China Town. Some of my favorites from this joint are; mixed rice noodles, chitol machher petir kalia, ilish paturi, pulav with mutton kasha, ichor chingri and alu posto too. Am actually spoilt for choice whenever I visit them. And obviously I love them.

Not a big fan of the place but yes it wont disappoint.  
Service was good.  Pocket ponch was reasonable.

Nice small restaurant.  I've eaten here many times.  I've tasted their momos, noodles,  fried rice, various chicken preparations . Food is pretty good , so is the quality of food. I recently tasted their Rolls which is very good indeed.  That's a major attraction here.  Ambience is satisfactory.  Pocket friendly restaurant.

Today we had our lunch at this place. It is located near gariahat crossing on the left side while going towards desopriya park.  We had ordered two special mutton biriyanis, one chicken tikka butter masala, one chicken reshmi butter masala and a plain naan. The biriyanis came with two succulent pieces of mutton one egg and one potato, the quantity was enough for two but I dnt know why the rice was a bit spicy. The chicken sides were very nicely made and very tasty. The naan was eaten by my brother so I don't know much about that. Lastly we ordered firni which was so yum.

The experience over there was good and the stuffs were polite. Prices are pocket friendly. This place is worth a visit though I don't know much about the Chinese and Bengali dishes.

Located at the prime location of Gariahat Bedwin Sher E Bengal is a branch of one of the oldest Mughlai Dish makers of Kolkata. Not much space and simply decorated. We ordered Chicken Tikka Kabab, Crispy Chicken and Crispy Chilli Baby Corn as starters. All the starters were very good. In main course we had Chicken Tikka Biriyani, Mutton Keema Kebab Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Jhaal Frezy, Veg Biriyani, Rumali Roti and Paneer Tikka Butter Masala along with Fresh Lime Soda. Keema kebab biriyani was not good at all. We had mistaken it with something else. All other items were good in taste. Overall it was good. The service was a bit lackluster and the person serving us was rude at times which was unexpected.

Situated just at gariahat crossing which is very easy to spot. A decent budge restro which I have visited often, mostly during puja shopping. The interior is quite basic, nothing very pompous or shiny but enough to get oneself comfy. 
My last visit was during the durga pujas. The menu was restricted which is the same case with all tye restros in at that time. We ordered drums of heaven as starters. With was very good. I liked that tangy flavour and crunchy chicken. For the main course we took mixed friedrice and garlic chicken. Both were quite good in taste as well as quantity. The staffs are a bit laid laid back but they are polite. This place have not dissapointed me so far.

Bedouin: Cracking the Indian palate with aplomb.¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†

There are a set of restaurants who have cracked the Indian palate and taste. They Indianise everything and anything. And they are brilliant at this conversion of taste.¬†
Bedouin is one of them. It has everything from momos to Mutton Kababs. From egg rolls to Biryani. ¬†in keeping with their multifarious menu, i tried their Mutton biryani. The wife tried the momos. And the daughter tried the Hakka noodles.¬†
¬†
While the momos and the noodles were good, the biryani was fantastic. Succulent chunks of Mutton plus, one boiled egg plus one boiled potato ¬†- the Bengali way.¬†

The potions were healthy. And the best part was the bill: Rs. 586/- inclusive of taxes.¬†

Brilliant. Just brilliant.¬†

Am I visiting again? You bet I am.

Food tastes average,pocket friendly.I have been here innumerable times but yesterday when we had gone for late lunch,we had ordered roomali roti mutton chaap and chicken biryani.Firstly the roti was cold and hard.The chaap was good. The biryani was horrible.It was cold,lacked taste and the rice which has been used for biryani had a bad smell(the smell which happens in case of either poor quality rice or old rice).I would urge the management to look into the issue and recommend not to use poor quality materials.We customers are ready to pay a higher amount but cannot compromise with the quality.Kindly look into the matter.

pros- 1)has separate tables for couple or two people and that area is quite calming.

cons-1)other than the couples area the larger side is not so cool and very ordinary
2) prices are average but food is not so yum
3)have to go through stairs .
4) arrangement are little clumsy .

would only recommend to couples. families or large group of friends can choose some other place at the same price.

Easy to locate, Bedouin offers chinese, mughlai and bengali cuisines.
They also have a variety of thalis in each cuisine. The thalis are a reasonable buy and are filling. The food tastes good and price is moderate. A clean and well maintained place.
Changing my rating to a 3/5 because today was disappointing. Our food was served to us 25mins late and the waiter didn't serve our food on his own. We had to ask him to serve us the rice. After our meal we paid the billand were about to leave, when the waiter came upto us and promptly asked for service charge. We pointed out that the bill includes service tax. The waiter adamantly said that he wanted service charge. 
This was disappointing.

Humongous food quantity. 

We went there on a Puja day when everywhere was teeming with hungry people. They had a long queue but we thankfully got seated within 10minutes of waiting. :) 

We ordered the regular staple of Fried rice and Chicken Manchurian, and they tasted the way they should, nothing to complain at all. The chicken pieces were crispy fried before dousing them in gravy, that left a rather nice firm, crispy skin instead of the normal soggy one, which was enjoyable. 

The quantity was eye popping, as us two girls wished that there were a third someone to help us finish all that food. We literally could not finish it by ourselves. 

The place does need renovation and some cutlery with lesser scratch marks on them. 
But it was all on the money. No complaints. 

The service was prompt, helpful and attentive. Someone would always fill up our glasses of water everytime they got depleted despite of the busy time of a Puja day with so many diners around. These little touches feel good. 
I hadn't expected to have such a pleasant experience on our low budget, that too during Durga Puja. 

I'll come back surely, this time with more people to help finish all that food. :)

Avoid during the Pujas. This place will not serve you their regular menu. They are famous for their thalis that fits nicely in pocket. But the waiters always want to avoid serve the thalli. So my strong recomendation is even before you sit just ask if thali is available. If not the Al- a - carte is just a waistage of ¬†money.

Sher-e-Bengal is situated at Gariahat road, very close to the four-way crossing.
It is a popular restaurant that promises delicious food at reasonable rates.
They serve all types of cuisines from Chinese to north Indian and Bengali cuisine also. ¬†

We Ordered : Chicken tandoori and Special Mutton Biryani.
Tandoori pieces were tender,juicy and nicely grilled.Served with mint chutney and salad.
The biryani was really nice and moist and the pieces of mutton were well cooked.
¬†
The ambience there was nothing special but the eating experience was good.
The only problem was the service time and the staff efficiency.........

As it is pretty close to my house, I have visited this place quite a lot and have observed their food quality to go down gradually. No doubt it is a super pocket friendly restaurant and the quantity they serve is huge but all these doesn't make this place worth a visit as the food quality has become unbearably poor. Invariably causes gastrointestinal discomfort.

Perfect getaway from a hectic round of shopping at gariahat! 
The food is tasty,quality is good and service is dependable. Bedouin has been around for a while and the place seems to have gotten a bit of a renovation since the last time I was there. 
We ordered chicken drumsticks, fried rice and salsa fish. The bill amounted to 900 bucks for 3,pretty reasonable. 
The salsa fish was a delight! The fish pieces were crisp and crunchy,tasted delightful and to our very pleasant surprise,didnot have that odd smell attached to it. The curry was amazing as well! This dish will definitely make way to my table whenever I visit this place again! :)

And chicken tikkka butter masala...
Drums of  heaven with Manchow soup.
The soup was really delicious and so is the kulcha ..
But the drums of heaven ... I think they server incorrect dish.. it was like KFC chicken .. I have never tasted dry drums of heaven.

Hence -2 for bedouin ...

First time in here, obviously I went for biryani, needless to say it was awesome. Will try to visit this place again during pujo. Also the lemonade was pretty awesome, the prices here doesn't burn a hole in your pocket, taxes are not that much.

Located at the heart of crowded Gariahat, the place is spacious and inviting. ¬†The decor is understated and tastefully done. The balcony seats are a steal. The restaurant serves its customers a complimentary welcome drink. ¬†The chilli ¬†baby corn was spicy and crispsy and fantastic. For main course we had mixed fried chicken and mandarin chicken. The rice was delicious with generous amount of chicken and egg. The mandarin chicken was moist, quite a mouthful and tasty.

Our whole day shopping at gariahat finishes with a lunch in bedouin. I remember first going there with my grandmom. we ordered simple bengali dishes like sukto,macher jhol,mutton curry..food quality is good. service is also nice. great for a casual family lunch.

A place where you can have Bengali, Moghlai and Chinese food all under one roof. Its a reputed resturant with customers coming in all day.¬†
I personally have been to this place many times trying different things. If you are coming for the first time I would Suggest to have Bengali or Moghlai. Everyone must try their signature thali...¬†
Though I have tried Bengali Thali in Many places but have yet to see moghlai thali anywhere else. While the Bengali thalies are good but the Moghlai thalies with their combination of Kababs, Biriyani and Paratha or Roti and Meat really outdone s itself.

Overall rating.... a pocket friendly place to frequent with many choices on food. ¬†:)

Went for an afternoon lunch,the place is located at the heart of gariahat.A little difficult to locate the entrance though.You have to climb till the third floor via stairs so be careful if you are taking an elderly person along.
Coming to the service,the staff was quick and courteous.The place did not seem very clean.For food we ordered crispy chilli babay corn for starters which was spicy and a little sweet.I would have personally liked it a bit more on the dried side,next we ordered for a masala kulcha,peas pulao,chicken jhaalfrezy, onion salad.The Kulcha was the show stopper.Soft and buttery with a perfect spicy potato filling.The jhaalfrezy has chicken juicy boneless chicken tikka pieces with a perfectly spiced gravy.The peas pulao was a bit bland with no salt almost.We also got a Chello kebab packed for home.It consists of 6 reshmi kebab,two mutton seekhs,rice,salad,egg poached,stuffed capsicum.The mutton kebab was very dry and chewy.The chicken kebab was nice on the other side.The stuffed capcicum was again bland.Allover a nice experience.

I have Been coming here for quite a long time as its a pocket friendly restaurant in the heart of Gariahat.

 Its an average restaurant with a lame decor, they attract a lot of customers because of there prime location. 

THE food is average, nothing to boast about. The Indian Section is good compared to the Oriental one.

 The service is poor.

Visited this restaurant many times and tasted both their Chinese and Mughlai preparations. One of the very few restaurants which excels in both the cuisines. My current favourite is The keema Naan and the Afghani Chicken which is mouth watering in taste. I once tasted a starter with mushroom and chicken in it and it tasted wonderful. Its unfortunate that I could not remember the name. The restaurant is also known for its Bengali cuisine even though I have never tried it.

Well..this is one place which i surely heard a lot about, very reasonable price and friendly staff and all.
True, price is reasonable and staffs are good. But what makes an eatery worthy is its quality of food. I must say i am not satisfied with the food i had here. The taste and quality were not really up to the mark. For example, the butter nun became hard and rubbery from the minute it was served and the chicken jhal frezi was way too spicy. The tandoori chicken was however not bad. But i think bit more of hygene should be maintained in the food, something that was lacking.

So nice that the staffs have become familiar too..They always welcome us with a smile on their face..there's a uncle(don't know his name)who always b ready fr serving things on our table n tells us more about the food n all..
My favourite item in mocktail is "choco-moco" n trust me it's damn good..I have never tasted such a good chocolate shake..
The other foods are also tasty n within reasonable prices..

Its quite an arduous task to find a reasonably good restaurant in Gariahat. This one is situated in the heart of the shopping district on Rashbehari Avenue. At the groud floor entrance a number of soft toy tigers will welcome you, then you climb the stairs to the first floor and enter the dining area. Decoration is quite good though nothing exceptional. 
Variety of food is what catches one's attention. Right from Bengali delicacies like ilish maach bhaja and Kochi panthar jhol to Chinese delicacies....they have it all !!!!
The chicken tikka biryani is one of the very popular Mughlai items.
My personal favourite are chicken sweet corn soup and gravy noodles. I find it quite rare to find so much variety under one roof and must say they are doing a great job.
Price is very moderate and service is good.

Cheap, good food. That's what Bedouin is to me. Located at Gariahat, you'll see this place while walking towards triangular park. Restaurant is on the first floor and you have to climb up a flight of well maintained wooden stairs for that. Ambiance isn't all that great. Very mediocre. However, the food has hardly ever disappointed me. I've only tried Indian cuisine here ( it's called Sher e bengal. I can't eat Chinese here.) The chicken lababdar, reshmi kabab, chicken biriyani, butter masala, mutton keema, chicken bharta, the Naan... everything i just mentioned is on point. The chicken dishes are juicy, never too oily to make you feel bloated. The biriyani is extremely filling. The Naan is buttery and soft. The staff however are a tad bit rude and sort of unapologetic about it. The food and the the price at which you're getting it however makes you look beyond the otherwise frowned upon flaws.

Well this is my go to place when I'm shopping in Gariahat and almost out of money. With 700 or 800 odd bucks in my pocket, this place is truly the restaurant to come to. They have hardly disappointed me with anything that I have tried. Be it biryani, be it any chinese item on their varied menu, I was satisfied with the quantity and the quality, and that too at such a low price. All in all - a good place for some low budget lunch or dinner. Keep it up Sher e Bengal.

This has been our patent adda-dine in zone since the time we had our college in golpark. As this place is in gariahat, on your way to triangular park, very easy to locate. Me, my friends and family are a frequent visitor of this place! My favourite starter has been always crispy chili babycorn and in chinese main courses sanghai chicken, lemon chicken have been soothing my taste buds every time! 
Indian cuisine is speciality of Bedouin, their combo thalis all are awesome and suffices one person plus half. Chicken lababdar, reshmi kebab, chicken biryani are the must tries of this cuisine. The servers are thorough with menu, though sometimes they are a bit rude( which is a negative point). The seating arrangements, light, background music is average. The main catch is the value for money, you are so full when you leave this place and it costs you reasonably.

This restaurant has a very nice ambience.We ordered Mughali Thali-1 which consisted one of baby Naan,Veg Pulao,Chicken Kosha and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The chicken dishes were absolutely delicious.The Pricing was not too high either.The staff were courteous and the service was quick despite the restaurant being almost fully occupied.The only thing I did not like was the Veg Pulao.Veg Biryani was not available so had to go for Pulao. Apart from that everything was good.Would surely recommend this restaurant to every one!.
Edit 1: Went for the second time and tried their biryani. It was awesome!

Bedouin is one of those places I see everyday whenever I go to my house from Gariahat. The big red building is what you need to know to get to this place. Bedouin is one of the popular places in Gariahat where you will get every kind of cuisine, from chinese to tandoor to bengali. This is one of the one stop solution places for food lovers. I have been to this place many a times in recent years and today was another day.

Location:
Just few steps away from the Gariahat Crossing. A big red building which you can see from the main road and Bedouin will be right infront. A very easy place to find.

Ambience:
The ambience is quite good. Its different. The restaurant is made in a old building. The place has a wooden touch all over which makes it look classy. The place is spacious and comfortable. They have a balcony section which is quite nice. You can see the Gariahat from the top.

Service:
The service is nice and fast. The staffs are well behaved and well trained. And knows their job well. They are attentive enough to fill your glasses with water as soon as its empty. A very good sign.

Food:
The quality of food is really good and better is its quantity. I love their preparations. The Biryani is quite good here and its getting fame too. These are the dishes you can go for if you are here:
#Fried Rice
#Chilly Chicken
#Hong Kong Chicken
#Biryani
#Chicken Tandoor

Last Words:
Well, you will get every kinda dish here. A very good place to have some good food in a reasonable price. A place you would not disappoint for sure.

We had our food home delivered and the dishes ordered by us ¬†were Masala Kulcha, Keema Nan, Tandoori Roti, Paneer Lababdar, Chicken Butter Masala and the giant Bedouin Special Thali. Each and every dish was extremely tasty and the kulcha and nan were extremely soft. Coming ¬†to the gravy dishes, both were spiced to perfection. Last but not the least was the thali which brought a huge smile on our faces. Overall, this restaurant serves great food at equally great price and is must for repeat and repeat visits.

Sher-e-Bengal is situated in Gariahat, very close to the four-way crossing. The entrance is through a pathway on the right. It is a popular restaurant that promises delicious food at reasonable rates. 
I went there last week with a cousin for lunch and there was barely any other customer, so the slightly late service was understandable. Staffs were very generous and although the ambience there was nothing special, the eating experience was good. We weren't really craving for Biriyani at the time and decided to resort to breads in the form of Butter Nan. That was accompanied by Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Mutton Rezala. While the former was a winner in terms of taste and quantity, the latter was plain and the gravy extremely watery. 
Despite eating a good amount of food, we didn't frown upon the bill. Overall, it's a nice restaurant that caters to the demand of a massive number of Gariahat visitors at the right prices.

Been here a couple of times!
One of my favourite multi cuisine restaurants.
So location is very easy to track down, around the left side over Gariahaat Rd.
So here I start spilling the beans. It's absolutely a fine dining place with spacious interiors and they also have window side places for two for cozy dining, from there you can get the entire view of the hustle bustle of Gariahaat.
Coming to food :
On my first visit I tried their north Indian, which was pretty good.
Chicken kosha with biryani was so luscious that it's hard to forget.
Tried their thali in Bengali items as well ... Portions were amazing with respect to the price.
On my second visit tried dishes from Chinese cuisine.
Egg Hakka noodles with hot garlic chicken.
Well as per as the price portions were more than enough in this case also.
But then I must say they weren't authentic Chinese.
I'm a bit critical about Chinese... So that's why the taste of hot garlic was a bit odd to me. But plus point they serve 8chicken pieces in that :)
So MY RATINGS : :
FOOD : 3.5/5
SERVICE : 5/5
AMBIENCE : 4/5
VFM : 5/5
**** Extra points for : Staffs are very prompt courteous :)
*****Service is very fast! Just 2mins and MAGIC...the food is in front of you!

I mainly prefer to have north indian food whenever i visit this place. I usually order Chicken tikka butter masala or chicken dopiaza. Their biryani is pretty average.¬† And I don't like their Bengali thalis. Once i had fish thali and the fish was very stiff and tasteless. They also serve Chinese dishes which is again very ordinary and overpriced. The ambience is decent and service is satisfactory. So if you are planning to visit this place try to go for their Indian dishes.

Have taken away food from here a lot of times.Went there for lunch on a rainy afternoon with a group of 10 friends.Food is pretty good.The biryani is really good.The side dishes that we had were pretty decent too.Reasonable prices.Not much of an ambiance or decor.

If u are in for a quick bite... Go for it...
But there are far better and greener pastures nearby........
Food:  4/10

Okay so here i come again to write for Bedouin Sher-e-Bengal this time.. at first coming to the quality and taste.. The tastes are indeed worth an applaud.. We ordered Butter Nan, Tandoori Roti, Masala Kulcha, Chicken Lababdar Masala, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.. Thhe first sight and scent of all of these were mouthwatering. . The satisfaction they gave to the taste buds had just proven the fact.. The Masala Kulcha that I had was the best i had till date.. Both the chicken dishes were excellent. Qualitywise it was good but ¬†too oily to recommend to a fitness freak or a 'petroga' person (cant find an exact english Word :P), although spice and oil and butter and ghee have always been the key to Indian cuisine since antiquity. The food was not so spicy though since we had our friend who coughs every now and then at the slightest odour of chilli/ peppers didn't seem to do so that day.

Now coming to the quantity.. the nan and kulcha were heavy enough to order for a second time.. the chicken dishes that we had contained 6 pieces of boneless chicken each.. Since we were six people, it was kinda perfect for us..¬†

The ambience was not extraordinary..

Finally coming to the price, for a middle class man going to dine with his family or be a student giving birthday treat to friends or be it at your own cost for yourself, it seemed quite pocket friendly to me..

So according to me it is quite recommended for all you foodies out there.. Just choose a time When Kolkata Temperatures gets tolerable, not in his hot summer..

Ever found yourself in a situation where you are roaming in Gariahat from store to store, shopping recklessly, and suddenly you feel hungry and you have to shift your entire focus on where to eat?

Shopping? or Food? a tough choice to make. I know.
This place addresses the latter worry.

The outlet is famous, so finding it is not a problem. Plus there is a man sporting a turban and a mustache, waiting at the gate to welcome you. What a start!

The dishes are of decent quality, and the service is fast. It caters to the taste buds of a Bengali and Non-Bengali. Fish and chicken preparations are both great. Even veg dishes are good enough.

I always order North Indian food, with a fish fry or fish curry added to it. It does the job; food from where I belong, mixed with food from where I am. :)

Prices are moderate, and the bill goes easy on the wallets. I highly recommended this place if you are in Gariahat!

Ambience was alright. But the food quality was absolutely satisfactory at the price at which they come. Hong kong and Singapore noodles are must tries. The chicken side dishes vary from sweet to spicy. You can always ask the waiter about the perfect combination and you will be guided in the best direction. Service is really nice.

Situated at the heart of Gariahat market, this place is a common drop in for hungry souls tired after a long shopping period. Ambience is nothing so special, not bad though.  Staffs are nice. The preparations are nothing to die for, but not bad either. Quantity is good enough to satisfy to people. They serve all types of cuisines from chinese to north indian. All of them tastes good. Prices are reasonable. Overall a nice place to calm down your hungry soul....

This restro is located at Gariahat although it is situated right on the side of the main road still one may have missed it due to the positioning and also the existence if too many footstalls. 
From outside you won't realise that even a restaurant is situated there. But The inside ambience is very nice. It was very rightly lighted up. We had mutton biriyani and Chicken Tandoori. 
Biriyani was very nice less spicy and light still very tasty. The amount was also very good. The pricing for the biriyani was justified too. 
On the other hand chicken Tandoori was brilliant too. 
The servicing was also very friendly and prompt. We were delivered our dishes very quickly Hence love to visit there again...

A regular place to visit when mom took us shopping. Gariahat for shopping, kantha work and batik, and at noon when we could no longer stand the sight of stacks of cloth, we used to turn to Bedouin's. A hearty meal of chicken and veg momos, served piping hot with a large bowl of egg drop soup and plenty of cabbage and spicy red chilli chutney, or one of their Kolkata mein World Famous rolls. The ultimate Street Food fanatic fantasy.
Though it's located in some alley of Gariahat (and one tiny "Solely For Rolls" outlet stuck outside) it should not be so hard to find. Because of the crowd, duh. One of the outlets featured in Times of India (Kolkata) Street Food Fest.

This was my first visit to this joint along with my extended family.We were a group of 8 people and dropped in on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.Seating was  fairly comfortable and the staff made adequate arrangements to seat a large group like ours.We ordered the following:

1. Elish thali

2. Pabda thali

3.Bedouin Special Thali

4. Tandoori Chicken Biryani

5. Chicken Chaap

6.Chicken Reshmi Kebab

The fish thali was essentially an assortment of Bengali dishes and comprised of plain white rice,dal,shukto,jhuri aloo bhaja,mixed sabji,papad and chutney.The pabda thali was served a mustard based gravy of pabda and likewise for the elish.The size of the fish was decent enough.Quality wise the elish was far superior and fresh as compared to the pabda.Prices as compared to the bedouin thali was much higher.The elish thali was priced at Rs 470 and the pabda thali was priced at Rs 270/.Please do note that the prices mentioned in the restaurant menu may not tally with the actual price charged to the diner.This is as per their standard reasoning that fish prices vary on size, market conditions and quality etc.Rest of the bengali items in the thali was decent enough though not exactly lip-smacking.

The bedouin special thali comprised of roomali roti,veg fried rice, paneer butter masala,mutton tikia,chicken bharta, fish and chicken kebab and salad.The taste of the dishes was okayish, nothing brilliant about it.Please do keep in mind that the size of the helpings in the thali are quite miniscule and might prove to be insufficient for big eaters.

The tandoori chicken biryani was ordinary.The tandoori chicken was quite well made though.There was no egg or boiled potato in the biryani as is the norm for Kolkata style biryani.It was served with a small helping of raita.The chicken chaap was horribly salty.It was totally ruined.The chicken reshmi kebab was quite well-made though.Each dish comprised of 6 cubes of chicken.It was not that chewy and the chicken pices were juicy and succulent.

Prices are reasonable though fish items are a tad expensive.Staff behaviour was courteous and attentive.

Loated on Rahsbehari Avenue.

This is an extension of the Bedouin ROll shop and offers complete dining facilities.

The decor and ambience is very basic and normal.

The menu includes bengali, chinese and mughal cuisine.

The bengali food is good, specially the prawn malai curry and the mughal cuisines boasts of good kebabs.

The chinese stands out in terms of fried rice and sweet and sour chicken.

The only problem is the service time and the staff efficiency.

[Location]
Easy to locate,in the gariahut area while going towards gariahut just watch out you right hand side you'll find the place.still not then go for the google map.
[Ambience and Interior]
Very good and well maintained place,sarounded by wooden things all over the place,which gives a good look.
[Foods]
1. Pineapple juice - nothing very good,just very average.mixed with pineapple syrup,the color was good but the taste not upto the mark.
2. Mutton keema kabab - mutton keema mixed and marinated very well,was very soft.used absolute proper amount of ingredients.very soft,grilled very well.portions was just ok,taste wise average.served with mixed salad with sauces.
3. Bedouin special egg fried rice - this one very good,cooked perfectly.the amount they served just enough for two person. Mixed cashew nuts,beans,properly made cutted egg portion.portion of the egg and rice was preety much decent.lovely I have to say.
4. Chicken butter masala - amazing must try this one,amount was good.cooked very well,as well as chicken portions and the chicken parts were very good in size.taste was very rich and full of flavours.the gravy was very much thik.the flavour you can feel and smell while eating.
[Service]p
Have to¬†say the stuff who took our order and served us,even also suggested us some good foods,specially the chicken side dish.served all the foods step by step.this type of service very good.

This place is the one stop destination for all the basic cuisines available in Kolkata. A year back, they have renovated the restaurant, the ambience is good and clean.

Always a favourite for north indian food and rolls. Offers not much in ambiance or decor, but the reasonable food and amazingly tasty food are the reasons why bedouin is still a gem. Even though it offers Chinese, it is not up to the mark so opt for north indian only.

Location- Located just opposite to basanti devi college and next to bata this is a very famous place in gariahat. The roll counter is there in the ground floor whereas the main restaurant is in 1st and 2nd floor. There is a separate ac waiting room there at 2nd floor.
Ambiance-  When you climb those steep stairs u wont be expecting much but you will find a decent ambiance after entering the place. 
Food quantity and quality- I have been to this place for many times and ordered diffrrent items. However i would like to mention some of their items. In bengali cuisine-  the fish thali,in chinease i would like to mention mixed fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. In mughlai ,tikka butter masala is a must try. 
Thalis will be served with one mixed veg,dal,potato chips,papad,chatni along with the kind of thali you ordered. 
Now my favorite item here is the mixed fried rice.. Its womderfully prepared with ample amount of chicken,egg and prawns. It tastes wonderful. 
For all the chinease chicken items they offer 10pieces of boneless chkn with ample gravy.
For mughlai items ,boneless chicken items are served with six pieces of chkn.
Now coming to quality , they offer extremly well prepared items. This kind of quality comes with experience ajd bedouin-sher e bengal being an old restaurant here is maintaining their reputation.
Staff - This is actually the first thing you will notice about this place as their staffs ar extremly well behaved and gives you a homely feeling.
Overall- Like they says"we assure quality,quantity and price", I would agree 100% with their tagline. This place is highly recommended and I being a regular customer of this place will be regular here if they keep on maintaining this wonderful service.

The best thing about this restaurant is the service. The staffs are friendly and suggestive. When the hunger increases after climibing the stairs, waiting for food becomes irritating. This is when the fast delivery of food grabs the attention. Ordered Chilli baby corn, Chicken Tikka Kebab as starters. Both of them were delicious. For the main course, as per the previous reviews, ordered Chicken Lababdar Masala with Tandoori Roti n Rumali Roti. I must say it is highly recommended. The pieces were very soft and the taste is awesome. For desserts,  Firni and Kulfi were good. As I visited this place first time, had no idea about the quantity. This is when one of the staffs suggested the number of Rotis we should order so that 'no food gets wasted'. I just loved the respect for food he had. The quantity is value for money. Looking forward to visit again. Keep up the good service :)

I'm giving them 3.5 because my order experience is not good when it comes to home delivery. (Their food is great and i have only praise for that!) Sometimes they accept and deliver promptly, sometimes they reject the same order. Maybe they have their own reason, but I felt let down as I quite like their food.
As for food, well everyone knows about their mughlai dishes. So here's a few on their Bengali dishes. They make killer shukto. Just yummy. And that crispy fries made from julienned potatoes that are must with moog daal, they get it quite right. Their veg thali is reasonably priced and has the foodie Bengali's pancha banjyan twist. Their fish dishes look good too. So, if you're not feeling like opening your kitchen but want a full course Bengali meal, go ahead and order from them. And while you are at it, order a double serving of that shukto.

Visited this place on Panchami night! We had to wait for about 10mins before we could acquire a seat. The place is spacious and the interiors are done up in a nice way. Coming to the food - we ordered 2 plates of a combo meal which included lachha paratha, chicken kebabs, fish kebabs, mutton biryani and chicken curry. At 260 bucks, this combo is a bomb! Each of items were delectably cooked. There was ample food for the 3 of us, that too at a very low price. The service is prompt and I really liked how they were managing the crowd of hungry pandal hoppers! Way to go! Coming back again.

Located at gariahat one of the most popular resturant there. The resturant serves almost every dish and the combo meals is also quite good having a wide range of dishes at an affordable price. Had the rui thali which included rice,dal,sukto,alu bhaja,veg item(gobi curry) chutney,papad and rui(rohu fish). The quality of food is quite good but the quantity of rice is inadequate and the fish though quite big tasted a bit bland. Previously had other combos which were quite good(executive thali). Staff is also friendly and service is also quick got the dish within 10min of order.Overall a good value for money resturant.

This place had been a great foodie haven since years. Every Kolkata resident must have been here atleast once in their lifetime, and I am no exception. So this was the friends' meet and we decided to gorge here again. The first thing I noticed is that the decor has been changed. We ordered cantonese noodles, chilli pepper chicken( but CP fish arrived), Fish kebabs, hot and sour chicken soup, firni and fresh lime soda. I was a bit disappointed when our orders weren't delivered correctly. When asked..the house replied that..they didn't have order writing pads with them as number of customers are low! But yet we enjoyed the food! Hope to go back next time and get the correct order delivered.. with the same quality of food.

Loved the food joint. Was hungry after a tiresome day at college. Dropped into this food joint. The enormous food delicacies on their list surprised me. Chinese as I had ordered was great. And quantity wise, absolutely perfect! Service is good too. Pocket friendly as well. Interiors are nice. Other than this, they serve you within 10 mins after the order. Satisfied.

Went there in the early hour...the restaurant had just opened and me and my friend hopped in to have lunch after watching wasir.
The staff was in too much of a hurry to feed us and he knocked us too many times to decide what we want to have.
We ordered one mutton biriyani,one chicken fried rice and one mutton masala. The bill was somewhere around 450ish and undoubtedly the money was well spent.
The only complaint I have is with the staff who served us...he literally made us pay him some extra money for his service and it was really awkward.

A restaurant I've been visiting almost thrice a year for at least 7 years now. My parents are very fond of the place as its a boon for those post-puja-shopping afternoon fillups ! Their bengali 'Thali's are a hit among the elders of any bong family and every bit of it reminds you of home-made bengali food ! Try out the Mutton and Chicken Thalis. The Mughlai cuisine is okay-ish with the Chicken Biryani standard not being up there with the specialists in the category. Coming to Chinese, they're good at it, Chilli Chicken and Mixed Fried Rice taste just the way they should. They have had some changes recently and I miss their older plates n dishes which had a wood-ish finish to them (Hehe :P) The service is pretty good but beware of the crowds. The last time I went there with my friends during this year's Durga Pujas and we had to wait over an hour to get an arrangement for 12 people. You happen to be stuck in Gariahat with a grumbling stomach ? Help yourself here to some awesome 'Bangali ranna' ! üòÑ

Visited again. While this time it was a bitter experience. The delivery time was unusual. Took more than 40 mins to server 3 simple dishes. While the tanduri üçó was bad enough to write the other two dishes were nothing special. But I guess the price make a big difference here. Quantity is usual as any other out there.

This is our favorite haunt since my college days. The restaurant has always been known to give quality food and that too at affordable prices. Talking of "Paisa wasool" yes, the restaurant is sure to make you happy with the rates. However, I would like them to keep the quality and quantity of their desserts consistent.¬†
The restaurant offers great quantity whether you eat there itself or whether you order for a takeaway.¬†
If you are just going with a single friend, then you might be sent to the balcony to eat your lunch or dinner. Good restaurant!

The location and ambience are as simple as it gets, but don't judge a restaurant by its looks. The food is delicious and the staff really courteous.. They really love their customers. We ordered mutton biryani. The rice was soft and mutton tasty.  Chicken lababdar masala was lipsmacking. Though the desert rocky road was not that great, but it was worth the price. Don't miss this real good place. I'm gonna visit again for sure.

It's a very old and familiar place to most residents of south kolkata.I ordered from them courtesy zomato order app today.They have a lot of choices for biryani-chicken tandoori biryani,fish tikka biryani,chicken tikka biryani.i took mutton egg biryani,fish tikka biryani and chicken noodles.the best thing about their biryani is it's very soft,not much oily and very easy on the palate and the stomach-a very homely version of the park circus counterpart.the noodles resembled meifoon noodles,but wasn't exactly so and was quite nice.the bad part of the experience was that they add container charges even for non-gravy items like these.Or maybe,it's a zomato glitch they take advantage of-The zomato order UI isn't smart enough to detect whether an item is gravy or dry,and so for restaurants exacting container charges,it automatically adds container charge.restaurants like alibaba,kasba are honest enough to deduct this from their own bill,but not bedouin.

I think it's the best place to have mughlai cuisine in Hindustan park. Do go for the vegetable Malai kofta. It has that toothsome malai and spicy flavour with the amazing vegetable stuffings inside , which goes as a perfect concomitant with masala kulcha or naan. Daal makhani and egg biryani are also awesomely delicious. The staff is super polite , service is fast and the eating area is sufficiently comfortable. The cost is also not exorbitant. I am very impressed over all by this restaurant. üëçüëç

I have bookmarked this place for a long time but finally got a chance to visit there today for having lunch with my friend. We preferred the couple seat beside the window of balcony and it was comfortable. The staffs were well mannered. After a prolonged confusion either to order Chinese or North Indian finally we have ordered Vegetable biryani and Chicken lababdar masala. After ordering we have to wait for a long time as the service was a bit slow. When the food finally arrived and we started eating, it was just perfectly tasty and yummy. Firstly, the Biryani was light and I personally found it better than other Biryani outlets nearby. The chicken dish was beyond my expectation. Chicken boneless pieces were perfectly cooked in a thick, sweet, buttery gravy with cherries and cashew nuts and it tasted too much awesome. Quantity was also sufficient for two of us. I am very much satisfied and happy with my lunch. Surely like to visit again and taste other dishes. As per as my recommendation Chicken lababdar masala is a must try.

This place is a regular for me. Most sunday nights and even weekdays and nights. It rarely disappoints and is probably the most consistent among the various other restaurants here. Many "multi-cuisine" restaurants around this locality and none of them come even close to the consistency of this place. A perfect balance of budget - quality - quantity. Big thumbs up.

For the first time in years , this place was a big let down when we went to have lunch yesterday. We ordered a full plate chicken egg biriyani , and one full chicken tikka masala. First , we were amazed as they served minimal quantity of biriyani in a pot as a full plate biriyani served here is adequate enough for two persons. Second, the chicken in the biriyani was half cooked. Coming down to chicken tikka masala , the chicken pieces were so hard that it became unable to chew . And the gravy  tasted aweful. I am,greatly dissapointed with their service , as i have visited the place several times since my school days and their quantity and quality of food has always been satisfactory. This rating is just because of all the experiences before yesterday. Otherwise they deserve a 2 rating .

went there last week (november 2015) on a friend's birthday treat and i must say i was disappointed by the service.¬†

the interior was re-decorated with white chair tables (the last time i visited all was in bright red decorations). we were the only people at the restaurant there, at 7pm tuesday evening.

the service was very bad. we had to call the waiters repeatedly to come and take the order. we ordered chicken drums of heaven as starters and it was delicious!! a little bit spicy yet crispy.

as maincourse we ordered 3 mixed fried rice, manchurian chicken, chicken butter masala, kashmiri chicken. it was a bit of combination of chinese and indian mixture according to individual preferences. we were 5 friends!!

we had to call the waiters 2-3 times repeatedly before they would come and fill up our empty glasses after we drank it all.¬†

even after we finished the starter, and when they served the maincourse, they didnot even change our plates and we had to call them and say to change our plates (they were about to serve the maincourse in the same plate of the starters!!)¬†

the same thing happened with fork and spoons. they didnot change our spoons after we finished the starter and we had to call them and say it to change!

the quantity of food is good, and quality is nice.¬†
i believe the service needs to be improved.

This year during Durga Puja After a lot pandel hopping when we decided to finally have lunch,zomato suggested us bedouin.But if you are trying to locate this place via google maps you might get confused,so keep yours eyes open for the big sign board.

Decor is Okayish but the staff behavior was great.Even during puja rush they attended to us with good care and helped us deciding the order.

As for starters we decided for Tikka and Reshmi kabab at first but they suggested us to have their puja special kabab.We were a bit skeptical but when the food came it was really awesome.

The Biriyani was great,really less spicy and less oily yet it tasted good.
As side dishes we ordered Chicken "Reshmi Butter Masala" and "Chicken special Lababdar Masala".Reshmi masala was okayish but lababdar masala was a delight mouth watering kababs in sweet and sour yet indian style gravy.It was quite a new experience for me.Verdict: Will surely comeback to taste more of their menu.

Chicken Lababdar with Butter nan is a must-have combo. It's too yummy. And i can't stop raving about their signature thalis. An assortment of rice, rotis, chicken and veg dishes,etc is simply delicious. The price is reasonable as well. An excellent joint. Will be going back soon! Ting! :-)

Whenever we are shopping at Gariahat or my parents make a visit to Kolkata we make sure to have at least one meal at this place or order for home delivery.
Their Bengali thali spread with variety of fishes is my parent's all time favourite. Since I dont prefer Bengali food that much, I always opt for their Chinese cuisine.
Quantity is just perfect, rather I would say, we have to pack food back home. Which customer isnt happy when they get to pack their meal? :D
And their pricing is just pocket friendly. Been here just too many times since my college days to keep a count now.
Can't comment on their North Indian spread as I never have had tasted anything on that menu. Its always been Chinese for me and my friends, and Bengali thali for my parents :)

It is the only place in Kolkata where you get proper Mughlai Thali...which is unique....they have various options of that Thali.

Biryani, Chicken Lababdar, Chicken Chaap (@Rs 120/-) is 5 star !

If they had a Muslim name (like Zaheer/Sohail etc :) ) probably their rating would have been at least 4.5 !

However their Chinese section is basically to cater to popular demand of people. It is quite ordinary staff.¬†

This is essentially a Mughlai restaurant - please stick to it......

When I was in Kolkata, I visited this place quite a few times. After marketing at Gariahat, this was the must go destination for us. I tried different kinds of food here- Mughlai dishes to Chinese cuisine.

Their quantity was quite good. Price was also quite reasonable.
I liked their Chinese, but tried their biryani once and it was below average.

Overall, it is a good place to go after your shopping.

This was topped off by Kaju Kulfi which maybe was a tad below expectations maybe because by then our expectations were sky high. All in all an awesome Saturday traditional Bong lunch served up by a Bedouin - which means Nomad in Arabic...

This has been one of the oldest restaurants at Gariahat area; serves more or less do-able Indian; the deal becomes all the more sweeter for the prices. They have a few good Thalis which are really a steal. 
Recently, had the murgh lababdar, a sweet gravy of chicken tikka with dry fruits and rotis. Also, savoured the fish and chips; at INR 100, the fish and chips were a steal. Two large pieces of fish, thinly coated and lightly fried is enough to lift your mood.

The food here taste great. I ordered thali no. 4 and 7 . The quantity, quality and choice of dishes in the thali was appropriate. Though I haven't given 5 as there is scope of improvement in service and time taken to deliver. Must go if you care about just the food and not ambience. (Y)

Bad is the only word that comes to my mind when I think of this place.
ambience is bad, seating arrangement is bad, service is bad and the waiters attitude- lol. Feels like they were feeding us for free.
Too cramped and feels like an old house. Old is not the charm but a flaw.

This restaurant comes up in shining armor to any soul in hunger. It is multi-cuisine in its true sense. I especially love their Bengali dishes which reminds one of home instead of the artificial ¬†aroma about most of the bengali restaurants these days.¬†The Mughlai and Chinese are also good but i personally don't feel highly about their Biriyani.

This is multi-cuisine restaurant in its true sense. We have tried their Mughlai, Bengali & Chinese and I'm pleasantly surprised to state that they are equally adept at all cuisines.

The Biriyani was excellent as were the Chicken Chaap and Firni. 

We've also had their Thali Lunch meals - prawn meal, chicken meal & mutton meal and all the accompaniments along with the mains were absolutely wonderful and delicious. We'd started off with their Fish Fry; it was simply awesome and a great value for money. Haven't had such good Fish Fry at such affordable prices in Kolkata. The Chingri-r Jhaal was the best we've had in a restaurant in a long long time. My elder one simply loved their Chicken Kosha & and my younger one and I, being a mutton lover, gorged on the Mutton Kosha wanting more.

The attendants were cordial, well mannered and helpful.

Verdict: Must try :-)

The place is really hard to miss if you are in gariahat. I went there with great expectations but was a little bit dissapointed. The food along with its ambience was ok to say the least. The butter nan was quite good, itwas soft it was easy to eat but the chicken tikka butter masala was not that good. There is something called too spicy and this was a perfect example. Maybe it is for those people who enjoy very spicy food but it is not me.

Went there in order to meet a friend a few months ago. My friend had already taken the balcony seat, and I loved the view of busy Gariahat Road from there, however this cannot be overlooked that the passage to the seat is very narrow and even the waiters are having problem going through the same. Otherwise the restaurant is neat and clean and it seems it is very popular since I saw other would be customers patiently waiting by the door for any seat to be free.
The maitre de table is friendly enough, but he tried to show off his expertise in Chinese by contradicting the choice of food made by my friend. " Schezuan prawn is curry less " he said firmly. Turned out that the same was full of curry. My friend of course took it in his good stride and did not complain, but he later told me that a good waiter should never contradict the choices of the customer, as this is a great measurement stick for his expertise as a good waiter. The food arrived very late, by that time my friend was almost collapsing in hunger. But the food is good and plentiful.

visited today for the first time with a friend.

Moderate price. within budget.

Food is not that great; pretty average. Service is moderate. Didn't have to wait too long. But the ambience is very good. Especially today it felt really nice as it was raining outside and we took the window seats; looking outside through the tinted dirty semi-transparent glasses gives one the kinda nostalgia Kolkata is well-known for. Quantity is more than sufficient. ¬†Overall a nice place for some quality time spending. Would be looking forward to visiting again.

Sher-e-Bengal really surprised me with its Indian food. The outsides don't do justice to the decor inside. Its not very gaudily decorated. it's kept simple and I enjoy this place.¬†
I went there in a group recently and opted mainly for the thalis. I love the food quality. But the thali probably is a little overhyped as far as quantity goes. it won't be a bad idea to go for the dishes individually. But the food quality is really great!¬†
As far as Thali no 2 goes, they gave a good amount of rice, with not too much of gravy. But the Reshmi kebabs were awesome!¬†
We also had opted for Thali no. 3, which was relatively more balanced.¬†

The service was pretty good. I've been tempted to try a few more of their dishes. I will be going back there soon.

Overall, great job!

Update : Went there again with my friends only to find out that their service (i.e. from the waiters) has gone from bad to worse. When we ordered for mutton biriyani the waiter said it is out of stock whereas just after a few minutes they took an order of mutton biriyani from another person who came for a takeaway. They also said that they only have four plates of chicken biriyani left but after ordering four plates of chickwn biriyani we were surprised to see that they had enough amount left to provide 6 new cuatomers with the chicken biriyani. Otherwise the quality and quantity was as good as mentioned in my previous review.

Never judge a book by its cover and this place totally defines it to the hilt...situated at the heart of gariahat,nearby on the opposite lane to basanti devi college.We went for the thalis and boy oh boy! weren't we in for a dawat!!They have packages in thalis catering to different demands depending on your pocket and your needs which isn't seen at too many places. A much needed change though.

We went for two different thalis one Thali no-2 consisting of Rumali roti, Chicken Lababdar masala, Veg biriyani /Pulao, Chicken reshmi kebaband Thali-4 ¬†consisting Lachha parantha ,Chicken reshmi kebab, Fish Reshmi butter masala ,Mutton biriyani and Chicken tangri.¬†

Once served,the amount was good enough for 3 bigtime foodies.... even me and my besties being such foodies could not move an inch after going through all on platter.

Ambiance is very basic ,but service is extremely prompt and fast which is very much noteworthy. The staff are communicative and listen to your needs when order is being taken. What they lack in ambiance they make it up with awesome service and finger licking food.

Coming to the food.Chicken reshmi kebab ,Fish reshmi butter masala,chicken lababdar masala, & chicken tangri ¬†were just deliciously sinful, succulent pieces infused with trademark spices tantalizing your taste buds making you swoon in its flavour.

As your dig into the Biriyani (both non-veg & veg) one striking feature is the amount of less oil deposits and the rice grains don't stick at all,giving a good example the preparations that goes into making their dishes is very much pro-health.
As for the paranthas and roti the dough used is off good quality as one doesn't have to really fight with it to tear it.As for the pocket pinch ,its very much easy on the pocket, our bill came upto around 500-550 inclusive of taxes.

Update 15th July, 2015
Went in the afternoon and ordered Hong Kong Fried Rice(7/10) and Chilli Chicken(7/10). Both were good. The rice was reddish( the picture came dull in color). Was a fair experience not good neither bad. This time they packed the left overs, but last time, they made us pack it ourselves.
My ratings are based on all the updates. The pic has been added too
Update 13/5/2015

Visited this restaurant again on 12th May, 2015.

The restaurant was completely empty and thus, it was good for us. Calm and Quiet environment is what I loved at this moment. It was 3 in the afternoon.

We were 7. They offered us a table which was for 6 persons , which got us congested.

We ordered

3 Chicken Biriyani

3 Mutton Biriyani

1 Reshmi Butter Masala

2 Chicken Rezala

The Biriyanis were satisfactory, but not good enough. The meat in it was well cooked and moist. The quantity was sufficient as well. The Biriyani also had an egg in it which was a plus point. But , as per the quality and quantity is concerned, when I am paying Rs 130/135 for Chicken/Mutton biriyani, I expect 2 pieces of Chicken/Mutton, and their quality is not so good that it would make up for it. I am a young student :D.

Reshmi Butter Masala was simply awesome. Well cooked and the flavors sprouted out very well , and the combination of the spices were adequate to stimulate my taste buds. After a long time, I came to an Indian Restaurant with my Friends. One of the Biriyani has a small piece of hair in it. They completely disagreed to change it. We did not pay any tip. Had rated it 4, but now I'm reducing it to 3.O for the hair thingy , behavior and congested seating . In the old review, I spoke about their good behaved staff but this did not happen before (the hair thingy).

OLD ONE

Best choice for quality food and prices as well,at a closer distance. The prices are pocket friendly and the quantity is good for a monster like me. They take time to produce the food to the tables but its okay and have seen that ones ordering after us,are getting their dishes long before we get,the orders being more or less the same. But that's considerable. Chicken and Mutton Biriyani is provided with an egg and the quantity if rice is above satisfaction.

Chicken Kasa was yummy, Pepper Chicken was a bang for the buck, Ginger chicken and chilli garlic chicken was palatable.

Their Chinese menu runs good for the quantity but this restaurant is better for Indian delicacies, Chinese dishes,fair. Love their Chicken Tandoori :D .Not a big fan of Chicken Chaap as I taste Oil only. Hav tried out their thali 3 and 4. Both have award winning quantity and certifying taste. Chutney was not that 'Bhaloi' types. Nawabi rohi and Khusali Vetki took my mind away as well.

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, I WILL POST HONEST REVIEWS AND PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT .BUT AGAIN, DIFFERENT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES, TASTE AND OPINIONS.SO , PLEASE READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS BEFORE COMING UP TO A CONCLUSION. MANY ARE OF A BIT HIGHER STANDARDS AND THUS DON'T LIKE THIS PEOPLE AND THE PEOPLE AROUND. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, EVERYONE IS PAYING MONEY.

You can get a different taste of biriyani from what you had tasted all these days. With a wide range of menu, this restaurant is situated in the heart of Gariahat a perfect place for shopaholics to rush for lunch. Although the ambiance is a bit clumsy and the service is slow but the quality of food overshadows it. Chinese is also good here. Most importantly the quantity of a dish is sufficient to fill two stomachs. Bedouin rolls are also famous, I would suggest you to try the kathi roll. After shopping its time to relish good food in good mood :) :D

Typical Mughlai / Chinese fare. The seating for two-at-a-table in the extended balcony is very middle class and depressing. The waiters look unfed and disinterested. Ordering your typical chicken pepper and salt and butter nun following chicken sweet corn soup, which we did, was most unsatisfactory. Families and shoppers (in the jostling of the Gariahat footpath in summer) kept coming in eating and leaving with a satisfied lick of the lips, very unappealing and common. Not a great food experience but okay to catch a quick bite and refill before resuming one's shopping!

I particularly like their Bengali food coz it has that 'barir khabar' taste. the Chinese is okayish. the crispy chkn is quite good.. coming to the mughlai food, they make Kolkata style biriyani which is not very heavy. the chicken chap is very tasty but has a lot of oil... but disappointment are the kebabs which are very dry...

Well, if you're looking for a pocket friendly yet quality and quantity restro, go for it!! Tired, after a shopping spree, you can  hop in this nice and cosy place and dig into some yummy Thai Soup and Drums of heaven. It's great to have snacks and evening small bite here. They are filling and pocket friendly. 

A must visit in Gariahat area!!

I have been a regular at Bedouin since its Nandi street branch days! But the quality of food has deteriorated over the years- I say that with grief.
I went to Bedouin yesterday for a ate lunch with my friend. We ordered for the thali 4- which the staff mentioned was available but partially as the tandoor was closed.
Hence we opted for the Special Mutton Biryani & Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala- we thought afterall what could go wrong with these trademark dishes.

We also ordered virgin mojito & hawaiin pinacolada as refreshments.

But boy we were in a shock when the food came- Biryani was sereved cold and was returned to be served hotter. I think they had run out of butter and hence cooked the chicken reshmi in ghee- which tasted extremely weird! And as for the drinks pinacolada was yummy...but virgin mojito was a blend of jal jeera and mint jelly at the bottom. Our throats were burning after consuming just 1 sip of that drink. When we complained about the drink, the staff retorted rudely that this is how it is made. We told them to take the drink away and give us a fresh lime soda instead. When that was served, the soda was overflowing the glass and it had foam all over.

Utterly disgusted, I vow to never to go this place again!

Apart from the location and the interiors of the restaurant, there isn't anything that interesting about the restaurant. You need to go there few times before you know which dishes are good. Like the rice and roti dishes are quite good. But the side dishes vary. Reshmi butter masala is very good while chicken lababdar won't impress your taste buds much. All over, the place is good and you can definitely give it a go.

Good place to hangout with friends and family, I know this place since my school days. Being a BONG you can order any popular fish item here. Ambience is good and the service is also fast. Mughal food was good here but the quality has gone down over the last few years. Try not to order two different Chinese dishes at the same time, cos they all taste the same... ?

I have my favorites at each and every restaurant and in this case it is the chicken butter masala. It goes perfectly with the butter nun which is so soft and made to perfection. A little towards the sweeter side, this chicken dish should be accompanied by green salad and fresh lime soda (if you wish) and you will remember that feeling for quite sometime! Service is fast and worth mentioning..

Went there with my gang on a pujo day quite a long time ago.
Odered chicken biriyani.kadhai chicken.rumali roti.mixed fried rice.chilli chicken.
The quantity was literally huge.
The quality was superb as well.
The ambience...was ok.nothing mentionable.
The food being good made our tummies happy.
And because i had an awesome physics sir who knew some people here...we were blessed with complementary soft drinks!!!!;)

One of the most reasonably priced, high quantity of eatery providers. A regular in this restaurant, fondly one of my favorite restaurants providing multi-cuisine delicacies at a good price and considerably on the higher quantity side. Usually, I prefer parcel options, and have experienced a good thing about the restaurant on non compromising of parcel quantity with that of direct consuming quantity. Vegetable Fried Rice costs about Rs. 100, and rest assured two people can sufficiently have the quantity of rice they provide with a suitable gravy. ¬†The crispy baby corn is one delicious recipes of their kitchen. Thus, one of my favorite restaurants providing good food and in a satisfying quantity.

This is one restaurant which survives mostly on their sales of rolls from the take away place. Very few people would have actually gone to the restaurant inside. I have been inside a few times. The food inside is decent by Kolkata standards. Nothing special here. But the rolls are absolutely crazy. This place sells rolls like hot cakes, with the staff often filling up 30 rolls at a time before selling them.
The low rating here is because while the roll shop outside is so good, the restaurant inside cannot keep up the same standards.

Who cares about the restaurant inside when you have one of the best roll joint.
The roll shop in Gariahat which kept its name over the years.
From the first paneer roll I had here half a decade back till now it has never disappointed me.Be it the kebab roll or a simple egg roll, this roll joint fills your stomach at a low cost and keeps the smile on your face.
If you do have less money on you try the paneer tikia roll priced only 20- It will make you come back and have it again
and if you do have money, go all guns blazing and try the egg kebab roll,the best in gariahat I had.

No... This outlet doesn't look the least or atleast, emulates the look of those big roll outlets like Shiraz. Aminia, Nizam, etc. 
But remember what the wise old men have said-" Appearences can be deceptive", and this outlet is no exception.
My first day here had me ordering a chicken tikia roll for myself, to appease my growling stomach. And when I dug in, I was visibly moved ( good food will move you, trust me.) At 40 Rs., I had a delicious roll in my hands- the roti of the perfect thickness, a good amount of chicken stuffed in, along with a well- balanced potato stuffing. And that's not all... You've have a vast pool of different kinds of rolls to choose from- panner, fish,  chicken, mutton, etc., all at very affordable prices. So shopaholics, go grab a bite if all the shopping makes you hungry.

After one of our recent shopping sprees at Gariahat, Ma, me and the Mr. landed up in this old favourite. ¬†The ambiance is nothing much to write about, the staff were strictly okay, not too knowledgeable about the fare on offer. We decided to play safe and ordered a mixed fried rice, a salsa chicken and a manchurian chicken. The quantity of the rice was huge, and one plate was perfectly sufficient for the three of us. The chicken was nicely cooked, the gravy spicy and tasty. With our hunger totally subsided and our tummies feeling happy and at peace, the Mr. and Ma settled for tutti frutti for dessert, while I opted for butterscotch ice cream. Overall, a good meal, totally value for money. We also decided to order a Vegetable Fried Rice and a HongKong Fish as take-away for Dad, however, this is where the restaurant failed me. The quantity of fried rice in the take-away was almost half of that served on the table. However what particularly dampened my mood was the fish. Very small chunks of fish heavily layered with batter formed the dish, and the entire dish was a complete wastage. While the dine-in gave me a strictly okay experience, the take-away absolutely ruined it for me.

Food: Quantity is huge and quality is very good. One plate starter, one plate rice/noodle and one plate side dish is more than sufficient for 2 people. I love their mushroom, prawn and chicken dishes from the Chinese section. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: Recently they have renovated the place. Ambience is standard. There are special couple seats in the balcony. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Service is a bit slow but staff is attentive and well-behaved. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Very very affordable because of the quantity factor.

Overall I give it 3.5/5.

Bedouin -Sher e Bengal is located in the heart of Gariahat . It has two floors , the upper and lower floors are decorated by wooden and white sunmica respectively. The ambience is so so , neither bad nor so impressive. The best part of the bedouin is that it serves a wide range of foods including indian, chinese, mughlai,continental etc. Served foods are good in quantity and quality. I used to go here for ¬†thali no 4. It has a wide range of thali and the best part that the cooking is very tasty. Mixed chow min is also very good ¬†and quantity is more than enough. I think this is a place where everyone should visit .

The staffs were not that trained but were on their toes and very quick with the service. Food was great, freshly made and really reasonable. Good portion as well. Nice place to relax and have your food after a tiring day with a tight budget. Loved the mocktails as well as their indian dishes.

I have been her for a quite a few times.. but thelast visit dint stand out well.
this place provides a good variety of north indian food. one must try tandoori roti/butter nun with their special chicken lababdar masala, which is awesome. other than it, all the chicken gravy dishes are very good, ¬†some mutton gravy dishes also contains egg but their taste might not impress all but still its good. the biriyani is not that good infact average comparing to kolkata's bests, the mutton piece was very dissapointing, it was complete bone.. i haven't tried chinese here, so that part will be remained unsung. i would definitely recommend this place for north indian food but for biriyani and chinese i would say this place lags behind a bit.
how far ambience is concerned, the 2nd floor is good but the 1st floor is just sucks, its walls are covered with white and red tiles which results very much light which will you definitely not prefer..¬†
so, overall on the heart of gariahat, this place really delivers and also very few times it dissapoints.

The name is itself enough,which they have made over the years and are keeping it greatly.
The service, hospitality everything is nice and appropriate.
The foods really taste good and the quantity is sufficient enough for two. Moreover the pricing is justifiable keeping in mind the ambience, food quality and quantity, and probably the only restaurant which let's you take away(parcel) your food at your will. 
A good, nice place to hang out with friends with lots of food and gossips.
If you visit Gariahat with a little time on your kitty, try having your lunch here, I'm sure you will get your money's worth..

Went to the place couple of times. The place is conveniently located near Gariahat crossing. The place serves both Chinese and North Indian dishes. Tried both of them. Chinese are not al all upto the mark. We ordered Chilli Chicken and Chicken Manchurian both looked tasted same. The north indian dishes are good in that respect.¬†
One most irritating thing is the staffs are very poorly trained.

I went to beduin few hours ago with a friend... ordered biriyani(mutton)  & kasha mutton.... they gave a plate of mutton chaap without confirming us... we 1stly refused it...they said since we have ordered we have to take the chaap...the quality of chaap is very poor as we found...

we gave a feedback to owner...but the owner 1st didn't accepted it...after many customer started taking the fish & rice is stale...then the owner said ... he shall see...but by the body language he confirmed he doesn't bother..

only thing is they give the bill very fast & take money before any late..

i shall never recommend any friends & known person to visit  bedouin-sher-e-bengal-gariahat again....

i shall give 0/10... for behavior quality & service...

Any ways we were waiting and food was delivered within few minuets. Our first ¬†expression was this is too much. Yes, quantity was pretty big. so we ended up taking rest of our plates home. we don't like to waste food. any ways the food tasted goodish okay.

This started off in a small lane - Nandi Street and was a small place that served great rolls. In time it had a small dining room precariously perched on a mezzanine floor and it added a delicious Bengali Thali. The taste and service obviously brought in crowds and led to its growing in to big place on the main road.
Alas neither the service nor the taste survived the shift.
This is NOT to say the food is bad, it good and value for money. And the thali is still the highlight. 
The rolls counter on the ground floor is highly erratic in quality and even availability.
The service and the flavour that differentiated Bedouin from a score of other similar places are both causalities of a change not managed well. 
Big is not always better and Small was Beautiful.....
But the place is definitely worth visiting and is certainly better then Bedwin at Gariahat

I have been here a many times....most of our birthday treats are given here only by my friends.... We couldn't decide to go anywhere else to give treat to about 10 to 11 people and that to within our budget.... the food is exceptionally good and the quantity is huge... From fried rice to side dishes to biriyanis everything is mouthwatering... among rice i really liked chicken seven hearts fried rice and singapore rice. but my favourite is chicken reshmi butter masala. its so buttery and the chicken is so moist and soft... I just love it and keeps on ordering the same every time....
the ambience is nice and the waiters are also polite....

After they have upgraded the decor,this has become a litle better place to visit. Their rolls have always been good(From the counter downstairs and ya,i have tasted them ALL).
You can always expect seats to be available here and being located at a convinient location the place is easy to find.The biryani here is good and sufficient as well as the other Indian main courses -the chicken and mutton items like bharta ,chap and kassa are all good and is served in good amounts. Besides,the other chinese dishes available are good too.The veg fried rice tastes good,but you can get better than theirs.The chilli chicken and manchurian are good but if you visit this place you better stick to the Indian dishes as they are good at it,however chinese is not below average.

Sher e Bengal is one of those places where I go quite often with my friends. Their Chinese is like Indian Chinese.. Very spicy types. Some of the chicken starters are really nice. Crispy chicken is one of those items. It is a favourite item... Its crispy and spicy and tastes really good. 
Their Thalis are fine taste wise. But the quantity that they give is really a lot!!... Price wise, this restaurant will definitely fall in those budget joints. 
The ambience and decor isn't that good. It has ac and is good for informal dining. 
It is located in Gariahat in the main road which goes towards Rashbehari.

The chicken were succulent, the rice rightly cooked, and the desserts just wow. The dishes are aptly priced and service is quite good. A must visit place.

Bedouin is simply the go- back- again restaurant for my family. Standard ambience, good food, and quick service are its USPs. Their biriyani, chicken reshmi butter masala, chello kebab, chicken tandoori and kebabs leave me salivating whenever I think of these items. They use good cooking medium and I have never faced any health problems after eating out there. The portions served are well sized and lot of dishes are available on half servings which ensures you do not waste food and save your money as well. A great place for family eat outs!

Bedouin reminds of my college days.Being a South City Day student, we used to venture this restaurant on regular basis. The restaurant was on Nandi Street, Gariahat in those days. The entire lane of Nandi Street smelled of Biryani those days before it shifted to the present location.
Bedouin recalls a pocket friendly meal for friends and couples. Mutton Biryani is something that makes me salivate. It was awesome. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala served here is better than many upscale restaurants in the city.
The only negative attribute is the service personnel who are not much courteous to diners. Ofcourse we can blame the huge crowd for this.
Just try their Mutton Biryani, Fish Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.... its lip smacking.... !!!!

Whenever there's a plan of eating out with school or college friends,this is the first place which comes to my mind. Good food at an affordable price. Chicken drums of heaven as a starter id awesome. You can try out the mutton spl biriyani here. Scwhezwan chicken with fried rice is a good option. The only problem i found is that they take a lot of time in serving the food. I went there ladt week and they took 50 minutes to serve our food even though the food we ordered was not huge in amount. Otherwise its a very nice place.

I went here last Thursday to have lunch alone. I was pretty skeptical with the food after I saw their price list and the set up. Let me explain!
The price list seemed to be very very competitive and their set up quite elaborate; a big dining hall with proper AC!
Also, I was on the phone all throughout while i ordered. The steward very accommodating and did not use an extra word to distract me.
I ordered Mughlai and to my surprise the food was quite good. The chicken was perfect and the breads were very soft, but not under cooked. This is very important for me as I do not take butter on my breads, a failed attempt to contain my weight ;-)
I was very happy with the food and the service while I was talking on the phone and not to the stewards at all! My glass kept getting refilled without me caring for it. Of course, I did not expect them to serve the food to a single person in torn chappals and bermudas :-P My palette of a chicken dish and 3 breads summed up to a mere Rs. 197!
The fight started after I paid with my credit card and I put down the tips on the merchant copy... The cashier Debashish was adamant to accept this and said I should have mentioned the tips before he swiped. I heard this the first time that you mention the tips before they swipe. trying to make him understand that the tips are to be written on the merchant copy and the TIP row comes up only for the restaurateurs specifically for that was a failure. I had to tip the steward in cash and laugh my way out... but he almost ruined the feeling of the good food.

This is definitely a must go for all the people who want are foodies, do not care much about the frills and like it light on their pockets!

THIS PLACE. It has been my family's go-to ever since we discovered its existence. Back then it was located in Nandy Street. I was what, 11-12? We've turned it into sort of our extended kitchen since then. And ever since Sher-E-Bengal turned up in Gariahat, we've re-coursed to it very very often. Like, 2 Fridays a month. I've had practically everything on their menu and they are AMAZING cooks. No you will not get 5-star ambience. Very standard tables and slightly dim lighting. But the food is really really good. It's very easy to reach, as it's a just a short distance from Basanti Devi College or the Rashbehari Spencer's whichever you know better. So that's a big plus. Personally I think their Chinese menu is the better one. 

They give you a huge amount of food. By huge I mean that 1 bowl of noodles can easily feed 2 hungry people or 3 not so very hungry people. And the food is normally always fresh, thoroughly cooked and super duper tasty.

From the Chinese Menu, their best items are:
1. Crispy Chicken
2. Spring Chicken
3. Pepper Chicken
4. Garlic Fish
5. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup
6. Salsa Chicken
7. Kung Pao Chicken
8. Seven Heart Chow
9. Shanghai Chow
10. Burnt Ginger Rice

From the Indian Menu:
1. All the kebabs
2. Chicken Lababdar
3. Chicken Rezala

The food is very very reasonably priced. Till recently they didn't even have VAT! A very nice place to take your family. I take away .5 from the rating because of their lack of variety in dessert choices.

Bedouin is that kind of place which you can never really get off your wishlist. No matter how many times I visit this place, either after shopping at Gariahat or after meeting with some friends nearby or after getting totally exhausted after walking and pandal hopping during the pujas ‚Äì even after so many times, this is that sort of a restaurant that always sits pretty high up in my choice list. 
I quite like the interiors of this outlet. Though it may not be much of a looker, but still has a kind of old-school charm about the place and that is what I like. It may not be very spacious like other outlets of its kind, but you most probably wouldn‚Äôt mind that, since, at least for me, I have found the seating quite cozy and comfortable. 
The food, well, is definitely very good. Honestly, I have been here many times, lost count really, and I have had a whole lot of things that they serve.  Of the things I can feasibly remember are Chicken Drum Stick, Hong Kong Fried Rice, Schezwan Chicken, Prawn Chow, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Chap amongst others. I guess the items don‚Äôt really need much description and it may suffice, to say that all of them were good. In fact, good enough. I cant remember any item which has disappointed me quite much so that‚Äôs about the general opinion that I can have of this place. In fact, during the peak hours of the puja rush, the service was quite quick and we didn‚Äôt have to wait a big deal. Unlike many other reputed outlets which have disappointed me during the puja with their slow service. But thankfully, not Bedouin. So, on the whole, this is one restaurant I would like to revisit when I can, and I hope that they would serve the same kind of good food that they have till now.

A very underrrated restaurant in Kolkata, the Bedouin-Sher-e-Bengal is a delight for food lovers. Their Chinese food is very nice as compared to the Indian but still on the whole, the quality is awesome. Also in quantity and the price is very reasonable.
Coming to the waiters, you can't find anyone else who are as friendly as they are. :)
The rating could have been a perfect 5 from me but for the location and accessibity of the restaurant!!

I am visiting this restaurent from more than 10 years.. We ordered crispy fish, really delicious, juicy and would love to have it again & again.. Then chicken fried rice which was okay and the quantity was good.. Then chicken with baby corn and mushroom.. This was also good for me as I don't prefer much spicy & oily food much.. Good place for family and friends.. Couple tables have got plastic chairs not good and comfortable for them at all i guess and also separated from the rest of the tables of the restaurent.. Cost is moderate..

It has been a while that I have visited this place but have several memories attached with it. I was in my late teens, early twenties, during my college days that I have had my brunch, lunch and dinner here. 
Extremely down-to-earth, not proving to be a big shot but a restaurant that serves pocket friendly GOOD food is the best way to define Bedouin. I have stuck to their Chinese menu always and never been disappointed. I loved the Chinese chopsuey they made. Mostly we ordered a dry garlic chilli chicken, chopsuey, soft drinks and ice creams. The portions used to be HUGE for two people and we were generally overfull by the time we finished our meal, and the bill always within 400 INR. 
Bedouin found its place in my heart in the then days of Calcutta not having seen flourishing fine dining restaurants.

Bedouin is a name you must have grown up hearing; it's an integral part of the North-Indian-Chinese potpourri of Calcutta cuisine. It is one of the few restaurants where I haven't been disappointed by steadily declining food quality or quantity. I have had the same Biriyani with a touch of Dalda ten years ago and I can say without regret, I love it. The portions of meat in the Biriyani- mutton or chicken- are generous and tender. The Biriyani isn't overspiced and I like the fact that a good portion of the rice is plain white. I like the mellow but robust taste of the side dishes, the Chicken Butter Masala and Bharta. The Butter Naans are generously dappled with butter, but I found them a little chewy. The staff seemed pretty non-chalant, though the service was not too slow.

This place is a wonderful joint for Bengali cuisines. Although they also serve other varieties of food, I always dig into the Bengali food. Certain items are as good as Bhojohori Manna, albeit the pocket pinch being on the lower side. Service is alright; nothing special, but not bad either. And they could renovate the place a bit (i deduct 0.5 for the interiors). Overall, a great pleasure both for the taste buds as well as the pocket.

Bedouin- is located near GAriahat basically if u go from Citi style straight it is located on the right hand side- there's a board on the top. Serves Chinese, Indian , Bengali food. Bengali people love Bedouin as whenever I have visited it is always crowded. I had tried the chicken biriyani , some Chinese dishes , Shirley temple.
They were pretty good - quantity wise , not much oil in biriyani - hygenie wise. I gave a visit here often with one of my Bengali friend as he suggested me. Restaurant is located at first floor.

Coming to pros and cons: 
Pros 

1) provides guest house service cum restaurant service
2) staffs are well mannered
3) crowd is decently 
4) quantity is very good and hygiene of food is maintained.
5) love the chicken biriyani out here - due to its simple and sober preparation with aloo and boiled egg. With very less oil
6) Chinese is also not bad

Cons : 1) service needs to be quick. They have delays at times. 
2) could be renovated and made a better place - Ambience needs little improvement 

Rest, all is well :)

Sher-e-Bengal is a restaurant situated at 200/2B, Rash Behari Avenue, Kolkata. It includes North Indian and Chinese cuisines in its menu chart. It is a dining hub of Bedouin group. It is one of the famous and old dining houses in the major shopping area of South Kolkata, well known as Gariahat. 

I have been in this restaurant many times because this is a place where an array of eateries is available at reasonable rate. You can make your choices from Chinese, North Indian and Bengali dishes. The restaurant is itself spacious but the arrangement of dining tables and chairs has made the both the dining halls on first and second floor, very clumsy. 

I visited the restaurant recently with my family on a Sunday evening after a lot of shopping for upcoming Durga Puja. When we entered the dining hall, we found many other families like us, enjoying or placing orders for their dinners after a lot of shopping. One of the staff guided us to a table for four.
Once we were comfortable, the same person came and asked for the order to be placed. After a little discussion among ourselves, we placed our order. As we knew that Chinese is our only option here, for starters we ordered Dry Chilli Chicken for three of us (my father, brother and me) and for my mother, we ordered Crispy Babycorn and Mushroom. For the main course, we ordered Chicken Chowmein, Chicken Fried Rice and Veg Chowmein along with Salsa Chicken and Chilli Fish. The food was good as usual.  

Sher-e-Bengal's Chinese is good and can be rated as mediocre but after tasting North Indian once or twice here, I came to a point that this is simply not their cup of tea. I am a regular diner at popular North Indian houses like Zeeshan and Arsalan and after tasting at those places, you will not feel like having North Indian at this restaurant. 
Moreover, the service here is also not up-to-dated. Although there are a number of waiters, often I have seen that after giving a number of calls to the waiter, they finally respond. The waiters are also not well trained. Once, it also happened to me that while dine-in I placed an order for take-away and they served that item on the table. 

To be frank, this is not a perfect dining hub if you want to enjoy a lip smacking and luxurious dining experience.  But within pocket friendly budget, you can surely enjoy average quality of service and food here.

Well, nothing is great about this place! In spite of a wide range of menu, nothing stands out. We ordered quite a mix of everything - Chinese, Mughlai & Indian. Very mediocre food, must say ! Although, Chinese was little better, but other were really uneatable. 

The service is bit sluggish and the staff looks little under trained. The ambiance is really sad and contains confusing seating arrangements. Oh yeah, personally I felt the place, smelt bad too.

This one is precisely a sad place that compels you after every minute to move out. Overall, it was not a pleasing experience to remember.

Reasonable and good food are the key USPs of this place. Service is moderate. Putting everything together, one will not regret dining here.
