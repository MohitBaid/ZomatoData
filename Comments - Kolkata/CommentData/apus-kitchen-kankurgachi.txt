Very popular take away joint in Beliaghata, located at prime location near phoolbagan kalimandir. They serves good quality of food & quantity is well enough too. Recently tried their Tandoori Biryani, Mttn Biryani. Quality of the food is awesome considering the price. I like the idea of tandoori biryani.
Previously tasted lot of dishes from here, liked most of those. Like Mttn biryani, Mttn kasha, chicken fried rice, chicken drumsticks etc. üëåüëå

Local fast food centre, perfect enough to spoil any foodie like me. This place is 8 to 10 minutes away from my home. So as you can guess I visit quite often. Tasty food at low price is its speciality.

I had ordered drums of heaven from here and I must say I was pretty surprised with their quality of good chicken and that too at such a low prize. They were tender and were coated with thin batter -- a perfect combination of what you would absolutely love!

A small street food outlet. A few benches are laid outside.A great place for chicken biryani. Their chicken reshmi kebabs are fantastic.
Preparation might be a bit delayed but worth the wait.

I odered Chicken Tandoori Biriyani, consists of a tandoori chicken leg, a boiled egg and a bengalis bliss aloo. It's great in both terms of quality & quantity. Certainly, Apu's kitchen turned out to be my fav biriyani joint near my plc @ kankurgachi.
They even serve some great rolls. 
Great go for foodies!üôåüëç

Apu's kitchen is the new favorite biriyani joint for people residing near phoolbagan. The biriyani is great both in terms of quality and quantity. The chicken tandoori biriyani is something I have never ever had, and the first time I had this I felted that this could be my new favorite biriyani. Yeah I know I am exaggerating, but I really loved this and each one of you should try this once and I am sure you'll love.

My review for the Roll place of the area Part 2. 

This time it is Apu's Kitchen, serving this purpose for Beliaghata and outskirts of Phoolbagan. 

The place is always full of people ordering rolls, chow mein, biryani and takeaways. The food is cheap and the quality not bad. If you want to taste authentic Kolkata Street food, this place is a hamper for you, unless you are a cleanliness freak.  Since, I live nearby I visit the place quite often and wasn't disappointed.

Ordered Chicken 65 and dal makhani. Dal was not available. The cook obviously did not know what Chicken 65 is all about. Hence i ended up with a dish grilled and spiced, but not even close to the recipe. If you cannot cook your dishes, maybe you should consider revising your menu.

Situated at the Phoolbagan Kalimandir bus stop, Apu's Kitchen does well being a street side fast food outlet.
Every evening, shoppers, office-goers, and other localites swarm at their counter for rolls, moghlai, chowmien, soup and biriyani, to name a few.
Its our favourite, for serving tasty food at pocket friendly price. Even the biriyani they prepare, tastes somewhat close to the branded outlets like Shiraz, Alibaba, etc.
When theres nothing much to munch on at home, we people from Beleghata rely on Apu's to satiate our hunger.
(Remember to tell the person at the counter to not add Ajina Moto to their Chinese items)

Near Kali Mandir and Kankurgachi Moore is this food centre. Well, it exactly cannot be termed as a street food centre because of its extensive menu.

A small establishment petite and clean. The counter delivers service on time.

Just grabbed two Egg Chicken Rolls this evening. Crisp, tasty, richly stuffed with chicken dices and a sauced salad, the rolls were delicious to bite on.¬† Each of the rolls costed 50 INR. The menu seems to be quite reasonably priced.

It can be concluded that Kankurgachi finally has its roll joint that is able to meet your expectations.¬† Recommended to all localites.

Apu's kitchen is another street restaurant serving a lot of dishes from Chinese to Indian. It is located in Phoolbagan area. Seeing high crowd & phone orders you expect their food quality to be great. But that's not the case over here. Behavior of the staffs aren't good & they doesn't care about your orders too. Serving takes little long. Take out is better option than get sited in front of the restaurant.

Drums of Heaven : Hanging Chicken Kebabs in front of the restaurant looked pretty delicious to me so I ordered some Chicken snacks. 10 pieces of dried Chicken Lollypops were there in Drums of Heaven. Lollypops were of medium sized but absolutely dry, over fried, oily & tasteless. The juicy feeling from inside & outside were absolutely missing. No spices to taste nor it was saucy outside. It was total wastage of Rs. 160.

Conclusion : Apu's food quality isn't satisfactory neither their price for such foods. Not at all recommended. Trying some other place in the same area will be far better option than them.

A local food joint with quality food. They put in a lot of effort to make their food tastier than any other local food joints.
Located just near the Kali Temple in Beliaghata, this food joint offers a wide array of dishes, from rolls to momos, Chinese and Indian, as well as a wide range of snacks. They also feature a list of special dishes.
A must try for all the local people.

Apu's Kitchen is the kind of place Kankurgachi was missing. A proper roll and fast food joint, they manage to serve pretty decent mains as well. The most alluring thing about their joint is the pricing -- relatively cheap compared to other food places at this level.

Forget food and pricing, the best thing about the place is their kitchen -- cleanest place I've seen in a while. They have their own brick oven and are well staffed.

The food is alright -- nothing out of the ordinary. Their naan is alright -- nice and large. Their tandoori is a little dry though. I'll have to visit a couple times more for a better understanding.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Went down to the newly opened kankurgachi outlet to order Chicken Biriyani for take-away.
"Absolutely tasteless" the first thing came to my mind..the royal smell and taste all were missing which we all are used to have at the Arsalan's and Nizam's, etc.
After opening the Biriyani Pack, To my utter shock, the staff missed out in providing me the egg with which the Biriyani is incomplete though I have ordered quite clearly- Chicken Biriyani with Egg!! 
SORRY!! UNIMPRESSED!!

A little gem... Not easily visible thanks to a renovated bus stand at Phoolbagan Kalimandir.... Notwithstanding, this outlet has become extremely popular of late as it offers some of the best food in this area, and that too at amazingly affordable prices... Their Kathi rolls and special Tandoori items are mindblowing... You have a vast array of Chinese as well as Indian dishes to chose from and despite the mixed cuisines on offer, the ones I have managed to try thus far were excellent... Takeaway is the preferred option and they also deliver at your doorsteps for free in case you live nearby...Overall, an excellent option catering to us foodies in an area largely deprived of good restaurants...

This place opened recently near my house and i have to say it has become quite popular in a matter of few months.This is definitely  a place where you would only opt for a takeaway-- mainly a fastfood serving shop.I have tried their chicken rolls on quite a few ocassions and they were decent enough.But something that i order mostly from them is their biriyani.Now the shop owner claims that the person making the biriyani is an "ex-arsalan chef" or rathr someone who used to work at arsalan.The biriyani that he makes definitely tastes good.Obviously i wouldnt dare to compare it with arsalan but the taste is quite good and add to that the huge quantity they give-value for money is what i would call it.Their biriyani is definitely better than that the shiraz across the street serves.I even tried their fried rice quite a few times which i personally find very tasty.Definitely looking forward to trying other items from apu's kitchen!

Either you would like it, or you won't. My mother doesn't, for one. She finds most of the food to be too oily for her taste. However, I sort of like their rolls, especially the double chicken roll. They also make decent fried rice - my weakness, but the chilli chicken chicken in hot garlic sauce contains way too much oil for my liking. There is no sitting and eating facility - this place is a takeaway, and they deliver, albeit not on time.

This is the new kid on the block in the Phoolbagan/Kankurgachi neighbourhood ! If you are looking for a Dine in restaurant with Bar facilities, this isn't the place for you. Alternatively, if you are a foodie like me which most people in Kolkata are, and seriously appreciate good food even if its standing and eating at the counter provided its hygiene friendly, DO NOT miss this place. For it has mouthwatering biriyani, juicy kebabs, amazing north indian delicacies (special mention: Chicken Bharta), and last but certainly not the least good chinese dishes (Schezwan & Chilli Chicken) ! If take out is on your to-do list pretty often, stop by this place and order any of the above or try something new! Coming to the pricing, its totally affordable.¬†Just remember their mantra is- Come to us for Quality, not Quantity!¬†

I would give 3.5/5 to it! ( 1.5 point reserved for dine in area & bar facility).¬†
Happy Eating!
