The quantity they offer is decent in regard with what price we pay. That taste is also altogether good but not so great. I've had Chinese sizzler the last time I went there and it tasted okayish.

Located in the food court of Avani Riverside mall, this place is one of the best options for vegetarians.
The Sizzlers are amazing.
I've tried all the veg Sizzlers and Chinese sizzler is my all time favourite.
It is also very pocket friendly since two people can fill their stomach easily in an approx of Rs. 300.
The staff is also good.
Service is good except on weekends where it might take you upto 20 minutes to receive your order.
