It is one of the most popular places in South Calcutta. It's situated at a prime location firstly. And as far as Indian cuisine is considered, they offer you one of the best. I have tasted their dahi mutton, chicken bharta and paneer butter masala. All the three items were properly cooked and tasty. You can't even leave the gravy unattended. 
The decor is not so superior, service is quite average. Still, I am giving it 4 as the food deserves it.
Thank you.

So on my parents anniversary we decided to get a take-away from this place. We wanted to have Chinese on that day so we ordered 

Chilli garlic noodles - Horrible would be the first thing that comes into your mind after consuming it. The noodles were burnt . Too much garlic spoilt the taste. We couldn't even consume a single spoon. 

Chicken fried rice - This was edible , yes just edible. I can get better fried rice in roadside shacks for sure. 

Manchurian fish - The fish was stale , bad odour was coming out of it. We had to throw it away. 

Chilly chicken - Have you ever heard about chilly chicken being extremely sweet ? Yes that's what they make. 

This was my very favourite joint when I was in school. I don't know what went wrong. Never going again.

Have been here many a times not recently though.The place used to be pretty crowded most of the times.The family and A/C section was not really upto the mark in terms of service staff,ambience and cutlery(not in the same order).Food taste and price was very average.

First of all the name of the restaurant is "BALLYGUNGE DHABA" and not the DHABA, secondly the quality has deteriorated like hell. Since it was even time we ordered a plate of chicken tandoori, and to my utter surprise the item was too dry. Somehow we managed to have it.

I do not know about its glorious past...but currently it's not worth a visit....coming straight to point now. We ordered tandoori chicken....it was burned, very chewy and sort of dry...very average. Then we ordered chicken tikka butter masala with naan. Now here's the surprise...the dish is not what it says it is...there was no chicken tikka in it(the clunks of chicken marinated in red sauce and cooked in tandoor)...it was small pieces of normal chicken and the gravy was far from having any sought of butter in it...I was very dissatisfied with it and complained to the waiter to which he replied, "yhaa ka chicken tikka aisehi bnta hai me kuch nhi krr skta". It wasn't as if watever dish they did serve was good....it was mediocre at best...my mother makes better chicken!
My father ordered mutton keema, they ended up serving chicken keema, didn't complain on that but again the dish itself was mediocre again and very oily. We had to take a extra plate to put the oil in it! In all I won't recommend it to anyone

Horrible experience!!! It was a special day for all of us which was partially ruined by this joint. We had a selected menu and we had specific reason for that on this day. While placing the order i was very much specific that if they dont have any of these, they should tell us. But they took the order. After serving the starter the waiter informed us they cant serve malai kofta and chicken butter masala as they have exhausted the same. Upon complaining to the manager, his exact words were "Dhaba mein aisa hi hota hai... Khana hai to khaiye nehi to hum kuch nehi kar sakte". In other words "this is what happens over here, if u wanna eat then eat or else we can't help u". Thanks guys for partially ruining the night.
The saving grace was KWALITY which is just opposite to this. Price is similar in both place, but quality ambiance and service wise its hell(Dhaba) and heaven(KWALITY) difference.
Now coming to food chicken tikka kabab was hard and stale. Paneer tandoori kabab was ok.
Not: Please dont go if you wanna have good food with peace of mind.

The place is located in ballygunge phari crossing. It has two floors the ground floor being non a.c. and the first floor having a.c. accommodations. I went there on saptami with my father to have lunch after pandal hopping. As it was pujas we opted for the non a.c. seating as it would be faster. We ordered butter naan, chicken Reshma butter masala and chicken tikka kebab. The kebab was succulent and was perfectly cooked. The Reshma butter masala was also good in taste and so was the butter naan which was extremely soft. All in all it was a good place to have your food.
Food 4/5
Service 4/5
A good place to have a casual lunch or dinner and satisfy your tummy particular if you want to have mughlai food and have a small budget

Oh ZOMATO.
Please update the informations of the restaurants properly.Informations shown here misleads us to a huge extent.
Reason behind this request of mine is that,the name of the restaurant is changed.New name is 'BALLYGUNJE DHABA'.
And with the change of the name,the quality of the food here has changed like hell.No more nostalgic.
My orders were Chicken Tanduri,Amritsari chicken kebab,masala kulcha and mutton dopiaza.
Tanduri and the kebab was really soft and tender.But somehow it lacked the charm.The old taste is gone,not a pinch left.The masala of the kebabs were tasteless.Trust me,just tasteless.Chutney was good though.
Then came the nightmare,the masala kulcha and the mutton dopiaza.oh god those were sour and not at all edible.I didnt complained them only because i was so so so much heartbroken,i just wanted to leave.
The mutton pieces were bony,and the masala in the kulcha was nothing but rotten and sour Aaloos.Mutton gravy was sour too.And i couldnot complete the dinner.
The old dhaba is just no more.

The Dhaba is located at the heart of ballygunge phari. I went to that place with my best friend more than 1 year ago during the durga pujas. We tried crispy chili babycorn, 2 plate chicken biriyani and kulfi.

Crispy chili babycorn- this was the only thing that we both liked. It was crispy and the taste was good.

Chicken biriyani- it was way too oily and the chicken piece was way too dry. Both of us also felt that the quantity of the rice could have been a bit more.

Kulfi- the worst part or worst decision to put an end to our meal. The kulfi was rock hard. I was finding it difficult to cut the kulfi with the spoon. 

Overall the experience was not good. Dont know whether it was during the durga puja eve but i hope to uplift their quality and quantity.

It was a huge good news for people when this legendary outlet reopened. Since my college and home both are near to this place I have been coming here since childhood. They have the air conditioned space upstairs and the ground floor is non AC. I never had Chinese here as it is Dhaba. I had ordered many dishes over these years but I would comment on the ones I recently had. 
On my last visit my friends and I ordered double chicken roll (huge quantity of chicken stuffed in the roll which is a speciality of Dhaba rolls but the taste is not that brilliant), egg chicken roll (again a filling one which do not tickle your taste buds much), tandoori roti (usual in size), chicken bharta (not spicy, normal quantity) and chicken boti butter masala (6 not too large chicken pieces, medium spicy, red gravy made with capsicum and onions). The quantity is not huge and the quality is also descent. 
*Since they just reopened, the air conditioned sitting area is closed temporarily.

Sad to know that this legedary place is shutting down. When there was nothing great around to eat...there was The Dhaba....famously known as ballygunj dhaba since it is located at ballygunj phari and so cannot be missed by any one. The place serves tasty kebabs....n north Indian delicacies; butter nan and chicken bharta to name a few. The decor and ambience is very ordinary....and it is compensated by good quality food at a reasonable price.

My earliest memories are associated with this restaurant. The owner used to take me up in his arms when I was a kid and give me a tour of the kitchen. The biryani, vegetable do piaza, boti kabab, chicken bharta, reshmi butter masala and the humongous chicken rolls are still unbeatable tastes. The restaurant remains my favourite.

Probably you are not a foodie from Kolkata if you haven't been to "The Dhaba".

Located extremely conveniently at Ballygunge Phari, it's hard to miss the place. The ground floor is non-ac while the 1st floor is air conditioned.

Basic, simple interior. The Kolkata heat might force you to sit upstairs, otherwise you can settle for the ground floor.

Food: Please do not miss their Mixed Vegetable, no matter how much you love your non-veg dishes. Also, try their variety of Tarkas with Rumali Roti.

I like the tandoori items too. And ofcourse, the special lassi. Thank me later for the suggestion :)

#Location
At Ballygunge Phari More, opposite chinese pavilion. 

#Reason For Visit
**Cheap Prices
**Awesome North Indian Delicacies
**Firni
**Great Location

#Must Try:
**Tarka fry
**Mutton Tarka
**Palak Paneer
**Tandoori Paneer
**Chicken Sag
**Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala
**Firni - order beforehand

#Must Avoid:
**Biryani
**Lassi

#Decor: 
While the ambiance is welcoming the decor has nothing significant. The restaurant are is big and have chairs and tables mundanely placed in lines. Well,one doesn't go here for the ambiance, its the food that thy excel in.

#Service: 
Service generally takes time, especially if one doesn't order the run-of-the-mill, in other words 'popular items' from the menu. Staff are sometimes rude. 

The Dhaba has been one of my family's favorite for years, we have spent many a winter dinners at this North Indian Food Joint. 
The dhaba is a two story restaurant with take away in the lower floor and restaurant sitting area on the upper. I love their palak paneer and sag chicken - The veggie meets chicken/paneer dishes are really their fortes. Lots of sag and some succulent chicken and tandoori roti is a mind blowing combination. Palak Paneer is mind-blowing, and is one of their popular choices. Another one of my regular orders are Tarka in numerous varieties- simple tarka, chicken tarka, muttom tarka, etc. Their tarkas are plain delicious!! Whenever I visit this place, I always end with firni. Warning - the firni gets over very soon so order beforehand(the moment you enter the restaurant). While they are extremely good with Punjabi dishes, they are bad when it comes to biryani. Like most 'Biryani Premik' bengali's i have had their biryanis a few times and in different varieties, and consistently they were a let down.
The Dhaba has been the love of kolkatans for years, long before the influx of restaurants at every nook and corner of the city, and they have retained their position.

**Location**
Near Ballygauge Phari this is easy to locate.

**Experience**
I have been here numerous times and quite like them because of good food with right pricing. The tandoori items are totally yummy and you got to try the kadai chicken and rotis as well. Pure ghee is used in their items which is a plus and always serving tasty food as well.
Staffs are quite friendly and quick with the service as well. :)

It's one of my favorite dhabas since forever. I never manage to take photograph of the dishes for the food is so delicious I start gorging like a starved dog moment I set my eyes on it. This time I ordered chicken reshmi kebab, peas pulao and chicken butter masala. They make the kebabs exactly as I love, a little charred so that the burnt pieces taste extra spicy. The pulao and the butter masala however was just about ordinary. The mango Lassi however was quite bad and smelling of artificial Mango flavoring.

There are two dining halls available, ac and non-ac. ac is upstairs.we opted for non-ac.The place is not properly maintained and looks shabby.The staff do not look well trained.We ordered for chicken tikka kassa and tandoor rotis. They served it really quick. But they had poured(not sprinkled) lemon into the chicken main dish which made the taste pathetic. The only think good about this restaurant was that the prices were inclusive of tax.

Located at Ballygunge Phari, this place has been quite popular among the locals and especially to the young lads for their sumptuous meals at pocket friendly prices. Known for serving Dhaba style foods, I have had Chicken Rolls from here twice. I simply love their Parathas which they use to serve for Roll. Certainly at par with names like Aahar in Salt Lake or even Jabbr Afghani, I could hardly care about the filling inside. Its another story, that their rolls are huge and can be quite a struggle for someone to finish it on his/her own!

My second home :D . The Dhaba has been a quintessential part of growing up in Ballygunge and it never fails to impress. The Rolls are made to perfection , with just the right blend of meat and other ingredients. That apart , they have a wide and varied menu ranging from staple Tandoori fare to the refreshingly delicious Chinese. The Chicken Tandoori here is by far the best I've sampled in this city - cooked to perfection with a smoky taste , with definitely get your taste buds going. Almost every dish here is value for money. I recommend this to everyone looking for a sumptuous Tandoori meal ! :)

They have seating arrangements in ground floor (non AC) and upstairs with AC...
Interiors and outlook nothing special to get a mention...
Back in 2003-04 it was our paradise and equivalent to a 5star resto...
Though by the time they have lost their standard...
Now they have come up with a new outlet in Jadavpur...
This is the first place where we have tasted Sarson Da Saag and Makki Di Roti in their winter special menu...

It's been around for ever. The first dhaba on Kolkata to make it big as a restaurant. If you are going to get yourself Chinese here you are setting yourself up for disappointment. Instead gorge on the rolls , the buttery soft nuns , the chicken bharta which comes with a boiled egg sliced in two and some keema mutter .

Considering it as a non-ac restaurant and the ambience the price is a bit on the higher side. But the taste of the food was good. Although the masala kulcha they served can be better termed as a paratha, but the side dishes was just awesome. So if you are out here do not ever try to try their breads but otherwise their side dishes are something you might want to give a try when you are around.

The place is decent, with decent food. Not very good. The price is alright, but I think I know places in this city that serve better food at those rates or even lower. Their rolls are really nice. They use very good quality milk for the panjabi tea. I didn't like the chicken lollipops though...in fact what came by the name of chicken lollipops weren't so at all. and whatever came was a bit dry and over-fried.

Whether you are looking for a quick bite on a hearty roll or a lavish North Indian Spread, The Dhaba can offer you both. It also has a fare share of Indo-Chinese food to offer. The Fried rice and chilli chicken being the obvious popular choices. 

The food is palatable and is good enough to satisfy your binge eating phase, when you want to eat a lot, yet watch the pocket as well. The biriyani here is moist with healthy a portion of Ghee swaying at the bottom of the container. The kebabs, especially the reshmi chicken kebab and the tandoori chicken are soft, well spiced and own balanced flavors. 

Never have I sat and enjoyed the food in the premises, take away has always been the preferred choice. The service is extremely fast, though you will find people pouring at the billing counter at all times.

The Dhaba is a great option if you are craving for some "Dhaba Style" food.

There should be like two different reviews for this place. Two floors, two menus, two price tags, two type of crowds going in too. Sat upstairs, which is good. Crowd it draws is good too. Really nice North Indian. Its like that place where you go to eat om Sundays with family. Expect nothing cool in here, its a family restaurant

A common eatery place at Ballygunge phaari. The quality of the food is quite well seasoned but it declines sharply during festival time maybe due to huge rush. The quantity of gravy dishes deteriorate as well. Service is really annoying sometimes. Appearance and ambience well checked. Hand wash area and washroom could have been in better condition as it is located where food preparation and cooking is going on.

Just another of that ordinary restaurant along the roadside having a perfect location. Food is pretty ordinary and does not have any of that special flavour. I would personally suggest not to visit this restaurant expecting any delicious punjabi flavour.

The Dhaba, located in Ballygunge Phari, is probably the closest restaurant from my place. There are two floors- the ground floor being non-ac but upstairs they have AC (prices are more upstairs).. To begin with, their biryani and Chinese dishes are not very good.. I generally stick to their north Indian fare.. They make good kebabs, the tandoori chicken is excellent.. There is a roll counter serving a variety of paratha and roomali roti rolls.. the rolls are priced at a little higher side but it is totally worth it keeping in mind the quality as well as quantity of chicken or mutton.

Located off Ballygunge Phari, The Dhaba is the ideal place for a localite like me to grab a pocket friendly dinner on the go. The classic Tadka&Nan/Romali Roti are soothing to the buds ,just like the Biriyani. Food takes some time to come, that being the only negative thing about this place.

Decent ambience and service is quick amidst the rush! Looking forward to pack some for my mom as its been s long time I have used this as a favourite takeaway joint.
P.S: Thought of writing this review coz found a single pic on my old phone.

I've been seeing this place since childhood. They make good taraka and chicken bharta. The only problem with this place is even if asked to they don't put less oil in their food. The rotis are also not great. A little effort here and there would do good. The biggest advantage is the location of this place!

I have been a regular at this place for the last 23 years or so, since I was a child and used to go there with my kid sister, parents & other family members. We have even had birthday celebrations on the rooftop area(it is closed now). So, naturally, I have a soft spot for the place.
Back then, the food was excellent & the quantities huge. For taking home, food were packed in earthenware.
The whole ambiance of the Phari area has changed now, with pulling down of old bungalows and all. 
However, The Dhaba has managed to hold onto its quality, specially, the second level seating area. Ambiance is good & clean (though not fine dining standards). The butter naans, alu parathas(baked not fried), the kebabs, chicken bharta, chicken amritsari butter masala, tandoori chicken, tarka fry, dahi chicken, firni, kulfi with faluda etc to name some, are all very delicious. Their rolls are great too(try the veg one). Incidentally, I also like their chicken cantonese chowmein, 
The staff have become well known over the years & service is nice.
Their kitchen is clean & we have never had any unpleasant experiences.
However, they used to use good mustard oil for cooking earlier & now I am not so sure.
Overall, 4 points from me.

This is one place that you need no navigation to locate! It's situated exactly on the road,right beside the Ballygunge phaari petrol pump! Need I review much about a place as popular as this? Well, it's a very well known eating place for most of the people in South kolkata! And at one point of time it was considered to be one of the most reputed eateries of all times! Coming to the food part, the North Indian cuisine here is standard. I had come here a couple of times and in my opinion, the hit list includes biryani, the chicken reshmi butter masala, the chicken boti kebab, the prawn tandoor butter masala (tastes better if it is consumed with any Indian rice preparation, preferably a scented pulao) etc! Actually this is one of those restaurants that has got a good preparation standard for all kinds of food that is available in the menu card! This place has been maintaining a consistent taste ever since I have been visiting it. So if you're looking for a casual lunch or dinner for no real occasion, just for the sake of good reasonable food, welcome to The Dhaba!

The Dhaba,written in a red and white glow sign no one can miss it while crossing ballygunge phari
I have gone there so many times that i have lost count..
Food you should try
Mutton biriyani (2 mutton pieces) but less rice,
Chicken Bharta, Egg chicken roll,tandoori and kebabs in curry
Chinese is also good but dosent match the levels of punjabi or muglai food.Overall its great!!!
Tip: if you are on a tight budget dont go upstairs,but its more quite and private.

This is one of the Kolkata's heritage restuarent. I have visited here a number of times as this one place is close to our family's heart. Lots of memories and accomplishments has been celebrated here.

And what is our favourite here you won't guess it:

All types of tarka......naan complements it best.
We also prefer their fries - chicken or mutton. If you want something good in main course don't frg8 to try their chicken dopiyaza. Awesome!!! 

Restuarent has two parts, family and general. As you may have guessed general one is cheaper.....

"CHICKEN TANDOORI"
The non_ac section is as good as the other.
People walk in to eat. So no point expecting tranquility there. 
usually order: ch.tandoori, ch.biriyani, paneer polau, chicken boti butter masala and fruit salad with ice-cream.

Also liked pan-fried momos. Share two plates of this amongst three...on a low budget day.

4.0 for the good taste, fast service, good location, moderate pricing.

Good place for lunch with old friends...'cause you'll talk more and bother less about the decor.

I have been a fan of this Punjabi food joint from my college days. They make extremely good food and if you are sitting on their ground floor it is not a pinch on your pocket. The mutton biryani and chicken chaap are very well made - different taste from mughlaai joints in the city. The chicken bharta, mutton fry, chicken do piyaza or the chicken reshmi masala are my favourites. The roll section is also good- fish tandoori roll being my favourite. I tried their chinese as well - which are average given the fact you don't want to taste chinese at a punjabi food joint when you have plenty of other options.

This place has served generations of gastromaniacs in the city and stands beside the ballygunje phari crossing..though the food had deterioted over the years it still remains a pocket friendly choice..i never had chinese here which they had introduced..the chicken gravy noodles was not upto the mark and i was left for more..the garlic prawns was good but too sweet to be desirably palatable..others in my gang ordered butter naan and chicken bharta..they didn complain much..they have introduced their winter special menu comprising makai di roti and sarson da saag..will try if i visit again sometime..overall a good place to have buddy conversations without burning ur pocket..

The food wasn't good at all. The restaurant was empty giving me a clear picture of how the food will be. Navratan Korma was tasteless and so were the kulchas. Utterly disgusted with the quality. The only solace was that the service was satisfactory. Would not like to visit the place ever again.

One of my favourites. Good quality food at affordable rates. Located just a ballygunge phari, it's very easy to find. The service is good and food is delicious. The punjabi fare. Haven't tried their Chinese. My friends and I just love going there.

Revisiting a favorite food joint of childhood after many years is always nostalgic....as well as nerve wrecking.... 'Is the food still good?', 'Is the new staff courteous?', 'Will my happy memories go downhill?', or 'Will I still be able to recommend it to people?'. All these thoughts swirled in my mind as I entered the place again with mom and dad. However I was welcomed by some pleasant changes. The decor in the AC floor is elegant, staff is helpful, swift service and reasonable prices. About the food.... when I think of Punjabi cuisine, I think of my trip to Chandigarh. The various roadside dhabas can give you the best of Punjabi delicacies, and it's difficult to live up to those standards elsewhere. However, The Dhaba certainly doesn't disappoint. It was a cold December night, so what better that Makke di roti, sarson the saag, fish tikka and mutton kassa! Each and every item was heavenly...the fish tikka just melts in your mouth. The aroma and flavors of the mutton kassa leaves you wanting more. The roti and saag needs special mention....fresh, flavorsome and fantastic is what you can describe them as. The Dhaba serves in generous portions so you would definitely leave full. We ended our meal with fruit custard and pista badam icecream, and it was all below 1200 bucks!
I can safely say this new upgraded memory of The Dhaba will be running my thoughts for quite some time. So, if anyone wishes to experience excellent Punjabi food, you know where to go

This is a place which makes me nostalgic about the occasional family dine outs during my school days. 

Over the years,  visit to this place has reduced but whenever I go back,  this joint never disappoints me. 

The taste is awesome.  We ordered for my all time fav keema paratha.  Same old yum taste.  To accompany this,  we asked for chicken Reshmi butter masala,  boneless  mutton taka and kadhai chicken.  Generally I do not like tadka from all places  but this dish in dhaba has totally won me over.  

Overall experience is wonderful and soothing.

Went to The Dhaba on Sunday as 6 ballygung was under renovation. It was a very good experience.  Food was amazing...We had ordered fish curry and dal makahni. . In terms of taste it was one of top 5 dal I would have had ever .. and fish was amazing too. Though the seating is not that great...taste covers up for everything.  For a foodie. No brainer. .will go visit next time I am in kol.

Located well on the main road of Ballygunj, I decided to hop into this restaurant as I was longing for dhaba food since months. We ordered Butter Nan, chicken tikka masala, salad, chicken butter masala, dal makhni and egg tarka. We asked for baigan bharta but it wasnt there despite it being highlighted in the special items on each table.The tarka and Nan were good but the tikka masala had no tikka in it. All we found were boiled bland chicken pieces (like in plain chicken curry at roadside shops). It was highly disappointing. Chicken butter masala was mediocre. I DID NOT GET ANY REAL DHABA FEEL IN THEIR FOOD. Moreover, the staff didn't even bother listening to our queries and remarks. I would never visit this place again.

One get both types of feel in this single outlet. The ground floor is a typical dhaba style arrangement while the AC first floor is more fine of fine dining look with tables laid out, etc. I have experienced both the areas and both have met my expectations in terms of service of different genres. Although, I guess the food is common to both the areas. Foods are really tasty here be it dhaba style tarka and romali roti or fast foods like rolls and kababs or speciality dishes like mutton tikka butter masala or liver kassa. Pricing is cheap and service is quite fast. However, I have not yet shown any interest in trying the Chinese over here.

Kolkata..Love you..I am visiting Kolkata and one of friends took me to this place. USP: location. My friend who has visited this place multiple time and had shared good feedback for it's Punjabi food. But after this visit, he said it was it's last. Reason been NO taste whatsoever in any of the food items that we ordered. I would have given ZERO but ONE is ONLY for Gour Baidya's service, he is a live wire. Thank you Mr. Gour. I won't recommend this place to eat (Pic has a red for that reason itself).

This place is good if you wish to grab a quick bite. (We sat in the ground-floor non-ac) Food was satisfactory, nothing as great. But the only problem was the service, the waiter took our order but forgot one dish from that so that was a harassment for both the party. Nothing to talk about the ambience in ground floor, but previously I have been to the AC section and its good, considering a dineout. Just that you can not consider it to be the place for a dinner date ;)

Butter nan, mutton do piyaza, chkn bharta & daal makhni. Except nan nothing was tasty. Will definitely not recommend this to anyone. Dhabas are supposed to hv intense flavours which this place surely lacka.

The Dhaba with it's main branch in Ballygunge and another in Baghajatin is a popular dine out place for food lovers. The food here is savory and well filling given the quantity of each dish is of huge proportions. It is aptly priced given the quantity of food. The USP as one can point out is the touch of Punjabi cuisine in almost all their preparations be it their chicken tadka or matar mushroom or chicken butter masala. The food is delicious and worth the visit.
Ps: They have roti rolls for those concerned about their weight yet cannot give up their love for rolls.

I have been visiting this place very frequently since past few years. A warm,homely environment with friendly people to cater to your needs are available. I simply love their chicken noodles. Other favourites being their chicken bharta,biryani,chicken butter masala and achaari chicken. Their sweet lime soda is the best i think. Food rates slightly on the higher edge but one cannot complain of their quality and quantity!

This place brings back so many memories. I've been going here since I was a little kid. There used to be a queue to get a table in this restaurant back then but that charm is no longer there now it seems. 
I have tasted almost all the stuff in the menu, 
The chicken bharta  and naan is sumptuous.  The staff is courteous and always give good suggestions. 
I make it a point to have tutti fruity whenever i go there as it brings back all the childhood memories of this place.

So, today went to dhaba to try some veg item. Although, we have been to dhaba many times earlier but never tasted their veg item. As today is saturday, I don't eat non-veg. So, I decided to give a try to the veg items of dhaba. I parceled 2 veg pulao and paneer butter masala. At first after opening the pulao, I was not sure about it but it tasted really good with plenty of peas, carrot, beans & small pieces of potatoes (yes, POTATOES) in it. It was little bit different from other pulaos, I would give 3.5/5. I was disappointed with the paneer item. I am not a paneer lover, but I found it tasteless due to lack of spices, it was little bit stale. For paneer 2.5/5. I would recommend to go for the non veg items which are really good rather than the veg items.

As usual like every SOSHTHI(DURGA PUJA), we had a date with this place. When u come to this place u will be served very fast, their service is really quick. We ordered:
Butter naan- Good but it is little bit on the thicker side, I like it thin & crispy
Chicken Bharta- Deliciousssssss.. Rich and creamy
Keema matar- just awesome... We just loved it..
Mutton Do Piyaza- a complete disaster.. Once it used to be our fav dish here, we used to order this every time.. But it was the last time I ordered this.. So a complete no-no..
& Finally Kesar pista ice cream- yuuuummmmmmmyyyyy... 3 scoops of delight to enjoy...
Price is reasonable & they provide ample quantity..

A favourite place for North Indian cuisine eversince I was a kid. Visited on last Sunday for dinner with friends. Orders were:
1. Chicken Reshmi Kebabs ( 4 plates )
2. Paneer Tikka ( 1 plate)
3. Chicken Egg Tadka
4. Mutton Rogan Josh
5. Chicken Bharta
6. Tandoori Rotis
7. Curd
8. Green Salad. 
All were lipsmacking. Mutton Roganjosh was tasty but too oily. So avoid that if you don't like it that way.

It is a very short review based on my long time back experience with this restaurant.It is situated exactly at Ballygunge Phari crossing. If you are going towards Park Circus from Gariahat, then it will be on your right hand side, just beside the road going towards Ballygunge Science College.

I tried their chicken roll. It was costlier than other places. Also, I did not enjoy it. So, the overall experience was very average kind.

This used to be one of my favourite food joints...however recently i found out that the quality of the food has deteriorated. So i will directly come to the food..
1. Chicken/ mutton biryani- the biryani is delicious...the chicken/ mutton was perfectly cooked and very soft. However they have reduced the quantity...which i did not like at all...
2. Chicken reshmi butter masala- the chicken was perfectly cooked..the curry was very nice...it was a bit spicy but overall very good.
3. Chicken tikka butter masala- i was highly dissapointed with this dish. It was too oily. The chicken was quite chewy.
4. Tandoori roti- perfect, not at all chewy and of perfect size.
5. Crispy chilli babycorn- i love this dish. Considering that this place is famous for north indian cuisine, i was pleasantly surprised by this dish. The baby corn is crispy, spicy, crunchy,just the way i love them.
.6 Chicken/ mutton roll- this place serves the best roll i have ever tasted. The chicken stuffing is perfect. I simply love this dish.
The joint has two sections. Air conditioned where the tax is applicable and the non ac section is tax inclusive. The staff is prompt and very friendly. Its worth your money.

After wonderful reviews from family and friends, i finally visited this place on a humid saturday afternoon. The Dhaba is located at the Ballygunge Phari crossing right opposite Chinese Pavillion and 2mins from Science college(which happens to be my college). It has a non ac section at the ground floor serving rolls and fast food, and a proper ac one at the 1st floor. Difficult to gauge from outside that the restaurant is actually very spacious. With average decor and no music, it was left to the food to bring a smile on our faces. We ordered mutton biriyani, chicken boti masala and tandoori roti. The Biriyani was nice with the mutton properly cooked but the chicken was lip smacking. Pricing is average. Overall the experience was satisfactory. Do give it a try.

My verict - give it a try for stuffed rolls

The Dhaba is located right at the Ballygunge Phari crossing and falls on the left if you are coming from the Circular Road. The place is just like any other Dhaba in the area and there's nothing too special about the interiors or the food but the rolls are quite good here. I'd rate this a bit better than the other two on the Circular Road.

The service is same as any other place of this style and food is average but good compared to others in the area.

The Dhaba,as the name suggests is one of the oldest punjabi food restaurant in Kolkata. They serve rolls and stuff as street food and also have a proper seating arrangement on the first floor. They have some of the best North Indian curries and breads if you are looking for a decent meal without spending too much.

This place used to be one of my favourites but over the time the quality of the food and the service have deteriorated. While the tandoori chicken and the kebab taste good, the quality of other items need to be enhanced. The place requires an overhaul. The decoration needs to be changed and better sitting arrangements must be installed. However, its a pocket friendly restaurant which allows one to have many dishes at a low budget.

Located so near to my place, but I've never dined in The Dhaba. Every time, I've had food delivered to my place.

I've had so many of their dishes! While some were brilliant, some were quite bland.

The one item I absolutely love is their Chicken Tandoori. A full chicken, well marinated, well seasoned, and succulent  just at Rs. 300! What can be more delightful than this? It's excellent.

Then comes their Chicken Biriyani. Good. But not the best in Kolkata.

Their other chicken dishes like Chicken Bharta, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala are good too. Perhaps their cooks can't go wring with North Indian dishes.
Their Egg Tadka wasn't good. It was dry. I don't like their Kulcha either.

An advise: don't go for their Chinese dishes. The cooks can't prepare Chinese items. I've had a terrible experience with their noodles, fried rice, and chilli chicken.

For reasonably priced North Indian food, this place is definitely one of the best in Ballygunge area.

Dhaba..Dhaba...Dhaba... Being  a northie one is easily exposed to an amalgamation of flavors that does provide variety to ones platter. Predominantly punjabi food is much favored by regular diners here. Albeit the place  has generous choices of Chinese food but those are mostly overlooked. The bread collection is a must try. Order a bread basket and let your taste buds do the judging. Going well with this would be my personal favourite - chicken butter Masala and reshmi kebab. Most meat livers would like the Mutton listing but be sure to ask for generous slices or you'll end up with a bone with hardly any meat on it. They sell quick. If you are on the way to some place it would be a good idea to stock up on the rolls offered here but beware of the overwhelming cholesterol levels. Once in a blue moon this is fine. Oh and don't forget, no matter what you eat- do try and relish their "kesar firni"

Dhaba..Dhaba...Dhaba... Being  a northie one is easily exposed to an amalgamation of flavors that does provide variety to ones platter. Predominantly punjabi food is much favored by regular diners here. Albeit the place  has generous choices of Chinese food but those are mostly overlooked. The bread collection is a must try. Order a bread basket and let your taste buds do the judging. Going well with this would be my personal favourite - chicken butter Masala and reshmi kebab. Most meat livers would like the Mutton listing but be sure to ask for generous slices or you'll end up with a bone with hardly any meat on it. They sell quick. If you are on the way to some place it would be a good idea to stock up on the rolls offered here but beware of the overwhelming cholesterol levels. Once in a blue moon this is fine. Oh and don't forget, no matter what you eat- do try and relish their "kesar firni"

Would only recommend this place if you are health conscious and want to eat rolls... Since they have special rumali roti rolls(no oil)...
Apart from that, their food is average... The tandoori chicken wasn't cooked enough once

I got to know this place from my dad since its one of my mom dad's favourite places of all times. Dad keeps talking about the sarso da saag and makai roti they had here which was simply amazing.Last time we went for dinner we climbed the stairway and entered the dimly lit ac first floor where we were seated. After a while, we gave the order for butter nan, chicken tandoori, mutton biriyani and chicken reshmi butter masala. When the chicken tandoori came, we were filled with joy as its the best there. The taste is really really good I mean Really good. the nan had enough butter and it went well with the reshmi masala which had a smoky flavour. The mutton biriyani was good too. But we were too full to have any desserts anymore so I missed the firni. The service was prompt and the price is good for the food they serve.

One of the worst eating experience I ever had...today me n my frnd went to dis place to have dinner.. V ordered Chi reshmi butter masala with tandoori roti.. Firstly, Service was too slow. V had to tell them to clean the table.. Secondly, reshmi butter masala was not actually Wat it should have been. Quantity was too less n was full of tomatoes.. It was lyk same gravy is being used for every chicken item.. While paying the bill when v told the waiter about the gravy thing he was totally rude...

One of the oldest dhabas in Calcutta and for a reason. We were seated on the first floor on a Sunday evening. The servers like in any dhaba were laid back but at the same time doing what they had to. We ordered for dal tadka, paneer butter masala and an assortments of breads. Everything tasted delicious. Prices are reasonable. A place worth visiting though at times parking may be a problem.

The dhaba..name is tantalising enough to magnetically pull me in..

Ok first things first..the ambience is very good..total family restaurant..it has two sections - lower (non a.c.) part and upper (a.c.) part..

The waiters are very decent snd seemed to be working here for quite a long time..problem is they behave good but they attend less or rather they have some priority issues..like you can arrive before some other people there but that doesn't guarantee you to be attended first..

They provide free chilled water for drinking..pro point
But refill can be tough issue..con point

Food is good..price is fair..or maybe slightly high..slightly..

Quantity is just ok for the price..
Quality can be a topic of debate..

I liked the taste of the food but none of my associate liked it..hence I have to pay all of their bill just for coming here..

Note: you can try once coming here..your experience can be different..

I have been going to The Dhaba since I can remember....a place that is meant for carnivores abs if you want to have soul food. Over the years theybhave expanded their menu and incorporated biryanis and also chinese cuisine just like all the other places. But they rock and rule with the Punjabi cuisine that they had set up the shop with. Their kebabs and meat side dishes are to die for. I go to The Dhaba for just a handful of dishes. On a regular basis I have the double mutton double egg roll. When I feel a lil more than peckish, I munch on their chicken tikka, reshmi and tandoori.....and man when I am with my gang then its only meat. Almost all the kebabs on the menu. Tarka and roomalis. The kebabs are really succulent and feels that they have been marinated perfectly. The tarka is the usual rich, creamy and oily bowl of heaven. the rotis are always hot and fresh and have the typical smokey flavour that goes perfectly with the daal and the kebabs.
Specially during the winters I never miss saag meat and sarso haltingly glad saag with makki ke rotis. A heavenly concoction. In both the cases the saags are cooked to a perfect smooth consistency and spiced to the T. Their karahi chicken is also very good, I must admit.
The service is very prompt and the waiters are helpful and suggest the right combos. @Prithvvi P Choudhurry

It is a little nostalgic for me to visit this place because I used to come to this place when I was young. I visited this place after a very long time. We ordered the amritsari kebab which was very good. We ordered nun which was very hard and chewy and reshmi chicken butter masala which was average. We ordered a kulfi which was fine. Service was good.

I am visting these place almost regularly for past three years. Eating here evryday while returning from university. So almost all the dishes i have gone through and none of them ever have disheartend me. Its placed at the heart of ballygunge phari specifically at the corner of ballygunge circular road.
This eatery has got one non AC and one AC section with decent sitting arrangement. And all the stuff are very good and polite.
They serve both chinese and indian with good proportion with respect to the price. Rather according to the food quality i would say the price is chep. 
Both cuisin they cook quiet well. The kababs and biriyani are delicious. Al the tandoor items are great. And i must mention their mouthwatering rolls specialy the mutton roll and crispy chili baby corn roll. They also hav rumali roti rolls for the health concious foodies.

A place located at the heart of ballygunj phari which has become name in itself which signifies good food and service by retaining its niche over the passing of years.

Service wise the staff are very prompt and fast and quality as well and quantity of the food is extremely impressive.

We ordered for 1 chicken bharta, 1 chicken tikka butter masal and Butter Naan along with Firni.Coming to the chicken bharta and tikka butter masala the spices were deliciously blended in their signature style ,the quality sufficient and the succulent pieces of chicken had the spices rightfully infused in them which gave each bite a taste to relish bigtime alonside the naan acting as a healthy sidekick.

The Firni was yummylicious to the hilt but had gone a bit too freezed up,as I think it was refrigerated on a tempt. too low,coz Firni's are supposed to be soft as you dig into it,the texture shoudln't be hard.In this case the hard texture signifies over refrigeration....Over a perfect place to have some delicious mughlai cuisine. Also their roll section is bigtime epic.

A definite must visit for mughlai lover....
Pricing is very much justified by the quality and quantity of food alongside the service.

I have ordered quite a number of times from this place as it is very close to my office. The food is pretty average. Certain dishes such as paneer tikka kabab and mutton do piaza are quite good. Not a very nice place to visit as the ambience is poor but if your looking for a convenient place to get a bite then this could be your place.

from the chicken and egg chicken rolls from the snack bar to the north indian and mughlai dishes served there! surprisingly, the chinese is also good! but i will recommed the tandoor items-chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kebabs, chicken boti kebabs, fish tandoori-all are amaizng, soft and cooked with utmost care! the tandori rotis, butter nans, tarka, mutton tikka masala, chicken tikka masala, both chicken and mutton biriyani, polao, navarantan korma, sarso da saag all are tempting!! the list endless! the ambience also is quite good! :) pocket friendly place!

Same old nostalgia. 11 yrs back, I ate this place with my mom. And the taste of the mutton do piyaja still lingers in my tastebuds. So when my mom requested me to have a visit there again with her, I was delighted. And voila its still the same. We were left licking our fingers. The waiters are friendly, the food is from out of this world, the place is a bit clumsy but you do have a well decorated seating arrangement in the first floor. For what one can complain of?

Very known and very old horse, still running with full power. Still one of the best dhaba style eatery in the heart of the city, as it was 40 years back.
Went for a quick luncheon. Found they were serving winter special dhaba foods which includes makki da roti, sarsoon da saag and some other stuffs. Could'nt resist out taste buds and we went for these specialities along with keema tarka!
Makki da roti was pretty soft and one is quite sufficient for one. Sarsoon da saag and keema tarka were both lipsmacking. Liked them a lot, and if we would have more time then we could cater some more dishes. Lets keep the hunger alive for next time!

No frills dining space, but amazing food. The roll is just different from anything I have had. May be Campari (on Gariahat) comes close. Now I must also mention that it is a little pricey but definitely worth the price. The tandoori is pretty sick too. They do have some awesome Tandoori chicken as well.

The Dhaba is located at Ballygunge Phari. It offers some great mughlai dishes. Chinese items r average. Ambience is quite good but is not extraordinary. Price is reasonable enough.... quite pocket friendly.

This is a place I've visited countless times since my childhood and the order has hardly changed- chicken biriyani, butter naan, tandoori chicken, and navratna curry. Food is great, though slightly too spicy. Kebabs and tandoori items are easily the best.

The food was amazing. However the ambiance was pretty sad. You will have to double check the glasses and the plates to make sure its completely clean. But this place can't be ignored cuz the food is not over priced and quality does not suffer.

Hardly had to wait for 15-20 mins before they found us a nice cozy corner for the 5 of us.. We had ordered chicken tandoori, chicken bharta and tandoori roti.. The order came quickly, and we dig in.. The roti was very average, after hardly 5 mins, it became as hard as leather.. The tandoor was excellent though, and the bharta was also nice.. Overall, an average experience..

Whenever I visit this place, it brings back all the childhood fond memories to me. This restaurant is on the main crossing of Ballygunge Phari. While going towards park circus it falls on the right hand side. The ambiance of this place keeps changing due to the type of crowd comes in. it is a total family restaurant. Bar is not available. It is a 2 stored restaurant with the 1st and the 2nd floor as AC and the ground floor as Non- AC. The sitting arrangements are quite comfortable and spacious. Service was very good. The server was very polite, had a very pleasing attitude, and was quiet prompt. Car parking can be a little problematic.  

After a long time my family and I had our dinner at Dhaba. We had ordered Sweet lassi to drink with Fish Kababs for starters, Mutton Tarka, Chicken Bharta, tandoori roti, rumali roti for the main course. To start with I never had any complain against their food quality as well as their quantity. They were just perfect. The tardka was as usual Superb, chicken bharta was creamy, non spicy with the shredded chicken the taste becomes perfect.
 Any kind of Tardka, be it veg, non veg, egg, chicken or mutton is a must try. 

It doesn’t even pinch your pocket. Very reasonable price.

This was favourite place of my parents and hence I have been visiting this one since childhood days... the best chicken bharta I have ever tasted is from dhaba only. In winter they serve an authentic punjabi sarson da saag and makai da roti.. being pocket friendly their egg tadka and palak paneer are worth a mention. Lassi is pretty good too!

Although it sounds weird but i love the Cola Float at The Dhaba. The food is good and not that costly. But compared to its past it could not cope up with the other new and old restaurants  of south and central Kolkata. The quality has gone down a bit. But still the Rolls and Tadkas are as tasty as ever. Shouldn't  opt chineese  or biriyani here. Cherrish the punjabi menus.

This place brings back so many childhood memories of having delicious chicken tikka rolls and mutton rolls!I completely loved the chicken do-piaza and the chicken bharta. They used to serve great korma and pulao. This was quite a few years back. Recently, when i visited with a friend, i was so disappointed with the service. The service was slow and the staff was unattentive. They even jumbled up our order with another table and served us wrong, which made further delay. The food still tastes good and is quite cheap!

We ordered mutton biriyani, chicken reshmi butter masala, tandoori chickn butter masala, fish tandoori, and fresh lime soda... Lime soda was terrible to drink, got no citrus after taste....  Biriyani was good, though bit oily... Fish tandoori and chicken tandoori butter masala was tolerable... But that butter free reshmi butter masala just ruined the dinner... One thing I want to add that the plates are too small to eat biriyani, when you are serving biriyani on plate only....

This is another childhood favourite.. my family was a regular visitor here as there was no such popular restaurant in the gariahat-ballygunge area... The taste of Tarka still lingers in me.. I had it in any form.. be it veg or egg or chicken or mutton.. the taste was just HEAVENLY!!.. The chicken bharta was good too and so the Chicken tikka onion and reshmi kebabs.. They made very good mutton biryani and chicken chap too.. I have tried almost all the kebabs, the stuffed Nans and the gravy dishes.. Dont really know how is the food now.. but used to savour each and every item when we used to dine in there..miss this restaurant

This place has some fond childhood memories.10-15 years ago there was a dearth of good quality restaurants around gariahat and ballygunge.This joint was a landmark then.On any ocassion we would come to this place or get a home delivery.Its well known for north indian tradional cusine.Probably this is whre i first had chicken tandoori,sarso da  saag and makai ki roti,palak paneer.Apart form these their chicken bharta,tarka(both chicken and egg),parathas of different variety,kebabs and rolls deserves mention.They also serve tasty veg options.

P.S:Quantity is good but quality and service is not like before.

It is tasty , has medium amount of  oil, the quality of food is okay and the staff are really welcoming. 

it has that dhaba feeling in the midst of all the chaos of the traffic. located right at the Ballygunge phari crossing. This place is really good for a quick bite or even if you want a nice meal. i usually pack my stuff because i do not like the so - so clean place. But it is good. i love the roll and the price is okay.

Here I tasted sarson da saag and makki de roti for the first time in my life. I love the biriyanis and keema nun. Though i didnt like their chinese dishes.. For dessert fruit salad with fresh cream or tutti fruity is just perfect. And yes they have very traditional dishes but they are pocket friendly. One visit is recommended.

Located at a very convenient place,in ballygunge phari,this restro serves good indian dishes.The service is very quick and if u r planning to take away,u don't have to even get out of ur car.As soon as u park ur car in front of the restro,a waiter will come to take ur order and within a few minutes ur food will be handed over to u.That's amazing,rite?
Now coming to the ambience,there are 2 sections.In the ground floor,there is the normal seating arrangement which is one section.The other one is on the 1st floor,the air-conditioned section which is just fine,nothing extra-ordinary it.
I have regularly taken egg tarka,chicken bharta,nan,rolls,kashmiri alur dam and they all tasted yum.They make the best tarka. If you insist to cook ur items in less oil,they would totally do that.Prices are affordable.They also serve chinese cuisine,which i did not try all.U can dine in here,or take away ur food.Anyhow u wl enjoy what they have to offer you...thumbs up from me!!!

The first time I had been to this place was way back in early 2010, and the next time I honored the place with my presence was in late 2013. What I found upon my second visit, was the unmistakable contrast in the quality of the same dishes between these two years. What had tasted heavenly and god-like on my maiden visit, was not even taste-worthy now. The place, which used to beam with life once, now bears a desolate appearance. This clearly displays what arrogance and inexorably haughty demeanour can do to a once reputed food outlet at one of the busiest junctions of South Calcutta. Even the behaviour of the staffs does no good in propelling their plummeting prestige; it only adds "insult to injury". Seriously, such a fall is perhaps epic in the history of all the food joints in entire Calcutta.

This place deserves a 4 star because of the taste:cost ratio. There is very few places where you can eat to your hearts full and the bill doesn't cause you the slightest pain. I love the kababs they have, Particularly the amritsari kabab is heavenly. However i would not recommend dine in as the space is cramped and it being located on the crossing of ballygaunge phari means a lot of noise and dust. However they have an option of home delivery so that solves all the problems. If you like dhaba quality food then this is a must visit

The biryanis were better those days now not upto the mark. They have lessen the quantity also though the price is moderate.  The north indian cuisines they provide are better than biryani.The ambience of the restaurant is decent and the service is also good. Hope they would improve their quality of food

Location: Ballygunge Crossing.  

This place has a nice ambiance, ain't anything great but quite simple. 
The place is divided into two sections, of which the ground floor isn't quite upto the mark, but, yes the first floor is suitable for a family dine-in. 

Have visited it a few times, serves an above average quality food. 
This place serves Rolls as well, though am yet to try. 

Talking in short, 
Out of the whole vegetarian range this place has to offer, Tadka Fry, Dal Makhani, Malai Kofta, Vegetable Do Pyaza, Masala Kulcha, Tandoori Paratha are recommended. 
Other dishes seemed to be dangling towards disaster. Try at your own risk.  

The staff doesn't seem to be quite courteous out here simply coz' they are almost no ears to you. 

The prices are pocket friendly.  

An average experience.

A good restaurant situated on Ballygunge phari. There are two sections. Non Ac nd Ac. Service is a bit poor but food compensates for it. Waiters were busy chatting amongst themselves. They came with the menu card after a long wait. But food came faster than expected. as told earlier food is great. I suppose take away is also available. Its crowdy during weekend's.   Must visit if you are near.

Tormented by hunger pangs and you are looking for a guardian angel near Ballynure phari? Try "The Dhaba"! Tired of eating Bengali food at home? Try" The Dhaba " at Ballygunge phari!
Be it the tarka roti or the chicken bharta or traditional winter offerings like Sarson ka saag and makke Di roti from the land of 5 rivers, every item offered in this restaurant is delicious, easy on the pocket and heart-warmingly Good! The service is quick and therefore a saviour in case you reach the restaurant devastated with hunger and craving for something solid to bite!

Of particular recommendation are its rolls that come in many different fillings and are an absolute value for money!
"Balle-Balle" rolls is how they identify their rolls going by the signboard hanging outside the Roll delivery counter. And I certainly couldn't find a better expression than this to eulogize the rolls here. They are an absolute delight, simply because of the quantity of filling inside. Sardars, who are synonymous with Dhabas, are large hearted people and their generous and large heartedness comes out aptly in the rolls that are dished out in this Place-thick and guaranteed to deliver a chunk into the mouth with every bite of the roll. They are not very greasy too and seem light on the oil though it's difficult to know the type of oil used here.
I know that the rolls of this place probably do not require much branding but, as a piece of advise, was wondering if the owners could think of providing a neat and swanky costume to the roll-maker and train him to entertain those in Waiting, just like the teppanyaki chefs do!

This is one of the places which has maintained its standards and affordability through the years. We have visited this place innumerable times and never disappointed. At first parking used to be a problem but not any more as they have now valet parking just in front of the joint. It is perfect for a dine out or for throwing a party (the best thing is you don't have to preset the menu and can actually order on the go... Just make sure you have reservation for the party). Among the food they serve, tandoori chicken remains an all time favourite... 
Note: go for the upstairs ac seating, never tried downstairs...

My first visit to dhaba traces back to my childhood days. Our Sunday lunches were fixed at dhaba with mom and dad. I still remember their navratan korma , butter nun and the tooty fruity ice cream which used to be a regular order for us . And definitely the nonveg items were flawless in taste. My every visit to dhaba is wonderful trip down memory lane. But they should really take care of parking be coz that's the biggest hindrance to dhaba visit

I have lost count how many times I have visited this restaurant.  From the very childhood I have been visiting THE DHABA and find this place quite good for their food quality and service. 
Things I have tried in THE DHABA-
1) Chicken Bharta Boneless
2) Chicken Reshmi butter masala
3) MUtton Do payaza
4) Mutton Rogan josh
5)Kashmiri aludam
6) palak paneer
7)Matter Paneer
8) Butter nan
9) Masala Kulcha
10)Peas Polao 
They serve each and every item very sincerely . The staffs are mostly old peoples. This service used to be really great but on a recent visit I found out that their service quality deteriorated , served us the food 35mins afters taking the order. Coming to the ambiance, the ambiance is not great but its clean and tidy.

This is one of the most popular old timer place. I used to stay in Broad Street, and we used to celebrate all parties in Punjabi Dhaba. I  talking about the parties in 90s...

A very nostalgic place for me. My mom used to parcel their chicken biriyani (used to be Rs.40) , and mix-veg / roomali roti for home. If we are eating there, we used to eat Chicken Tandoori for sure. It used to be awesome.

To bring that memory back, I did visit this place 1 month ago. Nothing has changed. The place / taste remains same. They have closed the roof -top place, which used to be open air. 

The service will be damm quick here. Nothing to complain.

Have   heard   about  The  Dhaba  long  enough   for me to  feel  like  trying  the  food one  Sunday   evening in April as I  was  near Ballygunge Phari. The  place  is  known  for  good  food at  reasonable  rates....on  entering  the  decor  is  not anything  to  talk  about ,  but  that's  okay   as  its  not  a place  promising some  great  ambiance ,  but the  food   I  ordered  weren't  great  either...just  some  average  stuff!
The  paneer  pulao  was  okay...nothing  like the  pulao  we  are  accustomed  to  but then  maybe  it is  the  Punjabi  preparation   which  was  new  to  me. The naan was  good  too  but  the chicken  butter  masala  was  not  up to  the  mask...the  gravy  was quite disappointing kinda  runny  and  lacked  the essence  of  Butter  Masala... 
The  service  was  fine   but  the  prices  seem to  have  increased   from  the  ones  mentioned  in  the menu  available  in  zomato  at  that  time...Over  all  a   very  mediocre  experience ...hopefully  the  next  one  would  be   better! :)

Now this is one restaurant which I have been to maby times in childhood, courtesy of my dad. He loves this place, and definitely has valid reasons to do so. Good food accompanied with great service, that's what one should expect from this place. Yes, the rates are growing higher by the day, and ineterior decoration may take a few points away from the Dhaba, but the food does make up for it. And they cap it off with an excellent presentation of the dessert. The serving may be a bit delayed, however the taste does matter most to a foodie and there they wont be disappointed. Do try out the Amritsari Butter Masala if you are in this place.

I have been dining at The Dhaba since the last 15-20 years usually with my parents. It is one of the oldest restaurant in the city which used to serve delicious North Indian food. It is a major landmark in the Ballygunj Phari area, so finding and reaching the place is not an issue at all.

I visited the restaurant yesterday after a gap of almost 3-4 years for a quick dinner. We reached the place around 10.30 at night. Being a Monday night, we got a table immediately on the 1st floor. We ordered an Egg chicken Tadka Fry(half) , a chicken tikka butter masala, chili fish, a plate of green salad along with Roomali and Tandori Rotis. 
  
The food came in a matter of ten minutes. We tried the tadka first and it tasted nothing like it used to be. Honestly speaking it tasted like the ordinary road side stall tadkas. Then we sampled the chicken tikka butter masala. Again to our disappointment it did not even taste like a normal chicken tikka. It was yellowish in colour and the flavour was nowhere close to what chicken tikka tastes like. We had given up all hope but thankfully the chili fish tasted better compared to the other dishes. What an irony !  The fish was atleast fresh and pure bhetki which was the saving grace. I had the tandori roti and it was just average.
I wanted to have the tutti fruity  ice cream but that was not available. My brother had a thums up and we left. 

The food we had was billed at Rs 840 which is okay for a proper meal for 3 people but the quality and taste has deteriorated miserably and we left the place with much disappointment. Not coming back since there are loads of other places which serve pretty good North Indian stuff at almost the same price range.
Parking is available right outside the restaurant for 3-4 cars.

Had been there in Dhaba recently(Durga Puja 2013). Ordered Chicken Tandoori which tasted like heaven. Biriyani was awesome,food was served quick and it had enough salads in side dishes to restrict us from ordering salads :P (actually i dont prefer salads). Chicken Kasa was my all time favourite and had my first lunch with my Girlfriend which was a wonderful experience. Was not disappointed at all,just that they they did not provide us a genuine printed bill. The ambiance is good,not much spacious. Waiters are old people without any proper uniform. 
DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW, I PROMISE NOT TO DISAPPOINT.

I have been eating in Dhaba for as long as I can remember. It is a pretty good option if you are looking for a respite from all those pathetic attempts at appearing all chic and cosmopolitan at overpriced, fine dining joints :P and want to indulge in real food especially if you are a basic meat-and-potatoes (read : machh-bhaat / tandoori naan-dal makhni-butter chicken person) .The seating arrangement is decent , the regular punjabi fare is definitely above average and the portion sizes are huge. The waiters could be more courteous though. Loudly announcing - "TOTAL 1000"  when they brought the bill left me feeling embarrassed and disgusted the last time I was there with my friends.

One of those places which give you absolute value for money and nothing but pure satisfaction every time you visit. Perfect place to go and enjoy piping hot rotis or naan with your choice of dal and chicken/mutton.

I have been consuming ‘The Dhaban’ food for so long that I could not recall the first laying pave of memory sidewalk. This diner has some preference concerning its position, located at the hustling crossing of Ballygunge Phari. If you are passing this crucial crossing your eyeballs will grab the flashy red hoarding, written ‘The Dhaba’. 

The décor is not that catchy, simple wooden chairs and tables are settling down as furnishings on ground floor. But when you take yourself upstairs you will note that wooden chairs are replaced by cozy sofas, and they offer you a window seat which does not assure you a great view, but a piece of the sky is always welcomed when you are eating. 

Once on my lunch treat I sampled their Biryani, I am not going to remark the dish was the prize winner, but they served me well. The quantity was more than ample to drown my hunger. The one dish I should give a special mention is Chicken Sag (Green Chicken), the chicken was so delicate that it was melting in the mouth; the gravy was a stunner, a perfectly well balanced among the spices. But once I stepped on a wrong foot by ordering Lemon Chicken from their Chinese delicacies. 

They offer you a takeaway counter, where rolls are one of their bestsellers. My favorite is eventually the Chicken roll, they  have a list to choose from. Service is very commendable and prompt, and stewards who attend you, make a good suggestion too. So this is a good place to stop by and taste north Indian hospitality.

This joint is about a ten minutes walk from my home. Their food is good. The staff act a little pricey sometimes and the service can be a bit shoddy at times otherwise it is quite efficient. You can get yourselves seated in the ac section or on the terrace (certainly not advisable during the warmer months) or at the ground floor. The service really does not differ much in these places. What differs is only your perception of comfort. Their kebabs are not too good except the tangri kebabs. The tandoori chicken is awesome and so are the naans. The naans remain soft and tear easily even after they get cold after a couple of hours. Also one must try their romali rotis with the tadka be it chicken egg or veg. The tadka is good, period. I also like the chicken butter masala here and the rolls although priced on the higher side are decent and really filling. The mutton that they serve is well below par so it is advisable to not go for them. In the winter months they serve the famous Punjabi combo of makki di roti and sarson da saag, which are by far the best i have tasted in Kolkata. I daresay even better than Amber's. Only a Punjabi household might make it better. The only aspect to complain about is that all the dishes are a bit too oily. But in my opinion that is what one would expect from a dhaba. If you are at or around Ballygunge Phari and get hunger pangs do try this place.

It's not a dhaba in any sense. Dada boudi's bengali food is sold under the veil of north indian food. Tasteless ,unhygenic, no one should eat from here. Local thelawala offers better food than them. Not to mention prices are comparable with some good restaurants in kolkata,but value for money is a big zero.

Coming to the food.. We had gone for a birthday bash.. The food was really nice.. The best out of the items were prawn masala.. The rest including dal tadka malai kofta were good too.. the children even enjoyed the hakka noodles and crispy chilli babycorn. the place is low on ur pocket.. A must visit place for a north indian dinner/ lunch.....

If you live in South Kolkata, you must have passed across this one at least a dozen times. This restaurant looks pretty promising. But once you've actually had the experience of dining here, it's not that striking. There are no shortcomings of the place as such. But then again, there aren't any good points either. They specialize in Indian Cuisines, as the name would suggest. The Chicken Bharta is pretty good. But bad news for vegans, items like Tarka are not at all up to the mark. They taste pretty bland as opposed to their inherent spicy nature. Also, going by the food quality and quantity, the prices are bit pinching. So, it's a place you can try out, but once you do, you surely won't be too eager to go back again.

Its very difficult to review a place that one has literally grown up on . This for me was the place i got introduced to tandoori chicken and reshmi kebabs too. 25 years ago this was probably the only place that served Decent punjabi food in the city and is still a stalwart in that arena . Best thing about them is that they have been very consonant over the years. Not brilliant, but pretty darn good. 

I have always been a huge fan of their kebabs and especially the fish tikka  and tandoori chicken . The make amazing palak panner and kaali daal. But they icing on the cake is the keema and all other mutton dishes. 

also another must try is the Fish roll. In winters they make amazing sarson ka saag and makki ki roti . Over all cholesterol loaded soul comforts are what i love about this place. If u are fighting a break up do eat here . IT WORKS WONDERS !

I can be slightly biased towards Dhaba, especially because once upon a time, I would walk from Jadavpur to Ballygunge Phari, buy a roll, and walk to Park Circus, eating it slowly on my way, when I was in University. Years later, this place remains one of my favorite joints around Ballygunge, far more loved than Kwality on the opposite side. I love their Egg Tadka with fresh Tandoori Rotis straight off the fire, and love the chicken butter masala and Keema Naan. One of the things from the menu which I love despite it being one of the most common things in a Punjabi Dhaba is their Paalak Paneer - their version is one which I absolutely adore. The lassi is good but not spectacular though.

One of the few remaining affordable eateries in Ballygunge. Simple and non assuming it's a far cry from the posh boutique restaurants that has cropped up over the years in and around that part of the city. The Dhaba, located at Ballygunge Phari is decades old and retains a fair number of old time fans although most of them complain that the place has steadily deterioreted  down the years. Not a fancy place to begin with, the clientele now includes a large number of students. The place has a certain comfortable and relaxing feel, even though it is laced with a large amount of sanitised frugality. The prices are by default average or less and service is quick. No VAT is yet taken. The menu probably sheds some light on the curious name of the establishment. It is panjabi to the core. The Chicken, Mutton, Tarka and Roti sections all are excuisitely filled with punjabi dishes, both common as well as special. And they are more than good across the borad. Yet, in recent years, they've included a seafood, rice and noodle sections. Stick to the Panjabi dishes.

I however like most of the people I saw at the place, availed the services of the fast food section, having only an egg roll here. It was nice, large and with a little help from the lime, tasted great. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the fast food items were not only take away. :) Got to spend an hour sitting there idling over fast food. I look forward to updating this review asap by having some of the other items on the menu.

Chakraborty Tips : The serving staff are more intent on discussing the day's debates than on serving. If you dare to ask for their help, they can be found at the back of the room animatedly keeping alive the tradition of conversation.

I know most people write about food, but I want to inform readers about this restaurant's billing practices, which to my mind, border on the fraudulent.

Any visitor will notice that Dhaba has a window in front which does a roaring business in the perennial Kolkata favorite - rolls. Now, funnily, while no VAT is charged if you pay in cash, be prepared to shell out 14.5% VAT if you use a credit card. On being asked about this practice, the man at the desk replies that they pay the VAT out of their own pockets for cash transaction so as not to dissuade the poor customers (Point to be noted: Not everyone who pays cash is poor; in fact, it might well be the opposite).

On my query if this is legal, the man nonchalantly replied "everything is legal." Now, this is what I think is happening. Cash transactions are not being reported - in other words, no VAT is being paid and it's black money. If they are so concerned about VAT, shouldn't it be collected for all transactions?

Now, I know many will think I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but I believe in standing up for what's right and raising my voice against what's wrong. I will try to report it to the relevant authorities and also request a charge back on my card. Feedback, both positive and negative, is welcome.

I visited the dhaba for a quick lunch today. Situated at ballygunge phaari.
The ground floor here we sat is non a.c. And a bit unhygienic. But the first floor is a.c. And recomended if one is visiting with family and ladies its far better than the ground floor obviously the prices are more upstairs plus u will be charged service tax upstairs because of the new govt. Rules.
Coming on the food we ordered chicken reshmi kabab, chicken tandoori , chichen bharta & butter naan. Now the tandoori items were good but the chicken bharta dissapointed me. The only thing which i became a fan of was the butter naan, they were ultra soft. I havent had such soft naan before in a resti of dis class. They also serve good rolls which i have had many times in the past and they are gr8.
Prices- Our total bill was around Rs 550. I persnaly think its a bit on the higher side.
One special mention they use butter instead of cheap dalda so after having food u will not feel too heavy. plus one point for that
Final verdict- average
I would preffer arsalan over dhaba just 5 mins distance by car.

Wow, remembering my old days in Ballygunge science college, late night for practical classes and then altogether in dhaba enjoying tandoori roti, tarka and their world famous chicken pakora, yummy. Honestly, they are far ahead of the kakurgachi Honey da dhaba (and also they are not from same chain, they are different), during summer, please please try their mango lassi, probably the best in town. Mouth watering, filling, delicious and excellent, only few words to describe their food.

One of the oldest restaurants near the Ballygunge Phari, I have visited this place more than 50 times perhaps. 
The Chicken Bharta, Chicken Butter Masala, Palak Paneer and Kulcha are my favorite items off the menu. From the take-away counter, the egg-chicken roll is an absolute delight. Most of the food contains generous helpings of butter and ghee, so health-freaks beware!
The prices seem a bit on the higher side, considering the ambience.

Food here is good... pretty good, actually. Albeit it doesn't look like a dhaba (well, upstairs I mean), doesn't feel like a dhaba, and serves a platter of food that's not typically of the dhaba kind, these guys nevertheless serves some real tasty food. 

Service is in the range of okay to good, and all items are decently priced (although I don't buy the statement that the average cost for two is Rs. 300, unless they are going in for rolls and similar stuff). 

The place is located very conveniently at a prominent junction of crossroads, which is an added advantage. 

I recommend.

If it says The Dhaba outside, if the food tastes like Dhaba food, if it smells sort of like a Dhaba downstairs, is it really a Dhaba? Walk into the air-conditioned area upstairs, and you'll find yourself in a dilemma. Not the existential crisis sort, but a bamboozling question nonetheless. But paltry in the face of the real question: What is the food like? Nevertheless, maybe this is the progenitor of some sort of Neo-Dhaba chain of restaurants?

Moving on to the meat of the matter. Literally. The Dhaba, if it were a student, would be rated as average. Low average. The place has some great rolls, and the Chicken and Egg Chicken are two of my personal favourites. On the other hand, the rest of the food is nothing to really write home about, having undergone a gradual decline in quality over the past few years. Coupled with the fact that it is rather highly priced for a Dhaba, it deserves the solidly mediocre rating it has on Zomato. One plus point about this place is that it doesn't use 'dalda' to cook, which makes the food easier on the stomach and on the palate. At the same time, the positive is detracted by the fact that some dishes are fairly swimming in oil - and a dish that looks ugly is a dish that automatically tastes ugly in my mind.

Nevertheless, it would be unfair to say that the Dhaba is a bad place to eat. The AC portion of the restaurant is quite hygienic, service is fairly prompt and waiters are polite if not too eager. Chicken Bharta and Chicken Butter Masala are good things to eat, their Chicken Tandoori and Boti Kebabs are quite decent. Their Roomali Roti is thin and light, but I would recommend - as with all kinds of breads - to eat it before it gets cold and impossible to tear. The one dish I would really recommend, though, is the Mutton Tikka Onion. For some reason, I really, really love this dish and would eat a whole plate of it if I could. The meat itself is soft and juicy, and the taste itself is fantastic in it's own right. A must try, if they've kept the standards of the dish consistent.

The Dhaba's apparently started serving Chinese food as well. I have nothing to comment on that, both on the decision and the food.

The first thought that comes to your mind when you enter this restaurant is that why is it named as Dhaba because it does not look like one, does not serve food as good as one, does not price its food as well as one. The Dal makhni, which has to be the best item any dhaba can serve was literally floating in ghee which is not really by my liking.. the other food was all right but had nothing which would make you go wow!

Location : The Dhaba is situated in Ballygunge main road and I'm eating here since around 10 years. It serves one of the best Indian food, serves biriyani and kababs too though never tried it.

Coming to the pros and cons

Pros :
1) decently priced
2) they use ghee instead of dalda so food quality is better
3) ambience is good
4) staffs are polite 
5) service is quick  
6) quite hygienic 
7) staffs are friendly 
8) good place to hang out with friends and family 

Cons: 
1) they should have a music system.

Rest , all is well :)

The best chicken rolls in town in my opinion. I was a frequent visitor of this place for the thick rolls literally stuffed with chicken. One fine day i realized there's an air conditioned seating arrangement upstairs. Well,the ambience is neat though gives you no hint of the dhaba feel,just another fine dining place. The food is excellent, my favourites being chicken bharta, paneer butter masala, chicken tikka masala and butter chicken with masala kulcha. Overall it's a good place to have north Indian cuisine.

The Dhaba is a somewhat expensive restaurant located at Ballygunge Phari. In its current incarnation, most of it does not resemble a dhaba. There is a small section on the ground floor with dhaba-style seating and service, but the restaurant's focus appears to have shifted to the air-conditioned dining areas on the ground and first floors.

The air-conditioned section resembles any other standard restaurant. The place is clean, but there is nothing in its appearance that makes it stand out. The menu cards appear to be badly made photocopies, which strikes an odd note in a sit-down restaurant. The prices of most items are high by Calcutta standards. In particular, the rolls appear to be exorbitantly priced.

A Keema Naan, the Mutton Dahi and Firni were ordered. The Keema Naan was quite good, with lashings of butter on top and a layer of keema within. The Mutton Dahi was quite bad. Four pieces of bony mutton floated in a reddish gravy. This, too, being what was called a "Full Plate" on the menu. One wonders what half a plate would have contained. No trace of curd could be found in the dish. The firni was good, but, at fifty rupees plus taxes, the most expensive bowl of firni I've eaten in Calcutta. The service was average.

Overall, not the best place in Calcutta to go to for North Indian food, unless one sits in the cheaper non-AC section, where one might get one's money's worth.

A very good restaurant, no nonsense no show just proper good food. A standard North Indian although I like the Chinese too which they serve now. Seating on the ground floor is nothing fancy while the first floor is a better. The best part about Dhaba is their Rolls, the Double Egg Double Chicken Roll is one to die for. The owner is a very nice and helpful gentleman. Good place.

Okay, The Dhaba, probably one of the very few dhabas in those way early days which was meant for a comfortable visit with your family.
The sad part is that nothing much has changed except the food quality which has deteriorated. The prices are high compared to an average dhaba or maybe around the same mark but the average new age dhabas have better food and sometimes even better ambiance. However, memories take me back to this place often.
Though people have been referring its rolls often but I would like to say that its roll's quality has also deteriorated cause one time they used to make probably the best roll(well nearly) in South Kolkata. The rumali roti roll is of course as pointed out in a review prior to this is a very good choice though...
Try out their Keema nun or The Tandoori Paratha. I have never quite liked their biryani as such so please do not try. Their tandoori items still run good and their chicken or fish in butter masala are still one of the best in town. Though a few of my friends like their bharta but that is something I never like anywhere so I will be biased. 
Try out their mutton Korma or chicken saag though the malai kopta from veg is bad but the paneer pasinda and the navratna korma is or rather was definitely worth a try did not go very recently to try out these items.
I have never tried any chinese dish from here but why would you want to have chinese at a dhaba. They just do not match according to my perception.
However a lot of people are loyal to this place and tend to get their food parceled so it runs rather smoothly for this reason.
Overall verdict give it a try but it will not woe you totally

I remember eating at The Dhaba some 7 years back and, at that time I truly enjoyed their succulent north Indian dishes and liked their cool and cozy ambience. In fact, I remember being greeted by a host of friendly waiters who promptly responded to our needs and requirements. However, after my recent visit to this restaurant, I'm really disappointed. It is no longer the old Dhaba at Ballygunge Phari. Their standard has fallen drastically. The Dhaba was popular for making some lip smacking tandoori and kebabs. People used to throng here just to taste their delicious and juicy tandoori chicken, tangri kebab or boti kebab. But, now it seems that things have changed a lot in the last few years.
Just about a month back I went to dine at The Dhaba with my friend and had a shocking experience. I cast a glance around and was taken aback to see how unclean the place was. The tables were not properly cleaned; the waiters did not care to wipe the plates before laying the plates, bowls and spoons on the tables. It seemed that the waiters hardly had time for the customers. We had to call them twice and only then one waiter had time to take our orders. Though we didn't like the ambience and service of the staff, we, at least expected to eat delicious food.  But, The Dhaba failed to live up to our expectations. 
We had ordered chicken tandoori, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken butter masala, butter Nan, chicken biryani, mixed raita and kesar kulfi. I could not figure out whether our chicken tandoori was actually cooked in a tandoor or burnt in a tandoor. The over-cooked chicken tandoori tasted bitter. The chicken kebabs were tough and tasteless. And what shall I say about the chicken butter masala! I had a feeling that the chicken pieces were floating in a pool of oil and spices. The Nan was too tough (for a moment I thought of using both my hands to tear it into small pieces) and the biryani was unpalatable to our taste buds. I was actually shocked to see how their standard has fallen. Even a few years back, The Dhaba was one of the most popular restaurants in Kolkata and an ideal place for all foodies. But now, people avoid eating here. 
If you do not want to spoil your appetite, then avoid eating at The Dhaba.

This place is located right at ballygunge phari junction. It comprises of two floors. The lower floor is not air conditioned and is mostly very dirty. The floor uplstairs is air conditioned and sufficiently clean. The ambiance is very average. Food served here is also average. I would recommend the Indian dishes. if you happen to drop in. 
However my sole purpose of writing is the roll joint. They make rolls downstairs, and their rolls are very nice. They serve chicken roll with a lot of shredded chicken unlike other places who put tiny kababs. Also they serve a romali roti roll which means its without the paratha wrap with dry romali roti wrap. Sounds weird but tastes awesome. Its one of my favourites. Do try if passing by. Enjoy :)

A place very easy to locate as it is along the main road and in a busy area. The food is ok, maybe a bit sticky in the mouth. The ambiance is very morose and disappointing. makes you fall asleep. Large deteriorating food quality. Service not very fast. Choose this if you are wanting to eat light food and still want to have the feeling of having eaten outside :)

This place has been in existence for years and is a very prominent eatery in Ballygunge.The quality of food has clearly slipped and some might find it too oily and spicy for their liking.The chicken reshmi masala was pretty decent and the pieces of chicken was extremely soft,succulent and juicy.Sarson  saag (seasonal dish) was OK but the makki roti and the egg tadka was a letdown.This is a place where one should know what to order and what to avoid as the quality may fluctuate wildly across dishes.This is surely not the joint where one can order any dish on the menu and find it of a minimum standard.
Do not expect anything on the ambiance and service front as there isn't any.Hygiene and waiter behaviour is at times shocking.Safer option would be take-away as i had done.
P.S.: Their roll section is a major hit and found their chicken roll to be pretty decent though.

I used to enjoy frequenting this place when it opened way back but the quality has  slipped since .... they made nice rolls though of late I find them rather oily and even the kebabs inside are not as tasty. The tandoori chicken  is still pretty good and most of the kebabs are decent. I would not say this is a must visit place though its a pocket friendly decent dining option. However service standards are poor and ambience is nothing so if you go expecting a good score on either of those counts you will be disappointed.

I visit there very rarely. I went there recently and had a good experience. Its having a mediocre ambience and food quality is superb,,really,,,i mean it. Th tandooris and kababs are awesome. They have never climbed any stairs for losing standard. Staffs are okay and service is slightly slow. The Amritsari Fish is lip-smacking. Chicken Reshmi butter Masala is a must try,,, i bet that you all will like it. Prices are affordable. Visit there. I would rate 4.0 for THE DHABA.

Dhaba is a restaurant which is located in a popular place and it can be viewed by everyone. Its a bit nostalgic for me because I used to take my gf here in those early days of our relationship. I will refer everybody to go on the upstairs.

The ambiance is quite good over here and it is a peaceful place to spend a quality time. I use to take chicken tandoori, chicken tikka kabab, masala naan, mutton kassa etc. But if you are going for the first time, you must try one item and that is mutton tikka onion. Although it is a starter but I will tell you to take this with plain paratha. This delicious dish is a wonderful mixing of small pieces of mutton, onions, green chillies, and other spices. The quantity they give is sufficient for a couple. the staffs are not so wel-behaved that is the only problem with this place. Overall a thumbs up for dhaba from my end.

Not great dine-in ambience. Great for takeaway. Most Punjabi foods are consistently great and slightly high handed towards flavours.

This is an age old place in South Kolkata. I remember going here with my parents when I was in Junior School. Then they had just started the AC Section in 1st floor.

Recently, I took my wife here. She is from North Kolkata and had never been here. However, she got hooked to the taste & cost so much that she insists we go here every time I plan for an eat-out. There's not much to the ambiance, you can still see the age-old ACs. However, there's a newer section section built on the 1st floor as well.

Ambiance - 2/5
Food - 6/5
Cost - 5/5

DB

I am visiting this place ever since my childhood and quite surprised to see that they have kept their standards same....NO CHANGE. I loved almost all the dishes I tried here. I specially visit this place during winter to have Sarson the Saag and Makai di Roti(there seasonal dishes). Nice place.

sophistication and roadside flavours well blended. tandoori chicken needs a special mention along with chicken varta. pocket friendly. prompt service. a good place to visit if you are around ballygunje and need a quick,economic and filling lunch. the appetizers though are a bit too costly here.and lastly go for mineral water although it might seem a bit expensive than it should be

Visited last week. Food was good. The only problem was that the paneer was not properly cooked and so was hard. Taste was good.
Love the Palak Paneer, Masala Kulcha and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala that they serve here.
But in the past some of my friends have had bad experiences with undercooked mutton dishes. So it kind of depends on your luck
