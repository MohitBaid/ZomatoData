It is a small eatery with a wide variety of fast food. Serves noodles, rolls, and the famous Mayo Rolls which is made from not the normal paratha but e-mail roti. The different types of rolls that are served here is great. They serve your order hot and fresh.

I would recommend the Mayo Roll.

A small joint located near 8B bus stand. Although a bit inconvenient due to absence of any seating space and more because it's a perpetually busy area, this place offers you really delicious chicken mayo wrap. And their service is quite fast. Good for students looking for pocket friendly food joints.

This place is located close to Jadavpur 8B bus stand , and is a five minute walk away from the bus stop , towards JU. The place looks like an average fast food stall , with chairs outside , and no tables for seating . The wraps here are good ! They call it Mayo Roll. Do try their Paneer Mayo Roll and Chicken Mayo Roll , that taste good and are pocket friendly too! They also have the usual Kathi rolls in egg and chicken variants. The service is fairly quick and the food is value for money .

I have visited this place a couple of times. Tried their Chicken Mayo Roll and Chicken Lollypop. The Mayo Roll was simply delectable! I am not a fan of mayonnaise personally, but I loved this mayo roll..contained just the right quantity of mayo and the mayo was also not very dense. The Chicken lollypop was crunchy and tasty on the exterior, but once I had a look inside, I realised that it wasn't fried properly. They should have taken more time to fry it properly. Furthermore, quantity was also too less at just 3pieces. They should have provided 4 pieces at least for half a plate.                                                                          Service is quick even when the place is crowded. Sitting and eating there is not a very good idea as there are a lot of flies flying around. So a takeaway is the best option. Also, this place is overpriced compared to other eateries in the vicinity. 70bucks just for a mayo roll seems too much for a student.

Been to this place quite a number of times. It's located near 8b bus stand between JU gate 2 and gate 3 on the opposite side of the road. Previously it was named 'chaos'. 

There are 4-5 chairs outside so nothing much to say about ambience. The first time, I had tried Egg Roll which I did not like at all because the parantha was too large compared to the egg and it seemed like I was just having the parantha plus it had too much salt. I had also tried Chicken Hakka noodles which was good and quantity was okay for one person. Their chicken gravy noodles tastes awesome. It has chicken and a few other veggies (beans,tomato,corn,etc). If only the quantity was more! I had also tried their chicken mayo roll. It's made of roomali roti with generous amounts of chicken and dressed with mayo and sauces. It's heavenly. You must try this one. 

Service is quick. GST isn't charged. It's pocket friendly and at the same time maintains quality.

Earlier known as chaos, this takeaway(takeaway literally if we don't consider the 3-4 plastic chairs) serves delicious food without burning a hole in your pockets. 
My favourite being the egg chicken mayo roll. Tastes brilliant. #recommended.
I have had the normal kathi rolls, momo and noodles as well. Food and adda here is a perfect combo while you wait for you photocopies to get done or after a little trip inside JU.
This is a must try.

A popular fast food joint located opposite to the Electrical Engineering department of Jadavpur University is pretty famous among the locals and the college crowd;

Their menu is not widespread and various, but what is there on paper is rightfully served in real life; They serve various kinds of rolls, chinese cuisines & indian food ; Being specialised in the rolls ...they have both tawa rolls and mayo rolls...and all the items in the menu are pocket friendly !

I, on my part ordered a egg chicken tawa roll ; Both the quantity and quality of the roll,its size,the chicken pieces, the presentation,all in all everything was good; 

Moreover it is a pretty clean and hygienic place too; having plastic chairs for outdoor sitting !!! Continue the good work !!!

Had a chicken roll once to nullify hunger from this always crowded fast food joint near 8b bus stand, opposite to Jadavpur university.

Got it after a 10min wait. The size of that roll was huge, I was stuffed after finishing it. But the taste was really average, like any ordinary Street rolls. I had better rolls at lower price. So, I will rate it as 3 out of 5.

This place has been open for a while now and I beg your sincere apologies for reviewing this place so late, although it's just located opposite to my university gate. 
If you walk two minutes from the 8B auto stand towards the Jadavpur Police Station, on the same footpath, this place will fall on your left just at the ground floor of the Cantonese Restaurant. 
There are a number of places in this area which serve the mundane Kolkata street food. Amidst all of this, Chaos is a little different, which is very much evident in their menu. 
After my classes today, while walking the way back to the auto stand, hunger pangs started beating me so hard that I could have died. Hence thought of paying a visit to this place and accomplish the much awaited review. 
It's a very simple place. Don't expect too much of cleanliness and hygiene. There are a few plastic chairs as sitting arrangements on the adjacent footpath. I wished to try a number of items like the Steamed Pork Momo, Chicken Milanese, Fish and Chips and many more. All of them seemed really lucrative. But I was alone. Hence, had to settle for one thing - the Chicken Mayo Roll. 
Had heard a lot about this from my classmate and truly they didn't exaggerate a bit. I don't prefer wraps and rolls he because they are too thick and heavy. This one had no such hanky business. It was sized like three fourth of the standard Kolkata Kathi Rolls. The wrap was made of Roomali Roti, light, fluffy and aery - satisfying enough to not jam my appetite. The filling was full of chicken chunks treated with a mildly spicy mayonnaise. I relished every bit of it and just didn't want to finish the last bite. 
I generally don't rate a place so high by trying just one item only. But this place, their super quick service and the good quality of food have just mesmerised me. I am definitely going to come back here to try the other items that I have mentioned earlier in my review. Totally recommended. Happy Dining! :)

Although I've been to Jadavpur countless times, I have always opted for eating out at places I've visited before. Yesterday was a change as we opted for someplace new.

Being so close to Jadavpur 8B bus stand and Jadavpur University, this shop enjoys a lot of traffic. It has a few seating arrangements in the form of plastic chairs on the footpath, so be careful about that if you plan to sit and chow.

But the food was simply good. We ordered 2 bowls of Chicken Thukpa. We honestly weren't expecting anything like that. The quantity was ample, the taste was really good. Nothing was overcooked, none of the flavours were overpowering, the vegetables were tasty but retained their crunch which is hard to find. Although the chopped Onion as a garnish was a bit too much, but as far as I am concerned, the 150rupees were well spent.

One thing is for sure, though, this outlet has yet to see the last of me.

Very bad Experience. Been there more than 2-3 times.  Ordered chicken steam momo which tasted bald. They also refuse to refill your soup bowl which the other small momo shops at Jadavpur doesn't.  Saying about the  so called mayo roll they hardly apply a spoonful of mayo and then charges 20 bucks more. In main course the Hakka noodles or fried rice is just about fine but the size of the chili chicken is well small and coated with almost 90% of cornflour.

Quantity and quality both are quite good. 
Nothing about the ambience as it's just have few sitting stools in the footpath. 
I tried their momo and hakka noodles... Though it tastes good but nothing extraordinary. There are many other local food joints in jadavpur which makes great food as well. And pocket friendly than this particular place.

Although no seating is available (except for a 3-4 plastic chairs o footpath), this shop provides great quality & quantity of food at reasonable price. Their Mayo Rolls are excellent. Their normal kathi rolls are bigger than the standard roll size. Half plate of chowmein or fried rice is enough for 1 person. I also tried chicken Milanese which is basically chicken cutlet. Also waiting time for your order around 4-5mins.

Chaos, is located in Jadavpur area on the Main road. (Parking is difficult though) 

Ambience - a road side stall with limited plastic chairs to sit on. 

What to order - Fish and Chips (and they provide extra mayonnaise on request) 
The Chicken mayo roll, is a wrap sorts, and though fulfilling isn't oily!

The chicken noodle meal, with noodles and Chili chicken is good and value for money.

The dimsums I hear are good too!

Value For money - Yes!

Taste and Quality really good!

Chaos is the best thing that has happened to the myriad of fast food places in Jadavpur in recent years. The Chicken Mayo Roll is HIGHLY recommended, as is the normal Chicken rolls. Food isn't too expensive. The only two regrets are that they don't do home deliveries and their seating arrangement is practically non existent. Other than that, quality place. Highly recommended.

Jadavpur is a great area when it comes to snacks. There are innumerable outlets selling momos, noodles etc. 'Chaos' is by far the best shop here. 

The outlet of 'Chaos' is located at Jadavpur 8B more just beside 'Cantonese'. The shop has little ambience and seating arrangements is limited to six chairs, but the taste of the food more than makes up for these shortcomings. 

We went here today at 3.15 p.m. We ordered one Non-veg combo first. The combo consisted of egg fried rice, chicken in hot garlic sauce and two pieces of fried chicken momo. The hot garlic chicken was delicious and tasted heavenly with the rice. The fried chicken momos were delicious. 

Impressed with the non-veg combo I went for egg hakka noodles and pork in oyster sauce while

This newly opened joint is a boon for us Jadavpur University people, whenever hunger pangs hit us and we can shell more than the usual 20-30 bucks on Shyamol Da'r maggi or Abhijeet Da'r roll (outside gate 4),this is where we go. 
For quick bites I would totally suggest their rolls, both the kathi and roomali roti variants. I have tasted all the mayo rolls, egg, chicken and fish and for some odd reason I loved the egg one best. Though, both the others are also DELICIOUS. Also their 'chicken milanese' is a treat for gluttonous souls like me - crumb fried fillets of juicy chicken served with freshly made fries and mayo sauce.
I have also had their steamed veg momo which was a perfect balance of flavour, texture and quantity.
Now, coming to what 'Chaos' is known best for- being a saviour during house parties. Their combo meal is one of the best I have experienced.For 120 bucks(10 bucks extra if you are getting it packed) you get a choice of egg fried rice/noodles, chilly chicken/garlic chicken and two pieces of chicken fried momo. The quantity and quality of the combo COULD NOT have been better.
The best thing about Chaos is the hygiene that is maintained by everyone working here, it may be a roadside joint with no seating arrangement but the place is 'spic n span' and everyone goes about their work wearing hair mesh and gloves.

The only thumbs down that I have to give chaos is that sometimes they run out of the chicken fried momo that they serve in the combo and compensate for that with one chicken lollypop, which is not that great. Otherwise this place should be on the culinary radar of every true food lover,whether they are students looking for a pocket-friendly fast food place or not.

Had got lot of recommendations for this place from friends and tried out the fried momos,schezwan noodles,vegetable Manchurian and egg roll. Service was quick,and the stall is very neat and hygienic. Taste is really good.  They also have combo offers. So if you are a fast food fan ,do give this place a visit. You get yummy fast food and that too without compromising with the hygiene. :)

September 2016 : Its new initiative. We went their just to try chicken milanese and it was just like chicken chap but tastier. We also tried chicken mayo roll and i must say amount of Mayonnaise was okayish according to the price along with the chunky. The momos were also tasty. Their chinese combo is good and worth the price. So they worth a rating of 4.5
February 2017 : We recently went their again and had chicken mayo roll, chicken roll along with chicken momo this time. The taste of the chicken mayo roll had gone down. It contains more than required onion and lesser mayonnaise. Momos were good. But you can definately have better chicken roll in the roadside food stalls near this outlet. Surprisingly they still don't have a bit of seating arrangement except 4 plastic chairs. All these made me decrease the rating to 3.

This newly opened up joint in Jadavpur is worth a try. They serve rolls both the traditional ones, and also mayo rolls. These are basically roomali rolls with mayo dressing in the filling. 

I had the Fish Mayo Roll and it was brilliant. Succulent chunks of fried fish, lathered with mayo, neatly packed in a roomali roti is indeed a good thing. The Chicken Mayo Roll too was good, but the fish one was undoubtedly better. 

They also serve Chinese main course, and I plan to try them soon😃

The chicken mayo roll made with rumali roti and mayonnaise and chicken. Somehow I did not like its taste. Combo meal was so so. That's it. Nothing special to explain about this road side roll stall.

Just a stone's throw from my place of work, this is one of the most visited places for evening snacks and impromptu treats. Love their pan fried momos! It's the best thing on their menu. The rolls, both fried and mayo, are good too. I tried the non veg combo of fried rice and chilly chicken and garlic noodles and hot and sour chicken, but was underwhelmed. The batter of the chicken was too thick and wasn't moist enough and the noodles tasted bland. I hope they improve on this part. But pretty easy on the pocket and efficient delivery, still makes it popular in the area.
