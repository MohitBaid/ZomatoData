I've recently shifted near this place and I've been visiting them daily. Hands down the best vada pao ever. The cheese garlic bread and potato masala sandwich are amazing as well!

This is a Veg-only food joint located in Teghoria. We ordered cheesy vada paw and Veg cheese sandwich. The food is really good value for money.  The grilled sandwich is a basic tomato - capsicum variety,  with generous quantity of mayo. The cheesy vada pav deserves a special mention. It looks like a Veg burger,  with Bhaji, mayonnaise and cheese strips in between the pavs. It's simply delicious and a must try.

This place has a variety of pizzas and pastas that too within budget. I ordered for a mix veg pizza and brownie with hot chcoolate and ice cream. The pizza was not that good but yeah it can be consumed as a snack . The brownie they delivered ... well the ice cream and the chocolate was mixed totally when i got it and the brownie was floating in it. Otherwise the dessert was good to taste.

Well I never really liked vada pav till I had their cheesy vada pav!! And now I crave more.
Simply lip smacking - a must try for vada pav amateur tasters such as me.

I am a frequent visitor to this place, almost every weekend. It is stone's throw from my house. They only serve vegetarian dishes. One of the best fast food outlet you will get in town. They serve different types of sandwiches, vada pav's, burgers, pizzas, maggi, pasta, shakes, etc. Prices are very reasonable. I have tried almost every item and all are fresh and very well prepared. Items are generously filled with cheese and vegetables. The owner Vishal, always boasting a smile on his face, treats every customer very well. Highly recommended.

A new small quick bite joint with special sandwiches and new style burgers.

**Location**
Very near to the Teghoria Loknath temple.

**Experience**
Basically they are totally a veg outlet. Different style sandwiches and burger as well as pizzas are their offerings. 

I tried their veg cheesy bada pav  and for me i can say that it is the Indian burger they make here. Also the grilled sandwich was made well and fresh. 
Liked them.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Newly opened near Loknath Temple connecting road. Below The Glossary store of Mudi khana. A Brand new store with a new variety of food stuff. This place gives a very different taste of bread stuffs with various ingredients with it. The owner's were too busy to create a page in Zomato so i helped them out with it.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: Ambiance is not so big but few seats for grabs inside. The decor is very simple and the walls are painted with cool colors. According to the store i found this place to be perfect. Two young guys running the store are very friendly and polite. Place is very clean. 

FOOD: As it is newly opened just near our house so we decided to bring some stuffs here for the veggies at home. We had the three different stuffs from here thou i didn't tasted it. We had 
Masala Vada Paw which i heard was very good.
Secondly we had the Veg chessy Burger which was also very nice and the cheese was the best part.
Thirdly we had the Panir Vada Paw in which i saw a huge size of panir was place with it was capsicum, onion, tomato and other stuffs were given and all the Vada Paw and burgers were placed inside the maker.

Masala Vada Paw: 8.5/10
Veg Chessy Burger: 8.5/10
Panir vada Paw: 8.5/10

QNQ AND PRICES:  Quality of the products they make are very good and very clean. Quantity is according to what you order. Prices are reasonable for some new food stuffs like this.

CONCLUSION: They serve only Veg items. Lots of stuffs are up for grabs here. They also provide Cold Coffee , Masala thumps up.  Its something at this place, everyone should have a try.

NOTE: This review is based on personal visit and experience to this place.
