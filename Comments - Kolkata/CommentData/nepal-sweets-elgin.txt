Nepal Sweets on Sarat Bose Road, Kolkata..... as most of us know about this shop for its famous sweets and people at times queue up for buying sweets from this renowned shop is actually the most appropriate, perfect and the right place for stale, rotten and filthy stuff. You order something on good faith and they will pack for you the stale sweets. Pioneer in cheating people and most rude behaviour one can expect from this shop. They donâ€™t leave any stone unturned to ensure that u fall sick after consuming their stale sweets. If u buy 8 ras gullas packed for your home, they expect you to report instantly if they were stale ... even if u come after 4 hours, you are only insulted before other guests at the shop. Customer satisfaction is like Greek to them.... just in case the owner of the shop is reading this post.... man your days are numbered !!!

This is one kind of a place. I have lots of childhood memories with this sweet shop 'Cause my school was there nearby to This place. 

This is located in the Elgin Road ( Landsdowne )...

Service is prompt and staffs are cooperative. 

This sweet shop is known as The Gulab Sandesh Shoppe for a reason... Gulab sandesh here is a must try... One can feel the flavour and essence of rose once have it. 

I tried Lassi and papri chart from this place as well. They taste good. Overall not a bad experience. Pocket pinch is not too high.

They is no doubt that Bengali sweets taste best in the world and Bengal has a golden history of hundreds of years in this field and they have invented many new sweets.Â The creativity in sweet making and its artistic presentation was something that undoubtedly brought fame to Bengal. The sweet shop spoils you for choice with extensive options, with each having a unique taste.Â The shop itself a legend in the world of Bengali sweets makers. All sweets are excellent, but my all time favorites are Golap SandeshÂ and Kadaisutir Khsata Kachuri.Â They have been mastering their hands on Indian sweets. They serve some lip smacking sweets without compromising the quality.

Being a Bengali I really love to eat sweets, either it is a sondesh or rosher misti.There are many sweet shops in Kolkata, some of them very famous since long back,this joint is one of them . Striving hard through the legacy of some of the other well known names in this field, Nepal Sweets has grown with time by building its own reputation and positive vibe in this field, by serving fine quality sweets and other savories since a long time now. For this particular brand, it is not only about the quality.

Bengali confectionery is all about various types of sweet. and a bong canâ€™t live without having sweets. in every sweet shop you will find authentic and traditional sweets as well as varieties of new generationÂ sweets. apart from the sweets if you ever went to a sweet shop in the morning then you know that the smell ofÂ fried foods like Singara,Kachuri with aloor dom,round shaped fried kochuri. from my childhood memoryÂ when i used to go to the school in the morning,everyday those fried kachuris are one of my secondary meal in the tiffin time. my personal favorite sweet is rosogolla and selective sondesh like kachagolla,chap sondesh & any type of kora paker misti made with kheer.Â recently i and my fellow foodie friends went to sweet shop which is quite very famous and very old where we tried varieties of sweets.
                                                                ...

#Food: Known for their out of the box mistis. Love their rosomalai, veg chop, sandesh(s).

Being a student of Diocesan, this place was more of fantasy than just a sweet shop!
This area really lacks sweet shops so it is the only ray of hope!
During the school days, an important agenda was having their CHOWMEIN SINGHARA! Yes it's delicious! We used to bribe each other saying "do it and i will treat u with.."
* The veg chop tastes good too.
They are more efficient in their chats and salty items than the sweets! Their collection of different chats are delightfully delicious!
Well their sweets are good too.

Only con is the price. It's quite costly due to the location.

Nicely located although parking is a problem,Nepal Sweets has been around for decades. From a small inconspicuous place it has slowly improved over the years but is still not in the BIG league of Mishti shops of South Cal. It offers the usual and standard sandesh,kaju katlis,chomchoms etc. Their Sitaphal Payas however is quite different and yummy and a personal favourite. The Kesar jalebis are best had hot so be there at the time they are being fried and enjoy them. Nice and thin and crisp !!

Besides the sweets on offer it is the displayed Menu hanging above the counter which is really something...!!! STOBERY and CHOCOLIT being the piece de resistance!!! Place is popular with the neighbourhood particularily the school girls from across the road. Worth experimenting with as you never know you may savour something !!

Located in the posh area of sarat Bose road, just opposite St John's Diocesan school. I dropped into this joint last week for the first time, in order to give some relief to my tounge which was on fire after having spicy street food.It is quite spacious, and well maintained; the complete store is squeaky clean. They offer a wide variety of various traditional sweets like laddoo, barfi, motipaak,rasgulla, rasmalai, rabri, sandesh, gulabjamun etc; along with that also presents a decent variety of fusion sweets as well. The sweets I tried out over here were- kesar rasmalai( it was superb and the size of the rasgulla was quite bigger as compared to other outlets) the sweet curd over here was just succumbing, it had an excuisite texture; the ratio of the sweetness was just perfect and definitely one of the best "sweet curd" I have ever tried in Kolkata. The savories like veg chops, samosas( though I didn't tried them out) but looked perfect as well. Overall a quality sweet outlet in the nearby vicinity to try out.

Nepal Sweets is a sweet shop located on Sarat Bose Road, just opposite to Diocesan school. It is one of those sweet shops that opens early in the morning with fresh stock of sweets and snacks.

Talking about sweets, there are too many to be named. It includes a combination of traditional and modern sweets like Barfi, Soan Papdi, Gulab Jamun, Rasgulla, Sandesh etc. Nepal Sweets is also into the tradition of chocolate mishti since there are many chocolate based sandesh and stuff available here.

Snacks at morning are like Samosa, Khasta Kachori and stuff but they have chaat and other chatpata snacks in the evening option. Don't know where they prepare those chaats as there is hardly space for a chaat counter inside.

Service is a big thumbs down as it is extremely slow and one has to literally shout to the guys out there at least two or three times to get their work done. The staff there are extremely casual and poorly dressed, or I should say undressed as a guy was just wearing a lungi and nothing on the top (he was in the kitchen though). Also the shop is promoting child labour as a kid was working there serving the customers and packing boxes.

Ambiance wise the store is very poor. It is very dirty and most of the space is wasted inside. The dustbin is overflowing and the place requires a thorough cleanup including dusting.

Over the last few years I have sampled various stuff at Nepal Sweets. Now I have my firm favourites here and they have to be the Potoler Mishti (a must try), the Golap Patar Shondesh and the Shrikhand. The dhoklas aren't too bad but not one of my favourites though my Grandmother used to love them. If you can make puris at home (puris unlike the Bengali luchi is madd out of atta) then do try the Shrikhand with puri. Their kachoria don't go so well with the Shrikhand. The kachori, samosa and other fried stuff are pretty ordinary in my opinion. But many people will probably differ with my opinion as Nepal Sweets is a fairly well renowned place in the southern part of Kolkata.

Located just on the opposite foot of Diocesan, I had been a regular at Nepal Sweets all though my school life. 

They were the first to introduce Chocogolla in the city. One big roshogolla dipped in Chocolate. Their Chinese Shingara and dhoklas are decent but you would never find the owner smiling back at you. Back from the school days when I was really young, the owner hardly ever smiled, at anyone for that metter :D

The mishtis are pretty decent. I am little biased because after school this place was a fun place to go during those days of less restaurants and lesser independence. 

Thumbs up, just for the sake of nostalgia. Nothing extraordinary otherwise.

I have been to Nepal Sweets several times. It is really a very nice shop inclusive of the best taste I ever had anywhere. I have visited several places in India  and tasted a lot of food but I could not find the taste of sweets like in Nepal Sweets. I love the Gulab Patti Sandesh very much.. the sweetness is light but still the outstanding taste and texture. Other sandeshes like Gud ka Sandesh, Butter Scotch, Strawberry Sandesh  were also mouth watering. Apart from sweets, Club kachori, Dhokla and samosas were also very nice.. .Recently they also included the Fresh Juice Corner, I had tried Mousambi Juice there, it was really fresh, sweet and pure.

The most Important thing I would like to mention that.. once I was at the nepal sweets and I met Mr. Sanjeev Kapoor at the shop, he was also there to have a good taste of sweets. It itself explains the popularity and quality of the food items at the store.
I would recommend everyone in Kolkata and visitors to Kolkata  to visit this Shop once. I am sure you can not stop yourself to go there again and again. :)

I have walked into this outlet which is a long standing sweet shop once in a while. Situated on Sarat Bose Rd, near the Rowland Row crossing, it serves various kinds of Bengali and non-Bengali sweets.

They have been known for their chocolate rassogollas, and even tied up with Cadbury at a time. The rassogolla was a standard one, and covered with molten Dairy Milk chocolate. Turned out pretty nice. Not sure if they still do it. At other times I have tried the fairly decent jalebis and malpoas.

Went a few days back and was disappointed. Was a quick lunch and I had the kachori with subzi. Badly served in a sal-pata plate. Everything was cold and the kachoris had hardly any filling (or taste) of pea. A downer straightaway. Had the mishto-doi which they make quite well. Finished off with a piece of their baked rassogolla, which was not too bad either.

Service is usually pathetic. One needs to ask 3-4 times before one is heard. No chance of a friendly smile from the grumpy faces. The man at the counter is expressionless. I wonder when will they ever learn?

One of the legends in the world of sandesh and very famous for gulab patti ( rose petal ) sandesh. The rose petal sandesh is very smooth on the palette and also great to taste but not particularly my favorite. They serve them in cups made from banana leaves. Also the sugar free variety is served in the same way which I really like because of mild sweetness . 

The make a really good lemon sandesh and some rabri to die for. The milk cake and balushai are brilliant too . Don't know why people don't talk of them 

They make really nice savories too. The samosa, kachori and dhokla are brilliant ... especially like the vegetable chop. 

Had gone to pick up some sandesh for home the other day and saw that they have opened a juice counter. ordered pomegranate juice and grape but didn't like them tasted like saccharine and had a very peculiar taste. 

Some people I feel should stick to what they are good at other than trying new things . especially something like fresh juice .

Nepal Sweets is one of the renowned sweet shops of Calcutta and anyone with a sweet tooth especially the sandesh lovers out there have got to have tried out their famed Gulab Sandesh which is actually really lovely and delicate in its flavors. Their Soan Papdi and Chocolate Barfi are according to me its unsung heroes. The Dahi Vada is also very nice and makes for a lovely snack in the summer months. They also have the usual laddus , rasmalai , mishti doi etc which are all good. Samosa's , chops , kachori and so on are available to tickle your savory taste buds as well.

I was sure that the place would have had atleast 5-10 reviews but to my surprise, i am the first one !!! Located on sarat bose road near tea trove, nepal sweets is no less than a landmark in the area, occupying a strategically important point. 

It is referred to as the gulab sandesh shoppe and i feel its one of the best in city followed by the ones served at gupta brothers. This is their flagship item and sells like crazy. Gulab sandesh, always fresh soft and juicy with a very nice aroma are served in cups made of banana leaf and topped with a rose petal. I would suggest one to refrigerate them for an hour or two before having . Other favorites of mine are the gur sandesh, rajbhogs. They have sandesh in strawberry, butterscotch etc flavors as well which are decent. 

They have quite a few snacks on offer as well which include samosas, matar kachoris, dhoklas, chaats etc but i find them all pretty average with samosa being my preferred item of the lot.

Overall, i love this shop for the sweets especially the gulab sandesh, rajbhog which are just amazing but cant appreciate other items to that extent !!!
