LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: This place is at the Wellesley near the Bata more actually. So many Restaurants and food outlets nearby but this place has some reputation for themselves. With a simple name they serve some good quality food and with variety to you.

AMBIENCE AND STAFF: Not a very big place this is but a decent place to seat and have your lunch and dinner. Two way Sitting arrangement with table and bench to seat, 4x2, Two staffs take the order and sometimes three two. Place is fine and clean.

FOOD: As i say variety then it means they give you options for your needs. They have lots of options for you starting from the lovely Bengali food they serve with Dal, Chaval sabji, if you dont favours that then you also have the Thali system for the veggies and non-veggies. If you are also not satisfies with it then they also provide you with Chinese food. But i went to chinese and took Veg rice from here. The taste was fine and cooked well. Less oily and the rice was also thick enough.

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality is 
good. Sepcially the Bengali food i have seen looked delicious ans was smelling really nice. Quantity is ok. Prices are not high infact its pocket friendly.

CONCLUSION: Thou not a dissatisfying visit. Recomended if you are in Wellesley and looking for some bengali food or thali.

Note: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
