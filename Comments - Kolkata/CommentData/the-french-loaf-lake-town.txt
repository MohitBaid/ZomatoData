This French loaf had opened in Lake Town and I am glad that it has opened here. The quality of pastries, cupcakes is really good and fresh. I have gone for coffee and sandwich and i really liked the way the service had been quick and with a smile. The staff is extremely good and cordial. Even the cakes available are very good and tasty. Please walk in to French loaf as the prices are also very reasonable here.

This outlet of French Loaf is located on the main road leading to Jaya Cinema . It's a small but cosy place . Staffs are well behaved as in other outlets of French Loaf. Had taken a White Forrest cake for a birthday which was good . Like their Red Velvet flavour .

Located near jaya cinema. This is a small coffee shop. The decor is good. The service and the staff is good. We tried the chicken tikka sandwich which was delicious. The crunchy frappe was average. The hot chocolate on the other hand was not at all good. Better not to try it. The baked goods were up to mark though. Overall an average experience.

Decided to visit this place for a coffee on a typical cold Calcutta evening.On entering this cafe we were cordially greeted by the staff, which I feel is lacking in many places these days! Ordered a cappuccino in the first place but then decided to order an apple pie and a choco-lava cake on insistence from the staff to order something along with the coffee.¬†
Now coming to the food.The coffee was served warm not steaming hot which I personally did not mind as I prefer my coffee warm rather than a tongue burning temperature. The coffee was served with almond leaves which had a puff pastry like texture with sugar and almond flakes sprinkled on top.This I felt was a really nice gesture which all coffee shops should adapt. The choco lava cake was slightly warm, moist and gooey just the way any chocolate lover would want it to be. The apple pie was good with a mild sweetness rather than being overly sweet which I have to say is a plus point.
All in all I recommend this place to anyone wanting a quick cup of coffee accompanied with light snacks visiting the area.

This particular outlet of The French Loaf happens to be at Lake town.  A 5 minutes walk from the upfront of Jaya Cinema Hall will land you here. The place apparently looks cosy and has a warm vibe. The cute seating arrangements deserves a thumbs up. However, I chose to order Chocolate Brownie and a bottle of cold drink. Needless to mention,the chocolate brownie was soft and delicious at the same time. I would love to visit this outlet once again.

Rates are so less.....Cold coffee with Ice cream was excellent and the same taste we get in CCD like Devils own n we pay triple of its cost. I would rate 5 out of 5 to French Loaf Lake town.

While usually the chicken quiche is one of my favourites and I haven‚Äôt seen any shop really mess that dish up. Well, French loaf just did. It was very bland we could only find a baked egg which is absolutely tasteless. Very disappointing

A French loaf regular for their brown bread and garlic bread. It's a must in house for breakfast. 
It's a bit expensive but worth every penny and so much better than the regular brown bread. 
Even the garlic bread is quite good.
Coming to the pictures attached with it.
Went there on a Saturday night found only few items left.
As a sucker for cheesecake and red velvet cake picked up this too and it was the perfect guilty pleasure for a sweet tooth like me.
Probably going pick them up a lot often.

Went to the french loaf yesterday. Its situated near jaya multiplex. If you move towards vip lake town then its at your left side.

Tasted 1.irish pastry
And 2. Choco browny shake
1.irish pastry was good. I found it to be "good" not more than that. It wasn't wow!!
2.choco browny shake make me feel giving this review coz it was awful. I could smell coffee flavour there.i could taste something else but not browny. Chocolate flavour was very less.. All in all the blend of everything was pathetic. I told the staff about this. But they could do nothing since the same was written in their recipe may be.
But the good part is the staffs were very polite and humble. One of them took my suggestion and asked me to post the review on zomato as well...

So 3/5 for food,
 4/5 for the staff.

When it comes to best quality cakes in Kolkata the one name that surpasses above all is "The French Loaf". I generally order from many of their outlets, so when they opened one near my home at Laketown I was really glad. Since their inauguration, ordered twice and was not disappointed at all.

Both the red velvet and choco-orange surprise were true delight. So no matter what your occasion is, if it requires a cake, make sure to try the French Loaf. Trust me you will not be disappointed.

Word of caution, it is always recommended to order early, if you go at the last minute chances are that you won't find a good enough cake or the offered choice will limited. Order your choice of cake a few days ahead of your requirement and pick it up on delivery date. The staff are helpful and courteous as well.

My message to management will be to keep up the good work, and never compromise on quality.

Its a new outlet and instead of making customers they are bent towards losing them. We used to eat in other outlet but this outlet is hell bad. The walnut brownie, blueberry and choco danish all weren't fresh at all. For few days i ate then no vat was there, then suddenly vat came. Even after saying it isn't fresh, no response was there as such. Its the last time we went.
