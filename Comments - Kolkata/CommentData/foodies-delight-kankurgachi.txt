It is a small outlet serving burgers,pizza and some snacks.They prepare food freshly,we decided to order some butter corn which was fresh and really tasty,the only drawback was that they took a long time to serve it otherwise it is a great place for reasonably priced snacks.

Was seriously considering going on a diet and then 'Foodies Delight' happened. I found this small food joint in Kankurgchi, within the Pantaloons premises. Best place for grabbing quick bites, they serve delicious sandwich, pastas, good range of bevarages and one simply needs to taste their kulfis which are outstanding.

Guys! This is my fav food destination, and you know what, they have newly, launched  'Kulfi'.
Hey Foodies! You should try once, to believe it. Their kulfis are very delicious but Paan Kulfi is like divine! You will have to have it to believe it.
Guys do hang out here to taste the awesome!

Don't be fooled by the size of the store. The quality and taste of the food makes up more than for it.  They cook it right in front of you, so you know what's really on your platter. The yumilicous food is absolutely superb. Had a burger and pasta - perfectly cooked and just the oozing cheese makes it all the more irresistible. Perfect to fill ur tummy and ur taste buds....keep up the good work

A very small place! Our basic hangout after shopping in Pantaloons. Had tasted burger & pasta & they are really good. They also serve mc Cain's & other ready to eat food. So if anybody is really hungry , can definitely go for it as it is pure Veg & affordable.

Location: Just outside Pantaloons, Kankurgachi.

Sitting in a corner just at the entrance of Pantaloons is this small stall providing crunchy munchy food at pocket friendly prices.
Foodie's Delight has an arrangement of sandwiches, momos and other streety food that would probably make your mid time snack.

The quality of food is good with fresh stock everyday and prices are low.
