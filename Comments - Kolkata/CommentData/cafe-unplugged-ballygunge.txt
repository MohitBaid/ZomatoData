Cafe Unplugged - A pathetic experience.
=====
Location + Intro:

Cafe Unplugged is located near Chai Break, Ballygunge.Â 

I had gone here sometime ago with a friend of mine. At that time, the ambiance was quite dimly lit with a front facing truck added near the gate to enhance the ambiance. I did not like the ambiance and the vibe of the place. The tables were not cleaned properly and quite dirty. The a la carte served to us was also not taken care of and quite dirty.Â 
=====
What i ordered: 

â€¢ Mango and Litchi Coolers - It was more of water than coolers. It just had a touch of flavour. I did not pay so much just for that?

â€¢ Chicken Mayo Sandwich - The sandwich was just very ordinary. I did not find it great.Â 

â€¢ White sauce penne pasta - It was fine. Tasted good too. However, some of the penne pieces were under cooked.
======
Pros:

â€¢ Price is just fine.Â 

Cons:

â€¢ Bad service.
â€¢ Hygiene is badly maintained.
â€¢ Food quality and taste is bad.Â 
=====
Meal for two: 300-600 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 2/5

Food Quantity 3.2/5

Taste 3/5

Presentation 3/5

Hospitality 2/5

Ambiance 2/5

VFM 2.4/5
=====
Conclusion:Â 

I did not have a good experience here. Not recommended.
=====
Unbiased review based on my eating experience.

A cheap yet happening cafe which gives enormous happyness at the end of late night shifts to the corporate people of Salt Lake Sector 5 . I would recommend their pasta to everone as it is just too good with the right dollop of cheesyness and gooeyness . I had been there several times , liked ot for the vibrant atmosphere where you can dance your heart out after a puff of hookah . Overall the place is good with areas of oppurtunities as well , sometimes the crowd gets too cheap and the bar tenders are staring as if you have come from a different planet . Hence if the management can look into this issue , it would be great for us to continue going there .

The ambiance of this place is average. The service is quick and nice. Try out the mixed sauce pasta, it's amazing. Did not like any of the shakes, but the staffs offered a complementary dessert for this. Â Overall it is a good place to hangout.

Have been visiting this place with my friends for few months now. They serve amazing hookah probably the best in the locality. Food is also good what gives them edge over others is that they even serve non veg tried their chicken roulade which is very good and roasted chicken which was amazing as well. A good place and easy on pocket.

Was invited by friends to celebrate a birthday.
Disappointing experience and a wasted evening.

Joint looks poorly designed and decorated. Also the chipped walls and exposed plaster suggest this place has seen better days. Surprising since its opening was hardly a year ago. Dim lighting usually acts as a face-saver for rubbish interior design and furnishings. Here, though, it just compounded the problem. Cushions were musty. The washroom was a horror story and is bio-hazard waiting to happen if not renovated and properly maintained. Heck, the whole place needs a full blown overhaul.
The faulty sound system made the ambience - or lack of it - even more stressful. If that's even possible somehow.

The service wasn't anything to write home about either. Each order took well over thirty minutes to arrive at our table.
As for the food, words like "mediocre" or "sub-par" come to mind. The coffee lacked it's signature bitter aroma and had no real froth even though it was supposed to be of the cappuccino variety. The crispy chilly baby corns were soggy. And although supposedly undercooked by design to "keep it tender", the roasted chicken felt chewy as a cardboard.

Most places would, expectedly, be prompt with billing and payment even with a lack-lustre service, shady ambience and poor food quality.
Not Cafe Unplugged, Ballygunge. They'll make you wait another thirty minutes for the bill too so you can't even leave as soon as you're done. So, at least they're consistent.

Gordon Ramsay would have a ball with this place if he ever did a Kitchen Nightmares show in Kolkata.

The only (barely) saving grace was the staff behaviour. They seemed amiable and our interactions were cordial despite their overwhelming mediocrity and tardiness. Guess that's something.

Most would say that the problem lies with the unprofessional and unskilled staff. In my opinion, it's more of a management's fault and the owners' as well. They need to bring their 'A' game if they'd like to keep this joint from closing within the next year or so.

Would have uploaded accompanying photos. But then again, the low lighting made it damn near impossible to take any worthwhile ones.

Located in the heart of the city same building as CB, it is on the second floor. A comfortable and soothing place with amazing hookah and food. Have been a regular here and tried out many food items the pizza and babycorn are my favorite here they recently have started making waffles which are amazing too. A good place.
