Located in Dum Dum road it is  a very economical biryani outlet. Food is normal. You can't expect anything more at this price range so visit only when no other option is available.

Another biryani joint on Dum dum road - serving very basic level biryani. I went over there last evening to get 1 parcel biryani and at first look I was very amazed - the fresh handi was just arrived and the person at the counter was rearranging the Aloo, mutton, chicken pcs, and rice inside and the smoke exaggerating from it was spreading the lipsmacking scent of the biryani inside. I checked the price and it was very pocket friendly, ordered for 1 special mutton biryani which consists of 2 large mutton pcs with some extra amount of rice but definitely that's not enough for 2 person. This cost me 140 rupees and I went back home.
At night I just put it in the microwave and jumped onto it. Though the rice was nice but the pc of mutton was horrible. Definitely not expected specially in an area like dumdum where number of Biryani joints are higher than number of street lights. So if they bank upon only the low price they are keeping, I am afraid it won't sustain for long as no other joints on dumdum road charge much for biriyani.

I had the biryani from here . It is very cheaply priced but the food is not good. The rice has a lot of aatar added to it and the meat is not very soft.

The biryani is cheap. But then the biryani is not worth it. At all. The meat is not soft and has lots of fibres. And it's very oily and has a lot of scent.

New review: The quality has changed. It tastes a lot better now. Tender chicken with long rice. Its plain but quality is overall okay.

Older thought: A roadside eatery in Dum Dum. The biriyani served here is not that great. A restaurant opposite to this place named Kolapata serves much better biriyani. The chicken chaap tasted nothing like chaap. A really bad experience.

The best biriyani i have in north Kolkata, it can beat Aminia & Dhaka biriyani in comparison of taste & quantity, its chkn & mutton piece will nt dissapoint u in this range. Dont underestimate this biriyani house considering its menu's price (Chkn-60, Mutton-80) just taste & provide ur fdbk. Im confidently assuring u u will be satisfied.
