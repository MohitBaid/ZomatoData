Good ambience. Food wasn't bad. And quantity was good for two people. This place is usually cozy and not crowded. So it's a good place if you want to go out to spend some quality time talking. Also it's very much affordable. So definitely coming backðŸ¤—

Found a hidden gem near airport area, as there very limited options available. We only tried Continental, though food was good there Continental has a special Indian twist and quantity is also appreciable.

But they have very little options in there menu that's the only negative I found.. overall nice place with classy ambience ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡

Have been to this place like ten to fifteen times. It merely 5 minutes walking distance from my home.
Nice decor and very posh and sofisticated.
Coming to food, it's a bit pricey and the food quality and quantity is just average.

Great environment with the location. Food quality and quantity is more than sufficient for two people. Help and support from the hotel assistant is out of the mark.

So we drop down to this place while coming back from airport and find this place the nearest best one. It was Sasthi! So they had a full Bengali buffet; though we didn't go for that but a la carte! We ordered seafood soup which was quiet good. After that in starter there was prawn n chicken malai kabab- both were just finger licking, followed by mix Hakka n schezwan noodles and grilled prawn with caper basil sauce. Noodles was good but prawn was a bit uncooked! 
Ambience wise they have a tiny place with decent interior.
Servicing was too good.
Overall experience is good

Just had a sudden visit today for some official purpose where I found that an "Oriental Festival" is going on from 5th-15th August. At reasonable rates, they have all options ranging from starters to desserts. Just to give a try I have ordered Indonesian fried rice which to my expectations was amazingly tasty.Â It was tossed it red sauce with chicken & egg with addition to red & yellow bell peppers, baby-corn, brocolli, beans, gondhoraj leaves & herbs. The bite of gondhoraj leaves while chewing the rice was the best experience in total. Nice ambiance, helpful staff & pretty bamboo-themed decor added to its beauty.. Happy eating.. :)

We stayed in this hotel and had breakfast (a la carte). Hotel accommodation is excellent and also their restaurant. We had boiled eggs, bread butter jam, onion uttappam and idli. I must admit uttappam was too good, idli was also nice. Chutney and sambar were also good. Quantity was sufficient and price was reasonable. Room service was appreciable. We enjoyed our breakfast here and I think other food items and actual service at the restaurant should be good.

First let me say abt the posetive aspect of this fancy dining place. It is open 24 hrs that mean food anytime you need. Good ambience with polite and gd staff. Has a parking space. 

Now coming to the negative side, food is not soo good considering the price, during late ni8 chinese and continentals are not available.  So options limited. They should work on their food availability as they are 24 hrs diner.

Well turned up for dinner at Ethnotel near Airport. Ambience was good, low soft music playing in the background. Had a Cold drink for welcome drink. Followed by Chicken Manchow Soup which was not so good, the noodles provided was stale, I repeat stale!!! For Starters we ordered Chicken Malai Kebab, which was very sweet and the topping had too much melted cheese, the chicken was a bit hard as well. For Salad we ordered a Greek Salad, which I felt was the only thing fresh containing Green and Red Capsicum, Cucumber, Olives,  Carrots, Lettuce, Vinegar and Paneer.  For Main Course we had Butter Nan which had no Butter!!!! Dal Fry was OK OK again a bit sweet. Chicken Fried Rice which hardly had any Chicken, the Rice was again hard felt was left overs from the afternoon had to leave it. The Chilly Chicken was again not made well, was sweet. Finally we had a ice cream for Desserts. Not a satisfying dinner.@

Went there with a non-veg lunch buffet voucher (Rs.650 for 2) fromâ€‹ nearbuy. We were welcomed with soft drinks (thumbs-up and sprite). Then from the buffet menu we choose to have chicken man chow soup, Russian salad and chicken malai kabab (it was wow) as the starter. The soup and the salad was very tasty. The malai kabab was extraordinary, soft juicy pieces of chickenâ€‹ covered completely with malai (yummy!!).
In the main course we had chicken fried rice, butter nun (it was super soft), dal makhani (it was beyond expectation) and chicken karai. Lastly  in the deserts we had 2  scoops of vanilla ice cream each. All the food were really awesome both in quality and quantity. Nice ambience, prompt service, and good staff. It's more than pocket friendly if you're having the buffet voucher.

Extremely friendly warm and cordial service. They do care about reputations for which they don't advise any rotten and cold storage foods which is really commendable.
They recommended us the plain Bengali food which we had with patience and loads of joy. You can definitely hop in here just a little away from airport for brunch, lunch or munch. It's 24hours open, so Yay to that.

We went there on 31st Dec night. The restaurant looks bright and clean. We were not in a mood for animal protein. So, we opted for tandoori roti, malai kofta and baby corn-mushroom masala. The roti was made to perfection. Both the side dishes tasted really well. We ended up with ice-cream. The portion size of all the dishes were quite well and the placed scored with their hospitality, too. Together, it was a pleasant experience.

Extremely unsatisfied. Zero hospitality. Small rooms. AVERAGE FACILITIES AND FOOD. TOOK ADVANCE PAYMENT FOR THE RENT AND BILL WAS NOT READY EVEN AFTER INFORMING THEM ONE HOUR IN ADVANCE BEFORE CHECK OUT. THIS CAUSED DELAY IN GETTING TO THE AIRPORT IN THE PEAK TRAFFIC.
CAN NOT GIVE .5 STAR. SO GIVING ONE.

I checked in to Ethnotel for a 24hr stay. The front desk staff is totally confused about the policies and services, and the restaurant staff and reception guys give you contradicting information. They even got in to argument over the food package in a very arrogant manner.

We Oder fish thali 
Food quality was regular and ok ok 
Price is 400 per fish thali

Good food, OK price, open 24 by 7. We ordered Lat Mai Kai, which I found too sour for my palette and not the authentic Lat Mai Kai that one usually gets in a good restaurant.Â 
The dÃ©cor is modest and sleek. The stuffs are courteous.Â 
We then had Chicken Stroganoff and Chicken Steak sizzler, both were good, but nothing extra-ordinary. Next time we visit, we will try something from their Indian menu.
