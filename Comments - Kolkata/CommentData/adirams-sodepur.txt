ADIRAMs....a newcomer sweet n bakery joint. They have 3 outlets.. Sodepur station Rd,Madhyamgram,Barasat helabattola.
Adiram has an exclusive collection of innovative & fusion sweets,along with snacks,cakes,cookies etc.
We tried PANEER JILABI,CHOCOLATE SANDESH,BAKED ROSOGOLLAS,SPECIAL SAMOSAs.
Chocolate sandesh is always lip smacking awhrn they melt inside.Samosa is served with tumeric CHUTNEY is better than any other samosas.But,Paneer jilabi @Rs18/-each,is the topper,very soft and with each n every bite,u will get absorbed in its delicacy.
They have a nice decor,full AC,courteous staffs with prompt service.Overall trustworthy address for sweets n confectionaries,as they process food items in hygenic way with own supervisation.
My experience demands another visit asap.

Located beside Sriniketan in Sodepur, this newly opened sweet shop is surely a good venture. We were having traditional sweets from Madan Mohan, Shibani Subal but Adiram's is offering us some different kind of sweets and snacks (pure veg) some of them are very tasty. I tried their maha pattese, kaju laddoo, choco roll, Tirupati laddoo in sweet dish and corn hot dog in snacks. I really liked the maha pattese and Tirupati laddoo and corn hot dog was too good. Choco rolls were good though I didn't like the Kaju Laddoo much. The costs are also very pocket friendly. They also serve eggless cakes, 1 pound costs about 450 bucks. Pieces are also available. They have a separate section of paneer made delicacies. There is very small seating arrangement. It's a must go to taste their various sweets and snacks.

Located on Sodepur main road,on the line of Sriniketan. They really have a wide variety of innovative sweets with cute names. Fruit jelly pastries and veg confectionaries also available. Chocolate available in cute boxes. Tried 3sweets and although very innovative and delicious to look at,were slightly downer on taste.
The paneer jilipi was the topper though.

A very unique take on sweets. They have some exclusive collection of sweets, like paneer jilapi, dry rosogolla, mathura peda, pineapple sandesh, baked mihidana, they also have a good variety of veg snacks like corn pie, paneer patties, dhoklas. The pastries are good too. The stuff's are very courteous. Overall a new take on the old legacy of Bengali sweets. There are two outlet's in Barasat, one near champadali more beside vishal megamart, one near colony more helabottola, below SBI. The pics are from colony more outlet.

There are few sweet & confectionary shops in Madhyamgram, Â but this one is unique. It is fully air conditioned store, which has Bengali common sweets like Rosogolla, Mishti Doi, Sandesh, Kaju Barfi, Jalebi, Singara, Ghee, Laddu etc along with fruit cake, patties, Dhokla everything. They even prepare Baked Rosogolla, Baked Mihidana, Baked Chomchom etc, they accept Card payment & PayTM payments too, it has another branch at Madhyamgram Rubber Factory bus stoppage & 2 other stores at Barasat (Beside Vishal Mega Mart & Helabot tola). In short this sweet & confectionary store is a must visit.
