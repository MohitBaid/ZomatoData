The service was very nice plus i had cheese garlic bread which was very chessy and the way they serve hookah is very nice and are very reasonable.. 

Alcohol is also very reasonable and the sound system is the one i loved the most.. 

Altogether a visit is worth

So I went here with my girlfriend thinking that the burgers,which look amazing, must taste Amazing.
Alas, I was left disappointed, as the 4 mini burgers were not anywhere close to what we expected. Probably we should have tried the big ones(surely there will be a next time).
The staff is helpful, no doubt about that. And the interior is pretty cool. But its not, and i repeat, its not a place to go on a date after 3 months 😂
The loud music is a bit too much. With friends or lets say, on a friday night, this would be the place.
Coming to the next item, we had chicken on bone. The dip was really good a d the chicken was crunchy enough. Could have been prepared better, considering the time they take. 
I have been pretty harsh in the review but its coz I was left a bit disappointed.

Located right beside 10 Downing Street, at the IT sector hub, sector 5, this place has the interiors which will immediately win you over. Red lights, checkered floor, an aesthetic place! 
Coming to the food, we ordered the very famous burger platter(consisting of 2 veg and 2 non-veg burgers) and a plate of chicken broasted wings, 2 pieces. The food quality was very average. The burgers are a hoax, their colors being the only attractive thing about them. I'd suggest have a single burger instead of 4 of these small ones. However, the wings were good, especially the dips served with them were lovely. 

Also, there were certain funny things about this restaurant. Their basins are actually kadais, believe me, metal kadais! Their chicken chimney is installed inside their washroom! Lastly, they serve water in a roadside tea glass cups. XD

The volume of the music is too high here, responding to a phone call gets impossible if you're inside the restaurant. A huge drawback. 

Overall, a 3.5 stars out of 5.

Heard about this place from a friend of mine. The staff is really polite, they will even help you with your order. The food is outstanding, I was curious about the pink color of the burgers and got to know it's pure natural color of the Raspberry. The interior is quirky and cool. I had chicken strips which were really delicious , next thing which I had was Raspberry bun with shredded lamb - I will never forget the taste of this burger, would definitely suggest my buddies to try it. We ordered fries even and had milkshakes which was Raspberry and Chocolate. 
Overall I really had good time with good food.

The best thing is the interior and food. A perfect blend of old American and European design will take you to an era of Elvis Presley or Jim Morrison. A bottle of beer and a platter of fried chicken dipped in mustard sauce... Sorted for a blissful evening! And the phonebooth... thats the smoking room. Its an old English phonebooth... Lovely!

Visited the place on the first day of 2018. They have just acquired their liquor license. So you may not get everything which is on the menu. But try their cocktails. We had cosmopolitan, whiskey sour and tequila sunrise all of which were expertly made. The food is outstanding. We had tit-bit burger platter, mushroom sauce and one other kind of buffalo wings. The chicken sizzler is slightly unconventional. Likeability depends on aversion to variety. Thumbs up for the smart interiors. But service speed could be slightly improved!! But the waiter (young guy upstairs ) did his best. The delay was due to the kitchen! But all in all, the place is totally worth your dough. Looking forward to going back again.

Genuine Broaster Chicken - now a well known brand mainly known for their Broaster Chicken, in simple words kind of fried chicken like KFC. Okay so now here is a catch-up it is not only a Broaster Chicken outlet, it serves some delicious mughlai, Indian food along with some great beverages.

So, you can say it is a complete restaurant in its own way.

Location:
___________
This branch is located at sector 5. Few meter away from RDB, just opposite to Opium.

Decoration:
______________
Very intelligently decorated, it's having two floors. Wall is mainly decorated with the factory theme - having hardware like pipes and helmet. Giving it pretty cool look.

Food:
__________

© Starters
______________
✓ Fish and Chips - 4 pieces of mouthwatering bhekti fish fry comes with French fries. Served with garlic BBQ sauce, and two other dips. Just excellent.

✓ Curried BBQ - it comes with 6 pieces. And woowwwww.. this dish is something superb. Chicken wings with a big size cooked with BBQ sauce and curry leaf. Owsum.

© Main Course
_________________

✓ Mutton Gawlauti Roganjosh - this dish is a mix of gawlauti and Roganjosh. It's not the soft like gawlauti kebab. But the shape is like that, and you will have that bone less mutton in that. Very nice. But if you expect the gawlauti kebab softness- this will not surely serve the purpose.

© Beverages:
______________

✓ Green Apple Mint Mojito - excellent one. Just a perfect refreshner.

✓ Coco Mango Mojito - perfect blend of coconut flavour with mango. It's very very nice. But earlier one is best for sure.

© Dessert:
____________

✓ Misti Doi Lavender Mousse - this is something very unique. Misti Doi blended with lavender ( one kind of mint). It's good. But what I felt- if the item is more soft( not that deep freezed) that would be more delicious. Otherwise it make this dish close to ice cream.

Another dessert I tasted which is just presented to me from team Genuine Broaster. A big thanks for that.

✓ Chocolate Samosa with Mango ice-cream - I loved the uniqueness of the dish. That is bang on. A small suggestions - if possible just make the Samosa with hot chocolate pudding in it. The melting hot chocolate comes out from the Samosa will be heavenly in taste.

Overall a huge experience I had over there.

Special mention: the owner and the person make the beverages. They know how to treat a customer and make them feel great. A big thumbs up for that.

All that cost 1464 INR.

**** Special Note : they have just launched their BAR section. And as per the information I had - it should be already open.

To Management: it was a warm experience to be there. Hope to see you again in near future.

To All - go there. Give it a try. You will love@ it
And till my next review over here.. happy fooding.

Food are good at this place, however I did not like the sizzlers, it reads different in menu and seems different and tastes different.
Rest all were pretty good, lack of crowd, in entire 2hours spent we were the only customers.
The waiter is very decent and good. He was such decent to ask after every good served about the feedback, which is absolutely an awesome work by that guy, in case delay in making a dish...he was updating even about the status of it by himself.

This place is an absolute beauty to be and eat at. Located near SDF, Sector 5, Saltlake, this place serves all from all kind of Continentals, Italians to many others.
To start off with, the place is vivid with it's stunning ambience, music and service. There is pretty much nothing more perfect with the ambience you could get to be in, the service also is commendable, the music is a tad bit loud but good in choice.
Now to the main part, the Food is great, everything we ordered except the shakes were absolutely delicious. They were well presented and in good quantity as well, so nothing to complain about. The beverages were good too but the shakes though, were a bit off, except the Jammy Strawberry. They tasted bland and had nothing much to drool about, which is why I rated the place a Four. Apart from that, everything is delicious and worth visiting.
What we had :-
1. Creamy Broasted Chicken - must try
2. Legendary Broasted Wings - must try
3. Pizza Margherita Meatza
4. Broasted Burger - must try
5. Lamb Roganjosh - must try
6. Wok Tossed Rice
7. Chilli Garlic Chicken
8. Sizzling Chicken Satay
9. Snicky Chocolate
10. Jammy Strawberry
11. Chocolate Shake
12. Green Tea

Overall, this place is definitely worth every penny and a must try for everyone. I'd just advise to stay off the Chocolate Shakes for safety, order anything from the beverages and you'll be fine.

Food - 4/5
Ambience - 5/5
Service - 4.5/5

Let me start with Decor. It's a old school retro minimalistic look which we liked. Sitting arrangement and music is good. Music was loud but you can talk, so I would appreciate the sense of the person who set the music setup. Now coming to the service, it was really really good, I am giving 5 for service. Behavior of the restaurant team was very friendly. We ordered Broasted chicken bucket, beer soaked steak, meatza which we found very good especially serving quality and decor of the food. We didn't get time to serve mocktails to our taste buds as we were running short on time, would like to taste that.
Pros:
Service too good.
Decor classic.
Food quiet impressive but need small improvement on some part.
Cons:
They don't serve alcohol. They are starting alcohol service shortly ( Date not sure).
They don't serve beef or pork (Though they are justifying their name selling maximum dishes of chicken).
Price little bit overpriced.

Discovered by accident while scouting around for lunch in Sector5...these Mini meat pizzas are more than a mouthful and the set of 5 is more than enough for most single diners. In fact taken along with a side dish they will do well for 2 as well.

The topping has chicken cubes as well as sausages, a tangy sauce, Noodles all topped by cheese. It takes a bit of time to prepare 20-25 minutes but its worth the wait. Price 189 AI.

Hoping they will introduce it in the other outlets too.

Dropped in for today's lunch.
Located near rdb cinemas sector 5, beside the fbb, a cool place for hang out with a old American diner charm.
Though the place is quite cozy but service is not upto the mark. Not that lyk the servers are not ngh polite or not helpful but they are not swift or well trained.
Now coming to the food, we tried Buffalo chicken wings: kung pao and narangi siracha; though they mentioned these two types are spicy sauces but not per our taste. Narangi siracha was quite good and tangy in taste but kung pao was complete bland in taste.
Next we have Classic chicken mini Burger platter. It contains 4 small burgers served with fries and cheesy jalapeño deep; two chicken burger, one veg patty burger and one cheese burger. Pretty colorful - just need a little bit of spice touch. But sorry to say the cheese burger was not good at all😷. According to the description in menu card three small burgers supposed to be served. A honest opinion to the team GBC that please serve only three, its completely f9. Just don't add such a tasteless one only to increase the serving size.
We also had cold coffee and snicky chocolate shake bomb. Coffee was regular; nothing extra ordinary. But the shake bomb was real winner. Full with kitkat oreo gems and whipped cream. Too chocolatey 😘😘😘
This eatery is relaxed cozy option in sector 5 for casual dining where pocket pinch comes under 1000 bucks for 2.

I visited this place on my birthday for lunch with two of my favourites and I absolutely loved the place.  The place has a real cool interior and the smoking room is a red booth like the ones found in London which is very cute. The seating is also amazing. They have a duplex seating and the interiors are really cool.
Coming to food, we ordered broaster chicken basket and pizza.
The chicken was amazingly tasty and the dips too but the pizza was so so.
Overall this place is a real cool one to hang out!

Location:In the same complex that houses 10, Downing Street and Kareem's,Sector V,this one's located exactly opposite Opium.

Ambience:I loved the 'industrial chic marries American diner' vibe of the place.5/5 for the ambience.

Food-i dropped in here after catching an afternoon show of Thor: Ragnarok (sidenote:whoaaaaaaa!!!!!).

I ordered-

LAMB ROGANJOSH BURGER(2.75/5)-
First things first, I've been wanting to try out these burgers with coloured buns that have been rocking the food scene off late.Never before I've been this disappointed.I don't know whether it was the natural ingredients used to colour the buns that was at fault but the buns had a super weird texture and mouth-feel,almost gloopy and gross.The patty was extremely nondescript and for a lamb patty, that's a crying shame.The only saving grace was the potato wedges which were "perfection" as a certain Mr.Chandler Bing would have called them.The accompanying dip was also on point.

CARAMEL CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE(3/5)-When you read 'lava' in a dessert you expect things to ooze out.This one was more like a lightly steamed,caramel-flavoured pudding with a chocolate glaze on top.Right after I cut it open, not even a drop of caramel oozed out of it and that really pissed me off.

Price: Exorbitant.This whole ordeal left me poorer by 500 rupees and boy,was I not happy about it.

Service:The place was stark empty on a Sunday evening.The minute I entered,one of the staff members gave me a quizzical look as if I had lost my way and stumbled into that place.After this initial irritation, I went upstairs and after getting seated,I had to get tortured by the most atrocious Punjabi songs for the next 1 hour.Crass Punjabi songs in an American diner?It was more unwelcome than Hela in Asgard ;) . I've never seen staff this unenthusiastic and the bartender and manager (??) seated at the bar looked bored out of their wits.

Verdict:Well,unless they fix their burger bun and service issues, I'm gonna listen to Nicki Minaj and avoid this place like the plague.😂😂

Thank you Zomato for letting me know about this place. Location is quite easy to find just opposite  Opium in Sector 5. The Decor and Lighting are super cool. It gives you a feel of an American eatery.  The ambience was good and the staff was courteous. The smoking booth which is shaped like a telephone booth looks funky.

Coming to my order, I went for Small Tits-Bits Burger Platter, Creamy Boasted Chicken and Chul-bhul soda. The broasted chicken was nothing but fried chicken which was lip-smacking, chul-bhul soda was plain masala coke which tasted normal and the platter contained 4  mini burgers. All the four burgers were of different colours and with different patty. Honestly when the Platter was served it looked so good but I didn't like their taste at all. 

This place is very nicely made but food quality needs to improve.

Takes an hour to make one dish.
And the taste after one hour of hard work is equal to 2 mins of cooking.  I would rate this place simply 1. Pathetic service. Terrible food. And then they try to make it up by cooking garlic bread which takes another half an hour.  It seems after taking an order they go to the vegetable shop to buy veggies for the dish and then they cook. And even if you are taking an hour or so your food should taste like one heavenly dish but no. No wonder why this place was so empty.
They had just one order and still messed it up.

This joint opposite Opium will surely blow your mind.The ambience, the decor gives you the feel of some American Cowboy's Farm which I totally loved, with live sports being forecast at one corner of the cafe.The smoking booth is one of the attraction of this cafe.
Coming to the food....aaah! Loved it!
We started with butter scotch and raspberry shakes which is just yum.Fish fingers which was a rockstar dish which 3 awesome dips.Then we headed with our pizza which just melted inside the mouth,I completely loved it.
And lastly the dessert,I have no words for it.I would suggest everyone to try this,I am sure you'd be thankful to me for the rest of your life.

Visited for the first time today quite liked the place. Ambiance and decor is nice. Ordered for spicy broasted crispy chicken. It was real good crispy on the outside and juicy tender chicken inside. Then ordered for rogani grilled chicken burger it was delish! But the beer soaked sumac spiced grilled chicken steak wasn't good at all! The combination of spices didn't quiet go well as per my taste buds!

I would start with the people! They were very welcoming, me and my friend were the only customer they had at that time! We first ordered the blue lagoon and green apple mint! Which was kindaa good! And in food we ordered alfredo pasta (which was a recommendation) and some broaster chicken item which I don't remember! The chicken dish looked just like kfc chicken and tasted somewhat the same except that the chicken here was more tender and juicier, then we moved to the pasta which looked great with garlic breadsticks on both sides and tasted just like it should and it did jusice to its name! It would have been fun had there been more people in the resto!

I can't see how people aren't realizing that the interiors are pretty much like that of a small town bar or some place that feels very known for some reason and it is fantastic from the decor to the lighting and I absolutely love the ambience here.
It's a place where friends can hang out and it's in vicinity of IEM so they are in luck.
Just one thing is missing-a jukebox!
I'd absolutely love to see a real jukebox here, adding to the already ecstatic ambience, playing some tunes from Alan Wake's diner or something.
Coming to the food, it's decent enough, I believe.Well, it's not a new taste but it isn't bad and definitely is a treat for your tastebuds but that's all about it.
I'll try the new dishes on Monday and I'll update my review as well.
Thanks for tuning in.

Food was good. Decor was great. Ambiance always nice. A huge downside is the service. Too slow. So slow that we had to cancel our order half way.
Improve that nd sure 4 rating.

Visited for the first time today quite liked the place. Ambiance and decor is nice. Ordered for spicy broasted crispy chicken. It was real good crispy on the outside and juicy tender chicken inside. Then ordered for rogani grilled chicken burger it was delish! But the beer soaked sumac spiced grilled chicken steak wasn't good at all! The combination of spices didn't quiet go well as per my taste buds!

I would start with the people! They were very welcoming, me and my friend were the only customer they had at that time! We first ordered the blue lagoon and green apple mint! Which was kindaa good! And in food we ordered alfredo pasta (which was a recommendation) and some broaster chicken item which I don't remember! The chicken dish looked just like kfc chicken and tasted somewhat the same except that the chicken here was more tender and juicier, then we moved to the pasta which looked great with garlic breadsticks on both sides and tasted just like it should and it did jusice to its name!

This place is the most relaxing place in sector 5 with some amzing english music, good food and good staff service..
The decor is really good gave me the vibe of old college  hangouts. But basically their theme is american based i guess.
This place offers you good combo which is really reasonable and sufficient for two people..( Guys if i say combo then its a must try combo here very pocket friendly).
Food as i said earlier is really good and the hookah is served very innovatively in a cage and is very creative and flavourable too.
Must try things here are:
1) Palanag tod drink.
2) Hookah
3) Tex mex French fries tossed with cheese and yummy garnishing.
4) Rosy trip.

Genuine Broaster chicken has revamped their menu introducing new and improved dishes.So this was our destination for good food and long pending gossip sessions.As we entered ,the red phone booth shaped smoking room took our attention.Selfie sessions near this is a must.The place is tiny with neat decor and quirky lighting.The ceiling is fitted with bakery flour bags filled with lights giving it a feel of the starry night .We seated ourselves in the upstair section beside the bar counter.It was a dry day so we opted for hookah in double apple flavour instead.The hookah was well made .For food we went with indian as they were not serving sizzlers that day.For starters we decided to taste the Lamb rogan josh burger and chilli pepper chicken.The burger was a deep pink burger bun stuffed with juicy patty with a flavour of roganjosh masala and extra cheese toped with veggies served with a side of crispy wedges and mayo dip.The chilli pepper chicken had a strong flavour of pepper to it quite a change from the usual chilli chicken.The manager was up for a chat and informed that the burger bun is colored with juices from beetroot which lends the pink color to the bun.It was in his suggestion that we tried the mutton galauti rogan josh ,crunchy butter chicken and lacchha paratha for the mains.The paratha was crispy on the outside and soft  as you bite in.As i took a bite of the paratha dipped in the crunchy butter chicken gravy ,i could taste the creamy butter gravy lightly flavoured with pepper not too overpowering.The chicken though was a little and lacked salt.The galauti on the other hand was soft patty shaped with a spicy gravy topping it.For dessert ,we opted for the brownie with ice cream and warm caramel lava cake.On our request they put a scoop of vanilla with the lava cake as well but i  think it tasted better with the ice cream.The brownie was soft and warm but for me the lava cake with a caramel centre wins the dessert​ round.Looking forward to taste their bar menu next time.Superb service and great food -all I could ask for.

Firstly the ambience was amazing, great music playing in the background, nicely decorated warm and coziness added to the place. Also a very well behaved staff. Coming back to the food, it was our first visit there, so we pretty much tried everything that we could possibly have, fried chicken, burgers, jalapeño fries and shakes. Everything had an unique taste, would 100% recommend to try the shakes. Also they have introduced a new diverse menu, and we had a glimpse of it, would visit soon with friends to try the new dishes. Ask the server for suggestion or to recommend you with popular dishes. Haven't been in such a restaurant ever, with such well behaved staff.

Buffalo wings were excellent , burger was so so, but I recommend them to use better (read: softer) buns. Broasted chicken was lacking salt. 3/5 only due to the decor and buffalo wings. I wouldn't want to visit again.

This place seemed intriguing and hence we tried it out. We used to always see it empty and wonder why. When we ate there, we understood. 

We decided to have dinner here after a movie. The place was totally empty even on Sunday night. We ordered the fried chicken platter with 2 pieces of all 3 varieties and 3 dips, chili chicken and tarbuj cola. Surprisingly at a chicken place, what we ended up liking the most was the beverage. The fried chicken platter was just okay, hot masala fried chicken was a bit of a let down. The chili chicken too was not well made and we could not each much. 

Even though the place is nicely made and has an overall attractive theme and decor, food quality was certainly not up to the mark.

Visited on 9 July 2017.

This place being right below the missuses office block had been on our go to list for long.On entering the decor seemed pretty swell,quirky and newage and with some fun edm playing on a huge big screen.With extremely polite wait staff one feels comfortable the moment one walks in.Coming to the best part the food.We'd ordered for Thai chicken sticks and a Meatzza.The half i am deducting from the rating is mostly because of the Thai chicken stick which looks nothing like what it does on the menu and also seemed a bit underwhelming.Not that it was bad but it doesn't at all do justics to its name or the price.There is nothing thai about it..no flavour zilch.Now,coming to the showstopper the Meatzza.Its basically nachos topped with more than generous amount of sherred lamb,sliced sausages and some more bacon with tomato and olive.The sause the topping was tossed in was the most amazing sause I've had in a very long time.It seemed like a concoction of sour creme, pepperoni sauce,bbq sauce and other stuff which i couldnt guess.All this topped with generous amout of cheese and baked.The dish was mind blowing and beats my till now favourite Nachos platter from Affra deli too by a big margin.I do wanted to try their fires topped with meat and sauces and the meat burger sliders but then had to save it for the next time cause the Nachos had left me so full.Overall a funky/quirky place with a party like vibe and some great food.

It was our first visit to this place. Located in the heart of sector-5 - chicken lovers will love the place. Decoration is tastefully done and chique. Now about the food - finally Kolkata has something better than KFC. The broaster chicken basket was yummy and we were first to order Assorted Broaster Wings platter. For dessert we rose jamun icecream. 
Overall experience was good and will visit again to try various platters.
Suggestions - service can be quick, waiters should have knowledge about the menu.

A fried chicken food joint serving alcohol along with it is all Kolkata needed! And it’s here as the Genuine Broaster chicken, I’m a lover, worshipper of fried chicken nothing could be better than these for foodies like us. This is a vast chained outlet headquatered in the USA, targeting to open it’s franchise all over India by this year. The USP is their broaster pressure cooked chicken with the unique dips and the amazing burgers. The visit to sector v outlet in salt lake was very refreshing and memorable! This is located exactly in the srijan complex at extreme end of it just beside the FBB. The entrance has cool and funky look to it with unique wall graffitis and vintage sitting arrangements.

Starting right from the Chulbul soda to the ending a beautiful meal on the Rose Jamun Ice Cream, there is nothing I did not enjoy that evening. 

So I recently dropped into Genuine Broaster Chicken to try the good ol’ chicken but ended up trying a number of specials and new dishes that the chef is coming up with. 

Some of the favourites out of the mega spread that I tried included the Curried barbequed Buffalo wings and the Fish and Chips. While the Buffallo Wings are sweet, tangy and spicy all at the same time, the smokey flavour induced in the wings is unmissable. The fish and chips is very fresh. Fleshy fingers of fish crump rolled and fried till dark golden, are purely satisfying and are the perfect mouthful on a Pujo Evening. 

We also got a chance to order some beautiful mains, the two most favourite dishes out of the ones that were ordered were the Mutton Galauti Roganjosh and the Grilled Fish. 

The mutton prep came with the sides of lacha parathas that were skilfully broken for us to tuck into them easily. The paratha itself was so good that you didn’t need anything else to go with it, but the mutton galautis in the roganjosh gravy were strictly unmissable. 

The Grilled fish was my favourite dish of the evening. That fish steak satisfies your eyes before you put the delicious bits into your mouth. You have to devour that dish to understand what I am trying to say. 

We swiftly moved into desserts with the the Rose Jamun Ice Cream and the Chocolate Samosas served with mango icecream and I loved it. 

Do try these dishes the next time you drop into the Sector 5 outlet.

Food :

* Curried buffalo barbeque wings : One of the best buffalo wings I've head in a while. The iwngs were nice and crispy with the sticky sweet sauce just perfectly snuggling the wings. Loved it.

*Broaster basket : A basket full of fries, these too coated in a rich sauce. Loved this.

*Fish and chips : The fish was of supreme quality. The chips were nice and crispy. Loved this as well.

*Mutton galauti roganjosh : This recipe is developed by chef Samyamay and I absolutely loved it. The gravy was jcie and rich. The Paratha was flaky. Reccomend.

*Grilled fish : Hands down the best of the lot. I can go on and on praising about this dish, it still wouldn't be enough. Amazingly buttery fish with an even more amazing sauce. Tasted heavenly.

The woody decor and the yellow lights give this place a very positive soothing kind of a vibe. Definitely a must visit.

Broaster chicken is doing well... But this outlet is bit special considering all the aspects need to be considered for reviewing a resturant... Ambience n decor is just perfect... Also the music was rocking... Service was bit slow but you can consider it if the food were good enough... And in this field Chef Samyamay done unbelievably well... A special curated menu by him is going to be available very soon... We tried some of them like...

❤ Snicky chocolate shake ~ Awesome...

❤ Green apple mint mojito ~ Extremely refreshing...

# Pomegranate iced tea ~ Decent one...

# Chulbul soda ~ It's basically masala cold drinks... Nothing else... But presented in a very unique way...

❤ Curried barbeque buffalo wings ~ Just mind blowing... Heavenly... Highly recommended...

# Broasted basket ~ Also very good...

# Meatza nachos ~ Fully loaded nachos with chicken n cheese... It will surely going to win your heart...

❤ Fish n chips ~ Another hit of the day... The fish was soft n juicy... And the coating was perfectly crunchy... Recommend...

# Chicken spaghetti bolognise ~ Very yummy...

❤❤ Mutton gulawati rogan josh ~ Must have from here... Just mind blowing...

❤❤❤ Grilled fish ~ Another hit of the day... I must say, it was one of the best in the town...

In the desserts we had...

# Chocolate samosa with mango ice cream ~ I tried this many times before... It was delicious...

❤ Rose jamun with vanilla ice cream ~ Yeah... It was also awesome...

Overall a great place for hangout with friends n family... Do try this outlet this puja for sure...

Genuine Broaster Chicken was introduced last year in Kolkata when they opened their first outlet in Loudon Street.
This outlet of GBC is huge compared to other in our city, the decors, ambiance is what makes me feel good.

We had some cool drink like Sneaky chocolate, green apple mojito and Chulbul soda. I loved the Green apple Mojito and Chulbul soda the most.

From Starters we had below items:

*Curried BBQ Buffalo Wings: It was heavenly tasted.
*Broasted Basket: Fried Chicken tossed in some spicy tangy sauce made by chef Samyamay Sanyal,
*Meatza Nachos: If you like nachos as well as Pizza then you should have it.
*Fish n Chips: Excellent and too good.

In main course we had 3 items which are:
*Spaghetti Bolognese Chicken: Nice
*Mutton Galauti Roganjosh: Brilliant
*Grilled Fish: Good

In desserts we had:

*Rose Jamun Ice-cream: Nice but the jamun was not soft
*Chocolate Samosa with mango ice cream: Very Good.

Overall Experience is very good.

This place is just below my office. Dropped in to try their new menu and boy it was a delight. The chulbul soda is a classic. Masala thums up but a bit on the sweeter side. The buffalo wings are sticky and spicy with generous portion. I was skeptical to try grilled fish with lemon butter sauce along with mashed potatoes at a place famously known for its burgers and chicken fries but thank god I did. A good chunk of grilled bhetki drizzled with ample lemon butter sauce. The mashed potatoes would be perfect if the small vegetables were not added. The feedback was shared with the management as well. I prefer the creamier version of mashed potatoes. The rogan josh with lachcha paratha was something I won't forget soon. Minced mutton made into a patty and cooked in a gravy. What I loved was the lachcha paratha. Flaky,crispy and soft. Fried in ghee and seasoned well I finished one paratha just like that. 😁
The gulab jamun with rose ice cream was a nice combo. The jamuns were a bit hard but the taste was good. It was stuffed with pistachios and topped with a scoop of rose ice cream. The ice cream was not overtly sweet so it was a perfect balance between the two.
I wish the team of GBC all the success with this new menu. :-)

It was good food joint. The ambience is entertaining, somewhat rowdy, somewhat funny, no cosy chairs, no fancy cutlery but very different and interesting. Perfect environment for frns specially on a cricket match day.. they project the cricket and you have your fill. 
Service was ok on the first day of visit. 
First visit
We ordered the all chicken platter and pasta. Unfortunately the main item of the joint - genuine chicken broaster was missing from the platter was the negetive point. The other fried chickens were good. The cheesy jalepeno dip was tastiest among the 3 dips. Pasta was tasty... Perfect.. but I found it pricy for the amount of the dish( 229 + 50(for chicken) + 50(gst)=330 for plate). Rest the food tasted great. They were very courteous.

Second visit (not even a month)
New menu with all prices hiked to arround 20-40 RS more than earlier menu. New items added.
We ordered mini meat pizzas. Waited for more than an hour and was served cold so called pizzas
These pizzas were some hard breads with 3-4 piece of stale chicken over it and some chowmin and bit of cheese topics. Omg it was the worst food item people could pay and it. These was my last visit and am very annoyed

A laid back yet stunning decor welcomes you once you are here. The furniture, seating arrangement, the ambience you will surely fall in love with. If you are a foodie then  you must try the mash up of american and desi cuisine in this new culinary destination. I had little time to hog on something tummy filling but the menu card was really very tempting with all fusions and blends! This quirky firangi pudina dip was tooooo good. I take this opportunity to thank the owners of the restaurant to come up with those amazing desserts!!!!! Chocolate samosa was so very hot and seductive....

One of our colleagues and a dear sister to me decided to give us a farewell party and the name of genuine broaster chicken popped up! We have always been fascinated by the looks of the cozy restaurant on the outside and our chance to enjoy there hospitality finally came. So without further ado let me deconstruct everything I found about this place.

DECOR: Superb! Its enchnating, they really are stickler for details. They have worked hard to make it look exactly like an American road-side diner and hell it paid off. The cutleries, the uncle sam poster, the furnitures, the make-believe bar, everything reeked of that good ol' American charm and they nailed it perfectly!

FOOD: We were a tad bit disappointed as their famed Lamb Rogan Josh was missing from the menu. But what we ordered pretty much made up for it. We ordered the lucknowi seekh kebab for starters, peter punjab, the great khali and the fried jack burgers. The peter punjab was spectacular, the star of the show. The chicken filling was cooked nicely, the sauce tasted great and over all amazing. The great khali fared well too but didn't have enough spark to beat peter punjab. The Fried jack was so so. The french fries that came on the sides were classic! Provided great supporting role to our leads here. It was crunchy, perfectly salted yet tasted incredible, so was the dip.
We really were filled to our gills when they came up with the chocolate samosa with ice cream! And boy, was it superb! Perfectly crunchy, the chocolate melted in our mouths and the mango ice cream, together they made an immaculate couple!

AMBIENCE: The lighting was soft, not to hard on the eye. They played really peppy and foot tapping numbers, too bad they don't have a place to dance off the calories.

OVERALL: The staffs were courtseous, if a little clumsy. Their facilities were clean but a bit cramped up. I would have given them top marks had my eating experience not been ruined by the annoying water that was dripping from the AC duct. You gotta fix that pal or someone who is a flagbearer of hygiene will kick up a ruckus and that will be ugly. Lucky for you that wasn't me!

Anyhoo, y'all doing a great job, but I have full confidence that you can run the extra mile. Ciao!

P.S: I have never been to America, so here is to hoping they stick to the truth in the movies!

Went there yesterday with friends, ordered one chicken platter (hot and spicy one was the best), lamb ghost burger, ghotala Biryani and tarbuj coal. 
Starting with the chicken as the name suggests it was food not great but good, lamb ghost burger was great and everyone of us loved it, ghotala Biryani was not actually a Biryani it was a palao actually a messed up palao the worst thing I ever had in my life and trust me I had many hideous things! Coming to this tarbuj coal it was great 10/10 for tarbuj coal really wonderful. 
Food is very oily tho expected much more than that.

Last monday was a hectic day at work, post which we rushed to sector 5 to hog on anything​ sumptuous and my other two companions raved about their previous burger experiences at broaster on the way . So i finalized to give this place a try. I have been to their loudon outlet previously and the interiors are very much same , divided in two stories , only this being more airy and spacious . Hookah is available which we skipped , and quickly placed the order :

HAPPY FRIED CHICKEN - six pieces of fried chicken with curry mayo dip , the pieces were much bigger than i previously had at cc1 kiosk and loudon which came as thin strips. This was an impressive and value for money order .
THE GREAT KHALI BURGER- this had double loading of crispy fried chicken and grilled chicken patty , was a huge one but somewhat dry . Incorporating some more cheese , mayonnaise or suitable sauce will do good.
PETER PUNJAB BURGER - burger breads sandwiching a masala grilled chicken patty came with barbeque glaze was very tasty and undoubtedly a better pick out of the two.
PENNE ALFREDO WITH ADDED CHICKEN - couldn't find a flaw , the white sauce was brilliant.
BULBUL SODA - average at the best.

The only con was the slow service , all the dishes took hell lot of time to get served , while my friends finished their burgers , we had no clue where my pasta was . Even after asking to cancel the order repeatedly, they requested us to wait :-/

This chain outlet is another feather in the cap of sector 5 food Street. Situated in the same row with 10 downing Street and Kareem's this place stood out in the decor and ambience part. Coming to food, we took their fried chicken platter which had 6 pieces of chicken with 3 varieties, smoked bbq franchos, chulbul soda and cappuccino. Though there were few people their service was a bit slow. Among the 3 types of chicken I liked the legendary genuine broaster chicken the most. Franchos was a clear winner. Mixing French fries with tomatoes,pulled chicken made it tastier. The drinks were average in taste. Price is on a bit higher side.

Nice small place in the same building as 10 Downing Street and Preach in Sector 5. Very average interiors. All okay.

We ordered 12 pieces of crispy chicken and a plate of Lucknow seekh kebabs. Delicious, both of them. And they have a mouth-watering dip to go with these, tastes like a combination of mayonnaise and American mustard. Reasonably priced too.

Overall, recommended.

We visited this place last night. This restaurant is situated near RDB Boulevard and sharing the same campus with Kareem's and 10 Downing street.
The ambience is very lively with innovative seating arrangement and playing lovely music in the giant screen via projector. The staffs are very courteous.
We ordered the Broaster fried chicken platter containing 6 pieces of fried chicken of 3types with 3 different dips like thai sweet chilly, cheesy jalapeño and curry mango. The preparation was really fresh and crispy. Then we had Fried Jack- a type of chicken burger with mayo and onion tomato slaw and served with french fries.  The bun of the burger was green in colour-very unique and tasty. We also ordered penne punjabi pasta, prepared from chicken keema and the sauce was made from classic indian spices giving it a desi swag. As coolers we had Chulbul soda,type of masala cold drink and Lemon iced tea. Really refreshing and unique way of presentation.  Overall the experince was awesome and will visit again soon.

This is one of favorite places there are a lot many things from the decor to the ambience. The employees are also very friendly. You can very easily spot this place once you reach the location it is beside 10 downing street. They serve the best friend chicken. Price is also reasonable. Four of us went there and the bill was nearly 1300 including tax.

I have to love this place :)
Went there with a few friends... Had an amazing time. I loved the quirky interiors. It's spread on 2 floors... We sat on the upper deck. The fries were crisp and well seasoned. The palak paneer burger was amazing...Bursting with flavours...
We then ordered punjabi makkhni pasta.... It was a nice fusion of Italy with Punjab.
For drinks we ordered chulbul soda and bulbul soda ... Both were served in bottles of coke and sprite...
The star of the show had to be the Palang Tod... Espresso shot with Redbull... Mind not sound appealing but hey...That was one heck of a drink.. we had several rounds of it...

Highly recommend the place... Be it the food...Service... Presentation... Ambiance.... Loved the place.

A perfect 5 star restaurant. This happening place is located near GP block just opposite to Barcode, very easy to locate. Place is not that big, but beautiful and cool at the same time. Had delicious broaster chicken, lucknawi sheek kebab and their very popular one, chocolate samosa with mango ice-cream. Each and every bite was delectable. They will be soon serving alcohols  from next month which will be another reason to enjoy that place more. Service is top notch and commendable. Prices are way tooooo much reasonable. A must visit. :)

Went today with my collage buddies.. the ambience is nice, walls are well decorated and music was also good... We ordered a platter of genuine broaster chicken with 3 dips, and chulbul soda. The name sounds funny but taste is almost like a mixture of coke and jaljeera. Chicken pieces were good in taste but size is smaller than what we expected according to the price. Overall this place is nice for hangout but price is bit heavier.

Last week I visited the Sector 5 outlet after seeing many good reviews. I really had very bad experience in terms of booth food and services. Tried Broaster Legendry Fried Chicken..it was too bad. In terms of the sitting area, it was rainy day and there were couple of leakage in rooftop.Overall It was not good experience.

A perfect 5 star restaurant. This happening place is located near GP block just opposite to Barcode, very easy to locate. Place is not that big, but beautiful and cool at the same time. Had delicious broaster chicken, lucknawi sheek kebab and their very popular one, chocolate samosa with mango ice-cream. Each and every bite was delectable. They will be soon serving alcohols  from next month which will be another reason to enjoy that place more. Service is top notch and commendable. Prices are way tooooo much reasonable. A must visit. :)

Kolkata has got luckier with the first ever Pint format outlet of Genuine Broaster Chicken. American Soul and Indian Heart not only makes the decor and ambience likewise, but also the food has been curated in a similar manner.
The Broaster Platter, the Great Khali burger, the Italian Biryani, Ghotala Khichdi, Brownies with ice creams, Palang Tod drink, Chulbul and Bulbul soda drinks are the must try's out here. Also, the restaurant has great offers running on alcoholic beverages. A must recommendation from my side. I would definitely back here once I am back to Kolkata. All the best to the Genuine Broaster Chicken team.

If you're a Chicken lover, then This Is The Place!!! It was on my Bookmark ever since it had opened up. Finally, a couple of weeks back, visited this place. It's such a cozyyyyy place!! I loved the interiors. It absolutely looks like an American Highway Inn. Inspite of the place being not so big, each space has been done up really well. There are 2 levels over here. The upper level area is really really nice. Small, sweet and cozy!! I tried their Happy Fried Chicken. The chicken as well as the dip were just too good!!! They serve a wide variety of items like Pasta, Burger, Nachos etc.

All the Veggies out there, don't strike this place off your list just because the name says Chicken. There are a number of Veg items on their shelves, so GBC serves both the Non Veg & Veg really well! I'm sure gonna visit it again soon!!

This place is located near RDB Boulevard (in the same building where 10 Downing Street is located).
It has 2 floors. Its a small yet quirky place with amazing interiors and has nice music playing in the background.
They serve Hookah and also have combo menu for food and food+hookah.
I went with my friend who is a vegetarian so couldn't order much of non-veg food and also we weren't very hungry.

We ordered:
Chulbul Soda (masala thums up)- They serve it in a half-cut Thums up bottle.
Smoked BBQ franchos- Veg(french fries topped with bbq sauce and jalapenos)- The bbq sauce was a bit on the sweeter side which was a let down.
Peter Punjab burger - Burger was very tasty and had that Indian masala taste in it.

Overall experience was very nice.
Hope to visit soon with my Non-vegetarian friends!

Ambience- 4.5/5
Service- 3.5/5 (Can improve a lot)
Staff- 4.5/5 (The lady was very friendly and co-operative
Food- 4/5

Delicious fried chicken and kebabs. Have you ever tasted coffee with redbull? If no, try this item known as 'Palangtod'.  It's a nice option for those caffeine addicts out there. Watermelon fizz was also perfect. Don't forget to taste chocolate samosas with a scoop of mango ice cream. There's also a giant Khali burger for those with insatiable hunger. By the way, do you know how does chicken keema taste along with pasta? Well, you should try this mouth watering combination. Trust me. Go ahead. 
The interiors look pretty amazing as well but a little lack of space is evident, which they might improve.

Genuine broaster chicken is located in PS Srijan corporate park, opposite to opium. We went there after office but the place was all empty. We were the only customer. Service was too slow had to sit almost 40 mins after we ordered our food. We ordered a fried chicken platter which came with three luscious dips(curry mango, cheesy jalapeno and Thai sweet chilli). chulbul soda- it's an ordinary masala thums-up .we wanted to order cheesy chicken pillows but that was not available at that time. Next we ordered Lucknowi seekh which was a bit spicy. Shanghai chicken chowmein was normal chicken Hakka noodles. For dessert we ordered chocolate samosa with mango icecream- three small chocolate filled samosa, caramel lava cake- choco lava cake filled with caramel and walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream. Dessert were good but the overall experience was okayish.

Location : Just opposite to the famous opium bar. Parking is provided.
Ambience : Glass walls and fancy decorations instigate a good feeling within you.
Food : I have gone through many reviews that claimed they will give KFC a competition. I didn't really liked the chicken wings. They were nothing special. The owner claimed that the chocolate samosa would be the best dessert I ever had but... Sorry to disappoint it kinda sucked.
I was expecting a certain surprise inside a samosa but it wasn't anything special. Plus served with mango ice cream... Umm.. they don't really go together .
The pasta was really good though.
Overall, I will still stick to KFC for now.

Finally a competitor to KFC. My tastebuds had been longing for something new and GBC provided just that.
A noteworthy menition is the chulbul/bulbul soda which is a masala thumbsup with a twist and it sure is going to be hit in upcoming days.

The fried chicken with dips for which currently they they are not charging is very good and very different. I found it less oily than KFC also. 
The dips with the crispy coat will make you drool at least for the fist few visits. The ambience in the salt lake one is that of an american motel.   Justin beiber and ed sheeran playing in the AV.

Recommended highly if you want to try something in the KFC zone.

The flavourful fried chicken pieces were a delight to chew on after years of tasting KFC's bland chicken pieces. The French fries loaded with cheese and chicken was another delight. Certainly going back for more.

as soon as we heard the name of Genuine broaster chicken we wanted to try the restaurant out.We went for lunch. so we ordered Legendary broaster chicken(6pcs),chili chicken dry and chicken schezwan franchoes(had no idea what is this). From drinks menu we ordered lemon iced tea and fresh lime soda. First compliment about the restaurant would go for the ambience. English music,funny wall pictures etc. so legendary broaster chicken came, and i didn't expect it would be so good. the chicken was really american and it was broaster chicken. we loved it so we ordered one more plate of the same. chilli chicken dry was not so good. wont recommend to order it. Franchoes was also okay,not so good. I would like to comment about the lemon iced tea.It was different than any other lemon iced tea i had,they put some masala thing i guess, told them to change it and then they changed it and gave something which we could atleast have. But overall experience was good.would definitely recommend to go for the chicken :)

The flavourful fried chicken pieces were a delight to chew on after years of tasting KFC's bland chicken pieces. The French fries loaded with cheese and chicken was another delight. Certainly going back for more.

Me and my girlfriend walked into this place randomly and we were pleasantly surprised. The fried chicken platter was really good so was the Thai chicken sticks. The brownie was super awesome and we tried their Chocolate samosas which were lovely. Overall a good experience. Will visit again.

as soon as we heard the name of Genuine broaster chicken we wanted to try the restaurant out.We went for lunch. so we ordered Legendary broaster chicken(6pcs),chili chicken dry and chicken schezwan franchoes(had no idea what is this). From drinks menu we ordered lemon iced tea and fresh lime soda. First compliment about the restaurant would go for the ambience. English music,funny wall pictures etc. so legendary broaster chicken came, and i didn't expect it would be so good. the chicken was really american and it was broaster chicken. we loved it so we ordered one more plate of the same. chilli chicken dry was not so good. wont recommend to order it. Franchoes was also okay,not so good. I would like to comment about the lemon iced tea.It was different than any other lemon iced tea i had,they put some masala thing i guess, told them to change it and then they changed it and gave something which we could atleast have. But overall experience was good.would definitely recommend to go for the chicken :)

Thiw franchisee of Broaster chicken is located in Srijan IT Tech Park in Salt Lake Sector 5. 
Mentioning food, we ordered Legendary broaster chicken, Happy fried chicken with chulbul soda and classic lemon bubbled with lamb Rogan Josh burger but was not delighted enough for the patty in the burger was not up the mark. In desserts we had walnut brownie and stuffed chocolate samosa with mango ice cream (the later came as a complimentary dish for delay in order serving). 
Must say that they have used the space well and feels different when u r there.

I wanted to go to this place by the looks of it,with baseball helmets hanging as lanterns, n other interesting decor. After we went there, it was like a desi mix version of a KFC.. good try with wide array of mixing in menu, from Punjabi style pasta to Schezwan burger, to bulbul soda(which was orange fizz with caramel and masala). Liked the concept of serving drinks in half cut soft drinks glass bottles. Coming to food, it was average.. rather should say it didn't meet with expectation created with the whole lot of decorations and unusual menu.. varieties of French fried was there on menu, we tried Schezwan, and it was bad. Really bad with no taste at all. You might try Palang Tod drink which is red bull + espresso.

Ordered the 12 piece combo from swiggy. The food sucked. There was way too much batter and too less of chicken. The chicken, when present, tasted soft and succulent, however it was mostly absent. 

The best part about the combo were the dips. The dips were awesome(a solid 4 out of 5), no doubt about that. 

Not visiting/ordering again.

Thumbs up for the decor,and the polite staff ,who were very courteous.
Coming to the food next : we ordered their Broaster chicken platter which was served with different dips. Tasted about average.
Their famed soda drinks Chulbul and Bulbul didn't appeal much either.
The appetiser was the saviour for the day.
Never going back there again.

Heard a lot about Broaster so I was in the neighbourhood with a friend and decided to try out their uncommon menu. Ordered Garlic bread, palang tod, shanghai noodles and cold coffee. Their ambience is artistic, funky and gives a very different feel in compared to other restaurants, lounges in the vicinity. Garlic bread was sumptuous, soft, warm, delectable and then came the Palang Tod. Visiting Broaster and not trying this drink is an incomplete visit (PS, for people who like redbull). Shanghai noodles were above average and so was the cold coffee. Next visit I'll be hogging on some chicken and adding a review. Must try if you're around salt lake.

A place to hangout with friends. Staffs are welcoming. Ambience is cool. Went with friends and we really enjoyed it. Ordered fried chicken and trust me it was amazing. You should even try the mocktails. We order two different types of mocktails and I found the chulbul mocktail's second version amazing and I guess the mocktail name is bulbul. It has a taste of caramel and butterscotch. Try out this place. I bet you won't be disappointed. 

P.S. I am sorry I don't remember the mocktails' names properly as I was too busy eating the fried chicken. 😁
And the prices are quite reasonable.

With its quirky and American-ish ambience what seemed to be like a breath of fresh air amidst the regular dining outlets in Sector 5, turned out to be the most disappointing of them all. Service was commendable but food was a major let down. Their signature dish was out-of-stock. Among the shanghai chicken noodles, the great khali burger and cold coffee, only the cold coffee was a saving grace.

The decor has a sporty touch, you can watch a cricket match while having your food. Classy yet quirky interior. We ordered beer along with Broaster chicken, cheese chicken pillows, Lucknowi seekh, and Ghotala biriyani. Food tasted fresh and yummy. They serve alcohol only on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Staffs were polite and well behaved​.

The quirky decor impressed me though the space crunch was slightly off-putting. 

Here is what we ordered:

1) Chulbul Soda - Soda sikanji in a fancier format.
2) Bulbul Soda - a nice orange-y twist to masala soda - clearly a winner
3) Ghotala Biryani (with chicken keema, shredded lamb, and eggs) - lumpy but okayish, the meat saved the show
4) Lamb Rogan Josh Burger - lovely crimson colored burger with a nice side of french fries and dips - the bread was nice and soft, but the patty was made out of minced meat, much to my disappointment. 

The pocket pinch is actually about 450 per head. Service tax is added to the VAT, so the accrual is a tad high.
Maybe a good place for happy hour drinkers. Staff is helpful and service is prompt.

Being a chicken lover, I was just attracted to the name! But on a serious note, the place is worth checking out if you are looking for chicken with a twist. Ordered the legendary chicken platter which was a classic fried chicken, french fries (okayish), palak paneer dip (the cheese-spinach dip was awesome), choco brownie (smooth and soft af). The best were the drinks especially 'palang tod' which was actually a jagerbomb but with a caffeine shot instead of jagermeister. Do try it. 
The people there were very courteous and even changed a drink which wasn't good.
Tip: Do try their unlimited weekend offer. It's the best.

First of all the location is great. You will be able to spot it easily. Now once you enter you will notice the quirky decor.  I opted to sit upstairs. They have a big projector perfect for sports screening and the playlist is great comprising of the latest english hits. 
Coming to the food. 
Took the platter but  we were informed that the genuine legendary chicken was not available which disappointed me a tad bit. So we got a mix of the hot masala and fried chicken with 3 different and yummy dips. Curry mango dip was a personal favourite. Along with that also tried the lamb burger. The patty was really good. However i wasnt fond of the sauce. It felt very runny. 
For drinks opted for the chulbul . Its basically a coke based drink with masala and a sweet syrup. Really liked it. 
Also took the lemon iced drink but it was too sweet for me. I preferred chul bul more. 
Special mention to the staff who were nice and informed us about the flavours of the dips and helped us choose our order. The service was quick too. 
In short, this is a great place to hand out with your friends and indulge in chicken while you are admiring the amazing decor. 
Also its quite reasonable. 300/400 per person. Thumbs up! Will visit again.

The only good thing about the place was the location and the interiors. 

My first disappointment was that they were not serving alcohol the day I visited the place. I, being a non-kolkatite, had zomatoed the place which had no mention of this. 

But since we were already there, we decided to stay and try the food. We had ordered a Penne Arabiata Pasta and Peter Punjab Burger. The Pasta being the normal white sauce penne pasta was a bit off on the taste. Even though they claim that they do not aim to serve authentic food and that they serve a fusion of American and Indian cuisines, it was not very pleasant to the Taste buds. The burger on the other hand was a good result of the fusion. However, the preparation consisted of a chicken patty and vegetables mixed into a sauce which even though tasted great was very very messy to eat. 

The staff there was great though. They requested our feedback and wanted to improve on the same.

Salary day was upon us so we decided to celebrate a little at this (fairly) new joint in the middle of the Sec V hub. It was surprisingly empty for a Friday night. A projector was put up on the mezzanine which played popular music videos, in fact the music was so loud we had to ask them to turn it down. We ordered the Fried Jack burger, the Alfredo Penne pasta and the Walnut brownie, accompanying them was the Lemon soda (the exact name escapes me). First up, the lemon soda was bitter, I can't ever remember having a lemonade bitter, and even after changing the same, the taste remained. The Fried Jack was a good burger, it comes with a side of fries, which were drier than I'd like. The burger patty is a satisfyingly filling one, the spicy mayo makes it a great delicacy. The Alfredo pasta was so-so,coming with a standard side of garlic bread, it was creamy, but we'd have liked more cheese. The Walnut brownie was the genuine show-stealer, watching the molten chocolate trickle onto the plate was a joy. 

The service was prompt and helpful, even though the food and drinks leave quite a lot to be desired. Hope to come again soon to better experiences.

So a day had come for me recently to visit the new outlet of Genuine Broaster Chicken in Saltlake,Sector-5,Kolkata,India. And it was a joy to be there ,all thanks to Ramya for the invitation .First of all to let you know the location which is very easy to spot as its in the most prominent place in Sector – 5 which is Ps Srijan Park just beside Rdb multiplex.Once you come here you will feel you have entered a very interesting place very different than the regular cool places in town. The moment i saw this place from a distance i had a big happy face as it was situated out of all the noise and rush to a fine atmosphere surrounding with blowing winds almost all the time outside. The Broaster Chicken Outlet here is under the good care and guidance of the Chef ,the manager with the whole staff and of course the involvement of the Owner which creates a difference of hard work shown to justify hospitality at it’s best . I had a great interaction with the management and i was impressed with the kind of moves they are taking to give customers quality,quantity and comfort all in all here like introducing buffet menus on weekends etc. The kind of a place experience you will get here is no less than any American fast food outlet in the city and has a input of Indian and American fusion food available in the menu also. But what keeps them ahead from others is the experimental of decor here and of course the food hits the right spots which i shall talk about later in a short brief ahead. So getting back to the ambiance talk the place has two sections ,one is down as you enter which has a view of the out happenings through the glass facade and one is up where the Bar is live with dim lights to enjoy live visual projections of matches,music etc .The selection of music does set the mood pitch perfect over here to add on .You will find lovely sitting arrangement of wooden make tables and chairs in small to big over here in both the sections. The walls  are nicely framed with catchy lines and quotes. Loved the baseball hats customized as light lamps above the tables and area ,that is a masterpiece of creativity i must say.
                                          ...

Genuine Broaster Chicken is located in Salt Lake Sector 5. It is located very near to Kareem’s, Kolkata. The full address is PS Srijan Corporate Park, Near RDB Cinema, Block EP & GP, Sector 5, Salt Lake. I had been invited here by Ramya Ramachandran, who is looking after Public Relations of the whole of Genuine Broaster Chicken and is also a dear friend of mine. They started of their first outlet in Loudon Street and now, this is another outlet which has opened in doors in Salt Lake. The concept of Broaster as understood to me is like frying the chicken with the lid on. In other words, pressure fry. It is said to use 50 percent less of oil and retains moisture in the Chicken. I was invited to the Loudon Street one before as well. However, i find the ambiance at the Salt Lake one more quirky and is quite spacious. It has a bigger menu as well. There is a mezzanine floor which makes it ground + 1. The ambiance is chic here and the music is lovely keeping in mind the young crowd!!

The ambience,the place is okay and the price pinch is high compared to the food we had. The food tastes okay but it's not what you expect what fried chicken to be. Sorry but not visiting this place again 🙂

People close down you're kitchen at home, pull up your jeans, put on a t-shirt because you're traveling to this amazing restaurant which has just everything more. The food is more crispy, more saucy, more juicy, more in quantity and the staff is more friendly too.
After a long drive with hungry stomachs we entered this place, first the ambience hit us a hard then slowly came the delicious food, even after stomach bursting main course we could not resist eating three plates of the same dessert (my personal favourite mango ice cream with chocolate samosa).
If you haven't tried this place you haven't had the "FOODY" experience.

Located at PS Srijan Corporate Park (Near RDB Cinemas) at Sector 5, is this diner, incredibly impressive from the exterior. Is it worth a visit, let's find out.

At the first look, soon after entering the place, a very good image of the restaurant had been painted into my mind, the ambience being oh, so eye-catching. Chairs, tables, walls and everything else was immensely innovatively designed. Then came the menu which was even more creative in its form. First impressions, too good to be true.

Food review - 
1) Sanskari Aloo Burger - Amazingly crisp patty, finger licking sauces, juicy veges and a soft bun made this simple dish come out to be lip-smacking. Didn't ever expect a simple Aloo tikki burger to be so good. Rating - 9.5/10.

2) Schezwan Noodles Burger - Noodles inside a burger? Creative stuff. This was the most off-centre dish I found on the menu. And it comes out to be quite good. Rating - 9/10.

3) Firangi Palak Paneer Dip - Garlic Breaksticks served with cheesy palak paneer dip. This was a really appetizing dish. Absolutely loved the fusion dip. Rating - 9/10.

4) Chocolate Samosa with Mango Ice Cream - Had checked the menu, even before coming and was highly impatient to try this out. And it lived up to the expectations. It is so awesome that you absolutely must try it out. Couldn't resist ordering it again, and twice. Rating - 10/10.

5) Chulbul and Bulbul - Just our Masala Thumbs Up and Masala Fanta served very creatively. You'll love the way they serve it, in innovative Thumbs Up bottle glasses. Rating - 6/10.

Also ordered other dishes such as the Fried Jack Burger, Hot Masala Chicken and Penne Punjabi. All three of them were quite good, especially the Chicken. All burgers were served with Crispy Fries alongside a Spicy Mayo Dip. 

The service was the factor which made the experience even better. The whole managing team was extremely friendly and helpful throughout our visit.

Good ambience, great music, innovative food, amazing service and reasonable pricing made the Genuine Broaster Chicken experience phenomenal.

Overall, a must visit, Kudos. :)

Chicken is surprisingly so juicy and tasty that just made us to order some more product's from their menu so we ordered for Ghotala Briyani non veg as it has been suggested to us to be an unique creation believe me it's actually unique amazing in taste. We ended up having chocolate walnut brownie. ...believe me one of the best brownie I had in my life.....very cozy should visit this new baby in town at Salt Lake Sec V...Personally I will rate this place to be 4.5 out of 5...hope to see you soon...

The food is very good 
The chicken jack burger is juicy and should be in the to eat list, also the spicy mayo should get a special mention. 
The innovation made on the desert and drinks section is extraordinarily matching and very easy to get accustomed to. 
The fried chicken has the required crunch which goes missing from most outlets. 
The ambience gives out a very rustic American vibe which is in accordance with the whole theme and 
All in all a shout out to the team for a very good effort.

With the advent of branded fried chicken in Kolkata the quintessential ‘mangsher chop’ has somewhat taken a backseat which are often prepared with chicken pieces at the roadside snacks stalls. In fact there are so many stalls still preparing them, but people these days generally tend to go for fried chicken brands rather than those old stalls unless the charm of the bygone era captivates their foodie brains. Broaster’s Chicken is one such brand, in fact an old American brand which has pulled a considerable amount of crowd lately with their entry in the Kolkata FnB market. If you remember, few months ago I had reviewed the first outlet of Broaster’s Chicken in Kolkata at Loudon Street, now they have opened up few more outlets and I was invited to their Sector-5 outlet for a food tasting session which is housed in a swanky IT office tower that elevates the glam and glitter of the brand and its overall presence. The building where it is housed is called PS Srijan Corporate Park, and it is beside the 10 Downing Street restaurant, which is quite close to the RDB Cinemas at Saltlake Sector-5.

Its a little packed up, but that's what people like today!
The food was also good but it needs a little improvement...a particular dish I had, the happy chicken was a little too bland for Indian taste buds. The other items were amazing! It even pocket friendly! The owner was there and he spoke to us very kindly and the service was also top notch!
Seeing forward to visit this place again!

This was my first time at Genuine Broaster Chicken. I've heard about their Loudon Street outlet quite a lot, but never had the chance to visit it. So when I received an invitation from them for the Sector V outlet, I was excited!

This outlet happens to be the most spacious one out of all the 5 outlets that they have in Kolkata. The interior is done up in a retro American way and resembles an old school. They've put special effort to make the interior eye-catching. The ground floor has a few seats and has a red staircase leading upstairs. The best part about this place is that it has two glass walls which allows sunshine to pour in, and gives a happy vibe to the place.

Now coming to the food. We were served with an array of drinks and food items. And I loved each of them. Let me start talking about them!

DRINKS :

In this sultry weather, I was overjoyed to see the chilled drinks coming towards me! We were served 6 different drinks and each one tasted better than the other!
We were first served with Chulbul Soda and Bulbul Soda, two soda based drinks. The first one was coke infused with garam masala and a certain syrup which left a sweet aftertaste in your mouth, while the latter was a bubbly orange drink with a hint of salted caramel.
Next came the Tarbuj Cola which was a mixture of watermelon juice and cola which tasted great! Never imagined such a mixture could taste so brilliant!
Classic Lemon Bubbled and Fizzy Watermelon came next. The former was like your regular lemonade, whereas the watermelon drink was sweet and spicy.
The 6th drink was the showstopper of the afternoon - Palang Tod. This was nothing but the desi Jägerbomb where Red Bull was used instead of beer. This was a perfect combination of red bull and caffeine which was bitter and had a revitalizing effect on my senses!
With this ended the drink session.

MAIN COURSE :

• Mixed Fried Chicken Platter - I was looking forward to this dish!! How can you go to Broaster Chicken and not have their Fried Chicken! It's unforgivable!! So I was very excited when this came to our table. Interestingly, these pieces are pressure fried which consumes a lot lesser oil than your regular fried chicken. So the platter consisted of 3 varieties of fried chicken - the Genuine Broaster Chicken, the Happy Fried Chicken and the Hot Masala Chicken. My favourite was the Hot Masala one! It was served with 3 innovative dips which were Curry Mango, Cheesy Jalapeno and Thai Sweet Chilli.

• Garlic Bread with Firangi Palak Chicken Dip - This tasted divine. No one can ever go wrong with garlic bread so that's a given. What really needs to be mentioned is the delicious creamy chicken dip. Never imagined spinach and chicken to go so well. Chicken cubes, spinach and cheese were baked together to create this perfect combination and I can't stop raving about it! Strongly recommended!

• Ghotala Biryani - the name is quirky and so are the ingredients! Never imagined an Italian variant of Biryani which would be cooked in Arabiata Sauce! Can you believe this? And I can't describe how good it tasted! There was an abundance of chicken keema and the spice factor was high but surprisingly it wasn't as hot as I had expected it to be, which was a good thing. It had a tangy taste and was served with roasted papad! Strongly recommended if you want to try something out of the box.

DESSERTS :

• Brownie with Ice-cream - this dessert doesn't need an introduction. This is a classic favourite and can never go wrong.

• Gulkand Muffin - can you imagine Gulkand in a muffin? Honestly I couldn't until I took a bite. For those who don't know, gulkand is used as a condiment in meetha paan. So you can imagine my level of astonishment when I heard that a chef's special muffin with a centre filled with gulkand was on our way! With each bite I fell in love. It tasted perfect! Why hadn't anybody thought of this crazy combination before? Recommended!

Overall, I had a lovely time here. The ambience is perfect for spending quality time over good food that is surely going to surprise you! The service is fast, and I loved their playlist (another plus point)! Will be back here soon.

After the successful launch of the first branch of Genuine Broaster Chicken in Kolkata, they've come up with four new branches. I was recently invited at the Sector V branch, which happens to be the most spacious among all five.

The place has a typical old school American decor. The ground floor is well decorated. A narrow staircase leads to the first floor. The menu is quite interesting. It's completely based on Indo-American fusion cuisine, which is quite rare to find in the city. It was good to see that they have revamped the menu for India. 

The summer heat was intense and we were craving for some drinks. They served drinks in specially curated glasses and the drinks weren't similar to the soda based drinks available in the market. We initially started with Chul Bul and Tarbuj Cola, followed by Palang Tod, Fizzy Watermelon and Classic Lemon Bubbled. Both the watermelon drinks turned out to be good. The Tarbuj Cola was innovative since it was sweet and had the fizz of cola. Chul Bul soda tasted totally different from masala coke because of the use of a special syrup which left a spicy tinge in the throat after gulping down the drink. Palang Tod was prepared in front of us, like a typical jägerbomb, where beer was replaced by Red bull. The menu also included hot beverages and milkshakes which I couldn't try this time.

The fried chicken was what I was waiting for. They rather call it 'broasted' chicken. Now what does that term mean? The chicken is deep fried in a pressure fryer, which makes it more crispy, juicy and flavourful. Of course, the oil content is much less than the fried chicken at other places. Going by the name, they have named this technique as 'broasting'. The fried chicken came in three variants - Classic Broaster Chicken, Happy Fried Chicken and Hot Masala Chicken. My favourite was definitely the Hot Masala Chicken. It was amazingly crispy and spicy. The juiciness of the chicken was an additional thing I loved. This was irresistible and I couldn't stop munching it. The Hot Masala Chicken definitely deserves a try !

Firangi Palak Chicken Dip was the next thing brought before us. Soft chicken cubes were baked with spinach and cheese and served with grilled garlic bread. The dip tasted brilliant. Anything with cheese can't go wrong somehow and so was this dish.

The next thing was quite surprising for me when the chef brought before us 'Italian Ghotala Biryani' ! This was a fusion biryani where the rice was cooked with Arrabiata sauce, butter chicken gravy and chicken Keema. To be honest, I can never tolerate typical fusion atleast with biryani but somehow I was taken aback by this amazing fusion ! It wasn't very oily, was moderately spicy and had minced chicken proportionally added with the rice. I'm sure you'd love this even if you don't prefer fusion with your favourite Kolkata Biryani !

It was dessert time and we had Walnut Brownie with Vanilla ice cream and Gulkand Muffin. Talking of the former, the brownie was spongy and very well cooked. It was otherwise a common dish but the texture of the brownie was something that left a mark. The Gulkand Muffin was something I loved. It looked like a typical dry cupcake but tasted amazing. The centre had a sweet stuffing of gulkand.

Overall, the menu has been modified a lot since my last visit, along with new additions. I loved the food and the drinks, a special mention definitely goes to the Italian Ghotala Biryani, which is a must try over here.

Verdict - Must Visit !

Value for money: 4.5/5
Presentation: 4/5

The first thing that appeals to one as they enter is the effort put in the interiors and the playlist. The playlist plays a great part of the ambience and instantly gives good vibes.

The next part of the experience is the staff, extremely friendly and courteous along with the extremely appetizing menu.
Though an avid non-vegetarian, the Palak Paneer burger is a winner, I would choose that over the Mutton Roganjosh burger although the latter is hard to resist too.
The Chicken platter with 3 dips is a must try as the Jalapeño cheese and Curry Mango dip linger on your taste buds.
The Coconut Milkshake is a winner too.

And the Ghotala biriyani is unique and plays a riot on your taste buds.
We missed out on desserts but would definitely go back again.

PS: They have a drink called Palang tor which is just so much theatre in itself and would get you going good for the rest of the day

The second outlet in Kolkata is only a month old and already making a lot of good noise! Located very conveniently in Sector 5, this outlet outshines the other outlet. The owners and the chef are extremely humble, and help run the place with a lot of positivity! 
We tried their chulbul soda, palank tod, watermelon coke based mocktails, and coconut fudge. The coconut fudge was amazing - looked beautiful, and tasted even better!!
We also tried their fried chicken platter - wings, breasts, and thighs. Fried to perfection, not overtly oily, and crisp. That satisfying crunch noise gives you such a pleasure. The meat inside is broiled or steamed hence allowing the meat to remain soft and juicy.
The dips that came with the meat - Curry Mango Dip, Cheesy Jalapeno, and Thai Chilli. The first dip should be tried for it's tanginess, the second for spiciness, and the third for it's sweetness!
The burgers - the red coloured and the green colored burgers. The red color is due to the raspberry extract, and has a lamb patty. The green bread is thanks to the spinach and has a veg patty.
Next, presented to us was the Firangi Chicken Dip - Chef Special. This was the showstopper.  A bowl full of three cheese and chicken, the inside is cooked, and the outer layer is oven cooked adding that brownish tinge to the edges.
This was followed by the Ghotala Biriyani - Arabiatta and the schezwan versions. Such comparison and such contrasting dishes is hard to find. By now we were too stuffed to even try their desserts. However, we could not leave without trying their Gulkand Muffin. Served piping hot, the gulkand ness was limited and the muffin was soft.
We had a great lunch at Broaster Chicken, sector -5. 
You should visit because you get your meals quick and it is well within 200-300 to fill you completely.

Decor and ambience amazing. Service is prompt but food is not good at all. Went for Thai Chicken Sticks and Broaster Platter both were huge disapointments, it was not tasty and the portions were loss.
Overall an average experience.

Location is perfect for a great start of a new restaurant. Interior is cool with a typical american vintage look. Food was good. The main attraction which stole the show was the dessert. Don't forget to try chocolate samossa with mango ice cream. ☺️

The burgers were delicious especially the lamb burger. The mocktail drinks are a speciality and are a must try. You would really be surprised how yummy there are despite the corny names. 
The chicken keema pasta was tasty but too oily for my liking.
The fried chicken was the highlight though and yes far better than the ones they serve at Kfc.
We tried out a lot of dishes as this was our first time at this chain and the prices were very reasonable too so we did not have to empty our pockets after the royal feast.
Also we visited them on the day of their grand opening and the pleasant surprise was that we were provided with complimentary drinks.
The ambience is unique to say the least although the seating capacity is small at this outlet. The arrangements are already there for live sports screenings but if that does start then I am guessing it would be tough to get a table here.
A nice place to hangout one might say. But the food and drinks are really good and stand out. Will surely visit this place again soon.

Ordered the 6 price platter of fried chicken and the vegetarian fries with salsa, cheese sauce, jalapeños and olives. 

The platter came with a set of three dips - the cheesy jalapeño, curry mango and a Thai sweet chilli. The cheesy jalapeño was easily the best. Fried chicken was pretty decent. Not too much oil and breaded nicely. 

The fries were pretty decent but needed more topping for such a generous portion of chips. 

All in all, not a bad place to get some junk food from.

I have been to many places before but this place has that pure American cafe feel in it. Genuine broaster chicken being one of the renowned brand in United State of America has it all in here. Soothing western music along with great food, things that you will love being here. Coming to food, we had Lamb Rogantosh burger and Alfredo ( pasta with white sauce) which was good. Palang Tod ( in beverage) could have been better. Desserts carried us away. Chocolate samosa with mango ice cream and Gulkand muffin is something​ worth trying. Overall a  fantastic place to hangout with friends.

Ok first thing first , I take my burgers too seriously and when I visited this place , I knew that I found a hidden gem.ordered their  show stopper burger  " the Rogan Josh  burger" . The meat patty was juicy , succulent a bit spicy for my taste buds bt d burger was good and I m not complaining at all. D bun was soft and d hot pink color  is appealing to eyes and taste buds as well. D service was prompt and decor , impressive. Over all  a happy experience...

Visiting this place has always been a wonderful idea. Its a lil paradise for chicken lovers. The food is awesomely cooked to perfection. The place which makes this place so wonderful is the beautiful wooden decor which would sooth ur eyes and soul . To lift up ur mood is the energetic music . Moreover the staff is very courteous and they are always ready to help you with the order. It is a must try place to chill out with family and friends.

Thinking its Friday ..... and in between your hectic work hours, you wanna grab a burger and some fried chicken?? Let me tell me then, Genuine Broaster Chicken
 at Sector 5, Salt Lake is not the place for you. Their joint is indeed a cozy one with interesting interiors but seems like they neither thought of using some cool technology in their kitchen to cook food nor have some efficient staffs. I went there with some colleagues and waited for almost 2 hours. The staff served us the fried chicken but made us wait, wait and wait for the rest of the order to be served. Instead, they served our food at some other table.  When we were about to leave they served 2 out of the 3 orders we had and told us the third one is on its way as there is a rush and there is some electricity trouble in the kitchen which is holding them from preparing food. They made us again wait, wait and wait for the third one. Finally, I had no option but to leave the food and the money on their table without bill (that again not given to us on asking). So guys, do not starve your stomach by choosing this place. There are better options at Sec V.

Absolute waste of time and energy. If you have hours to kill, you are welcome to go, however, please do not expect quick service at all!

31st March is usually an extremely busy time for all organizations chasing last minute revenue and other stuff. Amidst this madness, 3 of us office colleagues went to Genuine Broaster Chicken at Sector 5 Salt Lake for a quick bite. 

We entered at 1:10 pm and in the next 3 minutes we ordered 6-pcs of hot & spicy chicken, a schezwan noodle burger (veg), a non-veg variant of the same and something they call The Great Khali. About 20 minutes later they came back with the 6-pcs chicken plate by which time most of the restaurant tables were occupied with patrons. 

The chicken was excellent - juicy, succulent and well cooked with extremely catchy flavors and we thought we are in for a treat. They say your hunger increases the most when you wait for food. This nice start very quickly turned south when we started seeing the other tables (which were filled way later) getting their ordered dishes and we were kept waiting.

At about 2 pm (50 minutes later) the waiter came to us and apologized about a mix up with orders. They had given our order to another table with the same order. We, being nice people, said that it was okay but we needed our food quickly as we had to return to work. 

As we waited we saw dish after dish being served to the others with no attention towards us at all. 

At about 2:30 pm, with disappointment in our minds and hunger in our bellies we were about to leave, when 2 of our 3 ordered burgers were served. However, we could not start eating as we had to wait for the third order - social courtesy et al. By 2:38 pm, we had lost all patience and decided to leave. We came downstairs asking for the bill when one of the guys (I am assuming a manager or partner of sorts) told us that due to the rush hour, they were slightly slower than usual. My answer was they should simply had served us before the rush when we were present.

On insisting for the bill, they went and took another 5 minutes to simply provide a bill. They were at least gracious enough to pack the burgers and hand it to us before they went for billing.

At 2:45 pm, we decided enough was enough kept cash for the items we ate, left the packed burgers on the table and walked out the restaurant.

Amazing place to dine at.Must come place....amazing music...decor is just fit for casual dining. Already had most of the dishes..Ghotala is amazing..broasted chicken platter is just amazing with à perfect concoction of desi taste of spicy Masala and bit flat note American spice mix. Should get liquor to make this place more happening and also being a review person must mention that  a new place in kolkata not at all ethnic but very casual and friendly...cheers!!!

A small cozy joint with mezzanine floor. Optimal use of space yet comfortable sitting arrangements. Youthful theme with tables made of iron pipes, rustic wooden chairs, inverted baseball helmets with plants, canvas printed photos from Albert Einstein to Marilyn Monroe. Jazziness was everywhere.
Upper floor had got a small bar area which served non-alcoholic beverages.
Menu card was bright and colorful. Lot of innovative fusion dishes like Penne Punjabi, Sichuan Biryani, a burger named "The Great Khali" or the Chocolate Samosa with Mango ice cream!
There were three types of fried/broasted chicken to try for. Go for the platter which have all three types.
The chicken was crispy outside with a juicy core. The dips were lip-smacking. We ordered for a Begum Chicken Keema and Butter Paratha. The later tasted like home Paratha made by mom and the keema reminded us about the good ol' Dhabas beside the highways. It was so mesmerizing that we reordered the whole set for the second time.
Food was served in long forgotten enamelware and drinking water in roadside tea stall "cutting" glasses.

The service was moderately fast and waiters were cool dudes. Price was reasonable though serving sizes were small. A two course light lunch costed us Rs.350 per person.

Worth paying a visit if you are looking for a cozy eatery away from the regular crowded places of Sector V.

If you have lots of money to spend and the smallest appetite then go this restaurant. We were a group of 7, went for lunch and returned with a worst experience . Too expensive, terrible quantity with no variety as such. We ordered 2 parathas, 1 begum chicken, 1 chicken curry , 3 egg fried rice, 1 chicken fried rice, fried chicken and 2 bulbul (masala cola). The beverage was 120 each, too sweet and it was normal masala cola, the fried rice was taste less with hardly any egg or chicken pieces. And the worst part was their quantity as per the side dish. At first we couldn't believe that with 225 bucks they have served us 2 tiny pieces of chicken in a dessert bowl. The bill came upto 2663 with worst service experience. So for them I give a thumbs down 👎 
Quantity 0/10
Quality 4/10
Taste 3/10
Service 3/10
Price 2/10
Staff 3/10 (untrained staffs with delayed service)
Only the best part was their interior and theme decor. Rest its a big NO.
And if your unfortunate to land up there then try fried chicken ONLY!

I sit here as I write this review. Food is expensive/quantity wise terrible, staff untrained for eg first comes the masala soda than comes the appetizer followed by the dessert and main course at last.

The rating you see above is for the good decor. This place is a classic case of confused positioning.

Stuff I tried was chulbul Soda, seekh kebab, gulkand muffin and mixed fried chicken platter.

First thing that stricked me is the ambience and indo-american style decor. Very tastefully done detailing beat spoon to glasses. I am a big fan of burgers.  I tried Roganjosh  burgers was simply a killer.  The mocktail Chulbul was better than Bulbul. I still have to try other delicious range of fried chicken.
 Good to have you in sec 5. Cheers to the wonderful hospitality. And all the very best. Thanks Alka for taking me there.

Another good place in salt lake, good service, great ambiance, awesome food. Very unique and raw interior with very out of the box menu. Broaster chicken was good. Really liked chulbul soda and awesome chocolate samosa with ice cream. Will be visiting again soon to try some burgers and gulkand muffins.
