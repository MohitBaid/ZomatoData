If you're broke and wanna have some decent chinese food then kamat cafe is your place.
Located on the Prince Anwarshah Road,this place is near to Navina Cinema Hall.

We had one Schezwan Noodles,one Veg Rice and one Thai Chicken.
The quantity is really pretty good and quality is satisfactory.
Don't go for the decor as its a cozy place with no fancy interior.
But if you're up for some "cheap thrills" then will definitely suggest this one.
They have a roll corner as well.

This cafe/ Restaurant is very close to Navina Cinema Hall, opposite Princeton club. The serve good rolls that are frankly quite tasty. They also serve Chinese cuisine. People may argue that this restaurant is past its best days but in my opinion it's a perfectly fine restaurant that knows it's customer base. Plus the Location of the restaurant helps. If you are in the area and want to have some decent quality food, go for it.

"Kamat Cafe", the restaurant adjacent to Navina Cinema hall, on Prince Anwarshah Road, started their journey as a South Indian Cafe, but later on switched to the genre of Chinese and Fast Food.

Due to locational advantage, specially being adjacent to a movie hall, it attracts pretty good footfall. 
Nothing much to write about ambience, but the AC segment adjacent to the open kitchen, is small but neat and to some extent comfortable.
Food is descent in terms of taste and quality, and pocket pinch is absolutely reasonable.

A nice place for a quick lunch, or to grab a bite on the go.

There was a time this cafe used to be a good one... Now their food quality and everything has decreased badly and it's not up to the mark! And this cafe offers no ambience!
