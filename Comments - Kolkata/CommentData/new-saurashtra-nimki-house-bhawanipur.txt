A bhujia store in the stretch between Balwant Singh (Harish Mukherjee and Sambhunath Pandit Street) crossing and the Mandir at the centre of the road, this place will be on your left if you are heading eastwards, that is, towards the Elgin Road signal. Located next to the medical shops, this one is not highly glamorous and you might miss it in case you don't know the exact spot. Parking here might be an issue. However this shop has sustained through ages and their gathiya and nimkis are simply out of the world, to say the least. Surely worth multiple visits!

I have only tasted their Dhokla so far and I can vouch for it. They serve it with some sweet and spicy chutney which greatly enhances the taste. Price is Rs.12 per piece.

New Saurashtra Nimki House is located at Bhawanipore.

Ambience is very simple .

They sell a wide variety of sweets & snacks .

Service is swift .

Tried Dhokla, which was served with chutney. Dhokla was soft and was very tasty. Chutney was tangy. 

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

New Saurashtra Nimki House's second outlet in Kolkata, the other one is in Southern Avenue. This place is popular for its snacks and desserts. They make a variety of them and believe me each of them are very good in taste. I visited here with few of my friends one morning and tried few of their sweets, each of them were brilliant.

I tried their jalebis and khakhra today!! Loved both...
The jalebis were hot and soooo tasty!! The khakhra was crisp light and was infused with flavours ....I also packed mixed chanachur for home! I am not much of a chanachur fan hence did not like it much but my parents love it :) This place is actually famous for their spicy and chatpata mixed chanachur so people who love these kind of snacks do give this place a try! As for people like me their khakhras and jalebis are enough for us to be dragged there :P

Always crowded snacks and sweets outlet in bhawanipur which serves very tasty and delicious desi snacks and sweets. It was a takeaway outlet with no sitting place and over crowded all the time. Service was very fast and staff was friendly too. Hospitality was good and ambitious was nice. Gujrati snacks are their speciality and they make them perfectly. Their sweets were above average but snacks was very tasty. I liked the most their khakra, dhokla and samosa. Good experience. Must visit place for snacks. Recommended to all desi snacks lover.

If you want fresh snack in the morning,this is the best place. Pyaaz samosas,dhoklas,kachoris and endless gujarati snacks and sweets is available with amazing chutneys.
It's on the main road near the gurudwara and easy to reach. Better for a takeaway as it doesn't have any seating.

Keeping in line with Kolkata's knack for fried snacks or namkeens is this store.Never could find the connect between Saurashtra and nimki though.

Good dhokla,average Chanachur,average samosas.

Store to store I'll prefer Annapurna further down the road anyday.

Situated very clos to the Gurudwara and the Hanuman temple this typical outlet serves great kachoris (unlike the masala types of Rawats in Jaipur) ,they are small with a slight hint of sweetness and mild masala and are really yum and can get addictive. They also have super crisp small Jalebis in the mornings aswell as tasty samosas( Singaras in Bengal !) Dhoklas,ganthias and other Gujrati nimkis are excellent and fresh.They have various namkeen mixtures and you can do your own "blends" if you choose. The wafers(chips) are always crisp and fresh and you pay half the price of Lays,Yummitos or Uncle chips and you get only chips in the packet and NOT half filled with air packets,!!Try this little place if you are in the area¬† and you wont be disappointed.

Location: Near to Balwant Singh Eating House; Opposite Dhanwantry Pharmacy.
 
This place has been here for a long time now and has been amongst my favourites for quick bites and snacks. 
This place is preferred by a large number of people for takeaways which consist of freshly made Dhoklas, Onion Samosas, Chilli Pakoras, Vada Pav and definitely the Ghatiyas & mixture (chanachur)!
It's been five years plus, I have been visiting this place on a weekly basis early in the morning just to take home the delicious khandvis, hot ghatiyas and other snacks for my family. 
You might face a wiped off shelf of a snack or two, thanks to it's taste.

The staff are friendly and the service is prompt. 
Prices would make your wallet smile. 

A place not to miss at all. :) 
-Has another outlet at Sarat Bose Road.

I am writing this review for both elgin road and lake area outlets. They provide some amazing Gujarati snacks and savouries. I have been very regular to take breakfast from this place as I go for a jogging early morning, opens up by 7:00 - 7:30 am approx. and the smell and taste is so fresh, making it the best time to try them out. They serve amazing rice dhoklas, besan dhoklas, onion pakoras, aloo bonda and the list goes on. Now they have also started to serve packed sandwiches for ones who would like to grab and move on. Mixture (chanachur) is also good here. If you want to go for something apart from kachori or south indian from elsewhere, can go for this blindly. Its light and tasty and gives my day a good start!

Located near gol mandir, saurashtra nimki house has been my destination mainly for the pyaaz samosas and the fresh chanachur. 

They have a wide variety of fried snacks including several chips, mixtures, nimkis, gathiya etc which are all very good and value for money. You could also get the stuff from here while sipping a tea at sharmas nearby by requesting the person serving you. Dhoklas here are decent.  They do have a few sweets on offer but i am not so fond of them. Khakra available here is very good, but yet to try the farsaan, wada paw  which have been appreciated in the other reviews and is surely on my future agenda.

Overall, the place serves a huge variety of fooding options which are all dependable that could be understood from the everlasting crowds in front of the shop from the moment it opens in the morning.

I love dhoklas, and this place serves me exactly what I want and when  I want it - soft, lovely dhoklas which tastes absolutely perfect. However, the other must-have thing about this place is probably the spicy nimki which my mother adores and I like with tea. Also, they store a variety of pickles and other stuff, which my mother buys and stores on a regular basis for sudden guests or lunch time condiments.

One of the best places for Farsan,Khakra and mixture in this part of town. They also have a second outlet on Southern Avenue Crossing. I love their samosa with the sweet red chutney , the dhokla is one of the best in the city by far , the onion samasas are delicious and a great starter at most parties at my place and the wada paw and sandwiches are also pretty good. Their peanut chikki and green chili pickle are also awesome. Their pedas and besan ladoos are also pretty yummy. A good place to stock up on nimki's and snacks for home and morning jalebi,dhokla, samosa and gathiya breakfast is sinful but heavenly.

I am surprised to see how nobody has reviewed the palace, because every morning all people who go to Victoria to burn calories in their morning walks come and put them all back on here. 

The dhoklas here are mind blowing. so is the rice dhokla and u have to come early as the khandvi literally vanishes from the shelf. The desserts are average. but the vacuum packed khakras are very light and crisp. They also have a paper thin dosa that can be stored and eaten as a farsaan. This item is delicious . 

Last is the HERO. the wada paw with the fried chilies. It is simple the wada paw closed to mumbai. 

the aloo bondas and the mutter bondas/patties are nice too 

Fresh and delicious ... hygiene is an issue
