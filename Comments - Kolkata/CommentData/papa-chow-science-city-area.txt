A very average place serving cheap and good Chinese food. I had the chicken momos and the veg spring rolls. The packaging was good , as they served soup also. They were generous with the amount of chutney. The chutney was spicy and like a thick mash of chillies and garlic which I always prefer. The momo filling was tasty , although the chicken felt more like it had been blended rather than mashed. The seasoning was okay. The spring rolls were tasty too , with cabbage and carrots filled inside. All in all a place to have good and cheap Chinese food.
