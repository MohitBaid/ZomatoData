I often have their fried momos.
Their dried momos are really good. 
Less oily,crisp,decent filling for the price,yummy tangy spicy sauce,they serve fresh

Cafe Corner isn't a cafe where you sit with your loved once & share a cup of tea. Located on the main road of Maniktala this one is an Indian & Chinese cuisine with very less options to choose from. They have a huge dining inside but somehow that isn't very preferable. Cooking is done outside.

I parceled a simple dinner with their Mutton Tikia & Rumali Roti. Tikia was very soft felt like butter in the mouth. It was fresh, well cooked from inside & full of mutton. Spices were little high that made it extremely hot. Unfortunately it was over salted that ruined it's taste. The quantity was good. Where the Rumali Roti was very dry & dusty. Overall it stayed between okey & below average. Pricing was also very affordable.

You will find this place open quite a long at night. So if you are late & no options are left behind, then this one is an average option to go with.

This used to be a favourite joint in the early 80s. The chaap, biriyani, tikya was a favourite at that time and it was pretty crowded and popular. Went back a couple of years back and the man at the cash counter recognised me but other than that, it was a terrible disappointment. The food quality and portions have deteriorated like anything and typical of all 'slow' joints, the food was neither hour nor fresh. 

The reading is completely sentimental.

The taste was average. Place was not so clean. Owners behavior is rude but staff were friendly but service is poor. You should try their chicken items they were tastes good according to my friends. Not for vegetarians I tried couple of dishes both were awful.

A very old establishment in the Manicktala region. It's food has been coming to my house  from before my birth. Serves a very average fare of moghlai dishes. The service is bad. The workers are mostly children maybe underage. Interior decoration not worth mentioning and gets very stuffy during summer and hot days. However some of the dishes are best among all the small outlets in the region and is quite cheap.

Everything I try here gives me heart burn. Service bad , staff behaviour satisfactory , not hygienic at all. Yet there is one thing i really like its the chicken chowmein . Needs man management asap but it has stood the test of time more than 30years old it has survived and still going strong. God knows how!. Please go for take away always its for your own good.

The outlet is located near srimani market. It is a 5 minute walking distance from Vivekananda road. 

The outlet is situated in the Marin road & even half of it block the road to prepare rolls & chowmin for take away. 

Ambience of the restaurants is not at all good so does the seating arrangements. But they served good food at reasonable prices. The menu included basic item & all taste average. No special recommendations except tarka-roti. 

If you are leaving in neighbourhood , u can try the food from this outlet for take away.
