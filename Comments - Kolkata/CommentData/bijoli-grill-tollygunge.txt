This is located near Ashoknagar park, beside the SBI atm. They don't have sitting facility. They paced the food for me. I had their combo meal which included friend rice along with chilli chicken & two piece momo. Quality as well as quantity is not writable.

I have been a regular at Bijoligrill since my childhood. I remember the first time I went to their outlet besides Bijoli theater in Kolkata. I have also been to their Raja Basanta Roy outlet for many times and found the quality and the quantity of their food to be highly satisfying.

However, with this recent outlet at Tollygunge, Bijoligrill has been a complete disaster. I have ordered from this restaurant through Swiggy several times and every time I found something wrong with the order. Either the orders were partially delivered or the quality/ quantity is extremely poor.

I had ordered a mixed fried rice from this outlet through Swiggy today (07/04/2017) and I was surprised to see that the quantity of the rice was extremely low. Moreover, the mixed rice was supposed to contain mushroom,prawn, chicken and eggs but I couldn't find a single piece of mushroom or prawn in the rice. I feel cheated!

The tollygunge outlet of Bijoligrill is a complete disaster and Bijoligrill should take strong stance against this outlet for tarnishing their reputation or just shut it down. I for one, will never ever order from Bijoligrill again.

The decade old relationship with Bijoligrill ends right here.

Heard many a story about Bijoli Grill's famous Fish Roll, so decided to order one on a Saturday evening via Swiggy. To say it tasted heavenly, will be an understatement. At 120/- it was more than satisfying...

This outlet doesn't cater to the level bijoli grill has set. At least from what I ordered. I got a home delivery through swiggy where my order were fish orleys and egg pakoras. The fillings seemed poor and moreover it was not accompanied with any sauce or salad. I am a loyal bijoli grill customer and very fond of their white and mustard sauce but this time I am really very disappointed. Also the quality and taste wasn't up to the mark.

No one needs a special introduction to bijoli grill in kolkata. The providers of some of the finest fish delicacies which has mesmerised every bengalis. Recently they have started to open up small counters throughout kolkata to spread further & so i was delighted when they opened up in tollygunge circle.

Ordered via swiggy i have had the followings:-

1. Bangla fish fry- Thin but crisp classic old fish fry with salad & kasundi. The fish was super tasty & had no unnecessary additions. Although the size could be improved upon compared to its price.

2. Chicken clear soup- Medium serving of clear light soup with fine chicken pieces in generous proportions & spring onions. The taste was simple yet tantalizing. Loved every spoonful of it.

3. Chicken pakoras- 6pcs of round shaped chicken pakoras in light batter. They use pure spiced marinated chicken which was tremendous to eat. Taste wise they were superb.

This outlet doesn't charge extra taxes & all the prices are pocket friendly. Looking forward to try more of their menu ðŸ˜€

Yet another order from this place, and yet again the same quality of food. This place is simply great! The quality of food is just bang for the buck. No doubt the service is very good. Keep up the good work, thumbs up from my side.
