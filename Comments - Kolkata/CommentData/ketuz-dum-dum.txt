They have upgraded their service and guess what...
This is the best place that college couples can ever dream of...
They offer secure private space for couples..
The service is very nice now..
Need some upgrades in the ambience..
The food is also very good in such a  price... 
The menu is updated.. the price is almost same... 

If you are looking for some private and  friendly environment along with your partner with good food..  will suggest not to go anywhere else

Ordered food through swiggy. Had ordered Biryani. The food was horrible. No way a person can intake their food and stay healthy. Please do avoid their food as they really don't care about the quality or either the hospitality of the customers.

Food - 1
Quality - 0
Packaging - 0.
Probably won't order food ever from them. Never had such bad experience before. Would have given 0 if it was possible.

Tried ketuz for the first time. Food was very bad. Kindly improve food quality. Chicken wasn't cooked properly in the biriyani. There was excess oil in the paratha and also some oily smell was coming out of the paratha.

Have heard a lot about this restaurant from my chums , so decided to order some of it's special dishes for family dinner today. And my first time experience (regarding this restaurant's food) was a memorable one. Although home delivery was a bit late, but it was made up nicely when I came through the 3 items that I have ordered. Packaging was really nice by Swiggy. Coming to the Chicken pakora , it was crispy and really soft. Infact one of the yummiest chicken pakora I had had in recent times. Next food item was Chicken Manchurian Gravy in which the meat balls was well marinated in@ different spices and moreover the meat balls were juicy and tasty. Last item was chilli chicken gravy which I think is their speciality. The gravy was prepared from different sauces and a mixture of seasonal veggies added a boost to its taste. Moreover, the meat balls were fresh,soft and cooked very nicely. Last but not the least, the ordered items were pocket friendly and it reminds me of an old idiom, "Don't judge a book by it cover", in this case, I would specially mention, "Don't judge a food item by it's colour and price but judge it by its quality". And Ketuz Has done justice to its reputation by maintaining it's food quality even in a pocket friendly range. For late home delivery, I am deducting 0.5 points, but for the great effort from Ketuz , I would like to rate Ketuz in a fifer rating. Would definitely recommended it to my dear ones. Kudos and keep entertaining food lovers by your delicacies. üëåüëç

Ketuz Cabin is a pocket friendly restaurant near  Dumdum station . Their ambience or service might not be high class . But considering the price and quality of food, it's ok . They offer delicious foods at minimum cost . Though their food is a bit oily .

I have ordered Ketuz'er Thali from here via Swiggy which is not really worth for the price value, also the food quality is not upto the mark. Rice quality is very ordinary like as you get in the roadside hotels, and all the three main course item's gravy (Chicken, Mutton, Vetki Fish) tastes almost same. And the gravy is very very rich and oily that you can not eat. Last but not the least, the packaging is also very ordinary like as roadside hotels. Will not suggest anyone to go there.

Well the food is good , quiet affordavle place. I have ordered and got it delivered so...dont know much about the ambiance , 
The combo of chilli chicken and chicken chowmin though is cheap but the quantity is a little less mabe for some people, but the quality is good 
 apart from that it is a go, and pocket friendly.. :)
The picture of the chicken chowmin in plates is only of one chicken chow pack

Tried from Ketuz for the first time. Had a Non veg combo of Chicken noodles and Chilli Chicken. It was awesome. The chicken pieces were quite big. We also had french fries and Chicken Pakoda. They were lovely as well.

Parcelled dinner for family from the outlet few days back so cannot review about the ambience and decor. Coming to the food we had crispy baby corn for starter and it was so bad in test that difficult to describe. Mixed fried rice was as if boiled rice, vegetables and chicken mixed together and it was surely not fried!! Schezwan chicken was bit okay though. Tried this outlet after I heard good review about it from my relatives but turn out to be hugely disappointing.

Well had food last night. First of all the place is in all white. Even the lights are white which I feel are a complete bummer in anything food. Secondly the washroom is filthy. They have cabins. Finally people might get some privacy. Though an not really sure how do the staff behave with the people in the cabins. The food was pathetic. The chicken chatpota was bad. Had the fried rice and chilli chicken. The spices had not penetrated the rice grain at all. And it tastes very plain. The chili chicken was the only saving grace. But nothing that you will come back again for. Price is around 450 fit the three dishes. One thing nice or rather interesting is the view. You get to see the metro coming and going .

I m a very regular visitor of dis restaurant. My most nearby favorite restaurant. It got a decent white theme as ambience which makes it look clean n spacious. Food is no doubt fantastic. Starting from their veg thali to mutton biriyani or mutton ghuna polau all r very finger licking tasty. Price may seem a bit high...bt it worth ur money. Quantity is good enough. I have interacted wid 1 stuff only n he's good.

A newly opened multicuisine restaurant just beside dumdum station. A decent place to drop in with family and friends. Ambience is nice, moreover the view outside is interesting. You can watch all the trains pass just by you. Waitors are well mannered, food price is standard and they don't charge any VAT or service tax. They provide cabin facility for couples as well (:p). I went there last evening with my wife. We ordered for mixed hakka chowmin and garlic chicken. The chow was very oily but taste was good, the chicken was not that spicy, yet tasteful. They have thali system and they provide home delivery after a certain amount of bill. Not a must visit but yes you can try once. Check the few clicks i have taken.

Had a bitter experience, first of all it's situated in such a odd place. Their washroom had no facility of water, at least expected some back up resources to feed but they gave excuse of machine failure. Now the main thing Food, they taste pretty average but at the price point which is extremely costly. Well not a place worth recommendations.
