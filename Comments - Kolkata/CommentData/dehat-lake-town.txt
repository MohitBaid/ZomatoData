Dehat is a small food eatery/takeaway/delivery shop in laketown which provides amazing parathas and vegetables, along with some other snacks on special orders. They provide onion and pickles along with the parathas. They're aloo paratha, paneer paratha amd cheese paratha is a must try.

Nothing to say much about the ambience... But I'm pretty much impressed with their service... Also the staffs are very courteous... I tried their aloo paratha many times previously... But last time tried the mixed veg paratha and undoubtedly it was mind blowing too...  Pocket pinch is extremely friendly...

Very nice food . I ordered my meal from Zomato and within 20 minutes got the delivery. Gotta say this is one of the fastest service I've received. Now , I had ordered dal makhani, paneer Butter masala, and aloo. 4 plates of dal and 2 each of paneer and aloo added upto Rs.700. that's quite reasonable. It's a hidden gem. Amazing food served. A little spicy though. Overall very good experience.

Ordered food from this place after reading the wonderful reviews. Well ordered a Cheese Onion Paratha with Onion, A Veg Paneer Pulao, A Dal Makhani with Onion and Garlic, and a Gajar Ka Halwa. The Cheese Onion Paratha was perfectly made with adequate amount of Cheese and Onion. Every bite of Paratha tasted of Cheese. Pickle was also provided with the Paratha, but advisable avoid it as it kills the taste of the Paratha. The Veg Paneer Pulao contained Tiny pieces of Paneer, very small pieces of veggies difficult to identify which I thought was carrot, beans etc. The Quantity of the Veg Pulao is less to completely fill an empty tummy mind it... The Dal Makhani was perfectly cooked, tasted nice, gravy was more than the Dal though and the quantity of the Makhani was more than the Pulao. Advisable order an extra Rice to finish the Makhani Dal. Finally the sweet Dish which was Gajar Ka Halwa was  packed in a small container. The Halwa was made with khoya, and had a bit of dry fruits and tasted amazingly nice. Overall the experience was good trying Dehat.

Its basically a takeaway/Delivery at home kinda place. Though there are few chairs kept too if you wanna sit there n eat. You can send your order through whatsapp, n for me thats a BIG plus! 
We have ordered for various dishes from here. The rotis are soft. The cheese onion paratha is simply yummy! The vegerables are good too though the quantity is just about sufficient for 2 people. 
I personally find it a bit pricey for a deliver-at-home joint

Can't stress enough how much I love this little takeaway/delivery joint. Caters one of the best dal makhanis (kali dal) I've ever had at a very humble price. The rice in their pulaos are flavourful and ghee-laden long grained basmati goodness. Excellent parathas (Cheese onion, Aloo pyaaz) and prompt delivery service. Very happy!

The restaurant is a simple dhaba style eatery and don't expect ambience or air conditioning and I have always opted for home delivery. The food is delivered steaming hot and nicely packed. 

¬†Aloo parantha and the dhania mirchi parantha. The other paranthas are good too. The pulao is excellent too made of fine aromatic rice and delicious aroma of ghee with lots of vegetables. Almost all the vegetables are delicious. And on the days they make sweet dish they are a must. The lauki halwa or gajar halwa or even the kheer are must haves.

A simple vegetarian restaurant you cannot go wrong about. I have been a repeat customer of this restaurant for years now and their food quality, quantity and hygiene has remained excellent throughout. 

The restaurant is a simple dhaba style eatery and don't expect ambience or air conditioning and I have always opted for home delivery. The food is delivered steaming hot and nicely packed. 

Paranthas are the usp and must try variants according to me are the aloo parantha and the dhania mirchi parantha. The other paranthas are good too.

And on the days they make sweet dish they are a must. The lauki halwa or gajar halwa or even the kheer are must haves. 

They prepare different vegetables and desserts every day so call them or check on their WhatsApp. They accept WhatsApp orders too. 

And their service is something that keeps me to order from them again and again. Once it happened that they forgot to send one item and we found that when we were about to have dinner. When I messaged them in WhatsApp they apologised for it immediately and offered to send the item then itself. As it was very late in the night I refused the offer and told them to adjust it the next time I order. I did order after more than a week and while ordering I just mentioned about the non delivered item and whether it would be adjusted. They replied with an "ok." And about an hour later I had a hot container of drool worthy kaladal added to my that day's order delivered to my home. No arguments or excuses. 

Mistakes might happen but the way they treat their customers with respect and trust is something that needs to be admired particularly in the restaurant industry.

I was so mesmerised that I tried all three of them on my very first visit. Alu n paneer parathas were good but the must try is  the cheese onion one. With ample stuffings and a garlic chutney , it is definitely a feast for your taste buds.

For simple Home-style Marwadi or North India style food, Dehat is a good place to order from.Has a good clientele, mostly regular customers who come to take away or order to be delivered¬† home. Pure veg , awesome food, nice phulkas laced with ghee,............one should try the gatta jeera curry, allo matar, kadi and ofcourse not to miss the moong dal halwa!
They have been maintaining the standards for long!
Reasonably priced, one can opt for small/medium /large portionsas per requirement!

A simple and wholesome meal offered in an absolutely no frills joint. There is no ambiance but quick service and this place if only with 'khatiyas' would surely be representative of old school dhabas. But the food would be contrasting. Its not oily or unhygenic. 

The parathas which are a relatively recent addition are certainly lip smacking and when they throw in the traditional marwari accompaniments like Lasan Chutni and Pyaaz ka Achar ( all you can eat :) you would feel you have found home.

I would personally recommend sitting there and eating if you do not mind sharing tables but a delivery is also lightning fast. Do visit on a winter night for a sense of palate bursting flavours..!!

This vegetarian food joint at Lake town is famous for authentic 'dehati' food! Offers both dine-in nd home delivery services. It serves piping hot n delicious paranthas in town! The kaali dal served here is famous for it's taste.. The paranthas are bigger than normal size and a couple of them should be enough to fill ur tummy..
My personal recommendation wud b the aloo paranthas!

I personally did'nt find the food quality upto the mark. Might be the paratha's are the USP of this dhaba but the main course items aren't delicious. I ordered the main course food for delivery at home and found only missi roti tasty.. Matar was really poorly prepared..
Will explore some better options next time.

The Kali dal is also nice,if someones has a taste for gatte ki sabzi u get it

When you are not in mood to cook or you have no one to cook call Dehat for home like food. It's serves only vegetarian and price is affordable. Home delivery is available.

I have heard about this place from many people and many people have praised the quality of food so I even ordered for myslf tonight. The food is really very tasty. Piping hot,fresh,adequate quantity,awesum taste. 
I ordered dal makhani, gobi matar,gatte ki sabzi,missi roti,sattu paratha and ghee phulka and normal plain phulka. Everything in just rs. 448. Very economical and pocket friendly.  Guys I should suggest you to try out once at least.

I personally did'nt find the food quality upto the mark. Might be the paratha's are the USP of this dhaba but the main course items aren't delicious. I ordered the main course food for delivery at home and found only missi roti tasty.. Matar was really poorly prepared..
Will explore some better options next time.

Just ordered and savoured food.from this veg joint .... Someone recommended for parathaas and it was no surprise ....
Paneer parathas ... Mix veg parathaas, ... Aloo paranthas, mango pickle, curd , something called gatta/gattu .... Yummy
I will definitely give it another try... :)
But the dough felt a little extra churned and sour and an extra order of 4 rotis was neglected & the money still deducted from the bill >:-(
Some management issue just
Rest all just a big thums up

Having tasted the food of almost all the restaurants in Laketown I can safely say that this place serves the tastiest, most reasonably priced and hygienic food. I have always taken home delivery from here as the restaurant is small and doesn't have a very good dining in ambiance. However the food is such a delight! I love the aloo paranthas which are delivered tawa hot at home. The Paranthas are thick with delicious filling and not oily at all. I also tried the Cheese Parantha and they were good but I liked the aloo paranthas more. I tried almost all the vegetable curries here. Without onion and garlic. My favourites are the mixed vegetable curry, bhindi masala, palak corn, butter paneer and aloo dum. The pulao is delicious too. Fine basmati rice with aromatic Ghee. The paneer is succulent and soft. Definitely recommended.

The aloo parathas here are the best I have tasted in my life and so is the gatte ki sabji.
This place proves the common saying big things come in small packages true.!!
Love love love their food.

As I South Indian I like this food more than my idly and dosa üòâ. Tried different varieties of paratha here, aloo, satthu , Mix veg, paneer , cheese , and dhaniya paratha are so good.

A little food station tucked away in the alleys of Lake Town, this place is very very popular ¬†with the residents here.It specialises in different types of paranthas and authentic Rajasthani cuisine.The food here is lip-smacking and that explains why you shall never find it empty.The paranthas are bigger than normal in size and a couple of them should be enough to full one's tummy.Apart from that, the pyaaz pulao here is, quite a catch.Coming to the Rajasthani fare here, what with Gatte ki Sabji, Lahsun ki Chutney, Kaladal, Moong Besan Laddoo and the likes, they are quite good and served in satisfactory quantities.The ambience here is not much, as they mainly operate as a take-away joint but there is a corner dedicated to seating, for those times when your hunger pangs over-shadow you.The service here is very efficient but not quite quick as at any given point of time in the day, this place is tucked full, and people would have to wait quite sometime to get their hands on food.However, they are very very organised in their services, there's even a CCTV camera through which you can actually see your food being prepared.They also deal big time on home delivery services and have their full menu and the day's special spread out as details on their whatsapp page and all you have to do is type out your order on whatsapp with the delivery details and lo! you shall get ¬†your order delivered to your doorsteps.This is a hassle-free, guilt-free, tummy-fulfilling food hub that would have you coming back for more.Overall, very satisfactory.

Update: Since the last time, I have had quite a few more items here, namely,Butter Paneer, Kadai Paneer, Kadi, Kala Dal, Aamras, Matar Pulao and the likes, and honestly, these are even better than the items I have had previously here.I vouch for this place with all my heart.This place is only getting better with time.It's a must visit, guys!

P.S. ¬†Pyaaz Parantha, Cheese Parantha, Mixed Veg Paratha Gatte Ki Sabzi, Matar Pulao, Paneer Butter Masala, Kali Dal, Lahsun Ki Chutney, Aamras and Churma are personal recommendations.Do try them.

NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. This should be the tag line for a place like this. Dehat offers you authentic Rajasthani delicacies. Never forget to try cheese n onion paratha here. It offers the best cheese and onion paratha of the city. Try varied range of parathas here including missi roti, which is a stand out. You don't need side course with the paratha as they offer wide range of complimentary achars and lasun chutneys. Try one of the best gatta and aloo dry of the town here. The ambience is not good agreed but its a blockbuster in case you are in for a take away of authentic Indian food.

You end up waiting for long and when you their delivery guy he will tell you that the order may take another hour in an extremely casual and unprofessional manner.

Visited Dehaat, Lake Town last week and it was really good to see that now they have a better ambiance where people can sit properly and eat. Dehaat is famous for its vegetarian dishes which are delicious and gives you the typical feel of North Indian home made food. I love almost all the varieties of paratha available starting from Alu Paratha, Muli paratha, Gobi Paratha, Paneer paratha... my favourite however is the cheese paratha. The molten cheese inside the hot parathas are ambrosial. I am also in love with the peas pulao available here. The phulkas are freshly made and a tinge of ghee adds to the softness. They have a wide variety of pickles kept on each table... mango pickle, garlic pickle, onion pickle and green chilly pickle add to the taste of the food. Nowadays they also serve kulcha to the customers. I like the way they serve the papad here... the papads are kept in thin polythene sheets which prevents the papads from becoming soggy while eating. Food is served in paper plates and it is the duty of the customers to discard the soiled plates into the dustbin kept by the basin now. They also do home delivery in the surrounding area so it becomes easier if you want to enjoy the food at home. Also you can order your food in advance if you want to avoid waiting for long.

Remember those days when we stayed in lake town and had dinner over here. Aalo paratha and DAHI was our favourite for dinner. Although we had most of their dishes but we liked aalo paratha the most.

Dehat is a small roadside shop in lake town but do not be deceived by its shabby appearance as it is a great place to have parathas. They make such yummy parathas, my most favorite is the aloo, sattu, cheese and dhanya paratha. Its soft and thick and very delicious.  I often pack food from their and eat it at home with some pickle. It's yummy.

Dehat is heaven for pure vegetarians. They serve food without onion and garlic. The food makes you feel like home. I‚Äôve been ordering food from Dehat since the last 5 years and they have never let me down. Their prices now have increased but still very comfortable to pocket if compared with other restaurants in the area. Ran by Marwari owner the roots of vegetarian food stands strong, they operate from a one room shop in LakeTown and now have a table and seating arrangement for 6 outside the shop. Their main operation is pickup food and home deliveries The shop   is usually crowded and you need to wait for min 15 min before you get your take away parcel, if you visit during late evening, weekends or festive season wait time can increase from 15min to an hour depending on your order.
The menu is small but it‚Äôs a good spread for breakfast/lunch/ dinner. Few items on the menu are dependent on the day of the week you are placing your order. The have also added new items to the menu which was not available earlier. You can order from plain chapattis to cheese paratha. Usual items available are Kali daal, yellow daal (i.e. toor daal), gatte ki subzi, butter paneer, aaloo dum and many other dishes depending on season and day of the week.
My usual orders are aaloo dum, panner butter masala and ghee roti. The ghee roti will remind you of your mom‚Äôs thin light and fluffy roti smeared in ghee. The aaloo dum was non spicy and has mild flavor, you can notice the lack of onion and garlic but you won‚Äôt complain while eating this dish. The paneer gravy was rich in butter, the paneer was soft and you can taste the rich milk fat. The overall experience when I am looking for homely, subtle vegetarian food is amazing. I‚Äôve tried their rice, daal and cheese paratha and you can count on me when I say ‚ÄúIts goooooooood‚Äù.
The food is delivered in a plastic tiffin box with condiments like onion dipped in vinegar, green chilies and various types of pickles. You are advised to order food an hour before you want to eat during weekends or rush hour. The longest delivery time given to me was 3 hours, I ordered food around 7pm and was delivered just before 10pm. Though the owner advised me of the wait time while confirming the order. There are times when they will refuse to deliver due to pending orders and you would need to pick it up yourself, which is also good if you don‚Äôt want to wait for them to deliver and collect your food packet.

Found 'DEHAT' in the Zomato list . Well to start with, I stay besides Dehat(Sharma ji's) pure veg restaurant , and been enjoying the fabulous food past 2 years . How could I not mention about the joint that cooks the most fabulous varieties of parantha's fried in ghee , be it the beautiful gravy items or the dry desserts . Must try for vegetarian people who love Marwari/Gujrati variety of food . Best part of Dehat is mostly based on take away and home delivery in and around Lake town suburbs .
Coming to the cuisines part they use selected ingredients in all their preparations e.g. they use Ashirvad Atta for the roti's and Amul/Govardhan ghee for cooking the paranthas,basmati rice etc .You need to have a bite at "Dehat' to believe my words .Quiet reasonably priced menu very light on pocket but you get the right food .

Getting to the food which they serve on day to day basis and I like the most :
Roti - Plain Roti,Ghee Roti ,Missi Roti(must try)
Parantha - Aloo , Pyaj , Aloo Pyaj , Paneer, Mixed ,Cheese Pyaj, Sattu ,Papad Pyaj ,Govi ,Muli etc
Curry - Gatte ki Sabji , Matar Masala, Veg Korma, Paneer Butter Masala , Dal Tadka , Lauki Kofta,Besan Simla, Papad Mangori,Bharwan Tomato, Corn Paneer , Raita etc (Either of the curries would be available per weekdays and season)
Try the Onion Pickle and Garlic chutney and should have the Gajar Ka Halwa(Seasonal) and the besan ka Laddoo

I should suggest if you need to get the dinner get to "Dehat" before 8:30PM as you may not get all items in the menu also you may try taking away some parantha's variations . They pack the food real nice and neat.

Feeling happy to write ¬†Review for "Dehat" which had been one of my favorite vegetarian food joints around my locality .

Tried out Cheese Pyaz Parartha (Cheese Onion) and the taste was excellant. Each paratha is priced at Rs 32 and is a bit on the higher side but the taste is definitely good.

On the most amazing places to eat some lively paratha in town. A place which can definitely rival delhi's parathe wali gaali. Amazing assortment of parathas and the quite some famous cheese paratha an indian take on the domino's cheese burst pizza. And some lovely home made rajasthani aachars to savour your parathas with. This place is simply amazing!!

A perfect Rajasthani food corner . the food is pretty good with a "ghar ka khana " taste,  but. the specially to die for is  the cheese paratha ......
a must have but only when served hot.,.

overall a nice place for lunch or dinner with punching a hole in the pocket.....

and yes lacks proper sitting arrangements ..

Located right in the heart of Lake Town, Dehat is easy to miss because of its small space. But it offers perfectly authentic Rajasthani food at reasonable prices. The long queues outside Dehat every evening after 6 pm say it all.

Very authentic Rajasthani Food. Just like ghar-ka-khana style cooking. Tha Kadhi and Gatte ka Subzi is fabulous and a must try. If ordering Missi Roti then dont take Gatta because then the meal gets too heavy. The Kali Daal is also worth trying. Very affordable food and good quality too.
