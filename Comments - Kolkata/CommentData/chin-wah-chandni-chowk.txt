The ambiance was great. It is not usually over crowed  like the others in this area. The quality of food is awesome. The staff are polite.  We order chicken fried rice and sliced chilli pork. The fried rice was average but the sliced chilli pork was just awesome. 
The only problem is that it doesn't accept card. It accept only paytm and cash.

A good place to stop by for some good chineese food.
Had the sweet n sour chicken soup its spicy but tasted good.
Tried the schrzwan Gravy noodles and red hot pepper chicken. Both were on the spicier side but was very tasty.
Service is good but the ambience is average.

We had chosen this place to be our destination on a lazy Sunday afternoon..I had visited this place with my girls for lunch..we reached before the deadline..and placed our orders quickly before the kitchen shut down..chicken rice, noodles , red pepper chicken, double spiced pork was ordered along with cold drinks to wash it down..coming to the food, the quantity was great..red pepper chicken was outstanding..loved the spicy and sweet taste..we were so impressed with this this that we ordered for another plate..double sliced pork was great too..prices are pocket friendly.. the lady at the cash counter was very friendly.. loved the food .if you want to have some good chinese at pocket friendly prices then chin wah should be your destination.. I'm coming back soon to have more of the red pepper chicken

Visited this place two yeeks back . A very normal chinese restaurant run by a chinese family. Ambience was not good. No such care taken for customers. Had chicken veg steam rice and red hot pepper chicken. Rice was not good as the veg provided in its smell very bad . Chicken was ok.. nothing special about this food joint.

So this is my second visit to this place and as usual this time also i will give the food 5 star rating..this time i ordered a pork wanton soup whose quantity was enough to share with 3 people and then i ordered hong kong pork which is very tasty and a little bit though spicy and the last was pork fried rice and its quantity was very good again enough to share with 3 people. Guys please if ure seeing my review do come to this place because this place serves the best pork and the price being so cheap and affordable. Also this placr does not have any gst which is the best part ..and so a meal for two is within 500 bucks..so please do come visit this place‚ò∫

We were planning to eat Chinese and as my friends asked me where should we go the name chin wah striked on my mind, as I was waiting come out to this place and try the Chinese from a long time..
So we came to this place..
It was empty not a single customer were there except 2 swiggy delivery boys..
The lights are dim
You'll get to notice a fish tank at the entrance..
You'll have a pure authentic Chinese feel..
Wooden chairs,
We went in for the round table cz it was looking fancy..
We ordered
Wonton, chicken momo, drums of heaven, chilli chicken and mix noodle..
The service was quick, the waiter was polite..
And I must tell you everything that came up to our table was delicious..
We clicked some photo's but due to bad lighting conditions the photo's were not coming soo good, so it might be a problem for the selfie freaks..
Would love to come back to this place for other Chinese dishes..üòç

Horrible place , has a wide variety of menu.
Had a small family function at my place , had picked up chilli chicken and egg fried rice from their place . Was supposed to be a nice treat considering the feedback from the associated people over there . Came home to find out 10 boxes of half burnt rice was packed , even chilli chicken was not oo good , rice was burnt , egg was burnt , the carrots were absolutely undercooked , even the rice felt a bit sticky ; dont know if that was over cooked or had started to rot .
Please avoid this place , they do not care for quality of food too much ; not a very good experience overall . Would suggest people to avoid this place , CHUNG WAH and EAU CHEW which are within stone's throw are much better than this absolute shitty place .
Happy eating

This Sunday would v been an absolute waste, had I not found this eatery!! This is an old eatery situated at a bylane in the heart of the Chandni chowk.. I heard about this place in some foodies group n saw some reviews on Zomato too.. Once, around a year ago, I wished to visit this place, but ended up having my dinner else where. The location z not easy to find, u will surely need the help of the Google map. As, today, I found this place by chance, I wished to give it a try!! The interior will surely disappoint u. It z a very small eatery, n looks very old too. So I decided to take away the food.
I ordered for Chin Wah soup, chin Wah special gravy chow mein n dry sliced chilli pork. As soon as I stated my dinner, I stopped complaining about the place. All of the items were good. The chilly pork was so tasty. The soup was good too, with lots of prawn,chicken pieces n mushrooms in it. The gravy chow mein was better than average.. In one word I just loved this place. Most importantly all these costed me only RS.450. Till date, it is one of the most pocket friendly restaurants, I v ever visited...

Chin Wah is one of those old Chinese eateries which is around for eons and have attained a near-legendary status simply owing to the delicious and authentic Indo-Chinese dishes served at an extremely pocket-friendly rates.. However, the issue is that with time these eateries have failed to upgrade themselves and somewhat lost in their sense of pride and lack of publicity..

Location can be a bit tricky but you shall rely on your Google Map for the same, located close to Mission Row in one of the by-lanes adjacent to Sabir‚Äôs Hotel.. However the interiors seemed to be kinda disappointing, remnants of an old establishment where the signs of ageing are prominent.. However the major issue is definitely the hygiene of this place, firstly the bathroom is not clean enough for a restaurant of this stature and secondly the cutleries seemed to be age-old with signs of rust.. However, I always believe that it is food which should be the ultimate parameter of judgment and hence decide to choose the following dishes:

Chicken Sweet Corn Soup: Sadly the portion of chicken strips was too meager and the soup lacked adequate consistency.. Also the taste seemed to be a bit lacking on everything..

Red Pepper Prawn: Loved the punch of the dish but the prawns were a bit too spicy for a normal palate.. The garlicky chilli flavored prawns were crunchy and delicious, however the dish may not suit the faint-hearted ones..

Special Fried Rice: This dish will score solely on the quantity parameter.. The portions were more than enough for twin-sharing during lunch-time but it failed to explain what so special about the rice which is mostly common mixed fried rice, just a bit more generous in quantity..

Shanghai Fish: Horrible to say the least.. The fish tasted stale and even on being complained the server seemed non-chalant and didn‚Äôt even bother to change it, rather he was adamant that‚Äôs how their fish taste.. Really disappointing as I have heard so many great things about this place which failed to live up in reality..

Overall I doubt if I will ever come back since Nostalgia alone can‚Äôt help when quality and professionalism seemed to be non-existent.. Good thing is they don‚Äôt charge any extra VAT and our total cheque was Rs. 625/- (all incl.) for 2 people..

Food: 2.5/5

Pricing: 4.5/5

Service: 2/5

Ambiance: 2.5/5

Gist: Recommended for good Chinese food at great quantity in affordable price. Spacious restaurant with great food in quantity and quality. Ambience is calm and no decor though.

I visited this place on 15.1.17 about 1.00PM. Bit tricky to find but as the roads were wide so reached at last. They place is big and for 7*4 and 1*6 people can seat in the ground floor, 1st floor is restricted to arrange a party only. A toilet is also there for a single person. A wash basin is placed outside toilet. Ambience & decor felt bit okay type. Staffs are helpful. Ordered Pork Wantan Soup and Red Hot Pepper Prawns. They took 10 minutes to serve but it is okay as preparation can take time. Quantity and quality both satisfied the hunger. Red Hot Pepper Prawns were sweet and spicy both, and bit crunchy also, so enjoyed very much. Will visit again to try other items.

Note : Cards not accepted here which should change.

Although it's a small joint but it is really good. We 4 had been there to taste Chinese food. It is located at temple street if u are not aware about this location you can use google map. They have enough sitting arrangements and stuffs were friendly and they can suggest you which one is to be ordered. Quantity is great. 1 dish is enough for two. We ordered chicken yammain, chicken watmain,  kung poa chicken and pork with chou suru gan choi. Food was mouth watering. Lastly the price was pocket friendly. If you have 200 only u can have great lunch or dinner.

Chin Wah's biggest curse is it's location - tucked inside an otherwise busy Chandni Chowk Lane. If you are familiar with the demography here, you really wouldn't expect an authentic Chinese restaurant to be here. 
Chin Wah's biggest boon - the people who have already discovered this goldmine! People like us! 

Not the most spacious of places, but the staff have a pretty big heart.. and a kick-ass cook. 
Pork dishes are a must try!

If you are visiting here for the first time, I recommend the Fried Wantons. It's freakin' addictive!

Moderate chinese food with ample quantities and economic prices. It was bit of a letdown for the high expectations I had. A satisfactory and pocket friendly choice for chinese cuisine if you are in the area.

**It's not all that difficult to find.Just get to the 'pankha market' in chandni chowk(ask anybody for directions) and walk straight ahead on the main street with your eyes open. You won't miss it.

This is a hidden gem. A bit difficult to locate for first timers. From Sabir if you walk towards Lenin Sarani, take left to Temple Street. The restaurant will be on your right after couple of minutes. It is hard to believe that a family run Chinese restaurant exists within Chandni Chowk.

Ambiance is pretty basic. But comfortable. Food is excellent. The meat balls soup is a must try, specially on winters. Noodles and rice quantity is enough for two. The gravy fish noodles is another must try dish here.¬† Service is fast. 

If you are around and want some good Chinese, do not give this place a miss. It opens only for lunch and dinner.

While every year the number of Chinese eateries in this city is increasing, it is also true that most of them either fail to make a mark or are too expensive for a casual weekday meal. It is the old, family run Chinese eateries, that take care of people like us, who want some tasty, filling meal of noodles and rice, anytime of the week. Chin Wah is one of them. Tucked away in an inner lane of Chandni Chowk, this place is a bit tough to locate.

I had been planning to go to this place for quite some time and now it has come to the place is situated off Chandni Chowk you might have some trouble finding it now coming to the restaurant itself the Ambience is okay the ACs are pretty good and there is more or less enough space. The food is tasty! But i had expected a lot more. N the service was a bit late. Maybe due to some technical reasons on that day.
But still dis place is a must check out!

Went there for light lunch, had their sliced chilli pork, chicken honey noodles and devil's chicken. Food was good enough, especially the sliced chilli pork and honey noodles. The devil's chicken was not that good though, it was tangy and the pieced were very small. It had green peas in it which I think I hv never seen in any Chinese side dish.it was a okayish experience. The place is hard to find though. The bill was Rs. 475.

I wonder why this place is has been called as one of the authentic Chinese restaurants in kolkata. ¬†
After having today's lunch there, I must say that the tag line of 'authentic chinese food' suits them really well.

cost- 350/- ( around)

Dishes ordered- 1. schezwan rice ; 2. chilli sliced pork

interior- 5.5/10

service- 7/10 (preparation took a lil bit time more than usual)

taste- 10/10 (dishes does not look great; i mean the presentation was not at all good but if you cam overcome your fear of having blacking pork slices then you will get to know why this place is so famous :D) *jokes apart :p

location- 4.5/10 ( a bit difficult to locate in the midst of chandi chowk market full for shops and vendors!)
¬†
i WILL OFCOURSE RECOMMEND THIS PLACE :)

Meh food, meh service, meh ambience: Chin Wah for you.
Was in the Chandni area and really really hungry, and this place being on the cards, we went there.
I liked the pretty aquarium but then the horrid dark lighting was not really soothing at all. 
Then came the harried waiter who couldn't recommend a dish sans pork. He was like "sab accha hai"
I'd heard good things about the fish chowmein, and the vegetables with fish and rice, so we ordered that, with some hot and sour soup.
Food took really long to come up, and unfortunately the soup was very overloaded with soy, slightly gloopy, not a strong stock in their soup. Plus the prawns were few and not deveined.
Fish chowmein came with a corn starch based gravy (again no strong stock means not a very good gravy) but the noodles were thick, well cooked and tasty plus the fish was fried well, and very tender inside.
Fish with vegetables and rice tasted exactly same to the chowmein. Sane mild strachy gravy with lots of vegetables and rice. Rice was parcooked, not quite up to the mark. But the vegetables and fish were spot on.
Portions were very generous, and bill came to around ‚Çπ500. 

What is needed: More originality, more good variations in the menu. Good service and well informed waiters. 
I've heard very good things about the pork here, so if you're a pork lover, you can try out. Else if like me, avoidable unless there's no other option left. 
Won't be coming back again!

Our undying, endless love for Chinese food has always kept us on our toes to hunt down cheap but good unexplored places that serve the same. On the fruitful end of one such hunt, Chin Wah the restaurant tucked away in the maze of by-lanes in Chandni Chowk market, waited for us one evening with its doors opened wide. There were numerous good reviews and ratings for this place on Zomato, which had upped our expectations considerably. We ordered for Sliced Chili Pork and Chicken Garlic Hakka Chow. After some while they served the chow and took 7 more minutes to bring in the pork. One look at the food and we were quite disappointed with the quantity. One plate of chow is just about sufficient for only one person, unlike most other places where we can easily split a plate among two. Next, the pork didn‚Äôt look much inviting as we had ordered for the dry dish but was served one with a slight watery base of soya sauce instead. Coming to the taste, the garlic chow had absolutely NO traces of garlic in it. It tasted extremely bland and devoid of the zing which is usually expected of a spicy Chinese preparation in Kolkata. The pork was just about okay. Personally, I prefer a lot of the soft and greasy pork fat in my dish but this one was almost lacking in it. Well, that could‚Äôve been pardoned as preferences differ and they wanted to be on the safe side but the normal pork slices were hard to chew on and felt rather rubbery to us. Also, the Chili Pork had a handful of sliced green chilies strewn over but there was no heat in it and the dish had inadequate flavors altogether.

We went in with a lot of fervor and came out feeling disheartened as the place turned out to be nothing that we‚Äôd thought of. It goes without saying that we aren‚Äôt planning a second visit anytime in the distant future.

A 4.1 rated restaurant on Zomato located on the streets of Chandni Chock attracts Chinese lovers very easily. With a higher rating & authentic Chinese food tag that is also in Chandni Chowk, by all this expectations from this restaurant gets higher by leaps & bounces. 

Location : This one is little hard to find. You need to go to the old fans market over in Chandni Chowk that is Temple Street. You will find it on that road.

Decorations : Just by entering into the restaurant you can see their special Chin Wah sauces in a showcase & an aquarium on top of that. On the right hand side there is a big reception table decorated with artificial flowers & Zomato tags well. Old newspapers hanging on walls saying about this restaurant makes the interest level little higher. The restaurant is neither very big nor too small. There are two dining connected together. Both of the dining was very simply decorated with sittings of 4 people on a table. Blue & warm white lightings were decent & creates a good ambience.

Staffs & Management : At the time when we visited this restaurant it was almost empty. Lags of staffs were noticed. The reception guy took our order by coming to our table. Behavior of the staff was very good, he easily explains us their special dishes & recommend us dishes too. However they took a long time to serve the food. Don't go over there if you are dying out of hunger.

Foods : By reading some of the reviews about this restaurant on Zomato & with the recommendation of their staffs, We ordered their highly rated dishes & they came one by one...

Szechuan Fried Rice : The rice looked very rich with deep orange colour in every grain. Red dried chillies, nicely chopped little vegetables & mixed spiced made it hot. However the rice used were of very average quality & felt very dry. A little excess amount of oil was there. The quantity per plate was kind of average. Their Szechuan Rice doesn't tasted as good as I expected.

Sliced Chilli Pork : The first thing that I noticed was its quantity. There was very few pieces of sliced pork with fried onions & chopped green chillies on top of it. It was bit on the oilier side. Pork pieces were somehow cooked. Rich spices seems to be there but that doesn't tasted good at all.

Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken Boneless : There were 6 small pieces of chicken in a plate. With some chillies & little onion fried on top of it. The dish was absolutely dry, unfortunately the chicken pieces were extremely dried that it doesn't felt good at all. On the other hand the chicken pieces were hard & not cooked well. Chicken pieces felt tasteless from inside. A rich oily & red chilli paper fragrance were there. However the quality & quantity both disappointed me.

Chin Wah Fried Mei Foon : The bowl of Mei Foon with lots of sliced vegetables mixed looked pretty good. A different kind of fragrance coming from it was impressive. Noodles were very nicely fried just the right way it should be. Vegetables & spices were mixed together well that itself tasted nice. However it was on a bit oilier side. Quantity was average over here. 

Pricing : Their prices seems low & affordable. Every dish was significantly paired with its price. Unfortunately looking at the quantity & quality the prices doesn't look good to me. On the other hand the overall experience of their dining it seems average.

Conclusion : Chin Wah of Chandni Chowk doesn't came up to the mark with their quality & quantity of food. The rating about this restaurant is simply not deserving. Being in Chandni Chowk if you are looking for Chinese food then Crystal Chimney is a far better option than this.

Chin wah, we have been waiting for a long time to visit this restaurant. Finally, we got the chance yesterday. After watching Deadpool at Inox, we planned to visit Chin Wah. It was a wee bit hard to locate the store. At last, we found it with the help of GPS and local people. The ambience is nice. The waiter sgiwed us our table. We ordered chicken hakka chowmein and sliced chilli pork. The food came within ten minutes. The Chicken hakka chowmein was adequate for two people. It was delicious. The sliced chilli pork was heaven. It was delicious. Whenever I put a pork slice in my mouth, i was experiencing foodgasm. The food was excellent. One con though, one of the waiters was a bit nosy. He standing behind us all the time while we were eating. It was feeling really uncomfortable and irritating. I hope to get a better service the next time.

Fair....if u compare the food according to its price....i would say it was fair....
But if i strictly focus on taste of the food, not very satisfied....expected a little more..

Like we ordered meifoon and garlic red pepper chicken, which the waiter claimed would be spicy....but when it was tasted, it wasnt much spicy and meifoon was not satisfactory....
Don't know if its there own traditional taste, since we indians eat much more spicy food than them....

As dreadfully tiresome as the interior of the restaurant felt when I visited there, I definitely cannot say the same for the food. Although, we did not order much, we tried the szechuan fried rice, red hot pepper chicken and the sliced chili pork. The items tasted delightful and none of the flavors(particularly the spicy items) were overwhelming.

The portions were fine for 2 people and the service was fine - nothing to comment on really. And something that I also like was that the place is really light on the pocket, especially since it kind of has a reputation for decent food.

I would easily recommend this place to anyone interested in having chinese.

Location: In one of the bylanes of Chandni Chowk. 

Having heard of Chin Wah from a lot of foodies got me interested into visiting this place and finally, when was around Chandni Chowk for work affairs, decided to drop by. Let me take a minute to thank the Google maps to help me reach this place and cross the confusing bylanes. :P
Chin Wah seems to be here for years now and is counted among one of the good Chinese joints in Kolkata. Having run by a family, the legacy continues.
Entered the place at around 12:40 hours to be welcomed by warm smiles of the manager and the owner into their simple and not so flashy restaurant. The decor wasn't something to feel great about and looked similar to the old day arrangements.
Having seated, me and my colleague started with our contemplating process only to realize that Chin Wah was predominantly famous for its non-vegetarian delicacies and the menu gave proof of the same. Finally, the last page with the vegetarian dishes brought hope to us and we continued with our order:

- Hot and Sour Soup
The soup was nice to taste and had a nice balance of flavors. Adding a little vinegar did make it taste better.

- Sweet Corn Soup
Slightly thick in consistency, the soup was average as there was very little sweet corn to be found. More or less looked similar to the Hot and Sour soup except the color. Has scope of improvement.

- Chilli Babycorn
Batter-fried babycorn tossed along with slit green chilies, thinly sliced onion and seasoned with pepper & salt. Was visually as different as it was in taste. Crisp and delicious it was. However, was slightly greasy.

- Hakka Noodles
Perfectly boiled noodles tossed along with thinly chopped spring onions, carrots and onion with zero seasoning. The dish failed to impress. Had negligible salt and no other flavoring-agent. Was oily in nature too.

- Fried Rice 
Perfectly cooked rice tossed along with fresh carrots, spring onion, peas and sweet corn. Well-seasoned and delicious to taste it was.

- Vegetable Manchurian (6 pieces)
Decent tasting dumplings tossed in a mildly flavored gravy. Tasted nice. Could have been better.

The SERVICE wasn't as speedy as expected (we were the only ones at the restaurant) and inclined towards the slower end. The STAFF except the manager was found to lack knowledge of their fare.
PRICES were found to be set at reasonable bars.

Overall was a decent experience.
- Not really authentic, yet, delicious.
- Could have been much better.

Not as startlingly authentic as Tung Nam of Chhattewali Gali, nor devoid of soul and character as the hordes of crowd-pleasing Chinese restaurants in this city, Chin Wah is Chandni Chinese at its best. In the great traditions of Eau Chew - minus, of course, the Chimney Soup! Just don't let yourself get misguided by the best efforts of the waiter, and you will be all right.

Out of these, the crispy chicken & the Hot Garlic chicken were the best.
This being one of my favorite family dinner restaurant is a hidden gem. Situated in the heart of Chandni chowk, this place serves good & hygienic Chinese food. Do try the food out & make happy memories with ur friends & family.

On a hot summer Sunday afternoon I was sitting in Broadway and having beer. While sitting there I was scrolling through Zomato when I found this restaurant called ChinWah and found it to be very close to where I was. I was planning to have lunch at Eau Chew but thought of giving this place a chance to impress me. I had to walk 5minutes and found the restaurant in Pakhawala galli. As soon as I entered the ambience impressed me. Calm and cool with matching decorations and soothing lights. I settled down and went through the menu. It was surprisingly cheap. I decided to jump to main course striaghtaway. I chose shrimp pork fried rice and the Chinese lady taking the order suggested sliced chilly pork. The food was served fairly quick and neatly. At first look I thought the quantity was a little less than other restaurants but once I dug in to them, oh I was simply mesmerised. Amazing taste and perfect blend of flavours. The fried rice was great but I simply loved the sliced chilly pork. It was really hot and spicy and I had to keep gobbling glass after glass of water but the flavours were too good. When I go back, and I will very soon, I'll make sure that I order that dish. My suggestion about this place is a must visit.

I like this place whenever I am in chadni chowk area and I have chinese food craving. recently I visited Chin Wah and ordered the pan fried chowmein. I ordered chily garlic chicken for sides. It was toooooo spicy!! I mean i drank close to 4 glasses of water. I asked them, they said they normally make it spicy. So i would suggest not to go for this if you cant have spicy food.
The quality is good. The place is really not somewhere which will grab attention. But do pay a visit here. food is worth trying!

If you want to taste original Chinese food, then this is another option one can try. It is located at one end of chandni chowk in temple street. Food is good in terms of taste, quality and quantity. Staffs are also prompt and good. Their pork & prawn dishes are worth mention.

Good things in life need a little waiting for. This place is exactly that kind. The wait in question is the time you would need to find out the place. Always ask for directions to reach this place from the e mall crossing.
The place was empty at around 7 30 and the ambiance is nothing to write about. They even had the same song on loop playing in the background.
We went for the sliced chilli pork, chin wah soup, rice in fish and vegetables and devils pork. The sliced chilli pork is one of the best in the city! Period! It was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of heat and almost no fat! Awesome! The soup with prawns chicken and mushrooms was good too. Loved the fact that they had not over thickened it with cornflower. The rice with vegetables and fish was comfort food at its best. All the vegetables shone through. Really nice. The devils pork was strictly OK compared to the other dishes. It was over coated and was not as tasty. 
The service was prompt and the portions of the dishes are excellent. Pricing is pretty decent with no extra taxes added.
Go try out this place. It is a gem.

Are you tired? ¬† Dejected? Sad? Indulge in a bowl of Chin Wah special soup. Angry?
Indulge in a bowl of Chin Wah special soup.
Dispappointed? Indulge in a bowl of Chin Wah special soup.
Truly Happy? Indulge in a bowl of Chin Wah special soup.

Chin Wah is the El Dorado for Chinese-food Junkies. Hidden in the meandering alleys of Chandni Chowk, in Temple Street, this place makes you toil hard for your bounty.

Order the Chin Wah special soup. Feel blessed. It's a pity they've stopped serving Benjo Prawn. They used to go wonderfully well with the soup.

Order the Pork momo. Steamed. Take a minute to lust over the translucent outer cover of the momo. Notice how it cocoons the faintly visible granules of minced pork inside. Bite into it. Experience foodgasm.

Go through the menu, order anything that has Chin Wah special written beside it.¬†
They have still maintained an extremely moderate price point. One portion of the main course dishes serve two at least.

This rating is basically for just the food that they prepare. Amazing and authentically chinese it is. On a sunday, when we had to give a queue behind 20 people at tung fong in park street, I decided to shift my base to chandni. There I landed up near the e mall and gave them a call as temple street was difficult to locate. They directed us. This one is in chandni markaet near the pankha market and you a alk straight to find this beautifully lit restro amidst the crowded streets of chandni. We entered to see all balloons and beautiful lights which gave it a colourful look. Straight to business , we got in the menu and decided to settle for drums of heaven as the starter. Amazingly crispy and tasty. Then of course we did the main course.  The schezwan chicken rice and the pork fried rice teamed with chicken manchurian and red hot pepper chicken.  The red paprika added to the taste of the pepper chicken and it tasted amazing. A highly recommended dish .. and the schezwan rice is a must try.  And it is too cheap to believe.  And for people who crave for chinese. Possibly this is one of cleanest and tastiest authentic chinese restaurants in kolkata.  A must try.  I am definitely going back soon.

Although this place might be difficult to locate, Google maps guided us right to the doorsteps of chin wah. The moderate sized dining place was vacant and although the decor might not have been resplendent, it was modestly adored with a few paintings and hangings of Tibetan origin. The servers were genuinely polite and a dirty glass was promptly replaced on request. For starters we ordered chicken momo and chilli garlic pepper chicken. The former was filled with herbs and tasted quite different which we liked while the latter was very spicy. Next we opted for chicken rice noodles and teamed it with schezwan chicken and chilli chicken dry. It might have been that we had exaggerated our expectations from chin wah, but somehow the rest of the dishes let us down. The rice noodles was too steamy, the schezwan chicken tasted quite bland and the chilli chicken was just average. Unfortunately prices are also not on the lower side with 12 pcs of a chicken side dish costing about ‚Çπ240. If i get a chance I'll give chin wah another go hoping it will change my views of it.

Okay lets start off by saying that if I'm in mood for AUTHENTIC Chinese, me and my dad don't look beyond this place.
My dad had grown up in Chadni Chowk and so he knew this place from the very beginning.
Honestly, I've hardly known very few people who know this place. But I know people who once visited this place, never really opted for any other place for authentic chinese,
I wouldn't pick a particular favourite. Because trust me, ALL the dishes are amazing. Service is prompt. It's empty almost half the times. But it's fine. Heavenly tastes are not really meant for all. ;)
Overall an absolutely lovely place. :)

Dissapointment with a capital 'D'!! After reading so many reviews glorifying their chinese,the let-down i felt when i tasted the food was huge. 
Ambience wise,its soullessly average.But no amount of air-conditioning can substitute taste.
We ordered the meat ball soup,which was good,though nothing extraordinary compared to the tirretty bazar meatball soup which is ordinarily available there. Next, we asked for satay chicken but it was unavailable,which was disappointing,because it was a dish i'd pre-decided to have before coming and they simply let me down.
So we ordered a steamed rice with pork and vegetables,hot garlic pork and the sliced chilli pork everyone commended.The rice was good,but the pork dishes were the disasters of the day.The pork chilli had no flavour,the slices tasted wierd,the gravy tasting almost entirely of just soya sauce. The garlic pork was disgusting,it was sweet,and no garlicky taste could be found.
Frankly speaking,if i'm in thr neighbourhood and want to have chinese,i'd rather go to tung nam in tiretty bazar,which is a much better option(though zomato keeps maintaning its shut down,it is,actually,flourishing with its beautiful chinese flavours).
The soup and the rice fetched them 3 and nothing else.Pork lovers,i would suggest you not to torture yourself with the indiscernible odd-tasting chunks of pork.

Personally one of my favourite eating joints. The only negative thing i can think about when i think about Chin Wah is the fact that it is pretty difficult to find, however once you do take the trouble to find it, it is well worth the effort. I suggest the delicious meat ball soup which is YUMMY. And the prices are all inclusive of tax. Chin  Wah really has a beautiful old world charm about it.

Chin Wah is one gem of a chinese restaurant located on temple street at a 5 mins walks from the main chandni chowk crossing !!!

Did cross the place so many times over the years but regret having not tried the same ever. The place is spacious inside though not much of a decor to talk about. It might not look that big from outside but could accommodate quite a good crowd inside. The air condition works well and the staff id polite, prompt to ensure a good meal.

Coming to food the prices are very reasonable, quantities pretty generous and the ingredients top notch. I tried their steamed momos which was very different from what i have had so far but absolutely amazing. The filling was not plain simple inside but was sauteed in hot garlic sauce and the ginger was adding to the flavours. The fried rice was pretty well made but dint like the use of corn in them.The mix veg had great ingredients and loved the preparation. 

Overall loved my first experience here and looking forward to a lot many of them but my only grudge would be lack of vegetarian options !!!

My partner had spotted this place some time back and we headed there yesterday.
Location is a bit tricky if you are not familiar with Chandni.
The setting is simple, nothing of much decoration but neat and clean.
Ambiance-wise okay. Not loud music. Not loud people around either, which is great for us.
Staff was well mannered. Prices are okay. And they have chopsticks too :D
We ordered Sliced Chilly Pork and Hong Kong Fried Meifoon.
The pork was awesome. Well cooked meat, not flabby at all; nice flavors, spicy but not a riot of chilies . Really enjoyed the dish. Meifoon tasted different, not the regular meifoon, but not very special either.
The bill came at Rs 315. Very reasonable for the food and the time we spent there.
Will be back to taste more pork dishes. Hoping for some more treats for our palates !!

You cannot find this chinese restaurant of your own unless you are taken to it for the first time by a foodie friend. It has the authentic cantonese feel both in food and ambience

Went to this place yesterday. Didn't take much time thanks to my friend's GPS (always comes in handy, helped me finding a the last 5 restros we went). The decor of the place is nice and simple, having a big seating arrangement for around 30 35 people. The restro was empty when we reached there so the service was totally concentrated to us. We ordered for Chin Wah Special Chowmein, Crispy Chicken and Sliced Chilli Pork but a girl came to help us out(supposedly the owner of the place) with the side dish as we like to have a side dish with some gravy so she recommended Sczewan Pork. The starter i.e. Crispy Chicken was nice but was not spicy as told by the person taking the orders. On the other hand the Chowmein and the Pork side dish really blended well together and the quantity was also enough. As a whole we really njoyed the food we had and I really thank them for the recommendation and the service :-)

The very mention of Chin Wah brings back many a happy memory for me. It was a family favorite and I remember many many delicious meals there with my parents. If you like simple heart food in a unpretentious setting at pocket friendly prices then Chin Wah makes for an excellent choice. Many thanks to my fellow foodie Manjari for writing a lovely review for it and reminding me that I had not written a review for it.  
We would start our meal with their delicious Wanton Soup ( I love Wanton Soup if you refer to my previous reviews you will see it mentioned regularly) and this is one of the few places where you get the Pork Variety which is simply delicious. This would be followed by our standard order of the Special Chowmein along with Sliced Chili Pork and Boneless Hot Garlic Chicken. Portion sizes are quite generous and the degree of cooking perfect. They are very obliging if you ask them to put a little less spice as per your individual taste. Service time is decent and if I am there a bit early I am happy to order the Wanton Soup and get the rest parceled for dinner later. 
For those of you who enjoy Kolkata style Chinese this place is a must try.

Calcutta's cuisine is incomplete without those old Chinese family eateries. Nestled in the by-lanes of busy busy Central Calcutta these hidden gems are a delight and once you know what to order you shall surely be on a culinary roller-coaster .Chin Wah is one such gem.

The trick is to know what to order in order to truly appreciate this joint. So your usual Rice noodles and Noodles do not deserve any mention . They are oily, over cooked and definitely not something I would recommend but once you know what to order I am sure this will become a regular affair in one's outdoor dining.

The decor is very warm since they treat their customers as their own and you have family members who constantly come and go. The lighting is a bit dark and there are a few Chinese wall decorations and a few chandeliers but what I like best is the little bell attached to the door which rings every time you come in or go out.  There is an aquarium on one side of the eatery another typical decor of those old fashioned Calcuttan Chinese eateries which would usually attract little children and keep them busy while their parents stole a few minutes of togetherness. the place is clean but simple.

I highly recommend their wanton soup. Now you can either opt for the Wanton noodle soup which comes with 6 succulent wantons and noodles with vegetables or the Wanton soup with 12 wantons. If subtle delicate yet beautiful taste is not your taste buds best friend then you should probably avoid this place . For people who love the delicate flavours this is a treat indeed. The main flavour comes from the beautiful meaty stock. It is full of flavours and amazing. You have little bits of bok choy and the green mustards. The wantons are silky , soft and thinner than translucent paper and the surprise element is the meat inside. if you opt for the pork filling you get this unique dried meat which is such a delicacy in itself. What I love best is the balance of all flavours, so the mildly bitter mustard greens are a perfect blend with the salty dried meat inside the soft silky wantons. This soup is not served in those tiny little bowls that most restaurants serve your soup in. Their crockery might not match but what you get is a big old school bowl of soup and one bowl is perfect for an entire meal.

The steamed rice with vegetables and pork is a dish which is utterly delicious, extremely simple and perfect for all seasons. So what you have is rice with lots of vegetables again bok choy, mustard greens, cauliflower, carrots , beans etc with succulent tender meat in a sticky gravy and all of this together makes ti a light yet perfect dish. One order is enough for two hungry souls.

The other two dishes which I can personally recommend are the chili garlic chicken or Pepper Garlic chicken. The meat is outstandingly well prepared , its soft yet has a perfect bite to it and for those who like their meat hot hot hot there is the Chili garlic chicken and for the ones who are less fiery you have the pepper chicken. It is a dry gravy which makes sense to every nook and cranny of your taste buds. It is best enjoyed with a plate of steaming hot rice. The best part s that you get to choose between 6 pieces or 12 pieces as per the number of diners , your hunger etc.

The prices are not amazingly economic . So a bowl of wanton soup, steamed rice with vegetable and pork and a 6 piece Chili garlic chicken comes to about Rs345. Dining out cannot get more economic than this.

Finding Chin Wah is a bit of a difficulty if you are uninitiated with the Chandni area, but it sure is worth the trouble if you manage to locate it. Try asking for Temple Street first, and upon reaching the Temple St stretch ask around for the place. Note the opening hours carefully and also it remains closed on Tuesdays. 

It is a small Chinese joint sticking to its basic strengths and trying to make a mark. The positives of this place is that its a very tidy, neat place serving very decent chinese fare at a very reasonable rate. Going by their quantity, you even might say that it is pretty cheap. Staff is decent and helpful regarding food choices. You wont be disappointed while trying out their suggestions.

We were a hungry gang of five and we ended up ordering a Sliced Chilly Pork, Schezwan Pork, Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken and a Veg Manchurian along with Veg Fried Rice, Chin Wah Special Fried Rice, Mixed Chow Mien and Cuptai (Pork Liver) Chow Mien. The Fried Rices were extremely good with just the right amount of everything. Many places mess up their rices but they had it bang on. The chicken dish was also a favorite with us. The Chow Miens were pretty okay. Sliced Chilly Pork had a distinct smoky flavor which a few of us did not prefer, but personally the distinctly different pork dish, while considering the familiarity of Pork Schezwan, was something i liked. All of these was enough to satisfy our appetite. The bill came at around 1030/- and we were pretty elated to see that there was no extra tax added to the menu prices.

Overall it was a happy filling experience that will be subjected to many revisits. You are urged to add this place on the list of your culinary escapades.

This Restaurant is the perfect example of being simple and excellent .. It sticks to the basics but the taste is exceptionally good.. Be it the Noodles or soups or  chilly pepper prawns.. Specially the Gravy noodles .. Everything is just lip smacking..  I love having my Chinese food here.. Staff is pretty warm n good ..
Ambiance is homely.The owner is so nice that i feel like visiting this place often.. food is quite reasonable and every penny spent is worth the price.
