I didn't know about this restaurant,though i have come to the diamond plaza a lot of times,i thought of trying something new so this restaurant.
the interiors were good,
the staffs were wearing a red santa cap as it was christmas and they greeted us well.
Music is a big thumbs down,when it plays from the t.v its just the t.v speakers nothing else,no popular songs were played.coming to the order.
Starters-
Orange piroska mocktail
Watermelon and basil cooler
Malai kebab
Main course-
Tandoori roti
butter nun
Chilli fish
All were okay nothing exciting or too tasty.

Food is tasty. Tastiest duck ever. Smoked duck. Fish and chips was also worth it. And chicken spring roll. Sure it takes time to serve you the food after giving the food. But they do serve the fresh and hot food. Not like some other restaurants who just serves you just warming it up.service is good. Ambience is also good. Lovers can easily come here.

As my rating shows I'm very happy with the place. The first thing I liked is that it has ample space and good lighting(actually I'm not in favour of those dimly lit shady places). The minimalist decor is also pleasing for the eyes. They also arrange private parties.
Coming to the food:
First, the mocktails-- kiwi crush with pineapple was a real winner., masala coke and fresh lime soda(at first it was bit too tangy but as soon as we raised the issue they provided the sugar syrup)were good as well.
Then, the starters--we had chicken wings in barbecue sauce and chicken lat mai kai. Both tasted quite good.
In the main course we ordered butter naan, garlic naan, chicken kadhai, bhuna gosht.
Garlic naan was not commendable and I missed the bhuna smell in mutton. Otherwise the gravy tasted pretty good.
I must add that the attendants were very helpful and service was quick enough.
Overall it's a good place to visit.

A couple of months ago, I gave a nasty review to the sector 5 outlet. Whatever I said in there weren't lies, so I was very perplexed about walking into this one. However, I decided to take a leap of faith and walked into it. The fact that Diamond Plaza has limited options helped in the decision making process. First things first, the area is quite big, and the decor, though minimalist, is quite hip. We ordered crispy garlic pepper fried fish, schezwan chicken fried rice, and lemon honey chicken. Boy, was I surprised and impressed with the quality of their food. The starter contained 8 pieces of chicken, and was very tasty with the right amount of crisp. Schezwan fried rice was good and not overly done. The superstar was however, the lemon honey chicken. Made with ample amount of honey, lemon, cashew, ginger, and of course, chicken (shredded), this dish was a burst of flavors in my mouth. Since it is actually sweet, it went perfectly with the fried rice. Even after the food got over, I continued slurping up the gravy. That's how well made it was. Service was relatively fast. The manager and the waiters were extremely courteous. They are yet to get their alcohol license. For now, they do have an array of mocktails on offer. The icing in the cake is that the prices are extremely reasonable. The only thing they can improve on is the variety in the desserts section. I hope the Sector 5 outlet can learn from these guys. It is under the same management after all.

Okay, let's say that it has very good ambiance and has great interior and music, but I am little disappointed in their quality of food. 
We ordered Green Chili Smoked Chicken for  starters and it was okaish. It was very spicy, but the smoky flavour did not catch up with the taste buds. It was just very chili not smoky.
For the main course we ordered Spaghetti with Chicken in Arbiatta flavour that comes in the tomato sauce. It has subtle taste of tomato. But there was something missing. There was no proper flavour of oregano or that in that case I did not feel that we were having Italian!
I don't know how their other dishes taste, but I was not quite happy with these dish!

An unexpected winner and a pleasing surprise. Hospitality and flavors are the show stealers with ambiance being an amazing add on. The attendants being extremely good at their jobs, you will always be well attended. A beautiful concoction of savor, mood and presentation.

I had high hopes but I'm disappointed.

Here goes my review..

We had chilli garlic Hakka noodle, garlic rice, chilli garlic prawn, butter garlic fish, crispy pepper prawn and mango blossom.
The food quality needs to be improved. Packaging was mediocre as we choose to take away food. My rating is only based on the prawn and butter garlic fish we had which was only eatable tasty item amongst all of it.

Red Kitchen & Lounge,an interesting addition to the dum dum nagaerbazar locality.  Located at 5th floor of Diamond plaza mall , beside Bhojohori Manna, It is one of its kind. one thing you will definitely notice that it is huge and seating arrangements are well spaced. Full of positive & young vibe this place definitely ticks the ambiance box. This place offers a variety range of mocktails at extremely reasonable price. The quality and the quantity of mocktails are commendable . Now lets discuss the main course.  I haven't tried the Indian cuisine here but whatever i have observed they looked fantastic. My recommendations are mexicana pizza, grilled BBQ prawn,  Cajun fish finger , Kiwi crush and coffee & praline parfait. 
Definitely a place for multiple visits.... :)

Best Restaurant in Dumdum till date.
Loved the food and its ambience. Quite a large area with a space completely reserved for private parties like birthday, anniversary etc.  One must indulge into starters, they are delicious! No tails are extremely good.

The quality of food served here just sucks!!!
We'd ordered wok tossed mixed rice which was completely bland & tasteless. The side dish we ordered was Tai Chicken or something which had chicken balls put in a gravy that only tasted ginger & soy sauce. Moreover the size of the chicken pieces were too small.
We ordered Crispy chilli baby corn, where the baby corn smelled like rotten. After informing, at first they disagreed & then to make up the problem, a complementary caramel custard dessert was served.
The hospitality was good, I wish they had some quality food to fill hungry stomachs.

So the red hot chilli pepper has opened several other outlets in the city quite before, this is the first in this area, situated in  the diamond plaza mall opposite to Aditya academy school, in the same floor as PvR, next to bhojohori manna!!!

 Now coming to the ambience there were no other diners except I and my friend, it's quite spacious but with very minimal lighting, its clean and vacant!!!

They had only mocktails, may be they've not got the liquor  licence yet , I'm just guessing as they just offered us the drinks menu saying try some mocktails!!!

As we were in a hurry we just had a chilli garlic noodles along with green pepper chicken as the side dish, it took them 20 mins to serve this inspite of having an emptied restaurant and only two diners, the noodles was spicy which I liked but it was over moistured and the chicken had a stale smell for which we just had the bellpeppers and not the chicken but the servers tried their best so no issue about them!!! I just wish they lift up their food quality so as to utilise the place !!!
