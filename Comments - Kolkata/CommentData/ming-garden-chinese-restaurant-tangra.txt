We are regular customers of Ming Garden. We have been dining at this restaurant for the past three years. Itâ€™s located next to Golden Joy. Most of the food items are literally extraordinary and the price is also reasonable. The staffs are not really professional but they are very nice and polite to customers. This is the one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever been in China town.

Here I have visited several times. One of the popular restaurant in China Town area. The food was cheaper compare to any other restaurants across the city. The starters were good. Good place to hang out with friends. If you are a regular drinker then it might be the best place for you.

Located just next to Golden Joy, fair area of parking place, staffs are not that professionally trained however service is good. We had ordered for pepper chicken dry and black pepper fish. Both the items were good, I personally liked the chicken most. In main course we had only a mixed noodles and a mixed fried rice which were standard in taste. The rate of drinks were on the higher end, a 750 ml of blenders pride is charged 1660 rupees, beers are also pretty expensive. Smoking zone is just outside.

I have been a regular customer of this place since the past five years. Great food and nice ambience. Specially the behaviour of the staff members is really appreciable . Quality food is served and they have been maintaining their quality over the years. I am highly impressed by this place. Here's chicken Thai soup is really yum. Chilli garlic Peper chicken and golden fried fish tastes like heaven. Moreover it's my favourite place and the price of food is also not that expensive. ðŸ˜Š

Well I have been to so many Chinatown restobars and this visit was for the first time at this place. Liked it as   it is the usual place for any other chinatown. We ordered fish crispy which was really good but chicken stuff that we had ordered was kind of little hard and did not seem fresh. Otherwise a good place to drink eat and celebrate

I am writing this review sitting at the restaurant. Firstly the AC was not functioning.We were made to stand for 10 mins before the table which they took to clean the table. We were allotted the table which was not clean when there were other clean tables.The waiter asked us that should he server soup starter and main course together. Now you don't expect such a question from a Chinese restaurant. Food was okay, nothing exceptional. Bar menu was handwritten, prices doubled from normal rates found in restaurants.I don't recommend this place to anyone.Wont be coming back.

This place is much economic and the food quality is up to the mark as well. Four of us went there. We ordered hot n sour soup which was good with the right amount of spices. For starters we took green pepper chicken and prawn chips. The green pepper chicken was simply mind blowing.. The chicken strips were so soft that it would melt in your mouth. For main course the mixed fried rice and noodles were quite the usual. Standard. The side dishes Thai chicken was my personal favourite.. It was unsual yet tasty with a tangy sour flavour and spicy as well. Schezwan fish tasted really good as well. The quantity and the quality was astonishingly good with pocket friendly prices.

Apart from the big shots like Beijing, Golden Joy...there's Ming Garden which is more economic than others...location can be a lil tricky for 1st timers.
One fine day we had a group meet and we headed there for dinner, well to start with the place is spacious with minimal decor and fine ambience.
As we're a group of 7, we were seated accordingly in a large table.
Coming to food :
We placed, (STARTERS) :
â€¢ Chili garlic pepper prawn - the flavoursome garlicky tangy light batter coated prawns was perfect choice to start our dinner.
â€¢ Cambodian fish : spicy succulent pieces of basa fish dipped in tangy hot sauces which created a burst of flavours in my mouth
â€¢ Mongolian chicken : this was a unique preparation with the touch of hoisin sauce..with scallions n all it was totally savoury.
Off the starters we ordered main course,

MAIN COURSE :
â€¢ Dragon chicken : this was a spicy preparation with hell lot of pepper in it which didn't satiate my buds hence thumps down
â€¢ Mixed Meifoon : Meifoon was absolutely fine so was the portion.
â€¢ Mixed Fried Rice : although portions were ample but somewhere I felt they compromised in giving enough chicken in it...but enough prawns were there to make place for chicken.
â€¢ Hot Garlic Chicken : this tasted as it should be. So no complaints here.
â€¢ Mixed Hakka noodles : out of all staples I loved this one...thick noodles with enough veggies prawns chicken enough to win my heart.
For booze, we had quite a lot of Tuborg strong , and some vodkas as well.
After ordering so much of drinks n foods the check came out to be 4260 INR which was quite reasonable as compared to other restaurants in China town.
Service was fast, waiters were prompt.
HENCE, RECOMMENDED! ðŸŽ©

One of the better places at Tangra. Situated next to Golden Joy, the food here is mostly on the authentic side. They have a huge parking area as well as a big sitting space. Have dropped in here a couple of times many years back. Tried Mixed Noodles, Prawn Papad, Mixed Noodles, Crispy Chicken, Chilli Chicken and others. The quality is good and barring one or two items, the rest were true value for money.

Among the number of restaurants in China Town ming garden is one of the popular among people who mostly like to booze here.

**Location**
Located just beside the Golden joy.

**Experience**
The place is big and good parking space available inside too which is a plus of course. 
Though the place is not very clean. The simple table chairs doesn't give you any special feeling. 
Food is just about okay. I liked the Hakka noodles here and also the chicken dishes. But fish dishes needs improvement. Booze is cheap. Decent one.

Had been to this place on Christmas.. It was not so crowded...the waiters were very helpful and friendly. We were a group of 10 but they adjusted the tables so that we could all sit together...had ordered schzwan rice ,chiken fried rice and dragon chicken..(the others had ordered hot garlic chicken ..chicken hakka noodles. .mixed gravy noodles..though I did not taste all of it. The mixed gravy noodles was too bland. May be I have never developed a taste for non spicy food) .. It tasted superb. But I feel the quantity was a little less..but that doesn't reduce the quality and taste..the food took a time to prepare as the order list was huge,but it was worth the wait....the green chilly chutney is a must try for all those who love spicy food...

We went to this place on Saptami and this restaurant was not that crowded. This is just beside Golden Joy restaurant. Parking space is available.
The decor is simple and nice. The dim lights are perfect too. We ordered tuborg, kingfisher strong and 60ml signature and had them with their prawn chips, crispy chicken and chili chicken. The starters tasted realy god specially the prawn chips. In the main course we ordered their mixed fried rice and mixed hakka noodles with manchurian chicken and szechuan chicken. The food was good too with appropriate quantity. Staffs were decent and polite. We had a great evening there.

Went there with high expectations as per the ratings and reviews on zomato but to my utter dismay I was highly dissapointed.

The place was quite crowded with only few staff and waiters.

We decided to have a booze. So we ordered Beer along with dry chilli chicken and chilli babycorn.

The beer was served chilled and the food hot.
Although the food was served hot it did not taste any good to me. It was very much below average. The chilli chicken was not at all chilli and babycorn was not at all crisp.

Coming to the price it was a expensive affair as compared to the food quality.
We also ordered for noodles which they could not serve us given ample time. So we decided to pay and leave.

A Disappointed outing.
Don't wish to go back.

Went here after reading the comments on Zomato and have to say I was disappointed. We reached the place at 9.30 pm and found the waiter sleeping on the seats, AC was not working when we complained they arranged for a stand fan. Food was just very average compared to other places in Tangra. Surprised to see that this place is rated so high in Zomato.

My friend gave his birthday party here. It's located just beside the golden joy. The place has got a huge dining area. The ground floor was closed so we went upstairs. The sitting arrangements are nice and comfortable. Large tables gives a large group space to sit together. The waiters were very cordial and friendly and very convincing too. 
The decor is modern with few traditional Chinese wall arts and lamps. The booze is cheap however we didn't drink (it was afternoon and had another party to attend in the evening ). 
The food took a bit long time to come. We ordered prawn chips, crispy chicken, mixed hakka noodles, fired rice, chilli chicken and kung pao chicken. 
All the dishes were tasty. And the quantity was huge. 1 full bowl of rice is enough for 2 adults and 1 kid. The noodles and the rice had ample amount of meat and veggies. The side dishes were also great. With solid big chunks of chicken. Overall it was a nice dining experience. Looking forward for my next visit.

So after winning the I-League last night,we decided to visit China Town to relish this memorable moment..However Golden Joy was far too crowded and so we decided to enter this place located just adjacent..Their large parking space is definitely a benifit..They have two sections:ground floor for stag and upper one for family..The decor is decent enough much like any other Tangra outlet,its spacious in the family section..seating is comfortable..The servers were way too slow and inexperienced in suggesting their signature dishes..The quantity is good no doubt,taste wise the food is decent enough resembling typical Indo-Chinese cuisine you taste in Tangra,however it seemed they lacked consistency in their dishes as some of the dishes were pretty mediocre..We ordered:
Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish: Honestly it was way too salty..also the spices didnt blend well as a whole..served 14 pieces in a full portion. 
Pepper Prawn: It was the best starter of the evening..10 tiger prawns in a full portion..the prawns were fresh,juicy,loved the flavours of spices in the dish..
Mongolian Chicken: It was good too..15-16 pieces in a full portion..spicy,loved the taste of fried onions,the dish has a unique smokiness..
Dry Chilli Shrimp: This actually taste quite decent..small shrimps fried alongwith chillies and onions..a perfect nibble..
Prawn Chips: It was as usual you find in any Tangra joints,quantity was good..
Schezwan Mixed Fried Rice: Loved the tanginess of this dish..it has a strange soury flavour which taste good..proteins were generous..
Mixed Hakka Noodles: Generous portions..tasted pretty ordinary though..
Hunan Fish: A brownish gravy,tasted a tad sweeter..overall it was well balanced..
Thai Chicken: Loved the taste of the sauce,spicy,slightly pungent,a bit sour..
Manchurian Fish: It was a dissappointment..the manchurian sauce should have been prepared with more expertise..way too sweet and bland..
Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.3500/-(incl tax) for 8 people..so I guess the place is pretty economical compared to more famed Tangra joints..

Been here couple of times. Very ordinary interiors. It's always empty. So we always had the TV remote! Accompanied a person who is very regular in this joint. Probably that's the reason service was excellent. Food is quite good. Recommendation: NO

Decent place in Chinatown. The place is nicely decorated and has ample parking space. The food is good, we had Hunan chicken and mixed fried rice,both were decent. Golden fried prawns were a disappointment..the crust was below par. Overall, a decent place with nice courteous attendants!

Well, came in here as their neighbors were full. But holy moly,the food here is really  good. Ordered the golden fried prawns for starters : no I am not crazy,or being paid,or blind or deaf, but the golden fried prawns were BETTER than golden joy. They were more crispy,lesser oil and less batter. Prawns had taste as well, unlike the broiler ones in golden joy. 
Also had the pan fried noodles in gravy, chili chicken, fried rice and Thai chicken. All were excellent and tangra style.Quantity was great as well. The ambience needs work,but if people start going here that should improve.
Will go back for sure.

Once you enter the lane leading to Ming Garden will find it overcrowded and people waiting for their turn to enter Golden Joy. Being impatient waiting for hours to get a table is not my way, went for the adjacent restaurant Ming Garden instead. Parking was ease inside the compound of the restaurant. Family seating arrangement is on first floor. Ambiance is decent.

In starters ordered Mongolian Chicken (half) and Chilli Garlic Pepper Prawn (half). The chicken was soft but the outer coating was thick and mildly burnt while prawn was succulent but the batter was hard, too much salt and dish was cold. Due to these actual taste was spoiled. On informing servers they were expressionless as if they were habituated of such feedback.

In main course selected Schezwan Mixed Fried Rice and Honey Chicken (half). Rice has huge quantity per portion and taste was decent. Honey Chicken was over sweet to my liking. 

Crowd was not upmarket like one will find in Beijing or Golden Joy. Bill for 2 came INR 1040 inclusive all.

On the eve of the Christmas me and my friends decided to have some drinks. We were looking  for place having parking facility and this place suited. It was just next to Golden Joy. We got place in the 1st floor. It was nice and tidy with a very thin crowd. We ordered some chicken and pork starters along with a bottle of VAT69. We also had a prawn dish in starters. In the main course we had mixed noodles. Food was good and the staff was quick to respond. Overall a nice place to hang around with friends. Cost wise its pocket friendly compared to the other restaurants in Tangra. Go and enjoy food and drinks.

Went there on my birthday 2years ago. That was my first tyme at china town n this little restro attracted our attention. Though it seems to b a very small place from outside its quite spacious on the inside. 
I liked the decoration of this place. There were cubicles for couples also. Soft music was playing in the background. The staffs were a bit lazy though.
Ordered pepper chicken as a starter with tuborg. The pricing of the drinks i must say was reasonable. For the main course had ordered mixed fried rice n garlic chicken. There were 2 of us. Quantity of food was more than sufficient. Nothing to complian about the taste. Overall a good experience.

My First visit here today. This restaurant doesn't look appealing on the first sight. Very clumsy. We were asked to have a seat. AC wasn't working at first we had to ask them three times, then they adjusted it.
We ordered for the starter two 60 ml Smirnoffs, one baccardi, crispy mushrooms, crispy chilli baby corn, masala peanuts, and two packets of salted peanuts.
Mushroom dish was fine but very simply done no authentic Chinese touch. Baby corn wasn't enough salted and on the sour side. Masala peanut was more of salad and very few peanuts. 
For the main course there was egg hakka noodles, hunan chicken, veg manchurian balls, mixed fried rice.
Only the chicken and rice made sense to me. Noodles were over cooked. Manchurian was very salty.
Bill came of 2041/-, wasn't satisfactory experience of a Chinese lunch.

Nice place to hangout with friends .. The place  was vacant when we entered and only 2 guest entered in the next 2 hours.. Maybe max crowd enters Golden Joy which is just beside it.. Coming to food... Ordered 
chilly pepper fish.. It was nice on taste .. But the fish did not taste of bhetki it was basa..
Mongolian chicken ... Chicken was nice and juicy but less spicy .. People who do not enjoy spice might like it.
Szechuan noodles gravy .. This was an item which is available as hakka but I requested for an  gravy preparation so the chef gave us that.. This indeed was the best of the lot with a new flavor and taste..
Service was nice and warm..  Rates are like any other rest in tangra ... Seeing the drinks menu can say that it is indeed cheap..So for people who like to booze this place is pretty good...

2 times I visited there.The first time I visited was with my bro & the second time with my two friends. From outside it looks very cheap & poor but as you enter you'll get the charm of it. You won't see too much of customers instead you are gonna see a lot of empty chairs & sofas & some of the waiters chatting. But the service is really good & satisfying. Especially the drinks are quite cheaper than the other restaurants. On our second visit we ordered a 650ml of Tuborg, a half plate of chill chicken, three 60ml of Old Monk & three 60ml of Imperial Blue. That's just cost us Rs.718 & its worth it.The best thing which I love here the most is that its cheaper yet you can get all the satisfying services you'd expect.

Just beside Golden Joy restaurant - this is a value for money, good food, nice service and very importantly a restaurant which is not crowded and with no waiting lines!!! I hate waiting for something that need to pay!!! ( like in Golden Joy during weekend evening hours). My opinion is that this place is yet to be discovered and tried by many before it gathers the "rush" like other joints.

I had gone there with my family and we had a jolly good time. 

I would go there again when I visit Tangra.

if  your  motto  is  to  DRINK  MORE   &    eat  less  , then  do  definitely  visit  ming  garden  , because their  bar menu is just too good .  VAT-69 here   would cost you rs  170/60 ml peg ,  100 pipers at rs 200 / 60 ml peg , teacher's @ rs 200 / 60 ml peg & black dog 8 years @ rs 205 / 60 ml peg . coming to food & ambiance .........  food QUALITY is good BUT QUANTITY is less , but that should not deter you because you gotto come here for the  DRINKS more than the food . AMBIANCE again if you are looking for fine dining , then you will be disappointed .  But you are looking for a quiet place to relax with   NO CROWD , then, MING garden , is the place .  I went over with a female  friend  of mine , & we had  1/2  chilly garlic pepper fish ( rs  230  ) 1/2 crispy prawn ( rs 260)  & 1/2 green pepper fish ( rs 220 ) for starters .  in the main course we had  1 prawn fried rice ( rs 120 ) &  1/2 chilly prawn ( rs 270 )  & Finished it all off without much trouble , so that says that the QUANTITY here is less , but i didn't mind too much as i had drinks to contend with . Overall a  great experience  from  my side . A NOTE OF CAUTION THOUGH .....................................  TRY TO VISIT THIS RESTAURANT  BETWEEN 12 NOON TO 4  PM , AFTERNOON , because after that it  gets  pretty empty the restaurant . A must VISIT for LUNCH  

4.5 from my side 

CHEERS

Ming Garden is really a nice restaurant at China Town. 6 of us went there and ordered items like Mongolian Chicken, Prawn Chips, Szechuan Rice Noodles, Szechuan Mixed Fried Rice, Ming Garden Special Chicken, Thai Chicken.. Both the quantity & quality of food were good enough and they r moderately priced only, The Rice Noodles, Ming Garden Special Chicken & Mongolian Chicken were just delicious. Services were prompt, waiters were well behaved, though they took a moderately long time to table d orders but dat was good for us as we chatted and had fun at dat span !! Last but not d least, d ambiance at Ming's Garden is superb. The dining place is spacious enough to make u comfortable and relaxed unlike many other congested and claustrophobic restaurants.

Very bad food quality. Service is also poor. The name is a misnomer - it is not a garden restaurant. I can not comment about the hard drinks as we did not take any. People may like that and then they tend to forget the taste of the food.

I visited Ming Garden yesterday with my boyfriend and had a lovely time at a Chinese restaurant after a very long time. 
I shall begin by talking about the food as that's most important!
We had Masala Peanuts, Honey Chicken (Dry), Mongolian Chicken, Crispy Babycorn & Button Mushroom, Chinese Chopsuey, Carlsberg and Kingfisher Strong.
The masala peanuts was a revelation! Fried peanuts tossed with fresh salad & dressing..AMAZING!
The honey chicken was a delicious, unique dish, but go for it if you don't mind your chicken sweet at times.
Mongolian chicken was spicy, nicely fried chicken dipped in Mongolian sauces. Hot!
The veg starter was a light dish of batter fried babycorn & button mushroom. Goes SUPERB with your chilled beer! 
Lastly, the chopsuey was bang on, though i wish they would serve the fried noodles and the gravy separately, instead of mixing them before hand. Nevertheless, was very tasty with lots of crunchy veggies thrown in.

I think the best part about this place is that they do not tax their booze!! So drink as much as you like :)
It is a spacious restaurant with almost classy interiors! Privacy guaranteed. Chill and enjoy your food & drinks without being hassled by noisy neighbours! Waiters are strangely few but they will not give you a chance to complain..

I'm definitely going there again for lots of ensured tasty food and chilled beer without punching a hole in my pocket!

this is a place if u want to celebrate your weekend with tasty chinese food and drinks.
.its location is not deep inside the china town,so u don't need a taxi or ur private car to reach the restaurant.its just a 2 min walk for the main road and
its a big restaurant with a separate place for family at 2nd floor. i went with my girlfriend few weeks back.
i didn't expect a huge building with a big gate,it was empty with only an old Chinese man sitting on a chair at the far end where 2 cars were parked.he told us to go "sidha upar" to get into the restaurant.
so we went upstairs to the second floor and there was no one at the staircase to reach the entrance to the family section.

the place was big,well decorated with good chairs and tables,but again it was empty with 5-6 waiters were sitting at a corner and 2 couples were having some beverage.
one of the waiter asked us to sit anywhere we like and we chose the sofa, the ac was chilled and the seat ws definitely comfortable.
 then we went thru the menu to order hot garlic chicken chow with honey chicken and also ordered 650ml of strong beer. the beer was not that chilled but it was ok as i didn't expect much. they took a long time to serve the food when almost my bottle was empty,
but the steaming chowmein and its quantity it self made us happy.they served the chowmein and it was just too much for 2 people. the half plate honey chicken was having big 8 dices and it was perfectly spiced. we ate these in ten to fifteen minutes with continuous rubbing my eyes and nose.
 but as our thirst were not quenched so we ordered another beer and now at the end ordered some starters.i asked for shredded chicken but they didn't understand instead they suggested to have have mongolian chicken and needless to say it is definitely one of the best starter i had in china town.

the total bill was 721 with vat applicable on food and a tax free beer. its affordable price,wonderful ambiance,friendly waiter and the emptiness makes it a wonderful food hub for couples in tangra.

ming garden is a nice eatery in tangra,very cheap compared to the much hyped bigboss,beijing etc, yet the food quality is the same,perhaps better in quantity!
it seems to be an under rated place,but worth our visits.its in the lane opposite to beijing,the family section located on the 1st floor is hugely spacious,decoration wise its better than the others like golden empire,china garden n rest of the cheaper lot of restaurants in tangra.
the waiters are polite,service is good.for lunch we ordered 
mongolian chicken in starters which had 8-10 cubes of chicken,fried with onion n capsicum n spiced up properly.
chili garlic chicken noodles and honey chicken.noodles was very spicy n we enjoyed it well with the gravy chicken side dish.
strong 650ml beer comes for 140 bucks,n we were glad to find no taxes on alcohol ! however vat on food bill is applicable.
if you want cheap booze with quality chineese food in a pleasant n decent ambience,this place should be a sure GO!!

Ming Garden is located just beside the very well known Golden Joy restaurant.I quite liked the ambiance and the service was also very prompt.I was quite surprised to find that it was not that crowded like other well known restaurants in China town.The food was excellent, one must try the Ming Garden special as starter, in main course we had Schezwan Fried Rice, along with Honey Chicken and Chicken with Mushroom and Baby corn.The rice simply tasted brilliant, the honey chicken was also too good and so was the Chicken with baby corn.I simply liked the overall experience, me and my wife looking forward to visit it again shortly.

A PLACE WORTH VISITING!

The Ming Garden Restaurant is not popular like Beijing or Golden Joy. It is never crowded. It is not even grand in terms of decor and ambience but it is worth visiting for its tasty and affordable food. The service is prompt and efficient. Begin your dining experience with their Thai soup. It is well made and can be compared to the kind that you get in restaurants specializing in Thai food. Alternately, you can order their Chicken Hot and Sour soup. It is mildly hot and contains in good quantity the usual ingredients like mushroom, fungus, tofu and other ingredients that go into the making of this soup. Even their Chicken Clear Soup is well prepared. The soup is extremely clear and the strong taste of the chicken broth indicates that it has been cooked for the right amount of time.

 After the delicious soup, you can have their Hot Garlic Chicken Chow. The flavor of garlic and chillies make this dish one of their most fiery. Even their Schezwan Chicken Chow can cause a lot of heartburn. To stamp out the fire in your mouth have their Honey Chicken .Their Chilli Prawn is another brilliant dish. The prawns pieces are plenty and scrumptious. Sometimes this dish is very spicy because they add too much chillies but who is complaining if their prawn pieces are plentiful. They also have various juices and beverages on offer. Along with the meat dishes, sample their Vegetable dishes like Mushroom and Baby corn.  Equally tasty is their fiery and crispy Chilli Baby corn. They also specialize in certain crab dishes. Even though I am a big fan of crabs I haven't had the opportunity to have that even at the restaurant. Will try the items the next time I am here...

I recently visited Ming's Garden resturant on 1st September alongwith family. 
What struck me first is that the crowd in the resturant just beside is so much, whereas this resturant was not crowded at all. 
But still we went inside - to see what the restaurant was like from the inside. The ambiance is OK -just like any other restaurant in China Town. There was ample space to find a cozy corner for ourselves. The waiters are just a bit lethargic or they provided more than enough time to get us settled. 
We ordered Golden Fried Prawns, Pepper Chicken for starters along with some drinks. The food was delivered fast, which I liked and to be true, I found the starters quite good. 
For mains we ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Cantonese Noodles, Szechuan Fish and Chili Garlic Chicken. No complains here too. One very unique thing about this restaurant is that they don't offer any pork dishes; which means there is less hassle to take family members.
After completing the meal, I really began to wonder why this restaurant was empty on a Saturday night, whereas other, that are as good have queues of people waiting to be seated. 
Word of mouth majorly acts in the favour (or against) any restaurant and this place hasn't been able to tab it to it's full potential. 
My overall experience is good - but perhaps not excellent.
