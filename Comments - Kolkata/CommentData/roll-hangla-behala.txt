one of the most amazing rolls I had in kolkata.They tried to create a new varity in all roll swhich i like the most.The egg bhujiya chicken roll and the cheezy chicken roll are a must try. It is also very hygenic..

had 2 chicken roll & 1 egg chicken roll was average! i also found a bone in the roll :/ if you are having something between the two i would suggest you to try the egg chicken roll

PS the packaging was awesome! .5 for that!

I had the chicken roll here and I was extremely satisfied. It had something new to it. Quite pocket friendly I must add. Looking forward to trying out the other items too.
