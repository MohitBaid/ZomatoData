I generally go there almost once in a week.
It takes 10 mins to go there from my home. It's featured in south Indian food.

I generally love their cold coffee.

I love this place as my favourite 'tiffins' are saved always by them.

Its a little eatery at Gorabazar. Has a collection of South Indian foods, chaats and lassis. There was not much space for sitting but the food was good enough. The lassi was very thick but tasted good. The price is not much.

Small restaurant, specialised in south Indian food. Food is very good, price reasonable, average ambiance but it is air-conditioned. Good enough for this kind of food joint. Quality food and behaviour is also very cordial.

It's one our favourite places for a quick bite. Hardly 10 minutes from my house, this is one the most popular shops in dumdum. They serve plenty of South Indian dishes. My personal favourite is the paper dosa, it's most crispy and tasty dosa I have ever had in Kolkata. Otherwise dahi bada, papri chat, pao bhaji, milkshake and lassi also needed to mention.

Tiffin room.. It doesn't actually serve tiffin.. One can easily have their dinner from this place. A small, hole in the wall type eatery with an array of South Indian, marathi and North Indian delicacies and some tasty shakes.My food journey is associated with this place since very beginning.
Location:- just situated at my 'pasher para', it is a 5 minutes walk from Goalpark. Situated at Mahendra colony, near gorabazar hanuman mandir.. It is pretty close to Central jail too.. Well, don't get baffled, if one is coming via R. N. GUHA ROAD, Then get down at hanuman mandir and if coming via Jessore Road, then get down at central jail.
Ambiance:- This is a very small place and a bit cramped up. It can accommodate around 15-16 people at a go. It has AC which makes ur food journey comfortable though. They have open kitchen so you can see how it is being prepared. The place is quite clean.
Service:-Service is pretty fast when it comes to dosas. But you have to wait a bit for chaats a bit. But they are quite efficient in handling rush and polite too. In weekends, if you visit after 7 pm for dine-in,then you have to keep your calm coz its really crowded at that time. (As per my experience). But the wait is worthy..
Cuisine/Food:- It is a pure veg eating joint.They started with dosa, uttapam,vadas, chaats and different shakes, but now they have added some marathi delicacy like pav bhaji, vada pav etc. My favourite fillers from their list:-
1)Special masala dosa
2)cheese masala/plain dosa
3)Dahi papdi chaat
4)Special Dahi papdi chaat
5)Dahi fuchka chaat
4)Strawberry milk shake with ice-cream
5)Pav bhaji-it is a bit spicier version.
My recommendation:- Their dosas and chaats. Pocket pinch:-150-200 max for two. No added tax. They charge 2/- for packing. No washroom, only a wash basin. I mainly prefer take-away.
Do give it a try.

I visit Tiffin Room often and they serve some of the best dosas and idlis,  if one would discount Anand and Komal Vilas. The prices are on the lower side and the service is always prompt. The chutneys are sometimes a let down, though I would put that down to different chefs than poor ingredients. They serve a good cold coffee too. The only drawback are the cramped seating arrangements and their cash only policy - for which I have docked off a point.

I have been keeping with touch here since the beginnings. This is the best south Indian cafe that I ever have. Though the seating capacity is a bit low, else everything you should give a big thumb. Try the Dahi Chat if you are a chat lover. please be patient at the door of this cafe. You may have to make a queue on rush days but the food never disappoint you.

I hv visited this place a number of times. Its a small eatery serving mostly south indian dishes. Their dosas r good. Dahi Papdi chaat is worth trying nd Paw bhji is tasty. The staffs r humble . I could hav rated it 5 ., bt a point less since i dun find the masala in the dosas at all tasty.

Tiffin room..a south Indian small joint.. I visit this place more than 50 time .....that becoz its nearer to me..let's take a quick view of ambience..very small..not to comfortable sitting..staff are well behaved.. Food quality good..but sambar and coconut chutney r really bad taste..but one more thing..dhosa variety r limited.. Overall good for this place where there are only one good south Indian restaurant.

Close to my home this is the only joint serving south indian food,the place is small with 5 or 6 tables but if you wait you get a table.I visited this place many times and the food is quite good.My favourite is the vada pav and dahi fuchka.This place does provide a break from the fast food centers and hence is quite popular.

This joint is 2 minutes away from where I stay and we regularly have food from here,be it breakfast on Sundays or snacks when we are hungry in the evenings! I have tried everything they have here,from dosas to chaat to shakes. It's a small cramped up place with a nice staff and moderately good dishes. The dosas are amazing but they go all moody when it comes to preparing chutney and sambhar,sometimes it's good and sometimes it's bad as hell.


 Atleast we have something for a change in the area apart from the usual kachori-sabji stuff. *phew*

It's pure vegetarian South Indian restaurant and if you are happening to be in locality then it's a place for quick filler. The food quality is ok and the stuff behavior is not that you'll complain. Seating capacity is limited to 10-12 people only. Moderately priced. I'll say it's value for money.

The best that could happen to a food lover is to find a comfort food restaurant near home... This this place is food wise heaven for me.... Very much affordable ... And always busy ( a green signal for good food) I always have takeaway from here... And they don't make you wait much.. Very fast service .... A very small area to sit n eat but cozy... I love the dosas , dahi vada, dahi papri chaat, vada pao from the menu... Uttapam and pav bhaji are not upto my taste... I love this little place

A small but decent south indian outlet just behind Gorabazar, Dum Dum. The food over here is simply awesome but what attracts me over here is the ambience, cleanliness and politeness of the house staffs. I have tried a variety of items from this outlet and never had been dissatisfied with the quality or the quantity. Dahi Vada is my favorite, like the chutneys served with Dosa and the cold coffee. 
I make sure to grab a quick bite whenever I am in my in-laws place which is not far away from this place.

A small south indian joint in gorabazar,this place isn't far from my home. I don't really like south indian dishes so whenever i visit this place i mostly opt for chats like their dahi papdi chat(1 of my favourites from this place) and cold coffee. With such affordable and low price of items,they even managed to put an air conditioner for making their customers comfortable during summer days. I love tiffin room and surely love to visit again and again!

A small South Indian food jint located in Central Jail Area..
The place is like any snacks corner but does serve really good n tasty food..
Dahi Papri Chat is my regular there but i do enjoy other items on the menu like Masala Dosa,Doibora n etc...
The price is also reasonable considering the fact that u can enjoy your food is such clean environment along with AC..
They dont add up extra taxes
Its a small ordinary joint mainly for south indian food and does that job perfectly ....
