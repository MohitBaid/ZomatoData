Afghani Chicken with Romali Roti was great. Afghani chicken was very nicely cooked and very tasty. Also had Tandoor Chicken, it is Ok, could have been better if softness of Chicken experienced. Request to add some speciality dishes in main course section.

Reasonable price but chicken item is too much oily, dahi chicken is not good in quality. Packaging was in aluminium foil,  good for keeping food warm.

It was late in the night and I was scrolling through zomato for ordering dinner when I came through this restaurant. I must say the quality of rumali ruti they serve is perhaps the best I habe tatsed in a very long time. The chicken wings were juicy and dahi chicken had an amazing gravy.

I honestly did not understand why there were so many poor reviews about this place. I have tried many joints in Kolkata but i can responsibly say that this place serves one of the best chicken preparations with the most original taste compared to the price. We tried the following:

Grilled chicken
Chicken Afgani cream
Dahi chicken
Chicken changezi¬†
and Chilly chicken¬†

Each preparation was just too good...i repeat just too good. Each had its own unique taste and being an ardent mutton lover, i dont remember the last time i was so satisfied after having just chicken preparations. Pocket pinch was just Rs. 514 including all taxes as i customised the size of the order for the two of us. Delivery time was 1.5 hrs but considering they delivered to salt lake from park circus, i feel the delivery time was satisfactory. I would have given a full 5, but 0.5 less only because there was not a single leg piece ( my favourite ) in so many chicken dishes....though i know it is simply my personal choice. Good job the entire Jugaad Bangla team. I keep hosting small parties at my place and you can expect big orders from me in the near future as well. But do make sure you maintain the same standard and quality of your food...because the problem with many such promising joints in the past has been their consistency. As a true bengali foodie, I honestly hope you guys will be an exception to this.

Love the place. Total value for Money!
In love with the Biriyani. Only downfall is that the Quantity and the size of the chicken reduces day by day. Hope it doesn't happen like all other restaurant's, as soon as they pick up they start to forget about the quantity served. 

P.s - Rated 4.5 only because it takes an hour and a half to deliver!

The food is really nice. I ordered the Dahi Chicken which was extremely similar to the chicken from Shaina Chicken Corner. The roomali rotis were nice and fluffy. The delivery was extremely prompt and quick, and the delivery man was super nice.

the only reason its not a perfect 5 is because I felt that there is no reason a little more quantity can be given because there are other shops that serve bigger quantities of the same dish at lesser prices. You guys could keep your prices the same or just increase it by a small amount just make sure the quantity will be enoughüòä

Pros:
# delivery was on time
# both chicken dishes were good enough 

Cons:
# the quantity of chowemin  was  less even for a single person 


**cost should be decreased a little**
