This is located in the by-lane just oppsite to the lake mall.We just dropped there as I have an tremendous affinity for plain dosa.Unfortunately,disappointed.The dosa was fried with less oil and that was good.Samber was not upto the mark.White chutney was tasteless a bit but the onion chutney was yum.
The interior is okay.
But the staffs are not attentive and welcoming at all.

Dropped in for a late Sunday lunch at "Prema Vilas". This age old South Indian eating joint dates back to the early seventies when my mom used to frequent this place during her high school and college days. The restaurant is easy to locate with a huge sign board in the lane bang opposite to Lake Mall. The interior resembles that of a basic Udipi restaurant with wooden tables and benches neatly arranged.

The thali junkie in me decided to skip the idli dosas and the uttappams for the day and jump straight on to a meal. My table was tidied up and the thali reached my table within a few minutes of placing the order. Typically, as always, the meal was served in a circular steel plate with elevated sides, a banana leaf of the same shape and size covering the entire area of the plate. There was pickle, 2 veggie dishes, sambar, rasam, buttermilk and halwa served in smaller bowls. Two papadams, three puris placed in the centre of the plate and plain boiled rice came in a separate steel container. This is the Regular thali priced at 140 INR.

‚èπPickle - This, I assume looked like a mixed vegetable pickle as I didn't get the chance to dig into it.
‚èπMixed Vegetable Kurma - This Kerala style vegetable kurma, a delicious stew of assorted veggies simmered in a ground coconut based gravy paired well with puris.
‚èπBottle-Gourd curry - This Bottle gourd curry was mildly spicy yet very flavorful emanating a nice aroma of curry leaves.
‚èπSambar - The sambar was very light and pleasing. I would rate this a close second to that of Banana Leaf's.üò∫
‚èπRasam - This is the usual tamarind laced very tangy rasam. Rasam and rice is something I always relish especially during summers months.üò∫
‚èπPuri (fried bread) - The puris made out whole wheat flour were soft, fluffy and less oily than expected. Gulped them down along with the veg kurma and curry!üò∏
‚èπBoiled Rice - Steamed rice was separately served in a steel plate. The sambar and rasam helped me clean the entire plate in no time!üò∏
‚èπPappadam - Three South-Indian papadams.
‚èπButtermilk - Buttermilk is considered an integral part of any Kerala thali and not only a palate cleanser but also aids in digestion. This spicy buttermilk with chopped green chillies, coriander leaves and curry leaves was perfecto!üòª
‚èπRava kesari - This semolina halwa was an absolute delight to end my meal with. Initially I decided to have only a spoonful because usually I'm not too fond of kesari halwas but instead, ended up finishing the entire bowl!üò∏ Infused with cashew nuts, a subtle aroma of saffron along with mild sweetness, it was yummm!üòªüòª

By the time I finished the meal and not a morsel left on the plateüò∏(On a serious note I hate wastage of food), I could hardly move but couldn't resist a filter coffee without which my South-Indian thali affair deemed incomplete. The filter coffee served in a stainless steel dabarah and tumbler was hot, frothy and robust!üò∫

The service was quick. The staff, however, gave off a laid back attitude and did not seem so knowledgeable about the food items. But, overall a decent place to indulge into some delicious and pocket friendly South-Indian comfort food!!!üò∫üòª

*** Next on my wish list is the never-before-heard-of "Dancing Coffee" that sadly was not available at the time of my visit.

Located just opposite to the lake mall inside the lane, is Prema Vilas.The restaurant is situated at the ground floor and is air conditioned.The d√©cor and layout is quintessentially south Indian meal hotel or coffee shop like.
Now coming to the food,it has almost all the south Indian delicacies in its menu.I have an affinity for Rawa Masala dosa, something that is not readily available at every nook and corner in Kolkata.
Now Rawa dosa is prepared with primerily Suji and is crackling to taste.The kind that most of us for whomever‚Äã dosa is not a staple, like. The masala was  mouth watering .Now the accompanying sambar had stewed vegetables and was mild to the palate, and the roasted Chana Dal chatni was fresh and had a dropping consistency.The temparing was rightly done.To tell the truth, the chana Dal chatni is something to savour.It is so authentic to the Southern style.
Also had ordered and savoured a Onion Rawa dosa.The uniqueness of it was that the burista was mixed in the batter and cooked with the dosa.Another cracker of a dish.Over all a very happy stomach pujan experience.
GST is charged at 18% over the menu rates.

This joint is located in the by-lane just opposite to Lake Mall, it is quite old south indian joints. They have very simple arrangement but, very tidy and clean.¬†
When we got in, our appetite was high, So we had Puttu Kadala, butter masala dhosa, one plate of Vada, one special chutney and two filter coffee. Actually , in Kolkata, we rarely find Puttu, so instead of having Idli, we opted for puttu as it was weekend. Actually we both were quite satisfied with quality and quantity and the Sambar was very good here. The entire experience was really satisfying and, it ended up with a piping hot south Indian filter coffee. We can't have a better ending, and it is quite a pocket friendly joint with cordial staffs.

To quench the cravings for south Indian dishes, it is the apt place to step in.Situated opposite to lake mall.we had ordered cheese onion rava masala dosa and mysore masala dosa.Cheese onion rava dosa was yummylicious.Mysore dosa was different in taste.Ordered filtered coffee and soda sikhanji as part of drinks. Coffee was just wow.
Service was very fast.
The staffs are also very helpful.

We preferred not to eat here due to the exceedingly non-cooperating attitude from the reception. It was a simple request to allow us to use their charging point. There were about of 5 charging points (most likely to be meant for customer convinience) left unused..... the harsh behaviour was mainly because they refused to take any responsibility. Honestly, we were not even asking them to do so. We would have very well taken care of our own phone. We then walked into Banana Leaf which is located nearby. Bad experience!

An old South Indian eating house in South Calcutta,doesn't require any review as they are very popular. This is one of those old Calcutta eating houses which has been maintaining their standard since the beginning and will surely not upset you. Visited this place maybe 10years back...and once again while I dropped in with my family,those memories were rejuvenated.A very neat and tidy one.

Coming to the food we ordered a plate of Upma , A Masala Dosa and a Plain Dosa . Everything was just perfect the size of the Dosa was huge enough and two people(not big foodies) can share !! Upma was too good.

A big cry to all the South Indian food lovers out there...if you haven't tried yet go on and have a blast üòä‚úå üç¥üòâ

Quite an old south Indian restaurant. I recently visited this place with my mother. You will find old fashioned tables & chairs here but still clean & tidy. We ate Masala Dhosas which were of good size compared to the price. Although I found its warmth has diminished more than it should when it was placed on the the table before us. Nonetheless we enjoyed it. Good place if you want a quick south Indian snack (or  even a meal).

I first heard about this South Indian eatery from my aunt, and we agreed to visit here for lunch. It is located on a lane off Rashbehari Avenue, and hence away from the spotlight. The interiors were not as inviting as the nearby Komala Vilas; nonetheless, we were ready to overlook that aspect provided the food was up to the mark. But to our disappointment, even that was not to be: the Onion Uttapam that we ordered was plain....I‚Äôve had tastier Uttapams from road-side South-Indian snack-bars! Only the Filter Coffee was the saving grace. If this restaurant doesn‚Äôt pull up its socks and offer a better deal in terms of food and ambience compared to its nearby competitor (which in any case enjoys the advantage of being situated on the main-road), I‚Äôm sorry to say that the road in future can only go downhill.

I realize that this restaurant tucked inside a by-lane opposite to Lake Mall has been one of the oldest South Indian joint in kolkata. I have been visiting since I was a kid. Whenever we are near lake mall around the lunch time we visit for a quick bite. Family dosa, Dhania Dosa, Rasam idli , Utthapam are all real tasty. It's a basic but a reliable joint. Has undergone a lot of change over the decades. Old timers would remember that they had 1st floor also which has been shut down. Now it's only on the ground floor. Competition perhaps have eaten their share of pie, Idli in their case!! Good luck. Btw, the wash room though renovated is stinky.

Man I love this place! I wish only that would suffice, but I'm going to elaborate on that.
This place has been there for a while now and it's always been great. They serve beautiful, hot, south Indian food. 
The place is simple like how a south Indian food joint is supposed to be. You just need to go there and grab a meal which is thoroughly satisfying and simple.
This is my go-to place for great south Indian food. And I guess it always will be.

However, the menu or absolutely anything with regards to Prema Vilas has not been upgraded and given the pace at which good food is available all around, with service being a priority now. Both, being constant and something that could have been defined as good fifteen years back.

Starting with the location, it is situated in the lane opposite Lake Mall, Rashbehari. It's a renovated version of the old one, which was shut down years ago for some reason. This joint was introduced to me by my parents. I was surprised to know my mom n dad actually‚Äã ate here before and even after they got Married. 
They nail in service, food,  and quantity. It's not much of a fancy place though if you're looking to take pictures and stuff. Coming to the food they serve authentic south indian delicacies, dosas idlis, appam, upma et cetera. Beverages includes filter coffee and a speciality named the Dancing Coffee. The rawa dosas are extremely flavourful. So is the cheese dosa and butter dosa. Vadas, Idlis everything served to you here is fresh n nicely done. It's a satisfaction to get what you expect. 
So far, it's my favourite place for savouring south indian food. N I guess it shall be a favourite. :)

I have been visiting this place for almost over 10 years. It has lost its charm. The staff is no longer the same friendly lot I used to meet earlier, they no longer pay heed to the customers need. The food too has grossly lost its quality so has the ambience. Earlier it used to be much of a family hangout with a mild atmosphere to gossip in. These days its more of a canteen thing with people literally shouting at the top of their voices and occupying empty seats in an already occupied table.
Sad to state that this used to be one of my most favorite restaurants but not any longer.

The menu has a wide variety of Dosas and Uttapams.Hence,we settled for Cheese Mix Uttapam,Plain Butter Dosa and Butter Masala Dosa.The Dosas were good overall.However,I wasn't happy with the Uttapam as it was not even in terms of thickness.Also,instead of actual Cheese it was slathered with Cheese Spread.

They also serve meals which I would like to try in the future.

We ordered a cheese onion masala dosa..it was flavoursome..molten cheese mixed with onions lifted the taste..the sambar was above average so was the coconut chutney..however the other chutney was not at all good..
The dahi vada was very average...mixed with masala..i did taste better ones at lower prices..
The puttu kadala(their speciality) backfired on us..
Well..the chana masala was too salty to numb my taste buds..while the coconut wrapped bundle of ground rice appeared tasteless to me..

I MUST SAY I MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE. It was a busy time with a whole lot of crowd, still service was on time.¬† I have tasted rava dosa for the first time, and thanks to this restaurant I am not at all disappointed, infact I like to have them again.

Tried their Idli, which were very soft and nice. I loved their dosas too, yummy and soft inside with crispy outside. Sambar , chutney served with these items were also well cooked and nice.

Tried their Idli, which were very soft and nice. I loved their dosas too, yummy and soft inside with crispy outside. Sambar , chutney served with these items were also well cooked and nice.

A heaven for South Indian food lovers .

Heard a lot of stories about this place from my dad so  this place was always in my wish list and everyone says that at one point of time it was more famous then banana leaf but due to lack of management they shut shop in between but they have reopened few years back 
Ambience is not that great its still the age old seating arrangements 
Food was very good and the star was idli which was soft 
A good place to be if you want to eat south- indian food without spending much

A good place for authentic south Indian food. I have been here for quite a few times. I just love their Dahi vada which is refreshing in a hot summer noon. Tried many types of dosas, which were crispy and yummy. Sambar vada was also good. Idlis were soft and are better than other areas. Once tried Pongal , which is a rice item, was okayish. Their filter coffee was also good . Sambar, chutneys were good too.
Ambience was OK and price is reasonable.

Disappointed . Extremely disappointed. After all those rave reviews ,thanks to Zomato , thought of visiting this place .Today was the day .Went with my maa .We ordered two plates of sada vada .The disappointment that followed will never ever make me visit that place ever again . The vadas were burnt probably double fried and tasted bitter .They were probably the worst vadas I have ever had in my life .

LONG LIVE MY BANANA LEAF !!!

One of the oldest places for having South Indian food. Quite standard fare, fairly prompt service and once upon a time frequented by a lot of our modern day celebrities in Kolkata. This was a favourite haunt of the youngsters of Kolkata in the years gone by. Haven't been there in a while, but really miss this place. Pricing is also very reasonable. It is a must visit for foodies.

Had the masala dosa today...the preparation was completely splendid...the crispy crust of the dosa was neither too hard neither very soft...the perfect crispy taste u can get from the crust was right there...the preparation of aloo  present inside the dosa was mouthwatering..the lumps were carefully smashed with onion carrot almond in it...the sambar, coconut paste was nothing less than bliss...was really amazed such authentic south Indian dishes are still served nowadays...will visit soon
Masala dosa- 4/5

Food is great.  We started with vada, cheese paper masala dosa, cheese rava masala dosa cheese Sara dosa and Chile bhature.

The food was tasty and filling

Followed it up with onion paper dosa uttappam and coffee

The disappointing item was coffee.. No flavor.. Only suger

And the sad part was the service

Prema Vilas is one of those places where I enjoy South Indian food. This is one of the oldest places in the area. My mother got me introduced here long ago. Since then I have come here for a number of times.
The puttoo is beautiful. So is the upma. I also love the rasam vada from here. The idlis are soft and the chutney taste really good. Definitely recommended. Do give this place a try. Happy Dining! :)

For me a perfect breakfast is dosa with hit filter coffee. Got to know of this place long back but finally could make a visit to this place last Saturday. Very simple, clean and tidy ambiance located in one of the lane  opposite to lake mall. Ordered simple masala dosa, masala idly and filter coffee. Batter for dosa and idly was reply fresh making it delicious apart and filter coffee too was very authentic.

One of the oldest restaurants in the area, Prem Vilas serves authentic south Indian food. The place gives you a feeling of the south indian office canteens. They serve the food in shiny steel utensils. The paper dosa is a must try and also the sambar vada. To add a full south indian touch to your meal, have filter coffee. They have recently incorporated chhole bature in their menu. The restaurant has also been renovated and made fully air conditioned. The price is moderate and this place is a must try.

I spent 10 yrs in Bangalore, and was very much in acceptance of the South Indian food. The South Indian food that is being served in Kolkata is not and never at par with the¬† South Indian tastes and flavors, thats why I dont like to taste any dosa / idlis in the outlets of Kolkata. I changed my mind from Navami of 2016, when I went there with my friends to have my Lunch. Tastewise:¬† its absolutely at par to the South India
Flavourwise:¬† its absolutely at par to the South India, Ambience wise ; its absolutely at par to the South India
Pricewise:¬† its absolutely at par to the South India.. We have tried various types of Dosas, Idlis, pongal, uttapam, coffee. Even the Coffee gives me the exact taste , that I used to have in Bangalore. The Rasam, Sambar, Chatney is also the same. I had a feeling that I am sitting in a restaurant in Bangalore.¬† 
Thank you Prema Villa for taking me back to those days in Bangalore.

I have been eating food here for the last 30 years. Very conveniently located opposite to the Lake Mall ( Lake Market) and can be easily reached. 

The food is good with traditional South Indian flavour . I have learnt eating Dosai, Vada, idli from this place . Mostly preferred is the freshly prepared coffee given in the traditional utensils. 

The ambience is ok and the cost of the food is not that high . Good place for family.

A quick visit to Prema Villas before our movie at Priya left us totally mesmerized with the taste and flavor of authentic south indian food the restaurant serves. It was my girlfriend's suggestion actually. Before this day, I hadn't even heard of this place, and when I took the first bite, i realized what i had been missing out. Now let's talk about the food. I ordered the Paper onion masala dosa with lassi, while she ordered cheese masala dosa with filter coffee. The paper dosa was crispy, with a tasty alu and onion masala in the core, which literally made my day. The lassi was quite delicious and a perfect partner with the dosa. Her cheese dosa did justice to the name - it was cheesy, and the masala was simply awesome. The filter coffee was quite nice and refreshing as well. All in all, a wonderful culinary experience.

Was, initially, drawn to this place after I came to know of the "Dancing coffee". It is strong and very aesthetically appealing, and might make you keep going back for more (As a friend and I did). Do visit this place for that if nothing else. Big fan of their fried vadas that are served with rasam, as well! I'd recommend this place if you're big on tangy south Indian food, or are a connoisseur of (really) strong coffee.

Came here after years.. Was impressed with the clean and neat interiors. It is much bigger now too. Idli was not so soft but the chutneys and sambar were good to taste. Mogalpudi was an odd colour and tasted bad, actually no taste. Dancing coffee - the famous coffee available only here was not available so we had filter coffee.. Which was good too. But missed trying the Dancing Coffee after ages. Overall an ok experience as didn't have to wait for a table and dosas were good to eat.

Being a south Indian food lover I am eligible to judge their effort justifiably.
We order different types of rava dosa.
Ambiance is very simplistic: 2/5
Food quality: 3.5/5 The taste of the stuffing inside dosa is very much disheartening. Nothing different from road side dosa stalls.
Service: 4/5
Cost to quality: 3/5

Prema Vilas has been one of the age old South Indian eateries of the city. Being a South Indian and staying in Kolkata, there was no chance I could possibly miss out on visiting this place. Although the prices are slightly on the expensive side, the good food quality somehow compromises with the price factor. Uthappam, Sambhar Vada, Puri Masala are some of the popular things I have had here. I would suggest this for the South Indian food lovers, but don't expect a plethora of recipes as what you can possibly expect in a South Indian Chettinaad Cuisine restaurants, which mainly serves Non Vegetarian foods. This is a pure Vegetarian eatery and serves pretty good wholesome food.

One of the oldest restaurants in town, Prema Vilas presents to you the bare necessities of dining - a clean ambience and good food. The d√©cor is minimal, and the place gives you a typically canteen feel. The menu card has a wide range of good quality South Indian delicacies to offer. We went for dosas. They were huge, crisp and light brown - just the way it should be. And the chutney - needless to say, one of the best I've had till now. Moreover, I was informed that on Fridays and Saturdays they serve another special chutney with the dosa which, perhaps, first timers would not like to miss. The lassi too was fine.
Altogether, a decent experience. Will be coming back for more ;)

While reviewing a South Indian restaurant of the Lake Market area, I think it is essential to write a few words highlighting the historical relevance of the place. If you get back to earlier times, there was a period when the South Indians migrated to the then booming Calcutta(the old name of Kolkata), and preferred this area to house themselves. And centering that, an entire infrastructure and culture has developed in the Lake Market area to support their lifestyle, which has given birth to certain South Indian restaurants. And one such pioneer name is "Prema Vilas" which claims themself to be the soul of South India via its tagline.
Though the ambience is nothing great and looks more like a canteen, but this place is sure to delight you with its delectable South Indian delights. Even if you are not so fond of vegetarian food, you will love the taste of the food served here. The service staffs are polite and professional, and the service is prompt.
And the pocket pinch is absolutely reasonable.
A great place to have some quick and delicious lunch on the go at pocket friendly price.

This place reminds me of my childhood when I frequently used to visit it with my mother. Visited the place after almost a decade or more. Not much has changed except for that it is air conditioned now. Seats and ambiance all have remained the same. It is one of the best south indian restaurants in lake market area. I ordered only dahi vada for that day which was extremely satisfying on the hot and sultry summer afternoon. The soft and juicy vadas soaked in mildly spiced cold yogurt was the perfect lunch. Plan to visit there often now to refurbish old memories.

Had been to Prema Vilas few days back on a weekday evening.

We reached post 8 P.m. The restaurant was almost empty.

We chose our seats at a chilled place just next to entrance .

Had heard and read about their Dancing Coffee and was eager to try that but 8 p.m. was too late for coffee. Still I requested our server for it. After confirmation from kitchen, he took our order for it.

There arrived the Dancing Coffee with different layers of ingredients of a coffee. Coffee liquor at the bottom , Milk in the second layer and foam of coffee in the top layer.

Looked interesting but a sip left me confused about how to enjoy it. Asked the server, he laughed and walked away.

I mixed it and tried, at the end, it was good hard South Indian coffee.

We ordered Paper Masala Dosa, Butter Onion Rava Masala Dosa and Pongal in the main course.

Paper Masala Dosa was no surprise.

The Onion Rava Dosa was really good but the Masala served with Dosas had excess oil.


Pongal was Khichdi fried with lots of whole black pepper. Could had been better.

Ambience was like of a South Indian Tiffin House.

Service-  when 4 people on a Table order various Dishes , and they come one after another, you can give some extra spoons. We were given only 1 spoon extra after asking for it. Had to ask for Tissues, again came 2 of them. At the end , even Sounf had to be asked for. This was the condition when the Hotel was almost empty. Wonder, How do they serve when it's Full?

Pricing is pocket friendly. 

The overall experience could had been much better.

Food : Ordered Pongal , the traditional South Indian breakfast (I was there around 720 am ).
Pongal is basically a rice dish - it tasted pretty bland, however the sambar they served was just amazing,and made pongal delicious! 3.5/5

Coffee : Good strong coffee, nescafe it tasted though, but what I like is the amount of coffee used to make it strong 3.5/5

Service - Good 3.5/5

Overall - Will like to taste other dishes too ,till then 3.5/5

Probably I belong to a different mindset. The tables, chairs, the flat decor, cramped seating and the sound of steel utensils makes me sad.. I feel i am in a canteen of a confined unit. With the gloom in my mind, the tastebuds also fail to get enlighten. The white chutney lacks coconut. Sambar is too tangy. rest is all basic. Even the fellow visitors are all in a serious mood.. As if they are going through the chore of pushing down chunks down their throat.¬†
I am sorry to express my feeling in this review. And I do admit that i go to south indian restaurants only when some vegetarian friend insist. Overall this restaurant existed even before i was born. and I am sure hardcore lovers have derived value out of this place. But 2 other south indian joints within walking were very exciting.. You can read my reviews..

One of the better South Indian joints but nothing special. They have good meals on offer. The masala cheese Dosa is a jumbo on your plate. But cheese has a salty taste of ots own doesn't imply that the dosa will be overkilled with salt.
Its like the Dosa was saying "why ! Why did u ask for cheese... Now let me show you some cheese so that you never ask for one again"

Prema Vilas is a south Indian (Kerala, to be specific) specialty restaurant located just a few steps in the lane opposite the lake mall. 

I'm a big fan of the south Indian meal thali and that's all that I've ever tried here. The taste is very nice and is perfect comfort food.

However, considering the items on the platter and that an extra serving of rice is charged extra, I'd imagine a thali can be priced a little lower. A regular thali is priced at Rs 156/- all inclusive whereas an "unlimited" thali comes at Rs 180/- all inclusive. Their regular vegetarian lunch thali comprises puris, white steamed rice, sambhar, a dry curry, a gravy curry, rasam, curd, papad and a sweet dish.

Overall, a very decent joint for a decent, healthy and fulfilling lunch. 

Note: their lunch thalis sell very quickly, so ensure to be there within 1:30pm before they run out of the thali.

Been here today. Well nothing much to say about their decor, its nothing special but quite spacious. Coming to the food, we ordered one cheese masala dosa and one cheese sada dosa, both the dosas were awesome, i must say this is the best south indian food joint. We also took one cold coffee and one cold coffee with ice cream, both were very refreshing and the ice cream tasted really good, must try for all the south indian food lovers..

Very basic kind of a place not much decor. They score high on their food, the best south indian in the desapriya park area at their price. The food is absolutely spot on and their chutneys are heavenly. Food in this place makes you crave for south indian food.

Tucked away in a small lane opposite Lake Mall, this place is simply a beauty. Well this may not be luxurious but surely in its simplistic approach and long history it is elegant. Went in the evening a few days back and had ordered some plain Dosa, cold coffee and Dancing coffee. Yes! you read that right - "Dancing Coffee". Amazed by its name ¬†we decided to go for it and surely they didn't let us down. The coffee is a triple layered coffee made with South Indian Filter Coffee (probably because am guessing). It its huge quantity you may easily share between 3. The¬†

The service was prompt however you may need to call the servers a few more times than usual or probably it was a lazy evening. However the experience was Fantabulous!

Probably one of the oldest joints in Lake market serving the good ol' masala dosa. The ambience is simple and the staff is courteous and service is quick. If you are looking for authentic south Indian dishes at an affordable price - this is it! This joint has been my favorite for comfort food ever since I was a kid. Today we ordered - 2 masala dosa, puri masala and cold coffee. There was ample food for the 3 of us and the pocket pinch was a meagre 500! Coming back again and again!

The name "dancing coffee" really tempted me but i feel the usual coffee, tastes better than the dancing coffee ..
The food tastes acceptably fine yet the serving presentation could have been better ..
Compared to the food and the place that it is situated, they could have done much better with the interrior n utilise the space more creatively, to make the venue look more attractive ..

Have been visiting this place since I was a toddler... it's perhaps  one of the oldest south Indian food serving restaurant in south Calcutta. The ambiance is simple with old fashioned bench type chairs and marble top wooden tables... with prompt service and efficient service. Coming to the food... it tastes just like south Indian food. I like their idlis because of their softness and size, their onion and sada vadas are one of the crunchiest I have tried.

Been visiting for 24 years now. The original, humble, reasonable ..simply the best dosas they serve in South Kolkata. Feels like visiting family now, warm with childhood memories in tow!
Their specialty is the onion rava fried dosa, lip smacking vadas with that unique and perfectly customized Sambhar. With countless refillings and happy to serve waiters. The place is very roomy to allow you family conversations of any kind during the munching! And very often have I spotted celebrities seated at the next table. I find it better than Banana Leaf at Komala Villa, just the lane ahead.

It was the great Satyajit Ray who wrote in one of his detective novels that the Lake Market area,other than the visual perspective that it offered also had its own peculiar sound and smell.

This area housed the South Indians who migrated to booming Calcutta ( yes one time it was ) in sixties and early seventies and largely occupied the then middle class neighbourhood in and around Lake Market.To support their lifestyle,an entire infrastructure from spice stores,flower stalls,magazine stores and restaurants came up around here.

It had the wonderful break fast and lunch serving Ramakrishna Lunch home,another keralite lunch home ( now gone ) at Lake Market serving amazing fish curry and the Prema Vilas which was basically a place serving ' tiffin ' or afternoon and early evening snacks.

The masala dosa was always to kill for as it was today.Paper thin but crispy was the crust with the faint aroma of ghee,and the filler inside a perfect symphony of aloo,spices and curry patta.Superb.

Followed up with a vada which was no great shakes.

And then came the coffee,bursting with aroma and warmth and after the pouring ceremony a pleasure to imbibe.

The sambar,for me the yardstick between an good and great eatery was inconsistent.However it had the zing needed to complement the dishes.

And yes,I visited after a decade.Cant wait to come back again sooner.

You must admire a place that serves fresh and piping hot food even if it is an old place way past its glorious days and you are the only customer in an empty hall. And then if that's not enough, then there is the sweet sound of a crisp vada crackling with soft touch of the spoon and then melting in your mouth. Follow it up with a rava dosa (which i had to parcel midway through the meal since i am a light eater), with a molaga pudi extra ( I prefer it slightly hotter but). In terms of quality of food, it is a very satisfactory meal.

Finally, there's the dancing coffee, with three layers of coffee, milk and froth on top, separated in a jiggly motion till you stir and mix. It is not the strong south Indian filter coffee, but if you want a trip down childhood stirring froth, giving it shapes with spoon and having a froth moustache after drinking, go for it. Few things like these and bursting bubble wraps seldom go out of fashion.

Situated a lane down from its more successful rival Banana Leaf (and priced about 30 bucks cheaper for most items than Banana Leaf), it is a villa as the name suggests, and true to its name, there's no glass facade in restaurant style. I like it, because I like old buildings and because a villa is an unusual setting for an idli-dosa joint. That and the fact that it still has a few marble top tables, suit my old world charm aesthetics. If you like swanky shiny places, you might be slightly disappointed.

Oh, the disclaimer is that this is my maiden visit - so I can't vouch for its consistency, but i do pray to Lord Murugan to bestow those crackling vadas on me for lifetime.

When two generations go for shopping together, isn't it obvious that one generation would prefer something light and not rich at all? In most cases, yes. Ma and Boro Mashi preferred idli over a plethora of snack options.

This place seemed a little heaven compared to the cacophony of the busy streets of the famous shopping district. I remember coming to this place as a kid with my parents (when my taste buds were not much exposed to junk food and did not reject anything bland) to devour the delicious masala dosa served here. As soon as you enter, you'd find yourself amidst an exhibition of cleanliness. That is something I like.
Our order was simple - two servings of idli and a serving of coconut rice.

The idlis were soft and would melt in your mouth. The sambar has the perfect blend of spices - tangy to chilli. The coconut chutney is out of the world. Not very thick, but no compromise on flavours. I wish they served the red chutney too!
Coming to the coconut rice, I'm more than impressed by the dish. It's cooked in poha style with generous amounts of shredded coconut, dal, peanuts, curry leaves and a dash of mustard seeds. One needs to taste it to understand the flavours - no word would do justice to describe it. I also like the fact that it was not very oily - oil used was as per requirement. The sambar was the same. It came with an oil free papad, too.

We also got two plates of idli parcelled for the men who missed it - Baba and Boro Mesho. Confusion arose since the waiter packed the sambar and coconut chutney together while they were to go to two different places. Upon my request, the waiter was kind enough to offer us additional help and took the pain to re-pack it separately. Also, this is one of the few pocket friendly joints where I felt like using the hand wash and the sink. Kudos to their cleanliness!

A calm and quiet place, great healthy food, pocket friendly prices and good hospitality - enough to impress a famished soul. Will certainly revisit.

Mum told me about this being a small South Indian eatery and we went in to find a hot shot vegetarian restaurant. There's not much to say about the decor, but I liked the marble table tops.It's neat and clean, and that's about it.

To me Dosa means a Sada one, loaded with flavours in the Dosa itself and not the masala.. Mothers tend to think differently, more often than not.We ended up ordering a Cheese Rava Sada Dosa and a Butter Paper Masala Dosa. Zomato reviews lured me into ordering the Dancing Coffee. The Cheese Rava Dosa was delicious with a lot of cheese in it (much to my liking) and was light. The coconut chutney was quite tasty,with a proper balance. Given how anti-sambar I am, I almost finished my bowl of it. But the best of them was the Onion Chutney! *_* You could taste the caramelized onion and yet it just melted in my mouth! mmmhhh!! Paper Dosa was huge, and worth it's name! The Masala in the Dosa was average, nothing special about it. The Dancing Coffee danced it's way through in my palate. It was rich, milky, frothy rendition of South Indian Coffee.

The problem I had was that Mum went for a Masala Dosa and was given a Sada one. And then I understood the problem with staffs everyone has written about. All in all, It's a good experience.

Basically a good south indian restaurant. It was quite neat and clean with their old style marble top tables. The menu is very exhaustive....si many varieties of dosas,uttapams etc. The even have chola bhatura and pakoras. I had sada rava dosa and filter coffee. The rava dosa was excellent,but the accompanying sambar and chutney was not up to the mark. They only served one white chutney which was watery and the sambar too didn't taste that great.(sambar at 2 nearby joints are much better and Udipi serves 3 types of chutney). Even the service wasn't up to the mark. In mist places the waiter comes and gives you chutney and sambar when your bowl gets empty...here the waiter wasn't around...only two tables were full. But since I loved their rava dosa I will go back and try their other dosas. I hope they improve their chutney and sambar. The filter coffee served in the traditional steel glass and katori was excellent. I'd go back for that any day.

Apparently the oldest south indian restaurant in kolkata, a lot of history revolves around this place. Very minimalistic interiors and decor, affable staff and quick service. What this place is really famous for is the DANCING COFFEE. Yes you read it right, dancing! Well it is their house speciality ‚Äì they serve this particular style of coffee which comes in a glass where the froth, milk and black coffee are all separate by some means which I couldn't figure out. The fascinating part is the coffee, which is stirred in such a way by the maker that it is set in some sort of a continual motion, but onky for a while, not for long though. Hence the name dancing coffee.
Coming to the food, we had masala dosa which was nothing out of the ordinary, just how a dosa should be. 
Not someplace I'd go time and again unless ofcourse my fascination and nostalgia to see the dancing coffee pulls me back there. Cheers!

Located just opposite the lake mall near the basanti devi college. One of the best south indian places I have been to. We ordered one plate masala vada nd two onion paper butter masala dhosa. The vada was different from the conventional ones, and worth trying. The dhosa was quite good and moreover the price is reasonable. Especially the garlic chutney they provided apart from sambhar nd badam chutney was quite tasty and went well with the dhosa.

As I was craving for South Indian food for few days. Me and my friend visited Prema Vilas. Best part of the joint is it is absolutely clean and the atmosphere is quite and serene. Looking at the menu I was literally taken aback. So many ¬†variations for Dosas. None the less we ordered for Butter Cheese Dosas, Butter Idly, filter coffee and Lassi. I can only say about the food DELICIOUS!!!!! Eagerly waiting for my next visit..

A place which is still trying to maintain the authentic nature of South Indian Cuisine, on a Sunday evening, we were just wandering around and suddenly decided to go for some good old dosa - opted for Prema Villas and we ¬†were not at all disappointed - Ghee sada dosa had simple fragrance of ghee and was nice with the chutney accompaniments - What was excellent was the dhania butter masala onion dosa - with excellent dhania patta flavor which was spread on the dosa as a paste - generous potato-onion filling made it a sumptuous treat .... needless to say anything about the price, service is still good, though now they are T-shirt clad and though spartan, its very clean... good for an evening sojourn anytime

Its located in the lane right opposite Lake mall.   The food is good. The chhola batora is good and lite and tastes nice with the achchar served. Long and lite is what I can say about the rava masala dosa. It's really thin lite and really nice to eat. The chutney served along with has a good texture and a subtle taste. The sambar is good and served piping hot. The idlis are also really nice. It is served hot and feels great to have with the chutney and sambar. 
Ultimately if u like coffee u can try their dancing coffee. Well it does dance to certain extent. It's a 3 layered coffee, starting with raw coffee at the bottom, then a layer of milk coffee, topping it with a nice layer of froth. It's worth a try.

This is one of the oldest and one of the best South Indian outlets in Kolkata. The place has never failed to induce an old world charm, their newly revamped interior space complies with both modernity and an old world, laidback feel. Modern in the sense, that they've added a small, well furnished waiting space where people can relax and wait until seats vacate. Earlier long columns created problems but that problem has been taken care of to an extent. And also because now they have an air conditioned seating space along with long Imperialistic fans.

Their quality and quantity of food is both satisfying and pleasing to the taste buds. One remarkable thing about this place is that their quality and quantity has been very consistent. The reason why it is a favourite with the people of the city.

Their range of menu has increased. They have incorporated a few uttapams and dosas with cheese, which is quite good. They have also included a few North Indian dishes more preferably snacks like dahi vada, poori to their menu. Their beverages ranges from horlics to an interestingly named coffee called the dancing coffee. The chutneys and sambars accompanied with dosas and uttapams deserve a special mention. For they are really good. They serve the food in steel plates and glasses which adds an earthly and authentic feel to the food.

The only area which they must look to improve upon is a better ambience.

Being a pure vegetarian in Kolkata is a tough thing because every outlet serves you non veg. But if you want a pure vegetarian outlet then this is the place to visit. Serves you finger licking south indian food with hundreds of varieties in south indian ambience. Dish I recommend is onion rava masala Dosa. Must visit with family and friends.

If you are a fan of the South Indian Cuisine, this place has to be there in your list. Before the era of Banana Leaf or Idli Express, we had, what you can call a simple south Indian restaurant selling hot Idlis, Dosas and filter coffee. With time this very simple restaurant went for a makeover and voila! You still get to eat their amazing food but now in an Air Conditioned interior. Their prices have increased but the quality still remains the same. Fresh Idli served with steaming Sambar. Or if you are a fan of Dosas, you can have your fill with those crunchy, paper thin rolls. They still serve the filter coffee in the traditional two pieces glass set that includes a small tumbler. This place has been savoring our taste buds for the past one decade now and has never disappointed us.

A place which is still trying to maintain the authentic nature of South Indian Cuisine, on a Sunday evening, we were just wandering around and suddenly decided to go for some good old dosa - opted for Prema Villas and we ¬†were not at all disappointed - Ghee sada dosa had simple fragrance of ghee and was nice with the chutney accompaniments - What was excellent was the dhania butter masala onion dosa - with excellent dhania patta flavor which was spread on the dosa as a paste - generous potato-onion filling made it a sumptuous treat .... needless to say anything about the price, service is still good, though now they are T-shirt clad and though spartan, its very clean... good for an evening sojourn anytime

Its located in the lane right opposite Lake mall.   The food is good. The chhola batora is good and lite and tastes nice with the achchar served. Long and lite is what I can say about the rava masala dosa. It's really thin lite and really nice to eat. The chutney served along with has a good texture and a subtle taste. The sambar is good and served piping hot. The idlis are also really nice. It is served hot and feels great to have with the chutney and sambar. 
Ultimately if u like coffee u can try their dancing coffee. Well it does dance to certain extent. It's a 3 layered coffee, starting with raw coffee at the bottom, then a layer of milk coffee, topping it with a nice layer of froth. It's worth a try. 
It is a nice place to go and eat. The ac is chilling, and the food is great.

My relatives have known this place for quite sometime and they took me there first time.Next time I took my family to this restaurant because... 

The food is authentic and tasty.. 

The restaurant itself gives a very nice feeling, it has a seating space of around 50 ppl, nice "old world charm" sort of place, and it is still well kept and clean.

List of south indian servings is long. Coffee, Dosa Idly are authentic.. though Thali was a lil let down compared to other south indian restaurants.¬†

Only flipside I found that staff is not as courteous as I expect to be, especially in such quite, peaceful south indian restaurants.

I would rate 3.5/5 on taste with 4.5/5 on authenticity 2.5/5 for Service and Staff5/5 for Coffee¬†
Go there for a nice, peaceful quite dining/lunch experience.

Good food, affordable, decent staff. I am a masala rawa dhosa fan & everytime I visit here I order the same dish, so would not be able to comment on other items, my apologies :) . But looking at customer response & my personal rawa dhosa experience its a very nice place to eat. If u want to hang out then I will not recommend, this place, it is a strictly eat & go place, but by that I dnt mean they will throw u out as soon as you eat :-D , but yes you cannot hang out here like a coffee shop which is quiet understandable.

my dad and mom used to go to prema vilas for dates during their college days. But sadly, i am in the final year of college and i am still trying to find someone, with whom i can go on a date here. :p
okay cutting the rhetoric and coming to the point. prema vilas is an old south indian restaurant,where you get simple yet awesome dosas, idlis and uttapam. their chutney and sambar is delicious and it can make any south indian taste bud elate with nostalgia. so take a break from those oily fast foods and drop in to have some good south indian food. ;)

I have been visiting this place since my childhood and quite a lot o things has changed over the years. But this place still remains one of my favorite for having South Indian food. Their Sambhar and coconut chutney are simply the best I had so far compared to all the other South Indian restaurants I have been to in the city. Dosas and uttapams are very good and the price is also ok.

There are days when you crave for south Indian delicacies...well this place will surely fulfill that. The mouth watering dosas accompanied with fresh sambhar, chutney and also one reddish garlic chutney are simply to die for. The cheese paper masala dosa is one of my favorite. The size of course is too big for me. Also the rava masala dosa is awesome. The potato filling inside the masala dosa is finger licking. Just opposite to lake mall..once u r tired of shopping, just drop in here for some refueling. The vadas n dahi vadas are good too. A special mention of their filter coffee. A great way to start or end any hanging out with friends. I keep on revisiting this place for the quality they maintain.

Another Old South Indian Place which is located in Lake Market Area.The Ambience of that place is very simple.we went for a dinner on Sunday Evening the place is almost full,have to wait in the reception for 10mins.Finally we get a place for two.

Ordered Idli with sambar.Idli is very soft but the taste of sambar is not that good what we expected.Then we ordered Plain Paper Dosa and Cheese Masala Dosa.Their Dosa are huge and Crispy and the coconut chutney well made by them.We can't finish the full plate lastly we ordered for Butter Milk.

One thing I don't like we have to go and wash our hands they don't give bowl or something where other places they always provide it.Overall a good place to try for South Indian Food.

Because they are understaffed and they can't handle the rush on Sunday. The service is very poor. One waiter for around 6-7 tables. Not a bad place but the service is so poor that the overall experience is bad. I won't recommend this restaurant on a Sunday. It should be removed from South Indian delights.

The stuffings inside the cheese masala dhosa was quiet cold nd it was totally a turn off... Where as vada nd uttapam were quiet satisfactory.

Best Rava Dosa i had till date. The Cheese Rava Masala Dosa was too good and tasty and so was the accompanying sambar and chatni. Located in Lake Market, this is an old favourite among people who love light and South Indian food. Pricing is ok provided the quality and quantity of the food, the ambience is homely and so is the staff service.

Will try the other items and then might provide the final rating.

Definitely coming back !!

This but this place serves absolutely delectable dosas and idlis! Their paper dosas are huge and crispy and the coconut chutney is lovvvvely! The hand beaten coffee tastes just like they make at home down South and prices are pretty competitive as compared to some of it's contemporaries in the neighbourhood. Check out the place if you like to snack on south indian delicacies and are not too fussy about ambience.

Prema Vilas serves the best South Indian I've ever had in Kolkata. Visited there at 7 in the morning and I'd say I had a perfect breakfast that set my day. To begin with it, we ordered Upma which was mouth watering. Following that we ordered Butter Cheese Dhania Onion Masala Dosa, which was sumptuous. The Rava Dosa had the perfect amount of oil, not an ounce more which made it taste heavenly. 

The filtered coffee served was perhaps refreshing. Not to be found everywhere. 

Fortunately I landed there on a day they had some offer as per which prices were slashed to one-third from 7:00 to 11:00 in the morning. 

The place was tidy and waiters were congenial.  The service was slow though. Elsewise I would have rated it 5. 

Looking forward to visit the place again and again.

If soulful south indian is what you are looking for then look no further. The rava dosas they make may well be the best in town. The onion chutney again is very savoury and mouth watering. Idli's are super soft and the condiments served are true to the south indian flavours. Highly recommend!

If have some inclination towards south indian food you wood love Prema Vilas. This is one of thosr old south indian restaurants that draws real dedicated south indian food lovers. Simple yet neat and tidy ambience is something that can assure you that you dont have to compromise taste over hygiene. My mother is a bong lady whose is typically inclined towards south indian food she would obvious choose masala dosa over our very own mouth waterring luchi with kochi panthar jhol. Being typical non-vegeterian who would obvious say a big no to south indian food i was a bit hovering down my discomfort zone while providing mom company. Not being biast i was impressed. Coffee is something we can say we have loved for more than decades. if not provided with a topic to chat with grand pa generation their coffee house and our ccds actually makes the hanging bridge . I heard south indians make wonderful coffee ,finally witnessed .Sip of great coffee teamed with crisp yummy vada and a dash of mom's college days made a marvellous starter finally the Masal cheese dosa for me and Onion Dosa for mom and bit of sharing...made our day. Masala cheese dosa never tasted this yummy. Perfect coconut chatni and sambhar was delicious . The filling inside the dosa was actually what made it perfect. Even i was a nay nay for south indian cuisines . Give it a try out nay might turn on to yay next time !!

This is one of those eateries that i really really hate. I went there after a long day of exams to eat some good South Indian food. Heard the name of this place from my friends so gave it a try. I ordered masala dosa...i was sitting in one chair and could not help notice that a family was having a row with the restaurant waiters. Reason-they served Everything cold. My masala dosa came. The pancake was hot and crispy.. Loved that part.. But the masala inside was dead cold..even the sambhar was cold. I did not utter a single word. Ate that awful food as i was awfully hungry. Got out of the place and i promised myself to never visit this place ever again in my life.

I ordered coffee, vada and masala cheese dosa. 
Masala cheese dosa - I thought this one was really salty and the sambar that came along was very tasteless. 
Vada on the other hand was much better and so was the coffee. 
The bill was around 450 which was decent 
And so was the service

Prema Vilas is an old south indian eatery which has maintained its plain and simple ambience and draws a crowd of dedicated loyalists. I have often been here trying out their classic,  uncomplicated fare - Idli ,  Plain Dossa , Masala Dossa , Vada , Coffee and Salty Lassi. The eatery is strictly vegetarian and the fare is extremely austere.

This is a very old south indian eatery now eclipsed by its more renowned and polished cousin Banana Leaf nearby.Very simple in its ambiance and service nothing jazzy at all. Service wise its ok,but not bad. Costing is very basic aswl.We ordered for plain sada vada, cheese onion masala dosa , cheese paper dosa and filter coffee.Sada Vada:: The crump of the vada was well cooked and the lil tangy spicey taste added a nice flavour to the palate¬†Cheese onion masala dosa:: Though they provide with a good layering of cheese ,a bit more masala inside the dosa won't actually be a problem,yes considering the price tag its adequate but a lil bit of extra handful won't be a bad idea.Cheese paper dosa:: Very plain and simple in the making, the cheese layering is really adequately done.¬†Coffee:: The filter coffee was a let down, hardly bitter and a bit too much sugar, its a filter coffee which taste more like sugar coffee. When its coffee none want a bengali version of it I'm pretty sure, thus a bit more bitter and less sugar should have done the trick.

Also the salt quotient in the dosas were on the higher side which needs to be brought down along with that the sambar and coconut chutney needs to made more thicker,its too light thus at times the taste goes for a toss .
A nice joint which surely can do better....

Nice, simple, functional and delicious. Pongal was close to definition (Mysore version of Pongal though). Would love to come again during my next visit.

Prema Vilas is an old south indian eatery which has maintained its plain and simple ambience and draws a crowd of dedicated loyalists. I have often been here trying out their classic,  uncomplicated fare - Idli ,  Plain Dossa , Masala Dossa , Vada , Coffee and Salty Lassi. The eatery is strictly vegetarian and the fare is extremely austere.

This is a very old south indian eatery now eclipsed by its more renowned and polished cousin Banana Leaf nearby.Very simple in its ambiance and service nothing jazzy at all. Service wise its ok,but not bad. Costing is very basic aswl.We ordered for plain sada vada, cheese onion masala dosa , cheese paper dosa and filter coffee.Sada Vada:: The crump of the vada was well cooked and the lil tangy spicey taste added a nice flavour to the palate¬†Cheese onion masala dosa:: Though they provide with a good layering of cheese ,a bit more masala inside the dosa won't actually be a problem,yes considering the price tag its adequate but a lil bit of extra handful won't be a bad idea.Cheese paper dosa:: Very plain and simple in the making, the cheese layering is really adequately done.¬†Coffee:: The filter coffee was a let down, hardly bitter and a bit too much sugar, its a filter coffee which taste more like sugar coffee. When its coffee none want a bengali version of it I'm pretty sure, thus a bit more bitter and less sugar should have done the trick.

Also the salt quotient in the dosas were on the higher side which needs to be brought down along with that the sambar and coconut chutney needs to made more thicker,its too light thus at times the taste goes for a toss .
A nice joint which surely can do better....

This is a very old eatery which was renowned for South Indian food. I spent much of my childhood evenings there. Recently, I visited and found the service to be very very slow. Idli/vada was average. The other day I decided to order a thali. It took half an hour to serve and some of the items were stale. Any complaints to the staff are taken with indifference. The cost of the items has risen considerably but the quality of food and service is not upto the mark.

Old is gold!

This is probably one of the oldest South Indian restaurants in the area. Good, crisp Dosas and cheap well-made Filer Coffees what else can you ask for.
Gave it a 4.5 because the Onion Masala Dosa here is a disaster. Other than that everything else tastes amazing! Do try out the Cheese Masala Dosa.

Zomato has given crazy costings for this place. A proper meal for two would at most cost 200 bucks.

Noisy interiors and ambience is not upto the mark at all. Pretty average food quality but they have got a gigantic variety of south Indian food. Being a pocket friendly place its crowded mot of the time. Service is relatively faster and the staff is very efficient in handling such crowds.  Cold chocolate is nice. Podi dosa is my favourite. Rava dosa is another cool thing that everyone should try :)

If you are in Lake market then you should definitely try this place coz they serve delicious south indian dosas,uttapams and idlis at a very reasonable price.

¬†

If you are a college student then this place is worth trying as it‚Äôs a pocket-friendly restaurant.



The decor and ambiance might not appeal you but the foods will definitely tickle your taste buds.

Must try- mixed uttapam,rava dosa,masala dosa,onion uttapam,sada vada and cold coffee.

For some time now there has been no strike by the union here. The place is everything that is both right and wrong with Kolkata - inexpensive, tasty food, homely, troublesome unions, surly waiters, suspect hygiene.
¬†The place has been around for ages and has more than just survived unlike sadly Ramkrishna - no longer very south indian, Laxmi Vilas¬† no longer existing. Clearly the current management at Prema Vilas is dertemined not to go into the night and is going about the right way reigning in, turning out and pushing up.
Food is authentic south Indian. Service is authentic unionised - last time¬† I was here the chap was unable to tell me where the butter in the butter masala dosai was. I could tell - it was not there...
The location and pricing are two good reasons to visit the place. Especially if the Queue at Banana Leaf¬† next door is longer than your hunger...The food here can give Banana leaf a run for its money

Location: In the lane exactly opposite to Lake Mall, Rashbehari Avenue. 

This age old place has been here for years now and has been serving it's customers with utmost respect and looking out to their requests in the most homely manner possible. But, the sad part is the place isn't known to people thus, remains almost deserted.
My brother had recommended me this place (being his favorite since childhood) and me being an ardent lover of South Indian food, just had to drop in soon. Like really soon!! And here I am just a few days after the recommendation. :-P 

The ambiance out here is calm and quite peaceful. A step away from all the commotion. 
Talking about the food, ordered the following across two visits: 

- Idli
Fluffy & Melt-in-the-mouth type. Served hot. 
Liked it. 

- Vada 
Crisp on the outside, soft inside. Tasted good. 

- Paper Plain Dosa 
Wasn't as crispy as it was supposed to be. 
Yet, was good to eat. 

- Onion Rava Masala Dosa 
Super thin and crisp, but, not a single hint of extra oil. 
The masala was flavourful.
Amount of onion was generous. 

- Molgapodi
Served along with hot oil (fortune). That's the way but, with hot Sesame oil, partially impressed. 

‚Ä¢ The sambhar was decent, but, have had better.
‚Ä¢ The coconut chutney was good. 

The staff here is courteous & friendly and are well-informed taking the hospitality a level up. 
Quick service adds up to the hospitality. 

The costs wouldn't burn a hole in your pocket. 
A plus for the place, opens up quite early thus people can takeaway early breakfasts. 

A great experience it was. :) 
-Would keep visiting. 
-Added to the list of preferred places for breakfast takeaways.

Crossed this place lot of times but never went inside and after this recent experience, i regretted that to the core. Its quite old a south indian restaurant but somehow i feel its a bit underrated, moreso due to banana leaf being located so nearby. Located opposite lake mall, its quite big and spacious. The place is pretty clean, tidy and well lit¬† having been rennovated recently. The staff are well behaved and service is very fast.

Coming to food, i just loved it. The chutney and sambhar were lovely, vada was very crisp n tasty, rava dosa was pretty well made but with an overdose of jeera. The lemon rice was decent. I wanted to try the south indian thali but few items in it were unavailable so thats on my agenda for next visit. The molgapodi was served in hot oil which is uncommon in kolkata and it tasted amazing. I wish they start serving paniyaram as well.

Overall, i loved the food here but what separates this place from others is the sense of calm and peace inside.

I like this restaurant. I went it the evening this one time and it was quite nice, albeit a bit crowded. I gave it a 3.5 versus a 4.0 for Rama Krishna Lunch Home since I had visited the latter int he afternoon and enjoyed their calm and quiet ambiance. But I guess afternoons here will also be similar. I am not a connoisseur of South Indian dishes and I ordered a Masala Dosa and it was very tasty, in my humble and non-connoisseur opinion. I recommend this place if you want a simple ambiance and good South Indian food. The ambiance is as I said, very simple. Don't expect fine dining. Expect good food.

It was by sheer coincidence that I found through Zomato that Prema Vilas was back in business. Back in the 1980s when I was still in school, this restaurant was a week-end regular for my family, and visiting this joint after more than 15 years brought back memories for me and parents, who I made it a point to drag along.
The food was still the same - tasty to the core and the service was quick too, just as it used to be. For those unfamiliar to this place, Prema Vilas is one of the best South Indian restaurants in town - a no-nonsense venue and with no flashiness. But what it lacks in decor and stylish ambiance it certainly does make up with it's food. There were 5 of us, and our order consisted of Masala Dosas, Onion Masala Dosas, Rava Masala Dosas, a plate of Onion Pakodas and 2 plates of Aloo Bondas. We washed this meal down with South Indian style coffee. My order was a Onion Masala Dosa, and I can definitely say that it tasted just like it did 15 years back, the same crispiness and the same satisfying masala filling. The sambhar was just as tasty, and I could not get enough of the chutney!
If you like good South Indian food, then Prema Vilas is definitely the place to go to

I simply do not know why I never went to this place.... reading reviews on Zomato decided to give this place a shot. It is located in the lane bang opposite Lake mall and is a very old place which has just received a facelift. Also I got to know that my grandmom used to Love the idlis here.

The place was neat and clean and smells of Sambhar. The whiff can be quite enchanting in the monsoon weather.

Coming to the Food,

The idli was soft and the Sambhar was simply delicious... they gave a coconut chutney and a garlicky tomato chutney both were nice.

The curd Wada was not very south Indian in taste as it was topped with sonth chutney and bhujiya

The dhania dosa was delicious but a little more coriander masala would have made it better

The rawa onion dosa was paper thin... and super light

We ordered the special chutney and malligapodi both were awesome

The semiya payasam was a bit of a disappointment or else I would have rated a 5
Overall pure happiness On a monsoon afternoon

Good genuine south indian which you can surely try if u r in the area. Been there for many many yrs and still very simple, good and not a burden on the pocket. The upma is good, so is the vada. Dosa are hot and crispy and dont forget to try the filter coffee. Service is fast and not too crowded. So if you dont get a place in its more glamorous neighbours in the area, do get into the small lane opposite Lake Mall and do try Prema Vilas.

A simple no nonsense South Indian joint dishing out quality food at reasonable prices. That would be the perfect summary of this place. I have a lot of nostalgia with this place having frequented it during my childhood days. It was a visit after almost 10 years and I was nicely surprised to find that it's not that hot and rustic place any more. It now has AC and has been revamped. 
Service was lightning quick but the Dosas and other standard stuff that we tried could have been crispier. They were tasty none the less and the chutneys and sambars were of good quality. 

I found that it is still a place which has the old world charm and is frequented by individuals with whom you can strike up an impromptu conversation that can turn to a hearty adda! 

It can be crowded during peak hours though. Prices are decent. Not that I'll want to go back there for the food, but every time I go I am rewarded with a nice little memory of an interesting conversation with someone. That alone will make me awars at least 4 out of 5!

You can't miss this place. It is located in the gully opposite Lake Mall (Big Bazar) and has been serving up the most authentic value for money South Indian since I can remember. I used to come here with my grand pa when I was a child for the paper dosa.
 Being back in Kolkata, I had to try out this place again. And it did not disappoint. They have made it air conditioned which is always a positive change. Idli plate is Rs 38.00 for two pieces. Value for money !! Loved the crispy vadas. 
My mother and husband loved the rava onion masala dosa which was very filling. Then cups of filter coffee. Wonderful.
  I am not a fan of sambar but here, I asked them to refill my bowl many times. They have got the best sambar -- thick, spicy and its for veges too.

On Saturday and Sunday -- You get tomato onion chutney in addition to white chutney. That's yummy !

Recommendation -- Order Podi and Oil with your Idli. Try the spicy "gun powder".
                                      Try the mini thali for lunch/dinner if you are not a big eater.

I was there couple of weeks ago and was there for the first times. The prices were very reasonable and the food was great. There is not too much of ambience there but it wouldn't be right to expect a theme or ambience at that reasonable cost. Just lots of space for each table (which is a rarety these days) and a very clean restaurant.
Loved it!!!

An authentic south Indian restaurant, love to be there for sunday brunch. Recent make over with AC made it comfortable.  Start with cool butter milk, then Masala vada or sambar vada and continue with onion rava dosa. You must be full by now & burping. Finish off with addictive filter kaapi. In case you are not on diet, must try cheese masala dosa. If your companion is not in mood for dosa and insists on luchi- alur tarkari, go for puri masala than puri kurma. Enjoy a wholesome meal there.

Thank GOD Prema Vilas re-opened after along gap of God-knows-how-many-years. One of the oldest restaurants serving south Indian dishes, in this locality. 

Started out having dosas here. Then we had plain dosas, and I remember I used to have 2 plain dosas, as 1 was not enough for me.

You get the right kind of environment, that matches with the meals you are having. Simple and neat.
And the food is just so authentic & needless to say, fantastic !!!

Although I'm not a enthusiast of South Indian food, For the occasions I want to have Idlis, Dosas, and Uttapams this is the place I visit. Its conveniently located, a few minutes from rashbehari crossing and the food they serve is fresh, tasty and very appealing to my taste buds. The prices are not high and you can enjoy a decent meal without spending much. The place is nice, clean with adequate seating area. 4 stars surely.

A  great  place  for  South  Indian  food!  It  had  been  quite  sometime  since  I  visited  the  last  time,  but  used  to   frequent  this place  often  with  my  mom. The dosas and  the  uttapams  are damn  good,  and  their   coconut chutney  is  memorable ! The  ambiance  is  simple and  apt  for  a  South  Indian  restaurant ,  the  place  is  clean  and  family  friendly  with  ample   seats  ,  good  environment , nice  pricing and    good  service!  Overall   a  satisfied  customer !

Again another place which re ignites a lot of my memories as I remember how I as a child used to come here with my parents or my grandmother.
It has so much to talk of as it has shifted from a very busy and well known south Indian joint in Lake Market to a relatively lesser known one.
I remember the crispy dosas and the idlis coming steaming hot and my parents cutting it into smaller pieces so that I can have it with ease. 
Their idlis as always are soft and fluffy while the vadas are always crisp and very good to eat. This is the first place where I started off with uttapam a dish I still have a deep liking for and prefer over many others. I always used to end it with a three layered coffee introduced to me by my father in my childhood days.
 They too have started with the A.C. but I did not find it quite effective.
The reason it has not been able to sustain its fame anymore is simply because sadly their owner passed away and then who came in next also tried but failed to retain his success and then I guess even he too passed away or maybe does not come any more.
Later I came to know from word of mouth that the management changed and now the workers themselves run it. I am not very sure of the fact though.
The food is very good and they have always maintained the cleanliness of the place. It had closd down its operations also once upon a time but is up and running again so I had gone few days back to relive some old memories. 
Decor wise it might not be comparable to Banana Leaf but the quality or the quantity will never fall short.
If you are reading my review and if you do go then do try out their triple layered coffee....
Enjoy your meal at Prema Vilas because even on my last visit I found the quality of food to be pretty similar though after having closed down and reopened I expected some better decor but its not a bad one at all. They also have quite an extensive menu.

this place is nostalgic for me, I remember having second helpings of the coconut chutney as a kid :) the place is squeaky clean, food is  moderately priced, and authentic as well. what more can one ask for?? it's a pity that not many people know about it even though it's quite an old establishment

Prema Vilas is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata serving South Indian food. The place has been renovated recently. But the food is still the same. :)
This place is very nostalgic for me. I used to come here with my mother after school :)
Now for the review. I came back here after years today. The place has been recently renovated, with Ac's and marble floors and a fresh coat of paint.
I had the Rava Butter Cheese Masala Dosa. It was great. Fried lightly in butter ( ;) )  dipped in ajwain. The masala was lightly spiced just to perfection.
The butter milk (Chaas) which i order to digest the food later, it did the trick.
Overall a really good place. Though there is still a debate which is better, Banana leaf, or Prema Vilas?

Prema Vilas.. It is located in Deshapriya Park in the lane just next to Banana Leaf.
This place is under rated. I think, Very less people know about this place and I guess that is the only reason that we were the only customers on a Saturday Morning.. although the menu card states that it is present since at least 50 years. Even I came to know about this restaurant through Zomato, had never heard of it before. It looks like it has recently been renovated with air cons and all. It serves scrumptious Udupi fare. Those who like Banana Leaf and Ramakrishna Lunch Home will like this too. In fact, I found it better than Banana Leaf. The vadas and dosas are as good, if not better, AND much less oily. The idlis are much softer than most places in town. Sambhar and Coconut Chutney are good too. It is very clean and provides quick service. The timings are good too. It opens as early as 7 for breakfast, which is great plus as there is a dearth of South Indian Breakfast places in Calcutta compared to other metros. The prices are same as what you would pay at a Banana Leaf or a Raj. So why not try a new, better place?!
Four and a Half Stars from Me :)

Authentic South Indian meals at a great price! The dosas   & idlis are superb and at the same time very economical. The service is not bad, but the dining area can be renovated into a much better restaurant! Must try once; you wont regret :D

yes the same type of south Indian food. nothing different. but even so, the best of it is here.

I have been going here since I was a kid, occasionally for a taste change aka different food. I never had to face a problem here. the staff are kind and Greet me always. the masala dosas are stuffed with good quantities of fresh looking vegetables. the sambar is rich in taste and the coconut curry is very healthy. idli and uthapam are so so. 
I personally think this is one of the best and old south Indian food restaurant in south Kolkata. do go for a taste change. you won't regret.

This place is perfect for authentic south Indian food. For a change a restaurant that gets the south indian flavours just right! the menu is a delightful mix of south indian delicacies ..try out the masala dosa and thali meals...defiantly suggested to foodies with an insatiable south indian pallet!
