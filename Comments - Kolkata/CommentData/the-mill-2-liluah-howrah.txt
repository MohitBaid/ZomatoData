Perhaps the only proper pub which is near to Hooghly and the Ambience is happening. The LIIT that we ordered was great but the Sangria wasn't. Starters are pretty well cooked and is delicious @

I really liked this restaurant. I visited here today with my elder sis and my brother-in-law.  The food is tasty, ambiance is great. and staff is very polite and helpful. Moreover, I really appreciated the manager wanting the feedback from the customers too.    I had four items, XO noodles, Chicken Fried Rice, Murg Makkhan Wala and the Revival beverage.  I loved the XO noodles. Its just awesome.      The only reason I gave a 4 rating is to tell the authorities, well done !!! keep up the good work and work on all the opportunities you receive.

This place, is one of it's kind in the area. I think it's the only proper good restaurant/lounge in the area. I have been there several times since the day they opened and the place never disappoints.

Even though tje Indian cuisine is good, I'd suggest try the Chinese. The chicken starters, burnt garlic fried rice and chicken in oyster sauce are really nice.

But more than food, try the mocktails. They are actually some of the best in the city at the cheapest rate. Kiwi lime mocktail and virgin mojito are my favourite.

Went for a dinner with family, ordered prawn biriyani, chicken biriyani and chicken bharta only. Bharta was well cooked and was flowing with flavours. Biriyani was good specially the prawns but I expected more from the chicken biriyani. Price seemed a little on higher side. Ambience is that of a garage themed rustic decor that blends nice with the Edison bulbs and creats a fine decor. Staff is attentive. Can be a place for a drink or dinner sometimes, there are not many quality restaurants in the region anyway.

The location of this restaurant is at the top floor of Forum Rangoli Mall , Belur. This newly opened place is one of the best restaurants near my place. I took my friend for dinner. We ordered Garlic Coriander Noodles, Pan Fried chicken in Chili oyster and Carlsberg Elephant Beer. Really loved the noodles. The chicken was little spicy . The service was good and the decor was excellent

Visited here with my family fo dinner, first impression... The ambiance is good.... Quite a small place from inside... But it look big from outside...
Food : we order chicken reshmi kabab, cilantro chicken and crispy chili baby corn and we can say these taste good... Cilantro chicken is awesome... It is fixed in my list for every visit in future... Chicken reshmi kabab's taste was fine but it is little dry, it should be little more jucy... Baby corn taste is good...
Main course we ordered masala kulcha, corn methi matar malai, chicken bharta, mixed fried rice, chicken hakka noodles... Taste of all items are really awesome specially corn methi matar malai and mixed fried rice... the ingredients in the rice are in perfect quantity and it satisfied my taste buds... Chicken bharta is not that good. ....
Service is fast and they are doing their job perfectly.. 
Next visit very soon and will try biryani as the server was insisting on this , so will try. 
One thing for the management they need to dedicate server to each table or set of table this will help ...

The BEST in Howrah in any department i.e Food, Ambience, Service, Staff. You name it and you get it. Don't mind paying a bit extra (as compared to Howrah standards) because the experience is unlike anything ever experienced before. Will be visiting again and again and again.....

I loved the ambience and the decor. The decor was like old school but with class. The staff was very polite and respectful. We ordered the tangra Chilli Chicken which was yummy and spicy, it had the perfect amount of spice in it. Then we went for cocktails. Everything wasn't available since it wasn't on stock so we ordered the metropolitan and easy maker. Metropolitan is a vodka cocktail with cranberry, raspberry, Cointreau and something else whereas Easy Maker was a whisky cocktail. My favorite was definitely the Metropolitan. It had the perfect amount of sweetness and the flavor and yet you could feel that vodka in it. I loved the place.

Since a long we were waiting for a standard restaurant in Howrah.. specially in North Howrah..
by this way this place deserves some extra point from my side..

Now lets come to the proper review...

Decor :- They've decorated the place with old style machineries.. overall looks good, anyhow the feeling is missing.. kept a model of Howrah Bridge in the center part of the place.. that also cool.. but it's being an obstruction to view the large screen TV kept on the wall from other side..

Ambiance:- Good enough.. there were a few table occupied on that day.. so we had a peaceful environment.. Some Soft Rock were playing that really goes with the environment..

Service :- Staffs are very well behaved and much friendly.. the Manager himself came to us and asked for feedback and suggestion.. only thing disappoint us they've put off the AC as only us left till the end.. after asking, they switched it on again.. 

now the most important part -

Food :- Though a very less number of items available on their Menu.. they've prepared some items according to our choice beyond the Chart..  the cooking was very good...
We had taste only the Chinese cuisine on that day..
I liked the Pan Fried Noodles the most..
Prices are a bit high, but justified to the Taste, Ambiance and Service..

On a quiet rainy afternoon we had our lunch here. The place is neatly decored with mill motifs. Staffs were friendly but we were informed not all the items in the menu will be available. We started with sweet corn chicken soup which was warm and tasted decent. For started we were suggested cliantro chicken and it was undoubtedly the best dish we had their. Full of flavours, delicate chicken dices with some strange green gravy, tasty like anything. For the main course we had mixed fried rice and fish manchurian and both the fish was alright, nothing extra ordinary. Completed the course with scoops of butterscotch. Pocket pinch was moderate.

This place is situated in Forum Rangoli mall, belur.  Me & my 2 friends went there to celebrate my bachelor party on Maha sasthi ( Durga puja).  Ambience is good, well decorated,  staffs are helpful but service is very slow.  We ordered 3 Kiwi Mint Mocktails, chicken Rashmi kebabs,  Cilantro chicken,  Fried rice, noodles , Tangra style chilli chicken, chilli oyster chicken. Our total bill was around 2620 /- During Durga puja,  they overpriced each & every items.

I had been to his place yesterday with my family for lunch. The experience was really good. Based on review of other people I had ordered Fish n Chips and it was really good. Freshness of fish was felt. Among the others we tried a bit of Indian and a bit of Chinese. We ordered Fish N Chips, Tandoori Roti, Masala Kulcha, Veg Jhalfrezi, Veg Fried Rice & Devil Prawn. All were very good. Tandoori Roti was not that satisfactory so I would suggest to improvise on the same and the Devil prawn was too too spicy. 
Ambiance is good and it is a theme restaurant. A beautiful music being played in the background. The pocket pinch is not two high and overall we were very satisfied and look forward for more visits there to try out some other varieties.

It's a new restaurant. Much more training of the staffs are required. It doesn't has a smoking zone, which generally pubs in Kolkata have. Food was good and reasonably priced. Great ambience. The menu is same as other restaurants. A lack of a signature dish for the visitors is noticed. I shall look forward for a new and innovative signature dish for my next visit.

Tasted a lot of things as I have already visited quite a number of times. Its winner dishes are Crispy chilli mushrooms, chicken sweet corn soup,fish n chips,fish fingers(till now the best I have ever had),fish tikka(again the juciest),malai kebabs,malai kofta,masala kulcha,dal makhni. 
Now the mocktails,pinacolada, fresh watermelon infused white rum,fress green apple Margarita,strawberry colada....all are fresh n smooth.The pricing is exorbitant but value for money.But home delivery was dissappointing,smelly kofta cant forget. Quality control is required.

We asking for some starter based on paneer and chicken they served us paneer tikka and pan shared chicken with honey and ginger. Those starter was excellent by taste and presentation. Nooles and chili fish was awesome...
As my wife is non alcoholic the bartender served her a mocktail with kiwi, mint, kafir lime. That was really good..

We went to  the  restaurant on a busy Durga Puja 2017 night. Popular mock tails like Virgin mojito and cocktail like LIIT were not available. To make matters worse, there was no ice to add to our drinks. The food was okay, nothing extraordinary but highly overpriced. Will not recommend for a hangout, though ambience is alright.

Chicken Cilantro - Taste is nice and quality is good.

We went to  the  restaurant on a busy Durga Puja 2017 night. Popular mock tails like Virgin mojito and cocktail like LIIT were not available. To make matters worse, there was no ice to add to our drinks. The food was okay, nothing extraordinary but highly overpriced. Will not recommend for a hangout, though ambience is alright.

First of its kind in the area Liluah-Belur. Boon for people of Belur-Liluah.
Lovely decor depicting the factory mill. Every part is different.
Located on the Food Court floor of The Forum Rangoli Mall.
Is a huge place and has a good many and of several types of seating arrangement.
Good ambience.
Also has a bar and also serve non-veg food.
We were mesmerized with the songs being played. They were of the times of our school and we simply hummed along.
Service and staff is excellent. They really take care of your plates and food.
The food is also good albeit a bit spicy. And that is why one point less to my review. So if you love spicy then it is fine. Or else you need to tell them before hand that you do not need spicy at all.
We tried crispy chilly babycorn, dal suneheri, Paneer jhal farezi and a dessert Mud Slice.
Babycorn was yum. Wonder even after adding so many vegetables and being soggy how could it be so crispy. Dal was also yum. Paneer Jhal Farezi - I found this to be on the sweet side but then that might be because of the many vegetables and specially the tomatoes.
They also have chinese dishes which we might try the next time.
All in all this is the only good and best option in this area and surely is a must try from my recommendation. So just go for it when you are here.

There is always space for improvement and this is the very first Lounge here in Howrah. We ordered for Ch. sweet corn soup 🍜 which appeared to be very sweet and then we got it changed as per our taste which was done appropriately. Fish Finger was superb with crispy crust on it and crunchy 🍟 , but we were served the White mayonnaise sauce on demand. Fresh lime soda was good and virgin mojito was also good. Then in main course we ordered for Boneless Kadhai Chicken and Garlic Naan. Both was upto the mark. One most important point of improvement is to increase the varieties in their Menu in Indian main course as there is only 4 items in this section.

Ambience : 4/5
Staffs behavior : 4/5 
Pocket pinch : 1300 for two

So I was at this new lounge for dinner today with family and we ordered for starters being Tangra Style Chilly chicken, Fish and Chips and main course. The fish was soft and melted in the mouth.Chicken was soft and delicious.Reasonable joint to be at for all those looking for great ambience, decor and good music. A commendable staff,courteous and welcoming.. Service is well managed and coordinated among the staff. A very pleasing atmosphere and lip-smacking delicacies. A must visit place in Liluah, Belur for a satisfying experience. :)

We went for lunch today. The ambience and the staff were very welcoming. We ordered some starters and main course and the quality of the food served was excellent. There was this particular staff Ranjan who really ensured that everything was served properly and on time. 

We are happy that the Mill opened up in Belur.

Finally Howrah/Belur has got a decent restaurant with very cordial staff. I went there on Sunday 13th August with my family and we ordered vegetarian food. The ambiance is fine and food is also good, considering the price. Good part is whatever we ordered were delicious (Crispy chilly babycorn, Fried rice, Pan fried veg noodles, Vegetables in Hunan sauce etc.). 
 
Pocket pinch - Rs. 1100 (2 adults + 2 kids)

My cousins and I took a detour and decided to try this place instead of the Rangoli Food Court.

Ambiance: It is a cosy and comfortable little restaurant. We had the opportunity of choosing a table of our choice because the place was empty. The seating arrangements are comfortable and it's very clean.

Crockery units and cutlery sets were clean. No complaints about cleanliness.

Service: The service was extremely good. The crew is very courteous and welcoming. I gave a 3 star only because of their service and behaviour.

Presentation of food was good as well

Food: Our order was 1. Devil's prawn 2. Chicken tikka kabab 3. Butter naan 4. chicken bharta

The starters were quite good. Loved the flavours of the prawns. The kabab could have been better but it was not bad.

Naan was perfect- it was soft and not chewy

Chicken bharta- Did not like it. It looked GREAT and smelled so aromatic but the taste disappointed me. It tasted sweet and it could have been better.

Drinks: You can never go wrong with Budweisers and a fresh lime soda.

Pocket pinch: The food was not worth Rs. 1914. I have had better for less.
