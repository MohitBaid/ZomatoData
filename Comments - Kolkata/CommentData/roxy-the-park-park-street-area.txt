Went there on 4th August 2017 on a thursday Night as thursdays are the ladies Night... Went there with my friends... The 1st thing was i wanted a peg of vodka but instead of that they provided me with a peg of whiksy... And that is really very disappointing... On being asked that y did they give me a whisky? They started arguing and that specific issue made my mind go wrong and i left the place immediately... Guys, if u wanna play with ur reputation, carry on... And stop letting such shitty crowd inside the club...

AVOID THIS CLUB AT ALL COSTS, unless, you like spending crazy amounts of money. We were a group of 10 tourists looking to have a good night. The bartenders make up prices without showing you the menu. The most expensive tequila on the menu is Rs. 800 for a shot yet we were charged Rs. 1500. The bartenders are hesitant to accept cards and personally ask for cash (presumably because they pocket half of it). This wasn’t the only drink we got ripped off for, we were charged Rs. 1250 per Jägerbomb (a shot is Rs. 500 on the menu).

This club is located in supposedly one of the fanciest hotels in Calcutta (The Park Hotel), yet this club pulls stunts like this. I thought the very fact that it has such an amazing location which would attract 1000s of tourists every month would make it reputable with the bartenders looking out for your best interests. Oh how wrong I was...

So I went to roxy last night. We were a group of 5 couples. As a tourist. Our first night in Kolkata. 
They charged us to enter the club. No problem we paid.

Then we ordered round of drinks. And kept buying. Since it was a large group of people we were buying rounds. 

So we had a brilliant night and today we were discussing about how good it was only to find out we got ripped off terribly by the bartenders. 
So here’s what the bartenders did. They charged us 1500 per shot of tequila, 4500 for 3 shots of tequila. Then they charged us 1250 per jäger bomb. 

So beware if you are a tourist. And managers and owners of the club get your bartenders sorted. 
Will probably think 10 times before visiting again and now won’t have faith in any touristy places. Thanks roxy for a great night !!!!!

Clubbing cant get better in calcutta than this.A very elegant place to be in...amazing decor and quite a big dance floor.A bit overpriced but they have good deals in the ladies night out.This place attracts descent crowd and the music is pretty good the djs does a descent job in the house mixing some peppy bolly numbers sometimes .All over a pretty good club to party in

With a proper evening ambiance, Roxy creates a special thursday arrangement for ladies in the town. You will get yummy chicken, barbecued with proper spices. This will help you bring down your week long stress when you gulp one or two shots of flavoured vodka. To add on drinks are free only on thursdays for ladies, but you will have to pay for the food you order. Go and have a look. You will surely love it.

Being near to my location, I always wanted to visit this place, n so finally got the chance to celebrate my birthday at Roxy.. The ambience is really different n music is also top notch..food is fine.. Though drinks are bit high priced, but considering the fact that it's situated inside a 5star hotel, it's ok.. Overall had a good experience n willing to go back again very soon..

Located in the heart of Parkstreet, Roxy is home to all the party lovers. The music, the ambience, nightlife, everything about this place is absolutely great. The cocktails n shots needs special mention. Don't forget to put on your dance shoes, the next time you visit this place and dance like craaaaazy!

Situated in the heart of Park Street, Roxy is the perfect place for an afterparty or a night out with friends. The finger foods and cocktails never let you down. Also the DJ will ensure that your "spirits" remain high - with a mix of Bollywood, EDM, pop, retro and even some Dhaki beats (during Durga pujo)! And of course the good crowd and dance floor definitely enhances the experience.

If there would b a chance to give a minus point I would have.Going here was one of my worst decisions.Today I went down around 10.30 with my girlfriends.The lady at the reception just sent us away saying that the entrance was only for members even though it was Thursday and it was a ladies night and it was supposed to be free.We later asked a group of ladies who said that they had come in for free.We again went to speak with the receptionist regarding this.We got a chance to speak with the manager who allowed my friends but didn't allow me even though I had my identity card only God knows for what reason.It was a pathetic experience for me I was truly disgusted by the way the management treat there guests.Roxy is just a label that's all.

First of all, yes indeed it's a great place with amazing ambiance... 
But then I felt it's a little too crowded and also the space is very less and not fully organised....!!!
Finally the DJ, he was very good and had a very amazing and unique collection....don't expect bollywood music before 12.30...!!

The place has a great ambience, but you shouldn't go there before 11 pm, it's totally empty. But if you want to have a gala and private time with your friends or girlfriend, then you've come to the right place. It was too expensive. I went there with 3 of my friends. Only couples are allowed. No stags. And we took 3 beers and 2 starters and it was Rs 1642 only. Quite reasonable.

Ladies night is one of the best time to visit this place as you get free drinks but in limited stock. Music and ambiance is great. People will enjoy more after 10pm but before that roxy seems to be empty and the DJ plays all the hit hollywood songs close to midnight. Service was fine and the best part is to click selfies in the hall area.

Went with a couple of my friends. The drinks that they offer within the cover charges are not much to choose from. Anyway chug all you can from what you're getting. We took a plate of chilli chicken only to go with the drinks. But judging by the quality and quantity that they give we found it pretty overpriced. Improvement in any one of the compartment is expected from them. Anyway will visit again for the drinks.

Had been there with a few of my friends and this place is perfect for enjoying the nightlife of Kolkata. There are different packages for drinks. Now, I don't drink so I was more into the food, ambience and the music. The food was just okay. There were limited options.What I loved was the the ambience! It jist sets the mood for dancing. The music was awesome. They had this retro night where they played everything from George Michael to pink Floyd to venga boys to Linkin park and pretty much every song you used to dance to back in your childhood. After that another dj played the latest English dance songs.Do go there if you want to have a good time.

Clubbing redefined. Especially with the crowd on saturday night. With the ambience being at its best with customed dj and music with one of a kind drinks to support. A thrilling crowd with an exhilitaring energy to get the best of the vibes in a city like Kolkata. The crowd remains decent and the security is quite apt to lean on. Overall saturday nights become one of a kind with a sheer visit here.

This is one of the few classy places to hang out.. specially with someone special.. Only thing you need to be aware of is the charges ..
Make sure you have enough bucks to spend..

Nightlife is a very essential part of a city. Roxy doesn't disappoint at all, the vibe is perfect, the ambience is quirky, music is loud and happening and the crowd is decent. It is a vibrant place to go and dance or even just to enjoy the peeped up environment. Think of clubbing, this is your go to place.

I dont whats the problem in entry at the enterance. I visited last saturday i get entry without any problem and i went another day at the same place..the bouncer was standing outside of the club and told me that we give entries to members only for everyday. Even i asked him that is there any procedure to get membership for this club ? He said i dont know sir. Even as per my knowledge many peoples get stag entries there without any membership.i love this place and i m ready to take membership also because this club is too good and crowd is superb on weekends.
 Can anyone let me know regarding this membership issues and entry problems ?

Excellent place to party. When you enter park, after the coffee shop ends turn on your right to enter to this place. Great ambiance, they have good and comfy seating arrangements upstairs as well as the ground but you don't always find a seat there. The DJ plays kick-ass music after 10 pm. This is my go to place for partying in Kolkata.

An awesome place in city's heart to chill out. In love with their ambience. Been there for many times. But this time i had to write. We went on thursday and full paisa wasool entertainment. Just a small problem, they were unable to handle the bar properly due to lack of bartenders. Otherwise everything was great

Nice place for partying. Girls don't miss out the ladies night on Thursdays where the drinks from selected brands are on the house. The best part about this place is the crowd which is quite decent unlike some other clubs. Only one thing though...this place and especially the dance floor turned out to be much smaller than what I had expected it to be. Still the DJ makes up for that. Overall a good experience!

First of all if you are looking for a good place to go clubbing , this is THE place for you. The DJ was so amazing that we ended up dancing for 4-5hrs straight. Me and my friends went on a Friday and we got unlimited booze for just 1500rs (we got seriously wasted ). The food was good ,I can't say much on that as we concentrate on the booze more. The ambience is really good. Do check out this place !!!

Roxy is the place to be if one wants to see the kolkata's nightlife scene upclose. It is one of the veterans if clubbing is concerned. Located in the parkstreet which is the hub of clubs , restaurants and bars.
Have been going to this place way before zomato existed. The management has not changed much over the years.

Most people come here for free alcohol. On the 29th of dec we went there.
The ambience is great for partying. The dj also is super cool and plays nice songs. There's also a small dance floor. Though the price is high but who cares when u got free alcohol with cool dj and great ambience that too in the heart of the city park street 😍.

A top class place to party.

In general the people here so classy that even being alone wont make a difference. 

Stag entry is restricted here. On a normal day also i haven't seen they are allowing stags.

On new year eve rixy play good dj.

They crete a place for dance as well. 

Overall a nice place to hang out .

The entry fee will be not like other places so a big yes and chances being clicked and broadcasted on a newspaper is also a high chance here. 

A hot shot contender for the top slot

One of the best discs in Kolkata. Period.

This place is located on the ground floor of The Park Hotel in the Park Street area of Kolkata. The music is awesome, the DJ is pretty cool, the food and the drinks are too good. The crowd here is amazing, beautifully dressed and always in the party mood. One is assured of having a wonderful time in their every visit to this place.

I am a regular here and have never been disappointed in the gentry and the party atmosphere of this place. Nice, trendy music with latest songs hitting the dance floor. People dancing whole night, this place is open till the wee hours of the morning. 

Thursday night is the ladies night and one can expect a lot of crowd here. This place is jammed packed on Fridays and Saturdays.The place becomes lively and buzzing only after 11 pm and one can party hard till around 3 am. 

You simply cannot afford to miss this place if you are planning to party in Kolkata.

It was Ashtami night and there were crazy young people in the house but sadly the DJ was playing certain old, "not too fun" songs. The playlist could have been better.

Price: High. But we have to consider the fact that it's a 5 star property.

I have always been partying here since 2010. I myself belong from an F&B department, owning a restaurant. I have always liked this place for weekend clubbing and socialising with my friends but today I Was really disappointed with the management. I absolutely know about the charges taken any the night clubs for stags. I party almost in all the good / well known clubs in Kolkata. I was asked for an entry charge today (thats not an issue) but in a rude manner.
I have been clubbing from last 7 years in Kolkata and I have been giving respect and expecting the same from the management. I think today the way to welcome a guest was actually rude and not the way actually it should be.

You will either like it or dislike it, but you can't ignore it. Right at the entrance of The Park Kolkata,  the place appears to be a favorite with the crowd. They have a flat charge for stag entry, which include unlimited IMFL drinks,  girls get free entry. The place is mostly full of young college girls in ultra western outfits and lot of middle aged people staring at the crowd. The music is OK and very loud. So if you are out to have a conversation this is certainly not the place to go. 

Service is very poor and the staff by the bar is extremely misbehaved with no sense of service.

So if you are out to have a conversation this is certainly not the place to go. 

Service is very poor and the staff by the bar is extremely misbehaved with no sense of service.

Great place to party and dance till you drop. Music played here is awesome. Lighting is perfect for a night club. Price is sonething to look upon.. a pint of beer @550 is something too much. But kolkata has only handful of great night club and Roxy is one among them..I wish they could reduce the price bit..

When you are new to the city from places like Mumbai or Delhi, the first resort you look for partying in Kolkata is definitely Roxy. Been here a lot of times with my friends and loved the music and ambience. And when you are bunch of girls, just step in your dancing shoes and get on the floor for ladies night. 
But recently, the quality of the crowd has deteriorated and it would be better if they filter their entrants better.

Has always been my favourite place to party in the city. I absolutely love this place for clubbing. The crowd is chic enough. I love to come here on fridays and saturdays because the music is just great on the weekends and the crowd is good too. The only problem in Roxy is that the dance floor is small. Not enough space specially when the dance floor is packed on weekends. This causes problems and i would love it all the more if the dance floor was bigger. Djs are really good here. Good music. Beautifully decorated on special days. Theme nights. Bar is again small for which at times we have to wait for some time to get our drink. But overall a Thumbs Up.

Always loved Roxy. Music is good ,and the crowd profile is chic enough. Alcohol is quite expensive , but that's to be expected. They have quite a few interesting cocktails which I hadn't heard of previously. Yet to be charged for entry as they don't seem too fussed about people just walking in

No! No no no! No no no no ! Big NO!

That should be my headline of my review. Went there last year Halloween ( 31st October) with my bae & 3 other friends, never expected The Park would have this stupid place kept under their name! Should had been warned by the entry price only which was 500/- for couple, that too on Friday Halloween party!DJ was bogus, kept on playing repeatative & old slow un-dj like tracks ( Lean on was played 3 times & in October night, DJ played summer of '69😂😂😂) most of them cannot make you dance or feel free/ happy or anything but to remind you constantly that you have ruined your night by coming here!! Also the cleaning staffs kept coming to the dance floor with mops and brooms (Yes! that happened!! When people were dancing! They might have cursed me when I stepped on their brooms😂😂)
Last but not the least, I also lost my clutch there with ATM card, 2000/- cash & my Mac make- ups worth at least 4000/- or more & the authority were least interested even to listen to me, after waited for 45 minutes when we were leaving around 2am, we were told to call next day to check and when I called next morning, the operator & his manager heard it first time that someone lost something last night !
Never I am coming back here ever again!

Was there in Roxy on friday. My boyfriend Anf I took the 1100AI package and it was definitely worth it! The music was great and would especially like to thank Ankit who was behind the bar who was so pleasant and alert. I had asked him to concot one of my favourite cocktail and he did it just right everytime. Even in the jam packed crowd he never showed any sign of stress and I got my favourite cocktail without having to wait. Will definitely visit it again.

I often used to visit 'Blush Thursday' in Roxy, apparently last night the gate manager told us that it's only allowed for members! Huh, give me a break,in the promotional post (Roxy Group), they never mentioned that 'it's applicable only for members' or 'Entry by Invitation only'. The membership procedure was not there last week as well as 2 weeks ago when I last visited. Also We friends were having decent dressed up, so surely cannot arise a question of so-called Profile.

Now my question to the authority of The Roxy, what the reasons for being biased and showing such a hypocrisy! Is that a call against racism or are we threatening to be anti-social.?? Some of my colleagues were allowed to enter without being membership at that very precise moment! Such a humiliation never faced. I will make sure none of my friends, colleagues from my Organization would visit this place ever.

Went there on a thursday night to party. The place has a great vibe and the music is good,but the dj doesn't entertain song requests.
Coming to drinks,I loved their rum and coke blend,but did not like the vodka shots,which they give mixed with tropicana juice.
It was a nice place to relax and dance. There were some wierd fellows in the crowd,though...which put me off.

Located in Park Street. You can very easily locate THE PARK.

Went there on a Thursday night. The ambience is awesome. The music that were being played would definitely set you for the party. Yay ! Everyone of us danced to our heart's content. 

It has comfortable seating arrangements, as well. And the space upstairs is even more fun. 

Though some bar tenders were very much reluctant, yet some of the others and the staffs managed to have a positive impression. 

Since unlimited drinks were available, Alcoholic people (especially, all the girls out there), Pull your socks and set the stage on fire. :D. Nice to visit for partying with your baes.

The Best Club I have ever been in Kolkata. Awesome Music Ambience with the best sound quality. The Crowd u will get there is Standard if compared with other Night Clubs. The Manager of Roxy standing in front of the Gate is an A**hole. He don't have any idea about how to behave with the customers. Through Money in his Face. I have noticed many a times he allows his Friends to get entry for free.
Overall except that Idiot, Everything's good.

My favorite party place in the city, Roxy never fails. The pumping music converts the entire place into a dance floor. The bartenders may take a while to serve on weekend nights, but that is totally understandable. If your feet are aching from all the dancing, head upstairs and relax on their unbelievably soft beds.

Roxy is one place that will never disappoint you, no matter what.

Location: Ground floor of Park Hotel.

Food and liquor: top notch. 

Ambience: vibrant. The music there would get you off your feet.

Crowd: good.

Management: the service there is prompt. And the staff there are more than helpful.

The party destination of Kolkata. They have a ladies night every Thursday. The entry price is > ₹1000. But once you enter, all the drinks are on the house. The environment is such that it will tempt you to dance and dance till you can. And you can drink all you like and as much as you can till 11:30pm. A good place to visit once in a while. But beware, if you plan to order food, be ready to spend a good amount.

Roxy was the best club I could find while I was in Kolkata. Sure the guy at the entrace is a dick but if you make your way through, it's confirmed that you are going to have a good night. I went on a friday around 10 in the night. Paid 1500 for the cover which included unlimited Ballantines whiskey or Absolute vodka till 11:30. (Now that's some offer :P) Had an amazing night, the music was real good pleasure to my ears. Was there till 3 in the morning, met so many happy drunk faces. There's only 1 picture I took there and that too with this beautiful lady from argentina. I wish I remembered her name.

Set in the 60s decor This nightspot has a mystique of its own! This place is one of the few places you get quality crowd in Kolkata thanks to its high rate cards for keeping the wannabes aside!
Coming to the ambience this small groove point is always jammed with swarming people all around,
Djs and music choices are good. Overall after evaluating all the nightspots i personally recommend Roxy as my 'Numero Uno'

Upon visiting other various chilling epicenters round the city i miss the certain vibe in them which only a regular Roxy goer wil understand!

Love you Roxy!!

Great place for weekend parties. Good crowd, nice interiors, free to smoke anywhere, no boundary defining time to close down the place and to top it all brilliant service.
Music was a little turn off for me, but the ambience made it up.
Alcohol is a little on the expensive side, but it is expected to be.

On a Saturday night, Roxy is the place to be!

We had arrived there around 8.30-9pm on a Saturday evening and were the first ones to arrive there. We were happy to be seated at the table of our choice and have some food and drinks before we, and the place, turned on the Club mode.

The ambiance is really great! Perfect lights and music. The service staff was really courteous in helping us with the menu. The cocktails/mocktails and food dishes all were really great!
As time passed on, around 10.30-11 the place started coming to life with more and more people entering and the DJ setting the mood right! The crowd coming here is really good and wouldn't creep you out unlike few other places. The DJ did play a lot of unheard(for me) tracks but good music nonetheless. Very few Hindi tracks...so if that is what you groove to then there isn't much of that here.

Gave a 4.5 instead of a perfect 5 rating because once the crowd gathers, it becomes really difficult to order food and drinks.

Do visit Roxy for a great clubbing experience! Guys, do remember the dress code :)

I'm not much of a nightclub person. But this place has it, to change my mind, every time im in the city.

Why?
- Decent crowd. (The management does a good job in weeding out the rut)
- Awesome music.
- Pretty expensive !! (Yup, that's not a great thing, unless someone else is paying for you)

Workaround to that:
They generally have ladies nights on Thursdays. Good time to visit with a lady friend.

PS: Gets super loud and the dance floor is super crowded on weekends !!
Hence, for nature lovers and claustrophobics --> Think again ..

One of the best places to enjoy the city's nightlife. You get to see a lot of events happening over here. And the crowd is really energetic. A superb place to enjoy with your friends. It gives me the much needed breather after a hectic week. Although the drinks are really pricey but I guess its okay to indulge once in a while. Oh! And I love watching people dance rather than dancing myself.. :-P

I guess I am a lazy party person. Or maybe just growing old. Or lacking a sense of adventure. I am not quite sure. But a night out clubbing, since the time I was 16, has always been Roxy. Never quite got the hang of it elsewhere (I prefer a good pub over a club, maybe that's why). But yes, if you are in the mood for dancing, head over on a Friday or Saturday night, get ready to spend on grossly overpriced drinks, be prepared to be disappointed by a crowd that's become frankly pretty darn shady, and just dance away with your squad. Or not. 
Pay no mind to this, however, I am NOT a clubby person. :)

As an avid traveller and foodie, Roxy in Kolkata has been on my bucket list for a long time..since it's very much costly and it is situated in Park hotel .I can't afford to go such places regularly..I am a middle class person but a biig foodie..whatever money I get from my elders during puja and half of my income I saved it for myself to spend on food and drinks. So this year I decided I will visit this place anyhow. I saw one advertisement from roxy in fb..#Famous Friday #Unlimited drinks at 1200 AI ..So I decided to go this place with one of my friend. I was very excited but UNFORTUNATELY I can't get to enter this place as no STAGS are allowed..
Yes I don't have gf or any female friends who will accompany me to party all night..
I want to request all the PR and events staff of park hotel that while giving such advertisement in fb..please mention clearly that there is no stag entry..It's totally humiliating.
Thank you!!

Easily one of the best clubs in town which boasts of one of the best DJ's on the console alongside some real good music and some damm jazzy crowd to go with.If you want to see the kolkata nightlife this is easily one of THE places to be at especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Their themed nights are always a hit with jazziest of crowds being part of it.

Music wise is simply real good,it wont let you down at all. Bar isn't too big thus one do have wait a bit for your drinks but yeah that is understandable due to the heavy footfall it receives.

One of the must visits for those who are in the clubbing scene

Was there in halloween special party night, dj was not that good, played repetitive numbers throughout the night. Ambience & crowd were good. The sweepers & cleaning staffs were coming right in between the floor with a broomstick all over again & again. Have never seen this weird thing in any club before.

Worst night club in Kolkata, the manager denied us entry citing a reason that he doesn't know me and said its a members only club. Now its either Zomato's fault that they didn't mention this thing before hand or the Club manager is really out of his mind and he don't know what he is talking about, anyways my evening was ruined.

The music is mixed well and the acoustics are not bad though could be much better. Dancing and socializing here is also fun sometimes. Definitely one of the better places to go to at Park for a drink.

Perhaps an upmarket lounge one of its kind, Roxy will leave a lasting effect on anyone who loves to Booz on great music!!

I would say the lights & ambiance it creates are just electrifying. Quite amazed to know that Roxy has time slots for respective genre of music & we were fortunate to witness the mix of  great retro hits!!!

Limited spread of foods with great taste but an extended list of liquors to opt for. Cocktails  are fab & I must say they're done with utmost care....

Have tried their Manhattan & Rhode Island mix with their charcoal flamed non veg kebab with prawn and grand seafood platter on side dishes....both were good enough to go with drinks of any kind.

Only dissatisfaction being the price which does offer a pinch on your pocket!!

I haven't been to Roxy a long time, like 4 years. Last night, at 10 pm when 4 of us, 2 couples asked the reservation guy at the desk for entry charges, the guy blindly refused us an entry as we did not have a membership of Roxy. Does anybody knows about the NEW membership policy that they have. The experience was not only horrific, but left a bad taste of The Park management altogether. They dont know how to treat their guests.

When it comes to night life in Kolkatta it doesn't get any better than this. I have visited almost all the clubs here but this is just the best. 
An anecdote here...  One day I decide to club hop and stay put on the best one. Started from dolce vita to privy to nocturne to m bar...  And well ended up here. Again! Couldn't find anything better... 
The music is good enough. Crowd is fine. The liquor is expensive. Service is OK! Would probably keep visiting over and over as long as I stay here... Cheers!

Seriously? If you have been to clubs in LA, Bangkok, NY, Miami, or even in Gurgaon or in Bangalore, you will find better clubs than this or atleast better crowds. You will find 300-500 Men and only 10-15 girls and some North East Waitress...Seriously boring... Big time boring...Price rates are like 2JD 60ML will cost you 3200INR, 
Well in short, this club is too much hyped up...Full of men around..Gayish club..

Been there a couple of times ... We usually go on "FinallyFamousFridays" coz of the unlimited booze offer till midnight .. Roxy is the place to be if you are looking for good music all night long along with best of cocktails and certainly if you want to dance the night out... Not the place for foodies though as they have a very limited items on the menu .... Bar menu is extremely good and the bar tender Rishab is extremely charming to know and well mannered ....we ordered black dog,absolute and kamakazi shots along with roasted peanuts and cheese popcorn... Just loved what they served last Friday..also Just love the interiors of the place... Not very doomy not very loud... Vintage decoration with red background... Choice of the music is extremely good to the ear... Although heard Bollywood songs for the very first time this Saturday in Roxy... Dj Rudra along with the guest DJs just kill it ...Last time they didn't allow one of my friends bcoz of open shoes ... Appreciate the discipline ... Although could see too many stags which is alarming...Although the crowd is good.. It costs around 1100 to 1500 per head irrespective of the gender to enter on a Friday and avail unlimited booze n snaks offer ...which is reasonable yet too expensive on other days... It costs us around 6k for 2 drinks each for a couple excluding snacks... Smokes allowed inside ... The innocent looking official photographer is friendly and makes u pose for his clicks ..All n all one of the best night clubs in the city in one of a kind 5 star boutique hotel "the park" !!

The Park that you wanted, it is Roxy!
The place has a pleasant ambience and the interiors are well designed, the attraction of which would be the disc sort of plates on the brick wall.
The food is good too and yes everything has its own costs so this place is expensive.
The good ones are on Friday night, Unlimited beverages for Rs. 1500. So if you want something on an inexpensive side, this isn't a place for you. The dance floors are pretty spacious and there's simply no issue about smoking.

Crowd is different on different days. A lot of stags come. All in all a good place to bring out the night animal in you!

The mandatory Roxy mirror selfie must be taken when you visit this place!

Is a great place to shake a leg.... Not my thing though.... But the music had changed... Heard Hindi songs in there after a long time... Not that it was not pleasing.. Just that it was divergent a few years back.... 
It's a very expensive joint for drinking unless you take one of those all you can do I deals which is quite worth the stuff if one can jug down atleast 6 glasses.

The price usually allows the place to maintain some decorum... Not always... Many riff raffs have too much cash on them.....

I visited the place like two weeks back and I've heard a lot about the place but actually I found the pub to be really small and congested even if you don't want to foot step or fall on someone it's just bound to happen because of the space available, also the crowd was getting weird with time. The drinks served are straight and nice,dj plays well. the manager should put attention on the filtering crowd as its a part of THE PARK!!There is no point getting high with alcohol and music and feeling low after seeing the people around you.

What do i say about Roxy!! Roxy is home.... home is where the heart is they say..
i love how close it is to home and very centrally located.  Blush Thursday's & Wasted Friday's are my favourite nights there. the bar tenders are very friendly though most times it does get a lil too crowded but after afew down one does not mind that much. The dj's always have me dancing the night away. i just cant keep still when i'm there.
 Three cheers to Roxanne and her team for doing the great job that they do!!

This is a nice place to party especially if you're not into drinking since the entry is mostly free. The crowd is pretty decent, as is the music. The ambience is nice as well.

The moment u enter this place u'll b completely sure that this is the coolest place for clubbing in Kolkata ... Went to this Awesome place last Friday n I'm so so sooo in love with the ambience-music-lovely people over there !!!! The upstairs lounge has got some super-comfy sofas n u can have a good view of the DJ n the dance floor downstairs. The music beats are sure to keep u dancing throughout the night .. i mean till the time they r open ;) This place will never disappoint u.

They have an offer of Unlimited Drinks for 1500/- on Wasted Fridays... The crowd over here is pretty good. 

ROXY definitely Rocks !!

The place to part-ay! 

Make sure you are sober enough when the bill kicks in, coz it's surely going to make you wonder at the credit card receipt in the morning. One of the hottest night clubs in the town.

One of the most happening places in Calcutta when it comes to nightclub! This place exists amongst the Tantra and Someplace Else at The Park. A popular joint that stays open till the wee hours. Gets a little crowded on Saturdays but you will somehow manage to squirm between people and dance.. Coming to that the music is good !! 
A big hit for a Saturday night out !

A great pub for drinking and dancing. They have ladies night on Thursday and all drinks are free. :) 
So, definitely a must go for all ladies atleast once on Thursday. But the DJ could be improved. Also, they have a limited variety of stock that day. 
I think the best day for party is Saturday with fun DJ.

Now this is the place for those who want to have some dance beat in the menu. 2 floors of absolute heart pounding music.

If your night has eating as the priority, this ain't the place for you.

One of the best ambiance for a place with the theme. It gets you to get into the groove the moment you enter. The Park has always managed to stay on top when it comes to providing a different environment for different breeds of night lovers.

Place is big, floor's wide, smoking is allowed all the time, music is loud and good, and the bill?? Well, it's high too.. It's not just quite rather very expensive. Just 2 Bacardi pegs would cost you around Rs 2400+. This is The Park we are talking about.

It was just a very quick visit while we had primarily gone to my most favourite place - Someplace Else. The place was good but a tad bit too dark and on that day for some strange reason, it was quite empty as well with very few people enjoying some quiet drinks at the corners while the music was blaring across. I believe its a good place to hangout for the youngsters, have some fun and shake a leg or two if you are not able to gent your entry into Tantra. Enjoy ...

I HEART THIS PLACE! Have been a regular in the year 2013. Reduced my visits considerably due to my busy schedule but whenever I get a chance, I do visit roxy. I always avail the Unlimited Drinks offer on Fridays at 1100rs or the Ladies-Night-Free-Drinks-On-The-House-For-The-Ladies offer on Thursdays. I love everything about this place-from the delicious snacks to the mean drinks to the super comfy sofas on the upper level. The bartender Rishabh is a big hit among the girls for his cute looks and sexy moves in making the right drink for every guest. I don't like the manager after a certain incident where we were first told that it would cost 1500rs for guy's entry and afterwards we returned to avail the offer around 30minutes later, they said 'Today's party is only for The Park's room guests' whereas right in front of me they allowed entry to a group of accquaintances. I really lost my temper at such behaviour. I asked them straight 'are WE allowed or not?' and then they said 'alright the guys pay 1500rs'. Minus this one incident, roxy never disappointed me. The Dj-s belt out a mix of edms from the latest to the oldies. At times they even play bollywood-maybe a song or two. The managers say they don't allow stags. The place gets too crowded on Blush Thursdays, Wasted Fridays and Saturdays. But that doesn't really matter much when all I wanna do is let my hairs down and enjoy with friends. On Thursdays, the bar closes at 11:30pm and we horde our drinks to keep us going till 1am. Oh did I mention they serve us the Green Lays (American) which is my personal favorite? Hehe! Wink! Irrelevant, I know. Anyways the point is, roxy still holds a special place in my heart. From the days I changed dresses in the Park washroom till today, roxy is the place i tell everyone to try and also take all my friends to for one fun club night. Highly Recommended. Cheerie!

I always used to visit this place when in college and then for 4 more years after that . food is good no doubt people were friendly. then i had to move abroad and came back to kolkata after 3 years. to my disbelief  the same place the same people acted as if they don know me and denied entry. the other guys in my group were in kolkata for the first time in their life and it was a nasty experience. the people working there used to share our booze, food and even smokes  and today they got promoted so they don know us. don think i will ever go back. I have been to over 40 countries and even to other cities in india, evrywhere old and regular customers are taken care off but only in my own city they are despised. Oh almost forgot , when told them to take full cover charge or some extra money for security if they think we roudy people... reply was sir u r from out of the country na. ek do hazar dollar de do aur ghus jao . really!!!!

The aura of people serving you and the choker blocked spaces make you feel salubrious. Rishabh and the manager Shibho are two people who amaze tou just by their presence. The dj ofcourse is too hovial. Overall a packer for sat and thursdays......

Good ambience and the most happening night club of Kolkata. The only issue is that on weekends you have barely any place to stand. You are shoved from one to the other. But yet its the favourite of the city. The drinks are costly, as in any nightclub and you barely get a place to sit and eat. But if you ever manage to drop by in the evening when the crowds arent there do try the assortment of non veg kababs. Its good with a long list of kababs served. At that time if u want you can sit and chat and have a good place to talk to friends. But once the clock hits 10pm... then dont even try

Nice place with excellant acoustics and interiors, very good music and popular on weekends. But mondays are not happening and the place looks deserted. If you want to grab a drink you may visit the next door pub someplace else, but on weekends a must visit. Stag entries i think are not allowed. overall its a must visit if you want to go crazy and some nice music.

Music. DJ night. Dance. Lounges. Saturday night with friennds? Great place. Just the prices need to be reduced a bit because it becones too expensive for a regular club going person to pay up all the money for the good food you get there. Second con? The public, seems everyone gets a pass for events at roxy, even people under the age of 15.

well we had some finger food pehle and then took the firday night unlimited offer 1100 per head and went in around 10ish...the crowd started coming in by 1130 and the party went on and on.. !great crowd,proper people...almost everyone befriends each other...and dances together.. ! well you can smoke without the pangs of having to go to the smoking room...,there is a smoking section beside the entry ... and the bartenders...well they fare much btr than the rest of the palces where bartenders usually turn deaf to ppl unless your famous and well knows...so ya... a must visit :) !

Okay, to write about Roxy feels absolutely weird, funny and stupid. I don't even remember most of the times whatever follows after I have been here. Hic. :3 On a serious-ly lighter note, this is one of the best places in town to put one's foot down in the weekend. Company matters everywhere, so does it here and Roxy is no place for solitude, to say the least. I have always been here with my friends and have had a blast. They play a mix of good music, but one literally has to wait for the crazy bollywood numbers into the night (I have a thing for chengra songs). Over several visits, I have utilised the Friday Unlimited offers for 1000 INR, which trust me is an absolute steal. I have not had an opportunity to try any fingerfood here, so will straight move to the showstopper of my weekend.

On my recent visit, we tried the long island iced tea. By no means cheap, it is bound to make you gulp your own pocket even before you have sipped on the drink. But then.. then.. then.. this has to be the best long island iced tea I have had in quite some time. The tall glass, profuse amount of cherries, crushed ice, alcohol and the syrup: the bartender seriously concocts it perfectly (Read: yummy and potent) and makes sure of it being a strong cocktail at that. I must mention that the bartenders are absolutely courteous and were sweet enough to pour me the cherries in a shot glass seeing my fondness for the same. ^_^ 

Roxy is a CRAZY place. It will always be.

I love Roxy. This is definitely my favorite lounge in Kolkata. Been there a few times and have always loved the place. I love the decor and ambiance there. We mostly opted for drinks along with few snacks. There red chicken tikkas and tandoori potatoes are all that I have tasted there. They tasted really good. Been long I have been there last but the name Roxy somehow makes me nostalgic. Recommended.

Roxy happens to be a nice club in Park Hotel and I quite like the ambience. The place is good for some drunken reverie and dancing. What is not good is the fact that it is just too crowded. I like the fact that they have a couple entry system and that they do not allow you in unless you are dressed properly. They have a well-stocked bar and it is fun to dance around among a good crowd. Age bar is not checked here and I also had the bad experience of a drunken girl come and start shouting at me. Thankfully her boyfriend knew she was drunk and dragged her away before she could snatch my beer and my jacket. But overall I would say it is a fun place to visit sometimes!

One of the best lounge in the city. I remember I had Corona for the first time here when it arrived in India. Nice cozy seating arrangements with perfectly lit ambiance. My personal favorite snack is mini parmesan kulcha, it's just awesome with the white sauce. At times smoking is quite suffocating. You will definitely find minors among the crowd. Great place for good music and liquor at a premium price tag.

Only a good Place for School Kids and  collage peeps! If you are a Corporate Civilized Human then sitting at home and having countryside liquor would be a better option...CHEERS!!

Roxy is situated right at the heart of Kolkata and hence is very accessible. My first visit to Roxy was on Christmas eve and naturally I was mesmerized by the buzz around this place and it seemed like all the party animals of Kolkata have descended into Roxy in their BMWs and Mercs.

Overall it is a bit cramped up but the huge screen in the front plays interesting visualizations which set the mood. The choice of music (a mix of party pop, Bolly and occasional rock) is ok and I usually prefer chilling out on the comfy couches upstairs when there is too much crowd on the dance floor. Drinks are usually expensive (though there is an awesome cocktail buffet for Rs. 1500 on some days) and I have observed many people getting drunk cheaply at Olypub etc. before getting in. The crowd inside is usually great. 

Though its not top notch (you can head to Plush or Sheesha for a grander experience) but definitely worth visiting a few times.

PS: If you are a stag and want to get in: Dress well, wear nice shoes, take your iPhone out, go before 10:30PM, speak good English , and you should be able to cajole the bouncers into letting you in :P

I love Roxy!! The moment you step into Roxy ..be it a super-packed Friday Night or dull Tuesday Night...I love Roxy! The drink concocted with just the right ingredients and hospitable staff makes me go back to this watering hole. The choice of music too is good and I like the fact that not for once the tempo goes down..any point on a busy night...DJs know their job....Special mention of Visuals at Roxy these days...The bar area gets suffocated post 11 pm on Fridays and Saturdays but then which bar does not get crowded !! Point is.. a nightclub climbs up the popularity ladder by several notches only after it gets packed with people more than it can capacitate...Anyway...all said and done..Roxy is the best place in Kolkata to chill and party the night away with you folks. Big ups for the guys running the show!! Its a must visit on a Friday...!!

This place is so narrow and cramped  that if a drunk kid vomits they might just puke all over you. Extra emphasis on the word kid is required as management don't check identification of its guest.It is a common fact that kids nowadays either go clubbing against their parents will or sneak out, so roxy provides an additional encouragement. Failure to check ID along with unlimited drinks causes too many hormonal teenagers causing unnecessary fights an pushing around of other guests who just came to have a good time. Moreover smoking should not be allowed in the dance floor as it is very risky in a crowded place like roxy.

I used to visit Roxy often way back in 2007-08 or so and then stopped going there when I realized I was not too pleased with the crowd there. A few days ago, I decided to revisit when friends came to town and we needed to have a nice night out. Four of us went inside Roxy and saw that the scene has changed a good bit. From playing only English music, now they have interspersed it with lots of Hindi music... I could spot old and new faces,and the DJ was nice, but unresponsive to the demands of the crowd. Three separate requests went unnoticed. 

Booze was okay, and its advised to go for an all-you-can-drink offer if you can get it. Cheaper and better. Crowd is okay but too many stags - something that was pretty new and slightly alarming.

Roxy the park. Located in the park hotel. A night club cum disc. Is one of the most famous night party place. I attended roxy for like numerous number of times. You call it 'Friday night=roxy' where you get unlimited drinks on the house for 1000 only couples and stag for members as they stated me. It has a smoking and seating area above after climbing a few stairs and a bar and disc in the general area. 
Coming to the pros and cons
Pros: 1) located at the posh place
2) advertisements in radios , t2 , tv make it even sound a more happening place
3) have a very good ambience and one of the best dj's.
4) bartenders are fast.
5) seating areas is there for people who are tired after dancing

Cons
1) overcrowded at times
2) too much chaos and noisy at times
3) congusted 
4) very small dancing floor 
5) people even smoke in the dance floor at times which should be strictly stopped as proper smoking room is allotted to them for smoking.

So where's the Party tonight.....well I guess the answer would be 'Roxy'. One of the best partying places in Kolkata. The lighting is much better than most lounges and it doesn't hurt your eye. The whole environment is quite addictive and chilled out. The prices aren't very low obviously but quite manageable I feel and not too high. I personally am very impressed by this place though I have heard people complaining. But I guess some people are just never satisfied and that's the biggest problem. 
I rate it 4 and trust me this place won't disappoint you I'm damn sure. Here you get good music, food and boozing facilities are impressive.

Lovely music, good collection of drinks, lovely beautiful crowd - this is one of the best night spots in kolkata. have not tried anything except mini kulcha there as main motive is to enjoy excellent music and drinks - do go and have a feel before deciding yourself.

Roxy.. It is located at the The Park Hotel in Park Street.. One of the more happening lounges in Calcutta. Roxy could easily rank among the best in the city. Indoors are techno-lit, the brick walls and the super comfortable couches that add to an ambiance that rocks big time. The crowd is usually hip, and hot could be the one word for the gyrating audience ;) Coming to the food.. There are not many options for the vegetarians but whatever we had - za'tar  potatoes and parmesan kulchas with the awesome sun dried tomato chutney - was pretty good. They have an event planned out for each day of the week.. But according to me the best are One on One Wednesday and Wasted Fridays - which is a steal at 1000 per person for unlimited drinks including tequila :D
Four stars from me ;)

Roxy is an old favourite ..... my all time favourites are the Mini Parmesan Kulchas which are excellent .... and they make a mean clubsandwich which is not on the menu but they oblige with.... however they take a while to serve so dont go there very hungry especially on crowded weekend evenings as you will have to wait quite a while.... the staff however are very curteous and helpful .... for the drinkers check out thier Friday Nite offers called "Wasted Fridays" !!!!

A place where one can sit, enjoy the music and drinks. Fortunately no cover charges or anything as such and if there are stags esp. in a group, not at  all an issue as their entry policies are simple and  straight  forward. Its best to go lil early in order to get a place upstairs which is most convenient for  pvt gatherings. So if you reserve early you will not be disappointed. 

Food wise, well the menu options have been reduced from before, but still the tit-bits are just good enough and service is prompt, and personalized. Apart from that, everything else is fine and yes its a lounge so be prepared to shell out huge amount and control the intake  of alcohol. 

Roxy on Friday night is good as they have some lucrative offers. So don't forget to call and check  to avail the same. Cheers!
