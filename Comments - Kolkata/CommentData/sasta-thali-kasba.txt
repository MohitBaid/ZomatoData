Ordered chicken pan fried MOMO,kaju kismis pulao,kadai chicken through swiggy...pan fried MOMO was good with solid chicken pieces,I really enjoyed it. Kaju kismis pulao was average Nd most of the kajus were rotten,over fried...I don't like their so called bestseller chicken kadai. It's pathetic,spices are like under cooked Nd dish is laking salt. Really worst it was. But the place is really cheap and pocket friendly,they give food in a good quality.

The place seems to be a affordable one as its name suggesting such. So basically they have compromised with the food as well. Ordered pan fried momo kaju kishmis polao and khadai chicken. Only the pan fried momo is one that satisfied me rest of the others are heavily compromised. Khadai chicken was tasteless and they used some cheap quality of kajus in their polao preparation.

This restaurant dosent deserve even 1 star. Pathetic service.Nothing in menu was available.They said one indian and fish cutlet is available.The fish cutlet served was burnt and tasted yuck.I waited for 1 hr hoping chicken tikka would be fine but to my surprise they forgot about the order. It was not even passed to the kitchen for cooking. When questioned about the situation then nobody could give any concrete answers. Very calous behavior. Irresponsible staffs. To sum up a pathetic experience.

Too much delayed order. They commits that they will deliver within next 20 minutes but it took more that 1 hour. Food quality was not also satisfactory. Packing charges are too high. No GST are applicable but replaced with packing charges.
