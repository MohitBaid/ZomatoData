Worst food ever. The Mexican wrap was a burnt roti and boiled chicken with mayonnaise and ketchup. They even delivered the drink in a plastic bag.

This eatery is capable to compete with premium restaurants on the taste front. Though a small place their passion reflect in the decor that describes the history of their signature dishes. They even hold a separate menu card detailing each and every preparation they cater. Started with cheese balls which was delicious that we ordered another one then Scotch egg equally tasty and then peri peri chicken kiev and at last lobster thermidor. The quantity was more than enough for two and felt hardly any pocket pinch. 
Being highly impressed we gave a second shot and tried chicken ala kiev made little differently from other restaurants but lovely then crispy fried octopus, and chicken stroganoff their signature dish tasty and creamy. Looking forward to visit again for trying other dishes.

A big thank you to Vesselka for making the Christmas Dinner memorable...Meal consisting of Parthian Chicken (a regal delicacy), Turkey platter with cranberry sauce(to be ordered in advance) and lean pork in brown sauce... Meal accompanied by sliders, bacon, potato mash, potato in plum sauce, cheese mushroom and saut√© vegetables..Moreso the owners came personally and became part of family... These special moments mean a lot.. As we bid adieu to 2017..Heres raising a toast to a better brighter 2018 for one and all.. Amen!!
