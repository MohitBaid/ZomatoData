Excellent food....nice services.... Visited lot more restaurant but they serve one most tongue licking delicacies. Rates of food items are justified. Thai pai chicken, Kashmiri pulao , chilli chicken , crispy chicken are very tasty

This place is as well a hidden gem within the deep dark lanes of Baguihati. 
Prepares all types of food. The waiters are not too professional, but are helpful and courteous. 
The place is well maintained, with dim lights and and an aura of silence. 
We ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Makhmali and Schezwan Chicken, which were served well within 10-15 minutes. The dishes were delicious, not overpriced at all and were enough for a single person. The dish which stood out was the Chicken Makhmali, which was served with pretty decorations and tasted very good. 
Would like to visit this place again if I am in Baguihati during evening hours some day and am short of budget.

Located at the narrow lane beside dental clinic Baguiati. Rakshab is a mughlai cum tandoor cum Chinese restaurant. Its not too spacious but the ambiance is comfortable. Its perfect for family dinner or hanging out with friends. Tried chicken biriyani which is good in taste. Quality and quantity both are good and sufficient.
