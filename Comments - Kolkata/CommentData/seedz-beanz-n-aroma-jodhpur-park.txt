Not at all a good place to go. Was once very popular Ong the teenagers, but they never uplifted them over the years. Time passed but they kept on being the same.wont recommend it to anyone.

Very average place. The place is good. But the ambience is not at all good. The food is okay and good place for having reasonable hookah. It is situated near Jodhpur park puja pandal.

A regular sheesha joint in Jodhpur Park. Very basic interior with limited sitting option. Hardly 16 people can accommodate inside but don't worry,  the place remains empty most of the time. Now coming to the most important part - FOOD. Unfortunately almost every item in the menu is unavailable except some coffee, French fries, chicken popcorn etc. I visited this place for atleast 25 times but this same trend continues or rather it's detoriating. Previously some other straters, sandwitch, mocktails were available but now they don't have almost anything. All these rating is only for sheesha which is really good. If you are a sheesha lover, you can sit there for hours alone or with friends. One more thing:  They allow smoking inside as well. So if you are allergic to smoke, avoid this place!

Quite homely and a good place to hang out with friends. Foods are tasty, more tasty is the behavior of the employees. Recently some new drinks are also added to the menu

This place is horrible, do not even think of going here, the staff is ill mannered, they have all items on their menu but none are available ever, I have gone there 8-10 times and never got what I wanted! They just intend to serve you hookah but very cleverly have lot of food options in the menu which they only make available when they dont have any hookah customers sitting in their closed stuffy place!!In fact the person who leads the staff is so rude, that he served noodles to one group just because they took hookah but when we asked him for noodles, he said its not available, even though he served the noodles to the other group 30 minutes after we asked him for the noodles!! They will treat you as shit and these people dont deserve any customers, no wonder the place has become a joke now and looks empty almost always when I pass by through it.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â They are so ill mannered that they will ask you to get up in 10 minutes if they see other customers are waiting for hookah!! We used to have coffee there earlier sometimes because there was no option that time but now there are many options in Jodhpur Park so we dont need to go this crap of a place thankfully anymore!Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â To top it all, when they have no customers, they keep chairs outside and serve coffee to make sales but when they have hookah customers they take all chairs inside and say that coffee is not available!! Unbelievable!! This is just a plan shit hookah bar with a crappy environment and nothing else. Once I asked them to keep chairs outside, they refused to do so even though the chairs were there!!Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Their menu is a hoax they serve what they want and when they want according to their whims and fancies, the way they behave is the worst I have seen in the whole of Calcutta, they keep chairs outside when they want to, they remove when they want to, there was a complaint also filed against them by someone for these reasons! Simply Avoid!

Nice cozy little place tucked away in a back alley of Jodhpur Park. Nice behaved owner and attendants. Menu is short. Tried Sandwiches and coffee. Both were very good. Need to try other items for a more detailed review.

Nice place and very affordable. The ambience could use a little work though. Best for hookah lovers. And the food are quite good. And the staff were friendly too...
