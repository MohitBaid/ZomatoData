I ordered 4 times & they rejected every time. means ðŸ’¯% declination in last 36 days. if you can't deliver order then why did you open your shop???? why order through zomato is open???? close it....
btw, if you order & you are a zomato treat member then you should notice 1 thing....
at the time of check out you will see that you will get pudding worth 125 rupees but in reality they gives 75 rupees very small portion of chocolate pudding. they are cheating with zomato too. if you are giving food worth 75 rupees then write it but writing 125 rupees & giving 75 rupees product z quite unjustified. I use zomato regularly for food ordering, I have never seen restaurant like this which decline your each & every order. even when I was in Mumbai for 4 years, I have never faced issues like this.

Worst restaurant was ever I tried. Can't say anymore. Max of items are not available. Whatever are available was just bad. American chopsy was just horrible. To digest that horrible things ordered a cold drinks. Unfortunately that was also not cold

During the last pujas, our family decided to eat over here, craving Chinese food we thought that this place might satisfy our hunger. But things took a wrong turn. The ambience was ok but the lighting was too dim and the seats were uncomfortable. We ordered few things like manchow soup, fried rice, veg manchurian
They took such a long time to give us the order even though there was not much crowd over there. The food was not flavorful and not up to expectations. The manchow soup was the only thing we ordered that was delicious but the other items were not good. The fried rice was very bland and looked and tasted like plain white rice. The Manchurian was ok but not excellent. The overall experience I think could have been better and I hope this place improves.

Cozy little place in Salt Lake. The server was really cordial
We ordered Chicken Manchow Soup, Bbq chicken. Both their taste was really good. Portions were a little small.
For main course we had Pan fried noodle and Devil's chicken. Â food taste is great.
The ice cream we ordered came half melted. This could have been better.

This restaurant mainly seen for home delivery. When we went for dinner, no one was available for taking our order...when they came after few minutes, we order thai set menu... After a long wait, they serve the food. The taste was nice but lots of vegetables were not properly boiled.... The gravy taste was good...

Well this is a small joint which serves descent Chinese. Chilly Chicken Dry is must have. Other starters are also good,however the main dishes are average compared to the starters and soups. Also the same place also Don Giovanni's.

This is where Don Giovannis used to be and still is. This is another outlet in addition to the old one. They serve chinese, thai, and seafood cuisine. Service is quick. Space is limited. The server was nice to talk to. We had opted for a time between lunch and dinner. Ordered for a seafood coriander soup and chilli mountain chicken. They were okay. Can be a good option for home deliveries.

Gravy chow was better than many famous places

The prices are also readonable a total VFM place

It was just a small area and in a corny zone too. As from the outside it seemed a ok ok place. But inside evn the place is quite tolerable . The ambience is not what we were looking for. Though the food turned out to be good. We had Chinese choopsoye and American baby corn which were good. Though the cost is too much. But if you r looking for a place less occupied you can surely go fr it.

This restaurant is the perfect example of what competition compels someone to do. For those wondering, this is simply an attached wing of the not-so-popular Don Giovanni's and occupies the same space and ground as its parent outlet. The question obviously arises, how is it possible. Well, it seems, the owner or the proprietor to this new venture has simply secluded some of the items from the parent Don Giovanni's menu, added, removed, modified a few according to his/her liking, and put it up separately under a different brand name.

I have been visiting Don Giovanni's since 2003/2004, when the owner of the very house was the sole proprietor here before he gave it up to someone else (Perhaps back to the company). Been coming here since ages now and have always been a huge fan of their products, be it the Non Veg Special Pizza, or Spaghetti Oink Oink or Capo di Capi. Evidently, I have a huge attachment to this place, and inspite of the fact that their employees keeps joining and leaving, there are still one or two remaining who know my face pretty well. There was also a prolonged period of time, when I used to enjoy a flat concession of 20% on my order due to my frequency of the order. However, that privilege of mine came to and end due to one of their supposedly crash of the database and the new staffs not willing to extend the courtesy shown by their predecessors.

Coming specifically to this new outlet, ordered for a Mixed Hakka Noodles and Pan Fried Chilli Chicken, two dishes which I have had here countless number of times. The Noodles was freshly tosses but had too much of oil in it. The toppings was sufficient in quantity but qualitywise they weren't fresh. The Prawns had a weird smell and the chicken too seemed stale.

The Pan Fried Chilli Chicken on the other hand was outrightly disastrous. I don't know what it was, but it was something other than Chilli Chicken. Surprisingly, they have listed three variety of Chilli Chicken one after the other in their starters, and the person managing the outlet himself looked confused when I asked him to differentiate between these three siblings. The Chicken didn't taste bad but was no better than the one of those Chicken preparations which the cook of a shop makes in my local market (In the same BD Block).

Although, the prices has gone down, probably cutting into their profit, it simply does not warrant such a drastic degradation in their quality. Kindly note, I am not someone who had just walked into this place for the first time to try their offerings. I am a regular here, perhaps more than regular, and been so since the year 2003/2004. Its been a 12-13 years long association and it simply pains me to see Don Giovanni's come down to such a level.

Oh! Did I mention that Kung Pao packed the Noodles and the Chicken within a plastic container marked as Don Giovvani's?

The extra 0.5 rating is due to the sheer nostalgia and the affection I hold for this place!
