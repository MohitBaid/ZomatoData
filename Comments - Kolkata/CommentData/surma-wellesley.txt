An economical joint....Sadly the quality of food didn't match the expectation.... The Chinese cuisine served by them is virtually tasteless....They seriously need to step up the ladder so far as the taste of their dishes are concerned.....

In days of yore, Surma was a pleasure to visit for its fresh, crispy South Indian food. There was no better place in that area or the neighbourhood for dosas, vada, idli, bondas, etc. 

So imagine my utter horror when I found recently that the place has become a substandard Chinese food shop. Not worth wasting one's time and money here now.

üëåToday I Have Visited This Place Surma For The 3rd Time. And I Have Ordered 2 Chicken Cheese Rolls But The Chef's Said It Will Take 30 Minutes To Make It And After That The Chef's Said To Me That The Manager Didn't Come That Why We Couldn't Make Chicken Cheese Rolls. After That I Said It's Ok I Understand Your Point. Just In Case I Was Feeling So Hungry That I Ordered 1 Plate Chicken Momo (Steam) For Just Rs. 50/- With Chicken Soup And Chilly Sauce. That Lunch Meal Was So Delicious That I Was Feeling Full.üëç

Chicken Cheese Roll and Chicken Pasta are the items I tried here. Ambience is okayish , place is cramped. Chicken Cheese Roll was just awesome and Chicken Pasta was brilliant as well. 
Overall a good experience.

SURMA is very popular among the office goers as well as college folks in and around the park street area for some nice and filling food in a very affordable rate . They used to have a different look in my earlier visits some years ago as I was very frequently coming here when I used to work in Park Street area . They have made it look very bright and done up very cool from before making use of the limited space it earlier offered , well now it looks pretty proper . There is no seating arrangements and this trend is there for some good years as they cater with all kinds of fast food from Chinese to Indian dishes and its a real thing to watch how people eagerly take their place standing in front of the stand made tables ready before their food arrives.
Well now its a bit changed however the demand is same and in fact increased from before ever since a renovation is done it looks very attractive and clean so standing and eating isn't a problem .
Food takes usually some time as the demand is such but you get quality food here and its served well in nice plates .

WHAT I TRIED HERE OVER THE TIMES --

I occasionally have eaten the Chinese dishes like the Chicken fried rice , Chilli chicken and Chicken Hakka chow and I have always found it to be very good in terms of the pricing and quantity this is a real deal here to feast.
In Indian dishes I have tried the Laccha Paratha with aloo in the mornings and have relished every bit of it from it being crispy and filling as well as the aloo tasting so good makes your morning very refreshing. You even get soft drinks here available here to enjoy with your food so that's a good thing too for a fast food place which is turned into an attractive place now.

Well very few places like these don't get much of fame in the eating scene of Kolkata so definetly check in to this place to check it out .

Location and Description: ¬†Another hopping at the Wellesley for some food paradise.. And i stopped at this near my office. It was in my wishlist from quiet a time.The place is at the most Porsche place near the park street at Wellesley square. Not a very big outlet but it has so many things to offer you.The body : This place provides you with so many Chinese variety (i.e Chowmin, fried rice, chilly chicken, Momo etc) with such a cheap cost and quality. Not expected of such cheap rates at such a Porsche place .¬†

Ambience and staff: The ambiance is nice and clean, no seating arrangement, its mostly like a buffet stand and eat.. You will find this place always crowded. The person sitting at the counter is quick to take the order but very absent minded while taking the money.

Food: I had taken Veg Hakka Chowmin for my first visit at this place as i work in a Marwari firm grrrrrrr. It took for 15 mins ¬†for my parcel to arrive as it was crowdy. When i opened the box the look of the Chowmin said it all.¬†And i was very much satisfied with the food quality and quantity. The chowmin was made really good with all the ingredients very well cooked and it was really worth of my bucks.

QNQ & Prices: The QNQ is good. but somewhere i believe the quantity should be a bit more. Prices are very cheap.

Conclusion : Well my first impression for this place is a Thumps up. Hoping to visit this place again to try something new next time.¬†
And ¬†for all the foody readers this place is recommended..

Another day when i went office without my lunch box.. And due to its first impression last week i again landed at this place with more expectations. This time i went for veg rice as i see many orders it.
Well the place was crowdy as usual.. Service time the same 15 mins... Comparing to the Chowmin i had last time this dish i found to be at the ordinary side. The quantity was not upto the mark according to the price. The rice was also not well made but i has all the ingredients that it requires. Thou it was not bad but i expected more according their standards...

This time there was something new to taste. After looking long and hard on the menu (which i have to take veg only) i thought of eating Szchewan veg Rice this time. When i opened the box it seemed the rice is fried with red potatoes and included colour. But after i put in my mouth the first bite was tasting like chilly. It was "Tikha" in taste. Thou not the best Szchewan rice i will say but it was good. Quantity was very good for a single person and quality is also satisfactory.
