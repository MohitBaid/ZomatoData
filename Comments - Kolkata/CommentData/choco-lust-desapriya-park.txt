Located close to Oudh and The Carmel primary school, I suddenly came across this place one evening without any expectations. I just wanted to pick up a snack. To my surprise, the moment i entered, this place was like a candy land, such pretty cakes, cookies, pastries and cupcakes. Customised and innovatively decorated.
Its a veg eatery though.
Tasted the paneer, mushroom puff and the Rainbow Cake.
The Rainbow cake!
It has be one of the beat rainbow cakes I've ever had in Kolkata. I can vouch on that!
so well made and priced so cheap
This place has such amazing eatable little boxes of goodies to gift your loved ones.
The only drawback being that there are no seating arrangement.

Now here is a place where you can indulge in choco opulence. Located in a narrow lane and a recluse neighbourhood near Deshapriya Park, Choco Lust was really an amazing experience. This oh so chewy and cholocaty chocochip mousse is an alluring stuff. It has been prepared with love and emotion so that you can devour the entire delicacy, yes even the spoon too! I brought home some incredibly crafted assorted chocolate tarts and nutty delights. The decor is very appealing.
The lady at the counter was busy meticulously explaining the design of a customised cake. It is rarely seen in today's shops. They are often reluctant to spend an extra word.
Highly Recommend!!!

Ordered a number of items through an online delivery app. Delivery was quick and hassle free. Packing was impressive.
 
Try the Chocolate cupcakes, Chocolate tarts, Crunch & Nut cup and Chocochip mousse. All these items taste really good!

The red velvet cupcake was slightly sour but I am sure that was a one off incident. 

Recommended!

Ordered online through ¬†Swiggy. I ordered the chocochip mousse, chocolate cone, and chocolate tarts. I liked the chocolate cone, and tarts a lot. However, got a truffle pastry instead of the mousse. I didn't like the pastry, so won't repeat that. Def liked the cone. Was smaller than implied through the images.

Choco Lust came to my attention when I was searching for desserts in Zomato. The menu seemed great and trust me it was difficult what to order and what not to. Anyhow I settled for these: chocolate praline pastry, butter scotch pastry, pyramid pastry, blueberry pastry, truffle pastry, chocolate cone and a mushroom puff. I got a call from Choco Lust, they told blueberry pastry not available, so I told them to give me two chocolate praline instead. The delivery was made within the stipulated time. The packaging was good as the pastries were still intact. All of the pastries were good, but the chocolate cone and chocolate praline stole the show. The mushroom puff was delicious with a crispy and flaky puff and a delicious filling. Overall it was a great experience with Choco Lust.

I came to know about this shop through zomato only. It was my son's 1st month bday n it was Tuesday, we are looking for veg pastry shop to get a cupcake for my lil one. Its near to my place located opposite to oudh 1590. My hubby went there n got 2 red velvet cupcakes n a chocolate mousse. 
Chocolate mousse was served in a chocolate cup with a chocolate spoon instead of regular plastic cup n spoon. Innovative idea. Tastes superb

Red velvet cupcake wth vanilla frosting tastes good. But too much of red color is being used .aftr eating fingers turned red.

Post lunch at Oudh, we thought of trying this out. Now this place is totally opposite to Oudh..
This place was a combination of krazy for chocolates and swissyum. Both in kasba. 
The idea of chocolate cone, mousse, red velvet were all similar to the former ones.. we had this strawberry pastry. Nothing extraordinary but costly. 
I hope they come up with variations further more. Good for a one time visit though.

Innovative and decently priced.I also came across some amazing looking custom made birthday cakes in this place. Tried the chocolate pyramid on my first visit, and will try the chocolate cone on my next visit. However, the hand made chocolates seem to be overpriced.

This place was a surprising discovery while walking from Desapriya park to Lake Market. It is located near Carmel school. I thought that maybe the shop was new but was amazed to learn that it has been around for over two and a half years. It is a good Bakery with a variety of breads, cookies, chocolates,pastries, cup cakes, mousse and also savouries like puffs and patties.All their items looked tempting and fresh.They also make customised cakes on order and will design according to our specification. A great find, items tasted good and will definitely go back for more.

Food: Nice, looks very nice. Tastes also. Fresh too. We ordered sandwich, chocolate cone and one more item which has chocolate made spoon and bowels.
Rating: 3/5

Service: It was prompt. We ordered in three times that makes them impatient. A little bit smile in their face could make things good.
Rating: 2.5/5

VFM: It was as like as any other shops of this kind. Rs 250-300 for two is kind of ok.

I wanted to give a rating of 5, but some reviews I read about staff not allowing photographs to be taken....... thats pretty dumb if you ask me. If one had to copy your products, he/she could simply buy them once(investment) , take it home and find out recipe or how its made and so on........ whats the big secret. I had noticed once, the snobbish attitude or the owner or the head-chef ........ But i ignore,d but now it seems, its becoming distasteful. I often go there as its a 1 min walk from my work place, but it seems, I must start avoiding it, unless, they get their business aptitude right. If they really believe their products are very innovative, they shouldn't worry about being copied, but rather should count on their innovative skills, that they will always come up with something new and stay ahead of the peers. But Customer is Laksmi, and in any business , behaviour is the key, I dont know how they can ignore the most important aspect of a shop.¬†

FOOD : But here, I will say this, the food is top-quality, might seem over priced but its because its egg less... and egg less pastry product costs more always. But every item is top - notch. Their chocolates and pastries are one of the best in town only to be beaten by Flurry's and may be some Top-restaurant deserts.¬†

I really Wish, they look into the area of Customer Management and not allowing photographs is ridiculous. If you are good, believe in your talents, ... its like playing music, somebody can play a beethoven piece, but cant play it like beethoven because, its the person that gets translated into music, or food, so to speak.¬†

Good Luck!

Situated just beside Carmel High and opposite Oudh, this outlet sells pastries of a boutique's taste at reasonable prices. 
The pictures below speak for themselves.
The blackforest and pineapple pastry was adequately juicy, perhaps a little more sweet would take it a step further towards perfection. I really liked this place. The choco cup and choco cone are really wonderful.

That's the highest rating I could possibly give to this place, really. Very rarely have I seen any management behaving in such an impolite fashion with customers. 
A photographer accompanying our group was asked to show the pictures he took not once, but twice, that too in the rudest possible manner. 
But yes, the rating is also with regard to its food, not just their behaviour. The chocolates were very ordinary, if not below par. Never going back to this place again.

This place gets a bad rating from me not only for the food but also for the disgusting behaviour by the management. 

It was chocolate day and we were in the mood of having some chocolates. Seeing good reviews for this place, we decided to taste some chocolates here. As we started clicking pics inside, a lady came up and told us very rudely that we aren't allowed to click pics inside as according to her this place is one of the top bakeries in the city. But none of their creations seemed worthy of that level. She started checking the camera of my fellow foodie to verify if we haven't clicked any pics of their so called cakes. Another young lady appeared and RE-checked the cam to assure it. We felt insulted at this but also laughed at their silly mindset ! 

Coming to the food, we ordered some flavoured chocolates and lollipops. And they were simply average! The mango flavoured one had a layer of am shotto. The strawberry one looked red but tasted just the same as the mango one. The lollipops were bland. Overall, none of the chocolates were of that level which they proudly boast of !

This place was an utter dissappointment for me more because of the rudeness of the staff than the deserts..

We went on chocolate day to sample their menu...the staff told us very rudely infact to not take photographs because according to them their cake designs were unique..But none of their cake or chocolate designs were close to being unique(Also,they should have this much common sense that people can Google cake designs and not need to copy from them-we get better cake designs in Google then their shop!!!)

Coming to food,we basically sampled a few chocolates and some chocolate lollipops..They tasted very average..seemed a bit bland...

They had a mango bite...which basically tasted of Aam shotto....

This place has a long way to go before developing such attitude!!!

Cute little place right next to Oudh.

The owner is extremly friendly and more than willing to help you make the right 'dessert choice'.

Their cupckes are soft and brilliantly moist.
Their mousse are worth drooling over :D
I love their assorted chocolates too!!

But the best item in their menu, according to me, is their chocolate mousse and brownie cone (not sure if its actual name though).

This is a must try for all the sweet-tooth people out there.

Oh . for the Veg people; good news; Chocolust is Pure Veg :)

It was Heavy as well as Heaven. Don't know how they able to make an eggless cake with such softness but I guess they know how to bake. Apart from that I tried many other things there like Moose cake & Mango minis and people are very friendly over there and my City's last tryout on Food went really well.

The patisserie has quite the repertoire. Surprisingly, the red velvet cupcake was quite good. Unlike most places that just concentrate on the color, this place nailed the flavor which I thought was very impressive. The only criticism I have is that the frosting could have been a little better. Otherwise no issues whatsoever. Also brownie points to the place for ensuring that all their products are egg free giving vegans the opportunity to have some amazing desserts. I look forward to visiting the place in order to satisfy my sweet tooth.

So, this place is a little treasure when it comes to pastries and cakes and chocolates. 
Situated close to banana leaf, this place serves items which are freshly made in their bakery which is attached to the shop. The pastries are very cutely decorated and they taste well too. I had tried their chocolate mouse, which is contained in a chocolate bowl and has a small chocolate spoon on it's top. Their chocolate lollipops doesn't only look good, but they also have a hint of dark chocolate and tastes really good. A very pocket friendly place to visit. Surely gonna visit this place again.

I entered this place when they had closed and was almost shooed away. But I requested for being allowed to take something away and they finally agreed. After liking how everything here looked, I settled for a Pan (betel leaf) flavoured chocolate which cost Rs 25. The chocolate tasted like a medley of pan (betel leaf) and mukhwas (indian mouth freshener). Pretty good overall.

Will definitely give this place a try once more!

If you don't want to face much trouble finding this place, reach Banana Leaf which can be easily spotted, take a left and walk for 2 mins, here you are.!

I spotted this place on my way to Oudh 1590, and visited as I was waiting for Oudh to open for the day.!
This outlet looked very attractive from the outside, for all the colourful pastries on the counter, and so it was in the inside too, there were more..chocolates, cookies, cakes, pastries, patties & puffs, etc.

We had Blueberry Pastry, it was very very tasty, I've always had Blueberry muffin or Blueberry Cheesecake, but this was something different, so I even took some home and everyone else liked it.!

Red Velvet was very nice looking, but was not up to the mark, it did not taste very good, and was not even soft.!

Mushroom Puff was nice, Veg Pizza was a disaster.!

The experience was good, some items were good, some were not, but I'm surely visiting again for that Blueberry pastry.!

Need to focus on customer service big time!! Honestly I will never want to vist this place again.
1. I bought a pastry couple of days back, it was stale...totally stale. Also, I had bought it during the so called happy hours..the bill with the discounted rate amounted to 57 inr. However,  they refused to give the discount when I offered them 60 bucks coz they did not have 3 rupees change to spare. So, I had to pay the full amount 75 to be exact and had to let go of the discount. 
2. The second incident happened today, just when I decided to let go of what I had experienced in the past,  I was there again to make mother's day a little special for my mom. So I got 2 red velvet cupcakes. Guys, I have no words to explain what I felt when I had my first bite. Forget momz, they are overwhelmed only with the attention they get, however despite all the love n admiration she had for my little surprise she had to throw half of the cake coz it was miserable.  Total@ly stale, sour cream, n the cake was as hard as a stone. 
Honestly,  I feel like suing them. But that would be a little too much. So I chose to share what I experienced, so that you guys can be careful when you go there to have a sweet bite.
Thanks!!!

It is a new addition to the dessert scene in Kolkata. And I am glad they have arrived. The prices may appear a little towards the higher side when we walk into the shop for the first time. But once we know what we paid for most of us will not regret shelling the extra bucks. Double thumbs up to choco lust.

Discovered this place on my way towards "Oudh". It looked quite promising from the outside, hence dropping in was just inevitable. After entering the joint, the colorful and bright environment with lucrative and mouth watering pastries all around completely delivered to my expectation. 
They had a wide variety of delightful pastries, cakes, chocolates, mousses, cheesecakes etc,. everything offered here are completely eggless hence an added bonus for the vegetarians. Their collection had a vivid resemblance with "krazy for chocolates", be it the miniature chocolate Ferraris, chocolate nameplates, chocolate cones and all(at least it occurred to me). 
I tried out the "praline pastry", "pineapple pastry" and "mango mousse" and each of the items tasted heaven.
Everything had a perfect balance of sweetness, smooth and cheesy base which completely melts into your mouth leaving an everlasting effect. 
They also offer customized cookies, shortbreads, chocolate candies etc which looked very promising and worth giving a try. The prices are marked on the average side and after trying out their offerings i would say it is justifiable.
Definitely a more than satisfying first visit and of course a place to revisit uncountable number of times.
An unique outlet and one of its kind offering completely eggless products in the nearby locality and has more than enough potential to satisfy the foodies with sweet tooth in town.

Located adjacent to Carmel Primary School, I was really glad they opened a bakery so close to my house. I visited this place umpteen number of times and almost always enjoyed their stuff. Be it their blueberry mousse cake or a chocolate pastry or a crunchy nut pastry or a truffle pastry, I always found the quality up to the mark. But then again I do find their handmade chocolates and cookies a little overpriced. anyhow a nice place to make my sweet tooth very happy.

Improve the service please. Ate a praline pastry in the morning and absolutely loved it. Came back to order a dozen for a party and later found out they had given something else. Obviously not intentional, but unprofessional nevertheless

Slightly overpriced considering its brand & quality. But products are of great variety and most importantly for many, eggless. They do accept special orders and their variety of creations are much appreciated.

It has recently opened up so let time alone tell how well it'll serve.

I have had an awful experience of this place. We were served a stale pudding. They surely need to focus on Customer Health & Hygiene. The place carries a nice ambience though.
