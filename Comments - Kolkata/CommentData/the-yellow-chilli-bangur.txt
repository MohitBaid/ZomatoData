That’s the water they serve. Food is below average. The staff has no clue about what their menu says and the captain is down right stupid not arrogant. Just stupid in the way he talks. Extremely disappointed

First of all I would mention the obvious, i.e. it is a pure veg restaurant and this is really a calm fine dining restaurant. I visited this place with my family. The ambience is very calm and peaceful, and a suitable place for families to hang out. 
Next I would like to come to the food. We ordered Kashmiri Pulao, Kadhai Paneer, Butter Naan, Lalla Mussa Dal to suit our tastes. I must say, the Pulao is a must try, it can be said it was one of the best dish over there. Kadhai Paneer was decent. Butter Naan was was good. And the dal tasted really nice. One thing I must say is everything was fresh and the pulao was specifically enriched with ghee, which I personally liked. Lastly I would say, this is a great spot for the vegetarians. Pocket pinch is quite okay compared to the quality. I personally liked the place.

We were here for a birthday dinner with the entire family of 18 people and had ordered paneer tikka followed by kaalidal, chana masala, kadai paneer and biryani. The taste of the food was fantastic. But the virgin mojito was very disappointing. Also, the thumps up given was without fizz. The service was really slow. After saying repeated number of times also, the service remained slow. All in all the food was yummy but the service spoiled the dinner.

Out from the numerous vegetarian treasures.. My recent hunt was on this restaurant day before yesterday. Located just on the Bangur Avenue Bus Stop on the main Jessore Road towards Nagerbazar, The outlet can be understood as the potrait of the World Famous Chef Mr. Sanjeev Kapoor is being displayed externally. Inspired from Mr. Kapoor, This Restaurant serves its own mouth watering style vegeterian dishes. Planned to have lunch there, I am my friends went there to the 5th Floor where the Restaurant is actually and the exterior is still being constructed to have better outfits in future. As soon as we entered the Restaurant Premises, the Receptionist welcomed us with a gesture and we were offered a big table for the huge group of us. The quite soothing chilled ac and the huge spacious dine-in hall with beautifully decorated interiors and maintaining extraordinary cleanliness and hygiene offering a beautiful view of the entire roadside scene was totally a delight to see and experience it. Served with a variety of options to select from vegeteraian menu, we chose to fixed some interesting items to licker our taste buds for our group lunch.
Served within quite a few moments.. We were highlighted with their drinks menu at first to quench our thirst and gobble up our appetite :
* Lemon Lassi : A superb smoothie type lassi basically made out of fresh curd, some pistachios and a tinge of lime flavour that added uniqueness to its taste.
* Kiwi Mojito : A spectacular tangy treat of refreshing drink that sums up with chilled ice cubes and fresh mint leaves.
* Virgin Mojito : An amazing and one of the refreshing and superb mojitos that I have ever had. A purely mint flavoured with ice cubes with lemon soda water adding flavours to the appetite.
* Sunset Island : A totally uniquely decorated and mixed fruity flavoured juicy drink that will catch your attention both because of its taste and looks.
Next Came in the mouth watering Starters and Main Course items which were truely a blend in the amazing taste of vegeterian dishes :
* Tandoori Aloo Posto : This item is facinated by the cooking of potatoes in Tandoori style and served with toppings of poppy seeds (posto) and was a taste bud utilizer.
* Shabhnam ke Moti : A surprising mushroom based starter sauthed with vegetables and spices for a tender soft filling inside which attracts your tummy.
* Harippa Paneer Tikka : A spicy garnished and cooked in tikka style soft and succulent tender paneer item served with lettuce and onion dipped in mayonnaise that gives an extraoridinary flavours no less than non veg starters.
* Nimbu Mirch Baby Corn Sticks : A superb crunchy and crispy babycorn sticks fried in deep oil and flavoured with fennel seeds and seasoned with lemon and red chillis that was something worth a taste.
* Makai Creamy Kaaju Tikki : A superb mouth watering starter to gobble up the freshly baked kaaju tikkis filled with delicious stuffings and cashewnuts along with some mild spices flavouring the tinge of starters was totally worth money.
* Shaam Savera : A perpetual cottage cheese and spinach koftas main course item that was one of the unique tasty dish in the main course.
* Lalla Mussa Daal : A serial grains item basically prepared with tadka daal and rajma flavoured item cooked in thick gravy and ghee.
* Jannat e Numa : A gravy based potato dish more or less similar like the tandoori potato style flavour.
* Anjeeri Gutta Curry : Another of the vegetable based dish cooked with tangy flavoured rich gravy and kofta balls to sum up your dish.
* Gadbad Pulao : An absoloutely taste smacking rice item to have blend of pickles, vegetables and mixed spices to gobble up your taste buds.
* Mumbai Mast Tomato Pulao : This was one of the best ever rice dishes that I have ever had and it was served beautifully garnished with a flowerly cut tomatoes to have added the effect. The taste was amazing as it was neither too spicy nor too oily but a perfect schezwan style flavouring made it worth money. This is one of the most widely eaten street foods of Mumbai.
* Aloo Anardana Kulcha : A mildly flavoured stuffed kulcha filled with potatoes mashed with pomegranate seed extract that added an unique flavour to the kulcha and was worth tasting it.
* Churchur Roti : A Perfect Tandoori style baked Roti brushed with ghee and crispy to taste was a good platter to sum up the main course.
Gradually as we were filled up, the last came in the desserts which was surely worth something all together to conclude our lunch :

* Gulaab e Gulkhand : A sweet dessert made out of gulab jamun and was quite impressive.
* Chocolate Chip Kulfi : This was the best dessert out of the anything which we had. It tasted awesome as the flavours of milk and chocolate sublimed in our mouth with the extra flavours of chocolate chips that was surely a taste vitalizer to us.
* Chocolate Chilli Fruit Sundae : A totally mixed smoothie type sundae filled with flavouring creams and a tinge of hot chillis along with fruity sweetness was something unique which we had.

So summing up all these food items in this outlet was surely a very good experience and especially the courteous staffs and their Master Chef & the Manager of the restaurant were so humble to have shared us their good vibes and hence I would personally recommend everyone to give this outlet a tryout soon..!!

The most popular brand from Sanjeev Kapoor Restaurants, The Yellow Chilli represents Indian food in all its eccentricity and diversity. The Yellow Chilli provides a veritable gastronomic tour of India with destinations that showcase the quintessential dishes of each region, with exotic picks from the regions of Punjab and the Mughal Era.

It is a blissful pure vegetarian destination located conveniently at Bangur crossing, above CCD. The place is spacious enough to accommodate 60+ souls at a go. The restaurant is well lit and furnished with delightful interiors. Being a SK chain restaurant, even though with traditional cuisines, many dishes have been innovated uniquely.

Starting off with the drinks, we had Lemon Lassi, Virgin Mojito and Sunset Island. The two mocktails were thoroughly refreshing and the lassi had a nice twist to it.

For starters we had, Tandoori Aloo Posto, Shahnam Ke Moti [ amazing mushrooms ], Harippa Paneer Tikka, Nimbu Mirch Babycorn Sticks and Makai Creamy Kaju Tikki. I personally preferred the Kaju Tikki due to its richness and royal flavour.

Our main course order included, Shaam Savera [ their signature dish of spinach koftas filled with creamed cottage cheese and served floating on a velvety tomato butter gravy ], Lalla Mussa Dal, Jannat - E - Numa, Anjeeri Gatta Curry [ really authentic and full of flavours ].
They also serve amazing pulaos here. We tried Gadbad Mirchi Pulao and Mumbai Mast Tomato Pulao. Must say that both had their distinct flavours and will surely leave a mark on your hearts.

Ending our luncheon with some desserts we had, Chocolate Chip Kulfi [ best in town ] and Gulab - E - Gulkand. Also had Chocolate Chilli Fruit Sundae which was a subtle mix sweet and spice.

As expected, the service was fluent and proved to be a hallmark of efficiency.

There are very few impressive vegetarian restaurant in the city,The Yellow Chilli is one of them.Located in Bangur Avenue this place used to serve a large variety of food items.

In starter,Harippa Paneer Tikka was marvelous ,highly recommended dish of them.Tandoori Aloo Posto was enjoyable.One should try their Shabnam Ke Moti,it's different and delicious.Neembu Mirch Babycorn Sticks were served hot and it was just wow,another highly recommended of them.

In drinks,Lemon Lassi and Sunset Island were wonderful.Virgin Mojito Ws there.But Kiwi Mojito was just over the top,it's one of the best,one can't give it a miss.

Shaam Savera was tasteful in main.Lalla Mussa Dal was enjoyable with Aloo Anardana Kulcha.Chur chur roti was also good.The main course I liked most is Jannat e Numa,highly recommended again of them,You can try it with Mumbai mast tomato pulao,pulao was also over the top,one just can't give it a miss.One of their key item is Jadbad Mirchi Pulao,flavourful and savory with the twisted mix of achaar.

Chocolate chip kulfi was yummy and excellent in the dessert.It's one of their best.Gulab e gulkand was the appropriate choice for the sweet lovers,toothsome.Chocolate Chilli Fruit Sundae was delightful too.

Ambience was pleasant,one can enjoy the outskirts view of the city from there.If you want to have delish and delectable tasty veg food The Yellow Chilli is the most suitable choice.Go for it.

If vegetarian cuisine is this good, then I'm ready to give up non-veg food once in a while and gorge on the lovely dishes that The Yellow Chilli serves. They have a huge and spacious sitting area with large glass windows overlooking the main road. The lighting of the place enhances the ambience further. Coming to food, I had : 

1. Lemon Lassi : The all time favorite Lassi with a punch of lime juice. This was a refreshing start to the meal.

2. Kiwi mojito : My favourite beverage of the day. It was perfect and both the mint and the sugar was well balanced.

3. Tandoori Aloo Posto : The name fascinated me and the dish was even better. Tandoori potatoes with a tasty filling makes up for the quirkiest starter.

4. Makai creamy kaaju tikki : I can't describe this dish enough. It was my favorite. I can probably travel all the way from South Kolkata to this place just for this one starter. Soft delicious kaaju tikki that melts inside your mouth tickling every taste bud.

5. Shaam Savera : Cottage cheese and spinach koftas in a rich gravy. This was heavenly in taste!

6. Jannat-e-numa : A potato based main course. The potatoes were similar to the tandoori Aloo starters. It was tossed in a green gravy.

7. Mumbai mast tomato pulao : The famous tomato pulao from the streets of Mumbai. It was really nice and the quantity was amazing! 

8. Choco Chip kulfi : BEST KULFI EVER. The taste of Malai and chocolate together made it so satisfying for both the stomach and the heart.

9. Chocolate chilli fruit sundae : The sweetness was mild and the taste was brilliant. The presentation deserves a special mention.

Well being a hardcore non-vegan i expected pretty less from this joint.
My taste buds did go for a roller coaster ride all the while i was here.
Stationed at Bangur Avenue junction, this place offers a varied range of vegetarian dishes.
Well the mentionables ones include:
Harippa Paneer Tikia, Makai kaju tikki,Mirch Pulao.
The desserts here will set you drooling.
The best part was having em.
Chocolate chilli fruit sundae , Gulab e Gulkand and Chocolate chip kulfi.
The desserts here will just not let me stay away from this place for long.
More than anything the presentation is amazing.
Well this hardcore vegan has just fallen for this vegan joint.
The ambience, the staff every service is top notch.
The names of the dishes will just spicy up your mind.
I would definetly recomend this place for one and all.
This place definetly gets a 'Must try' tag.

Located at Bangur , this vegetarian restaurant absolutely took away a hard-core non-vegetarian's heart. The Indian spread is set to impress everyone out there. Few of my personal favourites were : 
*Virgin Mojito : One of the most common mocktails but hands down the most fresh mojito I've ever tasted. 
*Sunset : A beautiful mocktail. 
Starters : 
*Harippa Paneer Tikka : Soft and lipsmacking Paneer Tikka serves with onions and chatni 
*Shabnam ki moti : Mushroom kebabs. 
*Tandoori Aloo Posto : Tandoori Aloo stuffed in the centre served like rings. 
The Main course :
*Lalli Mussa Dal : Creamy Kali dal
*Anjeeri Ghatta : Traditional Gatte ki sabzi in a tomato gravy  
*Chirchir roti and Aloo parantha were my favourite accomplaiments. 
Special mention goes to their Tomato Pulao (Mumbai style ) and Mirch ka pulao. 
Desserts : 
They undoubtedly serve the best kulfi in town. Along with that I also loved the Gulab pasand which was a big gulab jamun! 

Overall I had an amazing experience , from ambience to service to food!  Cheers !

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian I  like some of the vegetarian food. .This place attracts mostly the family crowd because of its brand name(Sanjeev Kapoor).

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian I  like some of the vegetarian food. “The Yellow Chili” is a pure vegetarian joint which serves authentic & traditional vegetarian Mughlai and North Indian food. This vegetarian restaurant is initiated by Chef. Sanjeev Kapoor which is located at Bangur Avenue, Jessore Road, Kolkata.

This place can easily accommodate around 100 heads at a time. Apart from this, they have a banquet too.

They served us various 2 Starteres, and two Signature Dishes with Kulcha and Nan respectively..And the worst part of my life comes when someone asks me to taste VEG BIRIYANI. No, actually, being a Non-Vegeterian it's like an offense if someone asks me to taste that. I mean I can't think a plate of biriyani without bones.. Jokes apart, somehow I liked the Biriyani.

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian i do like varieties of vegetarian foods.vegetarian cuisine is based on food that meets vegetarian standers by not including meat or animal tissue products. but such as dairy products milk & cheese are permitted. “The Yellow Chili” is a pure vegetarian joint which serves authentic & traditional vegetarian foods. this vegetarian restaurant is initiated by none other than famous Chef. Sanjeev Kapoor. located in 48/8 Bangur Avenue in Bangur Area.this place is huge,very much spacious,can easily accommodate around 90-95 people at a time.apart from that there is a another separate section which also can accommodate a big crowd. i and my fellow foodie friends are invited there over a food tasting session.

We ordered variety of breads, panchmel dal, anglo jhalfrezi, some drinks and paneer tikka (Dish names might be slightly different).  Food was good but not excellent, service was okay but not great because they dint know what they were serving. They also presented the wrong amount in the bill. Being not so cheap restaurant, food and service has to be awesome. The entrance is also not very nice. JW Kitchen is only slightly expensive than this, so why not go there instead.

A completely veg restaurant initiated by Chef. Sanjeev Kapoor. Now the vegetarians can have fun too!! :)
Location is good. Easy to find.
According to me food was good but not the best. We ordered some Bengali dishes which was quite decent.
Price was little on higher side, but the experience won't make you disappoint.
Interior and ambience was pretty cool and classy.
Delivery was slow may be because we were the first customers of that day!

I am a frequent visitor of this place. There are two reasons for this ,one the place is near by and the other is this is one of my favourite restaurant for veg north indian flavoured food. I love there missi roti and some of chef Sanjeev Kapoor's signature dishes. 
Last time on women's day i visited this place along with a friend. They were serving maharaja thali which had almost everything including drinks and dessert. Food was as usual good and of course my favourite missi roti was perfect in taste. 
The staff also is very humble and courteous.

This Place can do no wrong!. The Yellow Chilli has been here like ... five years?, is the third time I visit it and this one just was the best!. Three Irish guys, an American gentleman, a Latvian Boy   and my humble self where there for a treat and were treated like Kings and Queen! The food of this place is amazing and the attention is superb. We had literally a feast!  but the signature dish that blown my mind was Shaam Savera, we literally got the chef to come out from the Kitchen so we could compliment and ask him about this wonder of the world.  I did forget the name of our maitre, but I do remember he said he is from Mayapur,  a very humble, sweet and expert on his job. 

The Yellow Chilli, is placed in a non so easy spot in Bangur Avenue, not so easy in terms of the area, but definitely looks like a crown of the place, almost on the top of this building, making the restaurant an oasis, a shelter from the chaos, with its excellent view, and wide spaces. Keep it up, is just go from good to great every time.

When it's veg it's yellow chilli and who says one doesn't have varieties in vegetarian dishes?!!
The menu had all sorts of kebabs and tikkas which non vegetarians cannot even think that exists.
Had ordered veg platter and the taste of vegetables paneer, mushrooms everything was mesmerising and perfectly cooked. Paneer melted like butter in mouth. Even the presentation of the dishes was good. For main course had ordered kathal ki biriyani which is their speciality. Though the taste was good but felt the jackfruit wasn't cooked and boiled properly but the Quantity was enough for two people. Gulaab gulkand dessert was the cherry on the top. 
A bit costly if compared according to the amount served but the asweome taste balances it all.
Overall it's a must try out place.

This place attracts mostly the family crowd because of its brand name(Sanjeev Kapoor). Nevertheless i went to this place with my family . The staff was eager to provide us with their special thali "Maharaja Bhoj" offer that was prevailing then. With no decent options we opted for that . It costed around 600/- each which was no doubt hard for the pockets. They started with sweet corn soup followed by pani puri whose water seemed to be sheer chilli juice. Then came anardana chat, kebab platter and nachos. Nachos was good, kebabs were delicious but the anardana chaat did not had a single anardana and dint taste good at all. They provided the main course which was decent and on request they made it with "no-onion-and-no-garlic". The main course was filling and appreciable. Only that the service was technically not poor but slow. They served us with gulab jamun which was tasty and ended with paan which was surely been made by the paanwala near them. Overall it was fun experiencing the Maharaja Bhoj and i am looking forward to such buffets here. :)

Yellow Chilli a Sanjeev Kapoor restaurant in kolkata located at the crossing of  Jessore road Bangur avenue.

It is a pure veg restaurant and amazing taste 

Soups
Sweet Corn Soup normal nothing great
Nimbu Dhanya  Soup more of a clear soup with Lemons and pieces of Coriander
Kali Mirch Palak Shorba was good 

For Starters we had Hare Masala ka Bhuna Paneer (Green Paneer Tikka) signature dish, Paneer Masala Papad, Nimbuwale Babycorn with mix grill in which you get tandoori  paneer tikka Sheekh kabab, Stuffed Mushroom and  Dahi Tiki and onion marinated in cream that onion is awesome . Paneer Masala Papad was not as expected and had to be changed. They had stuffed very less of paneer and more of salads. The mix grill was awesome specially the stuffed Mushrooms. The platter consist of 7 items of 4 pieces for a serving of 4 person.

Then comes the main course 

Shyam Savera great taste and it is signature item

Dal Makhani excellant taste 
Yellow Dal Takda was also good with Zeera Rice.
Pyaz Mirchi ki Roti very mild in chillies as well as onions 
Tandoori Roti were crispy and perfect.
And the desert 

Chocolate chip kulfi with Chocolate sauce is the white choclate kulfi with choco chip and chocolate sauce  delicious but not smooth it was icy.
Chocolate Chilli Fruit Sundae just like a Tutti Fruity with Sliced Green Chilli on top in place of cherry.
Zauk e Shahi Gulabjamuns with milk sauce and crispy breads was ok
Kesar Pista Kulfi with Rabdi was good.

Overall a  very good ambiance and good in taste.
Will surely go back

We ordered home delivery. For 2 dishes 2 plate each and it came in 1 hour and 45 minutes. The quantity is too little that it can serve hardly 4 people. Also the caller person was very rude. Even if it tastes good it's not value for money at all nor is it worth for such a long wait.

The ambience of the place was awesome... though the entry from the back side of the building was little weird... went their long time ago for having some mocktails n desserts... we ordered for...
◆ Peru pyala~ It was one of their signature drink... ordered with great expectations... but it failed to fulfill it... not good...
◆ Masala mint cooler~ It was also their signature one... and it should be...
◆ Blue lagoon~ It was very good n refreshing...
In desserts we had...
◆ Gulab a gulkand~ Basically it was a pan masala stuffed gulabjamun... tasted insane... but we expected the quantity being little more...
Overall a good experience... staffs are courteous... service was fast too... pocket pinch was bit high...

Loved their ' Maharaja Thali ' , which was reasonable and delicious. Malai Kofta, Shabnam ke moti , masala mint cooler , paneer taka tak, dal makkhani were delectable. A must try for veg lovers like me.

Being a non vegetarian, it is not an easy decision to visit a vegetarian restaurant but I must admit it is worth a visit. We were intrigued to visit this place because it is associated with the famous chef Sanjeev Kapoor. At first we ordered the masala mint cooler for drinks. It tasted a bit too sweet and minty . For starters , we tried the 'shabnam ke moti' - this is made of mushroom and served with a variety of chutneys. Let me just say that it tasted awesome with the right amount of spicy and sweet . For main course we took lasuni naan alongwith ' shahi malai kofta' . Probably this is the best malai kofta I ever had . We also tried the kashmiri pulao and that tasted great too. This place is a must visit for vegetarians and also for anyone who wants to try awesome North indian food.

I have been here a couple of times already. The quality of the food is good but not worth the hype.

The Sanjeev Kapoor trademark Shyaam Savera is spot on.
However the platters especially the paneer tikka and the other paneer tandoori items are bland and chewy

A little heavy on the pocket as well

Was here for dinner the other day with family and my god, you are blown away with the kind of food these guys serve.
To start with we were given a unique fruit filled puchka on a shot glass filling it with "pomegranate khatta paani"
Superb was the feeling.
We had the starters, Paneer Sandwich Kebab and Royal Hara Bhara. The Paneer was given full justice and a nice bulky size coated with heavenly cheese.
Royal Hara Bhara - ok
Now the superhero of the entire evening, the main course
Adraki Dhaniya Paneer - Awesome
Kurkuri Babycorn sabji - Superb
Lalla Mussa Dal - Amazingly Superb, my fav dal from now on
The roti was good.
Service friendly and happy faces
Mocktails was something that were majorly missing

Overall , a must visit
Am coming again..!!

 Its ambience is amazing. Located on the fifth floor of the building, the place is calm and peaceful and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely well behaved and the service is quite good. 
The food quality is undoubtedly wonderful. The breads were not oily, the curries were delicious and the Kashmiri Pulao that we ordered is the best Pulao I've ever had. 
Though the place is a bit expensive but the experience was definitely worth it.

Been there with a friend last year. As it was during Ashtami and no other outlet finding open in the area, we decided to give this place a shot. The restaurant is on the fifth floor of the building and has a hookah parlour exactly opposite to it. It's vey spacious, has a classy decor and the staff is polite and courteous. Even though it was closing in an hour, they offered to take a second round of choices; and helped is with our choices as well.
Now coming to the food, lemme mention it first that I'm not a big fan of vegetarianism. But this joint does serve some delicious greens. Being famished, we went straight to the main course and ordered butter naan, Kashmiri pulao, Paneer taka tak, Mushroom hara pyaaza and a salad. Quality was too good and quantity,@ sufficient for two. The price is on the higher side with a little less than 1.3k bill.
Overall, a pleasant experience, but won't like to visit again until they introduce non-veg items in the menu. :P

Pleasant decor and exrremely well behaved staff. Coming to the food, it did match up to its tag of being associated with the superchef sanjeev kapoor. 
             For starters we had karare subz roll and then tomato basil shorba and we simply loved both of them. And for maincourse we had laal mussa daal (yummy) , kadhai paneer , butter nan ( crispy n light) , gadbad mirch pulao along with adraki dhaniya chaach. The pulao was a bit on the sweeter side but rest all were good. Finally we had chocolate chilli fruit sundae for dessert n it was lovely.
      Pocket pinch is a bit on the higher side yet a very pleasant first experience.

Last year, were visiting Jabalpur (MP) and my sister took us to Yellow Chilli in Jabalpur. It was an awesome experience. Absolutely lip smacking food, great service and courteous staff. In summary, everything perfect.

After that experience in Jabalpur, I always wanted to visit Yellow Chilli in Kolkata. However, for various reasons, we could not make it until 6th May 2016 when we decided to go for dinner.

The restaurant is large but very poorly lit. But that doesn't matter much. What was disappointing was the quality of the food. 

My daughter wanted Crispy baby corn for appetizer and to my surprise it was served in less than 1 min. The baby corn was probably taken out from the refrigerator and was not even properly heated in the microwave. It was so sour that we could hardly ate any. 

From the main course, they suggested a cauliflower preparation and a paneer sabji. The paneer sabji had so much spices that it was black in colour with hardly any taste. The cauliflower was stale and had foul smell. When we complained, we were told that the food is freshly made and it is suppose to taste that way. 

I just wonder, if it is Sanjeev Kapoor who is making fool of his patrons or its just Yellow Chilli Kolkata !!!

I will never visit this place again and not recommend it either.

Yesterday, I went to this place. Amazing food and I have no second thought in calling this a heaven for Veggiee lovers.
They try to put their 100 in taste as well as in being courteous. Good and calm ambience.
Now coming to food, We have ordered couple of items right from staters to deserts in the end all were amazing and finger licking in taste.
You will find a creativity in the food being Chef Sanjeev Kapoor's restro.
We started with Badami subj seekh and nimbu mirch baby corn sticks - amazing in taste as well as in presentation.
In Main course we ordered Saanjh Savera - eaten something of this kind for the first time blend of cottage cheese and spinach in form of kofta with onion tomato gravy was quite tasty.
Lal musaa daal was another gem of this restro its nothing but daal makhani, it will remind you of ITC Group's Peshawari signature dish Daal bukhara.
Finally, we ended with mouth watering Kulfi.
Must visit this place.
You may find this place a bit costly, but its worth paying.

After devouring a sumptuous meal, my friends and I wanted some mocktails and dessert. So we wandered into Yellow Chilli.
Yellow Chili is beautifully adorned with pretty lights and bold furniture. The place looked very clean and the staff were well organized.  Special thanks to Rakesh Shaw for his swift and attentive service.
We ordered the following:
Gulab e Gulkand : This is Gulab jamun with stuffed rose petals. This was good, but we were disappointed to find that there was only one gulab jamun in the platter.
Peru Pyala : This is a Guava juice& lemon juice, with mint syrup drink. This looked and tasted like an Indian curry. It was so bad that we could not finish it.
Masala Mint Cooler : This is a Lemon and Mint syrup drink. This was was fizzy and tasted mediocre.
Blue Lagoon: This was nice and refreshing.

The restaurant is really good and a must try for all foodies. The food quality, taste and value matches rightly. The taste of food offered here is really heart touching and you can sense the quality as soon as food enters your mouth!! There is, I find, greater scope of improvement in Service. This is one of the really really good restaurant in Kolkata.

I went with my friends to celebrate one of my friend's birthday and ordered food. Love the environment, but the quality and quantity of food is not good. Naan was chewy and kulcha was ok.
Dal makhani which they call it as lala mussa dal, was also good but malai kofta was pathetic. The condiments was ok.
Overall experience was average for me and will suggest to do better in food and beverage production side. As it is under Sanjeev Kapoor, the master chef of India.

We visited this beautiful restaurant during Durga Puja 2015 . I was fairly aware of what to expect on arrival that it serves only Vegeterian delicacies . The ambience is excellent and gave a festive feel . However the menucard was nothing short of underwhelming .My expectation was there will be lot more variety on the menucard but it looked like there is hardly anything which can be termed out of the box . The rotis and parathas were hot and crunchy ; it tasted delicious . We ordered two of their signature dishes and I personally was surprised how quickly it got served . The side dishes though felt fresh but it felt like it just got heated in microwave and served with fresh garnishing on Top . I felt the footfall is really low here even though it's Sanjeev Kapoor's chain . The location though well planned but still it's problematic .Since the footfall is not encouraging they have cut down on variety and serving dishes hitting in microwave. That day I certainly missed what I expected .

Went for a dinner. We were given the table just beside the panoramic views of the Jessore road. As the restaurant was situated on the 5th floor so the view is very good and the ambience is beautiful. We were given Dahi Fuchka Complimentary which tasted pretty good. After that we ordered Hariyappa Paneer Tikka as a starter. I liked the dish. Then we ordered Paneer Taka Tak and Zannat a Numa with Peshwari Naan. The star of the show was Zannat a Numa. I never had such lovely stuffed potato before. Overall a good experience but it comes with a little bit higher cost.

The food and ambience is nice. The staff is also very cooperative but the quantity of the food is very less and the prices touch the mountains....... It is a Sanjeev  Kapoor restaurant but is very expensive

Had the chance to visit Yellow Chiili a number if times just because it was just 5 minutes away from my home. First time we went when it was newly opened and I must say we were highly impressed. The kofta and tomato pulao is a must try. Food was not at oily ..the second and third time too the food was pretty upto the mark. Well forgot to add about the mad rush ,we waited an hour to get seats. But my last visit a yr back left me disappointed.  The food quality..the starters the soup...everything tasted bad. Was very disappointed. Dont think I would make a visit very soon

Classy ambience, good food, very good presentation and great service. One should try this if vegetarian. This place is spacious and I found it is not at all crowded. good for a romantic dinner.
 We have tried paneer sandwitch kebab, which was awesome, paneer tikka Q, makai creamy kaju tikki. The kulcha was not at all good. Desert was good. This is little costly for the items though. two persons cost around 2500/-

A very disappointing experience. Not expected of a chain which is associated with the name of Sanjeev Kapoor! The food was very very average, a few not even average, nor was the service any good inspite of the restaurant being empty!! We ordered for a signature dish of paneer which was very ok, the mushroom starter had too much essence and the aloo was atrocious, it was bland with only a topping of sweet chutney. 
Coming to the main course, the paneer makhanwala and pindi chana were good( not great), the black dal was just about ok and none of the rotis were very appealing. The biryani was a complete disappointment, it was more like a pullao!! 
A very dull experience, especially because we had expectations of tasting good food at least, even if the location was not very apt.

I 1st visited this restaurant for dinner with my family during durga pujas. I chose this particular restaurant because it's close to my residence and has a good ambience too.

But I can't say same about the services.

I was with my wife & my 3.5 yrs old daughter. We were 1st taken to a table meant for two. But later we shifted to a better table.

After that we ordered the dinner in which one item was pyaaj mirch ki roti. When it was served we saw that there was not any onion in that and it was quite hard too. As onion stuffed rotis are soft, not hard. We also ordered a butter naan for our baby. But it was very hard to bite too.

the tap in ladies bathroom was also broken.

As we were getting very late we just left after payment.

Not yellow chilli but Mr. Sanjeev Kapoor's association attracts one to the place, where good food, classy ambience and a great service is expected. Trust me there are better places in town, not telling its not good, you can try once, but there are far better options available in the town. For the local area it might be the best available, but for people staying far away nothing is attractive enough to pull you there again and again.

Tried the dinner buffet. Rs 599 (inclusive of tax). One of the worst vegetarian preparations ever. Have had much better for less than half the price. Please do NOT go there to try the buffet. Don't know about the other dishes though. Had much much higher expectations from a Sanjeev Kapoor restaurant. Terribly disappointed.

This is the first time(19/10/15) i m visited a purely veg restaurant, which is located very nearly to my current residence. just beyond the jessore Road bangur crossing 5th floor of visan eye care building. Ambience is comfortable and fine, but  food items r not up to d marks (after all its a sanjeev kapoor's brand). palang corn was very tasty, and kasari kulfi with rabri is superb .i recommend one thing don't miss the culfi.

Finally decided to have another go at this place - my 5th visit. Came here for lunch as usual - the food taste and quality often tends me to visit this place again and again! Conveniently located in Jessore Road, but people might overlook it also because it is situated inside a corner sought of building.

However, the sign boards facilitate in looking out for this place.

We were well greeted by the attendants and offered a comfortable seat. 4-5 other tables were also occupied. 

Ambience is nice and a Colour TV plays always plays some cricket channel etc.

Coming to food, we ordered Tomato Basil Shorba which was nice as usual. Also, the Harippa Paneer Tikka which we ordered for starters was very good - the paneer cube being exceptionally soft!

For mains, we ordered Kadai Paneer (Very nice), Lalla Mussa Dal (Very Good), Laccha Paratha (Great), Butter Naan (Good), Jeera Pulao (Awesome) and Fresh Lime Soda - Mix (Mind blowing)

Again, the Chocolate Chip Kulfi dessert was outstanding.

Service is very good and staff try to make every effort to satisfy your preferences.

We had food using Groupon vouchers, so our pocket pinch was okay - otherwise, very highly priced food! 

Keep it up!

Very highly priced against the food they serve and the service they provide. I have been here via Groupon coupon but was treated as if I m asking free food from them. If they cannot serve well to the guest they are expecting via campaign, what's the sense. Simply pull it down from Groupon.  The manager literally forced us to order everything at one go n expected us to vacate the table asap. Not recommended

The only turn down was that there was a looong hair strand in my soup,though they changed it immediately !

YELLOW CHILLI...
Finally the long awaited review is here.
This is the restaurant owned by the celeberity chef Sanjeev Kapoor and is located in jessore road,Bangur Avenue...Its a pure vegeterian reataurant and its one of mine favourite among all the vegies restaurant in kolkata.I have visited this restaurant many times and everytime had an amazing experience.

Starting from the tomato shorba soup , kiwi mojito in mocktail to tandoori aloo & paneer tika and 
Hara bhara kawab in starters all were mouth watering..

In main course we ordered masala kulchha,garlic nan and lachha parathas which were again superb
we tried Daal makhani,paneer butter masala,mix vegetables which were again awesome...

& How can one forget ordering shyam savera the signature dish  after going to yellow chilli because the founder of both this restaurant and item are d same Sanjeev kapoor

Dont forget to try their gulkand gulabjamun one item for which i am crazy about..gulkand inside of hot gulabjamuns and they taste yummy...


So overall have an amazing experience,prices are little on a higher side but good food covers all..
keep maintaining the quality..

Once again Yellow chilli has disappointed. I last had tried 1 year back and the food and service was a disaster. 
Yesterday I ordered food through Zomato thinking that at least in 1 year there must have been some improvements but sorry so say it's all the same crap service and food.
The food was absolutely stale and the butter naan was like a rubber sheet. 
Sorry for ordering from this restaurant and I will never again even look at this restaurant.
These guys are simply spoiling the name of Sanjeev Kapoor.

A good place for the vegetarian crowd that is totally wortg the potential hassle one might face in reaching this relatively remote haven for authentic and tempting north indian food. I've been here once with my extended family and still remember two things from that experience. Firstly, the veg platter of kebabs. It was utterly fulfilling and a diverse mix of flavors on a single plate. The second was the very clear distinction in the gravy of each curry that we ordered. This, is particularly a rare phenomenon with most of the north indian joints. Slightly on the expensive side but still recommended for a rare exclusive dinner with friends and family.

It is located on 5th floor near the junction of bangur Avenue and jessore road. The main entrance is at the back of the building. Very difficult to locate unless you know about it. Misconceptions must be there that all the dishes are from Sanjeev Kapoor's kitchen, but there are just few signature dishes of him on menu.  The first thing is the ambience it's cool, peaceful and calm. Next, the food, the breads were delicious,  not oily. Dallas makhani was awesome. Kashmiri pulao is must try, it's flavor is very aromatic. Decent choice for veggie friendly people. Service us remarkable. The hospitality is fantastic.

It is located at the fifth floor of vasan eye care building near the junction of bangur avenue and jessore road, the main entrance is at the back of the building, very difficult to locate unless you know about it. It remains empty most of the time so getting a table is not a factor, one can choose the tables  beside the glass wall overlooking the area for a grand view. Now coming to the food, we ordered lasooni paneer pancham, nimboo mirch babycorn sticks and sunehri gobi for starters. Babycorn was delicious, other 2 were average. for main course we ordered aloo anardana kulcha, mumbai mast tomato pulao, navratan korma and zannat e numa. the curries were very good , kulcha was brilliant , pulao was very ordinary. The mocktails and desserts were also good. overall good food but the pocket pinch was very high as the bill was around 4000 for four people, little too much for a veg restaurant. One can try this once for experience, not for repeated visits..

We went there last night, and had a very poor experience. 
I remember when it initially opened there used to be a big waiting time, to get a reservation. But with time the crowd has thinned, and so has the quality.

We had ordered a `Hara Bhara Kebab` last night, and had to return it half eaten, as some of the Capsicum and Tomatoes were rotten.

We had ordered Navratan Korma and Yellow Dal Tadka (no onion / garlic).
The dal had a bad odour of roasted garlic. The Navratan Korma, was average, a bit too sweet. Also, the serving size were one of the smallest I have seen.

Not likely to visit again until forced to.

Attended Yellow Chilli Banquet for my cousin's engagement party and had a really horrible experience. Attendants behaving like the babus of the Bengal Govt Dept.
Cholche cholbe attitude...No focus to understand any issue let alone solve.
AC in the hall was not working in this peak summer and almost all the guest had a tough time.
Lighting in the hall was also pathetic and it seems electricity cost saving initiative by management at the expense of customers was the goal.
Food quality and service very ordinary. Soup bowls were removed from the table by 7.45 PM itself. 
Each time some guest were to be entertained, the waiters serving the snacks were to be accosted or else they vanish somewhere.

Overall experience awful and Owners seem to manage the show, remotely.

Though the food quality was good they should improve their service.....

A restaurant owned by a celebrity chef doesn't mean it has to be good .. My experience at yellow chili was awful.. Had ordered for panner butter masala and dal makhani.. The panner curry was full of oil.. And the dal didn't have basic salt for taste.. I had been for the first time and this was what I went through..

One of the best vegan restuarant in kolkata that can make the meat lovers go vegetarian. Ambiance is good along with the staff. It has different variety of food to choose from. And their gulab jamuns are one of the best in kolkata..

The Yellow Chilli (TYC) – a chain of restaurants owned by Sanjeev Kapoor the celebrity chef, with over 14 outlets across the country. The Yellow Chilli at Jessore Road also features a bar and a private dining area. A sunny glow and cream chairs lend an air of understated elegance. We heard at TYC, taste comes first! So, we thought about giving it a try and finally we planned to celebrate Saumik’s birthday at TYC. Birthday party at an Indian restaurant is a great way to treat your friends and tastes much better than licking rumpled up dollar bills. The restaurant’s menu displays a wide range of authentic Indian delicacies. 

We love to have ‘Sweet Corn Soup’ & ‘Paneer Hot and Sour Soup’ as appetizer.  As soon those soups arrived in our table, I clicked few snap. At that time one of the restaurant staff asked me why I am clicking pictures. I replied that while giving a review of a restaurant in social media, pictures makes it more attractive and appropriate.  Then he informed me that photography is prohibited here and asked for my card and this conversation continues for two – three minutes. This argument with the steward and staff in general was really embarrassing for me. 

Both Sweet Corn & Hot and Sour soups taste pretty average, nothing to get excited about. For starters we opted for ‘Kaaju Creamy Tikki’ and ‘Tandoori Aloo Posto’ followed by ‘Kiwi Punch’ and ‘Mango Delight’ mocktails. We were very much hungry & wolfed down everything within a minute of those being put on table. Kaaju Creamy Tikki was just too good and it just melts in our mouth, perfect mix of ingredient. I felt Tandoori Aloo Posto was tad tasteless, may be the taste of Kaaju Creamy Tikki still occupying my taste buds. In future I will definitely try Tandoori Aloo Posto before Kaaju Creamy Tikki. Both mocktails were just awesome but I felt quantity was not satisfying. 

For main course we decided to had ‘Lala Mussa Dal’, ‘Dal Mizaz’, ‘Lacha Parantha’, ‘Butter Naan’, ‘Makhanwala Paneer’, ‘Anglo-Indian Jhaal Farezi’ and ‘Kashmiri Pulao’. Lala Mussa Dal and Dal Mizaz taste very ordinary but very much palatable with Lacha Parantha & Butter Naan. Makhanwala Paneer was good, nicely flavoured and tasty but it was missing the mouth-watering heavenly feelings. On side by side Anglo-Indian Jhaal Farezi was exceptionally good, it’s even taste better with Kashmiri Pulao which was also perfectly done. But again I felt quantity was not sufficient. 

In desserts Gulab–e–Gulkand was unbelievably sweet. It was sweet enough to satisfy my sweet teeth and bring smile to my face. Chocolate Chip Kulfi felt bit monotonous after gulabjamun, my heart was not satisfied with those tiny pieces but good enough.

Though all in all food was good and satisfied me enough for giving a 3.5 rating, but I am giving a mediocre rating for the impractical conversations by the staffs and ruining our mood for dining. I think customer satisfaction is surely not on their priority list, which is a must for hospitality industry.

This place is very close to my heart. I have been here twice and both times with my special people on special occasions. The staff are so well mannered. They are always having smile on their face which it itself is a treat. Extremely patient staff.
The ambiance is cool and quiet. 

The food is just too good. We have tried their unique item - Naan Pizza, which is very big and a very different item. The koftas are lovely, the parathas are awesomely cooked. Loved every item we had. SOme people can say its over pricey but the portion of food they give, just balances it. One of my favourite Chefs creation and favourite restaurant. Good work Yellow Chilli team! Keep up the quality.

Sometimes, after the meaty and fishy bonanza that is our bengali cuisine, you tend to yearn some vegetarian delicacies. Chef Sanjeev Kapoor delivers exactly that. 

The first thing is the ambience. Cool, peaceful and calm. The kind of ambience that invites you in. Next, the food. The breads were delicious, and not oily. The rice dishes are a beautiful play on the pallete. And the Adraki Dhaniya paneer is a punch in the gut of flavours. The Gulab e gulkand was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but the lemon lassi makes up for it.


A bit on the costly side, but the experience is definitely worth it.

I had high expectations from this place as it was a unit of the renowned Chef Sanjeev Kapoor but the food and service was not up to the mark. Neither the starters nor the main course was good enough as was expected. I only liked their Lalla Mussa Dal but then only the Dal could not substitute for the whole meal !

The entry is in the rear of the building. And u might be confused which way to go as there is a entrance in front which leads up the building Allright but not lead you there. There were no directions. The decor is good and there is a good view up from the 5 th floor by the glass wall. The dishes are not over the top as you might imagine while going to a restaurant by 'SANJEEV KAPOOR' but the behaviour of the staff makes up for it, you see they were extra attentive and caring.We had kathel biriyani,paneer  tikka masala, some mushroom, peshawari naan, lava flow mock tail, a dessert with little gulab jamuns and to our dismay milk bread soaked in sugary syrup..but I am not going back there as I'm not a vegetarian but if become one someday I will go back surely.

But the price that tags along with it is a bit high according to the quality it provides. Might be ,that it is associated or owned by Mr.  Kapoor that makes the price high.

It's a sanjeev kapoor venture. And offers good Indian cuisine. I had tried the Chinese and it was yucks. And I mean it.. So don't try it at all!!!!. 
The Indian food is however totally opposite.
The dal makhani is awesoooome. Very smooth ekdum makhan jaisa. The paneer was also soft and well prepared. With nice yellow gravy. There is a vegetable called zannat e something. It's stuffed potato. The spices were so apt. It was like a tadak item song.relishing and mouth watering. Other than that. The ambience is totally family crowd so a good family outing is recommended.
Price is apt according to the name.so a must try but only for Indian food..

Well after knowing that its a veg restaurant i didn't want to go there in the first place... But my betterhalf insisted..
But to be very honest i  really enjoyed my first visit to a Veg restaurant.. Even being a complete nonveg lover...
The quality and the quantity of the food is good... 
The waiters are helpful..
And the ambience is also nice..
Well  it takes a bit of time for the food to arrive after placing the order.. But its worth waiting... 
The prices are a bit too high ... And a nonveg lover may not consider going there as they can get good nonveg restaurants in a very pocket friendly budget... 

Well i would say that people who loves only nonveg food (specially bengalis) can check out the place once just for a change.. I'm sure they'll like it..

I had one of those Groupon deals and I had been eager to try the much famed Sanjeev Kapoor touch. The location is really weird for a fine dining restaurant but that didn't bother me. The staff was courteous for the most part. We had the yellow dal which reminded me of a dhabba I used to love long back. The shaam savera was pretty nice but portions are really small. Same applied to dessert. I didn't like the soup at all. And yes the hara paneer tikka was very good, better than most places. I might go once again but overall I would expect better portions from a somewhat pricey place like this.

After buying a coupon from groupon (that rhymed!), we headed off to yellow chilli for lunch. We had accidentally printed out the wrong coupon but after a brief confusion the right coupon was mailed and availed and we chose to eat from their indian menu which started with hot and sour soup. One portion soup was divided into two parts and it was  spicy and a bit too heavy handed with the ginger. We also received two mocktails in little glasses which tasted nice but did not have much ice in them despite us telling them.

Anyway... We chose the hara Marsala bhuna paneer which was nicely cooked with very soft paneer .. However we got only four pieces of paneer in it. 

This was followed by the main course. We wanted butter naan and kashmiri pulao as well as yellow dal and sham savera  from it. They brought in the naan with the dal and sham savera. Although the dal was nice and portion size was fine I was dismayed to see that in the sham savera dish only one kofta was served cut in half .. And therefore the portion size was measly ... They also did not think of bringing the kashmiri pulao with the other dishes... So my friend had to eat his kashmiri pulao with no accompaniment since he had finished off his portion of dal and sham savera with the naan.

For dessert we chose gulkand stuffed gulab jamun and Choco chip kulfi with chocolate sauce.  They served me half of a kulfi and one gulkand stuffed gulab jamun. I believe that when you are taking 700/- for a meal for two then at least you can serve an entire kulfi and serve a dish which has at least two koftas in it.... Or a kabab which has only four pieces of paneer in it rather than filling up with dal.

What a Waste of a restaurant this has become now. After starting off with a decent impression this restaurant has become a total failure. There are no proper staffs and the management has gone from GOOD to BAD to WORSE to WORST.
I used to be frequent to this restaurant when it opened and really liked the food despite the exorbitant prices.
The management now does not bother about the customer satisfaction. Once you step inside the restaurant there is no proper welcome and once you have placed your order, they bring the food quickly as if it was already kept prepared. The food that comes will not be hot at all and there will be multiple problems such as less or more salt, totally different from what you ate last time, normal food made extremely spicy and vice versa, etc.
Also they are in a hurry and take off plates and bowls once you are done eating so that you can leave quickly and they can make others customers sit.
When you tell them, they just say it can happen. I mean how can it happen and how can they just say something like that. They do not even try to apologize.
I went with my family and other friends yesterday and really got embarrassed in front of my friends when they complained about the food. They told me that they had never tasted such bad food before.
The Rotis and Nan that they brought were totally stale and as if they were kept in freezer. 
They gave me a discount coupon of 10% because my bill was above 2000, which I threw in the dustbin as I have no intention of coming back to this restaurant again.
This restaurant has become totally disgusting and the management here is simply destroying the name of Sanjeev Kapoor which I really feel sorry about. I am taking so much time to give such a huge feedback only because I want other people planning to visit this restaurant look at it and avoid it as avoiding it will not only save their money but will also save them from the embarrassment they would have after visiting this restaurant.
My advice to the restaurant management : Just having nice ambiance and big space will not work. You need to be sensitive to your customer requirements and listen to complaints.

I will be posting this everywhere where yellow chilli kolkata is listed so that more and more users read this and avoid the restaurant.
Also,I am going to tell this to each and every friend of mine in office and their friends and also all my friends and relatives and their relatives living in lake town, bangur, dum dum, nager bazar, baguiati and other areas.

Please avoid going to Yellow Chilli... There are so many good restaurants around this area.

The Yellow Chilli is a place that should be avoided by all because of the shoddy management and the horrible food. It seems to me that the name of Sanjeev Kapoor is associated with this franchise just to make it more attractive to potential diners, whereas the quality of the fare served and the management leaves a lot to be desired. We made the mistake of booking the large banquet hall in The Yellow Chilli, Jessore Road on 2nd May for a family event. An evening of celebration was totally ruined, thanks to The Yellow Chilli.  There was a power cut and as there was NO POWER BACKUP, guests had to take the STAIRS to reach the 6th FLOOR where the banquet hall is located. Several older guests had to go back as they were unable to climb the stairs. To make it worse, when it started raining, the entire floor of banquet hall was COVERED IN WATER coming in from the terrace lawn outside. And don't even get me started on the food. Even a roadside eatery makes better food than that. Most of it was inedible. Overall the family had such a horrible experience that we don't think we are ever going back to yellow chili or recommending it to anyone.

What a Waste of a restaurant this has become now. After starting off with a decent impression this restaurant has become a total failure. There are no proper staffs and the management has gone from GOOD to BAD to WORSE to WORST.
I used to be frequent to this restaurant when it opened and really liked the food despite the exorbitant prices.
The management now does not bother about the customer satisfaction. Once you step inside the restaurant there is no proper welcome and once you have placed your order, they bring the food quickly as if it was already kept prepared. The food that comes will not be hot at all and there will be multiple problems such as less or more salt, totally different from what you ate last time, normal food made extremely spicy and vice versa, etc.
Also they are in a hurry and take off plates and bowls once you are done eating so that you can leave quickly and they can make others customers sit.

Located on jessore road this sanjeev kapoor restaurant has a wide variety of north indian cuisine. With not many restaurants around, it surely is a nice place for food lovers. In the main course section, Shaam savera is a winner. The service is a bit slow. Living upto its brand name, it's a tad bit expensive. Rating 3.5

One fine day while pondering over the lack of  options for vegetarians in Kolkata , A friend of mine (that jerk !!)  had a brainwave   & voila we landed at  "The Yellow Chilli" .    According to my friend the restaurant  is a franchise of none other than  SANJEEV KAPOOR. Hell yeah, the same Sanjeev Kapoor  whose moustaches back then , inspired me to acquire one when i grow up .  

Coming to food i have a very different philosophy   .  The name of the cook cannot  suffice the salt in the soup. 

 "Ibn-e-mariam (Jesus Christ)   hua kare Koi ...........Par pehle mere dard-e-dil ki dawa kare koi"   . yeah u can relate to  that in context of food. 

The restaurant is located on the fifth floor of a building , with an entrance positioned on the back side ( I ain't Kidding !) . The staff is courteous esp . the waiters  are prompt.  .the place is spacy with a nice decor . 

 But ..Indian Food on offer disappoints me since the menu lacks novelty and experimentation , sticking to the usual North Indian Fare .  I do confess that not a single one of the ordered dish tasted bad . Everything was just mediocre . But the prices they  are just as far -fetched  as a bollywood flick's collection.   

Go there .....Check it out .....for yourself .

“Don't go to this restaurant buying any Deal Coupon from Groupon”

Visited last night with my family after buying a coupon from Groupon, but not satisfied with the service and quantity of food they offer for the same. Spent around Rs 2250/- for 5 adults and 1child below 5yrs but we had to keep on reminding the sequence how to serve for each and every thing. We had been to the same place without buying any coupon in the month of Oct 2013 but got very good service and food as well. But yesterday night was horrible for us to dine in the same place. Server's forget to serve the full menu what they were offering. We keep on reminding all the dishes which were mentioned on the deal. Moreover if you order A la-carte menu the quantity would be enough for 3 pax which was not felt yesterday. We ordered for Kashmiri pulao we got very good taste and when we ask for the same next time it was totally bland. The chef should know that when s/he is delivering the order it should be well garnished but nothing was found in any dishes except the starters. Even Mocktails were not garnished properly. But I am sure if you go directly to the same restaurant they will not treat you as a COUPON GUEST.....

I had been to this place yesterday and the food was really delicious . The ambience was very good and the staff were very polite and attentive. 
Now talking about the food we ordered a minestrone soup which was average and could have been better. For starters we ordered crispy chilly baby corn and Hare masale ka bhuna paneer which were really awesome. Moving to the main course we ordered shaam savera and Dal makhani which were excellent. Then we ordered a subz panchmela which could have been better. For breads we ordered cheese kulcha which was very delicious. After having such a great time we opted to have desserts as well and ordered a chocolate chip kulfi. I am not a dessert lover but that dessert  was really very nice. 
So I would recommend everyone to pay a visit to this place though the cost is on the higher side but is completely worth  your money.

The most exhaustive menu of vegeterian items including Indian and surprisingly Chinese and the cute kiddy menu too. In a city like Kolkata where veggie items are a luxury this place is a serious heaven. A tad expensive but then worth that extra buck for the variety and great quality. I used to sunacribe to Sigree for the veg food but now this has to be tried again for other items. Highly recommended. The overall service is great.

My visit to yellow chilli was associated with a lot of expectations since the preparations belong to Chef Sanjeev Kapoor who has also been associated in the past with Ivory (Grain of salt) which became one of my favorite dining destination from day 1. But yellow chilli failed to create that charm. 

The restaurant is spacious and comfortable. Decor is average. The staff is polite but could be more courteous and service is decently paced. The prices are in the league of machaan, sigree, kaafila but overall experience does not match these competitors. They have chinese menu as well but north indian food looks more promising.

My favorite part at any Indian restaurant are the kebabs. We ordered for a medium kebab platter which was pretty wholesome for 4-5 people. They had 6-7 items in the platter which gave us a welcome oppurtunity to taste a lot of kebabs. Kali mirch paneer tikka, hariyali or hara bhara kebab were really great. Seekh kebab and other panner tikkas, malai makai kebab were average. I tried the palak shorba which was very nice.

They have a variety of dishes in spinach unlike most other restaurants which seems to be their forte and i liked whatever i tried. Koftas were good but the black dal,  claimed to be their signature dish was average which disappointed us. Rotis were well made. Kashmiri pulao is nice but could be better with stronger flavors. Options in deserts are limited and i tried the indrayani which had a nice flavour but the hardness of the small rassagullas acted as a dampener. 

One has to travel to a different corner to visit yellow chilli and the place disappoints. It doesn't impress to that extent for one to come down specifically to dine here. But yes, if one loves spinach, this place has more to offer compared to other places otherwise, its worth skipping.

I think its quite hyped..

The ambiance is too loud.. Even on a weekday, it was so noisy. Not very impressive, the food served was even a bit cold.  

Moreover, the prices are too high compared to the taste and quality.. Its just not worth it..
No complimentary papads even, and onions served were not fresh even,. Wont visit it again..

And yes, please dont mention 1000 for two people, it is 1500 minimum for two people.

went to yellow chilli today with family for dinner and the expirience was very ordinary. the food was bland and ordinary and most important the prices which was extremely high is just not justified at all.the names of the dishes are fancy but preparation very ordinary. most importantly we r paying the price of almost five star and getting service and ambience which is very ordinary. the waiters doesn't have any idea about the menu.when u order any mock tails they will mix it in the mixer grinder on a marble top in the middle of the restaurant and the noise of which will get onto ur nerves. to sum it up it is very substandard and master chef should not lend his name to this kind of outlet and at last two person cannot dine there in 1 k its minimum 2k for two persons. that's the reason they don't show their prices in the menu uploaded in zomato and above all the tax structure is almost 30 %  please avoid

Perhaps it is  the only fine-dining restaurant offering only vegetarian food and  is  located in the vicinity of Bangur ,on the Jessore road, just opposite a Petrol pump.One has to go behind the main building as the entrance to the Restaurant on the 5th floor is located there.One finds it difficult to park the car & since the owner of the restaurant also owns the petrol pump , one can park it there!I found the waiting  area leading to the restaurant very small & barely any place for sitting.However once you take the lift & enter the main lobby you would be greeted by the steward/hostess and escorted inside.The decor is good & so is the ambience,I found the place a bit expensive as far as vegetarian food is concerned.The dishes I tried included, tomato Dahnai shorba,  a starter in the form of stuffed potatoes with spicy mixutre of corn & nuts which was nice & yummy!I settled stariaght away for the main course which was Adraki Dhania Paneer & Veg Jhal Frezi, which I had with Tadka Dal & Lasooni Nan!I finished off with Kulfi without the  faluda. The portions served is fair enough and  except for the price which I found to be very high(I could have had a good Non-veg Meal at the same price!), the experience was pretty satisfactory!I came to know of a fixed menu , smartly priced & meant exclusively  for the  Kitty Parties only!

Most awful food ! We were 8 people and no one liked any thing .
The preparations are really below average .
Only thing good was the Roti /Missi Roti 
The starters were tasteless .
The vegetables not up to the mark .
On complaining the chef said " Hamara recipe aisa hi hai " 
Mr Sanjeev  saab you need to look here .we are a big fan of  your food .and recipes .
While you are producing master chefs , the chefs at the yellow chilli are  performing  below average .

We don't want another restaurant to close down .

One of the sadder dining places. Ordinary ambience, and extremely ordinary food. Bland and insipid, all the dishes we ordered were made without passion, talent or will. Obviously churned out of a kitchen which has chefs who don't love their job. Avoid like the plague.

Location: Yellow chilly is located at Bangur avenue in Jessore road . It located quite in the interiors but one wouldn't have problem as the place is well renowned and popular. This place is run by the name of chef Sanjeev Kapoor. The place quite doesn't live up to all the hype and the expectation I went there with. Coming to the pros and cons:-
Pros : 
1) The menu has creative and innovative names which attracts attention. 
2) The staff's are warm and friendly . 
3) The only very good I tasted was Chutney Chatpata Paneer. 

Cons : 
1) To begin with the food ordered, it was quite bland and additional salt and pepper was also required in many dishes . 
2) The service is quite slow and although the staff is friendly they are not well informed about the items in the menu . 
3) I ordered Natkhat Nimbuwala babycorn , Tawa Special , Dal Makhani which was very average and mostly bland. 
4) The prices are not worth to be Paid for the average food like this. 

Overall i had great expectation from Yellow Chilly and it didn't live upto that level . Quite dissapointed would rate it 2.5.

Was present in the opening day and had also met Sanjeev Kapoor , Ram Kapoor Ind Sakshi Tanvar. The ambiance and decor are very good. The food is average and the locality in which the restaurant is situated is not that good. If someone is going for the first time he/she will have a lot of problem.

Though the drive to Jessore road was tiring and the place was situated in the 5th floor, it was a culinary delight refreshingly different from the other restaurants . Each dish was different starting from the starters of a palak appetizer with a stuffing of hung yoghurt and chilli baby corn (which the kids enjoyed) to the main course where all the three side dishes we ordered tasted totally different from the standard ones . A special mention of the Gadbad Pulao it was really delicious and the kids loved the Kashmiri pulao , nothing floated in oil and was served to perfection and finally the dessert of Kulfi with Rabdri was too tempting to pass up. Of course the rates were a bit steep by my standards, but definitely worth a Mother's day treat for mom and me from hubby and Dad. 
Ah did I mention the bread basket was silken soft and piping hot which again was a refreshing change from the cold leathery ones which almost always comprise a bread basket with a few hot ones on the top usually..well it was truly one satisfactory lunch session ! 
The only flip side was the restaurant apparently opens only at 12.30 so we were very hungry when we arrived and wished they could bring the food to the table pronto when we landed there at about 1.30 though to be fair the staff tried their best and managed to at least get the soup on the table fast and followed up with one starter well timed to alleviate the hunger pangs and the rest was definitely worth waiting. Prices could be slightly lower for the starters and the sabjis though, they did taste different and good on the pallete!

We had great expectations from this restaurant. It was our wedding anniversary on March 9th and we wanted have very good vegetarian food for lunch. However, we found that other than kababs, peshawari nan  and to some extent Sham Savera, other items were not up to the mark. The prices were also exhorbitant. There was an offer going on which said that for Rs 350 two vegetables and a dal item would be served for a couple. This was not communicated to us. We spotted it after our billing was over and when we pointed this out, we were consoled by the words "Next time". When we told it was our wedding anniversary, the person who took orders said that we should have mentioned it earlier. He said that a cake would have been offered free of cost if we had informed him earlier.

I am a vegetarian and really found it difficult to believe that we would have such a bad experience in  a restaurant like this.

We went there for lunch just being curious about new place. Service was one of the best I ever had, normally in places with vegifood all staff are very polite and helpful. Well, this time waiter that served us looked like he is there just for us. Help us to select as has full information about menu, with a smile. Main courses were best, everything was special, you can't really called it only restaurant, and for price definitely best. Desserts was also awesome, ! It is really nice place , as decor is awesome,

After walking through for a while this was the only restaurant that seemed to attract a lot of people and that is always a good sign. I doesn't look all that, but the food is great and the service is just as good. We had palakshorba for starters and a Shashi paneer for main course and both were great! They could have spiced it up even more, but it was a pleasant change from all the tasteless food we'd had so far. Fresh good and a  lively atmosphere without being noisy. Recommended.

We were staying close to Jessor Road and used Zomato to inform our dining experiences...and I'm so glad we did! Arriving at Yellow Chilli for our second of six nights in town, we advised staff that we weren't keen on paneer, got a couple of spontaneous substitutions in what was a memorable dining experience - so much so that we spent our last night here too! The combination of shine and sparkle in the decor, polish and efficiency in the staff, and deftness of spicing and flavoursome food (plus really good restrooms!) combine to deliver a great night out at a very affordable price...this one is well worth a visit! Thanks to Chef Sanjeev Kapoor.....

The Yellow Chilli.. It is located at Bangur Avenue in Jessore Road. Run by the name of Master Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, this is a pretty decent place to go for Vegetarian food. The items on the menu are quite limited. The starters - Pashtooni Chana Tikki and Malaidaar Makai Tikki were good whereas the Natkhat Nimboowala Babycorn was Okayish. In the main course, Dal was bad (huge overdose of garlic), Vegetable Jhalfrezi was average and Shaam Savera was awesome. The breads were edible. The desserts - Chocolate Chip Kulfi with Fudge Sauce and the Motichoor Phirni were nice. Extremely slow service maybe because we went on Durga Ashtami. Expensive in spite of being fully vegetarian for the ambiance and the quantity of food they serve. Three stars from me.

Had a wonderful culinary experience. The black Dal mahakni is the best I have ever had any where. The paneer makhan wala was good too. And pyaz - mirche ki roti and peshawari naan were too good.  Even the hydrabadi biryani was amazingly good.  Only thing that needs improvement is the sweet dish.  And yes, it is bloody expensive. But maza aa gaya.

We love to go again and again and try all the delicious dishes of the yellow chilli, the dish today i like most is Tamatar Basil Soup, kali mirch lasooni paneer, palak cholley and some potato dish name started with Zannat and motichoor phirni was toooo good.

And i can't believe the prices, its very economical, we three had all this in just 1560 rupees.

It's really worthable.

the welcome table at the ground floor was empty, but there was no dearth of smiles at the restaurant floor. the floor is spacious and very well decorated, sparse but well lit. the seating was very comfortable and the tables were well set. we had tomatar basil shorba, subj kebab, peshwari naan, paratha, Zannat e Numa and makhanwala paneer. food was very tasty and rich. 
they dont allow the shorba to be shared into portions and thats a bit of a pinch on the pocket. luckily they dont charge for the water they serve and they do give some chatpata items complimentary. 
the waiters are very well mannered and the place is definitely good value for money.
