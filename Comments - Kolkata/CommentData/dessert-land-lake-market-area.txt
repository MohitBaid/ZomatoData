Cakes are sooo delicious. I tried strawberry & chocolate cake, I would suggest to order these two flavours for sure. Tried cup cakes also with cartoon decoration it was amazing.

The cakes are still moist, delicious and their new location is even more convenient. Best cakes Iâ€™ve ever tried. Canâ€™t go wrong with their cakes. We usually get the basic cakes for the little ones but they have so many flavors, even adults will love.
