Situated on the 8th floor of the de sovrani hotel, the sky view cafe is one of the newest roof top cafes in Kolkata.
Ambience: Cozy and relaxed. Roof top amazing view of the city. Perfect for dates and hangouts
Food: Fish tikka and chicken bbq. Both were very good and pretty affordable. Hookah is available.
Staff: Very good service. Debit card might not work sometimes because of network issues at the 8th floor. Mine did work after a few tries.
To sum it up: A must visit

Located on the roof top of De Sovrani hotel, this place is good only if you want to relax in a calm environment on a sultry evening. A big no for winter visits. Decor is okay, staffs are okay, food deserves 1 out of 5 for being bad both quality and price wise. A one off visit on a sultry summer eve can be opted for but then again be ready to shake off your wallet.

This place is good enough to embrace the beauty of nature.. But foods are not worth for money.. Quantity was too less according to the price.. Margarita pizza is not even sufficient for one person.. Blueberry shake was good in taste.. And I don't know why they haven't include any hot beverages in their menu..

Beguiling ambience. Rest everything was a let-down. We went with pinacolada, black coffee, cappuccino, breezer, chicken mexicano and murgh tikka. Pinacolada tasted nothing like it is supposed to taste but rather like banana milkshake. We mentioned this and it was replaced but the second one was as bad as the first one. Black coffee and cappuccino were disasters. They charged 150 bucks each and served in a tiny cup. Both the starters were quite bland. Service was pretty slow. A disheartening experience.

First things first. The decor and ambience of the place is peaceful and charming. Located at the seventh floor, the cafe has its own open space. Moreover, the view from the top is pleasing. 

I had ordered a Barbeque Chicken which was honestly not extraordinary. It tasted average. The menu consists of mainly starters and snacks and no main course. The Raspberry smoothie and lemon shake however, tasted nice. 

The price is reasonable. The smoothies range from 200 to 220 whereas the chicken costs 250 rupees.

In conclusion, it is a nice place to enjoy warm evenings either with a special one or on your own.

This place is located on the 9th floor of De Sovrani Hotel. You might find it hard to find it as it has no location pop-up. The place is exquisite, wonderfully decorated with lights and other stuff. It seemed a pretty good place to sit and hangout with friends.

Menu:-

Afghani Tikka:- it consists of 5 pieces. This was mindboggling in taste. Chicken pieces were soft and pretty good at size.

Margarita Pizza:- disappointment started with this one. 4 pieces of tiniest of tiniest sizes. Nothing special in taste to cheer about. In terms of cost to quantity ratio this was a total let down.

Presto Pasta:- this one was horror. We ordered non-veg one and it didn't seem to be a non-veg one. Nothing to talk about its taste was left with utter disappointment.

Well, if you want to drink or wanna have hookah with the open sky and ambience around you will really love it but don't go its food to dampen your mood.

Note:- this place seriously needs to work on its customer handling. It took them nearly 15 minutes to take our order leaving aside its servicing time. Even it took them 10 minutes to prepare the bill.

Today on 1st January I visited this place with my friends. Locating this place might be a bit difficult , it's near CC1. This place has an amazing ambience , the decoration is very classy and vibrant , perfect for a romantic date. Settling in the cosy ambience we ordered

AFGHANI TIKKA - It contained 5 big pieces of chicken well marinated in spices with a good coating. This was rich in flavour and good to taste.

OLIVERA PIZZA - Here comes the disappointment. 4 extremely small pizza slices with a plate full of tomato sauce. We didnt even need to bite the slice , it could easily go into the mouth , yes that small. The taste was okayish just like any other normal confectionery shop.

PESTO PASTA - It was also extremely less in proportion with negligible amount of chicken and veggies. And the most horrible part was it had Maggi masala flavour in it. It tasted really very bad. We had to gulp it somehow.

And again to mention their horrible service. They took 10 mins to give the bill and for starters we had to wait almost 30 mins.
Maybe this place is good to hangout and grab a drink but definitely does not serve good food.

This cafe is at 9th floor of De Sovrani Hotel. 
An open air restaurant, with a great ambience.
Service is a little slow. Menu needs to be worked out. Limited options available in the menu. Sheesha is below average. No hot beverages or mocktails are available. 
Only things which works in it's favor are the location and ambience.

Had visited the place with friends on a chilly December evening. The ambience was great though it was a bit cold at the time and view from the cafe was superb to say the least. However, the food was bit of a disappointment. Coffee priced at 150 bucks was worse than what you get in roadside shops. We ordered murgh tikka and Mexican chicken none of which are worth mentioning. I'm rating the restaurant 3 for its ambience only.

The restaurant is on the top of De soverani hotel near cc 1 nd the sonnet. It's on the 8 th floor. Full marks to the ambiance but the starters are of high price and not so good. We ordered breezer nd pinacolada. Breezer was good,but pinacolada flavour was not good. Hope they will improve themselves. Will try next tym hukkas rather than food. My suggestion is some other starter menu should be added. Had gone with

Overall we spent an wonderful time over here, now its your turn. This simple yet peaceful place is perfect to spent the evening with your loved one on this festive season of Christmas and New Year.

This new rooftop cafe is still unknown to many due to the lack of promotion but this place deserves a lot more attention and appreciation!

3 minutes walk from City Centre 1, this cafe is on the roof top of De Sovrani hotel and opens at 4pm. The seating arrangements are great and can easily accommodate 40 people.

They have a wonderful playlist which adds to the beautiful ambiance. The volume will not make you feel dizzy unlike few other places. You can have conversation at peace.

The service is too good! Loved their hospitality. Food is good but have rooms for improvement. Menu option is limited at the moment but hopefully they will add new items soon. Price is quite reasonable.

Recommended!

De Sovrani‚Äòs rooftop cafe is perfect place to spend quality time in the open air with that dimly lit ambiance, I am sure this is going to be a wonderful experience. Up above such high building with some delicious food for your soul; perfect in every way.

To start with, the ambience was perfect as it should be in a sky lounge along with good music
We ordered beers, Honey hookah, Paneer Shashlik kababs, Mahi fish tikka & Pasta arabiata
The hookah was fine, Mahi fish tikka was more like chicken tikka, we even got confused at its 1st bite... The pasta was good but should had been accompanied with a garlic bread. Staff behaviour and serving time was also good.
Overall it's a good place to hangout with your friends.

Kolkata is upping its game in the rooftop cafe scene by leaps and bounds. Sky View Cafe by Hotel De Sovrani near CC1 is the newest and one of the most affordable addition in town that serves an array of cocktails & mocktails, finger food (veg & non veg) and hookah.
‚óè Ambience: As good as a rooftop cafe can be. Open air, Comfy seating arrangements, potted plants hither and thither, decorated with fairy lights and a fair mix of music plays along.
‚óè Beverages:
* Painkiller: A twist on the good old Pinacolada. A rich and fruity cocktail. Coconut cream, orange juice and pineapple juice join White Rum in this drink, topped off with a dash of nutmeg sprinkle.
* Mojito: White Rum based cocktail. Rum, lime juice and soda punched together to make the holy concoction, served with a dash of mints and lime wedges.
* Sunset: A colourful mocktail made up of orange and lemon juice; served on a glass having the bottom coated with a hint of rose syrup.
* Blue Moon and dark Night: Another mocktail with a base of pepsi or cola punched with lemon juice and blue curacao.
*Fresh lime soda.

‚óè Food:
As it's a rooftop cafe, it caters finger food mainly. Some of the things i tasted are : 
* Margherita pizza 
* Penne Arabiata
* Bbq Pineapple
* Tandoori aloo (Recommended)
* Bbq chicken
* Afghani Tikka (Recommended!!)
* Chinese sizzler (veg)
* Continental sizzler (non veg)

‚óè  Hookah: Thankfully they serve hookah which is a yay from me.
* Loved their bubblegum & mint flavour.
* The brain freezer is fair enough as well.

A new addition to the salt lake sector 1 area, Sky View Cafe is going to be one hell of a hangout place undoubtedly because of it location, ambience and services.
Good wishes!

Time to go up and up‚Ä¶ Height matters‚Ä¶!! What else do u want in this winter.. A rooftop with hookah, food and drinks‚Ä¶!! Go for cocktails or mocktails.. Who else dnt wanna relax with some adda shadda having a view of the whole city‚Ä¶ From howrah bridge & hoogly bridge to Big ben of Laketown‚Ä¶ Yes.. A new rooftop cafe is in the list again in the city at Hotel De Sovrani ie.¬†SKY VIEW CAFE. Perfect for this upcoming winter‚Ä¶!!
                    

Price- Don‚Äôt hesitate to go‚Ä¶ Even it is at 4 Star Hotel, price range is very reasonable‚Ä¶. Pizzas and pastas starting at 200 bucks with chicken kebab items too at the range of 200 and hookah starting at 250 bucks.

Starting with Hookah.. Lovely ..!! It lasted very long .. We took two hookah, both are nice. Both brain freezer and rasna flavors are nice. Looking forward to visit this place again with my close buddies for chilling out again.

Another attraction is that they having a live kitchen at that place with barbeque arrangements too. The seating capacity is around 50.

The food and drinks that I loved the most was Afghani Tikka, Continental Sizzler, BBQ Chicken and Chinese Sizzler. If you are a non vegetarian I will suggest to have Aghani tikka and BBQ Chicken at this place. Highly Recommended.

Creating a new buzz in the city,De sovrani launched their stupendous and incredible SKY VIEW CAFE.
The view of the city from this place is breath taking.
If you visit this place at the time of sunset you can experience the beautiful sky painted with different colours and this view is gonna leave you awestruck.
With stunning view ,this place doesn't lag behind in offering appetizing food.
You can choose from their wide range of assorted cocktails & mocktails or opt for some perfectly grilled succulent kebabs.Each of their dish is equally lip smacking.

Their quirky decor with dim lighting will set your mood right for a great evening.The vibrant coloured bottles painted with funky designs adds a fun element to the ambiance.
The staff was extremely helpful and courteous.
Sky view cafe is located on the 9th floor of hotel de sovrani,5 mins walk from City centre 1.

Coming to the lip smacking food we ordered:-

DRINKS:-
‚ô°Sunset-It was a fruit juice based mocktail with a mix of red and orange colour and looked exactly like  sunset.
‚ô°Painkiller-This is a pineapple based cocktail with a strong flavour of nutmeg.
‚ô°Blue moon and dark night-Another lovely drink with 2 layers of colour. Base was of green colour and top was of brown colour.
‚ô°Fresh lime soda-Perfectly done sweet lime soda.
‚ô°Spicy mojito-Mojito combined with the freshness of pudina and a dash of spices was added to give a nice flavour .

GRILLED DELICACY :-
‚ô°Tandoori Aloo-Baby potatoes mixed with spices and grilled perfectly.It had a nice flavour and freshness of coriander.This was served with onion rings and pudina chutney.
‚ô°BBQ Pineapple-Never thought that pineapple would taste so yum when grilled.This was a totally new dish and i was so fascinated by the taste. The pineapple pieces tasted both sweet and spicy at the same time.
‚ô°Afghani chicken-Tender and juicy chicken pieces marinated with spices and grilled to perfection.The plating was amazing with onion rings and a dash of lemon.
‚ô°BBQ Chicken-Chicken satay seasoned and skewered on a tandoor.

SIZZLER:-
1.Continental sizzler-Flavoured rice served with chicken satay sticks.The presentation was beautiful and tasted delicious
2.Chinese sizzler-Noodles served with a concoction of different types of vegetables and served atop cabbage bowl.

PIZZA & PASTA
‚ô°Margarita pizza-Laded with cheese and veggies ,it tasted nice. The one thing that i did not like in this pizza was the base. The base tasted like the one available in stores.
‚ô°Penne pasta-The pasta was cooked perfectly but the flavour was not upto the mark.

The prices was reasonable.The main thing that i liked about was the dishes were beautifully plated.
So head to this awesome place and enjoy the romantic weather with yummy dishes.
Kudos to the team for great service and food.
Would love to visit again.

üçÅFresh lime soda-- This was the sweet and salty end to the evening.

You can even witness the live grilling of meat and the whipping up of the fresh pasta salads from the chef.The hookah is one more special mention from this joint.Light flavours ranging from grape and double apple to strong ones are available.My pick would be the house special ---Brainfreezer.

Rooftop caf√© is one of the trending things, which the people of City of Joy is witnessing for recent few years! And in that trending crown, Team De Sovrani added their name few days ago by launching their own rooftop caf√© named as SKY VIEW CAFE.

Visited this restaurant on its opening day with bunch f my foodie friends.

The restaurant located at the 9th floor of the Hotel De Sovrani, near CC1. So be ready to explore the city from its heart.

Now come to the point, why you choose this Caf√© -

1. One of the affordable Rooftop caf√© in the city.

2. Enjoy the surrounding view of The City of Joy with some lip smacking food.

3. Cheap Hookah counter, probably the cheapest in the Saltlake area.

4. Wide range of food, from Kebab to Pizza everything is available there.

5. Live counter for food.

The food we tried were -¬†

1. Sunset - Fruit juice based mocktail with the perfect colouration of sunset. Orange juice infusion was really noticeable..
2. Painkiller - Pineapple juice based drink with mild flavour. Okey okay type it was.
3.Margarita Pizza - Small sized pizza served with lots of cheese on top. Just add little oregano ans chilli flakes and you are ready to go.
4. Tandoori Aloo - Grilled aloo with spicy coating over top was served with onion and green chutney. The coriander touch over it makes is super tasty. Must try item for Veg lovers.
5. Penne Pasta - As the have live pasta counter, so you will get huge types of option according to your taste. We decided to go for Penne with red sauce. It was good in taste but I feel the lack of creamy flavour into it.
6. Pineapples Kebab - This was the first time I have tried such dish. The pineapple pieces were litely grilled and the sour touch of the fruit added some exceptional taste into it.
7. Afghani Chicken - Six pieces juicy soft chicken pieces were served in a plate with green chutney. The Chicken were all juicy, tender and well marinated. Love the taste.
8. BBQ Chicken - Spicy flavoured six pieces chicken were served in very decorative way. The BBQ flavour was intact in the chicken and there were toothpick, piercing the chicken pieces. Nice as a quick bite item.
9. Blue Moon and dark night - Another bi-coloured mocktail served in very careful way. The Pepsi infusion in the drink added the black coloured ring inside the glass. Love it.
10. Fresh Lime Soda - Plain lime soda with traditional taste. Not so special about it.
11. Spicy Mojito - Classic flavoured Mojito served with lots of spices and mint leaves. The taste of the Mojito may get lost a little bit, but the masala infusion was really well.
12. Chinese Sizzler - Portion of noodles were swerved with with lots of veggies. The noodles and veggies were beautifully presented in a cabbage nest. The taste was good like itz look.
13. Continental Sizzler - Portion of rice was served with six pieces of chicken sticks and assorted veggies. The rice was well cooked and the chicken sticks were heavenly in nature.

Overall food quality were good and when you compare the price tag with the quality of the food, you will find it amazing.

So when you are getting so much options at a single place, why miss it? And good news is yet to end! To keep this launching party memorable, Team De Sovrani gave us full 20% discount our bill.

So think later and be a part of a memorable journey because Sky View Caf√© is always there to serve you some quality time with quality foods. Overall an good dining experiences.

Imagine snoozing in a mouthful of hookah and thereafter facing vertically 90 degrees upwards to snooze out, only to realize that the sight you can see is a hazy evening, a rising moon and a few dim-lit stars ‚Äì instead of the false ceiling you always see at a closed space inside any hookah bar or caf√©!

Just the thought of this makes us go berserk! And yes, this is what defines the experience at the newest addition to Kolkata based cafes ‚Äì we present to you the ‚ÄúSky View Caf√©‚Äù. In a city with severe lack of roof top experience-providing outlets, the SVC is welcomed with open hands!

Strength of the place is approx. 40-odd heads and believe me that the place was fully packed on the weekday evening we visited them, only God knows how they handle the weekend crowds!

Location ‚Äì Roof top of the popular De Sovrani Hotel bang opposite City Center 1 (Saltlake, Sector 1).

We foodies had the below items at this recently launched caf√©: -

(i)	Sunset (Mocktail) ‚Äì This seemed more like a welcome drink ‚Äì a juice based mocktail!

(ii)	Pizza ‚Äì Under-grilled multi-grain pizzas served with overflowing mozzarellas, loads of yellow and green capsicums and other veggies was a winner, especially when had with oregano seasonings and chilly flakes!

(iii)	Tandoori Aloo - Served with lachcha onions and mint chutney, these were so nice to be eaten as if there exists no tomorrow, the coriander toppings doing perfect justice to its taste as well as presentation!

(iv)	Penne pasta ‚Äì Can never have enough of this dish ‚Äì had both the red sauce as well as white sauce ones ‚Äì still unable to decide which one was better! Thanks for the spaghetti and corn too!

(v)	Pineapple kebabs ‚Äì Hands down the best I have ever eaten in my life, a touch sour than other restros generally serve. Optimum spices and sauces made this just the perfect pineapple-a-kebab!

(vi)	Blue moon (Mocktail) ‚Äì May be this is the brother of the ‚ÄúBlue Lagoon‚Äù mocktail, but tastes equally good, if not more!

(vii)	Blue Moon and dark night (Mocktail) ‚Äì Pepsi imbibed to the above mocktail, imparting it just the perfect presentation, and also the taste! 

(viii)	Fresh lime (Sweet) ‚Äì Was so well prepared, I had the same in a single go!

(ix)	Chilly Paneer sizzler ‚Äì Could not have asked for something better, this one was indeed the show stopper, saut√©ed vegetables with paneer along with lovely noodles, think 10 times before eating, since this sizzler is just too hot and tasty to handle!

In a nutshell, expect exceptional food and ambience at reasonable prices! Their service and food presentation stand out from the rest in the industry!

Some big congratulations to the De Sovrani Hotel for the latest feather in their cap and wishing them loads of success!

It's astoundingly refreshing to view the city from the rooftop while buzzing on the great hukkah served here. The service is great and the food was delightful. If you are looking for a chill evening, this is the place to be.
