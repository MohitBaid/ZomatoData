Has been one of the most consistent eateries in the Ballygunge place area.  The momo,  soups,  kebabs and the chicken cutlets are amazing and have surprisingly retained their taste for years.

Great finger food at affordable price.specially the prawns and the fried stuff are really good. The rolls are very nice dry unlike other which soaked in oil so its very healthy.

One of my all time favourites. Whenever I am in the neighbourhood I visit this place. The food is awesome light with a little tinge of spice. The people are super friendly and so is the manager. Only let down the place doesn't has proper seating arrangements but then it is overshadoweded by their prompt delivery service.

Baked N Fried is a household name in Ballygunj if you have been living here for 10+ years. The delivery and takeout joint has a maximum seating of 10, but serves 300 customers a night. In the evening, on weekends, you can find more cars sitting outside Baked N Fried than outside the adjacent Chowman. Baked N Fried provides a large Chinese menu filled with equally delicious dishes. However, my favourites are Egg Chicken Roll and the Veg Gravy Chow that some believe it to be the best in Kolkata. For me the Egg Chicken Roll comes only second to Zeeshan's Egg Roll. I started eating Gravy Chow from Baked N Fried and I prefer no other. Traveling with 50 feet of this joint will seduce you with the smell of Eggs frying on the Pan or Noddles being sent for delivery. It is a must try for any one who has the taste of (Indianized) Chinese. üëåüëå

Digged in at this place with a friend searching for some quick bite before the meeting. Looked at this place at the Ballygunge Place jusr near to Chowman with some handful of Chinese dishes.¬†
Ambiance is nothing ¬†interesting to talk about and but they have quite ¬†a variety in their menu card for your offerings. Just tried their Chicken Steam Momo with Soup. It was big in size, quality was decent and the coating was also fine, just a little disappointed with the fillings inside which was less in quantity at that price. Soup was very average didnt liked it so much.

Me and my friend had reached early for a meeting. Noticed this place, checked zomato, read more or less good reviews and decided to try their food!
It is a small, small shop with no AC. Limited seating arrangements. The place runs on take away and home deliveries. The prices are not so much on the lower side. Tried their chicken momo. The sizes were good. each plate had 5 pieces accompanied with some soup.

Have been ordering take out since I was a kid.
They have maintained the quality through all these years.
I have friends who will come to kolkata and first thing they demand is order chicken cutlet from this joint.
Their sweet corn chicken soup is really good. Veg Manchurian balls are tasty. I love their fish Manchurian too.

its less than 100 mts from my place and the prime reason behind every lb of fat I've accumulated over the years. their chicken cutlet is to die for. same goes for their lollypops... even with the brouhaha around with the growing chains of unworthy eateries, this place keeps its head high. Real high. check it out for yourself. and to top it all, the owner, Mr. Mukherjee stikes the most cordial of cords :) .

This is an old joint run by Mr.mukherjee who is an ex hotelier.there is not too much seating room as this is more of a takeaway joint. 
The fish fry using betki served with mustard sauce and onions is great.the manchow soup is always excellent. The chili fish,green chili prawns,noodles,drums of heaven are notable items in their menu.the food here is mostly Chinese and they serve rolls as well which are average. Air-conditioning and seating arrangements are lacking. However this joint in ballygunge place next to chowman is a good option for a bite or takeaway on the go

Not to be confused with new chain Baked & Fried... I am visiting this place for the last 20 years since I was a child... My parents love this place and I inherited their loyalty for the chicken cutlet of Baked N Fried...

Try their chicken cutlet- that's their expertise... Mr. Mukherjee, who is running this place for I don't know, may be 25-30 years or more, is an excellent person to have a chat with... He will give you proper guidance on what to chose and he is, himself, a great foodie...

To tell you the truth there's nothing on the menu that is baked, everything is fried @ Baked N Fried. I have been a complete fan of this place for the last two decades. A household name across Ballygunge, most people do a takeaway from the small counter diagonally opposite 6 Ballygunge place. Nothing has changed in the last 2 decades - the gentleman at the counter looks the same, the taste of all their items has been consistently great and it continues to beat inflation and be a pocket friendly joint.

If picking up evening snacks you just have to have the chicken cutlet, fish fingers, rolls and chili prawn dry. The fries will be served with some salad and kasundi. They have introduced momos but their fries are still the hero.

If packing dinner, try their thick soups- coriander or sweet corn, the noodles and rice are both good and have many options. The chilli chi ken dry and their prawn dishes require a special mention.

Now for the secret tip: if you have people coming over and want to serve hot fish fries and mutton cutlets, ask Baked N Fried to make them ready for you absolutely till the last stage of coating with crumbs. You can pick them up in the evening and fry the snacks just as your guests arrive. Enjoy!!!

A great value for money for people who prefer car service, have been visiting this place since the past 4-5years. The place is grounded in a very quite locality with abundant car parking. The chilly chicken served here is high on flavor and quality so it's a must try and so are the chicken steamed monos. Do visit this place if you want a quick meal. Service isn't very good due to shortage of employees but self service helps at times.

This place = much looked forward childhood evenings. No trip to Kolkata was complete without a roll or momos or chowmein from here. Music may be nostalgia for the heart and mind but this place is nostalgia for my tummy!

I've had food home delivered, done take aways and eaten there. Service is usually so quick and the food, oily it may be, is filling and quintessential bong street food. Don't miss the momos, chicken rolls, fish cutlets and the various Chinese main courses here. Prices have increased over the years but the taste of their rolls is unnaturally consistent.

If you're in the area and hungry, head to this cute place located on the same street as Chowman. Be it baked or fried - your tummy will thank you.

What Baked N Fried lacks in ambience and service, it more than makes up for it with quality, affordability and taste. The ever frazzled yet always warm owner has ensured consistently that the wait for your food is well worth it. Be it snacks like spring rolls, drumsticks and cutlets or the Chinese stuff like Shanghai Prawn, Dry Chilli Chicken, Mixed Fried Rice and Gravy Chowmein, food here is wholesome and value for money. It's the good old dependable para takeaway that I swear by and would continue to as comfort food could come out of boxes and foils, and that is no mean feat.

The best food joints I have ever seen in last 15 years.Be it starters or main course excellent quality and taste. The best part is that so many food joints have come up in the same lane during the last 5 to 6 years but Mr Mukherjee had never compromised with the quality. Also the monetary aspect.Excellent behaviour and customer service. While writing this review I can well hear Mr Mukherjee 's voice "hain bolun Mrs Lahiri order ta ki.subhankar tara tari pack kor delivery dite hobe 10 Mandeville Garden Flat no 203".Three cheers for TEAM BAKED AND FRIED.

A decent place to hang out with your friends when your pocket is not much full.
Taste is very good specially the momo and chicken lollipop is just wow! :)

Once a great stop for quick bites but with other snacks outlet opening up in the locality this one is lagging behind. However it still serves great cutlets and rolls to its small but dedicated customers.

Same old baked and fried. The decor here is not as imressive as the Kasba one..
But the food makes up for it.
The chicken nuggets of whom you get 20 for 250/- is the biggest delight of this place.
Also tried the Chicken Cold Cut Sub which was really good!
The best part-- you get coke for 40/- (a bottle of 600 ml i mean!) 
The service is very satisfactory. The staff is courteous.
A food chain that can do wonders if marketed more!
All the best! :)

Have frequented this joint since the past 20 years and know the owner very well. The fish fries and chicken cutlets are mouth-watering. If you are looking for a simple roll that preserves all the flavors without using a lot of oil and accessories, this is the place. All the food is hygenically prepared. The mandarin chicken, chili chicken dry and fish with vegetables are my personal favorites. The only con is the long wait especially if you are going to pick your food up yourself. Highly recommend this place!

Very old joint have been around for over a decade or longer. It is a small take away joint with nice chicken cutlet and fish fries and some nice soup and starters like friend chicken and so on. 
Good and hygienic food freshly prepared and fried and served I front of u.

A very old joint.. Which I must say is not posh... But provide you with a smattering of mouth watering delicacies.... Try the rolls, fish fries, fish fingers.. Chilly chicken and the chicken cutlet... 
This place has no pretensions and just provides good food at a very economical price

The rating i have given is just for the momos i had, me n my friend were craving for momos and this place cropped up in my head, so we went there and ordered one steam momo and one pan fried, it was yummy. The steam momo was perfect and the pan fried was hot and garlicky just as we like it. The soup with the momo had too much oil in it but momos were the heroes.

These people probably have some of the best Chinese fast food you'll ever have in South Kolkata - starting from their spring rolls to their soups and the cutlets.I personally didn't really like the main course, too small portions for such a price.But the drumsticks are actually good. The ambiance is pretty nice, except for the service. The wait for food is painful, and arduous, especially if it's a long order. But it's somehow worth all that.

Believe it or not, this joint serves the best drumsticks in hot garlic sauce in all of calcutta. I can personally vouch for it. The service is a tad bit slow but its well worth the wait. If you happen to find yourself at this mostly take-away joint, be sure to order the drunsticks. Simply fab!

This fast food joint serves the best egg chicken rolls in the area. The mixed fried rice and the accompanying chicken items (manchurian, garlic, schezwan) are a joy to taste. The fish fry and the chicken cutlet is filled with meat and really yummy. I particularly love the chicken drumsticks and the dry chilli chicken they make!

BAKED AND FRIED, for a person¬†living in Ballygunge Place or adjoining areas this place has been a delight since ages. Things to try out here for sure include Chicken Roll, Dry Chilli Chicken, and Chicken Drumsticks in Hot Garlic Sauce, Chicken Cutlet, Chicken Fries, and Fish Fry. Though the people have changed with time but this place feels the same with exactly the same old ambience and the food.

I've grown up with their chicken cutlet and chicken sweet corn soup. Every time I go back home, to kolkata baked and fried is always on my list. Brings back a lot of memories and I am so glad that they have kept up the quality of their food over all these years.

This is another old timer restoin Ballygunge Place.It is there around 20years.It is also a take away joint.The quantity of food is quiet nice sufficient for 2 people.The speciality there diff types of rolls , chicken  cutlet nd all kind of chicken starter is excellent. Just remember my childhood days in Durga Puja we all cousins collect money frm our parents nd used to go there to eat.Specially our family also order food from there as the owner of this shop Sam Uncle knws our family very well.They will deliver the food as quick as it is possible.

I just love their Chicken cutlet.. Just perfect in texture and taste.. Though they serve a variety of rolls and fried items.. But that didnt excite me much.. you get better elsewhere but the Chicken cutlet has no comparison.. This is a small yet very popular place in Ballygunge place.. and you will find good crowd in the evenings.. Just try once and you will never regret..

Located opposite the 6 Ballygunge Place, Baked and Fried is a small food joint. You may miss it at first but stop where you see a big crowd of people. The place is always packed with people, the reason being good quality and quantity of food. The good options to try are the hot n sour soup, pan fried chilli chicken/fish, pepper chicken, fish finger and the rolls. The bill doesn't burn a hole in your pocket and they also offer a free home delivery service. The disadvantages of this place are it's really crowded, almost no free parking space availability and no place to sit and eat.

This is another old timer resto, which is there for 15+ years at least, from when I started eating here. Being a Patha-Bhavan Student , I used to have quick snacks (Chicken Roll, Mutton Roll, Cutlet, Soup, Chowmin) here. 

There used to one chowmin plate, shared by 2 people.  
The service is always quick here, and the owner with his ever smiling face, welcomes you all the time.

This place has been a staple for more than 10 years now. The stretches in and around Ballygunge Place  has seen the mushrooming of fast food outlets as well as proper restaurants over the last 4-5 years and yet Baked and Fried holds it own among loyalists and those looking for a quick bite. Their rolls are definitely delicious. Try out the Fish Tandoori roll for sure. Other attractions are the staple fusion snacks such Pepper Chicken, drumsticks etc. They serve decent Chinese. The presence of a more glitzy and well-reviewed Chinese specialty restaurant right beside it does not seem to have cut down its sales. Worth a try for food enthusiasts.

This place is nice for rolls and cutlets .... came upon it by chance and now stop by on and off whenever I am in the vicinity to grab a bite. They make quite a decent Chicken Roll and I also quite like their Chicken Cutlet. The fish fry is not bad either and I have had it a couple of times but the Chicken Cutlet is what I personally prefer here. Tried the Boneless Chilly Chicken as well and it was not bad. However the service is slow so don't order if your in a hurry they take time but because the food is good people are willing to wait it out.

Nice place to get your evening snacks from. Delicious mutton rolls and egg rolls which are quite filling. The fries used to be a lot better in the mid-90s but are still good enough. I guess the introduction and addition of Chinese dishes due to popular demand has diluted their excellence in the Deep Fries (Fish fry, Chicken Cutlets etc) department.

We decided to take away from here and ordered 2 plate of chicken drumsticks and four chicken rolls for takeaway. The queue was not very long, but still we had to wait a considerable period of time before they actually gave us our order. Although we loved the food, especially the drums of heavens which was quite good, we really did not like the waiting time.

I have resided in Ballygunge phari for more than a year and this place being at stone throw distance was my obvious choice for a quick snack and take away for dinner. Their rolls are quite good,at par with the ones in gariahat. The only thing i always missed was moglai paratha which isn't available here. Other than snacks,they have quite a few Chinese items on the menu which are good enough given the prices are quite low. Nice place for paying guests and lazy cooks who always like to pack some food home! \m/

Baked & Fried, It brings a lot of nostalgic feelings. Back in early 1990s when this food joint was opened, it was among the very few food joints in entire Ballygunge. It opened as a take away counter and remained like that. 
Those days the food seemed quite expensive, but now it seems on the more reasonable. But good thing is that the quality has not decreased much. 
Service, is a point of concern; the cooks take a whole lot of time to complete any order. 

Stewed noodle and chicken with babycorn are the dishes i had last, and found it quite relishing.

Possibly the best Pan-Fried Momos (I like them with friend rice). I love their Chicken Cutlet, Chicken Coriander Soup and Tandoori Fish Roll (with Kashundi). Also try their stewed Singapore noodles. The place is reasonably priced, but its service needs improvement.
