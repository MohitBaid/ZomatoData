A perfect Fast Food joint.
Hope Foodies know the definition of 'fast food'.
And yeah,food served here is really fast.You do not have to wait much.And its unhealthy,but equally unhealthy.
To justify my rating of 5,i must say that this joint is connected with the Bawarchi group and the do serve good and TASTY FAST FOOD.The most important part for all the JU students and other students or public is that this is highly economical.Pocket pinch is minimal.
Times do come when you search for a bite at just 20 to 50 bucks.Do try this joint.
Kebabs,Rolls and combo packs are really good.

This is one of the jounts that stands absolutely at the centre point of Jadavpur. It is absolutely a place where you can grab and go. The open kitchen is a bit of a concern. I love their tandoori chicken. Rolls are a bit oily. But overall food quality seemed moderate to me. I think you guys can try. Parking is a big hassle. Also, it feels as if we are standing in an ocean of people, got to be careful.

Today On 13th July 2017 Me And My Friends Arnab De And Debottam Dasgupta Have Visited This Place Bazeegar, Jadavpur For The 1st Time. And We Ordered 2 Veg Rolls For Rs. 20/- Each. I Had The Full Roll And The Shopkeeper Divided The Other Roll Into 2 Half Pieces Apart. One For My Friend Arnab De And Another One For Debottam Dasgupta. Located Near Jadavpur 8B Bus Stand And Near Jadavpur Supermarket As Well. This Joint's Name Bazeegar Is Related To A Film Baazigar 1993 Of Shah Rukh Khan. We Enjoyed Eating The Rolls Together. So Thank you Arnab De And Bazeegar For Making Our Day Fabulous.

Located opposite to the CIT market, Jadavpur this small fast food stall is always crowded as the nearby school & college students can nullify their hunger with rolls, chowmein, fried rice or different kinds of pakoras at very low price.
The food is very average here. I didn't like the chicken roll & the quality of fried rice, chilli chicken is also below average. I have taken chicken biriyani also serveral times & was ok at just Rs 75.¬†
But I don't like to come here now as there are far better places for quick bite

Some very good rolls. 

The place is recognized for serving fried items, including a fare share of rolls. What makes there rolls a hit is the paratha. They are nice and flaky, with distinctive layers. 

Another thing that I usually order when here is the fish fry. The last time we were here, was on Holi afternoon. While almost the rest of Jadavpur was closed down, this place was open. We stopped by for a fish fry, which we decided would be divided among three, but we soon ordered two more.

Bazeegar is located near Jadavpur 8B bus stand. This is a small store selling a variety of items with cuisines ranging from mughlai to chinese. I am a frequent visitor of this store. They sometimes provide two tools to sit, sometimes they don't. The food is good. I hv tried their chilli chicken and fried rice combo, chicken fry, chicken lollypop etc. I loved every food item. No other store gives so much of chilli chicken and fried rice at 55 rupees. The owner of the store is suave and well behaved. The staff is a bit forgetful at times. I will definitely visit again.

Oily, unhealthy, deep fried meats is basically what you get here. But as unhealthy food is ridiculously tasty, Bazeegar never has a dearth of customers. There's always a queue for their rolls (which by the way, are not as great as they used to be). But I would not recommend their biriyani, as there are far too many better options around this area.

A tiny food joint at Jadavpur 8B. The snacks and biriyani here are nothing to speak highly about. But, i have been mesmerized by their specialty Hubba Roll. It is a large roll stuffed with a special potato filling and minced boiled egg. It tastes totally different from the regular rolls that you get at every fast food joint in the city. It is surprisingly filling. Easily said, it is lunch for 30 rs. I go back again and again for this favorite roll of mine. If you haven't already, then do try it once.

When Bazeegar started selling at Jadavpur, they were the ones with one of the unique food items in the area... Bhomra fry, Hubba roll, jumbo sized cutlets etc.. Had so many delicious Hubba rolls in my college days.. But over time the quality has degraded with more oil and less taste.. But still some of the stuffs still taste good.. You can still go for Hubba rolls and the chicken cutlets..!!!

Jadavpur has now become a stop during my college to tuition journeys and thanks to Zomato, I have found out enough places here to satisfy my gastronomical cravings without spending a fortune!

Location:near Jadavpur 8B bus stand,this place is very easy to find.

Ambience: It's a small kiosk(who gives printed payment slips,though!) with few stools in front (and consider yourself quite lucky if you get a seat!)
Hygiene-pagol public, you can definitely give this a miss!

Food: Nothing out of the box, this is just another roll and chowmein shop but what makes it popular is the Hubba Roll. At 30 bucks, you get a big(yeah,quite big) egg roll with mashed potato and onions as its filling. Wait, there is more to it! A boiled egg is also cut into pieces and put inside the roll as a part of the filling. This makes the roll a mini meal in itself. It was quite tasty too and given our generation's love for chicken and eggs, this is really a special treat :D
I am definitely going to try the chatpata chicken kababs the next day I visit Jadavpur!
All in all, a hungry fellow in Jadavpur who loves eggs?Go for Hubba roll, you will definitely shout Hurrah for Hubba! :P

I never expected to find this small joint on Zomato so I did not click any pics. Anyways, this place is located near 8B bus stand. Went there many times in the past. I liked their egg rolls and Tikia rolls. They give laccha paratha for their rolls. But the thing I experienced in last visits, I have decided not to go there any more. 
Last day I went to 8B and needed something to munch on. So I went to this place and ordered a egg roll, all the staffs were relaxing and asked for 21 rupees as the manager was not there to give change. I agreed and I changed my order to egg veg roll for 26 rupees. The roll tasted good, I moved away from the shop and when I was about to finish the roll I found a housefly in it. It was a horrible experience. You need to watch out while eating. I have planned not to go there. Keep an open eye while eating.

I wud rather say try rolls than Chinese dishes. Their special roll is Hubba roll. It is nice. Nothing very special though. Altogether, a normal fastfood joint to safe ur stomach from hunger.

The quick grab and run Bazeegar outlet situated beside the Jadavpur (8B) rickshaw stand has been one of my most frequented takeaway counters in the area, primarily because I love their rolls. The perfect flakiness of the paratha they make is the USP (for me, of course), alongside the tender chicken filling. 

At the same time, I would not recommend the fish cutlets, chops or the momos. Also, they have a very economical lunch box during the afternoon. Added to the extremely pocket friendly nature of the menu, this lunch box is decent. 
Bazeegar is a nice place for a quick snack on the go or if the budget is running low. :)

Ambience:- road side eatry hence no ambience. But they have a wide variety of items on their menu. Don't knw how they manage it in such a small place.

 Food :- 
Hubba roll:- the most renouned and unique item of this place. Tasty and oil free light on stomach.

 Pocket pinch -100-200 for two

Conclusion :- right place to have a quick bite when ur low on pocket money.

Bazeegar has been a savior for years whenever we were immensely hungry and, or substantially out of cash. We go there mostly for the epic Hubba roll which is a truly ingenious creation of theirs. Priced at 30 rupees only, one roll is equivalent to a meal. It is basically a double egg roll in a much better way. The paratha is first fried with the egg beaten on top, and then comes the yummy potato filling which is accompanied by slices of a boiled egg. The other rolls are strictly normal. Once we‚Äôd tried the chicken fry and didn‚Äôt like it that much. Hence, the next time you‚Äôre hungry and in Jadavpur, just go for the Hubba roll.  Take a bite and you‚Äôll know for sure, why it‚Äôs called that! :)

This busy snacks point is located near 8B Bus Stand. It remains crowded. No sitting arrangement. While you are having your food , try not to block the shop next door. Owner put this notice outside. So you have to stand like beggar until they finished your order. I didn't enjoy any item here. Quality is mostly on the downside. I wont suggest this food corner to anyone.

One of those places which were an integral part of my college life. Just a stone's throw away from 8B bus stand, this was the chosen destination for the various mini-treats and the occasional evening-time indulges. Discussing matters trivial or important, while waiting for one of their piping rolls, remains one of my fondest memories of that phase. 

The chicken and egg rolls were usually what we went for, with the occasional egg devil when pocket money was on the shorter side. And the rolls were as good as what you would get in any decent shop in the city. The service was always pretty prompt, and the prices quite manageable for regular college goers surviving on weekly allowances. 

PS: I always wanted to try out their 'vomra fry', which they advertised so proudly, but never managed to. I do wonder what it is about.

A small snack joint at jadavpur. Had chicken lollipop from there today as i was having hunger pangs. Service is quite good and packaging too. Very hygienic inspite of being a roadside place. Chicken lollipops were huge. And pricing is okay. Good choice for having light snacks as they offer quite a number of them to choose from:-)

Well if u r really hungry and u r mad about eggs then hubba roll is the ideal thing to try. Others items of this place is also quite good considering the price they charge.

This busy food joint is located just opposite the CIT Market , near 8B Bus Stand. It remains crowded always as it is situated in a good position.  It does not have any sitting arrangement. While you are having your food , try not to block the shop next door. Owner of this adjacent shop has put up a notice :p. 
We had two egg rolls and one fish fry. The fish fry was not bad but we did not enjoy our rolls. They added extra sauce in our rolls and the entire taste got marred. In my opinion , it is quite mediocre joint. Still it remained top crowd puller because of its strategic position.

Do you want to enjoy a lavish meal just by spending a few hundred bucks? Well, then step into Bazeegar restaurant, located on Central Road (beside Cube Centre), Jadavpur, Kolkata.  Just at the turn of an alley, you‚Äôll find this restaurant, hidden from the crowd. But those who discover this place get to taste delicious food at very reasonable rates.  As for me, I discovered this place recently. Actually I went to a friend‚Äôs house in that area and while returning home, I took a different turn and walked past this restaurant. At first I was bit surprised to find a restaurant here. Who would at all make an effort to look for a restaurant in a winding alley in Jadavpur? My first thoughts were to walk past it, ignoring it for another roadside eatery. But, on second thoughts, being a little curious, I decided to drop in and try a few titbits. 

I was taken aback on entering this restaurant. It was well-lit up and well-decorated. What appeared to be a shanty little place from outside was indeed a cute and cosy little restaurant with a few vacant tables. I found myself a corner seat. Once comfortably seated, I placed an order for fish butter fry and spring chicken. The food arrived within 15 minutes and that impressed me. (Usually you have to wait for almost half an hour for your food to arrive). Hot and crispy, I really liked the fish and chicken. The fish was so tasty that it nearly melted in my mouth. Yes, this was a place where I could enjoy a sumptuous meal without burning a hole in my pocket. It was already 9 p.m. and I decided to dine there straight away. My dinner menu comprised of chicken fried rice and hot manchurian chicken. Both the items were delicious. To be very frank, I was not expecting such good food from such a small place.  After all, most of us are prejudiced against small eateries. 

Anyway, I enjoyed my dinner. Infact I licked my platter clean. And when my bill arrived, it was nothing. Just a few hundred bucks, absolutely nothing for a lavish meal. Most of you, who haven‚Äôt been to this restaurant, just rush in there. It‚Äôs quite a decent place to enjoy a decent meal at a decent rate.

To hungry souls who have no money in their pocket but a big appetite, Bazeegar is paradise indeed. Recently, I visited a friend near 8B and on my way, decided to pack some food along with me. Although I was thinking of getting the Hubba roll, in the end, the carnivore in me rebelled and I got the egg chicken roll, fish fry and mutton roll, after making a quick call and asking my friends what they wanted. 

I got the egg chicken roll, and it was exactly how I wanted it - with loads of chillies, perfectly fried egg, well-made paratha, and lebu. NO icky sauces in it. My friend was very happy with the mutton roll, and did not want to share. We both had the fish fry, and declared it to be the one which did not live up to the mark.

The 8B area in Jadavpur is a paradise for foodies. From low footpath stalls to medium cabins to high restaurants, the area is jam packed with eateries. The Bazeegar fast food centre is one of them, situated on central road just across the road from the Jadavpur Minicipal Market building. It's a narrow slit in the wall which runs in the name of a shop. There are no seats, not even a stool. The pavement is crowded so stand carefully. It's a popular place, so you must wait for a bit. 

The USP of this place is the Hubba roll, which they have introduced months back. The rolls have garnered such a popularity that the establishment is now almost exclusively known for them. "Hubba" in common colloquial parlance means to be supremely astounded to the point where you start feeling like a fool. Or to be left speechless. You certainly will be a hubba after you have the namesake roll.

Classification of the roll :- Larger in size than regular rolls, its made of 2 eggs; one battered and fried into the side of the roll and the other fried cut and added to the mixture inside. The mixture includes potato,onions and other vegetables cooked perfectly. A special sauce is also added. A few even drops of 'lebu' provide the finish
They also serve all the regular rolls, chowmein and mughlai dishes common to all fast food centres. 

Chakraborty tip : Do not stand in front of the shop next door. It's owner is apparently angry of people spilling out in front of his shop.

Do you want to enjoy a sumptuous dinner or a delicious luncheon at a nice restaurant without burning a hole in your pocket? Well, just drop in at Bazeegar on Central Road, (beside Cube Centre) Jadavpur. Tucked up in a corner of an alley, Bazeegar is one of the affordable and good restaurants in South Kolkata. If you have a few hundred rupees in your pocket and cannot afford to eat in an expensive food joint, you can easily enjoy a delicious meal at Bazeegar. While studying at Jadavpur University, we (my friends and I) were always on the lookout for some inexpensive restaurant where we could enjoy lip-smacking north Indian and Chinese dishes at nominal rates. 

We have eaten in Bazeegar many times. The place is small and cozy and has a nice ambience. What makes Bazeegar different from any mediocre restaurant is its quality food. Sometimes we used to drop in there to enjoy some tasty snacks. Bazeegar offers some mouthwatering chicken cutlet, chicken lollypop, fish fry, fish butter fry and prawn balls. I particularly like their chicken biryani, red hot kaichi chicken, red hot pepper chicken and tandoori chicken. What else do you want when you can get delicious food in good quantities at very reasonable prices! Bazeegar also has a takeaway facility. Just place your order and get your steaming hot food parcels within half an hour! 

Bazeegar has a special provision in their menu card - their office pack or home pack.  You can either get a non-veg food pack or a veg food pack at nominal rates. This place is perfect for all office goers and students, who look for food joints that offer mouthwatering tiffin packs at reasonable rates.  The next time you are near the Jadavpur area and feel ravenously hungry do not hesitate to enter this restaurant and try their mouthwatering delicacies!
