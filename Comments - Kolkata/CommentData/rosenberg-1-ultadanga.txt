One of the most underated restaurants in Calcutta that offers great Chinese food..! The ambience is really nice...N staff well mannered.
The food is really tasty n fresh... quantity is sufficient too...worth the money. Try some of the unconventional dishes...u won't b disappointed.... 
Just one suggestion, please revamp the washroom. It's really needed.

Decor is nice and romantic. Situated in a proper market place next to ultadanga overbridge... They also provide candle light dinner experience. But coming to food i didnt find it as expected. Prices are somewhat reasonable but taste is not that good, chicken pieces are quite small and not even fresh.. But though liked the fried rice

I think its so far one of the best restaurants i had lunch in. From the ambience to the food nd the songs, each and every detail was looked after very minutely. Its a little gem situated in ultadanga near the foot bridge. I wud recommend this place to any person having a young heart. Its a nice cozy place to be wid ur better half.
P.S : the candlelight makes the ambience even more romantic. I'd definitely recommend this to everyone.

For the first time, I ordered from Rosenburg. I heard about this restro. Specially about their food quality. Now, come to the food. What we ordered?? We ordered Mixed Fried Rice & Mixed Noodles gravy. My expectation was bit high But I felt bad when I saw quantity of Mixed fried rice. But taste was ok but not so good as per price. Noodles was ok bt same gravy was less. Staffs are all very well. Their packing system is very well presentable. Infact they are provides refreshment mint in parcel. 3 Star rating is perfect I think for Rosemburg, Ultadanga.

One of my fav resturants..  Actually its quite difficult to locate it amongs markets and grocery shops..  The resturant has some surprises for all its people..  The no 1 being the candle light dinner..  Didnt expect that..  The food are of good quality and if you like spicy foods..  Its a heaven for you..  The second surprise being the cost of the food..  Its amazingly cheap among all the surrounding resturants..  A must visit for every one..

Had a worse experience there. All the chicken side dishes we had taken was not freshly prepared. A bad smell was coming from the chicken. The rice item was way too ordinary. We have shared our views with the chef regarding the chicken dishes and he argued badly.

I am a regular at Rosenberg and have always recommended people to visit it atleast once if they are in its vicinity. The Chinese fare is quite awesome and is reasonably priced. The waiters are polite and welcoming. Special effort is made to give you the experience of a candlelight dinner. 
However, quite recently the quality of the food they serve has deteriorated. The starter that we were served was not only cold but looked as if it was prepared a lot earlier. The chicken was extremely rubbery for which the dish lost its charm. 
I would think twice before taking my loved ones there again.

It is located near Ultadanga crossing. The joint is not so spacious but a beautiful place to suppress the appetite at reasonable price. The interior decor was quit enchanting with dimmed light, hanging chandeliers and soft background music. 

We ordered chicken friedrice and chicken manchurian...both of them were good enough to fulfill my appetite. Chicken friedrice was very light not too much oily and chicken manchurian was served with 8 pieces of soft boneless chicken and gravy.
Lastly my experience was quite average.

Starter and manchuranian chicken are same kind of, no difference between them. Singapore chicken rice is irritating, like a ginger rice. Quantity is very poor. Totally dissapointed at nabami night. Environment is also disgusting. Ac is not working properly. Service is very poor. It make our mood disgusting. Price is much more costly than quality and quantity

We landed up in this place with tagline..come hungry..leave happy..
Well..we came hungry..left disappointed and hungry..
The puja special menu was limited..
We ordered food and everything arrived within minutes..it was already prepared..they read our mind wat we were trying to order..
The chicken hot and sour soup was very average..tasted so ordinary..
The chicken tossed in chilli wine sauce was very bland..so was barbeque dry chicken..both tasted same..served in different plates..
The chicken noodles was as dry as desert..not at all tasty..
The chicken manchurian was average..only dish to save my taste buds..
The bill arrived even before we asked for..even before we finished the food..
Very disappointing visit..

We ordered mainly chinese..babycorn,kimchi salad, pan-fried noodles,veg-manchurian and vanilla icecream! The kimchi salad is a must try....other items are also pretty good!

Courteous staff, quick service and decent pricing!👍

Located in the crowded & crazy Ultadanga this restaurant is a hidden oasis. It's easy to spot if you're walking on the footpath but you may miss it if you're trying to find it while inside your car! That's what happened to us at first & we opted for home delivery. They do deliver within a reasonable distance if the order amount is sufficient. Their service is excellent and hassle free. Coming to the food, the seafood here is outstanding. Each dish is customisable, so take their suggestions about tweaking the items you want to order according to your taste. Although their Indian dishes are good, I personally prefer their Chinese items.

Surprise!! Surprise!! That was my first reaction when I entered this place.. A restaurant with a candle light setting, that too amidst the rowdy streets of Ultadanga, almost unimaginable.. I loved the interiors of this place, dim lighting, slo-mo romantic tunes being played at the background, paintings on the wall all combines into a classy and elegant set-up.. Service was satisfactory, the servers were apprehensive of their specialty and service time was not long.. But I was even more surprised with the huge and interesting spread being served here starting from North Indian to Chinese to even seafood.. Since it was early evening, we ordered light meal comprising:
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup: Lacks consistency, expected better flavors.. Also the sweet corns didn’t seem to blend properly with the broth..
Mixed Hong Kong Noodles: Ordered on the server’s recommendation.. Noodles tossed in spicy, brown sauce with peanuts, proteins and veggies.. The dish has enough heat and punch to satiate the mighty-hearted..
Fish in Chili Wine Sauce Dry: One of their house specialties and it didn’t disappoint us either.. Lots of capsicums and spring onions along with some serious presence of wine.. Loved it fully..
Overall, it was a decent enough dining experience when we didn’t actually expected much.. Whenever you are feeling lazy to go far off to Park Street or South Kolkata, bored with the usual ones at Mani Square or Salt Lake, this place can spice up some serious and applaudable surprises for your family or the special one.. Our total cheque was just Rs. 520/- (all incl.) and they didn’t charge any extra tax..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5

Location:- 
                    First of all i want to mention about Location.Its very close to Ultadanga Flyover Bridge.Few steps ahead from ADI DAKHESWARI BASTRALAYA towards Ultadanga Flyover.As i was not getting the location,i called them for assisting and they assist me for the best of their ability.You have to go through a parking lot and then u have to enter into the Restaurant.
Ambience:-
                      When u will enter into the Restaurant u will feel something special.Sweet Melodious Music with Dim lighting with vase with rose on the table and candle floating inside a small glass made my day.Perfect ambience for candle light romantic date. It was just a bliss.

Food and Quality:-
                                  I was attracted to this restaurant for its zomato rating.I am fully pleased at its ambience and food.
I ordered- 
Chicken Manchow Soup
Chicken Lollypop(6pc little bit gravy was there)
Chicken Fried Rice
Chili Chicken (boneless 8pc)
Everything was just outstanding.
Lollypop was with bone but preety tasty.
Rice Quantity was really enough.
Quality is superb.
There are varities of sea fish food(Octopus Prawn) which i have not tried yet but yeah will try in future for sure.
Service:-
                 The staffs are really courteous and polite.They served each and every food.
They also asked me whether the food was okay or not.Lastly i was asked to fill a feedback form which i fill.
I really very much pleased and want to recommend to all of you for having a great chinese food with pocket friendly price with family or with Soul Mate for a good Candle Light Date.

Just have a look into my photos for better understanding.
P.S:- I am uploading chef's special food menu chart which u wont get in Zomato.
And One more thing They will provide you the food menu card which will be INCLUSIVE TAX.Dont be confused as the price list which is provided in Zomato is EXCLUSIVE TAX.So you can add 18% tax on each food.
Happy Dining..

Guys...be careful if you ever plan to be at Rosenberg. I have had a terrible experience with their food. I ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Prawn for take away. I was shocked and could not believe what I saw. The Prawns were quite small but appeared big from outside due to a very heavy coating. The worst part is i happen to find live worms coming out of the prawns!!! Would u believe it? I had to throw entire stuff. They charged a hefty 280 bucks appx. For such a crap. Mixed Rice was also ordinary... I threw the entire stuff after seeing the worms. I called them and also showed them the pics and video. Be careful if you are ever visiting this place. Completely rubbish! Uploading pic and video........

One of my favourite places to dine even when I am accompanied by none..

My suggestions would be confined to only Starters:

(i) Thai Soup
(ii) Spicy Chicken Tossed in Oyster Sauce
(iii) Heart of Kolkata (Rosenberg Special Dish)

Main course is nothing extraordinary.. Just like any other regular Chinese Restaurant..

You can give it a try once you are around Ultadanga looking for good food.. :-)

Rosenberg could potentially attract even more customers but the service is a huge turn-off.
Let me begin sharing my experience in pointers:

Ambience:
Extremely aesthetic. If you want to have an affordable candle-light dinner, there is no reason to hesitate. Perfect ambience for dates. Dim-lit and it adds to the beauty.

Service:
One word- Horrible. I haven't seen such uncouth lethargy in quite some time. This is the one and only downside. Apart from my own personal experience, I have also questioned other acquaintances​ who visited the restaurant. The answer has been consistent- horrible service. Bad staff. Bad management.

Food:
The food is extremely delicious. You will be surprised. Try the squid or the octopus if you can. The price they demand is extremely reasonable for the food they provide.

Value for money:
Yes! You will barely find an ambience and food like that at such a low-key price. That is why, despite the hideous service, this place keeps me wanting to go back for more.

Visited this restaurant after going through reviews on Zomato. Never knew such a place existed in Ultadanga before that. It is near the footbridge & beside Lords & Mio Amore . Parking is an issue here as the area is a no parking zone . It's a small restaurant but seating is really comfortable with lots of free space in between . The four seater table was quite big compared to other places . The dim lighting & candlelight makes a romantic environment . The place was nearly empty so had no problem in getting a table . Staffs were quick to take orders & serve ( faced no problem regarding service as I had read in some reviews but it was hardly operating at near capacity). We tried the following :
Chicken Momo : The dish was primarily for my little son & he enjoyed it very much . It consisted of six momos with momo sauce & a bowl of momo soup . The size & stuffing of the momos was quite good .
Let Mai Kai : It consisted of six pieces of chicken with associated vegetables & sauce . The taste was totally different from other places & had a strong taste of sauce which should be taken care of , nevertheless it was OK type .
Chicken Singapore Fried Rice : Had read about this particular item on most of the reviews . Decoration of the dish was very nice but tastewise did not find anything outstanding . It contained generous portion of chicken & vegetables but was a bit bland for my liking . Quantity was quite adequate.
Stir Fried Chicken Noodles : Hakka style noodles which tasted quite good . Not too spicy but had right amount of spices to stir the taste buds.
Hot Garlic Chicken : A good side dish to accompany the rice & noodles though I would have liked it to be hotter / spicier .
Overall a nice & welcome addition to Ultadanga . Hope they maintain & improve the quality of service & food in future .

first of all the location is just beside ultodanga foot bridge..there are two restaurants side by side..one is lords and rosenberg is in the ground floor of a building.
the decor is beautiful....the behaviour of the staffs are nice..
now lets go for the food section
we ordered let me kai chicken in starter..it was amazing
then chicken Singapore rice and chicken in wine sauce or something like that..it was a chefs special suggested by the waiter...chicken singapore rice was good and the chefs special dish was different..it was yummy and mushrooms were there too with small pieces of chicken more than 15 pieces..but i didnt like the smell of wine in the dish..though it was yummy with the rice..
now the price is a bit high if u compare it with the quantity..they took 115 rupees as a tax...as per as i know government has banned tax payments in restaurants and food corners but they are still taking it almost 20 prcnt of the bill..that was something i really didnt like.the price mentioned over the menu is an old one.they increased their price 20-25 rupees extra in every section and they only have chinese in their cuisine​ right now....
last but not the least they gave us a paper to write feedback and the paper was different and interestingly written options were there...it was a good experience, recommended for dates...

My first ever candle light dinning experience. Located just beside pearless brigde at Ultadanga. I must say the staffs are really co-operative.
I was searching a place where I can customize the table decoration for a special event.This was the place.
They allowed me to decorate a table the way I want. I had a priceless experience at Rosenberg. They played the music of my choice. They served a cake exactly when that was needed. They decorated the lawn with balloons and flowers without any extra charges.
Not too spacious but well organized. Ambience was good, food was okay.
**A decent place to have candle light dinner without spending too much money.

Loved the decor and the music. The food is equally good. The most liked dish for today was the Devil's Sqiud. It was really tasty and equally spicy.

Perfect atmosphere for candle light romantic date...dimly lit with vase with rose on the table and candle floating inside a small glass...we ordered mixed hongkong fried rice,chicken noodles and bang bang chicken...the rice was pretty tasty and the chicken was not bad but the noodles was horrible!!!coming to the amount that they serve is not sufficient...

After going through the reviews and photos of this place in Zomato I was interested in giving this place a try.There are a very few restaurants in saltlake providing varieties of seafood so the menu was really attracting to me.Ordered for a mixed Cantonese noodles and butter galic pepper octopusand tomato soup.The quantity of each plate compared to the price they take in small.The noodles was okay except the quantity part there were good amount of veggies,chicken and prawn as well.The octopus just ruined the whole thing.Tiniest pieces of octopus covered in 10 times size batter and with that the octopus was chewy as a rubber.To the management,Please don't add foods in the menu which you don't know how to prepare.The tomato soup was again the same,exremely sweet and they had put ketchup in the soup with made the taste vey wierd.

I bookmarked this place quite few days ago and finally visited this place today... Thanks Zomato for introducing me to this restaurant. Must say, I am impressed. 
It's a Chinese restaurant located near ultadanga foot bridge. Once stepped inside, I immediately fell in love with the ambiance! Dimly lit,roses in vase, little diya in glass...Soft romantic music.. pure bliss... 

Now coming to the food!
We were four people. So we orederd-
1.Chef's special chicken wings for starters - really delicious! Must try.
2.Mixed Hong Kong chowmin
3.chicken Singapore fried rice
4.hong Kong chicken
5.Bang bang chicken

Last but not the least,the staff here are very humble and well behaved. Service was excellent. Extra points for that.They took our feedbacks also. 
Would love to visit again.

One of the finest Chinese restaurants I have ever visited! Though I already visited here 5 times! A perfect romantic place for lunch/dinner with your love, if both of you are Chinese Cuisine Lover! :D

Coming to the review,

Positive Points:

1. Food - Just fabulous! We were looking for perfect Chinese/Cantonese Cuisine and Rosenberg was perfect delivering it! I was amused observing their quantity they give in their Foods!
2. Serving time - They will serve you within 15 mins of placing your order, whatever you order or how many items you order doesn't matter!

3. Ambience and Decoration - This restro has one of the finest Romantic Decorations! Ambience and musics are awesome, romantic! Tables are decorated with Rose Stem in a Glass and if a couple visit they will give a floating candle in the middle of your table! It will make your lunch/dinner more Romantic! 
4. Staff behaviour - Waiters behaviour are good and they will make you understand the dishes, which one is better to have which one is not! They will prefer you to have some dishes which are specialities of Rosenberg!
5. Pocket Pinch - I will not say it is a Pocket Friendly restaurants but when there is good food money doesn't matter right? They accept Paytm.

Negative Points:

1. Waiters are bit slow in cleaning your table and as well as the place is a bit odd for those who want to drive there! Best is to get an Uber or Ola! No Parking facility is available.

We ordered,
Starter
1. Chilli Squid Dry
Main Course
1. Mixed Hakka Noodles
2. Mustard Coriander Chicken
Beverage
1. Thumbs Up
All these cost us 735/- which is Manageable if you are a Chinese Lover! A perfect place for a Lunch/Dinner date. ;)
Try it, Enjoy your meal and Have fun!

N.B. - The Menu and the price of this Restaurants in Zomato is not updated! Add Rs. 20-30 in each menu written in this Menu Card! Though the mentioned Cost for Two is correct which is Rs. 750!

After reading much about this place decided to try it while we happen to be in that area. A small cosy restaurant located at the start of the Ultadanga footbridge serving Chinese food. The USP of the restaurant is the location and the decoration of the place, otherwise once you enter the place you will get to know how slow everyone is there( you will hardly see one or two present there to attend you). If you are too hungry, you better avoid this place cause the ppl are quite lethargic to even take ur orders, forget about when they will serve it. Coming to the food taste, it's quite bland. 
The crispy babycorn missing the crisp in it, kung pao and machurian tasting just the same. They have a wide variety in the menu from squids , octopus to decent vaiety in veg items and being quite reasonably priced , however the taste and presentation is just identical to one another.

Well, This is a nice place for couple date.. Tasty food with candle light.. But always go at the free time.. Because their manpower is 2 or 3.. They can't manage the whole situation if the restaurant was full of customers.. Maximum time they were busy in delivery of food.. On 31st December,2016 we went there.. and they came after 15mins to receive our order and then gave the food after 45mins more . we were too hungry so It was too irritating.. Hong Kong mixed fried rice and chicken hot n sour soup were tasty but chicken manchurian was worst..

Located right beside the ultadanga footbridge, its the best u will get near bidhannagar. Its a dark cozy chinese restaurant, with jaw dropping prices on menu. Food doesnt tastes bad i would say. For emergency situations i mean why not, it's decent sitting place. Could see lot of red dots options, ranging from octopus, squid, prawns, to regular chicken n fish. Pinch in pocket 2/5. Soup costs 65rs only, so rest you may guess

Been there several times and i used to like it a lot not only because of their food but also the atmosphere they provide but I must say they have not been up to the mark these recent days. At first we tried the chinese preparations like hot garlic chiken, chiken salt and pepper, veg fried rice and the quantity and taste of the food was very good. In the last days we tried the american chop suye and it came out as a disaster..we did not know what kind of chop suye they surved. It was a very bad experience and their number of waiters are also less to handle the customers.

This s d 2nd tym i went there for a bttr xperience bt alas! Pros and cons for foodies.. 
Pros :
1. Well decorated 
Cons :
1. Unprofessional waiter with no sense of restaurant etiquette 
2. No. Of waiter is very less, they unable to handle the crowd 
3. The waiters have confusions on themselves that which table they r allotted to
4. They have a lot f dishes in the menu card but hardly you will find them
Advice :
If you guys near ultadanga, and you are feeling hungry badly then only two names strike hard on your head, i. e. Lords and Rosenberg bt i will say don't choose Rosenberg on a festive season, go to any new opened restaurant and give them a chance to satisfy your expec and you can also go for city centre 1,which is nearer to ultadanga, hardly take 5-7mnts.

Let's keep it short and sweet like the restaurant itself..

Pros?
1. Great tasting Chinese
2. Enticing ambience 
3. Pocket friendly

Cons?
1. Very long making/waiting time after order 
2. The number of available dishes is only the 10% of        what is listed in the menu.
3. Not very helpful staff.

In short...Decent pocket friendly eatery if you go hungry at Ultadanga. Bon appetite.

Sadly the past 2 times I visited the restaurant I was utterly disappointed with the decrease in food quality and so I had change my ratings. The ambience is as usual beautiful and quite romantic.

Whenever i have cravings for good food and not in a mood to walk out of the house, this is the place which satisfies us with their chinese food. Mostly i order home delivery as the restaurent itself is very small. The dried chillichicken , chicken fried rice and the hakka noodle tastes quite good here. And yea they also make awesome sweet corn soup and its my most favourite. There were few times when i did pay visit to the restaurent but apparently service is not that well. There is only one waiter serving every table. Price is cheap.

Highly delighted to have discovered such a gem of a restaurant. Nice cosy romantic ambience with candles and dim lights and the main thing is the food was great too. 
3 hungry souls hopped in to have lunch. We ordered veg fried rice,veg hongkong rice, dry chilly chicken, Mongolian chicken and lime soda. The quantity ws more than enough for us( all 3 of us r great foodies) and each of the items were delectable.(p.s- as we were too hungry cudnt click pics). The hongkong rice ws a bit too spicy for one of my friends though those who love spicy food will surely enjoy it.
The most important part was that though we gorged on food that satisfied our tummies it didn't hurt our pockets at all. Extremely pocket friendly. Atleast one visit is surely recommended.

Situated just opposite of great eastern ultodanga. The main disadvantage, it is not easy to locate due to trees and shop hordings. Now come to the main part i.e. food and the restro. Interior is good. It's a combination of red green and yellow lights. It's a quite darker sight suitable fr bar and may be for candle light dinner. The background music is truly romantic. Now come to the food. The taste of food is surprisingly good. Quantity is good. I ordered kung-po chicken, latme kai, pan fried chilli fish and butter octopus. All the items are very satisfying specially the octopus. In the main dish we ordered mixed fried rice, mixed gravy noodles, mixed pan fried gravy noodles and in the side dish there were chilli chicken, Mongolian chicken, steamed fish in white sauce. Everything was perfect. But Mongolian chicken is very similar to the barbeque chicken. Overall I am truly satisfied. But don't know why in spite of the good food there is not so customers! But everyone should try this restro and moreover  it's very cheap.

Rosenberg is the only eatery in Ultadanga worth going to. I've read so many good reviews about this place that it took its toll on me. The restaurant is located right next to the over-walk and surprisingly enough, very easy to locate.

The interiors are done up well, low lights with a 3 colour contrast lighting scheme. They've strung up a few famous replicas, hardly the stuff you'd expect from a budget eatery. Their cutlery and crockery and standard however, and the furniture doesn't seem to be too shabby. The entire restaurant could fit in a good fifty people I'd reckon.

I went in for lunch at about 1 in the afternoon, so there was just one guy serving us and we were the only ones in the restaurant. The waiter was polite, nothing extraordinary, but good enough. The order took a while though, considering they didn't really have anyone else to serve to.

The food was good. I personally wouldn't recommend trying out their red gravy dishes, I don't think that's a good way to go. The Mongolian chicken is a great option, as are their cereals. I strongly recommend listening to the waiter for what's good -- he knows. The recommended the Mongolian chicken (outstanding) and asked us not to opt for the Chicken Devils (mediocre). But we went ahead with it anyway. The rice was quite superbly done. I would recommend a second visit here just for the rice and chicken. They were fresh out of squid and octopus, and that was a real disappointment. They didn't have coriander either, which was odd.

Regardless, Rosenberg does a fine job with budget eating. I'm hoping to be able to try out some seafood next time. A standard meal for 2 including 2 sides and a cereal shouldn't come to more than 550 rupees.

Ambience/Interiors: 3.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

I have been visiting this place for the last 2 years and Rosenberg has never disappointed me. Be it their variety of starters or main course, the taste of every item has been well complemented with the quantity and price. The place is a bit difficult to find but the ambience and space is pretty good. But during the Puja hours, their service was not up to the mark and the food wasn't that great. I would recommend everyone to visit this place during the normal days and not during the festive occasion.
Cheerio :)

Even on this year's Navami it was crowded when we turned up there, bt they could manage a table for 4 of us in 5minutes..the quality of food was not compromised for puja rush.. We like the Lemon Fish,Garlic Prawn of Rosenberg a lot(although on puja occasion selected dishes were available).. We visit here in almost every 2months and nvr had a bad experience.

Worst experience. The worst restaurant i have ever visited in my life. The foods are just pathetic. Disgrace among chinese restaurants. Also the interior is so bad. There is hardly any light inside. They are saving the electricity bill in this way. We have ordered dry chili chicken, mixed fried rice n mongolian chicken. You will get better dry chili chicken in any roadside small hotels. Same goes for other foods also. There is no single point which can inspire you to go to this third grade restaurant.

On the auspicious occasion of Durga Ashtami we visited this place. The Interior was nice but the furniture were not upto the mark. We ordered mutton biryani, veg fried rice and garlic chicken. Biryani was okayish. Fried rice and garlic chicken were good. But the quantity they serve is not enough for two people. Service is poor. Overall an average experience.

Located at the heart of ultadanga, right below the flank of the flyover bridge.
Food quantity and quality is standard. The best part is there is rarely any other restaurant in this region serving items like octupus and squid, so the seafood option is great here.
Ambience is great for a quiet night out, their lighting is very conducive for romance. They even put up a  candle for couples making it a true blue candlelit dinner.
Had lung Fung soup, devils octupus and mixed noodles, taste was good but quantity could be better.
Although waiters knew abt the items , service time was a lot.
All in all its worth a visit for not so expensive filling food.

On my trip to Kolkata, this was the best place I had been to for Chinese food. Located at Ultadanga, this place is easy to find. I had come here on a Wednesday night for dinner, the place was beautifully lit up with colourful lights. The ambience was beautiful and they played the perfect songs to go with the mood.
The things I ordered were included a thai soup, fried chili chicken, mixed noodles and a prawn dish. The Thai Soup was the best I've ever had! It was spicy with a perfect broth on top and it had pieces of shredded chicken and prawns. Even the chicken and prawn dishes were pretty delicious. The noodles were yum too. 

The quantity served is perfect for 2-3 people and the staff here is very friendly. Totally recommend this place to all foodies in Kolkata.

Though the service was a bit late but still I would love to visit this place again.

It is a restaurant at ultodanga.. The chinese and indian food quality as well as quantity is very good.. But they sometimes burn the seafood.. I tried squid there but did not like much.. But kulcha, badami chicken, chicken munchurian, mixed fried rice... The ambiance is very good. A glass is there on table with rose and candle...

The entrance of the restaurant is satisfactory. The place is more frequented by the couples. Soft music was being played in the background and the ambience was quite soothing. I was accompanied by one of my school mates. We headed to this place while returning from a pet show at the Science City. The food was okay and the staffs are courteous. :)

Ambience 
This place is a small and cosy eatery with a romantic ambience! The tables have candle lights and the lights are mesmerizingly beautiful.
(We didn't really have time for appetizers and so we just went for the main course.)

Service
This, is the only drawback here. The staff seems to be least interested in attending to the customers. 

Main course
We ordered for Hong Kong Chicken Fried Rice which is a moderately spiced staple. The dish is delicious and the quantity is quite good. Along with the rice, we ordered for Shanghai Chicken, which according to us, is a must have! Soaked deep in a tangy and spicy gravy, the finely diced chicken melts in the mouth. Also, the quantity was such that we had to take back home about 40% of the food!

Visited long time back..even ordered for home deliveries. Food is good and the quality and quantity doesn't disappoint us too. Place and the overall ambience is decent but the service should be much more faster. Nobody likes to wait for a long time for food to arrive. Isn't it?

Decent place to dine at with a limited budget.
Located at ultadanga, is a good restaurant for a quick bite.

Coming to the food, there were two of us, ordered a mixed fried rice and "The heart of Kolkata" (having heard a lot about this dish). The food didn't disappoint! The mixed fried rice had surpassed my expectations! It had enough amount prawns and chicken, tasted well enough! Now the 'heart', four pieces of chicken legs deep fried with a (read: very) thick flour, sauteed in a red schezwan sauce with veggies and shredded​/minced chicken. The concept is new, tasted spicy & decent, and was filing; having said that, the thick flour coating is really undesirable.

Overall a nice experience. Will definitely recommend to others!

Located in ultadanga(near footbridge) Rosenberg is really an awesome place. The decoration, arrangements and the environment is good(You can solely concentrate on food..hahaha). We were 8 guys. Started from chicken lollipop following with main courses(chicken fried rice,chicken devils etc) we enjoyed everything. The food was good.. with good quality and quantity. Took a little bit time to serve. But that is negligible. You should try it once at least.

Note : My Review got deleted due to some issues so its a repost.

Date Of Visit : 01/03/2016

The Place : Its just on the left side before the main crossing of Ultadanga after the Bidhannagar station (If coming from Khanna More). The entrance is bit mechanical because you will find it hidden behind cars as there is a Car dealer point attached to this venue. The ambience is quite well and very soothing to eyes, low lights clean environment, soft music and well maintained furnitures. This place is big enough to accomodate nearly 50 heads at a time. When i entered this place today, i saw it vacant may be because of week day. As we sat on the table, wasting no time and started to scan the menu and their cuisines. They have both variety of Indian as well as Chinese dishes on the card to offer the customers. The waiters were quick on their feets and immediately followed us with jug of cold water and a small cup of water candle. Right from the entrance till the end of the floor the place was nicely decorated with painting of old Calcutta and few others, the interior is nicely built and the arrangement for seating is good.

The Food : At this venue i tried two items and they are Chicken Fried Rice & Hot Garlic Chicken..

1. Chicken Fried Rice - They brought the Chicken fried rice in a small bowl which is fit for a single person but not for two.

 The quantity of chicken as well as egg was fair enough but the taste failed to impress me. They garnished a small carrot on top of the Fried rice in the shape of flower for making it presentable. The rice was properly cooked, size was upto the mark but chinese feeling was missing as it should make you feel. A juicy taste is always inherited in any fried rice but i found it very plain and simple. There is always a mixutre of various spices to make it tongue twisting but it failed to do so...       My Rating : 2.5/5

2. Hot Garlic Chicken : The color of this dish made me feel that it will surely make my day but my mood turned the opposite as i tasted it. The dish was full of chilly flakes and it tasted just so very simple. We ordered Hot Garlic Chicken just because we wanted to have something very spicy in taste but i felt it like having chicken made wth soya sauce and combos of necessary spices. The chicken pieces were small and bit hard to tear. The gravy was fair enough according to one bowl of rice..     My Rating : 2.5/5

Overall Experience and Recommendation : My Ratings for this place would be 

4/5 for Ambiance

3/5 for Service

3/5 for Taste

3/5 for Reasonability

4/5 for Cleanliness & Hygiene

 The only thing that impressed me is the environment and cleanliness of the place. Rest, i am not very satisfied with the food they made. The pricing is reasonable though. The service was decent and quick and the behavious of waiters was friendly and they were active. A place like Ultadanga has very few restaurants to serve chinese food and this is one of those. In comparison with other player at this place, i think its quite behind in providing taste. They need lot to improve.

Located right near the Ultadanga Foot bridge, easy to locate..
It was our Farewell Lunch of our r
Residency program and my colleagues decided we should go to Roseburg since we wanted to have Chinese and was nearby to workplace..
The environment is really beautiful..dimly lit, floating candles, the environment gives a fresh feel after u get in..the staffs are also quite friendly
Now for the food we ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Cantonese Noodles, Kimchi Salad, Bang Bang Chicken, Schwezwan Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken..
One of my friend wanted to have Mughlai so ordered Butter naan and Chicken Butter Masala and Fresh Lime Soda..
Chinese was good taste wise and even the quantity were good for 2 people and 3 also if U are on the lighter side of eating..
Indian was good too.
What I like the most was the Kimchi Salad..it was tangy, spicy just it should be..
The overall bill came around 1800 for 6 people so not much heavy on the pocket..

It was our sudden found restaurant, and gradually it became our often to visit restaurant. Earlier it was located at the first floor with an awesome teracotta interior decoration. Recently they have shifted to the Ground floor. 
Food was and is awesomely cooked and served. I am a huge fan of their chinese delicacies... Great quantity. Ambience is a bit romantic ....Gel candles and rose petals are put to the table when you arrive as a couple. Staffs are well mannered. You will love this place once you get in. BUT, recently, we have noticed some lags on the time taken by them to serve. Even if there are few people in the restaurant, they are taking looong time to serve your order. I wish this gets sorted out early.

Located near ultadanga foot bridge. Visited this place on poila boishakh. The place was crowded. Interior decoration is nice but insufficiently lit. We tasted garlic squid, crispy chilly baby corn, corriender fried rice and barbeque chicken. Food was nice. Quality and quantity was nice. But the chilly baby corn was very spicy.

Quiet place for eating out. We ordered Momo, Mandarin chicken, Chilli Chicken, Mixed fried rice and Garlic noodles. The Momo was terrible, hard as stone. The complimentary soup was too sweet. It can well pass off as dessert. The chicken dishes  were fine. Same for the noodles and rice. They price was reasonable. The staff were courteous. Needs to work on their food.

It's my first visit to Calcutta and am here on work my colleague located this paver on zomato and based on the review We went here. The location was a nice 15 min walk from our hotel. Wasn't that difficult to locate the place. The place is nice has some good paintings I guess this place is more frequented by couples. The waiter was nice had good knowledge on the food. I orders for a paneer fiza can't recollect the proper name which was made in ghee and cashews it is not a spicy dish but was really nice. My friend had a chicken which had a mix of burji on top and chicken gravy. Both dishes were nice and would really suggest this place for a meal if ever in Salt Lake Area.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: 
Right at the Ultadanga near and opposite to Bidhannagar station. This place falls inside a car showroom. From the entrance you see lots of second hand cars till you walk in to the resto main gate. Seen so much of mixed reviews about this place. Still holding 3.7 which was above average and quite good instead. It was a sudden visit to this place with family in the hot afternoon. They serve with quite a well dined in resto with Chinese, Indian and tandoor.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF:
When i entered the resto the vibes were very negative from the entrace. The look of the resto was not pleasant at all. It is quite dark at the main gate, don't know whether kept the lights off or it is like that. The sitting arranegement is really decent. The interior and decor is very good. Hung lots of fine painting which were really eye catching. The choice of music really pissed me off. Music was not good at all thou it was soft. Staff were ok but they need to be more energetic and pleasant. Place was neat and clean.

FOOD: 
As i seen some mixed reviews so i was not sure whether to order in small or in quanity. But yet deciding to order few first and to extend later.
We ordered Chicken Fried Rice with Hot Garlic Chicken.
Chicken fried rice was not upto the mark, The quantity of chicken as well as egg were decent but the taste of the rice was not at all impressive, instead it looked too ordinary.
Hot garlic Chicken was too on the ordinary side. Taste was a bit absent and i couldnt find the hot garlic flavour which i looked for. That what made me stop to order anything further. 

CFR: 6/10
HGC: 6/10

QNQ AND PRICES: 
Quality was decent enough but quanity is just enough for one person per dish. Hot garlic chicken was somehow had good amount of gravy but chicken pecies were a bit small. Prices are fine.

CONCLUSION: 
Improvement is required in the food section. Thou tasted only two but what my experience says this is not the food i expected with 3.7 scored resto.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

There are very few nice dine restaurants available in between train passengers crowd of Ultadanga. Where Rosenberg offers a full dine experience with Chinese, Indian & Tandoor all.

Location : Its very easy to locate from the Ultadanga flyover, just few steps from Ultadanga more towards Bidhan Nagar Railway Station. Easy way to locate is opposite to the Sony Centre.

Decorations : The restaurant is located just inside of a lane. Its well decorated, well maintained & have some nice place inside to hold a large number of people. Sittings are spread in a good way that utilises the space well, where walls have some paintings & small arts. The ambience is very likeable, dim warm white & bluish light lit up the place that makes it ideal for a special date.

Staffs & Management : Behaviour of the staffs are very well & they serve you in a good way. Service is also pretty fast, so you don't have to wait much.  

Foods Delight : This time I got something different than usual. I settled with their Non Veg Soup.

Chicken Manchow Soup : The Manchow Soup was served in a small bowl with fried noodles on top of it. The soup bowl was full of Chicken Pieces & Eggs in it. Very nicely cooked & just the right amount of spices made it really great.  All that came as a result of very good taste to make you want more.

Pricing : Pricing of all the dishes are very well designed. Where soup items costs less than Rs. 100 & for that it tasted really good. The overall experience moves this restaurant to value for money category.

Conclusion : Rosenberg over in Ultadanga offers a good dine experience with very good food quality. An absolute recommend from my side.

Was looking for a quick bite while with a friend at Ultadanga. Found this place. As we sat at our table, we were given a candle in a glass and it was placed right in the middle is the table. May be the waiter mistook us for a couple. Just ordered some seafood rice and chilli squid. Food was nice, specially the rice. But the decor isn't very impressive. Can be more neat. The place is a bit dark and gloomy, but that may be just to bring in more couples. Okay, can do better.

After a hard day of shopping, we decided to hit this restaurant for lunch. This is the only restaurant I have seen which serves Chinese, Seafood and North Indian Cuisines. This dim lighted themed restaurant soothes the eyes and the small floating candle in a glass adds a romantic touch. The location is very convenient for all those who travel via trains. Its a 5 minutes walking distance from Biddhannagar Railway Station. 

Service: 10/10

I opted for Mixed Hakka Noodles, but the good waiter said that if you add Hong Kong flavor, it will taste much better. Then again, Mixed Fried Rice was changed to Mixed Singaporean Fried Rice. We ordered Chicken Boneless Tikka Masala as a side dish which has 6 pieces. The food came in ample quantity such that I couldn't finish my noodles. 
The noodles has cashews in them, which was completely uncalled for. Then again, there were no prawns. Tad bit of disappointment. We wanted to try the Pan Fried Momos, but couldn't due to its unavailability. The chicken side dish was quite good. The gravy was spicy. The Rice was also quite delicious. 

A good experience. 
Definitely visit again.

Located just near Bidhannagar behind the auto stand with a high chance of being missed out. I never knew about it before I saw it on Zomato. Splendid place. Lots of space inside. Dim lights provide for a good ambiance. They provide a glass of water with a floating candle which is a neat touch. Only place I found provides Chinese, North Indian and seafood cuisines. Ordered mainly chinese, mixed fried rice (singapore), mixed noodles (hong kong) and punjabi chicken. Came in generous quantities with nice details to presentation. Tasted very well though the rice was a bit too spicy. The chicken was very well made with thick n rich gravy. Nice place to have a quite dinner after a day's work. I wish VAT/service charges were included in the food price n not charged seperately.

What a pathetic service they had, we ordered our food but they served after 56 minutes waiting, what a shame. Food was average nothing special but had a best ambiance. They arranged a candle on our table and when they served candle light went off after melting.Ordered prawn tossed in black bean sauce,Mixed singapore noodles and kung pao chicken. Noodles and chicken were good but supplied prawn wasn't so tasty. I think this is an average restaurant and need to be more efficient

Rosenberg is a good restaurant,the interior is very well furnished and well decorated and the best part was the floating candle that they placed on the table.We ordered Drums Of Heaven which consisted 6pieces of chicken which was sufficient enough and the best part was its sauce that they served with the dish.Though it took more than 30 mins to come to the table but it was worth waiting.The waiter recomended us to order the Mixed Singapore fried rice and chicken in Barbeque Sauce which was very tasty.I went their with my friends and was quite satisfied on relying upon the waiter's recomendation.The price is also quite reasonable according to the quantity.Overall it was a very nice experience and wish to visit the restaurant soon and i would also like to recomend my friends to come and try it out.

Let me start this reiew in a possitive note saying about their table presentation!! Each table was having very nice roses with long stem, napkins decorated in shape of flowers and floating candles in a glass! All these things had set the mood for a nice lunch.

We ordered CHICKEN LUNG FUNG SOUP - This is a real gem with lots of flavors, generous amount of chicken, mushroom and baby corn, a zestyness of lime and fresh smell of corriender. And all these things covered in egg white.
THAI SOUP - A spicy one with green chili and lemon and chicken. This one was also covered with egg white. It tasted quite regular, nothing fancy like previous one.

In main course, staff sugested to try MIXED SINGAPORE NOODLES - Previously where ever I tried this dish, it appeared in white texture, but here it was in quite spicy avatar. Taste was good, it was also having flavour, but the noodles were broken into very small pieces. Seems those were pretty much over cooked. For me, one endof noodle should br in plate when the other is in my mouth. But here I got disappointed.
Next item was CHICKEN IN 8 BY 8 SAUCE - We were told that this is a specila in house sauce and will be quite spicy. But the gravy tasted nothing better than road side chilli chicken dish. Chicken chunks were quite nicely marinated, you can get hint of ginger with each bite but gravy was not up to the expectation.

Here service was also quite slow. If I even give benefit of doubt for foods, it makes no sense to make customer wait arround 20 mins for sweet lime soda.

Overall a pretty much average experiance. Will I try this again..may be NO!

Over Zomato Rosenberg has mixed reviews. I have been there for 4-5 times and I think people should take this often-to-be-missed restaurant seriously. Most of the people come here are couples and for them it serves perfectly. The decor is good. The ambience is good - low lights and they play soft music softly and light up candle for couples. They serve bit slow - which is good for after-date or mid-date lunch or dinner. You will have more time for chatting or gossiping. The food lovers may not need these stuffs and slow serving can make them feel bad.

Now coming to the foods - Rosenberg serves both Indian & Chinese. Chinese tastes better as I feel. They offer sea foods at a very low price. Chilly squid is a must!

we were searching for good sea food near our place. and found out a very good restaurant near bidhan nagar station.
venigrata octopus and chilli squid dry is awesome. other sea food dishes like garlic butter fried squid, devils octopus are also delicious.... and prices are not too high also....
good place for sea food lovers.

A small out of the way restaurant welcomes u to a sumptuous feista of food when u need it the most during a festive shopping season. Good spicy food: absolutely lip smaking combination of flavours. Good place for a quick lunch.. 
Value for money: not too pricy
Cons: needs to improve on the ambience ( i turned up and found that its being renovated), 
Needs to have more staff.
Apart from that,  an amazing find of a place!!

If you are tired after a hectic day at work and still have a hangout plan with old buddies in the day's schedule then this is a perfect place.... it is a mini restaurant....the dark lighting,the laid back and informal staffs....the long waiting for the food to be served will definitely make you recall your school days where many of us used to choose this kinda places when we ran short of pocket-money on a "treat-giving" day... and obviously will get a lot of time for the chit-chats.... the food is not bad and the tiny floating candle gives a nice touch to the dark ambiance....the place is not crowded at all.... may be that's why sometimes they are not even  ready with regular items like dry chilli chicken... I will recommend to order regular items to be in a safe side and the chicken in black bean sauce,pan fried chilli chicken are nice.... its better to try  Chinese than the Indian/ Mughlai dishes.

Awesome food...variety of cuisines and it does include sea food...good ambience with very good music....candle lights are given...romanticism can be done at its best here....

Two drawbacks I like to include is 

1) Food serving is very slow...

2) When it comes to chinese, u shud have a pot of red chilly sauce which goes best with chowmein and other chinese dishes...

That is y I rated 4 stars....

I actually happened to walk in very hungry and came out truly happy. The food is delicious and the experience fulfilling. We ordered Mixed Hong Kong Rice,which according to the menu was among the less peppery ones, and Garlic Chicken with it. The rice was still a bit too spicy,but tasteful nonetheless. The chicken prep was a bit on the sweeter side and was all the more delicious. I would recommend people to be very cautious if they plan to order the dishes that are marked with a green pepper symbol,they can turn out to be very very hot. Overall,a place recommended strongly for both the food and pocket friendly menu.

Location: Ultadanga, near footbridge.

U have extra money in your pocket...is it really tough to carry around that much amount of money in your pocket, then come & visit ROSENBERG. 

In a group of 10 people we visited this place for lunch and it turned out as a nightmarish experience. To be more precise lack of professionalism from the staff, dull atmosphere and sub-standard food just ruined our whole meal. 

Our order was- ch. cream soup, mixed singapore rice, mixed hongkong noodles, mixed Cantonese noodles, lemon chicken, hot garlic chicken and in dessert there was chocolate ice cream, honey dipped vanilla scoop. Quantity wise good, any standard dish can easily serve two people but quality wise just horrible. Some dishes were too peppered for our palate...‘attyaachar’ for our taste buds, chicken pieces were stiff....soup was okayish, Cantonese noodle was pretty average but much better than other dishes, in a nutshell- a complete wastage of money. Only desserts were acceptable. 

Now there is no question of visiting it again.

I went with my beau there yesterday.I am satisfied with the food they served.they are really tasty.We ordered chicken malai kabab and one item of prawn(forgot the dish name) as starters and in main course we had mutton roganjush with rice.I have just one very inportant thing to mention the item which are marked with green chillis in the menu card,order them with caution cause they really very pungent!!! 😨 That means if u r very good with chilli flavoured foods then those items are best for you.But all of themwere really very delicious.
As the interior decoration is concerned,when this restaurant was at 1st floor the ibterior was very romantic and serene.But now its decent.
I would suggest this restaurant to every person who enjoys good quality food.

An old friend from school took me here when I was in the city last time.What I liked best about the place is that it was dark,cozy and not crowded - which probably also made the waiters a little laid back,and I'm not complaining. We could sit here for a long time without being expected to leave. I'd recommend the pan fried chilly fish and kung po chicken.

Yesterday I went for dinner with mah family and had a horrible experience out there.... Although I have been even before... It has a very nice décor and food was quite up to the mark.... But yesterday it was terrible... First of all service is too slow...Yesterday we ordered sweet corn  soup,fish in 8 to 8 sauce as starter and followed by fried rice, chicken's devil and Hong Kong prawn. The soup was too sweet and when to balance it we tried to sprinkle pepper,a baby cockroach jumped out of it.... Then when for having the fish we took the spoon a dead fly was stuck to it, and the fish was so spicy that you could hardly taste any other flavour but the quality of the fish was satisfactory.... After all this final they served the main course and it was okay... As a whole it was a very terrifying experience. I think the restaurant should take care of the hygiene and I personally don't think I will every visit the restaurant again.... I have rated it 1.5 bcoz of my previous experience and décor...

Love your stomach?? please save yourself from visiting this place. Went in a group of 10 people and came out with a truly embarrassed self. We ordered a quite a lot of things like singapore rice, hongkong noodles, some dishes of chicken. But truly speaking I don't remember anything except the peppery taste. everything is so peppery. Tears rolled down as we ate. The only good thing for which I gave them 1.5 is the honey dipped ice cream which saved our digestive tract from being burnt. Oh another good thing is their cantonese noodles where they didnot find any option to make it a peppery one. 
Please do improve your quality of food.

Ambience: Very nice to visit with the special one or with family. They also serve u a candle if you are with your special one. Well decorated. 
Food: The food is a real delight. Huge,sumptuous, hearty meals. The waiters may sometimes mislead you to order more. So be careful. The seafood is a delight. The serve octopus and squid. The squid was tender and juicy. I must mention that all the dishes are on the spicy side. I loved their barbeque chicken.
Overall: A great pocket friendly place to dine.
I give it a huge thumbs up and visit the place whenever i am around ultadanga. One my fav places!

Indeed a great delicatessen at Ultadanga. I myself was quite surprised to find such an amazing restaurant at such a busy place. The different delectable cuisines at an affordable price-Rosenberg is completely well defined.
I had gone for an evening snack and I found the place as the perfect hangout with friends. The area was spacious and dimly lit with soft music playing along. The waiters too were courteous and soft-spoken. Now coming to the food:
I had ordered Hot and Sour soup with Cantonese noodles, and I must say, it was quite appetizing. The delicious taste was combined with a filling quantity. The price too was quite reasonable as compared to the quantity.
All in all, a pleasant experience and would definitely like to visit again. :)

Located at the heart of Ultadanga Rosenberg serves lovely food. The ambience is soothing with mild music. And the dishes have a different taste of their own. Specially the Drums of heaven they served with a separate onion and veggies tossed in sauce was yum. Chicken noodles and Hunan Chicken being satisfactory either. Only the service was a bit slow. But as their tagline goes, Come Hungry leave Happy actually is not a lie. Recommended!

Rosenberg- the name sounds cool and classy.. I hoped the food will also hav resemblance with the restaurant's name... But was dissapointed..., first it says its a multicuisine restaurant but m sad to say that they don't have other dishes apart from Chinese and north indian.. Service is late and sloppy.. Quality of food is average price is reasonable... Ambience is great and the best part of this place.... Fun fact:- as we were about to get out as soon as the gate man opened the gate the whole glass gate came off...

Situated near my house, this restaurant has been a delight since it got established. A favourite place to have dinner and the food served is mouth watering. From schezwan chicken to chicken sheekh kebab, all the items served here are awesome and is served with beauty. The aroma, the taste, the ambience, all plays a vital point in the smooth running of a restaurant. I have never seen this place vacant, though I have been visiting this place quite a lot, be it with family or a reunion of friends. This place is just amazing destination for the food lovers. Overall, amazing food, amazing ambience, nice hospitality. Looking forward to my almost 15th visit.....

Waaaooo... Love Anniversary with a candlelight lunch just perfect?..
Starting with the decor table's were perfectly synchronised, the texture of the wall?with sketched photo frames light colored ceiling, perfect A.C temp.. My favorite wooden matt finished floor & glass table perfect space.. With well designed napkins, 2 roses in a white flower vase and floating candle in a glass... The menu card was superb ?... Light music which makes your mood more romantic..
We ordered- 1 plate Mixed Hakka Noddles(tossed with egg, medium size shrimps,chunks of chicken and veggies ) , 1 plate Ginger chicken(well cooked, soft, big chunks, thick gravy, awesome flavor of ginger)  and mineral water..
Bill- 356/-(inclusive of VAT)
Last refreshment was served with a box of 4 division which contains 4 type of refreshments..
Highly recommended.. Good quality and quantity is enough for 1 person..

This restaurant is very close to my home, thus most of the time when we are too lazy to cook,  we order home delieveries from here. I have visited the venue once, and liked the ambience and decor. The waiters are courteous too.

Regarding the food, they make awesome and juicy tandoori chicken and some chinese starters are nice as well. yesterday we tried their masala kulcha , paneer batar masala and mutton kadai. the paneer was nicely cooked, but the mutton disappointed us.

Another bad thing is they do not have any desserts apart from ice cream.

Situated near Ultadanga crossing, this cozy little place attracts quite a crowd. The ambience is lovely, the food..... not so much. We(me and my girlfriend) were greeted with what you could vaguely describe as a couple of floating candles and rose petals in a glass.. a lovely romantic gesture. The music and overall ambience are pretty nice. Now, to business, the food! We ordered Gravy chicken noodles and chicken tossed in Bar-b-q sauce. The chicken was nice but the noodles was horrible. Tasteless is one word to describe it. Very disappointed with the noodles. The service was good, and the prices average. Since everything had a good vibe about them, I wish to visit it once more to see if I can overcome the noodles trauma. Till then, 3 stars should suffice. 
EDIT - second visit went well. the bang bang chicken turned out to be one hell of a dish.. the noodles still falling short on expectations.

The best thing which I like about this restaurant is their ambiance.It's like one of the best you can find in the Ultadanga area.Talking about food,the cooking quality I would say good but not as something extraordinary.But I really think the food is a bit overpriced even considering the nice ambiance.Their biriyani is priced higher than even Royal Indian Hotel!!So If you can overlook the price factor I would surely give this restaurant a thumbs up perfect for both family and friend's hangout.

If you want to have food and your girlfriend at the same time visit this place its super shady in the corners 
Even the roadside stalls near bidhan nagar station serve you better food

This is a place located in the bustling ultadanga region very close to the bidhannagar railway station.

The decor of the place is tastefully done and is a nice place if you are looking for a serene meal or even a date. The place is very dark. So if you're meeting up with someone without being spied upon, this place is a good bet for that.

Coming to the food.. It's nothing to write home about. Rosenborg won't peeve you, neither will it enchant you.
The pricing is perfect and I wouldn't mind revisiting this place once again.

I was searching for a place to gobble down some food and suddenly discovered Rosenberg at Ultadanga. It's quiet and elegant; the decor is romantic with candle lights, particularly at night. We placed a quick order for Heart of Kolkata, Mixed Fried Rice, Schezwan Chicken and Manchurian Prawn. Fried Rice was good enough, but they could have done it with little more seasoning. The gravy of the chicken was spicy and the pieces were soft and juicy. The prawn dish disappointed us; it had a strong smell and a typical tangy taste too. The quantity of the noodles and rice was enough for four of us and was palatable. The staffs were suggestive and the service was quick and efficient. It’s a very reasonably priced place and I would like to recommend it to everyone. 

Rating:

Ambiance - 4 /5

Food - 3.2/5

Service - 3.5/5

Visited this place on a dear friend's birthday. It was a Sunday noon but the place wasn't packed,

AMBIENCE 
The interiors have dim lighting and soothing music. The ambience is good with comfortable seating arrangements for small as well as large groups. 

SERVICE AND BEHAVIOUR OF STAFF
The staff cooperated with us and even served the birthday cake which we had ordered from outside. They even played special music for the occassion,let us plug in special lights to their charge points and agreed to click our pictures. We also received ample suggestions about the food. Small gestures like these surely go a long way in creating an impression. 

FOOD
As all of us had decided to eat chinese,we ordered mixed fried rice,mixed hakka noodles, hong kong noodles and 5 chicken dishes. 
Coming to what we were served,the portion size for 1 plate rice/noodles is insufficient for a couple with good appetite. 
The chicken dishes were a mix of very good,good and moderate.
Badami Chicken(the only Indian dish to the otherwise chinese mix) was garnished with heaped tomatoes. Why would anyone add raw tomatoes to a rich almond based gravy escaped me, Ignoring that glitch,it was delicious.
A few of the chicken dishes were spicy enough to make me cry. 
That apart,the rice and noodles had a large quantity of chicken chunks/prawns etc and the chicken pieces in the gravy were succulent. Food stands up to the expectations one would have from a respectable chinese joint.

PRICING
The bill for 5 noodles/rice and 5 chicken dishes amounted to 1700 or so. In short,value for money.

P.S-They have this really quaint box they serve mints in. Watch out for that.
YOU GUYS GET A 4.5 JUST BECAUSE OF YOUR BEHAVIOUR. OTHERWISE A 4/5 PLACE.

A friend of mine took me to Rosenberg on Ashtami, the busiest day during Durga Puja. There is an AC and a non-AC seating area. The non-AC area had a big queue but we got a table in the AC seating area. The menu during Durga Puja was different from the usual menu. So we could not have any of the usual specialties of this restaurant.

We ordered Tandoori Chicken for starter. It was very tasty and the quantity was a lot. However, all of us liked it so much, that we repeated our order. In the meantime, we had also ordered for the main course, Chicken Fried Rice, Schezwan Chicken and Hong Kong Chicken. All the dishes tasted fine though nothing remarkable to talk about.

Service was fast and good. Ambiance was okay. Good place to fill your tummy and refresh during Durga Puja. Would like to go there some normal time when there is not much rush.

This review was based on my experience during pujas..
We went there during the pujas of 2014,it was Saptami n from Zomato Rosenberg is the only decent resturant in Ultadanga area with both ratings n review..
But my experience was really bad
We went there and booked table for two n within a min or two we were guided to our seats..

--------------------------AMBIENCE---------------------------
As it was puja so there was a huge rush n tables were placed outside the resturant also but we preferred to dine in A.C. The place was crowded,n the tables had chairs of 6,m not sure if thats the usual set up apart from the puja also but if thats the case,then thats a bad idea..

-------------------QUALITY N QUANTITY------------------
Anyways we were already stuffed so we ordered 1* mix fried Rice , 1* masala Kulcha n 1* Seczwan Chicken,n from the face of the waiter it was clear he was not happy with our order,but tried to fake in.
Well the food they served us was really really bad,the rice got stiffed which clearly resembled it was Stale n overcooked.
Masala Kulcha felt Tandori Roti to me,thry should know thecdifference between kulcha n tandori roti
But Seczwan Chichen was good,probably the only dish which gave me the feeling that all my money wasnt wasted
Coming to quantity,1plate of rice is not enough for a couple,you need seperate plates.

-------------------------LOCATION---------------------------
This place is situated just beside Lords Resturant,Ultadanga
Easy to spot if you are moving from Ulradanga to Shyambazar area it will lie on the right side.

----------------------------PRICING----------------------------
Things we ordered
1 * Mix Fried Rice  -  169inr
1 * Seczwan Chicken  -  179inr
1 * Masala Kulcha  -  49inr
Vat @14.50%  -  57.56inr
Service Tax @ 4.95%  -  19.65inr
Total ---- 473.00inr

Pricing was a bit high,considering the food they were serving,n I feel my money was wasted
Maybe it was Puja so i had a bad experience,so till now my Reaction about this place is a negetive n i really want to visit here again apart from Puja,to see if the negetive remarks turns into positive..

--------------------BEHAVIOR OF STAFFS----------------
As i said the waiter was not really happy with our order n they will force you a lot to try out more items on the list, which is very bad if you want to run a buisness with a positive goodwill..This mentality needs to be changed among the staffs..

-----------------------TO THE OWNERS--------------------
Try investing a little more on the restroom,keep in mind a clean,hygenic n decorated restroom will earn positive feedbacks ftom customers.
In my last visit i found unhygenic washroom,with broken windows n a hand soap dispenser which was half filled with water with no hand dryer n tissues also..
Moreover the lock on the restroom was half broke which is a massive point on the negative side..

I would like to visit this place again so that i can avoid the Puja rush n then give a perfect review n rating for this place..

Abysmal will be the correct word to describe it. Awful service, Awful food, the AC wasn't working properly. The waiter there addressed us as "Boss". Thats it I'm done with this restaurant. Only thing that is going for it is the arrangement and the price. With that being said it doesn't get any credit for anything what so ever. Stay clear from this place.

Rosenberg… a new Chinese restaurant at Ultadanga crossing ( Between Monginis and age old Lords ) … Heard from friends about this new joint and wondered by hearing they even serve Sea-Food at North Kolkata…so decided to hop in there for a birthday party…

Decoration is really nice and ambience is just Awesome. Staffs are also very courteous ,helpful and very polite.

Now come to the food ,,,, wow …. What an experience. Really don’t have such nice Chinese at North Kolkata before. We have ordered Mapit Chicken ( from their special menu ) and their famous HEART of KOLKATA as starter … Delicious … and for main course ordered Different noodles and Mongolian chicken and Chicken in Bar-Be-Que Sauce … all items were just awesome and very much worth of their values …

Only one regret – Thai section was now closed … hope will have that in near future.

The quantity is huge ( 2 plate of noodles / rice is enough for 3 persons ) and last but not the least – Pocket pinch is not much.

they also offered candles for couples and the lit candle along with soft music make the place dream heaven for Date ..

Indeed, I must say this place is really the Best Chinese Restaurant of North Kolkata.

The first thing that comes in your mind will be a candle light dinner with your loved ones. A lovely place to hop in with some delicious Chinese and Indian food. Though I tried out Chinese, the quality seems quite good at reasonable price. Some delicious chicken and prawn items are here available at a reasonable rate. Octopus and squid also available.The quality of food as well as the the atmosphere gives the feeling of a date. One must try out the spicy starters before plunging into main course. Other than food the ambience is also good. Experience once is quite satisfying.

I cannot imagine how a restro like rosenberg to be present amidst the hustle bustle of ultadanga. It stands out of no where near the ultodanga monginis. I planned my birthday threat there as it was easy on the pocket. The moment I entered.  I was was amazed to witness such a nice ambience of light music being played . The beautifully coloured walls. The nice lookong old watch. The tables. The flowers. And the striking part.  The candles. Its such a romantic place. Now I wish I had aomeone special to take me out for date here. Beautiful was rhe decor. When suddenly the candle went off.. sad. I asked the waiter to get it changed. And he did it. Finally we ordered for the food. We started off with chicken sweetcorn soup. It was a bit too sweet to taste. But nonetheless good. Then we ordered for heart of kolkata and it was awetastic.  The chicken wings cooked in special thai sauce with cooked vegetable and sesame. I simply loved it and will go back for it again. Then came in the maincourse order. Saw a special menu which read sea food was available.  And super excited I wanted to jump. A place in ultadanga having seafood? Out of imagination.  But unfortunately could order just the sea food fried rice as the others didnt like much of sea food. The rice was great as well. along wid it we had a mixed singapore hakka noodles. And the side dish again from the special menu. Chicken on barbeque sauce and cantonese white chicken. I super loved all the foods. And I am going back next week to have shrimps, squids and octopuses.  Unlike others we didnt have to wait long after our orders. The staff was courteous enough suggesting what they made real good. I loved it in totality. Thank god for rosenberg . Not only my appetite is getting a new char but my pocket is also being looked after.

I had no clue about this restaurant before a friend recommended this to me and was surprised that it is so close to the station. But you might have some problem finding the restaurant.

The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice but it is much more dimly lit than expected. The waiter guided us to a table of our choice and placed a candle in a glass half filled with water on our table. The service was prompt and they even offered to serve the food and they don't intend to disturb every now and then.

We ordered TANDOORI CHICKEN for starters. The platter was well decorated with salad and a green chutney. The chicken was very well cooked and had a very smoky flavour. I wanted to try some mutton. I ordered BHUNA MUTTON and KABULI NAAN and MASALA KULCHA for the main course. The mutton didn't let me down the naan was the waiter's recommendation and satisfactory.

I would like to try the THAI some time soon.

After a long time I got such an exquisite eating experience. Starting from the ambiance to the service, everything was top-class. The quantity as well as the quality of the food...both are commendable. What does a person want when he / she goes to dine outside? They will forget the decor, the price, the smartness of the officials everything if the quality of the foods is low but in my case I must say that I am a lucky foodie.

Let me start with the starters. We had ordered Pepper Chicken, Sheek Kabab, Tandoori Chicken, and Malai Kababs for starters. Believe me I have not tasted such awesome kababs at such nominal price in my life. The size of the kebabs should be praised too, on asking the owner that how can you serve such succulent, large-sized kebabs...don't you face a loss...he opined that it was his specialty. They were of Park-Street's and 5-stars' levels. 
For main course we had ordered Garlic and Plain Naans, Tawa Fish, Chicken Bharta, Salad and Raita. For the first time in my life, I ate naans which maintained texture even after 30 minutes of service, they were as soft as newly baked. Only one portion of each was sufficient for 4 of us. Trust me unlike some branded restros' which have started introducing Basha fish instead of Betki, this restro has maintained the tradition to serve only what we bengalis call...desi-betki!! In some restros simple ice-creams are tagged from 70 to 120 bucks, but 2 large scoops, costing less than 45 bucks had made my day.
While counting stars, I give 1 for the location, deco (including the romantic candle-light) and music. 1 star for the hospitality. 2 stars for the mind-blowing mix of spices, taste and flavors of food served and 3stars for the price but since I am allowed 5 stars only, so I have to give the price only 1 star.
The wash-room area needs a bit of an attention but that's no excuse to compromise with such a great range of yummy food. So I give a full 5 stars. :)

Located on the ultadanga crossing, this place has an amazing chance of not being noticed but once you have tried it, i do not think you would miss it again !!!

Its a small restaurant located on the first floor of a building just opposite Sony World outlet here. The place isn't that big yet to my surprise it was pretty much full at 7 pm on a weekday.  The decor is average and lights are too dim to my disliking. The chairs are comfortable enough and tables are pretty big. They give you candles on the table which is nice and appreciable and i thought of asking for a couple ag my share with my takeaway order. The air conditioning was a bit ineffective which needs to worked upon. The staff were polite and service was fast but they lacked mannerisms which is passable. Overall i would prefer this place for a takeaway but nothing wrong with grabbing a quick bite at the restaurant itself.

The food is very reasonably priced and the servings are pretty generous. The place serves indian and chinese food but chinese is their speciality and that what i ordered and just loved it. The burnt ginger garlic fried rice was one of the best i have had in this league or even higher. The hakka noodles was nice. The side dish was english greens in garlic sauce which was pretty good but needs to be a bit more spicey and some more garlic. 

Overall at 90-100 bucks a dish with freaky quantum of servings, they still try to give their customers a candle lit dinner which is amazing to me. I wont say the ambience is great but the intent deserves credit. Full marks to the food which is and should be the priority.

Was keen on visiting this place since I had read K's review... and finally made the visit after our movie plans got screwed by project calls!! 

The ambience is nice.. a little on the darker side... with colorful lamps hanging all over... impressed by the ambience, we got seated in the cornermost table.. and the first turn-off!! Typical oldie style wooden chairs... very very uncomfortable to sit on... Within a minute or so, we were handed over the menu... and while discussing over it, we noticed AC was not working! The fan was on swing mode and barely cooled us... We asked to change our seats.. instead they turned on the AC..!! That too probably after a month or so.. coz it smelled of wet clothes! Yucckkkkk!!!

We were too tired to complain any more and concentrated on the menu... 'Heart of Calcutta' seemed interesting and we asked the server if it would be on the spicier side... coz we were really not interested in anything spicy amidst 41degrees!! He commented it would be mildly spiced and we felt safe... the order went off...

While waiting for our starter, they presented a 'makeshift' floating candle in our table.. 'makeshift' as it was a small candle in a glass of water with a single petal of red rose!! Nice gesture.. but could be a little more generous to make their effort worthwhile!!

Anyways, the wait was long... and we were served the starter after 20-25mins... it was a big plate with 4 large pieces of chicken drumstick and good amount of veggies, but with sweet sauce!!! My husband hates sweetness in chicken dishes and we had no idea that mild spice equals to sweet for them!! The chicken pieces were done very nicely.. but could taste better with a spicy sauce...!

In mains, we decided for Chicken Singapore Rice and Chicken with Vegetables... Quantity was good in both.. The rice contained dry mustard powder which enhanced the flavour.. but it lacked salt.. however, it tasted great after we added a pinch of salt! Chicken in Vegetebales was a plain white gravy with chicken slices and veggies.. the chicken was a little hard.. the veggies were a little under-boiled.. and to my horror, it was again too sweet to our taste!!!

We finished our dinner at 10.30pm, courtesy their service.. the bill was pretty decent.. 482/- all over... 

Small modifications in their preparations and they can pull a large crowd coz Ultadanga area really lacks a good place to dine in..!

I personally prefer Rosenberg because of its two plus points compared to many other restaurants
         1 ) It's absolutely stunning interior.
         2) Pocket friendly price.

Fried Chilly chicken is a must here, be it as a starter or as a chinese side dish. The Tandoor and kabab items are exceptionally good here, but instead of Pudina chutney, a pickle is served which is very much awkard.

Don't ever go for Biriyani, it is the most horrible dish I ever had. Roti, Nan are OK type.

Fried rice and hakka noddles are good but for Gravy chowmein, the gravy is served separately and you yourself have to mix it up. The taste is good but not that much.

Overall I would suggest for tandoor, kabab or chinese(preferably with Fried rice), come here for a rich but pocket friendly experience. It is opposite Ultadanga Sony Centre.

The location of this resturant is quite unnoticeble to the daily commotion and husstle butsle of Ultadanga.  But this place is something different when you get inside. The ambiance is quite  likely to take you aback considering the low price and qulity food.
Its a great place for young couples to get in and have an odd lunch or a dinner in between their daily routine. The speciality of this resturant is the candle light.!! 
Food ..some are quite above standard like the chilli mushroom and other fried sarters. Be sure to ask there specialit  while ordering and grill the waiter before ordering. The service is like any other resturant. 
I am saying it again..it a great place for a romantic lunch or dinner.

Appearances can be deceptive!
The surrounding of the restaurant is very different you wouldn't expect a nice restaurant in that locality just by the main road. The restaurant was not easy to locate not that it was lane but they were short of fliers or boards. 

This were the veggies about the restaurant. Now lets go for the desserts.

The dim light, the lanterns hanging, the cleanliness, the music, the candles everything was perfect. The overall ambience was awesome. I asked the waiter about the specialties and went for it and they didn't let me down.
We ordered TANDOORI CHICKEN for starters. We told the waiter that we haven't had mutton for a long time and he suggested BHUNA MUTTON and KABULI NAAN. I added MASALA KULCHA to that too.
The starter looked very nice and I actually mean it. The platter was very colorful with two chutneys, one green and one white, decorated with salad and all that. I can vouch for the main course I ordered. The food was very good and the pinch on the pocket was moderate too. We also ordered a cup of chocolate ice-cream. They don't react as if they want to clear out the customers as soon as possible. We are entitled to take as much time we want and chat and enjoy our food.
Overall the restaurant is worth going to and I hope to try the THAI food some time soon.

Quaint little joint located unusually at ultadanga (a place not renowned for good restaurants).  Beautiful ambiance created by wooden walls make you feel as you have entered an old cabin. Loved the candle light touch. Also the food is tasty yet not expensive. Waiters are very polite . I loved the roasted fish. Presentation of the food is exquisite. they served the Kashmir pulao in the shape of a heart. It's these little things which make the experience unique. The candle light lunch and dinner make this restaurant perfect  for couples.

Seriously awesome  experience we had on 18th jan 2014, they made my birthday really very special... Place is not too crowded... We reserved the centre table(11 peoples sat there comfortably). Now coming to the ambience... Dimmed llight (hanging Chinese lantern), nice sitting arrangements with a pleasant decor. Staffs are so courteous. I wanted to have some good Chinese food and Captain helped me a lot to place my order. He guided me what should I take according to my taste. Now coming to food quality and quantity... I 
ordered(with the help of captain obviously) :
Starter- chicken drumsticks(6pieces), pan fried momo (6pieces) and then captain recommended to have chili octopus(shredded) and heart of Kolkata(4pieces), (these dishes are the signature dishes he said). First two was sooo good and last two was too delicious
Main course- chicken Hong Kong fried rice,chicken Manchurian (6pieces) , Hong Kong chicken(, 6pieces) chicken garlic (6pieces). Manchurian was average but Hong Kong chicken n garlic chicken was yummy fried rice was sooooooo tasty. Now coming to the service it was so fast. We got our first starter within 10mins. We didn't have wait for the foods but for the bill. One and only drawback is that the place doesn't have much space. I seriously didn't expected this much. Will go there asap to have the heavenly octopus and for the Indian menu. :)

Well Rosenberg is an awesome place. Beautiful ambience, perfect for a date as well as quiet family outing. The hanging lamps,the floating candle they serve on the table,the roses, and that tinge of darkness creates a perfect atmosphere!

I decided to try this place out with my date and she was very impressed and happy because of the surroundings and the atmosphere. 

I don't mind late service as it give enough time to chat, but the service here was perfectly at the correct time. The waiters are well manered and they listen to your complains and try to give the best service.

As for the food, the chef's special menu tastes awesome. Tried roasted chicken with barbeque sauce and the chicken was deliciously cooked and juicy. In the main course we took Mixed Pan Fried noodles. It was the first time we tried it. It's basically boiled noodles are made into a lump and then pan fried,served with gravy; which gives a crispy texture to the noodles, but in the middle noodles are boiled! It tasted good and a lot of vegetables,chicken,and shrimp was present, which I liked.Our side dish was Devil Chicken, which to my dismay tasted flat. But I will praise the chef because all the chicken pieces were thoroughly cooked. 

The price is also very pocket friendly(which is a very big add on)! The servings are enough to fill two people's appetite. 
Combined with ease of access due to location, I rate it a 3.8 out of 5. 

Keep up the good work Rosenberg. :)

This restaurant is located in a shabby and busy part of the city,just 5 minutes from Bidhannagar rail station,in ultadanga. There's hardly anything of worth to say for the exterior facade. A nondescript entrance,which is so easy to miss. A short way up a flight of rickety steps , and finally you reach the dining rooms. While the journey so far is akin to wading through the mists in the Maidan on a winter dawn, once you step into the dining area, everything becomes cheerfully warm and fuzzy. Forgive my poetry and theatrically, but honestly, Rosenberg exudes an aura of romanticism. Almost everything about this cute little dining hall is romantic. Their diffused lighting really is a charm. Plus,if you are accompanied by a lady friend, voila, a floating candle is brought and set upon your table. Talk about making killer moves . This place is an affordable bestseller.It might not be up to the standard of the Park Street posh ones, but it sure strives hard to create a pleasurable experience. They have an extensive menu of dishes with a lot of fancy names. The food may not be brilliant, but one can't find much to really complain about either. One interesting feature is the garnishings they use..they are a visual treat. Here at Rosenberg,they attempt to make your time spent at their place memorable on a budget.And that really touched me. Their services could be improved (To be honest they are a tad too slow ) and perhaps their exterior could be spruced up a bit. Most people don't even notice it from the outside,to be honest. But once you step in, a warm experience awaits you.  So next time you want to feel a bit special with your loved one,why don't you come over here and give it a try. I have a feeling you won't regret it.

Me, my husband and aunt has visited this restaurant few days ago, since the other restaurants nearby were overcrowded. We had ordered gravy mix noodles, chicken sweet corn soup, Sweet and sour chicken, and lemon chicken. I must admit the food was good but....but the service was horrible, there was a singe person who played the role of cashier, waiter, Stuart and everything else. The service was very slow, and infrastructure is very poor. Still I will give it a high score since it is the only proper restaurant of the locality and the food is really nice. However the decoration was quite nice. Attaching some photos of mine in Rosenberg.

Shame.. This place could have been so, so much more!

Remember that saying, 'Do not judge a book by its cover'? 'Cause if you do, you will not let the horrendously crowded Ultadanga more, the shady apartment which you surely wouldn't notice unless you've been visiting this page and know about Rosenberg , and the cramped staircase that leads to this place deceive you. Rosenberg is, in one word, romantic! It oozes romance. I has got enough space, nice seating arrangement and clever lighting (it creates a dim yet serene ambiance, but may seem a bit too dark for some people). As soon as you're at your table, a waiter places a floating candle there. Ooh la la! Take your girlfriend there, and you've earned yourself a brownie point. 

Neither too classy, nor upscale, this restaurant focuses on catering to budget foodies, and does its job well. They have got a huge spread, with a lot of fancy names. Thankfully each dishes were described in the menu card, or else the waiter would have had to be much too efficient! ;) We decided on Mixed Singapore Chow, Chicken Devil and a beverage. The service was painfully slow. At one point they were testing our patience, as both me and my partner were terribly hungry!

The food was good. Just good, nothing exceptional. The way the Singapore Chow had been described in the menu, with English vegetables, mushrooms, baby corn, curry powder and all, we were hoping for it to blow our mind! Instead, it turned out to be kinda sweet for my palate, and my partner found it a tad too oily.. Maybe not a letdown, but not as good as promised! Chicken Devil was actually a delight. It wasn't too fiery, but the chicken was properly cooked, and the gravy was delectable. There was more than enough hint of chilly, vegetables were soft and sauce was great! It'd be a smart side dish to fried rice IMO!  

Maybe Rosenberg is not up there yet in terms of food or service, but it's a fairly nice place to treat yourself at. Prices are affordable, food is above average, ambiance is beautiful! Sure, there is room for improvement, but this place is definitely worth a visit. I like it!

PROS: Ambiance | Chinese Food | Reasonable Pricing.
CONS: Slow service.

Out in the busy streets of Ultadanga I stand in front of Rosenberg's building and wonder should I go in...??? The outer appearance of the building is not much inviting. I have no choice as my friend wants to throw a party here. As I move further my expectations starts degrading but as soon as I enter the restaurant at the 1st floor I go "GREAT" by the ambiance. There is limited space inside but it is very well organized to not make you feel congested. Romantic music playing in the background. This place is definitely built for couples. Surely the ambiance is not OUT-OF-THE-WORLD experience but not less.

Now comes the food, my friend suggested we have CHINESE dishes here coz ROSENBERG's specialty is Chinese. We had:

1. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup - Very sweet and very very tasty. One of the best soups I ever had. Added some chillies  soaked in vinegar and some pepper and it totally ROCKED. Whatever dish you try here don't miss the soup. Order any soup you wish and you won't be disappointed, take my word for that.

2. Crispy Chilli Baby Corn - Superb out-of-the-world experience. Extremely tasty and crispy and very SPICY. Those who don't prefer spicy food should avoid this but definitely worth a try. A small portion of it won't hurt.

3. Mixed Fried Rice - Average on taste. Rice quality was good and quantity was enough.

4. Mixed Chow Hakka - Very good on taste. Better than the rice. Quantity was also enough. Go for the CHOW instead of RICE coz the CHOW rocks.

5. Schezwan  Fish - Beautifully done. Decent pieces of fish nicely done in the gravy and tastes very good.

6. Mongolian Chicken - This one was also good. Average chicken pieces and the gravy was good.

Actually the starter CRISPY CHILLI BABY CORN killed the tastes of SCHEZWAN FISH & MONGOLIAN CHICKEN. Its taste was so beautiful and spicy that the rest felt numb. Also the SERVICE is very slow but the waiters are well behaved.

Now came the BILL and it was smiles all over. DECENT PRICING. Will surely visit this place again. For those in-a-relationship, do bring your partner here for a good enough experience.

'Average' would be my only description.I was starving when i went in,undaunted by the drab building that housed it.
The ambience was a surprise,with the roses and the candle and the muted lights.....it all served to orchestrate a very romantic,date-y decor!
The first setback was the service...it is slow.And,in my opinion,hunger and slow service is the one worst combination in history.
We ordered heart of kolkata as a starter....it was spicy,good but nothing exceptional....but i wolfed it down all the same.....

Next came some veg ching young noodles or something....which was totally a disaster....it had a wierd smell that put me off and the bang bang chicken tasted exactly like the starter itself!It was supposed to contain black bean sauce,but i didn't find a trace.....
Overall,i wouldn't go there if i can help it!

This place is totally unbelievable! It is located in the heart of Ultadanga inside a building. It's pretty easy to figure out if you know the landmarks around and there is also a giant sign above guiding those who want to 'come hungry, leave happy'.

Once inside, you can't help but admire the classiness of the decor and ambiance. That being said the place is ideal for a nice date with your partner (they even make it a candlelight dinner to uplift the moment) - things can only get better after you dine here. It is quite spacious. Plus there is always nice music playing in the background and by nice I mean not typical, which is really hard to come across these days.

Now for the food, the dishes are amazing. The quantity is quite good and the price is also reasonable. The quality is simply mouth watering and the choices of dishes is also excellent. The only set back I faced a few times is the slow service but trust me if you're on a date or with your friends - you would hardly notice.

Rosenberg is definitely a must visit and you'll be back there again even before you realize! It has all the right combinations to make your evening perfect! ;)

Ambiance: 5
Service: 4

Value for money: 5

Rosenberg: A little place of peace just beside the heavy crowd of ultadanga !

It is in the first floor of a building. You just can not make out how fine this place is until you step in. A quite place with a few number of tables and i t has a dark overlay. The walls are decorated with fancy objects with shadows.  The tables and chairs are carefully located so that no one's privacy gets disturbed. It has a capacity to accommodate 50-60 people at a time.

If you are with your girlfriend, rosenberg gives you some extra privileges you will definitely fall for. They will place a beautiful candle at your table to give the flavor of candle light dinner. Though I always went there with my friends so I missed the opportunity but they play romantic songs in the background which I love a lot. 

Now I will come to the main point, the food ! I have not tested their indian cuisine but had the chinese which I found very good. Their dishes are sumptuous and spicy. I would like to recommend some dishes which I found their awesomeness. Heart of kolkata: Four pieces of chicken wings marinated with so many spices, wine and others. It was so spicy that brought tears in my eyes. Kung-po chicken: It is like most other chinese dishes but with a different taste and a lot of green chillies. Well this particular plate is not for weak stomach. Devil chicken: Truly devil. It goes best with fried rice. Over all it is a very good experience having food there. 

Next time I want to go there with my girlfriend. Well the only thing I found bad about rosenberg is their service delay. It is annoying if you are starving. Otherwise, the staffs are good, well behaved. Lots of love for rosenberg :)

I would have given this a higher rating. 
I am a fan of quaint eateries. That being said, Rosenberg, being located on the first floor of a seemingly unimpressive building in ultadanga, with a really warm decor and just the right amount of lighting to add a romantic touch, should've been my absolute favourite. The food, too, was pretty decent.  So were the prices. Add to that a candlelight for couples n u truly hold perfection. 
BUT.....here's where they messed up: the waiters. We got a wrong dish brought to us, and the waiter argued and tried to get us to accept it anyway.  While getting that changed, the gravy went cold. Also, the fellow simply wouldn't respond to our calls after that. That was a serious letdown.
Anyway,  I hope things will look up in the near future.

The crispy baby corn was also quite good. The staff was well behaved. I would love to visit this restaurant again. 
We ordered Crispy Baby Corn, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Noodles and Chili Chicken and the price was around 700 which was quite reasonable for three people and the quantity was also quite OK.
