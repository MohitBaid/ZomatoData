It has always been a pleasure eating out here. I am a person who goes on trying new food. Plus, I am always in a hunt for good ambiance.¬†
True to its words! SpiceKraft fueled my thoughts and took me to my La La Land. It has been my third time and I still get wooed by their menu and preps. The staff here is amiable and mark my words to always go by their recommendations. :)

Lunch at spice Kraft was an overwhelming one. The trip started with the Red Grape & basil twister mocktail which not only cherished the tastebuds but also refreshed us for the starters. Well the starters that were tried was Fish-en-papiolette . For the main course we went for Baked fish Wellington. Also one of the checkpoints was that the fish was smooth textured and was melt in the mouth. Of the aglio olios that I have tried this place has made one of the best sphagetti pasta aglio olio. I would personally recommend to try beyond fried ice cream for the dessert. Alongwith great food we were secured with pretty ambiance and service.

This place was in my bucket list for a long long time. Finally went there today with my friends. Its located near hazra law college. This place serves the best Continental,Asian & Middle Eastern food. The interior is quite amazing & provides a fantastic ambience with the dim lights.

We had ordered -
1. Tangerita - It's a mixture of Orange juice,Pineapple Juice & a bit of green chilli to get the flavour.
2. Fish En Papillote - It's a fish wrapped in a paper bag which taste excellent with the dip.
3. Beer Can Tempura Fish - It's a crispy fish fried & served inside a beer can & is provided with an orange dip which add more taste to it.
4. Penne Pasta Alfredo Non Veg - It's pasta cooked with a creamy parmesian cheese with chicken.
5. Baked Fish Wellington - It's a bhetki served in a rich cheese with mushrooms,Served with saffron pilaf.
6.Classic Monte Carlo- It's an ice cream containing chocolate & vanilla flavour with Choco Sticks.

All the dishes were brilliant !üëç Hats off to the chef for such amazing preparation. The staff is very friendly and courteous & the service was excellent. This place surely needs to be visited by the people who love Continental Cuisine. Highly recommended.‚ò∫

Courteous staff, nice decor, if only a bit stuffy. The waiters were constantly asking me to shift a little because we were apparently blocking the doorway, but they always said please. Food was delicious, and exotic but the portions were small. On the plus side, drinks were just marvellous! 
P.S. They make a really toxic LIIT! ;)

This is a wonderful restaurant in ballygung. The ambience was nice and the food was very palatable. I ordered a kokum Rita mock which was very refreshing. In the food department I had tandoori chicken sausage, baked fish murg zarka tikka and shepherds pie which were all commendable. The best part was the deserts which included 100% Jack Daniels and Barry callebaut which was something I have never tasted before. In short it is a place to visit definitely.

Okay so this is one of the most heard places in South Kolkata.. Without wasting much of a time.. Let's get into the stuffs that I choosed for myself.. It started with the "Red Grape and Basil Twister" mocktail.. Which gave a kick start to my dinner ‚ò∫Ô∏è Then I opted for two starters, namely "Murg Zakaria Tikka" which was phenomenal and "Bacardi Limon Infusion Tand Chicken Sausage" which again was presented very differently with a dropper which consisted some mixture consisting Bacardi.. And again this was mind blowing.. Now for the main course I opted this continental dish called "Shepherds Pie" and it tasted just wow üòç.. To wrap it up nothing can beat their "100% Jack Daniel's & Barry Callebaut" Dessert üç∞
Overall it was an amazing experience.. The ambience was pretty good.. Food awesome.. Definitely a great restro at a very affordable price

I had ordered virjin mojito which was very refreshing, Lymwn Samak & Beer can tempura fish for starters, Baked Fish Wellington & Griled Fish with lemon butter sauce and Classic Monte Carlo for desserts. The food was really delicious especially their Lymwn Samak & Baked Fish Wellington.
Looking forward to visit them again.

For mocktails, I would definitely recommend the cucumber cooler. Very refreshing.
For starters, I had the lymwn samak and dajaj chermoula. Both very delicious. The presentation of the dajaj chermoula was very pretty and a very tasty dish as well. My favourite of the two was lymwn samak. If you like fish, I would highly recommend this dish.
For mains, I opted for continental. I had shepherd's pie and  baked fish wellington. Both perfect. The shepherd's pie especially was too good.
For dessert, I had the Classic Monte Carlo. As a chocolate lover myself, a perfect sweet end to a very good experience overall.

Other than the food, the ambiance and the service was also up to the par. Cheers!

Well I thought to give a 5* review.. Yeah truly this restora deserves this..I went to this place on 1st January.. The new year..thought we will face a long queue..lucky we were that the queue was not that long..we ordered dajaj charmoula ..a smoky bamboo flavourd it was..then we ordered Beer can tampura fish(it was fish batter fry but extremely light and fluffy and crispy)..then went for main course and took Lobster thermidor and poached Vetki Cardinale.. Both were wholesome dish..and extremely tasty..üòçin dessert we took chocolate pudding with ice-cream .. The combination of extreme hot and cold..
But their staff behaviour could be better..as there kitchen  was about to close they told to leave within 4pm..but they even didn't serve the food within 4..so for that 0.5 is deducted.. But I will visit this place for its continental delicacies. üòõüòú

SpiceKraft requires no introduction as far as fusion and continental cuisine is concerned in South Kolkata. I was quite impressed with their service and appropriate decor which set the mood for a cosy evening, although the dip in mercury in the city was something I am yet to get used to. I ordered a Highland Ball, a Whiskey concoction with Cointreau and Tequila to add to the punch of the weather and had  a couple of amazing appetisers to go with it.The Bacardi Lemon Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausage and Kele Ka Pool were delectable to say the least.The Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce and the Shepherd's Pie were my ultimate indulgence in the Mains section, again plated right and balanced in their execution. The classic Monte Carlo was my ultimate sin which helped me achieve foodgasm in the most subtle ways to be mentioned. A very good experience at a very reasonable pricing leaves no room for anything except the best rating possible.

In this chilly winter an awesome dinner at SpiceKraft made my day. Although it gives varieties of Indian, Continental & Asian dishes. I had Doodh Cola with Khele Ke Phool in the starters which was a great combination of cheese on jackfruit & fried snack beneath it. Then I ate Penne Pasta Alfredo it was filled up with veggies & cheese with the ambience & the slow music it was delight to have one of its kind. Last but not the least the desert Monte Carlo it was the best I ever had it, each & every bite of it was so fantastic that I loved it very much. Wish to drop down again with friends.

This place had been on my bucket list for quite some time and finally went there for lunch with my best friend. This restaurant adds wonderful twist to the simple ordinary food. The interiors are very well decorated. The head chef comes up to each table to ensure we're having a great time. Staff is very friendly and courteous.
Coming to the food. We ordered
1. Kiwi and mango collins
2. Beer can tempura fish
3.Dajaj charmoula
4. Shepherd's pie
5. Baked fish Wellington
6. Monte Carlo
Dajaj charmoula and beer can tempura fish were tasty. Baked fish Wellington (highly recommended) is delicious ,mouth-watering. It was bhetki with creme and cheese layers on it. We personally did not like shepherd's pie. Monte carlo was pretty classic , tasty.
But I think this place is quite over hyped to  be honest.
Ambience 5/5
Food 4/5 ( 1 Mark is deducted as we didn't like shepherd's pie)
Value for money 3.5/5
Hospitality 5/5.

Located on Hazra Road, right opp the CU law college, Spice Kraft is the just the perfect pick if you are looking forward to a  fulfilling meal, in terms of both quality and quantity. Having heard so much about this place I finally took time out to visit here right after New Year's. I was particularly impressed by their extensive menu, which means a lot of options to choose from a variety of Indian, Chinese and Continental and the presentation of every dish served. 
Coming to the food,
 
For starters we ordered: 
Dajaj Charmoula (chicken legs served in pots with a tasty white dip) 
Beer can tempura fish (fish fried in beer batter) 
Lymwn Samak (grilled fish)
Grilled asparagus tarts
Roast turkey pantheras
(The last two from their Christmas special menu) 

For the main course:
Mixed Hakka Noodles (abundant in chicken prawn and egg)
Spicy chicken with orange peel (which is highly recommended if you have a taste for more of sweet and less of spice in gravy) 
Hunan Fish 
Nasen Goreng (a rice based dish, again highly recommended) 

Coming to drinks we opted for mocktails. I tried Virgin Mojito and Cucumber cooler which were good.

An overall great dining experience. Would surely visit very soon to try out the other exciting dishes.

Spice Kraft is one of the most popular and happening restaurants in Kolkata at the moment, and I'm writing this review after my third visit. 
The restaurant is located just a few steps ahead of the Ballygunge Fari petrol pump. The ambience is nice and warm, and the decor is also pretty good. 
Spice Kraft serves some of the best mocktails, and knowing that I went for the Red Grape and Basil Twister. It was a nice, cool and sweet drink. One of my accompanions tried the Cucumber cooler. It's a very unique mocktail, unlike any I've tasted before. It's got a freshness and also a zing due to the small bits of bellpepper. 
For starters, we tried the famous Dajaj Charmoula - succulent chicken lollypops marinated with special spices and herbs and grilled inside claypots - which was exceptional as always.
Next we tried the Beer Can Tempura Fish - another signature dish of Spice Kraft, and another extremely appetizing starter. We also tried the Murgh Zarka Tikka, which is a classic chicken tikka kebab with a more fashionable name. 
The starters were so delicious and by this time we were more than half full, so we didn't go overboard with the main course. We ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles and Hunan Fish - both dishes were decent. 
Although we were full by now, still we didn't want to give the dessert a miss and so we tried the Christmas special - the Christmas pudding. Although the dessert looked pretty Instagram worthy, it was probably the only item I didn't like that much amongst an otherwise excellent array of dishes.

This place lives up to it's name and reputation. Everything from the mocktail to main course is a show of the intricacies of different spices. The platters are impeccably presented and the taste is beyond comparison. I had the Kokum Rita mocktail. For starters I had Suckling Pig(confit apple portwine) and a Christmas special called Roast Turkey Pantheras with Basil Pesto. The Suckling pig was amazing , presented in bite size ,tapas style. The turkey ‚Äãwas tender and juicy and it just melts in the mouth. Finally I had Shepherd's Pie for main course. It's a classic British dish consisting of tender pieces of lamb baked with creamy mashed potatoes. Prices are quite reasonable and the food quality is super high. This is a gem of a place in the heart of South Calcutta. If you haven't visited it yet then book a table ASAP!

The best place in the city to have  continental food. It was just amazing right from the beginning- mocktails,starters and the main course. the ambience is just perfect.service was really nice. I just loved the place.it was my first time in spicekraft and m sure it wont be my last time .
Here are the details of some of the delicacies that I ordered :
Cucumber cooler -I bet that it is the best mocktail. Do give it a try and u ll be amazed.

Roast turkey pantheras basil pesto- It was just outstanding.I have no words to describe the taste of this dish. It's a must try for everyone.

Murg zarka tikka- I am a fan of kebabs. I have tasted kebabs of some of the very well known North indian restaurants.I can bet that spicekraft is equally good in North indian delicacy as well. Murg zarka tikka just melts in your mouth. It was just <3

Roast chicken buffath- It was just mind blowing. Not many restaurants serve roasted chicken. Even if they do so, they are no where near to spicekraft when it comes to taste. Do give it a try and u ll not be disappointed.

So this place deserved a review since long!! 
Because :
1. I have visited this place at least not less than 5 times. So you can understand that the food is really good so that you keep going back to the same place again and again. 
2. The quality of food was the same everytime!! Which indeed is great! 
Since I used to be so engrossed in eating I never really cared to click pictures and put a review but a friend of mine recently shared the importance of reviewing a place no matter how good or bad it is.. Coz many people just look forward to the review and visit a place. So honest reviews are appreciated. 
Going back to the food we ordered :
1.Kokum Rita : A tangy sweet drink made with rock salt and kokum fruit.. It just gives you a hit when you drink it. Perfect for people who doesn't have alcohol. 
2.Dajaj charmoula : Soft and succulent chicken legs grilled and cooked to perfection.
3.Ke croque monsieur lymwn samak : It's fish baked to perfection with subtle seasoning and cheese.. It will just melt in your mouth. 
4.Chicken nasi goreng : Its a variety of fried rice served with prawn crackers  a poached egg on top. 
5.Hunan FISH : shallow fried fish in a Hunan gravy which almost goes with every main dish! 
6. Christmas special pudding : Though this won't be in the menu for long as it's season special but it was worth a try. Rich cinnamon  cake which is served with ice-cream and caramel syrup and wafers. 
So next time just drop in and pamper your taste buds.

This is a place I would love to visit again and again.¬†
The food was extraordinary, each and every item were delicious right from the drinks and starters to the desserts. The Beer Can Tempura Fish is a must try along with Dajaj Chermoula. Hats off to the chef for pulling off such dishes so perfectly though the Jack Daniels Mousse could be a little better. Their signature cocktails are very good and gives a lot of options to explore.¬†
The staff is very helpful and will explain each and everything you ask them. The place is small and gets crowded easily but it is worth the mouth watering food.

Overrated and Overhyped. Had huge expectations courtesy the gala certificate zomato reviewers have issued here; and spice kraft miserably failed to deliver!!! I simply do not understand why peoole go crazy over their signature dishes!!! Whats so special? While eating i was totally in disbelief that people drool over such average quality dishes!!

Kokum Rita mocktail---Its a berry from western parts of india but now available in kolkata. Its sour with a sweet punch. Much alike our indigenous Kamranga. To make it even more chatpata, they added lemonüòÉ OMG. And some spices. Tasted like roadside masala coldrink.

Dajaj Charmoula (Dejaj is the original term. They use Dajaj)---Probably the most hyped dish of calcutta!!! Whats in it? 4 pieces of chicken leg prepared as fine tandoori served with a orange flavoured sweet curd-sauce dip. Its not the big leg pieces that you get in typical tandoori. Just the distal thigh muscles and leg. Small ones. But boy they try to make those look 'biggg' by putting them in micro jars. When you see the dish coming, it would appear 4 juggernaut pieces are en-route. But, once it disembarks on the table, you know your high hopes have been ditched! The micro jars are half filled with blocks of wood!!!  The taste is very average. Its a common trend for so called fine dining restaurants to name their dishes in exotic names. Good tactics for an eyewash. If you are claiming it to be a lebanese dish, make sure you provide it in the way its served in lebanon. Not something so ridiculous. Innovative presentation is good; but it should be intelligent! I was amused. How can this dish gain such popularity? üòÉ

A prawn preparation---i dont exactly remember the name. We opted dry. Very average again. Prawn pieces were small amd thin.

Khor khog--A chinese dish. The waiter started explaining how the dish in made as we were bit sceptical if the lamb served would be hard and chewy as often is. He started in English, jumbled up his words, took respite in bengali, and finished his lecture in englishüòÇ Thats funny. We were speaking in bengali all throughout. English doesnt buy class. Coming to the dish, pieces of minced lamb in bell pepper prepared in tomato and soya sauce. Quite soft, and thats the only plus point. Otherwise, very very average!!!

Jack Daniel Mousse---Another hyped item. Its even worse than the Chermoula. 4 pieces of dry lemon cake with white mousse infused with alcohol. Sounds innovative, tastes stupid.

Pocket pinch---These dishes came at 1900+ inclusive of 18% GST. So, not pocket friendly right?

Quantity---Single dish single person. Forget sharing.

Service--On the slower side. Waiters stand and gossip. You need to call them for everything, including change of plates to refilling of water glasses.

Strictly one timer restau for me.

This place is quite over hyped to be honest.
Ambience- nothing special. The seating area is rather small and the table sizes not enough to accommodate multiple cuisines at the same time.
Hospitality - Below par. The waiters were hardly concerned as to who wants what once, the initial round of food is served. They don't warn, before serving strong drinks to women, which is religiously done in places like Bar-B-Q and Someplace Else. Despite our insistence our table wasn't shifted.
Service - One dish came 40 minutes after the other, despite no major rush.
Taste - Here comes the main bummer. We were recommended to order Dajaj Chermoula and Bacardi infused Tandoori Chicken sausages. Now, I am not someone who enjoys the smoky flavor of Tandoori much. The waiter insisted us to go for these dishes and said the Dajaj Chermoula, is a Lebanese dish, I was expecting it to be on the lines of what we have at Shawarma Nation or Go Lebanese, but it was plain Tandoori Chicken in white color. The sauce served along with it, tasted pathetic. The Bacardi infused Tandoori Chicken sausages were lesser of a Tandoori than the Dajaj Chermoula, they didn't taste bad per se, but again the blue sauce that came with it, was pathetic. Finally we summoned the waiter and inquired him about not giving us a heads up about the preparations of these dishes, to which, he said these are the signatures dishes of Spice Kraft so he recommends them to everyone. This one size fits all approach pissed us off. We then ordered my favorite dish Coq-Au-Vin, which came almost an hour later, was decent enough.
Bar menu - We asked the waiter for the stronger cocktails on which, he recommended their Batman. It was lethal and made us almost unconscious. I wish the waiter warned us, before serving it. I know, I ordered a strong drink, but I was expecting LIIT level strong,not 20 pegs of whiskey level strong.
We didn't order any desserts as the Jack Daniel's mousse was not available.

The best place to have Fusion Food in town.
Starting from appetizers to desserts every single dish won my heart. They have a wide range of moctails too. The must try out dish is DAJAJ CHARMOULA smoked chicken served in a earthen cup with a white sauce.
The interior decor is quite soothing and even the service is spontaneous.
All together a nice place to dine out with friends and family.
Loved the place a lot.

This beautiful little restaurant located conveniently near Ballygunge Phari has been winning hearts for a long time now. The ambience is very nice with interesting lighting and beautiful decor. The staff was courteous, friendly and prompt. One of the reasons that makes this place stand out is their presentation. You'll know for yourself when you're there.
For starters, "Le Croque Monsieur Lymwn Samak" is a fish dish which has a sweet-tangy-mustardy flavour and it literally melts in your mouth. The Roast Turkey Pantheras Basil Pesto is a Christmas special and it's sure to bowl you over. The Beer Can Tempura Fish is an all time favourite to one and all, of course.
For the main course, the Mixed Hakka Noodles was pretty standard, well cooked strings with flavourful bits of meat. The Spicy Orange Peel Chicken is a real winner. You'd expect all chicken dishes to be spicy but this sweet preparation is sure to make you want more.
For dessert, the Christmas Pudding Flam Kulk has Christmas in its title, it's another Christmas special. It's a sort of brownie with cashewnuts and tutti-frutti with a scoop of vanilla icecream in a bed of caramel and two slices of wafer alongside it. In short, Yum!
The Hot Apple Cider was amazing, so was the Tangarita mocktail.
It's really a gastronomical pleasure to be here.

Quite good, but over-rated for the 4.8 Zomato rating.  The Dajaj Charmoula & Lymwn Samak, both Lebenaese, were exceptional starters but the Coq-Au-Vin as the main entree was disappointing.  The gravy was thicker than it ought to have been, and too much of the Red wine jus made for a more pungent flavour than French cuisine should be.  The very dim lights made it difficult to read the menu.

Spice kraft is suitable for gatherings for it's‚Äã ambience. The place has a dim lighting which is suitable for romantic dates. The wide variety of menu with delicious is one more reason for people to visit that place again and again.Things to try out from the menu is Hot Apple Cider, Cucumber cooler, Chicken straganoff, Baked fish canollis, Fish en papilotte, Lobster thermidor and from the dessert 100% Jack Daniels mousse.

After a lot of recommendation from everyone, I finally managed to tick of this place and for a lunch at Spice Kraft.

Location - Near Ballygaunge Phari (petrol pump) take the first left and start walking, you will reach your destination

Ambience - I must say that the place is worth every appreciation. The place is exquisitely decorated with dim blue light and gives a warm feeling. The walls were where their wine collection were decorated which viewed admirable.

What we had -
1. Red grape & Basil twister (moctail)
2. Dajaj Charmoula (starters)
3. Buffath, ORNG sausage Roast Turkey (starters)
4. Panthers Basil Pesto Shepherds Pie ( main course) recommended.
5. Baked Fish Wellington ( main course) recommended.

The moctail was refreshing, and food here is amazing both in terms of presentation and taste. A visit here is highly recommended for foodies and people who like trying new cuisine.

Located in Ballygunge, this place has terrific starters. The decor and ambience is beautiful. A good place to spend quality time with loved ones.

Sarson wali Machhi - it had big chunks of bekti fish. Topped with a very light tasting mustard and mozzarella cheese. The taste of mustard was not very pungent.

Roast turkey pantheras - one plate had 6 big pieces of pantheras. The filling was of juicy turkey and cheese. This being the Christmas special is not available throughout the year.

Classic Christmas pudding - rich Christmas fruit cake with a base of cinnamon syrup topped with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Has a strong cinnamon taste, so if someone who doesn't like too much of dried spice taste, this dish is not for you.

On a whole, a good place to dine at.

Yes, it deserves 5/5. This is 1st January, 2018 and we had to wait for an hour before getting our seat. The waiting was boring but it turned out to be extremely satisfactory. We ordered for beer can tempura fish, roasted turkey (Christmas menu), dajaj charmoula and two cocktails, both made of Smirnoff. The cocktails we ordered were blue electric and hazelnut heaven. Every item, I mentioned was unique and tremendously tasty. I am so happy to such nice food. I must mention the behaviour of the staff. Courteous, prompt and polite they are. My new year's day went well. You please, don't miss this place.

Then coming to the quality of food..I don't know if it was only me or not but as soon as the food touched my tongue it gave me a soothing pleasure. Must tries are Canned beer tempura fish, Chicken Charmoula, Coq-au-vin, Sheperd's pie. Although we did not get the Jack Daniels Mousse as it was out of stock. But overall a foodgasmic experience and a must try out place for all foodies.

First of 2018 but a long due one of 2017. 

Having heard a lot about SpiceKraft, We zeroed down to visit this place during Durga Pooja I.e. 24/09/2017. 

I must say that it was a pretty sluggish start for them.  Even though 11am is the time they open as per many sites as well here on Zomato, they were yet to tee off even at 12 noon. So having reached 11:30 am, we had to wait till 12 noon to get inside. 

A few hicupps in giving us desired table during the start but after a bit of haggling and bickering over table. We were given a decent table and we were the the only one. So, couldn't get around my head their reluctance to give specific table. 

We settled in and waited for menu but soon the confusion starts over menu as the regular menu is temporarily replaced with Pooja Special Menu. A bit of management lapse there as no need to give regular menu if that is discontinued even temporarily. 

Now, to the crux of the review.

Listing the recommended ones only with rating. 

Baked Fish Wellington - üëå üëåüëåüëåüëå (Awesome + Lajawab; Fish was Bhetki but not sure that they make it with Bhetki on regular basis) 
COQ - AU - VIN - üëåüëåüëåüëå ( Quite god. A fashion food.)
DAJAJ CHARMOULA - üëåüëåüëåüëå ( A Lebenonese preparation of Chicken, I really liked the lemon flavour) 

We also tried some mocktails but these are not main attractions of this place as I felt from taste. They were decent. 

Overall it was a decent experience.  There is scope of improvement on servicing. 

Even though 1st visit was not that great would love to visit again.

Small package, big surprise - that's how I would describe this little restaurant that has so much to offer. Starting from beautiful cocktails to innovative dishes, they have it all. Located just behind the Ballygunj Petrol Pump, they have amazing food presentations that will not just soothe your taste buds but the eyes too. Visited a while back, my favourites are :

‚Ä¢ Beer Can Tempura fish (4.5/5)
‚Ä¢ Dajaj Charmoula (5/5)

I've also tried few drinks from the wide array of cocktails they serve : Vodkatinis, Hazelnut heaven and boozerts.

I absolutely loved the cocktails. Would come back anyday for these again. ‚ù§

The food is good, the service was excellent. But if you are eating continental food, which IS their specialty, the estimated pocket pinch is way off! Be prepared to pay around ‚Çπ900 per person!
I have had continental food in restaurants across Calcutta more times than I can count, this by far was the most expensive, when you compare, price to quantity.
We had started off with Beer can tampura fish which was really good, then we ordered the Roast Turkey Pantheras which was a new year special and was equally great, finally we had the Dajaj Chermoula, which tasted great, but don't be fooled by the size of the container, half of it is a block of wood.
Moving on to the main course, we ordered the fish wellington, which we were expecting to be quite filling since it is ideally supposed to be deep fried with a batter coating and filled with stuffing, but what showed up on our table was two pieces of fish covered in cheese on a tiny portion of cooked rice. Next we ordered the shepherd's pie, for which we were hoping for a decent sized casserole based on prior experience, but again to our dismay, what we got was two small clay pots. Then our waiter recommended us the Roast chicken Buffath, and described it in a manner that would give you the idea that it was an entire chicken served on mashed potato, what showed up instead, was a single chicken leg piece on some mashed potato. I have no idea what was going on in the person's mind, that would provoke him to recommnd something like that to 4 people sharing a single food. Finally left with no other options, we asked the guy to bring whatever noodles they had so that we could atlest fill up. He brought us some kind of a Szechwan noodle. The noodles were not nearly as good as what we had so far.
If you do happen to come here, I would recommend taking the kiwi & mango collins. I would not recommend the chinese based on the single noodle dish that we took to fill our stomachs, because we were going way over budget. I have no idea about the Indian food though.

With an impressive beverage list to start with,this place serves some smashingly cool mocktails- #RedGrapeBasilTwister being my pick,differently refreshing it leaves you wanting more :)

With a twist in everything that's served,the food compliments the place in every way.

DAJAJ CHARMOULA & ROAST TURKEY(seasonal)
are absolutely divine and must haves.

All this coupled with some really good ambience and the super friendly staff,Spice Kraft is definately a place to experience.

Had an awesome contemporary anglo Indian dining experience at Spice Kraft. Ordered quite a few items. And each of the items reflected innovation and perfection in its own way.

Below are the item wise descriptions:

Tangarita: 
A mocktail with orange juice, pinable juice, club soda and a hint of Green Chilly...
The green chilly added the x-factor in the drink and makes it different than any normal mocktail.

Poached beckti cardinale:
A continental starter where fish is poached in white dry wine and then served with Cardinale sauce which consists of Mozzarella Chease and herbs.
Taste wise superb. The fish just melts in your mouth. The presentation added the extra edge..

Suckling pig confit : 
Again a starter which I would like to recommend to all the pork lovers.
It's a slowly cooked pork in its own fat with rosemary apples and port-win-jus (a sauce made from reduced port wine).

Dajaj Chermoula:
A Lebanon dish..
Char grilled Chicken marinated with Chermoula spices.
Chermoula is a lemony mixture of spices, garlic, and fresh herbs that‚Äôs used primarily to marinate chicken or fish.

Baked Fish Wellington: 
Calcutta Beckti  baked in rich Chease sauce with mushrooms, served with saffron pilaf..
It should be taken as main course. It offers a perfect balance of Protien, carb and fibre.

Roast Chicken Buffath: 
Another anglo-indian main course with spicy gravy-rich chicken, bread and assorted veggies. and herbs.
Taste wise superb.

I am grateful to Spicekraft for taking me through this Anglo Indian journey of food. 
Fusion, Innovation and Perfection, that's what you get in Spicekraft..
A perfect thumbs up!

In the Continental section, the Coq Au Vin and Baked Fish Wellington are superb. In the Chinese section, the combination of Moon Faan with the Chicken Fish preparation is heaven.

What's the best way to get rid of your post Christmas blues than eating some really good food and sipping cocktails with your buddies! The Dim lights, slow music and friendly staff of Spice Kraft serves you with the perfect ambience where you can enjoy mouth watering food with your friends and talk your heart out.
Now let's talk about the food:
For starters I had the gorgeous Roast Turkey Pantheras Basil Pesto. The presentation was neat and just forces you to put one in your mouth instantly. The creamy inside was heavenly and the pesto compliments it perfectly.
For main I had Baked Fish Canollis. When you put the fish in your mouth it just melts immediately. You can feel the freshness of it. The rice served with it is cooked to the perfection. You can separate each grain with a fork. Just amazing!
For drinks I ordered the famous Manhattan. A perfectly made cocktail is a must with every food. It was well balanced with burboun. The gorgeous red color was to die for.

A perfect place for a orgasmic culinary experience. A perfect pallet served in the winter. Tried the Lymwn Samak in starters, a Lebanese pick, an Arabic styled lemon flavored grilled fish, I would rather describe it as a lovely harmony of lemon and Bekti, grilled to perfection... one should try it with a dry Sauvignon Blanc to enhance the gastronomical journey. As per Chef's choice, the selection for the Entree was the Christmas Special Roast Chicken Buffath served with Orange Sauce and Lyonnaise Potatoes. A lovely meat dish with a slight citric touch, no doubt a lovely selection. One can try this out with a Argentenian Malbec or a Merlot .. Even a Shiraz or Cabernet Sauvignon will perfectly balance this dish. Thank You Spice Kraft, for the Lovely Crafted Evening!!

SpiceKraft! This cozy little yet spacious multi cuisine diner was on the hit list for quite sometime now. The cold winter night and the urge of the lovely menu brought me today here. Chef Sambit didn't dissapoint at all. So we tried our hands with the mocktail to start off. I tried out the Sangria. It's a red wine based muddled fruits cocktail. Served in a tall wine glass with diced cubes of apple that gives it the sweetness along with the tangyness of the wine at the back of your palate. For starter I tried the all fabled - "Beer Can Tempura Fish" and bam it was amazing. Served in the budweiser can(empty üòâ) fried to the T and had the criapy yet the sweetness of the barley in it. My guess it is marinated in the beer batter and fried golden. For the mains, I tried out the fish. Being a bengali at heart, mind, soul fish is something you can not fool me with. If its good it's good, if not it's not. Simple. #Spicekraft with their signature Poached Beckti Cardinale was amazing. The fish was coated in the signature sauce. It was served alongwith herb rice as the companion. Marvellous is all I can say. Chef Sambit and the team, kudos to you for the delightful evening.

‚Ä¢Ordered: Dajaj Charmoula, Shepherd's Pie, Hitman and the Painkiller.

‚Ä¢Ambience: 5 star. Light background music, dimmed light. Well organized table and everything.

‚Ä¢Staffs: they were really courteous and helped us throughout the menu and the service was quite prompt.

‚Ä¢Food quality: I am rating this place 5 star only because of the food quality. The Dajaj Charmoula and its dip was heavenly. Shepherd's pie was an Xmas special item. It's the best I ever tasted. It melted in the mouth. Very well cooked.
Now coming to the cocktails, both were awesome. I will personally place Hitman on top though. The painkiller was a tangy vodka cocktail. Hitman on the other hand was whiskey based.

If you talk about services and food quality, I couldn't resist giving more than 5 stars, sadly it's not possible. All of the waiters and manager himself was so customer oriented, I have barely seen in other restaurants. The food and wine were great. Damn, it's super experimental and a must visit place in the city.

What's a better way to spend Christmas than eating good food! And Spice Kraft satisfied us to the core. Let me tell you, we were a bit late and given the fact that it was Christmas there was a long queue but the FnB manager was very cooperative and very helpful. He personally looked into the matter and even arranged a seat for us. The staff members were equally good, they gave us time to decide the menu and even explained few doubts, with patience.
Now let me come to the food. There was a different menu for Christmas and the food served was very good. We ordered Pork Ribs for starter and Then carried on with Mixed Fried Rice and Hunan Fish.
The Pork was thoroughly cooked and had a great smoky flavour, which I loved. It was accompanied with jalape√±o and amchoor chutney. Loved every bit of the Pork. As far as the Rice is concerned, it was equally good. Very light with very less oil and had a good flavour of black pepper. The gravy of the fish was amazing. The fish was very soft and it tasted superb.
Overall it was a great experience and the food was so good that we would definitely like to visit again. And once again a big thank you to the FnB manager!!

No wonder why this restaurant is one of the highest rated in Zomato!¬†
We had Beer can tempura fish which was great. Deviled crab meat- I personally did not like the taste so much.

The ambience is a little dim and can get quite cramped. The service needs to improve. The rating is simply for the food. The beer can tempura fish was crispy and flavorful and the dajaj charmoula was nice too. The shepherds pie and a chicken dish we tried for the mains were good but not exceptional. I feel much of the hype for this place comes from the presentation and not the food as much. Was very disappointed to see them not have a dessert menu for Christmas. Would have loved to try the much coveted Jack Daniels mousse.

The wonderful technique of molecular gastronomy could not possibly be portrayed in a better way. The Bacardi infused sausages, Dajaj Chermoula, Tempura and Jack Daniel Mousse are an all time favourite . The rest of the dishes that Spice Kraft offer are a treat to the eyes as well as the stomach.

Spicekraft was a long awaiting destination. Heard a lot about the different types of fusion food. When I entered I must say it has got a good decor but the space is a bit small. You may have to wait in peak hours. Food is a bit expensive but tastes good. I tried starters like dajaj charmoula, beer can tempura fish and stir fried squid rings. Squid was not that crispy which I expected. Fish tasted great and chicken I was not sure why people opt for it, only because they give in 4 containers. Main course tasted nice to me. We ordered mixed fried and a fusion dish which was mandarin fish with shredded chicken which tasted great. Overall good food but a touch expensive.

Heaven in Kolkata for food lovers
Where you will get different type of dishes from different part.

Not about only food,you  will fall in love with ambience . You can enjoy food with good taste of music.
Now come to food part 
Cucumber cooler: This one was so refreshing . It can boost up you after a tired day

For starters we ordered 
 Shepard pie : It is a old British classic dish. It filled with baked minced lamb with creamed mashed potato. It was served with garlic bread.  That was enough good 

Dajaj chamoula : It is a Lebanese dish. Four pieces of chicken which was marinated with chamoula spices placed in cup was perfect in taste. Chicken pieces was so soft.
Fish pipillote : Another good dish .

Barcardu Limon infused chicken sauce: one of the popular dish . Too good in taste

For main course
Chicken Stroganoff: It was so creamy. This was lipsmacking. Really good one

Baked fish Wellington: Fish filled with cheese. So cheesy and yummy

You can not finish your course without delicious desert 

100% jack Daniels mousse and classic Monte Carlo both were too good .

Totally in love with this place.
Don't waur

For main course,

Too be honest, went here for the rating. And man was it worth it! First of all, when you visit there, ask for Mr. Avijit as your server for the night. He would recommend the best dishes of the collection, explain every item step by step as it was prepared and the most courteous of all. Coming to food, I wouldn't suggest any dish, rather I'd say just order what you're suggested by him. Overall I'd visit a million times over!

Spice Kraft is one of my favorite resturant in Kolkata. Every time that  I've been there, Mr. Sambit Banik - the owner and also the head chef , has served something new and he treats the taste buds of his  guests perfectly . The very first visit to SPICE KRAFT , was for a friends birthday celebration and he told us the very same  day that he would love to serve us all on our birthdays with a No Repeat Menu and when he said that he meant it.We might have not celebrated all our birthdays there but he haven't repeated anything what he had served us before. The hospitality is excellent and so is the foodüëå.The ambience compliments it all and everything together makes Spice Kraft a perfect place to dine.The food is well presented & served in a very innovative way.I'm a vegetarian but even the non-vegetarian would agree that the food is excellent here.A big thumbsupüèªüëç team spice kraft for everything.It will be impossible to compare one dish with the other as for me its all equally good going by their individual taste and flavours.

Probably the best outlet in kolkata serving authentic seafood, topped with hospitable staff, decent decor and above all Mr. Sambit(Chef and Owner), who makes it absolutely memorable with his customisable food options and warm gesture. One can appreciate the knowledge and training the chef has in serving delectable offerings of international standards in our city. Don‚Äôt actually remember what we had ordered since this review comes a good 3 months after our visit there, but it was impressive enough and makes one gladly pay premium for their high quality food. One of those outlets where getting a table is quiet challenging itself speaks of its quality. And it rightly justifies its inclusion in Zomato‚Äô ‚Äògreat food no bull‚Äô column. üëç

One of our pieces of Beer can tempura fish fell down while eating. They replaced it with 2 instead without us requesting it. Such a nice gesture.

Such a great place .. Just love the decoration and the various fusion items of foods... I was totally confused during order time ..

As a started we tried shish taouk ( like reshmi chicken kabab with cheesy layer) ..it is a Lebanon dish.. The chicken was very softy 
.
Then as a main course we ordered nasi goreng (Indonesian )- a special type of mix fried rice .... It was tasty ..
I also like the Blue electric
For the dishes , we have to wait .. But it was a great experience . want to go again soon

A pretty place, perfect for family gatherings as well as romantic dates.

We started off with the Terminator which was a beer and tequila based hard drink.

For starters we had the Daraj Charmoula, Beer Can Tempura Fish, Lymn Samak and Prawn in Fragrant Coriander Sauce.

All of them were cooked to perfection. Each and every item came with their unique dip which made the dishes all the more amazing.

For the Mains, we went for the Lobster Thermidor and Shepherd's Pie. I can safely say the Thermidor blew me away. So soft and creamy. The pie was too good too. It came with creamy toasted bread to make it all the more better.

And ofcourse, having heard a lot about it, we had to try the Jack Daniels Mousse for dessert. And trust me, it was worth the rave.

The main thing that I loved about the entire experience was the fact that it did not burn a huge hole in my pocket.

For a long time, this place was on my bucket list. Thankfully I got a chance to visit there today.
The ambience was really good. The üçæ decor pleased üòå me...
Now coming to the food, we had-
Drinks-
Red grape and basil twister- A fruity mocktail, the grape taste is pretty strong which will wake you up while the basil will help you relax. Also looks very refreshing indeed.
Cucumber cooler - I liked it better. Spicy and very very refreshing.
For starters - Each and every starter shall bowl you off, but beware they might fill you up too much!
Dajaj charmoule- This is their #the dish, so obviously a must have. Insta perfect. And don't ignore the dip. If you have to order one of the dishes, order this.
Fish papillote- Ever felt fish melt jn your mouth...?
Infu and chicken sausage - Since when did chicken saucage taste rhus great, again don't ignore the dip. Very insta friendly.
Lyman samak- Again a melt in a mouth experience with their amazing dips. These starters are all insta friendly.
For main course -
Baked fish Wellington - This one was just too good. Although I like to avoid the fish dishes, this one just bowled me over.
Chicken stroganoff - The presentation was decent and the creamy taste will win you.
Shepherd's pie- The lamb felt good. The lamb meat flavours was quite prominent in the dish.
For dessert -
Classic Monte Carlo - This was pretty classic, tasty and basic.
100% Jack Daniel and Barry Calibeut - When it came to our table, I was just looking at it for sometime. It was my first time having this. It was one of the most beautiful desserts and the taste was just too good.

Staff were courteous and helpful, pretty fast service. And they didn't delay the desserts much which was great.

the best foodie experience I've had till date. A MUST visit for every foodie!

One of the best restaurants not in just South Kolkata, but the entire Kolkata city! 
Tried the hot apple cider, dajaj Charmoula, fish papilotte, infu fand chicken sausage for starters baked fish Wellington, chicken strogannof, Shepherd's pie for main course and Jack Daniels and barry callebaut and Classic Monte Carlo for Desserts.

The fish papilotte's taste is still lingering in my mouth, it was so delicious. All the continental main courses, especially the stroganoff was the perfect blend of the ingredients and a treat to the tastebuds as well as the eye. The Jack Daniels dessert was a really innovative dish, had it for the first time here, and enjoyed it! Had a cold and the hot apple cider with a little tangy taste was the best thing ever! 

Excellent presentation of each of the dishes, very well mannered staff, and beautifully decorated interiors make this restaurant a remarkable place to lunch or dine at.

Leave whatever you are doing and visit Spice Kraft if you even dare call yourself a foodie

If you live in the vicinity and have not been to this place, then you MUST. A beautifully done up restaurant, it will definitely delight your tastebuds.

DRINK :

‚óè  Kool Cucumber with Smirnoff - A tangy drink with tiny shreds of cucumber in it. SO SO refreshing.

STARTERS :

‚óè  Dajaj Charmoula - Charred chicken pieces cooked in aromatic wood. 
‚óè Beer Can Tempura Fish - Soft fish with crispy coating served inside Budweiser cans.
‚óè Prawn in Fragrant Coriander Sauce - Soft prawn pieces with a hint of tanginess.

All the above items came with separate dips, and the dips were to die for.

MAIN COURSE :

‚óè  Baked Fish Wellington - Buttery soft creamy fish served with veggies and rice.
‚óè  Shepherd's Pie - Minced mutton in cream along with creamy bread pieces.

DESSERT :

‚óè  100% Jack Daniel's and Barry Callebaut - scotch in Chocolate Mousse along with pineapple sponge cakes - Will blow your mind away.

Considering how outstanding the taste was, the prices are quite low. The ambience is perfect for lunch as well as dinner and hospitality is top-notch. Will revisit soon.

To my stupefaction I found a place where I'd like to go time and again just to have everything they could possibly offer. Spice Kraft is such a den for the right kind of gastronomic experience. Unforgettable delicacies , a comforting ambience along with top notch etiquette from the staff made me give it a 5 star.

We started off with Mocktails and Doodh Cola was it for me ~ All Hail ¬†DHABA ISHTYLE!
The fresh cream and the cold milk along with the Thums Up! ¬†deserves a THUMBS UP!
Tagging along were the starters; I had my hands on the Dajaj Chermoula,Lymwn Samak and the subtly famous Beer Can Tempura Fish.¬†
I must mention how each dish tasted delicious in their own mysterious manner and had me wrapped in an understated psychedelic charm.¬†

Moving on to the MAIN COURSE chapter~
Got my tastebuds swaying to the tune of PORK RIBS which were soft and perfectly cooked. Switched to CHICKEN STROGANOFF which was also a delight. I was taken aback by the mixture of flavors in the dish put forward as the BAKED FISH CANOLLIS. Before moving on to the desserts I had the LOBSTER THERMIDOR which is definitely an additional recommendation.¬†

For the last quaint choice I went on and savoured ¬†the 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut swiss chocolate mousse , drunken petit fours and that completed my weekday lunch deal.

The entrance is rather garish and looks like the modified garage door of an old building. Once inside, the decor is dominated by black and by my estimate, seats about 50 plus people. We were the early arrivals for Sunday lunch, and barely about 15~20 % of the seats were taken, but all the empty tables carried a ‚ÄòReserved‚Äô placard. My wife and I were led into an inner chamber and offered the tiniest table in the dingiest corner of the room, and seated after removal of the ubiquitous ‚ÄòReserved‚Äô placard. The room seemed to be connecting to the service area.

Focusing on the purpose of our visit, we turned our attention to the menu cards. The establishment seems to offer a very large selection of cocktails, mocktails, and other alcoholic beverages and carries some of the best brands which usually only high-end bars and restaurants offer, but at invitingly low prices. But, alcohol being proscribed for me at the time of my visit, I had to be satisfied with a wistful thought of returning to the place at a later date. Also, the cocktails/ mocktails being served around us were presented very creatively.

Coming to food, the restaurant offers a very large selection from across continents and regions of India. For starter, we selected Subz Ki Galawat, which was a preparation of shallow fried portions of ground and spiced vegetables. We found the innovative preparation to be delicious. For main course, my choice was Coq au vin, which I expected to be roasted chicken and buttered rice. My wife‚Äôs vegetarian selection was Penne Pasta Alfredo. The roast chicken, contrary to my expectation of dry grilled type of preparation, turned out to be a preparation of chicken in gravy with mushrooms and onions, and disappointing. The Penne Pasta was greatly appreciated by my wife. To finish off, we had Monte Carlo ice cream, and Orange Glazed and Honey Tossed Darsan. The chocolate ice cream and the fried crispies served with an ice cream scoop were delightful.

Overall, the food was good; price is compelling (in fact mineral water was billed only at printed MRP!), but service and ambience is average. Recommended for budget casual dining.

Finally, alcohol being cheap, the place seemed to draw some serious drinkers, whose proximity was not comfortable for a family lunch out.

When you talk about innovation in the world of food , thats exactly when you should speak of spicekraft .
A place of new ideas blended with exquisite taste and presentation.
I started off with an unique mocktail called cool cucumber which is  the best mocktail I had ever tasted till date ...so light yet so refreshing.
Then I moved on with the starters and this is where it all began ...
 The beer can tempura fish is delectable. It is so soft and tasty along with the dip that I couldnt resist to finish off all the five or six pieces .
The main course obviously is top notch .
I tried  pork ribs and continental namely 
Shepherd's pie 
And Chicken stroganoff . Both were extremely mouthwatering .
After having so much one must never forget the desserts and sweetness it brings with itself .
So in desserts I tasted 
 Fried ice cream 
100 % jack daniels and barry callebaut 
Both equally sumptuous in every sense .
So need I say more ....
Go to spicekraft and enjoy some good fusion food .

It was my first visit to this amazing foodjoint situated near Ballygunge phari. Went there with few of my friends.
The ambiance and decor of the place is amazing. We tried out the signature dishes of spice Kraft. Starting with Tangarita which is a mocktail of orange juice and little spicy. For starters We ordered Dajaj Charmoula, which is chicken marinated with Charmoula spices and served in little pots. I personally loved this one. We ordered more dishes for starters ,namely Fish en Papillote and Lymwn samak. Both are fish preparations.
For main course we had chicken Stroganoff , shredded chicken served with rice and baked fish cannolis, a baked fish preparation with sauted veggies and rice
The staffs are helpful and cooperative. My first experience in this place have been amazing. Looking forward to my next visit here.

Craving for some continental dish? This is the perfect place where you can pleasingly satisfy your appetite. There is a whole new variety of course and an incredible conjecture of liquor and food presented in the most creative way. You should definitely try the Tempura fish, fish peppilote, Kokum Rita Mock (Mocktail), Pork ribs.

The 2 points are for the romantic dinner that this restaurant features in the Zomato collection and also for the dessert.
Coming to the food, in the entr√©e section, the Dajaj Chermoula isn‚Äôt worth the satisfaction at all, it‚Äôs quite ordinary as to something you can barbecue yourself.
The Sheesh Tawouk is a blasphemy here. It‚Äôs about time you call a chef who can cook authentic Middle-Eastern cuisine. I myself have stayed in the Middle East for 9 years. These two items mentioned above are NOT originally from Lebanon, the former originating in Northern Africa and the latter from Turkey. The items are not prepared or served in the manner written in the menu. 
However, the dessert filled the gap.  
Didn‚Äôt even take a picture of the Sheesh Tawouk because its Chicken Reshmi Kebab baked with cheese.

Spicekraft is a continental cuisine restaurant situated in Ballygunge. It gives you appetizing meals which will make you go again and again to this restaurant.
The ambience of this restaurant give you a soothing experience. I had doodh cola,Baked fish canollis, Chicken stroganoff which is a Russian favoirite with chicken cubes and bell peppers. I also had lobster thermidor stuffed with lobster meat baked in cream and mustard and fried ice  cream.
The staff was very friendly and i suggest to try this restaurant atleast once.
I give it a 5/5.

My Facebook used to get flooded with spice Kraft's beer can tempura fish and I wanted to visit it once and today was the lucky day.... Finally got a chance to have food over here..... I was thrilled.... Starting with the mocktails , the starters,the mains and the lipsmacking desserts I loved every bit of spice kraft from the decor to the food ... Even the crockery were so cute ..... Loved it !
First off we started we kokum Rita and I loved the tangy taste it had
We ordered the starters next..... Starting with dajaj chermoula , the signature dish of spice Kraft ..... And I must say that it's taste still lingers in my mouth...ever Tasted out if the world
We had pork ribs which tasted marvelous, beer can tempura fish which was so so buttery and crispy....then came lymwn samak and it is my favourite fish dish ... I also loved the other starter fish-en-papilotte.... Every bit of all the starters were lipsmacking .....
In the mains we took chicken Stroganoff which tasted awesome... Then came baked fish canolis  ..... Then came shepherd's pie which was a long awaited dish I always wanted to try ..... Then came the dessert .... We had classic Monte Carlo and it really did taste classic....
Looking forward to visiting it again

Well we visited this place last year with great expectations and trust me the food they served here lived up to the expectations!!! 
We were a team of 10 people and we ordered a great variety of food from their menu. 
Since we heard a lot about the beer can tempura fish we considered ordering it. And well..Though my friends loved it...I felt it to be slightly overrated. The fish was cooked perfectly. But I expected a slight more when I heard the name of the dish..but as we found out the starter is served in an empty beer can and hence the name! 
Anyway the fish popcorns were also cooked perfectly. And most importantly the fish they serve is fresh which most restaurants don't. So yeah a thumbs up for that. 
We had Bacardi Limon infused sausages which has a very interesting element. You have to infuse the sausages with Bacardi that comes in a dropper like thing. So yeah.. that was something unique and different and you must try that. 

Moving on to the main course. We ordered from the continental menu. There was Shepherd's Pie which they serve with toasted breads. Well.. the pie was too good but then it won't help you much if you have a great appetite. Chicken Stroganoff and Baked fish Wellington were also good and yeah if you have a great appetite (like me) go for these. 

Moving on to the desserts or as they call it Bozzarts. 
Well, we were already quite full but then since Spicecraft was surprising us with uniquely creative dishes we thought of ordering some desserts. 
We ordered Beyond Fried Ice cream which has a fried crust and is served in huge quantity. But I felt it to be a bit too sweet. Anyway I loved the fried crust and yeah you cannot have it all by yourself..You have to share it. We also ordered Cointrue, Orange and White Choc Parfait Dark fudge Torte. This was great. All my friends absolutely loved it. So I'll recommend you to surely have this. 
And from the Bar menu.. you can have Litchitini if you don't like the taste of alcohol much. 

Well, you must also try Choco Beam, Hazelnut Heaven and Hammer Jack. My friends absolutely drooled over these. But since I am not much of an alcohol lover these didn't suit my taste buds. 

So yeah, it was a pretty good experience and the staffs were very courteous. Advanced table booking is recommended.

Spice Kraft, Ballygunge. With the entrance you get a mysterious kind of feeling but believe this adventure will me amazing. In beverages, i had Hot Apple Cider, guys this will melt your heart. I had a sip and thought to have it later on but i completed it within 5 mins. Then came KELE KI PHUL, it's served with crisp pops with a sweetish paste over it and a dip is even provided. Sometimes, somethings just go into your mouth and melts. It was one of it. Then came Veg Noodles with Chilly Paneer. It was good. Quantity was so much that 3 people can have it well. We were even served Spring rolls with Meetha Chutney which was very good companion. And in desert, we were served Classic Monte-Carlo desert which taste delicious but unfortunately couldn't have much, winter makes people sick. Everything was perfect. Kudos To Chef!

With great location this place provides some of the best fusion dishes, beautifully decorated, the crowd of this place shows how much people love it. The staff is very nice, the ambiance and service is on point.
Coming to the food they are super delicious.
Mocktail - Kokum Rita (the tangy drink perfectly balanced definitely wakes up the foodie in you)
Starter -
1. Lymwn Samak - this lebanese fish perfectly cooked melts in your mouth and it's my favorite of all. One must definitely try.
2. Dajaj Charmoula - perfect to pick from your pot, juicy chicken perfectly chard for that smoky flavor
Main Course -
1. Moon Faan - the mixed fried rice
2. Hunan Fish
Dessert -
100% Jack Daniels Mousse - this was one of a kind dessert <3¬†

My overall experience was just amazing so it's recommended for all from my side if you are in Kolkata and want to try fusion food, this is where you should go.

If you are looking for a premium dine in this is the place for you. 
Firstly the mocktail Tangy mandarin and lemon grass shock, the presentation is good and it has a quite refreshing taste. 
The the starters were Tempura fish, lmywn samak and Dajaj charmoula. Fish is really soft and melted in the mouth, charmoula is the best its a must try superb taste with nice flavours and samak was equally good. 
For the main course Moon Faan and Hunan fish, both are nice and delicious. 
Finally the desert 100% jack daniels and Barry Callebaut is a must try its was really good.
This place has awesome ambience and the service is also good great expirience.

With the ideal location these places serves the best fusion food . A place well decorated and provides you the perfect ambience ..
When it comes to food the place will surprise you with its veg preparations . Should try kele k phool which will a rmtreat for your taste buds .
Chilly garlic noodles is a great option to try for ..
Chicken in masaman curry is a unique dish to try as it is a uncommon combination of coconut milk and lemon which gives u a tingy flavour and goes well with noodles..

For the desert must try classic monte carlo which is a good option to end your meal..

This is a delightful place located a few buildings away from Hazra Law College. The interiors are spacious and cozy at the same time. We had their pork ribs as starters. Two pieces of ribs cooked in barbecue sauce, they will have you asking for more. They do this weird thing where they stick a dropper filled with the sauce into each of the pieces. Although it looks rather funny, it does improve the taste. We also had a lamb starter, which was moderately spicy and pretty tasty. We had the shepherds pie in the main course and we were absolutely blown away. The lamb pieces were soft and cooked to perfection and the layer of mashed potato on the top only complimented the taste. Spicekraft mixes some amazing cocktails too. I would particularly recommend their Manhattan.

Location : Near hazra law college & ballygunge phari .  

When I entered in the resturent I was really satisfied with the eye soothing lighting & nice glass paintings . And there was a touch of sofisticasy in the whole atmosphere .  

Now come to food & drinks : first I took "Doodh cola " in drinks which one is a rare mixture of fresh cream + cold milk + thumbs up . And it was refreshing & unic in taste .

Next I choose Lymwn samak ( a arabic style lemon falvoured grilled fish ) & Shish taouk ( Chicken marinated in cream & zatar spices , grilled in slow flame ) . I really loved the Shish taouk - it was properly cooked , juicy , superbly flavoured & too good in taste . 

In main course I tried Mix fried rice , chicken hakka noodles & roast pork in rendang curry . And when I started eating the rice with the pork , I was so happy on my choice . Because it was delicious in this combo what I loved . 

Now it was the time to be a bengali , time for the desserts . Took the " Beyond fried ice-cream in kahlua & dark choclate ghanace " ( contains alcohol ) . It was a blust when I take the first scoop in my mouth . The outside coating was hot & the internal ice-cream was chilled and in both of these in a single spoon was the perfect combo of this memorable meal . 

* A must try food joint with superb range of drinks . Really awesome experience with Spice Kraft .

Well the ideal location a little cramped and crowded you are literally sitting on the table next to you. But food cannot complain. The beer batter fish fry and tandoori sausages were really good and innovative presentation. The Chinese main course was good nothing to rave about. But the dish that blew my mind was the butter paper fish paturi. It had a subtle taste but the taste lingers in your mouth. Like I said earlier the only drawback was the space and table location. Even after booking three days in advance we were put in a dark claustrophobic room with very little lighting not ideal for kids (good for office parties) and we had a boisterous crowd at our next table so we could do only hear their conversations. So the ambience was a dampener

I wanted to visit Spice Kraft for a really long time.. As I consider myself a big time foodie, this place is always hyped and one of those classy-fabulous places!!! I am so happy to say it lives up to its name!!
 Awesome place, good ambience, great food üòÅ and staff behaviour is very nice ..
Location is very easy, as it is located just opposite hazra law college in Ballygunge Phari..

‚Ä¢ For mocktail, I had the Aampanna and Curry Patta Shikhanji...Which had a spicy kick to it..Felt very refreshing though!! üòÅ

‚Ä¢ For starters, I had the Beer Can Tempura Fish..The fish was really fresh and smooth ..So much so, it melted in my mouth..
I also had the Fish- En- Papillote, which had a cheesy texture to it and was really smooth and delicious!!

‚Ä¢ For the maincourse, I had the mixed fried rice..
The Roast Pork in Rendang Curry, this had an amazing melting flavour to it..With a touch of coconut milk, it was almost creamy and had a spectacular somewhat spicy flavour.. üòÄ
The Chicken in Chilly Oyster and Mushroom had a tangy feel to it..It had the right amount of spice in it..It went just right with the mixed fried rice.. üôÇ

‚Ä¢ For dessert, I had the 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse with Drunken Petit Fours ü§§..This has become my absolute favourite as I have never had such a beautiful dessert ever before in my life..It was presented in such a simple yet elegant way!! Cheers üçª A must try for dessert lovers.. 

 All in all, every dish was amazing and worth a try..The decoration is spectacular, as I have mentioned before the staff behaviour is very welcoming.. üòä I recommend this place to all the food lovers out there..Be it a family outing, friends hanging out or a romantic date üòâ, this place is a must visit.. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Heard about this place for a long time...finally visited recently.The decor and ambience of the place is really good.
 Coming to food,we started with the mocktail Tangy mandarin with lemongrass schocker which was really very refreshing.
 For starters we ordered the much talked about dajaj chermoula and it just blew us away.Both the presentation and taste were on point. It was followed by fish-en-papillote -the fish was tender and the flavour was bang on. 
In main course we had nasi goreng and roast pork in rendang curry.Both the dishes were packed with flavours and went well together.
 Lastly we ordered the classic Monte Carlo which was just the cherry on the top. 
Overall it was a great experience and highly recommended for all the foodies out there.

Visited this place after going through a lot of rave reviews on Zomato . It is located near the Ballygunge Phari Bharat Petroleum Gas Station on Hazra Road . We had read that it is difficult to get a table here so we reached a bit early & infact we were the first to enter the restaurant & had no trouble getting a table. The exterior is not very appealing while the interior is small , dimly lit with music playing on the background. The seating arrangement mostly consists of two seater & four seater tables with well cushioned chairs .The staffs are polite & quite well versed with the menu & are able to explain them in detail . We ordered the following :
Baby Octopus Tandoori : This was for my 4 year old son who is fond of Octopuses . Being a child he is unable to handle much spicy food & we requested them to make it less spicy. The dish was still very spicy & as he was finding it difficult to eat we asked for some tomato sauce but instead of normal sauce they provided tomato chilly sauce much to our dismay. The dish consists of four baby Octopuses & onion slices . An average preparation .
Beer Can Tempura Fish : This is one of their signature dishes but the name is very deceptive. The beer can is associated with the decoration of the dish & not with adding something extra to the taste & flavour of the preparation & if indeed the beer added something then it's influence is minimal or negligible. It is a normal tempura fish ( a Japanese style of cooking ) with cabbages as salads. A good dish but nothing extraordinary.
Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab : Pork being my favourite I chose this preparation which was suggested by the waiter . When it arrived all of us were very much amused. They delivered a huge plate with nice decoration of Jalapeno & Imly drizzle & two not so big ( just bigger than being small ) Pork Ribs on one corner of the plate .The dish was too insufficient for even myself . The taste was again very average & ribs were a bit burnt for my liking.
Coq Au Vin : My wife had decided beforehand to try this famous french dish prepared with red wine ( preferably Red Burgundy Wine though highly expensive ). Again we were served a huge plate with chicken , mushrooms & some rice , the quantity being very little for a group & taste wise good but not great .
The management of Spice Kraft seems to be trying to create a fine dining experience for the people but the emphasis is more on the word " fine" rather than on "dining". The beautifully decorated dishes are a visual treat but lacks the wow factor when it comes to taste. Also the ingredients may be costly ( Jalapeno , Parsley etc are costly indeed ) but even then considering the price the quantity is very much insufficient .
Our experience at Spice Kraft hardly justifies the 4.7 rating on Zomato .

We also had two fish specials e.g Fish-en Papillote and Lymwn Samak and our favourite Devilled Crab meat. All the dishes were unique in taste.

‚Ä¢Beer can tempura fish with Orange ponzu tartare(dip) ~ the crisp beer batter outside and soft juicy fish inside with the dip made my mouth wowed..

‚Ä¢Dajaj Chermoula ~ Marinated chicken with charmoula spices which is charcoal grilled are treat to your taste buds..

‚Ä¢Shish Taouk ~ Chicken Marinated in cream & Zatar spice which is grilled on slow flame.. the best Chicken starter I had..

‚Ä¢Mixed Fried Rice ~ good amount of rice mixed with good amount of chicken egg and prawn..

‚Ä¢Chicken in chilly oyster & mushroom ~ well balance of flavour goes very good with the fried rice..

‚Ä¢100% Jake Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate mousse, Drunken Petit ~ Pure bliss in the mouth, perfectly made mousse and those small cakes goes very well..

Must try ~  The mocktai, Beer batter fish, Shish taouk and the 100% Jake Daniels mousse with those small cakes..

Starter:lymwn samak-its a really sassy lemoni grilled fish ...its taste enhances more when its dipped in the magical sauce provided with the grilled fish ...the fishy starter comes with a stick on it...this the alltime mouth smacking starter can be added with your favourite drink or classy coctails...
Coctail:Choco Beam- a smooth chocolaty drink with a punch of whisky served in a glass...which makes a perfect combo with the starter ...
Main course: Mixed fried rice- its my all time favourite chinese dish i order everywhere in main course ...an ampel amount of veggie,egg,chicken,prawn mixed in rice with a flavour n aroma of soya sauce is a perfect  stomack filling dish ...

A 10/10 for restaurant ambience, mind-blowing starters to dig upon.
1.Cucumber Cooler- refreshing mocktail...perfect balance of tanginess and sweetness
2.Bacardi and limon infused tandori chicken sausage-presentation had a twist with droppers placed over the sausages...one of the best starters tasted here
3.Fish in papillote-a version of Bengali styled paturi(according to my senses :p)succulent pieces of fish marinated in spices 
4.Chicken nasi goreng-generous amount of rice wid chicken pieces topped wid a poached egg and prawn papads to go wid it.a bit spicy to my palate.
5.Roast pork in rendang curry-awesome side to go wid rice or noodles...
6.classic Monte carlo-this restaurant is known for its awesome desserts and the classic Monte Carlo was no exception...smooth ice-cream with chocolate sauce...perfect way to end the meal.
Cost can be a bit high on the budget...but totally worth every penny spent.
P.s.-cudnt get a click fr the mocktail.

Sorry but I had to give this rating for spoiling dinner with family on my birthday....
We made a plan to come for dinner on 14th December evening, we called them for booking a table, however they did not pick up our call even after 3-4 try. So we decided to be there directly.
Once we reached there at 8:45 pm, we have been informed that we need to wait for at least one hour for getting a table for 9 members, since one family has just took the table few minutes before...
When we asked them the reason for not picking our phone call, they informed that they don't receive call if they have full house... Rediculous!!! Stupidity at its best... We left the place immediately...
Thank you once again for letting us down...

Well this place has exceptionally strong kudos from zomato family. Recently visited this. The place is on hazra road. The ambiance is fresh. I found the place a bit cumbersome though. The garnishing is good. Service is warm and crisp. Taste is great rather. The meal provides satiety, something i rarely find these days. The order comprised of, kele ke phool croque monsieur, shish taouk, narsi goreng n something on the sides, fried ice cream and monte carlo. it was a meal to remember. the experience though could be enhanced. The kokum rita drink was something new to me.

About the food, good experimental menu to choose from. Tried baked crab meat, Lebanese style char grilled chicken and pan fried fish chilly. Moving on to pineapple rice with fish balls and prawns with coriander sauce. Went best with house special smoked pineapple with gin cocktail and some chilled beer.
What I think this restaurant can improve on is the management. This is funny that they have three separate sitting zone for friends, family, couples and God knows what else. Worst is that all these sitting areas differ a lot in terms of ambience and comfort.
It took almost 45 minutes for the restaurant to manage the AC to a comfortable temperature (I was sweating and it is December).

SERVICE: It is a tad bit slow.
MENU: It offers food from round the world with a touch of molecular gastronomy. 
FOOD: The egg foo yong canapes with gratinated aged cheddar was good with the slightly granulated egg contrasting with cheese. The butter nun was good & was perfectly accompanied with the murg e Mukul. The coq au vin was great too with the creaminess of the sauce. Last but not the least the 100% Jack Daniels & berry Callebaut Swiss chocolate mousse with drunken petit fours was the cherry on the cake. The orangey taste with the slight bitter chocolate mousse was little bites of heaven.

Awsome experience visiting spicekraft. Lovely ambienc and decor with one of the best foods in Kolkata.
We had 2 cocktails- kool cucumber and litchitini which are great.
Then for starters and mains, beer can tempura fish, dajaj charmoula, nasi goreng and hunan fish.
Staffs recommend well and all dishes meet the hype and expectation. It has become a must visit.

Was planning a family lunch here for a long time as I have heard from my friends that it's an excellent place to visit..  Not at all disappointed..food was excellent.. For starters tempura fish was very good.. Perfectly cooked.. Drums of heaven could have been better with a sour dip rather than a sweet one.. Devil crabs were excellent.. Baby octopuses were good too.. For main course rice and noodles were good..pork in rednang curry was spot on.. Southern flavours were oozing out.. Chicken in oysters and mushrooms was no less.. And then atlast the dessert too left us fully satisfied...fried ice cream.. The plating for all the dishes were absolutely beautiful.. I would love to recommend this to all my food loving friends..

I would definitely give a rating of 5 and if I don't I'll be the looser . The restaurant was in my bookmarks for a long time and I wanted to visit this place very bad . My best friend made it happen by giving her birthday treat . The place was awesome with it's cosy feel , a lively ambience was maintained , the management was very good as we've visited on a busy Saturday . Inspite of that we got our table after a wait of 5-10 minutes which was bearable The place was totally worth it with it's good quality and variety of dishes along with it's friendly staffs . We were 6 in number out of which one was vegetarian . We ordered 3 starters which included Beer can tempura fish - the fish was fresh and very smooth since it melted in our mouth just after we had it ; Stir fried squid rings - the squid wasn't chewy and tasted equally good with it spiced up flavours since we made it a bit hot considering the weather that was chilled ; Murgh Kothmari kabab - the chicken was subtle and wasn't chewy either inspire of being exposed for a long time for getting clicked first :D . We've ordered a very started having potatoes fried very nicely and I don't remember the name unfortunately . As we're true Chinese eating Bengalis , we had to order Mixed fried rice for our main course so that we could get a taste after trying out a bit different starters . Rice was accompanied with Mandarin fish with chicken and Chicken with oyster and mushroom . They were good however I found it a bit salty which could only be avoided when had with rice .
The desserts were lost as we were full like pigs and couldn't have more . Overall the experience was amazing and it is truly the high rated restaurant in my city - worth the title . Though next time looking forward to try the boozerts and the remaining signature dishes . Last but not the least - a big thank you to the management for keeping you the good work and also for encouraging it's customers to hope for more array of dishes .

I spent almost a year drooling over the endless photos of Spice Kraft and reading through the countless reviews.And finally I had the chance to visit this grandeur restaurant recently.Before I go off on a tangent about how amazing the food is,I must mention the head chef surely knows how to blend the cuisines with the magic of art.So,I started with this refreshing mocktail named Rainbow.It definitely tasted good and tempting too.Then comes the beer can tempura fish.It was so tender inside with perfect coatings.Followed by it I opted for Chicken Stroganoff.I was highly satisfied with it's taste.Lastly,I ordered the much hyped boozert Beyond Fried Ice Cream.I guess this is one of the best things I have ever tasted.So very much toothsome.The boozert gave a happy ending to my dinning experience over this place.Spice Kraft is a place of great value for the price.The ambience was pretty perfect with a classic decor.Service was so apt.The food was absolutely wonderful,from preparation to presentation,very pleasing.I would love to come over here again.

Located within the hearts of Ballygunge,this place is like a fair or ground for variation. Spicekraft is currently one of the finest restaurants in this city whose luxurious ambience and amazing food has it's aroma being spread far and wide in the city. They have dishes like Beer battered tempura fish and dishes of chicken dipped in jack daniels sauce or rum. What is most likeable about this restaurant is their ability to experiment with different food items. The inclusion of alcohol to make the dishes unique and to make the quality of the food stand out is sheer brilliance. You've not tasted Kolkata's food beauty if you've not stepped inside this amazing place.

Spicekraft,has always been a super hyped joint and thankfully it didn't disappoint me at all.I have visited this place few months ago with one of my friend and I must say it was an awesome experience.Starting from the decor to the dishes each and every item had a unique personality.The menu consist of signature dishes of various regions in India which is quite fancy.The staffs were decent and courteous,quite knowledgeable about the dishes they were serving.
Coming to the food I have tried the recommended dishes along with few of my choices.Food was really good and i must mention the presentation of each dish were excellent.The best of all were Dajaj Charmoula and Beer can tempura fish.To know more about the dishes you can follow me on Instagram@gastrofotonomia_foodie.And lastly I must say the place is worth the hype worth the hype.Go visit if you haven't already.

Do Try the painkiller. 
The desserts were also nice but could notch down a bit on the alcoholic ratio of the Jack Daniels one... 
Rest overall no doubt a 5 star experience...  From the ambience to the food to the service...

You'll find various kinds of Continental , Asian, Middle Eastern food here. They also have a separate bar menu. No doubt, this place has got a lot to offer. The food, the staff, the service, ambience everything was top notchüëåüèª. The food is quite uncommon in terms of taste and you'll get a wide variety of dishes to choose from. Also, the way they present the dishes needs a mention for sure‚ù£. They surely serves some exclusive gastronomic delights in town!
It has got a pretty, decent and calm ambience, nicely decorated along with a lot of space and comfortable seatingüëçüèª.
What all we had? 
‚Ä¢For drinksüçπwe ordered Blue Frappe, 
-The Mango Driver which was refreshing ripened mango juice combined with vodka
-Doodh Cola ‚ù§Ô∏è
Coming on to the startersüçñ, we had the signature dish of this place -Dajaj Chermoula which had chicken  marinated with Chermoula spices & char grilled. (üåüMust Try) and,
-Kele- ke- phool ke croque monsieur again a unique dish and great in tasteüëåüèª.
‚Ä¢For the Main CourseüçΩ we had
-Beer Can Tempura Fish (again a must tryüåü) and,

At last, to put a sweet end to an amazing lunch, we ordered for the
‚Ä¢Dessertsüçß where we had The Classic Monte Carloüòç which surely gave a perfect end to the amazing food we had at Spice Kraft‚ù§Ô∏è.
Overall, it was a really good experience for me to try out such amazing varieties of fusion food and I'm sure you guys don't wanna miss them out. So, go and checkout this place if you haven't alreadyüòÄ.

This place had been on my bucket list for quite some time and finally went there yesterday for lunch with two of my friends. It offers the best Continental, Asian and Middle Eastern food. The interior is nicely decorated and has a cozy and luxurious ambiance.

We ordered:
1. The Mango Driver- it had the perfect blend of ripened mango juice and vodka.
2. Beer Can Tempura Fish served with orange ponzu tartare dip- they were crispy on the outside with soft and juicy fish inside.
3. Grilled Fish with lemon butter sauce- fresh bhetki fillets prepared with lemon butter sauce and served with buttered rice, mushroom, and veggies.
4. Beyond Fried Ice cream- it had a crispy coating on the outside and ice cream inside, a must try dessert.

All the dishes were delicious. Pocket pinch is moderate. Staff is very friendly and courteous, prompt service. We even had a small conversation with the Chef of this place. Highly recommended. Will definitely be coming back here again.

Visited there recently for lunch on a saturday afternoon.The interiors were quite good and I loved it. Coming to the food part, for starters we ordered Soy braised drums of heaven Old Monk Flamb√© and Beer can tempura fish.
The Soy braised drums of heaven were very delicious both to look at and in taste. Everything was perfect, they were soft and the flavours were on point.
The beer can tempura fish looked very appealing and it was also extremely tasty.
I also took Kokum Rita which had in it a chatpata flavour that was very good. It was also sweet and thus went well with the food.
Coming to the main course we took mixed fried rice which again was very tasty and contained everything in good amounts and hot garlic fish. This dish was a bit spicy for me but it went good along with the rice. The pieces of fish were quite big and the quantity of food is enough. 
Next we took 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss mouss√® which has become my favourite because of its great looks and taste. It tasted like perfection and I loved everything about it. 
Will be eager to visit again.

I visited the place with my friends at around 2 in the afternoon and we found tables pretty quickly. 
The staff is polite and courteous and the service was very nice.
We order the Beer Can Tempura fish, Soy Brased drumsticks of heaven and the Kokum Rita mocktail.
We were not disappointed with food at all. The fish was soft and the dips served with it we're really good as well. The chicken drumsticks were spicy and was my favourite. Finally for dessert we ordered the 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut. I was pleasantly surprised by it and it did not disappoint one bit.
It lived up to it's rating. 
Would recommend to everyone.

Was looking to try this restaurant since long but it only happened last night. Spice Kraft by chef Sambit Banik is highly rated by most reviewers....hence the expectations were pretty high. First impression of the exterior amd interior was not encouraging at all. The exterior is pretty shabby. The interiors are average with a cramped dining area buzzing with after office drink binge groups as well as more than required service staff. We ordered some mocktails and crispy chilly baby corn with coriander and green chillies...kele ke phool ke croque monsieur....khoai tay. The second dish was rechristened mochar cutlet with some baked pineapple topping and tangy ginger dip. Khoai tay was a sweet n tangy potato dish with Vietnamese origin. The starters were decent but only modified versions of normal dishes. The main course of dal makhni....paneer in white gravy and teekha banarsi aloo dum with breads and rice was ordinary. The portion size is small for 4 diners. The service is laid back and repeat items take ages to be served. Beverage pricing is aggressive to attract the regular clients. Overall....may try it but be prepares to sit in a small area. Internet images are decieving.

In one word. Disappointing.
Food. We ordered mushroom duxelles on bread. Very sweet. Who wants a sweet mushroom appetizer. Unappetizing. 5 tiny crostini served on a huge platter.
Aglio olio spaghetti. Sticky. Again unappetizing. Not even seasoned well. 
Jack Daniel's mousse. 2 quenelles of mousse, some orange jelly, 4 circles of some sort of a cake.the mousse was like an ordinary milk chocolate mousse. No residual whiskey flavor at all. The cake slices, they should just skip them. It is like dry sliced packeted fruit cake. The orange jelly adds nothing to the dish. They could've just named it chocolate mousse and served up a more generous amount.

Ambience. Good. The music is a bit 80s, volume could be lower. 
Service. Good. Too many waiters lingering doesn't feel comfortable though.
Also. Weirdly shaped silverware isn't cool. Heart shaped spoons for dessert. That don't actually function very well as spoons.

GEM OF A PLACE!
If you are pondering whether to try this plAce over other trending dine-ins of the city, give this a try.
You would definitely love everything about this place.

Situated a few meters away from Hazra Law College.
Went there on a special lunch - date.
Ambience is excellent, they play soothing music, waiters were too courteous. Interior furnishing is upto the mark

Food- 
1. Classic Shepherd's Pie- minced lamb (crusted with cheesy-potato mash) served with Garlic Bread.
Thin crust, cheese loaded. Minced, tender, juicy lamb stuffed inside. Definitely give a try this, if you are here.

2. Dajaj Chermoula- served with curd dip. Quite similar to tangri kebab. Char grilled.

3. Pan fried Cantonese Noodles- loaded with all veggies ( exotic too), shrimps, chicken and egg.
Gravy was superbly done. Appropriately Al dente.

Drinks-
Terminator- their house special cocktail.
(You won't find it on their menu.) Beer cocktail with sweet and sour tinge. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Jamun Mary- Jamun syrup+ spices+ alcohol.
Average.

Waiters were highly courteous. They help you rightly with the menu. A five star for the service too.
Foods were served without much delay.
HIGHLY Satisfied ‚úå

This place was on my wish list for a long time and this week I got a chance to visit
The ambience was just perfect
They serve a variety of drinks and cocktails
They also have a huge variation of Continental food
For starter we had theirclassic cocktail Margarita, Orange juice and Beer Can Tempura fish a famous delicacy of Spicekraft
For lunch we had Lucknowi Dum Biriyani, Lucknowi Chicken (I don't remember the name of the dish exactly) and Tandoori rooti
For dessert we had Classic Monte Carlo which was just superb
The waiters were also well behaved and explained the menu well
They just took too long to serve the order which I think is there only drawback
But it was a great experience overall
Would love to visit again
Highly recommended !!

Tired of the same old typical chinese, continental and Indian dishes? Spice Kraft is just the answer to this. This place serves every dish with a touch of uniqueness. The service is prompt and very efficient. Though the place is not a very huge one, but the cosy and plush decor makes up for that. Nice place to visit with your small group of friends. Definitely deserves a second visit.

This place never disappoints me..  Whenever I visit this place, every time it surprises me either in a form of good food or with their friendly and kind behaviour. My first visit was on 15th September.  I still remember the date because that way my fiances' birthday.  I asked them to book a table for me at 2p.m.  but we were 10mins late so without notifying us they gave the table to another guest.  So we had to wait for another 20mins. Then we were given a slot. Small decorated area. I brought a cake for him and asked the attendee to serve it later. So they did so.  And in the end when we asked them for bill they brought a dessert as a birthday compliment  which surprised us a lot...
Food was so tasty..  Beer can tempura fish and baked fish Wellington is a must try..  Overwhelmed with their behaviour and spice kraft just made our day..

Visited this restaurant on a Saturday evening. We came sharp at 6.00pm so had no problem with seats. The staffs are helpful and courteous and the ambience as well as decor is also good. We (a group of 5) ordered suon nuong, khorkhog, bacardi infused chicken sausages and a wrapped fish dish as starters and shepherd's pie, nasi goreng, khao pad sapparod, hunan fish and roasted pork in rendang curry as main course. The food was good but I must say that if anyone have tasted the foods earlier they will be disappointed. The Khorkhog is actually a Mongolian dish in which lamb is cooked with hot stones and served along with boiled potatoes ,carrots,onions etc and resembles a stew in texture . However the "Khorkhog" they serve here is shredded lamb in a black bean/hoisin based sauce. Definitely the dish they serve is tasty but it isn't khorkhog. May be they improvised the dish to match Indian taste bud because the original Khorkhog is a bit bland in taste.Similarly nasi goreng, the Indonesian national dish is characterized by the presence of prawns. No matter whether they are from road side stalls or a Michelin star restaurant, they must contain prawns. But I was disappointed seeing shrimps in my nasi goreng. Although it still tasted good but nasi gorengs are not complete without prawns. The waiter suggested hunan fish with my nasi goreng which I rejected (although my friend went with the idea) because I am a bit conservative regarding my food and the idea of matching an Indonesian dish with a Hunan Chinese dish appalls me. All in all, its a nice place. The food is good but don't carry a presumption seeing the names and finding them familiar. The staffs are helpful and co-operative but do apply your common sense while listening to their suggestions. There is ample parking space and the place is easy to locate. A 4 outta 5.

Awesome experience. I have been waiting for so long to go to this place with my best friend. Finally we made it today. Ambience was very nice, staff were very attentive and professional. They helped us to choose the right dishes as well. Now coming to the orders. We ordered dajaj charmoul chicken and tempura fish as starters. Then hari moti pulao and laal maash as the main course. And finally 100% jack daniels desert. Oh..I am still in love with them. Will visit them again to try other dishes. Thank you Spice Kraft.

This is in my list of kolkata‚Äôs favourite restaurant. I searched in zomato and suggested my cousins we should go here. And it was worth it. Loved the food. We ordered pasta in white dauce and it was rich and creamy. The crackling chicken was a new thing we hd. Shepard‚Äôs pie was just out of this world. Ask them to srtve their signature mocktail and you will be suprised by the amazing tastr and to end it. The desserts wete equally nice.

This was our first visit with a lot of expectations and that too on a very special day - Mom Dad's wedding anniversary dinner. It had to be super special.

Located bear to the Hazra Law College , the awesome ambience immediately captured our eyes. 

Now coming to the food .The following delicacies were ordered:
Starters:
Dajaj Charmoula - Deliciously yummy Lebanese Chicken dish.
Beer Can Tempura Fish - The show-stealer.Heavenly taste.
Green Chilli Chicken - Very very tasty.
Soya Brewsed Drums of Heaven - Very good.

Mocktail / Cocktail:
Blue Electric and Blue Frappe - Great.

Main Course :
Butter Nan - Super soft.
Nawabi Dum Ka Murg - Lovely .

We did not have space to accommodate the much talked about Jack Daniels Mousse this time round.

I have just few words to describe the experience on behalf of my entire family : 
Delightful,Yummy,Wonderful,Rocking.
Super loved all of them..Special thumbs up for the presentation and helpful folks who would always suggest the best stuff for you.
We were just overwhelmed :-) :-)

For me - This is one of the very best in Kolkata in terms of Concept Food,Presentation and Behaviour of the entire team. Highly Recommend Spice Kraft.

Keep up the great taste - Guys..Will keep visiting coz there are loads if delicacies to be consumed :-) :-)

Anything less than 5 in this restaurant should be unfair. Well we went there be seeing the highest zomato rating among all restaurants in kolkata & boy how amazing it is. First f all ambience is superb, sober as well as stylish. Service is prompt & they repeatedly advice u regarding ideal combination of food. For starter we ordered beer can tempura fish,  it was so uniquely served so that u get mesmerised at the first go. It was very tasty & soft as well. For main course we went for Nasi Goreng,  Indonesian main staple food along with Hunan chicken.  An ideal combination of spicy & non - spicy dish, satisfied every taste buds. Amount was so large so that we can't accommodate any desserts in our stomach. All in all highly recommended for all.

Spice Kraft is one such restaurant who serves some exotic never seen or never heard excellent food items. I had a complete 4 course meal there, and was completely blown away by their tastes. For starter I had the famous Beer Can Tempura Fish. It comes in a Budweiser beer can, accompanied by a tasty whitish dip. The fish was so soft and perfectly cooked. The coating was tasty and not lumpy or thick. For drinks I had the lovely, refreshing Red Grape and Basil Twister. In main course, the Baked fish Wellington was absolutely sumptuous and yummy. The creamy texture and the tendered cook fish was awesome. The rice was tasty too. Last but not the least, the beautiful lunch experience was brought to an end by an excellent dessert called, Beyond Fried Ice Cream. Its taste is really beyond praises. The dessert was absolutely lip-smacking and innovative.
The service was good. The restaurant is well-decorated with some cool lights.

Located within a stone throw's distance from Ballygunge Phari, this restuarant is quite a show in the food world. Spacious and great ambiance. The staff was courteous and food was served without delay.

Coming back to food.

1.Cucumber cooler: A refreshing start. Looks good and tastes great.

2.Dajaj Chermoula: Every restuarant has dishes it is proud of. This mind-blowing Lebanese dish is a must try here. The chicken was extremely juicy and tender.

3.Sish Taouk: Lebanon delicacy, chicken marinated in cream and Zara spice, the flavours go really good together. Worth tasting.

4. Coq-Au-Vin : The taste of roasted chicken in red wine perfectly compliments the buttery taste of Parsley rice. The taste buds are here in for a complete surprise.

5. Shepherd's pie: A lamb dish which is cooked to perfection. The cream mashed potato literally melts in mouth.

6. Lymwn Samak: My favourite Lebanon delicacy here. Never had a grilled fish this good. Want to fall in love with fish? Try this.

7. 100% Jack Daniel's & Barry Callebaut Swiss chocolate mousse: This is the match winner. Absolutely thrilled to taste the mousse. Do not ever walk out without trying this dessert!

Being a huge lover of Lebanese food, I loved the flavours they serve here.
Definitely going back for more food next time. üòç

The mocktails & deserts  was good - I would like to specially recommend  Beyond fried ice cream and tangy mandarin & lemon grass schock. We would surely like to visit again.

One of the best restaurant in kolkata I have ever tasted. Have huge range of menu, and the staffs really help to choose the best ones. The ambience is very good, decor is sophisticated. Located near Hazra Law college which is very easy to find out. I ordered Ampanna & Curry Patta Shikhanji, Baked Fish Wellington, Shepherds Pie and Classic Monte Carlo.
Each and every dish was lipsmacking. The mocktail was refreshing to start with a tangy favour of Ampanna and aroma of Carry Patta. Baked Fish Wellington tasted out of the world.... now coming to the Shepherds Pie, with a top layer of cheese and shredded lamb underneath it was amazing to give pleasures to your tastebuds. As a dessert the Classic Monte Carlo was a eyedrooling and lipsmacking finisher.. service is quick and staffs are well-behaved. shall surely visit again and again and recommend my friends too

The 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse here is a MUST TRY! Starting the review with desserts might seem weird, but this sure will be one of the best you've had!
We tried the Virgin mojito and the waiter suggested we try the cucumber cooler, which tasted refreshing and tangy! The alcohol too is reasonably priced here.
For starters, we ordered Dajaj Chermoula and Beer Can Tempura fish. Both of these tasted great, but the dips alongside were a little too sweet!
Our main course consisted of Moon Faan, Nasi Goreng, Haka noodles with Shredded Lamb in Masaman curry and chicken in chili oyster and mushroom on the side. The lamb was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious. The Nasi Goreng and Chicken were probably my favourites though!
However, the desserts stole the show. The Mousse looked and tasted PERFECT! We also had the Beyond fried ice cream which along with Mousse is the reason for a 5/5 for Spice Kraft.
The staff are also very very courteous and helpful! üòä
P.S. the ambience of the place deserves special mention too! Absolutely loved it! ‚ô•

This place is talk of town for rightful reasons.Located just few hundred meter away from bullygunj phari towards hazra road.You might have to wait for few minutes to get a seat inside as spice Kraft is high in demand.Ambience here is decent someone may found light is a issue here.
Service-staffs are generous & polite.Service time is also moderate.
Now lets talk about the main character the food.Every dish here is unique & treat to tastebuds.
Beer Can tempura fish-this signature dish of spice Kraft is trademark & a must a try.
Dajaj chermoula-a juicy chicken recipe with equally palatable dip
Cucumber cooler-this one looks less appealing but it is so refreshing & a must try
Lymnm samak-it a arabic style lemon flavoured grilled fish & this one is absolutely lip smacking
Jack daniel callebaut-this signature dessert has a unique taste
Definitely recommend from my side.

This is a late post but I wanted to share my experience anyway. The restaurant was almost which is good and also bad coz everyone badly wanted have food here like us but the due to so many service can be a bit slow. But actually they tried to maintain their pace according to crowd. It was during puja & the restaurants which take a break in the middle like closing at 4pm and opening again at 6.30pm undoubtedly maintain there quality even during that rush. It was supposed to open at 6.30 although they opened a bit late and there was a big queue outside the entrance. I thought that they might already be prepared for serving the crowd but then they said it will take some time to serve food. But then no one walked out hearing that such is there reputation and seriously they are at top in zomato ratings.
Coming to our order, in starters we went for Tempura fish which I liked more than than reshmi kebabs which didn't tasted extraordinary.
For main course we ordered,
Moon Fan - Very light, not very spicy and you will need a gravy with it. The fragrance was really nice.
Fried Rice - Like normal fried rice.
Roast pork in Rendang Curry - The star dish. Everyone of us liked it. From the smell of basil leaves to a bit light and lime taste to the small well cooked pork pieces, everything was loved.
Chicken Chilly - I didn't remember the exact name. I didn't liked the dish as it tasted like normal chilly chicken you find everywhere and also I don't get attracted to chicken if it's not something out of the box.
P.S - I suggest to order something different which are not found everywhere as they tasted really good and ask staffs to give suggestions(they know their food).

This restaurant is undoubtedly the best in Kolkata according to my experience. The ambience is very warm and welcoming. The staff were friendly and helpful and their recommendations were very useful.
From their menu you will get to know that they serve a diverse range of food covering all the main cuisines.
For drinks we had the classic VIRGIN MOHITO. It was a mix of sprite, lemon and mint. It was very refreshing and it balances the sweet with the sour perfectly.
For starters we took the BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH. Unlike other restaurants they do it with pure Bhetki, while the others do it with Basa. This dish is highly recommended and when you eat it you will get to know why. Everyone going to this place has to try this dish.
For the mains we had NASI GORENG with HUNAN CHICKEN. This was adviced by the waiter and thank God we listened to him. Nasi Goreng is a rice based dish. It was a bit spicy and was packed with flavours, served with prawn crackers and a poached egg. The Hunan Chicken was just a white gravy based preparation. The chicken was soft and succulent and had a slight smoky flavour which just made it perfect. The two complemented each other well.
Finally for desserts I had their FRIED ICECREAM. This is an alcoholic based desert and was just wonderful in taste. The icecream was coated and fried and was served with a hot chocolate and coffee cake and was placed along side a chocolate ganache. This was just heavenly and definitely highly recommended.
Our bill came to just 1134. Pretty reasonable.
I'm so glad I finally got to tick this off from my bucket list and the wait was definitely worth it. Thank you Spice Kraft for the amazing experience.

Located just a few steps off the Ballygunge Phari crossing, Spice Kraft is the easiest place to spot as one moves towards Hazra. The best thing about the location is that ample parking space is available, that too without too much hastle.¬†
Now, coming to the important part, the food.¬†
What we ordered :¬†
Main Course :¬†
1.¬† Beer Can tempura fish(5/5) : The ultimate starter to get one started with the feast. Deep fried with a justifiable amount of oil, this melts inside your mouth, producing a rollicking delight of fried fish.¬†
2. Dajaj Charmoula(4.5/5) : Served in little bowls, these pieces of grilled chicken are best had with drinks. Absolutely wonderful.¬†
Drinks :¬†
1. Tangarita(4.5/5)¬†
2. Cucumber Cooler(5/5) : Although less appealing in looks than the Tangarita, the cucumber cooler is prepared delightfully well and produces a satisfying effect as one takes a sip.¬†

Main Course :¬†
1. Chicken Stroganoff (5/5) : Served with little dollops of chicken, the Stroganoff is just as appealing to have as it sounds.¬†
¬†2. Shepherd's Pie(5/5) : A preparation in Lamb which is pretty unique, and absolutely wonderful at that.¬†

Desserts :¬†
1. Jack Daniel's Callebaut : A dessert prepared with the quintessential American whisky, which, I'd say is a standalone match winner and justifies why this place is consistently rated so high.¬†

A special mention to the service and hospitality of this place. The staff were very attentive and we didn't have to wait too long for the food.

Toh I visited this wonderful place with a gang of pretty cool people.
Let's start with the stars of the evening üòç
TANGARITA : What should I say, it was just the balanced combination of taste and beauty. The tanginess was perfect. It hardly interrupted with the flavours of other dishes we had. I could enjoy it throughout.

BEER CAN TAMPURA FISH : It's the '' you just can't miss it" dish. Well plated and fried to perfection. It was crunchy on outside and very soft fish inside. Quality of fish was appreciable.

SHEPARD'S PIE : I love lamb so it was a win win for me. The meat was tender and juicy. I enjoyed the spices used which enhanced the dish's flavor to a higher level.

100% JACK DANIELE'S BARRY CALLEBAUT : This dessert was the show stealer for me. It was so smooth with the flavor of JD. This is the one more please dishüòõ. I will have it again on my next visit.

Overall it was celebration of flavors and good quality food.

Went in for nabami dinner with a friend. The place may be little difficult to locate so you might want to Uber it there. The interiors here are really pleasing and it is perfect for dinner dates. Since we went during the pujas, they were not serving from the original menu, instead we had to choose from a menu specially set for the pujas, however they offered the full bar menu. We ordered

1. Hazelnut haeven with Absolut vodka. It had crushed hazelnuts with vanilla ice cream and vodka and was a total head turner.


2. Dajaj Chermoula as the starter. The chicken was tender and well marinated and was served with a sweet white sauce nicely complementing the dish. A 10/10 for this dish.

3. Moon fan for the main course and roast pork in Rendang curry to go with it. The Rendang curry was creamy and had a subtle hint of lemon leaves. Moon fan also had the aroma of lemon leaves. I liked the taste of both. The only problem is, the quantity of both was too less for being served in the main course. 

And to our disappointment they weren't serving any dessert during the pujas :/

Our bill was around 1400 AI.
Hoping to go back soon to try other dishes from the extended menu :)

We went there last night for only drinks and desserts (ordered a starter too, though :P)
The Peach Bellinis were amazing although I expected Champagne but it was Sparkling wine instead.
The Mushroom starter that we had was just the right about of creamy and cheesy.
However, hands down the best item was the Deep Fried Ice Cream with Kahlua and Chocolate Ganache.

The only thing unbecoming was the rudeness of the restaurant staff. That alone reduces my rating.

Well, what can be said about this restaurant ? 
It‚Äôs presently one of the best in town with a huge array of scrumptious food and lip smacking deserts. The drinks menu is to die for ! Located at a stone‚Äôs throw from Hazra Law College, this Global Cuisine restaurant is a must try for all !
I tried the Terminator and the Cucumber Cooler. The former was alcoholic and a must for all the  beer lovers. The latter is a refreshing and fresh non alcoholic drink, perfect for a nice meal.
For starters, the Dajaj Charmoula, which is a chicken dish, was the highlight ! It was the epitome of perfection. Also the Lymwn Samak was the perfect fish starter.
For main course the Nasi Goreng with the Hunan Fish was a standout !
And coming to the highlight of my meal, the deserts.
The Beyond Fried Ice Cream was one of the tastiest deserts I‚Äôve ever had.
And for the people who love a alcoholic zing in their deserts, the 100% Jack Daniels Barry Callebaut Chocolate Mousse is perfect.

This place is a must try ! Enjoy

My rating is solely for their well balanced Indian food. We had also ordered Shepherd's Pie which tasted like it should not have been on the menu.

Wanted to visit this place so long and finally got a chance to go there.Love the ambiance.Interior is simple though it's gives a lavish look.Coming to food,With high expectation we started with 
1.Dajaj Chermoula :- It's a chicken lebeneese item.chicken was really tender and there was a smokey flavour to it.A must try item if u go there.
2.Bacardi Limon infused chicken sausages :-This is your regular chicken sausage but served with a unique style.
In the main course we ordered
1.Hakka Noodles :-This is simple Hakka noodles made with perfection and goes well with our chicken dish.
2.Chicken In Chilly Oyster & Mushrooms :-Tastes awesome.But we asked for some spicy chicken dish.And it was not that spicy.
3.Baked Fish Wellington :- A continental lover must try this.This was a show stealer according to me.Fish baked in cheese.fish is so soft just melt in mouth.And a portion of butter rice with veggies and mushroom served with it.
Price is affordable.And now it is only 5% GST..Overall a nice experience.And Yes, Spice Kraft You deserve such a high rating.I would recommend this place to each and every foodie..

‚ÄúSpice Kraft‚Äù a Global Cuisine restaurant, hardly 3-4 mins of walking distance from Ballygunge Phari Bharat Petrol pump and less than a minute by car is easily locatable on the Hazra road. The restaurant with its attractive fa√ßade allures passersby to explore their attractive ambience and exotic cuisine.¬†¬†
Had visited this place for dinner. We had ordered for

1.	Lymwn Samak: One of the most recommended dish of the restaurant. Lymwn Samak is an Arabic style lemon flavored grilled fish. The dish was absolutely lip smacking and kept me yearning for more. 

2.	Prawn in fragrant coriander sauce:  Excellent quality prawn with flavours of coriander, was a pure gastronomic delight. 

3.	Grilled Fish with lemon butter sauce: Bhetki fish grilled perfectly and served with lemon butter rice.  This was a fine enticing experience for our taste buds.

As a foodie, I visited quite a lot of restaurants in Kolkata, yet Spice Kraft is one of the most preferred restaurants in the city. The food did not fail to deliver in both quantity as well as its quality.

All in all, it was a disappointing evening

Wanted to visit this place so long and finally got a chance to go there.Love the ambiance.Interior is simple though it's gives a lavish look.Coming to food,With high expectation we started with 
1.Dajaj Chermoula :- It's a chicken lebeneese item.chicken was really tender and there was a smokey flavour to it.A must try item if u go there.
2.Bacardi Limon infused chicken sausages :-This is your regular chicken sausage but served with a unique style.
In the main course we ordered
1.Hakka Noodles :-This is simple Hakka noodles made with perfection and goes well with our chicken dish.
2.Chicken In Chilly Oyster & Mushrooms :-Tastes awesome.But we asked for some spicy chicken dish.And it was not that spicy.
3.Baked Fish Wellington :- A continental lover must try this.This was a show stealer according to me.Fish baked in cheese.fish is so soft just melt in mouth.And a portion of butter rice with veggies and mushroom served with it.
Price is affordable.And now it is only 5% GST..Overall a nice experience.And Yes, Spice Kraft You deserve such a high rating.I would recommend this place to each and every foodie..

‚ÄúSpice Kraft‚Äù a Global Cuisine restaurant, hardly 3-4 mins of walking distance from Ballygunge Phari Bharat Petrol pump and less than a minute by car is easily locatable on the Hazra road. The restaurant with its attractive fa√ßade allures passersby to explore their attractive ambience and exotic cuisine.¬†¬†
Had visited this place for dinner. We had ordered for

1.	Lymwn Samak: One of the most recommended dish of the restaurant. Lymwn Samak is an Arabic style lemon flavored grilled fish. The dish was absolutely lip smacking and kept me yearning for more. 

2.	Prawn in fragrant coriander sauce:  Excellent quality prawn with flavours of coriander, was a pure gastronomic delight. 

3.	Grilled Fish with lemon butter sauce: Bhetki fish grilled perfectly and served with lemon butter rice.  This was a fine enticing experience for our taste buds.

As a foodie, I visited quite a lot of restaurants in Kolkata, yet Spice Kraft is one of the most preferred restaurants in the city. The food did not fail to deliver in both quantity as well as its quality.

This restuarant located in Ballygunge is one of the best places in Kolkata to have a meal with your loved one, friends and family. 

Ambience: 4.5/5
The ambience of this place is very nice with ample amount of seating space. The furniture and the crockery is also good compared to other restaurants in Kolkata.

Service: 4.5/5
The service was amazing. The waitors were well dressed. From being courteous to helping you with anything related to food, they‚Äôre the best.

Food: 4.5/5
‚Ä¢Subz ki Galawat: This starter that we ordered was simply amazing. 
‚Ä¢Nawabi Dum ki Paneer: This dish was good but not that spicy. So after our request they prepared it again according to our requirement.
‚Ä¢Breads: we ordered tandoori roti and nan. I‚Äôll suggest yoy go with nan as it was simply amazing.

Definitely recommended from my side. You should definitely go here with friends and family.

Well, I don't know why and how, I didn't even write a review of my favourite restaurant in Kolkata, and you can count this as a sin. I love Spice Kraft, I just love it. Every time I visit Kolkata, it is a must go in my list, and believe me, I have never regretted ordering any dish blindly. Because I know, they cannot be bad, they just cannot. And oh, did I forget to mention the greatest cocktails in the town? Well, one must try them here. And last, but not the least, the dish I'm adding photo of IS THE BEST FISH FRY I EVER HAD. Spice Kraft should be in your bucket list when you are in kolkata and you must not miss this BEER CAN TAMPOORA FISH.

If a meal makes you want to visit a city again.. then you can just imagine how fabulous every bite was. 
Mere words on the menu do not do justice to the love you feel with every bite. The molecular mocktails and raving reviews is what drove us here. Vimal (the manager) was kind enough to arrange for the deconstructed papdi chaat despite the paucity in some basic ingredients .. and boy were we grateful for the explosion of flavour and the ingenuity of the process!!
Other items we had:
- subz ki galawat: the kebab just melts in your mouth and the melange of vegetables is perfect. The chutney has a hint of mustard and hits the right spot combined with the kebab. Aces!!
- Kele ke phool ke croque monsieur: surely a signature dish. The combination of cheese, pineapple the mildly spiced and light croque coupled with the dip made for a delightful combination. The dip leaves a tingling taste with a hint of green chillies. 
- Fried ice cream: our first try of fried ice cream and we were mighty pleased. 
Good luck for all their future endeavours and hopefully they expand to Bombay soon.

This place has been in my bucket list for a long time, n finally I paid a visit to this place.. Firstly the interior is beautiful, the ambience is perfect.. Staffs are courteous ..now coming to the food, we ordered 
1. Bacardi Limon infused tandoori chicken sausages-the concept is quite unique and it tasted superb also
2. Now coming to the main course we ordered Tandoori Roti and Nawabi Dum ki Paneer- a simple tandoori roti served in a beautiful basket will definitely pull up ur urge more to dig into the food.. N the paneer tasted awesome, it was so soft and tender.. Loved it..
3.Coming to the desserts we had 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebut Swiss Chocolate Mousse-again an unique combination with  an unique taste.. 
One can choose from a range of unique cocktails also, though I preferred to stick on some traditional whisky brand.. 
Pocket pinch is not much.. Overall a very good experience.. Coming back soon n if u guys are anyhow nearby, do visit this place..

Went there with friends. The food was really delicious. For starters we had nagori kebab. Then for mains we ordered shepherd's pie, baked fish wellington, coq-au-vin and chicken stoganoff. All were good, but the standout dish was fish wellington. Price is a bit high, but if you wanna have good continental food, then this is a nice place to try. I intend to go there again and try out their Indian menu.

Town's one of the new hotspot  which is perfect for friends n family get-together. Location wise not on very prominant place I would say but yes! the food quality and the dim litted ambience made me go thrice in a month. Their chef special paper wrapped bhekti in cheese is my all time favourite. This cheesy baked fish will just melt in the mouth and its so delicious that words might fail. Then comes their signature dish tempura fish fry (complimented by the orange tangy sauce) in beer can and dajaj charmoula obviously a must try for evry non veg foodie. 
Black jack and sangria are my favourites though their hitman and LIIT are quite hit in their list of cocktails. Their experiment with cuisines has taken molecular gastronomy to a different level. The alcoholic beverages are so delicately prepared that u will enjoy the subtle flavour of everything that the dish is comprised of.
In main dish I tried lal mansh and butter naan. Presentation is very impressive but I didnot it find the mutton very tender.
After having starters, two round of drinks ( because one would not suffice, so two rounds atleast) and the main course, there wont be much space for dessert still I would recommend to try their jack daniels choco mousse. Its out-of-the-world!

After being for a long time in my wishlist, I finally visited this place. Very easy to locate and with classy decor we started our Sunday afternoon craving. 
Starters:
Beer Can Tempura Fish: Crispy outside but melts in mouth.. a must have.
Dajaj Chermula: Very well cooked Chicken lebeneese item. Tastes amazing.
Pork Ribs: Never had pork ribs with achari twist. Very nice innovation.
Mutton Halim Kibbeh : Must say very different in taste. Loved it
Burrah Kebab Fish: Melts in mouth... Tastes nice

Main course:
Coq-Au-Vin : Chicken cooked in red wine sauce served with herb rice. Tastes ok.
Sherpherds Pie : The best ever Lamb pie  I had
Ham Steak with Lyonaise Potato : Just awesome

Cocktail
Should leave the order to the restaurant staffs as they know the best for you.
We had Action 20000
English Beefeater Lemon Shocker
Pain Killer
Hitman
Jet Fuel

We had so much booze, had to skip the desserts.
Pocket pinch is moderate.

After seeing so many positive and good reviews of the restaurant, me and my husband decided to visit the place. But we did not awestruck by the food like it was written in so many reviews. I have had better dishes at other places, that we ordered.

Ambiance¬† - 3/5, it was ok with very dim lights and soothing music in the background, personally i found the place congested, they could have arranged it in better way so that it will be bit more spacious.

Our order -

1. Tangerita from the mocktail section - 4/5, Fresh, chilled, tangy and sweet

2. Kele Ke Phool- 2/5, It was like a veg kabab, did not find it great.

3. Bikaniri Aloo Tikki Frites - 3/5 it was good

4. Nawabi dum ki paneer - 2/5, taste could have been better.

5. Garlic naan - 1/5, found it too much thick, it wasnt crispy.

Spicekraft, a restaurant that adds wonderful twist to the simple ordinary food. The food here is undoubtedly top notch. They've added a touch of molecular gastronomy in their menu that makes it all the more special. The interiors are very well decorated and tables are set up elegantly with set of glasses & the cloth napkins beautifully curved inside them. Also the service was absolutely flawless. The head chef comes up to each table to ensure you're having a great time. In fact he took the liberty to explain the dishes and also suggest us their specials. Such kind of hospitality is really rare these days and sure is an added bonus besides the delicious food. 

Coming to the food & drinks we ordered - 
‚Ä¢ Cucumber Cooler - A truly refreshing & soothing mocktail, and  perfect for a sunny afternoon. 
‚Ä¢The Painkiller - a cocktail with tequila, Cointreau and cranberry juice. If you're a cosmopolitan fan, you're sure gonna love this. 
‚Ä¢ Dajaj Charmoula - Grilled chicken drumsticks marinated in Charmoula spices & served with a special sauce. It was absolutely cooked to perfection. This is one of the best starters I've had. Also the presentation deserves a mention for sure. 
‚Ä¢Lymwn Samak - it is an Arabian style lemon flavoured grilled fish. It was so delicious and soft that it almost melted in our mouths. 
‚Ä¢Nasi Goreng - Indonesian style rice dish made with a lot of spices and if you spicy food lover this is the perfect dish for you. The flavours of this dish goes perfectly with any chicken or fish gravy. 
‚Ä¢Hot Garlic Chicken - Chunks of chicken with veggies in hot garlic sauce. Absolutely delish.
‚Ä¢100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Chocolate Mousse -  Whisky infused mousse served along with sponge cakes. This is the best dessert and this combination is undoubtedly magical. You can feel the slight essence of whisky in the mousse vividly. 

Each and every dish is value for money. This is definitely one of the best diners of Kolkata and if you haven't experience their delicious fusion food yet you might as well do it at the earliest.

Went to this place recently with a friend and had an awesome experience to say the least. From the decor to the dishes each and every item has a unique personality. The owner and the staff are attentive and the waiter helped us to choose our drinks and dishes from their fancy menu.
I had the tangerita from the mocktail section - tangy with a touch of spiciness, it's an instant mood booster. For starter, we had their very popular dajaj chermoula - succulent drumsticks that came with a sweet creamy sauce. 
Main course consisted of Nasi goreng and Hunan fish. A typical Indonesian fried rice, Nasi goreng was spicy, tossed in soy and topped with our desi phuchkas, that too sweetened ones! Hunan fish had a tempered taste just the one you need with such spicy rice.
My sweet tooth forced me to order a dessert though I was quite full. Classic Monte Carlo it was, a sinful combination of vanilla and chocolate ice cream that drew our culinary adventure to a perfect closure.
Overall an amazing experience and would like to come back here to taste their delectable fare again.

Spice Kraft is almost at par with fine dining restaurants . I have only tried their Chinese and continental dishes and have loved both . I feel that the prices are a tad bit on the higher side , but the taste makes up for it. On my visits , I tried "Orange Peel Chicken" , "Pan Fried Fish" , "Pork Rendang Curry" , "Moon Fan Fried Rice" , "Coq Au Vin" , "Nasi Goreng", "Mixed Hakka Noodles" and "Chicken and Mushrooms in Oyster sauce". I love their Coq Au Vin. It's a must try for all continental cuisine lovers. Their pan fried fish , moon fan fried rice and orange peel chicken are exquisite. They also make Mixed Hakka Noodles very well . The Nasi Goreng, Pork Rendang Curry and Chicken in Oyster sauce weren't that good. Other than that I will definitely return for more of their fine dishes .

As always the behaviour and the service of the waiters was excellent. It was nice to have the place dimly lit. 
For drinks, Kool Cucumber was very refreshing and had a mild flavour of ginger. For starter, I had Bikaniri Aloo Tikki Frites, Kele Ke Phool and I like them very much. 
For the main course, Paneer in choice of sauces and Veg Nasi Goreng was delicious. 
Always love to visit this place.

I can now proudly say that I have ticked this restaurant off my list today. The moment we entered, I knew I was in for a wonderful lunch experience. As soon as we grabbed our tables, the owner, who is also the head chef greeted us. He was courteous enough to stand there and help us through the menu, asking for our personal preferences and tastes individually, explaining the specialties. He was doing the same with every guest.

The ambience and setting of the place was very calm and cozy, with very dim lights and soothing music in the background. From what I had heard, it is known as a non vegetarian‚Äôs paradise, but to my surprise it‚Äôs a paradise for vegetarians too.

We ordered-

1.	Tangarita- Fresh, chilled, tangy and sweet. A perfect refreshment packed with loads of flavours.

2.	Terminator- A perfect cockatil to have before you start your meal. This one is strictly for beer lovers. They serve a pint of heineiken inverted in a glass with tequila.

3.	Kele ke phool- It was undoubtedly the best dish of the day. Tasted like a veg kabab, served with a very delicious ginger flavoured french dressing. So perfectly cooked, with amazing balance of flavours and spices.

4.	Stir Fried Scall and mushroom duxelle- A very innovative dish indeed! Looked like bruschetta, topped with a mushroom reduction. It was a little too sweet, but the taste was so awesome that it kind of made up for the sweetness.

5.	Veg Spring Rolls- Very rarely have I had such flaky and perfectly crispy spring rolls. The crust was perfect with spicy stuffing, served with thai red chilli sauce.

6.	Chilli paneer with rice- It was so well made, the paneer cubes, the gravy loaded with vegetables, aptly spicy went really well with the rice.

7.	Monte Carlo- A combination of chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream served in a glass. Perfect dessert to end things on a sweet tooth.

8.	Beyond Fried Ice cream- This was my favourite dessert. Home made ice cream crusted with flakes and deep fried to perfection. The flavor of the ice cream was simply sinful and heavenly.

9.	100% Jack daniels- Whisky infused sponge cake pieces, served with a coffee flavoured mousse. This bizzaire combination actually worked pretty well.

Overall, a must visit for a classy experience. Highly Recommended.

P.S- don‚Äôt forget to end your meal with their fried ice cream.

Food quality has gone down. Sitting arrangement quite uncomfortable, as the tables are positioned too close to each other. Too loud and noisy, as the restaurant failed to remind few of its customers about the etiquette they must follow in a closed public place. Good to serve one as a bar/pub, but definitely not a decent place to take ur family.

Always wanted to visit this place . It has a great ambience and a lovely staff. I loved the food here to the core. 
For coolers i had Tangrita which was so refreshing and tasty , doing justice to its name it was a tangy drink that chilled my afternoon.
For starters i had Kele ke phool Ke Croque Monsieur , Stir fried scall and mushroom duxelle. I loved both of them ... the best starters i have ever tasted . Kele ke phool was soft and yummy . The mushroom duxelle being my favourite, the mushroom tasted delicious and blended perfectly with the bread. 
We also had Baked veg Canollis , the rice was sweet and assorted and the canollis was just melting in the mouth(soft and very delicious)
Also we had Nasi goreng with paneer ... the rice was spicy and tasted perfect with the choice of paneer .

Lastly we ordered 100% Jack Daniel's , which is mousse cake with drunk petit fours. Chocolate with the kick of alcohol did wonders to our taste buds .

I loved the food here. And enjoyed my experience a lot.

Had heard a lot about this place and was in my bucket list for quite some time now..but now no more.. I finally made it..once we entered we realized there are two kinds of seating arrangements..one spacious sunny side up and the other cosy comfy dark.. beautifully decorated and where else will you find a truck carrying salt and pepper??
Coming to the food we tasted their signature dishes which includes the most celebrated Dajaj Charmoula (we had no idea that charcoal grilled chicken could be this soft) and Lywmn samak (soft delectable pieces of betki cheese baked to perfection)..for the main course we munched on some delicious Moon fan (herbed green rice with chicken and mushroom) and hunan fish.. I had taken a red grape and basil twister to go along with this.. it was quite refreshing..
To satisfy our sweet tooth we had some really good 'beyond fried ice cream" it was just out of the world.. beautiful in one word..
Spice Kraft is a place where you will enjoy hanging out with your friends and family..and the food is no doubt is of superior quality.

The food served here is not just tasty but has got an extremely precise spice template. True to the name of the place the culinary craftsmanship is phenomenal. The essence of the base material of the dishes is richly preserved and yet there is something that makes even conventional dishes more appealing to the taste buds. However, a more extended and spread out mocktail and dessert menu would be highly appreciated. The span of the cocktail list makes the mocktail listing seem like an unwanted cousin. Staff members are eager to help and suggest.  This place definitely deserves multiple stops.

I absolutely loved the place. We had to wait 20 mins or so since the queue was huge, but it was worth it. We had the Coq-Au-Vin, Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce, Chicken Stroganoff, Beer Can Tempura Fish, Dajaj Chermoula and Jack Daniels infused mousse. Every item was excellent, from taste to presentation. Service was a bit slow because apparently everyone was ordering continental dishes. The quantity is normal and neither a lot nor in morsels. Everything was perfectly cooked with the absolute right blend of spices. The ambiance and music and presentation go hand in hand. Surely going again. Half marks deducted for the extremely slow service.

Went there 2 months ago for lunch with my girlfriend. Ambience there was awesome to say the least, nicely decorated, soothing place. Staffs are well mannered and courteous, they know what they are serving and answered all my curiosity about the food I am having.

We ordered Beer Can Tempura Fish, Dajaj Chermoula (it was suggested by them), Nawabi Dum Ki Murg, Chicken Lucknowi Dum Biriyani, Butter Naan and 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Mousse for the desserts.

Coming to the starters, Beer Can Tempura Fish was out of this world, and will surely visit again to have it if not for anything else. Fish was just melting in mouth and the taste was subtle yet so delicious.

Dajaj Chermoula, one of their speciality, so they suggested it when I asked what should I take. Chicken was well cookee, it had all the right ingredients to make it delicious. And the dips that were served with it had something special about them.

Biriyani was good, not the best I had, but it was okay. Butter Naan could have been better but the Nawabi Dum ki Murg was outstanding.

Even though the main course, especially the Biriyani disappointed us but they make it up for us with the dessert. It was probably one of the finest dessert I had. One could taste the richness of Jack Daniels in the Mousse, and it was served with their house made sponge cake and liquid orange jam. It took the whole lunch to another level.

Overall it was a pretty damn good experience which is obvious by the rating. Hoping to visit again soon. :)

This place is near Ballygunge phari petrol pump.Just 3minutes away.The ambience is perfect in blue light.This is the place which is perfectlysuitable for every event.Family,friends,romantic date and even alone just yourself.

We visited this place in a group of 6.We ordered various items here.I foundthat every item was individual and brilliant itself.

Very unassuming from outside this restaurant is a must try. I went there for snacks and drinks and I was pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't say their forte is the taste of the food which is excellent no doubt. But what I found to be great about this place was the exciting menu and thorough food presentation. Fantastic. I tried the obvious tempura beer can fish and Shepherd's pie. I am definitely going back to try the other items.

Went around 12 30 pm. It was empty.
This restaurant was on my wishlist for a loooong time. After visiting it I must say I wasn't disappointed at all. We ordered multiple starters . All of them were delicious. My personal favourite was Beer Can Fish Tempura .
In the main course I loved Baked Fish Wellington. It was non spicy and really tasty. The Nasi Goreng I felt wasn't good enough. I liked it better at other Asian restaurants.
Among the drinks Kokum Rita was my favourite.
Coming to the staff. They were really helpful and cordial but somewhat reluctant to changing plates or spoons. One of my friends felt his spoon wasn't clean enough. When we asked them to change , they said it's just been kept there in the morning .And as we had ordered multiple starters , I asked them to change the plates after eating a few of them as the plates were really small n gravy were spices from the previous food items were sticking to it..which was making it difficult to differentiate btwn tastes of different dishes...but the waiter said we'll chamge it during the main course. I did not like this behaviour and that is the reason for giving 3.5 stars to a restaurant which deserves higher.

I visited this place on a special occasion and it was a memorable experience back then.
We ordered:
Deconstructed Papdi Chaat; it's a molecular infusion preparation of this famous street food. Taken one shot at a time it was amazing.
Dajaj Charmola Chicken; this Lebanese preparation is a must-try. The dip served was ingenious.
Beer Can Tempura fish; the beer batter covered fish just tastes out of the world with a mildly sweet flavour. Once again, I just can't stop appreciating te dips.
Nawabi Dum ki Murg; this is a yellow gravy with Lucknowi spices and tasted quite good.
Naan: I have tried the plain naan and garlic naan and wasn't disappointed.
Jack Daniels and Barry Callebout swiss chocolate mousse: This boozert tastes heavenly and is a must try for chocolate connoisseurs.
Chef Sambit interacted with us personally and also served a complimentary dessert the Monte Carlo. It was such a delight to dine here.
Also on my next visit I tried the Bacardi lemon infused sausages and Veg sushis.. liked the former disliked the latter although my sister quite liked the sushi (it was spicy).
The ambience is average. The way they decorate the tables with trucks and wine glasses is admirable.

Spicekraft..the name itself is enough to raise some sort of mystery about this place.This was my 1st visit to this diner which is conveniently located very close to Ballygunge phari,right on Hazra Road.This place makes you feel happy as soon as you enter it.This place oozes ambience through its rich decor and quaint designs right across all the walls and augmented by the soulful instrumental retro melodies playing in the background.The staff is courteous and helpful regarding all aspects from choosing our delicacies to serving them perfectly.Now coming to the Food, the starters we had were heavenly.we had Devilled Crab Meat and Murga Zakra kebabs for our starters.The Devilled Crab Meat was smooth and melted in our mouth to add to our delight.The Zakra kebab is something different and unusual regarding the spices mixed in it but that makes it more hot and appealing.i would say these are must try out items for 1st time visitors.Among the main course delicacies we had The Laal Maas..The gravy of this delicacy was amazing..as we were a group of 7...we had our individual choices..some had continental like the Grilled fish in Lemon Butter sauce and The Baked fish Wellington..Both were top notch..the Green Chilli Chicken is a dry prepartion but is a good choice to add on if you have decided upon something chineese to satisfy your apetite..The Biriyani was a major let down..i would say it was way below our expectations..There is also an array of drinks to quench your thirst..The Chowmein like the one we had the Mixed Chili Garlic noodles was impressive..So our 1st visit to this well known place was with its ups and downs...Hope to be back to try their Signature dishes...

In one word - Outstanding. After waiting for couple of minutes we started our orgasmic journey. We ordered Dajaj Charmoula and Beer Can Tampura Fish as appetizers accompanied with Jack Black and Blue Electric Smirnoff. Dajaj Charmoula's chicken was soft, juicy and heavenly in taste. The fish tempura just melted in our mouths. The presentation was very innovative. The Jack Black is not very sweet but unlike anything i have tried so far. The blue electric was very refreshing and highly liked by my wife. As we were in mood for some continental  we ordered Coq - Au - Vin and Baked Fish Wellington. The coq au vin is cooked perfectly with generous chicken and mushroom pieces in red wine. In no time I finisjed it off. During this time my wife finished off the baked fish wellington which had two pieces of bheckti. This was also very good. After all this we ordered 100% Jack Danoels & Barry Callebut Swiss Chocolate Mousse, Drunken Petit Fours to fulfill our dessert craving. This too was superb. We look forward to visit this place soon to try out the other dishes. At the end we gave our compliments to the chef for the excellent food quality. Me and

This place opened very recently about 2 years ago and since inception, it has very quickly risen in ranking and now sits comfortably as the top restaurant in Kolkata.¬†

Its continental spread is something to die for, if you love continental. The cocktails are uniquely thought of and well made as well.¬†

Beautiful interiors, it's an excellent choice for a romantic date or even a friendly union. Surprisingly, the amazing quality of food comes at a very affordable rate.

Tip: If you are want to dine out in any one restaurant in Kolkata, this is the one you can go to without a second thought!

Ambience & decor :
This place had been in my bookmarks for quite some time as it's consistently high rating was really impressive. This place is has a good ambience but it's is very small. Decor is simple and sober.
Food:
We had Bacardi Limon infused chicken sausage, beer can tempura fish, devilled crab meat and dajaj chermoula. Devilled crab meat and dajaj chermoula is a must try.
They have a special section called boozerats which is supposed to be booze and dessert together. We had Jack Daniel's chocolate mousse and beyond fried ice cream . They surprised us by giving the beyond fried ice-cream as a birthday complimentary and it's a must try. We also tried kiwi mango mocktail.
Budget :
It's a budget friendly restaurant. And I am really impressed with the food quality and taste. They offer you some really amazing and creative food items at a very affordable price. So, this place is a must go if you are a big foodie .

The ambience is quite good with a sweet music in the background. The service is very nice. We ordered The Dajaj Charmoula which was indeed praiseworthy. In starters I also had murgh reshmi malai which was also quite delicious. The Chicken in Chilly oyster and Mushroom with Moon Faan is my favourite in the main course from this place. Ice Cream lovers must not miss the Classic Monte Carlo and Beyond Fried Ice-cream. Overall an ideal place for some delicious food in a classic environment.

I have tried out many restaurants so far but when it comes to creativity and innovation, I'll always go for SpiceKraft. Located near the Hazra Law College, SpiceKraft is one gem of a place. Nothing, just nothing disappointed me.

Starting from the ambience, it was nice and classy and the decor was just awesome with the dim lights. A perfect place to sit with your partner and enjoy the food and the drinks.

The staffs and the owner were very courteous and helpful. They are always concerned about the satisfaction of their customer.

Coming to the Food. It was my Birthday night and we had ordered their signature dish,
Dajaj Charmoula- Perfectly smoked chicken served in small pots. The dip with it was just too good. The chicken was juicy and there was small piece of charcoal at the bottom of the pot to give that smoky taste to the chicken.

Next we took Beer Can Tempura Fish- The deeply fried fish with a dip served in Beer Can was just amazing.

Then,
The Bacardi Limon Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausage is now one of my favourites. The sausage was made in tandoori style and it was just very soft.

We ordered Kiwi and Mango Collins from their Drink & Drive menu and I went for their Classic Cocktail, Sangria(white wine).

For Main Course we ordered Chicken Haka Noodles and Chicken in Sichuan sauce.
The noodles was like the regular Haka noodles but the Chicken in Sichuan Sauce was just extra-ordinary.

Lastly, we took Classic Monte Carlo. It had one scoop of Vanilla Icecream and one scoop of Chocolate icecream with chocolate sauce and chocolate biscuits topped with choco sticks.

Overall, I had a very good experience here and I'd like to revist here and try out the other items too.
And the surprising part is,after ordering so many items our bill was just 2,003INR.

Cucumber cooler was such a pleasure after the humid weather outside, it was pure bliss!! It was an awesome experience!! Can't wait to be back there.

My present favourite. Been twice till now. Our first visit was for my b'day lunch earlier this july and second one was in durga saptami. We tried dishes like dajaj chermoula, sish taouk, beer bater fish,barcardi limon infused chicken, mion faan, nasi goreng, chilly oyester chicken, orange peel chicken and a puja spcl achhari amla morubba chicken. Loved all of them bcoz of the variety and richness of the taste.. jack daniels moose cake is a boon to the dessert lovers. This place have a gr8 bar menu which is very much affordable too. Stuffs are courteous. During the puja service was a little slower but that can b overlooked. Over all had  gr8 experiences both the time and want to visit again and again.

Okay.. This will be a bit long.
Another place in my bucketlist which I so wanted to visit! With its ravishing reviews, the place has created quite a buzz and I must say, it totally lives up to its reputation.
Their timings on Thursday is 6pm-12pm but I wasnt aware of that and I made my table reservation for 1pm. Though technically they were closed, but since they accepted my reservation, the owner himself came to us and asked for just an hour to set everything up.
The ambience is top class and I have never seen such a jolly and good owner who seemed pleased to make his guests happy.
As for the food.. Its the best continental Lunch I ever had. We took the following
Beer can tempura fish - their house speciality of beer batter tempura fishes served in a Budweiser can.
Vegetable in canoli wrap - the dish was beautifully presented and tasted heavenly!
Shepherd's pie - another of their house speciality served with toasted garlic breads.. It was so creamy and the lamb was so juicy! A must try.
Lobster thermidor - this dish tasted as beautiful as it looked. Served with rice and boiled veggies its a cheese-lover's dream dish as it was covered in cheese.
Utterly butterly jameson - I have never tasted such a tasty cocktail! Made with peanut butter, heavy cream, chocolate and jameson whisky, it tasted so sweet in the mouth whereas u could feel the whisky while gulping it down. Must say, this drink is a lot stronger than it looks.
I also wanted to try their Dajaj Chermoula and jack daniels mousse (both of which are their signature dishes), but we were already full.
Overall, my best continental experience and really a place of dreams. The friendly staff and the owner (who also happens to be the head chef) makes the place even more better.. Will surely return.

Loved the smoky taste of the Dajaj Chermoula, the beer can tempura fish and Bacardi Limon Infused tandoori chicken sausages are brilliant and creative dishes. Continental classics are also awesome.

Dropped in today with some friends to this much awaited place.
Started off with a drink named Red Grape n Basil Twister, a perfect drink with a smooth flavour to go with the dishes we had.
Firstly ordered Dajaj Charmoule, a dish people have been raving about from this place. Perfectly smoked drumsticks served in pots.
Next up was Lymwn Samak, my favorite of the place. The pieces of fish were extremely soft n buttery and melted in the mouth.
Next up was Beer Can Tempura Fish, which was another favorite, served in a beer can. It was cooked to perfection.
Each of these starters were served with their individual dips that was perfectly complementary.
Next for main course we ordered Chicken Hakka noodles and Chicken in Masaman Curry. The noodles was like any other normal hakka noodles but the curry was a cherry on the top. It had a very pleasant flavour cooked with lemon leaves. 
Such happy tummy days. Would love to drop again for the desserts very soon.
Bon appetite!

Spice Kraft, the pioneer of molecular gastronomy in Kolkata, has always been a much anticipated and superhyped joint and when I did visit it now, It didn't disappoint at all! 
Every dish I tried here was impeccably designed and brilliantly presented.
I tried :
Kokum Rita : A spicy, vodka based cocktail that complemented the food so well. (3.5/5)

Dajaj Chermoula : The signature of this restaurant, perfectly cooked chicken drums in subtle spices melded in a creamy base. Served in raised ceramic cups, the presentation was on point. (4/5)

Beer Can Tempura Fish : Flaky, soft fish fingers golden fried in amazingly light and crisp beer batter, served with an orange ponzu dip. Served inside a beer can, quirky yet such a beautiful dish to taste. (4.5/5) 

Fish en Papiotte : Another fish dish, ordered this because this was on an exclusive menu. Large chunks of fish baked to perfection in a lightly spiced creamy marinade wrapped in parchment. With a smokey, coconut hint, this was so surprisingly good, I have never tried anything like it before. This dish reminds you what a restaurant experience is actually supposed to be like. (5/5)

Bacardi Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausages : Another masterpiece. So quirky and brilliant. Chicken sausages seared in tandoori spices served with lemon bacardi infusion. The infusion is put in little plastic droppers and inserted into the sausage, so much fun. This was served exotic with a blueberry dip. (5/5)

Chicken Chilly Noodles : Chicken noodles tossed tangy spices. (3.5/5)

Hunan Fish : Chunks of fish in a light pepper sauce. Very enjoyable. (4/5)

Fried Ice Cream : Now, you might have had fried ice cream before but this dish is one levelled up by a brilliant chef. Crispy golden fried scoop of vanilla ice cream on a bed of chocolate fudge cake crimbed in orange sauce. The crumb base takes the classic dish to another level. So good. (5/5)

100% Jack Daniel's Mousse : This has got to be among the best dessert dishes served in this town. The mousse is amazingly light and has a real kick from the whisky added. Served with mango coulis and petit fours, this was one fine tantalizing experience on the taste buds. (5/5)

Service was courteous. Overall, a very exciting and never before experience. Would definitely come back!

Failed to live up to the hype tbh.. Had lot of expectations from this place, but well.. Also, I think we were offered a minimised version of the menu, not sure though.. Maybe because we visited a week after Durga pujas. Limited options didn't help the case either.

Pro: The beer can tempura fish is exquisite.. The flavour of the orange in the sauce was delightful! Must try xD 
The 100% Jack Daniel's chocolate mousse was amazing too. You can smell and taste the whiskey.
Dajaj Chermoula was also well prepared. 
They make a lit sangria xD
Cons: We also ordered the Pork ribs with imli chutney. To put it lightly, it was horrible.. I've eaten many a ribs in my life, this dish resembled nothing close to the general idea of pork ribs that we know. We were given two large chunk of bones with bits of meat attached to it. It was more of a struggle than a meal
The devilled crab was also a disappointment. There was nothing particularly off with it, but I've had better.

Its a small eatery..however the quality of food ensures that there is beeline in the entry!! The signature dish...dajaj charmoula is heavenly...dont miss it for anything!! The main course has a variety to choose from....also the array of innovative mocktails and cocktails are great!! One regret was...we dint have the chance to taste their fish in beer can dish....which we intend to do in our next visit...thumbs up!!

So, finally, a family outing happened and I am more than happy. Reserved our tables and voila...got introduced to a series of yummy and oh-so-good dishes presented in a unique manner. First of all, spare me with all the names, however, the starters including fish, chicken, mutton, paneer and veggies blew our minds. Main course including conti¬†meals of chicken, fish & veg items along with some mocktails and cocktails were stunners as well. We ate our hearts out until the dessert including ice-cream and boozard¬†arrived. We jumped and had them in seconds..hehe!!

Wanted to visit spice kraft for a long long time. So finally went there on the eve of kali puja. We reached there around 9 pm and as expected had to wait in a queue. So finally we went inside around 9.40 pm. We went on to finalize the order and started giving it. The first bad news was they were out of beer. Anyways we went with black dog after that. We also ordered Dajaj Chermoula, Hong shao rou, laal maas, hari moti pulao, butter naan's and sangria, blue frappe and kiwi mango collins for the ladies. After giving the order, we saw one of the server serving beer. When asked about it, he said they ordered it before, though i vividly remember them coming after us. Anyways that was not the big deal. The food taste was very very good, i must say, the cooking was very well done. While we were having starters, one of the servers informed us that the last order time was 10.30 pm, so if we want to order something, we should do it now. So we ordered one more fish starter, but the server again informed us that though we are ordering a starter now, we will get it after the main course. So i asked the server whats the point of getting a starter after starting with main course. He said, he cant stop the preparation of main courses because of our starter. I was pretty taken aback by this reply and ultimately decided to chuck off the additional starter. Even though i will definitely visit the place again for its food, but on contrary i would think twice to visit there because of the service. Maybe we were there on the last hour and they were not in their best, but thats what makes a place different from others. Summary of my rating:
Ambience-4/5
Food(Taste)-5/5
Food(Cost)-5/5
Service-1/5

This is one place which has forced me to be back on Zomato, for all good reasons. I am reviewing a restaurant after ages now, and it ought to start with Spicekraft. I have been here too many times and I plan to go back to this place soonest again for the lipsmacking dishes and the warmth of the staff as well as the owner. I have tried almost all their signature dishes and love all of them with all my heart. Their cocktails are awesome and everything id served and plated brilliantly.

Have been hearing about this place for quite some time and when I again got a referral from one of my foodie friends on Saturday 21st Oct, I couldn't hold myself. It was the occasion of Bhai-Duj and so planned out a wife+sibling get-together. (P.S. - On such occasions, I need to pay the bill :( )

Point 1 - Book your table in advance by calling them or else you might need to wait for your turn since the place gets lot many visitors.

Point 2 - Try out the cocktails at this place and instead of going by the menu, ask them about the special ones that are not listed.¬†

If you want to get something strong down your throat then go for Badman (make sure you don't drink and drive). Badman is mainly a combination of JD and Silver Tequila. A smoother version which had a touch of wine added is the Vaporiser-can try this one as well.

For starters we ordered Beer Can Tempura Fish (taste was normal but presented very well), Bacardi Limon Infused Tandoori chicken Sausages (was spicy but again taste wise normal), Dajaj Charmoula (the chicken pieces were really tender)

For main course we had Coq-Au-Vin (rice & chicken, wouldn't recommend this) and Shepherd's Pie (combination of cheese&shredded lamb -¬† this was awesome, though had a similarity with lasagne).

So, to conclude, you should definitely pay a visit to this place (and eat). Badman is calling, so I should¬† be going again.

I don't think my review actually counts after you have seen the overall rating based on the no. of people visited.
But still, its a mandatory one, just like not having a dessert after mains doesn't actually complete a meal, isn't it ? :-)
¬†Anyway, I tried their recommended dishes and they are in one word, fantabulous (had to add two words, though no end of adjectives for them). 
Starting with beer can tempura, Dajaj Charmoula, going through the mains (Shepherd's pie, Nasi Goreng, Chicken in chilly oyster and mushrooms, Shredded lamb in Masaman curry)¬† and ultimately applying the brakes to 100% Jack Daniels Mousse , man, it was one of the best food journey I ever had.
Everything was perfectly cooked, presented, the service was prompt and yes I will be going back to them (at least for the mousse, which I can have all day long yet will be longing for it every time).
So thats it for now, I beg pardon for saying less though, I think so. :-D

Location: Near Ballygunje phari / Ballygunje circular road.

If you are reading this then don't think anymore and just GO to this restaurant. Undoubtedly one of the best restaurants that I have come across in Kolkata. Truly one of my favorite restaurants in Kolkata. The quality  of  food was  excellent and so is the quality. And the food tasted even better with such an amazing and courteous staff. The outer look of the restaurant is not one of the best but once you enter it and start ordering it makes up for it. 

Some of the dishes one should really try would be the:
Beer Can Tempura Fish
Shepard's Pie
Laal Maas
Rarha Goshth

Ambience: 5/5
Taste: 5/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Gone there after going through its rating and feedback from friends. We had beer can tempura fish with orange ponzu tartare which was a sauce. The sauce was very tasty. We even had grilled fish with lemon butter sauce and penne pasta alfra. Presentation was good. But i Didn' t like the taste much. The staffs were good.

One of the best foods I have had in a long time. Every Dish was perfect . Even the mocktails were amazing. Last but not the least it doesn't leave a hole in your pocket unlike other overpriced restaurants with overrated food. This restaurant is a must try .

This one is neat and has a lot on the menu to choose from. Ordered their 'dajaj charmoula' as suggested by most on zomato, and it makes for a pretty lipsmacking starter.

Their cocktail menu has a lot of variety. Had ordered a Margherita and one 'Blue Electric'. Tasted amazing. You could go with the classic regulars or try something new. Won't disappoint. :)

Their 'pork sorpotel' was tasty but felt a tad bit spicier than the variants I have had before. It would be useful if they could indicate that on the menu. All in all, it does live up to the word of mouth and I'd be glad to visit here again. :)

Spice Kraft is a great place to eat out. If you visit there, their cocktails is a must, hammer jack and hitman. Also for food try their indigenous preparations like Shepherd s pie.

5 is not enough. It deserves more. The food is finger licking good, thinking abt it makes my mouth wet. Although I was stuck with the starters. Couldn't really explore the main courses.

Went there yesterday, this space is well decorated and cosy. 
We ordered , Dajaj Charmoula : the famous dish of Spice Kraft .. And it was really tasty , juicy and spicy at the same time. 
Butter Nun , Masala Kulcha and Murg Da Mokul .. This were also awesome , Murg Da Mokul is a spicy Punjabi Chicken Dish , We loved it .. 
Pocket Pinch was affordable .. 
Staffs were courteous and helpful , but as we were two they provided us a table at the corner where there was dim light ..so deducting 0.5 rating , otherwise thumbs up for this place .

I went to Spice Kraft with my boyfriend today for my Birthday lunch. The place has garnered a lot of attention since it first opened and rightly so!¬†
The ambiance is very good and so is the service. The serving time is a little more than other places but given the quality of food they deliver, this no more feels like an issue.
What We Ordered---
Starters:
Dajaj Chermoula
Beer Can Tempura Fish
Mocktail:
Kokum Rita (House Special)
Main Course:
Shepherd's Pie
Baked Fish Wellington
Dessert:
100% Jack Daniels Mousse
Beyond Fried Ice Cream
What We Liked & What We Didn't---
Every item we ordered was cooked to perfection. The starters were excellent. Even the dips that came along with the starters were great. Maybe that's the reason why every table ordered these specialty starters! The House Special Mocktail was one of a kind and we ended up ordering another one. The Main Course items were great and so were the Desserts. Although I loved every bite of every dish, I would liked to give the Fried Ice Cream a special mention. It was the best that I ever had or probably will ever have!
The staff and management were very friendly and helped us decide on what to order.
Pocket Pinch---
Our total bill was around Rs. 2400 for two people. But given the taste and quality of food, it was definitely worth it.
Verdict---
This according to me is the best restaurant in town and that's definitely saying a lot! I'll not just visit again but also recommend this place to my friends and family.

We had a family dinner yesterday in this restaurant. Loved the food and service of the stuff. They recommended the signature dishes and also described the process they are made. We ordered the signature dishes Dajaj charmoula, beer can tempura fish, bacardi infused chicken sausage. All 3 dishes were awesome. We ordered Pan fried chilly fish also, which i liked the most and a must try. Cocktails we ordered Pain killer with teqilla and cranberry, Hitman. Both were nice. 

Main course we ordered chilly garlic noodles and mandarin fish. 
Desert was the obvious choice 100 %  JD moosse. Loved evrything, but felt the space was a little cramped. Hope they will soon expand the space in future. otherwise evrything is great.

Nice place but the information is not complete here it is given that timing is up to 12 midnight but when we visited there with my friends‚Äã they said that the last order is only up to 10.30pm even for food . Even if you are half of your food we can't order anything extra to eat .. So it was a major disappointment for me and my friends . Either the taste was good . But the quantity was very much low of it.  But it is said that first impression is the last impression. So I don't think I will go there any further.

This place has everything. Good ambience, excellent service, the food is innovative as well as tasty. What else can anyone want? We ordered the following for starters:- 
1) Stir fried squid rings. This was well cooked and had a taste combination of Chinese and continental.
2) Beer can tempura fish. This is a real innovation. You must try this. 
For the main course we had,
3) Chilli garlic noodles
4) Prawn Balchoa. 
5) Gushtaba, a Kashmiri mutton dish.
6) Pork Sorpotel. 
I am not mentioning the description of each item as all of this was delicious, truly. And for the dessert we ordered,
7) Swiss chocolate mousse
8) Cointrue,orange and white chocolate parfait, dark fudge torte. This was again a unique dish. 
If you are looking for real good food, you MUST visit this place.

But service is extremely slow which resulted as a minus point, coz we had to wait for really long time before getting the food served.

After hearing tons of praises from every other person I know, decided to visit this gem of a place for a family luncheon. We started with famous Dajaj charmoula and beer battered tempura fish. The professionals who were serving us explained gleefully the cooking procedure of these dishes. We had orange cooler and rainbow as mocktail. In main course we had dak Bangla murgir Stroganoff with was a tasty affair. Then after waiting for almost half an hour the shepherd's pie arrived and it was simply superb. Completed the course with baked fish Wellington which was again very tasty. For dessert we had 100% jack Daniel's moose. I never had a moose this tasty. Pocket pinch was good too. Ambience is nice. Only the service should have been a little quick.

It was the last weekend of the puja holidays and I visited this place with my family in the afternoon.
Firstly we ordered two drinks Rainbow and Orange something..I don't remember. The drinks were good. Then we ordered Dajaj Charmoula,Beer can fish tempoura and Deviled crab as starters. Dajaj Charmoula a Lebanese recipe of chicken,was best among them. We loved the fish tempoura also. In main course we had Stroganoff, Shepherd's pie and Baked fish Wellington. The Shepherd's pie tasted awesome. A layer of cheese on top and layers of lamb chops (nuggets) beneath it made the dish heavenly. The baked fish was great too.
In desert we ordered 100% Jack Daniels Moose.It is the most popular in there.It was good also.The moose tasted good.
The waiters were attentive and friendly. The decors were good. Though the service was a bit slow and the only reason why I can't give them 5 stars.

Where to start! 
From sitting arrangement to service everything was on point. Has a really nice ambiance. We ordered baked crab, beer can tempura fish, shepherds pie and classic monte carlo. Fish had a really nice crunch to it. The sauce dip really compliments the dish. Baked crab was a pleasure to the eyes as well as taste buds. Shepherd's pie was also oozing with flavours. And the the dessert was perfect one to end the meal with. Looking forward to visit again.

After hearing  buzz about this restaurant finally visited it with my friends last month to have a self experience. Well talking abt the ambience, it's really comforting and the decor was very eye catching. The hospitality was  worth praising. Now coming to the most important part "food "üòã .  The  food was  very delicious and the tastes didn't left us dissappointed. We tried some mouthwatering starters which were yum yum üòãüòã. But we weren't much satisfied with the mocktail 'virgin mojito'. It could have been much better. But nevertheless the overall experience has been very good and i am looking forward to try some of their's  other special dishes as well.

The Spice Kraft Looks quite undramatic from outside and barely visible from a distance, this place on the Hazra Road, BLN is one of the finest restaurants I've been in Kolkata that has stood the test of time. As we stepped in, we weren't very impressed with the interior decor as it was flooded with natural light but hold on, there's another section inside & it's grandeur was quite captivating. It was dimly lit and tastefully decorated. As we settled in, we ordered Terminator(Heineken Beer cocktailed with Tequila) and The Mango Driver (Absolut vodka) from the Drinks menu and chicken something (don't remember) from the Entr√©e. Now, The Terminator is named as such for a reason, It is quite strong and numbed our senses so much so that The Mango driver felt like a glass of water. The chicken Entr√©e tasted divine with the sauce. The restaurant personnel are highly professional and very friendly. The chef himself came over and greeted gracefully. On the food, we ordered Steamed rice and Bhetki. Tasted like heaven till the last bite. This place is a must go for food lovers and sea food aficionados. The service is top notch and most of all, it is pocket friendly. I can't wait to go back there.

The decore, the staff, the dim lights all are secondary. Primary is the food and if beverages can be taken into account then this place deserves a 5/5. All cocktail lovers must visit this place at least once. Prices may be on the higher side but the cocktail will justify the bill. I ordered a pain killer and yes it is a namesake indeed. I ordered a kebab which could have been more succulent so deducting 0.5 points for that.

Finally I got the chance to visit this place and I am so immensely happy that I did. Nothing actually disappointed me about this place. We had cocktails and starters, and I am eagerly waiting to have some main course as well soon. We had the highly recommended dajaj chermoula and beer can tempura fish, which was simply incredible. The chicken pieeces were soft, tender right amount of all the spices and well cooked. The tempura batter formed a crisp outer layer and the soft fish inside. The dogs were so very tasty. We also ordered lymwn samak which is a fish preparation as well which was delicious. Also, we had hong shou ro which is a pork preparation which was again topnotch. Even the cocktails were incredible. I had a waiter's suggested painkiller which was mind blowing. Lastly, I am incredibly impressed with the hospitality, especially the Head Chef. He actually gave us a brief knowledge about the dajaj chermoula and tempura fish. You are incredible sir. :)  I am so looking forward to visit this place again. And of course the prices are moderate but it's so much worth it.

I'm rating this restaurant a 1 based on my yesterday's experience.
We travelled all the way from Baguiati for lunch at this restaurant and were denied entry when we reached at 3:30.Even when operating hours were till 4, we were informed that last order should be placed by 3.
What's the point in listing wrong operating hours and harassing customers?

In one word...mesmerising... I usually dont rate restaurants with a perfect 5/5 rating unless its that great, but this one..i simply couldnt stop myself from giving 5/5. Firstly, the ambience...its very calm, decent, soothing, bottles of wines decorated on a wall, very neatly setup tables and good music, overall the ambience is really nice. The staffs are very courteous and i would recommend others to go for their suggestions. Coming to the food...there's a reason this place is so highly rated. Not only do they serve some of the tastiest foods in town but also some of the well decorated ones. Amazing food served in great style adds upto a great experience! All their dishes, whether it be the indonesian style spicy rice nasi goreng served with egg poach, the soft juicy hunan fish with the perfect touch of spices or their mouth watering starters and continental dishes, the style of serving is surely going to impress all. Their serving of drinks also impressed me a lot. We ordered virgin mojito, cool cucumber and orange juice. The cool cucumber had a strange but very unique and different taste which i liked a lot. But honestly, i was rather very impressed with the serving style of some of the mocktails served in other tables. Even though the chicken dishes like the dajaj chermoula are awesome, but i would specially recommend the fish dishes as they simply blew my mind away, specially 'lymwn samak' served with a mayo dip, it was completely new to me...soft mushy fish, slow roasted on the outside with a taste of lebanese spices, with creamy filling oozing out through the skewer hole, served with mayo dip...it was out of this world!
Ambience-4.7/5
Staffs-4.5/5
Food-5/5
Serving style-5/5
Value for money-4.78/5 at around 600-650/head without alcoholic drinks, i think its great.
I am definitely going to visit this place again soon. You should too!

Well there are some places which become so famous that one tends to have high expectations from them,, but when you finally visit them, they fail to live up to your expectations. Spice Kraft is surely one of them. Went there for Ashtami lunch and had to wait for around an hour and 15 minutes which was nothing unexpected. But what was unexpected is that while calling out the list of the names of the people who had queued up outside, the manager simply overlooked ours and instead called out the names of all those who had come after us. When we finally realised this and confronted the manager, he initially had no reply but after a while came and told us that he had called our name repeatedly but we did not pay attention.. while we were standing right in front the entire time!! Furthermore once when we were finally seated and had placed our order, they made us wait another 40 minutes for the food which was pathetic as we had already waited for so long outside.Coming to the food we ordered one dish from their Pujo special menu- Duckbungalow Murgir Stroganoff, and another from their regular menu- Lobster Thermidor. The chicken dish was tasty and the buttered rice served along with it smelled nice and tasted good. And it might sound odd but I would have liked the dish more if the quantity of rice would have been slightly more and the chicken little less. The lobster dish had a very weird smell which I didn't like and could not bear to have more than one spoonful of that dish.Ambience was lovely though and they had not increased the prices much in the pujo special menu which was commendable.

Ambience : 4
Service : 5

An excellent place serving lip smacking foods with a team of courteous staffs. Visited during puja time for lunch. Where the other places compromise on food quality during puja rush this place is an exception. They have I think 2 sections for sitting , we got the inside one which was bit dark but as all the tables were filled up there was no choice left. Could have been little more illuminated.
Food was excellent .
Our order was :
Beer can tempura fish - soft juicy and oh so tasty
Sheperd's pie - again a winner dish
Baked fish Wellington - a delicious one but it was cold when served. Would taste great if served little warm.
Moon faan - it was mixed fried rice can't write anything about the taste as I didn't try it out.
Roasted pork Randang curry - I had only 2 pieces of pork with some gravy and I liked it.
Desserts - unfortunately they were not serving desserts during puja . A let down. üòî

Now coming to the drink :
Ordered Choco-beam - Jeam Beam with chocolate syrup and it was excellent.
Blue Electric - a decent one
Kokum Rita - suggested by the manager , a good suggestion I must say .

Last but not the least is service : extremely good, and I would specially mention manager Mr. Vimal Nag' name for his very warm and courteous behaviour. We were served a wrong dish of main course. On informing him the same, they replaced the dish with right one within a few minutes only which is commendable during the puja rush.

I loved this place. Will surely recommend people who are looking for great quality food, good service in moderate price range.

Since long, i have heard only good things about Spice Kraft. Heard that only few places know how to work with Molecular Gastronomy in Kolkata and this is one such place. Ever since, i have wanted to be here.
and finally got my chance and I must say i was impressed.¬†Location- on Hazra Road, Near Ballygunge Phari.¬†The signature dishes are out of this world. The Beer Batter Fish, the Dajaj Chermoula, Shepherd's Pie.¬†It was an experience to remember. I don't recall going to a place and wanting to come back the very next day to have more of this unforgettable culinary experience.¬†In the Drinks section cocktails like the The Kool Cucumber, Guava Mary, Hitman and LIIT both were excellent and i have been informed that L I I T available at the Spice Kraft is the cheapest out there.¬†
Once you have been to Spice Kraft. You would want to go there again and again.

This was my first visit to this place . For drinks , I ordered for cucumber cooler which was very refreshing . For starters , we had dajaj charmoula , beer can tempura fish , fish en papillote . Each of them were extremely tasty along with their respective dips served . For main course , we had moon faan along with chicken in oyster sauce and hunan fish . We concluded our lunch with 100% jack Danielle mousse along with Monte Carlo . Jack Danielle mousse was extremely good and surely the best . The staffs were cordial and well mannered .

This place definitely deserves a 5 out of 5... The ambiance is way too classy and the food is oh my god... The 1st thing which I ordered as I entered the place was a cocktail... As I was confused so I asked the waiter to get me the best cocktail and he brought me 'Litchitini Smirnoff'... Now about the starters... 
1. Dajaj Charmoula... Never miss this one whenever u go there...
2. Lymwn Samak
3. Tandoori Chicken Sausage
In main course u must order Moon Faan Rice along with chicken in chilli oyester and mushroom..
Lastly the deserts, you must try Beyond Fried Ice-cream and Classic Monte Carlo... I can feel that my mouth is watering as I'm writing the review for this place... Really really a nice place...

A much awaited visit to the place with my gang. Starting from the ambience to the food everything just fell on it's place. Because I liked dimly lit places the interior decor pleased me immensely. After much of a huss and fuss we finally settled down with the order.
We started with the mocktails. I ordered Red Grape and Basil Twister. The presention of the cocktail was great and it had the sweetness of grapes with a punch of basil in it.
Then came the starters - Dajaj Charmoula with it's unique dip. The dish is actually chicken in tandoor style with extremely soft texture. The dip suited well along with it.
Then was Beer can Tempura fish - the soft, well marinated fish fried well and presented in a Budweiser can is surely to take away hearts. The spicy mustard dip gelled up well. 
Then we ordered for Fish-en-Papilotte which is basically tandoor fish with butter wrapped in paper. The dip was blue in color and had a sweet taste.
Since we couldn't satisfy our appetite we ordered for Bacardi limon Infused Tandoor Chicken Sausage. The dish tasted brilliant. The sausage was made in tandoor style and one could easily say it was a mughlai dish. 
We then ordered for main course- chili garlic chicken noodles. Being a fan of spicy food we opted for Chicken in oyster and mushroom chili garlic sauce. It satisfied my spicy taste buds and the mushroom added more flavor to the dish. 
Then finally came the best part - desserts. 
We ordered for Classic Monte Carlo which is a pure combination of chocolate and vanilla ice-cream with chocolate sauce and chocolate biscuits. The dish tasted yummy.
We finally ended the feast with 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut. The sponge cake and the chocolate mousse in dish was delicious and is definitely above explanation.
We had a word with the Chef and was delighted to know about him. The experience was an amazing one and I would like visting the place again and again.

We ordered the following:
1. Breezer blaster cocktail: The cocktail was unimaginably perfect.Right proportion of vodka and white rum with mint and lime. It was served in a mason jar and had good amount of alcohol in it. The taste lingers for 2-3 hours. 
2.Dajaj Charmoula: It is a type of chicken kebab served with a dip. The chicken is extremely soft and tastes amazing. 
3. Lymwn Samak: This dish was above all the starters. I am not a fish lover but this dish won my heart. It was creamy and tender and was totally a lip-smacking dish. A must try.
4. Murg Reshmi Malai: This was the classic chicken Reshmi kebab. It was juicy and succulent. It was served with a mint dip. 
5. Chilly Garlic Noodles( Chicken) : The noodles tasted just fine. There was a lot of chicken in it and was sufficient for two heads. 
6. Chicken in Chilly Oyster & Mushroom: I couldn't find any flaw in this dish. The chicken was delicious and yet again very soft. 
7. 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut: I can't stop thinking about this dessert. The mousse was served with sponge cake. In one word this was brilliant üòçA must try.
8. Beyond fried ice cream: The presentation of this dessert was quite tempting. When I finally tasted it I could get the taste of the perfect blend of brownie, ice cream and the thin outer crust(the fried part). 
In short, Spice Kraft is one of the best place for foodies. The ambience is perfect for a date or for family gatherings with dim lights and soft music. The staffs are well-behaved and welcoming. No wonder it's one of the highly rated restaurants of Kolkata.

Spice Kraft, Kolkata‚Äôs one of the famous molecular (Rating 4.9/5 ..incredible!!) gastronomic destination located in Ballygunj recently launched their new Durga  Puja special menu to celebrate the biggest festival of Bengal. It is one of the best bar cum casual dining restaurant in the town. Molecular Gastronomy is a new dimension of food. A unique way to create an ordinary dish to something new. There is little bit science though specially chemistry, for more info you can google it but the main purpose is to develop delicious food that can be presented in new and interesting ways. I and my fellow foodie friends were invited during the Durga Puja menu launch event. It was the third time I visited place and as usual it was a splendid experience. Those who seek new and innovative dining experiences during the puja please come to this place. I am sure you will like the place. 

The decoration, low light effect, the cozy seating arrangements, background music creates a soothing ambiance. Perfect for enjoying drinks and chatting with the loved one.  

Coming to the new menu, they created some delicious starters, mouth-watering main course as well as incredible cocktails to satisfy everyone‚Äôs need. 

Drinks:

We tried three different types of cocktail. 

Jet Fuel ‚Äì It was crafted with Beer Tequila, Cointreau and Absolut Vodka. The presentation was very unique. They served it in container which was look like a small version of fuel pump you can see in any Petrol pump. 

Pain Killer ‚Äì As the name suggest this cocktail will surely kill your pain (not physical pain ..lol) and give you a prefect re-freshness. It was the mixture of silver tequila, Cointreau and shot of cranberry vodka. Amazing.

Hit Man-This one was a badass as the name suggest, it gave me a little dizziness. Must try. A perfect combination of Jim Beam Bourbon Whisky, Tequila, Cointreau, and Chefs Special secret spicy orange Tincture.

With these amazing drinks they offered some mouthwatering starter, likes

Dajaj Chermoula- Chicken drumsticks marinated with chermoula spices and perfectly grilled served in a small clay pot with small piece of charcoal inside to infuse the smoky flavour. It was juicy and delicious.

Beer Can Tempura Fish- Fish portion dipped into a batter and deeply fried and served with yummy dips inside a beer can. The batter was created with beer. The fish was very soft and juicy. Amazing in taste.

These were the all-time available preparation, for puja special you will get more innovative dishes like,

Kuler Achar Infused Murgir Temperado Amla Murabba Cruda ‚Äì Honestly I don‚Äôt have any clue how this amazing preparation was made. It was sweet tangy chicken preparation. Chicken pieces were infused with some kind of acchar(Pickle). This was the molecular gastronomy I am talking about. Just try it.

Malaikari Kancha Lonka Smoked Bhetki- Medium pieces of bhetki fish marinated with green chili and different spices, wrapped in a thin paper and grilled perfectly. The fish had unique smoky chili flavour. It was very soft and juicy. One of the best fish preparation I ever had.

Duckbunglow Murgir Stroganoff ‚Äì A fusion food. Spicy rice, boiled vegetables and specially cooked chunk of chicken served with a special sauce. The garnishing was very eye-catching. A perfect main course preparation. It was absolutely delicious.

Hanser Dim Diye Murgir Mac n Cheese- Ahhh‚Ä¶ the taste was heavenly. Pure bliss for your tastebuds. A special chicken kebabs baked with cheese. Chiken pieces were marinated with egg yolk. It was so soft and juicy, that it will melt in your mouth in no time. They served it with special dip for taste boostup. Must try.

Aam Kasundi Rubbed Sous Vide Vetki Malibu Rum Creme Chantilly- Another yummy fish kebab, infused with a mixture of Malibu rum and a special chutney. Fish was marinated with a special mixture of mustard and then grilled. Another delicious experience of molecular gastronomy. 

Well folks I hope you will visit the place ASAP, and experienced something new, something beautiful the place have to offer. The staffs and the chef is very friendly. The quality and quantity is more than satisfactory and the pocket pinch is very reasonable. No doubt this place deserve 5 out of 5 ratings if there is an option of giving 10 then I am sure I will give them 20.... !!! Cause GOOD FOOD FEEL GOOD. A special Thanks to entire team of Spice Kraft and specially for the Chef for this amazing experience, my best wish for you all. Happy eating everyone.

I am always in love with this place and I keep coming back to this place for good food , prepared in the most innovative way.
Location : Near Ballygunge Phari ( take the road that connects Ballygunge Phari and Hazra)
Highlights : Dajaaj Chalmola and Lem@on Fish or the beer batter fish are the stars among the starters.
Main: I ordered the Shepherd'Pie ( lamb) and the dish was perfectly done and so was the presentation.
The Biriyani that my friend ordered was equally palatable.
The cocktails are mind blowing. I tried my old favorite, guava Mary and my grades tried hitman, painkiller. If you are a strong drinker then try hitman and you will love it..
And as an additional information this place serves the cheapest LIT in town!!

It was my bday treat and this place was on the long awaited list and no day can be better than this for dropping into this place. We went for a lunch on a saturday noon. Had to wait for sometime before we got to sit. The ambience is soothing with low lights and spacious seating arrangement.

To start with, we took a sangria and an orange driver with fire crackers and murgh reshmi malai. The kebabs tasted exactly the way it has been described in their menu card, it is juicy and melts once it gets into your mouth. The fire crackers were crunchy‚Äã and went perfect with the drinks. In main course we opted for a shepherd's pie and baked fish wellington. Both main course were good in taste but the shepherd's pie was better and it tasted really good! And the best part of the meal was the dessert. Jack Daniels Chocolate Mousse. It comprised of JD infused chocolate mousse with their self baked vanilla spunge‚Äã cake and a tinge of orange sauce. The combination was full of flavours and they were complimentary to each other!!

The staffs were really courtatious and helped us in choosing the best food. Their presentation of food is also unique and eye catching. Overall, the experience was really good and would love to visit this place again.

Great food and beverages. Food tastes well and presented well too. My recommendations are malaikari smoked fish en papillote in food and hitman in beverages. In main course we liked the baked fish Wellington. The rest of the food is ok.

Price is on the higher side, though not exorbitant. Quantity served is comparatively lower. My recommendations is that it's Rs 1800 for two.

It's a very small place so it's mostly crowded. Recommended to book a table or go early. Good for family and friends get-together, average for romantic dinner. 

Their service is good. Staff is very friendly. The owner also the head chef will personally visit the tables and recommend items, which is a great thing.

Been here twice and always enjoyed their food and drinks. Right from Molecular Mojitos to the choiciest Sangrilas, their drinks range is great. The starters are awesome. Continental and Chinese entrees are a wow. Their presentation style is pretty unique. Staff is friendly and helpful. A great place to hang out with friends and family.

Visited this place with my boy friend a few days back and he was visiting all the way from Delhi so I had to take him somewhere to impress. Firstly,  there was a strange smell on entering the restaurant.  Too many staff yet nobody was enough responsive.  

We had ordered for the chicken stroganoff which was decent. 
The tandoori sausage with infused lemon vodka and blue berry churn coulee.  I only loved the coulee in this dish. I had really expected the sausages to be not the packaged ones we get from the super market. 
Also,  as the dishes are so delicately arranged with so many elements,  it is essential for the staff to explain the dish while serving.  Which they didn't.  

Also the LIIT which I ordered wasn't the best I had had. 
All in all, my expectations of this place was immensely high and the menu had taken me further high but the execution wasn't at Par. 

Dissapointed!

This review is overdue for ages now but here it is.

We dropped in to take away food and below are my observations.

I didn't like the interiors because of the minimalistic lighting.However,it was compensated by the way the owner cum Chef Sambit Patra interacted with us.He was very friendly and took a genuine interest to find out as to what we would like to have.

While we were waiting for the take away,he also offered us a complimentary starter which was a great gesture.

We ordered the below items:

Baked Fish Wellington-It was pretty good which had soft pieces of fish and mushrooms along with a Saffron Rice.It was priced at INR 345.

Chicken Stoganoff-Unfortunately we couldn't taste it as we dropped the dish while getting out of the car.It as priced at INR 315.

Chicken in Soya Chilli-It was very spicy but I loved it because I like spicy food.It was priced at INR 225.

The thing I didn't like was the packaging which was very shabby and looked as if it was used multiple times (please check the picture).

Please note that all prices are excluded of taxes.

The menu looks very interesting and i would like to try other items in the future.

i had the famous dish here that is Dajaj Chermoula and belive me belive me the taste is like chicken berbeque. they will serve u in a pot and its a very nice strategy, surely it will attract u and m not saying its not tasty definitely its very tasty but they will serve u only four pieces and the price is 245 which i think is really not worthy i mean u go to barbeque nation and u will get the same unlimited chicken barbeques in 800 rupees. there is no doubt they have a unique style of presenting the food and the taste is also good but very expensive nd less quantity...just  four peace of chicken(small in size) and the price is 245...i can bet u that u will find  the same taste of chkn dajaj chermoula in other restaurant. yes i appreciate ur hardwork and creativity but at the end we want some delicious food.we can spend money for it but we expect good quantity... so at last i just want to say that dajaj chermoula doesn't deserve 245 rupees, taste is good but not some thing extra ordinary sir...

Very average ambience and the food was very gross. Had fish tempura in beer can. It ws sooo oily and tasted blank. The electric blue cocktail was so bad. The cocktail had such bad blue colour that it stayed on my tongue and lips for the whole day. Staffs are very slow in response. Half the time they keep staring at god knows what. Went there during pujas reading good reviews but i was extremely disappointed.

Went to this place during pujas for having some quick starters for the lunch. 
Had an amazing experience with some amazing starters from the menu.
Located in Ballygaunge. This place offers for some classy stuff. Starting from the starters to the desserts.
Ordered for some Pan Fried chilly fish.. Amazing taste.I could recommend it for all the hungry spicy foodies. I liked it more than the rest though. Was served on a white plate. The quantity was good for a bunch of 2to 3. 

Next came the green pepper chicken . By the name it sounds for some greenish in colour but i must say its having the green colour because of the green capsicums and the green chilies. I specifically prefer spicy than anything else. So it was my type of food .

Another special dish from this place is Dajaj Charmoula . chicken leg piece served in one leg piece in one small cup kinda of bowl. The dip was amazing. Mayonnaise and cheesy cream.

Also try out their beer can Tempura Fish . It has got beer in their batter and tastes fresh and crispy. Recommended dish and one of the specialty of this place. 

Though we didn't had out our main course because we couldn't have walk miles for pandel hopping after that. But the starters were awesome and every single one is a recommended one. 
Had an amazing experience.  Never thought the starting of the pujas could have some amazing starters to offer us in bonus!

Absolutely brilliant! The fact that they serve authentic Continental as well as Asian dishes gives you the opportunity to enjoy the best of both worlds. Do try beer batter fish and coq au vin. The cocktails, however, aren't worth the price.

So, We walked in to try this awesome place one fine Thursday afternoon. It was actually an impromptu plan, do most of us had already have our lunch. So, what we went there for was Thier Awesome pack of starters and desserts. 

Once you enter this place, it would seem a bit cramped up but mind you - "What eyes see is Not always true or right". I think you have got my point. Decor and Interiors were excellent and classy. One would feel absolutely comfortable to sit here and try all the dishes they have to offer through the whole day. The staffs and the owner were one of the finest and courteous people I have met so far in Kolkata. 

Now, coming to the food. As already mentioned, we were here for their absolutely and mouth smacking gems of starter. We ordered:

Dajaj- 5/5 (Awesome and unique style of serving, I must say)
Lymwn Samak - 5/5
Beer Can Tempura Fish - 5/5 (One dish you should always try at this place ‚ù§)
MURG Zarka Tikka ( Red) - 5/5
MURG Kothmiri Kebab ( Green ) - 5/5
MURG Reshmi Mslai ( White) - 5/5
Green Chilly Chicken - 5/5 (First time in life tasted something that awesome)
PAN Fried Chilly Fish - 5/5

Monte Carlo (Ice Cram) - 5/5 (If there was an option for 7/5, this would get selected for the same for sure). 

Overall the whole "Food-Comfort-Courtesy" (FCC) Trio was just second to none. Would highly recommend this place to everyone in and around the town. Will surely visit this place again with family.

The long wait ends here...was it really worth it? You are about to know..
The moment I entered this restaurant I liked it...the ambiance was really good..perfect for couple hangouts, even friends...I cannot raise question on that...but my dissatisfaction started afterwards..
First of all, the place was not serving alcohol that day I have visited, which was a big turn down for me. I went to taste their specialty Bacardi infused tandoor chicken. But anyway convinced myself to go with it. 
Ordered food - dajaj charmoula, some bhetki delicacy (which was their pujo special) and finally chilli garlic mixed noodles

Taste - dajaj charmoula was nothing but tandoori chicken. But I highly appreciate their idea of presenting the food. It was really nice. It definitely has an appeal to it. And the taste was average. If you are big fan of tandoori dishes like me, you would find it gullible, not something you have not eaten anywhere. 
But I would not spend 245 for just 4 pieces of tandoori chicken. Would you? It just not worth it. 

Coming to the bhetki delicacy, it only 6 small pieces of fish wrapped it some spices. It was like paturi (Bengali people know what I mean). But the only difference was it was cooked it yogurt and some really good spices. Undoubtedly, it was mouth watering. But the quantity was not good as well aa not worth the money (again). 
Now our final dish chilli garlic noodles. If you ask me about the taste, I would say, I was good, was not exceptional for what you would pay another visit to this place. However, it was more or less sufficient for two of us. But one thing I would like to mention, the noodles can be eaten alone, you don't need gravy. On the top of it, I was hungry. So it was enough for me. 

My final words would be if you want food worth your money, this place will not an ideal restaurant for you. On the other hand, if you are just going for taste, you would find comfort here. And this place is little overhyped.

We went here on 30th September 2017 for a family get-together. Your starter was really good, but that good feeling was not there during the main course. And also service quality is not uniform, as few starter came within 5 minutes of our and balance came after 20mintues. And main course came after 30 mintues of ordering and quality of few items e.g. chicken strongaoff is not up to the expectation. Please improve on the service quality and main course dishes.

Tempted by their reviews and amazing fusion of food .This place was always in my bucket list since a long time and I and my family decided to give it a visit just after Pujo got over. They were still having the special Pujo menu so we decided to try a dish called Kuler Achar Infused Murgir Temperado . Trust me it was the best dish we tried that day and it's sad it was their special addition for Pujo .Then we had Beer Can Tempura Fish as starters and Shepherd's Pie and Coq Au Vin.Both the dishes were amazing on it's own and the taste devoured our taste buds well. A must try is Lobster Thermidor where they infuse the Lobster in an amazing way and present to you .We had some refreshing cocktails like the Rainbow Cocktail , Cock a Pita .The only saddest thing is we missed the desserts for the day as due to Pujo they weren't available.If the owner of the restaurant is reading this hat's off to you for your amazing initiative

First of all sorry for late upload 
I had a long desire to visit this place since this is the only place i able to found on zomato rated 4.9 other than barbeque nations .Moreover the reviews are also quiet beguiling

I have visited this place last friday (Nabami). Its located just a 2 min walk from ballygaunge phari
Being it special days of  durga puja there was a long queue and we were told to wait for 2 and half hours ..we all were disappointed  to miss such an oppurtunity but fortunately manager managed a seat for us within  an half hour.Coming to manager is really very cooperative and one of the best manager i have mate till date 

Now comming to the food 

We were first time there .I knew about their speciality  dajaj charmoula and tempura fish in beer can but glancing at such  a challant menu card it is quiet difficult to order in an unswerving manner 

so we take the  suggestion of the waiters and once again they are also very freindly and cooperative 

Starters 
Dajaj Charmoula : The chicken was well grilled and very much tasty but  i couldn't find  anything to be special in that except the way it was presented in china clay pots .

Tempura Fish in Beer Can : Aha heres begin the magic as if spice kraft ask their spice witch to swoop her magic wand  .Deep fried bhetki with a batter of berdwiser is just heavenly to taste .The way it was presented was also very innovative ,the fries were served in a bedwiser can .

Lymwn Samak : Corriander lemon flavoured grilled fish is just perfectly grilled .

Pork Ribs bhrewwh kebabs : No cake is complete without its cherry on top same thing goes for this dish for our nabami night dinner .Its was served with chocolated wine sauce .The meat was perfectly roasted and very juicy ..the sauce drenched to core inside the ribs 

Fish Malaikari : It was a puja special dish nothing exceptional about it .I dont think its worthy to pay 275 bucks for such a dish 


We were not much aware of cocktails and mocktails too .In this case also suggestions were perfect as before. We ordered
Jet fuel(Beer Base)
Vaporizer (whisky base)
Action 2000(Tequilla base)
Kokum Rita (Mocktail)

Ps: Price was a bit hight specially for the drinks .
       But to have such authentic dishes it is worthy to    pay .Hence if you want to have a dinner of extravagant  scale with mouth full of uniqueness ..Then my freind Spice Kraft will be the perfect choice

The food was awesome.Must try Kuler achar infused chicken temporando .Its a puja special dish but Spicekraft should consider it in making a permanent menu.The staff were friendly and give us good suggestion regarding good choice.The shepherds pie  and con-au-wu was lovely .The thermidore lobster was mouth watering.The beer can tempura fish was also good.Last but not the least the mocktails were very tasty.I have to say the ppresentation Anf garnishing of the dishes make the dishes more attractive and eye catching. Missed the boozerts ,hope to visit soon.

Awesome food quality, great ambience and remarkable presentation and fusion of food. The continental dishes as well as the starters are equally great in taste. Unfortunately can't have any desert due to "Puja", wish to visit here again to have cocktails and deserts.

After being recommended by friends,went to this place during puja. We were Initially told the waiting time would be around 1hr which dragged to 3hrs and to top that very offensive behaviour of the gate-man. Was very irrate when we finally entered. Ended up ordering from their puja special menu. Forgot the names of 2 of the puja-special starters. Apart from tht, ordered Shepherd's pie,devilled crab,fish tempura and halka noodles. All the starters tasted super awesome....I literally forgot the pain of waiting 3hrs nd the misbehavior of the watchmans. Absolutely wonderfull and awesome. Definitely worth a visit. Would highly recommend. If the management is reading,please train your staff to be a bit more courteous. Had a chat with the chef/owner only to thank him for the awesome food....!!! See you soon!!!

So this Puja's was special to me in many ways but Spicekraft made it more by their mouth watering delicacies so fresh and full of flavour in this frenzy footfall heavily overloaded and people queuing up for hours. So me and my friend managed to get us a table for two somehow after an hour of waiting time, so this place has a very nice ambience with all the beautiful decorations the tables perfectly set with a bunch of very friendly staff.¬†
Ordered : Dajaj Charmoula, Beer Can Tempura , Green Chilly Chicken And Murg Zarka Tikka.
And of course partnered with a couple of drinks to regain and keep up the high spirits of the festive season.
All this ended on a very sweet note with the dessert which was like the icing on the cake. They just outdid themselves.¬†
Verdict : An hour of waiting was all "Worth It" . Must try !

Reading the reviews on Zomato, we decided to drop by Spice Kraft for a dinner plan. And, guess what? It was a right decision to choose this place.

Beautifully decorated, this place impressed us the moment we entered. We ordered Dajaj Charmoula, Beer Can Tempura Fish and Fish-En-Papillote as starters. Dajaj Charmoula, being their signature dish, truly impressed us. We also ordered two mocktails called Pain Killer and Liquid Bomb. I just loved the Liquid Bomb. As main course dishes we placed the order for Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Prawn in Corriander Sauce, and Murg Reshmi Malai. Each dish was so delicious that we couldn't stop ordering different dishes. Finally, we ended with 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut and Beyond Fried Ice Cream.

It's a must visit place for all foodies. Do try out their signature dishes, especially the starters.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Was here to taste the lovely starters of this place.

Food - There is a variety of cuisines from all over the world. Some of the signature dishes tried were dajaj chermoula, the best of spice kraft (the soft and juicy chicken and mild spice over will make you order a second plate). The Pan fried chilly fish here is so perfect. Lymwn samak is another favourite of mine (slight lemon flavour and the soft fish is really worth trying). Other dishes tried were beer can tempura fish, murg zarka tikka, murg kothmiri kebab, murg reshmi malai, green chilly chicken. And all the dishes were perfect from all aspects. 

Ambience - A nice place to visit with family and friends. Nicely decorated.

Staff - All the attendants are so well mannered. 

Rate - Appropriate

One word: Overrated.
I had been warned beforehand about the nonchalant and lax behaviour of the staff but I was also told that the food was great.
The food, alas, was quite average.
Even the signature dishes aren't all that (as other reviews suggested and I blindly believed). Basically the food is okay, but I wasn't expecting 'okay' with a rating like 4.9
My bad.

Absolutely loved this place. The ambiance is great. Very efficient and swift service. The food is delicious but the portions can only serve one, so it becomes a little pricey. The cocktails are to die for. I would definitely recommend for an indulgent treat. 
PS. Try the pork ribs with jalape√±o and tamarind sauce. It took me to food coma.

This restaurant was on my wishlist for quite a long time. The place was full on a friday evening but fortunately we managed to get a table. The first thing which struck me was the ambiance. The decor was beautiful and the lighting was dim. Now coming to the food we ordered their signature starters Dajaj charmoula and Beer Battered Tempura Fish..For the main course we had Chilly garlic noodles, Moon Fan rice with Hunan Chicken. And lastly for the dessert we ordered Jack Daniels's Mousse.
*Dajaj Charmoula: It had four pieces of roasted chicken legs marinated with chermoula spices served  in an earthen pot. The leg pieces were juicy and very tender with right amount of spices. It tasted incredible however we felt that the sizes could have been bigger.
*Tempura fish: This one I really liked. Served in a beer can the fish was soft with crunchy outside. However what stole the show was the orange tartare dip. It nicely complemented with the fish.
*chilly garlic noodles: the taste was alright, nothing exceptional. The dish was served a bit cold which was a minus point.
*Moon Fan Rice: the dish was fantastic. It had perfect balance of the spices with considerable amount of chicken and mushroom and had a nice fragnance. The quantity was enough for one person but not two.
*Hunan Chicken: the chicken pieces was very soft. It just melts in your mouth. Really impressed with this one.
*Jack Daniel's Mousse: This was just my favourite. No words for this one. It tasted heavenly. I can just come back here only to have this again and again.
Overall a great experience.. The hospitality was great. The manager and chef were very attentive to their guests, explaining every dishes while serving. Highly recommended place.

This place has become quite popular within a short 
span and rightly so! Also its easy to find location is a bonus--just opposite to hazra law college
Ambience-- very classy!
Food-- I've been here two times. The first time we mainly had continental-- beer can tempura fish, devilled crab, noodles and a 100% Jack Daniels boozert (that's right booze plus dessert!) along with sangria (a red wine cocktail)
On our second visit we ordered mainly Indian dishes like amritsari macchi, rarha gosht, biriyani besides their famous dajaj charmoula.
The quality of the food is extremely good right from the presentation and quantity to taste. I loved all the items we had.
Staff-- very courteous and warm.  Chef sambit (who is also the owner I suppose) personally came and asked us if the food was good and if we had any problems!
Pocket pinch-- around 1500 for two including alcohol.
Overall-- what I liked the most about this place is that it's a top ranked restaurant with very affordable pricing which is very rare in the city. Would love to visit again!
P.s-- sorry for not giving pics of all the dishes..both times I went straight from the hospital after work and was too famished to take any pictureüò•

Our tummies craved for some starters. And this place was on the list. Of all the items we had, murg reshmi malai stuck with me and dajaj chermoula. Ohh yeah and the green chilly chicken was the shocker of the day. It was green but not mean. The service is top notch and the interiors are sexy. Dropping coins in my piggy bank to visit again.

Tried several signature starters and dessert at the spice Kraft. The starters like lemon fish , green chilli chicken and the beer batter fish were lip smacking and tender. Spice Kraft has a wide range of starters and main course to offer , each of it being unique and tasty. The service is top class ,and the owner himself is warm and welcoming to the guests. Overall if you want to have some creative top notch dishes then the spice Kraft is a must visit.

We ordered Drums of heaven and Beer Can Tempura fish: best dishes of this restaurant. Pan fried noodles was unavailable, hence we settled for mixed Hakka noodles and chicken in chilli oyster sauce. Both dishes were good, but the quantity of noodles was lesser than usual. The place was a bit overcrowded, but ambience was nice. Overall experience: 
Food: 4/5

Seeing their ratings we were impressed quite enough to visit the place. Choosing kinda wrong day to visit, we were a bit tensed. We went there on Ashtami Evening with a waiting time of around 2hrs. We expected that the food might just be below standard due to the huge crowd, but to my utter surprise the food was top notch with very warm behavior of the staffs and also the Owner cum head chef.
We tried Beer battered tempura fish, It is a must have, with the pleasant and aesthetic style of serving it in a beer can, but however the sauce along with it was too sweet and according to me it wasn't adding to the flavors. Up next was Roasted Chilli Pork, a classic, soft tender pork shreds tossed to perfection. After that we tried Murgh Reshmi Malai, the malai was on the sweeter side and the sweetness was somehow killing the taste of Reshmi Kebab. Otherwise it was tender, succulent pieces of chicken tasted to perfection. Last starter on our pallette was Soy infused drums of heaven, chicken lollipops tossed in soya gravy, it was good, on the sweeter side but it was going well.
For main course we tried Murgh Da Mokul, a punjabi delicacy, along with laccha paratha and butter tandoori roti. All of them were as perfect as possible. Their way of serving the food for sure takes their food to another verge.
For cocktails we tried one Orange sage which was the classic Screwdriver, it was well punched to perfection. Second we tried was Manhattan, the cocktail with Jim Beam, one of the best cocktails i ever had. Third was something Hazelnut punched with smirnoff, it was awestruck, it looked very appealing as well.
All in all Spice kraft is a place where they focus on customer satisfaction to the utmost level. Their way of serving food is definitely innovative, kudos to the team for that. Lastly it's really pocket friendly, with such service the price in comparison is pretty much less.
Will definitely visit this place again.

Very conveniently located at Hazra road, it's an easy dining destination for most.
We tried cucumber lemonade, a new mocktail which was really good n unique.
In starters prawn with coriander sauce, and bhetki cooked with light masala was also a delight, as it was in the genre of our very own "bhetki paturi". 
We also tried oyster chicken, some spl fried rice which was not great although, but good. 
Overall it was a nice experience, also not too heavy on pocket.

This is the 2nd time I went to Spice Kraft and the experience somehow made me post a review on Zomato. Spice Kraft is one of those restaurants which deserve to get complimented in various ways. The way this place has hooked me up it'll surely turn out to be a regular food destination from now on.
Dajaj Chermoula , Beer can tempura fish are few of the must tries of this place. Spice Kraft doesn't only fill your stomach, it fills your heart as well.

Well this place has created a buzz among foodies in kolkata, and the buzz is justified to some extent i must say! 
So we went there to celebrate a special day of ours, and the ambience was perfect, for a romantic date. We sat in the inner portion of the restaurant which had dim lights, and there service was also good, no complains! 
So coming to the food we had
The most ordered Dajaj Charmoula, and was a perfect starter, made with utmost care! Loved the dish. 
Next we had Khor Khog, a Korean lamb dish, it was tasty. 
Next came the Devil's Crab, and I loved this one! Crab meat scooped out, cooked in cheese,every spoon of this stole my heart!
Next we had another highly ordered dish, the beer can tempura, the orange dip was fantastic, but the amount of oil on the fish was a bit problematic, if the oilyness is reduced, then this would have been a perfect dish! 
Also for mocktails a cucumber cooler mocktail was suggested by the waiter, and it was kind of okayish, and the virgin mojito wasnt top notch, I think non alcoholics must choose there drinks carefully over here. But the food, service, and ambience was really great!

This place is an aesthetic delight. Whether it is food, ambience or service, the management is always keen to keep a close eye at quality control here.
It will be a sacrilege not to please the gourmet in you with Beer Can Tempura Fish, to start with. Butter-fried fish crafted to perfect crisp gets a twist here with the magic ingredient of beer batter thrown in. The presentation of this dish will surely greet you with a pleasant surprise. Allow yourself a mug of chilled beer to escort you to sheer delight.
Stimulate your senses next with the Lebanon preparation of Dajaj Charmoula wherein charcoal grilled marinated meat will leave you asking for more. This dish will remind you of distant monsoons spent at forest Dakbunglows, so reminiscent of the call of the wild.
If you are looking out for carbs now, you may not like to miss the Indonesian Rice, Nasi Goreng. This mistress of spices will remind you of first love's sting and take it down straight, the heat will linger on for long, undoubtedly.
Spicy Orange Peel Chicken strikes the right balance with it. The chef here uses an assimilated orange paste instead of dried peels, only to intensify the grace that this will bestow on your palate. The sweet and spicy tender meat pieces are lip-smacking delicious. 
Just a word of advice. The new heights of popularity that this place has won in recent times leaves it bustling with crowd, mostly. So make sure you work out your plan to drop in accordingly.

Located on Hazra Road near Ballygunge Phari Petrol Pump ,this place is an eye catcher 
and you can spot it from the main road itself .The place is nicely decorated with 
tiny lights and the ambience is niche and good. 

What I Ordered -

1.BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH - The fish battered in beer and tempura sauce adds a tingy 
flavour. Its crispy .

2.DAJAJ CHARMOULA - A must try dish from this place. The chicken legs are spiced up
by the marination and the creamy suace adds another flavour to this dish

3.FISH-EN-PAPILLOTE - The fish  is cooked inside a parchment paper originally served with 
  asparagus. A must try dish 

4.LYMWN SAMAK - Soft  fish cooked in lebanese spices added a new tasted to my tastebuds.
  Do try 

5.MIXED FRIED RICE - The quality of the rice and the veggies and prawns,chicken and eggs
 was too good in taste. 

6.MIXED HAKKA NOODLES - The noodles were amazing , and to compliment the dish , I had it 
with chicken in masaman curry. 

7.CHICKEN IN MASAMAN CURRY - Fried in cocunut cream ,with potatoes ,onions,the chicken
is usually eaten with rice or noodles.

8.MURG RESHMI MALAI - The chicken reshmi kebab with malai as the topping will make you
forget other dishes of chicken. Do try.

9.THE TERMINATOR - This is a cocktail made out of beer and whiskey and will keep you
trippy for quite sometime. Do try .

10.LIQUID BOMB - Another coctail made out of rum, vodka ,blended to give an awesome
taste 

11.PAINKILLER-Cocunut ,pineapple,orange and rum blended to make this cocktail another
painkiller to kill your pain. Haha, do try 

12.BEYOND FRIED ICECREAM -The outer surface is crispy while the inner surface is soft,
gooey and cold . A must try dessert .

13.100% JACK DANIELS & BARRY CALLEBAUT - The superstar dessert from SpiceKraft .The 
chocolate mousse is very smooth and the drunken petit creates a blend  infused in 
jack daniels whiskey .This is the perfect end to your meal 

Overall a memorable dining experience, courteous staff , this place is the hot stuff 
in town. Do visit .

Had to rate it 5. I have been there once but wish to try out all full menu. Loved this place - be it the service, the ambience, the food quality or the the presentation of the food.Though all the food served were delicious yet I will recommend shepherd's pie. It's probably the best thing I ate in a while.

This place had been in my wishlist since a long time due to the high ratings and recommendations from known people. So finally this week I decided to drop by. 
The interiors were beautiful. Soft music was being played which went well with the ambience.

Coming to the food, we ordered the signature dish Dajaj Charmoula which had the perfect smoky texture and taste. We also had the beer can tempura fish which consists of soft fillets of fish batter fried and served in a beer can. Then we had two fish items : Lymn Samak and Fish en papillote.These two were my favorite out of all the starters. The fish was so soft, delicious and melted in the mouth. Next we had the murgh reshmi malai which again was delicious. 

I also had a cocktail called pain killer which was vodka based and I really loved it. 

In main course, we ordered mixed fried rice, mixed hakka noodles , prawn in coriander sauce and chicken in masaban curry. The rice and noodles were ample in quantity and tasted good. The chicken and prawn were tender and tasted great. 

Last but not the least we ordered two items in desert : beyond fried ice cream and 100% jack Daniel's and Barry Callebout. The latter had sponge cakes which are to be eaten with alcohol infused chocolate mousse(it was as amazing as it sounds!) . I loved both these items and you should absolutely not miss having desert over here! 

I am so glad I went there because Spice kraft is absolutely worth the hype! Hoping to visit again soon.

This place is very near to Ballygunge phari petrol pump. A 3mins walk in the lane and you are there.
To start with, the restaurant is nicely decorated with blue lights. There are plenty of space inside.
The crowd and ambience is mentionable.
The food was obviously great. So was the service and behaviour of the waitors.
Quantity wise the chowmein and fried rice mains can be a bit more but taste wise it was outstanding.
Coming to the drinks, the cocktails were very delicately made and was superb in taste.
I would definitely visit this place again.

This is the only restaurant where I experienced a homely atmosphere and enjoyed it totally.
Manager and staffs behaved with a warmth that I never witnessed in any restaurant so far.
Specifically I should mention our host (manager f&b) Mr. Vimal Nag. I must thank him and other servers for so much positive attitude.

Now let's talk about food.
I personally prefer one should ask the table attenders about their specialty. I did it here too. And they decided a very good course of meal for us.
Foods were delicious and well decorated.
After a long time I have tasted such a finger licking good food. I must thank chef for so wonderful creations.

They serve a limited variety of alcohol in puja but it's ok. They have a combo of premium whiskey one should try that.

As a whole it's a 5 star experience.
I shall return to this place very soon.

First of all, this review should have been here months ago when I visited them for the first time during Valentines Day 2017. However my clumsiness and other commitments kept me busy enough to write the words of praises for this absolute gem of a place in the heart of the city. However, better late than never, here it goes... Let us begin with a dash of negativity. On both the occasions we had to wait for a considerable amount of time before getting our tables. On the last instant, on Saptami this Durga Puja, we had to wait for more than a couple of hours which compelled us to be on our wit's end and we completly lost our desire and appetite for a hearty meal. But then magic struck us, once again, like it did on our previous rendezvous. Spice Kraft has the ability to sweep you off your feet with their delectable spread of innovative cuisine and out of the world service. Each of the dishes that we ordered were pure indulgence, be it the Beer Battered Tempura Fish (The best continental fish preparation I had in the city, EVER) or the Devilled Crab (yummilicious with cheese filling) or The Dajaj Charmoula (char-grilled to perfection). Not to mention their innovative cocktails ranging from Long Island Iced Tea, Kokumrita, Litchitini et all. Full points for the sheer awsomeness delivered with every sip. In the mains we tried noodles, green pepper chicken and Wellington Fish which again gave away no points for complaint. All in all, by the time we left, the agony of standing in the que were far behind us. The staff are courteous and patient, and we are planning a re-visit very soon provided they remember us and consider us for a special deal on our meals next time, Ha Ha! (Point to be noted üòú).
You guys have really put together an awesome set-up and a destination worth visiting a several times. 1/2 the points are being taken off for the lack of better crowd and que management. Otherwise, charm on Spice Kraft. More power and more awesomeness to you üëçüëçüëç
Shine on...

1st time I went here on an afternoon with friends ,attracted by¬† the recently achieved legendary status of their¬† cocktails , i was overwhelmed by the HITMAN and the Z-Fuel.... along with an apt ambience............. simply i loved it , .............HIT man¬† ¬† ¬† hit me quite hard ,so i decided to give another try with a dear friend and fellow(occasional) boozer to try out some more cocktails out their......alas it was a crowded evening and the cocktails we ordered (especially- Z-fuel) was a real dud,the apparatus was leaking and it tasted like a sour lemon juice syrup, upon complaining it was taken back diluted with water and reserved........alas the mood was offf the tastebuds were sedated.................so i decided to turn back to the trusted all weather friend-THE HITMAN............and thankfully it made us forget the bitter experience.
pros-¬† cocktails ,cocktails ,...try the out of menu cocktails.
cons- food served tastes average, well garnished and presented but they should really give a serious thought about improving the quantity they serve .

highly recommended only for its cocktail ( personally had 1 bad experience but that can b a bad coincidence).

The only reason i am giving 4.5 star is because we went there in choturthi and not everything from their traditional menu were present.. infact they had a special menu with not too many choices(not even a desertüôÅ) .. and what was more disappointing they didn't have any beer for the evening.. except this everything is more than fine.. be it courteous staffs or food quality or ambience.. and i think u know what's their special dish(common part in all the reviews)

The ambience was good and it was not  that crowded. But the problem with them was their seating arrangements. The tables are placed so close that it hampers your privacy.. The mother and daughter duo sat just next to our table was people with no brain I think! They didn't have anything to talk about and they were constantly staring at us when we were clicking pictures and we were served our drinks! Even one of my friends heard that they are giving a bunch of excuses to the waiter because of the fact that they are ordering only a plate desert and nothing more.. So when these creepy persons are around, life is miserable at spice kraft! 
Now coming to the food and ambience.. 
Ambience is good.. 
Their Kolkata betki preparations are mind-blowing. We just loved the baked fish, grilled fish.. But the chicken stoganoff is not something to order for. 
We ordered long island ice tea.. And it was extremely good.. The smoothness made us crazy.. We loved it.

Awesome place.First of all it is just beside Hajra Main road so quite easy to locate.The ambience of the restaurant is also nice & cozy.
We went there on 23.09.2017 to celebrate HIS birthday.I had booked a table and previously ordered and the staffs helped me a lot by their valuable suggestions, specially Cocktails(as I am non-alchoholic).
I ordered Cucumber cooler which is mouth watering and highly refreshing.Just loved it.Next we had Shepherd's Pie which is also delicious.Then we had Sangria, Devil's Crab Meat, Manhattan,Lamb Masman curry,rice(sorry I forgot the exact name)& jack Daniel moose.Loved all of it.
Thank you for helping me for setting the menu & give us a good time.
Surely will visit again and would love to explore the menu card more.

Gone for the first time and the first impression was fantastic. Decoration is quite good. Staffs are cordial and very well mannered. In starter we order dajaj chermoula (a Lebanese chicken dish) and pan fried chilli fish. First one was good. But pan fried chilli fish was so good that we ordered two more again. In main course we ordered pan fried Cantonese noodles and this time also the taste made us to order one more. Mixed fried rice was good and in side dish we ordered soya chilly chicken but I didn't like that flavour. It's not the traditional taste of chilly chicken a different type of taste. But overall a huge satisfaction. Worthy for visit again. üòãüòã

Had a long desire to visit this place since i have heard only good words about this place . Also the amazing reviews and ratings dragged me there . Went there yesterday with a friend for lunch . The decor was good ,good music and the menu card definitely deserves a mention for being unique . However a group of  6 people were there who were quite loud which was definitely a turn off because a romantic collection restaurant should be quite with soft music , the music was soft except the people Well now coming to the food , we definitely ordered for their famous dish  
1 -tempura fish in beer can ( which tasted good but the sauce was too sweet for the dish ) 4/5 
 2- chicken stroganoff (which tasted okayish not at all amazing ) 2.5/5 
 3 -  100% jack daniel's mousse ( this tasted good how ever we couldn't figure out which had the alcohol üëÖ the sponge cake or the chocolate mousse. ) 4/5

 After seeing their ratings we have had high hopes but this was definitely a bit disappointing . This place only has innovative names with not so innovative tasteüò≠  but would hopefully go back to try their other dishes and cocktails.

Obviously the best restaurant anyone can think of.
 The ambience, the decor, the hospitality is all set up with their exotic food items.
 Be it continental or Indian , the flavour of every dish is damn good.
  U see the beer bottle and the way chicken tikka is served ??? That's the innovation.
 Added to my list of top rated priority.

Visited this eatery the third time because of the good experiences the first couple of times. Was very disappointed. The food was ok but the ambience and service were rather disappointing. We were there for lunch. A rather unpleasant smell greeted us on our arrival, the staff did spray some room freshner but it failed to mask the unfavourable musty smell. Still we decided to settle down. The music was rather Loud and when we requested for the volume to be lowered one member of the service staff said it cannot be lowered. I totally agree with the concept of slow food but their's was at snail piace. To top it all the table was not cleaned, the surface was sticky and the staff kept the cutlery straight on the table. If you are doing away with the concept of using table linen the least one can do is have the dining surface spotless and not sticky. Now for the food , the chermoula was good. The sauce in the penne arabiata was thick and it came cold on the table. It's sad to see such decline in standards.

Honestly, i have heard so much about the restaurant that i finally paid a visit to this place. I went for a quick afternoon lunch however the experience was awesome. The decor was amazing and i quite liked the way the glasses were kept on the table. The menu card was innovative, the design was fresh (not like the boring stereotype ones). The food is extremely nice, and the presentation just makes it perfect. I had ordered a chicken starter which was presented in a wrapped paper on a plate, something i came across for the first time. The chicken was fried perfectly and had a nice texture. I quite liked the Schezwan Chicken and the fried rice. The best part about the chicken was the perfect blend of spices which made it not too spicy, not too sweet. I would be looking to visiting your restaurant soon with some more time in my hand. An amazing experience!!

This was my second visit to Spice Kraft and it was once again a grand session of gastronomical fulfilment. We started with the Beer Can Tempura Fish which they make with bhetki, the Dajaj Chermoula - a chicken kebab with an amazing curd dip, the Bacardi Limon infused tandoori chicken sausages. Their dips are to die for. For the mains, we ordered their amazing Chicken Cog Au Vin but I thought the Italian seasoning could have been a bit less. We also ordered the Baked Fish which was great and a Devilled Crab which was well made but the pepper in the filling was a little overpowering. Their drinks are one of the best accomplices to their food. We got Mojitos (and even their virgin one is delicious) and the one to look out for was the sparkling wine and peach schnapps Bellini! The dessert that we were waiting through the whole meal for is their Jack Daniels Mousse which comes with the perfect mousse texture ever and their house made sponge cakes and and orange sauce reduction! 
Overall, their service is always quite well but I wish they would improve the lighting of the decor in the inside rooms.

Visited just twice although it is located very nearby our home. This restaurant is undoubtedly one of the most economic restaurant with unique and excellent food. For starters, we had Beer can Tempura Fish and Daraj Charmoula, the latter one is better. Then in the continental dishes, we tried Coq Au Vin and Baked Fish Wellington. The taste is awesome and I did not have anything like that before, which made it unique. In the dessert, Jack Daniels Mousse is worth trying for.

This restaurant is located near to the hazra law college...This place doesn't need much of an introduction as the name says it all...I visited here 3 times...The more I go there, the more I crave for the food they serve...its an experimental food they serve which is 'molecular gastronomy'...the ambience is good...the inside is dim lit and elegant and aristocrat! Every dish or drink or dessert I had here was just amazing! And the way of decorating and presenting the dishes are worth mentioning
For starters I've had
¬∞ Dajaj Charmoula, which is one of their best served starters..chicken legs marinated with spices and smoked! Served in a pot which had a piece of cucumber and root..It looks big but it isn't actually!
¬∞Shish Touk, it's a creamy chicken which is cooked along with herbs...such a creamy and guuei dish..A person like me who's a cream and cheese liver it's just heaven!

Drinks,
¬∞ Pinacolada version 2050- the chef recommended this drink when I visited there for the first time...It has this creamy soft balls which bursts with bits of pineapple in mouth..its just awesome!
¬∞Kool cucumber, this is a refreshing drink and had bits of cucumber on the top...The cherry in the cake was the cucumber piece on tha glass..perfect for summer days
¬∞Sula shiraz, red wine..I tasted wine for the first time and it was good

Main course
¬∞ cheese naan, aa I earlier mention that I'm a cheese lover so this..anybody can have this alone itself..its just yumm
¬∞laal maas, mutton cooked with spices and a perfwct gravy, a rajasthani dish...I loved this

Dessert
¬∞jack daniel mouse cake, many people recommended me this..and it was worth trying

Visit again will I? Yes ofcourse! ‚ù§
Next time I must try the continental dishes
And people, go visit this place ‚ò∫

First of all to reach here take a auto from jatin das park metro as the location might be a concern for them who does not know the place like me. Now coming to the point ambience 4.5/5, food 4.5/5 and service 5/5
The restaurant has a very beautiful and classy look and decor with nice music.
Service is pretty fast with very helpful staffs.
Coming to the food. I tried signature dish charmouli and beer can tempura fish. The fish didn't amaze me at all but charmouli was great. The fish was very delicate and soft and had very good taste but didn't have any point of having this big name. Its just a very good fish butter fry without any bone, that's it. A staff out there recommended a nice cocktail of minced cucumber with hint of lemon and it was great. In main course we ordered nasi goreng and hunan fish. The fried rice was enough for two people and the chicken went very good with the spicy rice. Overall a very good experience and would like to visit again to try other dish and cocktails.

Went there on 15th September. Seeing the rating on Zomato, we had high expectations for this place.

We had ordered Choco Beams, Sangria for drinks, and Bacardi Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausage as starters.

The drinks were delicious, special mention goes to the Choco Beam for being the most simple yet ingenious cocktail ever. The tandoori sausage was good as well. The dipping however, was too sweet for the dish.

Next came Coq-au-vin, Devilled Crab and Nagori Lahsooni Tangri and as our main courses. The problem with expecting too much is that you tend to search for variation in taste. However good cuisine can also mean more refinement to the same taste you have been having for a long time. Having said this, the Tangri and the Coq-Au-Vin felt very blande against the premium, and also felt very familiar to taste.

The crab on the other hand was creamy and amazing to taste. If I go a second time, I'll have the crab on a priority.

Will I go again? Probably.

Totally in love with this place. Had a long desire to visit this place but didn't have any idea that it would turn out to be one of the best places I've recently visited. Amazing ambience, great food, good atmosphere, bit badly lit so couldn't click too many pictures. It's not overpriced at all. The taste of each and every dish totally does justice to the place. The staffs were well behaved but there was lack of proper management because of less waiters, however the food makes us forget everything. 

First we ordered "Dajaj Chermoula" which is a starter containing four chicken legs marinated with spices and grilled served with a creamy sauce. It was outstanding. Secondly we ordered another starter called "Lymwn Samak". Uploading a picture of it. 

Finally we ordered a "Chicken Stoganoff" & "Baked Fish Wellington". 

Spice Kraft is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by me

Visited this place today during lunch time. A little disappointed after hearing all the good reviews and such a huge rating. We have ordered their speciality dajaj charmoula, beer can tempura fish and fried ice cream. But the sad part was one of the waiter forced us to eat tempura fish with the orange tartare they provided by serving the tartare in our plates without even asking and telling us to eat the fish with tartare only. It was on the sweeter side and we were not liking it with the crunchy fish we were eating. Without the tartare fish was good, fresh and so is the fried ice cream. Dajaj charmoula tasted a little different than any regular tandoor but the way of presenting is little deceiving.  Whenever the pot comes with chicken inside you are more than happy with the size of leg piece but discovered a slice of cucumber and beet root is there to accompany ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Anyway it has a nice ambience and worth a try.

At the very beginning of my review I would like to give a disclaimer that some of the pictures accompanying my review may not be very clear as the restaurant's lighting is quite dim (which, btw adds to the peaceful ambience) and should not be used to judge the taste of the food served.
Spicekraft has been in my wishlisy for quite some time now as I had heard a lot of praises about it.
To put it bluntly, it did not disappoint.
The food at Spicekraft is defined by its innovativeness, its attention to detail and most importantly its amazing taste.
Went here for a dinner with two other friends and was blown away by the taste and presentation of each and every dish we ordered.
The beverage section is quite inventive with a myriad of mocktails and cocktails but I went with the tried and tested 'Long Island Iced Tea' as I was craving the punch of alcohol. It was perfectly mixed and made sure to leave the drinker with a pleasant buzz.

For starters we decided to tread the fishy path. We ordered the staple Spicekraft starter which is the 'Beer can tempura fish' and it's relatively lesser-known but equally appetising cousin the ' Lemon Semak'. The beer batter fried fish is a party in your mouth with the soft, flaky but firm fingers of fresh beckti encased in a crunchy and flavourful covering infused with high quality beer. Brownie points for presentation : the dish actually comes in a can of Budweiser. 
The lemon Semak on the other hand was all about delicate flavours. The marriage of the sourness of lemon and pungency of crushed garlic with a hint of smokiness is sure to send any food-lover to culinary heaven.
It is also mentionworthy that the whole experience of savouring these starters will be left lacking if one ignores the dips served with them. The dips served with each starter is different and is paired keeping in mind the uniqueness of each dish.

For our main course we decided to go Continental. We ordered the Shepherd's Pie (lamb) and the Lobster Thermidor.
The best part was how even though these were continental dishes notorious for their generous use of ingredients like butter, flour and cheese which tends to tire the diner's palate with blandness and bloat them with it's heaviness, the continental dishes at Spicekraft were surprisingly light. There was a perfect balance of flavour and texture.
The lamb in the Shepherd's pie was not minced but cut up in little chunks which helped to retain the robustness of the meaty flavours. The melted cheese and buttered garlic bread served as perfect accompaniments.
The lobster thermidor was a princely affair. The soft meat of the shellfish was cooked to perfection with herbs and cheese and served with light and fluffy parsley rice and perfectly seasoned steamed vegetables. 

For dessert we ordered their Fried Ice-cream and 100% Jack Daniel's mousse with drunk petit fours. Both the desserts were really creative and a welcome break from the ice-creams and brownies we are used to ordering at most places.
The fried ice-cream was a huge scoop of French Vanilla ice-cream which was fried in a batter that had coconut undertones. Me and my friends lapped it up in mere seconds. But the ultimate star of the show for me was the airy and delicate mousse infused with rich liqueur which we savoured with the light sponge cake roundels which had soaked up the alcohol.

For such an elaborate and innovative meal the bill that greeted us was quite reasonable and this is a place even students like me can afford to treat themselves at. The excellent service of all the servers who were polite enough to check on us from time to time and really patient while taking orders should also be mentioned.

I am definitely going back and would recommend this place to all food-lovers out there. This is a restaurant you JUST CANNOT afford to miss.

This place had been on my bucket list for quite a while now. I am so glad to finally visit this awesome place. The meal was fantastic.
Located opposite hazra law college the place is quite near ballygunge phari.
The ambience and the decor is amazing and the music is soothing. The service was prompt and the staff were very polite. We met the chef who cooks such heavenly dishes.
The food was simply splendid. For starters I tried out Dajaj charmoula . Four chicken leg pieces in four pots , all of them tasted fabulous. Then I had beer can tempura fish followed by Lyman samak and Shish touk.
Coming to beverages I had the Red grape and basil twister .All their cocktails might make one a little tipsy.
For the main course I had the Shepherd's pie, Chicken stroganoff, Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce, Lobster thermidor. All of these were a delight and left me craving for more.
For desert I had 100% Jack Daniels mousse . It tasted heavenly. It was followed by beyond fried ice cream which was superb as well.
This place is a must visit for all food lovers. I am certainly looking forward to my next visit.

It was a delightful experience dining here. The place is located opposite Quadra Medical near Ballygunge phari. The ambience is soothing and perfect to be with family and friends. According to me, they serve great starters and deserts. I am not a fan of their main course though. On my visits I have had :
*Starters*
Dajaj charmoula: this is their signature dish. Four chicken leg pieces served in individual pots, all of them perfectly cooked.
Beer can tempura fish: crispy coating and the fish is fresh and smooth as butter. 
Lymwn shamak: absolutely lip smacking fish starter. 
Shish taouk: a cream and chicken delicacy straight from the kitchen which tasted amazing. 

*Beverage*
Cucumber cooler: it is a mocktail which is quite light and refreshing. 
Pain killer: this cocktail is based on vodka and cranberry which tasted great. Their cocktails might make you feel a little tipsy.

*Deserts*
100% jack Daniels mousse: this is my favorite desert of all times. I cannot stop praising this. I would just keep it simple by saying this is a must have when you are in spicekraft. Recommended. 
Beyond fried ice cream : the coating is thin and it tasted good but I cannot think of any other desert much other than the former mentioned.

The presentation of food is good and the staff is well behaved. Since the lighting is a little dim the pictures are not half as good as the food that I had.

It's a really great place to sit, sip some amazing cocktails and munch great quality food. The name 'appetizers' makes complete sense because you'll definitely crave for more!!

I would recommend Kool Cucumber, Beer Can Tempura Fish, Dajaj Charmoula, Nasi Goreng, Chicken in Chilly Oyster and Mushroom, and finally end it with Beyond Fried Ice Cream.
I was extremely impressed with the ambience, especially the music that was playing, a mixture of both English and Hindi classics (instrumental) is a brilliant concept.
Cheers!!

I finally visited this place for lunch and the place was awesome. Their dishes are lovely especially the fish ones. We tried the Beer can Tempura fish and Infu Tand Chicken sausage for starters and both were delicious!! We also took Kokum rita for drinks and it was lovely. For main course we tried Nasi goreng and Hunan fish and both were lovely. Finally we had their fried ice cream for dessert which was the best amongst all the places that I have tried till now. Overall this place deserves a 5 * because the ambiance, staff and food all were great.

Spice Kraft compensated the sultry eve by its signature dish Beer Can Tampura Fish and awesome cocktails like Action 20000 and Manhattan. I just loved the dip that accompanied the Tampura Fish and the cocktails were perfect add on to the experience.
Wondering why I still rated it more than good but less than impressive? Well, there are couple of reasons. I read in Zomato that this restaurants has a breathtakingly awesome interior, very refined choice of music it plays and excels in its staff efficiency and courtesy. Sorry, but in my case I would say I expected much better. The table we were offered is very small to accommodate food and cocktails for two. The staff was a bit sarcastic while I was looking for a strong cocktail, neither he understood exactly what kind of cocktail we are looking for while my partner said that she would prefer a whisky based one. We had to figure out the best options available by interrogating him whereas it was expected that he would interrogate us and come up with a better suggestion. While serving the cocktails not only he spilled it on the table, he also interchanged my order with that of my partner and never clearly mentioned the name of the drinks. Even after spilling the drink, we had to call him to clean up the table.
Should I also add that Action 20000 is a very good cocktail but 795 rs for it, seems to me a bit more. Drinks are good but definitely overpriced depending the location of the restaurant.
In a nutshell, Spice Kraft is highly recommended but only for its food and drinks. Experience? It's a no-no!!

There are few restaurants in the City, those really need any special intro. Yes, Spice Craft belongs to that category restaurant where you can easily say ‚Äì ‚ÄòNaam hi kafi hain boss‚Äô. The restaurant was in my wish list for a long time and the dreams come true when some of my friends and I went to the restaurant to celebrate one of my friend‚Äôs birthday.

The restaurant situated Just opposite of the Hazra Law College. So not a big issue to find it out. The restaurant has a huge sitting arrangements and the interior of itz is just mind blowing. Dim lighting all over the inside adds some real mode in it.

The food we ordered ‚Äì

Drinks ‚Äì

1.	Red grape and Basil twister (5.0/5.0) ‚Äì Perfect starting of your dining experiences. Had rich heavy flavors of grape but perfect blend of basil touch makes it refreshing. Awesome as a startup drinks.

2.	Kokum Rita (4.5/5.0) ‚Äì Another refreshing drink from the chest box. Lite in nature but still super refreshing.

3.	Aampanna and Curry Patta Shikhanji (5.0/5.0) ‚Äì Ultimate twist of Shikhanji with Aampanna and curry flavor. Wild combination but drink-wise at its best.

Starter ‚Äì

1.	Dajaj Charmoula (5.0/5.0) ‚Äì This is something what I call Spice Craft special item. Four pieces chicken with char-grilled aroma served with special mayo chutney. Just love it.

2.	Beer Can Tempura Fish (5.0/5.0) ‚Äì I have tried Fish tempura a lots of time but Tempura where the batter is made of Bear is really something worthy trying. Love the softness and smell of the fish. High recommended.

3.	Lymwn Samak (3.5/5.0) ‚Äì An Arabian dish, where the fish was grilled to taste like lemon flavor. Love the concept. Served in decorative way.

Main Course & side dishes ‚Äì

1.	Nasi Goreng (4.0/5.0) ‚Äì A Indonesian dish, prepared with rice and lots of spices and little veggies. The flavor of the sauce was prominent and it goes absolutely well with any Chicken or Lamb side dish. Quantity was it is enough for two persons.

2.	Chicken Stroganoff (4.5/5.0) ‚Äì Now this Russian item is call some perfect main course. Cheesy chicken served with rice. Awesome in one word. The wine touch in the chicken is also noticeable. Love it.

3.	Shepherd‚Äôs Paw (4.0/5.0) ‚Äì This item is something like hidden chest. You will not know anything until you dig your spoon into it. Minced Lamb dish, which was covered up with cheesy mashed potato coating. The dish served with garlic bread. Love the taste and the presentation.

Desserts ‚Äì

1.	100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss (4.0/5.0) ‚Äì Soft and mouthwatering four pieces of cakes were served with chocolate mousse. The cake contains alcohol also but its taste was just perfect.

2.	Classic Monte Carlo (4.0/5.0) ‚Äì One scoop of vanilla and chocolate ice cream was served in a glass in a great manner. The chocolate sauce touch inside the glass is also awesome. Love the item.

With some awesome food, the evening was well spent a Spice Craft. Kudos to the stuffs and the management for gifting us such a wonderful evening. Overall a memorable dining experiences. Will definitely visit this restaurant again and again.

Well, happen to be a native of Kolkata and as the festive season is round the corner in the City of Joy, one has to stay right up with his or her taste game. This place is located near the Hazra Law College (more precisely near Ballygunje phari). As you enter the restaurant, you are welcomed with good music and a soulful ambience, away from the chaos of the city and bustle outside. Now, as you take a look at the menu, it‚Äôd look inviting with a varied range of dishes, starting from Pan Asian cuisine from Vietnam to Lebanese and so on. They add this surprise element while presenting drinks and call it the MOLECULAR MIXOLOGY. I requested a dajaj charmoula and bacardi limon imbued Tandoori chicken sausages, for drinks you can opt for a Milkmaid Chaitini and Smoked Pineapple Cocktail. The food plating and introduction was phenomenal with significant portion, both the dishes ended up being extremely top notch and ran well with the drinks. Kudos to the Chef at Spicekraft for presenting such dishes under one menu to the sustenance sweethearts in Kolkata. All in all a great experience altogether.

Will visit again. ‚ò∫

May be Best Food I ever had...
and This place lives up to its reputation and it's zomato rating.

Went there for a lunch with 3 friends of mine.
As it was a weekday we didn't have to wait...

Coming to ambiance of this restaurant, It was cosy, soothing.
Before landing there I knew What I will be ordering..

Without wasting any time we ordered

1.Dajaj Chermoula - Chicken marinated with selected aromatic spices grilled to perfection served with yougart and fried garlic dip.

2. Beer can Tempoora Fish- Chrispy Suculat pices of Basa deep fried to perfection served with Mayonis base dip which has a subtle hint of Orange. This combination of fried fish and this dip works wonders for me.. and the presentation of this dish is impeccable.

3.Shepherds Pie - though it is a main dish we order it as a starter..This is just Devine, minced lamb with mashed potato and cheese baked to perfection. Accompanied with garlic bread.

.For mains we decided to order Indian
We ordered

1.Kuttu Paratha - small pieces of Paratha sauted with curry leaves, scramble egg and masala taste preety good.

2. Pudinah paratha- They way they serve this dish is awesome, Flaky Paratha with awesome smell of pudinah.

3.Laal Mass - This is a delicacy from the royal Family of Udaipur. This dish beauty lies in its simplicity.
And The Laal Mass they serve in Spice Kraft is just perfect,Tender pices of Mutton drenched in a spicy red gravy taste Devine with pudinah paratha-.

4- Gustaba - This dish is a from Kashmir. This is showstopper dish of any Kashmiri wazwan. Gustaba is made from koftas of minced Lamb shimmered in a curd base white gravy. I know the way authentic Gustaba is made is not possible for any restuarant to prepare it that way but Spice Kraft has done justice to the dish.

For Desert we ordered the showstopper
Jack Daniels Mousse - This is a deconstructed desert , served with Pieces of sponge cake dipped in sugar syrup , Orange peel reduction , and the mousse in which they incorporated the jack Daniel.

The combination of Tartness and fragrance from orange peel reduction, soft sponge cake and the smoothness of mousse with the flavour of whisky worked wonder.

The way the menu has been designed taking the best dishes from different cuisine across the globe , The Intricacy of each dish, the way it has been served, the way flavours are combined , it clearly shows how much time the chef has devoted to combine the flavours of each dishes. KUDUS to Chef Sambit.I became you Fan Sir.

Service is awesome, waiters are well informed.
and They serve awesome cocktails also.

This place has earned a special place in my üíì‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

The USP of this place is innovative mocktails & cocktails.Among Them Cucumber Kooler is MUST MUST TRY.

Moving towards starters We tried their Dahi Kham Khatai,Kele Ke Phool,Khoai Tay,LYMWN Samak,Poh Pia among others.

Most of them were very good.And Last but not the least ‚Äú100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut‚Äù was icing on the cake.It is also a must try.

Yesterday was my birthday and its got to be some special. Spice kraft, this place had been on my bucket list for quite sometime. Easy to locate,¬†nearby hazra law college. We went there for dinner but during those peak hours hardly you could get any parking.¬†From outside this place, might not appeal the goodness that it stores inside.¬†Ambiance was lovely with a spicy affair and a¬†nice playlist of musical tunes.¬†We tried beer can tempura fish (the fried fish strips were served in a beer can and the taste was excellent)¬†with a mango driver and a beer, nasi goreng (indonesian speciality)¬†and hot garlic chicken.¬†Overall, the quality and the quantity of all the foods were turned out to be damn good. Nice hospitality and the prices were so reasonable. Strongly recommended.

This place is just great. Starting from the ambiance to the food. I am overly pleased with this one. I recommend this place to everyone!! No wonder it has such a good rating in Zomato. I have been here twice and my experience,both the days were wonderful. Last time we ordered the cranapple driver,dajaj chermoula,lymwn samak, coc-au-vin,baked bhetki wellington and chicken stroganoff. Lymwn samak is their special dish and it will leave you licking your spoons I can guarantee. It's heavenly. It's a preparation of fish. I give the main courses a thumbs up as well. The baked bhetki with cheese was just yummmyyy. The quality is awesome. The quantity is fine. You must try these dishes. You will not be disappointed at all. Will visit this place until I finish trying each of their items!!!! Keep up the good work Spice Kraft.

Located in the heart of ballygunge phari, this restaurant is a must try for every foodies.
As the name says, it is a place of fine spice arts.
Do try their drinks... The infusion of spices in the drinks were simply amazing..
We had cucumber cooler, kokum rita in the mocktails
Litchitini, jack black and painkiller were among the cocktails.
Litchitini was my favourite.. I am willing to try it again on my next visit.
If you like something strong then do try out the painkiller.
Off to the starters :beer can tempura fish, lymwn samak
Main course : chicken fried rice, nasi goreng, shredded lamb in masaman curry, mandarin fish with chicken,butter naan and kadhai murg kassa.
The Indonesian spices were simply divine to the taste buds.. Do try the lamb dish if you don't like spicy dishes.. And the nasi goreng was a completely new experience..
I didn't get a chance to try out much of the desserts but the classic montecarlo was just the best to complete my meal.
They offer a vivid variety of desserts, definitely try the boozerts..

It has good food and great ambience. However, it's a better experience if you visit this place for dinner than for lunch, when the owner is also around. Their chicken popcorn, chilli chicken dry, canioli (veg, chicken, fish) and the beri pulao starter are all a must try. You can taste the alcohol in their cocktails rather than just guessing that it's there. The restaurant provides food you know with a twist. It's a great experience. But the laal maas and sheermal they provide is nowhere close to the originally tasty counterpart. So the laal maas duo is something you can avoid.

Now about the fusion drink we tried 1 cocktail only which is called pain killer- vodka and cranberry it was awesome one was enough to give my friend tipsy feeling....highly recommended

Pros
Pocket friendly
Great options on booze
Food quantity just sufficient
Entr√©e are the best thing about this place
Staff is courteous and professional
Service is top notch
Will definitely wanna go back again

Cons
Lighting is too dim for my liking
Pork ribs to be avoided as fusion with tamarind chutney is a let down
Deviled crab meat is not as d name says yet the flavour is balanced - not at all hot or spicy
Biryani - please avoid
Raita 150 - doesn't justify
Kebabs - got it packed but no salad or pudina dips
Lot of booze not available
Pitcher not available although mentioned in the menu

Guys dont judge on the basis of cons as it has things which can be avoided or may not bother most


Its definitely a place i would suggest to all

A great restaurant indeed!!! Starting from the food to the ambience this place strike the right chords. 

The thing which i particularly like about this place is their mind blowing innovative presentations. The dishes are presented so well, they automatically demand your adoration.

Staff courtesy is equally good. The chef himself is very friendly and interactive. Fried ice-cream which happens to be one of the in-house speciality was recommended by him, and we were absolutely blown over by it. The perfect ending to a fabulous experience.

Keep it up spicekraft!!! And thank you for gifting us a wonderful time.

Would like to visit again for sure.

First thing that comes into my mind after visiting this place is how can this place got 4.8 when bar b q got 4.9 . Had signature dishes like tempora fish, fish papiolote , coq au vin and 3 other dishes. Quantity is very less . Quality is ok but nothing special to wrote about . Whoever visited bar b q nation , for them spicekraft will be a joke . Only positive is the ambience . I wonder how much profit owners are accumulating after serving so less quantity with high price tag. This was my second visit . Except for thermidor lobster ,will not visit again.

This place can quite easily be located since it stands exactly opposite to Hazra Law College. 
As one enters the place,it is divited into two sections-
The one that comes first as one is entering is well lit with natural light and the second or the other section is dimly lit with simple yet attractive decor.

We started off by trying their wide range of coolers:
‚óèKokum Rita
‚óèRed grape &Basil twister
‚óèTangy mandarin & Lemon grass schock
‚óèCucumber cooler.

Next up we moved on to the starters and tried the following items:
‚óèBeer can tempura fish (This is a recommended dish in Spice Kraft)
‚óèDajaj charmoula (Another must try from their starters menu)
‚óèFish-en-papillote (This items is fish based as the name goes and comes wrapped in a paper. Perfectly prepared this just melts in the mouth and the taste lingers for quite sometime)
‚óèHyderabadi mutton haleem kibbeh
‚óèSoy based drums of again (Once again,this is a must have here)

Finally moving onto the main course,as we were already full we had ordered for tge following dishes:
‚óèLobster Thermidor (This one is just AMAZING and the flavours are very distinct. A must have once again)
‚óèNasi Goreng (This is our very own friend rice but with a twist. It is served with an egg poach and prawn Chips.)
‚óèPenne pasta alfredo non-veg( I must say,this is the best white sauce pasta I've had in my life. A must try)

The Non-veg items here are remarkable. Each one in unique in it's self and prepared to perfection. Starting from the starters to the maincourse all the items have left my tastebuds spellbound.

Finally,from the dessert section we have tge following:
‚óè100% jack daniels mousse(If one is comfortable with alcohol based desserts then this one is a definite try)
‚óèClassic monte carlo (An icecream based dessert. Very uniquely prepared and presented)

Here comes an end to my first visit to this amazing restaurant. Looking forward to many more visits and trying all their amazing dishes.

This place is just located near the Hazra Law College.
Ambience of this place is pretty amazing, dim lights, light music, lovely portraits.
Service is pretty good as the head chef himself came to us and asked about the food. Humble Hospitality.
It's probably the non vegetarian paradise.
The starters were pretty amazing with their signature dips.
Must try:
Dajaj Charmoula
Beer Can Tempura Fish
Baked Fish Canollis
Bacardi Limon Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausages
Shepherds Pie
Nasi Goreng
Beyond Fried Ice Cream
100% Jack Daniel Mousse

The restaurant is just located near hazra law college just near to ballygunge crossing.

Ambience - Just perfect. Classy, Elegant and Aristocrat. If somebody wants to go for family outing or a date. This one is the perfect place. It's chilly and dim lights creating the ambience. 

Service- Good. Even the head chef is the owner of this place who is humble enough to visit the customers and enquired whether we are satisfied with the service and food. 

Food - I must say food is too good. Quality is good. I can say it as the hidden gem in the city. Dajaj Charmoula which is a chicken item and Beer Can Tempura Fish is a must try at this outlet. Drinks are good too. Even Fish en papillote is just yummy. One thing I discovered that Penne Pasta in this restaurant is very much different and really too yummy..!! Cheers.. üëå

Spice kraft has long been on my wish list, finally got the chance to visit today. This place is located just opposite to hazra law college. The interiors of the restaurant is beautifully designed.
For starters I ordered beer can tempura fish, Hyderabadi mutton haleem kibbeh and drums of heaven,
The beer can tempura fish, recommended by many of my friends lived upto my expectations.
Hyderabadi mutton haleem kibbeh is definitely going to give you the taste of haleem of Hyderabad. I've had authentic Hyderabadi haleem and I could spot no difference with this dish.
Fish en pappilote was a star dish. The fish, wrapped in a paper, was perfectly cooked and just melted in my mouth. 
For main course, I had Nasi goreng, and penne pasta alfredo, loved the taste of both but penne pasta alfredo won my heart. I'm definitely going to come back again for this one.
For dessert I had the Monte Carlo which is a fusion ice-cream and tasted really good. 
I am definitely going to come back again and again until I have no dishes left to try. A five star rating and a must visit from my side.

Here I mark my 100th review on Zomato with Spice Kraft! üçª

üè©Location: Quite easy to locate, Spice Kraft stands on Hazra Road, a 5-10 minutes walk from Ballygunge Phari. The nearby landmarks are Sharma's Dhaba and Hazra Law College.

üçúFood: Truly being a bliss to Non-Vegetaranians, Spice Kraft at the same time does not lag behind with their wide varieties of Veg items as well. Being a Non-Veg myself, I've tried the following;

BEVERAGE üçπüç∑üç∏
Kokum Rita & Cucumber Coolers, both of which were really soothing and refreshing.

STARTERS üçü
Fish-en-Papillote: Wrapped in paper, this fish item baked with cheese is simply a must have!! It was literally heavenly! Highly recommended!
Dajaj Chermoula: Grilled Chicken, succulent and delicious.
Beer Can Tempura Fish: Fish battered fry, crispy and delightful.
Soy Braised Drums of Heaven: Chicken Drumsticks, tender and juicy.
Hyderabadi Mutton Haleem Kibbeh: Delicious Mutton Kebabs.

MAIN COURSE üçùüçñüçóüç§üçõüçöüçú
Lobster Thermidor: Lobster stuffed with meat and cheese, accompanied with rice and veggies, it is sure to set the last of the taste bud, active!
Penne Pasta in Alfredo Sauce: Really tempting and delectable.
Nasi Goreng: Indonesian rice, was quite decent.

DESSERT üç®üçßüç¶üç©üç∞
100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut and Classic Monte Carlo: As it says, 'All's well that ends well', these desserts truly executed the meaning!!

Ambience is quite good and so is the service. Very good hospitality. I had a very nice experience over here. I'll surely recommend this place to all the foodies out there!! üòä

Simply mouth smacking dishes. Prepared with extra emotions and henceforth the dishes increase the level of delicacy. Perfectly cooked and marinated dishes that will leave an impact even when the dishes r no more in the plate. Awesomely decorated and garnished platters will eventually increase the expectations and yes the quality is a class. A must go for all the foodies. The service is good too. Everyone is very eager to let you know about the dishes you are ordering. The alcohol served are at their best. Specifically the cocktails. And the ambiance is way too romantic. It's the best place for a perfect romantic food date.

Visited here yesterday for dinner with family .This is my 2nd visit and quite like the green chilli chicken.. the sitting is a little cramped. Food is good and variety is immense.. waiters are knowledgable .. the only thing that put me off was that they were rushing for us to finish food and provided the bill without even asking us .. we had Indian for dinner and paneer and chicken as main dishes were decent..

Been here before and reviewed before for its wonderful ambience, reception and definitely the exquisite food quality along with the suggestion given by the staff based on one's taste is really commendable.

Today being Bijoya Dashomi in Calcutta, I along with my family and two other families; total of 10members happened to drop at this place again.

However, the staff along with the owner "Sambit" was grossly unprofessional in forcefully suggesting a group of 10members to accommodate in a table of 6. The owner had the audacity to tell that they accommodate even 12members in a table of 6. The reason behind the same being that tables have been pre-booked, though yesterday we requested for a table booking which got denied suggesting no pre-bookings are allowed. The owner spearheaded the onslaught without a bit of remorse, even though there was no guests outside the restaurant and there were atleast 6tables of 6each free.
We even requested to let 6of us occupy a table of 6 and the remaining 4 to occupy a table of 4

Finally today I got a chance to visit Spice Kraft!! 
Located near Hazra Law College, it was quite easy to spot the place. 
 The decor was elegant and the ambience  was delightful. Varieties of dishes are available. The restaurant remained full till we left. All the dishes were well presented. The head chef himself came up to ask us about the dishes which was really commendable.
BEVERAGES
Kokum Rita: A refreshing drink. It had a perfect mix of kokum juice and spices.
Red Grape & Basil Twister: The combination was perfect and was refreshing. It was a bit sweet perfect for sweet tooth.

APPETIZERS
Beer Can Tempura Fish: It was served in a beer can which was quite innovative. The dip went well with the fish. It is one of the signature dishes of this place. It tasted really good. 
Dajaj Charmoula: It is another signature dish of this place. The Chicken was soft with smoked flavour. It was also presented well in small cups. A must try dish.
Bacardi Lemon infused tand Chicken Sausage: This dish was also perfect. The outer layer tasted like a tandoori item and the inner layer was a sausage. And of course it was an eye pleasing dish as well.
Lymwn Samak: It is a Lebanese dish. The texture of the fish was perfect and the taste as well. 

MAINS
Nasi Goreng: Indonesian‚Äã fried rice which was served with a fried egg on top of it. The rice was perfectly cooked.
Baked Fish Canollis :  The cheesy fishy combination was delicious.
Shepherd's Pie: The pie had minced lamb in it which tasted heavenly. It came  with bread sticks which were crunchy and good. This dish was total yum. 
 
DESSERTS
100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut: It was served with sponge cake and Orange sauce. The combination was perfect.
Beyond Fried Ice cream: The Chocolate syrup in it OMG!!  The hot crispy shell around the icecream was amazing. The flavour of the icecream was too good and it was home-made.

Overall a very good experience and I would definitely like to revisit the restaurant to try out the other dishes. Each and every dishes were cooked to perfection. The food fusions are really appreciated.
Pocket pinch was reasonable. The staff were warm and welcoming. The service was excellent as well. 
Kudos to the Spice Karft team!! 
Highly Recommended üòäüíØ

Oh what a place! I will never forget dining here. 1st the ambiance was just captivating! Then the service was just top notch, the staff were polite and explained the dishes very well when asked. The restaurant was clean! We didn't have to wait much after the food was ordered. Now food was too good!¬†
The head chef came himself and asked about how the food was... I deducted .5 just because there is no option to deduct .1 else I have given 4.9. Reason behind that is the item 'nasi goreng' felt a bit spicy.Well, but I think if you are in kolkata,do give this place a try.U won't be let down.. Trust me!!

Visualise a spine chilling nail biting scene of a movie all of us wide eyed and waiting to shriek any moment....üò≥....what comes next is a ice cream truck!!!!this was my experience at spicekraft....heard a lot of good things so went for dinner with lot of expectation but was utterly disappointed.when we called the restaurant for a reservation the reply was fairly courteous...on reaching we found a table promptly...after that everything was unacceptable about a place which has such high ratings. Guests who arrived late were served early whatever I could make out is that older customers are more welcome.we had to constantly ask for somebody to take the order.the most surprising part was when we decided to order wine...the menu shows choices yet they are majorly unavailable...the waiters are not knowledgable about wine...no help from their end unless you know your wine.the food was pretty average...fish tempura was oily and no tissue to soak the extra oil....the aloo dum was very hot and sweet(I dnt know yü§î)...dal makhani was so so and the chicken rasa was miles away from how maharashtrian's cook.also when you ask for any other sauce apart from the one accompanying the dish you are bluntly refused.Space constraint is also an issue...decor not very appealing...nor the ambience is appreciable.not a good experience guys.

This restaurant is located right in Ballygunge phari, just a few buildings away from the Phari petrol pump. The ambience of the place is very nice and the menu is quite interesting. We had the kele-ke-phool ke croque monsieur, devilled crab meat, khoai tay, as starters. All of them were very unique and very delicious. For the mains, we had the assorted vegetables in spicy penang curry, Sichuan fish and veg haka noodles. The noodles and fish item were nothing extraordinary, but the penang curry was very well prepared. The quantity of the noodles is sufficient, i.e. 1 plate can be easily divided among 2 ladies; can't say about men though.
The restaurant takes its last order for lunch by 3-3:15 and you have to clear the tables by 4-4:10, so we were a bit rushed as we arrived late. But the food made up for it. The staff are quite courteous. We will definitely visit the place again to try the rest of what they have to order.

My favourite place in Kolkata. Been there loads of times, have tasted lots of items, yet to try any Indian item though. DAJAJ CHERMOULA might be the best chicken preparation I have had. And I am yet to find anything that can be compared to the JACK DANIELS MOUSSE. Each one of the CONTINENTAL CLASSICS is a classic in the true sense. The BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH and LOBSTER THERMIDOR also deserve special mention. KHOR KHOG is next in my list.

On my birthday I thought of going to a new place, so I decided to go to Spice Kraft. And really speaking the place didn't disappointed me. I am a genuine foodie, and I visited more than 100 restuarants in kolkata, Spice Kraft is one of the best continental restuarant in the city and really worth of visiting again.
Regarding the ambience,the restuarant has three different sections with different lighting.The decoration was done quite wisely.
Now regarding the food, I have already mentioned earlier that this restuarants serves few some best continental dishes in the city. In starters we ordered pork ribs burrah kabab, the meat was tenders and well marinated.On main course I ordered Shepherd's Pie(lamb with garlic bread stick) , baked fish Wellington  (fillet cooked with cheese and saffron rice) and Lobster thermidor( lobster meat cooked with cheese and served in a lobster shell).The lamb was cooked perfectly and all the dishes were tantalising.
Just a earnest request to all, please give this place a visit .This place not so costly also.

This place had been on my bucket list for quite sometime and I must say that though I had very high expectations from the place, it managed to only meet them, but also surpass them. The ambience is beautiful. The decor is amazing and the music being played is also very soothing. The staffs were extremely courteous and service was also nice.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I've tried out Kiwi and Mango Collins as the mocktail, for starters I've tried out Dajaj Charmoula, Lymwn Samak and in the main course we had Devilled Crab, Moon Faan, Shepherds Pie and for the dessert I had Beyond Fried Ice cream and 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut. All the dishes were absolutely lip smacking and kept us wanting for more. The Dajaj Charmoula has become one of my favorite starters ever. The food did not fail to deliver in both quantity as well as quality aspect of things.

FINAL VERDICT- I highy recommend this place to all the food lovers of the city and I must say that you are missing out big time if you haven't been to this place.

Spice Kraft is one of the most beautiful restaurant in Ballygunge Phari which is near Hazra law college and that's the moment I absolutely fell in love with the restaurant.

The interior is very well decorated. Also the crowd is very nice. The seating arrangement, the ceiling and the walls look absolutely amazing.

And It was a summer afternoon and we started with Cucumber Cooler and Kiwi & Mango collins, which was fizzy and refreshing.

Among starters, Beer Can Tempura fish, Fish-En-Papillote, Dajaj charmoula and Lymwn samak was excellent. Beer can tempura which was good, and tasted good with the sauces. Fish-En-Papillote is extremely heaven. Foods cooked "en papillote"‚Äîin a paper bag‚Äîemerge succulent and saturated with flavor.Dajaj Charmoula is also very good and Lymwn Samak were extremely delicious.

The main course had a lot of options like shepard pie, baked fish canollis, chicken IN, chilly oyster & mushroom, devilled crab meat, doodhiyaan kebab, hunan fish, moon faan and Nasi Goreng. The quantity of each of every dishes were so huge that we somehow move to the desserts.¬†

In Desserts we had beyond fried ice cream, classic monte carlo and 100% jack daniels & barry callebaut swiss chocolate mousse. Beyond fried ice cream was well prepared. The quantity, once again amazed us. And every food items was just on point. Their menu is quite vast. So I'm coming back soon to try the other dishes.

Now finally the service. Very well behaved, attentive and very friendly. 
The service was pretty fast, considering the crowd in the restaurant at that point of time.
A long way to go for Spice Kraft <3 :)

Devilled Crab Meat, Grilled fish in Lemon butter sause,Fish En Papiollite, Hunan Fish, Moon faan Classic Monte Carlo.
Could'nt fix up my star performer dish here because everything was just so pitch perfect to taste.
Rather every dish had its own charm.
It was a amazing experience all together.
This place definetly stands as difference from all the restaurants in the city. This place is s.omething which the city of joy should be proud of.
This place definetly gets a 'Must visit' tag.
Check list dusted.

Little did I know that this newest try of mine would turn out to be so well.

Easy to locate, nearby law college. Went in for a lunch with my colleagues. I tried a cucumber cooler which was too refreshing in this cruel afternoon's sun, a welcome drink indeed.

With starters tried 'Doodhiyan Kebab', tendor paneer fillings inside it, truly loved it. The kali daal here needs a mention, whoever visiting this place has to keep it in his order, highly recommended. Also tried a 'moon fan' rice, which was made to suit me as a vegetarian.
Take my advice, do keep a beverage ready when you order it, its damn hot.

After we were fully done, then comes the best part, the deserts. Firstly came a fried icecream, called 'beyond fried icecream' which was mesmerized with the outer layering, it just melted in the mouth.
Another dessert worth mentioning‚Äã was barry callebaut swiss, some callebaut which is actually like sponge cakes to be taken with the mousse, do try it. I can bet upon the mousse to be good evertime.

Truly coming here once again for also trying other things my appetite didn't allow me to.

Food is pretty ordinary . The calamari fry they served was chewy, served me lamb chops instead of pork chops and tried to convince me it was pork. I also did not get my brand of beer cause it was out of stock. Well a good restaurant is well provisioned one. I do not understand the reason for its good ratings honestly. Perhaps I didn't order the right dishes

I recently visited this restaurant with my husband. I must the food was quite good and the staffs are very friendly and cooperative. We ordered Beer can Tempura fish, Mixed noodles, Hunan fish with chicken and 100% Jack Daniel mousse.The fish with chicken was quite cleverly cooked but it was a bit too salty as per my taste. I loved the mousse and Beer can tempura fish, it was served with a creamy mayo dip. Chinese dishes are not that out of the world but I am sure their continental delicacies are good. Table booking recommended for convinience.

Hi guys
I visited this place with my office colleagues to celebrate our promotion party. 
Ambience - From outside this place more might not appeal the goodness that it stores inside. The decor inside inspired romance from every corner of the place. The place is cozy as well with its dim lighting. 
Food - We ordered Dajaj Charmoula and beer can tempura fish. Both of them were absolutely@ delectable. The flavors were well balanced and the meat and fish were cooked perfectly. For main course, we ordered Nasi Goreng, Chicken in oyster sauce, Garlic chicken noodles and Chicken hunan. All of the dishes were spot on when it comes to taste and the portions were also sufficient. 
Drinks - We ordered Long Island Ice Tea and it was really good. But beware, you'll need a big heart to handle the LIIT. 
Service - The staff were cordial and also helped us explain the order that we placed. 

I would recommend this place to my friends. 

Just one suggestion, it would be really great if you could add some hookahs to your menu. 

Cheers and keep up the good work!!

Easy to locate would be one adjective to this place , otherwise food quality is normal nothing very much specifically outstanding here.Except for the ambience and the decor inside , its definitely gonna give you a nice feel once you are inside.
Food is more or less good , if you are in for some drinks and would not mind a cocktail , do give their JAMUN MARY a try , a variant of the classic BLOODY MARY with the tomato being replaced with jamun syrup topped with chuuran to give you a lip smacking experience.

I have always been on the slightly experimental side as far as food is concerned and probably the people behind Zomato had already understood that. My contribution to the foodie community was rewarded in the form of a voucher to the then newly opened restaurant called ‚ÄúSpice Kraft, Ballygunj‚Äù. So before starting my review, I would like to thank zomato and Ms Samriddhi Singhvi who provided me with the voucher to this place. Thank you team Zomato for always inspiring foodies like me with little treats such as these.

This place came with a surprise...
Fusion Food at it's Best!!!!
With the fusion food and location like Ballygunge phari...the pricing was actually a surprise. The price of the food is very very reasonable as compared to the idea that was behind the food, the great taste of the food and the location of the place.¬†
The portions are good with great taste...no complaints for the drinks that we have tried.
the dessert, 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss is a must try!!!

One issue is with one of the desserts, Monte Carlo...was not up to the mark that we expected after the great lunch.
Another issue is the ambience of the place...the air condition was not strong that should be during a hot summer day and there were flies in the restaurant, which was a huge turn-off

We had heard a lot about this place and decided to pay it a visit over the weekend. It is a nice cozy place located quite close to Ballygunj Phari. We went at around 1 and had no trouble finding a place to sit. The ambience was good , the food was very good , the presentation was eye-candy ; but the thing that really stood out was their customer service. The attendant was extremely courteous and patient. Infact there were times when I was made to feel like their son-in-law ; and so much so that for a few secs I even wondered if he will just pick the spoon up and start feeding me with it ! Well , that didn't happen ! Nevertheless , I am going to visit this place again . I recommend that you do too !

I tried shephard's pie and it was not disappointing this time. For starters i had octopus, it was nice and tasty. One can easily order sea food here. The staffs are also friendly.
Overall it was a nice experience.

situated near ballygunge phari, a bit inside the lane, this restaurant offers delicious food at reasonable prices. It is in high demand we guess, because by the time we finished our food it was completely full.
It has a nice ambiance with a classic choice of music playing in the background.
We ordered Dajaj Chermoula which is their specialty and everybody wishes to have it here.
The chicken was cooked in exotic spices and beautifully served with a sweet Lebanese sauce.
Then we had Lachcha paratha and Naan along with a Punjabi mutton curry-Rarha Gosth. The mutton was soft and beautifully cooked in chicken keema gravy. The food was just finger-licking good. Service is very good. We will definitely visit here another time to try their diverse menu with so many options for good food.

I went to this place last week with my family and I had one of the best culinary experiences by far. It is indeed a must try place as the food, service and the ambience altogether does a complete justice to the amount of money you spend.
The place is at a 5 mins walking distance from the Ballygunge Phari petrol pump and is very easy to spot.
To begin with the restaurant has a very warm and welcoming ambience. 
Coming to the food, you get a very innovative menu. We tried their signature Beer can tempura fish and Dajaj chermoula for starters. The fish had an amazing burst of flavours in every bite. The chicken was very tender and had a very delightful taste. For the main course we had shephard's pie and Cantonese noodles both having amazing blend of flavours and spices. And for the desserts we ordered Monte Carlo which was simply out of the world. Lastly the amazing Kokum mocktail which was suggested to us by the staff added an edge to the whole meal. All in all it was a very delectable palette.
Last but not the least the extremely courteous and friendly staff with their prompt service made our experience memorable. Will definitely visit this place again.

Booze‚Äã is pocket freindly and the food is innovative. Must try are beer batter tempura fish, dajaj charmula, lemon shamak and sheferd' pie. A must vist for all.

May be the food is good but staff behavior is pathetic. When we asked where is the list of starters on the menu card; the waiter told us that we will not understand anything by looking at that, rather he will suggest us what to have. When the starter was given, I asked the waiter if he can serve us in our individual plate, he asked us to eat it from the main plate itself. One cook/chef was talking so loudly with a bunch of guests that we could not even do our conversation. Our over all experience was extremely pathetic and I personally will never visit this place again. It seems that the staff there judge people by looking at their clothing may be!

I went to this restaurant yesterday and I found it really really nice..
1. Ambiance- cozy, some most romantic English instrumental songs were being played. Nice decoration. Good place to go on a date.
2. Staff- very friendly.
3. Cocktails- we ordered Sangria and LIIT. ¬†Liit was for my friends so as i didn't taste it i can't say anything about it. Now coming to Sangria its basically red wine with pieces of apples in it. It tasted good.¬†
4. Food- Before coming to the taste, what must be mentioned regarding the food is the decoration. The way they decorate their food I personally found it unique and enough to attract all its customers. Now coming to the taste of the food DELICIOUS BEYOND ANY DOUBT. We ordered BEERCAN TEMPURA, SHISH TAOUK, SHEPHERD'S PIE, ASI GOREN, BAKED WELLINGTON. All of them was mouth watering and too delicious.
Truly an experience worth mentioning..:)

This place is undoubtedly foodies' paradise! One of the most finest and fanciest restaurant of Kolkata this has gained so much of popularity and praise in a small span of time and this place deserve that undoubtedly. Very easy locate Spice Kraft has crafted a menu with so many varities and options and each one is impressive. We went for Dajaj Charmoula and Beer Can fish Tempura for starters. Both was delicious and very attractively presented. Dajaj Charmoula was well cooked and flavourful but was kind of similar to that of other kebabs. Fish Temupra was perfectly crispy from outside and juicy inside. For the main course we had Nasi Goreng and Green Chilli Chicken. Nasi Goreng was so so good and went very well with the spicy Green Chilli Chicken. Both absoultely satisfied my tastebuds successfully. Lastly we had Classic Monte Carlo which was great as well. Service is very good. Ambience is impressive. Though not a big place decor has been done so beautifully. Price is quantity is good. It was a wonderful experience over there. Looking forward to give it a next visit and try out some other dishes. Keep going and prospering!

Experience at spice Kraft was mesmerizing. At first we ordered blue and mango Collins which is a mocktail. It's just awesome. It had a mango nd slight kiwi flavour. We also ordered tangerine which is a mocktail made of orange and soda. It also tasted good. Then we went on to order dajaj charmoula. It simulates tangri kebab. It was also awesome. We ordered Khor khog which is a dish made of lamb meat . It was spicy and tasty. And also not to forget beer cantempura fish. It will melt your heart like anything because it's made of fish coated with butter. Among alcohols we ordered LIIT or toxic which is toxic drink made of vodka, gin, rum and all the toxic drinks. Also hammer Jack was good. In deserts we ordered classic Monte Carlo which was so awesome. All together the experience was mind blowing.

Saw the extremely high ratings for this place and decided to give it a try a few days back. It is conveniently located on Hazra road near Ballygunj Phari and is very close to the Hazra Law college. In terms of seating capacity this place can comfortably house around 50 people at a go and yet it was jam packed on the Sunday afternoon when i went there. Ambiance is excellent and the seats are very comfortable. The starters like Squid in Butter Garlic Sauce and Lymwn Samak were extremely delicious specially the fish item, Lymwn Samak which is perhaps a speciality of the place and should definitely be tried. The main course in comparison was not that tasty but it was decent enough specially the Mixed Fried rice and Prawns in Coriander Sauce. Pricing is also extremely reasonable. Overall a which is definitely recommended and should be tried.

We ordered a Beer can tempura which was good, and tasted good with the accompanying sauces. Then we ordered a fish Cujan and it was delicious. The highlight of the evening, though was the dessert - Jack Daniels Mousse, which was perfection.

In one word a great place and a must visit for every cocktail loving person of Kolkata. Small place easy to find. U may call this little restaurant a cocktail specialist. One tip, reach early or try to book a table. Otherwise u may not get a table. We started with Dajaj Charmoula which is lebanese chicken dish. Then Beer Can Tempura Fish, Pork Ribs and 100% JD mousse was awesome. There are many options. In one word the food is awesome. All the dishes were so special and tasty that we just kept ordering. Tried 3-4 cocktails also. But will not specify which ones. It is upto u guys. So order as per your choice. But definitely visit this place. Cheers!!!!

No words to say. The ratings say it all. The food is as great as the ambience & staff behaviour. 

For starters we ordered bacardi limon infused tandoori chicken sausage, beer can tempura fish, & screwdriver the classic orange flavoured cocktail. The quality & presentation of the food were equally impressive. 

In the main course, we ordered moon faan, chicken in masaman curry, khao pad sapparod, prawn in fragrant coriander sauce. The food were fresh, straight from the chef's kitchen, & offered truly great flavours. Chicken in masaman curry just stole the show with its varied taste. The prawn was also a  different but delicious dish. Every item was on point. 

In desserts we had fried ice cream. Don't leave the restaurant without having this dessert. This is a unique dessert exclusively Spicekraft's own kind.

No better way to enjoy frienship day. Thanks to  Spicekraft.

If you're a foodie then you'll know that finding a good restaurant is kinda like being a gold digger, and if you're reading this, you my friend just hit the jackpot.

It would be wise if you reserve a table here in advance cuz there is not much to do while waiting outside.
If you're not sure what to order in case it's your first time here(like mine) just ask the waiters. They're the friendliest waiters I've interacted with till date. The manager Mr.Vimal Nag is as good as the food (hannibal fans, piss off :p ). He suggested and described almost everything I tried.

Okay now down to business,

Starters - Beer Can Fish Tempura, Dajaj Chermoula

Main Course - Coc au Vin, Shepherd's pie, Gambas Peri Peri Prawn(not on the menu....it comes with 4 huge prawns on skewers and rice and veggies on the side), Nasi Goreng along with Hunan fish, Chicken Dum Biryani with Rarha Gosht and the Lobster Thermidor

Dessert - JD Mousse and Fried Ice Cream

The Dajaj Chermoula, I felt was a bit undercooked and the biryani was good but I've had much better

Everything else, I repeat everything else is good enough to take you around the moon and back as soon as the food touched your tongue.
From the smoothness of the Rarha Gosht, to the creaminess of the shepherd's pie.
From the fish dipped and fried in beer batter to the sou vide and grilled Dajaj Chermoula.
From the Lobster which you never have enough of to the lip-smacking Coc au Vin.
Everything Damn Thing blew my tongue away.

And we haven't even reached the desserts, yet.....

Imagine that you're watching Interstellar for the first time. You might not have understood everything the first time around but you knew you were witnessing something great, something only angels can make.
That's how I felt when I tried the JD Mousse.

Then I tried the Fried Ice Cream and this time it wasn't the Interstellar feeling but the Inception one. In short, MIND BLOWING and you don't even realise how and why.
So head over to Ballygunge and give yourself that oh-so-awesome experience that you're dreaming of right now.

That's all folks.

This restaurant was on my wishlist for a pretty long time. Finally managed to visit the place today. I didn't make any prior table reservation so had to wait for 15 minutes which was quite reasonable, that too on a Saturday evening. The ambience was good and classy. Staff was very well mannered and they explained the dishes very well. We had ordered Fish tempura in beer can, Dajaj chermoula, laal maas, naan, grilled fish, Jack Daniels chocolate mousse. The starters were good and came in satisfying quantities. The Dajaj chermoula was excellent. Highly recommended. Other than the starters the main course was also very nice. The presentation of each and every dish was very attractive. The Jack Daniels chocolate mousse is their speciality and deserves special mention for its excellent taste and combination of flavours. Overall it was a wonderful dining experience. Would surely like to visit again.

There are some places that are made for you to experience something that is unreal, amazing and tasteful.
Spice Kraft located in Ballygunge is one such place!

The way the head chef, Mr. Sambit Banik lets you explore the taste of every dish by explaining the contents and origin will make you fall in love with place more!
He is one person you should look forward to meet!

The order and must haves:

Dajaj Charmoula - Nothing better than these pieces of chicken served in different cups grilled to perfection! You would never regret ordering this.

Fried Ice Cream: A perfect combination of hot and cold served with chocolate syrup is gonna make you drool over!

Chicken Hakka Noodles: These classics have also been given an extra taste and spice to it that make you ask for more!

Chicken in choice of sauce : Get ready to be blown by its presentation and taste! A must have!

100% Jack Daniels and Barry Calebaut : A signature dish with crazy presentation! Yet again a must have!

Drinks:

Cucumber Cooler : A refreshing drink which goes along really well with the food!

Explore a plethora of dishes with culinary twists.

Tired are you? Are you waiting at Ballygunge and wondering where to dine? Well, probably you should open your GPS and head straight to Spice Kraft. It is surely going to satisfy you. I mean your taste buds.¬†

The ambience and decor of this restaurant is excellent and the way Mr Sambit Banik (Head Chef) explains the nitty gritties of each and every dish to his customers is praiseworthy. One should start exploring this place by trying the signature dishes. Now comes the list of what I tried at this place.¬†

‚Ä¢ Beer Can Tempura Fish - This is classic dish to start off with. The fried fish strips are served in a beer can and the taste is splendid. A homemade tartar dip is provided as well. This dish is really popular and the best part is the fish being fresh.

‚Ä¢ The Terminator - A strong alcoholic drink which has a perfect blend of Tequila and Beer. The drink is served in a beer mug with a topsy-turvy 330ml beer bottle in the mug.¬†

‚Ä¢ Jet fuel - The name might give you a hint of what it is. A thumping drink that is meant to make you fly. Again, a beer based drink which is concocted by mingling Absolut Vodka, Tequila, Cointreau and Beer. It comes in a mini tower with a couple of pipes coming out from the bottom. The pipes are used to pour the drink.¬†You would feel like a king when the tower arrives on your table and it does draw people's eyeballs.¬†

‚Ä¢ Dajaj Charmoula - Chicken tengris baked in tandoor and served in small cups. A dish consists of 6 pieces and they are arranged in 6 seperate cups. Looks nice and tastes nice as well. The origin of this dish lies in Northern Africa. Charmoula is a special marinade (cumin based) used primarily to cook seafood. However, the marinade can be used to cook dajaj as well. Dajaj is an Arabic word which means chicken. The meat is soft and juicy. A must try. Yum-yum!

‚Ä¢ Shepherd's Pie - A dish which comes right from the Kingdom. I was really amazed to have this pie made with lamb. For a second I thought I was right at Borough Market. ¬†

‚Ä¢ Fried Ice Cream - A gastronomical delight decorated elegantly. The ice cream is one of a kind and is created at Spice Kraft. Topped with a cherry, this is a dish to die for.

That's all folks.

Spice Kraft Restaurant cum Bar is located near Hazra Law College. This is my second visit to this restaurant. 
Ambiance was soothing and very good. They have two separate rooms for the guests. I opted the second room because outside seating were almost crowded. 

Staffs were very active this time compared to my last visit and they greeted me in very good manner.

Drinks: 
1. Cucumber Cooler was very refreshing and the mix was perfect.
2. Jet Fuel is very energetic drink from Chef Sambit. Perfect mixture of Absolute Vodka, Beer, Tequila and some orange flavored liquor (forgot the name). Presented in a Beer dispenser.

Starters:
1. Dajaj Charmoula was made from chicken legs with a chef's special dip. tasted brilliant.
2. Lymwn Samak was a fish starter again presented with special dip. Very soft melting experience.
3. Later came the Beer can tempura fish. Which is their signature and famous dish.
4. Fish-en-papilotte is another paper wrapped fish starter made by chef Sambit. 

Main Course:
Before Main Course Master Chef Sambit came and elaborate all the dishes and their specialty. He suggested the main course and I was very pleased by his humble behavior. 
1. Sichuan Chicken need no introduction here, great taste.
2. Gustabha is made from mutton keema. tasted good.
3. Pudina Paratha was also good.
4. Lobster Thermidor is another good dish served with herb rice and sauted veggies.
5. Moon Fan Rice is very good and came with generous quantity.

Desserts:
1. Fried Ice Cream is perfect.
2. Jack Daniels Mousse was my Favorite from the evening.

Thanks Mr. Sambit for the evening. Will visit soon.

Its Time For My 100th Review Finally..!!

Well, Firstly I Would Like To Thank The Zomato Team and My Followers for their constant support without whom it would not have been possible for me to reach a small milestone today. Special Thanks to Spice Kraft Restaurant for their Cooperation and Service. I was invited for a meet in the Spice Kraft Bar & Restaurant yesterday situated on the Old Bondel Road close to Hazra Law College. Locationwise and Exterior Looks of this Outlet looks cool and a small F.L. Shop Counter is just adjacent to their entry gate. I was greeted by their cooperative and professional staffs and went to the reserved premises that were done by my colleagues. The chilled airconditioned room with adequate space was perfect for a meetup or event. Served with Beer and Chilled Ice with Lemon pinch, I geared up for the delicious starters that was ordered by my friends. The staffs were cooperative enough to serve us with the starters of chicken and fish. The first starter named as Dajaj Charmoula basically consisting of leg pieces of chicken tasted superb. Next came in the starter of fish known as Lymwn Samak which was too good to melt in our mouth. Then another lick smacking fries known as Beer Can Tempura Fish was crispy enough to licker our taste buds at it's best. Next came in an innovative paper wrapped baked fish starter known as Fish - en - papilotte that was something nicely spooned up fast. Time for the main course as The Courteous Staffs cleaned the table and served us in no time with the Master Chef's Advice who was properly guiding us about the innovative dishes. First came in the Pudina Paratha served in a beautiful cycle holder which tasted good enough to join along with our next main course served with Schezwan Chicken. Then came the Rice item called Moon Fan mixed with chicken and mushroom along with egg that was purely heaven with another lip smacking dish known as Shepherd's Pie and Goustaba consisting of perfectly baked lamb and mutton which was the best. As our Tummy gets filled up solidly.. The Desserts were served as the Mousse and the Baked Ice Cream were totally insane to be honest. Overral The Experience Shared in Spice Kraft was totally satisfactorily fantastic in one word..!! Would highly recommend everyone to visit and try out this outlet especially because of their Decor, Ambience and Courteous Staffs along with Lip Smacking Delicious Specialities..!!

I had been wanting to go there for a long time, especially for the Shepherd's pie... finally just dropped in one day about 2 months ago. We did have the Shepherd's pie as well as the lobster Thermidor, which is so reasonably priced! We just loved it, and decided there itself that we will be back! And go back we did, on my birthday... we were not disappointed... 
Coming to the ambience... it's a little dark, and my husband found it a little difficult to read the menu. They have 3 rooms - the main room, and 2 inner rooms, one of which is usually given to groups of men. We loved the selection of music - all the golden oldies! 
The place gets crowded very fast, even on weekdays. So either reach early, or book a table, else you'll have to wait outside. Happy eating!

'Mesmerizing' has to be the word i would like to begin the review with. This place deserves nothing less than a straight A+ in my book. Rarely does it happen that i rate a restaurant 5 on 5, that too in Kolkata which, in my view, is lagging behind in the experimental cuisine zone. However, restaurants like Spice Kraft is playing its part well to pull the game up to the next level.
So, my food & beverage experience in brief -
1. Cocktail :
a) Kokum Rita- a mix of kokum juice, tequila. and spices.
b) RDX
c) The terminator
d) Jet Fuel - a concoction of vodka, tequila, cointreau on a base of beer. Make sure not to miss this one!
2. Starter :
a) beer can tempura fish - melts in your mouth!
b) Dajaj Charmoula - tender juicy chicken legs having a touch and essence of reshmi kebab.
c) Fish-en-papillote - paper wrapped fish marinated with cheese. An absolute delight for the taste bud! Highly recommended!
d) Lymwn Samak : lemon flavoured grilled fish served with a mouth-wateringly delicious dip. Please try it!
3. Main Course:
a) Moon faan- a chinese rice dish, cooked to perfection.
b) sichuan chicken- exactly as it should be. Hot!
c) Shepherd's Pie- a British classic. Minced lamb topped with baked mashed potato crust. Must try!
d) Lobster thermidor - lobster meat in cheese & white wine reduction.
e) pudina paratha
f) Goustaba - minced mutton koftas cooked in creamy almond gravy infused with saffron. A kashmiri preparation. Recommendation Alert!!
4. Dessert :
a) Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut swiss chocolate mousse
b) classic monte carlo
c) Fried ice cream
This was the food-gasmic experience. Now to put the overall experience altogether-
Ambience : 5/5
Service : 4.5/5
Cleanliness : 5/5
Pocket pinch : A bit, i agree. But you won't mind at all once you taste the food.

Lastly, Hats Off to the person who has shown courage to invest in such a brilliant venture in kolkata, serving a variety of cuisines under one roof. Looking forward to the next time, eagerly.

Location:located at ballygunj fari and it won't be a hectic thing to find it because it's quite prominent at it's place
Ambience and staff: interiors are dimly lit which goes well with it's tribal theme at the walls with soothing music and a bunch of extremely welcoming staff.It was a friends day out and this place simply served us the cause we were looking out for a rainy evening.
Food and drinks:
For alcoholic drinks it were:the Hitman(which was a bit high to choose),the pain killer and the Terminator(all were perfectly made)
In non alcoholic I personally tried the red grapes and basil twister (this was something too refreshing a lill sweeter perfect for the sweet tooth), cucumber cooler(this is a must try...it seriously gives a jerk of refreshment and a change of mood)
Now for starters we had infu tand ckn sausage (it was sort of sausage kabab which went perfectly with the dip),beer can tempura fish(it was a sort of butter fish fry with the softness of fish and the delicate flavors it wins every fish lovers heart),dajaj charmoula(it's chicken leg pieces kabab sort of,the softness and the flavors are sure to melt your heart),fish-en-papillote,lymwn samak,shish towk(all of these were heavenly bits on plates),
After such wonderful starters we headed for the main course though much space wasn't left in us..we took chicken noodles hakka(it had its own goody flavor and quantity of chicken bits in it was much more),moon faan rice(this had a history which the chef personally recommend and told about it's history of being served in royal place to the pregnant womans which had all the nutrients for the coming baby's good health..and surely it had the simple flavors not enough spicy loaded with chkn and mushrooms..both my favorite served in a dishüòä)
For sides we took chkn in coice of sauces(something in garlic we took)and Hunan fish(the fish preparations simply won my heart here with it's perfection)
Desserts went to heart and so it was a must however full we were
So we had fried ice cream(a highly recommend one),100%jack Daniels and berry callebaut(it was something different in dessert to taste and surely a must try..
This place goes a bit high pinch on pocket but it would fully satisfy every penny spent.

This is a very renowned restaurant which is located just near Hazra Law College, Kolkata.
 This is probably the best experimental cuisine restaurant I have ever visited in Kolkata. The chef has quite a lot experience in various cuisines of Continental Europe, Middle & Far East, and India. All you got to eat here is the outcome of successful experiments of those cuisines.

From the outside it looks like an usual Restro cum bar with an off shop by its side; but step inside, and prepare to be amazed. One thing I really love about this place is the hospitality. They treat you like a king
.¬†

When you get a break from your nine to five routine you ought to make the best utilization of it as I do all the time. Good food is the best reward I treat myself with as the satisfaction is linked to my soul. I believe that the key to ultimate happiness is not dieting but eating whatever your soul craves for .

This place is highly recommended if you are planning for a reunion party with your friends or if you are planning to surprise the love of your life.

From the chef coming down, suggesting you his signature dishes, to explaining each and every cocktail that we ordered. They believe in the entire experience of dining out- presentation, cleanliness, alert waiters, and heavenly food!

The items we had -¬†

Cocktails -

Jet Fuel - Heavenly mix of Beer, Vodka
Kokum Rita - An exotic blend of freshly extracted Kokum Saar, Tiquila and chataka spices. Absolutely good cocktail based on tequila. Those who likes light cocktails must try it.
RDX Cocktail ¬†-¬†
The Terminator -¬†
Cucumber Cooler - Summer Gift for lush cool cucumber , combined with lemonade, vodka & jalapenos.¬†

Starters -¬†

Beer Can Tempura Fish - Most sought after starter. Tempura fish fried in beer batter.
Dajaj Charmoula - The best of the lot. Four grilled chicken leg pieces to long for. Must try.¬†
Fish - En - Papillote - Fish en Papillotte may sound fancy, but it's an easy Paleo dish with fish and vegetables steamed in a sealed paper packet with aromatics and a tasty sauce.
Gushtaba - A delicacy of Kashmir. Minced mutton roundels cooked in Saffron rich Almond Cream.
Lobster Thermidor - Quite good. It comes with butter rice.
Lymnw Samak - Arabic styled Lemon Flavoured grilled fish¬†
Moon Faan - A speciality dating back to The Ming dynasty of Fragrant rice, Chicken and Mushrooms¬†
Pudina Paratha -¬†
Schezwan Chicken -¬†
Sheperds Pie - Two lamb pies comes with butter garlic breads. Though its a British classic, a Lasagna lover will always appreciate it. Must try.

Desserts -¬†

Classic Monte Carlo
Fried Ice Cream
100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut¬†

Hats off to the chef honestly:)¬†

Every dish was rich in flavors, taste and colors. I think this is my favorite Restro henceforth.
 Looking forward crack few more items in my next visit !!

Me and SHREYA have surfed many restaurants together in Kolkata. Being a Continental fan, Spice Kraft comes to the top rank in our list. Can't really find a suitable word that can describe the taste. "Khaiye or kho jaiye" is somewhat close. Must have : 
Starter: Dajaj Chermoula, Beer Can Tempura Fish,
Main Course: Baked Fish Wallington, Lobster Thermidor

Pros - Good ambience; Fantastic food, there are quite a few unique dishes, you can go for the ones already mentioned by other +ve reviewers or can talk directly to the chef (and owner too)- Sambit for his explicit suggestions to match your taste.
Cons - Will pinch your pocket a bit (But if you are ok to pay a price for a taste then I strongly recommend!); quantity served is on a lesser side (if you believe in quantity for an ok food try somewhere else)
Advice - 1)Sambit, can you add some soft jazz / saxophone music to the environment
2) the outside decor should be updated as its simple appearance might go unnoticed

Bonne bouche!

What do you desire more if you are having exquisite delicacies with some best pals and on that way when you make some new friends again, that's just sublime.

Well the occasion was based upon a birthday treat of Shraddha (friend of mine) and including me other five were invited too to make it more bubbly. And it held in Spicekraft near Ballygunge Phari. This place is wonderful with stupendous stewards.

To welcome this occasion and ourselves, we had ordered L.I.I.T for classic boozers and for ladies it was Kiwi and Mango Collins. 

Then gradually we moved towards the starter after getting triggered by some good lexicons got exchanged accompanied by those wonderful liquids; Dajaj Chermoula it was. A dish marinated with chermoula spices and served in earthen pots;. And Lymwn Samak, grilled fish served in Arabic style.

And later for the main course we chose Hari moti polao, cheese naan, Nawab Dum ki Murg, a Lucknow dish; Laal Maas, a dish from Rajasthan made of a fiery on the bone mutton gravy made with whole red chillis and yogurt. And with all these we decreed for the national dish of Indonesia, Nasi Goreng. 

Food was more than delicious, and made us to walk straight as it was tough to bent a little @with full tummy. Thanks Shraddha for such a wonderful moment and tit bit. Hope to get it again. 

Thanks for reading. Follow me on Instagram/ Zomato or chakravarty8supratik.wordpress.com

As the name goes, the restaurant is  truly worthy of it's artsic nomenclature. Not only will you specifically feel the taste of the various fusion flavours in you taste buds the special mention needs to given to this amazing innovations with cockatiels & mocktail s. Not everywhere you find the chef coming you personally to take instant feedback, propose a variety of dishes instantaneously . In a single statement: You are bound to start deeming Spice Kraft you favorite restaurant in Kolkata.

Visited the ever popular Spice Kraft for my birthday dinner with family.
Ambiance is comfy with a simple yet quirky decor resplendent with soothing canned music.
They have carved a niche for themselves in Kolkata for their Asian fusion and global cuisine, innovative food and food presentations, not to forget their awesome tastes.
We ordered the BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH, DAJAJ CHERMOULA for appetiser, SHEPHERD'S PIE, LOBSTER THERMIDOR, KOMBDI CHA TAMBADA RASSA and TANDOORI ROTI for main course and 100% JACK DANIELS & BARRY CALLEBAUT SWISS CHOCOLATE MOUSSE, DRUNKEN PETIT FOURS for dessert.
The BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH, ORANGE PONZU TARTARE was simply the best of the lot. The beer batter coated fish was simply amazing.
DAJAJ CHERMOULA is a Lebanese dish consisting of chicken marinated with chermoula spices and char grilled. This too was delicious and lip smacking, such that we ordered for a second helping.
SHEPHERD'S PIE is their Continental Classic, the old British classic of baked minced lamb with creamed mashed potato crust and served with butter garlic bread. A melt-in-the-mouth lamb preparation leaving some wanting for more.
LOBSTER THERMIDOR was a dish of fresh lobster stuffed with soft creamy lobster meat in cheese and white wine reduction. Mind-blowingly good to taste, it was served with buttered rice and vegetables, in itself a complete hearty dish.
The KOMBDI CHA TAMBADA RASSA was a robust chicken curry from Maharashtra made with hand pounded goda masala, which we accompanied with plain tandoori roti that came in a cute cycle with a basket. The chicken was delish as well, leaving a feel-good taste lingering in the mouth.
The 100% JACK DANIELS MOUSSE - known as a Boozert - was perhaps one of the best desserts I've ever had. Consisting of the chocolate mousse, the orange garnish and sponge cakes (the server kindly advised how to enjoy the dessert the best way) it was a fantastic finishing touch to the splendid dinner we had at Spice Kraft.
For foodies this kitschy restaurant serving lovely cuisines, located close to Hazra Law College, is a MUST TRY, and for those with a nose for some unconventional yet quaint food preparations it is definitely worth a visit! :)

Spice Kraft the new restaurant added in my list and probably the best one till now.

Location- Nearly 2 minutes walk from Ballygunge Phari and yes you are there.

Ambiance- One of the best restaurants in town. The dim light and ear pleasing music will surely make your visit a memorable one. There have table for two and also for group. So go with your partner or with your buddys you don't have to thik about the seating arrangement.

Food- Now let's come to the most important section which is food. And yeah they will not disappoint you. If I have to mention specialy then...

Dejaj Chermoula- Their tasty Lebanese delecasy will increase your appetite with its appearance and smell. If you are going to spice Kraft you should not forget to try this dish.

Nasi Gorag- Their Indonesian speciality which is sufficient for two people is also very good.

You can also try Coc Au Vein.

Cost- You can see the costs from Zomato menu. One thing I can say, prices are reasonable. Your money is not going to be wasted. The food worth it.

"SPICE KRAFT" that is the food mantra that i m chanting all the time.. recently!! Seriously.. bowled over!!üòÇ we made a sudden plan.. date night actually üòÄ and spice kraft made it the best ever.. we dint had to wait 7.30 pm on a week day.. and we were lucky enough to find a table at once. We got a table with miniature trucks containing pepper salt tobasco (such detailsüòç) ..chic decor, cozy place with some fantastic english soft music which i longed for. The staff served us their menu which was in a dilapidated condition( i guess the number of guest that handled it in such shorr period of time was,is huge üòÇüòÇ)
The order:
We were so confused with the drinks.. we asked for suggestions and voila we had 2 of the best cocktails ever and that to a mixture of alcohol of three types in each.. partner had BEER COCKTAIL: tequila+ cointreau+heinekin beer pint .. i absolutely despise beer and he loves it.. bt i m in awe that even i liked a drink with beer !!! And mine was PAIN KILLER: tequila+ cointreau+ vodka(i think) and it was the best cocktail i had .. üòçüòçüòç AND I MEAN IT.. both were priced at 495 inclusive of all taxes
With that we had
DAJAJ CHERMOULA: we all have that recipe for the perfect kebabs bt what lacks is the right amoumt of smokiness that home kebabs get a miss and the softness that 'parar kebab er dokan' doest provide and this has it all.. just melts in ur mouth !!
BEER BATTERED FISH: AMOUNT was not expected!! It was huge for both of us and sinful !! Crunchy outside and softest fish inside .. so good (only downside a bit oily bt thats totally forgivable..i wud recommend to somehow soak the extra oil after frying if possible and then serve)
Last LYMWN SAMAK: ARABIAN fish with the lightest marinade and yet so so flavourful and wonderful presentation needless to say :)
There dips also need special mention with varieties in taste and colour in almost everyone ..
We were so full that we skipped main course bt dessert was onn - boozert 100percnt jack daniels ..the cakes with the mousse plus the orange glaze: what combination!!( ppl who donot like alcohol may not like this though)
We are defintly goin back asap!! Spice kraft has won my heart and soul and brain .. and everything
I need to try there coq a vin, lobster thermidor, chicken in oyster sauce and mushroom, pork rendang, lamb masaman and all the cocktails(they are so innovative).. absolute genius with french@ cooking method and asian spices and that is Fusion folks !!
Keep up the good work.. ever helping staff who recommends the right dishes for everyone and that has to be their signature dishes üòäüòäüòâ
Gst of 18 prcnt and no extra service charge .. u get much more than what u pay .. keep up the good work SPICE KRAFT ... strongly recommended

Well, starting with ambience, this restaurant does provide a good ambience. They've a nice playlist of musical tunes. Food was great too. Nice staff service. The only thing which was awkward was the way they were staring when we were clicking photos. Else, I would have given a full 5.

The land of Asia has always been replete with the freshness of natural as well as healthy flavours. The subtle yet delightful delicacies of Asia have been gradually conquering hearts. One more place which is all set to win hearts and has an equally exquisite name is SpiceKraft.

Vibrant mirrors, dim lights and a pretty casual vibe is what welcomes you the moment you set your foot here.

No doubt, I'm all set to start my journey in this appropriately 4.8 rated restaurant in Kolkata.
Stepping into this place and looking into the pieces of artwork and colour schemes, it gives you an undercover vibe too.
We pretty much liked the setup out here. And the hospitality was top knotch, I must say.

As the menu suggests, "Asian Heritages : French Techniques" - Unlike the so called fusion ( or confusion ) cuisine, the starters are a reflection of the Chef's style and kraft of blending in the fine techniques and style of the French cuisine, without compromising the robustness and authenticity of the ancient traditional heritage cuisines of Asia.

We started off with the Beer Can Tempura Fish which was definitely a good start indeed. It was stuffed with a whole lot of spices and the dip they served along with it was the main reason behind it's awesome flavour. The dip has been named Orange Ponzu Tartar√® which can also be prepared without Beer Batter too. The texture and the smoothness of the delicacie was on point.
If fish is the choice you make, then definitely this is one hell of a dish.

The next dish was the Bacardi Limon infused Tandoori Chicken sausages served with Churan and Blueberry Coulis. The mesmerizing flavour of Tandoori and the Bacardi Limon meddled well to give a great taste overall. The softness of the Chicken turned out to be a delicious surprise for us. With each bite of the sausage, it reminded us of the great classic comfort flavour of sausages. We loved the dish.

It was followed by Shish Taouk. The first bite made it simply evident that the chicken was marinated in cream and zatar spice and was grilled on slow flame. The esssence and the uniqueness of the dish gave a clear indication to the fact that it was a Lebanese dish. The chicken was cooked pretty well and turned out to be a treat to the tongue.

The Dajaj Charmoula and the Lymwm Samak both being dishes from Lebanon were equally elegant and lived upto their terms as promised.
"No tweaks, No twists, Simply Authentic."

The former was a dish which comprised of chicken marinated with chermoula spices and char grilled. Not too spicy or too bland, it didn't need any extra seasoning than it was present already. We absolutely loved the dish.

The latter dish was an Arabic Style lemon flavoured grilled Fish. As I already mentioned above, the fish delicacies are beyond praise. Each and every fish item is heavenly. It had a great texture and the touch of spicy deliciousness which made it even better.
For the mains we tried their Haka Noodles, Moon Faan, Chicken in Manchurian Sauce and Hunan Fish.

The Haka Noodles was a simple dish as the name suggests. Soulful yet comforting dish. The noodles would win hearts absolutely with the Chicken Manchurian as the side dish making the combination fantastic!

The Moon Faan had a speciality dating back to The Ming Dynasty of Fragrant Rice, Chicken and Mushrooms. The rice was served perfectly boiled and food touched our hearts. Pairing it with the Hunan Fish by its side, the duo turned out to be drool-worthy.
The food and the side dishes definitely go hand in hand and we loved the dishes.

In the beverage section, I opted for Hitman. As the name suggests, the drink has a strong alcoholic taste with a blend of orange tincture. The balance was definitely nice and it was worth a try indeed due to it's uniqueness. Loved the drink totally and upon telling the staff to make it a bit dilute, the task was done within the wink of an eye. Hats-off to the staff as well. Being not so simple but slurpy it was rejuvenating.

Moving on to the dessert section, the Fried Ice-cream was a speciality. Created with love, this dish tasted amazing and left us craving for more.

Next was the 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse. As the name suggests, the alchohol and the chocolate turned out to be a great combination. The higher proportion of chocolate was just enough to flavour it as it always works. This is definitely a must try. A newest form of dessert, I must say.

Overall, the quality and the quantity of all the items turned out to be damn perfect. The service, the decor, the food, the ambience, everything was totally on point convincing me to rate it a 5.0 ! If you're looking for a place to suffice your weekend as well as weekday meals, this surely should top your list.

P.S : Due to poor lighting condition, pictures attached are not upto the mark. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Ambience : 5/5
Taste Quotient : 5/5
Service : 5/5

Thanks,

Would've rated it 4.5 but I've my reasons. Food is great, no question. But there are some basic loopholes in service that I experienced the day I visited. 

Firstly, we had a lot of flies buzzing around the table. Not an ideal situation at an eatery. Secondly, some of the sides were served without the staple dish. So the order in which the dishes came in was a bit weird. That's why the rating.

Coming to the food, every dish tasted great. We started with the Roast Pork in Rendang Curry. Good taste, especially with the pieces of bacon. Next up, Squid Rings in Butter Garlic. Again, great taste. In between we had some Kebabs which I don't remember the name of. Finally we had some Fried Rice with Hunan Fish and Manchurian Fish. Again, these dishes were good.

It was in my bucket list for such a long time. Finally ticked off !!!
Being a resident of Picnic Garden, its very near to my place. The location is just opposite of quadra diagnostic lab in hazra road.
I went there yesterday for lunch with one of my friend.
The person standing in the entrance took my umbrella and welcomed me inside.
We were taken to our table. The ambience was perfect to set the mood with dim blue lights and romantic tunes in the background. If you are planning to take your beloved out on a date, this place should be it.
Well, coming to the Starters, we ordered Beer Can Tempura fish - Its a common bhetki fish fry given inside a beer can for unique presentation served with orange ponzu tartare dip. A little oily but taste wise it was simply best.
BACARDI LIMON INFUSED TANDOORI CHICKEN SAUSAGES - Chicken sausages cooked in tandoor style. To make the dish innovative, a dropper containing bacardi limon is infused in it and presented alongside churan and blueberry coulis dip. Its first time i tasted something so innovative.

Main Course : GRILLED FISH WITH LEMON BUTTER SAUCE - My friend ordered this as she is a fish lover. The dish contains grilled bhetki¬† served with mushrooms, vegetables and butter rice. Trust me the fish tasted scrumptious. It was perfectly cooked.

SHEPHERD'S PIE - I ordered this as i wanted to try lamb. One word for this, HEAVEN !!! Its the best thing i had overall. Its baked minced lamb with cheese mashed potato crust, served with garlic bread. If you are a lamb fan, you gonna enjoy it till the last bite.

Desert : JACK DANIELS SWISS CHOCOLATE MOUSSE - Its a recommended dish. The waiter serving our table mentioned this one to be one of their specialty and he was not lying !!! Its the perfect end to your meal. One is enough for two, I am not gonna say how it tasted because common guys, go to this place and try it and check it out yourself. You will not be disappointed. ¬†

Cocktails : The waiter suggested Hitman for me as i wanted something in whiskey . Its a cocktail made out of bourbon whiskey. It will hit you slowly and steadily and the ambience will do the rest ;)

Pain killer ‚Äì The server recommended my friend this one as she is into vodka. He explained her the ingredients. Its made of cranberry vodka with margarita. The way she reacted after having it made me come to this conclusion that the drink well soothed her.

One thing need to be mentioned that on the weekends, the place remains closed for two hours from 4pm to 6pm. So if you are planning out to go for lunch on weekends, make sure you reach by 3. I visited around 3 and the waiter told me to give my order all at once which was little difficult for me because i spend too much time on the menu card. But yes the attendant will help you to order. We HAD TO¬† finish our lunch by 4:10 pm as the attendant was constantly reminding me of the time.

Finally the bill came out to be Rs 2506 which is very much pocket friendly keeping in mind both the cocktails costed Rs 990.

The reason i gave 5 rating is because of the innovation the chef bring into each food items and most importantly the courteous behavior of the attendants. This kind of decent and helpful attitude by the servers are hardly seen in most of the restaurants which is why i am gonna visit this place again.

A rating of 4.8 in more than 1800 reviews says it all. We visited SpiceKraft for lunch. As we came in early the restaurant was relatively empty only to be packed by the time we left. So the first point here, the wait staff was asked by us if we could be seated beside the window and they complied with a smile. The restaurant interiors is simply amazing, reflecting the blend of Western and Indian as in their cuisines. One thing that surprised me was the Menu. Not the contents... The physical state of the Menu. It was battleraged, pages folded coming apart and it was a mess. First reaction... Ewww.

Then the food arrived and the mood changed. To kick off we had a Deconstructed Papdi Chaat filler. I was a bit skeptical about it but the wait staff explained about what it is and also helped us out on its arrival. Its a one shot wonder... And lingers on your taste buds for long after. Up next was the Beer Can tempura fish... With its amazing orange tartare sauce. To follow it up, the Dajaj Chermoula. Both dishes were amazing. The batter was crisp and seasoned to perfection and the fish just melted in mouth. The smoked Chermoula was a delight and its presentation made all the difference. We also had virgin mojito and an Mango Drink to go with it. The portion sizes are amazing for the price. Finally followed it up with a Shepard's Pie, which was classic and as authentic as it can get served with itd perfect  partner,  some garlic bread.

I definately recommend Spicekraft for a lunch or dinner experience. The food delectable and service is as amazing as it can be. The Menu Card however... That has to come new or change :). But most certainly it is one of THE places to eat in Kolkata

Also, most certainly, I am coming back.

It looked like a small quiet place outside the hustle-bustle of the city. The interior adds up to the charm (maybe your appetite as well )
 A small cosy place with awesome service, innovative menu and delicious food. Everything that you will expect of a place with a decent 4.8 rating on Zomato.
But , in the end they really deserve all the accolade. 
We will meet again.

Went there for a Sunday lunch and was really satisfied by their food and service.
We sat in the outer section and the decoration of this part was really sophisticated.
We ordered it's signature dishes.. Chicken dajaj charmoula, beer can tempura fish, mixed chow and roast pork in rendang curry. The chicken charmoula was delicious. Beer can tempura fish is just fish tempura served in a beer can. It was a little bit more oily but taste and quality wise it was top-notch.
Coming to the main course I found the mixed chow not so remarkable but the pork curry cooked in coconut lemon base was yummy.
Overall we had a really good experience. This time couldn't try their cocktails but we'll definitely try them in our next visit.

Situated on Hazra road..very easy to locate. Ambience is nice and the staffs were also cordial. Now coming to food we ordered their signature beer can tempura fish and dajaj charmoula. Both the dishes were melt in mouth super awesome. The fish was a tad bit oily but the taste more than makes up for it. I did not personally like the dips though. We had the sish taouk as well...it is a Lebanese dish. For main course we had shepherd's pie, coq au vin and baked fish Wellington. I would surely go back for more.

Zomato has a 4.8 rating for this restaurant and we had been trying to get a table at this place for almost a month but were always told they are fully booked.. So the hype got built up.. Finally we had lunch here today and were unfortunately extremely disappointed. The wait time after ordering was unacceptable.. Almost an hour. The starters were presented very nicely but tasted OK. We had a mutton haleem kibbeh which the server explained was haleem cooked to dry and then used to make kababs. And we had a fish starter which was deep fried with a batter.for main course we had fish moilee where the sand fish we had for starter was put in the gravy and served. And we had ordered goshtaba and got four mutton keema balls in a white sweet gravy. The mutton balls had the same mix that the haleem kibbeh had. And all this took an hour to serve since we ordered. Never going again. And zomato should look into how the rating is so high.. Some doctored ratings for sure.

This restaurant had been on my wishlist for quit a long time.. so as soon as I got an opportunity didn't want to miss it .....
Its nice small cosy restaurant with a subtle ambience....
We ordered 
dajaj charmoula.... 5/5 simply awesome....tasty succulent pieces of chicken prepared to perfection 
Squid rings in butter garlic... 5/5 very tasty and spicy
Beer can tempura fish... 3/5 this was disappointing... didn't like the bitter aftertaste...
Lobster thermidor.... 4.5/5 this was also amazing where they served a portion of herb rice a lobster where the meat was cooked in cheesy white sauce accompanied by boiled vegetable which was a disappointing part of the dish as it was not even  tossed in butter which  made it  bland

Overall one should visit this restaurant if u are a foodie...

I had read and heard great things about this place so I had to check it out as one of the last places during my stay at Kolkata. Except for that one persistent fly which refused to leave me alone, the food and drinks were great. 

The Jamun Mary was exceptionally delicious. I would not have ordered it if they were making the classic Bloody Mary which I wanted initially. I have never been happier that a place  ran out of Bloody Marys. üòÖ

Appetizers were my personal favorite. We had to try the beer battered fried fish which lives up to its reputation. The surprise knockout were the "Kele ke phool ke croque monsieur". I have never had something so unique and delectable as an appetizer which essentially comes from the mocha. 

Three main courses were ordered. Coq-Au-Vin (roast chicken in red wine jus), Lobster Thermidor (lobster meat in cheese and wine reduction), and a vegetarian entr√©e whose name I do not know because it was suggested by staff there. The chicken and lobster were exceptionally good. 

By now we were so full there was no room for dessert. So maybe next time? Great work Spice Kraft!

That was in our hitlist for a long time. Our ordered menu sorted by rating descending -

Hong Shao Rou : Pork tenderloin basically. Couldn't interpret the sauce. But this was the best one among all.

Beer Can Tempura Fish : Innovative, never experienced this kind of fish dish before. I recommend you should have it too.

Bacardi Lemon Infu Tand Chicken Sausage : Mild Bacardi flavour you will experience but I didn't like the chicken.

Pork Ribs : This is listed in their chef's special. They recommend it but disappointed us. It was very dry and less in quantity.

My friend out of the blue called up at noon and while chatting over the phone we ended up with a lunch plan that day itself in her recommended restaurant that is Spice Kraft...this was back in April this year..

I was at that time already out with another friend of mine at a cafe but still did not wish to cancel the following lunch plan hence met her near Balligunge Phari Petrol Pump around 2pm...

The restaurant is a few meters walk through the bylane keeping the petrol pump to the left....she had already visited the the place twice beforehand and was in all praise for it...

The eatery was full once we entered as it was peak lunch time thus had to wait a bit at a spare table until they managed a proper seating table for two of us. The look and feel of the place reflected grandeur and lustre.. They provided a glass of water each and made us comfortable even before the table was managed..later we shifted...

We ordered Dajaj Chermoula and Beer Can Tempura Fish..my friend said these two were the hottest selling items of this joint off late thus instinctively I welcomed her bid...

Beer Can Tempura Fish was an Entree dish where the fish fries came inside a Beer Can giving the simple starter a quirky look which the present generation is all about... There came with a dip which complemented the fries very well...No doubt both of us were in awe for the item, fish was soo succulent, delicious and yum...loved every bit...

Dajaj Chermoula is a Chicken dish where four small size leg pieces came inside four bowls giving the dish a classy touch..there came sauces with it to add a zing..We both enjoyed this one too..

As it is I was full from my cafe visit and then having these two dishes made me super saturated thus left the desire of trying other items for later visits...

Hospitality of the restaurant executives was tremendously warm and noticeable...looking forward for encounters to follow...

Absolutely recommended...

Prices on the higher scale..

Very impressive food, indeed..  Not the best of ambience, the tables get rather cramped when the food is served. The loveliest things are the food and the cocktails! 
We loved their Hazelnut heaven and blue electric. 
Notwithstanding the beer can tempura fries being a bit too oily, they were really nice! 
So were the dajaj charmoula, soft and succulent roasted chicken legs. 
The shepherd pie was was great, although given the creamy texture created by minced lamb and cheese, the tougher boiled peas didn't really go well with it. They can do away with peas in the pie! 
We rounded it off with the most amazing jack daniels mousse.. 
Shall visit to try other things..

A good place for those who savour over continental delicacies. Just make an early reservation to get a good seat. The ambience was not that great. I visited the place only based on zomato reviews so i had really high expectations not just with regard to their food but also with regard to their set up. I thought it would be a complete package but i was wrong. Also they seriously needs to see & check the hygiene of their toilet.

Anyways coming to food we ordered the Dajaj chermoula as starter which was basically chicken drumsticks but white in colour. Taste wise it was good but nothing out of the world and moreover the chutney they serve it with was extremely sweet. I wish they had added something tangy to balance the dish. Next we ordered the lobster thermidor which came with sauteed veggies and rice and it was an absolute delight. Super tasty and i was left craving for more. Next was the fish with cheese which failed to impress me and my friend who happens to love fish. There was way too much of cheese or cream over it that made her feel overdosed and squimish.

Price wise the restaurant is really affordable and the staffs are good. Most importantly they have innovative dishes which are not just a delight for the eyes but also is a delight taste wise.

Food was too good and tasty. Please note we didn't go for all but ordered as per recommendations by the restaurant itself. Everything we had was just yummy. Shepherd's pie is a must try and off course Jack Daniels.
Beer Can Tampura fish is another thing, yes it do contains oil but well its damn tasty.We booked the table beforehand to avoid rush in weekend evening. Next time I would like to experiment as per my choice, sea food specially and get back with another review may be.

Yesterday evening three of Us planned to spend our Saturday Evening at Spice Kraft. Two of Us reached there at 6.50pm and asked for a table of 3. The staffs reconfirmed whether the third person is coming or not. We humbly said he is on his way. Hence the offered Us a table of 4. We said we would like to sit inside or some other table which they said may not be comfortable for Us. Still we said that will manage as they denied to offer any table inside any of the rooms. We settled down and asked for a Chicken Strongoff and decided to wait for our another friend. They took near about 20mins to serve the food. As the food came to table, I asked for some Tobasco and Orageno. One of the staff,named Vikash ( as encrypted on his batch ) came back with the Tobasco . As orageno didn't came, my friend went to the staffs and again asked for the same. Then Vikash came back and said ' Plate r side e egulo orageno ' pointing out the orageno which they used for decor of the dish. We were distrubed with this type of behave from such a renowned Restaurant in our city. On the top of that the person came and told us that the Table we were sitting was reserved. We said why didn't they mentioned it earlier?? And it was only 7.23pm at that point of time, so we were there for 30mins. We called the Manager in charge. He came and claimed we were sitting for 45min without our third friend. He denied to hear any feedback from us and began to say that we bluffed saying the third one will come. Actually none will come we just blocked the four seater table for our pleasure and relaxation. We still requested him to listen to us but he said he knew the problem. Then we asked is this the right behaviour of Vikash to say that manage the orageno from the side of the plate? Then Vikash explained he just said like that he would have served it later. When would have he served?? After we were done? Then my friend asked him how long is he at hotel industry ... he answered 20years. We laughed and asked his age as he looks hardly of early 30s or late 20s. He was embarrased and after stammer he managed to answer he is 35years. Which means he is working from 15years. This is my humble request to the management of Spice Kraft to better off their staff quality. They must have minimun curtesy and education which will be beneficial for them, if what Vikash said it true. Though I really doubt Vikash's words.
@
This type of behaviour from such a restaurant is not expected. The food was also so so which we ordered. We couldn't ordered anything else as we were pissed off and clear our bill and left the place with grievance. We will never go back to this restaurants and will never recommand this to anyone!!

Spice kraft took us on quite a gastronomical adventure . We started off with the molecular mocktail - deconstructed papdi chat. The 'drink' looked very intriguing and on closing the eyes, I could feel the bubbles of flavour bursting on my tongue. A very novel experience, it was. Next up was the tangy mandarin and lemongrass shocker, which the waiter aerated in front of us.
For the starter, we went with bombyl koliwada, which was basically lotte fish fried in a batter. This was followed by moo fan rice and lamb in masaman curry. The lamb for me, was a clear stand-out - just melt-in-the-mouth tender and very beautifully complemented by the lemon-grass flavour.  The meal was ended on a high note by the classic monte carlo and the much-anticipated 'boozert', jack Daniels mousse with drunken petit fours. The latter is probably one of the best desserts I have tasted in my life. 
The ambience is very pleasant with the soft lights, and the slow songs. The waiter was polite and competent, helping us navigate through the elaborate menu.

A long time after being bookmarked in my Zomato list, finally visited Spice Kraft. Located near Ballygaunge Phari.. few blocks apart from Mio Amore, Sugar and Spice and Sharma's Tea, towards Hazra. We have visited iin the evening around 6:45 and found almost filled up. Luckily we got our table almost immediately. I was kind of determined about food menu and already selected them in my mind but drinks menu is bit confusing. So we decided to go for a suggestions from the staff. As per their suggestions we have ordered the following:
1. Hitman
2. Pain Killer
3. Dajaj Charmoula
4. Beer Can Tampura Fish
5. Pork Ribs Burrah Kabab
  First two are mocktails.. presented nicely .. Hitman actually hit me some way or around.. Hard one.
  Dajaj Charmoula was fantastic and represented kraftly.
  Beer Can Tampura fish contains quality fish and lots of Oil.(Actually huge amount of oil which I dislike). These two starters accompanied with a Mousse kind sauce which i find tasteless and needless coz the foods are so tasty i doesn't require such thing.
 Pork Ribs Burrah Kabab was awesome and accompanied with Tamarind kind Chatni which perfectly matched with the dish. A good buy.
 Finally the Service.. One word.. I am overwhelmed with their courteous behavior and family like feeling. Pork ribs burrah kabab was actually suggested by them. And the pocket pinch.. all the above mentioned @ Rs. 1834. 
 I would definitely to give a second visit to taste their kraft...üëå

This will be only the second time I'm rating a place 5 stars, and also the first time for a place in Kolkata!

This place was an absolute revelation. 

They have not gone all out to make the ambience super posh or anything, just plain comfortable and with ample seating arrangement. Staff is superb - helped us all the way to select our menu, and even showed us how best to have some of their damn innovative items! 

Most impressive menu. They call it an Asian Fusion Restaurant, but it's much more than that. Each item is so innovative, so different and so funky, that you could find yourself sitting with the menu card for a long time, unable to make a decision. 

We ordered molecular mojitos - made with the fun sounding molecular mixology technique - Red Grape/Basil and Aam Panna / Curry Patta. Word of advice - alcohol content in their cocktails is a little higher than your standard cocktails, so you could be in for a bit of a kick. 

For entree, we chose Bacardi Lemon infused Tandoori Chicken Sausages with Blueberry Coulis - EXCELLENT! You dip the tandoori masala encrusted sausage in the creamy blueberry sauce, put it in your mouth, and then empty the dropper full of Bacardi Lemon into your mouth - pure delight!

Went the Indian way for main course. Rumali Ruti and Pudina Paratha. Dahi Khaam Khatai - Kashmiri Dahi Kabab with cottage cheese, served with onions and green chutney. Gushtaba - a Kashmiri dish, minced mutton balls in a creamy saffron gravy. Each dish was delectable to say the least.

Dessert was special. They call it Boozert - booze infused desserts, and they are a treat. We went for the Jack Daniels infused chocolate mousse, served with homemade sponge cakes and orange toffee reduction. 

It's like more than lunch, it was a fun activity. The funky mini truck which serves as salt and pepper stand, the mini cycle van on which they serve the rotis and parathas, the cocktails mixed live on your table - it's so much fun. What I found best, though, was that it is absolutely value for money - the prices are completely reasonable, and hence makes it a perfect place to bring friends and family along for a fun hangout.

Outstanding, and most, most recommended!

This was my second visit to Spicekraft and they did not, as usual, leave me disappointed. Tempura fish in a beer can and Dajaj Charmoula was definitely my starters, followed by Coq¬†au¬†vin¬†and Chicken Stoganoff for the main course. I would recommend others to try the Jack Daniel Mousse too. This time I would specially thank one of your staff who had recommended the cocktail for me - Terminator with a Beer Base. It was totally awesome. Thank you once again for your wonderful service. Keep innovating and keep serving us so warmly.

We visited spice kraft on friday afternoon, the restaurant was quite empty so we didn't have to wait.. its no way overpriced or over rated.. 1200 for 2 is quite justified and cheap compared many other restaurants.
FOOD:
1: beer can tempura fish(starter)- they serve six pieces of fish in a half beer can,with a dip sauce. Well cooked.. melts as soon as you put it in your mouth and tastes good.
2:moon faan(main course)- rice loaded with chicken,mushroom and egg, served enough for 2 people.
3:shreded lamb in masaman curry ( side dish)- lamb cooked like never before... the curry was so creamy that it stimulates your taste buds to a great extent..
4: lobster thermidor- best lobster that any can ever taste in town. Every layer has it own taste..(MUST HAVE)

AMBIENCE:
Simple decoration with best music collection.. soft lighting.. well behaved waiters..

EVERYTHING ABOUT THE RESTAURANT IS AWESOME...
Must try...

I know the owner/head chef of this place personally and firstly,I would appreciate him for the menu he has set up.
It's my target to try every thing that's there in the menu.
It's a must visit and food is surely mind blowing.
I will not suggest any dish to try here.as soon as someone goes through the menu,they l know that they are up for a surprise.and I can guarantee,that surprise will make u happy.
The cost is a bit on higher side,but it's a COMPLETE VALUE FOR MONEY. :)

They have a very friendly chef who takes care of your taste buds very successfully‚Äã... He recommended us a dessert...fried ice cream...its chef special..wont find it  a in the menu card..and it's LOVELY!! 
If not for anything else...visit this place for this dessert itself and you won't be disappointed! 
Be it chinese be it mughlai be it continental...they prepare each cuisine genuinely good!! 
A reputation well-earned! 
What I didn't like was their menu card... All of them are completely battered!

This is located near quest mall. The ambience or this place is marvelous. We had to wait for more than 30mins to get a table. Bt it was worth the wait. We ordered murg reshmi malai for starters and for main course we ordered nasi goreng and chicken manchurian. The food was delicious. After that we ordered a cocktail. The service was good but somewhat rude. And moreover they did some mistakes with our bill. They were taking 1600 instead of 800. Should be more careful. Still it's a nice place to spend your afternoon or evening.

This place have been in my bucket list for a long time. Finally visited this place on Saturday afternoon for lunch with a friend to celebrate a special occasion. Ambience-: Interior is done aesthetically. Even though the place is not very big but the space management is done smartly.

Service-: The men who are in this job are fair enough yet not being a pro they help you to feel comfortable.

Food:- food here is a complete piece of art. We ordered LYMWM SAMAK which is a preparation of grilled fish that was soft, mildly spiced and melt in the mouth dish. The dip that came with it was so good that I requested to repeat it for second time and they happily did so. Next we ordered DAJAJ CHARMOULA. 4 smokey flavoured leg pieces each presented in China clay mugs.It tasted okay. They were a bit slow with the cocktails we ordered. LIIT and Bellini. While LIIT was very good and strong Bellini was perfect for light drinkers. Next came another inhouse signature BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH. 6 pieces of battered fish which was crispy and light, but a tad bit oily. For mains, we took SHEPERD'S PIE. This dish was done brilliantly.The minced meat had a creamy texture with a hint of cheese accompanied by garlic bread.

Now lastly the showstopper 100% JD Barry Callebaut dessert. They named it boozert(brownie points to the name). This came in a rectangular tray type serving dish. Four pieces of sponge cake dipped in alcohol and 2 dollops of liquor infused chocolate mousse. Not to forget the orange jelly that was spread across the tray. We were told that the jelly was made by liquifying orange favoured lozenze. It was a pure Bliss for the taste buds!! Indeed a stand out dish.
Thanks to the thoughtful mind of the chef and owner Mr. Banik..!!
Overall a nice experience. Hope to visit this place soon to try out more dishes.
Highly recommended to the food enthusiasts of this city. Happy Eating!!

Located near the Ballygunge Phari More, Spice Kraft is moderately spaced restaurant with a lovely ambience for a date night or with your near and dear ones. The place is very popular as indicated by the long queue we were greeted with on arrival. We had to wait for an hour approximately before getting a seat for ourselves. So I would recommend people to either arrive with adequate time in hand or make a reservation beforehand. We had Beer Can Tempura Fish for starters and a had a continental meal of Coq-Au-Vin and Shepherd's Pie. I had heard a lot of good things about the Beer Can Tempura Fish from fellow reviewers in Zomato and sure it did not disappointed. It is a remarkably fantastic way to recycle beer cans and use them to present a fantastic dish by the Spice Kraft management and chefs. The dish was delicious with the contents seeming to melt and is a must try for all. The Coq-Au-Vin was another very good dish and was well made. It was presented well as well and made for a good main dish. The Shepherd's Pie was not as good as our expectations but made for a good complement as well. At the end of the day, we were too full and were satisfied and rather enjoyed our time at Spice Kraft. May make another visit here soon.

Had to visit this place as the name is in air. Now that everyone is aware of the signature dishes , they are worth many tries. This is the ultimate place of food diversity.This is the kind of place where you take the first bite and you know that you are in the right place.Not only that but the decor and hospitality is also at per. Everything here is reasonably priced. LIIT was good. The 100% JD mousse will give you a happy ending with a hint to head back to this place again and again.

Had high hopes for this place but frankly it turned out to be a bit disappointing. It's air conditioned but there's flies roaming around.
Tried the huong suon for entree, which was Vietnamese style BBQd & caramelised baby pork ribs. It was tasty, but too bony.
For main course we tried the chicken stroganoff which looked visually pleasing but fell short of delivering on flavour.
The Jack Daniels infused chocolate mousse with spongecake & orange jelly was good & perfectly balanced. The fried ice cream was delicious as well.
Management & service was a bit casual and lacklustre.

Being a foodie, Spice Kraft has made my taste buds really happy. Right from the presentation to the mouth watering tastes of all the delicacies of spice kraft, everything about this place is so far, perfect. Even the service is professional and ambience is good. The way the manager explains the process of the food items being is made is something I am quite impressed about. I just love the food and drinks! In love with this place... There are a large number of options to choose from weather it is starters,main course or dessert.... The waiters were also very cooperative and friendly but service is quite slow... All in all am enjoyable experience and everything is perfect about this place....

Had heard a lot about this place and tried it out today. The owner's career graph is truly brilliant and inspiring. Coming to the restaurant and food, hygiene is pretty low, there's flies all around. The menus are all tattered which is a shame since the menu holds an amalgamation of famous dishes from all around the world. There's Asian, Continental, Indian Mughlai. Being low on budget we tried the baby pork ribs for starter. The pork pieces were too bony which was a let down though the sauce was delicious. Next we went for chicken stroganoff. It was creamy chicken like it promised but a bit bland for people grown up relishing kebabs. For desserts we tried the Jack Daniels infused chocolate mousse served with an orange jelly. The chef seemed the perfect jugaaru, having produced the orange jelly by reducing a simple orange jelly lozenge. We loved the preparation consisting of white sponge cake to balance the chocolate and the orange. We also tried out the fried ice-cream and totally loved it. Want to visit again to try out the rest of the menu.

This place was bookmarked since a long time. Seeing their menu and reviews I was adamant that my partner and I would have our anniversary dinner here. We had our reservations done. I expected this place to be a bit bigger in space, nevertheless we were given a table for two which they had reserved. As soon as you enter the restaurant you notice the soothing dim lighting and their little details like the beautiful glasses decorated with the napkins. This place is known for its service as well as its offbeat menu. Their service is too good to be true. I was so impressed by their enthusiasm in suggesting drinks as well as the food. So we ordered three kinds of Martinis, each distinctively different from the other, accompanied by Chicken charmola. I loved the right amount of smoky flavour in the chicken charmola which was again complimented by a dip. This was followed by our second round of drinks and starters, 2 captain morgans along with Beer can tempura fish. The fish prepartion was not only well presented, but also,it was lip-smacking, the softness of the fish combined with the crunchiness of the batter and the sweet dip just made it better. Moving on to the main course, we chose roasted pork in rendang curry which was a Malaysian delicacy along with rice as the waiter proposed. As soon as it arrived my partner and I recognised an extremely familiar aroma. It's been a month since we have been back from our Goa holiday and with the first bite of the roast pork, it felt like we were back at the Baga beach shack having Goan fish curry, just pork instead of the fish. The roast pork definitely overpowered the rice and to be honest I don't mind at all. Last but not the least, this place specializes in desserts, we couldn't have left without tasting atleast one of them. We went for the Jack Daniels mousse. The subtle JD flavour in the mousse and the sponge cakes were the perfect ending we wished for. This place has swept me off my feet and I am so glad that I chose this place for our anniversary dinner. Our total bill was Rs 1900 and our dinner was a 'paysa wasool' one. I highly recommend this place to everyone in kolkata, trust me you won't regret it.

P.S: A bottle of bisleri costs Rs.20. Didn't expect it to be just the exact price.

Located behind the petrol pump at "Ballygunje Phari" a pretty small and cosy place.
Starting with the review we went as a group of 4 people on a wednesday evening.
Pros:
1.Quality of food is excellent.
2.Price is reasonable.
3.Ambience is perfect. (Perfect place to take your partner on a date).
4.Interior decoration and lighting is beautiful.
5.Quantity is just about filling your appetite so cant say less niether more.
Cons:
1.Service is a bit slower.
2.The entry to this place is pretty unorganised.Unlike other places it works on word of mouth rather than a formal written booking.So we had to wait long enough to be inside.
3.Happy hours are pretty unpredictable.As we were planning to have a tower of beer but was unavailable on a wednesday which is unexpected.

Overall its a new place for many people are oblivious of it.But,being such highly rated on zomato itself the food was really good.So i would suggest all to try out this for the continental dishes and even cocktails which are pretty cheap than many other hangouts.

We had ordered Coq-Au-Vin (specaility of this place) ,Mixed cantonese noodles,Chilli pork in the main course and in starters Beer dipped fish fries (bhetki) which was marvellous.We didnt had "Dajaj Chermouli" which is actually chicken drumsticks dipped prepared in a manner using alcohol for taste.Please try that when you go, even that's the speciality here.
This place uses alcohol in most of their dishes to give u a different taste altogether.So have a go and enjoy !!!!!!!!

This is a hidden gem in calcutta, it is a restaurant that calls to all the food enthusiasts across the city to celebrate the diversity of food through its amazing array of dishes featured on its menu.
From the outside it looks like any other small eatery. But i found a long queue waiting to get a table here.
Fortunately,i had booked the tables before so didn't have to waitüòú.
Coming the food we ordered-
1.Soy braised drums of heaven with old monk flamb√®( to me this tasted good but my significant other found this outstanding)
2. Coq-au-vin ( a classical continental dish which is served with parsley butter rice, the chicken was very tender,the sauce was silk smooth and the taste bang on. The mushrooms shallots and chicken cooked with red wine and served with rice was a full meal in itself)
3. Chicken stroganoff( they serve this classical russian delicacy with bread rolls but i specifically ordered ours to be served with butter rice because thats how i m accustomed to having itüòú. The sauce here was very creamy the white wine added an extra edge to the flavour and the chicken cubes wre quite tender.)
100% jack daniels mousse ( well, this beauty will feature in my list of top 5 dessert i have had till now. The mousse is very delicious and goes perfectly with the orange jelly and the cakes served along with it.)
We also ordered 2 cocktails as this place is well known for its molecular gastronomy.
Terminator (whisky based cocktail which is quite strong)
Painkiller( vodka tequila nd contreau based cocktail, it was my favourite)
These cocktails are not there in the menu but made on special request and recommendations.
Coming to the service though it was clumsy in the beginning but the waiters were very obliging their suggestions were extremely good and hospitality excellant. The food was served on time.
Their dajaj cheromoula is also very good. Though m going to have it some other time. The menu needs more exploration by me. Till then keep krafting these jewels from your kitchen. Great work!!

When you are in kolkata and you don't do food hopping it's a waste .. what I appreciate about this   Place is that the ambience is pretty different and pretty cool ... the outside ambience was of more of casual type ... where as the inside sitting arrangements was of fine Dinning type ... the place was vibrant and there was something about this place .. As their restaurant name is different so is the place .. what I understood about this spice kraft is that , they have few signatures dish like BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH, DAJAJ CHARMOULA , LYMWN SAMAK , and among cocktails, their signature dish is PAIN KILLER , LIQUID BOMB to name a few  . These are the signature dish which they recommend to each and every customer who visit ... this happens why I will explain because the food menu of spice kraft is very complicated and it confused me also , I almost spent 20 min in understanding the concept.... finally after fatiguing the brain I decided to ask them what they recommends .... they recommend their signature dishes... This particularly happens with every food peddler visiting spice kraft and finally spice kraft serves them their best signature dish which makes every one super impressed... I really appreciate the technique and the sales quality to sell their food and making customers happy after a tasty meal . That's very important. Taste, presentation , everything was really exceptional..... I ordered few dish apart from their signature dish , and that was GREEN CHILLY CHICKEN, which was good and spicy ....MUTTON HALEEM KIBBEH was not up to the mark .....rest of the food , main course FRIED RICE and LAL MAAS , NAAN was really satisfying.... at the end of the day ... it's the food that matter .... food was really good and tasty and had variety..... it was a very happy meal .... definitely recommend for a visit .... it's something different in kolkata....

I had been hearing lots of nice things about this place for a long time. Finally the plans materialised and we visited the place today. The food was out of the world. We tried the tempura fish,pork ribs,hydrebadi gosht biriyani, red pepper prawn, lal maas and nasi goreng rice. In drinks we had the chocolate bean, Long island and a beer cocktail. I would like to mention specially about the tempura fish which was the best of it's kind in Kolkata. The biriyani was so distinct that you could feel all the flavours. The only lacunae of the place is space crunch.

We had high hopes with this place when we went there on a monday for lunch.. but all in vain. We reached the restaurant only to realise that it was closed without any prior intimation or online message, and the manager didnot have the decency to apologise on behalf of his company rather argued that its their maintenace day which does not mean it is closed. All in all, very disappointing.

This place was bookmarked for a long time and finally I got to know what was the fuss all about this place. We went for a late lunch on a Sunday and after waiting for around 20-25 mins we got a table. I would say that we had high hopes about the enormity of the place but it's not huge. Maybe that's why there is long waiting hours. Moreover, there is no separate waiting room/area. You need to wait outside on the Footpath like a Ration Shop Customer.¬†
Anyhow, we were impressed by the details written on the menu of the Chef/owner. He has graduated from Le Cordon Bleu, Paris.
Coming to the food, for starters we had Doodhiya Kebab, which was not so great. In main course we ordered Chinese: Vegetable Dumplings in Manchurian Sauce and Hakka Noodles. Both the dishes were lip-smacking and mouth watering. After Asia Kitchen, this was the next best place where I had chinese. I wanted to try out more dishes but had no space in the stomach. Both the quantity and quality were amazing.
Just one problem in this place is that for a vegetarian, there is not much variety in the menu. The ratio of Non veg dishes are much higher. This place is very famous among bengali crowd.
The food and service were top class but the ambience and decor of the place lost 0.5 rating.

Awesome food joint at Ballygunge Phari

Food: We went here on a summer evening and was informed that Indian dishes weren‚Äôt available as they are cooked in coal oven and the coal takes a couple hours to get heated. Thus we settled for continental and ordered a Penne Pasta Alfredo for starter. The dish was a bit on the sweeter side (as we requested for less spicy) and tasted pretty good. The quantity was also sufficient for both of us. In main course, we ordered Lobster Thermidor and Moon Faan. The Moon Faan was well cooked and contained a generous amount of egg, chicken and mushrooms with butter in the backdrop. But the best item was the Lobster Thermidor. It is a French dish consisting of a creamy mixture of cooked lobster meat, egg yolks, and brandy stuffed into a lobster shell. It was extremely well made and was an immediate heart stealer. Both of us almost competed against one another to have that. The added rice and the boiled vegetables were cherry on the cake. The quantity was also enough for two people. So, we had an Italian dish, a Chinese dish and a French dish and SpiceKraft didn‚Äôt disappoint us in even a single one. In dessert, we had 100% Jack Daniels choco mousse and that was splendid as well. Particularly the use of tulsi leaves on the mousse was very innovative and served as minty refresher for the palate. 

Ambiance: The interiors are very well decorated with impressive use of brown and yellow colour in designer swirls. Half the walls are covered in mirrored glass and the other half contains glass showcases containing expensive liquor bottles. The ceiling also uses wisely the Bouba-Kiki effect and gives a good impression on the diners. The glasses and plates used, also matches with the ambiance. However, the use of toy trucks on the table does not fit with the d√©cor of the place. Those toy trucks seem out of place and looks as if they would fit better in places like Rang De Basanti Dhaba. While we were there, they were playing the "I Want To Hold Your Hand" from Beatles. Never heard any Beatles song being played in any Kolkata restaurant. Added brownie points for that as well.

Service: Service is okayish. We had to look and call for the waiter every time we needed to place order, or ask for water or bill. However, the waiting time needs to be reduced considerably. Cash and card are readily accepted. Parking is also available in front of the restaurant. ¬†

Overall: Definitely visit this place if you are a food enthusiast. I will be visiting again very soon.

This one's rated 4.8. So we had to visit.
It's on Hazra Road, right after you cross Birla Mandir. Easy to spot.

The ambience is okay. The place is pretty small, they've got different rooms. It's probably a great pick if you wanna host a family party.

The lighting's all blue. Not much thought spared on the music or seating.

Now. The food. It is sooo good. One of the best I've had in a while. Totally wasn't expecting this.

We ordered the Beer Can Tempura Fish thrice, it's that good. Also, a non-veg penne pasta Alfredo, pork ribs and a preparation of chicken that looked green and had a thin dropper vertically inserted in each of the pieces, as if injecting something. I don't remember the name, but it was really good.

For drinks, I had a cocktail that the server suggested. It was tequila, Cointreau and a bottle of Heineken. Basically a Coronita with a Heineken, slightly bitter. But very good, and effective.
My friend had a painkiller, and it was awesome.
By the way, they don't have all the beers available. Like, I wanted a Miller but they only had Buds and Tuborg.

Highly recommended. I regret not coming here earlier.

The food which looks good makes me more hungry.. 
After hearing a lot of great stuff about this place I was super excited to visit this restaurant... 
Simple clean and classy decor gives a fine dining experience... 
The best part about this place according to me is the innovative and out of the box kind of presentation of the food items.... 
we tried some of there signature and famous dishes  

Dajaj chermula: it's a Lebanon dish .. the chicken is soft and juicy with some really flavours and the seasoning was just perfect... the serve it with a sweet dip which I did not like that much.  
Beer can Tempura fish üêü: 6 strips of fish serve with a orange sweat and sour sauce.. the quality of the fish is very good but the outer quoting of the fish is too much oily.. 
 jack daniels chocolate mousse :probably one of the most innovative and interesting dessert I have ever had. 
They prepare the chocolate mousse by using liquid nitrogen (they use this cooling technique for setting and freezing the mousse) and serve its with 4 small pieces of vanilla sponge cake ,and a thin layer of mango reduction... 
The staff is very helpful and polite..

The first thing you got to remember while visiting this place is that it is small. Even when I reached at 7:30 PM it was packed and had to wait another half an hour before getting in. The second thing is that if you are only two people visiting this place then they'll seat you to the left side of the restaurant where there are 4-5 tables for two people.

Now to my bad luck, I got the two seater table at the far end of the restaurant. The place around that table is extremely cramped with almost no space to move around. On top of that, it was really dark there compared to the rest of the place. I had to read the menu with the help of my mobile light. After a while, it started to feel claustrophobic due to that cramped space there.

Moving on to the food, we ordered,
1. Beer Can Tempura Fish
2. Dajaj Charmoula
3. Shepherds Pie

For cocktails, they suggested something out of the menu called
1. Action 20000
2. Hitman

The food is absolutely delicious, no questions asked! Dajaj Charmoula was served with a curd based dip (I am guessing) and it tasted very good. The Beer Can Tempura Fish melted inside my mouth and it was also served with a dip that was lip-smackingly good. And finally, the Shepherd's Pie was also delicious. Full marks on the food!

The Action 20000 was very good and a bit on the stronger side and the Hitman was less strong but tasted really good.

So overall a visit that could have been perfect if only I had gotten a different table as even though you are enjoying the food, if the ambiance isn't making you comfortable then it becomes really difficult to truly enjoy the experience.

Sorry, no pictures as it was really dark to click any and the flash was not helping that much.

I visited this place on a FRIDAY eve . Our waiting time was cut short by the manager who offered us a reserved seat ,which was not ours, since the party had not arrived yet!!

The only word that describes the food is Awesome! Its tasty , delicious and all the good things you can think of. The staffs were very courteous!
The only thing that really needs to improve is the service, as we had to wait for a long long time. If this improves, Spice Kraft can be one of the best things in the city :)

Bon Appetit!!

In lane of hazra law college and 2mins walk from ballygunj science college back gate, place boasts of molecular eats. Will mention the pros first.. definitely the ambience, and decor. Eclectic, modern, spacious although there was space available the floor manager asked us to wait till a table was cleared out infront of us. Did nt understand whether the interior sitting space is reserved or not. Its no doubt a photographers dream with its expensive liquor containing wall, the spice toy truck or the roti s served in mini cycles.
Coming to the menu, its a hard to choose from wide range causing severe what to eat confusion in a foodie s hungry mind.
Finally settled for 2 entrees , the signature bacardi infused sausage with bluberry coulis and the deviled crab meat portions. The first one very very different to taste and served in a wacky way appeared slightly over priced to me and somehow all though innovative the taste didnt all together work well, what with the lovely dip but large cucumber below the sausage. The deviled crab was one of the best i have had and will be talked abt for long and was an instant favourite. Smoked crab meat with creamy accent it popped our taste buds. The main course pan fried mixed noodles were a slight dissapointment again. Slightly under seasoned and blandish, failed to impress.
Mocktails the doodh cola was unique standout with its hatke combo while the rainbow had a nostalgic well known taste.
The staff were a lil offhandish and casual. One repeated our order, while the manager tried a bit too hard but failed majorly. One known televsion face also dined in a table infront of us and i bliv they were also troubled by an outlandish bug and changed tables.
Better hospitability is recommended and tasting of entrees ,desserts too!

The most awaited place that I had bookmarked since last year. So, finally on June 21st, I went there to celebrate my birthday. As I planned to give a grand treat to my better half.üòç
It's Very easy to locate. This restaurant is in a little busy area.
From outside it doesn't look too much beautiful or hi-fi, but what it actually is, the rating says it all! :)
Too much cozy, mind blowing fine dining zone. The interiors are too much beautiful. Utility of mirror reflections make a little illusion which i loved! From each and every corner percolates its elegance  and perfection. We choose the interior section to dine in as this area has more light. 
They've a transparent conception about the molecular gastronomy food. overall foods and drinks are based on this concept of food science.

We ordered-

Tuborg - chilled. nothing special about it. It tastes exactly as it is. The speciality was in their service üòå the way they serve it, makes you feel special. 

Hong Shao Rou - as starter. a pork preparation from china. First we ordered the Suon Nuong. But chef Amit recommended us to try this, as that other dish has the less portion of meat, he said. And, it was such a good recommendationüòç it was juicy, spicy and succulent. so many veggies are served with it which is delicious üòã 

Nasi Goreng - Indonesian dish. It has very nice aroma. a very popular item here. That's why most of the people  try this. They serve two prawn chips with a sunny side up topping on it. Quantity is generous. Sufficient for two.

Shreeded Lamb in masaman curry - strong aromatic dish. Very nicely cooked. I loved it. But somehow I felt that the flavour of coconut milk was totally dominating the other ingredients. It was a little 
failure cause the lamb's actual taste I couldn't find. The only aroma you'll feel that is of the milk.

100% Jack Daniel's & Barry Callebaut Swiss chocolate mouss√© - Perfect dessert. They serve four drunken petits with it. The chocco mouss√© is absolutely delicious.üëå actually I'm unable to describe its tasteüòÖ please just go and try. Strongly recommended. üòç

uniqueness in even their "Hajmis" (digestive pill) too!üòÇ A complete and real flavour of tamarind absolutely blew up my mindüòá 

I'd like to thank Chef Amit for the wonderful service and the other chefs who were in our service as well. They started to serve our order within 10-15 minutes which is quite satisfactory. Cause the place was almost full. But they took a long time to serve us the dessert. never mind. They attended us two times telling us to wait a little more. Staffs are really courteous here. The ultimate place for the Asian palette.
Last but not the least,They have some splendid soundtracks in their collection.üòã jazz, blues, metal- they have it all which led our food journey to the peak of perfection. As we both are hard music lovers we felt so perfect!üòå 
Next time I'd like to visit for the Cointrue, pork rendang curry and the other pork dishes. oh! drinks as well!üç∏üòÇ

While the intent to innovate is great, worth a 5, the execution is above average at best. No complaints on the taste. But the ambience is a let down... the space is too cramped; the menu cards are torn with tapes all over and waiter with a torn shirt is not what you expect at a place like this. A little bit of attention to details can make this place worth queuing up for.

If you like global cuisine, Spice Kraft is the place for you. Loved the sorpotel, the dajaz charmoulade and the steak. If you like a tipple, try the cocktail called Terminator - with beer, cointreau and tequila it packs a punch and tastes great. We loved the service - particularly, Amit Mukherjee who served was great with little tips on dishes not in the menu.

Good for a Romantic evening!

Food 4/5 - taste is really good but the quantity was very insufficient. Very scanty.
Service 4/5 - very courteous staff
Ambience 5/5
Vfm 4/5 - I found it little bit on the expensive side, so won't go here regularly as such. Once in a month or two is fine. 

We ordered chicken stroganoff and it was really good! Couldn't find this dish else where in Kolkata yet. So I do recommend chicken stroganoff here.

Nice place, everything good - but bit expensive.

hello guys... want some good food in  Kolkata at a decent price ?? then do visit spice kraft.. After visiting the place I got know why everyone was raving so much about this place.. Things u must have: beer can tempura fish (jst delicious),dajaj charmoula (it's like chicken tandoori)... and the cocktails were also  very good and refreshing.. Coming to main course: my suggestion would be nasi Goren rice and with fish and chicken Mandarin.

overall review:
1. very nice location ... parking will not be an issue
2.good price selection... moderate pricing 
3.must visit for the starters :)

Anything except 5 would be a grave injustice considering how good this restaurant is. We had ordered One Long Island Iced Tea, One Cucumber Cola (its not on the menu but ask for it , its great for not so heavy alcohol lovers) and one beer. The LIIT is hands down the best cocktail I ever had. It had 3 different types of alcohol infused so beautifully that your immediate reaction after taking a sip would be to take another sip. We also had ordered 2 plates of Nasi Goreng , One Pork in Rendang Curry which was by far the best pork dish I've ever had in my life and one Chicken in Chilli Oyster and Mushroom which was also very good, Including all of this , the total bill was a mere 1577 Rs. which is a huge amount of pocket pinch considering what we ate.¬†Visit it again? You bet

Well, I visited Kolkata for work and glanced through Zomato looking for a good place for lunch nearby..saw this place with 4.8 rating..so had to go..the first thing that I found very refreshing even before I ordered was the nice story of the chef at the start of the menu..from Bschool to Culinary school..unexpected good read for a restaurant..

Coming to the food, we did not experiment much..stuck to basic continental dishes - grilled fish in lemon butter sauce and crispy shrimps ..both were good..although I felt that there could have been a bit more of the sauce to go with the rice in case of the grilled fish in lemon butter sauce..

Now, that I am reading other reviews, I feel I should take another round on my next visit and order some of the gourmet dishes...

Food is an art at Spice Kraft. These guys have taken the gastronomic affair to a different level. It surpasses big names of the food industry. We had to wait for over an hour but the wait was worth it.

Do ask them for their special cocktails which are off the menu. We had ordered:
1.Bad man
2.Hit man
3.Pain killer
Mind blowing drinks and served innovatively.
To accompany them we ordered we had ordered for starters:
1.Beer can tempura fish
2.Bacardi lemon infused chicken sausage
3. Dejaj Charmola
All three..absolutely amazing. We could not help but repeat each of them.
The main course was no less. We ordered:
1.Nasi goreng
2.Lobster thermidor
3.Shepher's Pie

100%jack daniells mousse for dessert.

Amazing amazing amazing. That's all I can say. The rest...you need to go and experience.

And the best part...the people. Extremely helpful and well behaved.
I cannot wait to try out their rest of the dishes.

Opposite to Hazra Law College campus, little before Ballygunge crossing, is Spice Kraft, a nicely decked up place, ideal for all taste buds. Although their signature food is continental and fusion yet they serve a variety of other dishes. They have a full bar and quirk up the dishes with alcohol. Since I tried their continental menu, I loved the Jack Daniel Mousse (dessert), Beer Fish Tempura (which they serve in beer cans), Baked Fish and Shepherd's Pie. Try spice kraft to discover more!

A restaurant which doesn't look like much from outside but serves amazing food is definitely worth a visit. 

They serve alcohol as well and their Jamun drink will win your heart. What I derived from all that I ordered is that their meat dishes are extremely tender and flavourful.

Their chef-in-charge will visit your table and ask you if you are enjoying the food, make recommendations and would also try to ruffle up something according to your preferences if you wish.  

All of their dishes are worth trying and you shouldn't be disappointed by their quality at all if all goes well.
Definitely one of the good restaurants in the city worthy of spending your time and money in.

Visited the place last night. Loved the place. Right from the food, ambience and staff everything was great. However, the service was pretty slow. It took almost half an hour for every dish to arrive. Even though the staff apologised for the inconvenience would request them to increase their service time. 
Highly recommend this place to everyone who want to try out fusion food at affordable prices.
Must try - beer can tempura fish and squid in butter garlic sauce

Firstly, no complaints at all about the food....Try their Beer can tempura fish (yes...it lives up to its hype) and the shepherd's pie (really well made)...The Coq au vin also didn't disappoint at all....the chefs do justice to the food....

The drinks were pretty decent and well concocted...

But there's one low-light which kind of wrecks the party...while the waiters were very cordial and polite, we had to wait for ages for our drinks and food to arrive....This needs to be taken care of....

Other than that Spice Kraft is a delight. Do drop in if you find time.....

Words to describe this place are too little for the awesome experience I had everytime I visited this gem of a restaurant. The ambience is quite lovely. The staff show good hospitality. I salute their chef for creating such unique dishes. My favourite dish is the devil's crab. M simply in love with it. The tanpura chicken is also a great delight. Painkiller adds to the zing. But, the cocktails are overpriced. The moonfun, nasigoreng were quite good. The pork was a delicacy. But, the pork and the lamb had a similar taste which was a bit disappointing. The jack Daniels dessert was awesome. Hope to visit again.

An absolute let down on a Saturday evening. 
Where to start?
Well, the restaurant had apparently run out of beer, of all kinds and varieties.
The alternatives, the cocktails, were a disaster of an all new magnitude. Just about everything starting from the Blue Lagoon to the Hazelnut thingy had enough sugar to put you in a diabetic coma.
Then, Spice Kraft can directly induce an attack of claustrophobia. A chicken coop in comparison would look rather spacious.
The table for four is about the size of a breakfast counter for no more than 3. To ruin it even further, they put pieces of furniture on the table and cheap, fancy looking glassware, which are so disproportionate that you have to keep re arranging so as to to fit your plate beside it and that too with utmost caution so as not to bump into people gathered at the adjacent table.
It's a lot of hard work you know, when all you want, is to enjoy a dinner in peace.
All this, and I haven't even reached the food. 
There was beer can tempura fish or something, which was rather nice I shall not deny. The presentation was a bit flimsy, and it had no chips to go along with, and sauce was jaggery-sweet. But still you can easily rate it a 4/5 for taste.
Dajaj charmoula wasn't to bad either, except for the Dips which was more like mishti doi on a scale of sweetness. Maybe a 3.5/5 taste wise. 
Fish wellington, was downright bad. I'd fumble to even rate it 2/5.
Shepherd's pie. Not bad at all. Had enough flavour. A 3.5/5 on taste. 
Then it was some Vietnamese chicken and some slightly raw fish and noodles, all of which beg the question is it anything at all above the ordinary?
It really isn't. 
Food on the whole can be given a 3 star. But service, ambience, and just about everything else is, well, there's no other word for it. Rather terrible.
The menu is just too vast to keep the service any good. The portions are rather disproportionate in size and the waiters give you no feedback as to would it be enough or not. 
It isn't really the lack of space but rather too many tables crammed into a space too small.
The presentation is shabby.
The waiters have no sense of hurry but chat about amongst one another leaving you feel a bit neglected.
The bartender just deserves to be fired.
And if all that wasn't enough, the menu, the pamphlet on which it arrives, was all torn, in tatters.
All this I know doesn't really speak well of a restaurant. It looks like what I myself would call incrimination.
But it isn't. 
It's a restaurant with a chef who probably has the potential. But the management is rather appalling.
All which sort of illustrates as to why Bengal failed at business.

Oh my holy Christ !!! What a place this is !! Nothing can describe this place .It seems to be a heaven for foodies !
The ambience , the service and especially the FOOD.... everything has got a class of it's own !

Those soothing lights ..the music ..the weather today .. everything was just perfect!

We ordered :

Djaj Charmoula- the taste that Smell that curd accompanying the dish .WoW!

Beer Canned Tempura- The crispiness outside the soft buttery melt in your mouth fish inside - heavenly just heavenly

For mains we took:
Mixed Meat Fried Rice- a simple but delicious a preparation

Spicy orange peeled chicken - went well with the rice.

For Deserts it had to be the much talked about 100% Jack Daniel's mousse ... Absolutely wow!

The person attending us was extremely well behaved. Thanks to him for helping us to choose the dishes.

Pinch on the pocket: Extremely reasonable.

Eagerly Waiting for the next visit!

Food ordered:
Drinks: we ordered Mango screwdriver and beer.
Starters: Beer battered tempura fish, Dajaj Chermoula , Bacardi limon infused chicken sausages.
The starters were all very good but the beer battered tempura fish was AMAZING!!!
Main course: we ordered Coq au vain and baked Wellington 
Coq au vain just stole the show. Mesmerising as it was we couldn't help ourselves and had to repeat it once more.
Dessert: In desert we had 100%jack daniels mousse which was also quite unique in taste.

Much has already been said about SpiceKraft, so after seeing a massive score of 4.8 on Zomato I thought to give this place a try.

Like I have emphasised in my earlier reviews, the single most important and defining feature of any restaurant is "food", and the sheer variety on the menu and the taste/ quality at SpiceKraft is astounding. The special highlights of the evening were as follows -

1. Dajaj Charmoula - This lebanese starter was the first shocker I tasted here. The pieces were nicely cooked, spices had entered into every fibre of the chicken. Full points to the chef for this amazing dish.

2. Beer-can Tempura - The presentation of the dish was innovative, and the taste of fish was well preserved inside the warm crust. This is a must recommended for all.

3. Baked Fish Wellington - Fish baked nice and juicey served with rice pilaf is a total delight for the tastebuds.

4. Jack Daniels Mousse - It is a rare thing to see chefs trying nice and innovative things with the recipe, and this dessert is a testament of how wonderful a nicely done experiment can be. The rich aroma and flavour of Jack Daniels can be felt to the core in this culinary wonder. It is a must recommended for everyone with a sweet tooth & love for alcohol.

5. Drinks - Signature drink - Kokum Rita, tequila with spice. There is a reason why this drink is so highly praised by connoisseurs, and that is the taste. The light tingling feel of tequila with desi spices is like liquid heaven.

Overall -
Great food combined with an excellent staff is what makes SpiceKraft so highly appreciated by food lovers. From the very first moment you step inside the restaurant, you will be happily surprised with the manager's and staffs' extremely cordial behaviour. SpiceKraft has every potential to become the next big legendary of Kolkata. Just one thing the management needs to be watchful about, is to keep up the good work.

Update after 2nd Visit ----
The most unfortunate thing about zomato is, you can not rate a restaurant twice. SpiceKraft deserves a 10 rating. The food, the staff behavior all were impeccable.

The dishes ordered this time were - Bacardi lemon infused chicken sausage, lobster thermidore, devilled crab, Coq au vin, pulav-laal maas and fried ice cream.

If you are a Bengali foodie living outside Bengal, you always make a checklist of must visit places when you visit Kolkata, and Spice Kraft topped my list. To talk about the food, there are a few dishes like Devilled crab meat, Beer can tempura fish, Coq au vin, Soy braised drums of heaven. The main course was also very good with moon faan, a friedrice prep with chicken and mushroom and we tried out shredded lamb too. In desserts, jack Daniels mousse is a must have. The staff is very courteous, the place is optimally decorated and lighted. And did I tell you, don't forget to try that Lobster Thermidor too.

This place is 2mins away from Hazra Law College.The moment you enter this place you'll feel like you have come to another dimension.So if you think that a 1200 for two might be a costly descsion,let me tell you the loss will be yours.The ambience,the decor,the staff and most importantly the quality of food which is authentic as well,will definitely take your heart away and not regret.
What we Ordered:
STATERS:Beer can Tempura fish,Fish-en-Papillote,Lymwn Samak,Shish Aouk,Dajaj Charmoula
^The DIP's served with them are unique and very tasty! That enhances the taste of the items even more.

BEVERAGE:Hitman(justifies the name, alcohol based) Cucumber Cooler(a summer cooler)

MAIN COURSE:Baked Fish Wellington(baked Beckti fish in rich cheese Sauce which is served with saffron rice,is a amazing combi that makes up the main course)
Chilly Chicken dry (tasted extra ordinary) with chicken noodles Cantonese,Coq-Au-Vin(French delicacy,chicken cooked with red wine and mushrooms served with Parsley butter rice)

And lastly BOOZERT(dessert+booze), 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut which is amazingly tasty the soft sponge cakes were dipped in a syrup and the Chocolate mouse was infused with alcohol)

Finally ticked this place off my bucket list.

Located near Ballygunge phari, this place is a 5 mins walking distance from the Hazra law college along the pavement of Sharma Tea.

The ambience is preety upscale and posch with dim lighting. Perfect for a date or a family dine out. The seating arrangements are really comfortable and well spaced out. 

Waiters are attentive and polite. The ever smiling and gregarious head chef cum owner adds a charm to this place as he is always busy interacting with his customers and helping them choose from the menu.

Coming to the most important perspective of this place which is the food, I would just say it is fabulous. The dishes are well presented, have a fancy name and tastes very delectable. The chef had innovated quite a few regular dishes in its elevated form.

We ordered:
1. Bacardi Limon infused chicken sausages: a very good dish and presented very innovatively. Tasted excellent and the dip infused in it made it all the more moist and juicy while imparting a nice zesty flavor.
2. Beer Can Tempura Fish: A typical version of the batter fish fry of fish and chips. They use fresh bhetki fish and the taste is amazing. The upgrade of bhetki over basa makes it more compelling to eat.
3. Fish en Pappilote: I would say that this was the best dish. It was creamy and chessy and the fish was perfectly seasoned. Again fresh bhetki used here which made it all the more enjoyable.
4. Lywn Samak : Another fish dish which was mind blowing. It was wrapped up in a transparent natural foil. The cheese and the fish went well together and it was melt in your mouth stuff.

Main Course:
1. Chicken stroganoff: a well made Stroganoff. It was creamy and cheesy with big chunks of chicken and some veggies. Accompanied by a bowl of amazing salty and butter toasts. 
2. Shepherd Pie: Amazing dish. Minced meat and a layer of baked cheese on top. The meat was nicely cooked and flavored and the baked cheese on top had a nice chewy texture. Not made the traditional way but was a really good dish. Accompanied by the butter salted toasts which is a fine accompaniment for this dish.
3. Moon Fan: A typical rice dish of eggs , chicken and mushrooms in generous quantity. Good dish.
4. Chicken in chilli oyster and mushroom sauce: amazing dish. The chicken was tender. The sauce had big chunks of mushroom and the sauce was really good in taste. 

Dessert: 
1. Fried ice cream: Amazing dish. The crust was crunchy and the ice cream inside was chilled and gooey.
2. Jack daniels and berry callebaut: the white sponge cakes were amazing. They were fluffy and light and went well with the amazing chocolate mousse served along with it.

This place is highly recommended. Please do give it a visit.

USP: the fish dishes,  the presentation of food and desserts.

The place is easily accessible, has a beautiful ambience, and has ample space unless it's peak hour. The staff are very polite and efficient. They suggest the best options if you are confused about food or drink options. But what is most amazing is their food. I have had 2  items the two times I visited - beer can tempura fish and devilled crab with garlic toast, and both were very, very tasty. Their cocktails are superbly tasty as well, as are their mocktails. Prices are very reasonable. I've got nothing bad to tell about them.

It was my second invitation from #Foodzpah to attend an evening over there at spice kraft. Being a pure North Kolkata person, it was a bit troublesome for me initially to locate the place however thanks to zomato for putting the actual location in their site.
Parking is available just in front of the restaurant.
As we already had a pre booking so we didn't have to wait much and the starters started to pour in. :)
We had the famous terminator cocktail first. This was excellent. This was followed by quite a few mocktails and cocktails which names are mentioned in the image attached. I won't lengthen this review with those. Coming to starters, we had around 3 chicken starters and 2 fish starters and all of them were impeccable. The presentation of the items are more than praiseworthy, you would simply stare at them for minutes - now a days, presentation has become a very crucial part of any restaurant and I can guarantee that Spice kraft is one of the toppers in that list.
The main course were again phenomenal, I couldnt think ever that a simple dry chilli with a noodle can taste so good. Another item was a cup of rice surrounded by a significant portion of chicken gravy cooked in indian style. This was again a hit.
In desert we had their famous jack daniels mousse - Mahnnn, you gotta be alcoholic even if you are not to try this - coz you just cant afford to miss this item.
Overall it was a very nice experience and definitely a very well evening was spent. I will definitely recommend this place to everyone for the love of good food, nice ambience and last but not the list - innovative presentations.

This fine dine restobar is located a couple of blocks off the nooks of Ballygunge Phari on Hazra Road..I like to compliment the way the guys have actually utilised the limited space to perfection, squeezing out a dimly lit romantic family coupe(we liked the use of the lights on the wall paintings)amidst the well decorated resto ambience(good choice of music to go with the mood). The attendants were very polite,decent and courteous. 
They have an encompassing menu to choose from with a plethora of cocktails and mocktails..
We(my wife and me) ordered a kokum rita and a Chivas julep to start the proceedings. They were absolutely refreshing,specially the julep which just tingle your senses. The Lymwn Samak(a grilled fish preparation) and the Dajaj Chermoula(spice grilled chicken drumstick) were the joint winners of the eve;kudos to the chef for preparing these masterpieces which are grilled but quintessentially succulent and an absolute treat to the taste buds. The baked fish Wellington was cheesy for our liking and a bit ordinary and surprisingly charred as well..To sign off the evening we ordered the much revered JD Choco Mousse with petit fours which is a very unique boozert(as the menu refers!!)the taste of which was more inclined to the spirit than to the chocolate, nonetheless good. The prices are neither too heavy on the pocket, nor the food too heavy for the belly.
So in a nutshell, if you want an enchanting Saturday evening with your loved ones and get yourself treated to a deluge of foods and spirits, SpiceKraft awaits you at Hazra Road.
P.S. Remember to book your table beforehand as this one is very popular among foodies ‚ò∫

I've been here couple of times. This is the first time I'm reviewing it. Spicekraft crafted a special place in the food lovers mind in the city. It never fails to charm me with its innovative menus, friendly staffs and mesmerising dishes. 
This we ordered Dajaj chermoula, devilled crab meat, soy braised drums of heaven, for starters. For main course we had moon faan, Khao pad sapparod along with roast pork in rendang curry, shredded lamb in masaman curry. For dessert we had 100% jack daniels mousse and classic mont√® Carlo. 
Devilled crab meat and roast pork was best in the lot and rest are also fascinating.

Had too high expectations from spice kraft...but a little bit disappointed ...

Ambiance: good but too much of space crunch...

Service: extremely caring the staff were...sometimes giving us information on how the dish has been cooked ... Sometimes asking us about the food...Or helping us choose the dishes..
Also, we had ordered 2 plates of rice..And they suggested us that they serve good amount and it might be extra for us...So we cancelled a plate‚ò∫ ...

We had ordered
 Dajaj Charmoula: could'nt take in the too smokey flavour...But That's specific to me ...

Lymwn Samak: good but could not reach a better level...The flavours seemed to have been suppressed somewhere...But yes too soft the fish was...You could understand that it has been prepared with too much effort and care

Nasi Goreng: all, please try this...This was very nice in taste and all the flavours were so neatly present...A dish done to perfection 

Hunan fish: nothing too expressive to say about the dish..A good one but to be had with man foon..Not with nasi Goreng..Nasi Goreng is a dish in itself to be had alone..

100% Jack Daniels choco Mousse: Heavenly flavour...Just loved the taste of the mousse, the sponge cake...Oh boy! All the parts of the dish were so awesome ...Just loved it..
But just a suggestion..One who does not like the alcoholic flavour ..wudnt appreciate this dish much..

The first thing I usually look for when I visit a particular restaurant is the attitude and response of the staff. Well this place scores a full marks in the same. The staffs are extremely well behaved and friendly. So this place is a must visit for people who want to have a comfortable evening dinner. Second comes the food and drinks. I always had the dream of having the Utterly Butterly Jameson cocktail they prepared here and I had it. The taste was just too good and there are only a few cocktails of selective places that I like and this has become one of them. On the waiters recommendation we also tried the Hitman cocktail but this is to warn you that it is not for the faint hearted. We also tried Dajaj Chermoula, a lebanese delicacy as starter and it was quite good. This being a weekday we had a second round of drinks with me trying the Mango screwdriver. In the main course I had Shepherd's pie and it just tasted great. However there is only one thing on the downside about this place. They make you wait for a long time for the food. Hope things fasten up a bit the next time I visit.

We came here once last year and were longing to return. And the experience was totally awesome, once more!

Much has been written about the ambiance, decor, and the splendid and super courteous service of all the staff! Full points on all of those counts.
For starters, we ordered the "Beer Battered Tempura" (we tried it last time, too) and the "Pork Ribs¬†Burrah Kabab". The quality of both of these was¬†exquisite - from the delicate balance of the spices and condiments to the softness of the meat. Loved it fully!I would like to especially¬†mention the "Orange Ponzu Tartar√©" that came with the fish - that was truly tantalizing!

We then tried the "Lymwn Samak", which is a Middle Eastern (Lebanese) style grilled fish with a light lemon flavor. This too, as usual, was marvelous. The fish was really well cooked to the right degree and the proportion of spices was awesome, too!
The "Shepherd's Pie" was the last of the entr√©es, and this was truly amazing. The flavor of the meat, the quantity served, the softness and butteriness of the potato - everything was amazing!¬†

For dessert, we went with the "Jack Daniels Chocolate Mouss√®" [not the exact name] and it was truly worth finishing our meal with! One would run out of adjectives describing how awesome it was!

We really love how the service staff come and explain in gist how the things that we ordered have been made, and what are the ingredients! They try to give us a richer experience than we already get from their flavors! Kudos on these little gestures and the tremendous courteousness! Hope they make it even bigger in the Kolkata gastronomic stage!

One of the best restaurants at present in town. A tough competition for most other restaurants in town. Ambience is soothing with soft music playing in the background. The behaviour of staff was very @nice. They also helped us to decide the menu. We ordered dajaj chermoula, mixed fried rice and chicken with oyester and mushroom.
Dajaj chermoula is a must try its very very tasty. The flavours of burnt charcoal give the dish a complete finesse. The rice and chicken dish were also delicious. Shall definety visit again.üòä

So i finally managed to tick off this much talked about restaurant from my bucket list! Whoof! Such a hearty meal that was! 
Located opposite to the hazra law college, this place is a minutes walk from ballygunge phari. You won't get lost don't worry! 
This place scores heavily in terms of ambience, hospitality, promptness and service, add to that, the ever cheerful presence of chef sambit! Since we were skeptical as to what we should order we stuck to his suggestions and thank god we took his suggestion! 

This place is famous for its Krafty cocktails and being a cocktail lover i just had to try some signature ones! If you are a beer lover, go for the RDX and the TERMINATOR, such quirky names!  Tastes even better! Lets not dwell on the aftereffects now, you can find out for yourself!  

The appetisers were generous in quantity, quality and they give alot of attention to the presentation of each dish. The dajaj charmouli and the beer can tempura fish are a must haves if you are visiting this place, we were literally drooling for more though the bacardi lemon infused tandoori chicken sausage and the fish in papiloote packed alot of punch and ended our greed for the appetisers!  

The main course charted a memorable course altogether!  The shepherds pie, chicken stroganoff, moon faan and the chicken in chilly oyster and mushroom satiated our appetite completely. The shepherds pie won me over, let's not forget the dishes now since i dint compromise on my plate!  
After such a wholesome meal, we just had to try their signature deserts!  - The 100 % jack Daniels and Barry calebaut was a masterpiece really, as innovative as it can get without compromising on the taste!  
This place offers a diverse menu to its diners, an array of krafty cocktails so i am definitely coming back to this place. 
For those of you who haven't visited this place yet, you would definitely be missing out on some krafty experience!

Spice Kraft was a long time wish which comes true finally,after a long time I have visited a place which gives me immense pleasure from food to service every point of view.Located near Hazra law college this restaurant is one of the key players in the restaurants of Kolkata.

Ambience is really cool and classy,they have different sections with a different theme,nicely decorated.

Food
STARTERS:
Dajaj Charmoula- It's just wow,a highly recommended item for chicken lovers,the flavour of smoke makes it kinky and wonderfully decorated,toothsome.

Fish En Papillote- great taste of bhetki, loved it a lot,fish lovers must try.

Beer Can Tempura Fish- One will instantly fall in love with this item for its representation,poured in a beer can,it's excellent in taste,this item you will hardly find in any restaurant,so must try.

Lymwn Samak- it's sapid,delicious and divine.

Shish Taouk- terrific taste,enjoyable.

BEVERAGE:
There are plenty of option,if you are non alcoholic you should try the ''Cucumber Cooler'',it's really refreshing.''Kokum Rita'' is herbaceous,highly recommended.

MAIN COURSE:
Chicken Noodles- Marvellous in taste,different from the contemporary noodles available in Kolkata,taste it otherwise you can't realize it.

Chilly Chicken- appropriate with the noodles,it's satisfactory.

Baked Fish Wellington- one of the finest fish item I have ever tried in this city,fish is tantalizing,stuffed with rice,it's one of their best items,you just can't give it a miss.

DESSERT:

100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut- nectarous,a mouthwatering dessert,you can surely try it if you love to do experiment and I am sure you will praise it.

Management is very ¬†friendly and well behaved,staffs are well mannered and service is prompt.It's a memorable experience.Keep it up.

This one is for those who love to try out fusion food. You will find an array of experimental items here. That and nothing more. The bar menu is a bit overpriced. The baby corn that we ordered was not crispy at all. The ambience is okayish. Their garnishing of the dishes deserve a special mention  (an area where most restaurants lack). The cocktails, however,  were superb. Okayish ambience. Good for one-time visit.

Spice Kraft- it had been in my wish list for a long time and finally I managed to visit this place today. This restaurant is located near Hazra Law College. Spice Kraft is a really well decorated restaurant with an ample amount of seating arrangements. As the name suggests they really do present their foods with some decorations done and that's the symbol of their craftsmanship. We entered around 1pm and the restaurant was quite full. As soon as we entered the staffs welcomed us very cordially which I really liked. Then we ordered some starters and drinks for ourselves. 

Cucumber mojito- Oh! This drink was sooo much needed in these hot summer days!! It was soo refreshing! I can have this drink in all my life! It was that good! loved it.

Bacardi Lemon infused tandoori chicken sausage- This dish was so well decorated! 6 succulent pieces of chicken sausages with a dropper filled with bacardi lemon sauce! That really shows their art of fusion and creativeness. The sausages were soft and flavoured so perfectly! needless to say, loved it again.

Lymwn Samak- again I fell in love with this dish!¬† 6 pieces of cubed fish which was soo fresh that it will melt on your mouth! We asked the chef about the fish they used and they said that they used the best quality of betki fish to make all their fish preparation! and rightfully so. I recommend this dish to everyone even with my eyes closed. 
We liked their starters and drinks so much that we decided to order some of their maincourse range. So we ordered.

Moon faan rice- This is somewhat like superb quality fried rice with chicken, egg and surprisingly mushrooms. Usually we don't find mushroom fresh but the mushroom they provided was so fresh and tasty! This dish was also tasted great to our taste buds! Really recommended.

Chicken in chili oyester mushroom- This dish was made of some deliciously soft pieces of chicken, some fresh mushrooms, bell peppers, onions and peas. The whole preparation was amazingly tasty! and It did go well with the Moon faan rice.

Lastly we couldn't resist but ordered a fried ice cream- A ball shaped fried ice cream placed on some chocolate ice cream with a cherry on top of it and some chocolate sauce on the side. Once I saw this I knew on my mind that it will blow my mind and it actually did!! The outer cover was so crunchy and hot whereas it was cold inside. Loved loved loved this dessert! 
It was really an awesome experience over there. The chef come owner was always there to help us while choosing the widespread menu card. He was so interactive and helpful! The other staffs also did a wonderful job while serving. The atmosphere is very homely and you'll never feel awkward to ask them for anything. It was really a great experience. I will definitely get back there real soon. And on my next visit I'll try the other starters and maincourse items that I missed this time! The price was reasonable and justified. Loved this place and I really recommend this place to everyone!

After visiting monkey bar the last time, this time I decided to visit a fairly popular but new joint in Ballygunge, Kolkata, called SpieKraft. What was really exciting is that the particular restaurant is one of the highest rated food joints in Kolkata, scoring a 4.7/5 after more that 1500+ reviews on Zomato and 4.5 after 300+ reviews on Google Maps. For a restaurant that does not particularly come under the category of fine dining, nor does it particularly offer the kind of offer that Barbecue Nation runs (all you cam eat!), this is a fairly high rating to have. However, after my visit to Monkey Bar the last weekend, I learnt that all reviews must be taken with a grain of salt. And this restaurant proved me right, yet again.
                                                                ...

Visited this place long back..on a sunday evening....just don't know how I forgot to review this one.¬†ü§î

As soon as u enter the place, you will find they have a classy interior, with beautiful paintings on the wall,dim lights.nicely arranged plates,napkins on the table..just perfect to set your mood for the day.¬†ü§ó

The staffs are really professional and helpful. We asked them to suggest some of their popular dishes..and they did so, even explaining what are the ingredients used..how it would taste,how it wi will be served..will it be enough for two person or not...¬†
So we took their suggestion and ordered Beer Can Tempura fish and Dajaj Charmoula as starter and Shepherd's pie as main course.¬†üòéüòã

Meanwhile the chef came and visited us to ask how were we enjoying our time there, do we need something and how we liked the place and all...We were talking to him about the beautiful paintings on the wall, and I found it really a sweet nice gesture of them towards their customers..really appreciative.üòá

Ok so now the food was served..Beer Can Tempura Fish was served in a beer can, really soft fish coated well and fried with a beer based batter I think...tasty and I could'n't just stop eating.. Combined well with the whiskey we had.¬†üòª

Dajaj Charmoula was 4 chicken leg pieces, served beautifully in small white clay cups, had a smoky flavor..cooked well with proper use of mild spices..and the chicken was juicy inside, smoked outside. A great starter I would suggest.¬†üëåüëå

Next comes our main course..Shepherd's pie. It is one lamb based dish, the pie was cooked in two small bowls and had a generous amount of lamb, veggies inside cooked in white sauce, proper spices and lots of cheese.served with garlic bread sticks..The pie  was hot inside and the cheesy creamy texture with spicy lamb meat and veggies just won our heart. Loved it to every bit.¬†ü§óüòç

For dessert we wanted to had their signature dish 100% Jack Daniels Mousse, but unfortunately that was not available at that time.. So we went for classic monte carlo..,ice cream with chocolate sauce on top. A sweet ending to our dinner. Surely will return to this place again.ü§óüòä

A brilliant restaurant with a very interesting menu. Spice Kraft uses molecular gastronomy techniques to prepare some of their signature dishes and cocktails.
We ordered a kokum based mocktail, Aam Panna and Curry Leaves shikanji, Dajaj Charmoula, Egg foo-yang canapes, Coq au Vin, Devilled crabs and Jack Daniel's and Barry Callebaut¬†Swiss Chocolate¬†Mousse¬†with Drunken¬†Petit Four.
The mocktails were nice, but the Aam Panna one was too sweet. Food was very good in general. The chicken pieces in the Dajaj Charmoula had a grilled exterior and were very tender. The chef later told us that the chicken is cooked in a sous vide machine and grilled just before serving. The Coq au Vin didn't have a pronounced red wine flavour. But the chicken and mushroom pieces were very tender and good to taste. The accompanying parsley buttered rice was good. Devilled Crab was nice but the natural sweetness of the crabmeat got lost in all the cheese and cream.The dessert was wonderful. The mousse was optimally sweet and had a nice aroma from the addition of the liquor. The petit fours had an orange flavour from the addition of Cointreau. It was served with some orange reduction. A unique and delicious Combo. Will come back to try some of their other dishes in future.
The chef and the staff carefully explained how some of the dishes are made. Had a long and interesting chat with chef Sambit.
Overall a very nice experience.

Called this place in advance stating that I was coming for my dad's birthday. Place looked shabby on the outside. Warning: they have 3 sections, and for 'stags' (meaning me and my dad) they have an ugly blue zone. Even though tables were empty in their main zone they insisted on keeping us in the blue zone till we had a word with the manager. The food was decent. Fish tempura and dajraj chemoula were great. Main course fish Wellington was okay, albeit served with a small portion of rice. We received a complimentary ice cream cake that served to improve our experience, but as soon as we had footed the bill, the waiter made a remark within earshot about the tip (which really was substantial)

So this one food experience has called me back from my comfortably long sabbatical, and not in a good way. I simply cannot wrap my head around the 4.8 rating, and the patrons who have put this place on that pedestal. The place looks shabby from outside, but determined not to judge a book by its cover, went in with brimming hope that I will perhaps be blown away by the food. Instead the first thing which startled my senses was the musty fungal smell which seemed to permeate through the entire place. Already upset, we still sat down to order. The place was swamped with flies and marred our entire eating experience as we ate with one hand and swatted flies with the other. Ordered some fresh lime juice and was served one made with expired lemon syrup. Really people does life not throw any lemons at you! And they continued to impress! Beer served hot! Saw a girl in the adjoining table send her drink back saying it tasted like cough syrup. Should have bolted the place by now but still had hope for the food. The beer batter fish was probably the only good thing we ate. Everything else, the hyderabadi mutton kibbeh, lemwn semak, devilled crab, and chicken kebabs, were just average. And hence the average rating above, for food and food alone. Not going back, ever, period!

This is just a 2 minutes walk from ballygunge phary petrol pump. It does not cover a large area but still it is cosy. The ambience is nice and the staffs are really helpful. The specialty if this place is their range of starters and their quality. We ordered beer can tempura fish.. which was really good.. the fish just melted in the mouth.. the dips were just perfect.. then we ordered dajan chermoula.. whoch one of the staff recommended us.. he memtioned it to be their one of the signature dish.. it was also good.. but i found the tempura fish better...
They don't serve breezer.. but they serve some real good mocktails and cocktails.. the price of alcohol served here is relatively cheaper than some other restaurants.. 
In the main course we ordered mixed chilli garlic noodles and hunan chicken. Both tasted good.. 
I would like to pay a second visit there to taste the L.I.I.T specially..

We started with the dajaj chermoula followed by prawn in corriander sauce. The murg zarka tikka stole the show for me. It was so good that i ordered two more starter!!  In the main course we had laal maas & kofta nazuk with kulcha and butter naan. The best part it the cost. It is extremely affordable and full value for money. Planning to go back soon.

I don't usually rate or write reviews about the places I visit but when it comes to Spicekraft, it would've been wrong if I didn't! Being very close to the college I've graduated from, the Dept. Of Law, C.U. or the Hazra Law College as it's known, the location is just perfect.

It was our first visit to this place, my friend and I, on the 8th of February, 2017.

We had heard so much about their Dajaj Chermoula and the Beer Can Tempura Fish that we ordered those before anything else. The chicken was brilliant and the fish was cooked to utmost perfection!
I was really eager to try their LIIT and it was an absolute delight!

We tried another chicken delicacy on the entre√® menu, served on long sticks and pudina/coriander dip as suggested by the staff, the name of which I can not recall (it wasn't the LIIT that did this to me or was it? :P). It tasted good too.

For the main course, we kept it simple with Chilli Garlic noodles and Chicken in Sichuan sauce.

To wrap it up, we ordered their celebrated boozert, the 100% Jack Daniel's Swiss Chocolate Mouss√®. The chef had himself explained the dessert to us! We simply LOVED it!

The staff is polite and adept in advising the people on the choice of dishes. Delectable food, exotic cocktails, prompt service and the lovely decor makes this place one of my favourites. I'll definitely visit again soon, this time with my entire family!

Thank you zomato reviewers for helping me have a go at this gem of a restaurant in ballygunge. Spice kraft was really like a breath of fresh air. A restaurant which makes you want to go back again and again for its brilliant starters. However first things first, I do have some complaints about its hygiene. It's a beautifully embellished eatery but the thing that freaked me out was that the regular water that they serve remains uncovered before serving. The moment I noticed that I ordered for mineral water. So I think if anyone visits this place, take a note to ask for mineral water. Now to the food:

For starters we had,
DAJAJ CHERMOULA-- Truth be told, I have never had such beautifully charred meat before in my life. The char was spot on and the presentation is breathtaking. The meat actually falls off the bones and has a juicy succulent texture.

BEER CAN TEMPOURA FISH-- The fish batter was beautiful to taste. The outer layer was crisp while the fish was creamy and smooth. However you might get a slight smell of the basa fish which may not be delectable to some (depends on ur personal taste). Full marks for presentation.

LYMWN SAMAK-- The star of the show. No doubt, this will remain in my memory as one of the best starters I have ever had. The fish was cooked to perfection, if the word perfection can describe such beauty. The Lebanese delicacy surely will be the starter I will most recommend. The sauce served with it complements the dish perfectly.
To the mains, we went for,

CHICKEN HAKKA NOODLES-- Hands down, the best hakka noodles I have ever had. The proportion of meat to veggies was perfect. Yet, immoderately small quantity... Not even enough for two I would say.

CHICKEN IN MASSAMAN CURRY--For me, this was the only downer of the day. I felt it is an overtly hyped dish. The taste of coconut is so overwhelming that I found it hard to concentrate on any of the other flavours.

Finally the show stoppers of today were the desserts.

CLASSIC MONTE CARLO-- Classic indeed. It would be sinful not to have a go at this dessert if you are in spice kraft. Surely deserves its fame. Delectable to the last bit!

FRIED ICE CREAM--Another beauty. This is the first time I tried ice cream that is fried and I must say, it blew me away to the moon and back.. Highly recommended!!
Service was quick and top notch coupled with a quaint ambience for a nice family meal.
So, a wonderful experience at spice kraft leading to the longest of my reviews. However, I had no choice. The place deserves the effortüòá

The best starters I have ever had Period. 
I ordered mojito and their signature starters.Dajaj charmoula, beer can tampura fish stay on top of all starters I have experienced so far. 
Nasi goreng and and Hunan fish as main course kept its standard at par. I could not try the dessert as I was really full.
Looking forward to pay another visit for Shephard's pie and Jack Daniel mousse. 
Ambience is good,nicely decorated. Prompt service and courteous staff all are really impressive but it is the food which stands tall. 
Highly recommended !

In my honest opinion, this is perhaps the best budget restaurant in Kolkata right now. Their innovative cocktails are worth drooling over. Full marks for their apt service,beautiful garnish and amazing hospitality.
 Try out soy based drums of heaven and beer battered tempura fish.

Good food and ambience, but extremely bad service. We were seated after 30 mins, and the waiter came in after another 15 mins for order. Within 10 minutes of that, before the starters were served, they called out last order. Multiple other instances of poor service made it a bad experience even with good food. This is simply not acceptable from a restaurant of this stature.

In the Summer season ahead let your palate rejoice too! As new food entrants to the city are jostling for space in your cluttered mind through your stomach, it is only once in a while, that one strikes gold. I dedicate this year's celebrations to the fast emerging, trendy Global Gastronomy. Spaces that encapsulate future of flavours and let cultures explode on your palate. We hit the nail with our first visit to Spice Kraft, Sambit Banik's brand new introduction venture at the heart of busy the Ballygunge junction.

DECOR
You know there is something different when a restaurant at its early lunch hours is opened by a young man, the chef cum owner ushering you in. Be warned and pre-plan your parking though, it is impossible on this busy thoroughfare. Inside, it is a work of professional interiors. All wood and glass with suspended false ceiling featuring muted mood lighting, fancy music, but a bit loud for my sensibilities. The highlight is the chic floor to ceiling display wine wall and the daylight washed show tables. There are more rooms to the space, named Lyon, Benaras and this is the Front Hall.

FOOD
The menu unfolds another story. How, professor turned chef Sambit, worked his way through management school till he found his calling as a moonlighting chef. And then went globe trotting to top ranking culinary schools to develop his passion into professional training. The result is in front of us - the eclectic new world tastes in the menu. We order from Chef's Signature Entrees,We have no space for the house-style alcohol infused fancy desserts and the much hyped Molecular Mojitos and Krafty Vodkatinis has to wait, we promise we'll be back soon.

I have been waiting to try the awesome food here,ever since this place started making waves on the Kolkata food scene. True to its name ,the chef and the management seriously know their craft very well. Pleasing and welcoming ambience, beautiful dim light setting , aesthetically designed interiors and above all delicious fusion ,asian, oriental and continental fare. 
Recently visited the place with three of my friends,we were meeting for supper. Being hardcore foodies we ordered quite a few dishes ,which came recommended from their talented chef itself.
To begin with ,my supper began with their popular mocktail -cucumber cooler and pain killer ...simply refreshing with a surprise chilli kick . A must try , it goes very well with the starters. 
For starters we ordered their famous dajaj Chamoula , beer can tempura fish,fish -en-papillote ,(this smoky , delicious and moist fish is 5 star quality ,do not miss this,if you are planning to visit Spice Kraft.
For main course we gorged on moon fan rice, chicken in massaman curry ,prawns and hakka noodles. The taste is incomparable and serving portions are considerably very good.
We satisfied our sweet tooth cravings with their sinfully goooood desserts classic monte Carlo and fried icecream. The fried icecream was super good with a crunchy ,nutty crust .
I can't wait to go back for more . This place now features in my list of top 5 Kolkata restaurants. I am sure you will have the same opinion once you've visited Spice Kraft.
Bon Appetit!

This place is very much go with the proverb " don't judge a book by its cover".... If u see from outside, it is quite modest but from inside it's quite impressive. If u call it a good romantic dine out , its absolutely perfect. Ambience and interior would be very much accustomed with your mood , mild jazz will create the dinning atmosphere. 
 Now come to food...in a word Delicious. There mouthwatering delicacies will definitely make u more hunger than u actually are. According to me this is one of the best "Fusion" restro in the city. 
 They have good varieties of üç∏cocktails but I would prefer everyone to try "MOLECULAR INFUSION"...as these techniques are hardly used in Kolkata. But as usual beer based drinks were not available.
 Food is undoubtedly awesome. Although starter and dessert will impress u rather same old main course which u will get every other restaurant...so don't expect much in main course. Classic Monte Carlo as dessert totally blow my mind...and john Daniel's was really 100%...so its for everyone they should give it a try.
 Food delivery timing is excellent and waiters were quite cooperative with the menus. 
 Dajaj Chermoul and tempura fish is must try one the list and classic Monte Carlo as dessert, hardly u will find it in city

This was my second visit at the restaurant and it did not disappoint. 
We ordered the favorites - Dajaj Charmoula, Beer can Tempura fish, Lymwn Samak, Moon Faan, Nasi Goreng and Mandarin Fish with Chicken. 
Every item was spectacular and awe inspiring and the sauce provided with each made it reach a different level. The only normal item there was the Mandarin fish.. But it's good enough. 
Creativity was showcased in the way the dishes were presented. 
Even the cocktails tasted superb! 
Finally we finished off with 100% Jack Daniel's mousse.. Oh it was lovely! A must try! 
Overall a lovely experience!

Finally I ticked off another restaurant from my bucket list! Spice Kraft it is! Located opposite to Hazra Law College, this restaurant has been getting the hype ever since it opened. 

Last week, I visited this place with 3 of my buddies for an early dinner. Luckily we found the seat, as it was around 7pm. The d√©cor is really pleasing to eyes complete with dim lighting and beautiful ceiling art. 

We started our meal with a range of drinks from which I selected 2 cocktails - Action 20000 and The Painkiller. Both the drinks were amazing, but my favourite was The Painkiller which had a distinct fruity flavoured.

Having heard amazing reviews about their starters, we decided to order a number of them which were suggested by Chef Sambit himself! These included :

‚Ä¢ Beer Can Tempura - The presentation is one of a kind where the the fried fish is served in a beer can. The fish was extremely flavourful and soft. It was served with a sweet orange ponzu tartar sauce. Full marks for this dish.

‚Ä¢ Dajaj Chermoula - The chicken had an amazing spicy marination and was char grilled to perfection. It was served with ginger sauce and the meat was extremely soft. This dish blew my mind with its fantastic taste and presentation. 

‚Ä¢ Lymwn Samak - This is a Lebanese delicacy prepared with utmost care at Spice Kraft. The fish was grilled with a hint a lemon, making it juicy and succulent. 

‚Ä¢ Fish-en-papillote - The pieces of fish were wrapped in paper and had a smoky taste. This dish again turned out to be one of the best items of the evening! The fish was so so delicately prepared with all the flavours kept intact. 

Coming to the main course, we ordered the Moon Fan Rice with Chicken in Masaman Curry, followed by Hakka Noodles with Prawns in Fragrant Coriander Sauce. All the above dishes were cooked brilliantly, and tasted extremely good. My favourite however, is hands down the Chicken in Masaman Curry. 

It was time for desserts, and we opted for Chocolate Monte Carlo and Fried Ice-cream. This was a sinful ending to our beautiful dinner. Both the desserts were very appealing, to the eyes as well as the taste buds!

One of my best experiences so far, Spice kraft is a true beauty which needs to be visited more than once. I'm definitely coming back to try their continental dishes! The best part of the evening was the hospitality that we received from the Chef himself! Spent a beautiful evening with my friends over some delicious food.

If Zomato would have allowed me I would have given a 10/10 to this resto-bar!Value for money, extremely courteous staff, and mouth watering dishes makes this place a much-loved eatery in the Kolkata gastronomic circuit.I went there on a Wednesday evening around 6:30 and immediately got a table.Unlike the upcoming eateries in the city which gives u a feel of "downtown¬†Manhattan" or a "slice-of-Italy", this place has been done up simply and sophisticatedly with a warm family feel to it.Pretty canvases on the wall, dim lights, and classic English Instrumental music made for quite an ambiance.I especially loved the wooden trucks on the table holding the salt and pepper sprinklers.We were ushered in a room adjacent to the kitchen and it had a pretty family feel to it.We ordered the Shish Taouk, the Dajaj¬†Chermoula and the Lymwn¬†Samak as our starters, all Lebanese delicacies, the first two were chicken delicacies and the third one a fish item.Food arrived in less than 10 minutes and we were bowled over.The meat and fish were perfectly cooked, soft, tender and juicy, infused with aromatic spices.Especially the Lymwn Samak was out-of-the-world.As we gorged on the food, one of the crew members actually walked up and explained to me their innovative French way of cooking.For the mains, we settled for the Moon Faan, a rice from the Ming Dynasty, after having weighed our other choices like the Nasi Goreng.We also ordered the Chicken in Oyster and Mushroom.As usual, the food was served promptly and I loved the Chicken in Oyster sauce with succulent mushrooms.The exquisite menu, the delectable food, the super friendly crew and the pocket pinch being extremely reasonable, we simply loved the gastronomic adventure that day!Congratulations to team Spice Kraft!P.S I couldn't get enough of the Lymwn Samak so I got it packed again for dinner!

A truly brilliant restaurant. The place might be a little small and might seem a little dimly lit, but the decors are perfect. The real gem is their food and at the price point they offer it. Their signature dishes, Dajaj Chermoula & Beer-battered Tempura Fish, are never to miss. Cocktails are very good and not watered down like many places. Great place to go with friends as well as families.

The food was good although had some fancy names which I thought was unnecessary. The restaurant is not doing its maintenance bit.

This restaurant truly justifies its exceptional rating on Zomato. Being relatively new to Kolkata, it was kind of tough to find this place, but thanks to GPS, we finally got there.

The looks from outside is very ordinary, but all that changes once you step inside. It has a warm ambience that immediately makes you like this place. The food and drinks here are fantastic. I wanted to order a LIIT but server recommended me Hammer Jack, and it was phenomenal. My wife ordered a martini. The cocktails here have a generous amount of alcohol so please drink responsibly :).

We ordered the signature dishes - Chicken Charmula, Beer Tempura Fish and the Jack Daniel Mousse. We had chinese for the maincourse. All the dishes were carefully prepared and uniquely plated. The staff is super courteous and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch.

This place is a MUST VISIT.

Spice Kraft had been in my list for a long long time and finally I got a chance to visit it for lunch.The ambience is quite soothing and the decor is also good.Spice Kraft is known for serving innovative food that is delicious at the same time and I would totally agree with that. We decided to order a few mocktails before our starters.

Mocktails 
‚Ä¢ Cucumber Cooler - A perfect drink for the summer,the taste is really refreshing and it looks quite attractive too.

Starters 
The Starters were the real attraction and I loved them !!

‚Ä¢Dajaj Chermoula - Simply one of the best starter I have had the chicken was perfect and the presentation of the dish was great too.The Dip served with it was also awesome 

‚Ä¢BeerCan Tempura Fish - Another good starter served in a Budweiser can this is another dish which is well presented,the taste is also great the outer layer is crisp and the inner part is moist and really soft and juicy.

‚Ä¢Red Pepper Prawns - This prawn dish was also decent,the prawns were  well cooked and it was also tasty.

Main Course
‚Ä¢Nasi Goreng (Rice) - It is an indonesian dish and it also tasted good and was served with a fried egg on top which was really good.
‚Ä¢Hunan Fish - Great Gravy and another fish item from the house of spice kraft which was incredible and the pieces of fish were also quite large and soft.Not being a regular fish eater I was surprised that I loved all the fish dishes here as they were all well prepared and cooked to perfection.

Desserts
‚Ä¢Classic Monte Carlo- As the name suggests a classical dessert.Scoops of Vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate cake.

‚Ä¢ 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Calebaut - A perfect blend of alcohol and sweetness.The Mousse was creamy and was perfect not too sweet and the sponge cakes were soft and great to taste. A perfect combination.

A great experience and the owner & chef Sambit is a great guy he came to our table and asked about the meal and explained to us some of the dishes.

Highly Recommended Place.Will surely visit again to try out other items in their menu.

Spice Kraft is one place which I had been planning to visit since a long time. And finally I visited this place with my friends a few days back. It was a weekday evening and we luckily got a table for four without waiting.

The place was wonderful and is perfect for a family dinner or with a group of friends. The ceiling looked amazing. The menu is vast, and we had a tough time to plan our order. It was Chef Sambit who personally attended us and helped us with his valuable suggestions. I personally love places where the level of hospitality is this high !

Among the drinks, I tried two cocktails Action 20000 and Painkiller. They sound like medicines but actually tasted amazing. Both were chilled and equally refreshing.

It was the food for which I was eagerly waiting. The service was pretty fast, that too on a crowded evening. The starters were served even before we had finished half of the drinks.

The Beer Can Tempura Fish was served in a beer can. The fish was soft and delicate while the outer coating was crispy. The orange ponzu taratar sauce was sweet and went well with the fish. This is their most hyped dish and it definitely deserves all the hype.

Dajaj Chermoula was the second amongst the most popular dishes here. I was completely lost in the beauty of the chicken. The meat was literally falling off the bone. Yes, it was that soft ! The spicy and smoky flavour was amazing. It would be a sin to visit this place and not try the Dajaj Chermoula.

Lymwn Samak was another Lebanese dish. It was Arabic style lemon flavoured Grilled fish. The delicate texture of the fish is what impressed me the most.

Fish-en-Papillote was another amazing fish starter. The fish was covered in a paper. It had a soft texture, which made it melt in my mouth. The smoky flavour was brilliant as well.

It's difficult to choose which was the best among the starters, since each of them were exceptional. However, I felt the Dajaj Chermoula to be slightly better than the best. Also, each of the distinguished dips served with each starter tasted beautiful.

We decided to have Oriental in the main course. The Moon Fan Rice with Chicken in Masaman Curry tasted amazing. The curry was perfectly done. I would love to recommend the Masaman Curry to everyone visiting this place.

Chicken Hakka Noodles with Prawn in Fragrant Coriander Sauce tasted amazing. The Hakka Noodles tasted nice. The prawns were juicy and succulent.

Finally ending our meal, for desserts we had Fried Ice Cream and Classic Monte Carlo. I personally loved the fried ice cream more. It was sinful. The fried coconut coating tasted out of the world. The Monte Carlo tasted equally good.

Overall, I was more than impressed with everything I tried. Not only in terms of food, this place excels in terms of service and hospitality as well. I'm definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu soon.

Spice Kraft, located near Ballygunge Phari Petrol Pump, is a good one for having Asian, Continental & Mid Eastern delicacies. Visited this place with a friend few days ago. We had

‚óè Dajaj chermoula : Chicken, marinated with chermoula spices & grilled. One of the best starters. Fall apart tender. It was really mouth watering. 5/5

‚óè Virjin mojito: 3.5/5

‚óè Blue frappe: 4.5/5

‚óè Non veg fried rice: 4/5

‚óè Mandarin fish with chicken: 4/5

Food was really good. Qualiy of all the items was commendable.

Ambience: (4.5/5) Nice & relaxing ambience with peaceful music, comfortable seats, stylish interior. The wall decorations, dim light, bottles of wine at the corner manage to give this place a classy feel.

Service was okay. Our meal was of around 1100 Rupees, which was pretty reasonable.

overall, nice experience. Would love to come back here again.

There are a number of reasons why this place is one of the best rated restaurants of South Kolkata. It is very easy to locate. You have to take the lane towards Hazra Law College from Ballygunge Phanri and after walking for a couple minutes you see Spice Kraft on your left. Their ambience is beautiful with soothing lights that pleases you automatically. Their food is lip-smacking. What more can you probably ask for?

Food and drinks we had :

1. Kokum Rita : A refreshing mocktail, not very sweet and hence was perfect for me.

2. Dajaj Charmoula : One of the most recommended starters here. They serve you chicken kebabs in cups,with a curd based dip that catalyses the taste. 

3. Beer can tempura fish : Beer battered fish fries. Tastes perfect! 

4. Red pepper prawn : Prawns tossed in a tangy and spicy sauce and served in skewers. This is a must have for prawn lovers. 

5. Nasi goreng : Spicy red rice served with a poached egg and prawn chips. Very tasty!

6. Hunan Fish : This is slightly bland in taste,but good for people who prefer a light gravy. 

7. Spicy orange peel chicken : This was my favourite. Chicken cooked in a orange based spicy gravy. This is a very unique dish and I absolutely loved it.

8. 100% Jack Daniel's and Barry Callebaut : Molecular gastronomy at its best. They make the mousse with nitrogen di oxide and the sponge they serve with it are also fresh made. A must have too!

This place was on my mind for a very long time. Finally I scrounged some time to taste their delicacies. 
The decor is pleasing, the music is very soothing indeed. We ordered the Virgin Mojito and the Rainbow mocktail. Both were refreshingly cool and perfect to beat the heat. 
Amongst the wide array of appetizers, we ordered the Dajaj and Beer Can Tempura. The dishes were made to perfection and served with innovate dips. 
From the main course we ordered Sheermal which is an Afghani bread, it was a little too flaky but tasted different with a sweetish tinge to it. Then we ordered Lal Maas, a Rajasthani mutton preparation. There was an authentic Rajasthani vibe to it. Dal Makhani tasted like a proper one. Absolutely loved it. 
Then we ended the course with the much hyped Jack Daniel's Boozert. The mousse tasted fine, expected it to be a bit better. 
The service is fast and the staff is extremely genial. Great place for a casual lunch.

Spice Kraft is a fusion restaurant serving gourmet food and drinks to its customers. 
We ordered the rainbow and virgin mojito drinks. While the mojito was good , the rainbow didn't really play well with its flavours. It had orange juice , grenadine and blue cura√ßao but somehow the flavours didn't match up. 
For food we had what everyone always has. The beer can tempura and the dajaj chermoula. The tempura fish was amazing , the batter being crispy and the fish inside being tender. The dip with which it was served had the sweetness of orange and the pungency of mustard. It went well with the fish. The dajaj chermoula was a dish from Lebanon , and was served on separate bowls with cucumber and a block of wood in it. It was really good as it had the really earthy flavour of the wood and the spices were mild. It was served with sweet yogurt and burnt garlic which might seem a bit odd , but tasted good nonetheless. 
For main course we had laal maas, dal makhani , naan and sheermal. Laal maas was good , the meat was cooked well and the gravy was exceptional. The dal makhani had a really which flavour of tomato and I loved that. Naan and sheermal were good only. The sheermal was very flaky and turned out to be hard. 
We had the jack daniel's mousse for dessert. The dessert consisted of the mousse and cake. The mousse tasted okay and the cake was good too. 
The restaurant serves very good food with an extensive menu , friendly staff , however , the service was a bit slow. Nevertheless , the experience was a good one.

My brother recommended this place, I was little apprehensive initially but I gave in to his choice and went to this place in Ballygunge. On a weekday night, the place was quite full and my friend who reached first had to wait for a table. I guess 10 minutes of waiting and he managed to get a table for 4. We ordered for a plate of Green Chilly Chicken and the drinks on offer. The Green Chilly Chicken was little spicy but the super-saver offer on drinks, 100 Pipers Combo and Cocktails Combo, made up for it. We also ordered for the highly recommended Beer Can Tempura Fish, it was not only a delight for the taste-buds but also for the eyes (it was served in a beer can). For the mains, we ordered for Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Cantonese Noodles and Mandarin Fish with Chicken. Their servings were pretty good. All of this was enough food for the four of us. For taste, I would give a rating of 4.0. 

My friend found a tiny copper string in the Fried Rice and we immediately reported the same to the staff. He took the entire serving of Fried Rice and Mandarin Fish and Chicken and replaced that with a completely new one. The Chef came to us in person and apologised for the same. I found this extremely sweet and he was modest enough to come out and explain the situation. Such mistakes happen unintentionally but what remains in the memory is such a sweet gesture. Full points to the Chef and the Spice Kraft Team for that. I would recommend this place to everyone looking for great food in a reasonable price.

Spice Kraft is a gem of a restaurant located near phari petrol pump. The location is amazing and you can easily get parking.
What you MUST TRY 
‚ñ™Ô∏èBEVERAGES
Cucumber cooler : exactly what you need this summer. Dont miss it out. Its a favourite. 
Red Grape and Basil Twister : Another fun drink who enjoy the red fruit with a minty hint. 
‚ñ™Ô∏èSTARTERS
Dajaj Charmoula : Its a crowd favourite and why not. Succulent chicken with a bit of char. Absolute winner!
Fish en Pappilote : It basically means fish in parchment paper. Fish and cream has always been a great combination but here the balance was perfect and another winner. 
Lymwm Shamok : Another fish preparation which i absolutely loved. 
Beer can tempura fish: This popular dish is a great appetiser to pass around while enjoying your drinks
*now all these appetisers came withe the best and most unique dips complementing the proteins perfectly*
‚ñ™Ô∏èMain Course
At this point i am almost half full. I chose to have the chinese main courses
Nasi goreng Rice: at most restaurants they make it too buttery but here that was case. Indeed it was very tasty
To the people who dont want to have Nasi goreng , order Moon Faan. Its a sort of fried rice with mushrooms and egg. 
Hunan Fish: Oh my god!! Loved it. Must try!! 
Spicy Orange peel chicken : A very unique dish and the gravy was out of the world. Its sort of a play on sweet and spicy chicken.
‚ñ™Ô∏è DESSERTS 
my favourite section!
JD Infused mousse : The mousse was rich and chocolaty. Another popular item
Monte Carlo : For the people who prefer non alcoholic dessert. This is perfect. Two scopes of ice cream chocolate and vanilla with crumbs of chocolate cake! Perfect.  
 
In short Spice Kraft offers what most restaurants in kolkata dont... Innovation, that to at a very reasonable price. A family dinner of 6 with all these items will cost around 3k. 
Stomachs happy. And Pockets happy.

Now, Spice Kraft has been on the top of charts of most of Calcutta foodie fraternity's hitlist. Thus, went I to put a mark on that hitlist.

Mocktails I love and so were ordered. I tried the Red grape & basil twister.It was on the sweeter side and hence suited my preference. For starters it was Beer Can Tempura Fish and Dajaj Chermoula. Its their best on the menu as have been mentioned in other reviews.And indeed, they were good.Beer Can Tempura came in a beer can and hence the name.The fish was soft and melts in the mouth.Now the main course was Nasi Goreng and Hunan Fish which was also really very good. I had 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Mousse for dessert. The name may sound quite heavy but the dish is really very cute. The dish consists of white circular spunges soaked in Jack Daniels and there is a mud-like part as well which is the sweeter part. Trust me, that's one of the best dessert that I have encountered till now.
I'd come back for the ones left on the menu.Happy Dining!

Another visit to this jewel of a restaurant located on the road just beside the Petrol Pump at Ballygunge 7 point crossing. And this time, I tried Bacardi Infused Chicken sausages and Coq Au Gratin. They were delicious to say the least. The chef has done quite a commendable job on presenting some of the dishes which are basically fusions of diff cuisines and the chicken sausages is one such dish. The cute presentation of it what intrigued me. Little syringes stuck onto cucumber like pieces of Chicken sausages. All you had to do was inject the Bacardi into those sausages and take a bite.These innovations are what makes me come back here again and again.

Whether its continental,asian or middle eastern Spice Kraft has excelled their name. In terms of molecular gastronomy too, this restaurant knows no boundaries as well. Spice Kraft had been in my bucket list and finally i gave a visit to this place.

I went there for lunch with my friends and i was bowled away by their service and quailty,quantity and presentation of the food. 

Before starters we had some beverages. We had:

1. Cucumber Cooler- it was quite refreshing and soothing. The colour was of the drink was quite pleasing and soothing to the eye.

2.Kokum Rita- this one was my favourite. It was fruity yet so delicious and refreshing. 

3.Red Grape and Basil Twister-this too was good. The combination was superd.

For starters we had:
1.Dajaj Charmoula-they are served with a dip. They are amazing. One should definately try this item. #highlyrecommended

2.Beer Can Tempura Fish-  they are crispy outside and soft and juicy inside. When you bite into it, first tou get the crunchiness from the top and then you get the smoothness and juicyness from the fish. #highlyrecommended

3. Fish-en-papilotte: Spice kraft knows how to present fish dishes beautifully and with full of flavours. This dish is a fine example of it. This wrapped fish is full of flavours.

4. Red Pepper Prawn: this too was yummy and delicious. Spicy with a hint of tangyness defines this dish.

5. Lymwn Samak- anothet fishy dish which i liked also too. It was soft and creamy.

For main course we had:
Moon Faan and Nasi Goreng- these are rice based dishes. I would suggest go for Nasi Goreng for its tasty and delicious and you wont be disappointed. The Moon Faan too had a subtle taste and it was quite good when coupled with the side dishes we had.

Hunan Fish- nothing special to mention about. Was quite good.

Spicy Orange Peel Chicken- it may seem not quite appealling and tasty but trust me you should try this. Its full of flavours. I just loved this dish. The fruityness and sweetness from the orange coupled with the bursting flavours of the spicyness and chicken is a match made in heaven combination. 

For desserts we had:

Classic Monte Carlo- i had the best monte carlo here. Its a piece of heaven in a glass. Can you go wrong with this one? Do try this one.

100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut- so those who love alchohol and loves the combination of alchohol and desserts, well go for this one. The presentation is simply beautiful. It contains chocolate mousse, drunken  petit fours and a reduction which contains alchohol. One word i must say its out of this world its just heaven. The mousse is so creamy and smooth and  these circular things are soft and the whole thing when taken together is just wonderful.

I had a wonderful experience. 
Will come back? Ofcourse why not. Highly Recommended.

Spicekraft really knows the art and craft of food! 
We had beer can tempura fish and lemon and butter fish for starters. Both of these dishes were excellent. The lemon , butter fish was one of the best fish dishes that I've ever had!

For main course we had Nasi Goreng, kulcha and amritsari fish! Nasi goreng wad average, I found it to be somewhat dry. The kulcha too, was average. The anmritsari fish was spot on- Soft,succulent pieces of fishes in a rich cashew based gravy! 

I am definitely going back to this place!

The restaurant is located in ballygunj near to ballygunj Phari... The seating area is quiet comfortable. The music is soothing. We ordered beer can tempura fish. The fish was well baked. The batter was very good . The dish was served in a Budweiser can. We also ordered Dajaj charmoula. This dish is sort of tengri kebab but more soft and tasty. I just loved this dish. On drinks we ordered the mango driver cocktail which was quiet good. Coming to desert part we opted for 100% Jack Daniels & barry Callebaut. It was moose with orange candy syrup and pudding. The flavour of JD was quiet predominant. I just loved the dessert. One con is that there was no beer at 10pm. I m a beer guy so will think next time before going there.

Some 'innovative dishes' you get with a nice ambience. 'Deconstructed Papdi Chat' - try this. With just 1 spoon you get whole taste of Papdi Chat. It costs Rs 120 for 2 spoons amount. But the experience is different. Try a dish called 'Kele ke phool'. It tastes really good. Other things that you can try, 'Kool Cucumber', 'Tangy Mandarin & Lemon grass shock' in beverages. Also you can try 'Egg Foo- Yong Canapes' in food.

Not only is it value for money but the sheer variety and standard of their food and drinks is par excellence.¬†
I hope they keep it up, wish them good luck!
                    
Small recommendation for their management team - they should include how spicy a dish is on their menu. Most restaurants include the level of spiciness of a dish in their menu. It is really helpful. Not everyone can eat spicy food.

Decor and ambience: very classy and elegant, nice music which cn be played at a lower volume and a roadside view to add to it

Food and menu: Continental and chinese offerings on the menu, we had  cucumber mocktail, doodh cola, moon fan fried rice, pan fried fish and one more side dish having both chicken and fish and everything was well made with the nocktails standing out and the side dish but the fried rice and pan fried fish could have been better

Staff: staff are good and courteous and Service is quick

We went there as a team dinner, and the first thing we had noticed was the ambiance, which was pretty brilliant. Waiting time was moderate, and service was quite good in all aspects. As non-veg starters, Tempura Fish, Dajaj Charmoula and Fried Baby Octopus were marvelous. A veg starter starting with "Kele-ke-Phool" was equally wonderful but hard to pronounce. Nashi Goreng was moderate but the only thing which disappointed us was Roast pork with Rendang curry. Jack Daniels Chocolate Mousse was one of it's kind dessert and surely a must eat.

Located in Ballygunge. 

Ambience - Since we went for lunch in this summer, this place helped us somehow to beat the scorching heat outside. The decor was so classy with a lil bit of Punjabi style. üòç

Food - Had a Cucumber Mocktail, Doodh Cola, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Moon Faan Rice, Mandarin Fish with Chicken and Classic Monte Carlo. 
*Cucumber Mocktail was fine.
*Doodh Cola was good.
*Pan Fried Chilli Fish was good. Although pieces could have been made more softer.
*Moon Faan Rice was okay. It was cold while it was served. So didn't feel good to the taste buds.
*Mandarin Fish with Chicken could have been much better. The gravy tested somewhat like Chilli Chicken. 
Overall food was fine. ‚ù§

Service - It was really impressive. The Staffs were courteous and well informed. The Manager was interacting one to one. It was really good. Service time was also good. üòç

Overall, you can visit this place. Won't disappoint you. ‚ù§

This restaurant is a hidden gem! The food is served with a lot of difference here. The quality and the taste of food is just amazing. The beer tempura fish, chicken charmoula and the jack daniels mousse blew my mind away.. A must try in your first visit.  We also tried a bit of chinese for main course, that was very finely done. The only place to work on will probably be the cocktail. The LIIT wasnt one of my favourite that evening. Overall,  i am highly recommending the place. Its a must try.

This place is bliss. Everything was perfect.
Starting from ambience, a beautiful restaurant with warm lighting and cool decorations, it won my heart as soon as i entered though from outside,it looks like an old place (don't judge book by cover)
Then the staff, helpful, always to your need and we celebrated our close friend's birthday awesomely. They even gave a complimentary dessert.
Coming to the food, it was DELICIOUS
We started with cocktails
Blue electric, L.I.I.T, Bellini
I loved my blue electric and LIIT was very very strong, so only for heavy drinkers
Then we went to the starters Lymwn Samak and Murg Kothmiri Kebab.. god the samak is a must try.
Then for main course we had Mixed Fried Rice, Khabsa with Khor Khog and Roast Pork in Rendang Curry
Khor khog was very good and so was roast pork.
Then we cut the cake we brought and ate the complimentary dessert
The seasoning in mixed fried rice was a bit bad but otherwise everything was great.

Last night visited with two old school pals for dinner....Place is very easy to reach and interior has got some good positive appeal. As far as drinks are concerned they offer some packages for spirits. We availed their vodka and whiskey offer, and it really saved our pockets.. Now coming to their dishes., we tried beer can tempura fish, hong shao rou which is a Chinese pork item, lymen samaki- a Lebanon chicken item..  That juicy beer can tempura is worth mentioning, simply loved it.. Other dishes are also good. In main dishes that Lucknow dum biriyani  was properly cooked with great nicely blended flavors. Nawabi dum ki murg also satisfied our taste buds... So its a must go place for all who love to experiment with foods along with some good liquors..

The visit to this restaurant two days back was one of the best experience in the recent past..First of all the staffs ‚Äãare very polite and well-mannered which creates a warm welcoming atmosphere..Secondly there decoration is also eye-catching..And finally the food blew us away..The L.I.I.T and Kir-royale tasted heavenly..And the L.I.I.T was really toxic..Dajaj Chermoula(one of their highly recommend dishes) served with a dahi kind of sweet dip, went great with the drinks..the soy-braised drums of heaven(oldmonk flambe) contained all the right quantity of spices..In the main course Coq-au-vin(a classic continental dish) served with buttered rice and sprinkled oregano was beyond our expectation..It tasted so different yet so perfect..We were too full to order any desert.The experience was too good and am very much sure I am going back,this time for their boozerts and Dajaj Chermoula once again.And I won't say the pocket pinch is too high for the quality and the variety of food they serve.
P.S. the presentation of their food will melt your heart.

The ambience is really romantic..though located on the main road,yet its very calm inside. We had Sheperd's pie,Bellini cocktail and Blue electric cocktail,everything tasted good. Sheperd's pie was juicy n mouth melting..food is really great over here! And tax is not high.

Went there twice the last week... bang on balltgunge phari, da place that used to house a branch of silver oak nd then changed itself to a place called Tandoori Nights, is now called spice kraft. 
Mah first visit was during da weekend on a rainy Saturday evening, had to wait for an hour or more for a table, so reservation I would say is a must if the plan is for a visit down on da weekends. Da other time was today, i.e on a weekday, getting a place prompto wasn't a problem. 
Da ambiance is pretty good, dimly lite, I found it a bit too dim though, da staffs friendly nd offer great suggestions for food n cocktails. da menu is a bit too vast n covers various Asian cuisines so its a bit confusing with da order.

Da food da drinks, da cocktails, all are quiet innovative and the best part is da place is pretty reasonably priced for da quality n quantity they offer. Reasonably priced scotch is da best bit.
We ordered this starter called beer can fish tempura its really bhetki fry, named n served fancily, innovative as in its served inside an empty can of budwiser..crispy n fresh but the dip on offer kinda takes the sheen and taste off an otherwise good starter item.
The continental is gud n so is da picks from varities from Asia. Even da recommended desert, 100% jack daniels moose was good to the taste buds..
All in all a nice place to hangout nd for a round of reasonably priced drinks n varieties of food. 
Hope they keep up da good work.

This bar cum restaurant really deserves this high rating....if u really want to try new food or cocktail, this s d place u want to be in Kolkata...unique dishes and cocktails....so if u r a drinker or foodie, u can blindly go there and also the prices are pretty decent compare to the kind of expertise they provide...

If u want to try hard ones in cocktail segment, ask them about some out of the menu cocktails like vapourizer, pain killer etc....the price of these special ones are higher, but it will compensate in alcohol content...

I am kinda happy with this foodie evening of mine.. First of all what attracted me the most while entering this place is the lights and the ambience ( that is the first thing that catches the eye when you enter any restaurant) I had gone with 6 of my friends for my birthday treat! While being escorted to our table.. I saw a glass of drink in every table.. i mean thats where I noticed that drinks should b a mandatory flavour to tongue if you happen to visit here.. And trust me.. they are mandatory.
We ordered Kiwi&Mango Collins.. It just tastes awesome and it almost fills the tongue inside with its creamy flavour and after you swallow it, you ll f8nd a kind of aroma.. However personally, I could not drink that alone.. I needed some other stuff for the change of that aromatic taste and then take a sip again to feel it all over again
We also ordered L.I.I.T for the people who are classic boozers, they ll get the taste.. (I did not taste it though)
Nextly, Dajaj Chermoula here is a compulsory dish for all but personally I did not find it that luscious except for the fact that their presenation in big glass like containers stole the show.. They are more like chikcken pakora (leg pieces) or say chicken tikka..They are well cooked and every bite is well sizzled. And the white dipping in addition to it is sweet enough which isnt necessary enough..
Personally I should suggest you guys to go for Lymwn Samak even for those who dont love fish.. try these.. they are great cooking Lebanese items..and this is a must.. even the dipping is good enough.. Its a "khatta-meetha" pudina kinda sauce! The fish balls just melt within..
For main course we ordered NASI GORENG, HARI MOTI PULAO, NAWABI DUM KI MURG, LAAL MAAS RAJASTHAN, CHEESE NAAN:-

NASI GORENG is good enough.. with an eggpoach on the top.. it tasted like the Chinese fried rice with a beautiful aroma. HARI MOTI PULAO is nothing but matar pulao.. lil oily but good.. often you het some cardamoms or cloves while eating.. So, lil attention for those who don't like Gota Garam Masala into their mouth.. NAWABI DUM KI MURG as stated is from Lucknow, its well cooked.. especially the gravy which is lip smacking.. A must try for those who like the "butter masala" kind of items. MAAS RAJASTHAN was not at all good enough.. they are mutton keema balls dipped in cream and yogurt.. It was too salty and the yogurt just ruined it.. Too creamy and salty:- something which nonveg doesnt go with..
What i liked the most about this restaurant is that the Chef personally attended us to ask about the food.. We were satisfied with other recipes and complained about the LAAL MAAS RAJASTHAN .. and he said that he could have changed it earlier had we pointed out. So this isnt an issue, at all.. Thats what makes me love this place more... CHEESE NAAN is awesome for those who terribly love cheese coz the cheese is stuck on the layer, exactly giving u the melting taste as you bite the naan.. You have to be a bit faster while having this.. else towards the end it tightens up a little
Over all.. I am happy with the service, the drinks and the food that i reviewed above already.. ‚ù§ Also to mention that the quantity of chicken and mutton was low as per our group. So we had to order the same dish twice.. Supratik Chakravarty

This one is really easy to find, being opposite to the Hazra law college. One auto from Hazra more is all you need.

The outlet itself is not very big with around six 4-seaters and a few couple-tables. The ambience is really soothing and the lighting makes is better. Coming to the service, the waiters are extremely well mannered and absolutely proficient; but service is a bit on the slower side.

Now, the food- we're three people and ordered the Beer can tempura fish and a shredded pork dish, Hong Shao Rou, for the starters. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth soft; but the batter could have been better, not worth raving about. The pork was a bit hard, but the taste was truly delightful. We ordered a cucumber vodkatini, cranapple screwdriver and two Budweisers. The cocktails failed to impress, the later one being really light.
But what followed, left us craving for more. For entr√©e, we ordered the chicken stoganoff and coq-au-vin. The later one being one of the best dishes tasted, it's a must order! For desert, we'd the 100% Jack Daniels mousse, again a beautiful preparation. The briefing from the waiter about it, was a cherry on the cake.

The whole spread cost around 2.4k for three which is okayish. Hong Shao Rou and coq-au-vin are two dishes I'd like to recommend. Overall, a pleasant experience.

Just a little walk down the road beside the Ballygunge Phari petrol pump will take you to this place. Great ambience. The insides are well decorated and great music kept playing throughout. The staff is very courteous and helpful to the point of suggesting individual drinks based on our personalities. The quantity of food is decent. Enough for one. The taste though, is otherworldly. It may be slightly on the pricier side but it's totally worth the visit.

A must visit place for the foodies because they have the best to.offer you. I personally suggest please try Chicken Stoganoff and Firecrackers. A really good quality food they have to offer you and most of all the price is reasonable. Approx expense will be around 1200 for two without beverages.

Well this is one of those restaurants which really give you the urge to visit again and again, located at ballygunge, its a real pleasure to dine out here..
The interiors and the decoration were really awsome, on entering the red coloured decorations and the red napkins rightfully shaped into a wonderful design really stand out .. The ambience is really awsome to take your loved once on a date and also dine out with family.
The service as well as the staff were really helpful and jolly in nature.
Now coming to the food , we had ordered tempura fish for the appetizer, it was served in a beer can, 6 pieces of batter fried fish . The coating was really crispy and the fish was soft and succulent.. a really treat for the taste buds.
For the main course we ordered shepherds pie and baked fish wellington.
Shepherds pie was made from minced lamb mixed with mashed potato and cream.. and was nice, the creamy flavour and the taste of the lamb made it a great dish for lamb lovers and served with garlic bread , overall it was a good one.
As for the baked fish wellington, it consisted of bhetki fish in cheese sauce, the flavours of bhetki and cheese mingled together to form a cheesy delight , and served with rice , it was a good combination..
Well to sum it up it is a great reastaurant to dine out with family, and a must visit one.
Personally tempura fish was my favourite and a must try one..

Overall an awesome experience. 
Went on a weekday for dinner after a long and hectic schedule.
To start of with the ambience the restro is neat and clean with a cozy feeling which should be perfect for a couple to dine out.
Coming to the food we ordered:
*Pan fried chilli fish (Which was just yumm)
*Beer can tempura fish( cooked to perfection which should be their signature dish)
*Mixed fried rice (tasted good)
*Chicken and mushroom in chilli oyster sauce (as suggested by one of the staffs was mesmerising )
Ambience - 4.5/5
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4.5/5
All above items within a pocket friendly price of Rs 1000/-.
Would love to visit this place againüòäüòä

This place is simply magic ‚ù§.
Everything out here is perfect.
The food here is a gastronomic delight. Tried the beer can tempura fish made in beer batter it's literally the best fish chips I have ever had. We also ordered the moon pan rice and a prawn dish on the recommendation of the server this again was awesomely tasty.
Coming to the cocktails they serve the best long island ice tea hands down. It hits u from the first sip and we were left carving for more. We also tried the mango driver n really as expected it didn't disappoint either like how can mangoes n vodka clubbed together go wrong.
For dessert we had chocolate mousse made with Jack Daniels n it was also class apart.
Waiting eagerly for my next visit.

Such a fantastic place for a myriad of delicacies. This place truly deserves the phenomenal rating that it has. Kudos!

We had their highly recommended Dajaj Charmoula, Murg Kothmiri Kebab, Shepherds Pie, Rarha Gosth, Nawabi Dum ki Murg, and Masala Kulcha. Every single dish in here was prepared to perfection. A remarkable feat.

The service is stellar. Special mention of Chef Sambit who recommended us these fine dishes and kept checking on us from time to time. The ambience is very cozy, even though the place isn't large. The evening ambience, in my opinion, is much better than the afternoon one (because sparkling lights and all). 
The place is really affordable which was a genuine surprise. Highly recommended.

This is one of the best places I have ever been to. The ambience is great, and so is the service. The service is one of the best over here. The food here is really great. We had Dajaj Chermoula which was yum. The thing that we loved was we were told how the dish is made by tge staff which was really nice to heard. Then we had Shredded Lamb in Masamam Curry and Nasi Goreng. The Masamam Curry was really great With burst of different flavours in it. The rice was also proper presented and was great.

We had
*Soy braised drums of heaven,old monk flamb√©
*Beer can tempura fish
*Deconstructed Papdi chat
*Shepherd's Pie

The molecular gastronomy item,the papdi chat wasn't great,so the 0.5 less.
Drums of Heaven was good,Shepherd's Pie was awesome,and Beer Can Tempura Fish was heavenly! The tartare sauce gives it another dimension.
Bill was 1200 for 4 for these items,20% tax levied. The hospitality is top notch. They allowed us to cut a cake and kept it in the fridge too on our request. I am going back there multiple times to try the other items!

Visited second time!
Had
*Beer can tempura fish : the god
*Dajaj chermoula: not so praiseworthy
*Bacardi limon infused chicken sausage : awesome
*Coq-au-vin : totally different and awesome
*Baked fish wellington : cheesy goodness
*100% JD and berry calibaut choco mousse : different and instagramworthy
The sheer variety and uniqueness of looks and taste of all the items guarantees a 5 this time! üòç

We had been to this place last week for a birthday surprise. We were asked to wait outside, however the staff was able to arrange seats for us. It was really nice of them, we both needed to leave early. 

We had ordered for Beer Can Tempura Fish, Sheperds Pie, Baked Fish Wellington. Kiwi & Mango collins and Rainbow was our thirst quencher moctails. Lastly, our sweet tooth was satieted with Clasaic Monte Carlo  and Choice of Ice creams.

The presentation of Beer Can Tempura Fish was amazing. Few were tucked inside empty budweiser beer cans. It was so delicious. Soft yet crunchy and tasty. 

Next in main course was the Baked Fish Wellington, it tasted like heaven. Lovely, melted in our mouth. Am sure, non-fish lovers will start loving fish.
Sheperds Pie served with Garlic bread. It was tooo much of meat. However, something to be loved by all lamb lovers. 

Desert was also no doubt good. Well presented. Quoting William Shakespeare, "All's well that ends well". 

This is a nice place with good ambience, soft music being played. Service was good. I admired the lights which will uplift the mood. Overall a must place for all food lovers. A place can be visited with family, friend and partners. Also, alcohol is served, hence food lovers and drinkers enjoy the meal.

It was Debangana 's birthday treat and Spice Kraft was our unanimous choice. We ordered for entr√©e Red Pepper Prawn, and Beer Can tempura fish. The Tempura Fish looked beautiful, but wasn't extraordinary. On the other hand, the prawn was so good, we almost ordered a second plate of it.
The Main Course section we chose Dajaj Charmoulla, Baked Fish Wellington and Coq au vin. Dajaj Charmoulla is similar to tengri kebabs, we thought it could've been better. Coq au vin , served with a tiny platter of rice in the centre, is a chicken dish. Baked Fish Wellington was beautifully cooked, with cheese and served with pilaf. For dessert, we chose chocolate mousse with petit fours. Over all, the experience was beautiful. The staff is really friendly. The manager came to us and suggested us what we could try since we were at sea with the wonderful menu. Even the head chef visited almost every table and enquired about whether the food was to the guests' liking at all! The only con, if I would call it a con ie a negative aspect is we had to wait for 45 minutes to get a table. I'd suggest booking a table in advance to avoid what we faced. It was a great experience. Will definitely visit again. Chandrani Chatterjee

So this place is like the new kid on the block for Calcutta's food joint sector. With its offbeat menus and wonderful decor, the place assures a memorable rendezvous with friends. At the end of it all, the bill will bring a smile to your face since the items are priced extremely reasonably. Great place for dinner and drinks.

Went there twice. Once with a friend and then subsequently with my mother. Undoubtedly the BEST PLACE IN TOWN at this moment. The cocktails (had it with the friend, obviously) were really good. I'm very conservative on cocktails yet, the Gin and Tonic and LIIT were spot on. The Mein Foon Rice is great and so are their Indian dishes, which I tried with Mum. Being a "ghoti" with moderate tolerance to spice, the food was perfect although my friend from the other-side felt the dips and chicken needed a little more heat.
Very courteous staff, understands the palate of the customer and gives apt suggestions. 
One con: the interior section is very dimply lit even for two  22 year-olds with corrected eye-sight. Perhaps a little more light would be amazing. Sit out, and this place is sure to stand out.
P.S: The beer can tempura fish beats any other entr√© in its class. Must have.

spice Kraft... I don't even know from where to start.... The service, the food, the decor, the head chef's behaviour and the way he mixes with his patrons! Spice Kraft is the best food joint in Kolkata. When I first went to the place i was really skeptical seeing the menu and the ambience. I thought my 2 months of salary is gonna get flicked tonight! But surprisingly the food was awesome... and prices was really within budget. The service crew.... well let me just say, in the entire Kolkata food industry they are the most well behaved and well trained and always smiling. Some times they actually give u the feel that you have come to their home for a treat! They make u feel at home with hotel standard food. The food.... don't even get me started on there.... its AWESOME! I mean the variety of dishes the way the decorate the dishes and present it to you.... man its too good.¬†Lastly the head Chef (and the owner too, I guess) Sambit.... he is the most lovely and courteous host I have ever seen and experienced in my food hogging and restaurant hopping life! he is a boon to us all foodie's. He interacts with all his patrons and gives them food recommendations based on their food eating choices, habits and taste! Spice Kraft, Sambit and his crew are a boon to all the foodies!

An extremely disheartening experience! Spice Kraft has been on my bookmarked list for quite a time. So yesterday on the occasion of my birthday, I decided to dine here along with my family. We reached there around 9:30pm. We had to wait for around 3-4minutes after which we were offered a table meant for six people. Then we were told that later on we will be shifted to a table meant for four people to which we agreed. So we got seated. We ordered beer..to which the person who came to take the order informed us that no beer is available (whatsoever brand). However he asked us if we would like to try a beer based cocktail. I mean how are you preparing the beer based cocktail without the beer!!
Anyway, he did not have answer to that.
So we had no other option than to move out of the place and go elsewhere.

Don't know if I will be coming back but I am left with very little expectations from this place.

Date of Visit: 15/04/17

Decor/Ambiance: I loved the decor and ambiance. Low lighting with soft music in the background makes up for a pretty romantic ambiance. I went there with my fiance on Poila Baisakh and the ambiance made up for a perfect evening date.

Service/Servers: Prompt service. The servers are very friendly and courteous. They know the menu very well and guide you through it pretty well. They have a very friendly chef who occasionally come up and chats with the customers. One of them even came up and asked me for my feedback on one of their Poila Baisakh special dishes.¬†

Food: Since we went on Poila Baisakh, they had a special menu for the occasion but we didn't go for that in starters or mains. I am a big fan of Lebanese food and this is one of the very few places in Kolkata which offers authentic Lebanese food. I loved the Dajaj Chermoula and Lymwn Samak. The lymwn Smak just melts inside your mouth.¬†
We also ordered a beer can tempura and Bacardi Limon infused Tandoori Chicken Sausages. The Beer Can Tempura was crispy, delicious and one of the best beer based dishes I have had. The chicken sausages were good.
For desserts, I really wanted to try out their popular Jack Daniel's Chocolate Mousse but they weren't offering it on that day. So, I went for one of the desserts on the Poila Baisakh menu. Shaktigarh er Lyangcha with pudding (yes! such an interesting and innovative dish).¬†

Overall Feedback: I loved this place. I am definitely going back again. I have to try out their Jack Daniel's Chocolate Mousse!!

The exterior, the decor, the reception - all look rather okay and may lead you to wonder whether the decision to dine here was really wise.

The food when it comes is really very, very, very good. In fact, it's great - for your eyes and your palate. The icing on the cake is the pricing which is very moderate for the quality.

A very good experience.

Spicekraft has been on my wishlist for a long time. I was so ecstatic to visit this place and try out its experimental cuisines as it is so renowned for its molecular gastronomy. 

Location : It's just a few minutes walk from Ballygunge Petrol Pump towards Hazra.
Look and feel :The interiors are dimly lit and the ambience is very cosy. 

Coming to the food,for the starters we opted for Dajaj Chermoula. It's a Lebanese preparation served with a delectable dip which was so lip smacking and yum. The beer can tempura fish  laid out on a wooden spoon shaped tray along with a special orange dip was such a treat for the eyes. 
For the main course we had Coq-Au-Vin consisting of rice and was surrounded by thick gravy containing succulent chicken pieces and mushrooms. We also opted for the Baked Fish canary. The fish was so juicy, tender and was served in mouthwatering cheesy gravy.

The quantity was adequate and the prices are reasonable too. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I loved  the dishes. Kudos for utilizing the concept of molecular gastronomy and serving the dishes in such a innovative manner.

After a long time me and some of my closest friends set sail to exlore yet another unexplored land of food. This time we anchored at SPICE KRAFT.
@The place is next to Hazra Law College, very easy to locate. Inside there is a common section, which is bit congested and smelly but the separatedining area is very cozy, ambiance is very nice with low light, nice music, beer, wine, food....I am hungry again.
We had Sula Cabernet Shiraz and Budweiser.
Food:
‚Ä¢ Beer can tempura fish with orange ponzu tartar√© - their signature dish, sort of fish batter fry with ample amount of juicy freshly fried fish.
‚Ä¢ Bacardi limon infused tandoori chicken sausages with churan and blueberry coulis - Chicken sausage uniquely served.
‚Ä¢ Devilled crab meat - fresh creamy buttery pure crab meat.
‚Ä¢ Dajaj chermoula - a Labanese delicacy, juicy chicken grilled chicken. Nice lip smacking flavour of tender chicken.
‚Ä¢ Nasi goreng - Indonasian prearation of rice and chicken, good taste but nothing different from chicken fried rice.
‚Ä¢ Shepherd's pie - preparation of minced lamb and mashed potato with butter garlic bread, awesome item.
‚Ä¢ Chicken stoganoff - a russian delicacy of creamy cheesy minced chicken with rice, this was also just yumm.
‚Ä¢ 100% jack daniels and barry callebaut swiss chocolate mouss√® and drunken pet√Æt fours - very nice to taste but quantity is very less compared to the price.

All the foods were well cooked, superb and delicious. All of them are must try. Have to visit few more times to try the other items.
Service was also prompt.

There were only two drawbacks:
1. The common sitting area is a bit smelly.
2. Wine and beer were not chilled and they do not have much of choices in beer though there are plenty in the menu card. They did not have pitcher of beer even.

Overall its above expectation.

Go by the side of Petrol pump of Ballygaunj Phari. It's easy to locate. Went there for dinner. Ordered Naan and Murg da module(Punjabi dish)and their signature dish Dejaj Charmoula. That tastes really good.Chicken pieces are soft and tender.Also we took Blue electric cocktail and the picture didn't came out well.Staffs were cooperative. But we were made to inside where there was neon light and literally it was so dark inside.Photos didn't came out well.Prices of the food were reasonable. Overall a good experience.

Been here twice now. And it's been not such a great experience. the review below is of my last visit which was on 5th May 2017. It was a disaster. The 3 rating is mostly because of the good cocktails they served.
We were two people visiting on a Friday. Waiting was just 2mins. The decor is okay. Seating is too crammed up. Felt congested. And some wierd air freshener made it worse.
Now food. We ordered dadaj cheramoula . It was a chicken leg kebab kind of. Tasted good. Chicken was soft. The dip given alongside was wayyyy too sweet.
We ordered mango screwdrivers. It tasted amazing. And Jamun Mary. It was unique .
Our second started was a haleem kibbeh dish ... This was good also. But from here onwards things went downhill.
Ordered coc au vin . It was very very bad in taste. The gravy was chalky. Chicken wasn't cooked properly. Was smelly. It just ruined the dinner for us. So we.thought without taking chances we would order some simple food. We ordered butter naan and mutton rarah. It was edible unlike the @previous dish. But the tatse of the mutton was not that great. I cook better than that. In between we ordered chai Tini. This cocktail wasn't like the others.not good.
Basically the whole experience was disappointing and the 4.8 rating in Zomato is wrong. This restaurant doesn't deserve it. My first experience already was bad , I made a choice to visit second time just because the ratings was this high. But nope ..that's it.

Too good, just too good. My favourite place to eat in Kolkata since forever. Can never get enough of their creamy Coq Au Vin or that gorgeous Pork ribs or the lovely Devilled Crabs, which by far I think is an absolute showstopper. Sharing two photos of the desert dishes, Monte Carlo and 100% Jack Daniels to just give people some hunger pangs. :)

Visited April 2017. Delectable palate of food!! The Beer Fish was exemplary..with the beer-taste teasing you mildly from the coated fish. Prawns in Coriander sauce was nicely flavoured and crunchy to the y.  The best thing being that Coriander did not weigh down the taste,it was all too light and airy. The LIIT was strong enough to make the world go round by the time I was half done!
Make this your one-must-stop next time in Kolkatta! NQA

One of the best restaurants I have been to. This place os just awesome because they are innovative.

Ambience: The ambience is very soothing with the perfect amount of light, neither too bright nor too dark. The walls are beautifully decorated and some tables have a small toy truck. We walked in without a reservation on a Friday late evening, got our seats immediately. Interestingly, we were waited by the Asst. Manager, Somnath, who guided us through the dinner with perfect choice of food and drinks.

Food: To start with, we had Limon infused tanduri chicken sausage, so palatable that we ordered a repeat; Beer can tempura fish, again awesome; Soy braised drums of heaven, simple awesome. For main course, we had Baked fish Wellington, Coq-Au-Vin and Shepherds Pie.

Drinks: Now comes the interesting and innovative part. I must applaud the Chef in his innovation. Every popular cocktail has hisnown version here like Kokum Rita for Margarita, Mango Driver for Screw driver et al. And, the chef crafted them to perfection.

Overall, the place with 4.8 on Zomato does not need mention of their greatness. But, the wonderful experience repeated everytime is what matters. It is a bit on the dearer side of things, it is all worth it with superb quality of food, drinks and service. Highly recommended.

Spice Kraft is for those who love experimenting with food. The service & the decor is good. But you need to look for their presentation of food.. its so cool! Jack Daniel mousse is a must try.. Think fusion, think Spice Kraft! I have tried only few items from their vast menu, wish to visit again & again & try all the amazing fusions!

I have been wanting to visit this place for quite a while and seeing the 4.8 rating rather increased my expectations. But I was a little disappointed. 
Firstly, it was a bit hot inside the restaurant. The air conditioner didn't seem to be that powerful and it was a sweltering 36 degrees outside. 
Also, the strong incense or scented candles didn't suit me as I am a little allergic to such smells and frankly, the smell ( or fragrance) seemed to be overpowering. 
Now, coming to the food, I am inclined to think that this is kind of a place where you go to try different starters and just skip the main course altogether. We ordered Dajaj Chermoula, Moon Fan Rice and Roast Pork in Rendang Curry. 
Dajaj Chermoula was the highlight of the meal. It is innovative and delicious. The rice was also good. Things went downhill with the Pork curry as there was a kind of overpowering coconut taste which destroyed the dish. I even looked up the recipe online and I have had rendang curry at other places ( high end places I might add) and I don't think the dish is supposed to be like that. I hope the management of Spice Kraft takes note. The prices are very competitive. I have no qualms about that.
I am inclined to give this place another try maybe to try some other entrees and so that I can improve the rating because I like innovation and don't want to give them an average rating. 
Overall, this place deserves a visit and well, I guess our experience was one-off.

Personal favourite. I would recommend to have Lymwn Samak, a fish preparation and Pork Burrah kebab. These are the best two dishes I have ever had in my life (still can't get over it). Did not like the Nasi Goreng though. It was spicy with an odd smell. Moon fan was however good.

Astonishing!! food quality is too good and most importantly not a burden to wallet. Rushed on a Kalbaishakhi evening and this dishes blew us completely..
1. L.I.I.T - Strong cocktail mixed with 5 spirits. A hard hit on the nerves.
2. Beer Can Tempura Fish- Ya I agree this one got a bit extra hype in zomato but it tastes really good.
3. Grilled fish with Lemon Butter Sauce- Extremely delicious. Fish was soft and well soaked into the butter.
4.Deviled crab meat- nothing can be better than this one! damn tasty.
5. JD & Barry Callebaut- The Showstopper! you need to order one to know hows it taste.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall its a complete treat to taste buds.

Visited this place about a week ago. Odered classic orange with sage absolute (vodka base) and margarita (tequila base) as the drinks. Classic orange was really good, but Margarita was "woww". Dajaj chermoula ( a lebenese chicken dish) as the starter made the drinks yet awesome. In main course, ordered moon fan (a Mauritian Chinese fried rice) , hong shao rou ( a Shanghai style pork dish) and spicy orange peel chicken. The rice and the pork dish was damn tasty. Orange chicken was somewhat sweet. Good ambience, great staff members. Pocket pinch was 1.65k.

Located rather interiorly this place was a bit difficult to find! But the food was great. Though it had a slightly high pocket pinch still the food was great! We had a virgin mojito, beer can tempura fish and a lamb preparation. The three were great though I would recommend a slight improvement in the drink! The prices were a bit high, but the ambience was great! Dim lights and all that was required for a great dinner!

we went to celebrate our wedding anniversary but it was almost full so we had to dine in a rather small table...otherwise the ambience was romantic...They suggested us to order "The Terminator" cocktail made of beer and cointreau, which was great. After that we ordered Beer can Tempura fish and Dajaj Charmoula as staters and Shepherd's pie" as a main course , and those were really awesome..Finally their complementary choco brownie with vanilla ice cream added an extra sweetness to our day..Thanks to them!! So , guys if you want to come some romantic yet pocket- friendly restaurent , then do visit here, because you will love this!‚ò∫
Just one suggestion : In zomato it shows table reservation is recommended for people in large groups.. please change it. Just for this mistake we had to adjust preferred seating.

I was very excited to hear about Spice Kraft and its innovative offerings, so this is where I headed to catch up with an old college friend. It's located very conveniently on Hazra Road. While the exteriors aren't as posh as they might have been, the interiors are well done up and create a fairly romantic atmosphere. There aren't too many tables yet, though. 
We decided to start with Manhattans and Bacardi infused tandoori chicken sausages. The Manhattan was nicely made, a little on the strong side, which I liked. The sausages came laid out on a platter with little squeeze tubes of Bacardi lemon sauce stuck into them. My friend and I decided to take the sauce straight onto our tongues and then have the sausages. I'm glad we did - that way we got to taste both the components individually! The sauce had a nice little bite to it and the sausages were well grilled, though a teeny bit bland. The dish came with blueberry coulis on the side, but I felt it was unnecessary, as it was a little too sweet to go well with the dish. Perhaps a more piquant raspberry coulis would have been better. 
We next took a Bellini each and the Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab. The Bellini is a cocktail I was eager to try, as it consists of peach schnapps and sparkling wine. However, I was disappointed to see that the wine was definitely on the flat side, although it tasted nice. A minus there! But the pork ribs were delicious, grilled beautifully with a great sauce to go with it. Finally I took a Chivas Julep, since Chivas Regal is my favourite whisky. It was minty and lemony and tasted good, though it could have done with more whisky - it wasn‚Äôt much different from a mojito. 
Overall, I'll say that Spice Kraft needs to do a little more work on its ambitious menu offerings, if it truly wants to dish up top quality. But it's a great concept and has plenty of potential, so plus points for that!

I wen here with high expectations. But the bhetkis served was pathetic. It was smelly and rotten and not fresh. I told them and they denied. The waiter who took our orders was rude mean and unsophisticated. The ambience was really bad. It is such a small place and even though the decor is good that place is very suffocating. And sick as everything I was discussing in my table was audible to everyone. The waiters were standing nearby and reacting to our conversations. Also there was small kids around us who were crying and creating very weird noice.

Ambience: A small get out restaurant. Lavishly decorated with an Indian theme. Quite closed spaced with wall sized mirrors which I find quite untasteful.

Service: Prompt service and they keep coming to check whether your meal is fine and you need something.

Food: Drinks aren't the quality of the place as is the food. Stick to lighter mocktails if you may. The food and especially the continental menu is what makes this place a recurring visit. Definitely worth a try. 

Price: Very efficiently priced for the wholesome experience and close to average for the general.semi fine dining experiences that you can buy.
Spent 3k on 4 people with entree, drinks and dessert.

I had Spice Kraft in our list from a very long time and I finally went there last month with my husband. It was a delightful experience and we had great-great time. 

We are quite indecisive in ordering food as I am vegetarian and my husband loves Non Veg. We asked the F&B Manager to suggest the best for us. 

We ordered Kele ke phool Kababs, Dajaj Chermoula, Spicy-Tangy Potato, Pain Killer & Terminator. Food & Drinks both were awesomely good. We completely loved it till last bit. The presentation and quantity deserves appreciation. The amiable F&B Manager was taking care of our interest and taste. 

In spite of people queuing outside staff was not hurrying over. 

I completely recommend Spice Kraft for Casual Dining and would love to visit again. 

Thank you

I have been only once to this place. Usually I frequent a place a couple of times before writing a review but then ...... I realized I might not drop by again ........ the experience wasn't one that warrants it ....... the kebabs ordered were good but then I have my places for good Indian kebabs. The drinks that the house almost forced down our throats were decent but then I'd rather enjoy a cocktail at a pub ...... not in a dimly lit family restaurant..... the menu has a wide variety of cuisines represented in it ...... i am not sure if at least two if not one has been mastered. The shepherd's pie I ordered was disappointing ....... completely over done with no crunch to the meat ...... consequently it tasted quite insipid to the pallet. I usually get quite put off by a restaurant, no matter what the hue and cry about it are making the rounds in town, when the BASICS are not in place. Hence may be ...... I will stay away .....despite all the friendly banter and the ratings.

Food is amazing here and I visited after ages and wa happy that they have maintained the quality and taste which is a huge plus. Had the beer can tempura which as the name suggests is actually served in a Budweiser can which was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Fish used was extremely fresh and the tempura batter light. Full marks for that. The shish taouk was also soft and full of flavour. Then we ordered Nasi goreng, chilli garlic noodles and chicken in schiuan sauce. The main course was tasty however not as gud as the starters hence that could be better. Also the variety in Asian in the main course could be enhanced so that we have more options. The service was also very gud

This was part of our recent wishlist and so we wanted to try this place for dinner. We went here last Friday night. We ordered one of their signature dish Dajaj chermoula and it was good. It was more like grilled chicken. Next we ordered Shepherd's pie and nawabi dum ki murg with butter naan. Both were awesome and highly recommended. I have heard they score well in all the cuisines and so I had to order continental since it is my personal favourite. My husband likes Indian and so we ordered nawabi dum ki murg which is a specialty from Lucknow. Of course I had both since I love Lucknow cuisine. The two of us shared the main dishes and the quantity was really good since we had no place for desserts. The curry for nawabi dum ki murg was so good that my daughter had it with naan on her own and this was the first time she relished and tried restaurant food on her own! And in the end we had the shepherd's pie, one bowl each. The taste was heavenly. Lamb meat with mashed potatoes and cheese is the best combination ever for me. So this place scores high on taste of food. The only slight weak part is the service. I know it was late night and time for closing but they took away the leftover curry of nawabi dum ki murg before I could wipe it off and that too without asking! Also we were waiting with sticky hands for quite a while before we had to ask for the fingerbowls.

We almost missed this place as the place seemed a little small. However once inside, we saw that the place has been properly utilized having been separated into three different seating areas. The dim light decor sets the mood for a perfect dine out place on a weekend night. The staffs were very courteous and had a good knowledge to explain the dishes when asked.

In drinks we had LIT which I felt was ok. Next we had the hazelnut heaven as I wanted a sweet cocktail. But this turned out to be sweeter than what I had expected. Not really liked this one. Then we had the pomegranate cointreau which was fairly decent.

Coming to the foods, we started off with bacardi lemon infused tandoori chicken sausage and dajaj chermoula both of them being equally good. The chermoula is a chicken dish which was grilled to perfection and had a distinct smoky flavour. The tandoori chicken was presented with a dropper on each of the pieces filled with a green chutney and it was an absolute eye delight. Next we had the grilled fish which was done perfectly. It was soft and succulent and baked just the right way.

In desert we had the 100% jack daniels. Although I am not fond of mousse, the item was really good. The tanginess of the orange sauce, the sweet-bitter mousse and the sponge cake produced an array of flavour and I enjoyed every bit of it.

A special mention would be: the head chef came and asked if the food was as per expectation and whether it needs to be re-heated or not. I was bowled over with the courtesy. They do give priority to customer satisfaction.

Good food+nice ambience+courteous friendly staffs=definitely a place to go

I have been to this after a lot of r and d. Eventually I will say I am not at all disappointed. Though I got some review about overprice but I wont say that. This is absolutely value for money. 
Dish:- Dajaj chanamoula, Tempura fish with beer batter, terminator and moon fann. 

Tempura fish and dajaj chanamoula is a must try for this particular venue. If you are not a tootler then you should go for terminator. Overall it was a nice experience being there. I will definitely recommend thia venue to other.

After the recommendation of a friend I decided to dine at Spice Kraft for a special occasion.
Since it was a Saturday evening so the restaurant was bustling with people and we had to wait for a while to get us a table. Nonetheless we got a table and all thanks to the amiable manager.
The decor is very neat and pleasant indeed. The lighting was just appropriate and the music in the background made it truly a romantic dinner for us.
Now the food:
Beer Can Tempura Fish - I loved it. The fish was fresh, the outside was crispy and the dip was amazing. This is a must have.
Fried Rice - The rice was cooked fine and was loaded with good amount chicken, mushroom and egg.
Chicken in Chilly Oyster and Mushroom - This wasn't anything extraordinary but it tasted good.
Shepherd's Pie - It was served with bread and had a good layer of cheese on top of the minced lamb. I liked it.
Choco Beam and Hazelnut Heaven were the two cocktails (both taste sweet) we ordered and they were good too.
Dajaj Charmoula, Fish Papillote, Baked Fish Wellington are my favorites from their menu. These are exceptional dishes.

The 4.8 rating on Zomato perfectly justifies the legend of SpiceKraft. Eating here is an absolute delight. Even a non foodie would go gaga over the food available here. 

The service is top class. The head chef who is also the owner takes special care of you, and that is the biggest draw at this restaurant.

Coming to the food and beverages, I ordered an LIIT, which I feel is the best amongst all served in Kolkata. I have had LIIT in Bombay as well, and I can say that this one stands out.

For starters, I ordered Beer Can Tempura Fish. This is their signature dish and it ought not be missed. This is fried to perfection with generous filling of fresh fish. I also ordered Basanti Polao R Murgir Arancini. I am sure you wouldn't have had this gorgeous thing before. Totally different and worth every penny.

For main course I ordered, Devilled Crab Meat. This was pure foodgasm. This was one of the better crab preparations I have had in recent times. If you are a crab lover, do not miss this. 

Also, don't miss their dessert 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut. Again, one of their signature dishes. Not too much sweetness, just how a dessert should be. Also, the pricing is quite reasonable, I felt. 

This place is a must visit, guys! Do not miss this!

Heard a lot about this place. Ambience is amazing as well as the decor. Staff members are extremely friendly and courteous. Service is quick. Located in Ballygunge just a few minutes walk from Chinese Pavilion.
Went for Cucumber Cooler, Smoked Guava Infusions, Garlic Butter Toasts, Ham Steak With Lyonaise Potatoes, Devilled Crab Meat and Kheer Aaron Payesher Sushi.

‚Ä¢ Cucumber Cooler - One of the best mocktails I ever had that's for sure.

‚Ä¢ Smoked Guava Infusions - Simply Amazing.

‚Ä¢ Garlic Butter Toasts - Yummy and melt in the mouth stuff.

‚Ä¢ Ham Steak With Lyonaise Potatoes - I'm not a fan of ham or pork but this one was exquisitely made and perfect in every way.

‚Ä¢ Devilled Crab Meat - This one was my favourite dish. I loved the way it was presented, it was absolutely fresh and of the best quality, this item made my day. People who don't eat crab meat regularly won't understand its worth or its taste, this was just brilliant.

‚Ä¢ Kheer Aaron Payesher Sushi - This was totally different and out of the box but was the best dessert I ever had in a long long time.

Sambit Da ( Head Chef) you totally made my day memorable.

A foodie's paradise if there ever one was, this is by far the best fusion menu I have tasted in Kolkata so far. True to it's positioning of 'Molecular Gastronomy', the fusion menu of Spice Kraft hides delightful tasty surprises behind innovative and novel dishes inspired by culinary styles around the globe. We started with "Basanti pulao aar longa bata murgir arancini" from the continental section and tried "Lymyn Samak- arabic style lemon flavoured grilled fish" and "Dajaj chermoula - chicken marinated with chermoula spices & char grilled" from the Lebanese cuisine. Then we moved on to the signature "Pork ribs burrah kebab, jalapeno & imli chutney drizzle" and "Devilled crab - juicy buttery de boned pure crab meat baked in cream and dijon mustard"- 2 of the best dishes of the night. The juicy texture of pork dipped in the tastiest barbecue sauce I have ever tasted along with the delightful devilled crab with just the right amount of cheese made my day. ¬†We then moved on to the main dishes of "Lobster thermidor - fresh lobster stuffed with juicylobster meat in a cheese & white wine reduction" and "Sorshe smoked kumro patay mora bhetkir paturi" and both were a must try for anyone visiting for the first time. We ended the night on a high with the mousse and the sushi styled kulfi as desserts along with the beer based super cocktail the chef concocted for us.
I would recommend anyone visiting Kolkata to definitely try out the innovative menu designed by Mr. Sambit Banik and also advice them to allow the chef to recommend dishes for them. Their suggestions are truly gastronomically delightful. I would definitely like to go back and satiate my taste buds with new and exciting dishes on offer.

Dinners in kolkata are meant to be sumptous and delicious and this proved to be exactly that. The beer can fish was a bit dissapointment for me as I expected to be a bit different than the fish fingers we normally have but they made it up with the shepherds pie we had. The mutton in the dish was more than soft and beautifully blende with cheese. The tastes of all the ingredients seemed to getting rolled in your mouth. Thanks for the quick arrangement of seats even though it was a saturday evening and it was almost packed. i loved the music but it ended abruptly somehow. Kudos to the service staff. Cheers guys

Passionate about food? Love artwork in the form of food? This place definitely should be in your bucket list.
The moment my exams got over me and one of my friend visited this place, we were eagaly waiting to visit this place for a long time now.

you will enjoy how this suits your mood.
And unlike a place that servers some amazing cocktails and mocktails to choose from, it's a bang on.

We ordered,
For cocktails - smoked guava infusions & the terminator.

For food-
Dajaj Chermoula - A char grilled chicken drumsticks beautifully presented and served with a white dip. The 4 pieces of chicken were served in 4 small cup like containers . The chicken was soft , succulent and tasted mind blowing.

Beer Can Tempura Fish - Beer battered fish served with a delicious dip and tasted great ! one of their most popular items and it rightfully deserves all the praise.

Fish-en-papillote - fish with spices baked in parchment paper and the aroma will hit you hard. The fish was very fresh and lip smacking awesome.

Golda chingri thermi- aah! Chingri (prawn) is something i just cannot resist. Beautiful creamy prawn served with yellow rice (polau) and veggies. The dish is equally tempting and amazing in taste.

For dessert,
100% jack Daniels and Barry callebaut and kheer Aar payesher sushi.

No words just try out this place.
Highly recommended!

Cheers! to team Spice Kraft.

Finally spice Kraft. Made to this place with a friend of mine. A comforting interior, with fine dining arrangements. 
For drinks we had their specials 
‚ö´Liquid bomb
‚ö´Hit man - included gin , tequilla and Orange tincture. 
Both were pretty heady drinks. But presentation was impressive. 
For the starters we took the ‚ö´beer can tempura fish, another speciality of theirs. Crispy batter fried fish, presented out of a beer can, with a tangy dip.
‚ö´Smoked bhekti paturi. Served with yellow rice . Beautiful shorshe flavour. And again presentation killing it üòÅ
Finally I opted for ‚ö´100% Jack Daniels mousse.
Butter sweet chocolate mousse infused with the alchohol, served alongside syrup sipped little sponge cakes and an orange compote. 
Wholesome meal. Enjoyed every bit. 
A must try for everyone who is keen on innovative fusion food.

A few steps away from Ballygunj Phari, this place is a complete package.
The moment you enter this place, Chef Sambit turns his magic wand and leaves no stones unturned to sate you thoroughly.
From his courteous behaviour , explaining all the dishes in detail to managing the kitchen and helping you to choose, he simplifies it all for you.
Very elementary decor yet classy, you get the ample comfort to devour your food. The artistically folded red piece of cloth on a wine glass caught my attention the moment we dropped in.
Food was not an iota less enthralling. Exemplary is the word for it. Chef Sambit has taken molecular gastronomy to another level of excellence. Right from the exquisite presentation to the aroma, infusion of flavours he made a very interesting medley .

My friend and i dropped in today afternoon for lunch.
We had :
1. The painkiller - This tequilla drink served in a square tumbler with a shot glass fit inside tasted amazing. With fresh lime slices and a pinkish cranberry vodka in the shot glass, this surely is a perfect summer drink.
2. Malibu and pineapple juice- my friend sipped on Malibu served on the rocks with fresh pineapple juice. Chef Sambit explained why we shouldnt mix anything with Malibu as it destroys the beautiful coconuty essence of the drink.

FOOD-
1. Basanti Polao and Murgir Arancini - This dish is #recommended. The name and the presentation of the dish is a complete contrast. It is nothing like a regular polao and chicken that we have. Polao mixed with chicken is made into balls and beautifully fried to perfection. A very welcoming suprise to the table.
2. Shepherd's pie- i can loudly claim it's one of the best shepherd's pie served in this city. Succulent and delicious minced meat topped with mashed potatoes and an adequate cheese topping makes it perfect. My friend , a lover of shepherd's pie found this brilliant as well.
3. Kheer aar Payesher sushi : For dessert we had another innovation on plate. Rice kheer with cashew rolled up in Nori sheet with a little stuffing of kheer in the middle is a delight.

I had an amazing experience and would love to visit again and again and try the other dishes as well. No wonder this place has gained so much popularity over just a year.
A special thanks to Chef Sambit.

It was the day of bengali new year (Poila Boisakh) when we (me and my better half) visited Spice Kraft for the first time. We were looking forward to new flavours so we landed up in Spice Kraft. Firstly, We had ordered beverages, Sangria(red wine with fruits) and 100piper's Scotch, accompanied by Baked Fish Wellington (it was a Continental dish with baked bhetki , and mushroom overflowing with cheese) . It acted as an appetizer, tasted like heaven. Then we ordered our main course which consisted of Laal Maas(spicy mutton preparation), and butter nuns. The food was overwhelmingly impressive. We simply loved it. 
The ambience was serene, cozy, very romantic. The Soft music which played in the background had a special effect , such mellifluous flow of romantic fervor. Gracious God!! We were totally flattered. The staffs were extremely polite and helpful.
 This is a perfect place for date ‚ù§
A must visit!üíê

On the day of Poila Boishak me and my girlfriend went to Spice Kraft just to have a different taste of food with a scoop of romantisim. And we are amazed just after entering. The ambience was so good. Soft music, caring staffs came forward to help us choose a table of our own choice. We started it of with Sangria for my beautiful girlfriend and 100pipers scotch for myself. After that came the "Baked Fish Wellingtion" preparation of pure bhetki fish with mushroom, cheese and rice. No doubt to accept that it was awesome in taste as we enjoyed just from the first bite. After we finished with this dish we ordered for Laal Maash (Rajasthani spicy mutton preparation) and butter nun. The butter nun arrived in a replica of a village cart which was quiet unique. The staffs personally came to us confirm that was everything well or not, which actually made us feel special. It was a pretty good exprience. I recommend it to be a must visit place to check out of your own.

Had heard so much about Spice Kraft and all its glory, so chose it for an evening date with friends! Well, it certainly lives up to the hype! Located near Ballygunge Phari, the place is an easy find although visitors who choose to bring along their cars might have a hard time picking a parking spot. The eatery might not make a massive impression from the outside, but as they say, it's the inside that counts, and oh boy, once you step in, you'll be in awe of the decor! Seriously, the wine bottles gracing the glass shelves, the lights adorning the ceiling, the mirrored wall make the interiors superbly classy! Coming to the food, we ordered their infamous Beer Can Tempura Fish. One bite, and I was sold. It's the perfect combo of crispy, underlined with tender juiciness and a very light batter. It's a must try in my opinion! It comes within battered old Budweiser beer cans, and 10 points for the presentation! For drinks, I had the Utterly Butterly Jameson which is essentially Irish Whiskey with a blend of peanut butter+heavy cream. Perfect, I'd say with both bitter and sweet tones. The staff is friendly and eager to recommend dishes! Pricing is absolutely reasonable.
Overall, this new(ish) kid on the block is clearly a winner! 

P.S - The owner and main chef, Sambit Banik is an XLRI alumnus, and hats off to his creativity and innovation!

This place was on my wishlist since ages and I was so excited when I finally got the chance to tick it off. But as they say, too much excitement isn't good. I had read a lot of good things about their Beer Can Tempura Fish and Dajaj Chermoula and hence ordered these.
Dajaj Chermoula- Grilled chicken leg pieces that came in 4 beautiful cups with a sauce. The chicken tasted amazing but the sauce was too sweet, and didn't go with the dish.
Beer Can Tempura Fish- Tasted a lot like Butter Fish Fry. 6 pieces that came inside a beer can. I had HUGE expectations from this dish, but it kinda disappointed me as I ended up not liking it much. And again the sauce for this one too was bad.
Margarita- This drink was heaven. Tequila base with lemon and salt, this drink was pure bliss and was the finest part of the meal.
I also very badly wanted to try their Jack Daniel mousse, but for some reason they didn't have it today.
Coming to the ambience, although this place was smaller than expected, yet was beautifully decorated. The best part was the wall with alcohol bottles.
Service was fine but the only thing that I didn't like is that we had to keep telling the waiters to change our plates after each dish. Also, no welcoming gesture when we entered.
But, what I love about this place is the creativity they add to their dishes, hence justifying their name. Altogether, this place is definitely worth a try.

PLEASE. DON'T. GO. HERE.
This is my first food review inspired by the worst restaurant I've ever had the pleasure to be at. The decor is sleazy with one room completely neon blue where we were being pushed towards sitting but we finally found the family friendly place which was buzzing with people. It was Bengali New Year, hence the menu had been changed to suit the occasion with almost no vegetarian options under the signature section. Their speciality, the molecular mocktails were unavailable. Our waiter was very disinterested in the job, he had no knowledge of the food and bar menu, he had to take constant trips to his "senior waiters" to confirm the availability of the food and drinks. After three attempts, he finally took our order. We were disappointed with the menu. The waiter did not know the difference between an entr√©e and a starter. We were three of us, we decided on the chilly garlic noodles, paneer in shezwan sauce, the devilled crab meat, the lobster thermidor, virgin mojito, doodh cola and a small peg of brandy and warm water. We skipped on the starters due to a lack of a vegetarian one which we all could share. I cannot emphasize enough how limited the options were for a vegetarian. The first entr√®e to arrive the table was the lobster thermidor, even though the crab had been requested first. The waiter said there is nothing he could do about it. Proceeding this, he went on to get all the food and placed it on the table. The entr√®e which was the main course, NOT the starter had the devil crab under it. The crab, however, came with no sides at all, which is disappointing even on the lower standards. Needless to say, the funniest moment that I have ever faced in my history of restaurants is that the plates arrive five minutes after the food reaches the table. The continental food was a pile of molecular shit, there was nothing gastronomic about it. The crab was far too cheesy and creamy and there was no taste of crab. The lobster thermidor had no lobster inside of it but, once again, overtly creamy shrimps. The paneer in shezwan sauce was extremely spicy, even though we specifically asked the waiter to make it as moderately spicy as possible. The noodles were extremely cold and just as good as any street food noodles. The mocktails arrived fifteen minutes after the food was served. The doodh cola was served at room temperature with no ice in it and neither was the virgin mojito any good. After our mains, we were forced to choose from only two desserts from the "Subho Nobo Molecular" menu: Kheer aar payesher sushi and Shaktigarh lengcha trifle pudding, plastic chutney gelee. We chose the lengcha as the first one was made to sound unappetizing by the waiter. Let me repeat myself again, PILE OF MOLECULAR SHIT. We returned it after taking just one bite. It had a distinct taste of lengcha dipped in cough syrup mixed with sugar cane juice. PLEASE do yourself a favour, we have suffered on your behalf so that you do not have to. I leave a 1 star rating as negatives are not available.

P.S. For all those who have left 5 star ratings, rest in peace to your flavour pallette.

Since I have seen d rating 4.8 in zomato I had a strong urge to visit dis place..finally managed.8 of us visited this well decored restaurant located near Hazra law college to celebrate a special occasion. The restaurant was packed up at around 7.30.So guys try to turn up early if u want to give some time for some unique fusion food.
They were having some unique new dishes for Poila Baisakh and we tried few of them..specially the kuler achar macher devil..unique and tasty. In starters we also ordered there two signature dishes..beer can tempura fish and Dajaj Charmoula.Both dis dishes were awesome..tender chicken legs well marinated and cooked and d fish were tender juicy batter fried.The trp was there way of presentation..full marks.Tangarita and virgin mojito..two refreshing mocktails we ordered.Tangarita was based on orange juice wid some tangy spicy taste and it was refreshing too.
In Main course we ordered Coq Au Vin- soft boneless chicken and mushroom cooked in mushroom sauce served wid butter rice.very nice to taste. There was Sous Vide Mangsher jhol bhaja narkel..a fusion bengali cuisine..mainly mutton preparation served wid basanti polao.Also we had chicken in chilly oyster sauce Moon Faan..a special type of fried rice etc..
The food were unique and tasty and service was good and prompt.The chef had interaction wid d customers and suggestion and feedback were given importance.

Spice Kraft : Witch Craft

Yesterday was Bengali New Year‚Äôs Day and also my son‚Äôs birthday. So when I offered to take him out for dinner he opted for Spice Kraft , a highly rated Casual Dining and Bar at Hazra , though flaunted as Ballygunge to get the up market positioning flavour. It is actually at 54/1/2A, Hazra Road, Near Hazra Law College, Kolkata .

It is rated by Zomato at 4.8/5. An outstanding rating taking into consideration that Taj Restaurant is 3.6/5. Zomato is an easy-to-use restaurant finder app that lets you explore all the dining options in your city. It flashes user reviews to help you decide where you want to eat, and use the map feature to guide you there.

It brags of Molecular Gastronomy in Continental, Middle Eastern and Asian Cuisine . Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking.

What a Brag ! We had ordered Crab meat in creamy sauce, Lobster Thermidore and Chilli Garlic Noodles Paneer with Sichuan sauce The food was substandard to say the least. The Lobster Thermidore had no Lobster but the shell of a lobster filled with crushed shrimps with cheese. The Crab is ditto scraped small baby crabs known as Zoea crushed with potatoes and cheese and placed in a crab shell. I have a feeling that both the Lobster and the Crab Shell are recycled and severed over and over again to substitute for the real. The Chilli Garlic Noodles Paneer, a simple fare but nothing to writes about.

Even the drink ordered was a letdown. I had a bad cold and throat and ordered a Hennessey Brandy with warm water but ordinary Honey Brandy was passed off as VSOP.

Even the waiter Somnath Chakraborty, in the collage was damp squib. Had no idea what the restaurant offered. Order of serving., the drink came after the food. Totally disinterested and said he will be quitting the job this week.

What a letdown ! But when we came out at 10pm there was a crowd waiting. All being taken for a ride by the Zomato Rating.

Is Zomato rigged ?? With F& B growing in Kolkata we should boycott these places.

Without Rating you are NOT publishing Review so I am Marking 1 otherwise it is 0

Located near Ballygunge..a place where innovation meets good food. Place is quite spacious and interiors looks good, have separated dining partitions. Has enormous choices of cocktails but we ordered the Normal draught beer and to go with it Beer can tempura fish, it's a wonderful dish and loved the innovation to garnish it with beer cans. We had pork ribs burrah kebab which was mouth watering. Guys give it a try u will surely savour it. For the mains we had moon fan rice and roast pork in rendang curry. We as well tried the pan fried Cantonese noodles. Overall the food is awesome. We even had the head chef advising us with the dishes. It was a nice gesture. Overall a good experience.

Great food served in an impeccable atmosphere of soft music and tended to by the staff who genuinely wants you to eat more. The menu has been carefully constructed whether it is the Machher Devil coexisting with Smirnoff Green Apple and Kuler achar or a Golda Chingri Thermidor. 

Do not hesitate to ask the Chef himself or anyone from the staff for their inputs and suggestions. 

Every bite is an orchestra in your mouth at one of the finest restaurants to exist in Kolkata currently.

I went there for lunch. To settle down, we took hazelnut heaven(smirnoff variant )and it was appeasing-just the drink to start with. Then we ordered beer can tempura fish, dajaj charmoula and lymwn samak. All of these tastes great but the beer can tempura fish and lymwn samak are the recommended ones. Then for main course we ordered coq-au-vin , shepherd's pie, noodles and devilled crab meat along with blue electric and mango driver cocktails. This combination worked great for us, especially the cocktails. For dessert we ordered classic monte carlo and kheer ar payesher sushi. Recommended is the monte carlo dessert. 
Service was excellent and the staff there were always helpful in choosing dishes.
Ambience was soft and soothing.

Well well Spice kraft has been such a sought-after Restaurant off late.And my word it lives up to its fame.Went to visit one Sunday evening with friends.Chef Sambit who happens to be the owner of the restaurant is such an awesome host.Happened to know a friend of mine but he was equally hospitable to each and every one out there.

Coming to the food.I would like to keep it short by saying it's by far one of the best tasting starters I've had.Each of the plates were a work of art.Special care was taken to prepare and decorate the dishes.
 
Even the ambience was nice ,neatly done and with lighting which made most of the people visiting click pictures.
SPECIAL MENTION : Their Virgin Mojito has become my favourite along with most of their starters.
Should be on the must visit list üòÅ Kudos

This has certainly become one of my favourite restaurants! 
The decor is very modern and clean, with perfect amount of lighting. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Dajaj Chermoula. Its sous vide chicken, which is finished off in the pan to give it some colour. Due to the cooking technique, the chicken remains very juicy and succulent and packed full of flavour. It just melts in the mouth. It has a very refreshing yoghurt dip to go with it. 
Next we ordered Beer Can Tempura fish which came along with an Orange Ponzu Tartar√© dip. I'm a big fan of tempura, and this was heavenly! The batter was light and crispy and the fish moist and perfectly cooked. The dip was the perfect accompaniment! 
Next we ordered the Shepherd's Pie. It had the right amount of meat to potato ratio. I have had a bad experience with Shepherd's Pie before in a restaurant, but this was a winner! 
For dessert, we ordered the 100% Jack Daniel's & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mouss√®, Drunken Pet√Æt Fours. The mousse, set in liquid nitrogen, had a big hit of alcohol if eaten alone. But it came along with a soaked sponge kinda thing, and all together it was perfect! 
All the dishes were presented beautifully in an innovative manner.
Also, we ordered LIIT and Cosmopolitan for drinks. Both were faultless. 
All in all it left us wanting more and I look forward to going to this place again and try out other dishes! 
P.S. The dips have stolen my heart! 

A special mention to the staff for describing us the dishes in details. It really increased our knowledge and we knew what we were eating and what processes every dish had gone through. They are very well behaved and know what they are serving (which very few places have)! 
Cheers!

Went to spice craft and all I can say is if you go there u won't be sorry. Excellent food, no matter what you order. Had the drums of heaven and I was in heaven. Crispy outer coating with juicy chicken pieces. After that had B-B-Q pork and that was just as tasty. For drinks try the cocktails, LIIT and dacquiri were amazing.No matter what you order u wont be let down. 
A big thank you to Vikashda, our waiter. He helped us select the food and drinks and was very nice and helpful. Overall excellent food, ambience and staff treatment.

I heard about this place about for quite a long time. Finally today git the opportunity to try it out. I went there with my family. 
Ambience-Nice decor. Not very spacious though but cosy. There was cute little trucks as spice trays on the tables which I liked.
Service - The staffs were very courteous , prompt and helpful with the suggestions. They served food on an average within reasonable time . The food was hot , enough in amount.
Food -We ordered Blue Frappe and Tangarita as mocktails. Both were nice ,but my personal favourite is Tangarita which was both sweet and spicy with nice refreshing flavour of orange and green chilli.
In the main course we had Pasta Aglio Oglio (chicken) and Baked Fish Wellington. Pasta was simply awesome. It was mild in flavour, not very spicy. The fish was also good, nicely cooked that is tender inside and crispy outside. Next we had Masala Kulcha with Nawabi Dum ki Murg. Kulcha was soft with tasty filling. Chicken gravy was very tasty , a bit @spicy though. Last in the desserts we had Classic Monte Carlo and Orange Glazed ,  toffee tossed Darsan with Ice cream . Both were very tasty. Darsan was nice , crispy , awesomely flavoured. 
But I am really sorry as I couldn't upload any pictures. We were way too hungry to click pictures. üòõ

Have visited this place quite a few times...  I have to say that with time,  the quality of food is losing out. Nevertheless,  beer can tempura fish,  dajaj chermoula, soy braised drums of heaven, tandoori pomfret and deviled crab are the ones to be tried out.  Reasonable cost and that's where it makes up for the quality drop ( but i feel that's not enough)..  My rating is on an optimistic note such that the taste makes a comeback very soon.

*Revised review 03.01.2018*

We visited Spicekraft 8 months back. Had the opportunity to taste a few dishes due to time and appetite constraints. Since last 2 months we failed in getting booking 4times. After much procrastination finally we got a booking for 31st lunch. 
As I was highly impressed first time, I invited a gang of 5 friends this time, thoroughly advocating for Spicekraft‚Äôs food!

We reached in front of Spicekraft at dot 12 o‚Äôclock, when some was still on going inside, so we were asked to enter few minutes later. After around 10mins we were taken and and allotted a table.

Ambience: Nothing great. Dimly lit. Even feels cramped when houseful .
The area is quite small.

Food: Primary area of interest.
As we were 5, we had the opportunity of tasting a good number of dishes.
We will talk on all of them sequentially.

Beverages were served first 
# Tangarita: From my previous experience I chose this for 4 of us. Though I like it with the hint of hotness in it, my mates did not like it much. They got taste of Fanta in it!

#Cucumber cooler: This one was very good. Refreshing, tangy and soothing.

#Dajaj chermoula :  Chicken(Dajaj) legs marinated in spices and grilled. Though the chicken was soft and succulent, it did not hit the right chords on taste buds. We have had far better versions of chicken legs from many other places in the city.

#Beer can tempura fish with orange ponzu tartare : Had high expectation due to previous experience. We were crestfallen. The coating missed the crunch. The size has become considerably smaller. The ponzu sauce was not great either.
Presentation no doubt is very good.

#Dry chilli pork: presentation is good. Tastes good. I am not a pork fan. But liked the taste here. The saucy bell peppers and onions were done nicely.

#Shepherd‚Äôs pie : 2 bowls old British classic pie served with a bowl of buttery garlic breads.
The minced lamb under a bed of cheesy mashed potatoes tastes heavenly.

#Lymwn samak: Arabic style fish tikka with lemon marination ,topped with mustard sauce. Lipsmacking good . Was finished in seconds from our table. Presented on ceramic pan. The dish had perfect balance of all the taste. Highly recommended. This dish was suggested by restaurant staffs. 
We loved it.

#Devilled crab meat: presentation may not be very impressive. 2 crusts of crab filled with crabmeat cooked with loads of creamy cheese and dijon mustard. 
One who loves less spicy food and cheese will surely fall in love with the crabs.

#Coq-au-vin : This is an old French dish. Roasted chicken in red wine juice with mushrooms and shallots. Parsley buttery rice was served cold. It was a disappointment. Presentation not appealing at all!
When rice is a side of any dish, it‚Äôs very important to serve hot. We did not enjoy the dish.

#Baked fish Wellington: again the presentation was a disappointment. Pilaf Served was cold. 2 baked bhetki fillets topped with a thick layer of cheese somehow managed to prevent the dish being a total flop.

It was New Year‚Äôs eve, apart from the special menu card‚Äôs pudding no desserts were available.
We felt,the huge crowd and hype of place has degraded the service and quality of the food at spicekraft.
Food serving time is high.
There is always a queue outside the place.

Inspite of all the hype, fame, popularity of the place and its dishes, we suggest the management should work little harder for sustaining all its good name. After so much of stories about good food and so much of waiting in long queues none wants cold food or soft crusted beer batter fries!!



**************************************** Spice kraft was on my wish list for longtime, as I stay out of kolkata now. Atlast with lot of excitement and hunger we arrived at spice kraft last week.
Location: few minutes from Ballygunge petrol pump towards Hazra. Though we reached at 8pm, we had to wait for around 30mins for a table (it was a saturday night, and I am not sure about other days). To be frank from outside the restaurant doesn't appeal much. I guess the popularity of the place is due to its fan following and their great reviews about the place!
Service and food: The dimly lit interior is tastefully done. Due to lack of tables and long queue 2 of us had to share a 6person's table with another couple(could have been managed better, though I don't mind for this as I was with a friend and not my better half ;) )
I ordered a tangerita which had orange juice and slitted green chillies, the combination seemed so perfect. Next came the beer battered fish, it was awesome. The fish was fresh, soft and succulent inside and crispy outside. 
Next came the shepherd's pie. The tender pieces of lamb with buttery mashed potatoes were nothing less than divine. Love the garlic breads even.
Quantities are very good. 
Special credit should be given for the presentation of the items. I loved the truck on the table too.
I shall back soon for more.
Price: very much reasonable for the quality and quantity they serve.

To the team behind this wonderful place:
Keep serving the good food.
(Foodies like us who stay away from the city keep on coming back every now on then just to satiate our buds with your wonders!)

A gem in the food scene of Kolkata. The head chef welcomes you and suggests according to your pallette. The cocktails were good, but I go back again and again for the food. Beer battered fish is the best fried fish I've had. The chicken with Bacardi mint infusion is pure genius! Everything on the menu is worth your money. Cheers to Spicekraft!

This place is delicious food heaven. I love this place to bits.  The cook is a verya talented person.  Comes personally to your table to understand your preferences.  The food is amazing as i have already mentioned. 
We had
Beer canned tempura fish -which is crispy outside and soft and supple inside
Devilled crab meat- i think they make it the best even better than mocambo.  Its a must try for all crab lovers. 
Sheperds pie-that is also amazingly made.

Last thursday after office one of my friends and I decided to drop into this place for some snacks. The ambiance of this resaturant is very classic. Coming to food we had some beer with one of their signature dishes dajaj chermoula. Service was good. Food was excellent.

Spice kraft is located at the most prime location in south Kolkata. If you are coming from gariahat towards ballygunje phari, just turn left from the ballygunje phari petrol pump towards Hazra road & the restaurant will be few blocks across on your left on the main road itself. I checked it out on zomato before visiting here, and I must say now I have tagged it for future visits as well. The ambience is top notch! The courtesy of the waiters are also worth mentioning, since you wont get it everywhere nowadays. We ordered their well known "fish in a beer can" starter and some other arabic preparation of chicken (i cant recall the name). For drinks we ordered some cocktails and finally the long island iced tea. I would say its a must try (will surely give you a kick!). The dessert was a disappointment though, we could not finish off our ice cream. It was lame! But we realized we could have ordered some other variety of dessert. Waiters are very well behaved and will be happy to recommend you about the food & drinks that you can choose as per your need. The pocket pinch is also not much and quite reasonable. Overall it was a very good experience for us. If you are in gariahat area and looking for some joint to hangout while grabbing a few drinks, this is your place.

Not great for vegetarians 
Very oily food , and starters with same gravy
Main course is average ...............
We really decided on the place looking at a very high Zomato rating which was misleading

This place was on my wishlist for a long time. Finally had a chance to visit on my friend's birthday. The ambience and the decor was up to the mark but my we couldn't get a table of our choice as most of the tables were reserved maybe. Starting with the drinks we had spicy pomegranate and guava mary. In the starters we had the dishes we heard most about- dajaj chermoula - This is a dish originating from lebanon. Juicy chicken wings with a sweet dip. 
Beer can tempura fish- this was fish fried in a batter and was so smooth yet crispy. 
As we were quite full already we ordered only a pan fried noodles in the main course. 
Meanwhile I had asked the staff to arrange something for my friend's bday so they arranged an icecream with candle lit on it. This was very nice. The only thing is that they served us this before the main course, which was quite a bummer. Nonetheless, the overall experience was pretty good. I loved the pan fried noodles and the beer can tempura fish the most.

The moment we entered to this resturant we're warmly welcomed....the menu book was very interesting with various cuisine with some twists...the prompt service, interesting way of serving rather i should say the art of presentation of each dish has a personal touch & it perfectly goes with the name & logo! The visual pleasure with some fine tastes are enough to boost your mood with fusion booze. It's very much appreciable that Chef Mr. Sambit himself was visiting to each & everyone present there & sharing thoughts. Overall it was a pleasant experience indeed & highly recommend to Foodies.

After searching for a suitable place to eat...going by the exceptionally high reviews ..Spice Kraft seemed to be the best place to spend a quite friday afternoon..to have a satisfying meal..

From the high reviews given to this place..i didnt quite imagine that i would be left with such a bad experience from this eatery place..

Coming to the menu to start with(drinks)..we ordered a kool cucumber absolute and black dog gold..

For the starters..going with the recommendation..we ordered Beer Can Tempura Fish..which tasted like the normal chilli pakoras sold at the road side stalls..wasnt that great..this was followed by main course..in which we ordered..Coq Au Vin..and spaghetti pasta aglio olio..the 1st one was bland..literally bland the spaghetti didnt have any hint of taste..the veggies were unsalted..both the dishes ruined our moods..

Coming to the dessert ..expecting again that atleast it would be our saviour..we ordered..100% Jack Daniels Mousse..Orange flavoured sauce was the worst thing ive ever tasted in a dessert item..the ice cream which was supposedly given turned out to be chocolate cream..

Disappointing..it was utterly disappointing..didnt turn out like a 4.8 star restaurant..lunch was spoilt..we got the exact opposite of what we expected..

I wouldn't recomment this place to others.

Loved the food. It's really tasty and the drinks are amazing too.
Only the place is really small and always crowded. 
Being a vegetarian we had apprehensions as all the reviews primarily focussed on non veg cuisine, but to our pleasant surprise they were well equipped with a selection of veg dishes albeit it being small.

It is located in hazra road near the law college.. not very difficult to locate and if u can't locate why is Google map there for!! I visited the place with my soulmate ;-) she had recommended it... We ordered in kicktails tangarita and blue frappe both were good enough.. i must say the place has a good option of mocktails and drinks felt interesting... In d main course we had moon faan and mandarin fish with chicken both were good to have... And yes the quantity was sufficient for two... Then d dessert something new yes i felt the dish new and signature dish .. it was jack Daniel mousse it was tasty.. loved it.. i would like to visit this place again to try more of their dishes and offcourse the mocktails.. my taste buds are still craving for their food..

Had been planning to visit this joint for quite some time, what with its 4.8 rating and rave reviews from so many. So we rolled along on a Friday evening to check it out. They have some house favourite dishes which are instant hits- the dajaj chermoula, a lebanese dish of roasted chicken wings served with cucumber and a light curd; the beer batter tempura fish is a crispy delight, where the fish actually melts leaving a crunch of the beer coating; roast pork in Rendang curry has diced cubes of pork with the perfect amount of fat and a gravy which would make you want to slurp it directly from the bowl; this curry we had with a Moon Fan rice, fragrant rice with generous quantities of chicken and mushroom.
 The place is famous for its molecular infusions, so we ordered a beer cocktail-not in the menu- 'The Terminator', a lovely infusion of Heineken and La Chica gold tequila; another round of a Pomegranate+Cointreau+Vodka+Tonic water infused drink which was spicy and had a kick to it. Only item which didn't leave us impressed was a deconstructed papri chaat ordered from the Molecular mocktails menu, just 2 spoons full, it was a tad disappointing- but it maybe be that the Bangali appetite is  not yet  ready for deconstructed molecular gastronomy. 
Barring the papri chaat, every other item has generous helpings and is a real value for money and super recommended.

Sweet taste will definitely soothes your taste buds .. :),

Excellent place & excellent food. Our selections were also bang on as I was accompanied by my close friend Master Chef Sunayan Pramanik of ITC Sonar. The presentations were mind boggling & so is the choice of cocktails. What names.... For example I took one Milk Maid Chaitini which is a Vodka based cocktail mixed with tea & milkmaid. We also took LIT, Breezer Blaster, Mango Driver (the classic Screwdriver cocktail replaced with Mango juice instead of Orange juice). As starters we chose Beer Can Tempura Fish, Bacardi Limon infused Tandoori Chicken Sausage (awesome presentation & taste), Green Chilly Chicken, Red Pepper Prawns. For main course, we opted for Egg Fried Rice, Khabsa Rice Chicken (don't know the origin), Grilled Fish with lemon butter sauce, Chicken in Chilly Oyster & Mushroom & Kombdi Cha Tambada Rassa (a Maharashtrian Chicken gravy dish).
Left the place with an awesome experience. This place was on my wish list for a long time & I was really satisfied. Will come back more surely.

Unique preparations of food and cocktails at affordable prices.

Located near hazra law college, this unique eatery offers tasty combination of food and cocktails. The space inside is not much so it always remains crowded, table booking is advisable. Staff are polite and efficient, the owner who is also the head chef personally comes to the customers for feedback.

 Their x factor is the unique way of food preparation. One must try their beer fried tempura fish, barcadi infused chicken sausage, hazelnut heaven and the molecular cocktails. Everything tastes really good, cocktails are moderately priced. Chinese maincourse are really good. Keep up the good work!

I visited Spice Kraft yesterday evening with my family and relations. We were pleasantly surprised when we found that our table was kept ready along with a baby chair for our little grandson. Service as well as the food and the couple of mocktails that we ordered were really satisfying. We tried continental cuisine and ordered four separate entrees. 

Plan to revisit and explore their culinary expertise further....

"Heaven on earth" from a foodie point of view. Theres a lot to write about dis place. I have been here twice and both the times i was left mesmerised. First of all the place is located just opposite to ballygunge law college and is pretty easy to find. Their ambience is soothing,the liquor collection in display adds a charm.
Now the food. I could write an essay on this. I have had their chivas julep which was recommended by the stuart and it was so refreshing and i have had sangria which was a lovely smooth blend. In entrees i have had dajaj charmoula which had a smoky flavour i had never experienced before and i tried a kebab which i dont remember. In main course i have had coq-au-vin,i liked it verry much,the soft tender chicken n butter rice combinatn is awesome. Baked fish wellington was not that good though the fish was soft n well cooked. And shepherd's pie,this dish blew my mind off,it was the best of all and i can have it every time i go there. In deserts i had jack daniel's mouse,this is a desert i can bet u will neva find anywhere in calcutta.
Chef Sambit has nicely worked this place up and what is interesting is that sometimes he himself comes and asks you about how your food was. This place is just perfect there isn't a single flaw i could find. I have recommended this place to about 50 people and will continue doing so.

SpiceKraft has since long been in my go-to list. The countless praises from friends who went there along with the consistently high ratings it has been receiving compelled me to visit this beauty one afternoon!
Situated just before Ballygunge Phari, the external look of this place doesn't give away what lies beyond the doors!! I was instantly greeted with soothing instrumental music which they keep playing at all times. The interior is serene and pleasant. It has an embalming effect almost instantly. The staff is very polite and cooperative. The tables are adorned with innovative truck-shaped cruets with actual wheels. The bar shelves are clearly visible from the dining space, and they add to the overall impressive atmosphere.
Being a group of four friends, we ordered a variety of dishes and drinks. We started with cucumber coolers and Virgin Mojitos for mocktails. The cucumber cooler deserves an applause. It's a perfectly mixed drink with an absolutely amazing taste to it !
We then moved on to dishes and ordered a Beer Can Tempura Fish, Dajaj Charmoula and Fish-En-Papillote. Among these, my personal favourite was the Dajaj Charmoula. Perfectly grilled chicken pieces served in small pots with an equally amazing dip to accompany them. The fish-en-papillote came close! Oh-so-tender fish pieces wrapped in paper and baked at the right temperature to treat your palate royally! We fell love with these dishes.
The tempura fish was also excellent, both in presentation and taste. We ended the perfect meal with Fried Ice Cream for dessert. Again, it was more than satisfying. I must say, this place truly deserves a 5, and with this quality of service and food for the price they charge, Spicekraft will surely dominate the food lovers' hearts and minds for a long, ling time!
Counting the days until I get to go back to this place to try more dishes!!!!

This molecular gastro-pub will leave you spell-bound with its wide variety of cocktails, liits and innovative dishes. The liit called Hammerjack will definitely grab your attention. Liquid Bomb, Pain Killer and Red Grape and Basil Twister are the catch. Among the appetizers, Beer can tempura fish, pork ribs cooked with rum, Dajaj Charmoule, Firecrackers, Fish-en- papillote, Prawn in Fragrant Coriander Sauce are lip smacking. I love desserts and had to order Jack Daniel's Mousse which looks like a pretty mousse cake. I have visited this place only once and wish to revisit it again and again till I get to eat all the dishes they have in the menu. The presentation gets an A+. The service and price is also good. The ambience is nice with its calm and cozy environment.

A visit to this restaurant had been overdue for quite some time now. However today, I decided to go there for lunch. The place is very conveniently located which is always a plus! Upon entering, the interiors quite impressed me. It had a very comfy and soothing atmosphere, which makes it perfect for all sorts of gatherings including couple dates. The restaurant has two parts, you can either choose to  a sit inside or outside. But sadly for us, the inside was already full. The food on their menu was quite interesting as well.

We started of by ordering two drinks which were Cucumber Cooler ( a non-alcoholic drink ) and Pain Killer ( an alcoholic drink ). The first drink was amazing. It was refreshing with a hint of spice in it. A MUST try. The second drink was a blend of cranberry juice, vodka and a little bit of tequila. It was quite strong, with a tangy flavour which i really liked. Will definitely try out more from their cocktail menu the next time.

Coming to the food, we ordered the famous Daraj Charmoula which was char grilled succulent chicken leg pieces cooked to perfection and served with a sweet dip. Next was the Firecracker, which was an oriental dish comprising of tiny and crisp golden fried chicken pieces that came with a sweet and sour dip. Another thumbs up! Then came the Lymwn Samak, fish cooked in lemon sauce. The pieces were so soft that they melted in my mouth right away. The mint dip provided with it was unlike any other dip I have had so far. Loved it. Of course, we HAD to try the Beer Can Tempura Fish which came with an orangy dip. Though I know it is one of their signature dishes, I on the other hand did not quite like it that much. But my friends definitely did. Last but absolutely not the least, the dish that blew out mind away was the Fish-En-Papillote which was basically a French version of the famous patudi that all bengalis must be well-aquainted with. If you are a fish lover, guys you HAVE to try this out. And for those of you, who are not fan of fishes, you will change your mind. 

We called it a day by ordering the Jack Daniel's and Barry Callebaut dessert. Two mousses made of coffee and chocolate with liqour along with pineapple flavoured spongy cakes. If you are one of those who loves dark chocolate, this should be a must try. I personally loved it to bits. 

The staff as well as the chef was very interactive and polite. Definitely looking forward to trying out their main-courses next time.

Went here for a Sunday lunch with friends. We tried their continental fare and I don't find much to write home about. The service is good and the waiters are polite and helpful. The restaurant has three parts: the bar, the family area and the non family area. We were seated in the non family area and found it a little cramped. Thankfully there's car parking available outside though limited. The food presentation is nice. But I am unable to recommend any one single item on the menu car which calls for special mention since I found the whole menu quite "been there done that" types. Pricing is not exactly pocket friendly and I would expect better ambience for the dent it caused to my wallet. For 5 guys it cost 3300/- with no alcohol. Try it if you have exhausted yourself of all other options.

Very very conveniently located, just 2 minutes walk from Ballygunge Phari, you will get the restaurant to your left.

The place is divided into 2 sections. We chose to sit in the interior section. The 1st thing that impressed us was the stylish menu cards!

Ambiance/ Decor - A classy touch is there. Walls are decorated really well and the lighting is perfect. Seating arrangements are comfortable.

Food - I have been to Spice Kraft a number of times and I am naming few of the "Must Order" items.

Dajaj Chermoula - A char grilled chicken preparation beautifully presented and served with a white sauce. The 4 pieces of chicken were served in 4 small cup like containers. The chicken was soft, succulent and tasted mind blowing.

Beer Can Tempura Fish - One of their most popular items and it rightfully deserves all the praise. It was served with a delicious dip and tasted great!

Cucumber Cooler - One of the best mocktails I've ever had! This one is a must try! All of us loved this wonderfully refreshing drink.

Moon Faan - Tastes great with Chicken in Chilly Oyster. A good combination!

Prawn in Fragrant Coriander Sauce - Don't be apprehensive because of the coriander part. The flavor is not dominant and the prawns are deliciously crispy and juicy.

Service - Unbeatable. The staff and the Chef too! Before ordering, he guided us with the dishes by explaining in detail about the food, thus giving us an idea of what to expect from each of the items.

Very courteous too. You wouldn't get a single thing to complain about!

Portion - Good enough for 2.

Price - Reasonable.

Absolutely Recommended!

Delicious is the word that pops up in my mind the moment I think about the food here! The restaurant itself isn't that spacious but the quality of food and service more than makes us for that.
I tried spaghetti aglio oglio non-veg, shepherd's pie, fish fillet, chicken stroganoff and popcorn chicken. Each item tasted fantastic. I found my cocktail,Hazelnut heaven,to be more of a dessert drink and totally loved it. And yes,100% Jack Daniel's mousse is a must-have at this place!
I will be back for trying out some more of their innovative food ideas very very soon.

So this place serves some amazing drinks and finger food. The main course and dessert are an added bonus. Ordered a cucumber cooler mocktail and a guava mary absolut. Both the drinks are really well prepared. Loved the tangy after taste. The tempura fish in beer batter is a must order item here and you must try it.
The moon fan rice was really well prepared and complimented the hunan fish.
The monte carlo was just made perfectly.

We, old school friends had a reunion here yesterday... and GRAND it was!!!

Among the several laughters and memories, there was FOOD startling and surprising ¬†us one after another!!

We started off with Beer Can Tempura Fish and Coq Au Vin... the Fish was not something very unique but the way it was presented, it was totally mesmerising!!
Coq Au Vin was a pretty good a bowl meal, it was my personal favourite of the day!!

Next came Lobster Thermidor... Honestly I dont fancy seafood mcuh but this one was certainly upto the mark... Succulent Lobster meat with a chunk of frangranced rice!!!!!

Lastly we tried a weird combo of Moon Faan Rice and Dajaj Chermoula... the rice had an uncanny frangrance to it which I really loved... And the other one was truly the best garnished dish, chicken legs in teracotta cups with that sweet sour raita..... Perfect!!!!!!!

We were sad finally as we couldn't end with a recommended dessert the Jack Daniels Mousse... Hope we would find it in our next visit!

Looking for a molecular gastronomy restaurant or molecular mixology bar??? Well Spice Kraft is there to offer you the best.
If you still haven‚Äôt enjoyed this delicate treat‚Ä¶you simply cannot miss the stunning molecular cuisine that truly satisfies the palate of the most beautifully decorated restaurant in South Kolkata.

Coming to the Food & Drinks
We had signature cocktails and finger licking food
- Cucumber Cooler (The name Says it all)

- Liquid Bomb (Quite an Interesting drink, a must try)

- Painkiller (Worked even better when ur suffering from migraine :) )

- The Terminator (Beware Arnold, got u r perfect competitor)

- Prawn in Coriander Sauce  (Tendered Tiger Prawn literally gave me goosebumps)

- Beer Can Tempura Fish (I am in love with this dish as it comes inside a Budweiser can. Perfect in every manner)

- Dajaj Chermoula (Too difficult a name to spell and write but its easy when the chicken leg melts inside your mouth, soft and very well marinated item)

- Chilly Wine Fish (Something you just can't miss, i didn't coz it had Wine tagged with its name :) )

- Hunan Fish This¬†Hunan¬†(Steamed¬†Fish, or ‚ÄúDuo Jiao Yu‚Äù in Chinese, very common dish but chef Sambit's team made it special)

- Chicken in Chilly Oyster Fish (My personal favourite)

- Moon Fan (Forget what the name says....just grab it, rice cooked with perfection)

- Classic Monte Carlo (Not too much of a sweet tooth person but i had it and loved it)

- Fried Ice - Cream ( This deserves a special ovation, fried shell made out of coconut with hand made ice -cream inside the shell plated with caramel & jaggery)

Overall Experience
Food - 5/5
Ambiance - 5/5
Service - 5/5

Good job Chef! You brought soul to the recipe

Spice Kraft is known for its diverse array of dishes   coming from various cuisines. The place has been quite talked about and praised since opening a couple of years back. It has a very flamboyant yet classy ambience. The soothing music plays its part in giving you a more fine dining feel. The ambience apart, the star of any restaurant should be its food and that is where Spice Kraft excels.

There are very few places in the city which serve such varied flavours.During my visit, I had -

Appetisers and drink -

Cucumber cool - This is the showstopper .It is tangy with a light cucumber essence. I loved it !

Prawn in Coriander sauce - The coriander sauce does not overpower the natural flavour of the prawn . Quite flavourful !

Beer Can Tempura Fish - This dish won me over at my first bite. The fish is crispy and has a thin batter. The taste is absolutely exquisite. The plating is eye catching as well with the fish strips pouring out of a budweiser beer can. Kudos!

Dajaj Chermoula - This is char grilled Chicken leg pieces nicely marinated in chermoula pices. The chicken was easily falling off the bone and it was delicious as well. 

The main course -

Chilli wine chicken - Soft succulent chicken pieces in a very palatable gravy.It went very well with the fragrant Moon Fan Rice. 

Hunan fish - A slightly sweet first impression and spicy aftertaste. Loved the diversity of flavour in the dish.

The desserts -

Monte Carlo - An old classic. Everybody loves the Monte Carlo ! It was very well presented here . Its true that plating of a dish contributes to the overall experience of it. Spicekraft has understood this very well. In two words ,it was 'truly yum'.

Fried Icecream - This dessert is an ode to the medley of flavours  'Spice Kraft' can rustle up. It consists of fried shell made out of coconut . This has handmade icecream in it. The coconut shell lies in a pool of a delectable sauce which has an amalgamation of two main ingredients -jaggery and caramel . 

Overall , the service was also very prompt. The dishes were aptly described to us by Chef Sambit who had intricate knowledge of each and every offering they served. This also contributed to the lovely experience here. I would definitely visit Spice Kraft again and hope that they can maintain the standards already set by them.

Please have the sauces improved with starters.  It tasted too sweet. 
If possible,  please have the approx time written in zomato as visitors may have other concerns.

Great place to be on a date with your loved one. Slightly expensive however the food was great. Beer can Tempura Fish tasted amazing. Chivas Julep is just mojito with good old whiskey in it (so don't expect much). The smoked guava drink was also great. Loved the ambience.

It has been about one year since its inception and Spice Kraft has silently gathered a reflective reputation in the field of molecular gastronomy. If you thought food is just about ingredients and the right temperatures, this place is gonna change your perception. Chef Sambit has applied the scientific procedures of molecular gastronomy to curate a delightful menu which is going to blow you away.

For the ambience, Profound and Sophisticated are the words here. When I entered this place, the first thing I saw that my table was eloquently made up with a set of three glasses shimmered in the lighting, with the cloth stylishly curved inside them, which was most apt for the occasion.

Flawless is the word that would suit the best for the service. After an hour or so into my dinner session I realized that I was enjoying the service a rather too easily. To my astound they were exemplary. They made sure everyone got the requisite attention. Chef Sambit was very naturally explaining the dishes and the time it would take in preparations and suggested us accordingly. Such kind of service is unparalleled.

Even though I have elevated the service part in my review, don‚Äôt be mistaken and take nothing away from the food. It was top class. But when I picked Spice Kraft to go to, a certain reputation precedes it. You almost expect the food to be marvellous after reading all the appreciative reviews on Zomato and I have gotta say, Spice Kraft didn‚Äôt disappoint.

This place has become one of the legendary diners in Kolkata already within a year of opening. Yes! Spice Kraft is that good. Impeccable is the one word I would use to describe my entire experience at Spice Kraft. It‚Äôs not just about well-presented food, pin-point service or easy on the eyes ambience; it‚Äôs about the entire experience.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

This saturday i went this place, as i hv heard a lot about this place from my friend about their garnishing and food quality, so finally decide to go for it myself..
So from the very start the stuff was quite humble and welcome us quite well, i have ordered
1 > beer batter tampura fish
2> cheese lobster
3> friend rice
4> oyster sauce chicken
5> mango and kiwi crush...
I must say, the food was awsome including their innovative idea of putting the dishes in the table, loved it totally.. the mocktail served a little late, as some party was goin on inside, so they aplogised to us for that..

So it was great experience with them..... and i want to point out one more thing the stuffs were very communicative they were giving us which should be good or bad or which is no available..

All the good reviews that I have read about this restaurant are true. The friendliness of the staff seems genuine. The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing.¬†We had ordered
Beer can tempura Fish with a orange sauce - The sauce was uniquely prepared. A must try.
Squid ring in butter garlic
Devilled crab meat - the crab meat was so fresh and the spices and Dijon mustard with cream are blended very nicely.¬† It was a mouth watering dish.
Nasi Goreng and hunan chicken - I found Nasi Goreng a bit spicy
Last but not the least a warm brandy with apple cider. It was recommended by one of the staffs over there as I had sore throat. 
The foods were actually interesting.¬†I highly recommend it. great value for the price.

Avery nice place. Specially if you want to booze. Different offers are always there like buy 2 pegs and get the 3 one free and so on. The behaviour of the staff was extraordinarily good. They helps us out with what to take as sides and as it the late the chef himself came up to take our order and suggest us what to have. To be true if you are also in a bit cash crunch this place won't matter cause to price compared to the amount of servings is less. Yeah if you want to booze once or twice a week this is a perfect place with a well to do ambience.

Location-Ballygunge,Kolkata.

In the growing trend for molecular gastronomy restaurant in Kolkata,Spice Kraft has came up very well with the notion.For us gastronomy now means "Where food meets with art and innovation."It is also among the rare restaurant that focuses on building close relationship with its customer.Besides this we had a great opportunity of being the auditor to the knowledge imparted by its owner regarding cuisines.The service in respect of food also went very well.The presentation was of top notch and the ambiance was extremely calm and soothing.The whole place was divided in three sections.and can accomodate around 70-75 at a time.Now coming to the food,We had-

1:Pain Killer
2:Deconstructed Papdi Chaat 
3:The Terminator
4:Kele Ke Phool Ke Corque Monsieur
5:Chilly Paneer
6:Hari Moti Seek 
7:Scall And Mushroom Duxelle
8:Classic Monte Carlo

All the above items were excellent in taste and among them their must try are "Pain Killer" and "Kele Ke Phool Ke Corque Monsieur".

Food -5/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Service-5/5

Would love to visit this place again in order to try their other Food Art.‚ò∫‚ò∫

Spice Kraft is located near to Hazra Law College. You can use maps to spot the place, ample parking on the very side where the restaurant is located. Upon entering you would come across a nicely lit restaurant with minimal decor. The owner/head chef is always around & would make you feel at home üòä . 
Food was excellent. I tried beer can tempura,dajaj charmoula, nasi goreng & spicy orange peel chicken to conclude with. Loved them all. Would surely visit again

Amazing!!!!  The first word came to my mind as I entered the place "Spice Kraft" located at ballygunj phadi. Awesome ambience, classy interiors, amazing space and mouth watering food, that means all great things at one place. The restaurant is already highly rated and always fully occupied. The lightnings and background music keeps the magic on during your dine in.  Now come to the food we had. 
Starting with the beverage we had 
cucumber cooler - It was Brisk and sensational. The moment i took a sip I was just WOW. 
In starter we had some amazingly great stuff that I ever try
Bacardy limon - the presentation was awesome and the taste too. I liked the crunchy outer layer with juicy flesh inside. 
Beer Can Tempura Fish - love the juicy flesh of the fish with amazing "Dip". 
Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce - Again awesome plating with well Grilled fish. This is a must try item in the menu. 
In the main course we had
Chicken stroganoff - chicken keema with lots of stroganoff cheese that melts in your mouth and make feel your soothing soul amaze. 
And last but not the least the happy ending part - The Dessert
Classic Monte Carlo -  The best choco-vanilla ice cream I ever had. The duo makes the perfect combination and feels like Heaven. 
Their staffs are well behaved and all cares about your comfort. The service was awesome and my experience too. Hope to be there soon. üòä

Spice kraft. Heard a lot about it from my friends. Finally we made our way to the restaurant. On entering you get the proper feel of a fine dining setup. The lights were just perfectly dim to create that soothing environment.

Coming to the food now. We ordered quite a few items.

1)Dajaj charmoula
2)Beer can tempura fish
3)grilled fish with lemon butter sauce
4)lymen samak
5)chicken strogenoff with rice
6)classic monte carlo

The presentation of all the above items were just fabulous. Never seen before kind of presentation. It really makes one eat from their eyes first. The taste was equally good. My favorite was lymen samak. This fish dish surely is a must try. 

Another thing which came into my notice was that this place scores high on the variety of dips they offer with different starters. In a way they are very diversified. The dessert monte carlo was also a big tick in the box. Simply loved it.

Overall a lovely place to dine in where service is brisk and prompt. Highly recommended for all. Keep it up team SPICE KRAFT.üòÉ

Went here last Wednesday and got seat in the inner area. The lights were a bit gloomy but were in accordance to the dining setup. We ordered the recommendations from Zomato (Beer Can Tempura fish and Dajaj Chermoula) for starters along with L.I.I.T and a beer. Both the items were very good in taste and served amazingly. Tempura fish was juicy and tangy.
For main course, we ordered Nawabi Dum ki Murg along with some butter naans as we were already full after starters. They brought naans on a cycle shaped basket which as very lovely. The chiken dish was also very tasty n nicely cooked.

Would definitely love to visit again.

New Wonder in Kolkata Spice Kraft with their fusion foods.
Rated 4.7 wow..
Let's try.
So I went with my best buddy.

Tried 3cocktails
Cranberry Driver
Utterly Butterly Jameson
Liquid Bomb

And in food we tried to cover most of the famous items of it.

Beer Can Tempura Fish (awesome)
Shepard's Pie(tastes exactly like the authentic one)
Devilled Crab Meat(i felt must try, due to boneless crab meat)
Dajaj Cermoula (Okeyish not so special in taste)
Lime Fused Tandoori Chicken Sausage (not good in taste, it might look good in photos)
Lemon Shamak (Ordinary)

100% Jack Daniels Mousse also nice and strong to taste.

We got a table in inner section which was very low dim lighted with blue light. Very hard to see anything in menu card also the person with whom you are talking.

Helpful staffs are knowledgeable about their menu.

Nice experience. They also serves Chinese, Mughlai and North Indian Cuisine.

                    

Though I am not sure about next visit, because we tried most of the dishes.

A small cosy place with great food on offer. Every item on the menu is just splendid. We tried the Coq-Au-Vin which is a French dish with braised chicken and mushroom. ¬†Perfect in every way. We also tried the Middle Eastern Dajaj Chermoula which is a dish of chicken drumsticks in chermoula spices. Piping hot and perfection in every bite. The service is amazing and the staff courteous, warm and eager to help. Five pointer this one !!

Food was really great.. Five stars for food
But they took almost 20 minutes to get our cheque. Glasses were not clean, few staffs were really dull .
They need to maintain cleanliness & hygiene.
If you don't care about these things just big time foodie must visit there, try their white Alfredo pasta.

A great place to dine or hangout in with its wonderful variety of dishes. We had the beer can tempura fish, a baby octopus bell n pepper and squid rings in butter garlic saide along with jack Daniels chocolate mousse. All the items were just too good for the taste buds. The place also has some various country specific dishes besides the long list of drinks. The food quality as well as quantity based on the price is top notch. The service and ambience was also on the very satisfactory level. Overall a nice outlet amongst various competitions in and around ballygunge area. Very much recommended visit and re-visit as well.

A must visit place for all the foodies out there..Tried the signature dish dajaj chemoula.... Which was delicious.... I found the beer battered tempura fish a bit oily and it makes you feel full... But it's worth a try.... 
The flavoured rice in Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce is just awesome.... The fish was also very soft and nicely baked.
We were too full to have desserts.
Moon fan  and chicken in oyster and mushroom sauce was packed as take away.They were equally good.
I am surely gonna visit this place again soon.Have missed out some of the good ones from the menu....

Been to this place on a Sunday. The ambience was nice and cozy serving both veg and non veg. The manager and staff were very enthusiastic. The manager was like we are known for best cocktails and almost forced us to try and order a few cocktails. It was the Valentine's month hence the menu available was very limited and even less vegetarian dishes. 

We ordered mushrooms and babycorns for starters which though less in quantity tasted good. For main course we ordered paneer, chana and dal makhani which was not something which was out of the world.

The cocktails and mocktails we tried were not great even....

The overall experience was very okey'iesh and nothing great to be recommended.

Have an desire to been here from so long but being an vegetarian never had a courage to do so as Spice Craft is famous for it's non vegetarian dishes only. But few days back some of my vegetarian friends dine in here and said to me that you must visit here cause their veg dishes are equally delicious. So this evening with a friend of mine I walk in here and experience an amazingly delicious experience with their veg dishes.

Before I reviewe my experience with food like to give a brief info about Spice Craft.

Spice Craft was an multi cuisine restaurant cum bar which serves Continental, Middle Eastern and Asian Cuisines and some refreshing and amazing cocktails.

Spice Craft was situated in Hazra Road near Hazra Law College just a minute walking from Balligunje Phari.

D√©cor - A decent sized restaurant with sitting around 70. Separated in 3 big halls all were designed and decorated differently. They have separate couple section, small group section and table for 4. Comfortable sitting arrangement. Classy rich d√©cor, attractive lights and crafty glasses all n all designed and decorated very ravishingly.

Ambience - Peaceful environment with low background music and a glass of wine. Ambience was really classy and hospitality was just heart touching. Owner and staffs all were very friendly, soft spoken, helpful and loving. They maintained the cleanness and hygiene very well. Service in reasonable time and presentation was superb.

Now let's talk about food starting with couple of drinks we tried.

* Tangarita - Tangarita was the tangy, little spice, fizzy and refreshing version of margarita. I tried the virgin version which was club soda based and contains pineapple & orange juice, green chillies &ginger, chat masala and it's tastes heavenly delicious.

* Pain Killer - This was the vodka based drink made with the deadly combination of cranberry juice and lime juice. Refreshing, little tangy, little sour and deliciously intresting just like it's name.

With there refreshing drinks we tried couple of starters too which were reviewed below -

* Kele - ke - phool ke croque monsieur - The croque monsieur is a baked or fried boiled ham and cheese sandwich. The dish originated in French caf√©s and bars as a quick snack. They made it traditionally with banana flower as main ingredient. It was topped with pineapple slice and baked cheese. It's taste was delicious and it's served in palette with cold sour dip made with avocados and bitter gourd.

* Stir Fried Scallions & Mushroom duxelle - At Spice Kraft, chef and owner Sambit Banick makes it a point to mix and marry cuisines. For their stir-fried scallions and mushroom duxelle, with spicy mirin reduction, the marriage is between classic French duxelles and a spicy Asian sauce. For the duxelle, the mushrooms are chopped and cooked in butter and made into a paste. Then, to add to it a zing of Asian flavour, a reduction of mirin is used. Served on canapes, it's sprinkled with stir-fried scallions.

That's all with the Drinks and Starters. Now let's move to the Main Course where we tried couple of Oriented dishes reviewed below -

* Veg Nasi Goreng - Nasi goreng, literally meaning "fried rice" in¬†Indonesian, can refer simply to fried pre-cooked rice, a meal including¬†stir fried¬†rice in small amount of¬†cooking oil, typically spiced with¬†kecap manis¬†(sweet soy sauce),¬†shallot,¬†garlic, ground¬†shrimp paste,¬†tamarind¬†and¬†chilli¬†and accompanied by other ingredients.¬†It is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavor, owed to generous amount of caramelized sweet soy sauce and powdered shrimp paste, and the taste is stronger and spicier compared to Chinese fried rice. Nasi goreng¬†has been called the¬†national dish¬†of¬†Indonesia.

* Silken Tofu In Japanese Golden Curry - This fully vegetarian version of the classic katsu curry is sure to please even the most voracious meat-eater. Silken tofu sits centre stage surrounded by delicious and aromatic curry sauce and plenty of vegetables. Perfect for lunch or dinner whenever you get that veggie feeling for katsu curry.

We Ended Our Global Cuisine Restrobar experience with the most delicious dessert I've ever tried named
* 100% Jack Daniels Mousse - Two scoops of Coffee & Chocolate mixture taken and blown above with Nitrogen dioxide and cooled using liquid nitrogen to form Chunks, light and airy. It is served with four pieces of pineapple flavored spongy cakes and Orange jelly and the jack Daniel whisky inside the scoops making this dessert tastes heavenly.

That's all with the food experience folks but before rapt up like to thank Owner/Head Chef and Staff for such amazing experience. A must try place highly recommended to all. Personal favorite of mine.

The moment we entered the restaurant, the playfulness and the sophisticated use of light in the decor, convinced us of the thought that the management has put into trying to make this place ooze a fine dining aura.

All that kept aside, what is that one thing that has always spoken to you most about a restaurant or for that matter any eatery? For me, that has always been the food, next in line always came the service. At Spice Kraft, both these segments is looked into with utmost consideration and the result is always unanimously great. Soon we had the menu cards in our hands and were ready to order food.¬†

For the APPETIZERS, we ordered the very popular Daraj Charmoula and the Beer can tempura fish. Both these dishes impressed us to the brim and we were happy to order seconds. We also ordered a new addition to their vast menu, which was the Escalope Chicken in Spicy Choco Mole. The dish is a perfect pick for anyone who wants to be surprised. Chicken morsels come daggered with syrenges of mollases int them and covered in the spicy choco mole. You can dribble as little or as much of the mollases on the chicken as you prefer, making your very own combination of sweet and spicy that agree beautifully to your taste buds. I loved it and am sure to order it again on my next visit.

Next we moved onto the MAIN COURSE, settling for a portion of the Coq- Au-Vin, Shephard's Pie, Laal Maas & Pudine k parathe and finally another new and mindblowing-ly delicious addition to the menu, the Fish- En- Pafillote. Yes, a lot of food and we loved it all. While most people love the appetizers here, the main course was absolutely the highlight for us. I loved my Coq-Au-Vin, but could not stop myself from tucking into the laal maas, shephard's pie and fish later. Every dish in front of us craved for attention and we made sure, we gave all the attention it deserved.
We gulped all this delicious food down with quite a few mocktails, the favorite of the lot were the Red Grape and Basil Tornado and the Cucumber Cooler. A good meal is when you not only enjoy the food while at the restaurant, but leave with a happy memory of the same as well. That is exactly what Spice Kraft's tempting spread did for me today. Looking forward to dropping back in, soon.

Have tried this place after reading the reviews. To talk of the place the ambience is good but they have the place divided into rooms which don't give feeling of warm open environment..now if you are family u can  sit at front space but if you are 2 young man you gotta sit in another room coz as per them you are bound to create nuisance hypothetically...well the owner and chef Sambit will interact with customers and make you comfortable and also detail on the food menu...we wanted to try pork and he suggested few dish to make the night on pork but at the end it was not worth it...then we tried lemon fish which I can say was authentic and great.the presentation of food on the plate is something to talk about and great....overall service is OK and not something to remember about..suggest to work on the ambience as it feels so closed and claustrophobic..

Spice Kraft has developed quite a name for itself which drew me to it on a Sunday evening. As expected the place was full and we had to wait for a good 20 minutes or so before getting a table. I felt that the tables set a little too close to each other which led to a lot of interference. The background music was good - music of classic songs in both English and Hindi, although a tad bit loud but manageable. The restaurant hit the right note with dimness of the lights. I felt it fell a little short of being called a good fine dine restaurant.

They have quite a menu with their signature dishes. We ordered Prawns(made specially off the menu), Khoai Tay(which is basically honey chilli potato, only fancier) and Alfredo pasta along with Kokum Rita(tequila based with kokum flavor and chaat Masala), The Mango Driver(vodka with Maaza) and Spicy Pomegranate+Cointreau+Tonic molecular infusion. The drinks were great...all of them! Good strong as well. Two of the drinks were spicy in nature which some may not have a taste for, but I certainly recommend them. Food was decent, not good. The Khoai Tay had a lot of Masala along with the Aloo, which frankly I didn't have a stomach for. The pasta was really very sweet - disliked it. Also, it had a lot of beans in it which i found very surprising. Prawns were good.

I would have rated them 3.5, but for the great service! Really friendly and knowledgeable staff who helped us with the order and ensured we were having a great time. Food/drinks didn't take much time to arrive either. And on top of this, the prices of this place are really low for the offering...which I feel is the primary point of attraction for them because it makes this place a 100% value for money restaurant.

So here we are, a place that in my opinion does everything right. There are so many places serving good food and with beautiful ambiance, but i believe its the courtesy and the staff behavior that always pushes through the extra mile. It was a Saturday and we arrived late for lunch. Although there was very little time left for the last order, the manager escorted us in and said they would extend it for sometime for us. A very well decorated place and visibly crowded.¬†

Coming to the food, they provide an exciting and a comprehensive choice of food in their menu. Some of their alcohol infused dishes will surely make you try them just out of curiosity. The molecular infusions, Kraftworks and others in their cocktail menu is absolutely spot on. We settled for a Smoked Guava with Captain Morgan and Ginger Ale, Hazelnut Heaven and a White Wine Sangria all of which were delicious and to be honest pretty potent. Coming to the food menu we ordered Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab, Chicken Stroganoff, Shepherd's Pie, Lobster Thermidor, Dajaj Chermoula, Murg Reshmi ¬†Malai and a Ham Steak. Everything looked fantastic and tasted delicious. The only thing missing out was in the chicken stroganoff which was a little bland and needed more seasoning. We finished off our lunch with Jack Daniel Mousse from their boozerts menu which was also a delight.¬†

Extremely courteous staff and although we went past their lunch service hours none of them hurried or told us anything. They gave us our own sweet time to relish the delicious food. Pocket pinch is average. Overall a lovely experience. Will surely return again, hungry for more. Highly recommended. :)

It's never too late to write a review for a place which returns good memories. On 19th February we went to "Spicekraft". We reached around 2.30 pm and the place was fully occupied. We were in no place to wait  for a while. Soon the waiter came and ask us to adjust with a 6 seater  table and once a 2 seater will be available to shift us. Great!!! He immediately have two menus for food and drink. He suggested an Action 2000 for me and a painkiller for my mate. To start with we have ordered beer can tempura fish and Bacardi lemon infused tandoori chicken sausages. When the cocktail came I was just looking into it. It was big.....And it's a mix of alcohols. Really strong.The signature starter fish was exceptionally good. Crispy from outside and very soft inside and the smells like beer.... The waiter explains about each starter preparation in detail. I was so happy to listen to him.The chicken sausages was also good and came with a mint and Bacardi mix shot complements with churans and blueberries. Awesome. After that‚Äã in main course we have ordered Devilled Crab meet. Basically the Crab meet was.baked with cream and cheese.tastes ok. With Garlic naan's we asked for Murg da mokul. Each and every dish was giving it's own tastes and m loving it. In desert we took 100‚ÑÖjack Daniel chocolate mouse. Mind blowing...... Finally the bill came up with Rs.2975. It was one of the best place to dine in and I will visit again for sure.

Spice Kraft is one of that kind of restaurant, where food meets with innovation.This place has been long in my wishlist.yesterday i came here with my friend for dinner. And i was totally blown away with their food and quirky presentation of their food.

Ambiance: Ambiance is very classy, though outerlook is not so extraordinary but their quirky touches of
interior, mystic light with soft music , mirror kraft-are a all absolute delight .

Now coming on their food part.Best thing of this place is cocktails,highlighted part of spice kraft.
We ordered -
*Pain killer- vodka based cocktail with the mixture of Canterbury juice,lime.it tastes as interesting as its name.
*Tangarita Mocktail-this one is non-alcoholic , blending of orange juice ,pine apple juice ,green chili and club soda. Very refreshing to have.
*Starter*
Kele ka fool croque Monsiuer-stuffed with Mocha.tastes amazing ,gooey,mouthmelting.Must rty this one.
Dajaj chermoula- dish of drumsticks, served in individual bowl.this one is well-known starter of their.Every bite of it is like buttery bite.Highly recommended.
Stir fried scallions and Mushroom Duxelle- if you ever ignore this veg dish, just try this.it tastes awesome.
Lymwyn Samak-this one is one of the gem of Lebanon cuisine,6 pieces of smoky grilled lime fish.stuffs are so fresh.enjoyed every bite of it.
After finishing such lovely starter we have ordered veg Nasi Goreng,silken Tofu in Japanese Goldsn curry,Spicy Orange peel chicken.
*Veg Nasi Goreng-it is National food of Indonasia,tastes good.Difdfrent kind of flavour of chillies you can find here.
*Silken Tofu In Japanese Golden Curry : variety of vegetables, panner comes in a white gravy with Japanese golden spices.Healthy one.
*Spicy Orange peel chicken:this dish is awesome.Twisting part of this dish lies in its gravy, amazingly balanced of orange spill and chillies.

100‚ÑÖJack Daniel Dessert:



. This one is kind of epitom of satisfaction.2 scoope of ice cream blended with whisky served with their spongy little round shape cake.Must try.

Staff's behaviour heart warming and service is also good and prompt.
This is the place where you can find Global cuisine, where food served with creativity Highly recommended.

Had been noticing this place for quite sometime on my Hazra-Ballygunge route. Finally paid a visit.

The restaurant won't appear anything extraordinary from outside but the interiors are sure to surprise you. Ambiance and music is good. Staffs have been extremely helpful.

We had ordered a couple of things. 
Starting with Dajaj Chermoula, Beer Can Tempura Fish with Orange Ponzu Tartar√© dip, Kele Ke Phool Ke Croque Monsieur, Khoai Tay and followed by Devilled Crab Meat, Baked Fish Canollis, Chicken Strogonaff.

I absolutely loved the Dajaj Chermoula - it is something in between a chicken lollipop and a kebab. The dip accompanying it was a yogurt based dip - being a Lebanese item - which was okay.
The Beer Can Tempura Fish, again, tasted more like our Fish Batter Fry, but with a twist. Loved the orange-based dip with it.
Kele Ke Phool Ke Croque Monsieur was nothing but 'Mochaa' which was good.
Loved the Khoai Tay. Serves as a wonderful vegetarian starter.
The Devilled Crab Meat and Chicken Strogonaff was good.
No words to describe the Baked Fish Canollis which was absolutely lip smacking!

For dessert we tried the Fried Ice Cream. Loved the presentation. Not sure about the ice cream flavour but the outside coating was surely coconut. Well enough.

This place is definitely recommended. I'm surely coming back to try the Chinese and Indian dishes!

A nice place and affordable too.. Staffs are very helpful and their behavior is too good.. Food is good but the Lucknowi dum biryani we ordered there tastes sweet we need to add salt on it before having it.. The  Nagori Lahsooni Tangdi was too good and spicy üòÇ.. Went there as my anniversary date with my boyfriend, we ordered Daiquini for me and Budweizer for him.. As the last course, he ordered 100% Jack Daniel's and Barry calebant Swiss chocolate mousse, Drunken Petit Fours and I ordered Classic Montecarlo, both are too good.. Overall we had a nice experience there..

A really great joint.  Dajaj Chermoula and Lymwyn Samak are my favorite appetisers on their menu. The former is a dish of drumsticks served in individual little bowls and the latter is a fish dish, comprising melt-in-the-mouth chunks of fish accompanied by a wonderful,subtly flavoured yoghurt based dip. The cucumber based vodkatini was exceptionally well-made. The Coq-Au-Vin was also a good dish,but not as memorable as the appetisers. Unfortunately, did not have room for dessert. Intend to return again to sample more from their innovative bar menu and the Jack Daniels mousse!

Spicekraft has been long in mywishlist. Probably the longest since date. Hearing all the recommendations and seeing all the ratings I was expecting to be completely blown away, but unfortunately that wasn't the case.
However, food was good and the presentation was unique, but taste was nothing too special.
Alcohol is available at a cheaper rate. We ordered LIIT and two pegs of Smirnoff.
In the food section we had-
BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH- this was the best among what we had ordered.. Five pieces of batter fried fish. The amount of fish inside was good
BACARDI LIMON INFUSED CHICKEN SAUSAGES - The presentation was unique, and it would definitely raise your expectations. But in the end it actually disappointed.
NAGORI LAHSONI TANGDI - Four chicken leg pieces were served. Tasted good and was soft and succulent. But the pieces were small and the amount was too little.
COQ-AU-VIN- This is one of their continental dishes. Consisted of steamed rice with a chicken preparation. Nothing special.
BABY OCTOPUS SALT AND PEPPER - We packed this one. It was nothing what I had expected. Contained a of gravy that was too liquid in consistency and was like "jhol" (in bengali)
JACK DANIEL CHOCOLATE MOUSSE - There has been a lot of hype around this item. But never understood why. It was too bitter. Well maybe it had some alcohol infused, but well I didn't like it at all.
So in the end it all narrows down to your preferences. This place has got some extraordinary ratings which automatically makes it a must visit. But there are some rare occassions (just like my case), where you go in with a lot of expectations and they are half fulfilled, so you have to come out with a bitter heart..
Definitely visit, but don't over expect..

Location-A 5-minute's walk from Ballygunge Phari,this place is prominently located just opposite Hazra Law College.

Ambience-Pristine.The lighting,the soft music,the wine cabinet,the furniture and the mirror-work all add up to the elegant aura of this place,which is way more spacious and sprawling than it appears from outside.

Food-I had come here with a friend for lunch.Everything on the menu sounded so irresistible that we ordered an eclectic mix of dishes,mainly Asian and middle-eastern.The highlights:

SHISH TAOUK(4.75/5)-My pick from the lot.The melt-in-the-mouth texture of these unctuous beauties almost seems like witchcraft because I have never tasted chicken this tender and tasty.The sous vide technique is the reason behind the magic, I reckon.

DAJAJ CHERMOULA(4/5)-The taste and texture of the eponymous bestseller of this place is similar to the Shish Taouk kebabs but the size was way smaller than I had expected.They put the chicken pieces on a wooden block inside a clay drum ,to rest the meat and keep it's moisture intact, which gave an illusion of added height.The actual pieces were quite small to my dismay.I also didn't like the accompanying yoghurt dip,a slipshod rendition of labneh perhaps,which was way too sweet for my taste.The flavour of the sparse garlic chips on top didn't come through at all despite the fact that all Lebanese dips,be it toum or labneh,have garlic as an integral ingredient.

MOON FAN RICE(4/5)-I loved the intense umami hit in the rice and abundance of chicken,egg and mushrooms.Way better than your run-of-the-mill chinese fried rice.

CHICKEN MANCHURIAN(4.25/5)-The best of places mess up the simplest of dishes but I laud team Spice Kraft's attention to detail.This simple dish was yummy,garlicky and had 8 sizeable chunks of chicken, slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

We were so full that we had to skip the desserts and get half of the main course packed.

Prices-This is where Spice Kraft deserves that extra 0.5 rating.The prices are reasonable enough for a fine dining place of such high calibre.The chef's Le Cordon Bleu stamp would have seen connoisseurs easily shelling out the big bucks but the chef has kept the prices justifiable for his food to cater to all demographics.Kudos to the team!

Service-The servers were still readying the place for service when we had dropped in at 12.30 pm on a Saturday afternoon.Despite that,the servers were prompt and the food didn't take much time to reach the table.

Verdict-Spice Kraft is well on it's way on achieving legendary status in the city and well-deservedly so.You are seriously missing out on something amazing if you haven't dropped in here yet.Bookmark this place right away and you won't be disappointed.

Brilliant Restaurant to be in!
Ambiance(10/10) Even though it isn't too big, the interiors are excellent.
Service and behavior(10/10): No words to explain this.

Drink: Cucumber Cooler(8/10): It refreshes your tastebuds from the very first sip. The sweet, sour-cum-salty taste is awesome.

‚òÖBeer Can Tempura Fish(10/10): 6 pieces of fried fish pretty similar to Fish Butter Fry with an unique continental touch by the chef with a sweet and spicy dip melts in your mouth. This is a must try.

‚ú©Chicken Stroganoff(10/10): Creamy and delicious.The perfect combination of ingredients won't disappoint you. It is served with toasted bread and goes along quite well.
‚òÖDajaj Charmoula(9/10): The sizes are not even, some are big some are small. Taste wise it's palatable. A brilliant starter. I'd try this again on my next visit.

‚ú©Baked Fish Canollis(10/10): In a brilliant place like this, you can't go wrong with any fish item in continental cuisine. Tender and well cooked, 3 pieces per plate and filling too. The sauces add a brilliant tinge. Beautiful presentation.
üëâ‚òÖ‚òÖDevilled Crab Meat(10/10): 2 pieces, served on the crab shell itself is a brilliant starter and deserves special attention. The cheesy goodness with lip-smacking crab meat is remarkable. If you're into crab, don't wanna miss this.

‚ù§Fried Ice Cream(9/10): Just a day back, I had been asking my foodie buddies about where to find Fried IceCream and to my surprise, they had it! Its gorgeous from the outside and deliciously sweet from the inside. You can eat this out for hours and never get tired.

Khabar Niye kono Kotha Hobena Boss!

This molecular gastro-pub had been in my bucket list for quite some time. 
Located near Hazra Law College, this place is easy to find.
The place is beautifully decked up with dim blue lights. They have a place on wall where their wine collection is kept on display. The artwork is amazing and so is the truck on the table.‚úî
The ambience is very appealing with soft music in the background. Perfect for a conversation with family and friends. 
They have quirky names for the dishes they serve.üíØ
I tried the following items:
Cucumber cooler: Very refreshing.üëå
Baked Veg Cannelloni: it was quite impressive.
Kele Ke Phool: Delectable!üëåüëå
Khoai Tay: Good.
Fried Ice-cream: Impeccable.
The food does justice to the name of the restaurant, utilising spices amazingly well. My taste buds were truly satisfied.
The service was top notch.
The prices are reasonable.
Undoubtedly recommended.‚úîüíØ

Beer Can Tempura Fish, Dajaj Charmoula, 100% Jack Daniels Mousse.
They may serve a lot more but yeah, these items standout from the rest.
Probably one the best batter fish preparations and UNDOUBTEDLY one of the best desserts in the city.

Besides food, the ambience alongwith the interactive and hospitable staff (especially the F&B Manager) can make your evenings an enjoyable one.

Oh my God!! 

That was the first thing that I said after I got up to go from this place, fully satisfied with the experience and making a mental note to come here again and again to try every possible VEGETARIAN dish available here.

The ambience here is quite likeable with soft music playing in the backyard. Perfect for a conversation with family or friends without getting disturbed by the music. Accompanying the music is the wide array of cocktails, wine and other drinks which compliment the overall feel of the place in a perfect way. 
We ordered Spicy pomegranate cocktail, Smoked Guava, a mocktail of Kiwi and Mango crush, beer Cocktail with Heineken pint, a cocktail with ginger which came hot etc. I don't remember the name of every thing as you don't need to. For which I will come to the next part. 

Don't even bother to go through the menu. The chef here is so feedback oriented that you can see him asking the customers about the taste of food. If you call him.and tell him your taste, he will himself order for you. And believe me when I say this, whatever he orders it will be to your liking and absolutely lip smacking delicious. 
Even the waiting staff is knowledgeable about every dish and might give you some super suggestions. 
I am not going to name any dish here. Look at the photos and decide whether you want to go here or not. 

P.S. : I do remember the vegetation starter I had. 
Kele ke Phool ke ...........
Oh forget it. I might not remember. See the menu and order this which starts with Kele ke Phool. Super new taste for Vegetarians.

We suggest you to try beer can tempura fish,  pork ribs burrah kebab,  lobster thermidor, soy braised drums of heaven old monk flambe and, you can always consult the chef who is always at your Beck and call.  There is lot of creativity and thought involved with each dish they serve.  Only demand is now they should get a bigger place.

This restaurant is a gastronomic ¬†delight for the soul and more so for gluttons like us.. have been to this restaurant more than 6 times now and I still cannot get enough of it.. the location is extremely convenient just a minute walk from ¬†ballygunge phari towards hazra Law college... the decoration is minimalistic with a little quirky details here and there.. now coming to the food,in all my visits there I have tasted quite an array of dishes and all of them were lip smacking good .. still to name a few..
1) meen moili-- creamy coconut based sauce with chunks of bekti. balanced to perfection based teamed with ¬†goan rice as suggested by Chef Sambit .
2) Dajaj Chermoula- Chicken legs char grill served in earthen pots.. yumm is the word
3) Green chilli chicken -- a thai speciality and as such hot, tangy spicy creating a burst of flavours
4) Prawn Thermidor - classic and they do it perfectly
5) Coq- au Vin ¬†- Red wine roasted chicken
6) Beer batter fried fish-- crisp on the outside creamy inside.. should I say more
7) Jack Daniels Chocolate Mousse- Sinful indulgence

The staff are courteous, competent and they give great suggestions moreover the Chef/ Owner is very enthusiastic taking personal care in client satisfaction..
Overall a must place to dine ¬†..

Visited this place on the evening of swaraswati puja with a friend and the place just stole our hearts. From food to service and ambience, everything was perfect. 
Starting with the ambience, it is beautifully decorated restaurants with medium blue lighting and gives a very soothing atmosphere. The place is a bit small but the ambience seemed appealing. Now coming to the food and alcohol. They had brilliant names for the food they serve, which not only sounded good but was equally lipsmacking. They were as tasty ,awesome and as well as unique. butter naans were served in a cycle rickshaw toy, the presentation was amazing as well as eye-catching. The staffs were so friendly and helped us ¬†to choose the menu as per our choice. After all these orders, the bill wasn't at all scary. Rather it was amazingly affordable. I would definitely come back here soon.

Spice Kraft has always been on my bucket list.
So, I was very excited before visiting this restaurant.
Dimly lit but has an attrative decor.
We had ordered:
Beer can tempura fish: which was really tasty and tender.
Dajaj Charmoula: the taste was satisfactory, nothing great about it except the presentation. Rather I'd say the Drums of Heaven was way better.
Shephard's pie: was cheesy and really nice.
And for desserts we had taken 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse,Drunken Petit Fours. An exotic and outstandingly luscious dessert.
Today on the occassion of Valentines day Spice Kraft has a new and wide range of V-day special dishes on their menu.

I had heard a lot about this place from various sources and mainly positive and encouraging things which finally encouraged me to give it a try on new years eve although i was not very confident about it bcoz of reasons, then unknown. Frankly if u get over the initial fancy menu and presentation, it comes around as a quite moderate restaurant. Its like shaadi ka laddoo, if u know what i mean üòâ.

Located at a prime destination, this restaurant is springing up as one of the finest food joints of Kolkata serving the most pleasureful delicacies of Indian subcontinent n continental cuisine as well.. The decor is very pleasant with music to rhythm up ur beats...very clean n fine dining restaurant...
We ordered the following:

#Lymwn Samak- a delicacy from the Lebanon cuisine, serving 6 pieces of lime grilled fish with a smoky grilled texture on top n smooth mouth melting fish, served with a mayo dip flavoured with all purpose herbs. The presentation is superb...

#Laal maas- bony mutton slow cooked with a red gravy of Rajasthani chillies n sweet onion. The smooth red gravy is full of Indian spices n well cooked mutton is just finger licking good..

#butter naan- soft butter brushed naans were served in a cycle rickshaw toy...this amazing presentation is very eye-catching...

Service is excellent, service time is excellent too as u won't have to wait too long for ur food...overall it's a madness point for all food lovers like me....

This is probably my favourite restaurant in Kolkata right now. From an eclectic selection of drinks and cocktails to an exotic assortment of food, SpiceKraft is definitely a cut above the rest. Here is a restaurant that genuinely has upended the decades old culinary landscape in Kolkata dominated by the legacy hubs of Park Street and the Mughlai stalwarts of old Calcutta. 

This place serves probably the best LIIT of all the places in Kol. I have been to all the other regular joints and I can safely vouch that SpiceKraft's LIIT is perfection. If you are planning to have something neat, ask the server for a pick of the day and he will help you out. 

When it comes to the food, where do I start?? Definitely try the Shish Taouk. The earthy aroma and the presentation earns it extra brownie points. The beer can Fish Tempura is another one of my favourites. Also on the hit list - Devilled Crab Meat. All right, I am about to say something blasphemous - the Devilled Crab Meat at SpiceKraft trumps the one at Mocambo. I love the Mocambo one, but I like this one, simply because it actually has crab meat as opposed to the dollops of cheese at Mocambo. And definitely last but not the least, the Shepherd's Pie. Simply a stunner ( albeit a bit too oily for my taste ).

All right, that's about it. Cost falls solidly on the upper middle index. But a great value-for-money if you consider the taste and quality.

First thing, absolutely worth it! 
Easy to find. Just 5mins walk from Ballygunge Phari. They dont have 'happy hours' but they have amazing deal on drinks. We ordered for food Dajaj Charmoula and Pork ribs Burrah Kabab. They were incredible. Specially pork ribs with imli chutney, amazing fusion. I loved their plating. Then for drinks cosmos, mango driver, beers and long island ice teas. Worth it. Ambience & music was good. Best for taking your partners out on a date. And the staffs were all so friendly. My new favourite place! :)

Really amazing cocktails. But one suggestion as far as the drinks are concerned, do not go for what the waiter suggests, apni akal lagao. A thumbs up for presentation of food. The 'fish in a beer can' dish though sinfully deep fried, is a must try.

Visited this place yesterday with a friend and boy this place stole our hearts. From food and drinks to service, everything was top-notch.
Starting with the ambience, this is a beautifully decorated restaurant with medium lighting and gives a very soothing atmosphere.
Now coming to the food and drinks, first we placed the order for a Long Island Iced Tea and a Classic Cosmopolitan along with Beer Can Tempura Fish And Dajaj Charmoula.
The LIIT was great. The taste of the alcohol was properly balanced by the cola and lemon wedges.
The Classic Cosmopolitan with absolut was also good. It had a sweet taste and it is best for people who are light drinkers as it doesn't have any overpowering taste of vodka.
Next came the Dajaj Charmoula. It was lip-smacking. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the dip provided with it had a sweet and sour taste with some burned garlic. It was also good and went well with the tender and lip-smacking chicken.
Then came the Beer Can Tempura Fish. Oh boy it was so so delicious. It was crispy outside and the fish was soft inside and the dip provided with it was also good and went really well with those tempuras.
For the main course we ordered Shepherd's Pie. It was accompanied by garlic bread. The Shepherd's pie had a lamb filling with a crust of mashed potato. It was baked to perfection and had a very smooth taste like a taste which everyone will like.
For dessert we ordered their much talked about 100 Percent Jack Daniels Mousse. It was accompanied with 4 small and round sponge cake like things soaked in cointreau with some orange sauce like thing.. It was the best ending to a meal anyone can ask for.
A special mention to the presentation od the food. Each and every food we ordered was presented in a unique way. Thus making it visually satisfying as well.
And their service is also praise-worthy. After every dish came to our table we were attended by someone from their team who explained to us how the particular dish was prepared.
I would like to recommend this place to everyone.. Try visiting once and I can assure you won't regret it.

I had heard of this place earlier as well never had a chance to visit. However this saraswati Puja ,me and my mates decided to get this place checked out. Of our list. The place is a bit small but the ambience was soothing and seemed appealing. Now coming to the food and alcohol. They had this brilliant names for the food they served which not only sounded good but was equally lipsmacking. Starting from the starters to the main course we ordered like crazy and everything was brilliant - both quality and quantity. The cocktails were amazingly made with the right amount of mix - LIIT , daquiri, margarita,  tequila. We had a brilliant time. The attendants were well mannered and service was pretty good. To top all this after all these orders the bill wasn't at all scary. Rather it was brilliantly affordable. I would definitely come back here soon enough.

This is one hell of a place. Their variety of cocktails, their own speciality of fusion of alcohol with food, and all the cocktails that we tried were mind blowing! No complaints at all. From the moment we entered this place, each and every detail of customer satisfaction was taken care of! The waiters were very much welcoming, and took excellent care of their visitors. The ambience was very sophisticated, with dimly lit blue coloured lights, and it was soothing in every ways! 

I went here today with my friends, and our prime  motive was to try their cocktails, which are praised by many. We ordered Choco Beam, The Mango Driver, LIIT & Utterly Butterly Jameson. Choco Beam was the best of the lot unanimously! It was a perfect fusion of chocolate syrup and bourbon whiskey with the right amount of whiskey in it. The Mango Driver with Absolut Vodka was our next cocktail, and it was pretty light. Each and every molecule of the drink pleased our tastebuds, but their was less feel of alcohol. LIIT is not their speciality, and it is a rather common cocktail. It was again made to perfection. The way they serve to the granular details in their preparation, everything is reflected in the ratings they get! LIIT was the strongest of the lot, but still there are lots of cocktails which can beat these in terms of alcohol content. Lastly, the Utterly Butterly Jameson is a cocktail which will be liked by anybody who loves Peanut Butter, since it's flavour is dominated by it. I love peanut butter, and the drink pleased me well. Apart from these, we also ordered Budweiser, and I'm not going to elaborate on this, since there is no credit of this joint in this. In food, we just ordered Bacardi Infused Chicken Sausages, which was sumptuous! It was simple sausages but with a twist! Use of the famous rum Bacardi makes it worthwhile to be tried by anyone who visits here. Their thoughts are very well reflected in their dishes, and I just fell in love with this place. 

Overall, this place is a must visit for anyone who wants to taste a variety of cocktails and is a fan of untraditional fusion dishes. I will definitely visit this joint again to try some more cocktails, and also desserts, which is praised by many.

A great place to dine out.. we went for a lab treat. the hospitality was great. the food was awesome. specially the starters were "FATAFATI". although none of us were very excited to have baby octopus but once it was served it just disappeared. yes it was that much TASTY.¬†
The BEER canned tempura fish is a must have.
Dajaj Chermoula and Sish Taouk was too good... tooooo good.¬†
Sheperd's Pie was a new innovative recipe.. ¬†great.
the Awadhi Biriyani was also delicious.
Nawabi Dum ki MURG was yummy.
LAAL MAAS and Rarha Gosht was awsome.
on the top it we were just overwhelmed after having the newly introduced item in the dessert section... i.e The Great "FRIED ICE CREAM".. it's the yummiest thing.. ¬†

Totally impressed with everything. will visit again and again....

Is it just me or is this place really over-hyped?
Visited yesterday with a couple of friends. The interiors seemed nice apart from the absence of enough lights. Seriously guys, you should think about the less fortunate folks when it comes to testing the power of vision.
We had baby octopus with salt and pepper. The octopus felt proper in terms of texture. But where was the butter and garlic? It was heavily spiced and the butter seemed to disappear somewhere else!
Next we had Hong Shao Rou which is roast pork slices in oyster and hoisin sauce. I'll say, this one was pretty decent and was quite in tune with the description. There was good amount of pork and the fat was pretty well cooked.
Suon Nuong was next. This one was supposed to be "juicy pork ribs" but neither juicy nor "ribs" were properly found. The ribs in question were chopped into slices and the meat felt far from being edible. We had to try our best to get the meat from the rib, but in vain. The sauce was similar to all the previous dishes that were tasted till then.
The shepherd's pie was tried next. To be absolutely honest, this was very close to perfect. There were two ramekins loaded with lamb and veggies in gravy, topped with almost golden (?) mashed potatoes (excuse my inaccuracy because of the lights). The pie was paired with beautifully caramelized slices of garlic bread. The taste was not too subtle neither was it too rich.
Before we could miss out, the infamous Beer Can Tempura fish was ordered. By the description, it was assumed that it will be fried in beer batter instead of the usual batter but that was overlooked by the restaurant again: the batter was heavy like the usual local fried items found anywhere else. The filling for the fish was satisfactory. The tartare, however, lacked any "orange" presence, but acceptable.
Service was quick but the waiters did seem confused about the dishes when they were asked about the contents.
To sum up, out of the dishes tried, shepherd's pie might be the only reason for me to give this place another visit.

This restaurant is located very near to Ballygunge phari. From the menu card to the dishes to the billing box everything is so creative here. The waiters were so helpful in choosing our dishes. For starters we ordered their signature dishes Dajaj chermoula, beer canned tempura fish, egg candpes, shish touk. They suggested us to order Khao suye as a veg starter. The presentation and quality of food are awesome. 
Dajaj chermoula: The char grilled chicken legs cooked in the perfect way served in a beautiful manner with the dip.
Beer canned tempura fish: They were served inside a beer can layed with a chilli mayo sweet deep. The crisp and taste of the fries were perfect. 
Egg candpes: They were served on breads on a wooden colour palatte in the best way with proper portions of egg and cheddar cheese.
Shish touk: These Lebanese chicken kababs marinated with cream are so soft and tasty.They were just perfect.
Khao suey: It was a veg dish cooked in Mexican style with semi spicy sauces and herbs. The potatoes tasted so good blended in that sauce and herbs. 
Now coming to the drinks, we had silver shots and pitcher beer. Next time we will go for the cocktails.
Now the main course. Coq-au-vin , butter naan, kofte nazuuk Dil and murg Da Mukul were ordered. They were as tasty and awesome like the starters.
Atlast the desserts...Jack Daniels mousse was a hit. Overall it was an awesome experience with great food and drinks. Hope to visit this place soon. :)

It's not everyday that you find the chef of the house visiting the tables and checking on the guests. Chef Sambit is a superstar of the food scene in Kolkata. I don't use this for restaurants normally but the team really delighted the guests. Nice ambience and even nicer food. 

We, a bunch of friends, reached there on a Friday night. And we had to wait for them to get us a table. The waiters/servers are real gentlemen and if you aren't sure what to order, just ask them to help out and you won't be disappointed. 

We had cocktails and a continental meal. It was awesome. Terminator and Jack hammer for cocktails and tampura fried fish and pork ribs for starters. Then for the main course we had shepherd's pie and ham steak. 

The chef even came to check on his guests and was taking the feedback and offering suggestions on what to have, a true gastromic delight.

And yes they also accomodated one friend of our even after closing hours. 

One word. Awesome.

Location :  Somewhere between Ballygunge Phari and Mudiali . 

Ambiance :  One word : " Spectacular " . After evening , this place really shows it's colors . A dark and cosy elite vibe is what we got from this place . Very beautiful interiors . It was classy all around .

Service :  Just like the ambiance  , the service doesn't disappoint apart from the waiting time if you're a gang of above 5 ! But once we got in , the waiters were very knowledgeable , quick to act and gave recommendations , all of which were very good dishes  indeed . 

Food : Continental meets Mughlai seems appropriate . ¬†Since ours was a big group of 8 we had numerous items . From the Coq - Au - Vin , Murg Zarka Kebab , Murg Reshmi malai kebab , Lucknowi Dum Biriyani ¬†, to the Haka Garlic noodles & the Pork Belly . Every item was well made , I mean extremely well made . But special mentions go out to Both the kebabs we had . I've never had Kebabs that creamy and that unique in taste . I guess only Oudh 1590's Galawati kebab would come close in comparison. If given a choice i would eat them all day long.¬†
Another two Big hits were the Coq- Au - Vin & the Pork Belly Entree. ¬†Although the quantity was questionable ¬†, but it was so tasty that i'm short for words and this coming from someone who is a continental Cuisine maniac .. ¬†Oh the sheer creaminess of it all . ¬†You'll have to excuse me if i'm talking like a 5 year old high on Sugar !! But it was that good . I'm coming back here for sure no questions asked . I'm not even going ¬†to mention the Biriyani because it wasn't over the top excellent like the other four dishes . At the end we did order some Orange mocktail of sorts which by the way was top notch as well . A very satisfying experience overall .¬†

Cost for 2 : 1400 /- plus

Final conclusion : All throughout the meal , you'll really get the sense that they have done justice to their name " SPICEKRAFT " . Utilizing Spices is certainly an art and they have certainly mastered this art as per they dishes they have on the roster .. An absolute recommendation from me if you want to indulge your palate in something unique and genuinely great

I found some people mentioning that this restaurant is over hyped.
What I felt, being a first timer to this restaurant, hype is obvious.
I went today along with my wife. We ordered: Fresh lime soda, cucumber cooler, Dejaj charmouli, Beer can fish tempura, devils crab, chicken stroganoff, mutton biryani, jack Daniels mousse.
Item names could mismatch as couldn't recall the names exactly.
Quantity was sufficient. We had to pack the biryani.
Service was good.
Starters were superb. Chicken stroganoff was a bit bland. We didn't like it much.
Wish to visit again.

We landed here on the 7th January after checking the Zomato rating & on the lookout for some molecular gastronomy. 

The premises nor the surroundings are very premier nor exude a special
Ambience. But the food ....oh the food is to die for. We decided to do just drinks and snack/ starters. 

So five of us on double blacks and a progression of starters - devilled crabs, dajaj Chermoula, lymnm Samak (they DO love the Arab names), red pepper prawns & pork ribs burra kabab. We ended with their signature JD chocolate mousse. 

Ummmm....a tour de force. Each dish barring the chicken had a very unlikely European/ Lebanese base preparation with Indian trappings (!) to close bringing about a really pleasant twist. This is a powerhouse and kolkata cuisine is moving ahead of the usual suspects after a long while. 

The owner is a young gentlemen who learned his chops in London and has put his experience to rather good use. 

We should be most certainly coming back when in Kolkata again. It's been lovely üëå

This place was in my bucket list for a long long time so I decided to hit this place today with my friends.

The place is beautifully decorated the interiors are stunning so are the chairs and the tables. Its quite a big place and has nice interiors and well designed arts. Which is quite catchy. The truck on the table looks great too.

The waiters are well mannered and courtesious. So is the chef of the house. He indicated us and helped us to choose from the menu which was quite difficult for us to figure out what to have in the first place.

We ordered
Drinks in the beginning

Margarita Tequila + Cointreau + Lime Juice which wad much of a cold drink taste not tgat alcoholic.

Retminator was a big Stunner with Heineken Beer mixed with Tequila and Cointreau. It was a real deal.

In the Starters we ordered
Beer Can Tempura Fish whichbwas really good in taste.

Main Course we ordered Indian food

Hari Moti Polao which came with plain white rice and lots of peas bland in taste.
Murgh Kadhai Kassa which was tangy and spicy both. We loved it

In the end we ordered The Jack Daniels Mousse alcoholic dessert. Stunner. Absolute Stunner.

This place is a must visit.

After seeing the reviews on Zomato, we planned to go for dinner. The place is really close to my house so My laziness too gave way. The food here is not what the reviews say. The drinks here are really cheap and one will be interested to only come to drink here. Not eat. So we asked the chef to recommend whats fit for vegetarians here. And what he suggested was terrible. Its was potato overloaded. Altho the gravy was not bad. Main course was really really spicy. Black pepper everywhere and on everything. I filled my stomach drinking water because it was so spicy. If I do come back next time, it will be to drink. Not worth it for the food. At all.

It's not worth of going more than once. You thoroughly need to review before you go.
Ambience is undoubtedly awesome. Serves your dishes beautifully.concept wise nice..But once you come to the taste it's very average.tge chapatis were so sweet...Fish items are tastier.
So.may be a one time visit for me

Visited there a month ago in ¬†December with my friends. ¬†Jumping to the food later, the ambiance was very pleasant. ¬†They adjusted their AC for us since it was bit cold. Finally they offered us to shift to another table away form the AC. ¬†Staffs were very courteous. ¬†One of them helped us to decide the main course. ¬†For starters we ordered ¬†those Zomato recommended dishes Dajaj Charmoula and Beer can Tempura Fish. ¬†Both of them were mouth watering and ¬†delicious. ¬†Quantity was good. ¬†We ordered Zaffrani Sheermal and Laal Maas . The ¬†Laal Maas was my favorite since am a mutton lover. It was cooked with a perfect balance of spices and gravy , overall it was very soft and tender. ¬†The Prawn in Fragrant Coriander Sauce ¬†with very simple yet tasty combination of their fried rice is worth the mention. ¬†My friend being in favor of prawns ¬†had a very good time enjoying the prawn dish, she was the one who recommended Spice Kraft. ¬†Couldn't taste the dessert , so planning to revisit soon and enjoy the drinks and desserts .  Revisited in Choturthi eve with my buddies. Nothing to add cos this place amazes me everytime I go there. LIIT was strong and well flavoured.

If you want to give your taste buds an orgasmic feeling, try this place. Added feature- the chef would come down to you and explain the recipe of what you are eating. Perfect food-lovers' zone.

Got a wonderful lunch and pampering in terms of food from the team of spice kraft. In one word it is just fabulous in terms of management, food quality, ambiance, hospitality. The got a vary wide range o menu and the fusion dishes just makes star about the restaurant. Food is that much tasty like it can cherish and lit up your taste buds.
We ordered 
#dajaj charmula: one of their signature dish, chicken           was tender and tasty and the sauce they provided was sweet which makes a chatpata combination.

#bacardi lime infused chicken tandoori sausages: again mind blowing. When you dip that sausages in given sauce it will just blow your mind out. And if you're a foodie then you can also guess the combination of spices.

#chicken reshmi malai kabab: mouth watering soft and tender checken with sigri flavour and the flow of malai. Just yum!

#mixed fried rice: again a good item with a proper quantity of veggies and non-veg things, not so dry, not so rich 

#chicken manchurian: goes well with fried rice, thick sauce with proper ingredients 

#100% jack Daniel mousse: another star dish that is still swimming in my taste buds.

If you want to taste then please don't judge by it's price just go and have a try. Staffs were coordinating with us and also answered our queries, suggested us and also recited the total process of their signature dishes.

Service & Food, totally create a vortex. Highly recommended. Don't think about the price tag, just go for it. Display, preparation, taste are so far one the best I've experienced so far.

A place cant get any better..starting from the ambience the moment u step in to the dimly lit interiors with amazing furnishing..and yes the music..that plays just sets the perfect mood..went there for the second time on my birthday..the mocktails nd cocktails were suggested perfectly by the manager..of which the hazelnut cocktail tasted amazing..something i look forwrd to having again when i go back ..the lime grass infused mocktail was amazing as well..and yes the drinks r priced just correctly..that doesnt poke a hole in ur pockets.. The dajaj chickn is the best chickn dish i have tasted ..and so is the beer can tempura fish..its soo good that my friend who doesnt have fish just ordered it the second time instead of a maincourse! :D
Coming to the main course we had mint pulao which had an amazing aroma and tasted really good..and was enuf in quantity to fill up 3..
The maharastrian chickn and another chicken dish tasted really good..and d burst of flavours were innovative.. And didnt taste like the same old boring indian food like other places..
And as the person came to clear up the table..dre came a surprise for me.. D spicekraft team gifted me with a dessert for my birthday..which was montecarlo and tasted heavenly..this small token made the day even more special..and such hospitality really keeps up the crowd for sure! :) 
In all it was really a pleasant experience.. And look forward to visit some time soon..

This little restro on hazra road one of the most crowded area is one amazing place to have silent dinners or just a meetup for date it's cozy nice ambience and some amazing mixture of dishes they serve. I started with Mac and cheese burger with crab cake in between it amzing stuff you can check the pictures as well. Then i ordered one of there best dishes beer can tempura which they serve with basil and spice. Desserts have some amazing innovation I tried 100% Jack Daniels moose it was amazing and I tasted like Jack Daniels and don't forget the mocktails I am addicted to Virgin mojito so tried here too and it was good.

A place which is really overhyped. I went on a weekday for lunch. the place looked packed. we were made to sit on a table bit we were not very confortable  so i requested  the manager for a change of table...he said he will arrange in so.e time which he conveniently forgot. i would have pardoned it but to my horror he offered us a change of place  after i cleared the bill. What hospitality. 
coming to the food...i ordered for 
#lobster thermidor. Presentation was just about ok but it tasted good.
The starter was accopnaied wity drinks namely
#Tangerita- It was nice. Good. 
#rainbow- good again
#chicken in oyster sauce with mushroom- decent
#mixed hakka noodles- good again. 

when asked for the dessert options and menu the server sent another server. he refused to give the menu and started suggesting desserts. Mind you the suggestions were unclear so we didnt order only. 
There was food fallen on my table after the starters and some tissue papers kept. The cleaning guy did not clean that. 
Food might have been good but overall the service amd hospitality that i expected from a restaurant of this stature in terms of zomato ranking was missing.
Disappointing.

This is a new and upcoming restaurant in Kolkata, perfectly located on Hazra Road. The exterior will not give you the idea that this place can be become a gastronomic experience. But once you are inside and flipping their collection of food as well as cocktail you will be definitely excited. Moreover the price is not exorbitantly cost. Do try some of their signature cocktails and of course the boozart of Jack daniels Mousse and Bacardi infused chicken sausages. Recommendation for cocktails : Jamun Merry, milk maid chaitini.

So, a auto from Jatin Das Park Metro station will make you reach to this destination in five minutes and after that it feels like heaven.The welcoming is excellent. Starting from the large variety of cocktails and mocktails ,to the starters and then the delicious main course ending with the lovely desert, Jack Daniels mousse. You should definitely pay a visit to this place. :)

In very rare situations a restaurant can be given a 5.Spice Kraft deserves this full marks as it ticks all the boxes that's required in hospitality industry to attain perfection.Service, hospitality, ambience and most importantly FOOD AND DRINKS..Spice Kraft scores in all.It lives upto it's name because there's touch of creativity in decor and food.Inspite of being just 11 months old they are already one of the best fine dining restaurants in town at an affordable price.

I came here with a friend last night for dinner.The moment we stepped in we were mesmerised by the ambience of this place.The lighting,artwork on the walls and I loved the collection of wine being showcased in the section we sat in.They have separate sections for family, couples and stags.
Mr. Sambit and Mr. Vimal were amazing hosts to us and ensured that we have a great time to remember.

We started off with few drinks.

~Mocktails~

‚Ä¢Cucumber cooler
‚Ä¢Tangarita

Since my friend doesn't drink alcohol she opted for these.I tried few sips of these.Both of the drinks were quite refreshing.

~Cocktails~

‚Ä¢Milkmaid chaitini- Its a drink inspired from cutting chai with addition of vodka.The drink is sweetened with milkmaid.It was a sinful bliss.

‚Ä¢Kokum rita- A cocktail with an oomph indeed! It was margarita with a twist from Kokum-a tropical fruit from south and spiked with chef's secret spices.Its completely different from the typical cocktails we are used to.This was my drink of the night!

Usually Asian cuisines is synonymous with oriental delicacies from China,Japan,Thailand,Vietnam.We were delighted to find Lebanese cuisine in Treasures of Asia section here.So we went for taste of Lebanon in starters.

‚Ä¢Lymwn Semak- These were grilled fish flavoured with lemon.Fish was soft,flaky with tanginess from lemon.The dip served was made hummus, olives, dash of lime and a pinch of salt.Presence of each component can be tasted.A sublime start to the meal.

‚Ä¢Dajaj chermoula- Grilled chicken legs were presented in small vessels.Here they first cook the chicken by sous-vide method which helps to keep it moist from with and melts the fibre on the meat.That is the reason behind the tenderness of the kebab.
Thereafter it's grilled which is the reason behind the amazing crispy skin on top.The dip served with it was unique.It had roasted garlic,mayo and few other components which I can't remember.But it had quite a depth of flavour.Loved this dish.

‚Ä¢Bacardi Limon infused tandoori chicken sausages- We drifted towards this continental dish because of its uniqueness.These were herb grilled sausages infused with Lemon flavoured white rum.Small droppers containing white rum were inserted into the sausages.The alcohol cut through the spiciness of the sausages nicely.It was served with a coulis made from blueberry and churan.It was insanely good! Fusion food at its best!

For the mains we had

‚Ä¢Lobster thermidor- Lobster meat cooked in cheese and white wine reduction was served within the shell alongside rice and veggies. Being an ardent seafood lover this was a sheer bliss for me.They took the best product and it was respected. The crustacean was cooked to perfection.Flavour of cheese didn't overpower the delicate subtlety of the lobster meat.

‚Ä¢Roasted chicken with orange sauce- Chicken was roasted nicely and I loved it with the tangy orange sauce.The mash underneath was silky smooth and nicely seasoned.Loved the fact they took care of the chicken and sauce which are the stars of the dish yet didn't overlook the mash.

We opted for a boozert for the final course(dessert containing alcohol) which ended our meal on a high note.

‚Ä¢100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss chocolate mousse with drunken petit fours- The dessert looked so elegant. 2 portions of mousse was served which was rich in flavour of premium chocolate and Jack Daniels.It was airy,light & had a distinct alcohol flavour.Petit fours were vanilla sponge cakes soaked in cointreu.It was a well balanced dish of sweetness from chocolate cut by bitterness from the Tennessee whiskey bound together by the tang which came from use of orange liqueur.

Each and every dish of food and glass of beverage showed the passion for cooking in the chef.What we were served did not only satisfy our tastebuds to the fullest but also did tantalise our sense of vision.It was magic created by combination of fantastic food with masterstroke of the artist in chef.This place is definitely recommended!

Went with my boy friend to celebrate his birthday! 1stly as i resquested, the manager had cooperated so well by arranging all his staffs to wish him...which really felt so nice, behaviour of every1 is so humble that u feel like visiting again. Lets come to food..well ¬†had -¬†
1. Beer can tempura fish : it was more like fish batter fry...which was well cooked, d orange spicy dip needs a special mention.¬†
2. Dajaj Chermoula : wow....succulent chicken again with an awesome yogart dip with some ginger twist!
3. Devil's Crab meat : soft, creamy crabmeat that melts in mouth¬†
4. 100% Jack Daniel & swiss chocolate mousse with petit four : ¬†All whiskey lovers will feel heavenly having it.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Brilliant fusion foods with good presentation! Music was soothing... they even describe u d making process of each dish. There are three seperate zones inside- outer couple zone, inner stag zone and the third one is inner family zone. One suggestion is excahnge the family zone with couple zone because i believe the reason u people have seperated the zones will justify more when families dont have to cross the couple zone and get inside. Rather the couple zone should be inner and private one!

What a very different menu! We wanted to go here just to see how the food is reading the names on the menu! Most prominent was The beer battered fish which was very good. Rest of the drinks and food was also very tasty though slightly overpriced for the quantity given. Would like to try different items the next time.

Been here few months back. Planning to go again. Looks very expensive from outside. But very reasonable if you can walk inside. Quality and quantity of food is great with respect to the cost. Approx 2000rs for two including drinks.

They have wide range of wine collection and cocktails are the best. At times you  might be lucky to get 2:1 offer on cocktails. Will certainly visit again within next few weeks.

Disappointed. I was so eagerly waiting to visit this place. Went there in the evening when there were no other customers. Still they could not take correct orders. We ordered two starters (dajaj charmoula & beer batter fish), they served one item within 15 mins. We ordered other dishes (devilled crab & Bacardi chicken sausage), still waiting for our second starter. Then we realized they haven't taken the order. We also wanted to order beer but they have only one variety of beer. Wow!! The ambience is really welcoming, but the food is too expensive & quantity is very less. Yes, they have a menu with a range of interesting dishes which is really incredible.

This is a great addition to the Kolkata restaurant scene I feel. Although I would have to go back more times to try more of their stuff, the food we ordered came out pretty good. The dajaj chermoula needs a special mention. Besides this, the hunan fish, the devilfish crab meat (guess thats how its called) were also pretty good. For dessert I tried the jack daniels chocolate mousse which was decent. Worth paying a visit.

WANT TO TRY GLOBAL CUISINE THIS SHOULD BE THE PLACE TO DROP IN !!!!!üòçüòçüòçüòç
An awesome experience last night (4th jan 2017).
When I enter the ambiance soothes u. Interior is nicely done which is going to give u a feeling of the fine dining experience. Low light, mirrors, blue lights.its simple yet effective.
The BEST part of this place is u get FOOD IN WHICH A LOT OF THOUGHT HAS BEEN PUT IN. Food is UNIQUE in TASTE and the FUSIONS are worth a try .
Staff is very helpful.
Spacious place with sitting arrangement divided in three sections
Coming to food :
1. Milkmaid chaitini : milkmaid tasting martini . Every sip u get that hint of milkmaid
2. Cocumsaar : a drink make with cocum brought from Mumbai. Sweet and tangy.
3. The jamun marry : concept of bloody marry made with jamun and churan. Yum. It's spicy.
4. Beer can tempura fish : tampura flour which comes all the way from.japan made into a batter with beer and fish fillets fried in that. Comes with a tangy orange dip.
4. Djaja courmola : chicken in labenese spices grilled to perfection.
5. Devil's crab : crab meat and cheese. One can't suffice your heart.
6. Coq-auv-in: chicken and mushroom made with red wine served with rice . A MUSY TRY !
7. Fish wellington : bhetki and mushroom baked with cheese and rice .
8. Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce : 2 large fillets of bhekti served with rice and boiled veggie.
9. 100% jack Daniels mousse: üëçüëçüëçüëç

Well this place will surely whet your appetite with its preparations.
It was very easy to find the location as it's just near Hazra law college.
The restaurant is soberly decorated with dim lights and beautiful artwork.
Food served here deserves a special mention since all the items were amazingly innovative and delicious too.
Thumbs up for their prompt service :)
We had ordered -
‚óΩMilk maid chaitini which was so unique prepared with thick milkmaid cream along with cutting chai flavour & vodka üëç
‚óΩKokum Rita , an unforgettable drink with an exotic taste of Kokumsaar(that you'll find only in India) ,Tequila n chataka spices.@
‚óΩJamun mary was quite high in it's taste blended with shocking kala jamun juice.
‚óΩBeer tempura fish was ao gooey and delicious. A must try!!
‚óΩBaked fish & grilled fish with lemon sauce were alluring plus amazing! Highly recommended.
‚óΩDajaj chermoula was perfectly grilled and tasted just too good.
‚óΩDevilled crab meat was SINFUL. The most hearty n tasty starter ever üëçüëçüëç
We ended our dinner with their signature dessert i.e. 100% Jack Daniels mousse that left me bewitched! Superb on a wholeüëå

This place 'Spice Kraft' located near the Hazra Law College it is one of the most professional restaurants I've been to.. went with 2 of my friends..
It was quite spacious divided into 2 areas.. the ambience is cosy.. the interiors are mind blowing having spice trucks on each table .. subtle lighting .. a glass wall displaying their wine collection!

I was quite blown away with their range of cocktails!
We tried :
Jamun Mary.. which was kala jamun juice muddled with churan.. an amazing taste !

Milk maid Chaitini was another creative mocktail .. which had thick milk maid cream together with masala cutting chai of Mumbai and vodka.. this was quite high..

Another amazing cocktail was cocumsaar which was brilliant! Loved every sip of it!

The food is damn delicious, creative and innovative..

We ordered their signature beer can tempura fish which had fresh tender fish coated in crunchy batter.. it was served v hot and tasted perfect!

Dajaj Charmoula.. which was with chicken drumsticks served in small earthen cups with sour cream! The chicken tasted delicious.. each bite was brilliant!

Devil Crab.. Crab meat baked with spices and cheese.. this was served on the crab shell.. beautiful presentation and taste! Very Flavourful.. these type of crab dishes you don't find easily.. and I must say it was much better than that of Mocambo at park Street !

Coq Au Vin which is their 16th century French Delicacy of Raost Chicken in Red Wine with mushrooms served with parsley butter rice.. this was a great platter ..Loved the presentation of this .. for all foodies this come as a big treat!

Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce.. which had fillets of bhetki .. this was so satisfying meal.. served with buttered rice.. this platter was also amazing!

Baked fish Wellington.. which was bhetki served with mushroom in cheese sauce served with rice.. cooked with flavors of saffron.. the fish was again fresh and tasted authentic!

For the dessert we tried .. their signature dish 100% Jack Daniels Mousse served with Sponge cake .. alcoholic taste.. it deserves alot of praise ..As it left such an impression on me which I'll never forget!
We had a fine dining experience at a very affordable price..
The stewards are well mannered and they were v attentive ..
Spice Kraft .. was such a surprise to me, a sudden plan made me so happy and this place is positively a worth visit!
Highly Recommended!

Okay so, first thing. I went to have lunch here on 31st December afternoon. After reading all the reviews, I was majorly disappointed. Maybe it was a bad experience because of the date I chose to go there on.

We waited 20mins for a table. We didn't quite like what was on their special menu other than the staple soy based drums of heaven ,so the waiter suggested us dishes from their main menu. We ordered a chicken stroganoff and a ham steak. The food took forever to arrive.
We had ordered mojitos to go along. 
The drums of heaven was decent. The soy sauce a little spicy. The ham steak and brown sauce was ordinary. What I really loved however was the stroganoff served with garlic bread. 
Most groups around us were having this funny dish that had batter fried chicken served with something in a beer can. The reviews tell me its called Beer can tempura chicken. Must try it on my next visit. Looking forward to have a better experience.

If you are looking for some of the best global cuisine dishes, Spice Kraft is the ultimate place. I must take few names of the dishes I have personally liked - sausage with bacardi linon droppers, shepherds pie, beer can tempura fish, dajaj chermoula and many more.. If you are up to tingle your taste buds, SK is the place. The service, the ambiance, the music is completely awesome..... A MUST VISIT PLACE

Location : Hazra Road. If you're coming from Gariahat side, take the very First left from Ballygunge Phari, go ahead a little and you'll find this restaurant on your left.

So, I finally checked this restaurant off my wish list and met the man I wanted to meet for so long. I had been reading in magazines and newspapers about this man and today I got to meet him. Chef Sambit who owns Spice Kraft is a gem of a person. From the way he explains each and every dish to everyone to the way he takes care of his guests whilst managing the kitchen, he excels in every department. Went there with Rakesh Saha¬† and had one of the best evenings ever!

D√©cor & Ambience : The restaurant is divided into¬†3 major sections.¬†The D√©cor is pretty straightforward and minimalistic, yet classy. The seating is extremely comfortable and cosy. Light music in the background and the¬†placement of lights¬†lends this place a very peaceful air.

We asked him to suggest us and all of them were unbelievably good.

Cocktails :

* The terminator : This was a beer based cocktail. The presentation is pretty dope! A Heiniken beer bottle, upside down,¬†inserted inside a mug is served. As you drink, the beer gets emptied from the bottle and mixes with the countraeu and tequilla and the strong flavor and bitterness of the beer mellows out. The concoction is superb. One word : Exquisite.

* Painkiller : My friend has this and he liked it a lot. So, full marks in beverage department.

Food :

* Roast Turkey Pantheras, mozzarella and pineapple mousse and basil pesto : This is part of their new Anglo Indian menu for Christmas and New year. Panthera is sort of a spring roll but texture-wise and taste-wise far better than a Chinese spring roll. The exterior was crunchy and awesome. The filling of roasted turkey was absolutely Yum! Turkey is a very fibrous meat, and to sort of roasting it slow and long and then blending in with the other ingredients makes it incredibly delicious. The filling was smooth, albeit retained a certain texture. The dip was amazing as well.

* Dajaj Charmoule : This is a Lebanon delicacy and was served rather interestingly inside what looked like mini drums. Charmoule is a Lebanese spice mix : Cumin, coriander, allspice, cinnamon¬†being the dominating flavours. The chicken is marinated with this chermoule spice mix and grilled over charcoal. Tasted SO GOOD! The accompanying dip complemented it so well.

* Beer Can Tempura Fish served with orange ponzu tartare¬†: This is one of their most famous dishes. Big fillets of fish,batter fried, inserted in a beer can was served. This dish was flawless. The fish was lovely, moist and flaky. The batter was so light and the beer made it extra airy and fluffy. The orange ponzu tartare sauce was brilliant! I love how they serve a differnet dipping sauce with different dishes.

*Baked Fish Wellington : Kolkata's humble 'bhetki' much gets a whole new British twist and has been executed superbly. Two huge chunks ( read : fillets) of beckti fish, baked in cheesy mushroom sauce was served with saffron pilaf. The fish was soo good. The sauce was extremely well done. The fish was baked to perfection. The white pilaf was amazing, had a sweet almost a nutty flavour. I loved this dish!

* Shepherd's pie : This is the most British one can get : a good ol' shepherd's pie. 2 small ramikins of shepherd's pie were served with a handful of butter garlic bread. The first thing that strikes is the shiny surface of the pie. The minced lamb stew is covered with a layer of mashed potatoes and baked with¬† butter on top. The butter gives it a lovely charred edges as well as a thin sort of crust. The Lamb was cooked beautifully and flavor-wise was spot on. The crispy garlic bread was the best accompaniment to this wonderful dish.

*Jack Daniel's mousse : I absolutely loved the presentation of this dessert. 2 scoops of chocolate mousse was served with 4¬†round pieces¬†of¬†Cointreau soaked¬†sponge cakes and a thin stroke of mango jelly. The mousse is airy and light. You can actually taste the whiskey in it. The sponge cakes were beautifully done and are a sharp textural contrast to the mousse. The Mango jelly cuts through the heavy flavor of the alcohol & the richness of the chocolate and lightens the whole dish up. This dessert is a masterpiece!

Service : Impeccable. Staff is extremely courteous and attentive.¬†

Once again, hats off to Mr Sambit Banik. This sure bags a Recommendation from me!

Spice Kraft : take a bow!

If you are Sheldon Cooper ...I wouldn't recommend the place.. But as a foodie.. It would be unfair of me to tell you not to go. This is a place you could get addicted to. Specially the Jack Daniel's Mousse

Even though it looks cheeky on the outside.. but has a plausible interior done. The service staff are divided..the completely useless...Better as bus boys to fine dining manager. Everything however tastes great and looks appetizing. 

Order Highlights:

Kele ke Phool ke Monsieur Amchoor and Ginger Creme Fraiche: Highly recommended by the manager. He was so adamant that we try it that he challenged us that if we wouldn't like the preparation he would take it right back without charging a penny. I finished the whole plate. 

Jack Daniel Mousse: A bitter to sweet mousse. A wishing it never finishes experience. 

Rating : 

Food : 4

Ambiance: 3.5

Service: 2.5

When you mix something with art, magic starts happening there, and when it comes to food the magic not only excites your eyes but also your taste buds. Spice Kraft at Ballygunge is a place where I found the mix of Art and Food. Good interiors, excellent service and most importantly what sets Spice Kraft apart from others is its food.

Heard a lot about the place on media and then decided to go there. It is not a very spacious restaurant and is quite dark inside. The server recommended a lebanese chicken starter which tasted quite bland. The other food items and thr dessert was just ordinary. Not a must visit place at all.

It's a must visit place. Such nice food at such affordable price. We tried the famous 'Dajaj Chermoula' and 'Beer Can Tempura Fish' and both were lip smacking. Main Course was good too. Wanted to try their famous Jack Daniels Swiss Chocolate Mousse for desert, but since it wasn't available, we opted for 'Monte Carlo' and it was nice.

This is a long due review of this lovely place.
Location:Opposite Hazra law college & you've to walk for 2minutes.

We went there on a Sat evening & had to wait for almost 1/2 hour before we were given a place.
But the wait was worth it & we understood it as soon as we entered.Dimly lit,the 2 seaters here are unlike most of the places the best to enjoy your privacy & meal.I also loved the decor with mirrors playing a major part.
We ordered:Long island iced tea which was mixed gently(not that strong) but we liked it nevertheless & also white rum with warm water.
Food:The famous beer can tempura fish lived upto its fame.crunchy outside & tender fish inside that's what it is but the speciality lies in the batter where they use beer.The presentation was superb, served in a beer can.
Next we ordered the hyderabadi mutton kibbeh which was basically stuffed mutton keema & it was okayish. Next we went for spaghetti aglio olio pasta which was also made nicely but nothing special.
Overall we liked the ambience, food & service & plan to visit again.

Excellent new joint for people who love continental food... we orderee beer battered fingers (a must try) and they were absolutely yummy. A must try! 

For mains we ordered:
1. Chicken item - a little more chicken and less of mushrooms would have made out experience a delight, the butter rice served was excellent
2. Lemon butter fish - good
3. Shepherd's pie - excellent and a must try
4. Pork item ordered from Christmas special menu - super

Overall a very cosy place with divine food. A little more quantity in the portions would make it easy on the pocket and better Value for Money

This place has some astounding decor , and the service of the waiter are really mention worthy. The food are well priced and the drinks were damn good. We ordered Dajaj Charmoula, Nasi Goreng and shredded lamb in masaman curry. They were pretty good. It's good to see them taking constant feedbacks on every thing.

The rating should have been 4.5, but unfortunately we had an unwanted extra layer of skin in a piece of Dajaj. The Nasi Goreng could also have been slightly better.

Excellent hospitality. Go by the server's recommendations. Since I wasn't in a state to drink anything cold because of a bad cough, the server got me a special brandy toddy drink which was not even on the menu. And it was damn good!  Had their famous Shepherd pie, beer can tempura fish, 100% Jack Daniels from the boozert section amongst other things. They were very good.
One suggestion - avoid the octopus.

Ambience is good, it's a family restaurant. Wide selection of food and drinks. All in all, good experience.

The place is awesome. Our visit to Spice Kraft was not pre-planned and when we finally decided we're going to Spice Kraft, we didn't expect it to be so awesome. First of all, the best part about this place is the ambience which I'm very particular about. Secondly, the food was delicious. We followed suggestions and really u should totally go with the suggestions. We had beer can tempura fish, green chilly chicken, pork ribs burrah kabab and we took a classic monte carlo and a virgin mojito. Tempura can fish and green chilly chicken are the tastiest things I've ever had. The classic monte carlo had chocolate sauce all over it, even outside the glass. What else can u ask for? I've had better mojito though. Someone in there had birthday, so we got a piece of the chocolate cake too. The staff in there are very well behaved. Some people were complaining about the quantity, however, I would like to disagree. There's a lot we haven't explored yet. I'd definitely like to visit again and try them all, specially the drinks, seafood and the continental dishes.

Spice Kraft is the best example of awesome delicious wholesome food served at very reasonable prices. In today's era where most restaurants are giving importance to presentation of dishes more than the food itself, Spice Kraft creates a perfect balance. It serves delicious wholesome soul food with fantastic presentation. We ordered Spare ribs barrah, fish wrapped in paper, Chilly Mushrooms and Paneer Tikka. Each dish was very tasty and had a character of its own. The main course I got my Coq Au Vin, a traditional continental Chicken dish which you seldom find in todays world which left me delighted. ¬†Other dishes which came at the table were Safed Dal Muradabadi, Mutton Rara, Palak Paneer and Nans. The Dal was as authentic as it can get. Too stuffer with all the food we couldnt order dessert.¬†
To top the great food they also have crazy offers on Alcohol and fab cocktails. Amazing discovery!! Definately going back when I am next in Cal oooooooops Kol!!

Went there for my boyfriend's b'day lunch. Though@ we were a bit undecided about the place at first, the moment we went in, we were captivated. Extremely courteous staff, cozy interiors and extremely reasonable price. Coming to food, we had ordered a flavoured absolut (mandarin) and J. W. Red label first. On asking the staff about starters to complement with the drinks, they suggested dajaj charmoula. To say it was a good dish will be an understatement. Next we ordered pork ribs burrah kabab which is the best pork kabab I have had till date: juicy yet crisp, wonderful meddling of flavours. For main course we shared Coq-au-vin(suggested as well) which is a delicate chicken dish served with rice. Not to mention the complementary dessert we had for it being his birthday. Lastly, i knw their tagline is the art of good food and I will say that they really do know the art!!! I would definitely go to this place again and again.

After much brainstorming we zeroed in on this place to check out and had a marvellous experience. The ambience was good and the location easy to find. Though we had a little issue with the staff about sitting at a specific table, I can overlook that. Coming to the food, the starters were exotic. The main course swept us off the floor, especially the Mandarin Fish with Chicken. Honestly the chinese delicacies were way better than the Indian, but I wasn't complaining. The boozerts hit the right spot at the end.

An awesome place located near hazra law college opposite quadra laboratory to hangout with friends(though I went with my mom). We tried their continental food--- shepherd's pie as starter, lobster thermidor as main course and jack daniels mousse as dessert. I have never tried such a unique dessert ever. Each food was excellent. Staffs were also very cordial. Next time going to try their asian section.

I visited with a friend first time on recommendation from a friend. Once reached found that it was already crowded by 8:00 PM. We had to wait for around 30 minutes. All the waiting and the visit was worth the food. Loved the food. The Nasi Goreng was an experiment and I recommend to have it. The Green Chilly chicken was almost a good partner with the Nasi Goreng. The staff behavior was good along with the service. Did not tried liquor or mocktails but would love to visit the place again for the lovely ambiance, food and reasonable price.¬†

The one good reason is the price of the drinks. Definitely reasonable. Although i only ordered a snack to go with the drinks, it was delicious.

Coming to the service, the servers were really hospitable, warm and polite. Everyone should try this place. ‚ò∫

Went there to celebrate the birthday of my partner. One thing about this place is you need to fo your reservation even if you plan to go on a weekday. A nice place right there on Hazra Road and decorated with wine bottles. There are three seating areas. You should try avoiding the one with blue neon lights. We ordered sangria and tempura fish in beer can. Tge sangria was served excessively chilled. Though it tasted pretty good, but Sangria is not meant to be served so chilled. The tempura fish in beer can was good. The orange dip along with it was amazing. A must have when you go there. The main course was just about okay. Since it was my partner's birthday they provided a complimentary dessert. Now we had to mention about it thrice before they got us the same . That was actually awkward. The personal touch was missing I felt. All the restaurants of their stature make it a point to make the birthday/ anniversary guests feel special. And the dessert served didnt seem fresh at all. The mouse was smelling. We didnot create a ruckus about it and paid the bill and left. The ending just left a bitter taste in our mouth. Just a suggestion guys, if you do not want to provide a complimentary dish you can be specific and candid about it...but if you do just do not be so careless and lackadaisical about it. We could have rather ordered a better one for ourselves. These days actually mean a lot to the person concerned. As for the pricing, its just okay. Not low and not very high. Almost a value for money. The waiters could do a bit more homework. Was expecting much more out of you since it was a recommendation.

On 9th of December, 2016, we went to Spice kraft to enjoy my husband's birthday dinner. We made a mistake at the first place. Don't get me wrong here. We chose the right place to dine, but we forgot to reserve a table for two of us. As a result we had to wait for 45 or more minutes to get a table.
First thing that I noted about this place was the decoration with liquor bottles. The ambiance was very good, dimly lighted, cosy and apt for a bar cum restaurant. The second and one of the significant things I pointed out was about their service. The service was very slow. I could have enjoyed it if I had enough time to read every specification about the menu. But, unfortunately (read fortunately!), we have Zomato to do that now-a-days and also we had to wait 45 minutes to get a table. By the time, we were too hungry to wait for another 45 minutes to provide the order. Anyway, let me dig into the most significant part that led me to give Spice Kraft the 4.5 rating. The Food ! 

Starter:
-------
1. Beer can Tempura fish, Orange Ponzu Tartare - Six strips of battered and then fried fish were served in a beer can. First time, I saw such kind of plating which I found to be unique and good. Fish fillets were thinly battered. Each strip was full of fish. The dip that was served with it was made with orange. It had a refreshing taste and it went really well with the fish. This dish is a must try in Spice Kraft. I just loved this one. 

2. Dajaj Charmoule - This is a dish inspired from Lebanon. It is a famous starter here in Spice Kraft. Four pieces of Chicken lollypops were rubbed with nice and aromatic spices and then char-grilled. Chicken pieces were soft, moist and perfectly cooked. Each chicken piece was placed into a cup along with one piece of cucumber slice. One burnt garlic curd dip was served with this. This was really nice and another must have dish here.

Main course:
-------------
Shepherd's Pie -¬† This old British classic came in two small cups along with some garlic bread strips. It tasted supremely. The potato mash was smooth and buttery. The lightly spiced minced lamb underneath was heavenly. I always wanted to taste this dish at a very good place and thankfully I have found such a place. Earlier I had Shepherd's pie at another place which was the worst food experience I had ever have. I do not want to name that place. It made me frightened to have Shepherd's pie anywhere else. But, then Spice Kraft made me free from that disappointment. Thanks for that. It is another must have dish here. 

Dessert or Boozert:
------------------
We went for the obvious choice which is 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse. The Mousse came along with four pieces of soft sponge cakes and one orange toffy reduction. The plating was stunning and combined with two heart shaped spoons which I found romantic. The texture of the mousse was nice and the sense of jack Daniel was truly awesome. One thing which I did not like about this dessert was the pieces of the sponge cakes. Those sponge cakes were way too sweet for my taste buds. 

Overall, 45 minutes of waiting was worth for such a nice three-course dinner. It costed us about 1200 INR which was fine according to me. 

One visit is not enough for this place. I need to visit multiple times here to taste each one of their dishes. 
After a very long time, I got such a restaurant that can be visited repeatedly.

0.5 point is just because of their slow service. I wish that I could increase 0.25 points more for this place in Zomato for the warm and graceful behavior of the staffs of Spice Kraft! The chef personally came to know about our experience of the food. The person who was serving the food, was trying to explain the dishes. At the end, they apologized for making us wait for 45 minutes. These attempts impressed me a lot. 
I am sure that I shall visit this place again very soon.
********************************************

So, as decided, on 25th December 2016, we again visited SpiceKraft. This time, they had limited number of dishes in the menu. When we asked for the molecular mock tails, they said that it would take huge time to prepare. This was quite not expected. We had a high hope from this place based on our first visit. Anyway, we ordered Beer battered fish fry again! 
Also, we had :
Bacardi infused sausage¬† - Good presentation, but not that much impressive according to my taste buds.
Coq-Au-vin- Good in taste, less in portion. To be specific, it was mostly full with mushrooms instead of chicken which should be the king of the plate. 
We ordered two mock tails : Some Rainbow mocktail and one Basil lemon based mocktail. Those were looking really nice, tasted moderately. 
Overall, this time we had a good time as it was the Christmas of the year though we expected more from SpiceKraft.

Good place to hangout.  They have offers on alcohols which are worth a try out. Beer batter tambura fish is mouth watering.  Even their biryani is good. It just gives us a idea about their wide variety

I went there with my friends for dinner and it was good that we had a reservation, for it was so crowded, and there was a queue outside! 
We had ordered-
1. Squid Rings in butter garlic- Slightly chewy, but tastes good. 
2. Devilled Crab Meat- Very soft and delicious.
3. Coq-Au-Vin - The chicken tasted lovely, and it is a very filling dish.
4. Chicken Stroganoff - The mix of cream and chicken was heavenly.
5. Sheperd's Pie- Well cooked and soft.
6. Moon Faan- This was also good.

However, we had to wait a very long time for the food. When the Coq-Au-Vin I had ordered finally arrived (it was the first dish to arrive after our entr√©e - Squid Rings) it was whisked away just as I was starting to eat it, with the waiter saying that plate was for another table. 
In my opinion, he should just have left the plate as it is because the orders were the same after all, so he could easily have given the next Coq-Au-Vin dish to that table. After all, what if I had already begun eating? 
The person serving us and taking our orders also appeared confused and uncomprehending.

We went there on 27th November for lunch and came out with a mixed reaction. It was Sunday and the restaurant was almost full. Luckily, we got a table and settled there with the menu card. However, we got attended after almost 15 minutes. We placed the order for two molecular mojitos and, kele ke phool ke croque monsieur and Hyderabadi mutton haleem kibbeh as starters. A few minutes later, we were served the kibbeh which we enjoyed totally. However, the second starter (kele ke phool) and mojitos did not reach us. After a while, another person (Amit Nag) attended us and suggested for molecular infusion, instead of the mojito. As per his suggestion, we changed the order from mojito to infusions (spicy pomegranate and smoked guava). We also reported him about the second starter which did not arrive till then. He ensured to take care of it and finally we were served "that item" along with the infusions. We loved all the items. Further, Amit Nag suggested a few more dishes and we ordered lymwn samak (a Korean lemon flavored grilled fish dish) from the entree section. It was awesome. By that time, we were too full to order any main dish; so after discussing with Mr Nag, we placed the order for jack daniels mousse for dessert. This item was also an winner and we felt very happy to be guided by Mr Nag for the menu selection. However, in all the dishes we ordered, we could not notice any application of molecular technology in the presentation. We are sure those were made to perfection applying molecular gastronomy; but lack of visual implication disheartened us. Adding here, the service part earned a few negative marks.

The best fusion in town...
I am quite blown away with their cocktails
It was wife's birthday and it was a family dinner.
We had their signature dish charmoula and malai reshmi murg as starters and blue frappe and terminator as mocktails and cocktails respectively, awesome is the word !!!
In the main course we has fish in lemon butter sauce and shepherds pie...both lived UpTo the expectations.
Biggest part is their service, it's almost personalized one would feel...
Go what chef recommends and you will not be disappointed.

Absolutely genius!

Spice Kraft takes your expectations and absolutely blows them out of the water. Arguably among the most professional restaurants I've ever eaten at. Great company, amazing food and ergonomically brilliant.

The service was fantastic. In a city like Kolkata, most restaurants will employ waiters without any real knowledge of the menu. Spice Kraft stands out here. All their waiters are well versed with the menu and are quick to offer suggestions. Granted that too many suggestions, too often are a bit of a turn off, but not when the food turns out as well as it did. 

The real star was always going to be the food. I've heard so much about this place, and the fact that you don't come here for just the one cuisine. Eat whatever, leave satisfied. It's too rare a trait to not appreciate fully. Their array of alcoholic beverages and 'boozerts' are astounding. The food is reminiscent of every good meal I've ever had. The Deviled Crab is a show stopper and the Pork in Rendang is the best Peranakan dish I've ever had. The Suon Nuong too was a good order. The much famed Beer Batter Fish is a worthy starter, although it seems to simple a thing for a restaurant which excels in quality complex food. I'll say it again - order whatever you want to, because it's all excellent!

I wish I could give it a five out of five, but that's reserved for a restaurant where I couldn't flaw a thing. Here, while the experience was terrific, it didn't seem complete. I'll be coming back often. Their pricing for 4 would come to around 3500 if you're very into alcohol. Till then, expecting beautiful things!

Ambience/Interiors: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Food: 4.5/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

Very well thought food preparation. ¬†The preparation are awesome. Visited this place on 26th Nov 2016 which was a special day for me ...I visited for the first time. Coming to the food, I had ordered dajaj chermoula which is a variant of grilled chicken. I was completely bowled over by dajaj chermoula. It was an absolute delight. ¬†Then we ordered Beer ¬†can tempura Fish with orange sauce, it was awasam.. Drinks: The mango driver with smirnoff, it was nice combination.

The continental food choices are pretty good.

Ambiance is top notch.

The owner takes special care of their guests.
Everyone must visit there..

Ambience and lighting is okay. The space isn't a lot. Hence it felt a bit crammed. With all the designs and lights and wall mounts, it did sure make me feel very dark and heavy. Doesn't have the breezy, classy, shooting to the eye 'feel' to the ambience.

The food was okay too. Ordered chicken biryani. Made with ghee instead of oil. It was tasty. 
Tried green chilli chicken. It was tasty.
One Lebanese chicken started. Don't remember the name. They provided four pieces of chicken with bone. It was sure tasty but only four pieces for 200 bucks? 50 bucks each. Not happy with the quantity.


The way they provide seating to customers is epic. There are three sections. One for family other for friends group another for couples. 
Because we were three guys neither did we get a seat in family, nor friends. Apparently they wanted a girls group or at least groups with girls in it. Finally we got a seat in the family section on a condition that if asked by authorities there, we must say a female friend will join. Thanks to the person who got us the place from the bottom of my heart. But I think if a restaurant doesn't like men populating it, they should explicitly mention it.

I have visited SpiceKraft on several occasions and never once been disappointed! The ambience is cosy and though the area¬† itself is not¬† too large , the available space is used to good effect, and the quirky touches/setpieces¬† such as the spice truck on each table and the plating of dishes (bicycle cart used to serve the Indian Breads , the beer batter fried¬† fish served in beer cans) can be great conversation starters! The food itself is delicious and innovative¬† and¬† the menu a judicious mix of Continental, Middle Eastern , Asian and Indian Regional cuisine.¬† Chef Sambit has a rare knack of selecting and curating dishes from around the world, and¬† knowing when to put¬† his own innovative spin on them - and when to leave then just as they are! Some of the items that I loved include the crunchy beer batter fried fish (despite not being a fish enthusiast myself), the soft and melt in the mouth Dajaj Chermoula (Lebanese chicken drumsticks ), the baked crab (cheesy and yummy). the Coq a vin, the Lamb Goshtaba (Velvety¬† smooth texture).... I could go on and on!¬† The cocktails like Jamun Mary are pretty interesting too and come in generous portions! The dessert selection, while a tad limited , have some delectable dishes¬† like the Jack Daniel Mousse and the Monte carlo. The stewards are attentive and well informed, and the personal attention and suggestions by Chef Sambit is the icing on the cake! Overall a must visit. I wish the Team SpiceKraft all the best for the coming days and look forward to the day when they become a name to reckon with not only in Kolkata's food scene (where they have already made¬† their mark), but on the National and International Stage as well!

We had mutton, chicken, crab, prawn and fish....5 people and bill of just over 4k. No alcohol. 

A must visit. I will be visiting many times. Got to try the whole range :-).

Firstly, let me share that I needed more than just a restaurant for I had to apologize to my Girlfriend and take her to a nice joint for a really special experience. A friend of mine suggested me this place.
I must say, Spice Kraft completely met my expectations.
This subtle restaurant is located beside the Ballygunj Branch of HDFC bank.
At first we ordered their signature Beer Can Tempura Fish served with Orange Ponu Tartare sauce. Fish was tender and left a nice impression. Went really well with Rum. I could not resist myself to taste different cuisines as soon as I noticed they serve Continental, Sea-Food and also Asian.
I asked for a Lobster Thermidor for my Girlfriend. For myself I ordered Roasted Pork in Rendung Curry and Chicken Fried Rice. Lobster Thermidor looked mouth-watering and tasted delicious. Rendung Curry was mildly spicy. I haven't tasted anything related to pork like this before. Chicken fried rice tasted just like it had to be.For dessert, I went with yet another signature dish, 100% Jack Daniels Mousse served with madeira cake. Only thing I would like to describe about that is, it left an everlasting impression.
In short, Spice Kraft left both of use happy and amazed.
This place is worth a recommendation if you are looking for a nice time with your family, spouse or friends.

A crafty restaurant which spoils a foodie over the plethora of options which are toothsome and eluding !! Dropped in during the pujas on the recommendation of one of my friends, it is located near Hazra Law College. The restaurant is moderately spacious with low light ambience. The choice of cocktails are huge. Though we took Hammers Jack, which was too good, few others also looked to be fine. Out of several starters, tempura fish in beer can was just wow and got us clean bowled. In the main course, for the 1st time I tried Nasi Goereng, which is a kind of sticky rice, much better than our traditional fried rice. Last but not the least the laal mas, a Rajasthani mutton preparation was extremely delectable and gave my penchant for mutton a new twist!! I wish to get back here more often just to try out all the varieties they offer. Overall a highly recommended place for food buffs.

A small part of heaven (for those who love food) located in Ballygunge area. Though the exterior is not that grand, once you enter the place, you are in a different world with good interiors and great food. The taste as well as presentation of the food you order is going to please you. Even the waiters are quite helpful and are completely aware of the food they are serving. Definitely a place to go and enjoy your meals

Spice Kraft will sweep you by its bright decor the first time you step in. It is sure to lift up your mood. Coming to the food, I had ordered dajaj chermoula which is a variant of grilled chicken, moon faan and chicken in chilly soya sauce. I was completely bowled over by dajaj chermoula. It was an absolute delight. Moon faan had a completely different taste from the regular Chinese fried rice. Even the chicken deserves a thumbs up. Quantity wise too the food matched up to my expectations. A great gastronomical experience I must say!

Fantastic is probably an understatement for this outlet.... located on hazra road just opposite to the hazra law college, this place has been quite a revelation in the kolkata restaurant market and i had targeted for a visit for pretty long time....
seats around 60 people at once or a little more than that, this place has a simple decor.... the seats are distributed between 2 rooms and quite and private corners.... very well usage of space one must say.... take a look at the menu and at that price its quite a classy affair inside it.... you can see it in the staff, the crockery and cutlery and in the air off course....
coming to the food straightaway and i was mighty impressed.... no wonder it stands so highly on the zomato ranking.... pretty unique menu or atleast the naming and marketing of it.... i took my my team and hence ordered quite a big range of food from mocktails to cocktails..... starters to. maim course which ranged between european to Indian to oriental... i actyally went for the cocktails this time and tried a couple of them.... a beer based one with sour mix which was not the best to be honest and thats because i made a bad choice..... and a vodka based one, hazelnut heaven, a must try..... tasted pretty close to a lighter version of bailey's Irish cream.... amidst the starters we ordered a lot of beer batter fish which was excellent by taste and portion.... chicken fire crackers which was average, chicken sish touk which tasted heavenly.... and a few others.... during the main course i went for a baked fish Wellington and a coq au vin... both again were heavenly and filling..... we finished with the jack Daniels mousse which was a little to alcoholic in taste for my liking....
pros for the place are many as you can understand.... great food, soothing ambience, excellent and smart staff, special mention for somnath who was cordial all the way and look after all the tantrums that we caused as a big team... and a great chef come owner, sambit (banik) da who is extremely humble and speaks to the guests at every table..... the presentation of each and every dish was unique and tacky.... the place can be used for large gathering and can cater all kinds of taste buds due to multiple cuisine they serve...
improvement areas.... in spite of a score of 5, i feel there probably are areas that can be given a second thought.... background music could be better... for food, when i ordered the baked fish Wellington i was expecting a dish probably wrapped in puff pastry like typical Wellingtons are.. but it was not, the sauce for coq au vin was a little too thick... and the service can be a tad faster with a bit of spring in the steps for the staff..... the menu cards looked torn and can be repaired
all in all, a great experience and a highly recommended place for every dining event and mood... keep up the good work team Spice Kraft

The 'Spice Kraft' is a place where you don't just gulp the food, in stead savour it.
The first thing you will experience is the warm welcome. Then, the captivating decor coupled with the ambience is enough to set the mood for a romantic dinner with your beloved. The glassy interior is really classy and the seats are quite cosy. Notably, the craft on the table will surely grab your attention.

However, their food is even more impressive. On several occasions we have tried many of their signature dishes-

LYMN SAMAK : Soft and fresh fish cooked in Lebanese spices, subtle yet extraordinary in taste. (5/5)

DEVIL CRAB : Crab meat mixed with spices and cheese, baked in the crab shell. Flavourful crab without the overpowering taste of cheese. (5/5)

BEER BATTER FISH FRY : fresh fish coated with ultra thin a crunchy batter. Tastes best with the orange flavoured mayo they provide. (4.5/5)

DAJAJ CHARMOULA : Succulent Lebanese drumsticks served in cups with sour cream. (4/5)

KELE KE PHOOL : they turn the humble banana floret into delicious dumplings flavoured with cheese, pineapple and amchur. (4/5)

TANDOORI SAUSAGE : Chicken sausage marinated with tandoori spices and oven cooked. (3.5/5)

CHICKEN IN MASAMAN CURRY : Thai delicacy perfectly executed. Medium spicy curry, flavoured with gondhoraj leaves and curry leaves, tasted awesome with steamed rice. (5/5)

MEEN MOILI : Coconut flavoured soft chunks of fish simmered in thick medium spicy gravy goes well with non spicy staples. (4.5/5)

MURG DA MOKUL : Shredded chicken cooked in spicy north indian gravy, devoid of excess oil, tastes nice with naan or biryani. (4/5)

Besides, we have also tried Mixed Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken, Moon Faan, Mutton Biryani, Drums of Heaven, Chicken kebabs and Monte Carlo. These dishes are good as they should be.

Service is polite and suggestive. But is a bit slow.
However, the quantity they serve per plate is on the lesser side

In conclusion.. Unforgettable experience..

Been here during Durga Puja. My opinions are listed below:

1. Food: Delicious and succulent. Devilled crab just made me head over heels. Another lebanese chicken dish served within small earthen pots were delicious too. And the final punch was given by Hammerjack! An awesome drink that was served in a never before seen way that won us and hammered us totally!
2. ¬†Ambiance: Somewhat exotic, keeping up with their signature cuisine style. Soothing yet exciting. It hooks you on.
3. Service: Immaculate and co-operating. Couldn't be better.

Overall had a very enjoyable experience. Already noted down for another visit to experience more of their cuisines.

Me and my friends were planning to visit this place for last some days as the overall rating is good but we were not so much fond of continental dishes. That's why we came here with a question mark in our mind. But the place, the ambience and the service and moreover the food we had here were beyond questionable. It was a meeting after many long time, it became a memorable one and Spice Kraft was a main reason for that. You do not have to wait for too long for your orders. Stuffs were very helpful to choose the better dishes. The location is also very advantageous. Parking available.

A much heard name fast gaining popularity with their utterly delicious food and elegant ambience.Having heard very highly of it and after several attempts i finally ended up at Spicekraft the day before yesterday brimming with expectations.And surely Spicekraft did not fail to impress me from any aspect.Right from the smiling gatekeeper to the extremely cordial waiters who showed us to our seats and the artistically decorated insides,everything was a pleasure to experience.As i went there to celebrate my mother's birthday,the drinks menu..though enticing was out of reach for me.. :P 
We started with their famous dajaj charmoula..soft juicy tender pieces of grilled chicken along with a sweet yoghurty sauce..it was out of this world.We ended up ordering two plates of it.Next in line was bacardi lemon infused chicken sausages..another foodgasm on our palettes and certainly a new representation to behold.Then came along their famous shephards pie just with the right amount of cheese and delicious mashed potatoes inside.The pie was served with freshly toasted and buttered bread slices.We ended our scrumptious meal with their forever popular jack daniels mousse..just with the right amount of alcohol infused..just enough to bring out its aroma and flavour yet glorifying the chocolate.
The stuff behavior here is one of the best i have ever witnessed..soft..polite..well spoken..and extremely interactive..helping us choose..explaining the different dishes and their procedures..etc.
Finally we left the place with a full stomach and a completely satisfied soul.The pocket pinch is a bit more than some other places but the food makes up for that with its taste.

We end up being there when me and my husband were looking for draught beer. But it was never known to me that it will come out to be a treasure of exotic foods. We ordered draught beer, fish tempura in beer, Sish touk, Dajaj charmola and  100% jack daniel chocolate mousse. First of all we were very happy to get d kingfisher draught beer which is a rare case in most of the restros in Kolkata. Then these dishes added more happiness to d evening. The presentation of every food item was really innovative and beautiful. The way dey served fish tempura was just wow. Sish touk was more of creamy and it was so beautifully cooked. It melts so smoothly in ur mouth. Dajaj Charmoula was not dat to d mark as i expected it to be more like bhatti ka murg as it was presented. 100% jack daniel mousse was really good. I wud really suggest all my frens to be there. And yes I am sure at I gonna visot dee again and again and again

They have wonderful ambience,  food and service a wonderful blend if all hence nearing perfection. They serve continental, Asian and Indian food all equally good. Their desserts are special and different do give it a try. 
I starters try fish in beer batte and main course mandarin fish with chicken you will enjoy.
Though they have misspelt chicken stroganoff in their menu they do spell it right in their bill.

Been to Spicekraft for celebrating our anniversary with a cozy dinner. The wait was almost for 25mins and it was not good.
But once we got in, the ambience was picture perfect for a fine dine restaurant. The cheeky props helped our cause of having a great time.
Pudina pulao, Baked fish Wellington amongst the dishes we tried, were outstanding. Service was quite courteous and timely executed. 
This is a beautiful restaurant to light up your evenings. Much recommended and will be back soon.

Had gone there a few days back with my friends. It is a cozy place near Hazra Law College. We ordered Beer Can Tempura Fish and Soy braised drums of heaven. Both the preparations were 5/5 and the presentation on the plate was beautiful. The chef cum owner of the restaurant was always around making sure that all the guests were enjoying their food and he made some Asian cuisine recommendations from the menu, which was awesome. We loved the ambience as well as the food. For dessert, my friends ordered their speciality 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse while I ordered the Classic Monte Carlo. As expected these were amazing. I would highly recommend this place. We too plan to visit soon.....

Location- If you come from ballygunge Pahari you need to take a left and on hazra road it's there. It is very easy to find. If you come from gariahat side take garcha road and turn towards hazra road. You will find spice Kraft next to hdfc bank.
Ambiance- This is a low lit well decorated place and the furniture and cutlery goes with the ambiance. They have a nice space there and can accommodate many customers at a time. I wish the music was a bit loud for this environment.
Food ordered- I went there with one of my friend and ordered hammer jack and Chiva's juel in drinks. Beer battered fish in starter. Shepherd's pie and pork chops in main course and jack Daniels mousse as dessert.
Quality-quantity-taste-
Hammer Jack- This is a wonderful blend of 5 types of alcohol along with red bull with mint on top. The blend was just perfect in taste and I just loved it!
Chiva's Juel- This one is finely made of Chivas regal with lemon and mint.
Beer battered fish- Being a Bengali fish is always my soft corner and I did not mind the way they cooked this dish. This was made and served nicely. Garnishing was so good. The best part - There were no smell of the fish ..It's made with care.
shepherd's pie- It is served in two small bowls with lamb inside. They serve garlic bread also. I liked the taste.
Pork chops- This was not there in the menu and this one is their chefs special which they recommended to me. This was wonderfully made! This one is highly recommended! But quantity wise this was less as per price which I have mentioned to the waiter also. But as far as the taste is concerned this was just out of the world.
Jack Daniel mousse- I have loved this dessert item and do not know how to explain this item. But do try this.

Conclusion- Spice Kraft is such a restaurant which you can't judge by just going once. There are authentic dishes which they serve and I have huge number of items which are there in my wish list. I would have given a five out of five if they improve the quality of music and quantity of food in Mediterranean main course. I look forward to visit this place soon.

The d√©cor of spice Kraft will not evoke your senses compared to other restaurants in Kolkata but the food is worth the time and money. 

They have selected few dishes ranging from Lebanon to Indonesian and they have done justice to it. Their famous beer can tempura fish and Dajaj chermoula are sumptuous and will make you crave for more. 

Nasi Goreng combined with Mandarin fish are appetising and cost-efficient. 

The staff is friendly and decent. The alcohol section will not disappoint you and the cocktails are known to be pretty famous.

Heard a lot of the place from many of my friends recently. So gave a visit to check out the buzz happening in town of this place. Was extremely happy to visit as the food quality, ambience, staff courtsey was overwhelming.The dishes are absolutely mouth watering. Tried continental, a dish which i liked the most was Shepherd's pie which i believe every people visiting must give a try. Altogether a wonderful experience ,would definitely visit again and i would urge the people of the city to make a quick visit here.

Great Food. Tried the items recommende by the Chef,was trully impressed by the quality of food and the taste.Would love to go again.But did not like the sitting arrangements.We were 3 Males and were told to sit inside with the other table being occupied by a big group.As they were a big group and sitting far from each other they spoke very loudly.The whole room was so noisy that it spoilt our Lunch.I request the Chef to do something for it.Not only so people should understand that fine dinning is about not talking loudly with each other and cracking jokes but enjoying every dish with passion.

Rare! This particular word has lots of meaning in it. From a particular thing to a person and going towards a rare habit also. But how often you use the term rare while you visit a place to eat. I guess zero. This is the word which i uttered from my mouth when i landed upto this place with wholesome of expectation with one of my friend. Being in my wish list for such a ¬†long time and i have heard about this place with such good ratings really made me curious about this place.

I feel Food is Worship and it has been since ages, even in the New Testament it is stated, 'Whether you eat or drink............ do all to the glory of the God'
So it is indeed a splendid gift from God.. Acknowledge it and get blessed with good food is what i pray for thee.. Recently i was blessed to have my such amazing experience! One such place i happened to discover and relish it was when i was in Calcutta.. And thats Spice Kraft for you! Lets start the gupshup on it.. 
First up is The Ambience: This place is in Ballygunge in proximity to Hazra law college.. This place is very cosy and subtly done.. Looks decent and when one is seated the table is done very vibrantly.. loved the attractive mini truck which caught my attention! The cutlery was also at par.. loved the usage of paint palette as well as wooden platter almost shaped like a wooden bat! 
Next up is The Food: I loved the whole idea of confusion is new fusion! I literally devoured half of the food with my eyes.. it looked so appealing and attractive! I had gone with my family..Heres what we ordered:
The Chef recommended us the cocktail drink called The Terminator: lookwise twas class! And tastewise twas different yet good.. the guy who drank it loved it.. so am taking that as good!
Khoai Tay: This was the vietnamese dish.. The potatoes were very crisp and tossed in Sriracha sauce with a dash of lemon grass flavour! Loved the preparation and relished it!
Kele ka Phool ke Croque Monsieur with Creme Fraiche: This dish was a stunner.. I wish i could have had the whole platter.. i so dint want to share it with my family.. ;) The kele ke Phool cutlet was very yum and the creme fraiche dip was yum.. i literally wanted second helping of this gingerly amchur and creamy dip! Must TRY this dish! It just stole my heart away!
Doodiyan Kebab: So this more or less tasted like dahi k kebab coz we challenged the chef to remove the core ingredient and that is Lauki/doodhiya.. and this was prepared nicely!
Cannelloni: This was pasta sheet wrapped up in veggies, red sauce and cheese.. liked the preparation!
So we ordered Boozert called 100% JD Chocolate mousse with JD dipped sponge: And this more or less tasted like boozert yet loved the petit dessert presentation.. Unique idea.. Loved the feeling that the chef actually catered to all our needs and served us exactly what we were looking for!! The only thing that i felt was that the portions of the food served is less.. coz i was left wanting for more.. so if you guys can increase the portions.. :)
Lastly, The Service and Pocket Pinch: The staff were selected few but that din't affect the service.. kudos to keeping up the service.. This place is reasonably priced.. Please go visit this well crafted place and spice up your life! Do share your food stories.. would love to hear 'em all!

Good decor, nice ambience and delicious food.. You want them all with a nice evening drink..? You should be here at spicekraft..that too with affordable prices.
Tried the Starters.. All three -  a veg dish, a fish dish and a chicken dish. And found the taste to be quite up to the mark especially with the drink. Staff wqs friendly and well informed. Chef Sambit chatted with us and suggested a few of their specialties.. Would definitely go back and try them. Thumbs up from me. 
Just a suggestion : a little variety in music wouldn't hurt a bit.

Never noticed this ever earlier but the hype took me to this place. The front gave an ok impression as we walked in the ambiance was better than expected me then they took us further inside which has another seating area the service was good the servers were polite. We ordered the much talked about Dajaj charmoula and it was out of the world and is a MUST TRY just melts in your mouth. The chef is really benevolent and is approachable which is one of the best part of eating at this place. I would definitely give it a üëç keep it up n keep going all the very best!

We visited this place on 30th Oct on my sister's budday.This place is located at a very nice location and very easy to find.
The ambience was good,I wont say awesome but nice mostly there food makes up for that,staff members are well behaved and very decent.
The dishes we ordered:
Beer can tempura fish - Best among starters we had.
Barcardi Limon infused chicken sausage - Average.
Squid rings - I didnt had but my friends said it was good.
Among main course I loved there pan fried cantonese noodles which was my dish of the evening.
We also tried chicken in oyster and mushrooms and chilli garlic noodles which was average.
Being a non alcoholic I didnt tried anything but my family liked wateva cocktails they ordered.
I would say there ambience can be better but I would love to visit this place again and try some more innovatively decorated dishes.

There is no point which left us wanting for more. From decor to behaviour of staff, friendly recommendations, plating of food and finally the food -- everything was as desired. We had hit the place after a tiring day, and the experience made us relax and refreshed. The best part was the personal interest that the chef took in the clients. He was visiting tables asking for suggestions. We tried -- beer batter fried fish, haleem kibbeh, shepherd's pie. Finally, the chef promised us out of the box and menu items when we visit next -- so we are already excited to go back soon again.

Spice Kraft is one of a kind restaurant catering to a global cuisine. They are serving an eclectic mix of Asian, Middle-Eastern and Continental dishes. The decor was charming and so was the food. We ordered Dajaj Chermoula and Beer batter tempura fish for starters and chilli garlic noodles, moon fan rice and hunan chicken for main course.. From presentation to taste, everything was flawless.. But the star of the show was their signature dessert, Jack Daniel mousse.. we simply loved it.. It was a great experience and would surely go back to try some of their continental fare..

I would give this place a 4.9 if I could. I won't go a complete 5 because one of the dishes I felt was not as good as the others but, in future if I have the kind of brilliant experience I had here - this rating will go beyond 5!

After a lot (and I really mean a lot) of searching on Zomato for that perfect place that offers great food, solid drinks and a perfect dim ambience - I was lucky to come across this gem. We called ahead and made reservations on a Saturday. Once we were there, what struck me was how compact the place was - coming from Hyderabad where real estate is more generous I can't give them negative points for this. But I must say they have done the smartest thing with the space - they have 3 areas you can sit in. One is well lit and the other two seem more dimly lit. We sat at a nice table in the latter area and I must acknowledge how well the servers catered to us. Very attentive, always helpful.

We decided to with Zomato suggestions and ordered the beer can tempura fish and dajaj charmoula. These were complemented with LIITs. Presentation - beyond brilliant. Haven't seen anything like this yet. Taste - the dajaj dish just cannot be missed. It's a crime. To get that soft chicken with such a buttery taste at such a price?! The tempura was amazing too. The LIITs here really pack a punch and are very high on the value for money scale.

We then ordered the Bacardi limon infused tandoori sausages. Again - presentation was so delightful. The sausages were not bad but nothing extraordinary.

Mains was lobster and Coq Au Vin (chicken cooked in wine). The lobster was very very good. The chicken was a bit of a disappointment - sweet and a bit too caramel ized for our taste. Both dishes came with a little serving of rice and the lobster came with veggies as well. Quantity is just enough for one person - very gourmet like quantity.

We were celebrating a birthday so had quietly asked them to arrange a cake. They did so effortlessly and got out the creamiest cake - made the evening very memorable. The Chef was also making rounds and seeking feedback - kudos to him!

Overall, we had the best evening. The music wasn't too loud so we could hear each other. The food and drinks were great. And most of all, the servers were very knowledgable! Best part? The food bill was lower than we expected! This restaurant has a place in my to-dos in Kolkata from now on.

Tip - one of the servers mentioned that if we had told them beforehand, they would have made the cake themselves. I guess for us, they may have had to purchase from somewhere.

Spice kraft has been there in ¬†my wishlist for quite a long time, finally was able to visit this place on Ashtami. Me and my friend went there for lunch but due to the ¬†puja rush, they were full and unfortunately we had to wait for the table for like 15mins. The place is ¬†not much spacious in respect of it's demand but its ¬†quite ¬†well decorated, cozy and has a satisfactory ambience. ¬†
¬†I need to mention that hospitality of the staffs really impressed me. ¬†I remember ordering for their signature desert dish - 100% ¬†Jack Daniels Mousse. At first they informed that during puja they are not having any desert dishes but they will once request the chef. ¬†A few minutes later ¬†another staff ¬†came an informed that they were really sorry but they wont be able to serve any desert on that day. As we were almost done with our lunch, the staff who was serving us previously told us that he ¬†was sorry for not being able to serve to our expectation and said that he will manage to arrange two monte carlos for us specially. ¬†I found that quite caring and generous gesture.
Anyways, coming to the food, ¬†I think the wait was worthwhile as the food was amazing. ¬†We ordered for beer can tempura fish (it was my favourite among all the dishes we tried that day), shepherd's pie - ideal one for meat lovers, nasi goreng - ¬†which I found quite average compared to the others ¬†and monte carlo as desert. Nothing to complain about the food but its just that had been the food a little bit warmer it would have tasted much better. Price is reasonable in comparison to the quality of food and the quantity ¬†they serve.
Both me and my friend are planning to revisit the place in order to accomplish our wish to try their signature desert dish! :)

Great food and great booze. The devilled crab meat, Tandoori Chicken Sausages, beer battered fish and pork ribs burrah kabab are must tries. Even all the continental dishes like chicken stroganoff and shepherds pie are delicious. They prepare each cuisine equally well. Loved the Indonesian Nasi Goreng and Pork. Along with that, the cocktails and desserts are also of a different level. Service  is good too. Strongly recommended.

The Tempura fish served in a beer can, Bacardi Limon Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausages, and Lymwn Samak (Arabic style lemon flavored grill fish) were amazing starter items! The Doodhiyan Kabab is lip-smacking too! Prawn Thermidor in the main course was o-so-good!! The way how the food was served was interesting too. This place is surely worth several tries.

Brilliant presentation and taste. In the main course we ordered Kashmiri Gustaba and Chicken dish from lucknow. The nan was served in a small cycle. The dessert was surely the best. Jack Daniel 's mousse was mouth watering and so well plated! This place needs to be visited!

Have been to multiple restaurants but this was the best good destination I have ever been to.Quality of food is too good.All the dishes are very innovative.Loved the Tempura fish having been served in a Budweiser recycled can , that's like really awesome.Then had the devil crab meat , nicely baked from outside and inner meat submerged in cheese ,melts in the mouth a must try for foodies.Following these had pork ribs which is indeed rare , deliciously cooked by chef.Last but not the least the dish which I shall cherish Baked Fish Wellington  (Fish baked wid extra cheese on it).Fish was very well baked and cheese added to it's taste further.

Really impressed with the food innovation and quality of this particular place , chef was very polite visiting all tables to get the review .Would love to visit again

A never-before experience.... right from the d√©cor to the cocktails and the food.... bang on spot.
Spice Kraft was there on my wish list for quite a long time....and .... the place indeed met my expectations.
The ambience was just perfect.... the music and the light... creating the mood for a great evening.
Coming to the food.... the beer can tempura fried fish was so good ... we placed a second... n then a third can of it!
The shepherds pie was good... but not great.
Deviled crab was creamy and flavourful but was a bit dry!
Both the cocktails were great.... the litchitini was fruity with a bitter aftertaste ... while the roasted pineapple flavoured gin infusion was kinda good... rather great.... spicy and sweet!
Tequila shots are something we have been shown way too many times in the movies... so yeah.... having them in real life was a great thing for us.
Alas ! The three JackDaniels made us too drunk for a dessert.
The cost is on the upper side ... but then..... indulging in luxury once in a while is no sin!!!
Go on....get some friends.... get a table .... and enjoy the moment at SpiceKraft!!!!

Unfortunately we visited this place during the puja,  hence had to stay content with the puja 'special' menu only.  But having said that,  i have to confess that what all were in offering was enough to give my tastebuds a nice enjoyable vacation from the run of the mill,  similar tasting resto food.  Particularly the Beer batter tempura fish.  Waiting to go back for more!

Well, there are some places which serves delicious starters, some serve great cocktails and some are known for their desserts, but when you find a place where everything you eat is just heavenly, you feel you are too lucky to try out a place like this. One of the rare occasions when I am numbed with each and every dishes which came through on the food journey. The quality and innovativeness of each dish is something which can be admired. Before starting my review I would like my reader's to know that each and every word and is true from a foodie's heart and no fiction.

Location: 
From Ballygunge Phari if you go towards Hazra, you will find this place on your left. Its just too easy to find.

Ambience:
A very classy decor with comfortable seating. The dim lights goes well with the interiors. The place has three sections and all of them are different from each other. A nice cozy place to have some outstanding food with your loved ones.

Service:
The service was good with well trained staffs who knew their job pretty well. They had good knowledge about all the dishes they were serving. The behaviour of the staffs are something which should be praised, a consistent smile on their face, with a positive vibe.

Food & Drinks

Cocktails & Mocktails:

*#* Tangerita: A non-alcoholic drink made with orange and pineapple juice, blended with secret spices. The drink was one of its kind. Thick, tangy, spicy and something you would never say no.

*#* Liquid Bomb: An alcoholic drink with Grape Juice, Gold Tequila and Cointreau. Well, if you like your drink to be a lil spicy this can be just for you. The bulb glass presentation was appealing.

*#* Pain Killer : The quirky names are something which will tempt you to place the order. This one was  a Vodka based drink punched with Cranberry Juice, Silver Tequila and lime. If you don't want your drink to be hard on you, this is something which will please you.

*#* Terminator: The name again doing the trick, alluring the guys to try it. A beer based cocktail made  with Heineken Beer , Cointreau and Tequila. One of my personal favourite.

*#* Long Island Ice Tea: Well, you don't need much of a description of this. It has everything to give u a punch. Gin, tequila, vodka, rum and Cointreau. The classic of 1920s was a hit again.

*#* The Jamun Mary: Well, when you want something different and new you can just give this a try. Kala Jamun Juice with vodka base and some spices.

*#* The Hammer Jack: This one is not for the weak hearted people. Wanna take up a challenge, go for this. Tequila, Vodka, White Rum, Dark Rum you get it all topped with Red Bull. I don't think I need to say anymore to make you put this in your wishlist.

Starters:

*#* Dajaj Charmoula : One of the speciality dishes from the house can never disappoint you. This dish is one of its kind. The presentation was different making it eye catching,  the chicken was tender with crisp outer layer, the blend of spice was perfect and the accompanied dip was going well all together.

*#* Bacardi Limon Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausages with Churan & Blueberry Coulis : Right from the moment it came to my table it allured me to have, that gives you an idea of how good the presentation was. It tasted just too good but what needs a special mention is the dip which came along with it. The blend of blueberry was just amazing.

*#* Beer Can Tempura Fish with Orange Ponzu Tartar√© : One of the popular dishes of this place doesn't require any more introduction. The presentation yet again was too good. The crispiness of the fish with such juicy, mild sweet interior was heavenly. The tartar√© sauce was just the perfect sauce to accompany with.

*#* Hong Shao Rou : Roast Chilli Pork slices tossed in Oyster and Hoisin Sauce. A bit on the spicier side, great taste. The pork was so tender that I could tear it into half at one go. A pork lover's delight for sure.

*#* Mahi Malai Kebab : Something Indian was required in between the dishes from all over the globe so we tried this. The fish was as tender as it can be, the balance of spices was really good, overall great again.

*#* Devilled Crab Meat: Well, this is one of the best of the food journey. Crab meat baked in cream and Dijon Mustard. The creamy mix with the meat was delicious. If you want to have crab in a different way, you can't miss this one for sure.

Main Course

*#* Coq-Au- Vin : A classic from the 16th Century, and a hit since its inception. Roasted Chicken in Red Wine Jus with Shallots and Mushroom served with Buttery Rice. The Chicken was so tender that it melted in the mouth, the blend with Red Wine was just too good to make me fall for it. A wow dish overall.

*#* Shepherd's Pie : This doesn't need any description. The minced lamb with the creamy layer above was just too good. This place is extremely good with it. One of the best Shepherd's pie I have tasted so far.

*#* Ham Steak with Mashed Potatoes : Everything to perfection. From the boiled veggies to the mashed potatoes to the steak, the chef nailed it all. The Pork was very very soft which made me a bit more happier.

*#* Pork Meat Loaf with Parsley Buttery Rice : Well, its sometime very awkward to praise everything you have eaten at a particular place, but I have no other option. This place is spectacular at everything they serve and this was no exception.

Desserts

*#* Jack Daniel's Moose: The Chef's Special Dessert was just the perfect note to end with. The moose was out of the world, with some sponge cakes. If you are at this place, you can never avoid this particular dessert.


Last Words:
I don't remember any other place which I praised so much. But this place deserves every bit of it because of their food quality, presentation, taste and service. A place I can be never be tired of visiting.
Kuddos to the whole team, great effort to please your customers.

A 4.5/5 to Spice Kraft.

This place is awesome in terms of food and as well as ambience. Light fluidic music, courteous staffs and uniquely_named_ dishes ....  just perfect for a dinner with your best buddy/better half. We ordered both the recommended dishes from Zomato and the staffs and they didn't disappoint us at all. There are other  very popular restaurants in nearby areas but this one definitely should be on everybody's checklist..... Superb place to have good food outside the boring common dishes from other popular places.

In the recent past this had been the best restaurant i visited. Delicious food, apt taste and texture, subtle plating - everything about this place feels like heaven for a food lover like me. I tried beer batter fish fingers which are just finger licking - Soft buttery fish coated in sweet and hot batter with creamy dips. I loved "coq au vin" which has chicken cooked in red wine. Every bit of chicken is juicy and the dish has a lingering taste. Fish wellington is another which has baked fish with perfect amount of cheese and cooked to perfection. Generally most restaurants use too much cheese and white sauce. Cocktails are quite good and cheap. I tried a cucumber drink and another one with peach and sparkling wine. I visited twice and twice the food impressed me. Awesome! 
Must tries- beer batter fried, coq au vin, prawns cooked in plum sauce.

Located opposite to Hazra Law College.

Always had this place bookmarked.
The ambience is awe-strucking. Dim lights with patterned walls and frames makes it really eye-catching. The low lights created magic.

We had the Beer can tempura fish. This was fish dipped in beer batter and fried to crisp. I obviously loved the preparation. Comes with a dip too.
Dajaj Chermoula is amazing. Tender pieces of chicken grilled. I loved it. 
We had meifoon rice too which was quite filling and decent.

I'm longing to get back here and try out more of their stuff especially because this place already managed to impress me.

This place had been on my bucket list for quite sometime until I gave it a visit on ashtami night. Reaching this place, we came across a pretty big line of people waiting outside, and as its a bar, we figured out it will be atleast an hour before we manage to get a table. Happens everywhere during the pujas. But to our surprise, the manager arranged us a table within 10 minutes. 
For drinks we ordered a Hammerjack, an LIIT, a Hazelnut Heaven and a Milk Maid Chaitini. All the cocktails were so good. Hammerjack had the perfect mix and punch of the liquors. My favourite was Hazelnut Heaven. It was amazing with the vanilla creamy texture, vodka and hazelnut crunch. We liked it so much we asked the waiter to suggest something similar, and he gave us the Milkmaid chaitini, which was also great. Cutting chai with vodka, creamed up with milkmaid! 
Besides the cocktails, we took the Beer Can Tempura Fish with the Orange Ponzu tartare dip, and Soy Braised Drums of Heaven Old Monk Flambe. Fish tempura was crispy on the outside and fresh soft fish on the inside. We also took the Dajaj Chermoula. Four chicken legs cooked to perfection in a lebanese style! A must try. 
The staff was very courteous and helpful. Would definitely love go back.

Wanted to tick this place off my wishlist for long, so I decided to hit this hyped place with my group in Ballygunge on Ashtami during this year's Durga Puja. Although initially our plan was to grab a drink or two and resume pandal-hopping, we gave in to the idea of dinner as it was pretty late and there was a massive queue outside which kept us waiting for almost an hour. Not a very difficult place to find since it is located opposite to the Hazra Law College.¬†

Spice Kraft has a wonderful ambiance with a very good presentation of the bar and even a packed restaurant wouldn't ruin the experience of dining in this cozy atmosphere. Durga Pujo in Kolkata is usually the busiest time for all restaurants, attracting widespread interest from people residing not even remotely close to the area, hence the quality of food in even the finest of restaurants is likely to dip, with restaurants resorting to serving items that are popular and likely to take less time to prepare. The scenario at Spice Kraft wasn't any different, with the attendants presenting to us a customized menu which comprised of mostly Asian dishes and a few Continental offerings. It's a shame I couldn't try their Beer Can Tempura Fish and Chicken Stroganoff and had to stick to their Asian offerings. Moreover, they did not have Beer that night, leave alone the tower which we were seeking for. Cocktails were also unavailable.

I absolutely loved the Hong Shou Rou, a Chinese chopped pork starter, having the perfect balance of spicy and tangy and surprisingly soft. The quantity, though, was way too less and they had merged the amount of two plates in one without informing us. In the mains, we ordered Chicken in Oyster Sauce and Manchurian Chicken paired up with Hakka Noodles. Once again, it was not the taste but the quantity that bothered me. While the waiter suggested us to take 3 plates of noodles for 6 people, we actually ended up ordering 5.¬†
The prices are pretty reasonable if one has a good look at the menu, but the scanty quantity makes it a little far from value for money in spite of the good food they offer. Drinks are cheap and they have some good offers on premium brands.¬†

Expected a better experience but probably chose the wrong time to visit this place. Eager to come back for their molecular cocktails and Continental offerings.

Amazing place with beautiful ambience.Located just near hazra law college so its very easy to find.The food is simply marvellous.The price for food as well as liquor is pretty much average.So the best thing that i actually loved was lymw samak , its a fish preparation with amazing amalgamation of softness and texture.I am in love with this dish.Then we ordered dajaj charmoula which is a signature dish and was upto the mark.Pork ribs were pretty great as well.The only thing that i didn't like was the dessert part we opt for jack daniels & barry callevaut.The cocktails are pretty good in a reasonable price.The waiter are very hospitable.@

Its situated just opposite of the hajra law college. Ambience is topnotch.
Coming to food first we ordered the signature dishes.. tempura fish, dajaj charmoula and the lemon infused chicken sausage. Then for main course we ordered chilly garlic noodles and in dessert JD mousse.
Chicken sausage was very delicious in taste. Dajaj charmoula was good but not good as expected and according to the price. Tempura in beer can is just a little better than ordinary fish butter fry..but as it is served in beer can with a good name.. thats why may be this dish has a lots of hype for everyone.
Chilly garlic noodle was okayish.. nothing special.. just like normal ordinary restaurant.
I personally didn't like JD mousse... it was bitter in taste.

An ideal place that makes molecular gastronomy with amazing cozy ambiance. Tried some of their best starter items like Dajaj Charmoula, Lymwyn Samak and Pork Ribs. I found Dajaj Charmoula nothing special, as usual Chicken Drumsticks, just in better shape and size. Stellar dishes were the latter mentioned two. Lymwyn Samak was fantastic in taste, never had so soft fish kebabs. This is a must try here. Equally liked those perfectly cooked Pork Ribs. Service was fast, didn't have to wait for long. I'll definitely come back again to try other dishes.

A lovely dining experience at The Spice Kraft, Calcutta yesterday with one of my best foodie companions, Nayana Afroz from Dhaka.

The overall ambience was nice and friendly.

We started off with Jamun Mary and Utterly Jameson - the former is a Jamun based cocktail with Vodka and Chat Masala and the later, an Irish Cream based cocktail. Loved the Jamun Mary, light with just the right amount of tartness and spice.

The starters comprised of their signature dish Beer Can Tempura Fish and Devilled Crab. The fish was fresh but found the batter a bit too thick for my taste, not as light as a Tempura batter fry is supposed to be that is. The crab was perfect with just the right amount of cheese.

The main course for Nayana Di was Chicken Canollis and for me, Roasted Pork Chops. The Canollis were amazing, minced chicken stuffed in pancakes and served with a very light tomato based sauce. The Pork Chops were usual but the outstanding feature was the mashed potatoes that came with it. Undoubtedly the best mashed potatoes that I have had so far! Chef Sambit was kind enough to share the recipe with me üòä

But the dish that literally took our breath away was the dessert - 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callerbaut. The smoothest Swiss Chocolate Mousse served with drunken Pet√Æt Fours and Orange Reduction. Every mouthful was a burst of flavours. The sweetness perfectly balanced with the tang.

All in all, a must and repeat visits place!

Impressive food!  The signature beer can tempura prawns were good, but what I loved better was the lamb shepherd's pie, which was perfectly made. The dajaj chermoula was great too, with the chicken very juicy and char grilled. The dessert, however, was not up to the expectation. I took the jack daniel chocolate mousse, but the mousse texture was not what is expected. The cocktails, electric blue cosmopolitan and the jamun mary were both good, but would appreciate if the drinks are not filled to the brim as it's difficult to sip. Noticed this problem for surrounding tables too.

I, along with friends,visited this famed eatery on Shoshthi and absolutely savoured the experience.
This place is located opposite the hazra law college on Dover Terrace. It has a warm, romantic ambience with beautifully done, dimly lit interiors and soothing music in the background. The staff is polite and helpful with suggestions on the menu.
The first thing to catch one's eye at the table is a colourful miniature truck screaming 'Swagatam', that contains salt, pepper and the tissue papers. And finally, the food is really the real deal over here. It really is amazing.
We ordered one mocktail named the Tangarita which really lived up to its name owing to the sweet yet tangy taste. We also ordered The Cranapple Driver cocktail, which created just the right amount of buzz needed before that sumptuous meal. Also, there was the classic virgin mojito.
In starters, we ordered the Hong Shao Ru which consists of spiced pork strips cooked to perfection. This is absolutely great. Then there was the beer can tempura fish, really the best fried fish I have ever had. It had just the right amount of batter, was fried aptly and simply melted in the mouth. Also there was the Dajaj Chermoula, a Lebanese dish, with herbed chicken legs cooked to perfection over wood. The taste is amazing.
Then comes the main course. We ordered Nasi Goreng, a spicy fried rice, and Moon Faan, another less spicy variety of rice. Both of these tasted great. We also ordered the Pork Shorpotel, a spicy curry with cubed porks, onion and tomato. This was the pick of the lot for me. Absolutely amazing. We also ordered chicken in Soya chilly sauce. Also, there was the Shepherd's pie, which was great as well.
This is a great place to be at with great food that does not burn a hole in one's pocket. Looking forward to my next visit.

Visited this place on Ashtami, for the festive season the rates changed and they had offers going on alcohol section. We ordered noodles and chicken dish, a pork starter with whiskey and votka and also had tandoori roti. The food was great and cheaper than other restaurants but the quantity was lesser too. But overall it was quite good. The food tasted great inspite of being on festive season. A nice place to hangout with friends and family.

Been hearing about this place from my friends for a very long time, and finally a few days back, decided to give this place a try. This place has a beautiful decor, and to add to it, their entire staff is very courteous.
Coming straight to the point, the food was delicious. Everything we ordered was perfect, especially the Beer Can Tempura Fish. 
The cocktails were out of this world. I'd definitely recommend the cocktails to anybody, because they have quite a few tricks up their sleeves.
In a nutshell, this is a wonderful place to hangout with your friends. Kudos to the entire team at Spice Kraft for creating such a beautiful environment for people to go, and dine at.

Paid a visit to this place after being strongly recommended by a close friend. The queue was unusually long, and as I understand this is more the norm than the exception. So, have waiting factored in your dinner plans.

Hospitality wise, they are right up there. The manager was courteous and accommodating and will make you feel special (unlike some of their Park Street counterparts). The ambiance is an ethereal mix of light and shadow, which makes the experience all the more enriching. 

We had ordered their trademark Fish Tempura which, although is made better on other days, was delicious! The chicken starter had a fancy name, but was just plain vanilla drumsticks. 

The cocktails however were freaking awesome. I am a cocktail freak, and have had cocktails in restaurants all over India, but lil Spice Kraft here knows a trick or two! We had ordered hazlenut heaven and choco beam, both of which were yum...

For the main course, we had nasi goreng and chicken in orange peel. The indonesian delicacy, was traditional yet well made and the chicken in orange peel was to chicken dishes, what Dipa Karmakar is to gymnastics in India- a breath of fresh hope!

The pinch to the pocket was also reasonable, given it's location. Overall, a fine place to have a nice meal with your loved ones that leaves you with something intriguing after, so that you look forward to that next visit in this quaint food hut.

Visited for dinner with friends. Food is good, with sizeable portions (ideal for one hungry person) and interesting menu options. Service could have been better (we had to keep asking for water refills), but staff are helpful: they were kind enough to recommend alternate dishes as per our wants (gravy, no gravy and such), and were knowledgeable about the items on the menu. Good for a cozy eat out.

Food rating: 4.5/5
Service rating: 4/5
Ambience rating: 3.75/5

In pictures: Pork chops with mashed potatoes, and the Hazelnut Heaven cocktail.

Also try: Coq-au-vin

I have been to this place earlier and have been amazed by the food they serve. But my experience of visiting scores of restaurants over the years during Durga Puja warned that owing to the extreme rush most of them fail to meet their usual standards by far, including many who fail abysmally. ¬†So yesterday was Ashtami and ¬†when I entered the restaurant I had already made up my mind to expect a reduction in quality.

We ordered our all time favorites Dajaj Chermoula and Murg Kothmiri Kebab for starters, along with our usual Jack Daniels. The very moment me and my friend bit into the succulent chicken legs of Dajaj Chermoula, we understood that no, this place has not compromised on quality even with the pouring crowd! The Kothmiri Kebab was also delectable. For the main course, we ordered the Coq-Au-Vin. This is the first time we tried this and we loved it!

This place always delights me with their food and I would keep going back. Kudos to the Spice Kraft team!

Yes ! Culinary is the most satisfying art and they really kraft it well . went there with my girlfriend on the day of Mahaastami during durga puja . the place was little crowded so we had to wait for a while but the management were efficient enough to make our way to the table as fast as possible . the ambience was simple yet very warm and soothing which i found perfect for a date. Previously, we had found some durga puja special menu in zomato they were offering but it was not available at that moment as the complementary beer was out of their stock . so we decided to try a few √† la carte from their menu . we ordered beer can tempura fish which came with orange ponzu tartar√© for starter , Baked fish wellington and chicken Stoganoff for main course . and a cocktail named "painkiller" & one peg bourbon JB . the beer can tempura fish was awesome . the romance of crispy beer batter layer and melty soft fish core was impossible to describe in words . chicken stoganoff was great too but I found the fish wellington little bit salty . and the cocktail was OK. We wanted to have their another signature dish 100% jack Daniels mouss√® . but had to dishearten again as it was not available as well. And at the end of the lunch the manager came to all the visitors and thanked for waiting for that long and asked to visit them again which was really made me want to rate 5.1 . I hope I will visit them again to try other signature 'kraft'manships

Wow!! Where do i start?? Simply awesome. What an array of delicacies they have up their sleeves. Nothing short of magic. Every dish is just another mesmerizing magic trick. The rich flavors on offer just makes you awestruck. And they have this cool ambience with dimly lit lights. 

Food description: For starters we had their famous beer can tempura fish and lymwn samak. Too good. The tempura fish with the dip was smacking. Moving onto to the mains; we had shepherd's pie, fish wellington, coq-au-vin, dajaj chermoula, devilled crab meat and nasigoreng with green chilly chicken. The crab meat had such rich flavors and the meat just melts in your mouth. The chermoula had such juicy chicken served in small earthen pots. But the hero of the show was the shepherd's pie. Huge flavors but such a well balanced dish. The portions of this dish  also quite good. You get 2 bowls of pie served with garlic breads. Initially the staff said they weren't serving any desserts that day but after a bit of persuasion they brought us the Jack Daniels chocolate mousse. Another gem in the sack. The alcohol in it might feel a bit strong for a few but I like it this way. The choco mousse with the sponge cakes is a perfect combination. 

The service is pretty fast despite us going for a festive day(sashti) lunch. The staffs are very courteous. Though the prices may seem to be on the higher side but the food is worth paying for. A definite visit again place for me. If you love continental cuisine this place is a must for you.

The food is very diverse, well presented and reasonable. Dajaj Charmola is a must try in this place, you will love it.
Apart from that the cocktails are unique and very well made, lichitini is my favourite among the few i have tried. On top of that the quality of the food did not go down during Durga Puja(#nuffsaid).

We visited this place for soshti lunch. Lovely ambience, staff were polite and had a good knowledge of what they were serving.

Coming to the food we were a group of 7 and we ordered 2 fish starters ( Beer can tempura fish and another Lebanon fish) and Chicken dajaj chermoula. Every dish was cooked to perfection.
For mains, we ordered almost all continental dishes available on the puja special menu. Baked fish Wellington, shepherd's pie, deviled crab etc. Baked fish simply melted in my mouth. It was mouth-watering. Also one of my friend ordered Singapore rice which was good too.
For dessert, 100‚ÑÖ JD mousse was exceptional. I'll come back to SpiceKraft just for this.

One of the trending continental restaurant in the city right now. Awesome food once again.
Pocket pinch was 4200 INR.

After much await we finally checked in to Spice Kraft..the location being prime..when we reached we found that the electricity was gone and as we enter we found waiters with candles in hand standing at each table. Wonder why a much hyped restaurant doesn't have a generator. We had heard much about Dajaj Charmoula and Beer Tempura fish so was gonna order the same. How ever the waiter suggested for another fish dish. He even suggested for our main course. How ever he was not that good at all at suggesting.
Starters
Dajaj Charmoula (chicken was soft but pieces small.liked the way they served.)
Crispy fried chhili babycorn(good usual baby corn.crispy.)
And some fish tandoori(amazingly soft n melting in mouth fish preparation)
Drinks
Cucumber drink.(taste wiser smooth n nice but they spilled it all over the glass while bringing to the table)
Main course
Thai fried rice(the taste was good.very light suttle taste but towards the end what cane in the mouth in the very last spoon was egg shells along with the egg.not cool at all)
Lamb curry(lamb was perfectly tender how ever gravy was atad bit extra creamy which killed the over all taste)
The ambience is good. However if you are asking for a table for 2 then beaware that the table might be a little too small to even hold ur starters. The staff were not professional. They would stare at u while u eat. Keep standing by ur table side. Just not giving any sort of privacy to people.
Over all good experience though not a great one.
Will think twice before coming for the next time.

Visited Spicekraft on Panchami evening. As it was festive season they didn't have their regular menu, instead they had a set choices menu with selection of entees and mains. The bar menu was available although they were out of beer. We tried classic cosmopolitan and kool cucumber. The drinks were good on alcohol punch and very well priced. The show stealers however was the food.we had the beer can tempura fish, soy braised drums of heaven with old monk flambe and a fish entree whose name I forgot. All were above par in taste. Very well made. We also tried the devilled crab, which was loved by all. Good portions of crab meat with spices and cheese baked. The grilled fish with lemon butter sauce was also good although the fish pieces were on smaller sides.
Over all I would give the place a 4. And for sure will go back to taste from their regular menu and most importantly the molecular cocktails which they are so famous for.

Spicekraft serves you great food. And the platting is the cherry on the cake. We ordered beer can tempura fish, dajaj charmoula, devil crab meat, con au vin and the Jack Daniels mousse. Devil crab meat was the best!!!! But the mousse, tempura fish and the charmoula was nothing less(the chicken was sooo well cooked). But I found the con au vin to be ordinary and nothing special. Coming to the service, the staff were really polite and amicable. Our bill was 1416 which is quite affordable compared to the quality of food they offer. Spicecraft is a must visit for all. Great food. Good staff. Nice ambience. üòç

I had heard about this place from a lot of people but didn't get the chance to visit. So the golden opportunity came through a friend's birthday treat. The restaurant has an amazing ambience, with low lights and quite large seating area.Since ours was a preplanned dinner for 10 we had booked our table in advance. Now coming to what we ordered.
Entr√©e- Lymwn Samak
              Murg reshmi Malabi
Mains- Lucknowi dum Biriyani
              Murg da mokul
Drinks- Fresh lime soda

The food was just out of the world especially the entr√©es. The Lebanese fish preparation Lymwn Samak deserves special mention because the fish was cooked to utmost perfection. The Biriyani was a bit different(in a good way :p) in taste compared to the classic Biriyani we are accustomed too. And the Punjabi side that we ordered was also good.The portions are quite alright and the Biriyani has two meat portions,one egg and an aloo ‚ù§ 
The staff is very courteous and patient ( we were quit demanding) and what came as a lovely surprise was there famous 100‚ÑÖ Jack Daniel mousse given to us complimentary. And also the chef came to meet us which was a very sweet gesture.
So overall it was a really good experience and I will definitely visit this place again with my family.

My favorite dining place in Kolkata, a very cool restaurant with a very classy touch, classy crowd and of course classy food.
The Beer can Tempura Fish has to be the one to start your dinner with, a very well balanced delicacy.
Lymwn Samak, an Arabic grilled fish preparation we had as starter, was again a hit. Arabic spices with lemon did a tantalizing magic on the grilled fish.
Followed by Nasi Goreng and Roasted Chili Pork, all the dishes , as per my taste were just perfect.
Will come back for their Arabic and Classical delicacies.

Hello foodies. I feel so enthusiastic jotting down my wonderful experience with spicekraft .
It had been in my wishlist for a long time, and finally visited there last week on my friend's birthday.
The restaurant is located near ballygunje science college. Some renovation work was going on, so we were given to seat in the inner section. It was dimly lit and decorated with paintings inside. The outside was howevee having yellow lights with nice decoration as well.
The starters are their uniqueness and so we decided to take two of them
BACARDI LIMON INFUSED TANDOORI CHICKEN SAUSAGE - brilliant preparation and presentation.
BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH- again no words.
Then we ordered
CHILLY GARLIC NOODLES- the noodles were kind of sticky ,a little different but no wonder yummy again
CHICKEN IN CHILLY OYESTER- it was okayish
Lastly we ordered
100% JACK DANIELS & BARE CALLEBAUT SWISS- it was served wih petit fours (small bite sized confectionery) which contained the alcohol and chocolate mousse.
Every single dish symbolised their creativity and their art of fusion. Kudos to the chef! This restaurant has a long way to go.
A proud addition to the city of the joy.
Price is very reasonable.
In my next visit, I'll target the remaining starters :D
Their food can't be missed ‚ô°

Well..well..well..this place is very different from the usual restaurants. From the name of the dishes to the tastes of each item to the ambience. 
Me and my mom went there last week for dinner. The ambience is beautiful. Wine bottles, soothing music, dim lights ‚ô• Now coming to the food. We ordered Dajaj Charmoula, beer can tempura fish and baked fish wellington. All the items were very tasty but I personally loved the baked fish wellington. It was bhetki fish with cream and cheese layers on it. Now coming to the service, it was not good at all. I read reviews about their good services but trust me it wasnt good at all. The waiters were confused. They dunno how to prepare the table.They were laughing among each other seeing the customers. I dunno how the management keep these kinda people for the services. My ratings are only based on the food and ambience.

This is probably the best experimental cuisine restaurant I have ever visited in Kolkata. The chef has quite a lot experience in various cuisines of Continental Europe, Middle & Far East, and India. All you got to eat here is the outcome of successful experiments of those cuisines.

We were a group of 10 and we headed there for the first time to validate the appreciation we were hearing about this restaurant for quite some time. As a result, we tried variety dishes n drinks, as I've described below. The ambiance is also quite good and peaceful. Only con is that the place is a bit small for such a restaurant. So my suggestion is to reserve seats before you go there.

Starters:
----------------------
# Bacardi Limon Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausage - Chicken sausages infused with a dropper of Bacardi limon. The blueberry & churan sauce provided with it was awesome. Must try.
# Beer Can Tempura - most sought after starter. Tempura fish fried in beer batter.
# Baby Octopus Salt & Pepper¬†- For seafood lovers. Yummy.
# Squid Rings in Butter Garlic¬†- For seafood lovers. Yummy.
# Deviled Crab Meat - Pure delicacy. Delicious cream and cheese baked crab meat.
# Dajaj Chermoula - The best of the lot. Four grilled chicken leg pieces to long for. Must try. 

Main Course:
----------------------
# Caq-au-vin - Chicken and mushroom in red wine juice served with butter rice and garnished with oregano. Should try.
# Shepherd's Pie - Two lamb pies comes with butter garlic breads. Though its a British classic, a Lasagna lover will always appreciate it. Must try.
# Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce¬†- Quite good. It comes with butter rice.
# Mixed Fried Rice along with Chicken Manchurian
# Mutton Biriyani

Boozerts (Alcoholic Deserts):
----------------------
# Jack Daniels Chocolate Mousse - Chocolate mousse mixed with Jack Daniels. It comes with petit fours (four pieces of small cakes). The chocolate mousse alone is a bit bitter, but when eaten with the petit fours, it is absolute delicious. Should Try.
# Dark Fudge Torte - This is another alcoholic dessert and again a bit bitter due to the presence of alcohol & dark chocolate.

Drinks:
----------------------
# Blue Electric - Vodka with blue curacao.
# Kokum Rita - Absolutely good cocktail based on tequila. Those who likes light cocktails must try it.
# The Hammerjack - The strongest. Those who want a hit, must try it.
# Bellini - Classic sparkling wine based Italian delicacy.
# Sangria - Another classic red wine based cocktail.
# Michelada - For beer lovers.
# LIIT - Quite strong and beautiful. 
# The Cranapple Driver - Screwdriver redefined with, cranberry & pineapple juice. Must Try.

Date of Visit : 11/09/2016

Location : Located near Hazra Law College, opposite Quadra, walking distance from ballygunge phari.

Ambiance : From outside the restaurant, we were hesitant in entering it. But as we enter, it was a difference world. Quite a good seating capacity with restaurant divided into three sections. 

Service : Excellent service with owner cum chef attending us personally.

Food & Description : This place owned by chef sampat who is also the head chef here. We went there after hearing so many good reviews from our friends. We were told that we should try their brunch menu. When I checked zomato, I couldn‚Äôt find any such menu. When I called the restaurant, they were also unaware of the menu and I was told that chef himself designs the menu as per your liking. I was excited to hear that. When I reached the place, I was greeted well and escorted to my table. Then Chef Sampat came and attended us. It marks the starting of a tremendously beautiful food journey. He asked for our likings and dislikings and crafted our menu accordingly. He gave and idea of each and every he will be serving. He explained each and every item after serving. Also took the review after we finished each item. It was an amazing experience. Coming to the food in the order of how they were served ‚Äì

Cucumber Cooler (Welcome Drink) - A perfect refreshing punch of cucumber juice with a mix of chaat masala topped with chopped cucumber and coriander stem. Amazing taste and a wonderful start to the food journey.

Kele-ke-Phool ke Croque Monsieur ‚Äì This dish is chef‚Äôs signature dish. It is one of the best starter I have ever had. A complete different dish with excellent flavours. A highly recommended dish.

Crispy Chilli Baby corn And Mushroom on Bread ‚Äì Crispy chilli baby corn was crispy and tasty. Was not served that hot to my liking. Mushrooms melted in mouth and was mouth watering.

Tangarita ‚Äì It a non alcoholic mocktail which is a fusion of Orange juice and Pineapple juice with green chilly and club soda. It was a perfect fusion of sweet and spiciness. 

Paneer Dum Nisha ‚Äì First bite of paneer dum nisha gives you a royal feel. A very well plated dish. Paneer was mouth melting and it has a filling of nuts and chillies. Excellent dish.

Veg Lasagne ‚Äì Veg lasagne had an amazing flavour. Its layers were soft. In most restaurants the layers of lasagne gets chewy. But it was perfect here. Right amount of cheese and perfect baking added feather to this wonderful dish. Again it was little high of spiciness to my liking.

Indian Platter ‚Äì Indian platter comprised of Pudina lacchha paratha, kashmiri paratha, dal makhani (maa ki dal) and paneer bhuji. Pudina laccha paratha was crisp and tasty. Kasmiri paratha was sweet and went well with dal makhani as it was little spicy. Amazing combination. Excellent platter.

Kiwi & Mango Collins - A blossom-type drink which was a mix of Cranberry, mango and kiwi juice topped with Hazelnut-flavored cream was served in a tall glass. Little high on sweet but was likeable. 

Desert Platter ‚Äì It comprised of bakhlava & toffee ice cream. Both the items were top notch. A perfect end to the food journey. Excellent presentation. Recommended.

Spice Kraft is a Molecular Gastronomic fare and with trend of people liking Molecular Gastronomy, this place is here to stay. Excellent food and platting. Best part is the chef pampering you and asking for the likes and dislikes and preparing food accordingly. I will highly recommend this place. Also try their brunch, you will never regret.

I went to Spice Kraft for dinner last week with family. I had a lot of recommendations that this place is a must try for all foodies. And my visit has made a full fledged fan of this restobar.

The restobar is divided into three parts. Usually due to a good seating capacity, finding a table even on a busy day is not an issue. Interiors are simple but the food is definitely extraordinary. The icing on the cake is the personal attention and suggestions by the chef himself to each table.

I visited twice last week as one visit left me craving for more.

We ordered

Starters :
Doodhiyan Kebab
Kele ke phool ke croque monsieur
Paneer Dum Nisha

Main course:
Safed Moradabadi dal
Kofta Nazukdil
Benarsi Tikka Aloo dum
Sabz Lababdar

Breads:
Zafrani Shirmal
Garlic Naan
Masala Kulcha
Pudina parantha

Pasta in Mixed Sauce
Cantonese Pan fried noodles
Vegetarian Nasi Goreng

Dessert
100% Jack Daniels
Classic Monte Carlo

Cocktails

The food here is amazing both in terms of presentation and taste. And a visit is highly recommended to the food connoisseurs.

Each of the starters were a visual treat with distinct flavours. The Kele ke phool croque monsieur was a real delight with the banana flower roundels topped with pineapple and cheese.

The Paneer Dum Nisha is also very much recommended.

Coming to the main course , the Safed Moradabadi dal was excellent, something I can keep going back to Spice Kraft for.

The Benarsi dum aloo was yummy, the other two vegetables were ok. The kofta was too sweet for our taste.

The breads are really good. The zafrani shirmal is a sweet flaky bread, I really liked the taste though one can't have much of it at once.

International main course wise the Cantonese pan fried noodles were really good.
The pasta in mixed sauce was a let down.

The nasi goreng gets brownie points. We got the veg version made on request. A plate of flavour ful rice topped with sweet chilli flavoured puchkas.

The Monte carlo was average. The 100 % Jack Daniels was a great mix of alcohol , chocolate and citrus flavours. Superb texture and a delicious dessert.

The cocktail menu is impressive. You can ask the servers for recommendations.

All these fancy names, gourmet food and delightful flavours at prices that don't pinch your pocket at all.

I went there a couple of weeks back when a friend referred this place to me. Definitely, I was not disappointed. I tried their Beer can Tempura fish (which they actually serve in a beer can, and a nice orange sauce), devilled crab meat (worth a try!) and Dajaj Chermoula ( each peice of chicken is served in an individual cup with flavors and a peice of wood in it, very creative!). I would go to this place again for their food and they serve (which is really special!). I deducted 1 point just as the place was somehow not smelling nice near the washroom area of the restaurant as soon as we entered. That initially did no give me a good vibe about the place. But we were made to sit in another section which was alright. Decor-wise its decent. But after ordering for the food we all felt nice with their service. It might have been a bad day for them somehow. So I hope the management takes a note of it. Overall I'm definitely going there again. And you guys must be there too! Best wishes Team Spice kraft! Keep up the creativity!
Happy eating :)

The Spice Kraft is located near Ballygaunge Phari on Hazra Road.The interiors are beautifully decorated and the music was also soothing.The moment you enter,you get an amazing romantic ambience and it stole our heart completely.

Coming to the food,for the starter we ordered the famous Beer Can Tempura Fish which was beautifully served on a beer batter inside a beer can.It tasted fabulous.The dip was also mouth watering.

Among the drinks,we ordered Choco Beam which was Jim Beam Bourbon Whiskey combined with chocolate syrup.We really enjoyed the drink.

For the mains,we went for Continental cuisine and ordered Shepherd's Pie which was lamb served in two bowls with a thick cheese layer.We also took Chicken Stoganoff which was a plate full of mayonnaise  and chicken.Both were served with garlic bread and both tasted equally amazing.
For the dessert,we took the highly recommended 100% Jack Daniels chocolate mousse.But unlike the other dishes which were really good,this was average.It was not that good and not that bad even.Still,it was a good ending.

The staff was courteous and we enjoyed our time there.

Will be visiting again to try their Asian cuisine. :) :)

'Spice Kraft' is located at Hazra road, just entrance from Ballygunje phari.I've visited here two weeks ago with my lover & friends for dinner.First of all the ambience of this restaurant is good,well decoration with low light & ¬†music.Atfirst we ordered here Lebanese Starter - 'Dajaj Chermoula',four pieces juicy chicken legs served with separate small glass,presentation is attractive.Then we have tasted here Chef's Signature Starter - 'Beer Can Tempura Fish,Orange Ponzu Tartare',it is delicious.We also tasted here Kebab Starter - 'Murg Zarka Tikka',it is too much spicy,don't try it.We took some mocktails like ¬†'Virgin Mojito','Rainbow', & 'Cucumber Cooler'.All mocktalis are tasty,specially Cucumber Cooler is fantastic.Then we ordered 'Murg Da Mokul','Tandoori Rooti','Laccha Paratha', & 'Nawabi Dum Ki Murg' as main course.Murgh Da Mokul is delicious,others are average tasty.Atlast we'va tasted their alcoholic desserts like 'Cointrue,Orange & White Chocolate Parfait,Dark Fudge Torte', 'Classic Monte Carlo' & ¬†'100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse,Drunken Petit Fours'.Jack Daniels Mousse is mouth watering & unique concept.Price is little expensive.Staffs are friendly.The negative point of this restaurant is there is no water in the toilet,its so embarrassing.

Spice Kraft was an amazing experience. Their cocktails were delectable. Food was good. However, Suon Nuong from Vietnam and the classic Shepherd's pie won our hearts,taste buds and tummy! 
Add to good food,a courteous and well-informed staff,lovely  background music and beautiful interiors- sounds like a complete dinner,right? That is not the last on your plate!!! The chef is an amazing person who comes around and interacts with the customers which made me feel special and cared for. Also the complimentary toffee that they give with the meal is unique and amazing
I'd recommend this place for date nights as well as for a friends' re-union as well as family times.

Finally made it here tonight to celebrate the husband s birthday. What a delightful place. I have rarely reviewed and scored q place 5 but  Food is so well presented that you almost feel bad to ruin it by eating. We started with chicken which was served in individual pots and were so good that we ordered another serving. Then followed the fish which was mildly spiced and a lovely tangy prawn. Loved the butter garlic squid too though it had a bit of gravy and  I would have preferred a drier consistency. The Bombay duck had mixed reactions across the table. It's a hit and miss depending on whether you like loitha to begin with. If you don't like don't then stay clear. I loved it though because it was spiced just right ! 
Our mains came in just in time and again were delightful. Chicken in oyster sauce. 2 thumbs up!! The nasi goreng was more Indianised then I prefer, but was spicy. Ordered some masala kulcha and Pudina parathas and that was a hit too. 
Dessert was a the JD platter which was recommended to us by our server. Completely bowled over by the JD infused mousse and the cointreau soaked sponges served with an orange reduction. Also very grateful to the management for scrambling up a birthday cake for us at short notice. 
This is one of the best places to eat in the city now , and you only need to meet the cordon bleu trained chef sambit to understand why. Excellent service and presentation, and finally brings a mature global taste to your plate. This place also has a liquor licence so happy you.
I can't fault this restaurant on food but only suggestion is to get rid of the blue lights. The room outside looks and feels far more propah and fine dining, then the the family room. The blue LEDs make it look a little bar like and so dull that I could barely read the menu. You guys have such wonderful things on the table I would just like to see it better with brighter lights. 
Looks like I am coming back for more soon , specially all the molecular gastronomic delights which the menu hints at.

We started with a beer can fried fish tempura and a lymwn samak. The latter simply melts in your mouth while the former is probably the best thing to ever come out of a beer can.
I ordered a lobster coq - a - vin while my mates ordered the chicken variant, both delicious. We finished with a 100 percent jack daniels and had a 'ratatouille - anton ego' moment, it was that beautiful. Although we knew exactly what we wanted the staff were really polite in reccomending their specialities. The decor is really innovative as well. A bit expensive but worth every cent.

So we landed to this place on a Sunday evening to grab some snacks! I did not find the place enchanting enough . .. as it was getting renovated! The seating is a little outdated as compared to many other similar restaurants. . Coming to food we ordered :
Mix sauce spaghetti- a little extra sweet but the cheese balanced the sweetness. .
Veg Galouti Kebab- a little dry and did not taste great!
Chilli mushrooms- was good and mushrooms were fresh and nicely cooked.
Long island iced tea- nice too
100% Jack Daniels-a signature dish and truely an amazing one... this is a dessert where you get Jack Daniel flavoured mousse + sponge cake soaked in the same with a mango tangy sauce! A different take on a desert!
Overall my experience here was average.. but the dessert did lift up the points!

Ambience is descent! It looks a very small place from outside but it is actually quite big from inside.
Mocktails are really good, try anything.
We could not eat much as only 2 of us went, but green chilly chicken as starters was really good and different. We ordered white cheese pasta, and I would suggest not to order that as it was too dry for a pasta, though it tasted fine.
Everybody recommends mutton here, so do try that. I do not eat mutton, so did not order the same.
Price is also not too much for any dish!!

I would rate this place 5 out of 5. Located beside the building next to HDFC Bank near the Ballygunj Phari crossing - the ambiance is elegant with dim colorful lighting and the stacked wine bottles. The staffs are courteous and friendly. Would recommend all the food lovers to visit this place. Ordered fried beer batterred fish served in a half open beer budwiser can and Sheperd's Pie which was mouth watering and delicious. I got amazed by the way they serve the food and last but not the least to my surprise the rates are very very reasonable. Will visit this place again and again

Heaven on earth...a place where u will find perfect blend of taste and quality..I am still dreaming about the food there..went back twice before due to non availability of seats..so this place was a mandatory one on my head..
On a weekday lunch went to spice kraft after so much of hush hush among friends..totally vacant it was at around 1 pm..the ambience is wonderful..very well decorated and dimly lit..this was an all fish day for us..Ordered all the fish preparations and all were mind blowing.
Ordered the famous beer batter tempura fish..I swear I will come here every time for this one item..it's simply out of the world..crispy juicy bhetki marinated in beer batter served inside a budweiser can..along with tarter sauce..simply amazing.
Baked fish wellington.Another awesome fish item... grilled fish topped with oodles of cheese and mushroom sauce..served with a small portion of yellow pulao...and moulting mushrooms..this will set ur foodgasm..heavenly..cheesy..yummy!
Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce..Another fish item..equally good..served with buttered rice in small portion..2 pieces of fish grilled and topped with lemon sauce..and boiled veggies.
Among cocktails..I had a Screwdriver.. classic orange with sage..it was not at all good..but the food was so tasty..that I forgot the misery of cocktail.
A must go for every month! Waiting eagerly for the next visit ..

Wow!!!
Beautiful place...
We went there today for lunch...
Omg..what a delectable food and such presentation was mesmerising.The ambience is so soothing.The decor was beautiful once you enter you will find wine bottles kept so nicely and mirrors every where.
The staff was courteous enough.
Coming to the food we ordered tempura fish and dajaj chormoula first as starters with tangerita which is a special virgin mojito(spice Kraft version)..service was good enough..it took around 10mins to serve the same..it was hot and yummy..The chicken was so tender..it was very juicy.. just perfectly cooked..the fish was also good..crispy outside and the fish was fresh enough..both were served with Dips.
It was strange but we were full by that time..but still wanted to try the main course..We ordered chicken haka and chicken chilli soya..
It was nicely prepared.
And none of the dishes could disappoint us.
We couldn't order the desserts as we were already full.
Overall it was a great experience.
Will definitely visit again
And will love to try their dishes and desserts.

What was once a branch of Silver Oak ¬†became Tandoori Nights has now given way to Spice Kraft. This establishment is around a year old. Though I never got to try their drinks on my first visit today, thanks to my cold, the food and the service were perfect. We entered a little after 12, a bit apprehensive since it was a little before our usual lunch hour and the place was deserted but the one staff who was standing near the computer who was eventually our server Amrito welcomed us with a smile. We were given the menu and we went on to order, mainly based on the suggestions he offered, three starters being Dajaj Charmoula, Beer Can Tempura Fish and Devilled Crab. In one word "amazing". If I had to choose I would probably leave out the fish next time as I think it would go well with drinks. In the main course we had Subz ki Tehri with Laal Maas which was spiced down as we had requested. In the meantime the chef Mr. Sambit Banick came out to greet us and went on to ask if this was our first visit and that he hoped to live up to our expectations!! The main course was delightful and since I love spicy food I was very happy. In dessert, something we hardly ever order, we had Orange Glazed & Honey Tossed Darsaan with Toffee Ice Cream. My mother who accompanied me was so mighty impressed with the food specially the dessert that once the bill arrived she promptly announced that this is the only place where she will eat when she dines out. I tip my hat for the chef and the service and the sheer genius that reflects in the food. Wish to rate it 4.75 and will be back again for more.

This is a great place for food.They really take the hospitality part seriously. The chef makes sure he meets most of the guest possible.We ordered the sangrila and chivas julep for drinks and beer can fish and devilled crabs.We also had deconstructed papri chaat which was really good.The main course was also nice but starters were better.

Went there for a casual dinner with friends. Interior ambience is really cool n classy. Now regarding the food, not only the item names in menu sounds different but they taste also different than other contemporary continental dishes. They were helpful in choosing items as we were the first time visitor. Foods were so delicious. Also noticed the serving style kinda attractive. Love to visit again.

what to say my expectation was too high as because rating was very good but not so good what i was expected from them. sorry to say that.

As soon I entered they provided us a table and that was not clean as it was in the eve so it was not crowded. ordered for drums of heaven and it was really good then for main course ordered for moon rice and schezwan chicken. Rice taste good but chicken was bit salty.

Thumbs up
1) Interior was very good

Thumbs Down
1) staff service

Tucked away in Hazra Road,you get lip-smacking food at reasonable prices.
To top that,they serve exhilarating cocktails..
Try the following-
Dajaj chermoula( Lebanese style chicken )
Beer can tempura fish
Laal mas (mutton in gravy-Rajasthani dish)

The restaurant was quite full when we reached around 9 p.m. We got in after waiting 20 minutes. We ordered coq au vin, nasi goreng and pork in red hendang curry. It was our first time tasting these items , so can't compare. But I loved what we had. The coq au vin had delicate subtle flavors and almost melted in the mouth. The pork was great with the nasi goreng. A nice experience overall.

Spice Kraft is one of the first places that I visited based on reviews on Zomato and I must say that I was highly impressed ever since my very first visit. Needless to say, there have been many more visits ever since. If I think about the first time that I visited this place which was around 5 months ago and compare it to my latest visit which was 2 weeks ago, I must say that the place has maintained its high standard if not become even better! 

For starters, the place from outside is pretty underwhelming in my opinion, however when you enter through the door you get the idea of what you're getting into. I love the beautiful wine bottle arrangement and it is the first thing that grabs your attention. 

Considering the numerous visits that I have made to this place, I have tried many of the appetizers, many of their mocktails, quite a few main courses and certainly their most famous desert the hundred percent Jack Daniels Mousse. A brief description is as follows :

Kiwi and Mango Collins - this is a really refreshing mocktail which is quite tantalizing to the taste buds and I love the flavour of the Kiwi and the mango together.

Tangarita - this is also a really refreshing drink with orange juice and Green Chili and I absolutely love it. Really innovative and exciting. 

Deconstructed Papdi Chat - it's a  part of their molecular mocktails. This was a really really impressive drink or should I call it dish since I had to eat it! It is really surprising but in a good way and the explosion of the bubble unleashes true delight! I have definitely never had anything of that kind ever before!

Pina Colada 2050- now this is one of the molecular mocktails which I had been wanting to try since my very first visit but could not do so due to lack of availability until my latest visit! This has to be my favorite of all the drinks and dishes combined! This is mostly because I absolutely love a wonderful Pina Colada and adding molecular gastronomy  just took it to a whole different level.


Tandoori Chicken Sausages - I found this dish really innovative and beautifully presented. I loved the sausages because they were moist and succulent. This in my opinion is a must try for all who are comfortable with spicy and hot flavours however not so suitable for those with a milder flavour preference. 

Beer Battered Fish - Deemed to be their speciality, this dish did not fail to impress me and certainly lived up to its billing! Again, a very unique presentation and perfectly crispy fish along with perfectly light and crispy batter along with perfectly flaky fish makes a perfect dish with no complaints whatsoever!

Squid Rings - This is so far the one and only place that I have tried Squid and I absolutely loved it! I was quite apprehensive about whether I would like it or not but I must say it was one of my most enticing experiences so far! Needless to say I have ordered it many times subsequently!

Devilled Crab - I love seafood but crab to me is a treat which I do not eat on a regular basis. The crab just like all their other dishes was beautifully presented and looked really appetizing! However it was too rich to my liking (and by rich what I mean is that there was just a little too much of cheese for my liking). Its quantity seems less but it's fairly heavy so the portion is just right! 

Lobster Thermidor - Lobster is also another dish which I do not order quite often but given the wonderful experience I had with the seafood here I could not resist myself and I was pleasantly surprised with the dish because even though it was seemingly quite similar to the devil crab, I liked it more as I could taste the flavour of the lobster and not just the dense layer of cheese on top. The dish is  served with rice and vegetables and is a perfect meal for one. 

Coq au Vin - A French classic cooked to perfection and in my opinion a perfect sized portion for one as a main course. I loved the chicken and the wonderful sauce made using red wine. The rice by itself was also flavoursome and everything about this dish was flawless! 

Grilled Fish - Unfortunately I do not remember the name of the dish but it was grilled fish with a lemon based sauce with garlic along with rice and yet again, just like all the other dishes so far, this impressed me a lot and left me craving for more!

Moon Fan Rice - this dish was relatively underwhelming compared to all the fabulous dishes that I have had. My major problem with this was the excessive amount of pepper which dominated the flavour in my opinion and even though it wasn't half bad, when I compare it  to all the other dishes that I  have tried this has to be one of the least impressive.

Cantonese Noodles -  I love the Cantonese noodles served at Golden Dragon in Park Street and I decided to try it out here as well. Needless to say the dish was pretty good though I must add I still prefer the one at Golden Dragon more but then again that is a Chinese Cuisine Restaurant whereas this place serves global cuisine and it was a really high quality dish! 

Biryani -  Now this was certainly the least impressive of them all. The Biryani was very average and we found it to be a little sweet which wasn't quite pleasant. Perhaps it is meant to be sweet but we just did not find it pleasant enough.

Chocolate Fondant - I love anything made with chocolate and the fondant here was quite a treat! It was well cooked and looked stunning! 

100% Jack Daniels Chocolate Mousse - Their signature dessert is something which you just cannot miss! It is absolutely delicious! I loved the alcoholic flavour in the mousse which wasn't too overpowering but not too mild altogether either. A must try dish for all! 

The service here is a tad slow but that has no real repercussions as such because the food just hits the ball out of the park! The staff is quite courteous and if you are lucky, the chef would most likely be present to guide you through so that you make the most of all the offerings. 

The place is a must try as it serves spectacular food with a wide variety of cuisines which makes for an enticing culinary experience and that too at fairly reasonable prices! 


Happy Dining!!

We visited this place last Saturday.. When we reach there was a queue, so we had to wait for half an hour to get our turn.. Inside the restaurant ambience was good and cozy.. Waiters were very friendly.. You hardly need to wait for the food once you placed the order.. Food was delicious though in my opinion food options were not very elaborated.. But whatever we ordered were really delicious..

One of the first pitstops in Kolkata on my last trip. Wasn't expecting much from the outside. How could you, with a million restaurants around, all looking the same.. Similar names, cool logos and mostly putting out similar dishes cooked by someone you don't even know. Thankfully the similarities ended soon and with a surprise. Not a big fan of the interiors though and probably with the kind of food on the menu even the interior designers would be confused on how to lay things out. Molecular Gastronomy is what I got curious about after going through the menu and having a regular visitor with us meant the chef was more than happy to come out of the kitchen for a chit chat and a couple of recommendations on what to drink and what to eat. He knows his food and he probably figured us out too in the last 5 minutes of our conversation. Ended up having almost everything from chicken burrah kebabs to a rack of ribs to soft shell crabs, gulping it all down with a variety of beer and bourbon based cocktails. It's OK coz I don't even remember the names of most of the items I had. Blame it on the complicated names or the good looking food in front of us but please trust the recommendations everytime if you're lucky enough to meet the amazingly talented and witty chef. He's basically a mad food scientist and even looks like one. Definitely visiting again and highly recommended for someone who wants to try something new or even the usuals. Portion sizes are good and so are the prices. All in all a matured dining experience it was... I hate the blue lights in the seating area inside though. Kinda makes the food looks weird. The food needs to be seen and if you are sitting in the room inside all you get is blue colored chicken and prawns.. Thanks to the hideously placed blue lighting in the room.

First look at the restaurant gives a good feeling about it.The waiters smile and provide a seat. The d√©cor is beautiful. Some of the food items are too costly but worth the taste and quality. We ordered Dajaj chermoula- a chicken dish, lymwn samak- a grilled fish dish, kokhn rita, and jack Daniels boozert- an alcoholic dessert.. The food items are unique and taste amazing.the chicken was soft and so was the fish,just melts in the mouth..the dessert won our hearts.It was nice to see the chef meeting the customers and interacting with them. However the service started to deteriorate as the waiters arrived with the dessert and the drink after quite a long time.It was a bit turn off.. Otherwise really a great experience and will highly recommend the place.

This evening was all about food and drinks. The Cranapple and the Spicy Pomegranate cocktails weren't a major go-for, however, the beer can fish tempura and the lebanese chicken took us by surprise. The Lobster Thermidor, as I expected, was supposed to be something else but anyway, it was a delightful evening altogether. We were served with utmost care and affection, without any delay or hesitation.

This is one of those restaurants that puts in a lot of efforts to serve good food, that too at a price that is competitive. The kebabs are very succulent, the Shepherd's Pie is a must try and the desserts are interesting. Moreover, the ambience is cozy with the d√©cor tastefully done. Overall, it's a place I'll come back to with friends and family.

Heading to quest mall from Gariahat.. At ballygunje phari turn left.. Just a few blocks and one of the best of South Kolkata is there. They must look for a bigger outlet soon . Sober ambience and awesome food quality. So many variations yet you won't be lost at options.. Tried beer fish tempura reading reviews but felt that average.. Rather tried a Lebanese chicken starter which was delicious. The restro boys are cool.. They just don't serve you well.. But suggest splendid selections. Then comes the pricing and its just PERFECT. Its a must go.

I will keep the review short and simple

The environment is homely, the range is good. The non vegetarian spread is awesome. The Octopus dish is a must try and it is rare to find it at such prices anywhere else. Coq au Vin is a must here! Also, the deserts are heavenly. A great place for a warm and comfortable dinner. The menu has continental flavors along with Indian regulars and it doesn't pinch your pockets!

There are a bunch of restaurants in Kolkata where you get good food, but good hospitality is very difficult to find. ¬†Spice Kraft is indeed the place one should go to if one wants a warm bonding ¬†with the staff and if one wants to know extensively about the kind of food that they have ordered. The staff team is oh so welcoming! The place is perfect for all age groups.¬†The menu is something which needs intricate study. The detailing in the menu is really helpful. Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Lebanese or signature continental delights, name it and you have it! ¬†One of the many appreciable things about Spice Kraft is the complex cooking methods like sous vide machine and molecular gastronomy methods. ¬†Apart from the variety in the menu, which is the best part about the place, it is also to be noted that everything in the menu is affordable.

Among cocktails, we had:
Tangarita : It was a combination of orange juice, pineapple juice and club soda. The green chilly added the twist to the drink and made it enjoyable. You have this amazing sensation in your mouth when the sweetness of the juices is combined with a hint of hot green chilly.

Appetizers:
Beer can Tempura fish: The fish was served in a very attractive manner, in a beer can. It was crispy on the outside due to the beer batter and juicy on the inside. This was one of the chef's special dishes and i am very sure it will win all hearts. The orange ponzu tartare that is served as a dip tastes equally good.

Dajaj Chermoula: An authentic Lebanese dish. The chicken was char grilled and was very tender.

Main course:

Shepherd's pie: An old british classic. The dish contained baked minced lamb with creamed mashed potato crust in two cups and butter garlic bread. The lamb and the creaminess of the mashed potato was a perfect combination. You take a spoonful and it melts in your mouth!¬†

Chicken Stoganoff: The Russian favourite was not tampered with. Go for it if you are a cream lover.

Nasi goreng; The national dish of Indonesia. The rice was not at all spicy, all the flavours intact and served two people.

Shredded lamb in masaman curry: This dish was truly tangylicious! The consistency of the curry was perfect to be teemed with the rice and the tangy smell of the lime leaves added the extra flavour.

Dessert:

100% Jack Daniels mousse: ¬†The dessert stole the show! Chef and owner ¬†Mr. Sambit presented this as a complementary dessert. He himself explained the use of liquid nitrogen to fuse the swiss chocolate and the jack daniels.¬†

The experience at Spice Kraft was amazing. Sambit's one on one interaction with his customers made the experience all the more enjoyable. I have already referred Spice Kraft to all my friends and would love to frequent this place from now on.

The Spice Kraft. Have been seeing this place for a long time at ballygunge  phari, but never got a chance to visit that. So finally last week we did, and believe me you will just be mesmerized. The ambience is truly out of the world. Low dim light , with small things and bottles decorated the whole place. 

Ordered coq au vin. Its the best continental food i ever had. The french delicacy had a good amount pf cheese which made it mouth watering.. taste was awesome. Apart from that we also ordered a snack which comes in a beer can. The fish was very much soft. 

Truly a wonderful place for food lovers.

Went for lunch and tried 3 dishes. Two of them - Lobster Thermidor and Shepherds Pie were excellent. Was nice to be served by a familiar person (who was at Bohemian earlier) who was very attentive and courteous. The choices on the menu will require many more visits to do justice to the place.
The only reason I may hesitate to go again is the musty smell in the air which was not pleasant. If someone from the restaurant assures me this has been taken care of, I will return very soon.

A Fine dandy place! Went there last week, they have an interesting menu , ranging from continental to Indian to oriental. 

For starters we ordered Lynn Samak  which is a Lebanese grilled fish preparation. It was lip -smacking !
For the main course :
We went with the Indonesian rice - Nasi Goren which was fabulous, it's similar to a Chinese chicken fried rice but spicier ! Along with the same we had Hunan chicken was average.

But the best part of our meal was the dessert, on the suggestion from the restaurant we went with the Callebout which is prepared with alcohol ( Jack Daniels) and chocolate.

Oh and they make superb mocktails as well !

Will definitely be back !

I have visited this place twice and planning to visit again as soon as possible. Well, this review of mine is going to consist of the experiences gathered on both the occasions.
From outside it looks very simple and the decoration inside is quite impressive. The staffs here are helpful.
The menu offers various interesting items and one has to keep coming back for unveiling the tastes and stories behind all of them.
On the first visit we had tried dajaj chermoula (suggested by the staffs) and beer can tempura fish as starters;
poulet-cog-au-vin, shepherd's pie, baked fish Wellington, squid rings, murgh ka mokul for main course.
All of them except the dajaj chermoula,poulet-cog-au vin and squid rings seemed extraordinary to my taste buds. Dajaj chermoula seemed nothing special to me. It was nothing more than a normal chicken reshmi kebab with an extraordinary name and presentation.
I wanted my best friend to try the beer can tempura fish and baked fish Wellington. So we paid a visit there again. The staffs were very welcoming and also explained the ingredients to us for each of the item we had ordered. This time we tried one mocktail- blue frappe and one cocktail - the cranapple driver with Smirnoff. Both of them were good.
We had the beer can tempura fish again. It tasted as beautiful as before.
But I was highly disappointed by the main courses, baked fish Wellington had a weird egg like smell this time. It was not edible at all. The shepherd's pie was way too salty. With the help of the garlic bread we managed to complete only half of it.
Now the best part was the dessert.. the 100% jack Daniel mousse with drunken petit fours!!!!! It had an out of the world taste. I had never tasted something so unique and beautiful before.
We'll keep going back there for the Beer can tempura fish and the jack Daniel mousse again and again.

After hearing much about d awesome food here,finally went there on a lazy Sunday afternoon & it has truly lived up to d expectation. Each n every dish was delectable. Have opted for the kiwi mango cooler,Dajaj Chermoula, Bacardi limon infused chicken sausages, Baked fish Wellington & Coq Au Vin. Dajaj chermoula: the chicken was perfectly cooked & soft & tender. The Bacardi Limon infused chicken sausages had a certain amount of zing,it was spicy & something very new for the taste palate & I completely loved it.Coming to the main course was completely blown away by the awesomeness of Baked Fish Wellington & Coq Au Vin. The food portions are sufficient & it's reasonable too.All in all a new place for continental food & I would love to visit it again

Having heard a lot about this place, mostly word of mouth, I decided to check this place. So took my family for a dinner yesterday. Location wise it's quite easy to find, as its in Hazra Road just after ballygunge phari!!
The interiors were smartly done with the dining space divided into 3 areas, we sat in one of the rooms. The menu , both bar as well as food were quite exhaustive and elaborate. With a bit of help from the service boy we ordered a mocktail named Tangerita, an interesting cocktail named jamun Bloody Mary with Churan and draught beers. The cocktail was damn good and surely is innovation at its best.
For starters we ordered a Lebanese dish chicken dajaj charmoula, which is chicken leg pieces rubbed with mild spices and cooked in charcoal .This was soft and succulent and extremely tasty. Then we ordered a Chinese pork starter ,  Hong shao rou , roasted pork stir fried with veggies.
For main course we ordered the shepherds pie, lobster Thermidor and packed a mutton biryani. The shepherds pie was soft and not too cheesy, accompanied by garlic bread crumbs and the lobster Thermidor was cooked to perfection with a healthy dose of cheese, quantity was a bit less we felt. However we were majorly disappointed with the biryani, it was something that I had never had before, it had none of the aroma that we associate with a biryani and also the texture wasn't good enough. Plus I guess they forgot to add salt!!!
I met the owner and chef Sambit ( he is a cordon bleu trained chef) and congratulated him for his endeavour and his creations and thanked him for the lovely food and promised to be back again.. Couldn't give him my feedback on the biryani as it was a parcel.

This place has a nice cosy feel. Right from the chef to the waiters, everyone is warm and hospitable. 

The food is ultra delicious. Every bite was a treat to my stomach. 

This one dessert was recommended by the waiter, Jack Daniels Mousse. However, I simply didn't like it. I politely asked him to take it away. He didn't add it to my bill and also while leaving, promised me that when I visit next time, he will offer the same dish and make sure I like it. Sweet :)

A place definitely worth visiting!

This place is amazing. The decor, the lighting, the music everything is beautiful. I went there today to have my birthday lunch. This is absolutely the kind of place I was looking for. Firstly I ordered a Long Island Iced Tea which was really long and strong :P My boyfriend settled for a beer. It was a little disappointing to see that Miller wasn't available though it was there in the menu.
For food, we ordered Beer Can Tempura Fish which tasted great. I loved it. For main course, we took a Shepherd's Pie which too was great.
As the staff came to know that it's my birthday, they made a complimentary dessert for me. That was such a kind thing they did.
All in all, my birthday lunch went very well.
Will keep coming back.

What to say first about #SpiceKraft. The food,the ambience or the service. Have no word to describe about all three. We went there just to have a little. But can't stop our finger to explore our tongue. We had Dajaj Charmoula,Beer Can Tempura Fish,Shepherds Pie,Coq-Au-Vin. There is just one word to about this 8 month old restaurant.  Itz simply #WOW#.

It is rare that I chance upon restaurants that focuses on building a close relationship with customers. Kolkata doesn't really lack fine dining restaurants. But what it severely needs is the long lost customer-to-owner relationship. And Spice Kraft makes it a point to know its customers, their needs, and their likings and dislikings in a detailed and friendly way. I had the opportunity to exchange a few words with the head chef and owner behind this masterpiece, Sambit da. Besides being extremely humble, what immediately caught my attention was his in-depth knowledge regarding cuisines and their histories. What is also noteworthy is the staff team of Spice Kraft. Not only are they on their toes throughout your visit, ready to take care of your every need but they also are thoroughly familiar with the menu. What further impressed me was that they went to the extent of breaking down the names of the foreign dishes and explaining to us in simpler words those items which made it sound all the more delectable.

The setting of the menu is cleverly done and is worth studying intricately. The restaurant has successfully introduced foreign dishes that are unfamiliar in Kolkata food scene. Complex cooking methods like using sous vide machine, flamb√©ing or molecular gastronomy are widely used in most of the items on the menu.

Among cocktails, I chose to have:

*Liquid Bomb: A classic combination of tequila, grape juice and a few other liquor that brings your drink to a much reddish looking colour. This drink is served inside a bulb-like glass and is presented nicely. However, it was a bit strong for my taste. Nevertheless, taste did not fail to win over my tummy, hence it gets a big four. (4/5)

*Kokum Rita: Spice Kraft's own take on margarita with extracts of kokum. This drink is served in a cocktail glass with a wedge of lemon on the rim. Interestingly enough, it is more spicy than sweet. I personally loved this drink and wanted a second round but didn't get the chance to order. But there's always a second time. (4.5/5)

Appetizers:

*Green Chilli Chicken: A rare and an underrated dish here in Kolkata. Spice Kraft brought the essence of Thailand right at the corner of Ballygunge. This dish is a combination of coriander, lemon and chilli with the freshness of herbs. The taste is just spot on and the meat is succulent and cooked to perfection. (5/5)

*Lymwyn Samak: This dish is where the fun part comes in. Four pieces of fishes served on a rectangular plate, first done inside the sous vide machine and later finished on a griller. The dish is stocked with flavour and explodes each time it gets inside your mouth. Fish fan or not, this is a must try. (5/5)

Sadly enough, I didn't have the time to experiment with the main courses their menu had to offer. Therefore, I had to just settle for the much talked about:

*Shepherd's Pie: Served in two white cups were baked mutton and lamb minces with a side of butter infused garlic bread. If I have to choose one word to describe this dish, it would be spectacular. (5/5)

When I think about Spice Kraft, I remember the relaxed ambiance, the attentive staff team, the very kind Sambit da and of course, the excellent quality of food. I think food here speaks volumes and that alone should be your reason to pay this place a visit. This place deserves nothing but a five out of five.

It is place chosen by my friends cum colleagues to have my farewell party. We are group who cherish different cuisines of food. So it was a dream coming true when we saw the menu card. We ordered Dajaj Chermoula, Lymwn Samak with Long island ice tea. Lebanese dajaj chermoula was too mch soft and delicious, so was the lymwn samak. We relished the food along with exquisite chutneys. Apart from that we ordered beer can tempura fish, Bombyl Koliwada, Hong Shou rou, Moon faan and Rajastani laal maas. Each every item was lip smacking. After a long time I had such well cooked mutton.
In hong shou rou we expected a bigger pork pieces, bombyl koliwada was a bit over priced as we know how much it costs to buy lote mach in market.
Ambiance: 4/5
Food:5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Cost: 4/5
Though it comes down to less than 4.5, I will give it 4.5/5 which is tribute to the magic of ¬†Chef Samit and his team! Keep it up! Will be there soon to try other items.

On the auto route from Hazra More to Ballygunge Phari, this place will fall to your right. I have been eyeing this place for a long time as many mentioned of its ambience and good food. Came here with my friend Sohini Sarkar yesterday for a beautiful dinner and it was something more than perfect!
First I must talk about the ambience. Oh! It's so beautifully done creating a very romantic ambience. Loved the place!
Next comes hospitality. The owner and executive chef Mr. Sambit, a graduate from Cordon Bleu, Paris greeted us and helped to choose our seats. He was so warm and humble that he personally suggested us what we should order or not. The staffs too, aptly trained by him were very courteous, warm and smiling all throughout their service.
Now let's come to the most important part. Yes, FOOD! It was so good. We were so full by the end that we could hardly move. The details are as follows -
Dajaj Chermoula - a Lebanese delicacy, Sambit helped us with the story of the Chermoula recipe at every Lebanese household. This was chicken cooked in sous vide process - the show stealer of the evening, served at first. I loved the crispy outside and it was so tender yet well cooked inside. Very good.
Green Chilli Chicken - a different variety, not very common in Kolkata. Spicy and all. Good for you if you have a tongue suited to hot stuffs.
Egg Foo-yong Canopy - this is an amalgamation of Chinese and English breakfast. Finger toasts topped with Chinese omelette and baked with cheese. An absolute thumbs up!
Lymwyn Samak - This is fish, cooked in sous vide process. Very soft, very nice. Loved the aroma of spices. Very good.
Chicken Drumsticks - a classic Chinese delicacy. This is generally served flamb√©ed with Old Monk. But as I am a teetotaler, he escaped it. This sauce too, was very nice. Perfectly made and the chicken was soft and juicy.
We were so full after this, the main course came a little later. We had -
Shepherd's Pie - a Class English delicacy served with garlic bread. It was cheesy. The mutton was also very delicious.
Baked Fish Canolli - this is a must have at SpiceKraft. Wraps like Bangali patishapta filled with fish. The fish is tossed in a different sauce and the canollis are covered with cheese sauce. Your meal at SpiceKraft simply would never be complete without this.
For desserts, there was a Monte Carlo. It was so good. One scoop of each - chocolate and vanilla ice cream and the glass greased with chocolate cake, an unique way of representation. Loved it!
Drinks - Cool Cucumber and Tangerinerita (SpiceKraft's take on virgin Margarita). Both of them were wonderful. Extraordinary! It was something I never had before.
What I loved the best over here is the food presentation and hospitality. Sambit would treat you as if you were his guests at his home and this way the ambience becomes very homely, easy and warm. Food is top notch and extraordinary. I am surely going to come back here again and again with newer hopes to try newer delicacies created by the man himself! Happy Dining! :)

"Unhygienic"-A big NO to this place. Their food is bad. Why? They have listed items on their menu which they can't cook. One such example is Chinese. It was our mistake that we thought of having Chinese there. Never do that. But my no-no for this place is because their servers are "Extremely Unhygienic". They will pick food from the table with hand and put it on your plate and serve it to you. Please be very careful.

Recommendation: Avoid the place for the sake of your health. And accidentally if you land in the place even after reading this review don't order Chinese.

This place is strategically located in the heart of Ballygunge and I must say its not at all pretentious.Though it doesnt look that flashy from outside,it can outrun many eminent restrobars
 in terms of food(diverse menu, cooked to perfection) and drinks(houses molecular cocktails).A few days back,I dropped by this place to have a late lunch-cum-booze.Being a beeroisseur,I ordered 2 pitchers of draught along with a cocktail which was a concoction of spicy pomegranate,cointreau and tonic.The blend was perfect and the hint of spices accentuated the flavours.Coming to food,I ordered dajaj charmoula and lymwn samak.The chicken was succulent 
and I liked their unconventional presentation.The dips offered with both the preparations tasted really well.The hospitality is good and the staffs were enthusiastically recommending their signature dishes.The ambience is not loud and the place has been done up nicely with soft hues.The music playing in background
 is not intrusive.I look forward to visit this place again to try out their other cocktails.

Went there yesterday.... Great cocktails and mock tails... We ordered for LIIT and Rainbow....both were good. Also they run great offers on premium liquor and pricing is quite cheap compared to similar restaurants. 
Chef Sambit is mostly on floor and interacts with every table and he made the order placing very easy for us and recommended dishes which were really good. 
Dejaj Charmoula is best starter ...must try. We also order for 3 more starter ...all were good.
Main course was equally good...Laal Maas, Amritsari Fish etc. Biryani was OK.

For improvement- Daal gosht was unavailable. All the dips were sweet. Ambience and decor is okay.

Another pro is that no food was rich.

Excellent quality of food and cocktails. Visited twice recently. We had mainly continental dishes and mocktais/cocktails. The crab and pork preparations, Shepherd‚Äôs pie,  drinks were awesome. What disappointed me was the ambience. Not enough space with cramped sitting arrangement. The rooms smelled damp on both occasions and requested to spray room freshner. 
The staff were courteous.

Went here for lunch on a saturday afternoon. Locating the place might be tough if you are not a local. 
Ambience is romantic and food is wonderful. The flavours are wonderful. 
We tried:  

1. Dajaj Charmoula: Much like tandoori but much softer on the inside...the way they present this item is nice.

2. Tangrita: This spicy and tangy drink will surely tickle your taste buds.

3. Shepherd's Pie: Lamb meat and bread crumbs. Quantity was sufficient for two people.

4. Jack Daniel Mousse: One of the best desserts. My friend liked it more. For me it was average.

I would recommend all to visit this place if you are looking for a fancy lunch, especially a lunch date.

Wanted my birthday treat to be exotic and what place other than Spicekraft can it be!
As you enter the restaurant you know the queue was totally worth it.

Food orders: Dajaj Char Moula, Chicken noodles Cantonese style and Devilled Crab Meat.
Each n' every dish swept us off our feet.What elegant presentation and taste.
The Dajaj Char Moula was medium sized chicken legs with a tinge of charcoal flavor.The chicken was well marinated soft and just yum!But the dip that came along didn't appeal to me much.
The Pan Fried Chicken Noodles came in white gravy and flooded with green veggies and chicken.
And finally the Devilled Crab Meat is just cherry on the cake.Special kudos to the chef for doing the wonder using crabmeat and cheese.Cheese baked crabmeat is served inside two crab shells.No need to break the shell since the meat can be easily scooped out.It's too overwhelming for two persons.Should be ordered 1 by 4.Had this exact dish in Goa,a year back.So was astonished to get the same dish in my native.

Cocktails: This place serves awesome cocktails. Do get your hands on my fav',the Hazelnut Heaven,a creamy vodka based delight.It's more like a dessert cocktail and less of a refreshing gulp.
We also ordered the Spicy Pomegranate,a pink refreshing drink.

Backdrop: Very decent crowd, families n' friends.Dimly lit,nice wall decor.
Behaviour of the staff deserves special mention,besides the quick service.
The chef is all ears for the priceless suggestions from the foodies.He is always on his toes and would suggest you as per your taste buds if you are totally confused with the exquisite menu.

Synopsis: If you want to explore molecular gastronomy,as the chef calls it,this is the place!
Quality food,innovative cocktails,exclusive setting and the special touch by the humble chef-all served on a single plate here.A must-go for innumerable times!!

Dont judge a book by its cover- yep thats how I'd describe this place. The restaurant looks plain from outside, but is well decorated from inside. Its not a big restaurant, can seat about 40-50 people.
The staff was very patient, did not rush us, all though we waited 1.5 hrs before ordering( we were a group of 11). This place is toddler friendly, they have baby chairs unlike most other restaurants.
The two must haves of this restaurant are: coq au vin and the off menu cocktail liquid bomb. Basically these were my favourites from a whole lot of tasty dishes. Do order from continental and chinese because the Indian food doesn't really stand out. 
Try this place out when you want a fancy date, or you're out with a group. 
Ps: If you take a lot of drinks, they'll update you with the bill that's built up, just in case you're too drunk to realise that on your own. I wish other restaurants did the same *sigh*. And do ask for off menu items, they are the hidden gems of this place.
Minus .5 because there was no water in the washroom for the entire time that we were there(3-4hrs).

I must say that Spice Kraft is one of those restaurants where the service is even better than the food. Every food suggested by the staff was amazing.
We had dajaj chermoula which is their most demanded dish and it is needless to say the chicken (well marinated in herbs and spices) was succulent and juicy. The yogurt dip perfectly balanced out the flavours of the chicken. 
Next we had the chef's special baked fish. It was a mouthful of flavours with bursts of cheese. It was the best dish we had that day. We were already mesmerized with the ambience and the food.
Done with the entrees, next came moon fan and a prawn dish cooked in coriander sauce. The aroma was strong and mouth watering and it tasted equally good. 
The dessert was 100% jack daniels chocolate mousse and it took me to a happy high. The bitterness of the alcohol cut through the sweetness of the mousse and the orange glaze brought some freshness to the dessert. The sponge cake was light and the texture of the mousse was really smooth.
Excellent service, great ambience and exciting food characterized by reasonable pricing are the special points of this place.

Visited this restaurant located on hazra road. Well, to me, "spicekraft" lacks the craft in their spicy dishes and needs to work on it... We had a starter (something vietnami) and I must say it was very delicious, on the main course it was biryani which supposed to be served to our heart's content, but there was no taste of biryani in that dish named "biryani", it wasn't bad but I think it wasn't something to be called "biryani"... the juice we had ordered was the best of all the items... 
Coming to the other things, well this restaurant is not large but the dining is good, staffs are good....

I had heard a lot about this place and finally I decided to visit here today. They provide a lot of cuisines and I had opted for the north indian. I am a bit disappointed because the biryani almost had no flavour in it. The starters was fine. The one thing I loved was a mocktail. It was something new and tasted beautiful. The interiors, hospitality and others are all excellent. Though famous for continental dishes care should also be taken regarding the other cuisines as they are providing it. Hope the other ones will be good.

Behavior of all the staff and authorities were also very good. They patiently tried to help and suggest us every time when we asked them.Now came to the most interesting part. We ordered 5,6 types of cocktails to try their variety.All of them were awesome and unique.We had 1 veg and 3 non veg starters along with the cocktails,which were awesome. Again in maincourse we had items from continental as well as Indian and Chinese sections.All of them were mind blowing.Service was awesome. Specially the way they present their food was awesome,unique,innovative.Thanks to them to gift us such an awesome day . .with mind blowing food and cocktails.

This place was recommended to me by a friend and so I already had a fair idea of the restaurant's quality. On entering I absolutely loved the glass wall show-casing all the wine bottles but strangely the other room with its blue lighting seemed kind of disconnected with the rest of the decor. Also, i was expecting the seating arrangements to be a bit more spacious. Anyway, coming to the food I had no complaints whatsoever.¬†
We ordered a glass a sangria which was delicious followed by Red Pepper Prawns for starters. Although slightly spicier for my taste the prawns were absolutely delicious. For the main course we ordered a Shepherd's Pie and Lobster Thermidor. Usually when I have this lobster dish I find so much cheese in it that it completely overpowers the taste of the lobster. Fearing this would be the case here as well, I asked the waiter if they could reduce the mount of cheese in my dish. And I was happy to receive my plate of food with the lobster tasting great with the proper amount of cheese complimenting it. The rice along with it was nicely fragrant and delicious. The Shepherd's Pie was beautiful creamy and delicious.Overall, the food was great and the portions so generous that we had no room left for desserts...haha! But I'll surely be coming back to this place and not just for the dessert that's due. Another nice touch to my experience was the chef coming out to the dining area and personally speaking to the diners, taking our feedback on the food and if we were having a good time there. We were very pleased with your service. Thank you. :)

Going directly to food, I ordered Subz Ki Galawat, Chilly Mushroom and Spaghetti in Arrabiata Sauce. The Kebab wasn't upto the mark and disappointed me. It lacked moisture and was just okay! Coming to the mushroom, it was juicy and rightly prepared! The Spaghetti was a little sweet but well-coated with cheese. In drinks, I just ordered and L.I.I.T and it couldn't have been better! No complaints. What made my meal complete was the Dessert or what they call as Boozerts!! I ordered a '100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse, Drunken Petit Fours' (Contains Alcohol), and it was splendid! The sponge cake was just so soft and delightful when eaten with the mousse together! The orangish jam was the perfect sauce to complete the dish!!! The Staff is courteous and knowledgeable! They rightly explain the dish and how it will be prepared! Hope to visit this place soon to try more of its dishes!

This place is amazzzzinggg!!!
Had been hearing a lot about this place but somehow wasn't being able to dine in here but finally the wait was over on 5th Aug.
My best friend was in town so I suggested we should have our lunch here and I can't tell u how proud I'm of myself for suggesting this place.
Our gastronomic experience was nothing short of a marvel!
We not only enjoyed our lunching experience here but also learnt so much about the various preparations ( thanks to the manager for that :) )
Now, coming to the location n food.
Spice kraft is very conveniently located in ballygunge phari.it is at a min walking distance from both hazra law college n ballygunge phari petrol pump.
The food.omg!!no matter what I say or write its still going to b very less.( yes!! Oshadharon n oshamanno chilo!! Trust me)
We ordered:
1. Beer can tempura fish in beer batter!
2.moon faan rice( non veg)
3.chicken Hakka noodles.
4.chicken in soya chilli sauce.
5.100% jack Daniels n Barry callebaut swiss chocolate mousse.
All the dishes were on point.
Presentation was very beautiful.
Pricing was very reasonable comparing with the presentation n taste.
Staffs were very friendly. Service was quick.interiors were good.(some renovation work was going on though)
Overall a very fulfilling experience.
And spice kraft has definitely earned a loyalist in us forever.
All the best!!

When you are bored with the conventional food items, come to this place and try the plethora of innovative items in both food and drinks. We had ordered :

> Hong Shao Rou ~ Something like Chilly pork tossed in a spicy sauce ! It was amazing.
>Beer Can Tempura Fish ~ A variety of batter fish fry ! It was good but nothing so great as compared to the other items we ordered. Least loved amongst all i guess because it had a normal common taste we felt.
>Dajaj Chermoula ~ Sort of Chicken tengri kabab but too good in taste, the soft chicken will melt in your mouth
>Coq-Au-Vin ~ A marvelously cooked chicken and mushroom with a li'l bit of rice. You will feel like having it non stop. The rich buttery taste was simply superb.
>Another item suggested by the Chef was The BEST. So you can always trust the Chef if he is suggesting you to try out something as it seems that he read minds well. It was a pancake with spicy fish and cheese inside. It was heavenly.
>Kokum Rita drink was a light drink of Tequila and it was ideal for non hardcore drinkers.
>Utterly Butterly Jameson drink stood apart from all of the drinks we had. With the first sip you will have the chocolaty flavor in your mouth and then the Jameson slowly hits your throat.¬†
>Another Beer based cocktail, suggested by the waiter was also pretty nice.
>100% Jack Daniels is a divine desert but will be loved by them only who like hard drinks i guess.
The presentation of food deserves a special mention. The sight of the food will surely make you feel hungry. In a nutshell, the service, the quality of food, the presentation of food will not let you forget this restaurant easily.

Having heard a lot about this place and its focus on molecular gastronomy, I was surprised to see a rather shabby exterior with a queue of people outside.
I finally got to enter SpiceKraft after a wait of 45 minutes spent deliberating whether or not to give it a miss. The interior however, was completely different with three jam-packed rooms. The decor was rather unique, what with the truck-shaped condiment containers on the table.
Coming to the food:
For entree, we had:
1) Dajaj Chermouli - A brilliant Lebanese dish having chargrilled chicken legs marinated with chermoula spices.
2) Beer Can Tempura Fish with Orange Ponzu Tartare - A dish which, though uniquely presented in a beer can, was nothing different from the f'ish fingers' we are so used to having. Perhaps the most disappointing entree.
3) Pork Ribs Burrah Kabab with Jalapeno and Imli chutney drizzle - It was truly wonderful. The smoky flavour accentuated the taste.
For mains :
1) Shepherd Pie served with Garlic Bread - The lamb was so soft that it seemed to melt in the mouth.
2) Coq-au-Vin - The roast chicken was pretty good.
3) Baked Fish Wellington - The fish will make you go 'wow' though, what with its cheese sauce, it is a bit heavy.
And lastly, for desserts-
1) Cointrue, Orange and white chocolate parfait, dark fudge tortait - I wish I hadnt ordered this. The dessert was extremely dry and a huge disappointment.
2) 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse - This dessert, on the other hand, was beautifully presented with a mousse in a quenelle. Thumbs up for this!
The staff was extremely helpful.
Overall, it was a great experience. Would love to come back again.

Was here on the occasion of a friend's birthday. Starters here are worth dying for especially if you are a non vegetarian. (simply yumm). Main course was not at par with the  appetisers but good enough nonetheless. Drinks including cocktails were nice too.
However, the ambience was a huge let down, no music, a bit congested and it felt as if I am walking on bare plywood.

Not too difficult to locate, this restaurant is a great find. We ordered the Coq-au-vin and the Gushtaba with tandoori roti. Both the dishes were cooked perfectly. Gushtaba is a Kashmiri dish and the mutton balls are cooked beautifully. Coq-au-vin was immensely smooth and delicious. The taste of red wine had been blended in the dish perfectly. The ambience was impressive too. Looking forward to going back to the place soon.

Well, it has been long I have been taking help from Zomato to decide where to dine and finally I think its time to pen down some of the experiences.
Spice Kraft, located near to Ballygaunge Phari on the Hazra Road is one of the quiet places that has been doing good business. As the name suggests, they seem to craft the food to perfection.
This a place where you should try cocktails, be it Chivas Julep having a whiskey base or the Mango driver, having a vodka base. They sinfully blend the cocktails to guve u that kick.
Now coming to the food, the pork ribs and the devil crab are the favourite ones. The pork served is unbelivably tender and the devil crab is uttely delicious.
The staff are very courteous and always ready to assist in choosing and selcting the dishes.
You want to have a calm weekend dinner, this is the place to be in. Try it ince, every bit of Spice Kraft will drag you there for the rest of the times....!!

One of the best places for continental dining in Kolkata.Went there two times in a month after discovering it and can't wait to go again.

Menu - It boasts plenty of uniqueness  with the molecular cocktails and infusions,but the food menu is classic and old school. All the best and popular dishes from across the globe. Very wide range of choices  - they have every type of spirit that the excise department would allow to be imported and the food menu consists of European classics like Coq au vin,stoganoff,shepherd's pie as well as oriental delights like Hunan fish,rendang curry. Some great experimentation is out there too with the likes of beer can tempura fish,which is probably the most popular dish out here .

Ambience- Very straightforward with no fancy theme or decor.Just like any family restrobar for fine dining.The music is soft and the choice is good.The  truck-shaped container having salt,pepper in every table is a nice little twist.

Food & Drinks - The molecular cocktails are unique in taste and the decoration of fruits certainly makes you interested in them.Tasted smoked guava and spicy pomegranate , and very much satisfied with the sheer quality and effort theg have put on to make these new brand of drinks a hit.Coming to the food,the first thing i remember is Beer Can tempura fish -well,i can write an essay about it but i would simply say its a must-have dish if you're at Spicekraft.The presentation is exotic as it comes being stuffed inside a Budweiser can,the fish is soft and juicy but the outer layer is crispy.The use of beer in batter works wonder for them i guess and the dip they serve along with the dish is delicious.
In the maincourse,have tasted Coq au vin and stoganoff .They are very well prepared too with the use of seasonings absolutely apt .The sauce made from wine along with the softness of chicken makes you forget all your worries.

Looking forward to trying out their oriental and seafood menu next time. 
We need more restaurants like these which are not being opened up  just for the sake of business but whose owners really are in the mood to give the people of kolkata the experience and taste of new flavours

Located opposite of Quadra Nursing home. On hazra road.
This restaurant provided one of the most Innovative dishes you can think of. The best part of which is that the food tastes really nice and the variety of choices makes you sit for half an hour on deciding what to order.
We ordered the Cow Au Vin and Beer Batter Tempura fish for starters. I have to admit that the Coq Au Vin was very well presented as well as prepared. The tempura fish was remarkable and really loved it.
For main course we ordered two pork chops. But was slightly disappointed(not that I am saying it's bad) as to it did not meet the high bar of expectation that the first two dishes have set.
Lastly for desert ordered the 100% JD dessert. Which to my surprise was a perfect blend of sweetness and the signature JD style.
One this that is definitely worth mentioning is that Chef Sambit is a really nice person. He is a very down to earth person and not to mention that his friendly gestures makes the food tastier :)

Located near Ballygunj phari, this is an easily-accessible place. A beautifully decorated restaurant and the food is quite good too.
I loved the service. We were made to feel at home. The staff were really hospitable and helped us with the menu. We tried beer can tempura fish, suon nuong, a hammerjack along with beer.
I loved the quirky and kitschy decor.
It's truly a gem. Provides fine dining experience with warmth. Worth the visit.

Located pretty much on an identifiable spot, this gastro restaurant serves with one can call as the finest of foods.
Let's just agree that the Menu might be confusing at first. And the stewarts guided us well.
P.S. Don't miss the 'Booze'rts, foodies ;)

The place is a little shady with the music not parallel with the environment. Can be worked upon.
Food wins a thumbs up! Cheers.

Nice ambience, located in a cosy neighborhood. I felt food was overpriced considering the amount of each dish was less. On the other hand liquor was priced reasonably üòâ
Food was delectable and we gorged on house favorite Dajaj Chermoula & sipped on LIIT.
We also tried shepherd's pie, baked fish Wellington, coq-au-vin and beer can tempoura fish...and relished them all!

Good food. Good staff..nice ambience. Nasigoreng is good. But would like to suggest to remove the lal maas from the menu as the lal maas was a low quality mutton curry with loads of chilly powder. And the zafrani roti is actually a paratha fried with sugar.

My second visit in the last 1 month. Loved every bit of it. The place has 3 separate rooms. The evenings are pretty crowded. So you make sure you book a table. Very nice decor. The wooden truck which holds the salt and pepper shakers is unique. The food was awesome. We tried Pasta Arrabiata, Lobster Thermidor, Beer Can Fish, Green Chilli Chicken. Special mention must be made to the Roast pork in Rendang curry which we relished on both the days. We were so ¬†busy eating that I forgot to take shots of these delicacies :)

I have mixed feelings about this place. It is definitely worth the rave reviews and the waves it's making in the Kolkata food scene ..I love their cocktails especially their lichitini, the drink that comes  out of a bulb, their aam panna infusions, chivas julep and their choco jameson..you might wonder why i am still not giving them a 4.0.. it's because they have consistency issues..Every time I've been with chef Sambit around the food has been fabulous and when he hasn't ive noticed a dip in taste in the very same items ... So their charmoula is really good so is their beer battered fish but there other things have a bit of a consistency issue.. shepherds pie varies, their JD mousse varies too..the first time I had it I absolutely loved it ...not the third time round ...avoid their beliinis and sometimes their molecular deconstructions in the mojito department goes a little awry  ...as sambit tries to build a huge brand (which I know he will) full marks for his personal touch, flare for plating and taking Kolkata out of the box..hope he fixes the ambience and the consistency issues ..also I must add their set menus are really value for money ..so.must try !!!

Let's start w the positives - 
Location
Ambience 
Cosy
Drinks (menu and deals)
Staff 

Now for the negatives - 
The food (even the chef recommended dishes) don't do anything for the taste buds. The beer battered fish fry was super duper crunchy. Not the way I like to have my fish fry. The chicken tikka (it's known by some other fancy name) is ok however the accompaniment that came with it was awful. 

Leaves a lot of room for improvement.

This place. I have visited Spice Kraft thrice in the past six months, and it never fails to impress and reaffirm my belief that it is worth another visit. The Chef has taken experimentation to a whole new level and has definitely floored the food-lover in me.¬†

They have good cocktails, a couple of which I've enjoyed though I'm not a huge cocktail fan, unfortunately. Coming to their food, I've sampled:
1. Beer Can Tempura Fish: The batter is sheer perfection, and it comes with a yummy dip.
2. Drums of Heaven with Old Monk Flambe: Though it is on the spicier side, it is rich in flavour.
3. Coq au Vin: A French dish, highly recommended.
4. Baked Fish Wellington: Some good ol' English fare, only they use Betki instead of beef here.
5. Dajaj Chermoula: A Lebanese preparation, ¬†the Chermoula spices makes the dish very tangy and yummy.
6. Hong Shao Rou: Chinese dish. The pork in Hoisin sauce is quite excellent.
7. 100% Jack Daniels chocolate mousse: You can taste the sour, smoky flavour of Jack Daniels whisky in the mousse. This boozert is a must try.
8. Classic Monte Carlo: Another lip- smacking dessert.

As if all the delicious food wasn't good enough reason to frequent this place, the staff and ambiance is top notch as well. The staff are extremely courteous and attentive, and they tell you all about the dish you're going have, making it an even better culinary experience. The Chef himself always makes it a point to interact with customers and ask for their feedback. The quirky menu cards, the tiny truck on the table that carries the seasonings, and even the cutlery are delightful.

I only wish they had slightly bigger tables for seating two people. The smaller tables can feel a wee bit cramped. Otherwise, no complaints! One should definitely step into Spice Kraft for a soulful experience with the "Art of Good Taste".

The decor was beautiful, food average, but there was some problem with the ventilation .Also, the cooling system was not working properly.We had Beerbattered Tempura fish, Dajaj Charmoula,Deconstructed Papri Chaat,Roasted pineapple beefeater Gin coctail, Rainbow, Fish Wellington. Tempura fish sauce was too sweet to our taste, Dajaj Charmoula and Fish Wellington was awesome.We didn't find anything special about Deconstructed Papri Chaat.We didn't find any¬† bubble to pop in our mouth as claimed in the menu , instead a taNGY paste tasting like papri chaat on a spoon.

The overall experience at SpiceKraft was very average. There was nothing very outstandingly great about the place.¬†
The ambience at SpiceKraft was okayish mostly because i do not like very dimly lit restaurants. The place where I wish to eat food should be brightly lit so that i can see my food properly before i eat it.¬†

Coming to the food, I loved your doodhiya kebab. It was expertly done. Perfectly browned and equally mellow to eat.¬†
Khoai tay, was very average and i felt that the overall taste tipped over into excessive sweetness rather than holding its ground with the Sriracha chilli sauce. Deconstructed papri chaat was okay. And lastly the Darsaan, was overtly glazed with orange. The taste of orange should be subtle and not to the extent of making it sweet orange crisps.¬†

Would definitely come in and to taste the other items in the menu next time. Cheers!

Located opposite to Hazra law college, Spice Craft is a new addition to town's gastronomy. Interior and illumination is appealing. Waiters and chefs are always on their toes to serve their best creation. We had a talk with the owner of the place , Mr. Sambit Banik, the professor turned chef, generally travels to different parts of the Globe to collect tasty recipes and serves those here, giving his final master touch ! Most of the dishes are fusion, mainly inspired by Continental and Asian cuisine. So, dining here will give you altogether a new experience !

Very nice location with good wine display counter. Nice ambience, decors, furniture, serving plate - glass and roti basket except food test . The Lal Mass is very average in test as any other ordinary mutton dish with no special touch. No tandoori smell or test which is authentic for the dish. Anyway Nan was very thin with crust. My expectation was very high from this place after reading the reviews on Zomato and after feel the interior ,but I am little bit disappointed. In my point of view I feel Dishes are  little bit overpriced. Soft soothing music is a big turn on. For a romantic dinner this place is ideal.

Probably the best alacarte restaurant in kolkata serving multicuisine food with exotic drinks! Each of the items that was served to me was fantabulous. I didn't ever tasted such tender and juicy grilled bhetki ever. The cocktails that we were served was worth the money. It kicked with one drink and it tasted awesome. Service was super fast. The mouth freshner that was served along with the bill was exceptional. It was an imli candy. Only thing i wanted to recommend is probably if they could increase the washroom capacity, as i can see queue was lining up outside. Since after drinks you need that washroom or probably soneone feel vomiting so they can't wait outside. I liked the way the chef came up and explained every dish to the customer when they were confused what to order.

Synopsis in short, amazing, amazing food, very well decorated, friendly and helpful staff, and one of the best places for a foodgasmic experience in Kolkata.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon , didn't expect anything special though.. 
But as soon as we went in, the establishment started increasing our expectations. Starting from the decor, to the presentation of the menu, to the behaviour of the staff. 

We ordered a a variety of dishes, with a few drinks, and each and every one of them were delicious to the point of us craving for more. Special mention to the pork ribs with jalapeno and imli chutney, and beer batter fish. 

Highly recommended for anyone who is in love with food.

I don't think this place requires any sort of introduction. They have done revolution in the city gourmet scene with their range of cocktails. Being a hotel school graduate I actually thought to compare their attempt with the things we learnt. And they taught me that mixology is beyond any theory, its all about vision. Thumbs up. And so was the dessert, that Jack Daniels mousse was something. Thought their food was amazing and very much experimental, I think there are a lot of scopes to play with the core area of molecular gastronomy to actually provide this city a foodies hotspot. :)

A small 20-30 seater restaurant 2 mins walk into Hazra road. At least that is the impression you get from the outside if no one has talked to you about this place. Maybe something for them to work on. Once you enter inside you realize there is lot of dining space. There is a room within the dining room which is closer to the kitchen and sits around 20 people at a time.

The dining room could do with a bit of cleaning though, the model of a Indian truck on the dining table gathered quite a bit of dust. The staff was enthusiastic and as you enter you feel there is a vibe about something here.

Once you open the menu card you can tell about what. The menu is absolutely epic. Its around 30 pages. Asian, Continental, Indian this place serves everything. No other restaurant in Kolkata serves Molecular mocktails and cocktails/ infusion. One can have 1-3 courses of drink before moving on the food.

I'm not going into the details of any dish here. I can say that what the people here serve (Chef-cum owner Sambit Banik and company) is completely unique and Kolkata has wanted a restaurant like this for a long time but this is the first of its kind.¬†

The care with which flavors are incorporated in food keeping in mind the texture and presented with such grace that you instantly feel all sorts of kicks. When you taste the food here you know its been made with the freshest of ingredients.¬†

All in all its a restaurant I want to come back many times.

Pleasantly economic for the food and ambience it offers! It's a perfect joint for both - a romantic meal and a lunch with your family. The interiors are pleasantly appointed along with complimenting lighting and furniture although the exterior isn't very appealing and inviting. They can perhaps spend some effort there.

Their menu offers quite a bit of choice from amongst continental, middle eastern and north Indian fare and most of what we ordered turned out good. Pretty good. We were a group of 7 and ended up ordering quite a feast but what sticks in my mind is the "beer can tempura fish" and "dajaj chermoula". The other dishes were good even though I don't remember all the names. We had also asked for an Indian mutton preparation along with Indian breads which too was satisfactorily good.

The presentation is smart -- the condiments are arranged in miniature trucks and the breads came in trolleys.

The beverages (cocktails and mocktails) are quite economic but aren't the best in town. 

Overall, worth a try for sure.

As we located SpiceKraft, i was almost juding a restaurant by its exterior... They have almost not given that any thought! But when you open the door and enter, u know what surprise they have in store! The interior is really nice and romantic <3.. With a space for groups to come and enjoy a few drinks without disturbing the entire restaurant. 
So, the chef ( who infact was really interactive and helpful ) helped us to make our choices.
I liked some of the things we ordered, 'Bacardi Limon infused Chicken Sausages' were nice! And do was 'Veg Canolini' !!
Food really had quite some depth to it..would love to discover the place further!
Overall, the experience was quite refreshing!

Spice Kraft is a walk away from the petrol station situated on the ballygunge crossing. The place looks very decent, a shout out to the cabinet hosting bottles of wines from around the world. 

The food is great. 
We had ordered their specialties, the Dajaj Charmoula and beer batter fish. Along with this we had ordered  veg spring rolls (poh pia i suppose). All the appetisers were great. Ironically, the veg rolls stood out which actually wasn't even their specialty.
For our main course we had ordered a veg mixed sauce pasta along with coq au vin. Both were amazing. Superb flavour and texture and we were actually satisfied with the quantity. 
Amazing dining experience.
Do visit this place without any hesitation. 
Happy dining.

There was no "molecular infusing".I agree that the food was good and decently priced with attentive servers, but the fact still remains that spice krafts claims of cooking at a molecular level are FALSE. There are many other BETTER places where you can get much better Indian and Chinese food. Clearly their food is making up for quality through presentation

Had been hearing some good feedback from my friends and relatives regarding this place. It was last week when me and my colleagues went out for a post work dinner that we decided to try this 'much talked about' restaurant. We received a warm welcome by the Head Chef and owner, Mr. Sambit Banick. The ambience and decor of the place, including the style of the menu was what impressed us at the first go. Chef Sambit then guided us through the menu and suggested the dishes that we should try. We were more than happy to go by the Chef's choice and soon were spoiled by an array of appetisers that had Soy Braised Drums of Heaven with Old Monk Flamb√©, Beer Can Tempura Fish, Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab and Bruschetta. For cocktails, Chef insisted on trying the Milk Maid Chaitini which had a very interesting flavour but the alcohol ratio was a bit overpowering for me. I then decided to switch and try the Classic Cosmopolitan instead. The taste was so well balanced and subtle, it was a real treat to the palate. I was looking forward to trying this cocktail for a very long time and I'm glad that I had my first Cosmopolitan experience at Spice Kraft. The presentation of the food was another factor that wowed us. Chef Sambit surely knows how to inculcate his craftsmanship around his signature dishes, therefore justifying the name Spice Kraft The staff was super courteous and friendly. If you're a true foodie and don't mind trying innovative dishes, then this is the place to go. Definitely worth a second visit and many more to follow.

On the downside, we had to wait for a very long time, not just because the restaurant was very popular but also because the kitchen was serving food rather inefficiently.
Also, the place was quite noisy.
I quite liked the d√©cor. People who like funky designs and architecture would appreciate it more.
The food was quite nice, but minus the decoration, it was good but not great.
We didn't take any drinks, but I think they have really good ones.
I recommend:

#Roast Chicken

An innovation new restaurant...being functional only for 7 months, Spice Kraft has pulled it off really well. Me and my parents were really impressed by the new kind of food...The decor is amazing with mild music in the background. Starting from the entree till the dessert, the dishes were spot on. The beer can tempura fish was lip smacking and is a must try.

It was a wonderful experience....Good luck to Samit and the entire team of Spice Kraft!!

I have eaten in many fine dining restaurants in Kolkata. However, one dinner in this restaurant made this my favourite restaurant in Kolkata. Any more attraction, and I would be quoting Shakespeare. I am going to review this under the following categories:-

AMBIENCE- There are 3 different sections of this restaurant, each with a different ambience and different levels of lighting. The d√©cor is very tastily done.

SERVICE- The staff here add a personal touch to make your food experience all the more elevating. Their suggestions were really spot on. There was a very smooth service as well.

DRINKS- First time using this as a separate category. The bar in this restaurant us well-stacked, and the bar man must be a magician. I had some cocktails here that belonged to a totally different level. Also, this is the first place where I had Tequila shots. For cocktails, a must try is the 'Liquid Bomb' and the 'Terminator'. Both have a variety of liquors in them. The Liquid Bomb is served in a glass which looks like an inverted light bulb. The Terminator, on the other hand, is served in a tall glass with an inverted Heineken bottle on top of it. As I said, they must be tried.

FOOD- The main aspect of any restaurant is its food, and this is where Spice Kraft hits a home run. Each and every item on the menu is exceptional in its own way. I had the Chicken Charmoula and the Bacardi chicken sausage for starters. Amazing. And the booze comes back later again. For main course, I had Shepard's Pie (lamb pie with garlic bread sticks) and my friends had Coq-au-vin and Baked Fish Wellington. Each of the items had an unique taste of its own. I have had lamb in many places, and frankly, hardly a handful can cook the lamb well. This restaurant cooked it not just well, but perfectly. The food was tantalizing. For dessert, or boozert, as they say it, we had Cointreau, orange and white chocolate parfait with dark fudge torte. A perfect finish to an the best restaurant experience I have had till now.

Just an earnest request, please give this place a shot. It might be costly, but it's so worth it.

Spice kraft as the name a difference so does the food.....my first experience was that from the ambience,the service of the staff,the food item,the quantity and quality of the food,the food decor was 10/10.
Never enjoyed a better diner out with family like I did yesterday....I shall revisit the resto again for more delectable and mouth watering food with my family.....@christine jyoti george,jessica ven,rocky ven,justin anthony mondal.

Great food, decently priced cocktails, amazing service - there's hardly anything more one can ask for from a restaurant. This is one of those very few places in the city, where good food is served without being ridiculously pricey. I tried one of their beer cocktails, and quite liked it. However, the squid dish which I ordered this time was a little less in terms of presentation than what I expected. It was too run of the mill kind, to be from Spice Kraft, I felt.

The new age dining at Kolkata!!! If you are a cocktail lover it's a must visit! Beer can tempura fish.... Pork ribs.... Both were good.... But shepherd's pie was very good! But the cocktails stole the show!!! Liquid bomb, hammerjack and terminator were really awesome! Looking forward for our next visit!! The service was really appreciable.

Location: Very Accessible
Ambience: Fancy concept of trucks and cycles as vehicles of food condiments. Overall nice ambience. Lots of seating area. Would like the place to be a bit more well lit (would serve the purpose of showing how nicely the food is served)
Food: Though the portions are not for the hungry heart / stomach. The taste is quite distinct and innovative. The food dressing is well thought out and nicely served.
Service: Is quite fast (hopefully they won't change that)

Verdict - Do visit if you are in Ballygunge or nearby. I would surely visit again. Looking forward to more amazing innovations from the Chef. But a definitive restaurant in Kolkata promising you a dinner with innovation.

Having gone here for a friend's birthday bash, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of sophistication from the moment we entered. Nicely laid out tables with beautiful cutlery and expensive wine bottles adorning the walls, the restaurant successfully laid out an ambiance of luxury. ¬†As we were 8 in total, we were seated in the inner room and the dim lighting added to the overall feel. We settled in and ordered our starters and drinks. I went for a L.I.I.T while the other drinks included a litchitini among a few others. I took a sip of the litchitini and it tasted great. The L.I.I.T as described in the menu was potent!!! Nice beginning. The entrees arrived. The bacardi limon infused tandoori chicken sausages with churan and blueberry coulis was a bit gimmicky to be honest, but tasted nice if not great. We took nasi goreng and moon faan as our rice dishes for the main course and paired them up with chicken in chilly oyster and mushrooms and spicy orange peel chicken. The moon faan was excellent. The nasi goreng satisfied our cravings for spicy food. The chicken side dishes were good as well.¬†A shout out to the waiters who were extremely helpful with their suggestions and prompt in the service. Anything we wanted were immediately catered to. A big thumbs up.In conclusion, we left the place a satisfied with the service and the food.Price point is very slightly on the higher side. The quantities are strictly adequate if not slightly below par.Recommended?? YES!

Two visits, and totally floored.
I feel nothing in the city can muster up to Spice Kraft's brilliance, at the very affordable price point it asks for.
The interiors are classy and peppered with the chef/owner's personal touch. Beautifully lacquered walls, kitschy trucks, even the pepper mills, everything exudes the fact that a lot of thought has been given to.
The chef came over to help me choose, and he suggested a couple starters to begin with.
Food took a bit of time to prepare ( i assume it was freshly made, that's why) and a peek in the kitchen revealed that it was very orderly and moderately clean.
So the food:
Dajaj Chermoula: Tender, tender chicken (think about the best reshmi kabab, made even better) with a punchy spice rub. The fried garlicky yogurt was a match made in heaven. And the bit of cucumber to add a light, fresh crunch. Gorgeous. I got some for takeaway as well.
Beer Battered Tempura: Briny, sweet bhetki deep fried in a shatter crisp batter. Love the orange sauce (with a sneaky twist of alcohol) was wonderful. The dips were big hits all around, among three of us we had five servings!
However the tempura was turning slightly tough midway eating, which can be resolved i feel, if vodka (some spirit with higher alcohol levels) is subbed instead of the low on alcohol beer, keeping the gluten levels low. Just a minor suggestion!
Strangely, we were almost filled up by then, and we asked for deserts.
Darsaan was the winner in the table, huge portions, crispy honeyed shards with a big heap of in house ice cream, very value for money and super yum.
The vanilla ice cream with chocolate was good as well, though not as good as rest of the food. Maybe because i don't like vanilla!
P.S: include some fruit based desserts. Sorbets, tarts, ice creams, anything of the sort will be a welcome addition!
Servers were brilliant, young, smiling and helpful.
The bill was -- safe to say, very surprising. All these for lesser than 1.5k, with drinks, and three full tummies, can't say you can get a better VFM in the city anywhere else.
As we were walking out, the restaurant was running a full house, and the happy banter all around was a sure moodlifter!
My second visit came around noon a couple days after. All i wanted was some Pan frried Chili fish with my vodka. Suffice to say, this place treated a lone diner like me to no less.
Definately worth all the hype.
Highly recommend!

Went there for the cocktails and wasn't disappointed. They make a mean long island ice tea. The best and most popular item on their menu is the beer batter fried tempura fish. The fish is fresh and mild against the salty batter. Works well for the palate with the sweeter cocktails. Very low priced compared to other places serving similar cocktails.. it's a must try for those with a limited budget. Also, quirky decor is a positive.

Once you have been to spice kraft, you will visit this place again for their innovative dishes and warm hospitality. It is an well decorated place that is not too small and not too big for a eatery like this. Coming to the food, the items that really strikes a chord with the tastebuds is their version of green chilly chicken and firecrackers (their own take on good old crispy Chicken). If one wants to wash down the food with some booze then spice kraft has a large variety of alcohol and cocktails to choose from. Overall a nice place to go to dinner with your family and have a pleasant dinning experience that will stay with you.

We ordered beer can tempura fish and dajaj chermoula for starters. Both were amazing.
For main course we went for nawabi dum ki murg along with zafrani sheermal, both amazingly tasty, and grilled fish.¬†
Jack daniels mousse as desert was also too good.
And all the above items were suggested by the staff.
Very nice place, will definitely come back.

This place was in our wishlist for a long long time. So we visited Spice Kraft one Tuesday evening. The staff members were very courteous and extremely helpful. They helped us in choosing the right dishes. So here are the things we ordered-
1. Tangarita- A very refreshing drink and a good appetizer. Reminded me of jaljeera.
2. Beer Can Tempura Fish- A very popular dish which definitely lived up to its name. A uniquely prepared bhetki preparation which left us craving for more.
3. Red pepper prawn- A familiar Chinese dish. Quite a good preparation.
4. Dejaj Charmoula- Its unique presentation amused us the most. Served in small pots, this succulent chicken dish is definitely a must have if u want to redefine kababs.
5. Devilled Crab Meat- Two de-boned crabs baked in cheese...A must have for all cheese lovers.
6. 100% Jack Daniel Chocolate Mousse- A signature dish of this restaurant, it was truly a foodies' delight. Served with sweetened sponge cakes, it allowed us to alter the sweetness in every bite. One of the best desserts I've ever tasted.

And atop that, the chef came to us and shared all the thoughts and concepts behind each dish we ordered.
Truly, a remarkable experience.

I visited the place yesterday with an old Friend of mine. The decor was subtle and good. But the service they provide is commendable. We ordered the coq-Au-vin and shepherd's pie for main course. Since we visited the place for the first time these two were the waiters' suggestions. And undoubtedly both of them tasted heavenly. We were simply blown away..the portions they serve are calculated to be exact- not too much not too less..in drinks we ordered blue frappe(non-alcoholic) and Long Island iced tea..they tasted good too..overall a great experience..looking forward to visit the place again.

I have visited this place 2 times so far in the last one month.

My first experience with this place was very exquisite. The location of this restaurant is very easily accessible on the mouth of Hazra Road.

I had ordered 2 cocktails namely Bellini - Peach Snaps + Sparkling Wine and Margarita - Tequila + Cointreau + Lemon juice. Both the drink were absolute perfection and were mixed in proper proportion and tasted really well. The prices of the drink are not very high. Just slightly more than the standard prices in other restaurants.

Among food items I had ordered Green Chilly Chicken in starters and Pan Fried Cantonese Noodles. The Green Chilly Chicken was one of the best chilli chicken items that I have ever had in Kolkata. Hands down. It had a unique taste and not very generic like other places. The Cantonese Noodles was also prepared very well.

Since I loved this place so much the first time, I thought of giving it another go after a few days. But to my amazement, it was a very disappointing experience this time. And I had never expected something like that to happen with Spice Kraft's reputation. 
I had ordered Poh-Pia (which is basically a chicken spring roll) which was very good until I discovered somebody's hair in the food item which was a complete turn-off due to obvious hygienic issues. Very angry at this behavior, we returned the food item and they gave us a fresh dish in return and there was no such problem this time. But then, again we ordered a Green Chilly Chicken item since it was my favorite from the first visit. But this time it was hands down the worst Chilli Chicken experience of my life. The chicken tasted nothing like the first time. It had a rotten smell and taste in some of the chicken pieces and felt as if they were stale. It was absolutely inedible. I was totally pissed and angry at the cook and the staff for ruining both the dishes we ordered that day.
But the waiter and manager were very understanding and didn't bill us for the item and apologized for this unfortunate incident and even requested us to stay so that they can make up for it by giving us a free item. But we didn't take their offer though it was a good gesture from their behalf.

PROS :
1. Outstanding service (4.5/5)
2. Polite and good communicating staff (5/5)
2. Good food (3.5/5)
3. Not very high price with respect to the food taste. (3.5/5)
4. Good collection for drinks (4.5/5)

CONS : 
1. Highly inconsistent due to which I rated this place 3.5 instead of a 4.5. (2.5/5)
2. Since it is a small area, the tables were too small for 2 sitters. (3/5)

This place is absolutely a wonder! You won't be able to imagine just how innovative food can get if you do not try these whackily amazing dishes!
They take their fish to an entirely different level. I am not the biggest fan of their chicken, but the fish leaves you spellbound. If they could improve on their chicken, this could be the perfect place for a Saturday night dinner!
Very friendly staff. Very prompt service. Reservation is recommended if you want a table on a busy Saturday night like this. Overall, they make sure you only leave with a positive experience. It's a perfect 10 for hospitality.

Must haves : Beer can tempura fish, the baked fish wellington, and the Jack Daniels moose! Their virgin mojito just became my favourite.

Kudos to the thought that serves food in the most crafted way possible. Yes you got it right, the name is an apt one. 
I am in love with the cocktails served here. Each one is so soul soothing.
Coming to the food, the taste is okayish but the way they serve them deserves special mention.
The interior is good. Last time I went there I didn't write any review because of the corner suffocating table allotted to us. The staff is good, they help you choose the food according to your taste.

________________________________________
Location: It is located in Ballygunge near Hazra Law college.
Ambience: The restaurant has two separate sitting areas, with comfortable warm sitting arrangement. The tables are placed perfectly so that there isn't eavesdropping, and one can enjoy delicious food with their close ones.
Food & beverages: Drums of Heaven surely one of their best starters, Pork Rib was amazing and you have to try their beer batter tempura fish from the presentation to the taste everything was top class. Tried quite a few salads and mains on my previous visits. For Beverage my friend ordered Kokumrita, I settled for their version of Pinacolada which was something really amazing.
Great Job Guys. All the best for future.

Supportive staffs with excellent courtesy and service. Will visit again and suggest others. Amazing Continental food with some drinks. The location of the restaurant is a bit confusing else it's worth the effort. I had a memorable day..always will be there in the diary of my life....... Reviews are really important , now I know... they drove us to the restaurant. Kokum Rita and Carlsberg, with lingering Red Pepper Prawn and Coq-Au-Vin and others..Keep it up Spice Kraft!

The new player in town, Spice Kraft has garnered quite a loyal customer base in a very short span. After seeing a number of check-ins in Facebook, I knew I had to try it out.

We ordered a Kokumrita: a play on the classic margarita, the Three Steps to Heaven: their version of the long island ice tea and another, whose name I cannot remember, for drinks. The cocktails had quite a big punch of alcohol, and were well mixed.
                                                                ...

Pretty good place with the price ranges they have. The beer battered fish is absolutely amazing. Go for this dish if not anything else. They have their serving styles pretty much sorted. The service is pretty good as well with good recommended actions from the menu. Sometimes they can be a bit rushed as well. A cocktail recommendation would be their kosmopolitan hazelnut cocktail. Absolute treat this one. Another treat is the black dog package treat they have. 700 for 3 pegs.
I would go back again. The other specialties and desserts next time.

Looking at the reviews of this place, I had gone in with some expectations. It bugs me to say that many of them got dashed. 

Firstly, we had made a reservation a day in advance because we had anticipated that it might be crowded on a Sunday night. 
So when we arrived we liked the fact that they had valet parking spots but that's where it all stopped. The pleasant points. 

Upon entering, we gave our names and let the waiter-in-charge know that we had a reservation but despite two empty tables right there in front of us, they kept us waiting for 10 mins while they decided where to place us and looked downright confused. It was sort of embarrassing to stand right there in the middle of the restaurant, looking haplessly at them. 

Finally after much discussion they seated us. Then the wait for the menu card begins. Another 10 mins later, we are handed a severely-reduced menu that apparently was specially made for Jamaishashthi. Since none of the things on the limited offerings appealed to us, we asked for the main menu. Now, here there was much confusion again. They kept on insisting that the two page menu is the one available and that is indeed the ONLY menu. When we insisted further and after having to ask for 3 more times, we were served the main menu. Only to be told, half of the things aren't available. 

We settled finally on Penne Alfredo Pasta with Chicken and Mushrooms, Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken in Soya Chilli. We also order a drink, Blue Frappe.  

The drink was served readily and was quite refreshing and deliciously sweet. 

The food arrived next. The Mixed Rice was decent. You cannot really go wrong there. The Soya Chilli Chicken was really scrumptious. I loved it. But. 

The Penne Alfredo Pasta. Worst Pasta of my life. I was expecting a warm, cheesey affair of Pollo and Fungi. Instead it turned out to be a bland, under-seasoned, overcrowded with Beans, Carrots and even, Cauliflower. Chicken was generously added and surprisingly NO MUSHROOM. Yet specifically the menu mentions mushrooms. 

I had to ask them to change it, which they almost seemed reluctant to do. 

Coming to dessert we couldn't try a lot, simply cause they weren't available. We ended up with a Monte Carlo, a concoction which was nothing more than vanilla ice cream, brownie crumbles and chocolate sauce. 

So, overall pretty disappointed.

i am enthralled of this place. like from the time i have visited Calcutta for my summer break, have already been here thrice and have been recommending people to go here for all the cocktail and gastronomical food presentation and mind-boggling food too. ¬†at a confusion where to go for lunch and after all the Zomato-ing we zeroed on Spice Kraft. the decor was classy and the service was brilliant. i am glad the tradition of ¬†Chefs coming and asking for feedback is creeping in Calcutta. the food was out of the world. we had ordered squid rings in butter garlic, lobster thermidor, dajaj chermoula,moon faan, chicken in chilly oyester and mushroom,baked fish wellington. for drinks we had ordered pina colada, lemon grass shocker, blue electric and and chivas julep and 100% jack daniels mousse for desert. i must say from the choice of having a great expansive menu of food and drinks makes this place my Calcutta favourite destination . will be visiting this place pretty often . thumbs up to chef sambit :)

What an amazing experience! I'd been there with my friend who had convinced me to try out this place.It's not a very spacious restaurant,but they've utilized the space so well and it's compensated with the lip-smacking food. We had ordered green chilli chicken for starters which was very unique(actually green in colour). I wanted to have aampanna and curry patta shikhanji but it was a cocktail.However the waiter was generous enough to quench my thirst by making it non alcoholic! My friend had ordered an all time favourite virgin mojito.

For main course,we'd chosen a baken fish wellington,the fish was fresh and topped with cheese. The other dish was coq-au-vin,this was another finely served continental recipe with butter rice and chicken,mushrooms,onions. It had a sweet taste but was quite cheesy.

The quantity was great and hence we had no more appetite for desserts which we plan to try next time. The best part of this dinner was when the chef came out to interact with us,looking for feedback and suggestions! That's a very nice gesture and makes one believe that the restaurant believes in quality and customer satisfaction!

Winning and Wow!üòÉ
- The restaurant is a pescatarian's delight!
- Variety that weaves world cuisine with a contemporary touch
- Lymwn Sak and Mahi malai kebabs are very refined dishes. No overpowering flavours, and grilled tenderly to perfection. The mint-yogurt dip was a surprising burst of freshness
- Chaitini encore! It's well known how vodka pairs up very well with dairy, and chaitini exemplifies just that and more. Masala cutting chai, milkmaid ( I would steal it from the fridge as a child) and vodka in a giddily smooth blend!
- Prawn Balchao - a flavour packed Goan main course dish. Not as fiery as the original (relief right there!) but spices that smack your tongue to delight. Unlike Indian gravies that mostly negate all flavour of the protein in it, the tiger prawns retained their identity.
- Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce, served with buttered rice. Classic continental done the way it should be. 
- Bang for your buck! Very very competitively priced.
- Personal interaction with the chef and owner, Sambit, who is happy to explain the dishes to you

Ummmokay! üòê
- Prawn in coriander sauce for starters was intensely flavourful but not a very balanced dish. Oily, overpowering, over cooked and chewy. It hits your palate for wrong reasons.
- Blue Empire cocktail was cloyingly sweet.
-  Service was a tad slow with occasional confusion in the team. I hope these are just teething problems.
- Water droplets from the aircon falling plonk amidst water glasses and cocktails on our table

This was our special occasion and to savour the moment we decided to zero in on new restaurant that we hadn't yet tried and that led us to Spice kraft, right opposite Hazra Law college.
Ambience-wise a 3/5: nothing to sweep you off your feet. Just another quaint eatery with soft lighting, leather backed chairs and glass topped tables. Having been allotted the extreme-est of corner tables we were actually in want of a more airy place.
Now coming to the food: We had heard about the molecular gastronomical delights that this place serves and were eager to try them. Sadly for us though, it was the "Jamai sosthi" special menu that greeted us which wayyy compressed than what they actually serve (as per the menu card on zomato)
For starters we ordered a draught beer pitcher along with green chilly chicken and pork in plum sauce. While the chilly chicken was nothing extraordinary,the pork simply stole the show. Sweet and spicy at the same time and very well cooked,it was the best pork we've had anywhere(and that's saying something).For the mains we ordered Shepherds pie. The minced meat and the cheese made for a delicious combination.
However it was probably the dessert which ended up being the star of the day. We had ordered gold dust sprinkled mousse and Bouy! It was heavenly..I am literally out of words to explain the kind of taste we experienced- a must try for anyone visiting the place.
The meal for two with alcohol came to around 2k and that was quite reasonable given the quantity of food that they serve. Also the waiters are extremely helpful,often popping in with helpful suggestions when we enquired about the menu.
Will go back again for the full menu and a better experience next time

A friend decided to treat 6 of us at Spicekraft today. I must say that the ambience and the music playing in the background makes for a good romantic atmosphere for lovebirds but the food must be tried by all. Little lacking in space but the vide array of cocktails n food makes up for it. 
We went for shepherd's pie,chicken stroganoff,coq-au-vin and baked fish wellington. I must say the quantity and quality of food is great, especially matching up to the prices. My friends tried a margarita and sangria. And we had the classic monte carlo for dessert which was another yum!
Definitely going back to try out more. And kudos to the staff, very helpful and friendly.

I went there with a friend a few weeks back and I was very impressed with the food. It easily has one of the most innovative and original menus of any restaurant in the city. The prawn tempura was delicious and so was the sauce that it was served with. The beer batter fried fish gets 10/10 for its presentation but the fish itself was a tad overfried. However, the orange tartare ponzu dip it came with more than compensated for that. The shepherd's pie was also very good even though its a slight variation from the original recipe. 

Update : Ordered the Deviled Crab, Arab style fish (don't remember the name), and red pepper prawns. Suffice to say, each dish was nothing short of excellent in its own right. The cocktails are affordable and very well made, that is to say, the cocktails aren't simply and hastily "mixed" like in most places. 
I have two criticisms nonetheless. Please introduce more prawn based appetizers and if possible introduce a dessert with bitter chocolate/low sugar content(I know it's already there but it's still a bit sweet).

Having heard multiple good reviews we finally decided to step in to celebrate one of our friends birthday.It is conveniently located a few 100 metres from the road connecting hazra from ballygunje phari.
Looking at the exterior, it may not give the full idea of the place inside however once you enter its a totally different world.The seating is not too large but is well utilised.
Music,dim blue lights added more to the ambience of the place.
One of our friends,a regular here was greeted by the manager who took a considerable amount of his time in recommending the dishes.
We started with Margherita and Sangria.
We opted for Chicken Stroganoff,Sheperds Pie,Fish Wellington and Coq-Au-Vin. 
Shepherds pie was awesome with crunchy bread and minced lamb pieces in creamy potato crust.
The Chicken Stroganoff,a hugely popular russian dish was garlic bread and cheese and chicken in white wine and bell peppers.
The coq-au-vin, a chicken preparation in red wine was served with parsley rice and the Fish wellington was baked bhetcki in cheese sauce.
We ended with Monte carlo as desserts which had choco sticks in vanilla and chocolate icecream.
At the end they were kind enough for a complimentary birthday cake for our birthday boy.
The best thing apart from the food was the pattern of the foods in which they were served.
Definetely coming back again to try out the remaining dishes.
Cheers!!

Situated near Hazra Law College, this place is quite easy to locate. The ambiance and decoration of the restaurant is quite good. Amongst the cocktails, we had ordered the Molecular Infusion which were Spicy Pomegranate, Cointreau and Tonic, Smoke Guava, Captain Morgan and Ginger Ale and Roasted Pineapple, Beefeater Gin and Lemonade; starter was Beer Can Tempura Fish. For entrees it was Pork Ribs Burrah Kebaab, Shepherd's Pie and Coq - Au - Vin. The Pork Ribs were absolutely mind blowing.

As they say don't judge a book by its cover,exactly this place looks very small and not that fancy from outside but as as you enter your mind will be blown away by the innovative and classy interior. It's a complete food heaven for people who are looking for a fine place to spend a nice evening or an afternoon lunch.. And the staff there are so so sooo nice, gives you such a nice welcome and treats you so very nicely you will be bound to fall in love with the place.Now coming to the food.. I don't think I have enough words to describe the food quality here.

A tip I would like to give,anyone going there.... please ask for the chef's recommendation for your food, he will guide you according to your taste bud starting from the appetiser to the desert.

We started with the Dajaj Chermoula and this is a dish i will highly recommend for anyone who eats chicken.. Because as soon you take your first bite it will straight away melt like an ice cream. Then we had beer can Tampura Fish which was equally delicious , then comes the dish which presentation was way special. It's called Bacardi limon infused tandoori chicken sausages.Again if you don't mind alcohol it's another highly recommended dish.

I simply love their unique way of presentation.. And of course the food there will make you go there again and again..¬†

Over all review from whatever we had:
Drinks : 4.5/5
Food : 5/5
Presentation : 5/5
Stuff's behaviour : 5/5
Ambience : 4.5/5

Anyone who is looking for a fancy budget friendly yet classy place its the right place for you. It's a must try place for anyone who loves good food. Trust me you will get hooked to this place.

This is an amazing place, which surprises me everytime I visit. So just pointing out what makes this place so lovely.
1. Ambience - with nice decor and nice lux level the place is nice to look at. Added to it is music. lovely instrumentals varying from floyd to beatles to bollywood at the right decibel makes this place perfect to have food, grab some drinks and enjoy.
2. Cocktails - cocktails are properly made and in addition you can chose whether to make it with smirnoff or with absolute keeping in mind of your pocket pinch.
3. Food - Nothing to say. Come here and get surprised. Some must are - Dajaj Chermoula, Pork ribs burrah kebab, Khor khog, baked fish Wellington. 

**In addition all rates are friendly too your pocket**

These guys have set up a restaurant with proper professional approach; where you eat n drink and always go out with good memories. KUDOS to SPICE KRAFT team.

My husband and I decided to go to Spice Kraft couple of weeks ago on a sunday afternoon. We had invited a friend to join us based on the many good reviews on zomato. Upon entering the restaurant we were struck by this strong stink. We moved around a bit and it was everywhere. Unable to stand the foul atmosphere and surprised at how the customers on the few other occupied tables were okay with it, we immediately stepped out. We had to of course call our friend and apologise for the extremely poor choice of place and had to replan the evening.

This place was recommended by a friend. And to be absolutely honest, it did not let me down. The food was top notch. The options for thw drinks was surprisingly varied. Jad the jack black and shepherds pie. Was a wholesome experience. Though if I had to complain, may be a bit of fast service would have served as the icing on the cake.

Sometimes we do come across people or place, when looked back at, will leave a curve of a smile on our face. Yesterday the same happened when we visited this cosy corner named Spice Kraft. Although it was just yesterday eve but I am already missing the warm ambience, warmer food and warmest treatment. Beer can Tempura fish, Squid rings in garlic sauce n Dajaj Charmoula were all like little (well not so little pieces) of heaven melting in our mouths. Before having the dessert 100% Jack Daniels, the chef personally explained us how it was made n how to actually have it. It was very much evident how much he loves everything that goes around the place. While having our dessert, he again came n asked us about our experience. Forgetting about every etiquette in the book, I with my mouth full, almost mumbled 'out of this world'. I wanted to say more but resented doing so because I didn't want to waste a single moment doing anything but having it. It was that heavenly. All of this keeping in mind that I am not even a dessert person (technically a boozert).
I never bother writing reviews especially about a joint but this one is worth penning down. All of us should at least once (definitely no one can stop it at ' just once') visit Spice Kraft n realize what actually the Art of good food is.

P.S. Thank u Zomato for being a lighthouse to the lost souls like us, always craving for wow moments.

This new kid on the block is already on my very short list of favourite places to eat. Beautiful decor with soothing lights and glass bottles adorning the walls, as well as some amazing instrumentals accompanying the meal. I have been there twice. The cocktails are the main reason- affordable, well mixed and hits you just at the right spot! The Margharita, LIIT and Hammerjack deserve special mention. The fish tempura with the ponzu tartare and the drums of heaven kept me wanting for more. The devilled crabs were buttery and melt in the mouth, undoubtedly one of the best I've had. ¬†However the dejaj charmoula was a bit let down, I was expecting it to be spicier. Among the main courses, the chilly garlic noodles were perfectly done. Along with the oyster sauce and mushroom chicken, it was more than enough for three people (after all the starters). ¬†The jack daniels mousse was presented beautifully, and kept its promise of being a "boozert". The staff is extremely courteous and along with Mr. Sambit Banik, the owner, they helped us order the dishes. The only letdown was when we girls were not allowed in the inner section of the restaurant which was supposedly only for stags. The gender bias was a bit absurd and unexpected. Hope they'll look into it in the coming days.

I had this wish to visit the place for the last six months. I finally got lucky and went there with a friend of mine. The place from outside looks very ordinary. But the inside decor is very comfy and Cosy. They have huge variety of liquor. We visited it at around 2p.m. Ordered Cranberry Screwdriver and Virgin mojita as our drinks. For the starter we opted for the very recommended Beer can tempura fish, which I really loved. Perfectly fried. We had Coq-au-vin which was recommended to us by the staff assisting us. We chose garlic bread with it, instead of parsley rice. Honestly, the quantity and the food, all was worthy. Didn't go hard with our pockets. Lastly, their hospitality and management is way too good. We all want that personal interaction and to be looked up. The chef, he is a lovely man. I'm writing this review because of him only. A Happy lunch.

I visited this restaurant just yesterday with my family. A lot has already been said about the quality of food here so I won't dwell much on it. I can only add that this is one place I'd love to visit again and again. Not only for the delicious food but also for the service. 

To take forward the service quality, I was pleasantly surprised to find the owner as well as the head chef (sorry, cannot recollect the name) regularly visiting all its guests and making sure if they were satisfied with the food that was being served. Towards the end of our meal, a family of nine pax came and were sitting at a table next to us. Strangely, they were not happy with the table and how it was set up, and they just started creating a ruckus over it. The waiters kept assuring them that if they were not happy, they will change the table, but to just give them some time. Still, they kept arguing over it and became a nuisance not only for us, but other guests too. This went for nearly 15-20 mins and even on being reassured by the owner, they kept arguing and just wouldn't let go. We were nearly at the end of our meal as it is, but we're feeling sad for the other guests who were gonna come in. 

On our way out, we were surprised to see the owner waiting for us near the exit to apologise to us because of the disturbance caused to us by that family. He did not really need to do that but for him to do that was really appreciated. That shows the kind of care he takes in making sure that the guests not only enjoy the food at his restaurant but also have a good time. This kind of dedication towards customer satisfaction is very rare. This is what takes a customer back to any place. The food at any place can be top notch but if the service isn't, then we might think twice before going back there. But at Spice Kraft the food is awesome and the service and care towards its guests is even better. 

Keep up the good work. 

I strongly recommend this place to everyone.

Finally managed the time to visit this place. The first thing that strikes you is its cozy ambience and servers who welcome you with a smile.
We started of with a Sangria and a Margarita....the Sangria was okayish,the margarita was very well blended. Since both of us were proud tipplers...  we just had a lot of starters and drinks. First up was beer can tempura fish...which evoked mixed reactions. The fish was very well fried,the batter crispy and the insides moist...but the dip let me down. 
Pork ribs burrah kebab was succulent,smoky and overall a cracker dish.
The drums of heaven was okayish...the weird part was we had asked for the old monk flambe but they forgot about it. That was disappointing.
The devilled crabs were, again,a gastronomic delight. Creamy moist beautifully cooked crab meat which left you craving for more.
We had pegs of 100 pipers to wash these down. I also tried one of their molecular infusions, the roasted pineapple with gin. It was innovative and refreshing... and I've never had a spicier cocktail.
The presentation was breathtaking in all of the dishes. Ended the night on a high note with their fabled Jack Daniel's mousse,which again turned out to be just the right amount of sweet and feather-light.
A never-seen-before kind of a place,one I hope to return to try out their other offerings.

Located near hazra law college this place is easy to identify. The ambiance and decoration of the restaurant is quite good. We took dajaj charmoula, beer can tempura fish as starters and devilled crab and 100% JD mousse as mains and desert. Dajaj charmoula was the best of all and tasted awesome. The fish was also very good with the right texture and taste and the flesh just melts in the mouth. The sauce with the fish was superb and paired with the tempura fish very well. Another star of that day was the desert. It tasted unique as well as awesum and chef Vimal who was attending us explained us the way to make it. We took hazelnut heaven as cocktail which tasted good but not exceptional. Another great thing we liked about this place is that the head chef of the restaurant Sambit personally interacts with everybody. Will be visiting again to their other dishes.

Small place. Doesn't seem much from the outside or inside for that matter. 
But, the food we got was great value for money. We had tempura fish in beer can(too much batter), lymyn samak or some weirdly named Arabic fish dish which was divine, shepherd's pie(okayish, comes with garlic bread), fish Wellington(very cheesy, comes with rice) and some kashmiri minced mutton dish(bit on the sweeter side, but I liked it) with garlic naan(hard naan).
The place is  pricey and including drinks it cost us around 2700. And also, the dip for the fried fish wasn't enough so we asked for more dip which was chargeable but we weren't informed about it(55 bucks)!
Might go back if in the area.Might.Not confident.

Undoubtedly one of the best outlets to bring cuisines across the globe on your plate. The decor is quite pompous with lights of various hues and graceful chandeliers. We started with an entree of bhetki in beer batter with a sweet mayo, served in beer can lying on a wooden board. It was pretty delicious. The ampanna and curry patta mojito was unique and fragrant. The milkmaid chaitini with vodka was too sweet to my taste, would have liked a balance.
Maincourse made my evening with the Vietnamese fried rice and the pork rendang curry. The pork dish is the best I've had till date. It was out of this world and everyone should try it or you will miss a masterpiece. We ended with a jack Daniels infused chocolate mousse served with sponge cakes and an orange jelly. Don't miss this one either. 
After having done with our food, the owner cum the chef came up personally and asked for the review. The way chef sambit made us feel warm and welcome along with serving wonderful food just elevated the whole experience by a notch. His passion and dedication for food echoes in all his dishes. This restaurant will go places and I'm definitely revisiting it.

The food and the garnishing were totally different from any other restaurants in Kolkata...

One of the great things I found was the menu changes in every occasion...

Another thing is very good that the cheff comes to every table, introduce himself to the tables...

Lovely experience....and yes the food was really delecious....

The place which incorporates the theories of Heston Blumenthal's molecular gastronomy and doesn‚Äôt burn a hole in your pocket when you are in the mood for some some French or Asian inspired entr√©es or traditional British or French mains. Had the Soy based drums of heaven for appetizers and it was okay. But what really won me over was their Coq Au Vin. They do have other the Asian and Indian food for mains, but I couldn‚Äôt possibly comment as I haven‚Äôt tried them. My main gripe would be limited fare in the Continental department. There should be more options for us well versed with the European cuisine landscape. Their desserts also incorporate modern cooking techniques and stand out amongst otherwise monotonous fare Kolkata restaurants. I must admit their outstanding 100% Jack Daniels Swiss Chocolate Mousse tasted really unique. Though I would have liked some lime infused element instead of orange as the citrus component and probably addition of some raspberry coulis. The spirits menu is quite extensive for Kolkata standards and the prices are on the lower side too. The staff was quite courteous as well. This place would rank in the top 10 of my Kolkata fine dining list if not top 5. And that too on a budget. More restaurants and bars like this please!

After seeing a lot of reviews of this restaurant I decided to give it a try. The restaurant is located on the main Hazra Road near to the Hazra Law College. The place is dimly lighted with classy and sober decorations. We ordered two drinks one of which was a cocktail named "Tangy mandarin and lemon grass schocker". It was very light and smooth. Then we ordered two dishes one was a appetizer - Dajaj Cherloula and other a main course shepherd's pie. Both were yummy and it was a food lovers paradise. The chicken appetizer was soft juicy and full of flavours and the pie was very very filling and very tasty. The owner kept coming to the table and personally asked about our experience which was really a great gesture. Overall a very great experience. They also have happy hours. I'm definitely going back. Cheers!!

Special day for me, so the choice of the more unique places of Kolkata. Went there on the 25th of May.
The ambiance of the place is adequate. Not too flashy but just the right amount of lights, seats and decorations make it a decent place to sit and let your taste buds have a good experience.
So we ordered the hits- Tempura Fish served in a Budweiser Can and Pork Ribs. The beer tempura fish was amazing and it gives you the right flavours of fish and the batter. The pork ribs is another really amazing dish this place offers.
The cocktails can be way better, though. The manhattan was not up to the mark and neither was the draught beer anywhere great.
The bill however was just right. Doesn't pinch your pocket. The service was a little slow but that was okay as I was in no hurry.
This place deserves a 4.5* just for the amazing flavours their dishes offer. Shall return soon to try the other delicacies on offer.

Visited today with 3 friends for a get together in this gastronomy themed restaurant. This was in my wishlist for long! But somehow couldn't manage to visit. As it is a weekday it was not much crowded. So the moment we entered it was a bit awkward as it was empty. But the hall inside had guests. We first ordered guava and pineapple infusion cocktails. Both were nice. Later on we had ordered sangria and liit. Sangria was good. Liit could have been better though. In food we had orderes dajaj charmoula, beer can tempura fish, soy braised drums of heaven and in dessert we had 100% jd. The infusions and creativity is very much appreciated. Food was tasty and upto the mark. So was the interior and behaviour of staff. Enjoyed the whole experience. Would definitely visit soon for more!

Its hard to find words to write a review, when the food does all the talking.
This is one such place which I chanced upon today, and I'm glad it happened to me.
The interiors and service are good, but so it is in most other places. What sets Spice Kraft apart is the food, and the way its brought on the table. "Molecular Gastronomy".. Fancy word, but never quite experienced it until today.
The place is owned and spearheaded by Sambit Da. He is a learned chef who knows his art, and is on a mission to blow us away with his skills and innovativeness. I was lucky to have met him, and he guided me through the food tour today.

We started with the 'deconstructed papri chat shots'. It looks pretty basic initially, until you take it in and be blown when the ingredients melt in your mouth.

Then came the round of drinks.
'Red Grape & Basil Twisted' and 'Aampanna & Curry Patta Shikanji Mojito'. They were fine.

Now coming to the 2 items which were the reasons behind the high rating.

1] Bacardi Lemon infused Tandoori Chicken sausage. That's right. It's nothing like anything. The outer layer actually tastes tandoori whilst the core is, well, sausage. Must try this one.

2] Beer can Tempura Fish. A coated fish dish served in beer can. Absolutely loved it. It's a wonder how such a place as this serves some quintessential Bengali tasting food. I firmly recommended this too.

After the round of awesome starters came the mains.

First came the 'Baked Fish Wellington' which is bhetki with mushrooms in cheese sauce served with safron rice. The cheese was slightly over done, but the fish tasted fresh and had a great flavor.

The came 'Coq-Au-Vin' which is Roast chicken with mushrooms again, mixed with red wine and served with buttered rice. The chicken was fresh and juicy, despite being thoroughly cooked. Order this if you like spicy food though.

We wrapped it up by trying the '100% Jack Daniels Chocolate mouse with Orange sauce'.
There is a certain way you eat this stuff, and once again I was guided through.

It was an eventful day, and i came out more knowledgeable. This isn't a Barbeque Nations or an Arsalan, make no mistakes. They have their own niche and are doing great at that. What we needed was a Spice Kraft, and we got one now. Drop by, if you're in the vicinity, make a plan if you're not. Even if you somehow don't like the food, be rest assured, of you get a chance to meet this man, you'll come out a more enlightened person on food and sundry. I wish them well. Cheers!


                                          ...

Sunday GNO and evening out with two of my besties. It turned out to be an evening well spent. We asked the chef to suggest a whacky cocktail with tequila and a popsicle and there we had our orange chili concoction. I'd have preferred it be a little less sweet with more chilli but two of my friends had no complaints so I may be wrong. For starters the pork ribs barra kebab is what two of us were pretty decided on and ended up ordering two of those. As we did with these cheesy chicken poppers which wasn't on the menu but rustled up by the chef on special request from my chicken-atarian friend. For mains I had a lobster thermidor... I know I know with four starters how did we have room for more. But when it comes to cheesy lobsters, this Bong (Ghoti) girl will always make room. A really nice platter of jack daniels mousse (very shareable I might add) resulted in debilating food coma. We had to roll out of the restaurant, couldn't walk. Another plus point with their cocktail menu...it's so fun that I have yet again managed to miss the wine list. And they have a pretty nice one! Dammit!

I just been today to spice kraft with my friends. And I loved the restaurant from their logo to interior to service to drink to food ( sorry for using too much TO üòú) .  The problem for the restaurant is the space,we can adjust that if the foods are  up to the mark. 
In a starter we ordered beer can tempura fish and salt pepper octopus with the lichitini smirnoff and margarita . The pepper salt octopus is awesome and it's has a after taste effect which is quite different. Beer can tempura fish is their signature dish, orange ponzu tartare' is like cherry on the cake. 
In main course we shifted to Indian cuisine. We order butter nan , peas polav, nawabi dum ka murg and lal mas. 
Nan is usual , no any other differences to others. Peas polav is simple with perfect use of ghee and sweet but the disappointment is Lal mas, as its described super spicy and hot. We didt even taste the existence of salt there. 
Now about the deserts , a must try is jack danial musse. It's yummy !!! socked jack danial into sponge cake with chocolate musse and Monti Carlo is good too. 
Love the service there and the portion of the food is good. They loved to help you and understand your appetite and taste. 
Here you are SPICE KRAFT , hoping to visit you soon.

This restaurant is an innovative initiative which mixes up molecular gastronomy, designed presentation and proper taste. Located near ballygunge, this new food joint is well known this days for its signature cocktails. The drinks were nice and its innovative presentation will bring a glow to your eyes. The foods were also well cooked and tasty. Among various items, the Indian dishes were good. The staffs were also quiet courteous. Overall one will have a nice time over this place

Spicekraft has become one of my favourite places in town. It is located just opposite the Hazra law college, so not difficult to find, at all. 
The place has one of the most hospitable staff I've ever come across. Chef Sambit himself was extremely warm and friendly. 
Amazing cocktails, amazing food, especially the desserts. Oh, the desserts! Innovative and amazingly delicious, the Jack Daniels Mousse served as the perfect ending to a perfect meal. 
Initially the prices seem a bit high, but it's worth the experience. 
Here is a personal request to the chef. Please get us the happy hours you told us about!!

Spice Kraft. The only restaurant that received a 5 rating from me. It started its journey last puja and already has won everybody's heart. The owner/manager has a BM degree from XLRI showing pedigree and dedication. 
We went with our friends for a party to this place because they served both food and alcohol at a reasonable price. And boy did we make a good decision. Nothing was short of brilliant, be it the ambiance, the service people or the food. If you have to go anywhere to dine go here. Period. And as always Bon appetite...

B'dy treat last week. And, it was almost full even in 1300hours.
Interior is quite good, good feel ambience.
Menu covers huge number of dishes.
Ordered items, they were nicely prepared and being served with a very good touch of garnishing. Presentation matters, so thumbs up for the effort.
Chef is a very nice person. He suggested one dish, we tasted , but nothing like as he said.
Beer prices are reasonable.
Staffs are good.
Everything went smooth more or less, but it was not a good experience when they requested to pay by cash due to malfunction of card reader. Simply not expected.
Lastly good food , you can have a try. You will not be disappointed , spend quality time with your loved ones! :)

This place! It's a foodie's paradise. The restaurant was full and we had to wait a good one hour. However the fruit of patience was truly sweet. Such a beautifully decorated restaurant it is.
For starters we opted for the beer battered tempura fish. Watching your delicacy arrive in a beer can with slaw and dip meticulously laid out on a wooden spoon like tray is such a treat for the eyes. The fish was very impressive. The orange favour of the dip was a strange combination.
Then for mains we had chicken couq a vin and lobster thermidor. Couq a vin had a good number of succulent chicken pieces with a good amount of sauce laid out around rice. Lobster thermidor was the best out of the lot. The lobster was huge with creamy cheesy filling making it all the more better.
However all said and done they need to step up their service big time. As for food I am truly impressed and will surely be back for more.

My visit to this place was a while back but the first trip was so good. That I got the entire family here within two days of my first visit. The veg kebabs are my favourite, be it the galouti  or the keelaa phool one. I have tried their sushi but honestly it's not that great. I would recommend sticking to the Indian. Overall this is a place I would love to visit again.

Situated at a very convenient location, it is a treat for continental cuisine lovers. I visited this place with my parents for my birthday lunch. As suggested by the very amiable and enthusiastic chef we tried out his signature entr√©e, the Soy Braised Drums of Heaven which was excellently cooked and served. Baked Fish Wellington, Coq-Au-Vin and Shepherd's pie came next and these were complemented with three marvellous cocktails. Though it took a pretty long time for the food to arrive, it was definitely worth the wait. The presentation and style was definitely in abundance and every dish was highly satisfactory. It has the potential to be great. I would definitely revisit to try out their other variety of cocktails and dessert.

Spice Kraft had been in my wish list for quite some time but finally I scratch it off.
The new hotspots of gastronomy and molecular cocktail concept is new to the city. But this place is heaven for fusion food at the busy street of ballygunge phari to be precise just opposite of Quadra hospital. 

This small restro cum bar runs by Chef cum owner Mr.Sambit Banik.This man needs a appreciation for coming up with such new concept in kolkata.

The place has two sections - One is brighter and vibrant seating area and another with blue darker interior. The darker section is more of a romantic seating. 
Ambiance is nothing extraordinary just like casual dining experience. 
But always full of people and mostly crowded.. sometimes you have to wait to get yourself in.

Staffs are interactive with proper etiquette and sense of professionalism. 
Mr.Nag who was serving us were very attentive, very well informed about the menu's and was suggesting us.
Even the chef cum owner Mr.Sambit Banik came at the last for our feedback which was satisfactory in terms of hospitality. 

                 COMING TO THE FOODS
                 ----------------------------------------
 1. DAJAJ CHERMOULA- The chicken marinated with chermoula spices and char grilled gives a smoky spicy flavor. Its a chicken tangri serve with clay pot . The chicken was well cooked and was soft juicy with a mild spices just to kick your taste buds.
It was serve with yoghurt with burnt garlic.
.
2.DEVILLED CRAB MEAT - Juicy battery crab meat baked in cream and Dijon mustard just perfect. 
The velvety creamy crab meat just tantalises your taste buds. 

3.BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH- The actual Showstopper was this dish. Just perfection in every bit.The crisp layer and the fresh fish fillets that just melts in your mouth and the Ponzu tartare sauce is yummmm...MUST TRY. 

4. PINACOLADA VERSION 2050 -  Served in a martini glass the edible bubbles which on biting releases the flavors of pineapple is one unique molecular mock tail,The infusion of flavors were perfect. EXCELLENT. 

The price were reasonable and after trying all three dishes and two mock tail the bill came out around 1200 bucks. And that is totally acceptable. 
Would definitely come back for other dishes and their cocktails.
And it was a good experience in Spice Kraft.

We went on a Sunday, had to wait for 10mons only. Befor I begin I wil mention it wasn't the restaurants fault, but there was an ugly argument going on between a table of guests and the chef so the beginning itself was too unpleasant. Dinning is a matter of the complete experience and not just the food. Having said that the reason why we went there was not available, that is the molecular mixology items. Big disappointment. Tempura fish was average. Guava cocktail was too strong almost overpowering the taste. Khor khong was yummy but too spicy. Fish Wellington unfortunately I did not lik at all. All in all very average experience. I will wait for my next visit to understand, maybe that might change my perception.

Nicely decor,good music,not too loud,sitting arrangement also is very comfortable..food is awesome..special thanks to chef Banik he made a very nice pasta for us.But the service staff should be more polished because we ordered spaghetti aglio olio with chicken mushroom but he served penne mix sauce.when we asked we didn't ordered for this that time he told that spaghetti is not available. He should inform us before making food. Even they didn't inform about their last order.when we asked for another dish that time they are saying that kitchen is already close. But this thing is not only happend with me it happend in another table also I watched. But really we enjoyed the food. We will visit very soon but we hope that time we will get better service.

A sudden decision to visit this place..ambience is good..location is also very convenient..we asked for their speciality..for the starters we had charcoal grilled chicken and lymwn samak..the chicken tasted superb and the fish was so soft..for the drinks we ordered fresh lime water and Tangarita..both tasted so good..then for the main course we ordered garlic naan,mutton lucknowi dum biryani, nawabi dum ki murg and kotthu parotta.Each and every dish was up to the mark..special mention needs to be given to kotthu parotta- such an unique preparation with such nice flavours. We had monte carlo for the dessert.The food was even well presented. This place is quite pocket friendly also..for all these we just paid around Rs.1750. So this place is highly recommended and we will plan our next visit soon.

Visited there on yesterday evening after much speculations. The place had a warm ambience. The cocktails are affordable and they have some nice combo offers. We ordered dejaj chermoula, fish tempura, pork ribs, tandoori chikn sausage and shish taouk. All the dishes were lip smacking. The presentation and taste of the dishes were just more than perfect which increased our cravings. Cocktails were innovative. The martini s were really good. And even the whiskey and the beer cocktails were presented perfectly and had a rich taste. 
The staff were extremely courteous. Even the owner cum chef mr. Sambit banik was so friendly and courteous. He also suggested some of the signature dishes and also looked after each and every guests. There was another person named vimal who also took good care of the guests. 
I would hv given 5 but i sticked to 4.5 because of the margarita. It was a bit off taste. I have had some awesome margaritas elsewhere. 
It was an awesome experience altogether and would love to visit again.

Our visit to Spice Kraft on 23rd Jan night was full of drama. Firstly, the wait to get a table was really long and then the serving staff was a little muddled in taking the orders from the various tables. However, the food redeemed each and every shortcomings and we ordered Beer Can Tempura Fish, Dajaj Chemoula, Pea Polau and Chicken In Chilly Oyster and Mushroom. Each and every dish was heavenly and the presentation was pleasing to the eye. The dishes had unique taste corresponding to the region of origin. The best part was when the chef and owner came personally to the table and asked our opinion about the food. All in all the place ¬†is worth a visit and repeat visits.

The place was easily found and it was a pleasure to our eyes after the heat. Once inside, we were awed by the decor and the unique menus. The liquor menu was a fun item to visualise. We ordered a Long Island Iced Tea which was amazing. For starters we had Soy braised Drums of Heaven and oh god! It was Heaven!! Also the squid rings from the Seafood section was lovely to eat, it was a fresh palate change for us. In the main course, Shepherd's Pie won our hearts. The rich cheesy flavour along with the lamb was delicious. We had the 100% Jack Daniels chocolate dessert and the Monte Carlo. Both were wonderful. Will visit again soon.

The food is good. The beer can which is the most popular thing here didn't really impress us. The other items that we ordered were upto the expectations. The cocktails which were ordered by the chief chef were horrible and we were awestruck when we got the bill.   They were hugely expensive. So an advice don't just listen to the staff when ordering go through the menu urself and decide. The service was good and quite fast.

Visited a couple of weeks back for a sunday lunch.we went early,so didn't have to wait but beware if you plan to go anytime after 1pm.people simply started to pour in.(and their service became super slow).

The seating was comfortable,but the table was a bit cramped for the four of us once the food arrived.We had to shift that mini truck from one place to the other to make place.

Coming to food,we had the dejaj charmoula,tandoori sausages,beer batter fish and deconstructed papri chaat for starters,as suggested by the owner/chef.I have a tiny complaint here.We mentioned that we wanted something spicy.Yet the chef suggested the Dejaj Charmoula,which was very mild,overriding our wish to have khorkhog or green chilly chicken.While all the dishes were excellent to taste,I do feel he should have suggested something keeping in mind our preference,and not just the signature dishes.

The tandoori sausages were best of the lot.Simply perfect in taste.the fish was soft and crispy.The chicken was melt in mouth soft and lightly spiced.The papri chaat has a dramatic appearance and a unique appeal for anybody trying ot for the first time,but tastewise it was average.

For mains we ordered chicken coqauvin,fish wellington and rarha gosht with kuttu paratha.

I absolutely LOVED the chicken dish.it was buttery,creamy,with a sweet aftertaste of wine.I can go back for this.

The fish dish had two good sized fillets with a heavy coating of cheese and baked to golden perfection. fish was very soft. again,great to taste.

The koottu paratha was again,simply awsome.soft flat silky strips of paratha fried with scrambled egg,onions and tempered with curry leaves.can be had on its own without any accompaniment.The rarha gosht had mutton pieces in a keema gravy.while it tasted decent,it did not have that WOW factor tastewise.

For dessers we had the 100% JAck Daniels mousse.The two small scoops of lilac coloured mousse had a strong taste of Jack Daniels,which can be scooped up with the four small cakes served.Very unique in taste.

Price was reasobable for the quality and quantity.Especially the quantity of the mains was quite sufficient for two.we were full to the brim.Service,as stated in all reviews,is very slow,and you literally have to call/wave many times to catch their attention.They have a vast and varied menu,and with each person ordering something different,I believe it gets difficult for the kitchen staff,hence the delay.please look into this problem

We will definitely visit again for the other dishes.

The Coq-a-vin, fish wellington and the stroganoff were the best that we have had thus far in Kolkata, with a possible exception of maybe, SKYROOM.
Thumbs Up to Mr Banik and his team for presenting such a fabulous feast to KOLKATANS at prices that you feel like spending.
Have visited again last week, and will do so soon again.
The persons taking care of you are so cooperative - a rarity now in Kolkata restaurants!

I visited spicekraft with my friends. The place has a great ambience. Perfect place to chill out. We started with drinks first by ordering Hazelnut heaven and the cosmopolitan in mocktails. They were pretty good. Then we ordered murgh malai and Wellington baked fish. That baked fish stole my heart. It was a blissful sin. The fish was soft and there was thick creamy cheesy layer over it that will melt the moment you put it in your mouth. Then we ordered moon fan,a type of fragrant rice and  shreded lamb in masman sauce. These two items were quite good. All in all the food impressed me. A must visit for food lovers.

The ambience and decor of this place is superb. Its chic ,modern and a great place to hangout for Gen X. Never go on a Saturday or Holiday eve without a reservation. You might not find a table at all even after 1 hour wait. The first thing that strikes you is the unique imaginative artistic presentation of all the items on Menu drinks,Entrees or MainCourse. WE ordered Chivas Julep, Virgin Mojito, Spicy Promegranate + Contreau and their signature Terminator.¬†
My 3.5 rating is basically bcoz it took them ages- 45 min of wait, after lot of shouting by us, excuses by the staff and on top of that being hosted by a topshot from the hotel industry known to the Chef and Proprietor ¬†did we get our drinks and by that time we had polished our entrees Their barman had a finger cut and their was no stand in for him on Saturday Evening. Strange such a Place wouldn't have survived in Bangalore where I belong to for more than a month. ¬†But I sincerely hope they'll overcome all that. For this artistry in food served here has to survive. ¬†
For Entrees we had Devilled Eggs and devilled Crabmeat. Before this we (my Daughter and Self) were never comfortable with ¬†crab but the plating and taste was out of the world JUst fell in love with it. For main course we had Bhetki paturi though its not called by that name here. The helping was generous and taste awesome. We didn't have much appetite for desserts but how could a Bong family ever leave the table without mishti so we had Cointreau with dark fudge Tort. Lip smacking and intoxicating ¬†
Sincerely I wish to visit this place again just to enjoy their food presentation and rate them 5

I rarely give place 5 stars ....but this was one such experience...
 
Let me break it down:
 
Ambience: Nice and soothing...above average the lights and choice of music is good.
 
Service: Top Class ...they take personal care of you from the suggestions about cocktails too food menu ...the mixologist and chef come to your table to ask for feedback on each dish....
 
Food & Drinks: When it comes to finger food they are the best in town.... Had  Soy braised drums of heaven ,Beer can tempura fish ,Bacardi lime infused tandoori sausage, Pork rib burrah kabab and each and every one of them was a delight ...from the quality of the ingredients ..(The fish and chicken just melt in your mouth) to the preparation.
 
For the main course ... (it was totally up to the chef as he came for our feedback after the starters) started off with "Hong Shao Rou".(Sliced pork in Hoisin & Oyster Sauce), Hunan Fish  and Moon Faan ( Fragrant fried rice with chicken and egg)... and it was delicious ..
 
Cocktails -- Statutory warning ...the cocktails are best and the most potent I ever had in Kolkata ...they say it is molecular gastronomy ...I say golden hands of the mixologist.....we were a large group ...and got chance to taste the lot... Terminator...Hammerjack...Jamun Mary.. Liquid Bomb ...Smoked Guava + Captain Morgan ..., Kool Cucumber ...all of them are great but the award goes to Terminator, Hammerjack ( Should be renamed to " Hammer of Thor") and Jamun Mary !!!
 
A big shout out to Chef Sambit Banik and his team !!!  Hope to visit Soon

This is one hell of a restaurant which freaked me out by excelling in all the possible parameters of a restaurant's critique. With the finest of dining experience on the table, to the best of service by the staffs as well as the owner Mr. Sambit, the restaurant has already created a cult of it's own.
Coming to food, my recommendations are , well the same as their recommendations too, i.e. Dajaj Charmoula and Beer Can Tempura Fish. The fish has a unique orangy flavour that adds to the brilliance of the recipe. Besides they churn out awesome mocktails which they proclaim to be their signatures and hence insist their guests on trying them. I too recommend their mocktails as I really found them to be too unique to miss them, and Chef's special Tangerine is my favorite.¬†
All in all, the rating in Zomato speaks for this restaurant and hope that it keeps up the pride of the culinary art with the passage of time, unlike many big shots which decayed and shattered into the sands of time. Keep up the brilliant work guys, cheers !

The booze is very very cheap. That's the one thing I got away remembering. The food was with mixed feelings. Some of the dishes were good, but the simplest of things, egg fried rice was so bad, and such a god awful smell, we literally got up and ran out of the place. Go at your own risk. Unless all you intend to do is drink, then you're all set !!

It was on my card to visit this restaurant on my visit to Kolkata. Was at spice craft for lunch. While I reached their it was not much crowded. I ordered the best as recommended by the captain and by zomato reviews. Beer can tempura fish, dijaj charmula, coq-au-vin, 100% jackdaniels & last but not the least The Terminator. 
All have a good review for tempura fish although I liked it but not that good for which i will come again to this restaurant. I will come again for the terminator and coq-au-vin and will try other dishes. Had a long chat with chef Sambit a good person with special skills with blessings from lord. Hats off to you sir.

This restaurant is already creating a stir with its infused concoctions and various molecular techniques of preparing cocktails! We being a cocktail fanatic had to undoubtedly land over here.

Ambience- Nothing too extraordinary.Basic restaurant amenities with clean tables and tableware.There are two sections of the restaurant- one bright and vibrant seating area outside and another with obtrusive gleam of bleu adorning the almost dark interior.This is more of a romantic seating area.Due to lack of space,we were obliged with a table here.

Service- Proper service personnel with proper etiquette and sheer sense of professionalism.

Food &a Beverage - The Beer Can Fish & Chips was out of this world.There was something about the Orange Ponzu Tartare.We loved it.It was so gripping and an unique flavour combination we have never ever tasted.The tartar sauce had an orange marmalade aftertaste.The flavour was out of this world.We wiped the entire dip clean.I loved the dip more than the fish.The batter was crisp with soft and moist goujons(fancy word for fingers) of fish inside.The chef believes in culminating classical French techniques of cooking in every Indian dishes which though sometimes can be a disaster has been tasteful crafted and presented over here.
As for the cocktails,we selected the Spicy Pomegranate,Cointreau and Tonic Water and the Smoked Guava,Captain Morgan and Ginger Ale. The Spiced Pomegranate had more of an "Anaar chaat" flavour with strong hints of the bitter orange peel from the Cointreau and the subtle aftertaste of their infused vodka.Really refreshing.My friend is a huge Captain Morgan fanatic and he found his drink refreshing and spot on.It had the quaint taste of the masala our fruit seller used to smear over guavas.Both the tonic water and ginger ale were used as a base for the drink and did not impart much of its characteristics.
Both the cocktails were worth every penny.

Also happened to meet Chef Sambit who is a revered acquaintance of our faculty and from the same trade obviously.A light chat over his idea and conversations about the industry was an unexpected treat.

If you are interested in some no nonsense contemporary cuisine with some nice cocktails,do give this place a visit.

If we do a search in zomato for a restaurant for lunch in Ballygunj, the first restaurant that will come up in the list is Spice Kraft . So much has been achieved by this restaurant in a time where competition is ruthless and abundant. It takes more than just consistency and creativity to be in the rat race and top it . This joint has been in my bookmark for a long time and it was time to scratch it off my list . Already very well known among the food enthusiasts for being good in food presentations and also fusion , this joint is now the big daddy in Ballygunj . We went there in a Saturday afternoon lunch and were very gently greeted . Being an early bird we were lucky to have a cosy sit in the corner but as time progressed the footfalls increased and so the impression of the eatery was very clear to us . Below are certain points that are relevant to this review : -

---------------------------------------------------------------
LOCATION
---------------------------------------------------------------
Very close to ballygunj phari petrol pump . If you are coming from golpark reach the petrol pump and take the left gali and you will reach Spice Kraft easilly .

--------------------------------------------------------------
FOOD
--------------------------------------------------------------

√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó √ó
Starters :- 
√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó

1. Beer Can Tempura Fish ( 4 / 5 ) :- very innovative in the naming and presentation of  the dish but this is your "fish & chips " minus the chips and with the spice Kraft touch . These are 6 generous pieces of batter fried basas which were served hot . The pieces were tasty inspite of basa being a very tasteless dish . A very important and good point was the tartar sauce it came with , the sauce was simply yummy and it was the best thing to go with the fried basas.

2. Dajaj Chermoula ( 4.5 / 5 ) : - The dish of the day . 4 drums of chicken served in clay containers was the perfect way to start our hungry outing . This dish came before the fish starter and it rocked our appetite . The Chermoula spices are from Moroccan origin and the chicken was grilled to perfection . We had a great time dipping the leg pieces in sauce which seemed to be curd . The meat was really soft and yummy and tender . Similar to " Afghani kabaab " from azad hind ,this dish is one of the best starters you will ever have .

√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó
MAIN COURSE
√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó

1. Moon fan ( 4 / 5 ) : - This is not supposed to be your typical mixed fried rice . This is a dish from the Ming dynasty of China . The rice was supposed to be fragrant and it really was. With a little bit if lemongrass , the spices in the rice was spot on .The portion was enough for 2 people and there were generous chunks of chicken and egg . We were really pleased with our selection .

2. Roasted pork in rendang sauce ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- 
A super duper hit item . once again we are really happy with our selection . There were really proper cooked pork with no pork fats . The curry had an amazing flavour of lemongrass and ginger which complemented well with our fried rice . It's different than your normal day to day side dish like Manchurian and schezwan and trust me you will definitely like it .

------------------------------------------------------------
DESERT
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Classic monte carlo ( 4 / 5 ) :- it had everything it was supposed to have . Scoops of vanilla and chocolate with brownie in the inside . Every scoop was a delight .


Spice Kraft has immense potential to stay at the top of the list and maybe feature in the list of legendary restaurants . The 2 starters as mentioned above have already become signature items . I have noticed that almost each and everyone order them . And both of them live up to their expectations. there is a wide variety of items in the menu both food and drink so it's a plus there too. Ambience was good and the service was very prompt and courteous . We didnot have any complaints in those departments . 

Would be coming back again to try their Indian dishes , molecular gastronomy and drinks .A bug thumbs up to the team and all the very best .

As this restaurant kept springing up in my News Feed I decided to pay it a visit today. It is easy to spot- just walk a few steps down Hazra road from Ballygunge Phari. It looks cramped from outside but it's well decorated and cosy inside, though there are only a few tables.

So, based on Zomato's reviews, we ordered the Dajaj Chermoula. It was nice but don't be deceived. It is much smaller than a Tangdi- in fact, the clay pots have a small wooden block on which the chicken drumsticks are propped. I don't understand the meaning of this deception- is it not possible to find smaller pots where the wood block isn't required? At least, stuff some vegetables or anything edible in there. I don't appreciate being duped by appearance. Moreover, I am disappointed by the dip- it's yogurt! I can't imagine eating a Lebanese grill without the garlic dip Toum. And to be honest, I did not taste any lebanese spices in the chicken. Not complaining, I like my grills unspiced, but if you claim it to be Lebanese (inspired?), it should have some Middle Eastern spice mix.

Next we ordered the beer batter fish. It's good, much better than the pretentious Dajaj Chermoula. Served in a beer can, it looked nice too. The mayo was sweet and tangy, which I liked.

We asked the waiter for suggestions and he said we can try the green chili chicken. It was more like ordinary Dhania chicken with diced onions and bell peppers and chicken content was average. You can skip this.

Overall, I can say that this place is more hype than happening.

My best friend and I finally decided to check this place out after having being heard about it from everywhere and we have only one word to explain our experience, that is 'WOW'. Everything was amazing, the cocktails(Hazelnut Heaven and L.I.I.T), the food(Bacardi Limon infused tandoori chicken sausages) and the Spice Kraft team. The ambience, lighting and decor just add to the warmth of the experience. Owner-cum-chef Sambit Banik was amazing enough to come over and personally ask about our experience. Service was detailed and swift and I have to add again that the food is the crowning glory. They even helped us with giving the driver of the Uber cab, we had booked to get home, directions to get to Spice Kraft when we were of no help to him. Overall we have no complaints especially when we realized that even for perennially broke college students like us, Spice Kraft wins at affordability. Hats off team Spice Kraft. We'll be back soon.

The other day after watching a great movie went to this place for lunch. I must say they offer some great new 'concept' food here.. What they do with wine and spirits is incredible.. I do not drink and have not tasted spirits much and so in the beginning I was bit apprehensive about eating here... But as we started I knew this is not what I was thinking..We started with Beer batter fish fry which was very good but what was better was the tartar sauce they served with it which had orange in it!! Simply yum. Then we had their soy braised drums of heaven with old monk flambe.. I loved the way they balanced the spirit in the food. For the main course their pineapple based fried rice with fish ball (I don't remember the name!!), chilli octopus ands pork were great too.. The man course was not bad but the dessert completely swept me off the floor.. The 100% Jack Daniel's Mousse and the Monte Carlo was simply awesome.. I would highly recommend this place.. they know how to use their liquors proportionately..  Step in for a different experience...

To put it simply there is no other equivalent of such a place in Kolkata. Yes there are other places which serve some of the dishes better but overall experience is unparalleled. What is most pleasing is the kind of service that you get. The F&B manager oversees your orders and comes to talk about the dishes from time to time. Sometimes the head chef comes out himself to ensure everything is in order. The dips that come with the dishes are innovative . Been here thrice now and have tried quite a few of their dishes. Recommendations from my side would be DAJAJ CHERMOULA , DEVILLED CRAB ( found this slightly too cheesy though ) , PORK RIBS BURRAH KABAB, TANDOORI cocktail sausages.

I had heard a lot about this restaurant and wanted to try it out. Finally I could manage to go there on last Saturday(07.05.2016). I went for lunch with my friend around 12:20pm and already 3 tables were occupied and by the time we left nearly the whole place was filled. We ordered Kool cucumber, Cranapple driver, Beer can tempura fish( it was very crispy and the fish was of a good quality), Shepherd's Pie nd Baked fish wellington. All the dishes that we ordered were very tasty and the presentation was quite innovative. The price is reasonable keeping in mind the decor, the food quality, quantity and presentation. I am looking forward to trying out their other delicacies.

Spice Kraft is all about unique recipes and their garnishing and decoration style is really commendable.¬†
Dazaz chermoula -> I have never had so soft, light-weight chicken n any restaurant. (like kabab)
Tangarita-> A clear mock-tail ¬†was so less in sweet and refreshing
JD Mousse-> Awesome..I dont like the taste of whiskey..but I loved this desert.
A little bit disappointed by the mother's day special golgappa recipe and it was just too costly for 6 golgappas filled with mushroom and cranberry juice.

This last Saturday afternoon I decided to lunch at Spice Kraft. Valet parking made things very easy for me. Upon entering the restaurant I found it almost choc-a-block. Literally. And for some we were seated at a dark and dingy corner which was a bit claustrophobic to be frank. The large dining space inside remain led closed although the afternoon.
We wanted to order a Roasted Pineapple and Beefeater Lemonade and a Tangy Mandarin Lemon Grass Shocker. Much to our surprise we were discouraged to order the latter the reason being it isn't suited to Indian taste buds. Now I know Chef Sambit has an international culinary diploma to his name but surely his customer base is by and large Indian. To our server's evident disappointment we insisted on our order.
The beer batter tempura fish came with our cocktails. The fish was excellent and the dip tasted quite interesting with the orange marmalade inspired dip. The gin cocktail was quite different and I liked the spicy notes. The lemongrass cocktail was sweet and tangy. The aeration was done right before our eyes and that was a nice touch but could have had a bit more lemongrass in it. I wonder if our dear server friend had a role to play there.
Our next order was the Red Pepper Prawns. The prawns were well cooked and I liked the spicy and sweet flavours of the chilly plum sauce. Our final order was the pork ribs burrah kebabs. Again great flavours. Normally pork kebabs are not available anywhere but this was a pleasant surprise. The kebab spice mix with a sweet and slightly pungent drizzle atop the ribs made it a dish worth savouring. My personal favourite though was the fish. We wanted the cointreau, orange and white chocolate parfait but it wasn't available so we skipped the dessert.
Initially I was a bit taken aback with the service but the food was good. We were seated in a dark and warm corner and even the good food could not make up for that.

Spice Kraft can simply be termed as a cocktail lover's heaven. Located just opposite Ballygunge Law College, it offers a wide range of exotic and exclusive cocktails. The place has couple and stag sections- a much required feature for a bar cum restaurant. Decoration is subtle and not over the top. It presents a nice ambience with soft music playing in the background, setting the mood for a perfect romantic dinner. The staff is courteous and well-informed about the menu, throwing in their suggestions. Service is quite prompt too.  Coming to the food, they have an extensive starters list. But the main course was limited. We ordered Coq-Au-Vin and Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce. Both the items were well cooked and delicious. Will definitely come back for experiencing their cocktails and alcohol infused desserts.

If i had to name of the freshest restaurants opened up in Calcutta in the last 6 months, Spice Kraft would definitely top my list. The decor outside didnt impress me and I expected quite a lousy and lazy ambience inside. But the moment u step inside, Voila! The place breaths class and finess and you would immediately look forward to the experience. They have an eye for detailing and I really like their idea of a pepper crusher at each table against the usual readymade powder other places provide you with! Service is courteous and swift. Coming to the food, the collection is widespread,very consistent and unique. The Chef's special section is really commendable according to taste. We ordered for the following.
1.Pork ribs hurrah kebab- quite average. Its and kebab version of the normal ribs and I did not quite like it as I am a dead fan of the fatty ribs otherwise.
2. Tempura beer can fish - my favorite of the lot. Everything is just perfect: fish that is juicy. Tempura flour that is laden with flavor, and the amazing sweet and sour dip. A must try for anyone who visits this place(repeatedly too)!
3. Dejaj Chermoula : this chicken entree was the first one to arrive and really impressive it was. It is served individually in little bowls with and incense in each to add to its exotic feel(considering its a Lebanon dish). Recommended ,highly !
4. Sangria and LIIT: The sangria really complemented the sun outside and it cooled me off in a very tipsy way. It was really good in the tongue. The LIIT was however a big disappointment : too bitter and too less.I have had better liits in the city and this one really dint click.
5 Jack Daniel's chocolate mousse and drunken petit four : an absolutely out of the world dessert that adds a big cherry to the otherwise tasty cake. I really like how the people came and explained to you the efforts put in making the dish. The mousse was so light and the balance between the alochol and the swiss chocolate was spot on. The light yellow sponge cakes and orange reduction really complemented the mousse and you can not leave the place without being happy. :)
This place is highly recommended for dates,and if you want to try out new place over kolkata and have your faith in the food culture of the city. The city needs more such places :). Great going, team Spice Kraft. :)
P.S : your pocket would be happy too :D
P.P.S : the cheque and the imli hajmis at the end of your experienes is overwhelming *_*

I had been looking for an opportunity to visit this place as I had heard nothing but good reviews about it. I went to spice kraft with my entire family of 5.
We ordered 2 draught beers, 1 kokum rita, 1 tangarita, 1 fresh lime soda and 1 doodh cola. Each of these were different from any cocktails/mocktails I have had before.
For starters we ordered the tempura beer batter fish, dajaj chermoula and kele ke phool ke croque monsieur with aamchoor and ginger creme fraiche( vegetarian).
For the main course we ordered sabz lababdar, nawabi dum ki murg, plain tandoori rotis and masala kulchas.
There was no room for dessert but I am looking forward to trying them out the next time I visit. The behaviour of the staff is very friendly and the chef himself came and spoke to us which was unexpected and very welcome. The ambience is very homely. The food served here is a different take on the old classics, and each and every dish was impeccable. The ill amounted to only Rs.2353. Very reasonable place to with either family or friends. Looking forward to my next visit.

A couple of weeks ago we visited this restaurant. Ambience is good , presentation is excellent, food is also good. For starters we ordered Drums of heaven which they suggested and told us that it is there restaurant.'s speciality. It was quite good and well decorated. For our main dish we ordered Amritsari maccchi, Nawabi dum murg and Green Peas pulao. We liked the nawab dum murg, it was quite tasty and was rich in gravy but the Amritsari maccchi was a bit spicy even though it also tasted good Lastly we ordered chocolate mouse for the desert which we had to share, but it was nice, The quantity of the food which they gave was also quite sufficient for us. I liked their Service and their suggestion towards customers, But the only point is that they take a lot of time to serve. Otherwise in overall its a good restaurant. :)

The place from outside does not impress but when you get in it has a great ambience with soft,cozy chairs,dim lights,mirrors. The food was amazingly delicious and the cocktails really stand apart.The staff is very hospitable and well behaved.The price is surprisingly decent considering the kind of food they serve.This is definitely a must try restaurant.

I can‚Äôt even begin to tell you how totally worth going this place is! Spicekraft is a #MustVisit whether you want to enjoy a huge dinner with your friends on the occasion of someone‚Äôs birthday, or a quiet fun night with your pals or significant other on the occasion of spicing up your Monday. I am entirely grateful to Spicekraft for making numerous birthday dinners here so very special for my friends and I. Without further ado, let‚Äôs get to the review:

LOCATION AND AMBIANCE: Spicekraft is located in Ballygunge, near Hazra Law College and is relatively easier to find on Google maps. The restaurant is divided into two sections and both the seating areas are quite comfortable, with dim lighting and ample amount of space between each table. The ambiance is not extraordinary, but it is definitely pleasant. 

SERVICE AND VALUE FOR MONEY: I won‚Äôt lie, I did promise the owner and the chef a detailed Zomato review, and this review would be very incomplete if I do not mention his unparalleled hospitality. On all the instances we have been to Spicekraft, we have been treated with his enormous attention, patience and courteousness. It is highly recommended that you take his advice while ordering your food and beverage. The rest of the staff is not as charismatic, but I am confident they would learn fast (and from the best!). 

As far as the price is concerned, Spicekraft is not inexpensive, but it is definitely a value for money. 

FOOD AND DRINKS: Coming to the main part, let me tell you that Spicekraft lives up to its innovative name ‚Äì even a cursory glance at the menu options would drive home the point that the restaurant strives to provide you with the most creatively crafted food and drinks. Don‚Äôt believe me yet, read on for yourself:

Starters: 

-	Drums of Heaven: From the first bite, I loved the chicken legs served with cucumber. The presentation was exquisite and the appetizer was perfect. 

-	Egg Foo-yong Canapes: From the French cuisine menu that promises an Asian touch, I liked the canapes, but they are not my favourites here. 

-	Pork Ribs Kebabas: The pork ribs with jalepeno and imli chutney drizzle, were delicious in taste. Despite being a non-pork eater, I could not resist and helped myself to a couple of ribs. I have no regrets. 

-	Beer Tempura Fish: This particular appetizer was served beautifully in a Budweiser can and looked fantastic. The fish was coated with beer batter and fried. It was quite appetizing to our taste buds. 

Main Course:

-	Poached Crab Salad ‚Äì The winter menu at Spicekraft was certainly a delight, and this salad was a major hit amongst my friends. This classic French salad of mixed greens and toasted walnuts was customised for us and served with apple cider vinegar instead of the usual lemon vinaigrette. The poached crab sticks were delightful in both taste and appearance. 

-	Penne All‚Äôarrabiata ‚Äì This one was your standard penne pasta with a perfect blend of the ingredients and the ‚Äòtangy, garlicky, cherry tomato Arrabiata‚Äô sauce.

-	Coq Au Vin ‚Äì A traditional French delicacy, the Coq Au Vin is essentially roasted chicken cooked in red wine with shallots and mushrooms and served with butter rice on the side. If you are a chicken lover, chances are that you would love this dish!

-	Shepherd‚Äôs Pie: My request to exchange potatoes with grilled veggies was taken due note of and I was accordingly provided with the alternative. The Shepherd‚Äôs Pie here one was good, but not as recommended as the rest of the main courses.    

-	Nasi Goreng: This popular Indonesian dish was made slightly bland and served with puchkas on top. Not a choice for those who prefer that extra spice, but perfectly appropriate for all you non-spicy food choosers!

-	Lobster Thermidor: An exotic preparation of lobster meat in cheese and white wine reduction, Lobster Thermidor is a classic favourite. I loved the combination of lobster, veggies and butter rice, and I cannot wait to try this out again!

-	Pork and Veggies: Spicekraft specializes in preparing some really good pork dishes, so if you are a lover of this particular meat, do try some. 

Desserts:

-	Nutella Crepe ‚Äì It goes without saying that Nutella is the key to happiness, so never give up the chance to enjoy a delightful Nutella crepe! Spicekraft provided this bundle of happiness with sweet vanilla mascarpone cream and hot Brandy sauce. 

-	100% Jack Daniel‚Äôs & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse ‚Äì The mousse, btw, was absolutely perfect! This boozert is beautifully presented and mouth wateringly tasty. 

Drinks: 

-	Hazelnut Heaven ‚Äì This sinfully delicious drink was customized according to taste and contained crunchy hazelnut brittles mixed with vanilla cream and Absolut vodka. A must try! 

-	Hammer Jack ‚Äì Served in a gigantic glass, the Hammer Jack guarantees to leave you hammered with its combination of tequila, vodka, white rum, gin and Red Bull. You would gladly skip your regular LIIT for this one!

-	Choco Beam ‚Äì This cocktail is a heady mix of Jim Bean bourbon whiskey along with chocolate syrup, orange juice and lemonade. Take note, chocoholics!

-	Coffee Cocktails ‚Äì Check out the coffee based drinks at Spicekraft! You would not regret it!

-	Milkmaid Chaitini ‚Äì Made of vodka and kadak chai, this one promises to combine the essence of both to form a heavenly drink! Best of both worlds, I must say. 

VERDICT: Spicekraft is a food lover‚Äôs paradise. I have been here for my friends' birthday dinners and we have always been specially provided with complimentary chocolate pastries/cakes to spice up the celebration. All my meals here are laced with memories of good times and an adequate amount of butter!

Nice ambience, good food. I went there to have draught beer, I was really upset when they said that they are done with it. But the Jack Hammer and the Long Island Iced Tea made my day. Good service and nice place to chill out this summer.

Really really interesting food - a lot of things in the menu, I haven't seen anywhere else. The safed daal is a must try - haven't eaten anything like it before. The multigrain naan is soft and yummy. Try the JD chocolate mousse to end the meal - again, really interesting flavours.

My second visit to this place & yes I came back for the drinks - Smoked guave + captain morgan & Roasted Pineapple + beefeater gin and dajaj charmoula. Apart from these I also ordered their devilled crabs but I am so so in love with Mocambo's preparation of the pepper devilled crabs , that i wud never order it here again. For main course , we tried Moon Faan with shredded lamb in masaman curry & it was just about OK. Next time if i visit this place , its definitely going to be for the drinks & starters üëç

I went to this restaurant with my friends on 17th April. The restaurant is situated a few steps away from the ballyguange phari petrol pump.
The ambiance and the d√©cor of this restaurant was quite impressive. This is a small restaurant with cozy seatings and good music.
There were great range of cocktails in the menu. We have taken the below cocktails for per waiters recommendation.
Hammer Jack ( beer with spirits)
Liquid Bomb( taquila with grape juice)
The Terminator ( a different form of long island ice tea)
In starters we have taken : prawn in fragrant coriander sauce and drums of heaven with flambe old mock .

All the food and drinks were really great. This is definitely a must try restaurant.

A welldecorated restaurant located near to 'Hajra law college'. Visited there on a weekday evening just to have some quick bites and to sip some beers. While we entered the restaurant was empty except one table occupied, so was little worried. They have seperate sections allocated for couples, stags and family. We ordered for a pitcher of beer, a mocktail named as 'Doodh Cola' and a chicken zarka tikka. We found that the starter was good but the mocktail not upto our expectation. So we informed the server about the mocktail but found him standing in front out us being clueless and confused. Anyway After that we ordered another two mocktails, One with kiwi and mango combibatio and another named as Blue Frappe. Those tasted good to us.

Ambience was nice. As the evening progressed the restaurant hot busy with couples and family guests gor dinner.staffs were courteous but little more knowledge on suggestive selling will surely help the restaurant to grow the business.

Had this place bookmarked for a while. Finally gv it a shot for a family dinner outing. 

Ambience.. The place is tastefully done. Lighting is pretty ambient for a romantic dinner. They could do better with their choice of music though. (3.5/5)

Service.. Am torn between rating them down while giving them a thumbs up at the same time. The owner/head chef.. Sambit personally attends to all guests n makes conversations. He, alongwith the manager Mr Nagpal (i wonder if i got the name right), take good care of the guests and take time in suggesting the dishes and explaining the contents thereof. However the other staff just does not match up to the high stds set by their bosses. Service is slow and feels incomplete at times...like spilling drinks on the table while serving and forgetting to lay the plates before laying the main dishes!! My rating 5/5 for bosses and 2/5 for the bal of them.

Drinks/Dishes/Taste... Coming to brasstracks.. the chef has taken the experiments (or rather Craft) with food to a whole new level. The names n description of the few dishes are outlandish! U wud never kno what to expect from the seemingly simple dish in front of u... and thankfully Sambit is there to help n guide u how to savour the dish. DECONSTRUCTED PAPDI CHAT, PINACOLADA 2030... never heard of such things. N as explained to us by Sambit.. these can be enjoyed even more with closed eyes... n letting the magic happen. AWESOME!!!

The starters.. Beer Fish with Tempura sauce, Lebanese chicken, Prawns... all awesome in their own right. Each of these were personally recommended by the chef.. n we didnt complaint! 

The main course... well.. nothing magical abt it... bt in anycase we were too full by the tym we reached the main course. No complaints there either!

Dessert.. well well well.... 100% Jack Daniels.... and I thot I was a teetotaller!! This one was to die for!! 

Sambit.. n the entire team... u guys have done a awesome job!! Keep it up! SpiceKraft is surely on my must visit list hereonwards...for any guests dropping by. 

My overall rating... 5/5. Look no furthur.

Visited Spice kraft with my friends last weekend. The place has two sections. Seating is comfortable. Quite crowded with people sipping on cocktails and watching IPL. We ordered 100 pipers,Vat 69, Mango driver, Classic orange with sage,Hazelnut heaven and Virgin mojito. The drinks was quite potent and reasonable. We have no complaints. For food we ordered beer can tempura fish,Yasai goyza(pan braised veg dimsums), Dejaj chermoula and subz ki galawat. The non veg starters were really good but the veg ones were just average. Service was good enough. Pricing was reasonable. Overall a nice place to hang out with friends

Located near hazra law college this is an awesome place for all the foodies. The ambience is nice the seating arrangements are good the staff is extremely friendly, one beautiful thing of this place was that the chef came out and personally went to all the tables asking about the food also explaining how it is made. But the most important thing is the food which varies from continental to Indian is absolutely delicious. A must visit

Location: Bang opposite to the Quadra Medical, very near to the Hazra law college.
Ambiance: Exquisite.
Thank you Team Spacekraft for making our night special. This place had been in my bucket list since 4-5 months and since Zomato offered me the food coupon we finally hopped in here. Thankgod we did...
Every nook and crevice is KRAFTED beautifuly and i got overwhelmed by the staff behaviour.
Coming to the food, twas lovely. Actually, I'm running out of words. The best part was there was a guy who actually explained us how they make the dish. And somehow it added more flavours to the dish.
We ordered :
1. Soy Braised Drums of Heaven, Old Monk Flambe which had the perfect blend of spices.
2. Cantonese Style Chicken Noodles. And it was perfectly done.
3. 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse, Drunken Petit Forus.
And all of the above were sinfully yummy in the tummy!
Chef Sambhit and his team are magicians..
And trust me I'm wanting to have that chocolate mousse again!
Cheers Team SpiceKraft.
Will be getting back here soon.

Great Innovative fusion food..the Chef himself suggested us dishes...loved the Lal Mas, Devilled Crab, and Pork preparations, Cocktails were reasonable...and the service was great. The alcohol offers are a steal...
The food was very innovative with exotic sauces...and varieties..and a whole lot of choices....

I wld have preferred a bit toned down interiors..the blue room seemed a bit tacky.

Spicekraft,well the name maybe not so posh but trust me behind this cover is an awesome restaurant roaring to tk Kolkata by storm. Located at the turn of ballyhunge phari with Hazra its very easily accessible.
Ambience:: Totally spot on from music to decor its all very tasteful and relaxes the senses instantly though from outside the place doesn't look so attractive.
Food: Well its a gastropub with different combinations of food n booze making a unique union to produce on of the most mouth watering food I can remember. The molecular mixology of papri chat with cavier is another experience in itself.
Service: Loved it. Very thoughtful and well behaved staff and the browny pt is when chef himself comes n talks ab the experience at the end of meal.
Price: Surprisingly decent considering the kinda food they r churning.
Just grab someone and get here n eat n drink to ur hearts content. Trust me u wont go home disappointed...

Oh my goodness, this restaurant is indeed a jewel. After reading great reviews in zomato decided to visit this place on sunday afternoon.
1. Location-- located very near to ballygunge phari opposite to hazra law college. Very easy to locate. From outside it looks blunt but from inside in reality its a heaven.
2. Ambience-- it has 2 zones, one family zone which has bright lights and one stag zone which is dimly lighted with neon lights. It is great for youngsters. Seating is very comfortable and cozy too.
3. Staff-- the staff is extremely hospitable and suggest great dishes. They are courteous too.
4. Food-- the menu is vast ranging from italian,french to tandoor dishes. We ordered beer batter fried fish and pork ribs. Both were fantastis. Good in taste like 5* star hotels. Quantity and quality both are good.
5. Drinks-- their drink menu is huge too. The cocktails are all innovative and a must try. We ordered cosmpolitan, bloody mary and lichitini. All were fantastic. They have great combo offers on cocktails -like 3 absolut vodka cocktails@ rs 450. Which is just woooww. The tequila shots were great too.
6. Verdict-- this restaurant is a jewel of calcutta. No other restaurants offer such a good innovative variety of dishes at affordable price. Cocktails they offer are far superior than what is available in so called popular pubs. If possible i would have rated this place 9/5 . Would recommend to all the users of zomato and will visit soon.

A small gastronomic heaven at the busy crossroad of Ballygunge Phari run by chef-cum-owner Sambit Banik. A place to enjoy continental cuisine with innovation and mind boggling cocktails or mocktails.
¬†The Chef personally greeted us and offered us his specialties from the menu.¬†

In cocktails we had whisky and mint based Chivas Julep, beer based Terminator and best of the lot was tequila and grape juice based Liquid Bomb. They serve at least 40 ml alcohol with their cocktails compared to other pubs. Hence kick is rest assured.¬†

In entrees had Dajaj Charmoula and Beer Can Tempura Fish. Dajaj Charmoula is a Lebanese dish of chicken wings char grilled marinated with charmoula spices. ¬†But the best was the fish dish which is beckti fingers is coated with crispy light beer batter served inside crushed beer can.

In main course had Coq Au Vin, Shepard's Pie and Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce. Coq Au Vin is classic french cuisine where chicken cooked in red wine served with parsley butter rice. Shepard's Pie is old school British cuisine. Grilled Fish is beckti fillets topped with lemon butter and served with butter rice. Presentation on table was unique for these dishes. Taste to remember of course.

The chef insisted us to try their specialty dessert 100% Jack Danial's and didn't charge us for the same. Servers were courteous and always suggestive about their menu. Price is nominal and at par of course lesser than few of its closest competitors.

The decor and ambience are great .. food is mouth watering and each item on the menu is unique and well thought and prepared ... Of course it's a non veg paradise and the staff is very well trained ... and last but not at all the least, it's not at all expensive and is totally worth the money they charge (at times I felt it is actually cheap considering the quality of food, ambience and services they provide) ... Must visit for non veg lovers ..have recommended already to my goody friends

The staffs are cordials and would suggest you according to your will. But the combo menus that they have arranged are really worthy. Be it mocktails or hard drinks it stands apart.

Though my family was very reluctant to go to a non-vegetarian dominant restaurant, they still accompanied me as I went to Spice Kraft to redeem a ‚Çπ500/- voucher I had received from Zomato. A couple of months ago I was invited to attend a cocktail making workshop and was gifted with this complimentary voucher. The owner and head chef, Mr. Sambit, conducted the informative class and had also mentioned to us to ask for them whenever we came to his restaurant for our next meal.

The next meal was on Wednesday night. We had decided on a 1. Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, 2. Sabz ki Galawat (which I liked from the workshop) and 3. Kiwi Mango Collins Mocktail 
 
We, however, were unsure about our 4th item, a Cocktail. We requested the chef to be called so he could help us with the order, like he had mentioned. He was kind, but I would have preferred if he helped us and not hijacked our night. (Mr. Sambit, I would have preferred to choose from a couple of options at least).  He ordered us 2 mocktails, 2 cocktails and 3 starters. Though I mentioned I had tried the Kele ke Phool ke Croque Monsieur, he still pressed on it because he thought the rest (my family), haven't tried the signature dish. Again, I would have preferred if we, all the members at the table, were asked for our preferences rather than being dictated on what to eat. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I don't like someone  deciding my orders. 

Kele ke Phool ke Croque Monsieur and Subz ki Galawat were similar in base.

1.     They were both fried.

2.     They were both kebabs.

3.     They both had minced/ground veggies, one had mixed veggies and the other had kele ke phool.

4.     They both had cheese.

They both tasted good but given an option, which I didn't have,  I would have ordered only either.

Stir Fried Scallions and Mushrooms was dense, full of flavour and not unnecessarily cheesy, but we waited almost an hour for it to arrive. And then, the mushrooms on toast didn‚Äôt seem worth the long wait.

Again for Main Course, the chef made us order Paneer Schezwan, as it would pair well with the Moon Fan rice that we opted for. This, inspite of my sister mentioning that she didn't want to have Paneer, He said it would be good option for vegetarians, as the options for vegetarians were limited in his restaurant. Again, I wasn‚Äôt in a mood to argue and I also felt awkward to enforce my choices in the fear of coming across as rude.

The sauce was spicy and great but the Paneer was sweet which was a let down.
I thoroughly enjoyed the Moon Faan rice.  

It took us almost 2 hours to finish our meal. The food service was slow, maybe since the restaurant was almost full. There was always a waiter available around to tend to our needs.

The food is very economical and would be great for big group outings. The drinks are also strong and unadulterated.

I am just irritated at myself for not being firm about our food preferences and instead letting the chef take over the evening. Especially for selecting the amount of alcohol we would require on the table without actually asking the amount of alcohol that we actually want to consume. My brother ended up driving under the influence of alcohol. Thankfully, not drunk.

P.S. With all due respect to your craft, sir, I would like to call my own shots at the table. I appreciate the opinion. Not dominance.

I have been speculating last night about a new global cuisine in Kolkata to check in for the dinner with my wife. Thanks to Zomato for providing the best search engine possible to check out best places around Kolkata thats serve food of its own signatuture style. By seeing the rating in Zomato and reviews about this place, we checked in to this place and ordered food as suggested by them as it was our first visit. The food tasted so different having its own distinct Irrestible flavour that we were speechless Searching for words to describe its elegance. We are again coming soon. All credit to the shef and his companions.

Nice interiors but not too spacious. We visited the restrautant when there was elections in few areas of kolkata so their cook for north indian food was not available. They couldn't serve us north indian food. Tried Chinese but it was not up to the mark. Fried rice was ok types but manchurian didn't taste well. Overall an average experience. The best part was the imli candy which they served along with the bill.

I can clearly call Spice Kraft one of the best restaurants in the city. The food is amazingly delicious,there's a wide variety of items and very well-conceptualised drinks.

We had the Dajaj Chermoula which is basically chicken legs cooked in a spice named chermoula. The quantity was quite good for the price,the chicken soft and juicy and the sweet curd-like chatni with that was a bonus.
The other item we tried was the murg reshmi malai. Malai kebabs topped with dahi. Tasted oh-so-good. These melt-in-your-mouth kebabs are highly recommended.
With these we had a mango and kiwi mocktail which was quite impressive...it had the significant kiwi flavour and it was wonderfully made.

The ambience is okay for a family restaurant. For a quiet lunch or fancy dinner.Their bar menu is so very innovative. Kudos to that.¬†

Will be going back soon to try the cocktails and the desserts.

Spice Kraft. Some kinda sorcery cooking in there, eh ? x'D
Well you are said not to judge a book by it's cover right ?
The place from outside seems bland, but the inside 'kraftwork' won't fail you.
We literally barged in when they were just opening the place! x'D They were sweeping and all.
I asked 'Is this open yet ?'
Startled by a pinch, the staff were like 'yeah yeah, sure."
Ugh. Enough of this.
The place soothes you, that's right. There are two sections ( most possibly), went to the inner zone.
Dim lights, cozy and fluffy seats, mirrors, glass paintings are sure to emanate some appeal.
Trucks will be there carrying salt and pepper shakers for you at the table. Huehue. That was a cute presentation.
Right, coming to the dishes.
Dajaj Chermoula, a juicy toothsome chicken recipe with equally palatable Lebneh dip with Tahini and roasted garlic.
Beer-can Tempura Fish, you know what I love fishes. And this is a delicacy. The dip, Orange Ponzu Tartare was a lekker, as well.
Lastly, Pork Sorpotel. My first timer with pork,
went delectably quirky, I must say.
And the drinks; of course.
Bellini and Sangria. Talk about wine indulgence.
Both were savouring. Loved the former more. Who can resist peach shorts in sparkling wine!
Do I need to say at the end I was indeed pleased by their spicy kraft ?
Yeah.
I'm gonna barge in here again, in no time! xD

When we called Spice Kraft for a reservation, we were bluntly told that they were fully booked for the entire evening from 7pm onwards! We took a chance anyway and landed at their door at 8pm to find just a couple of tables occupied. Thanking our luck, we sat down for an interesting experience. For whatever reason, I had pictured a plush, fancy outfit. It looked quite the opposite but of course, that has no bearing on the food.

There was a special menu and an abridged version of the regular menu for Naboborsho. The menu is made very interesting here because of the molecular twist. The bar menu is extensive and after scrutinizing it closely, I settled for the aam panna and curry patta shikanji. It turned out to be everything I'd have liked it to be. Spiced and subtly effective. 

Moving on to exciting food! Despite my best efforts, I can't seem to remember the name of the fantastic stuffed gourd flower entree!! Stuffed with mozzarella and served with a lightly tangy chutney, it was delicate and lipsmacking good. I couldn't resist the lure of the signature mochar chop. Well, it was the answer to my fanciful expectations of the restaurant. This was the 5/5 dish for me. Molten cheese, a sliver of pineapple and the traditional chop all brought together to make the stuff of dreams. Great dish. Our molecular experiment was with the papri chaat shots and they were truly an intense and very accurate flavor blast in our mouths. Exciting!

Main course was veg au gratin and shepherd's pie. The former was not bad by any stretch. It just did not meet the sky high expectations set by the opening act. The latter served with mash was quite awesome, I was told. 

Good food, good evening. Will happily return to this rare restaurant that quite lived up to the hype.

Hi Chef Sambit,
My apologies for the late review.I have been to your restaurant this Jan and was bowled over by the new refreshing menu.We were completely spoilt for choices and ended up ordering quite a few and enjoyed them all.The staff were extremely courteous and your suggestions were definitely helpful.My husband and I are complete foodies,and he being an ex-chef from Taj enjoys cooking a lot. I have made it a point to visit Spice Kraft with him on our next visit to India.I would like to request you to kindly share the recipe for blueberry and churan coulis as its the most intriguing dip i have tasted so far.Thank you and good luck to the Spice Kraft team.Hope to visit soon.

Visited this place for the first time yesterday. The restaurant is a bit cramped. The ambience is not that great. But the food served were marvellous. We ordered some of the items from special dishes. Almost all were superb. Special mention needs to go to Pork bada kebab which was simply delicious. The food items from special dishes were innovative. Overall a nice experience apart from the ambience.

Spice Kraft had been in my bucket list for a long time. After reading all the illustrious reviews, i visited it one Saturday for lunch with a couple of friends. 

A very special thank you to the owner and chef Sambit for his palatable creations and gracious behaviour. Starting from cocktails to dessert his suggestions were very appropriate for our taste buds and it took our experience from great to awesome. I'm giving a 0.5 extra in my rating just for him.

Location: Located near Hazra Law College, right opposite Quadra, this place is easy to find.

Ambiance : Its a small restaurant but the interiors are very tastefully done. They have taken care of even the minutest detail, like having a small decorated truck with salt and pepper shakers on every table. The interiors are beautifully done with ornamented overhead lights, pretty chairs and decorated glasses. There was only one tiny problem, there were a few flies continuously hovering around our food and the staff members were killing some of them with a the insect killing bat. This was a kind of mood killer.

Staff and Management : The staff were attentive, quick and courteous. 

Food, Cocktails, Mocktails: 
* Cucumber Cooler Mocktail : i had just entered the place after walking a while in the scorching summer heat and this drink was totally what i needed. It was deliciously refreshing with tiny chunks of cucumber. I must try, provided you like cucumber flavour.
* Jamun Mary Smirnoff Cocktail : This was completely and totally delectable. It had a slightly tangy-salty flavour. Best part was that while many restaurants give very less quantity of alcohol in their cocktails, this placed surprised me with their high alcohol quantity with low prices. Another must try.
*Liquid Bomb Cocktail : Kudos to Sambit for his presentation of this cocktail. It came in a glass shaped like a light bulb and looked very alluring. This was made of pure tequila & grape juice. And again it had a lot of alcohol and came at a low price.
*Dajaj Charmula : This was a kind of kabab each of which came in a beautiful looking small wooden glass. Another beautiful presentation. Tasted decent, not great. The dip was a sweet curd which blended well with the kabab. 
*Beer Can Tempura Fish : This was another dish that really held my attention in terms of its presentation. It tasted palatable, really crunchy and juicy at the same time. But i found that there was too much batter compared to the quantity of fish and the dip was too sweet.
* Deconstructed papdi chat : I didn't really like this and not certain why this is hyped so much.
*Cou-Au-Vin : This was butter rice with roasted chicken in red wine. While my friends found it a tad sweet i loves this dish. All the flavours complemented each other very well. A must try.
*Baked Fish Wellington: Bhetki in cheese sauce and mushroom. This was the best dish of the afternoon. The quality of bhetki was great. They served us two huge chunks of deliciously cooked bhetki. Both the quantity and the taste amazed me. 

Desserts : The desserts need a special mention and hence I'm penning down a separate paragraph for the them alone. The desserts were the best part of my afternoon. If given a chance i would have tried all of Sambit's dessert creations. The ones i tried were totally out of the world and left me with a overfull stomach and an unfulfilled desire to eat more. 
* 100% JackDaniels Mousse : The deliciously rich mousse and the orange compote with Jack Daniels created such a palatable combination that you will be left wanting more and more. Its sweet, its bitter, its heavenly.
* Fondante : Cointrue, orange and white chocolate parfite, dark fudge torte (alcoholic) . This was so delectable that it transported me to another world. The combination of white chocolate and alcohol oozing out out of the dark fudge torte looked enticing and once you take a scoop and put it into your mouth the bitterness and sweetness blended so well that you will surely be left asking for more.

I found that the prices are very reasonable compared to quantity and quality of food and beverage. 

Wish team Spice Kraft all the best for the future !

Situated close to Hazra Law College, visited this new 'must try' place with my school friends a few days back. Needless to say, we went with high expectations and weren't disappointed at all. The cocktail offer (you get 3 for Rs450) made us order multiple rounds of drinks. The food was up to the mark as well. I personally loved the drums of heaven and the penne pasta and of course the beer fish. Must visit guys!

Located in Ballygunge Phari, this place has good interior.In drinks, we tried their Kokum Rita, Chivas Julep, the Hammer Jack, 5 steps to heaven. Each one had a unique taste and was quite innovative.
Now coming to food, we tried beer can tempura fish, devilled crab meat, pork ribs burrah kebab, hoisin braised chicken popcorn. Loved the crab and the rest were tasty as well.
Service was good. Price was pretty decent.
This place is so worth visiting.

The reviews for Spice Kraft were so good that we just couldn't give it a miss. Easiest way to locate it is to turn left at the Ballygunge phari crossing and going straight. 
Dropped in with a few friends to hang out. The ambience is very pleasant and given the hot weather, is a welcome change, with it's dim lights and soft music. Now, coming to the important topic.
The food. 
We ordered the Beer can Tempura fish, Dajaj Chermoula and Shepherd's pie. The excellent presentation of the dishes raised our expectations of the quality of food. And we were not disappointed. Light and crispy fish served (literally!) In a beer can is a must-have. Dajaj chermoula is char-grilled chicken which was yummy. But the show stealer was the Shepherd's pie. A foodies' delight it was. Puffy outer layer followed by a smooth mince of lamb and veggies, it was just foodgasmic! Highly recommended. Coming to drinks we ordered Draught beer, Long Island Iced Tea, Margarita, Tangarita. Although I'm not much of a drinker, yet i enjoyed the drinks (in small sips of course!). Overall, a bunch of points for the cordiality of the waiters who were ready to suggest drinks and dishes. A very nice experience. Would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place. Ting! :-)

A very good experience which is very rare in the city now.The menu is varied and the staff are well aware of  what is being served. Thr quality and quantity of portions are quite good and leaves no room for complaint.

For the people who love their drink, their cocktails are a must. They are very different from the other restaurants. The dessert portions are large and are a delight. 

I am definitely going back and this is one place I will recommend to all.

On a Wednesday evening we went in at a about 7.30 pm and were seated promptly.Within half an hour though it was full house with people waiting for a table,very creditable indicator of popularity for a restaurant just four months in existence.

With the sudden profusion of eating places in South Kolkata,it has its share of restaurants owned by chefs like one nearby specializing in "Bengali Fusion"which has been a resounding success unlike the one by the host of a highly popular Bengali TV cooking show which fails to live up to the hype.

From the very elaborate menu, which also describes Chef Sambit's journey through his training in Europe and professional experience,we ordered drinks,a Chivas Julep Margarita for me and Sangria for my companion,both excellent and refreshing on a very hot summer evening.

For the mains the order was Coq au Vin with Buttered Rice and Shepherds Pie. The chicken was very well cooked and would find ready acceptance with Indian palates while the minced mutton in the pie was again very moist and flavorful,satisfactory and filling plated dishes.Service was slower than one expected and could try someone's patience.

Now comes the part but for which I would have given a five star rating. There was no attention from the wait staff during the meal and after it took more than twenty minutes for plates to be cleared.Chef Sambit came by as he does to interact with his guests and was very receptive to some of the more critical feedback and suggested a Chocolate Fondant for dessert which we shared. It was truly delicious served with vanilla ice cream, perhaps the molten chocolate could have been of a slighter thicker consistency.

He was very excited on being told that I would be back for lunch the next day, to give a young niece, whose office was around the corner,a long promised treat and promised us an excellent Asian meal of his choice,though he normally does not come in on a weekday at lunchtime. Total bill for dinner including the drinks, Rs.2300.

We were the only guests apart from another couple,the next day and Chef Sambit offered us cocktails, mine based on Absolut vodka and the other non alcoholic,excellent. The lunch was served reasonably quickly,Moon Faan Rice,Stir Fried Vegetables with Bok Choy in a white sauce and Roast Pork in Rendang Curry. The rice was delectable and very subtly flavored, the Vegetables were cooked to perfection and the Roast Pork curry outstanding with a thick delicious gravy all matched to our utter satisfaction. When Chef Sambit enthusiastically suggested Darsaan for dessert ,I groaned inwardly as I detest the muruku like hard stuff coated with a sweet sticky sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds one encounters usually in Desi Chinese restaurants. I was quite blown away by the Orange Glazed and Honey tossed, soft in consistency Darsaan with ice cream, the orange flavor just a hint on the palate. Creative excellence. The bill excluding drinks Rs.902.

Chef Sambit comes across as sincere and passionate about his craft-"entertaining the palate"-as he puts it and seems to strive for excellence to exceed the expectations of his guests.

Best of luck to him.

I had been waiting to go to this place for such a long time and today I finally went. It was a nice quirky place. What stood out to me was that this place knew food and was ready to share the stories behind each dish.
Coming to the food, we had kele ka phool and a Vietnamese starter called Khaoi Tay. Both the preparations were different and good. For main we had Pak Choi and vegetables in white garlic sauce which was a decent preparation along with Nasi Goreng which they had specially made vegetarian for us. Unfortunately it was too spicy for our pallette, so they had replaced it and given us a less spicy version of it. Thumbs up to them for this. We ended with Monte Carlo which was just a general Monte Carlo. It was well priced especially compared to the higher prices that are charged for comparatively mediocre food at most eateries now a days.
Overall a very nice experience. Will definitely pay it a second visit.

The ambience is simple but nice. The staff are very efficient and apt. The price is also quite affordable. The chicken popcorns dish was quite awesome. The grilled fish in lemon butter sauce was too yummy. The shepherd's pie was also upto the mark. The beer can tempera fish is just too good. The Rainbow (mocktail) is also very refreshing. The kiwis and mango collins is also good. The chief is also interactive and helpful in keeping the foods standard high.

It is a real attraction for foodies in this region. 
They have quite nicely and thoughtfully setup the place. The lighting, small decorative and the music all adding up to a good ambience. 
The service was impeccable. The menu is nicely put and shows diversity. 
The food was nice. The Hong Shao Rou, even though it was a fantastic recipe, lacked a bit of the tenderness, but the preparation and presentation was nice. The main course, however did make up for that appetizer. The fried rice as well as the chicken in oyster sauce with mushroom was up to the mark. Tried the recommended Utterly Butterly Jameson which did not fail to amuse us, and the Manhattan is just how you would expect it to be. Missed the dessert round, would definitely try them the next time.

After so many visits to this joint, and I still keep wanting more. Every item this restaurant dishes out, is nothing short of food porn! Why do I say so? Well, every time I take the first bite of any dish, my eyes close, I gently moan and I lick my lips. The chef never ceases to amaze, with every dish done to perfection and presented beautifully. Hats-off for gifting Calcutta such an awesome restaurant and my best wishes to you that Spice Kraft maintains its position as the top continental eatery in the city, for years to come.

Location: Opposite Quadra Medical Hospital.

With the modern era setting in and the new generation mindsets blooming, food is no longer only about food. It has slowly become an integral part of the whole 'Eating out' scene which itself has become a quotient of the wholesome experience one takes home.
If you as a restaurant miss out on any one ingredient, you are automatically relegated to an also-ran position. It is very rare that a restaurant scores a check in every aspect and stands out as a distinct contender.

Spice Kraft, the brainchild of Chef Sambit Banik, is one of the latest inclusions in the time-line of the food industry serving multiple cuisines and trust me, this place is here to stay. The place is found to possess a progressive outlook towards the experience which in its intricate form is taken care of - rather than just the food or service which every restaurant dominantly works upon.

A visit to this place had been long awaited and finally managed to visit it thrice in a row (in a week to be precise)!
The hat-trick was all because of the wonderful experiences I took back each time I visited. The place itself has a very positive vibe to it and standing right in front of the property one might simply miss the surprises that await inside. Yes, the entrance and the exteriors aren't as attractive as one would expect by the name; and have been kept really simple with just a translucent glass pane running from the ceiling to the floor.

"Never judge a book by its cover" - a saying which in the best senses, holds true for this place.

The AMBIANCE, upon entrance, is something one wouldn't want to miss. The all-glass walls running throughout the main seating area paired along with laser-cut frames, modern day back-lit light hangings and a gorgeous cabinet showcasing the premium liquors could simply kick-start one's unwinding process. Not to forget the calm instrumentals playing in the background which also play an important role by aiding the unwinding process.
Divided across three sections - the second is a blue-toned dimly lit area which one might opt for a private party or if he prefers a shady kind of environment. The first look of it gave a youngster-type feel and mostly seemed to be preferred by a similar aged people.
Lastly, the third section is a brightly-lit area with a different warmth surrounding it which deems it fit for a family get together or a little private meal with your select few! The beautiful lantern-style hangings, the modern day spots and the eye-catching art as the backdrop took the aura of the place a notch up.
The seating capacity of the property is approximately eighty with thirty being in the main area, twenty in the dimly-lit area and twenty in the third.

Spread across the Continental, Asian and Indian cuisines, Spice Kraft has created its niche across all the dishes they have on offer. From the Regional Classics to the Fusion food, every single dish spells of the innumerable researches and meticulous toil that has gone into perfecting them. Having visited thrice, dishes across the cuisines as well as the road less traveled have been tasted and must say, they have left me wanting for more.

One might wonder, apart from their multi-cuisine range, what could the road less traveled be?
It is the Molecular Gastronomic fare whose inclusion in their exclusive range is just another feather added to the property's glory.
For people who are unknown of this modern style of cooking, Molecular Gastronomy is a style of cuisine in which chefs explore culinary possibilities by borrowing tools from the science lab and ingredients from the food industry.
In other words, it is a deep science of understanding how the ingredients of a dish interact with each other and undergo transformation in cooking. Various innovative techniques like Spherification, Aeration, Gelification are used to get a burst of flavors. And, having perfected this innovative art of "Molecular Gastronomy" people tom tom about, Spice Kraft is one place which has proved itself to be standing out of the crowd.

A special shout-out about the Fusion Food or The Confusion, as the Chef states it, is a result of his multitudinous experiments in order to strike the right balance of flavors. Any dish from the "Chef Signatures" is a treat to the taste buds. Though this doesn't mean the rest are any less!
Any random pick from the Classics would be found to posses the power to leave you equally impressed.

A completely authentic fare is something that's hard to digest for people who have a palate fit for modified food and, sadly this place would be a prick through their taste buds. But, the adherence to the authentic preparations of the dishes at Spice Kraft only leaves me with a respectful impression.
The following have been SAMPLED from the entire range:

- Cucumber Cooler (Mocktail)
An absolutely refreshing punch of cucumber juice with a mix of chaat masala served in a martini glass topped with chopped cucumber. Did taste nice and would surely help beat the heat.

- Kiwi & Mango Collins (Mocktail)
A blossom-type drink which was a mix of Cranberry, mango and kiwi juice topped with Hazelnut-flavored cream was served in a tall glass. Delicious it was to taste!
Recommended by the Chef and loved by me.

- Tangy Mandarin & Lemongrass Shock (Molecular Mixology)
A mojito is a traditional Cuban highball comprising of sparkling water, white rum, sugar, lime juice and crushed mint leaves as its primary ingredients. But, here the Mojito has been given a nice twist resuting in three variants out of which this was tried.
The liquor base was the same (white rum) as the original but, the twist to it was the swap of mint leaves by the subtle flavors of Lemongrass, a citric edge by the mandarin oranges and the use of the aeration technique with the aid of a whipping siphon to carbonate the drink.
From the on-table theatre of aerification to the drink, everything was loved. A nice change to the usual mojito.

- Liquid Bomb
A bomb by name as well as by taste. This Chef recommendation was a wonderful mix of grape juice, silver tequila (also known as white or blanco) and cointreau (orange flavored liquor) gave the cocktail a wonderful kick. A single sip blew me over. Was a chef recommendation and it did live up to its expectation. Served in a bulb-shaped funky glass, this drink struck the right chords.
Highly recommended.

- Kele-ke-Phool ke Croque Monsieur (Chef Signatures)
A Croque monsieur is usually a baked or fried sandwich, traditionally made with Brioche-like bread pieces with a soft crust and topped with cheese. But, here the fusion was to find six bite-size Banana Blossom Croquettes done in the Croque Monsieur style with a Pineapple slice and a generous amount of cheese on top. Was baked to perfection and served with a Cr√®me Fra√Æche (sour cream dip) which was perked up with mango powder & thinly sliced ginger for flavoring.
An absolute hit it was and was a part of the order throughout the visits.
Recommended.

- Deconstructed Papdi Chat (Molecular Gastronomy)
Using the innovative technique of Spherification, this dish had its own charm with spoon-sized Dahi ke Chaat served with savory Caviars (made of fried chickpea flour) on the side. Top the flavored spoonfuls with caviars and spoon it in to enjoy the different embedded flavors. Though, the dish had no Papris, still a spoonful of Papri Chaat it was! The flavors did the talking.
Although a dish is a serving for two, the deliciousness and perfected technique makes up for it.
Highly Recommended.

- Pasta Alfredo
A creamy & luscious Alfredo Sauce, a sauce made of butter, cream and parmesan cheese, is a culinary dream and this place has amazingly perfected it. The thick creamy texture and the cheese-rich aroma was enough to impress. A bite of the perfectly boiled pasta (penne) tossed along with beans, carrots, black olives and balanced seasoning was enough for the verdict. Absolutely delicious it was!
Highly Recommended.

- Khoai T√¢y
Khoai T√¢y, in Vietnamese, means potatoes which in this dish have been perked up with herbs and tossed along with assorted bell peppers, kaffir limes & onion in Sriracha Chilli Sauce, a Thai-style hot sauce made from sun-ripened red chillies having a subtle garlic accent.
Dominantly a Vietnamese dish, it was supposed to have a spare use of hot chillies and oh-boy, so was it. An authentically prepared dish which left a nice spicy aftertaste.

- Crispy Chilli Babycorn
Well marinated & batter-fried pieces of babycorn tossed in traditional Chinese sauce. The baby corn was crisp and the dish as a whole reflected a balance of taste, texture, aroma and colour. All the basic flavors ‚Äì be it sweet, sour, pungent, hot, salty or spicy were deftly incorporated in the dish.
Loved every single bite of it.
Highly Recommended.

- Chilli Garlic Noodles (Veg)
Chilli oil is a spicy oriental condiment prepared by infusing oil with red chillies. It has a really pungent aroma and fiery taste. Using it in this dish imparted a fiery edge to the noodles. The noodles were perfectly boiled and wok-tossed along with shallots, springs, chilli oil and saut√©ed garlic. A prelude of burnt garlic with a walk of balanced flavors and a postlude of spiciness was nothing short of instant love.
Highly Recommended.

- Vegetable Dumplings in Manchurian Sauce (8 dumplings)
The Indo-Chinese fusion is one craze that exists to date where Indians have enjoyed an encore of dishes. And, among such recipes, the Vegetable Manchurian is one such gem. A popular combination of deep-fried mixed vegetable balls deep-fried and tangy gravy is what has set this dish apart and helped create a niche on the Indian palate.The dish here had eight bite-size dumplings tossed in a gravy which had an exceptionally authentic balance of flavors.

- Doodhiyan Kebab [Six Pieces]
An SK interpretation of Chef Qureshi's traditional gem. A kebab made of cottage cheese stuffed in mashed potatoes and finished on a griddle. The textured kebabs tasted really nice and soft.
Was served along with mint coriander chutney and onion juliennes which complimented well.
Love cottage cheese? Try this out.

- Nawabi Dum Ki Paneer
Cottage Cheese cubes tossed in a fragrant curry brightened with black pepper, thickened with cashew nuts and flavored with aromatic spices. The creamy texture and the melt-in-the-mouth cottage cheese were a treat.

- Dal Makhani
A popular dish from the Punjabi Cuisine which has whole black lentils, red kidney beans, butter and cream as its primary ingredients, thereafter simmered for hours & perked with spices for a rich texture. The dish served here did not miss on any of the key points and tasted absolutely delicious. The dal had a beautiful creamy texture and was served with a generous drizzle of butter on top.
Recommended.

- Butter Naan
One of the most unique thing about cooking in the tandoor is the smoky flavor it imparts to the food. Butter Naan is a flatbread baked in a tandoor (mostly a cylindrical clay or metal oven) and served with a brush of melted butter. The Naan was nicely baked and good to taste.

- Masala Kulcha
A North Indian flat bread stuffed with mashed potatoes mixed with spices and onion, oven baked and served with a generous brush of butter on top. Tasted good.

- Tandoori Roti
Yet another tandoor-baked item, this one is a plain roti usually made of whole wheat flour or a flour which is a proportionate mix of all-purpose & whole wheat. The roti was baked to perfection and as per personal preferences. Tasted good.

- Classic Mont√® Carlo
A classic dessert which slowly has left an everlasting impression on the taste buds of the people of Kolkata is available here in its own form. Crumbled brownies topped with dollops of vanilla ice-cream and a generous drizzle of chocolate sauce. Presented with a mint sprig on the top and choco wafers on the side, the dessert was an equal treat to the eyes.
Though on a personal note, I did miss the hazelnut-flavored whipped cream.
But, the dessert was chocolaty and exceptionally mouth-watering.

The SERVICE is something which keeps a restaurant moving at a pace which directly impacts a customer's experience and leaves an indirect impact on the goodwill of the brand. A service possesses the capability of making or breaking a brand. The STAFF CONDUCT is something that's the icing on the cake without which the service alone cannot leave a mark, positive or negative being a secondary matter. With regard to the experiences I came out with, its easy to sum up their stand on the service board. Though the polite & well-informed staff were found to have a fair knowledge about the menu and serve with a smile, the service was found to be a tad slower. But, the quality of the food dished out were worth the wait. The taste and satisfaction are bound to make up for the slightly slower service.

You do not visit a restaurant with an intend to meet the Management but, this place proved itself to be an exception post the first meet and left me with an insatiable urge to meet the Owner & Chef, Mr. Sambit who had been an extremely warm host looking after the little things throughout all visits. A soft spoken, down to earth person who along with being a connoisseur of his craft has a pragmatic approach towards his venture. It is extremely difficult to handle a venture with such soundness but, an erudite person like him, who carries along a vibe so positive that a conversation with him is bound to leave you enlightened about food and an impact so respectful & strong that you cannot help but, feel the aura around which spells of the projected peaks of success.

Talking about the PRICES, a restaurant located at a prime location with such quality is hard to find at a reasonable price bar. But, this place does manage to keep the pocket pinch at bay and the prices incline towards the moderate end.

An amazing set of experiences it has been!
- Would love to keep re-visiting the place.
- A heartfelt thanks to the Chef for the wonderfully hand-crafted memories.
- Maintaining the same quality throughout isn't a child's play. Hope to see Spice Kraft sail a long way in a consistent manner!

Small cozy family joint,  the feeling of being in a house converted to restaurant is very strong. Bit that should not take away the credit of some excellent innovative dishes. The style in which the dishes are served is different for the regular mundane method. I was pertecularly disappointed with delayed service but the excellent food made up for it. I recommend it's a must visit place.

Had a very bad experience, probably amongst the worse. The descriptions given by the chef were too exotic and so are the prices. But the food and drinks were not even close to the expectations. He was very deceiving in how he spoke about the stuff but that's about it. We left after having two starters and some drinks. We had to pay and just finish what was served but all of that money was a complete waste.

The place is an absolute rip off. The food or drinks are just not worth the money. Nor is the ambience. The chef recommended drinks and dishes to us which were below average, ordinary would be an understatement. Would not recommend this place to anyone.

An evening with a friend. Some gossip and liqour with finger foods. Yes..... tailor-made for this. Located opposite to the famous Quadra Diagnostics at Hazra Road near Ballygunge Phari, this small shop is catching eyes of everyone. The interior is interestingly decorated in 3 divisions with different taste. DAJAJ CHERMOULA..... if only one dish is to be tried, this should be it. Lebanese cuisine made of chicken legs is the definite show-stopper. But, though few experts recommended the Beer Can Tempura Fish, I personally found this Bekti dish pretty average.... like flattened fish finger. The Soy Braised Drums of Heaven is to much spicy, nothing extra-ordinary. But they compensated it with very good cocktails. The age old famous Long Island Iced Tea, Vodka Martini and Tequilla were mood-makers. The best part was LIIT for 225 bucks only!! Amazing! Hospitality is great. Although a bit crampy as far as seating is concerned, definitely worth a visit for all my fellow food lovers.

Went there last Saturday to have lunch with my office colleagues. The food was very good, the ambience was nice. You get into a romantic and romantic mood when enter this place. Loved the place and would like to come back later.  Would have given 5 star but the service is a tad bit slow.

LOCATION:Situated near the Hazra Law College right opposite relax inn guest house.

OVERVIEW:
¬†This restaurant has caught the fancy of foodies across Kolkata like a Tsunami. It belongs to chef Sambit Banik (I hope I have got his name right) who is a through gentleman. Me and my wife dropped in for dinner a few weeks back. It was late around 10:15. The place is reasonably well done up with some neat little touches like the condiments on the table being served on a play truck which adds a hint of newness to the outlet. It was nice to see Chef and Owner Sambit go from table to table and ask the diners how they were liking the food as well as suggest what to eat to new comers like us.

WINE & DINE:
We had a couple of cocktails for starters which were well done. We liked them both. They were well presented and mixed perfectly. The Mediterranean Chicken Drumsticks were good but the curd dip served along with could have been better. The Cheese Parcels with a jam based dip was very good with the right balance of citrus and sweet in the dip. It was a perfect accompaniment. For mains, my wife went for the white sauce pasta and I went for the chicken Co Que Vine. The chicken was smashing. Flavorful, buttery and complimented perfectly with the buttered rice. I could go back for this one!. The white sauce pasta was also good. Pasta was boiled perfectly and the white sauce was not heavy but rich at the same time.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

Service at the table could have been better. I think for upscale restaurants, customers should not have to ask for a refill of water once they have completed their first glass. The napkins on the table need to be washed properly. While they were clean, they had a strange smell about them.¬†

OVERALL:

A different place in the city serving unique food. It will be hard to get disappointed by the food here more so because they have taken care to present their food well. Service is personalized which is a plus. Highly Recommended !

Visited this place after going through Zomato reviews and being referred by a friend. MIND. BLOWN! 
Chef Sambit has added a the right touch of cosmopolitanism to the city of joy - he is a wizard with the food and drink!
Cocktails - a rare and successful glimpse of world class molecular mixology. We tried the chaitini and the smoked guava captain Morgan mix. Delightful to say the least!
Kebabs and food - foodgasm!! We tried the chefs special kibbeh, kothmiri kebab, doodhiya kebab, Vietnamese potatoes and the Lebanese chicken (served in kullhads!). Each better than the other.
The ambience is soothing to the eye - class and sophistication. 
I will definitely be back. Friends or family - this place deserves visits with anyone and everyone!

This is one of the best places I have visited in Kolkata. We went there on a weekend and luckily got a table. The interior is really nice and what caught my eyes was the cute little truck carrying salt n pepper. The drinks we ordered were kool cucumber, the cranapple driver, blue electric and the hammer jack. I had the cranapple driver and it is exactly my kind of cocktail. The food we ordered included Bacardi lemon infused tandoori chicken sausages, beer can tempura fish, shepherd's pie and squid rings in butter garlic. The one which stands out among all of these is the tempura fish. Such amazing crispness outside and tender fish inside! Next is the shepherd's pie... Its my comfort food! It had such a humble feel to it. The sausages were also good but the squid dish was a little sweet which I disliked. The chef did pay us a visit and asked us about the food. I just have one complaint and that is the service gets slower when its busy. By the end we were waiting for 20mins to get the drinks. Anyway overall experience was really good and I would definitely visit again to try the other dishes!

After completion of my second visit I plan to write this review..
I love the ambiance..and the decor..It is quite classy..

I love the food and the assortment of taste in the seemingly known food...
The imbibing of molecular gastronomy guess makes all the difference..
I love the starters..each one I have tried is unique and amazing to taste..just did not like the taste of a accompanying dip ..here and there

They have a great arena of mocktails and cocktails..
The main dishes are good in its own way..¬†
The management is really nice and friendly and taking personal feedback is really a nice gesture...
The only thing why I coudnot rate it 5 is because of the delay in service..I hope the serve time is a little better...Overall I love this place and will definitely be back for more..!

Ordered online( so cant really comment on the decor,service etc) for a baked fish wellington....the fish was succulent with a lot of cheese and mushroom,just the way i like to dig up a continental dish...but the pilaf served with was nothing special and the quantity was meagre...I dont know is it the standard portion coz i have digged up a lot of continental joints and never found such thing.so this can be taken as a suggestion.

Good ambience with soft music.. Authentic & innovative cocktails.. On food menu, Dajaj Charmoula & Beer can tampura fish are never to miss. Offers like 3 large shots for 600/-, 3 large premium whisky for 700/- and also absence of service charge make the price reasonable. Service is prompt and helpful. Overall, a cool place to hangout..

Was on my bookmarked list for a few days now and finally landed there yesterday. To start with the ambiance is beautiful from the colours the decor and the lovely playlist. after going through the beautiful looking menu card and the variety they offer, I started with a carlsberg as no other beers were available as they informed that they are facing problems with supply of beers. And then we ordered Rarha Ghost and Zaffrani Sheermal (Roti). The serving time was around 15 mins. The gosth was just mind blowing as the mutton was properly cooked and was soft and even the greavy which was a chicken keema gravy was also too good. A delicious preperation indeed. The roti was on the sweeter side and we loved it as it was fade from milk and zafran. The fooding experience was at its best. Staffs were good. Have to visit this place a few more times to go through all the different delicacy they serve. Over all a great experience !!! Thank You.

Had mostly Indian dishes. The starters were great. Chicken juicy and fish flaky and perfectly cooked with portions appropriate. Though the service is a little slow, be it mains or dessert. 
The restaurant itself is pretty small, thus too loud for my preference. Decor confusing with a hint of modern and traditional elements. 
All over not bad for a quick bite. With reasonable prices for people from all walks of life.

Oh! This is such a lovely outlet near the Ballygunge Petrol Pump, and it has been such a mistake not to visit it earlier, inspite of being more or a less a regular on that road.

Now, my feedback won't be fair and complete, since I visited the restaurant around 5 in the afternoon (the people were kind enough to welcome me at that hour) and Tandoori was not available at that time. I previously had a little titbit here and there, but I just went in to get a feel of the place. So, I just ordered:
1. Blue Electric mocktail
2. Beer Can Tempura Fish and
3. 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Chocolate Mouss√®.

Am not much of an alcoholic person, so reviewing a mocktail won't do a justice to it. To put it simply, I enjoyed the drink (since it was one of my firsts!)

The Beer Can Tempura Fish was excellent, and so was the decoration with which it came. It was perfectly fried and tasted utterly butterly delicious with the dip that came along with it.

The Mouss√® was a little different here, because it came along with four small cakes, and had a little alcohol. It's a speciality here, going by the Zomato reviews, but it didn't suit my taste buds much.

Edit: 2nd visit (all too soon)
I mainly went back to this place for the relatively cheap and wonderful cocktails. This time round, I ordered
1. Dajaj Shermoula
2. Zaffrani Sheermal and
3. Rarha Ghost apart from
4. Classic Cosmopolitan and
5. Margarita.

The Classic Cosmopolitan tastes more like a mocktail than a cocktail. But it's refreshing and has a sweet and sour taste to it. The Chermoula is a speciality of this place and it's taste speaks for itself. The dip that comes with it is equally good and together, they make magic! The Zaffrani Sheermal is a sweet roti and tastes good with the Rarha Ghost, though the latter is not anything extraordinary. I have had better Mughlai dishes elsewhere. However, the Margarita was going strong on me by then, and this may not a completely unbiased review.

Again, the pocket pinch is reasonable, and judging by the frequency of my visits, this place is soon going to become my hangout zone it seems!

I was there on a Friday night for dinner with friends. The place looks good and has a good feel to it when you go there. Doing what it should, it got me excited for the food that would follow. The menu boasts the owner's accolades and his hard work. Feeling a little acquainted to the man behind the show, it gave me a more homely feel. However, the shit show started right after. The service is tremendously slow!! I mean tremendously SLOW! The guy has an MBA. Put it to good use man! Manage your restaurant! We ordered two starters, and two main course dishes. The starters took a good 20 minutes to arrive, already a downer. I requested for some salt, thrice. Never got it till I left my table at the end. The main course toon more than 50 minutes. Which is when we decided to just cancel the order and head out. It was a waste of a night and needless to say I'm never setting foot in that place again, and would urge others to tread lightly. Chef Sambit, get your MBA and Paris degree to do the trick for you. I wish you luck! Sorry you lost a customer.

2016 Women's Day evening will be remembered fondly - thanks¬†to Zomato, Spice Kraft and my bevy of beautiful co-foodies from the city! If Zomato did a fabulous event management job, the ladies made for awesome company! 

But o fcourse the evening belonged to Chef Sambit Banick who deftly demonstrated how food and drink can be a melting pot of flavors, texture and culture! One cannot but marvel at the perfect harmony created with the varied alcoholic potions, spices, juices and a dash of personal magic! 

He created 4 marvelous cocktails for us - 

Mulled Wine - a warm drink with red-wine as the base and strong notes of honey, cinnamon and orange zest. It kick started the evening with a sweet, mellow fire! 

Cosmopolitan - the oh-so-perfect cosmopolitan with a dash of fresh lime juice, Cointreau, and Cranberry juice. You cannot possibly go wrong with that!

Apple Wood Smoked Guava Mary - A twist 'wala' bloody mary with tomato juice replaced with guava juice - the apple wood smoke looked pretty 'fancy' but the flavor got lost in the concoction, so a pretty ho-hum formula this one.

Utterly Butterly Jameson - a desset cocktail, chef told us. A strong concoction of peanut butter, Jameson Irish Whiskey, Amul Cream and Hershey‚Äôs Chocolate Syrup - sweet notes but not for the faint-hearted! 

In the food section, we were in for some very interesting surprises. The magic of the east fused with the finesse of the west - this was perhaps the most adventurous culinary journey that I had embarked upon. 

Khaoai Tay - delectable Vietnamese fragrant herb tossed potatoes in sriracha chilly - the top notes are tangy with a strong basil flavor, the chilly is not as hot as you would imagine!¬† 

Dajaj Chermoula - The tunisian magic comes alive in this Chicken with spicy chermoula marinade - the beautiful smoky char grilled flavor hits you as you chew upon the soft, juicy chicken pieces (awesomely presented in cocktail glasses with a lebanese dip with tahini and burnt garlic)

Kele ke Phool ke Croque Monsieur with Amchoor and Ginger Creme Fraiche - Innovative effort this one, though taste wise okayish - the banana flower and cheese combinations is not outstanding but the brilliantly flavored Creme Faiche makes up for it. The rich sour-cream dip can make one go weak in the knees!

Prawn in Fragrant Coriander Sauce - The less innovative dish of the evening though delicious in flavor and texture...

Beer Battered Fish with Orange Ponzu Tartare - light, fluffy batter-fried fish presented in beer cans - the real attraction was however the orange infused japanese ponzu dip which upped the taste quotient of the dish several notches higher!

My heartfelt appreciation for a place that serves missi roti and kotthu porottha, Khabsa and Khao Pad - all under one roof! I am glad that such experiments are happening in the heart of Kolkata, thanks to Chef Banick! He really knows his craft well! Good luck !

Hospitality: 5/5
Value for money: 5/5

Outstanding food, outstanding cocktails and outstanding hospitality with unbelievable bang for buck: pretty much sums up this place.

We tried beer can tempura, charmoula, deviled crabs and one more fish entree; all lip-smacking delicacies and made with utmost finesse . The tempura was the crunchiest I have ever had and the sauces were beyond excellent.

The cocktails were finely balanced between alcohol strength and taste. We tried the jamun vodkatini, blue electric, hazelnut, michelada and some more and none of them dissapointed in taste and got us tipsy too.

The owner is an extremely friendly guy and so are the waiters who are well versed with the menu and will help you with your order and suggest foods and cocktails based on individual preferences.

If you live in Kolkata and you haven't been here, you're missing the jewel in the crown of Kolkata's food landscape. I will surely come here at least once every time I'm in Kolkata.

Wow!! What a range of cocktails they offer. Simply Superb! Tried different types of cocktails, each and every cocktail was better than one another.
Chef was very interactive with the guests, which is very very rare to see in any good and sophisticated restaurant. He even suggested few cocktails and food dishes to us which were really mouth watering. Loved the food presentation. 
Been there for dinner with friends on my birthday, and must say a really memorable place for the special day. 
Overall best experience till date.

I prefer to drink cocktails only here rather than any other place in Kolkata. Complimented by great food, whether starters or main course, this is the best place as of now to make your day special. The best thing about it is the chef who engages with your on a personal basis, which is very rare, and once you speak with him, you can clearly come to know about his enthusiasm regarding food and drinks which also shows in what is served for your taste buds. 
*If you want to try a different cocktail, try the milkmaid chaitini (tea with vodka). @

This place has been in the lime light from its inception through its good word of mouth and promotional activities. I was keen on exploring it as i was getting feedback from my fellow foodies & soon the opportunity came as we decided to celebrate our friends birthday here.
We were greeted nicely by staff and were given preferred seating.I liked the decor and the concept of lighting which demarcates the family & men section.The staff guided us through the menu and we ordered Shish Taouk,Pan Fried Chilly Fish as starters along side with Litchitini, The Mango Driver & Kool Cucumber. In main course we had Nasi Goreng, Fish with Chilly Oyster & Mushroom, Laal Maas, Murgh Da Mokul along with Masala Kulcha, Multigrain Tandoori Roti & Butter Naan as choice of breads.
100% Jack Daniyels & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse was our choice for desserts to end it one a different note.
This outlet will soon be the "PLACE TO GO" for connoisseurs due to innovative & lucrative menu,nice offers & pricing strategies and last but not the least the Captain of the ship,the entrepreneur who with his warm reception ensures that you come back for some good times.

A completely mismatch decor with terrible service, serving great food this is exactly how I will desribe my experience here. Food, highly commendable and thought about. We have had the potato starter which was fused eith kafir leaves, tikkis, Manchurian fish, noodles, chilly chicken. A great thumbs up about food, but you can only taste them if you ready to wait for an hour and wrong orders to be brought to your table ,by the waiters.

A friend of mine recommended spicekraft to me a month and from then on i have been meaning to try it. Very nice interiors but very small cramped up space inside. The staff did a good job suggesting and the service was fast too. 
We orderd the dajaj charmoula , beer batter tempura fish and devilled crabs.
1. Dajaj charmoula was very nice and tasty. Smoky succculent chicken legs. 
2. Tempura fish was crispy crunchy and yum. The sauce along with it was tangy and tasty as well.
3. The only letdown was the crab. I didnt enjoy it. Too much cheese and salt masked the actual taste of the crab meat.
The price was pocketfriendly. Enjoyed my first experience.

Another of those WOW kind of restaurant.
Good¬†sized restaurant located a bit before hazra law college if you are travelling from ballygunge phari.¬†
Looks simple from outside and not too big but as they say, don't judge a book by its cover. This one is certainly a good place to crash in.
Ambiance is too good along with the inner decoration of the place.¬†
When it comes to food and behaviour of the staffs, this one certainly gets 5star. They foods and drinks were real yummy specially their all time hit "Lymwn Samak" and "Dejaj Chermoula ".
Most important and mentionable thing was that their chief was roaming around in the restaurant asking people for their feedback. My friend told him that the "Moon Faan" rice tasted a bit salty and he himself told us about taking the rest and making it better by adding some more rice to it. We politely said thanx to him and didn't change the rice. This is the one thing I have never seen in any other restaurants I have dinned in.
To end the party they presented the bill in a nice looking box along with some of those yummy imli toffees. Just wow and wow.

This place deserves a special mention. Their innovative menu and amazing taste is something that makes me keep coming back here! So I happened to drag one of my friends from Delhi,¬†to try out this new place. I myself have been here a couple of times and it is always a wonderful experience! For starters we had the Beer Can Tempura Fish, which I feel is one of their signature dishes. The Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab was another gem. Also the ¬†Hyderabadi Mutton Haleem Kibeh is highly recommended! And finally there was the dessert, the Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss. This was heavenly too! The pocket pinch is really reasonable even with alcohol! The Chef's suggestions are the ones to lookout for! A very warm and happy experience. Looking forward to getting served by you guys again!

We came here for lunch thinking it would be a wonderful time with family. 

1)The quality of food was below average! It was disgusting! It had no taste. The fish and chicken and starters were BLAND!

2)We ordered 3 starters. And the dips which they served with the starters were stale! 
They tasted ugly. Serving us stale curd. What even is this?!?

3) The tables. They were dirty. Everything was sticky. Our hands and Palm, were sticky! 

4) The bathroom. Oh my god! 
When I went to wash my hands, I couldn't stay inside for more than a min. It was so dirty! 

5) The waiters! 
Well they weren't courteous at all! When asked to get the food as they were ready and not get all together. They refuse to listen to us and insist on getting it all together. 

6) The main course was 3 out of 10 
The fish, which they call their 'signature dish' was miserable. 
The chicken was the only thing was made me write 3 out of 10 in the main course. Although still not up to the mark. 
The Red Thaj curry was supposedly 'authentic' as said by them. But nah, bad. All I could taste was the flavour of coconut. And it was too too spicy. 
The Pasta, oh my god again. It was sweet. I mean who served 'sweet' flavoured penne pasta?!

7) We hated the food we ordered so instead of that we had to order black daal and naan. 
This is what was the only edible main course food item!

8) We asked the waiter to cancel the pasta and the so called 'signature' fish as they weren't edible at all!
He cancelled the pasta from the bill but not the 'signature' fish! 
When asked why, he said. 
"sir it is our 'special' dish. We cannot cancel it."
What kind of an explanation is that??
He refused to cancel and was arguing. 
Very nice courteous waiters they have( LOL ) 

9) Then when asked for the menu to see the desserts. 
The waiter on giving the menu to my sister, spilled her drink on her clothes by knocking off the glass. 
He refused to apologise as according to him 'it wasn't his fault' 
I felt like screaming at those good for nothing staff but then I didn't want to create a scene as there were many people.( i dont know how they come ) 

10) First time here. 
Definitely my last time here too. 
Please I urge you not to go here as you will ruin your mood as well as the occasion. 

Thanks for reading!

Its a nice place if you are a lover of continental food.The interior decoration and arrangements are considerably good.When it comes to food,yes they speak of high quality but what i found as a drawback there is the late serving time and the limited availability of the items.The mocktails are worth trying.We took tangarita and kiwi and mango collins.Both were delightful to taste.For starters we had stir fried seallions and mushroom duxelle which was the best item according to me.For main course we took pasta and shepherds pie both of which were amazing.Coming to desserts, we were a bit disheartened.We had ordered their very famous jack daniel mousse.After a long wait they returned to inform that it had melted and we had to order some other dessert.They offered their valentines day special dessert which was quite a satisfactory compensation.Overall a pleasant place with really good food.

Just awesome and brilliantly unique! Very few restaurants deserve a perfect high five and this is undoubtedly one of them. Zomato had some excellent reviews about this place, especially its cocktail section, so I decided to visit here for a special occasion, but was still apprehensive as I was never really into cocktails. But the Vodkatinis here are really well thought of and prepared. We had the Cranapple Driver, the Hazlenut Heaven and the Jamun Mary all cocktailed with Absolut Vodka, as part of an offer (just for Rs. 450). All three of them were different in taste and really well conceptualized.

For starters, just go for the Beer Can Tempura Fish along side whatever you want to order. Don't miss this delicious cuisine.

In the main course, we had the Shepherd's Pie and Coq-Au-Vin. Both of them unique and together heavy for even 2 people. Won't describe these food as firstly I don't have words to describe them and secondly you need to experience them yourself. You don't mind getting fat for these kinds of food. :)

I don't generally take food pics, but I couldn't resist capturing them this time. Attaching those photos soon.

High five!

Molecular gastronomy, this is what the restaurant is about. Amongst the new places in Calcutta,  spicekraft tops the list. This place is incomparable. I can't decide the best dish because all the dishes are exceptional. It's the first time I have had it all, chicken, mutton, fish, pork and prawns.  Chef Sambit deserves a special mention. He knows his dishes really well and interacts with all the customers. I haven't had a more fulfilling experience in a long time.

The plan was to spend few hours in the evening with food and drinks; while also discussing some work. Chose this place as it looked good on the website (and app) and this being a weekday; we were not really looking for a pub. And this place is within a 20-30 mins driving distance.

Here is what is disappointing:

1. They seem to have designated areas like "couples and ladies", "family" and "stag". Remember this is not a pub and just a restaurant. Also, we could easily see that there were some 50-ish people who were having whatever they were having in the "couples and ladies" zone; and some other people too. So clearly this is just a temporary rule and is followed at the whims of the people managing it.

2. Since there was a plan to discuss work; we (I) needed a wi-fi connection. Although this is advertised in zomato page and app, there is no such connection. The management has some poor non-technical excuses.

Eventually, disappointed with the overall "rules" and lack of wi-fi, chose to walk out without ordering anything.

This place was in my wish list for a couple of months and finally I paid a visit last Sunday. The ambiance was nice and classy. The staffs were very helpful and courteous.
Now, let's come to the food. For the starter we were ordering something from the 'Treasures of Asia' but the staff insisted us to try out their in-house favourite, Beer Can Tempura Fish. It was basically a crunchy batter fried fish which tasted good but the dip served with it was mouth watering. For the main, we had mixed haka noodles with Roast pork in Rendang curry. The pork was nicely cooked, but the pork fat in the curry was a let down.
Overall it was a pleasant experience and I'm looking forward to visit this place again to try out their cocktails.

A bunch of us, lovely ladies, made our way to Zomato‚Äôs first Masterclass in Kolkata on International Women‚Äôs Day at Spice Kraft and what followed was two hours of unadulterated fun with four cocktails and lots of food. Chef Sambit Banick explained the cocktail mixology lessons for all the four cocktails he served us ‚Äì Mulled Wine, Cosmopolitan, Apple Wood Smoked Guava Marry, and Utterly Butterly Jameson, in the same order.

The first drink, Mulled Wine, was the only one to be taught by the Chef when all of us were non-ebriated. I took notes, diligently and then, after such academic high-point, came in a warm Red Wine Drink, with honey, cinnamon, orange zest, and orange juice, so potent and delicious, that it won my heart. The honey and cinnamon added another dimension to the red wine and if you like warm drinks, which are pretty strong, this should be the one for you.

Classic Cosmopolitan came in next, and it was one of the best I have had in Calcutta, with perfect ratio of the Fresh Lime juice, Cointreau, and Cranberry Juice ‚Äì not too diluted, not too sweet.

Apple Wood Smoked Guava Marry, a take on Bloody Mary, was my least favorite of the cocktails. I didn‚Äôt like the guava flavor, and Worcestershire combination. Plus, I have spent a good deal of my college life drinking Real‚Äôs Guava Juice and Vodka on hostel terrace, and this fancy guava cocktail couldn‚Äôt replace the former, unfortunately.

Last came in the Utterly Butterly Jameson, with the goodness of peanut butter, Jameson Irish Whiskey, Amul Cream and Hershey‚Äôs Chocolate Syrup. What can really go bad with a drink with such ingredients? Sweet items and alcohol are a potent combination, and this was a pretty strong drink. If you like sweet cocktails, you should try it out. This is more of a dessert cocktail, and hence a good idea is to have the drink towards the end of your meal.

And if you are wondering how I managed to really remember so much after three outstanding cocktails, well, I didn‚Äôt! My academic vigour faded with the first drink and barely stayed through the second. Thankfully, Zomato‚Äôs alcohol-algorithm predicted such possible behavior, and we were handed out detailed, printed recipe sheets at the very onset for future reference. :)

Of course, there was a lot of good food to go with the drinks.

We were served : Kele ke phool ke croque monsieur (Kele ke Phool, cooked using French Technique with cheese on top); Subj ki Galawat (Lucknowi Galawati Spices on vegetarian cutlet) Vietnamese Khao Tay Potatoes (Khao Tay sauce on potatoes, served with Basil leaves as garnish) in the vegetarian section, and Lebanese Dajaj Chermoula Chicken (Chermoula spiced perfectly cooked chicken pieces), Beer Can Temoura Fish (extremely fluffy and light beer-batter fry fish) and Prawns in Fragrant Coriander (least favourite dish, with slightly chewy prawns) in the non-vegetarian section.

For me, there were three things that set apart these dishes ‚Äì

(a)	Superb execution ‚Äì All the items were cooked to perfection. The Chermoula Chicken was marinated so well that it was probably one of juiciest pieces of meat I have had in a while. The Khao Tay Potatoes were cooked in the Siracha Chilli spices so masterfully that the every bite into the potato tasted of the spice unlike the pre-cooked gravy + bar boiled potato combination that is served in many restaurants.

(b)	Spice Craft ‚Äì Of course, Chef Sambit didn‚Äôt tell us his secret spice recipes, but he is quite a master of using spices as it turns out. The Kele Ke Phool starter, my personal favourite, was soft, and seasoned very well, and unless told, it is very difficult to even decipher that this is the humble Bengali - Mocha. The Chermoula was Chef‚Äôs personal favourite, and it was outstanding as well.

(c)	Dips and Sauces ‚Äì I am a firm believer that good dips and sauces are an integral part of a great dish, and Chef Sambit gave us some of the best to offer ‚Äì from the standard Lebneh Dip with Tahini and Roasted Garlic with the Chermoula Chicken to the innovative fusion combinations of Aam Chur and Ginger Cr√®me Fraiche with the Kele Ke Phul Starter and Orange Ponzu Tartare for the Beer Battered Fish. In fact, the dips were the silent stars of each of the dishes they were served with.

To cut the long story short, if you have not visited Spice Kraft yet ‚Äì Run and visit ASAP !

Zomato pampered me with a gift voucher from SpiceKraft as well ‚Äì So I will be visiting real soon !

I went there after getting a complimentary meal from zomato.
Its not very hard to find.. just some steps ahead of the hazra law college.
The ambience was awesome with dim lighting.
The music was perfect as they were playing godfather theme song and various other tracks. The food was too good to express. The only thing which was not good there was the waiting time for food as it took almost half an hour to prepare the dishes and serve.
Overall its a nice place for spending a cool evening.

It was a double celebration for us and I decided to celebrate this on this joint.¬†

For the starters we ordered some drinks first, we went for the Chivas Julep & Spicy Pomegranate. To be honest the drink tasted a bit different nice but it was not absolutely wow. The spicy pomegranate tasted better.

From the Chef's signature entries we went for a couple of them, the first being the Beer can Tempura, its unique in the way the dish was server, literally on an empty beer can and the taste was smacking good. If you are here don't miss this if you are a non vegetarian. We then went for a Lebanon dish Dejaj charmola, the presentation of the dish was really great but I personally did not like the taste of the dis, it was sort of tanduri chicken leg pieces served to you spice less. However the meat was soft juicy and tender. We then went for Pan fried chilli fish which was simply fantastic.¬†

In the mean time we had finished our drinks and wanted to go with some classics and hence our choice was single malt Glenfidich no further questions asked.¬†

On the main course we went for the Chicken with schezwan sauce ¬†fried rice Red Pepper prawns. The taste of all these were really good.¬†

For ambiance, any day it scores high 4, the seating arrangement could be a bit better. In terms of the food taste 4 again, 1 deducted for that initial Lebanon dish. The quantity is more than enough of what is being served.¬†

However, for us the best part was yet to come, the chef personally met us and wanted to know about the dishes and we gladly gave the feedback and at the end he offered us a special dessert, ice cream hot and cold. Try it out, I think this would be the best desert in town.¬†

I should finally admit it was not at all a bad choice to celebrate here. This is truly one of the good joints today in Kolkata.

A lovely experience. The place is definitely a nice one to unwind after a hard day at work. The cocktails are unbelievable. It's a drinker's paradise with amazing offers on Cocktails and the liquor is cheaper than many others. We went for an offer where we got 3 vodka based cocktails made with Absolut for Rs 450. Tried Guava Balsamic Mary, Kiwi Vodkatini and Cranapple Cosmopolitan. All were nice but don't expect Mezzuna level. We ordered devilled crab and chicken parmesan spaghetti. The chef personally came out and enquired our preferences on the veggies to be added. Food was yummy. Together 6 cocktails, devilled crab, spaghetti  and 2 shots of tequila came to 1972 with taxes. It's amazingly affordable and definitely in my frequent visit list.

Firstly a huge thanks to Zomato for inviting me to such an innovative venture. A masterclass or rather a live cocktail session by Chef Sambit Banik at Spice Kraft. I was very excited to meet fellow foodies and learn about cocktails and surely it turned out to b a splendid experience. The session started with mulled wine accompanied by kele je phool ke croque monsieur( kele ke phool is actually mocha as we Bengalis call it ) and dajaj Charmoula as nibbles. The next segmnt consisted of classic cosmopolitan along with beer can tempura fish ( a specialty) and subj ki galawat(Specially for veg lovers so that they can have a taste of how galawati kebab tastes). Next was Guava Mary along with Vietnamese khao tey vegetables and Prawns in fragrant coriander. Lastly came the utterly butterly Jameson which can be referred to as a cocktail dessert n undoubtedly it was the showstopper of the day. Each and every item was mouthwatering and the ease with which the chef prepared the cocktails in front of our eyes was literally a visual treat in itself. I even optes for a takeaway for which I did not have to pay insipte of requesting repeatedly.

I'll b here as soon as possible for trying the main courses and 100% Jack Daniel's mousse.

Its a good place if you are a foodie and want to have drinks with good snacks. Tempura fish is a must try dish. It is served in a beer can. It doesnt have loud music for obvious reason that it is in a residential kind of place. Some of the chef recommended dishes are indeed fantastic. I visted once again and it indeed made me like this place a lot more due to very good behaviour of the staff and offcourse its awesome food.

So in my 75+ reviews on Zomato, I finally give a place a 1 rating... And I wasnt expecting it to go to Spice Kraft. After all the fantastic reviews I read over here, it turned out to be a nightmare. Food- Good, no issues | Service - Pathetic

1. It takes 10min for us to even get the menus, despite calling him multiple times
2. We order 2 drinks, including a Baileys and we keep waiting and waiting. Starter arrives, but no sign of the drinks. After almost 20min of the order, 1 drink comes and when we ask about the Baileys, he says sorry it is cancelled since it isnt available. For Gods sake, if it wasnt available, did you have to wait for me to ask you rather than telling it to me yourself. And that also you tell me that order got cancelled.
3. We ask for the menu to change the drink and even before we have reordered a drink, they serve the main course. Do i need to tell you that main course comes post the drinks? The reordered drink takes another decade to arrive, all this while the main course is stranded on the table.
4. The icing on the cake, after a lot of back and forth discussions we finish dinner and ask for the bill and what was the last thing you expect. They bill you for the Baileys !!

Spice Kraft, you were worse than I could have imagined. So badly undermanned. You need at least 3 more guys to help serve the footfall you pull. And with this ends the story of my screwed saturday evening. Thank you for messing it up, hoping never to meet and visit you again.

Visited this restaurant for a fine dining lunch experience on a weekday. The restaurant is located opposite to the Law College on the main road and is not difficult to locate. The first thing i found attractive was the signange... its colourful and very bright. i think it looks better at night... the colours would be more visible then. The restaurant was on my wish list for quite sometime but distance was an issue. So one day when we friends wanted to have lunch together we zeroed on this new place in town. I heard good reviews through word of mouth and also checked online. There is a separate section for stags, family and couples and friends. The decor is aesthetically done with separate interior for all three sections. I liked the miniature truck models kept on the tables. they are very colourful and gives a very quirky feel. The menu card is also pretty simple and nicely done. The menu is pretty interesting with various fushion food in it. We ordered for Shepherds pie initially... and it was one of the best pie i tasted in Kolkata. The way it was presented was good enough. I did not like the variety of bread though. With that price i think the customers can get a better variety for sure. We thought of tasting the Indian items after our continental stint and ordered butter garlic naan along with laal maas. The mutton pieces were well cooked and were succulent. The gravy had the perfect blend of spices and it went well with the naan. Next we ordered for a chicken indian dish... i think it was the butter chicken gravy. It was nice but nothing great. We closed our session with fresh lime soda and a burp :D Overall a nice experience. I would like to visit once again to try out the other unique items available in the menu.

Kind of a late review for this place. Definitely worth many more visits. located on the main Hazra-ballygunj road, almost non descript and easy to miss. just keep an eye for the alcohol shop.¬†

Coming to the food, very innovative and quite tasty as well. try the beer tempura fish or the roasted pork chops. youll not be disappointed. alcohol was good, we had a bunch of em. they make a host of cocktails. Hammer jack turned out to be pretty potent one. the 3 large Black dogs for 700 offer is great for the big leaguers :p
A point to note were the amazing presentations on offer, be it for the food or the drinks. They were yet to introduce the draught beer when we visited.
The service was good, and they interacted and suggested items whenever we turned to them. Not a very pricey place without compromising a bit for the quality, judging by the current trend of paying exorbitant prices and taxes for the fancy places in the city.
Yet to taste the desserts which i've heard is pretty amazing. will be there soon for more.

Spice Kraft, a well-known name among the foodie circles these days, had been on my wishlist for a while. But since I stay quite far, it takes a special reason to visit any restaurant..and what could be better than celebrating my birthday here? So we decided to go last night, for my birthday dinner. The place is easy to find, and though not large, the seating space is comfortable enough.¬†We loved the food, especially the fact that each dish was fresh, perfectly seasoned, non-greasy, not unnecessarily spicy, and was served elegantly. The chef also made several appearances, and it was so much fun to swap gastronomical stories! I also got to cut a 'birthday cake' :D My only suggestion would be to add a few more serving staff, though thankfully the service was not too slow for us.. and to keep the AC a bit high, because we were sort of boiling, haha.¬†

Here's what we ordered (pics are jumbled, sorry)
Starters -¬†
Bacardi Limon infused tandoori chicken cocktail sausages¬†
Dajaj Charmoula
Beer Can Tempura Fish

Drinks -¬†
Mango Driver Vodkatini
Cranapple Driver Vodkatini
Rainbow (Virgin)
Mango Kiwi Collins (Virgin)

Mains -¬†
Coq-Au-Vin
Chicken Stroganoff
Fish Wellington
Shepherd's Pie

Dessert -¬†
100% Jack Daniel's and Berry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse with Drunken Petit Fours (we shared this because we were stuffed)

Verdict -¬†
The starters were yum, soft, succulent, especially the fish. We know why it's the favourite item! The dips/sauces were a tad sweet, and though tasty by itself, didn't quite complement the dishes they were served with..except the Dajaj Charmoula and its yoghurt dip
The drinks were done well, mixed perfectly.
Mains were great as well. The Beckty was soft, fresh and absolutely yummy. The saffron pilaf was amazing, not overpowering, seasoned mildly and was complementing the fish perfectly. The chicken dishes and pie were up to mark as well.
As for the dessert (we were stuffed at this point), had to cancel the warm chocolate fondant, and just took a plate of the JD Mousse... My parents being non-boozy folks, had a spoonful only, so this was shared by my aunt and me. LOVED IT. The mousse was amazziiiiiiiiiing!!!!¬†

Chef, thank you for the attention to food! I promise, we'll be back soon!!!¬†

Love - Trisha and Family!

After reading a lot of positive reviews about the place, just went on exploring myself; easily located, ambience was not that good but it suited according to the place.  I ordered kele-ke- phool ke corque monsieur, khoi tay, noodles. It was not that bad , but could have been more better, i ordered liit too which was good and 100%jd desert which impressed me alot . All in all i had a good experience, one flaw is the small flies which roam about the table which is very disturbing.

After waiting for a long time I finally got a chance to visit this place...I always check the menu and reviews of a place before dropping in just to be sure of what I am gonna be served there...
The moment I read the reviews for this place on zomato I just knew I had to go there...so finally this Monday e decided to go there for lunch...
We reached there somewhere around 12 so the place was empty...we were seated near the AC...the place isn't quite big but that can never stop u from visiting there because of the vastness and uniqueness of their menu..
We ordered one beer can tampura fish one Shepherd's pie and one grilled fish...for drinks we ordered one Manhattan and one liit.
The drinks as well as the food was fabulous...espcly the drnk and the beer can tampura fish...nothing like I have had before...
The bill came around 1.6k...so it's affordable...and worth visiting again and again.
Looking forward to again try something different next time.

Had read brilliant reviews about the place and some friends had also recommended it but our experience was quite disappointing. 2 of us went there on a Sunday afternoon. The most disappointing thing was the service. We ordered bacardi limon infused chicken sausages and murg hussaini boti for starters. The sausages were served 50 mins after we placed the order and the boti was served with the main course, an hour and half after the order. The reason given for the slow service was that the boti takes a long time to get prepared, however this wasn't told to us while ordering and neither was it mentioned till we started getting fidgety and angry. The sausages were delicious and the churan went very well with the sausages. But the boti was quite tasteless. The meat was cooked perfectly but under seasoned.
For main course we ordered the shepherd's pie and coq au vain. This was the first time I had shepherds pie and it tasted great. The garlic bread were the perfect accompaniment. However the meat in the coq au vain was overcooked and very tough. The rice could also have been a little more flavoured.
Coming to the desserts, we had the monte carlo and the fondant. The monte carlo was a good dessert, both vanilla and chocolate being the recipe for perfection. The fondant on the other hand tasted more of flour and less of chocolate. A very bad taste to end your meal with.
The service is unsatisfactory as nobody has the patience to explain what the dishes are which makes the experience of selecting and ordering quite a hassle. And it took us close to 50 mins to get out first plate of starters and the speed of service never improved from there.
Not really sure if i would want to visit them again.

I've been here 3 times in the last month or so and it's a real gem. Some dishes we've tried:

Pork Belly Boti Kabab - this is not on the menu but was recommended by the owner. Plenty of succulent pork fat! Get it if you can.

Coq-Au-Vin - Really delicious and dense red wine reduction sauce on chicken. It would be nice if this was paired with steamed veggies or something to balance it out.

Dajaj Chermoula - These look like chicken "lollipops" but are much much better, like an ideal chicken kabab. Juicy and full of flavor. Delicious dip too.

Pork Ribs Burrah Kabab - Good juicy pork.

Prawn Balchao - This was simply amazing.

Nawabi Dum Ki Murg - A perfectly balanced curry, not oily.

100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss - A rich and light mousse paired with bit size cakes, and a hint of JD in one or both of them (we could not agree on it). Fantastic.

Overall excellent, interesting food at an affordable price. Service was fine and the place has a pleasant ambiance. My only complaint is that all of the dishes are very rich. It seems hard to order a balanced meal. But that's a pretty minor issue, and a very common problem with Kolkata restaurants.

i think when u walk into any restaurant..ur basically in need of three things..service, food..ambiance..(not exactly in that order perhaps).. This one failed terribly!!¬†
Service- there were waiters running up and down...trainees..who had no idea of what was what on the menu..upon being asked for details...they kept running about asking seniors...the waiting time was like ...could even drive Gandhi violent!! Of course we went on V day...with family ..just about 1 pm.. and they said.. their cook arrived late...WHHHHAAAT??!! really when u advertise so much and there's a whole halo of high ratings and woowss around you.. this is the lamest of reason u can come up with.. we literally left at 4 pm. the drinks actually took more than an hour of plain simple sitting around in one of their dimly lit places.

Food..well we were literally forced on with our choice of food..every thing we wanted to have would apparently take " long time" to prepare..we had the lobster thermidor..which was decent..nothing extra ordinary..fish tempura was better..the drinks had nothing MOLECULAR about them . we ordered the spicy pomegranate and the smoked guava...when asked about it...the guy said...because we're on too much pressure we cant make those right now..so why the hell did we have to pay for them????!!! it was just a regular boring ..not at all tasty cocktail. DO NOT EVER ORDER noodles...it was pathetic...and i regret having said yes to the waiter when he mentioned it .

Ambiance is okay..but because they were expecting a lot of people they opened the other areas too... which were poorly lit..no such decor...and looks very dull and boring!!! the area just as you enter is much better!!¬†

Reading ¬†a lotta good things about this place made us settle on it to spend V day..but it was a disaster..!!

We went to Spice Kraft at an unfortunate time. There was some problem with the cook or interiors, and that resulted in a fixed menu. We had to cut down our preferences by a lot. The lobster was available but it was a little bland. The starters were good. But the highlight was the cocktails. We had 2 long island ice teas among us and a sangria and they made our day. But I hope to go someday and get a choice from the entire selection!

Now this one is a lot talked about and all for the good reasons. The hospitality, and food, the cocktails, you will hardly find out a reason to complain.¬†
I must admit the variety of food they offer, we faced difficulty to choose what exactly to have coz we wanted to try it all, and that is definitely not possible with one visit. So we opted to try out the in-house favourites, Beer Can Tempura Fish and Dajaj Charmoula. Both so delicious that you can hardly decide which is the best. But the dip served with Beer Can Tempura fish steals the show. It is really THAT good. We also tried out a Tandoori Sausage which is really well cooked and so different. It comes with the sauce in a dropper, just imagine!
Now coming to the drinks, I was a little hesitant to try out the Tangarita because of the presence of Green Chilly (I am not a spicy person) but the waiter insisted and I ended up loving it! Also the Hammerjack that we ordered was nicely made and it gives you a nice kick right to your head.
I am definitely coming back to try the rest of the menu that we could not even venture.
The only think that I didn't like is something many may feel unnecessary yet I must say it..it is the way the handkerchiefs are rolled and kept in the glasses. For some reasons I find it creepy. But this definitely is not going to stop me coming back to this place again!

Good ambience. Soothing decor, soft mellow lighting and romantic music. Food tastes good with a twist to most classic dishes. The subtle blending of tastes like an orange dip with a beer batter tempura fried fish are unique. Portions are adequate for two adults. Some items are slightly overpriced though. The presentations are innovative as well. The service is prompt and the staff are courteous but at times they appear too much involved with suggestions and comments which could hamper your private dinner! The over emphasis on alcoholic beverages and use of liquor in most dishes could be changed a bit. Lastly, the toilet could do with some better housekeeping. On the whole, the restaurant provides you with an interesting take on mainstream multicuisine food with a touch of innovation.

SpiceKraft as the name suggests has some connotations of space and to be honest the decor of the once silver oak(ballygunge) is really worth a mention.
The cocktails and food presentation is nice.
My tip: Do not try and have only a pint of beer or a standard alcohol and waste money over there Go and try the cocktails/mocktails and the innovative food.
Eg: Bacardi Limon infused tandoori chicken.
Plus: The food (practically anything you order with the chefs recommendation would be good).
Minus : The space (the actual seating area :D) is very restrictive and this is a major drawback.

Very good , But  NOTHING Exceptional  !!!!  because of the location they are in business . Resto bars like spice kraft are to be found in dozens in elgin road or sarat bose road area . Lack of competition from nearby localities ensure that spice kraft gets a 4.4 average rating on zomato .

Firstly the place is medium sized ...... & certainly NOT HUGE as some reviews may suggest .

prices are moderate & best part is  NO 27% wbst on alcohol , which  is a  huge relief  !!!  

Ambiance & decor is warm & appealing , however nothing out of this world as i have mentioned before !!! 

The staff are extremely courteous & if you're lucky the chef himself will come down to your table for recommendations .  service overall is exemplary  !!! they actually treat you like a  king !!! 

Coming to our dining experience Last evening , we started Off with alcohol  .

3 small pegs of captain morgan with cold drinks 

& 3 large pegs of black dog Combo for rs 700 ( a great initiative ) 

Basically you get 180 ml of black dog for rs 700 , which means a large peg ( 60 ml ) will cost you around 235 bucks  ...... Fair enough  Deal !!! 

In starters  we had " Beer Can tempura fish " which was kinda ok  as the pieces had more coating than slices of fish .

we also had  " bacardi limon infused  chicken sausage "  which tasted great but  had only 6 medium sized sausages .

In the Main course we opted for indian & ordered " Murg da mokul " & rarha ghost ( mutton ) along with naan & tandoori roti .

Both the chicken & mutton dishes were exquisitely done & made our evening !!! 

overall a satisfactory experience but certainly NOT OUTSTANDING !!! 

Here's the break up of the bill  ......

3 Large Peg Black dog combo = Rs 700 

2 Small Peg Black dog : 2 X Rs 175 = Rs 350 

3 Small Peg  captain morgan rum : 3 X Rs 95 = Rs 285

3 thums Up  : 3 X Rs 45 = Rs 135 

2 Soda         : 2 X Rs 35  = Rs 70

1 Beer can tempura fish  = Rs 225

1 B* Limon infused chicken sausage = Rs 225

1 murg da mokul   =Rs Rs 225 

1 rarha Ghost        =Rs 295

1 Tandoori roti     = Rs 28 

2 plain  Naan : 2 X rs 39 = Rs 78 

--------------------------------------------------

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† = Rs 2616

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†+ VAT 

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† + Sevice tax 

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† = RS  2953

Overall Verdict  : Very Good but  Not Exceptional !!!! 

3.5/ 5 from my side 

¬†

cheers !!!

Located at a very good location near ballygunge phari..this is a unique restaurant in that area..the ambience is pretty good..though one might complain that it's a bit too dark for the liking..food quality is great..but they lack variety in their menu..however,they have a collection of a wide variety of drinks..and the cocktails are great..price wise,its a tad expensive..but overall.. It's a nice place to hang out with friends or to take your special one for a dinner..

This place deserves no less than a 5.0 rating.. In fact I would have given more if I could...but spice kraft made my day... I am a student of Hazra law college so I knew the location very well but little did I know that this place serves one of the best few continentals in the city..
The ambience, food, behaviour of the staffs- everything was flawless... The staffs also recommend their best dishes and guide you in every way possible... I loved your service
Coming to the food, we ordered virgin mojito which was chilled and fresh, pork ribs burrah kebab which was so juicy and tasty that I found a slice of heaven in it...plz try this dish.. Then we had chunky tuna mille feuille which was their recommendation and I cannot describe in words how it tasted..It was simply out of the word and so different from dishes I have tasted earlier...then we had grilled fish with lemon butter sauce which made the perfect end to this wonderful dinner... I loved this place immensely and the staffs deserve a big salute... Thank u so much for this wonderful experience ... :)

This place is fine dining at it's very best. The quality of food and sophistication they offer will melt your heart. The waiter came and actually helped us decide on the dishes, telling us on his own accord what will go well with what. We has Pork Ribs Burra Kabab which was out of the world. Then came the Chunky Tune Mille Feuille. The dish was novel and very tasty. This was followed by Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce which was a little sweet to my taste but it was nicely made. The fish melted in my mouth, the grilled texture was just exquisite. Then the chef came to greet us in the end, and he was so cordial and nice. The behaviour of the staff. the music, the ambiance made me reach food heaven. Keep up the good work Spice Kraft!!

Spice Kraft, located on Hazra Road is known for its quirky fusion dishes, incorporating classic French culinary techniques with Indian flavours. I visited the place with a few friends. The ambience was lovely, with its chic decor, array of wine bottles, the salt and pepper "truck" on the table and the soft instrumentals playing in the background.

Coming to the food itself. I particularly loved the appetizers of which we had ordered four. The Squid Rings in Butter Garlic had squid rings in a sweet and rich and onion jam with a generous helping of bell peppers. With its bold, sharp flavours, it was a lovely start to the meal. However, the squid rings were a tad tough. The Beer Can Tempura Fish was pretty average and I didn't quite like the accompanying orange ponzu tartare sauce. The Chicken Dajaj Chermoula was absolutely delicious, with the delicate chermoula spice and smoky char, served with a labneh yoghurt dip. The Bacardi Limon infused Tandoori Chicken sausage with Blueberry Churan Coulis was certainly the best appetizer ordered. The sausage was not too chewy, the flavours were as advertised and the coulis with its weird and innovative flavour combination was tangy and delicious.

For the mains, we decided to go down the Asian route and ordered 2 rice dishes and two sides. Both the Nasi Goreng and Khao Pad Sapparod were good, but I loved the latter, with its chunks of pineapple and fish balls. For sides were ordered Chicken with Chilly Oyster and Mushroom and Green Chilli Chicken. The oyster chicken was extremely savoury and moreish. The green chilli chicken, with its flavours of coriander and lemongrass, was absolutely stunning.

For dessert we ordered the Monte Carlo and Jack Daniels Mousse. The Monte Carlo was your usual brownie, ice cream and chocolate sauce, served in a glass, a combo that will never disappoint. But the real treat was the Jack Daniels and Callebaut Milk Chocolate Mousse, served with sponge cakes soaked in Cointreau with a slick of orange crush across the place. I loved the combination of chocolate and orange laced with the flavours of alcohol. Certainly an innovative dessert.

Service was prompt and the staff were extremely courteous and helpful. They made the Green Chilli Chicken, originally a dry starter dish, into a gravy dish to go with our mains on our request, which I really appreciate.My only regret? All the molecular dishes were unavailable, including deconstructed papri chaat which I had my eye on, owing to some difficulties. Everything else was perfect. And what more, the value for money is excellent, considering the calibre of food being served. A must-visit for all fusion food lovers.

This is a very new restaurant which has come up near Hazra Law College, Kolkata.

From the outside it looks like an usual restro cum bar with an off shop by its side; but step inside, and prepare to be amazed. One thing I really love about this place is the hospitality. They treat you like a king

From the chef coming down, suggesting you his signature dishes, to explaining each and every cocktail that we ordered. They believe in the entire experience of dining out- presentation, cleanliness, alert waiters, and heavenly food!

We ordered our hearts out. In starters we had **Beer Battered Fish tempura(bhetki)**, **, Dajaj Charmoula( chicken lollipop tenderly done with sweet curd),** along with two great cocktails - The Hammerjack and the classic Daiquiri;

The beer battered tempura fish is truly a great make! I would just want to go back for it only.

After that we ordered *Pork RIbs Burrah Kebabs( 4 big pork ribs in kebab style)*. This was the best pork kebab I have ever had, Hatts off to the chef honestly:)

Ending with another cocktail The Hazelnut heaven(smirnoff base) and finally their signature 100% Jack Daniels Mousse.

Every dish was rich in flavors, taste and colors. I think this is my favorite restro henceforth.

Ambience was quite good.
Staffs were so friendly and quick to serve.
We ordered beer can tempora fish which was good without the orange ponzu.
Then dajaj chermoula and subz galawat.
Dajaj chermoula was the best in what we ordered.
B&W had offers like 3 large @600 which was great.
We had a great time over Spice Kraft.

One of the best restaurants in Kolkata according to me. I've only tried the continental dishes but they have all been extremely good. The decor is simple and classy, and changes slightly according to the festivities. The presentation of each item is top notch while the dish itself is filled with amazing flavors. 
I would recommend the beer battered fish and the crab cakes. The servers are wonderful and are extremely helpful in choosing the dishes. I have visited this restaurant twice. Once in jan and again in feb and cannot wait to visit again in

A friend suggested me this restaurant and i was there without wasting any time. Located at Ballygunge Phari, it is right at the entry of Hazra Road from the Ballygunge Petrol Pump side. Parking is available on the road and they have a security guard to look after the affairs. The seating zone is divided into two sections with one for family and the other for bachelors which is actually a very good idea. We ordered for a portion of Devilled Crab Meat and Beer Can Tempura Fish. The Tempura fish was good but it is same as Fish & Chips that we have everywhere but they gave it a twist by serving it in a beer can. I detested the Orange Tartare Sauce served with it which was an absolute misfit. They should replace/add a spicy dip with it. The Devilled Crab was simply mindblowing. The Crab meat was first taken out and cooked and then baked with cheese and finally stuffed into the shell. It was a sheer treat for the tastebuds. For the main course we ordered for a portion of Shepard's Pie and went for typical Chinese items like Sczhewan Fried Rice and Chicken. The Shepards Pie was brilliant and even the portion was pretty generous. My feedback would be to slighly lower the portion of Mashed Potato as sometimes it was tasting much of potato. The chinese items were just okayish with nothing much to talk about it. The staff were well informed and courteous and they were ready with recommendations according to our likings.

The name Spice Kraft, a play on the word spacecraft, is quite deliberate and apt. Because the food here is literally out of the world. Not just because they taste great but more due to their frankly daring attempt at bringing fusion to the palate of us Kolkata dwellers. ¬†
It's quite a small place, though the false ceilings and walls will try their best to make you think otherwise. We were their first customers for the day and hence got the restaurant all to ourselves. Comfortably seated and with Pink Floyd playing in the background we ordered our items while fiddling with their truck (yes, you read that right!) shaped salt and pepper containers.¬†¬†
The negatives first. None of their molecular gastronomy items were available that day which was a bummer. And boy, the service is slow. They take their jolly good time : the starters almost took forty five minutes to get served. But then since the wait was worth it, I will not pander further to such negativity.¬†¬†The first item on the menu was Squid rings in butter garlic. I found it to be slightly middling : while the red onion jam was to die for, the butter garlic fried squids did not go that well it. The cons of fusion..! Next up was Dahaj Charmoula which were chicken leg pieces served in an earthen pot served with charmoula spices and char grilled. One of the best items in the entire menu, this one is a must have. Perfectly smoked and with a great white sauce the chicken pieces are to die for. Not to be outdone, the 'Bacardi Limon infused Tandoori chicken sausages' were brilliant too. And brownie points for the presentation which used syringes to drip the coriander mint paste inside the sausages. But the most whacky part of the dish was the churan and blueberry coulis given alongside. A combination no one can dream of yet tasted like a match made in heaven. That came out wrong! Anyways the only disappointment was in the form of the Zomato recommended Beer can Tempura fish with orange ponzu tartare. While the item nailed it look wise, an orange paste with beer battered fish just didn't go for me.
¬†
For main course, there was the wonderful Khao Pad Sapparod (sweetish, yellowish rice with pineapple chunks and meat balls) and Nasi Goreng (a rather spicy fried rice sorta dish served with a fried egg and prawn wafers). To go with it there was chicken in chilly oyester and mushrooms (finally a normal dish that is exactly what it is named) and green chilly chicken (which was originally a dry dish but the attendant was courteous enough to make it gravy for us to eat with the rice). The green chilly chicken especially was really nice as the spiciness of the chicken was well complemented by the coriander and lemon grass.¬†
¬†
Finally after all this we decided to try their signature boozerts (booze + desserts get it? ; not very subtle I know). While we had one classic Monte Carlo which was non alcoholic, next up there was 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut chocolate mousse. Along with it was served four sponge cakes drunk in cointrue. While the taste can be a bit strong for a few, this dish is not like anything you've tasted before.¬†
¬†
It was really a great experience and here's hoping the chef keeps adding new and fun dishes to surprise his patrons.

spice kraft has undoubtedly emerged as one of the fancier places of south kolkata with its heart tugging love wheel and the little cute trucks with a cleverly mis-spelled "public carrier" tag.Therefore,a visit to this eatery had been in the offing for quite some time,and my friend T's birthday came in handy to drop by in this hitherto unvisited joint.
Firstly the ambience impresses with its suaveness-a welcome change from grandeur and ornateness of most upmarket places to hipster youthfulness and pampered frivolity.We ordered red pepper prawn,lucknowi dum biryani, hari mati pulao,murg reshmi malai,a few drinks on a combo offer that I have regrettably forgotten after a drunken stupor,and¬† jack daniels-chocolate mousse for dessert.The staff interacts a lot,and never hesitates to suggest.

By virtue of its measured and aesthetically-added spices which is reminiscent of north indian cuisine in general and awadhi in particular, the chef was prolific in encouraging a fine dining soiree to whip up a jubilation that would linger until at least a few days later.Both the prawn and the biryani were cooked to perfection,and their rich after taste only speaks highly of the chef's congenial fecundity.What confounded me just a bit was their inexplicable but surely non-diabolical, plot to hype up the menu card with the very seminal draught beer.Although occasional lack of stock can be excused, and those that take place in the rush hours are appallingly understandable, nothing of a similar explanation justifies this happening on multiple days,as well-asserted by some other reviewers here in zomato.
The flaws are hard to come by,and are easily overlooked,while the better part of the experience hovers in the mind more often-that's what I feel while bringing this article to a closure.

Well done all of you who are behind this! You are doing a great job! Visited last month..nothing new to say about their great service. You just can't go wrong with ordering here; one has to just surrender themselves to the host! So nobody goes home without trying out all the signature dishes and drinks, all of which are simply delicious, so who can complain? Since we were in a big group we could try out an array of dishes in the main course too. I would like to make a special mention of the laal maas and the moon fan fried rice.

After a struggle to find a good restaurant where I could celebrate my husband's birthday, I came across Spice Kraft. After reading Zomato reviews and ratings I immediately finalised and reserved our table in advance.¬†
We reached there around 8PM, and settled down at the Rose decorated table inside the family section.

In drink we tried "Spicy Pomegranate Cointeau Tonic" & "Chivas Julep". Both were good.

Before our order there was a little surprise b'day cake for my husband. Even I didn't know about that. The cake was exclusively made by Spice Kraft Chef and trust me it was real tasty and not too heavy. We were very happy by their arrangements and hospitality.

Now coming to the food. In starters we ordered "Beer Can Tempura Fish" - a must must try dish once you are at Spice Kraft. The presentation of the dish was quite innovative. Served with a budweiser beer can filled with lettuce finely chopped, the Tempura fish was absolutely delicious to taste!!! Just loved it :)

Next it was "Murgh Kothmiri Kebab" - spicy, juicy chicken kebabs with green chilly and corriander marination. Super tasty and super soft chicken kebabs we had never tasted before :)

Next to that another Spice Kraft signature dish, "Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab" - My husband loves Pork! Soft and juicy ribs with a beautiful combo of sweet and spicy sauce all around it. Tasted super awesome!!!

Then we ordered "Devilled Crab Meat" - My all time favourite. Crab meat was prepared in a cheesy based sauce.Loved the flavours!!! Yummmmy.

By then we were almost full. But with the recommendation of our Chef we ordered one last dish which is a signature continental classic, "Coq - Au - Vin" - had soft medium sized tasty chicken pieces with a little sweetness served with an aromatic buttered rice. Quite a different in taste and we liked this one too :)

I am very sorry that I don't know the name of our Chef, but must mention how he came to us to enquire whether our food was ok or not. Now that was an extra care taken by Spice Kraft.

Regarding deserts, when we asked for a special item "Muhallabien", we were told that it's no more available, due to absence of another Chef. I was bit sad to know that. Not sure will ever be able to taste that or not!

Apart from that I liked everything in SpiceKraft. The ambience was very good and the staffs were friendly. Service was also good. Whatever we tried they all tasted great and was absolutely fresh. My husband and my mother-in-law both were super satisfied with Spice Kraft experience.

We got an offer of 10% discount (by a lucky draw) on our next visit! Will definitely visit again to try some more dishes along with deserts.

'Food is an art' that is what this place signifies.
Very innovative and tasty too. Molecular Gastronomy is what they have used to create the fusion. When you eat it you would realise what it is. Be it drinks or food, its just too good!! Visit atleast once to explore this place ...it won't leave you disappointed.

I went here on my b'day with great expectations after reading some of the reviews over here. But the service we received was pathetic. We had to wait for over 30 mins  for the main course. We couldn't order dessert(which I really wanted to) because the waiter said we would have to wait for another 30mins. We asked our waiter the reason for such bad service and he said poor man power. The food wasn't outstanding either.

This restaurant was there on my wishlist since the day it opened.. and I finally decided to give it a try... and this place turned out to be perfect for the occasion of Valentine's day!
Ambience - beautifully done interiors and soothing background music creates a perfect ambience for a perfect date.
Food- we ordered pork ribs burrah kebab, baked fish wellington and coq au vain along with a sangria and a beer.
pork ribs were the star dish.. soft and juicy ribs with a beautiful combo of sweet and spicy sauce all around it.. tasted super awesome! The baked fish was a dish full of richness of the cheese and freshness and softness of the fish... nonspicy yet delicious and very much filling.. the coq au vain had soft medium sized chicken pieces having a lovely taste with a li'l sweetness served with an aromatic buttered rice. The sangria too was mindblowing as expected.
Prices are normal.. not too high but not low either!
And also we got an offer of 10% discount( by a lucky draw..10% was the minimum.. there were higher discount offers too!) on our next visit! Overall This new place is a must try for people in search of good food with amazing fusion dishes at affordable prices.
And I'm surely going back and explore the desserts next time!

First of all thank you team spice kraft for making our 10th anniversary so delicious and joyfull... The ambience, cooperative staffs, good music are mind blowing. We have visited many restaurents before but never have received this kind of hospitality. The food is amazing. We ordered The famous Beer can tampura fish with orange sauce, naan and kulcha, laal mas with sula chenin blanc... And last of all the valentines special dessert Chocolate molten fondant. We will definately visiting this place very soon. The BAR and Cocktail menu is one of the best at this price range. Once again a big thank you.
P.S. liked the small truck carrying salt and pepper With

Today we visited to spice kraft on our special occasion. It was quite amazing to have such an ambience. It was full romantic and decoration is too good.Hospitality was high enough than any other restaurants. The servers were polite helpful and giving suggestions very well. They asked for liking or disliking of each and every dishes separately.They too described the dish meaning and preparation.. We ordered the famous spice craft dish "beer can tempura fish" as a starter.The fish was crunchy and tasty and decorated within the beer can with cabbages. It's dip was made wd orange peel extract which tastes too good.We drankwhite wine(indian) sula chenin blanc which tastes nice. Main dish we took was" laal mash"(rajasthani) with naan and masala kulcha. Laal mash is mutton curry which is spicy and tasted good with naan and kulcha. Lastly we sweetened our taste bud with valentine's week special "warm milk& white chocolate molten fondant & dark @choco ice cream". It was so nicely decorated with love sign teaspoon and taste was superb. In the meantime we play a love wheel for our lo e percentage too! It was quite surprising and romantic ambience wd good food which attracks me to visit again to have more foods.. 
   And yesterday we repeated our visit to spice kraft once again to taste more things. We ordered sangria and daiquiri. The two contails are equally tasty. I specially liked sangria which is made of red wine with cranberry and pomegranate juices with topping apple small pieces. It's look is also great. Then we ordered coq-au-vin and shepherd's pie. Coq-au-vin was a continental dish with baked chicken and buttered rice nicely presented.. Shepherd's pie tastes awesome with bread. Cheesy lamb tastes heavenly. And lastly we tasted jack daniels swiss chocolate mousse wd petit four. It is made of liquid nitrogen and jack daniels whisky 100%.There was small four cakes wd a orange sauce. It's taste and appearance just made me love for it. Will visit more and more times......

SPICE KRAFT... :-) Aahh this place was on my wishlist since a long time.... Finally visited this place on Valentines day 2K16... :-p
Location :- Easily accessible.. Just a few steps opposite Hazra Law college...
Now as it was V day so it was a bit crowded and we had to wait for 1.5 hrs app.
But it was worthy waiting....:-p
As we entered the place we were guided to our table.... The place was well decorated and I personally loved the decor...  And each table had a truck containing pepper and salt... That was a unique idea...:-D
Now coming to the food we had 
STARTER :- 
1) BEER CAN TEMPURA FISH :- The most amazing part was it was served in a can of Budweiser... The taste was awsm... And the orange dip was just yummy a perfect match with the dish...
2) Dejaj Chermoula :- Once again it was served in an unique way... It had a smoky grilled flavour... And it was delicious..

MAIN COURSE:-

1) Lucknowi Dum Biriyani :- being a biriyani lover had to taste this... :-p and it was mouthwatering... And the portions were generous.. Sufficient for both of us...
2) Nawabi Dum ki Murg :- This was simply awsm... The meat was tender... Soft and the gravy was really lipsmacking.... Well accompanied the Biriyani.... :-)

Finally the steal of the day was V day special dessert " Dark chocolate ice cream" it was just fantabulous.... Simply treat to ur tongue..:-p
The guy who was serving very polite and well behave and courteous...
Finally on the occasion of V day there was game... Spinning the love wheel...:-p and we scored 80% so a 15% discount on our next visit... 
Hope to see u soon again...

Visited Spice Kraft for a lunch date on Valentine's Day. We reached there around 1PM, got a seat inside instantly although they said they have just opened and there may be a bit of delay for serving. Also a sweeper came to sweep the floor while we and a few other guests were already seated.
Apart from that, I liked everything in SpiceKraft. The ambiance was very good and the staff were friendly, they suggested our main course which consisted of Moon Fan and Chicken in chilly and oyster sauce.
There was a Valentine's Day special Menu from which we ordered an Egyptian starter which was a tasty chicken preparation. Also we ordered Dajaj Charmoula and Sengre Cocktail.
The food tasted great and was absolutely fresh. Overall my lunch date went very well. Will visit again.

If you're thinking uncompromisingly good food, this is your one-stop food destination! If one has a fair idea of food, he will know that the pricing is totally reasonable, the food tastes perfect with the perfect flavours, fragrances and garnishing. The staffs are well behaved, approachable and one can expect all kinds of assistance, beginning from what food to choose to all other typical services that are normally provided with. We were absolutely delighted to have the beer can tempura fish with orange tartar dip for starters, the Coq Au Vin(red wine chicken served with parsley butter rice) for a filling main course and also the Devilled crabs were outstanding. Also, this place undoubtedly has the best cocktails in town. If you're an absolute whiskey person, you should inevitably go for the Choco Beam. For romantic date nights and normal feel good evenings, Kir Royal√©(Cherry liquor..basically a comparitively sweeter, good to taste red wine) it is for you!
The outstanding ambiance and the attractive get up just adds to the brownie points. Also location wise, it is very easy to detect! So go ahead and tantalise your taste buds!

This one is a delight...a place oozing funk from the moment you step in...little details in menu styling and even the salt and pepper comes in mini truck which is delightfully fresh....let's come to the dining experience... The Beer can tempura fish is a signature fish starter, wittily served in a beer can...the sauce was an apt dipper complimenting the fish in every way...the cocktails were a touch of brilliance...we tried the Hazzelnut heaven, a sweet vodka mix with cream and a spicy Michelada beer cocktail which is nothing like I tasted before... Next came the Dajaj cha rmoula....presentation was spot on...though the chicken could have spent a lil more time in the tandoor.....the time when the Bhetki Wellington made its way to our table...we we already half full...but the dish was a subtle pleasure to our pallate...and we ended our lunch as two satisfied foodies... This may have been my 1st time in this eatery...but I can promise that it won't be the last :-)
As promised, visited the restaurant 2nd time...and again the experience was worth to write about. The pork roast chilly was cooked to perfection... Soft,moist yet crispy on the surface... The Octopus in salt and pepper was a delight in the sticky soya reduction... The chicken in human sauce was light and refreshing....the Moon Faan Rice and Noodles was served in a generous quantity which is always a satisfying sight for any Bengali family ;-)... The downside was the pork Thai dish which spent a bit more in the kitchen...the pork being a bit under... And the noodles would have been ok of it were served as Street food with fresh onions and cabbage.... But I guess it would be cruel to judge the quality of noodles with that of other Chinese greats in the city...the DNA of this restaurant is made of something far diverse... All in all Keep Up The Good Work Guys...

Based on all the good reviews about this new restaurant in town, we decided to drop by here for a couple of cocktails on the go. Honestly, we were quite disappointed! 

Firstly,the service was extremely poor and I found this so hard to believe after having read such good reviews about the staff and their hospitality. Well, I wouldn't say they were impolite but we did feel unattended to! I had to  ask them four times in half an hour to take away the used glasses of the previous customers at our table. And then we waited another ten minutes until the fresh glasses were filled and somebody bothered to take the orders. The restaurant was not even full at the time and nothing at all explains or excuses such inefficiency! 

We went for a couple of Long Island Iced Teas, Manhattan and Daiquiri among cocktails, among which the LIIT was the worst I've tasted in town! The Manhattan however was good!

The real disappointment was the quantity of their food. We ordered for the Beer Can Tempura Fish which seems to be a hit here,and justly so! We had no complains! However, the "Hoisin Torched Pork Osso Buco,roasted pineapples and hollandaise mash(China)" which was available under the Valentine's Special Menu served just two pieces of pork for Rs.325! The pork was well cooked yes but it's in no way as alluring as its name suggests! Finally, the Khor Khog which was a lamb dish was really tasty but the issue still remained with the quantity! Sad. Very sad.

Been dying to visit this place ever since it opened up finally made it on 13th feb, 2016 for lunch. Having already read the rave reviews and recommendations this place received , I had high hopes. 

Ambiance : Suited to fine dining. It is quite big in seating capacity and they have 3 different sections of seating. Really well done interiors and seating arrangements. Quite liked how the wine bottles in the glass cabinet were put for display. 

Food : We ordered a mixed sauce pasta and a dish which is made up of kela dish banana leaves, pineapple and potato (the staff will tell you the name as it's one of their specialities). One must try the kela dish. It's is really done well and melts in your mouth giving you tastes of all the flavours. Food is overall pretty good. 

Drinks : We ordered a Manhattan which is a whiskey based cocktail and a mock tail. The drinks were done well and you could taste all the flavours from whiskey to pineapple. 

Staff service : They staff were extremely well behaved, courteous and it was a treat seeing such interactive and well behaved staff which a lot of posh resteraunts lack. They will come up with suggestions and recommendations. 

Service time : Poor. Really slow. The one of the two areas I disliked. Drinks and the food took 20 to 30 minutes at least. Need to gear up the preparation time. 

Hygiene : Overall hygiene is good. How ever, the toilets are dirty and wet. Management should really set up in this area if they want to continue to maintain their name and brand. 

Pocket pinch : Two drinks. Too food items. 900 for two.  I would say. Pretty cheap. 

Over all : Recommended for fine dining with family or brining a date.

After 2,3 failed attempts, finally visited Spice Kraft a month ago. I am bit late in writing a review for this place but I guess better late than never !
Well, this place is a nicely done one. I loved the food and the cocktails. The food tasted yum and the Jim Beam cocktail was absolutely perfect to taste!
The only thing which I didn't like is that we had to wait for 40 minutes even aftr having a reservation. I really hope they work a bit on their management. All in all, this is another place in town where I would like to go again and again for some good food and cheap cocktails.

The first thing to mention about this place is its decor & the ambience with soothing music.  We took a table for two.. it was well decorated.. We were delighted to get the kind of place, ambience, service, with food variations.. just the way we wanted to spend our evening with.. Our menu for the day was - 
The Mango Driver, Choco Beam,Dajaj Chermoula(starters)  
Devilled Crab Meat, Pan Fried Chilli Fish, Shepherd's Pie(Main course)
As this is the Valentine month.. Hence the interior was nicely decorated with red heart shaped balloons.. One of the person.. who made our day, with his dedicated customer service is Mr.Vimal Nag(Manager) he left no stone unturned to give us the kind of service we were expecting.. His recommended dish as a starter was mouth watering üòã and when we gave him our mixed feedback about the food he was really courteous and he served us a complimentary chicken dish..and that worked as 'Icing on the cake...' This is a very nice place to visit with family n friends.. And if u like to experiment with different dishes...This place is the right choice for u.. 
Hope to visit very soon!! To try new dishes.. 
Keep the good service going..

I am beginning to have my concern around the reviews and ratings on Zomato. This particular place receives rave reviews and yet the menu as well as presentation is so run-of-the-mill that it can only result in a humdrum food experience.¬†

We ordered the Beer Can Tempura Fish; Devilled Crab Meat; Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab and the Orange Glazed Honey Tossed Noodles was for dessert.

Any tempura dish has a particular palate - the batter and deep fry ensures that the oil needs to be balanced. The dish was not over-fried - as it should be. However, the novelty of the batter and presentation wears off fast along with the sauce. The heavy and not creamy consistency of the orange sauce tends to clash instead of complement. I am peculiarly surprised to see this as a crowd pleasing item. I'll readily recommend that you stay away from the Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab if you like either of those (Pork Ribs or, Burrah Kebab). The tamarind drip provides an interesting contrasting base but the fusion of ribs and kebab do not work. Firstly, the cuts presented would not pass muster as decent ribs of any sort. Also, I am not sure if these are marinated (which they have to be for the Kebab like taste) or, go through the rub-and-sauce. I prefer ribs to be classic - tenderised meat off the bones put through a good rub-and-sauce (fennel, paprika and thyme is a great combination) that has given time to caramelize. I didn't find this and the dish is a great attempt but a greater disappointment. More tweaking would be needed. The devilled crab has a mac-n-cheese taste - going easy on the cheese and probably checking the variety used might improve the dish.

The interiors are well done and have great light during the day. The tables are a bit too close, but that's how things seem to be at Kolkata. The wait staff need to be a bit more attentive - for a table that did not order any drinks except water, going without water refills for half an hour is really awkward. Also, the insistence on "Jack Daniels mousse" as the only dessert to have is somewhat not appreciated - if you have a dessert menu, provide a recommendation and let your patrons select. Since it is somewhat easy to mess up a liqueur mousse, we didn't opt for that Jack Daniels one.Interestingly, the staff directed two patrons to outside the restaurant as a smoking zone. Since the outside is a public space - a pedestrian footpath, I wonder if this is really something the restaurant should be encouraging. I thought Kolkata had given in to smoking restrictions at public spaces.

The place is good. The waiters are great but the manager is a douche. There was a fly in our food and he says that particular part of the food is for garnishing and it is a small fly and it's absolutely ok to have them around. Otherwise the food is good, especially the variety of continental dishes. Will definitely like to visit again if it gets rid of such stupid staffs.

Smooth through the throat and easy on the pocket.
We had an amazing time last night. Started with cocktails and starters (baby corn and tangri) and moved onto whisky, Budweiser and Heineken. We wrapped up with dinner which included butter nan, butter tandoori roti along with lucknowi paneer and punjabi chicken.
Cocktails were decent enough for the shocking price of a mocktail in most so called popular popular pubs. Hope they keep the price reasonable for sometime and not increase much.

This is a hidden gem on Hazra road. The ambience, music and everything else is very soothing and the people here are very welcoming and well behaved. The service is also very good and prompt. Although beers are bit costly, the cocktails are marvelous. I have tasted in my last few visits - sangria, blue electric, margarita, etc. All of these are excellent yet not overpriced! I recommend everyone else here to visit this place sometimes and enjoy the cocktails served here!

We had a reason to celebrate.. No not rose or chocolate day... It was to celebrate our (me and my bestie) new job offer.. We believe celebration should be with great food. And hence after loads of research of " Zara hatke type" food.. We chose Spicekraft..Though we had to travel more than 25 kms from our residence, its was completely worthy.
The ambiance was extraordinarily romantic with blueish and yellowish lights and a soothing music at the back end..never the less than a 5star lounge. The menu card is probably the best one I have ever seen.
Food... Very innovative and magnificent platting.. Perfect presentation.
Taste of the dishes were picture perfect.. The dips for the starters were out if the box. The Tempura beer batter fish and the Dajaj Charmoula which is a Labenese dish, were so perfectly moulded with amazing flavours.
Along with the started we ordered for 3 cocktails.. Hazel nut, kala khatta and berry flavour.. Outstanding...
We only tried the exotic items like tuna.. Devilled Crab..Baby octopus salt pepper..squids.. I loved the crab and the tuna preparation and presentation.
We were absolutely filled with the starters and the exotic dishes that we didn't go for the main course items. But planning to visit it again to try the rest of the items.. Mainly the main course.
The staffs were very humble..the Manager in charge Mr. Nag was very closely monitoring our requirements.. There was a small glitch where one of our cocktail got exchanged with another table..but without much confusion it was rectified..
The head chef walked up to us to take our feedback on the taste and quality of food. This was a good gesture...
Just loved this place.. Planning for another visit shortly !

Spice kraft is for food lovers.. I enjoyed all the delicacies that was served on the plate. Bear can fish one of its kind with an amazing taste. The fish simply melts in your mouth.  Lebanese chicken was delicious. We had limited option with the food as the worker's at the place met some accident and they had less number of people to do the service. Still they served us the best of all. Best part was when chef himself came up and suggested us few dishes and we were glad to ear them. I would like to go to this place again to try other dishes as well. Not to forget the dessert monte carlo was amazing.

Well, we came to Spice Kraft as a family of four, me, mom, my elder sister, and dad. It was my mom's birthday that day, 27th of December, Sunday and as always a merry day. The uncle who took our order kept coming and asking sweetly whether we liked the dish or not and he also interacted with us.

We ordered :-

Beer Can Tempura Fish - Lovely well battered fish with a yum orange sauce on the side served in a Budweiser's beer can along with coleslaw

Squid Rings in Butter Garlic - Squid rings cooked in a tangy sauce with red onion jam and buttery garlic tossed in veggies. Well I also licked the plate clean

Lymwn Samak - Soft melt in mouth fish cooked in a delish marinade with a slight citrusy tang.

Chilly Garlic Noodles - Green noodles I think were good too

Baked Fish Wellington - Two medium to large size fish fillets cooked in white sauce served alongside three mushrooms and herb rice.

Drunken Petit Fours -Stylishly presented, it was nice

Chocolate Crepes with Mascarpone Cheese - Honestly it was ice cream instead of mascarpone cheese. Christmas special. Crepe was slightly hard. It was okay.

Well review by category :-

Ambience - 4.5
Decor - 3.5 - 4
Service - a little late so it'll be 4
Price - 4
Taste - 5

Well I'd like to conclude my review by saying that outside decor could have been better because it doesn't make it look as if it is a 5 star restaurant with many articles and reviews by t2. But then taste is what matters so I gave it a 5. I could show the photos but I couldn't at this moment.
We are sure to visit again !!

This restaurant was on top of my bucket list for 2016!!!
Finally got to visit it on a Monday evening for dinner...

Ambience : It was dimly lit but nevertheless sets the mood for the entire evening to come..They have a section of the wall showcasing their collection of champagnes and wines...

Cocktails : Hammerjack is a must try if you like a strong alcoholic drink!!I tried their molecular infusion as well...it was on the mild side but liked the Captain Morgan+Smoked Guava.

Starters : We ordered¬†

Tempura Beer batter fried fish-It is a must try dish since it's coated in beer batter unlike most of the restaurants which use bread crumbs.

Soy Braised Drums of Heaven,Old Monk flambe-Even though I liked the flavour,it should not be ordered if someone has an aversion to alcohol!!!Since the flavour of Old Monk is prominent.

Devilled Crabs-My all time favourite...crabmeat was prepared in a cheesy based sauce.Loved the flavours!!

Baby octopus Salt and Pepper-The octopus was a dissapointment!!!It was overcooked and chewy...

Main course consisted of only Coq-Au-Vin-It was chicken cooked in red wine accompanied with rice...This seemed to be another version of Chicken Alexander Supreme...A revision of the former...But tasted good..

Chef Shambit(Pardon my spelling) was gracious enough to come and ask for our feedback...Loved the hospitality of the staff!!!

Looking forward to visiting this place again and order the Jack Daniel's chocolate mousse!!!

The place is very easy to locate, a few seconds walk from ballygunge phari petroleum just opp the hazra law college.   Yesterday i visited this place and am in love with it !! first of all the ambience inside the door is a perfect romantic setting with good music in the background which gives a mood to spend dinner time with your special someone at the same time one can have family dinner . I specially liked the printed truck on each table which carries salt, pepper. Now for the starter we ordered beer can tempura fish as the new hit of the spice kraft is that, along with 3 cocktail combos ( litchitini, classic cosmopolitan and blue electra are what we chose). After that we ordered coq-au-vin and later two masala kulchas and a laccha paratha along with gustaba (a kashmiri mutton dish, muttin kofta kind off) and murg-da-mukul ( a punjabi shredded chicken dish). All the dishes are made perfectly and lipsmacking. We were too full to go for desserts so we ended our meal here. Next time we want to have their 100% jack Daniel's mousse .

A very nicely decorated restaurant located near ballygunge phari. The ambience is very much romantic with dim lights and music.
Well I went there for dinner and ordered Soy braised drums of heaven, old monk flambe (in simple words chicken drumsticks tossed in old monk), Nasi Goreng {it is actually a kind of fried rice and it is the national dish of Indonesia served from roadside stalls to 5 star hotels} and Roasted Pork in Rendang sauce.
And along with this a combo of 3 large pegs of black dog.
And yes the food tastes very good.

The cocktails here are phenomenal. Not only was there a huge range of them to pick from, each of them tasted as interesting as the previous one. Also, while they focus on taste, the amount of alcohol added to each of them is pretty generous, so don't get too carried away with need to taste too many of them. :)

Cant wait to go back.

The food was seriously good, the service was even better and on the price front too these guys score quite high.
The food that we had was fresh especially the baby octopus. The orange peel chicken was refreshingly tangy and the 100% Jack Daniels ice cream was simply great.
I would seriously urge people to go and check this place out.

Visited this place last week with my wife . Wonderful presentations of each and every item .... We always have veg food and out here veg delicacies were simply mouthwatering especial mention of the Safed Daal Muradabaadi which was in fact suggested by their Manager Mr. Somnath ... Fantastic behavior of all out there !!! Would definitely visit Spice Kraft asap...

The food was good but the service took too long to deliver the food which was not hot. The drinks were all not so well. Molecular infusions were normal. And again the service was poor. Took around 30-40 mins to bring the drinks.

This restaurant had a¬†very nice and colourful ambience, the service and hospitality were good and the pocket pinch was on the lower side.

Their staff attended to us well and the dishes we had were served in good portions and all of them tasted very good. They have quite an elaborate menu with items from different places.

We had a starter with the name "kele-ke-phool" and it was something different and delicious, "khao tay" which was again something different we had.
They served us the vegetarian version of "Moon Faan" which was a fragrant rice, and also tasted really good.

For the breads, we tried their "Zaffrani Sheermal" which was kind of a sweet bread and again very good.

We also loved their Boozert Mousse, i.e. 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate.

The overall experience at Spice Kraft was very nice where we got to have some new kind of dishes which are not served elsewhere in Kolkata, and the pocket pinch was also not very high.! I shall be looking forward to visiting the place again.!

I would call this place a find, in brief, five star food at budget prices.The only drawback is the cramped sitting area.The Alcohol menu is good and the stuff was thankfully undiluted.Go for it foodies, worth a try.

I came to know about this place by exploring zomato and it was in my wishlist for quite a few months and at last went to Spice Kraft yesterday.The whole menu including the cocktails are a bit hatke from any regular bar cum restaurants and I truely loved it.Not only the menu,the way they present each and every dishes is also very unique.
We went there in the evening and we were not at all ready for dinner.So we had cocktails and some light starters.In drinks we had Milk Maid Chaitini and Hazelnut Heaven.The second one was good.For starters,we took Beer can Tempura fish which comes inside a beer can,the presentation is really fascinating,and Hong Shao Rou,its roasted chilli pork in oyster & Hoisin sauce and it tastes really good.
The price is reasonable and it also has a great ambience.Perfect place for an evening get together.

In Kolkata you very rarely get an opportunity to talk to the chef while you have your food. Sambit here is not only the chef but the owner himself. He is an XLRI MBA but his passion for food has pulled him into this business. Although he is a learned person on food technology from Global universities , his passion for food is helping him to create excellence. The restaurant is only 3 months old.His team has met with a serious accident which has forced him to work on a truncated menu. But I can tell you Sambit has started writing an excellent story even with his truncated menu. If you are a foodie you should not have any hesitation to decide on this place. The menu is so unique you will want to have everything. But the with good guidance from Bikash ( one of the staff ) I could finally decide on my 15th anniversary dinner.

Started with Dajaj Chemola a chicken dish with a subtle taste and a great presentation. The  yogurt that comes with it is heavenly. Next came the Beer Can Tempura Fish with Orange Ponzu Tartar. This is battered fish which is the best I have ever had. Next came the Hong Shau Rou which is an innovative chilli pork and is simply out of the world. All these starters was accompanied by gorgeous cocktail and mocktails . Such an elaborate menu of mocktail or cocktail are rare. I tried  2 different types one with the Vodka named The Jamun Mary and the other with the beer Michelada. Both of them are excellent. My family tried The Lichitini a Lichi Vodka drink and mocktail name Kiwi Mango Collins. Both of them were delightful. Finally we came to the main course. We had Lobster Thermidor . It tastes excellent. Don‚Äôt expect a giant Lobster as it cannot be served at 350 bucks. It is still a must try for everybody visiting the place. We also had Coq-Au-Vin which chicken mushroom dish. If you like continental cuisine you will simply love it.

Although the entrance is not very dramatic , it is located conveniently. If you want good food , a homely atmosphere and want to meet a passionate man who is creating magic visit this place. You will come back many times. Don‚Äôt forget to thank me then.

It has been quite some time I went to Spicekraft. Due to my busy schedule I rarely open Zomato and write reviews about the restaurants I visited. Let me know you Spicekraft deserves full marks for its food and the extremely courteous staffs. Fairly speaking, I've been to lots of restaurants, where hospitality is top notch but here these guys will make you feel really comfortable with the politeness in their behaviour.
‚Ä¢
It was one fine mid-day when me and my partner decided to try out Spicekraft, which is located at a stone's throw from Ballygunge Phari, towards Hazra.
‚Ä¢
The interiors look really nice and the attention grabbing things like the small truck carrying the spices and the purple colored menu bar are superb detailed touches. I just loved the showcases with wine bottles showcased in them.
‚Ä¢
Let's talk about the delicacies of Spicekraft now. There are varieties of dishes to choose from this place. The waiter suggested we should try out something different, known as the Dajaj Charmoula which is a Lebanese starter. A chicken dish marinated with charmoula spices and char grilled. Basically a fusion of chicken drumsticks & innovation of the chef, it is served with cucumber and a small wooden plank. It is so tender & juicy it melts in your mouth. Loved it to the core.
‚Ä¢
We ordered two mocktails after that.
The rainbow mocktail - This looks great & tastes soothing too. It is a blend of granadine, lime, orange, blue curacao and soda. Great thirst quencher.
Tangarita - A cool mocktail with a spicy and hot punch. This drink gave us a different experience altogether. Orange juice and pineapple juice are infused with club soda and with some hot green chillies. A bit tangy, a bit sweet and most importantly the chillies add a smacking taste to this awesome drink.
Both the mocktails were too good.
‚Ä¢
Next one was simply my favourite one. Murgh Kothmiri Kebab. One of the best Kebabs we had ever. These morsels of chicken are kebabs marinated in green chillies and coriander with various other ingredients. A mind-blowing combination and healthy kebab to gorge on.
‚Ä¢
In the main course the Chef himself came and suggested us the Gushtaba. The Chef is very charming and cooperates in the best way that you can expect. We ordered Kotthu Porotta along with delicious Pudina Laccha Parathas as the Chef suggested but sadly the Kotthu Porottas were not available that day for some reason. Therefore the waiter came along and suggested us that the Pudina Laccha Parathas will go well with the Gushtaba. Gushtaba is something I had for the first time. A delicious Kashmiri dish of Mutton, which is minced into round meatballs and cooked in a creamy almond gravy. The gravy is something that goes well with the crispy & perfect Pudina Laccha Parathas. Neither too spicy not too dull, the mutton roundels are moreish and tender with the sweet gravy. It was really good to completely make our tummy full but I somewhat didn't enjoy it like the previous dishes.
‚Ä¢
A lunch or a brunch is simply ot complete without having a dessert. Therefore we ordered Classic Monte Carlo that came in a small glass along with two spoons. This moreish dessert is a stellar way to end a hefty meal. The classic Monte Carlo offered by SpiceKraft, did its job pretty well to fulfill our dessert cravings. It was good with lots of chocolate and whipped cream icing and a hint of strawberry flavour within it.
‚Ä¢
Spice Kraft is a brilliant restaurant with some exotic delicacies on their menu. Everything from the food to the etiquette of the staffs and specially the Chef were simply outstanding. The only thing that could have been a bit better is the service. Pricing is good and remember this is only a casual-dining restaurant where you get superb hospitality. Thumbs up from me. Going back soon.

The last time I went to a new restaurant after going through its avg score from the reviews on Zomato, I was rather disappointed. Needless to say was a lil sceptic before visiting this restaurant. But after visiting this restaurant, I'm delighted that I insisted on going to this place against my friend's wish. Located close to the Ballygunge Petrol pump near Ballygunje Phari , it's not difficult to locate. The place serves almost 25-30 people at a time. Cocktails are specifically served in the inner room. We just wanted to eat food only to our heart's content so sat outside. The ambience will catch your attention once you enter into the restaurant. The staff were courteous, helpful and were on time for taking the orders. For starters, we ordered Beer can Tempura fish, Pork ribs burrah kebab and Devilled crab meat. Food was served after ten minutes or so. Tempura fish was served at first. The presentation of the dish will definitely intrigue you at first. Served with a budweiser beer can filled with lettuce finely chopped, the Tempura fish was absolutely delicious to taste. Next to come was pork ribs burrah kebaab. The appearance was that of charred meat but the taste was absolutely heavenly. But I absolutely loved the Devilled crab meat. Served inside a shell it was the stand out starter of the the lot. It was well seasoned, visually stunning to look at and melted perfectly. For main course we ordered chilly garlic chicken haka noodles which was okay. For desserts, we went for Jack Daniels Chocolate mousse which was heavenly. Just the perfect blend of the sourness of the Daniels and the sweetness of the chocolate. In the meantime, the chef came and introduced himself to us. It cost us 1350 rupees for this delightful food experience so this restaurant is also  budget friendly. We didn't try the cocktails but I'm sure next time we're going to try them.

Spice Kraft - Came as a disaster.
=====
Intro + Location: Located very near to ballygunge phari. To be more precise, near to Hazra Law college.

I had been hearing really good reviews about this place but was very badly disappointed when i came here for a visit. I also had a talk with the Chef regarding this and he encapsulated for the disappointment. It was a bad day for him as his few staffs had an injury due to accident and that had been causing a bit of improper management in running the restaurant. I had visited this place with my brother and a couple of few friends. The ambiance of the place is good and also the vehicle kept on table for storing salt and pepper. However, i was really disappointed with the food and hospitality. My friend told me that the a la carte got changed recently and so forth, we went on ordering from the newly made a la carte.
=====
Beverages and Food ordered:-

We ordered Beverages from their list of Molecular Gastronomy:-

‚Ä¢ Pineapple Cocktail

‚Ä¢ Guava Cocktail

Both the cocktails did taste fine but the masalas were added in more than adequate quantities. I personally felt it took away the charm of the drink.

The punch of the vodka, gin etc etc. was perfect.

Starters:-

‚Ä¢ On recommendation of their staff, we placed the order for chicken kebab. It looked like lollipop with a taste of tandoor. The presentation of the chicken was good but the taste felt ordinary to me. I even found the portions small with respect to the price charged and even the chicken was not so hot as it should be.¬†

‚Ä¢ Mahi Malai Kebab - It was good. The fish was hot and mouth melting. ¬†‚úå

‚Ä¢ We ordered for a veg starter for one of our vegetarian friend. It was subz ki galawat. Tasted good and is a good option for the vegetarians. ‚úå

Main Course:-

The main course was a big DISASTER. I agree indian food is creamy but within two or three bites, we were almost feeling very heavy on stomach. Plus few dishes did not taste good too and was served cold. To my knowledge, it was over creamy. We ordered:-

‚Ä¢ Dal Moradabadi - It was different but then, taste was not enjoyable.

‚Ä¢ Dal Makhni - It tasted good. ‚úå

‚Ä¢ Nawabi Dum Ki paneer - We ordered as it was mentioned in their menu. Was a DISASTER as it was filled with biryani masala. My vegetarian friend hated this preparation and so did i. It was not up to the mark.¬†

‚Ä¢ Murg da Mokul - As recommended by the staff, the chicken would have been spicy. It was very sweet. We complained for it to the Chef and it was really appreciable of him to provide us with a spicier version of the same.

Most of these dishes were presented well but were not served smoky hot. I personally found the food to be over priced as there was no proper service, the food was served cold and the portions were low etc etc.¬†
=====
Meal for us: We were 5 and it costed us around 2.5 k which i found to be a waste.¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Location is excellent.
‚Ä¢ Ambience is good.
‚Ä¢ Food presentation is good.¬†

Cons:
(With what happened when i went there)
‚Ä¢ Pocket pinching.
‚Ä¢ Bad service.
‚Ä¢ Food was not being served hot.¬†
‚Ä¢ Crockery's were being mismanaged and served with delay.¬†
‚Ä¢ Despite changing the dish, our whole experience turned down.¬†
=====
Summary:

Ambiance 3.7/5
Food Presentation 3.8/5
Food Quality 2.8/5
Food Taste 2.8/5
Hygiene 3.6/5
Hospitality 3.3/5
Value for money 2/5
=====
Conclusion:

Really badly disappointed.
My whole expectation of this place turned DOWN after the kind of experience i had here. However, i really appreciate the Chef's effort on visiting each and every table and addressing their issues. As a customer, if i am paying some money, there should be a value for money. I had visited this place first time and i was not really very satisfied. I would visit this place in future ONLY on special request after having such a terrible experience and having my pocket burnt.

How do you describe a place that leaves your taste buds in a state of utter delight?? 
Finally visited this place after rave reviews from friends... And it is not often that one can say that reality exceeded expectations. But such is the case. 
The ambience and decor is sure to impress right from the moment you step in. Cosy and comfortable, with soothing music in the background(excellent music choice). We had an abridged menu as some of their staff members had met with a mishap.
We tried the kele ke phool ke croque monsieur, coq au vin and lobster thermidor. The food was visually stunning and delicious. Perfectly seasoned, well balanced and delectable. 
For dessert we tried the 100% Jack Daniels chocolate mousse. It was heavenly. Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness. 
For drinks we had the sangria and cool cucumber. Well mixed and quite strong.
Definitely going back to try the full menu. 
And guys... Get well soon.

Well it was a weekday evening when we ended up going to this newly opened place. Near Ballygunge Phari, locating it is not a big deal. But there is nothing that's remarkable or outstanding here. You ll get lights from here and there when you are in the family section. Whereas the stags section looked nice with blue lights (although more chaotic). Decor is good, but can we not have little less illumination:P Coming to food, it's absolutely average. Although they have varieties, but taste wise okayish. Yeah they do have interesting range of cocktails. As per their suggestion, we ordered 2 of their signature cocktails. But unfortunately we didn't like! Ultimately we went for Manhattan and LIIT. 
Overall it's a one time visit! However better decor, food quality, happy hours would pull crowd! :)

Been there with a friend :) The experience was excellent. In food must try out ¬†Dajaj Charmoula, Beer Can Tempura Fish. Its a must must must. It tasted awesome. Both items were soft. Almost melted in mouth. In drinks we tried a shot of tequilla each and two glasses of LIIT. LIIT was one of the best I had in the city. Two glasses were enough to make u dizzy. Everything was nicely decorated and presented. Its absolutely value for money place. I didn't feel it was overpriced. Two starters, 2 shots, 4 LIIT was around 2K. Only red flag I had with the place was service! The service was slow. Once I had to get up and remind them about the order. Otherwise more than once visit place :)

Having heard abt this place from a close friend , i and my group decided to meet up at this place on 25th dec christmas night. I was aware that most places in kolkata would be crowded on that night so i gave this place a visit in the afternoon to have a table reserved since my office is nearby, they greeted me in a nice way and agreed to keep a table booked , when we reached and saw the place was almost full , i thot maybe they wldnt have kept the table reserved since we were roughly 25 mins late bt to my surprise my chosen table was reserved and that was the 1st nice impression they had on us coz u cant expect too much on a festive day. 2ndly i didnt know my friend knew the head chef out thr , we ordrd many things all suggested by the chef himself and all the dishes we had were outstanding. The pork was nice and soft , we also had beer batter temp fish , stonganoff , squid rings and drink combos. overall the place is totally worth it , ambience is good , food is awesome and above all its pocket friendly. Now i am a weekly visitor and i would also suggest others its a must visit place. am sure u wont b disappointed. keep it up ....

Just visited this place the other day, beautiful lighting, very warm staff, extremely affordable for the quality of food and service.

Would like it more if the menu served a little more choices in meat, the sea food dominates the menu. Overall a beautiful place to go, good to see new places growing in Kolkata. :)

Food is not just what you taste with your tongue but it is something which is meant to trigger all your senses..In a way being Hungry is to contantly experiement with your taste buds,search for new avenues and at the same time enrich your experience and your perception to bridge the gap between Food and Art..
Well Spice Kraft is such a place..which will excite the inquisitive foodie inside you..make you fall in love with its flavours and at the same time applaud Cullinary Art as a Creative Form of supreme order..
Visited there last week with a couple of friends..Located close to the legendary Kwality restaurant in Ballygunge Phari..The restaurant is divided into 3 separate rooms and we were given a nice,warm couch in their Stag section..Well personally I felt the rooms are a bit stuffy and had there been no compartmentalisation this place would have looked much better..There is a classy feel to the decor but never like the dim blue lighting in the Stag room..The servers seemed to be totally out of place, inexperienced, in fact they dropped the cutleries a few time..Also initially they were taking a bit too long to serve the starters..
However owing to an accident to some of their staffs they were serving just an abridged version of their menu..No Deserts were available and molecular creation was also less in number..
Coming to food we ordered:
Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab: Heavenly!!!Totally fallen in love with this dish,so much that we had to order a second portion..Never had pork so soft,succulent and tasty..not much fat,excatly how I prefer and charred beautifully with a smoky texture..Passionately Recommended..
Murgh Zarka Tikka: Chicken cubes marinated in whole ground spices and lots of chillies..loved the punch and the heat in the dish..
Red Pepper Prawns: Can't go wrong on this..good old preparation, perfect with your drinks..6 pieces,the prawns were fresh and the size was quite generous given the price they are charging..
Lobster Thermidor: Splendid, must applaud the presentation..sumptuous..Also serving Lobster at just 395/- accompanied by Veggies and Butter Rice was jaw-dropping..The lobster was creamy and cheesy but for me the focal point of the dish was the Butter Rice..I won't be exxagerating if I say this is the best butter rice I have ever tasted..never knew even a naive-looking rice can taste so gorgeous..Passionately Recommended..
Alongwith the food we ordered 4 large White Rum, 2 LIIT and 2 Manhattan.. Personally I don't think any other joint serves LIIT at a meager rate of 275/-..initially we were skeptical but it turned out to be just perfect..
Overall I am already craving to back soon to try out their DESERT and other interesting blend of flavours and there lies the USP of this place alongwith the aesthetic presentation of the dishes..
Our total cheque comes to Rs.3637/-(all incl) for F&B for 3 people..
Food: 5/5
Pricing: 4.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

One of the new hotspots of the town which makes molecular gastronomy and experimental cuisine oh so affordable! We had gone there with the aim to try as many recommended dishes as possible, and we managed to do that at a very reasonable rate. We ordered three entrees- 
1. Dajaj Chermoula (a Lebanese preparation of chicken drumsticks which tasted no less than heaven)
2. Beer Batter Tempura Fish (which was served in a very innovative way in a beer can)
3. Hong Shau Rou (a Chinese pork dish which I loved! )
Now coming to Mains, we ordered
4. Coq- Au- Vin (Buttery rice with chicken pieces, tasted a lot like the much loved Chelo Kebab from Peter Cat)
5. Roast Pork in Rendang curry with Moon Fan rice (awesome as expected)
6. Baked Fish Wellington
Now we came to desserts 
7. Classic Monte Carlo (we were kindly offered five candy canes instead of the usual two :p )
8. 100% Jack Daniels Mousse (with Petit Fours to neutralise the flavour)
The best part came when the chef himself came out to inquire after our experience, and he was very happy when we complimented him. This is a place everyone in the city must visit atleast once! :)

So, finally the ballygunj gets a restaurant to talk about too. This locality badly needed one this kind of outlet just in case you dont want to visit Quest mall and burn your pocket. First thing first, they have done a really exemplary job while turning around the silver oak that were there earlier and re modelling it in quite sophisticated place as we experienced in Spice kraft.

Location: Bang opposite Hazra law collage, near ballygung phari

Menu: we heard a lot about the menu. like one of the few places serving molecular cocktails and mocktails. Chef has done a pretty good job while creating an experimental menu around world cuisine which is quite pleasant to palate at the same time prices are also economical.¬†

Moving on, while celebrating one of our office colleague birthday, after a lot of suggestion and counter suggestion we zeroed on this place.
It was a Friday afternoon and there were a couple of tables occupied. we were told that they have different sections for stags, couples and groups and we were given a little PDR Kind of area. Ambience was elegant and table layouts were done in pretty decent manner. really liked the idea of small truck miniature carrying salt and pepper on it.

for starters we ordered a thai potato, chilli fish and jullins of fried chicken. service time was good and food arrived within the time. we really enjoyed the thai potato and chilli fish. seemed tailor made for our taste buds.

For main course, we stuck to Fish hunan style, fried rice, chilli garlic noodles and chilli paneer. the main course was little delayed. we knocked them for a couple of times and they said that kitchen is short staffed. service was prompt and everything was served around. the team members were pleasant and were suggesting their specials as and when asked. the one thing they suggested but we couldnt try was beer batter tempura fish which they said is their signature preparation.

i wouldnt deny that we had a very limited time for today's lunch but surely going to hit the pace to try some of the talked about dishes..

all the best to entire team. definitely deserves another outing. super soon...

This is a wonderful place full of good food,  wonderful drinks and an even better host.  Went there for a close friend's birthday and boy did they make sure this was a night to remember.  Their signature starters were sumptuous. Specially loved the main of grilled fish. A special mention about their drinks. ..best cocktails in town!  
The only thing they can now focus on is to rev up the decor.  Otherwise it's a must visit for every foodie in town.

Having randomly walked in here for a casual Sunday brunch, I was more than delighted! It has a pretty little happy d√©cor and an elaborate yet meticulous menu. I loved their innovative cocktail collection and tried the Hammer Jack (a take on LIIT), Utterly Butterly Jameson and a Cocum Margarita all of which were so palatable that you could literally chug them down. The chef and owner, Sambit, has definitely done a great deal of work and gastronomical experiments to come up with such a fine alcohol and food menu. For starters, we ordered the beer can tempura fish with an orange ponzu dip and Hong Sho Rou ( shredded chilli pork).  The fish was beautifully flavored and the batter extremely light and crispy just like tempura batters should be. The pork was pretty awesome too and what stood out for me was the light char grilled yet crispy touch it had which goes to show that they definitely upped their game from the normal ever-so-popular "chilli pork". Even the orange ponzu dip was so great that I just HAD to shamelessly ask for a refill!
For mains we ordered Laccha Paratha and the Laal Maas, and though the Laal Maas was probably not as authentic to the T, it definitely was a perfect weave of flavors! The mutton was fall-off-the-bone tender and the gravy, rich yet subtly flavored without any spice overpowering the other.
Coming to the service, it was brilliant again, with the owner, visiting each table and trying to make sure all of us were satisfied. 
Having visited many of these new food joints which have mushroomed up suddenly in Kolkata, I must say, Spicekraft delivers and how! All restaurants may satiate your hunger, but a very few satisfy the soul. Spicekraft, definitely does both! :)

This was my first go to place after returning from Pondicherry. Fairly easy to locate, it's got a beautifully subtle ambience. As soon as we entered, we were greeted very warmly and that was really nice. The service was very fast and prompt, indeed one of the best I've experienced so far. The menu offers a variety of delicacies all from different genres of food. As for us, we started off with the squid in garlic sauce which was brilliant. It was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was marvelous. It was the exact melt in your mouth sea food dish that we expected. Then we had cheese naan and a side of chicken. The curry was delicious with the perfect hotness and flavor. The naan was soft and cheesy and was not at all chewy. The presentation of the dishes was very pretty as well. For dessert we ordered their patent boozert of jack Daniels and trust me, it was hands down the best dessert I ever tasted in Kolkata. The jelly was sweet with the perfect tang, the petite cakes were soft and moist and the JD chocolate side was just the oomph factor that the meal needed.
Also, their range of alcoholic beverages are huge and in really reasonable prices.
All in all, this was the perfect start to the stay in my hometown and it was worth every penny and worth every second.
A must go for all food lovers !!

Spice Kraft has an ambience which suits hangouts with either family or friends. This is something which is very uncommon with other restaurants.
Coming to price, be it alcohol or food, it is definitely economical as compared to many other big restaurants in Kolkata.
Food items are very well cooked and well served. Baked fish wellington and devilled crab meat are the items every foodie must try out.
Another good thing about the restaurant-the assistants suggest their best dishes to the customers which eventually end up being very delicious and value-for-money.
All-in-all, a satisfying experience.

Went there last wednesday for celebrating my friend's birthday and was mesmerised by the atmosphere. I would defininately recomend the cocktails the place has to provide for example action 20000, hammerjack, sangria and hazlenut heaven among many. And do try the Indian delicacies.... I was very pleased with the hospitality and would really love to go there again.

I was very excited to visit this restaurant today after reading much about it here and the food they served lived upto my expectations. The devilled crab, lobster thermidor, coq au vin each and everything was very very tasty.
The pork ribs burrah kebab was unique in taste and cooked exactly the way i like it but the meat was very lean in it and had more bone to it than meat.
The only disappointing thing about this place is its service which is extremely slow. We waited more than 30 min for each dish to be served on our table. Infact i had to ask thrice for a menu card. This is the only reason why i couldn't give a 5 rating.

I've been here for the Christmas lunch. I'm super happy and satisfied with this place. The ambiance is soothing. 
We've ordered beer can tempura fish. I absolutely loved this. Next we ordered a coq-au-vin which is chicken and mushrooms cooked in a wine based sauce and its served with parsley butter rice . yummm!
The next was baked fish Wellington. The fish was fresh and tender.  Cooked with a cheese based sauce and served with saffron rice which is a little sweet in taste went perfectly well together. 
Then we had this dish called apple wood smoked pork medallion . the presentation was wonderful. The pork was tender and the taste of it with apple sauce and baked potato at the bottom was a treat to taste buds. My friend also got a grape based mocktail Which I didn't really like.

I personally liked how the owner was always around asking and suggesting us as to what to order and what will appeal to our taste buds.

Happy eating! A must visit place :)

Visited the place for a second time in the last two months this Monday. We ordered Deconstructed Papdi Chaat, some drinks, Dajaj chermoula, Hong shao rou, Devilled crab meet along with Garlic cheese toasts. 

There is nothing about the taste & quality of the food which I can say that hasn't been said before, IT WAS SIMPLY AWESOME!!! But, the best part of this joint is the personal care that Chef Sambit takes for all the guests and his advise of the course based on your taste buds.

The only thing they now need to master (and that is the only reason why I rated them 4.5 and not 5) is the ability of the staff to handle a full house.

I was just trying to figure out, how does one rate a restaurant that, from the moment we enter into, gives out negative vibes.... Till u come to the food which is not at all bad ... till u find a hair in your majn course and the bread basket?
To begin with, they don't believe in answering their phone. They answer every 3rd phone call i think. 
On entering the restaurant we were greeted by the smell of the toilet. No points for guessing that the toilet was unclean and had a wet floor. And the table we were shown was verrrrry close to aforementioned toilet. Yay!
The waiter who came to set our table (no it was not set wen we came) was trained in some place where they were taught to throw the napkin in the general direction of the diner from the opposite side of the table, rather than come and place it next to them, nicely folded. 

The very reason I went to the place was to try out the molecular gastronomy drinks. They were unavailable. They would be available after 2 days they say.... After the new year rush passes ( they didn't say)
After complaint about rather emphatically about the smell for the second time, they took us to another room which was empy and had much lesser toilet smell. The moment we were shown the table in the other room, a couple of diners started complaining why they were not given that table ! ( very soon they left the restaurant, without eating) 
The food came and like I mentioned earlier, it was not bad at all. Then I found a hair in my food. After mentioning it a couple of times they offered to replace it.
In the spirit of full disclosure, I'd like to mention that our server was very polite though he kept forgetting to bring us napkin, water etc. 
That's all folks. 
PS: I think my 3 stars r rather generous given everything.

Lovely ambience. Great place. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Mushroom Duxelle which was nicely flavoured. The crispy chilli babycorn was great too! Loved the Khoai Tay. Great dishes but limited variety for vegetarians. 
Coming to the cocktails, the Cosmo and LIIT were great. Molecular Mojito was a big disappointment. 
The Jack Daniels mousse was great but I found it a little too strongly flavoured for my liking.  
The staff was courteous and we couldn't ask for more. It was my birthday and my friends had arranged for little handwritten notes to come with the dishes and the staff cooperated with them. :)

A common dilemma that party goers and food lovers often face , is whether to choose a place with good drinks menu or a place with awesome food menu. Thankfully Spice Kraft comes with the solution providing some amazing drinks menu along with some delicious food. I am into cocktail mixology myself, so was actually interested to try out the cocktails in this place. And boy weren't they amazing. Out of the box cocktails blended to perfection, having awesome taste and hitting the right chords to get you high.¬†

Must try cocktails
Hazelnut Heaven (very similar to Baileys :D)
Jamun Mary
Beer Blaster
Action 20000 (the knock out drink, save it for the last)

Among Food you should definitely try DEVILED CRAB and FISH TEMPURA in BEER CAN. Only thing that I would like Team Spice Kraft to improve is probably to play better music which will help a great deal to improve the ambiance. Service in drinks is a bit slow, which is understandable because making the perfect cocktail takes time, so for a change order drinks fast, coz your food is likely to be served earlier than your drinks. ¬† I went there back to back days with different sets of friends and all liked this place very much. ¬†I hope Team Spice Kraft keeps up toe good work in future and the quality does't drop with growing demand, coz I am pretty sure this place is going to become a hugely popular destination for both food and booze lovers.

As an out-of-towner visiting my hometown, I was excited to visit this place due to Zomato reviews.We were 2 adults with a toddler, visiting for lunch, a couple of days before Christmas.

The ambiance was nice. The service a bit mixed..the server could answer no question; however the person taking the order was well versed with the menu. Having said that, the service was polite and friendly at all times.

The 1st few pages of the food menu talks about the owner and possibly (?) head chef. Reading of a formidable background of food and hospitality education, we rubbed our hands in glee at the food we could expect. Unfortunately, the food did not deliver.

Drinks:
1. Smoked guava+captain morgan+ginger ale: Nice attempt at a new cocktail. The accompaniment was a hard piece of guava, lightly 'marinated' with masala. A softer piece would have made a big difference.
2. Virgin mojito: Decent.

Food:
1. Bacardi limon infused tandoori chicken sausages, churan and blueberry coulis: The 2 things we liked about this were..the attempt to make something different and the blueberry coulis. The "sausages" had the taste and consistency of sheekh kabab, without the smokiness..that's not necessarily a bad thing; it just didn't match our expectation. The limon had barely anything to contribute to the dish, except the drama of it's appearance in mini plungers.
2. Yasai gyoza (pan braised exotic vegetables and mushroom dimsums): The dimsums were nice. The vegetables were diced into dots and sprinkled over the dimsums, effectively taking away their taste and "exotic-ness".
3. Baked fish wellington: This was barely average fare..presentation, taste, consistency of sauce. Unless things have changed drastically at an old established eatery in Free School street, it was a miss to have ordered this dish anywhere else.
4. Roast pork in rendang curry: This was the saver..the curry was lovely. However, the pork was chewy instead of soft and tender.

The general impressions of the past reviewers seem to be in favour of Spice Kraft. Going purely by that, it doesn't seem that this restaurant needs to up its standards. More power to it, in that case!
However, with the credentials of the owner/chef being a prominently displayed part of the menu, I hope that the food comes close to matching that lofty standard one day.

This place left me delighted! 
Yesterday a friend of mine and I walked into this new establishment. 
You see, there is this thing about trying out new restaurants you are almost always hesitant at first. However, having said that I can't complain at all ! This place literally delighted me! 
The wide variety of cocktail choices, the exotic menu is just one reason why one should come here. 
The ambience is very simple, chic with soothing music playing in the background. 
The place is spacious and well decorated. 
Service was another kudos! 
Staff comes out very interactive, suggesting the best on the menu for the guest. And the chef coming in to take feedbacks was just adding to the brownie points. 
After looking at the whole list of menu, we both settled for some seafood, pork and chicken. 
We ordered squid rings in butter sauce, pork in oyster sauce and firecrackers; which were chicken fried with garlic and ginger served along with hot and sweet sauce. 
The pork was amazing, it was perfectly cooked. With all the right balance of spices and it was slightly crispy too. 
Squid was wonderful ! It was simple, extremely fresh and the best part was the sauce perfectly complimented the squid hence the taste didn't dilute. 
Firecrackers were good too, went well with my daiquiri and sangria. 
For cocktails we ordered, cosmopolitan, sangria , daiquiri, LIIT and sivas regal based cocktails. 
The cocktails were perfectly blended, I absolutely loved the cosmopolitan and daiquiri. 
Overall I can't wait to go back and try out new dishes on the menu and this place is a MUST visit every time Kolkata calls me. 
I would happily rate this place a 4.5 overall for such a well-drawn dining experience.

Having heard good things about this relatively new place in Ballygunj just opposite Hazra Law College,my friend and I decided to give it a try and ended up having a lovely time.

The entrance and the exterior are not very fancy but the interior is nice and neat. It is not the most spacious restaurant but the the space has been well utilized and the decor quite classy. It has a nice overall semi formal kinda ambiance with tasteful soothing music being played in the background.

Both the food menu and the drinks menu I found to be really interesting. Both were extensive and featured quite a few attractive innovations to go with a number of time tested classics.

We settled for squid rings in butter garlic,firecrackers,hong shau rou.The squid rings in butter garlic were wonderful. It was an uncomplicated simple dish that was impeccably fresh and tasty. The Hong shau rou which was a pork preparation in oyster and hoisin sauce was once again lovely. I liked the fact that the pork was well cooked and it contained a perfect balance between lean meat and fat. The firecrackers were crispy deep fried chunks of chicken with a hint of garlic and chilli. It went perfectly with our cocktails.

Among the cocktails,we tried the sangria,the liit,the chivas julep. All the cocktails were refreshing and quite strong too. I particularly liked the chivas julep and the sangria.¬†

The staff were nice and courteous. The chef came personally to us to talk about the food and that we felt was a nice gesture. The service was a little bit on the slower side.The pricing is pretty reasonable even more so considering the quality and the prime location of this place.

Overall Spice Kraft succeeded in impressing us and there are a number of other items on the menu which I wish to try out soon.
Cheers! :)

we,some of our schoolmates,maintain a ritual to get drunk and to pull each others leg as hard as possible,so we started to plan a week before about the venue,and believe me when i say that we have almost exhausted all of our options.one of us suggested spicekraft,and I,who hail himself as a foodie have never heard of it. as it was a new name on tge map and our only viable option we gathered around the venue on 25th. it is nearby the ballygunge phari,on hazra road. It let us down on its' very first impression,it is absolutely a fine dining joint,not suitable for us rowdies.there is virtually no decor,music was so slow that hasim amlas' knock would have look like sehwagesque.anyways we decided to check the menu,and o boy,it hit us hard.the pricing the variety of the food and the cocktails were amazing. we have ordered a lot many things as in beer can tampura fish(check the sauce),bacardi infused chicken sausage(take the snap before you jump on the food)and many more.but it was DEVILLED CRAB MEAT which was pure magic.the smoothness of the butter,the rich crab meat,with a hint of the tangy mustard-it was a fusion made in heaven.we have ended ordering 7 dishes of that crab dish.chivas julep,choco beam,hazelnut vodka took the crown among the booze lot. service was too slow,ambience can be upgraded but the quality of the food,sheer finesse of those cocktails,and the loud adda session made the night and the place etched into our memory.¬†
check the place out,once. you wont regret..

I visited this place today.
Located it through zomato.

This place left me with mixed feelings. Entrance is nothing fancy. Tables are bit cramped. I guess there are better sections inside for seating, but we weren't shown. 
The front section has quite many tables but cramped in space. 
Elaborate drinks and food menu.. We chose our all time favorite Jack Daniel's and 2 chicken starters- bacardi lemon infused chicken, and kouthimbiri chicken kebab. 
The bacardi chicken was unique, with droppers fixed on the kebabs which dripped alcohol.. Amazing. Loved the concept and the taste. The second kebab was too good. Loved the food.
Reason for low rating- they served some chips with the drinks, but the plate was broken from the side and had The silver Oak written on it. So it definitely belongs to some other restaurant. And I observed a little cockroach crawling the walls.. 
I wonder, if thats the hygiene of the seating area, what should be the scene in the kitchen. 

No complaints about the food though.

For starters we ordered Subz ki Galawat and Dajaj Chermoula(A lebanese fusion).  Both were presented exquisitely to go along with Sangrilla. For main course we ordered Baked Fish Wellington and Cog Au Vin. It was simply fantastic. Lots to offer and a repeat visit is a must.

Spicekraft...it can be considered as the latest addition to Kolkata's inclinazione for continental food. Had high expectations from this place and they totally met it. The menu offers wide variety of mouth watering entr√©es..started out with Bacardi limon infused chicken sausage, they were exquisite. The main course consisted of Coq-Au-Vin & Baked Fish Wellington which really thrilled us. It was followed by a delicious Classic Monte Carlo for dessert. All the dishes had the warmth of home made food. Chef Sambit made enough efforts to win our hearts. Apart from such exquisite flavours the price of the food was quite moderate. The ambience of the place was also quite soothing. I had a wonderful dining experience and would highly recommend others to visit this place. I personally think 5stars are too minimal for such a place to rate.

Be it the location, the decoration, the lights, ambiance, courtesy of the staff & last but definitely not the least, the taste and quality of food, everything is magical. We had Beer can tempura fish as starters with drinks and Coq au vin as the main course. The food was heavenly. Coq au vin is indeed one of the best things I've ever tasted. And the place is also pocket friendly. The Manager came up to our table and spoke to us personally about the food and everything else. It was really a very nice gesture. It is only two months old, and I'm sure that it will become one of the leading dining places in the city in near future!! Kudos to team Spice Kraft for putting up such a brilliant show :)

As they say, don't judge the book by its cover. This surely defines the same.

We went not by the menu, but by the recommendations of their owner, Chef Sambit. And he did serve us with some of the most interesting flavours he has to offer. 

The cocktails are very well done. The food is amazing.

A definite recommendation.

 zomato.Loved the ambience which was soothing the menu which was extensive and the people including the chef who were extremely cordial and happy to serve with a smile. Being a Saturday evening there was a huge rush but the team handled the pressure with ease. Food and drinks were served quite fast. Its amazing how pocket friendly this place is. Foods ordered :beer battered tempura fish which was actually served in beer cans.the coating was crisp and fish was juicy loved the tartar dip with hints of orange in it.Old monk chicken drumsticks were delightful as was the devilled crab.In drinks on the chefs recommendation took Hammerjack which sure did hammer me up in the right way. This is one of the best places in Kolkata.Hats off chef.. Will be back soon wish you guys all the best.

I am following spice kraft since day one of its opening, since i happen to work at the dental clinic opposite to it. The multicuisine menu seemed impressive, prices are so damn reasonable, and the watching zomato reviewers raving about it in such a short time; could resist but cross the road and check in with my girls. The interior set up though compartmentalized is pretty warm and decent. Music selection can be improved. Hospitality is fantastic.. and coming to food..
Well starters were teriffic!!
DAJAJ CHERMOULA
PORK RIBS BURRAH KEBABS
DEVILLED CRABMEAT
BEER BATTER TEMPURA FISH all were sheer awesome!! Deserves Recommendations.

The mains..
BAKED FISH WELLINGTON
SHEPHERD PIE
CHICKEN COQ AU VIN
were nice. The chicken dish can be improved alot.

The vodka cocktails.. absolut ones..
LICHITINI
THE CRANAPPLE DRIVER
HAZLENUT HEAVEN
were ok. Litchini was a better choice out of three.

Desserts. Sad.
The NUTELLA CREPES with vanilla mascarpone and brandy sauce was just one of the disgusting dessert i had.
Next 100% JACK DANIELS WITH swiss CHOCOLATE MOUSSE and drunken petit four was another saddening thing! Chocolate mousse dint taste like chocolate!! Mousse didnt have that consistency.. it was like some low quality semi solid lump of chocolate coloured icecream with a lot of alcohol as topping.. so much that we could just taste the alcohol part! So i would like to see spice kraft introduce some more desserts like cheesecakes puddings tiramisu etc and sincerely get a better recipe for the already existing ones.

We ordered chicken and fish starters they were really good. The garnishing of the food was awesome. Drinks are reasonably priced.
The only backlog is their waiter and their services are slow. Apart from that a nice place to visit.

With such a corny name, Spice Kraft near Pais Malgudi on Hazra Road was better than what I expected. 3 well-lit seating areas with different ambience and music had a warm inviting feel to them. And so did the staff, who politely accepted our request for changing the seating area.

The alfredo pasta was as routine as you get. Below average, I would say. But the fish delicacies were amazing and so were the spicy mocktails.

A good visit, though vegetarians might be disappointed if the pasta was any indication.

P.S. The Chef is an alumnus of XL. Wish there were discounts for juniors.

Who likes good conti food? Good news for conti food lovers. Visit Spice Kraft @ Ballygunj. Good restaurant. Good food. Good presentation. Best is good service ( which is rare to find in kolkata). We went for a Sunday family lunch. I Ordered Shepherd's Pie which is a beautiful meat pie with a crust of mashed potato. They could actually made me nostalgic  with its aroma and made me remember the one I had in Coworth Park Hotel Ascot, England. 
I would highly suggest people to visit and try this dish in Spice Kraft. Hats of Mr Banik and the way he has come up with this restaurant!!!

Visited on a Saturday afternoon for quick lunch. The place was empty with only 2 other tables occupied. Since we were hungry and also in a hurry we skipped starters and ordered the main course. We had to wait for around 40 minutes to get our food. During our wait, the head chef who is also the owner came out and introduced himself. He asked if we liked the food and we informed that we haven't received anything on our table yet.  After this, he just left. I mean left and went out of the restaurant. I was a bit concerned whether we will get our order or will have to leave hungry. After enquiring about our order a number of times, we finally got some food. The food was good. We ordered Hunan chicken which was decent, paneer schewaan which was good and chilly garlic noodles which was extremely good. Overall not a very great experience but good quality food.

I wanted to love this place, I really did. Some of the food items were exquisite, namely the Beer Can Tempura and the Turkey Mousse. Grilled Mackerel and the Lobster were pretty good. However, a certain member of the staff seemed insistent on pushing items down even if we didn't want them. Two plates of Deconstructed Papri Chaat were served on his insistence. I asked for mash potatoes instead of buttered rice along with my fish. My mistake-  I was subjected to a lecture about continental food pairings. Other lectures experienced through the meal include our poor understanding of the significance of the napkin decorations. 
I have seen the replies other reviews have received, and frankly, I was a bit apprehensive about posting anything about this place. 
I would love to return to Spice Kraft, but perhaps once I have the choice of ordering what I actually want to have?

Have been here only once and this has already become a favourite! Molecular gastronomy gets a lease of life in Kolkata with Spice Kraft with new innovative dishes like restructured Papri Chaat. The kebabs here are too die for and you get to see different techniques used with rose smoked Paneer Tikka and a scrumptious White Dal whose recipe has been sourced from rural India. Customer friendly place with the head chef himself interacting with all the diners. A must visit place for all who like to try different dishes!

Spice Kraft is definitely one of the latest joint to check out in South Kolkata. Heard a lot of buzz regarding this new joint and finally took the steps to drop a visit yesterday. The decor is really great but the most wonderful thing is the heart warming welcome of¬†Chief Sambit. He walked to us and made some wonderful suggestions throughout the course. We tried some of the signature dishes like Beer Can Tempura Fish, Devilled Crab Meat(exceptionally good, one of the unique crab preparations I've tasted till date), Dajaj Chermoula, Coq-Au-Vin. All the preparations are unique and signature dishes of this joint and THEY TASTE AWESOME. Among the cocktails The Hammer Jack & Chivas Julep is a must try. And as we all gone through the reviews 100% Jack Daniels & Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse, Drunken Petit Fours
 is the Dessert that needs to checked out. It taste¬†truly¬†awesome. I'll surely recommend everyone to check this joint because its worth it. And to end with..A picture says Thousand Words....

Last night visited this place with some doubts but after get entry into the restaurant feel really happy about the welcome of the staff. Next the interior of the place including the table itself outstanding. Next the drinks offer absolutely great , the main attraction of the place with the presentation. Next the main assets of the restaurant chef or we can say all in all the great man Chef ! We fully leave the  selection of food on him & he really make different mouthwatering dishes for us. All credits goes to him for making our special day more precious. Last night we enjoyed only the starters part waiting for main course next time. Hope that will come soon........ Please visit once they will not disappoint you.

When I first saw the place I thought it to be a singing bar sort of.. Bouncers were standing outside to welcome us. A Fl. Off shop is adjacent to the restaurant which is a boon to the area of Hazra. Now talking about the ambience of the restaurant. It is divided into two sections, one for the young ones with loud music and the other for the family people. We went there with our family of seven. They have seating tables for 6 heads only. Food is pretty good both continental and chinese. Service is very poor, they take hell lot of time to serve the food but all the waiters are courteous and helpful to select your order. The chef personally visited to know our grievances. There was nothing in the dessert apart from chocolate items. He asked us to try their darsan with vanilla icecream which was trully tasty. They made the darsan with some orange recipe of theirs,  not with the usual honey base which makes the darsan very sticky. Overall a nice place for both family and friends. Its not so costly either. Definitely recommend it.

Visited this place with friends. Nice ambience. Nice location. We had two starters sabz ke galawat and kele ke phool. Both the starters were really good and they were different. For main course we ordered safed dal moradabadi and monjji haak from Kashmir. The host chef is really friendly and he comes@ down and explains every dish to you.
Overall the place is quite good and it is worth a visit. The portion size of the main course is a little small according to the price.

The rating is not for food but for the loud obnoxious music which they were playing and refused to lower the volume.

Situation : Read positive reviews about this place and wanted to try this restaurant since last October, today late afternoon got the opportunity. 
Once we entered there was no one waiting to seat us, within a matter of few seconds someone ushered us in and was shown a two seater table. The moment I entered I requested one staff member to lower the volume of the music they were playing. He mumbled "fixed" and went away. Unfortunately the speaker was directly above my head, such was the volume of the nasty music they were playing that I hardly could hear anything my friend was saying, I again requested the waiter to lower the volume not turn it off, he again said that the volume cannot be turned down but I can seat myself somewhere else. 
If the person already knew that the music was bothering me from the time I walked in why would he ask me to sit just below the speaker I have no clue. 
I requested the staff members to turn down the volume which they didn't, in fact asked me to sit somewhere else which I didn't so eventually I walked out. 
Bravo! The staff at spice Kraft know how to drive away customer with their obnoxious music and rude behaviour! Great going. More than customer satisfaction they are into their music which they insisted their other clients were listening to ( read four family members ) who couldn't be bothered about what was playing.
I didn't know this is a mini someplace else where the music doesn't stop! My mistake completely! 
Thank you very much but no amount of good food is worth the torture which you people play and cannot even lower the volume!

Visited this place around 4:30pm on a Sunday. After reading all the great reviews about this place, our group of 5 had huge expectations which unfortunately went downhill from the time we ordered. I had four guy friends with me, and obviously the cocktail menu of this place had their attention. After some pondering, they ordered 4 Manhattans and I wanted a Smirnoff Mango. Unfortunately after a few minutes, the server informed us that they only had Smirnoff Orange and Espresso so I had to settle for an Orange. Next came the food. We ordered Beer Battered Tempura Fish as per the chefs recommendation and Green Chilly Chicken along with that. However, both the dishes were nothing extraordinary. To be honest, I've had far better prepared Beer Batter Fish and the Green Chilly Chicken tasted completely ordinary. Even the quantity was very poor. Well, doesn't end here. After another round of Manhattans, the guys wanted LIIT. But the server repeatedly told us to go for HammerJack and we soon got to know why. Flustered, one of the guys changed his LIIT order to HammerJack. While the HammerJack was served within minutes, I kid you not when I say this, we had to wait exactly 48 mins for the 3 LIITs to be served. Really? That's how long it takes to make 3 Long Island Iced Teas? 
Also, we often mistake over attentive service as great service. Great service is when the servers give us privacy while keeping a sharp eye on our needs. Giving the 1.5 only because the Manhattan cocktail was very nicely mixed and overall presentation was good.
Never coming back here again.

A wonderful food experience at this couple of months old restaurant. The chef even came to the tables and interacted with the guests making us feel that they're keen Ly interested about our experience there. Not just asking for a form to be filled in routinely. The staff were polite and helpful,guiding us about the menu. But I felt that they were a bit pushy in trying to get us to order according to their suggestions. They should suggest only and let guests make their choices. Moreover they were dropping stuff on the table while serving,both food and water, were dropped. This sloppiness is not expected in a quality restaurant. 
The food and drinks experience was great. All items that we tried were excellent. We started with the deconstructed papri chat, which is part of their innovative molecular gastronomy. It looked nothing like our regular papri chaat but tasted the same. Great! Kele ke phool starter and doodhiyan kebab too were just too good. The drinks we ordered....roasted pineapple cocktail, tangarita and virgin mojito were fantastic. In the mains we went for Indian, safed dal was something I had first time,it had great flavours. The mixed veg. preparation and butter naans completed the good food experience at Spicekraft.
I'm surely going back there to try out their South East Asian dishes.

Great food! One of the best restaurants I have been to in Kolkata. Spent 3 hours with my gang. The service was good. The food is beyond delicious! Even the chef visited our table and asked for our feedback. The only issue is that the quantity of the dishes is not much. A great place, nonetheless.

Visited this place yesterday for dinner; this place is all about luscious food combined with an exclusive way of presentation.The decoration is warm and posh,hospitality is amazing.
The chef himself recommended Dajaj Charmoula,one of his signature appetisers,and it was exquisite.The smokey and tender chicken literally melted in our mouths.
Coming to the drinks,we ordered Kokum Rita and Tangarita.While Kokum Rita was dandy, but Tangarita,with a perfect blend of green chillies,pineapple and orange juice,was the clear winner.
For mains,we ordered Fish Wellington,Moon Fan Rice and Hunan Fish.Fish Wellington tasted delightful; the beckti was creamy and nicely baked.Moon Fan Rice was rich in flavour and aroma.Though tasty,the batter of  Hunan Fish was too thick.
Lastly,we ordered Classic Monte Carlo,a must try dish for chocolate lovers.
Overall,this place is for people who want to satiate their tastebuds without hurting their pockets.Highly recommend! (:

Been meaning to write this review for a while. 
Visited this place during the Pujas and was very impressed. 
The interiors are well decorated and the staff very friendly. 
Add to that the pocket friendly (relatively) prices. 
Coming to the food:
We ordered Baby Octopus to accompany our drinks which was fresh and sumptuous. 
Main course included Red Pepper Prawns and some Baked Fish dish who's name I don't remember. 
All of then were lovely and I will definitely visit this place again. 

Keep up the good work!!
Cheers :)

Hands down the most innovative food joint in town!! :) . Compliments to the chef for not taking the beaten path and exploring the unknown and cooking food which is not only music to our taste buds but an epitome of culinary brilliance. I mean I was so sure that I would love this place that I rated it a 5 stars even before having my first bite, I kid you not! :D It was my birthday celebration and I knew my foodie¬†friends deserved to get treated somewhere which does justice to their gastronomy. We did order quite a lot of dishes and all of them were a class apart.

1) Beer can Tempura fish with orange ponzu tartare' : Started off with this , the fish was crispy outside..soft and tender inside..and the orange dip complimented it perfectly. A must try! :)

2) Pork Ribs Burrah kabab with jalapeno and imli chutney drizzle! : This was our second choice of starters. The ribs were juicy and succulent and the spices wrapped it up in perfect proportions. Harmony for your tastebuds. :)

3) Shepherd's Pie: Next up was this one. Served with garlic breads this was my favorite of the lot. The lamb and cheese blended perfectly to create a concoction worth dying for. My only complain with the dish ..I needed some more of them crisp garlic breads...they were lip smacking awesome :)

4) Baked Fish Wellington : Bhetki phillets served with saffron rice...not quite intriguing right? WRONG!! ..Wait till u make the first bite and behold...the best bhetki u ever had..I place my money where my mouth is. The saffron rice was a little buttery..but I don't mind it..the phillets own your soul now!! :D

5) Red Pepper Prawns: Big and Juicy prawns..with flavors oozing out with every bite. :)

6) Khor Khog: Lost art of slow roasted lamb. Well glad our chef got hold of this before all was lost...cause this is how lamb should be prepared. Roasted to perfection with ample spices..this one should not be missed at any cost. :D

7) Dajaj Charmoula: Char grilled chicken with Charmoula spices served in small earthen pots. Although the chicken was tender and juicy..I do feel the chef can bring something¬†more to the dish. Ofcourse it tasted well but I felt something was lacking and sadly I couldn't put my finder to it. 

8) Devilled Crab Meat: WOW...JUST WOW!!! This was a firework of flavors in my mouth.¬†Considering this was the first time I was having crab..I was a bit skeptical..but all doubts were demolished when I had a spoon full of this deboned delight. MUST MUST MUST TRY!! :D :D

9) Moon Faan: Nothing much to say about it...rice with generous amount of mushrooms, chicken and egg :) Albeit Tasty!! :)

10) Roast Pork In Rendang Curry: The only dish which I would rate a 4 out of 5..loved the roasted pork..but the curry did not bode well with the moon faan. Maybe we ordered the combination wrong. Chef next time I would let you do the honours of selecting the perfect rice to go with this dish. :P :D

11) Classic Monte Carlo : After such a varied meal, you would expect an equally fulfilling dessert!! And the chef never disappoints. Dessert for me should always involve chocolate..and this was it. Although I was full to the T...I ordered this one back to back..I just couldn't stop..it had me engulfed in its choco vanilla goodness. My personal dessert recommendation..you will not be disappointed. :)

12) 100% Jack Daniels Mousse: This one I did not try..but my friends did..and all he had to say that ..he has found it..his favourite dessert..there is no looking back..this is it..and it was worth the wait. :D

And with that our wide plethora of food for the evening came to an end. Shoutout to Chef Sambit,,you Sir..personify awesomeness. I consider it an honour that¬†I got to treat my frnds and myself with your creation¬†on my birthday. A special thank you for handing us more wafers ...and taking the time out to talk with the customers and asking them about their preferences and suggesting whats best for their palates. I would come back soon ..and this time I would love it if u could come to the table and prepare any dish infront of us..as many here on zomato said u do time to time. Well this has been a big review...about time I sign off...till then..bon app√©tit. :)

Visited this place yesterday I.e. Sunday evening for an early dinner and to my astonishment it was almost full.

Location : From hazra road when u move towards Ballygunge phari crossing it'll come on your right. Ample parking space on the road, so no issues about it. :p

SpiceKraft has a very warm and cosy interiors. It's a small space but spacious. Even when it was full, it never looked congested. Nice work on the ceilings and the lights on the side walls. The Table decor was very pretty with the handkerchiefs kept in an unusual manner and accompanied by a Goods Carrier which contained salt pepper etc.

While people on the other tables were concentrating more on drinks. I, being an non- alcoholic was more interested in the food.
We had ordered a one-of-a-kind Deconstructed Papri Chaat. Served on a wooden plate with white spoons, the Papri Chaat was worth a try. The spoons contained the tangy chatpata Curd which we had to top with crisp bundi. I remember the waiters advice to close our eyes at the time of gulping it down and it did wonders. It tasted like a Papri Chaat with the crispiness and chatpata thing it had in it.

We then ordered for Kele k Phool Croques. It was one of the signature dishes and was mind blowing. It was a kebab and had cheese grated all over it. It was very tasty. Very pretty looking dish. And moreover both the dishes were quite light.

At the end we ordered for Veg Au Gratin. It was a classic. Vegetables tossed in white creamy sauce and with cheese all over it. No complains whatsoever.. Simply mind blowing.

The waiters were really very polite and courteous. Helped us with the orders and even advice us how to eat. The chef also visited the tables and asked how we liked the food and for suggestions.

A very nice visit.

This is officially my first review on zomato. This review should have been posted earlier but better late than never. I have been here twice once during the Pujas and most recently a few days ago. The second visit is more significant since i took the time to savour the experience and what an experience it was.
The decor is quite cool and the restaurant itself is spacious.
We started off with the Tangarita though personally i am not a big fan of mocktails decided to give it a try on the insistence of our waiter. He promised us that we wont be disappointed and am glad we did. Tangarita was an absolute blast with a perfect balance of orange and pineapple juice with a hint of spice.

For our entrees we had Kele ke Phool & Hoisin braised chicken popcorn. I was a bit skeptical about the Kele ke Phool but it turned out to be unlike anything i had tasted before. An absolute delight on the taste buds. Highly recommended and special mention to the waiter for his spot on recommendations.

From our main course we had Veg Chilly Garlic noodles with Hunan Fish.
The fish was very soft and the preparation itself balanced the spiciness of the noodles.

The best thing about the place was Chef Sambit or Sir as i call him (he was my professor during my college days) would take the time out to personally interact with the guests and provide his inputs on the dishes for the guests understanding.

We finished off with the Jack Daniels chocolate mousse which again gives a unique twist to the popular dessert.

The best part is the entire meal was well within the budget.

Highly recommended and will definitely count it as one of my favorites and will be visiting soon.

A revamp on the old resturant present at the same premises before so had very high expectations when i went back to kolkata this time. The decor turned out to be inviting however the food quality was not upto expectations at all. A simple prawn dish was very badly served & tasted stale. Would not recommend to anybody as a dine out option.

Been there during my last visit Kolkata. The ambience is quite nice, just wish that the food was good. The spread as per menu is quite elaborate ( moderately priced). But the food was substandard. Had ordered for a lobster thermidor which was so bad that I had to leave it halfway. A sincere suggestion to the management to focus on the food quality a bit more than the decor.

I was recommended here by one of my close friend and my entire experience was fantastic. Being a hardcore cocktail lover I can actually say that this place is a poor men's destination of some godly cocktails!!

If you really want to open up yourself in front your better half then you must finish the tall and lanky glass of jack hammer because you are bound to get a good hit by this hammer. 

The foods are unique and tasty..and you must try beer batter fish and pork ribs burrah kebabs. 

The best part is the owner cum chef of this restaurant is so humble and hospitable. He recommended the exact dishes that I really like. 

I am a happy customer and you must go there and I am sure you will have a fantastic time there.

This place has an unique combination of presentation and taste of the food. The presentation of the food we witnessed was really unimaginable, and the food was exceptional in its taste. The price was also quite reasonable. And the service and warmth provided by the team and the chef himself made the dinner a really memorable one. As a whole I believe that it's worth to visit such a place and spend an evening indulging into your taste buds.

Hi foodies!

=18th November, 2015=
Wow. Just wow. To have such an awesome restaurant close to my college and which does not hurt the pocket either, is a miracle in itself. We went there for lunch, albeit the decor is much suited for evening hours. (refer pictures) We did notice dimly lit other interior rooms but we were informed that were for private parties only.¬†

-Food-
1) PORK RIBS BURRAH KEBAB: For the entr√©es, we wanted to try Beer Can Tempura Fish, but Chef Sambit insisted we have this. (more on him later) He went to the point as to boast a money-back guarantee on the dish and as expected, it turned out to be excellent. The marination was superb.

2) For the mains, we tried MOON FAAN rice. The colour and the aroma and the quantity; you won't find a flaw here. It went excellent with the Rendang Curry.

3) As a side, we wanted to have Roast Pork in RENDANG CURRY but since the pork was not yet roasted (disappointing!), Chef Sambit specially made the same dish for us using a different meat (lamb). The use of kaffir lime really added a unique flavour to the curry.

4) For dessert, we had 100% JACK DANIELS MOUSSE. A perfect ending to a perfect meal. From the use of heart-shaped spoons for the dessert, to the dessert itself, you've got to experience it yourself.¬†

*Special Note: The mocktail in the picture was actually compliments from the Chef. It really went well with the mains.

Cons:
> The music needs to change. It does NOT go with the ambience or the food. Also, it was very loud. For some reason, the staff were unable to lower the volume and could not provide a reason for the same.

Note on Chef Sambit:
It is ALWAYS nice when the Chef himself pays attention to each guest. Since we were the only guests at that time, we were able to interact with him longer. If possible, ask him about his journey and you'd be pretty amazed. Chef Sambit is really proud of this joint and rightly so! He has paid great attention to every detail in the restaurant. As you can see in Zomato, Spice Kraft is an example of how genuine, honest hard work pays off!

Second visit coming very soon!

-Bon App√©tit. :)

To summarize quickly,

Great ambience

Excellent food and drinks

Polite Customer service..

This restaurant is situated near the ballygunge phari just opposite the hazra law college. I have been here couple of times. My first visit was awesome as they have very beautiful interiors. The glass strudded walls and the false ceiling is something to look at. The crockery they provide truly impressed me a lot. Next the food is awesome both in taste and presentation. The lebanese chicken dish Dajaj chermoula was very tender, flavorful, as the lebanese chicken should taste like. I never had this kind of dish before. The the star of the show was the beer batter fish tempura. It was crunchy outside but soft and flavorful inside. With the orange condiment, it created a whiplash of flavors in my mouth, a truly gastronomical delight..
The quality of cocktails and the drinks this restaurant provide is unique and amazing. I had tasted a number of them in my second visit. I really liked my drink Daiquiri, which was a blend of bacardi white, lime juice and sugar. It increased the pleasure of having the starters many fold. Besides this Tangerita tasted awesome with the green chilly twist. Virgin mojito was classically good. In main course, I tasted moon fan, it was very good, loaded with chicken and mushrooms and it went well with hunan chicken. Some of my friends took dum biryani and it tasted quite different but all of my friends seemed to like it a lot. Taste wise I can say that this restaurant is one of the best in kolkata, if not the best. Service wise they are quite slow. But I will definitely visit this restaurant again to check out the smoked paanipuri and papri chaat shots. I have heard they are awesome but i was unable to order them today, since we were already late. Also I would like to taste the Hammerjack and 100% jack daniels mousse next time i check in. Cheers to Spice Kraft.. U guys put up a good show..

Zomato inputs rushed me to the place. Nicely decorated with soothing lighting, the place looks chic. I vouched on zomato so the orders were replicated with the reviews I read. We started with Devilled Crabmeat , Dajaj Chicken and Papdi Chaat Shots. I ordered a chilled Sula Chenin Blanc to wash down the white meats. First the Dajaj Chicken arrived in earthen pots. Nice presentation. .the drumsticks placed on cucumber in a cute earthen pot. Now it was a gastronomic pleasure eating this...they melted in the mouth leaving a subtle aftertaste of spices. Next the beautifully baked Devilled Crabmeat arrived. This dish is absolute heaven. I've tried this at Mocambo and felt cheated chewing mushrooms and cheese. Also, it's better than kolmi baked crab of Bohemian. The journey of ecstasy starts from the first spoon it's filled with Crabmeat delicately seasoned and baked with cheese. Definitely recommended. I would not say much regarding the papdi shots ....the chef definitely culminated art to the street food but to a non vegetarian it might not be the best tapas. Main course we ordered Coq au Vin and Bhetki Wellington again Zomato recommendation. Now a bit on their personalization of customer service. The owner Sambit is very warm and customer centric. He personally attends to all tables and make recommendations. Adds to the USP in this wide cold world. The Coq au Vin had succulent pieces of chicken cooked with wine. Not to be compared with the original Coq au Vin which also has the smoky bacon flavour. This is more like a Chicken Diana with wine. It was smooth to my tastebud. The winner was the Wellington. ..two big sized bhetki fillet baked to perfection. ..smoothy textured served with fragrant saffron rice.The rice tasted like a close kin of the famous Basanti Pulao. Put together the dish is overwhelming for the palate. Definitely visit the place if you enjoy well crafted food with distinct flavours. It also enhances on Molecular Gastronomy so indulge in that too. Deconstructed food needs an acquired taste.Nevertheless the place serves good quality things for competitive price. DEVILLED CRABMEAT is my recommendation. Sambit it's definitely an innovative start please make staff more proactive for a seamless transition. ALL THE BEST, CHEERS. With

When you have a proactive chef personally attending to each table, the joint is definitely going to be in the reckoning.
Its a pity we went there with a miserly appetite, yet we managed to leave stuffed & content.
The Chef recommended Dajaj Chermoula as a starter which was beautiful.
Main course was Baked Fish Wellington & Penne Pasta Alfredo. The fish had 2 healthy pieces, tasted fresh. The pasta was also delectable.
But the highlight of the meal was the cocktail. The Chivas julep & The Kokam rita (margherita redefined) were well created & refreshing.
A place to visit often & A special word of appreciation for Chef Sambit.

Visited this restaurant last sunday seeing the rating in Zomato but surprisingly i was quite disappointed. I visited the place to have pav bhaji fondue but on ordering we were informed that they have discontinued the same as many have copied them.
The ambience of the restaurant is somehow dull and feels a bit cramped. The service was good as in timely delivery and we went by whatever the chef recommended.
Kele ke phool - Good fusion but the chutni served with it didnt go to well.
Subz gilauti kebab - not very impressive as somehow the base taste of kele ke phool was same and it was very average.
Manchow soup thou was good but needs to be little on a thicker side.
Main course we went for Indian and as recommended we ordered Safeed dal and Benarasi Aloo.
Safeed Dal - had a burnt taste which as a courtesy they took back
Benarasi Aloo was again very average
Rotis thou was good but was served cold
Then we ordered a black dal which was very spicy which doesnt go well with dal makhani.
The icing on the cake was that The fresh lime soda at last served at room temperature with no fizz which again as a courtesy they took back.
Ambience - 3
Service - 3
Food - 2.5

I love this new place...and have already been twice. Both times my friends I went with loved it too. The affordable prices, the tasteful decor, the yellow lights...what's not to like? Chef Sambit recommends cocktails and food suited to your palate...which is so rare in restaurants in Kolkata. A unique European kind of experience it is when the chef discusses and even modifies the food and drink to your taste for maximum satisfaction. The taste of the Chermoula Kebabs and the Coq au Vin continue to linger and the Hazelnut Brittle cocktail, the Koum Rita and the L.I.I.T are all tasty and potent. Three cheers for this eatery. Being a poultry-eater I would like to see more chicken dishes added to the continental and starters menu, please! And of course...I will undoubtedly visit again soon.

The place exceeded expectations. Food is succulent, very innovative and even if you try an old classic dish which you might have tasted elsewhere in Kolkata, this one from Spice Kraft's kitchen will taste better. The servings are done by very caring people who truly are interested to know if you have liked the food. I can remember of Bimal. And surely needs a mention for Chef Sambit who suggests really good cocktail and dishes which you will like and comes across to spend some discussion with his guests. It goes to prove that there has been good amount of thought which has gone in to prepare each and every think on the restaurant....look at the menu card and see how the drinks are mentioned and grouped, the food how they are experimented even in the sauces which are served. Would like to return to the place

Visited the place on bhai phota to celebrate my hubby's birthday reached quite late due to bisarjan traffic, however the welcome and the attention given by the restaurant and chef was   awesome!  Be it cocktails "Smoked Guava, Roasted Pinapple or Chivas Julep",Mocktails "Kiwi mango or papri chaat" blended to the perfection. Food is sooooooo good that we were literally stuffed. Nowadays very rarely you can visit a place where you are completely satisfied from cocktail to dessert.

I had been here on Diwali evening and the place was pretty empty. I guess many foodies are yet to discover Spice Kraft. 
The main highlights about the place: 
1. Booze at very affordable prices.
2.Lots of options in Alcohol.
3.No extra taxes that increase your bill amount.
4.Starters taste awesome. We did not try main course. 
5.Table is easily available . Not much rush. 

We had ordered for a 3litre pitcher and then started tasting their cocktails . 
L.I.I.T - Good enough based on what KOlkata servers 
Daiquiri - It hardly goes wrong. 
Kokum Rita - This came with the bartender's recommendations but did not go well with my taste. Margaritas are best served the classic way. 
Choco Beam - Too sweet but not bad. 

Do not miss their Dajaj Chermoula.  

Bookmark the place plan a visit.

The first thing that I have to write about Spice Kraft is excellent food.... Hands down one of the most elaborate and extensive menu that I have seen recently and what is more... They executed each and every one we tried to perfection.... The food journey started on a lazy Sunday afternoon with Molecular infusions... Pomegranate, Contrieu and tonic water.... The pomegranate was macerated in the the Contrieu and the flavour seeped into the drink to give that tang... My poison was Roasted pineapple, beefeater and lemonade, the cocktail... The spiced infused drink leaves a lovely rounded after taste that is perfect... The starters consisted of beer batter tempura fish with spicy tartare... It was perfectly cooked and served very cleverly in a Budweiser can!!! The next on the menu was the much recommended Pork ribs burra kebab... In one word it was heaven on a plate.... The pork ribs were succulent falling off the bones and believe me when I say that it tastes better than any baby back ribs that I have gorged on.... The Indian spices marries perfectly with the pork... And instead of roasting them on the tandoor directly the chef has sous vide the pork and then hit it with the smoking gun... Perfect on the palate!!!
Next on our menu was Devilled crab... It is beautifully cooked and can give Mocambo a run for its money any day and that is saying something!!!
The Moon Fan rice... An ancient Chinese recipe served with a 21st century twist.... But the roasted pork with Rendang curry stole the show in main course.... Loved the succulent pork.... And the spicy curry....
But this was the high point of our day... The chef, Shambit, an amiable man came upto us and offered to make something that was not on the menu... He has been experimenting with Molecular foods and different techniques and what he created for us blew our minds.... A juicy reshmi kebab served on a platter with the smoked rose petals infused in it.... So when we removed the glasses covering the kebabs we were first hit by a whiff of rose petals infused smoke and then the kebab.... Juicy and tender... Morsels of bliss on our tongue.... Heston Blumenthal watch out!!!!
These delicious food was washed down with a Jamun Mary and Breezer Blaster... Both of which I strongly recommend... Especially the Blaster... Yummm.....
The pocket pinch is no pinch at all... Very reasonable...
And the staffs are very friendly, helpful and courteous!!!
We shall be returning very soon... Hungry for more!!!!

Firstly, thanks to Zomato without it we would have never landed in this treasured place. The place is owned and personally supervised by Chef Sambit Banik who is an expert in molecular gastronomical cooking. Well, I was also not familiar with the word but trust me..u land there once and u'll know what is it. Ambience of the place was really good and so were the staffs. Now coming to the food..I'll say by visiting only once we were left craving for more as one cannot have everything at once considering the variety this restaurant provides to its guests. We tried continental and ordered Beer battered tempura fish served in an empty beer can & orange flavored tarter sauce.. Presentation was quirky and the fish fillets were crispy, tastes so differently good with the orange tarter sauce which will definitely spark up your taste buds. In the main course we ordered Baked Fish Wellington. In the menu card it was written it would be served with saffron rice n mushroom but surprisingly it was served with buttered rice which I pointed out to Mr. Sambit and he personally apologized. Lastly, the dessert was like sixer in the last ball remaining. 100% jack Daniel infused chocolate mousse with petit fours. The presentation was visually enthralling, tasted heavenly. The ending could not have been more perfect. We are surely going back to taste their various Chinese n Indian items. With

Thanks to Zomato that I choose this place for my birthday lunch. Located on Hazra Road, just opposite to Haza Law College, we had no difficulty in finding the place. The ambience is just amazing and it is decorated nicely. The waiters were very courteous and helpful in choosing the dishes for us since the menu had a lot of variety making it difficult to choose. We tried the Chef's special Beer Can Tempura Fish, Dajaj Chermoula in the starters and it was simply best. Then in the main course, we had Nasi Goreng and Hunan Chicken. The Nasi Goreng, a dish from Indonesia, was a bit spicy, but it tasted pretty good. Since Spicekraft specializes in Cocktails, we couldn't afford to miss out those. We tried the Hammerjack and Kokum Rita. The Hammerjack is same as the Long Island and Kokum Rita was something new we tried. Kokum Rita is a mixture of Kokum saar, tequila and spices and it was simply brilliant. Liked both the cocktails very much. And to finish off our lunch, we ordered the 100% Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse. It was the best of the lot. A must try for the foodies. We were 3 people and the bill was quite reasonable enough. To be honest, a truly amazing place I could have asked for to celebrate my 21st birthday! Will be looking forward to visiting this place once again!

Had a lovely afternoon at this joint last sunday.. located near hazra law college, the decor of this place is just awesome... the staffs are courteous enough and made sure we are comfortably seated... we first had beer battered tempura prawns which came in a can of beer ...it was crisp and the sauce had a certain tanginess to it which made it even more special... then we had laal maas with missi roti and safed daal ....all the three dishes were succulent, tasty and had an aroma of freshenss to it... I particularly liked the fact that they have tried to incorporate some rare dishes from different parts of the.world effectively while promoting molecular gastronomy... overall, a superb place to dine..:-)

"One cannot think well, love well, sleep well;¬†If one has not DINED well." Well, that's what we did!!! Dined to our heart's content. Where?-SPICEKRAFT!!! Quite conveniently located near Hazra law college in Ballygunje Phari, this place has immense potential to mold itself into ever-growing¬†the market of Molecular Gastronomy.¬†The place inside is quite appealing, with detailed designs on the ceiling and on the walls, that are intercepted by mirrors, which the younger gen might find useful for selfies! :D ¬†There is a glass cabinet at one corner,¬†featuring¬†a wide variety of wine and whisky. Each table also had a fancy¬†mini truck carrying the salt n pepper.The look and feel of the place offers everything that a fine dining restaurant would, with light music in the backdrop. However, the the view from the outside could have been more glamourous to lure more visitors.¬†
Coming to the food, for starters, we had Beer Can Tempura Fish, that came sitting pretty on a wooden board, garnished with cabbage dressing. The fish had the right amount of tenderness and crisp and the slightly sweet orange ponzu tartare, complemented it well adding a very different tang to the tongue.The next starter was Shish Taouk, which is grilled chicken with cream. Again, the chicken was very¬†moist and melting in the mouth; just the way one would want his reshmi kebabs but with a twist.¬†
Our main course contained Coq Au Vin, that was absolutely delicious, specially¬†recommended by chef Sambit Banik who was very¬†welcoming¬†and courteous.¬†
And there was Baked Fish Wellington which was pretty generous in the amount of cheese. The saffron rice pilaf tasted great with the creamy cheesy baked bhetkis.¬†
Apart from this, we had also taken a mocktail, Tangarita. Now this was THE hero for us. Sweet, tangy n just a wee bit spicy, it did a great job as an amazing accompaniment with the¬†starters.
 I thoroughly enjoyed my first peek into SpiceKraft; looking forward to visiting again soon.

Visited the place during the Durga Puja week and had a very good experience. There was a limited menu available but it was quite impressive. It was just the 2 of us, we had Coq Au Vin and Baked Fish Wellington as main courses and Green Chilli Chicken (Thai) as starter. 
The portions were nearly perfect for all 3 dishes. 
The Chilli Chicken was quite good : meat was soft and the spice mix was good although the lemongrass didn't quite come out. Overall quite nice. 
The Coq Au Vin was very good. Sauce was perfect, mushrooms and chicken were cooked quite nicely and went well with the rice.
The Baked Fish was the best of the lot though. Really well cooked bhetki fillets in an amazing cheese based sauce which again went very well with the saffron rice. 

The 2 mocktails were also quite nice and refreshing, especially the Tangerita (the chilli was quite a clever touch).

Although we were served water and given the menu a good 5-6 minutes after we sat down, the service for the rest of the afternoon was quite good. The staff were polite and smiling, making the whole experience a very satisfactory one. Shame we didn't have room for dessert! 

Would recommend this place to everyone. The location of the restaurant helps as it is easily accessible and parking is available in front.

Spice Kraft is located near Hazra Law College in Ballygunge Phari. It is the same place where 'The Silver Oak' and 'Tandoori Nights' used to be. Catching on the trend of Molecular Gastronomy, this is I think the second restaurant in the city, after Gabbar's, serving it. I'd got a complimentary voucher worth Rs. 1000 from Zomato as an appreciation from them for my reviews. I've been here twice already. We'd ordered many things (Check photographs attached in the review for details) and liked most of it. Chef Sambit Banik was very kind & courteous. He came to our table every now and then to make sure that everything was great and kept asking for our suggestions regarding the food and his restaurant. It gives total value for money. Will go back soon!

Chef Shambit is talented and has too many experiences too share.
Food is excellent if you are ready to experiment.  We had Deconstructed Papdi Chaat and bikaniri aloo Tikki chaat...both are very regular starters to sound but over here....its is very different to taste. 
Then we had Safed daal Morada badi, Subz Lababder, kele Ke Phool Ke Croque Monsieur with multigrain roti. Multi grain roti was light as papad. Safed daal has humble appearance but Royal taste. Subz Lababder is regular curry to comfort you on table where you are experimenting several tastes. 
We ended with 100% Jack Daniel S&Barry callebaut and cointrue orange White coco parfait. My friends loved it...me being a on a diet still hogged my share of guilt.
Washroom is tiny and parking is sufficient. Interiors and ambience is very romantic. Bill even after being overfed by chef Shambit...is very reasonable.
This restaurant is redefining food culture of Kolkata

Today we had dinner in Spice Kraft and what a fantastic experience we had. We started with a deconstructed papri chaat and blown away with the taste. This is something very unique I had in a long time. This is highly recommended. Then we tried various starters like Bacardi infused tandoori chicken sausage, Beer can Tempura fish and Pork ribs Burrah Kabab. Each  one of them was delicious. For me the tandoori chicken sausage and the burrah kabab were amazingly tasty. For main course we had Coq Au Vin and Baked Fish Wellington and these were awesome too. I should specially mention the cocktails and here they serve some of the best cocktails in Kolkata. What I liked most is the personal touch of Chef Sambit and his passion of serving unique and great food. Definitely coming back for more.

Spice Kraft, true to its tagline, is really all about the art of good taste!! Situated in Ballygunje Phari (and very easy to locate), the place welcomes you with warm hospitality. The space inside is not much...but the decor with mirrored walls intercepted by these intricate designwork which light up and a glass cabinet showcasing wine and whisky bottles somehow gives the place a classy feel. Also I firmly believe that good food should always be accompanied by good music and the place takes care of just that- charting out beautiful instrumentals while you slowly dig into their sumptuous delicacies. Yes, without further ado, coming to the food..we ordered bacardi limon infused chicken sausages, pork ribs burrah kebab and dajaj chermoula. Dajaj chermoula is a lebanese dish with chicken marinated with chermoula spices and char grilled-the chicken is so tender it melts in your mouth. The pork ribs were absolutely delicious and the chicken sausages deserve full points for their unique presentation and taste. We also ordered one of the molecular mojitos- tangy mandarin and lemon grass schocker and boy, was it good (they clearly know how to mix their drinks)!!! For main course, we were served shepherd's pie and baked fish wellington. The good ol' shepherd's pie was cooked to perfection and the soft boneless bhekti shrouded in cheesy goodness and served on a bed of rice will caress your tastebuds. Unfortunately, due to an untimely power cut, we had to finish our meal without desserts. The service over there is as good as it can be, the waiters are really helpful and the chef cum owner himself comes to your table to interact with you and ask for your feedback. I really appreciate this personal touch. Waiting to come back here again for another delectable experience! Keep up the good work!

Located not very far away from Hazra Law College, we found Spice Kraft to be a pleasant and interesting little place which is trying to carve out it's name in a niche market of molecular gastronomy while trying to maintain a pocket friendly relevance.

The area is divided in two portions. The more family friendly and brightly lit area as you enter through the main door and the blue tinted inner chambers which are mostly offered to the male crowd interested in boozing. The place tries to maintain a touch of suaveness and style in it's decor and ambiance. But it is a challenge to offer a taste of affordable fine dining when some of the patrons still have the sole mindset of availing good booze in a relatively cheaper price. The servers & waiters were friendly & helpful but a few of them looked a tad bit inexperienced.

Moving on to the food, for starters we ordered a Beer Can Tempura Fish & cheese covered Kele Ke Phool Ke Croque Monsieur. Both came prettily presented and with specific accompanying dips, Orange Ponzu Tartare & Aamchur Creme Fraiche. Though maybe a little low on quantity, the starters were fun and tasty. The beer battered fish was fresh & piping hot & just the right amount of crunchy on the outside. The cheese bathed Mocha'r Bora tasted pretty nice too. The fancy named dips tasted intricate & subtle in the flavors. Nice, but they might not appeal to everyone's preference.

We had ordered a Nasi Goreng (the Indonesian/Malaysian version of our fried rice)& a Pork in Rendang Curry (again an Indonesian dish where it is mainly beef that is slow cooked and caramelized over a long simmering process) for mains. No complaints here. Spicy, delicious and having a strong identity, both of the dishes stood out and quickly became our favorite.

Still not completely full, we decided to order a Baked Fish Wellington where two magnificently succulent pieces of Vetki were laid on a bed of Saffron Rice Pilaf (On it's own, the pilaf was average but brought out the taste of the fish when had in combination) and were covered in a thick cheesy sauce. Rich but not overwhelming, this is recommended¬†for those who are not afraid of a generous dose of cheese and want to taste a mean fish.

Our total bill came to 1387 INR for 5 dishes including taxes. An enjoyable experience that left us content and happy. Hoping somehow their starter section will be a bit attentive on the quantity issue. Would gladly recommend this to the foodies on Zomato :)

Spice Kraft has been on my wish-list from the time it has opened. It's very y near my college ( Department of Law,C.U). If you are coming from Ballygunge Phari walk from the Auto stand towards Hazra, and it will fall on your left. The owner, Chef Sambit was very warm and friendly and suggested us what to order! We ordered a Cosmopolitan, Long Island Ice Teas, and another one which I don't remember. The drinks are cheaper than most places, and are very well made. I ordered Coq-Au-Vin for the main course. It was chicken cooked in red wine and served with butter rice. The food was really delicious. I don't know a lot about French food and had no idea what it should taste like. But to me, it was perfect! The ambiance is nice, and the service is good too. The variety of cocktails available and the low price is the USP of the restaurant. Give it a try.

The behavior of the chief chef was very good and welcoming and warm as well. The music was good and soothing which included some nice instrumentals of John Denver, Bon jovi songs. The continental dishes were awesome, specially the coq-au-vin. We enjoyed the visit. I'd definitely go again. Don't know about the liquor because we went on a dry day. Try out the entr√©es , they truly come as appetisers.

After reading a lot of great reviews, we walked in to SpiceKraft with high expectations and were not disappointed. Very conveniently located on Hazra Road, the interiors of the restaurant are pretty with quirky lights decorating the walls. They were playing good music which is always a good combination with good food and drinks. The food was delicious and the cocktails even better. The Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab and the Beer Can Tempura Fish are a must try. Among cocktails, the Choco Beam and Kokum Rita were refreshingly different and very well mixed. The Sangria too, was just perfect- chilled and with just the right amount of fruit and sweetness. For main course we had Devilled Crab, Nasi Goreng, Moon Fan, Pork in Rendang Curry and Spicy Orange Peel Chicken. Everything, especially the Devilled Crab, the Pork and the Chicken was excellent. Another plus point is that they are quite generous with their servings at SpiceKraft. Desserts were not available on the Pujo Special Menu but on our requests the chef obliged and served us Jack Daniels and Barry Callebaut Swiss Chocolate Mousse with Drunken Pet√Æt Fours. This is a beautiful dessert; the mousse flavourful, smooth and light, the Pet√Æt fours moist and the orange reduction adding the perfect tang to balance the sweetness. It was an amazing experience and I look forward to going back to SpiceKraft, hungry for more. I am sure with their full menu on offer, it is only going to add to this experience.

Highly Recommended.

USP: Chef and Owner Sambit, Cocktails

Went for lunch on Saptami. Amazing food. The continental dish ( sorry ¬†i forgot the name) was just amazing so was the cocktail. Would like to visit the place again to taste the other continental dishes.
There i met the wonderful chef Mr. Banik. Mr. Banik please take a bow for your achievment. It takes guts to follow your passion. Keep rocking and satisfying your foodie customers. Good luck

One of the best places to find authentic cuisine in India,  and why not! Chef Sambit wears his passion on his sleeves and leaves no stone unturned in delivering taste and flavour true to the roots of the dishes that he serves.

Amazingly good food and very good service as well as ambiance. Very rarely does it happen that all the "experimental" dishes ordered turns out to be good but here they were all quite fabulous. The cocktails deserve special mention and so does the 'dajaj charmoula' A must visit!

Visited this place on Durga Puja. It's a medium sized restaurant with soothing ambiance. They play sober music but the volume was bit loud.Coming to food. In starter, we ordered Pork ribs burrah kebab, Mahi malai kebab (loveeed it) , Sarson wali machli. The main course included Moon Fan and Nasi Coreng (two plates each) and with that Prawn in fragrant coriander sauce ( Awesome), Spicy orange peel chicken and Roasted pork and Rendang Curry. Food quality and quantity and taste were very satisfactory. The restaurant staffs and chef were very cordial as well.Now the MOST important thing, pocket pinch. were six people and i was really surprised to see the bill came 3600 which included three Mocktails and two Carlsberg as well.¬†I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. The only reason i am not giving it a full marks is they took long time to serve.But i would say the food is worth for waiting few minutes.

While writing this review i am still in awe of the wonder kid on the block-Spice Kraft. What an innovation by Sambit-The master chef.Kudos. We ordered for Manhatten-classic cocktail with bourbon n vermouth (‚Çπ225) and tangy mandarin & lemon grass schock (‚Çπ175) in beverages. Just ummmmm in taste and the way they stirred the carbonated water in the schock in front of us is just something i bet kolkata havent seen before.
Coming to food we ordered for baked fish wellington (‚Çπ325), beer can tempura fish (‚Çπ225),dajaj charmoula (‚Çπ195),nasi goreng (‚Çπ165),prawn in fragnant coriander sauce (‚Çπ295).Baked fish wellington is something thats surely been made in heaven. Served with rice it tastes, looks and smells so good that words will fell short. This will give the big boys of park street a run for their money.Beer can tempura is unique in its presentation and is being served inside a budweiser can with a tangy orange sauce which will just increase your appetite.Dajaj Charmoula is fusion of traditional drums of heaven and Sambit's innovation and is being served uniquely in small containers with a little wooden plank inside. It consists of 4 pieces. Nasi goreng- the traditional thai rice is being done as it should be done and served with wayfers and egg-sunny side up. Unique indeed. The prawn in frangnant coriander sauce consists of 6 pieces of medium sized prawns and tastes great. We were too full for any desserts and will have next time we visit. Interiors have been nicely done. Music inside could have been better. The staffs are polite n courteous and requires a bit more professional approach. Signing off with a big round of thanks to Sambit for bringing this concept of Molecular Gastronomy to kolkata. Those who want to know what molecular gastronomy is...make it a point to visit Spice Kraft.

I went there with my friends during durga puja 2015. Food was delicious. The baked fish was mouthwatering. Though there were some issues with the service, but it happens even with the best restaurants in kolkata during Durga puja. They have this unique style of cooking and the foods are not mainstream like most other restaurants. I m planning to go again and people should definitely try it once.

I went to Spice Kraft with my family after seeing its high ratings on Zomato. The place had a nice ambience and tasteful lighting. The food turned out to be a pleasant surprise. I had initially assumed that it would be no different from north indian, continental and chinese food found in other restaurants. However, the spices used rendered it quite remarkable. In particular, I'd like to mention two dishes- Coq-au-vin, a chicken dish made with a little red wine and accompanied by rice, and Safed Dal Moradabadi; they were simply out of the world! The dal,¬† a combination of two dals and a mystery spice, was much better than any Dal Makhani.¬† The mocktail, Kiwi and Mango Collins was delightfully refreshing.
Another thing that I loved was the way the chef came out to personally greet all the customers and take their feedback. You'll seldom see this in any high-end restaurant. In fact, this place delivered the kind of food that, if eaten at at a high-end restaurant, would cost much more than it did at Spice Kraft. Whether you go with friends or family, Spice Kraft will surely delight you!

A lovely place with good ambience and can be easily located too. Went with friends twice and the first experience was so good it prompted me to visit this place again on the very next day. Beer Can Tempura Fish is a must for all the food lovers out there. The top notch quality just melts in your mouth. We also had Baked Fish Wellington and Crab Meat which were equally good. The presentation of the dishes satisfies the eyes and tempts your tastebuds for the exciting ride to follow. The chef was very cordial and suggestive with the dishes and that made it easier to order from the variety of "Treasures" they serve. Only service time may be improved and it would undoubtedly make the mark of a 5.0 starrer. Would surely recommend this place for a hearty meal, true to the words.

We wanted to add Spice Kraft to our pre-puja diner hopping list badly ! So, we decided to give it a try on a Tuesday, a little later in the evening at 9 PM, with a family of 5.

You cannot miss the diner located on Hazra Road opposite the newly constructed Quadra Pathology Laboratory. I made a reservation for our table and the person who answered the phone was very polite and even gave us suggestions for parking etc ...  Parking is not a problem, and the cars can be parked on Hazra Road KMC fee parking zone.

The restaurant is divided into two distinct sections ‚Äì one lighted dimly with blue light, the other with white light. We were asked to take our seats on the white lighted section. 

The decor was very very well crafted and we came to know from one of the waiters that Chef Sambit has personally instructed the entire refurbishment operations, when he bought the erstwhile Tandoori Nights over.

We knew beforehand, that there is a huge menu spread with continental, Indian, Chinese all available, since, this was our first time, we decided to stick to the tried and tasted Chinese and Indian entrees.

For starters, we ordered, chicken malai kebab and sarson wali machchi. Both items were very well prepared. Succulent, well-cooked, spiced perfectly.

For main course, we ordered, cheese nan, cheese garlic bread, veg augratin, penne alfredo pasta, chicken fried rice, hot garlic chow mein, hot garlic chicken and chicken with chilly oyster sauce.

A rather eccentric mix of continental and Chinese ! ! Chef Sambit came over multiple times and asked for our feedback on the food. He also suggested a couple of his signature dishes, which we kept it for our next visit !

Very well cooked food and well presented. Cutlery, silverware all of a fine standard, it was a pleasure to have the dinner. We ended our dinner with a classic monte-carlo and was well satisfied with the food !

All of the above within 2600 rupees !

A definite 4.5 and I am sure, it would improve more as Spice Kraft becomes even more popular.

Spicekraft is the latest addition to Kolkata's growing penchant for fusion food. Located at a stone's throw from Hazra Law college, this place can boast of providing quite a gastronomic journey to food enthusiasts. Ambience is nice with dim lights and soothing music, something you would expect for a peaceful meal (however, during my visit on Saptami evening, they did change the music to 90s Bollywood chartbuster a, which sadly was not quite in sync with the ambience). 
We were warmly greeted by the staff and soon after being seated, the chef (possibly the owner or one of the owners as well), Mr Shambit introduced himself and his vision of molecular gastronomy. I have limited knowledge on such stuff, but I could understand that it has something to do with titillating your senses through vision and smell of food.  He guided us through the food options (you have an abridged menu for the pujas though) and suggested us few of his innovative cocktails. So we start with Jack Black and Miller beer. I wnt say anything about the beer, but Jack Black was fab. For starters, Shambit got us beer can tempura fish and dajaj chermoula. Tempura fish was served in an interesting way, in a Budweiser can. Thin coating on the outside, delightful Kolkata Beckti on the inside. The tartar dip had a nice citrusy punch which complimented the thinly coated fry. I am having a hard time remembering when was the last time I had such a delightful Beckti fry. The dajaj chermoula is actually a Lebanese version of our very own tandoori chicken, but with a few delightful spices and a curd based dip. The starters were so good as to leave us wanting for more. 
The second round cocktails included mango driver and Chivas julep. The mango driver is a good take on our good old screwdriver, replacing orange juice with mango juice. It was a tad bit sweet, but nonetheless it was fab. The Chivas julep was a bit sour to my liking and that's possibly the only thing I am not happy about last night's meal. 
Now coming to the mains. Shambit got us a Coq-au-Vin and Baked fish Wellington. Cow-au-Vin is a roast chicken in spicy brown sauce with shallots and mushrooms. It's actually great to see Spicekraft dishing up spicy continental fare, coz continental fare is usually cheesy and creamy. I loved the chicken; the pieces were tender and juicy and had been marinated well. The baked fish was undoubtedly the star of the night. So creamy, so cheesy and great quality kolkata Beckti. I would go as far as saying that this is the best baked fish I have had (and I have tried quite a few continental eateries including Mocambo, Peter Cat and The Blue Door). 
Desserts were sadly not there; we were too full as well. 
Shambit dude, take a bow. You have given us something that can only get better with time. I'm surely going to your place soon to try out the alcoholic desserts and squids.

This place was a sudden plan and a suggestion from one of my friend. As this place is new and the reviews are good some interest has grown within us.And we were there yest for lunch. 1st about the location, which was easy to locate .It is some 30 secs walk from the Hazra law college. From outside thaugh it looks small but trust me wen u go inside it is another picture altogether. Nice decor and soothing lighting. Now the best part here which we Loved is that the waiter took all the time to explain us the dishes and the Chef himself was there to order in behalf of us which was a nice gesture. As they are new they were suggesting us their signature dishes which includes their special mocktails. Red grapes and mint and curry leaves. We jus loved them. For starter we ordered beer tempura fish and green chilly chicken which is is a must try. It was very unique and yummy. For main course we ordered chilly garlic noodles, goreng and orange peel chicken (suggested by the chef and the waiter )
This was something very uncommon with a sweetened aftereffect. I would recommend that it is a must visit if any1 wants something out of the regular dishes.
SPECIAL MENTION - I really felt like giving a 10 out of 5 (if possible) because of the conduct which we experienced in this place. And I feel that 50 % feels ur stomach. The chef personally took time to explain us not only his dishes but loads others including street foods. He is sooo cordial and thats wat makes this memorable foe all 3 of us. I would love to visit this place again with my family. :)

Went for lunch in this restaurant, it was semi-full at that time. Liked the cozy, soothing ambiance very much. Menu was pre-decided so ordered quickly but they took awful lot of time to bring the food but the wait was worth it, every food item was excellent, all had different taste & aroma.. We ordered mahi malai kabab, beer can tempura fish, green chilli chicken, masala kulcha, mixed fried rice, amritsari macchi and prawn in fragrant coriander sauce. All the items were delectable. Total bill for 3 was around rs 2000/ so can be called pocked friendly. Foodwise it is top notch but service can be improved, it can be more organised.. However we had very satisfactory meal there on the auspicious day of durgapanchami.

So visited this place on a Saturday afternoon at around 1pm. The location of this place is damn nostalgic cause it is situated opposite my college which is Dept. Of law, C.U. The place is moderate in size and neatly decorated. The staffs are cordial especially the chef who attended and helped us with the choice of our dishes. We had 5 starters and 1 dessert. In starters we ordered beer can tempura fish which was one of the best dish and I must say that the quality of the fish was top notch along with the lovely dip served along with it , in short the dish was a hit. Then came the limon infused tandoori chicken sausage though the dish was good and innovative but as it was served after the fish it did not meet my expectation which was way high after the first dish. My personal favourite was the murg malai kebab as it is the best malai kebab I ever had. It was so soft, succulent, topped with malai, an absolute delicious dish( I still dream about this dish in my sleep which is weird). Then we had the fire crackers( a Chinese preparation) which was not good and a bad choice on our part so wanted to try out another starter and after asking the chef we ordered dajaj chermoula and it was again yum in taste with wonderful flavours. The dessert we ordered was the 100% jack Daniels chocolate mousse and drunken petit four which was very innovative and for me it was something very new and I was not disappointed with it. The presentations of the dishes were really cool. The quality, quantity, innovations and the price will definitely make this place a hit . I will definitely return to this place for trying out the other items.

Spice kraft! Two words totally sums up my dining experience, those being fantabulous and mind blowing. I had this place on my wishlist from a long time and my desire to visit this place grew each time i read raving reviews about it on zomato. So, i along with my two friends decided to visit this place on a saturday afternoon! We were welcomed very cordially by the staff and got seated immediately. The decor here is  quite innovative and interesting. Frankly we were a little confused with our order,but chef Shambit came to our rescue and suggested us with the dishes we should opt for. We stuck to his opinion and didn't regret it at all. I was beyond mesmerized with all the dishes. We started with beer can tempura fries followed by malai kebabs(there was actual malai on it) and both just made us superhappy. The dishes were delicious to the core, the dips served along with it were quite innovative and simply lip smacking. We ordered 3 more dishes. There wss a chicken sausage dish,and a lebanese dish( don't remeber the exact names), but both were very yum. The only little miss of this place was the firecrackers. We ordered this dish with our hopes quite high, but this one failed to impress us. It was just simply fried chicken. So, just .5 marks deduction for the dish. However, we ended on a very sweet note. For the dessert (called boozerts here because of the alchohol content) we ordered the 100% jack daniels chocolate mousse , and this dish simply was the star. We were so impressed by the taste that we almost finished it within a minute. The quality of the food is something that this place should be extremely proud of. Congratulations to chef Sambit for such an honest effort. Moreover, the drinks served here are very reasonable and extremely cheap. The service was also quick and fast,something we did not expect after reading the reviews on zomato. Taken together, we had a lovely afternoon in this place and it gives the perfect feel of a place to@  hangout with friends. Definitely going back very soon to try some of the   interesting platters from their main course.

Had lunch at this cozy little joint the other day , was a friend's birthday , As we always do , we hogged on starters and drinks and decided to not waste our appetite on starches and carbs . The place is neat and clean and the staff was warm , welcomed us well, seated us well , and took orders nicely .¬†

Well, is your aren't eating any mains , there will be a lot of starters.

The Old Monk Chicken lollypops were to die for, the rum didn't overpower the chicken and came as a brilliant after taste .¬†

The green chili chicken was at par too .... ¬†gobbled a whole plate alone¬†

Next was The Beer Tempura Fish .... and the best presented dish .... came out of the beer can !!! the batter was crisp and not dense at all. delicious !¬†

The Khor Khog lamb , although tender was too greasy for my liking¬†

The Red pepper prawns tasted nice but were tad overcooked¬†

The reshmi malai was a brilliant kebab ... what makes it different from others is the fact the the cream on top has a very mind hint of kewra jal ! splendid !¬†

The burrah pork ribs looked stunning and were relished by the pork eaters¬†
and i was too full to eat crabs ¬†but they too were relished .¬†

Overall a place that has huge potential but if the service is faster it can do wonders !

We were hungry, and the time was around 4 in the evening. We found this restaurant in ballygaunge...looked nice from outside and even they had booze. We thought of giving a try. Trust me , it is one of the good restaurant in that area which is reasonable also ( if u are not having drinks). Good ambience, good hospitality and service. We orders some drinks and fish fry which was served in a very unique way. Which was giving a different look to the dish. We also ordered one chicken gravy and naan. The best was the desert , Monte carlo , it was awesome...I had never before had this kind of desert. It was combination of everything, chocolate, ice cream, crumbs. 
Overall I will suggest to give a try and order continental, which is there speciality.

Visited on a Sunday for dinner. Must say a great experience n I would definitely recommend others to visit it. It's a new concept in Kolkata whereby the chef takes care personally to make sure u have a different yet sumptuous meal. Thou the menu had less options for veg , the chef made sure we had enough options to try by taking personal care of every table.. Nasi Goreng an Indonesian rice dish n 100% Jack Daniel dessert are must try's.. Would recommend to chuck d all time fixed order n go as per Chefs recommendation after mentioning him your taste..

Then came along this wonderful new restaurant ,it not only has varied range of items on the menu, it also has the most affordable prices  along with nothing less than five star experience with the  right balance of taste and flavour ,the master chef has infused some very interesting presentation of the food that he serves .
Looking forward to some more interesting experiences in the near future :)

We entered SpiceKraft after hearing great reviews. I have to say, they make a great green chilli chicken and the chicken malai kabab was superb as well, as well as the beer battered fish. The pork burrah kabab was nice, but the meat was a bit too chewy. the aam panna and curry leaf mojito was stunning, but the service needs to be worked on. The place has quirky, fun designs, and the chef shows definite promise.

Life - thy name is Spice , or well in this matter Spice Kraft.
A couple of days back walked into this place with a friend for Lunch. We were 1st really impressed by the Decor. As it was a Hot afternoon we ordered Beer and a few starters from their vast menu.
For me - Mutton Halim Kibbeh (mutton and halim cooked into balls - Brilliant !!!)¬† and my friend a Red Pepper Prawn . Both the Starters turned out Excellent .
For Mains we ordered a Fried Rice and a unique side dish - spicy orange peel chicken - which was Mind Blowing. We did not hv room for Desserts. The food was simply Amazing.
I strongly recommend all Non Veg Lovers to visit this place... enjoy.. :)

Went here this evening and loved every moment of it. Let me start by saying that the chef, Sambit, is very friendly and will suggest the perfect combo of food and drinks for you. Trained in France, he has an innate understanding of food. The staff is very efficient and courteous as well. I went for the triple combo of Absolut based cocktails, and that really was awesome. I had a cranapple screwdriver, a guava Mary and a classic cosmopolitan at chef Sambit's suggestion. My friend had a combo of Black Dog. As for the food, we had pork ribs burra kebab and beer batter tempura fish with orange ponzu tartare. The presentation of the food is beautiful and the taste even better. I look forward to going there again very, very soon, and also very highly recommend this new place to my foodie friends. And I also wish chef Sambit all the best for not only his brand new restaurant, but also in his efforts to become a fully qualified sommelier and a renowned chef.

Service: When we entered the restaurant there was hardly anyone to guide us to the table. Secondly the server was not even know much about the menu, when we asked for his suggestion since it was our first time there he was totally blank.... 
Food: We tried some pork dish which i don't really remember the name but it were more or less like chilli pork which i don't find anything so great about. It's like those roadside preparation.
Drinks: Some Pina Colada drinks and some red grape drinks... trust me !! it's one of the most horrible drinks i ever had. Left the drinks after drinking few sips. Don't think I'll be visiting this place again...

I visited with friends for lunch yesterday after hearing good things about the place. Overall the food was pretty good and I enjoyed my meal. Where they fail however is service not lack of courtesy which I have no complaints for but time management. Despite repeated requests service was really slow and one dish came out at a time so some people were eating and others were waiting for their dishes. Waiters too were very polite but either failed to understand our instructions or did not communicate them to the kitchen for example for both starters and mains two guests were vegetarian and were served last while we non-vegetarians were served first and they just had to sit while we were stuffing ourselves this after repeatedly requesting the staff. Chef Sambit however was very warm and tried his best.

Coming to the food ... I loved the Soy Braised Drums of Heaven with Old Monk Flambe , Beer Can Tempura Fish , Pork Ribs Burrah Kebab , Green Chili Chicken and Murg Reshmi Malai all of which were very nice and I would unhesitatingly reorder on future visits. The Red Pepper Prawns and Khor Khog were decent prawns were overdone and slightly rubbery as a result and the lamb was nice but nothing to get excited about. Our veggie friends ordered Kafir Lime & Galangal rubbed Potato Tournades and Kotthu Porotata and both were average.
For our mains we ordered two portions of Deviled Crab which was very nice and Veg Fried Rice and Khoai Tay Potatoes which were nice enough.
Drinks we stuck to beer mainly but one guest ordered Aampanna & Curry Patta Shikhanji which was good.
I would like to go back and try some other items but only when I have time for a leisurely meal.What was disturbing is that beside our table of six there was only one other table with two ladies occupied despite which service was very slow so I do hope that they sort out the problem as overall I ate good food and look forward to trying some dessert as well on my next visit.¬†
Chef Sambit seems to be very passionate about his food and it is heartening to see new places with a twist come up in the city.

Me and my friend decided to give this place a try and so for Sunday lunch we ended up here. The place is located in ballygunje opposite to quadra medical and just before sharma.

The place is well made with nice decor and lighting. We ordered as per the chefs recommendations and i have to say we were not disappointed. The trend of molecular gastronomy is on the rise and this place tries to cash in on that as well. 

I had the fish which was absolutely exquisite. I have not eaten something as delicious in a very long time. My friend had noodles and a vegetarian side dish which were also really good. And to end the meal we had this jack daniels infused dessert which truly was out of this world. By far the best of the afternoon.

I do have a little complaint in the drinks they serve. My friends drink, guava mary tasted like guava juice and not a cokctail. On request they made it stronger after which it was a tad too strong. I ordered for a mojito which was good.

Our bill was around 1500 which is cheap considering all that we ordered. A big thumbs up to the chef and his team. A repeat visit soon !!

Spice Kraft! Indeed a lovely new place to visit for all continental lovers. The outlet is beautifully decorated with a soothing ambiance. The staff here are extremely cooperative and friendly. The chef himself helped us choose the right dishes and drinks. The food was garnished well which makes foodies like us love to eat the even more. The food tasted really good thanks to the expert chef! I visited the place on a Sunday evening. Initially it was not crowded but eventually people started pouring in. This is when it had become a bit disappointing to us since the staff were puzzled and could not handle the crowd well. Hence service became extremely slow. I would have otherwise given an extra 0.5 rating had the staff handled their customers well. Highly recommended place...a must visit for food lovers! :)

Few restaurant owner's or the head chefs come forward to speak to the customers. Chef Sambit made enough efforts to win our hearts.. Good food can be made available, but if there's no proper presentation, it fails to satisfy the hunger of all the senses.. The jargons used by him may bounce over your head, but makes you feel good..
We tried few amazing foods.. I will write in detail as comments on the pics..
Starter -
Decontructed papri chat
Dajaj charmoula
Khor khoj
Mains- 
Coq - Au - vin
Baked bhetki wallington

Rediscovering the subtle journey of taste, Spice Kraft is located on a busy but not congested neighbourhood of the city. The chef has experimented with the menu and knows his business damn well. As you look through the pages, the section of infusion and molecular gastronomy is very likely to catch one's attention.
I had a brilliant innings of food and cocktail at Spice Kraft. Be it the Dejaj Chemoula (er...could be a spelling error) or the Kele ke phool se croquet (a marriage of French concepts into Indian food) the items were prepared and served with immense passion. And for all the cocktail lovers...the place has a collection which can put the 5*s to shame. Black Jack is a must try...and so is the Manhattan. And as you get on high spirits you can nibble into some Beer battered tempura fish which comes with a very innovative presentation.
All in all...this is one of the finest additions to our city's array of restaurants and Chef Sambit and his team deserves a standing ovation for making this happen. The chef says that he is going to launch a surprise in the winters (perhaps a new menu with many more jewels that appeal to fine taste) and Oh boy! I can't wait...

I had an opportunity to visit the restaurant with a friend of mine for lunch today.... at the outset the chef who is the owner himself introduced us about the place and i was mesmerized! The ambiance is great with plush interiors. They have a superb wine cellar and collection! The menu is great with plethora of choices for both Vegeterian and Non- Vegeterian foodies.

We left the choice of our food on the chef and to my belief the food was simply sumptuous!!! The menu has delicacies from recipes across Indian Heritage. I recomend to try the Tangarita...simply awesome! I highly recommed the place to all looking for fusion foods and Diverse menu! I am sure you will not regret!

5 visits in a span of 2-3months & a full 5 rating sums up the review i guess. There shouldn't be any specific recommendation. Just meet Chef Sambhit & leave the rest on him to bother. The prices wont pinch at all & the experience ¬†surely would FORCE u to come back. This is for me the best PORK option in the city.. The Pork Rib Barra kaabab's & Hong Shao Rou are to die for.

Went to spicekraft yesterday with a few friends. The hospitality extended to us was excellent. We had made a booking and called later to postpone the reservation which they graciously accommodated. Chef Sambit, the owner and head chef, himself greeted us and helped us with his suggestions. For starters, we especially liked their veg gilouti kebab (can't recall the name). However, their other starters were just warm and not piping hot like we expected. We ordered wine which was not cold but room temperature. For main course, we ordered one of their signature dal preparation and paneer. Paneer was ok but the dal was fabulous. Liked their zafrani sheermal as well. Did not have much space for desserts which we would definitely try the next time along with their cocktails. Overall, good but with a lot of scope for improvement. The waiters were just serving us but did not seem to know much about the signature dishes but it could be because the chef himself came to us and took the order so we did not get a chance to interact with the waiters. Food could definitely be a little hotter. Waiting to try their cocktails and desserts.

Spicekraft is easily amongst the best culinary
Experience in Kolkata. Chef and owner Mr.Sambit personally looks after your requirements and it can be safely said that his goodness just rubs on to the food and the overall experience. Items to look out for are the white dal moradabadi (simply out of the world), kele ke phool ke croquet and 100% jack Daniel( sheer boozert delight). Not that the other items were any less, in fact every item we ordered left us wanting some more. Thank You Sambit, we had a great time.

Came to know about this restaurant from zomato! After visiting the place, couldn't believe that it was 12 days old only! Was shocked as a new restaurant with a fully operational bar, is not often seen in Kolkata! From the word go, the warmth n hospitality of the owner, who is also the head chef is exceptional! When I called to make a reservation, the person on the phone was very polite n well mannered. So I was really looking forward to my dinner. The chef pays a lot of attention n gives lots of suggestions on the beverages n food! 
I wanna make special mention of the few dishes, which I felt were very flavoursome -
Green chilly chicken
Red pepper prawns
Devilled crabs
Rendang chicken curry! 

And in the cocktails
Hammer jack is not to be missed!

Good luck! Cheers

Had been to this really nice restaurant with a friend of mine. The location is very comfortable to track and we could spot it easily. upon entering the joint, we were pleased with the decor. We left everything at the choice of the chef who guided us through a beautiful journey of taste. He suggested us on having "Hammerjack" which turned out to be a beautiful drink. We were amazed with the way it was presented to us. The starters and the main course were also suggested by him. I would definitely like to have the grilled fish with the lemon sauce (i hope i am right with the name) again here. The food was perfectly cooked, presented and served. We had expected the things to be good, but when we got the check, we were surprised that we ate such lovely things and paid so less!! I have loved the place and will definitely come back.

SpiceKraft... Simple ambience, feels easy on the eyes, relaxing. I didn't order anything of my choice and left the entire decision to the chef. Expected good food but it came out brilliant. A white dal for the main course recommended. Starters - I can't even recall the name but a bruschetta kinda thing topped with eggs were class apart. Prices are quite soft on the pocket. The owner who happens to be the head chef has pulled off a good show. Warm food but Warmer People. Might drop in again soon... Thanks

I had high expectations from this place and they totally met it! We called for a leanest chicken drumstick kebab... Ah juicy and smoky! Loved it. Then came in a beer batter fish which was the best I've had in ages and unlike other places it was not very oily. A crab dish was the next..  I was always reluctant on having crab and I loved it at the first instance. We odered 2 cocktails... A mango driver tasted better than the original screwdriver and a kokum margarita which was nice. We finished up our meal with a Jd mouse... Woah just perfect that it was. Chef sambhit would make you fell extremely pampered :) kudos to u chef!

Just 2 steps from the Ballygunge Phanri more and almost opposite of the Hazra Law College is SpiceKraft operated by Chef Sambit . This is the second visit for me to the place and I can certainly say that I will be visiting more and more . The ambience is quite easily for the family crowd , but I had also gone stag in my first visit . The first thing to notice is that they have a interesting wine collection , a bar , and from my past experiences , they definitely know their liquor .¬†
But once you get past that , you will come across their amazingly diverse food menu. ¬†I do eat out a lot , and I was extremely happy to see such a diverse and well thought of menu - from continental , to Asian and Middle Eastern as well as Indian . In a restaurant like this where the Chef personally ( as of date ) caters to the guests , I try to start by eating their recommendations .Not only was it a pleasure to eat the delicacies he recommended but it was also quite interesting to hear about the history or origin of the items such as the Kottu Parota or the 100% Jack Daniel Barry Callebaut and the likes. In our dinner tonight I also had a Manhattan and my wife had a Sangria and it was really up there . While Chili Chicken is a very regular food item in Kolkata , their twist of Green Chili Chicken was once again really likeable and yet different .

Located just opposite to Hazra Law College this restaurant features some of the selected dishes in Continental, Asian and 
Indian¬†cuisines. Beside this there are some¬†special fusion¬†entr√©es¬†in the menu. Food wise new and simple concepts are used¬†to prepare ¬†the dishes.¬†

As suggested by the restaurant personnel we have ordered for Infused Tandoori Chicken Sausages in the¬†Entr√©e¬†followed by Kottu Parotta ¬†a kerelan delicacy accompanied by another kerelan delicacy "Meen Moilee". Taste wise liked the mint and bacardi fusion chutney used in the Infused tandoori chicken¬†sausages, in Kotthu Parotha the shredded paratha along with egg and spices is really a new twist in the dish. Meen moilee a simple green coconut based curry.¬†

To conclude one can say that decor is nice and food is concept wise excellent and presentation is awesome.

We went for a family dinner on 11th sept, reaching there we noticed the ambience was juat about ok. The way it was all represented by chef we got all excited about our meal. But sadly this turned out to be dissappinted for us. Main course was just ordinary with good names and branding but less on the quality. I am giving a rating of 3 just to give them another chance to improve as this is a newly opened restaurant.

I came across Spicekraft in the newly opened section on Zomato and after checking out the pictures and reviews posted on the app I wanted to try this place. It is located on the main road itself so finding this place wasn't difficult at all. This place has a really nice ambience. They have 3 dining rooms in total, each exhibiting a different theme. The decor is nice and there's soothing music playing in the background.
The staff made an extra effort to point out to us as to which dishes were their recommended ones and they also mentioned they have been experimenting with food as they have recently started their operations. We went by their recommendations and ordered Dajaj Chermoula and Pork ribs Burrah Kebab for starters. The presentation was impeccable and the food was extremely delicious. It was different and the dips both of these dishes were served with made it an exceptional combination. For main course we ordered kotthu parotta which was a new name for us along with Nawabi Dum ki murg. The paratha was prepared very differently and was cut into thin strips and fried with egg and coriander. It was brilliant. We had never tasted something like this before. It was superb.
For desserts we ordered 100% Jack Daniel S & Barry Callebaut which was also recommended by them.
@Chef Sambit- It was a pleasure meeting you and it was great to see that you make an effort to interact with your customers and get a feedback from them. The food speaks for itself and we wish you all the best . It was a delightful experience visiting your restaurant.
Also. I must mention the staff@ were very cordial and helpful.
Looking forward to visiting this place more often. A great experience indeed! :D

well....happened to visit kolkata for a couple of days and went to this place on my friends recommendation who told me he knows the chef personally....it was easy to reach this place which is located just around hazra law college near ballygunge phari....the ambience and music was a relief (especially from the awful kolkata heat & bustle outside)....the menu looked inviting and elaborate given a number of dishes from pan asian cuisine ranging from lebanese to vietnam and so on....i was also struck by the new concept of MOLECULAR MIXOLOGY!!! an inventive  way of presenting drinks....i ordered a dajaj charmoula and bacardi limon infused tandoori chicken sausages....for drinks we ordered a milkmaid chaitini and smoked pineapple cocktail....the food plating and presentation was fantastic with considerable portions....both the dishes turned out to be very tasty and went well with the drinks....at the end of the meal we were surprised when  the chef met us and spoke at length about his philosophy of presenting food in an art form....the place is very reasonably priced..... kudos to the chef at spicekraft for introducing such dishes under one menu to the food lovers in kolkata.....a great food experience...thanks to my friend!

Walked to this awesome restaurant opposite Hazra Law College with a few friends after reading from The Telegraph, which then I got to know specialises in molecular mixology. 
I must admit it is one of the finest places to wine and dine in South Kolkata. Perfect ambience, exotic cocktails, mind blowing food and an excellent collection of Indian and imported wines. Was actually dumbstruck. Unbelievable and reasonable pricing was icing on the cake. Ha! ha!
Got a chance to meet the Chef cum Owner Mr. Sambit who ensured that we were looked after well which ensured that our adventure for trying new places was worth every penny spent. Being an eggatarian one should definitely try the Chef's special entr√©es Egg Foo Yong Canap√©s and Bikaneri Aloo Frites. My non vegetarian friends enjoyed the Lebanese style cooked fish - Lemon Samak and beautifully presented chicken drumsticks- Dajaj Charmola. 
The lady in the group loved her Tequila based cocktail called Kokam Rita while we guys sipped on our whiskies and beers. The Chef's signature entr√©es described as Asian Heritage - French Techniques caught my eye and this makes the place a fantastic joint for people who love their food and drink. 
Would strongly recommend and look forward to go again and again to try whatever we missed out.
Overall an evening well spent (in all senses)!!!!!
