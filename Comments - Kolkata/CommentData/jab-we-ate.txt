I had ordered a party cake from Jab We Ate and trust me I have never ever tasted such an yummy cake. The decoration was nicely done, very beautifully made. The delivery was 20 mins delayed but then its okay as we wanted our cake to reach safely. I will defintely order again and looking forward to some amazing mango desserts next week.

First of all the name is so unique. I am in love with the name JAB WE ATE.. I ordered for my bhabhi's baby shower party and get together and they served us with superb cuisines and delivery was right on time. .. We ordered pesto pasta, american burgers, coron bleu cutlets, etc and everything was mind blowing.. everyone loved it.. pls start in Mumbai soon..

We got the birthday party catering done from Jab We Ate. We had selected a typical hi-tea menu. At first I was skeptical to try a new venture but then when they started their service at my place, it was mind blowing. All the food were served hot and it had a perfect buffet setup. All the staff were well dressed. Highly recommended.

My best friend's birthday would have been incomplete without the amazing cake made by them. It looked amazing and tasted even better. 
Perfect finishing. It was handed over to me on time too. Plus they were very cooperative. Way too impressed by JabWeAte.
