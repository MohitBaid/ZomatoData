Last order yesterday of the restaurant at 11pm. Any other one wouldve told their kitchen is close, but the guys here courtesly asked the chef and called us in.
Minus the God level hot in the Do-piaza, everything was superb. I'll surely want places like this to do my H better, coz they server very good food for the best rates possible around.

I love vegetable biryani and roll from delight Kitchen but it’s like quite far away from our office so open a new outlet near minto park. Thank you
