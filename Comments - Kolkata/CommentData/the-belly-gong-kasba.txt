I love their thai, and since I'm a spice lover, I frequently order shapta chicken. Very amiable who never say no to any special requests. No matter what I try, they never fail to satisfy my hunger needs.

Ordered chilly baby corn and pan fried noodles at night. The delivery was on time, but the food was really harsh on the tongue. The soup for the noodles was very salty and the baby chilli corn was anything but crispy and chilly. It seemed like the chef ran out of the spicy sauce and fried the baby corn with tomato sauce or something. It was really tangy. Rated 2 only because of on time delivery. It's a joke and not at all value for money

Is this the way you create the soup with momo??? If yes then hire me . I have never cooked but im sure i'l be able to prepare better dishes than your salaried cook. I have been a customer of zomato for a very long time but this is the worst soup with momo i have ever had or i will have . And by the way learn to pack first before opening a resturant. Thank you for a good lesson.

A spontaneous dinner get together with friends. Decided to have chinese food. The choice was between Belly Gong and Red Bamboo Shoot. However we settled down with the belly gong. Once I called the resturant to order but the party was canceled. So we decided to have food from this place.
We ordered Dry chilli chicken , chicken in oyster sauce , chicken thupka , chicken gravy noodles and egg fried rice.

This place is primarily a take away joint. Now coming to the food.
The dry chilli chicken was good, tender chicken chunk tossed in sauce, the chicken in oyster sauce had peas and mushrooms, the sauce was salty, and chicken was in huge chunk. The fired rice was bad, the rice had a bad smell, and very lightly spiced just rice and egg not a single veggies. The chicken thupka looked nice but had a fishy smell, had small pieces of chicken and big chunk of veggies. The gravy chowmine was also not up to the mark, the only veggie was bell peppers.
Not so good. Need to work on menu and preparations. Can be better.

Never been here in person and my review is on the basis of home delivery solely. To keep it short.... food is good. The soup specially the lemon coriander soup was very well done. The Chicken Hot and Sour soup was good too. For starters we had ordered Chicken Lollipop, Chilli Chicken Dry and Golden Fried Prawns. The first two were decent but the Golden Fried Prawns were a bit disappointing. They were fried and then tossed in some sauce similar to the one used for Chicken Lollipop. Well the sauce took a bit of sheen off the Prawns and frankly it was not the Golden Fried Prawns that we have been used to all the while. The other items ordered for main course were of the correct standards. To conclude, if they keep working hard and if they correct the minor flaws, then surely they are going to be around for a long time.

The restaurant is a tiny joint located right on the main road. We decided to order from this place one fine night. 

Things we ordered were :

Golden fried babycorn - It was fried quite well and tasted nice and light.

Chicken fried rice - Decent portion of chicken and egg pieces in perfectly cooked rice.

Garlic chicken with gravy - The sauce was too much. Did not like it.

Corn fried rice - Loved it

Dry chilly chicken - It was too sweet instead of being spicy.
 
Hot and sour soup - Quite good

Fried chicken momo - Not good at all

I visit the place whenever I'm around the area and often order online as my wife loves their fish in chilly plum sauce, takrai and momos. The couple combo is my all-time favorite as its a good deal for a 5-course meal. And I never mind a mocktail sip for a take-away.
These guys are doing a good job with the food and I wish them all the very best!

First time I visited there. The place is too small to occupy many people. The chairs and tables are very small as well. The quality of the food was not at all satisfactory. We ordered Drums of Heaven but it was like totally fried chicken without any kind of sauce in it. It was ridiculous. The service was too bad as they were least bothered with their customers. They were busy in their own work rather than serving to the customers. There were no proper crockeries as well to serve and they were dirty. This was my first and last visit to this outlet. The ambience was too disturbing.

Yesterday we visited this place for lunch. Seating is the major problem better for takeaway. Very small place for dine-in. This place wasn't very clean and no ambience and no decor. Ordered
• Fried momo
• Wok tossed special chicken fried rice
• Chicken Manchurian

Momo stuffing was good and tasty but momo little bit undercooked. Wok tossed rice was no flavour at all. Too plain and simple. Just mixed up with chicken and egg. Rice quantity was lass compare to other places. Manchurian chicken was good in taste but didn't like the flavour of chopped coriander leaves. Chicken pieces was little bit chewy texture.
But main problem of their staffs. Staff wasn't trained. They didn't serve plate and spoon separately. Even they didn't serve a glass of water. Service was slow not that good. Overall it was a bad experience.
BEST OF LUCK( for future)...!!! 😊👍👍

I visited this place last night and was very much hungry. I am frequent in that area and found that there is a new food joint by the street. I went in and without much thinking I ordered a plate of mixed hakka noodles but was confused about what to order as a side dish. So the lady suggested to have Teriyaki Chicken, which was one of their signature dish. The noodle was average in taste but I found the Chicken dish very much tasty and it was crispy too. Now about the ambience and look of the place, it was just okay. It was a small joint and was recently opened so it will get better with the ambience & look later on...

Ordered Wok Tossed Special Chicken Fried Rice and Shapta Chicken Dry. There was nothing special about the fried rice but it was good. The Shapta was spicy as hell and it was meant to be, it is a Tibetan dish. It is for those who like very spicy food and for non-spicy food lovers don't you dare to try it. Anyways, it was overall nice tasty food.

•Darshan with ice cream (though they didn't serve ice cream saying that, that was a mistake in nearbuy menu.)
  Coming to food..soup was not so good. We had already tasted this soup much better than their's.
Double fried chicken was tasty. Fried rice was too dry and chicken side dish was ok.. Only Darshan didn't satisfy me though I'm a sweet lover..
    Accommodation is small though they can manage and utilise that place more impressively ... Management should be better.. Specially their service.
Which I didn't even like, they served the soup only on a bowl with spoon, starter was served in a plate and that's all.. They didn't serve plates separately . Same situation with the rice also...but after sometime they gave us an extra plate... 
One suggestion for the owner- small place can be presentable with some nice simple decor.. And obviously the service is the key of restaurant business..
Good luck for this newly opened restaurant..hope it will be better and then we will go again.. 😊

Tried this place last evening on my way to meet family, and packed Chicken Takrai on their suggestion. I was so impressed that i chose to pack my dinner too on my way back. Very quick service, ten mins to get 3 course meal packed.  Referring this place to everyone i know who visit the area. I couldn't help putting my feedback on their cute little bulletin board.

Visited this place today for having lunch. This is a very small restaurant with maximum seating capacity of 8 people at a time. Nothing to say about the ambiance and decor. All I expected the foods to be nice but It didn't fulfill my expectations. As we had a nearbuy coupon our today's menu includes,
* Hot n Sour Soup
* Double Fried Chicken
* Veg fried rice
* Hot Garlic Chicken
* Darsaan
Hot n sour soup was served first and it tasted quite blunt with a weird smell. I ate it adding vinegar and pepper otherwise it was not edible at all. Then the double fried chicken was served and this was the only item I liked in today's food session. In the main course there was veg rice with hot garlic chicken. The rice was extremely dry and tasted too blunt. Comparatively the chicken main course was just good but nothing extraordinary. If the foods tasted pretty good then the other things like service, ambiance can be overlooked but if the food is not so good then it's just not worth a visit. Moreover they didn't provided us the vanilla ice cream as mentioned in nearbuy offer. They said that in that amount of money they could only serve darsaan but not the ice cream as mentioned in the nearbuy menu. For me the experience was not good so definitely not going back. And also they must take a look about the hygiene of the place.

Friendly Courteous flexible and tasty .. u dnt have to worry abt ur food being unhealthy as they boast of food without MSG and very well made neither overcooked nor undercooked as I experienced in few Chinese joints .. even the right balance of sweet and spice by default :)

What more to say when u get food that comes in your budget and along with a good service, also you can enjoy the coziness of the place with your friends and dates!
The most highlighting dish was the honey walnut prawn, and concluded with darshan, my all time favourite!
The rate was quite decent, and was quite easy to locate as recommended by a friend. Will be here again, soon!

I have bought Chinese Hakka noodles egg chicken and it was awesome... And must try the firni... But truly saying the sapta chicken was mind blowing but should b tried in the chillicious winter because of its hotness... Over all really nice food station for pocket friendliness and delicious food..
