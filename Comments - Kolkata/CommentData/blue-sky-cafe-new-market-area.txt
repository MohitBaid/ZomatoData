Gist : A medium sized place with average tasting pizza, cheaply priced with respect to quantity. Has a wide range of breakfast options.

I visited this place on 07-01-18 at 10.00AM. Easy to locate. It is medium sized but with a seating capacity of 44 person (3*2 + 4*3 + 4*2 + 4*3 + 2*3). They do not have a toilet but a washbasin is there. Staffs are cordial. But they have only 2-3 staffs, who are outnumbered to serve that big crowd. Ordered Large Sized Normal Crust Canadian Ham Pizza. With respect to preparation time, serving time is good but can improve. But taste has to improve a lot. Also crust is thinner. Kindly note the fact that within that price range (INR 300- 450) there are many restaurants who offer great pizza in Kolkata. Hoping for a better experience next time.

This place is visible very clearly just as one enters the sudder street .
A hidden gem at the heart of Kolkata has a versatile menu on Continental​, Indian ,Italian Pizzas and Breakfast, Lunch menu.
Surprisingly enough both Indian and Continental cuisine is worth trying here. 
They have maintained the food quality and Quantity keeping the price at a very affordable rate and especially to attract foreign customers who are seen frequently here .
I went with my friend from Germany who tried the Indian Vegetarian cruisine and he loved it while I tried Chicken Steak and I loved what they served .
I recommend you to definitely go to this place with a gang of friends and have a feast .

P.s- They serve variety of Italian pizza that I highly recommend to all of you .

The only place i believe where i can go even at the end of the month and tight on pocket.  The vommon joint where all the Oberoi Grand  love to gather after a tiring shift for breakfast or to spend the evening for some light snacks. 
Their KENTUCKY BURGER, JUMBO BURGER, SANDWICHES, FRESH JUICES, and my all yime favourite Chicken cheese omlete is absoluty worth the money..... I keep on recommending this place to each one of my friend and love to keep coming back over and over here again.

This place is located opposite to Raj Spanish Cafe in Sudder street. Well, the exterior and interior do not look too catchy or fancy but in terms of food and service, it is too the point. We had our breakfast today and the service is fast and staffs are friendly. Pocket pinch is not that much.

This restaurant is a favourite of mine to visit whenever I'm in the Esplanade area. Tucked away in a corner of Sudder Street through the alley beside the Indian Museum, it's been around for a long time, providing good quality and quantity of food at very reasonable prices.
Today we ordered a Chocolate Milkshake, a Penne Al Polo, Mixed Szechwan Fried Rice and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala.
The food as usual, was filling. Loved the Tikka Butter Masala, which had just the right amount of spices and the perfect balance between spicy and bland. Special mention for the pasta, which was cheesy and creamy and melted in my mouth delightfully. No complaints about rest of the items either.
The restaurant has a very basic decor, and the seating is quite limited, with two long rows of tables joined together. Should be around 20 or so.
Definitely coming back whenever I want a full, hearty meal with a less amount of pocket pinch.

This is a heaven to be. The steak will simply blow your mind, and the veggies in it simply transports you to another world. The caesar salad is heavenly. Gives you a taste of shawarma salad. The fries are quite exceptional. It's completely to the contrary of what is the cliched version of French fries. It's brown and nicely cooked with a good thickness. The sandwich is filling and heavy. Completely worth the money. The toast is very crisp and suits the Irish coffee quite well. A must visit to eat heavenly food at cheap rate.

There is a saying that don't judge a book from it's cover this place is perfect example of that.Located in the sudder street 5 minutes walk from new market this place is pure gem.
It looks pretty ordinary eatery  from outside interior also nothing to mention but this place serves good food at a very pocket friendly way.
Menucard has wide variety to serve you well.
Service time is also promt.
We go for
Chocolate banana milkshake-heavy & delicious.(3.5/5)
Chicken steam momo with soup-tender & juicy chicken momo is a mood changer.Soup is also good.(4/5)
Double chicken lasagna-it was completely the showstopper.Cheesy & mouthwatering  preparation.(4.5/5)
Honey lemon pancake-it was also tasty(3.5/5)
 Planning for my next visit very soon.

I found out this place from Zomato. 
Located at Sudder street. Near Indian Silk House.
This place doesn't look that promising from outside.
Very basic sitting arrangement. Looks like any other small restaurant. But their menu amazed me.

Ordered Chicken Biriyani, Double Chicken Lasagne and Coke. The Biriyani was bland. It lacked taste. It tasted like normal rice with some spices. Not good at all. I know going to a cafe and trying biriyani is not a good idea but I felt i should give it a try. The Lasagne stole my heart completely. It was very well made. It was cheesy and creamy. It tasted absolutely amazing. Stronly recommended!

This place is very reasonable. 
The service was promt too!

Doesn't look much from the outside but thats bcoz good things don't always look that good, they do good. Located in the outskirts of new market ( near to the indian silk house) , this is certainly a place to fill ur tummy with good food and that too without hampering the harmony of ur pocket.

I have planned this resto for quite some time and after visiting the place feels like visiting again. Food was absolutely awesome and they didnt keep us waiting for long. looking at the pictures from zomato I surely plan to visit this place again as they have so many mouth watering dishes plus the price is so low. The only disadvantage of this place is that is not that big and might be a problem to get seats during any occasion plus no washrooms.

MOST favourite cafe in the entire city. This is, hands down, the best place to hang out with your squad. A little place almost always filled, but you won't mind waiting because of the crowd, if you know what I mean. The food is absolutely smashing. I have been there several times and tried almost all of their dishes and not once was I disappointed. Every single item tastes great. The service is prompt and the staff is courteous. Healthy food in sumptous amount and at great prices. This place is the best!

First a word of caution : don’t let the outlook fool ya! This may look like just another roti-tarka-chowmin joint from the outset, but it’s most definitely not. I’ve had chicken caesar salad (or as the menu says scissor chicken salad) and chicken ham chese sandwich, with a cuppa coffee. The salad was delicious and the coffee was strong. No complaint! But the sandwich was not that impressive.

As for the place itself, it’s very utilitarian. The stuff were nice and service really quick. And it’s damn cheap, with no added tax!

Decor is not upto the mark if you r a posh loving person . But dont miss out the yummies here.

Chessy , tangy and spiced up to the right extent .

I have been visiting Blue Sky Cafe ever since I was a kid. It has been one of my go to places for scrumptious food. For those of you who don't know , this is a multicuisine cafe . Low on appearance but highly rated for the tasty food items they dish out . I love everything they make , except their Chinese . So if you go , don't order Chinese. It's not upto the mark . Their Indian and continental dishes are totally worth the prices.  This time when I went , I tried and it's quite nice and warm .....perfect for having in winter . Other than this I love their "Chicken Steak" and "Chicken Malai Kebabs". I keep ordering it over and over again. The chicken steak is something no other restaurant can make in the way they do . It's a must try if you visit this cafe . It is and I hope it continues to be a pocket friendly cafe for college goers like me .

Undrafted hunt!

Desire if it's elevated, then it's tough to curb it. Provided that if it has been polished frequently then you can't sway the shine of it. Therefore, this time my hunger took me to Blue Sky Cafe for my concocted inanition. 

There I decreed for one Tai Pei chicken, which I found crispy and undisputably toothsome; and one 211 chef's special pizza. It has topped of tandoori chicken, chicken tikka and chicken seek unified with my only love - cheese. It was delish and rich by varities of cooked chicken in it, although felt heaven so close yet too far. Nevertheless, preserved the moment and looking for more. 

Thanks for reading. Follow me on Instagram/ Zomato @ Supratik Chakravarty or on chakravarty8supratik.wordpress.com.

I generally prefer going to this place for their cosy and friendly ambience. A small cafe, with very close seating arrangements. The cafe serves almost everything, from morning breakfast to heavy meals; all can be found here. One of the most reasonable joints in the new market area. I visit this place over and over again for their prawn fried rice, where 1 plate serves two sufficiently. Have also tried their Chocolate pudding with flame, which wasn't up to my taste expectations, but the flavour of the chocolate is subjective. Many would like the taste too. A must visit for all New market shoppers especially.

I had no idea about this place 5-6 months before. When came to know about the place through zomato, I walked into there. But found the ambience unpleasant. However, the food didn't disappoint at all. We had Grilled Fish, Chicken Steak,Sandwich,pizza. They were all good(Although the hygiene is questionable). But I suggest you NOT to have any drink here. We tried Masala Lime Soda, Chocolate Lassi. Absolute waste of money.

Conclusion: If you are in Esplanade , you can visit here at least once. You can end up a breakfast or an evening meal within Rs 450-500.

We ordered a Texas Chicken Burger which costs Rs 160 and they also serve some french fries with it, it was worth every penny. And spaghetti with red sauce. 
The ambiance was good, decent for a group of friends or casual lunch or dinner. Doesn't burn a hole in your pocket and will definitely leave you with a food baby.
Pocket pinch: Rs 500 for two.

The ambience might be deceiving but the food is good. Tried out fried chicken wontons, Blue Sky special chicken pizza, and Chilli Fried Fish. Found the Fish to be the best of all. It was good and would suggest to eat that. The pizza was not so good. The wontons were okay and the sauce supplied with it tasted well. The price is not so high. Gave a 3.5 just because the pizza let me down. Thums up for the Fish, would recommend it. Noticed the shakes and lassi to be pocket-friendly. The service is fine and friendly. Interior is nothing much to be expected.

The farmhouse steak that this place serves is really good and makes a wholesome meal. The chocolate pudding that arrived was aesthetically pleasing and enjoyable to the palate. It contains rum, so those who do not prefer it, should verify before ordering. The place is cosy and comfortable but tends to get crammed during the peak hours.

Though it took some time to prepare these dishes., still at the end it was a yummy experience..

Primarily a continental cafe which is a hit with the foreigners who throng Sudder Street. This cafe cum restaurant also serves Italian, Chinese, Thai and Indian food. Located on Sudder Street, this place is packed most of the time. The staff is quite friendly here and will help you in deciding what to order out of their neverending menu card. Personally I'm a fan of their Pastas. Especially the Pasta Carbonara which is full of ham and cheese. It us very creamy and well prepared. A must try item. Among the Contis you could try their Baked fish and the house special Steak. Their pizzas are good. I've tried out their Chicken Cheese Burst pizza which was decent enough at that price. The cheese burst factor was not consistent throughtout the dough though. Desserts are okayish here but wouldn't recommend anything in particular. It's a pretty pocket friendly place.

Obviously, their food needs to be worked on, lots of room for improvement. 
But their dishes are mostly savoury and pretty much delicious. 
Give the continental section a try. 
The lasagna and the pastas too. 
The burger if you're low on money. 
The staff, amicable and friendly and if you're a regular then all the more, they help you around a lot.

Although a small joint in the city, this place serves the best chicken lasagna in the city... Oozing with cheese and generously filled with chicken... It's heaven on a plate.... 
All the cheese lovers have to and have to visit this place for this dish ...

I and my friend stopped here after shopping some junkies for a quick bite and as we are die hard babycorn lovers, we ordered the usual - crispy chilli babycorns and chocolate milk shake. As promised by the favourite establishment of kolkata, it was indeed yummy and the proportion was good enough to fill both our tummies. 
Totally recommended. Their Italian dishes are also an all time favorite.

This place serves the widest array of the most delicious food at really affordable prices. I personally love the mango banana smoothie and the pancakes. Their sandwiches are really filling. Momos , fried rice , babycorn are also great here . The food was amazing. The staff friendly. They also have WiFi.

Situated in the lanes of Sudder Street, you should go there if you're looking for great pizzas at affordable rates. This place is nothing fancy & ambience is very basic. Also the service is very slow. 
I've tried their Chicken Caldo & Super Delux ; the pizza is soft with a thin crust & generous amount of toppings. Also you can sit here for long hours and enjoy their coffee. Recommended only for the food they serve.

If you are in Esplanade and shopping has already burnt a hole in your pocket, visit this one for great food at reasonable price. Because of the location, this restaurant is always full of patrons, so be patient for your turn to come.

LOCATION ----- This one is at Sudder Street and easily be located.

AMBIENCE ---- Now if you want best food and dont want to spend fortune on that, this is the thing you need to compromise. They have AC in there, but you need to share table with others. Apart from 2 tables, all other tables are joined together, so this is not a place where you for a date (unless he/she likes food more than you). This is the only reason I have rated 4, not 5.

SERVICE ----- Service is quite good and they dont keep you waiting for long.

FOOD ----- Now the most intersting part!! We have ordered

1.GRILLED FISH IN LEMON BUTTER SAUCE

This is pure bliss for dish lovers. Two big and fat fillet of Bhetki (No, not BASA), marinated with mustard and perfectly grilled, served with lemon butter sauce ( This is melted butter with lime zest), french fries and salad. The sauce was subtle in taste and Fish was soft, delucate, juicy, tasty and many more adjectives! This is a real jem.
They have changed the price to 370 and once you taste, belive me, you wouldnt complain.

2. GRILLED CHICKEN IN ROSEMARY SAUCE

This dish tastes as good as it looks. 4 pieces of boneless chicken drenched in brown rosemary sauce,  sauted vegetables, butter rice and a bowl of rosemary sauce on side..what else you can ask for! Chicken was grilled to perfection, sause was really nice with hint of corriender and blacl pepper. You can come again and again for this kind of food

We have ordered sweet lime soda and this is the first place I saw where they give you the soda bottle with rest of the soda so that you can fill your glass when they are finished!!

If you are looking for realy good food at cheap rate, raid this place!! I overlooked gravy noodles in others plate and those looked tasty too!!!!

Would I visit this place again? hell yaaah!!

P.S. THEY ACCEPT CARD

Honestly, what rating I am putting up here is solely based on the food products I have tried here because the ambiance has disappointed me. This cafe is situated in Sudder street which is some 3-4mins walk from Simpark Mall. When we stepped in there during noon the cafe was fully packed and crowded mainly with foreigners and some locals. The seating arrangement was totally a mess and we had to share a table with some other people. Now, according to me that kind of hampers the privacy and it gives an uncomfortable vibe. The seating arrangement so made is strictly a no-no. Now, coming to the food which was also nothing much extra-ordinary. We have ordered for-

1) Chocolate shake ( Felt like having cold Milo or Bournvita)

2) Mango shake ( It was okayish. Have had better)

3) Lasagne Alferno ( a pasta dish with green veggies, chicken and cheese in a bed of yummy tomato garlic sauce. This is the only food product I liked here. Quantity was enough for two and taste was also good)


Overall an average experience. Food was okayish and ambiance really needs improvement. 

**Only good thing about this cafe is all the items in the menu card are inclusive of taxes. So it's economic.

A hidden gem at Sudder street , very popular among the firangi tourists. Simple decor, AC and clean. most of the times it remains congested. Coming to their food my absolute favourites are Chicken Pepper steak ( Not typical steak it has a twist of its own), their cheese chicken and mushroom omelettes, chilli cheese toast. Prices are pocket friendly and quality and quantity is great as well. 

Do give it a visit

It's located near new market area..a 3min walk from Simpark mall. It will provide you the essence of old Calcutta.
We went for a lunch. I honestly disliked their seating accommodation. The place is clumsy. For these two reasons I gave that 3.5 rating.
Coming to food.. we ordered mango shake, chocolate milk shake and one lasagne alfarno. Shakes were chilled.. I liked the lasagne alfarno. It was full of cheese, chicken and vegetables with a garlic sauce. It was served in a square bowl. 
Overall a different experience it was!

Location wise prime, ambience wise very ordinary with minimal decor. 
It serves a wide variety of  foods from different cuisines and with reasonable price tag. However, the quality is not compromised upon.

Prices are inclusive of all taxes; pocket pinch is reasonable. 

Basically a casual n simple eatery with good food in very affordable price. Recommended !!

This place is located in the bylanes of Esplanade and might be difficult to locate unless you know the proper address. I paid it a visit yesterday with a friend. I liked their menu which contains a wide variety of dishes starting from pizza to biryani. We however stuck to a simple Chinese meal of Pan fried noodles with eggs and Babycorn & Mushroom Manchurian. Both the dishes were delicious and the quantity was also sufficient for both. Service was also pretty quick and prices are very cheap considering the fact that they don't charge any extra GST. The final bill was only 330 bucks. I did not however like the ambience. I have been to places within the same price range but with much better ambience. Overall a good place to visit if FOOD and PRICES are your main priority and not the ambience.

Amidst the dingy and I daresay, shady lanes and bylanes of Sudder Street, where foreign tourists flock in numbers and get put up in cheap motels, you will find a hidden wonder - Blue Sky Cafe.

Though it's called a cafe, it's a restaurant offering cuisines from all over the world. Since foreign tourists flock here in numbers, you can find Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, American and Continental delights in . the menu. And, all these, at very cheap rates. Any five star restaurant offering you a similar continental dish could charge you 10 times more.

New Market is very close by. So, after a tiring day of shopping, you can come over to Blue Sky Cafe for a bite. For breakfast options, try the burgers, sandwiches or sausages. Both vegetarian and non vegetarian sandwiches are available. You can also get Indian breakfast items, like Aloo Paratha. Then you have plenty of egg dishes, pan cakes and cornflakes to choose from. For lunch try varieties of pizza, spaghetti pasta, soups and salads. Chinese delicacies also have great variety. You have plenty of noodles options and main course chicken dishes to choose from. Indian and Tandoor options are also available.

The ambiance will be something you can never experience anywhere else in Kolkata. And well, you have lot of foreigner co-eaters for company, maybe you will also be able to strike up an interesting conversation.

This is located in Sudder Street and is somewhat difficult to locate. It's a small joint with a very claustrophobic ambience so dont expect much from it. It's very small and doesn't have much room and is usually over crowded.

However, if you can get yourself to ignore the ambience and focus on the food, you're in for a treat. It makes really delicious food, and it's menu has quite a lot of variety. 

Their double chicken lasagna is what I liked a lot. It's sort of creamy and well baked. I also tried a few Chinese starters, namely the taipei chicken and the sattay chicken both of which had tremendous amount of flavour and the most perfect crunch. Their milkshakes were really good too.

Their quantity is quite a lot and they are dirt cheap. So if you can get yourself to ignore the lack of a good ambience, and indulge is cheap and amazing food, this place is for you.

For the dessert we ordered flame on chocolate pudding...we were delighted when it was served to see the fire on the pudding literally....first few spoons tasted good...but as we went inside the taste was very awkward... i guess due to the alcohol they hv used to make the flame...

I ordered chilli cheese garlic toast and chicken steam Momo. The toast was very good but the Momo had undercooked stuffing. Soup was good though. Another issue I had was that mosquitoes and flies were ruining my dining experience. If you can ignore that then I would recommend this cafe for their huge variety and above average food.

I really loved my experience @ Blue Sky Cafe. The food is good. The place is neat and clean and conveniently located. We had ordered Chocolate and Mango Milkshakes, Double chicken lasagna and Blue Sky special pizza with bellpeppers, onions, eggs, mushroom, spinach, baby corn, chicken sausages, tuna and shrimps. All the dishes were really good. Would definitely go back to try their Chinese fare.

This is my usual place to insatiate burger cravings.
I have tried almost all of the burgers in their menu and each one of them is equally amazing.
The grilled chicken burger especially is a marvel!
The lasagne that I had here was absolutely lips smacking with that extra dose of cheese.
Of late I tried the darshan with ice cream which was good but the sweetness gets to you after a while.

I ordered chilli cheese garlic toast and chicken steam Momo. The toast was very good but the Momo had undercooked stuffing. Soup was good though. Another issue I had was that mosquitoes and flies were ruining my dining experience. If you can ignore that then I would recommend this cafe for their huge variety and above average food.

An awesome place to try different types of cusines. Italian and American are the best served here. The Chicken Pepper Steak is both healthy and tasty, a great breakfast joint too. The Indian cuisines are also enticing enough and all of this on a limited budget. Serves right to be situated at the heart of Kolkata.

It has to be a 5 out of 5. First of all I was too tired after shopping for hours in New Market and was in desperate need of a heavy lunch. It took me some while to decide what to order since they offer various items. The waiter helped us a lot in choosing the proper dish and thus we ordered a Chocolate and Mango Milk shake. Mango milk shake was the best and was very smooth and was not at all scented. Chocolate shake was good. But they killed it with their Caesar Salad. It tasted like heaven in a platter. The chicken pieces were very succulent. Finally the Double Chicken Lasagna came as a blessing, it tasted amazing but would have been very happy if the quantity was bit more. Those who prefer for fine dining experience, this is definitely not the place. But if you are a true lover of good food. You should pay a visit right away. @blueskycafe Debanjan Roy

Absolutely love the food here. Though i wish the place was a little less crowded so that i could savour my meal without feeling guilty that there was an entire throng waiting for us to get done. 

The service despite the crowd is commendable. And the waiters will definitely help you order the right thing if you ask them to. 

The ambience is not great at all. Infact i wish they did something fancy to their getup so that more people could fit in and the place and it no longer looked shabby. But the food is top notch which kinda makes up for their other flaws. Would revisit again and again.

Why is blue sky cafe famous? Because it is here that you can fill your belly cheaply. Value for money and quality food is the key factor of Blue Sky Cafe. It's a den for college students because all they need is delicious food, adda and no tax. 😉 Moreover blue sky cafe has variety in their menu. You name a dish and they have it from North Indian to Chinese and Italian. They specialise in ALL :) ❤️
Oh yes please don't expect anything from the ambience. It's a small place with absolutely no fancy ambience.

Have tried their mixed noodles, chocolate pancake, chicken cheese omelet, lemon chicken, chilli chicken, cheese omelet. 
All are good. The noodles are very tasty. Chocolate pancake is a total failure though. It didnt even taste like a pancake. 
Other dishes are tasty too.

It is located in Sudder Street and quite honestly if it is your first visit, the place doesn't look that appealing from outside at all. But once you are in and you have a look at the menu, nothing else matters. Coming to the food, we ordered jumbo burgers, chicken steak and fresh lime soda..it was yum!! So if you want to fill your tummy well without burning a hole in your pocket then this is the right place!

In all its a good place to visit.

This is a small outlet on the Sudder street. A cheap restaurant mostly famous among the foreigners. It has a wide variety of food; Chinese, continental and north India cuisine. Good for some casual dining when your at new market. But truly the food is average. I ordered for the nutella pancake and nutella banana pancake which looked like dosas which nutella spread. Taste is mediocre.

A bit hectic to locate but heard of this place and wanted to visit for quite some time. The cafe doesn't look that exciting nor the decor adds to it's appeal. We were pretty confused with what to devour in, and ordered Texas Chicken Burger and Chicken Pepper Steak. The burger(with extra cheese) was quite filling and they add jalapeños, which complements pretty well(if you like jalapeños). The Pepper Steak had quite a great quantity of Chicken which was crispy and well cooked. We had lime soda alongside which was very refreshing! The best part is that they don't charge tax, it's all inclusive!

A place famous for backpackers mostly Non Indians. I visited the place quite often with friends from abroad. Honestly speaking I found its been a bit overrated. The food they serve is of basic standard. Biggest issue I faced was they are more interested to serve foreigners than Indians which is ridiculous. They discriminate between their guests based on race and color. One of my friend got cheated too in terms of paying for something he had not ordered. A place I would not recommend for people who want to take real taste of Indian food.
However if you are in the location and want a free emergency wi fi network may be its a good idea to visit.

Blue Sky Cafe is one of the most famous cafe located in  sudder street, new market..
Have heard some really positive feedbacks about this place for their chinese and north indian cuisine.
But i mainly visited this cafe today for some snacks.

The interior of this cafe is quite on the minimum side, nothing extraordinary but they do serve some really good food.

One major con of this cafe is there is no washroom or even a basin where u can wash ur hands.
Well, now coming to the food.
We ordered their very famous
1) MANGO SHAKE
2) CHOCOLATE SHAKE and
3) CHICKEN AND CHEESE SANDWICH.

The mango shake was amazing. No added flavours and colour.. The mango shake was made out of alphonso , milk and the chilled shake tasted pretty well in this hot and sultry weather.
The chocolate shake was also pretty good, though nothing extraordinary..

I liked the mango shake more.
Now, coming to the sandwich.
They have lots of varieties but we settled for the chicken and cheese one. The sandwich was loaded with chicken, though was not that cheesy but was very healthy and fresh...
Really appreciate their food quality.. The price is also on the affordable side with all tax inclusive..
Overall, this place is ideal for a quick munch on after your shopping..
Definitely revisiting this place for their food quality and would recommend this place to others!

Had heard great reviews about this place, supposed to be one of the best destinations for breakfast in the city - was a little disappointed.

We were probably their earliest customers on a Saturday morning. The good things first - the fresh fruit juice was delightful, made right in front of us. Chiku Lassi sounded new, but every novel thing is not worth the money.

I tried the chicken omelette and plain toast, which was no doubt good, but not particularly extraordinary. 
Particularly disappointing were the lemon flavored pancakes - there was not much hint of lemon in them, nor were they as soft as should be expected.

Location wise prime, ambience wise very ordinary. Good maybe for a reasonably priced meal in between shopping in New Market, but not exactly the kind of place you would take your outstation friends to, if they have the intention of sampling old world Calcutta.

A small little restaurant tucked at the corner of Russell street. 
We had ordered for:
Schezwan fried rice- the quantity was huge. Too much for two people. Not that i am complaining. 😝
Chicken in hunan sauce-good as usual.
Nutella and banana pan cake- though not the best but good enough. 
Also the place is tax free. So bonus points for that! 
Thumbs up. 👍

Situated on Sudder Street , I had heard a lot about this place about how good it is and how the food is delicious. I did not honestly find it to be as good as glorified. 

I had been there today evening for a late lunch . I chose to come here over Raj Spanish Cafe which is a tried and tested place and I kind of regret it. 

It's a small place with adequate seating for about 20 people. The decor and ambience is ok, the highlight is that a lot of foreigners come here to dine as it serves at a comparatively economical price. 

I had been there with my fiance and we tried out the Spaghetti Carbonara, the carbonara had a overload of cream and cheese , i.e it was too much white sauce for me to handle. I have had carbonara earlier and I was disappointed with the preparation. 

My fiance ordered the Green and Garlic Spaghetti and this too was overloaded with white sauce though it was mentioned  to be made with olive oil and garlic only like Aglio Olio.

Lastly we ordered the Mix Meat Salad , which was a combination of chicken , chicken sausages, chicken ham and Egg whites with veggies. The dressing and all were ok but I felt the sausages were not fresh and had a funny taste to it. 

The quantity is sufficient for one but the menu that has been extremely elaborate and has Indian, Chinese , Thai , Continental​ and Pizza , Pasta and Various types of breakfast fares might just have been too much to handle. 

I will not disagree that it is an extremely popular eatery and every day a good number of locals and foreigners come to eat there but I was not satisfied.

This is a very famous cafe in the lanes of Sudder Street. I had to try this place with my friends. It is a small cafe with minimal arrangements and ordinary dining areas. The interior and exterior is blue in colour which the names itself suggests.
We ordered Margarita Cheese Crust pizza. The waiting time was too long, we had to wait for almost 30mins. The pizza looked quite ordinary and the food didn't seem worth the wait. It was cheesy indeed and tasted good but couldn't meet my expectations. Probably because of wrong choice of order. It was filling though.
The ambience is quite ordinary, the service needs special attention, the food is tasty, the price is just fine. I should go back to this place and try out other dishes too.

Date of First Visit: 1/05/17

This is definitely a hidden gem. A decent café with good food. It gives value for money without compromising on the quality of food or service offered.

Drinks - we ordered a sweet lime juice and tomato juice. So fresh!

Food - I was in a fix between Texas chicken burger and Grilled chicken burger so I asked the server to help me take a pick (The servers are pretty helpful. Ask them whenever you're in a fix about what to order). So, I picked the grilled chicken one because the texas one was going to be spicy as per the server. It was amazing! They serve the burger with crispy yummy french fries and coleslaw. I enjoyed every bit of it.
My fiancé ordered the chicken pepper steak. Since he loves steaks, I wanted him to try that after seeing the reviews over here. I had a bit of the steak. It was yummy! It tasted a bit like chilli chicken. They serve it with vegetables and french fries.

I had an amazing experience over here. I am definitely going back again!


Date of Second Visit: 08/05/17

Well, yes! I had to go back again. This has become one of my favorite after work snacks places! 

As usual, the servers were helpful and nice. Quick service. The best part was I kept my hand sanitizer on the table and forgot to take it while leaving but one of the servers came running and returned it back! 

I had sweet lassi and my fiancé had salted lassi for drinks. Both were very refreshing on a hot summer evening. 

In food, I ordered a Kentucky burger and boy, I have become a big fan of their burgers. I enjoyed every bit of this crispy burger served with chips. My fiancé went for the farmhouse steak. His exact words "If I have steaks, I am only having it over here" and this is a big thing coming from a steak lover like him. They serve the steak with a lot of veggies, pasta and an amazing gravy. I had a bit of the steak and pasta. Loved it!

Pocket pinch for ALL of the above (second visit) : Rs. 440 (yeah you read that right!)

Definitely going back again! I think I might go for a lasagna on next visit or one of their pizzas or...ah well! There is literally EVERYTHING available over there so kinda confused! :-D

Was there last evening with 3 friends, and really wondered how people have this place written on their wishlist. Ambience was really bad, seats were also not comfortable, food was spicy (just like roadside eateries) and if you ask me for a tip I must say  "NEVER TELL THEM TO TURN OFF  THE FAN, OR ELSE A FLY WILL COME AND SIT ON YOUR HAND"  and food as well. Literally.

Fantastic food!
We ordered White Sauce Pasta and Mango & Watermelon Juice.Everything was really tasty.
Good Ambience.
Finding it out for people not very accustomed to new market might be a bit difficult.
Other than that a wonderful place for friends' hangout.

'Blue Sky' perfect cafe to hang out with friends and colleagues and the food, delicious would be a small word.
We ordered Chicken Pepper Stake and Chicken Drums of Haven the food quality was impeccable. Moreover, they don't charge any extra tax which is quite good considering the fact the cafe is air conditioned.

The only thing this cafe lacks is the space.
It isn't spacious at all. Hardly 12 people would gather in that cafe. So for me, if they would come up with some floor space it would be Kolkata's first coolest and cheapest cafe cum restaurant within 500 bucks.

~All that glitters is not gold,often have we heard that told~
This is one of the hidden gems of kolkata,tucked away in the corners of Sudder Street.Nothing fancy in terms of interior decor but the food is great here.

For 2 people we ordered

1. chicken pepper steak - This is an amazing dish with a generous size of the chicken steak which is served with numerous vegetables in a light sauce and French fries.

2. Fish n Chips - Fish fry which has a mustard sauce coating inside and fried outside is served with a dipping sauce,French fries and salad.

3. Nutella pancake - This was pretty mediocre as the pancake was soggy 

4. Fresh lime soda sweet 
 
We had a bill of 570rs, all the dishes are  very reasonably priced.

Since it is a busy food joint it might take few minutes for the waiters to come up to you to take your order but other than this there is nothing to complain much as the food served to you will quench your appetite for good food.

Was there last evening with 3 friends, and really wondered how people have this place written on their wishlist. Ambience was really bad, seats were also not comfortable, food was spicy (just like roadside eateries) and if you ask me for a tip I must say  "NEVER TELL THEM TO TURN OFF  THE FAN, OR ELSE A FLY WILL COME AND SIT ON YOUR HAND"  and food as well. Literally.

I had this place on my wish list for a long amount of time & finally I had the opportunity to visit this place.
Located near new market area. This place has decent seating capacity of around 25 covers
Though the ambience is average. And we order the following 
1. Crispy chilly baby corn 
2. Burger 
4. Chicken noodles 
5. French fries 
The main attraction of the place would be the menu pricing & the value for money

Heard a lot about  this cafe, so went there a week ago. A small cafe, not that beautiful, minimal decor, small seating arrangements and filled with foreigner that's what Blue Sky Cafe is. It serves a wide variety of  foods from different cuisines and with reasonable price.
I had a Pancake from here. Pancakes are bit different here, its as slim as a usual roti. But yea it was tasty. Along with this we also had Mango Shake,Cappuccino, and one chicken item and of all them tasted really  good. Prices are also pretty reasonable, would love to visit again.

Since I loved having  breakfast  thought I'd have lunch  too.  Ordered  mixed fried rice, hakka noodles, fries  and coke. 
Hakka noodles  was a joke it was bland no taste like it was boiled and served  rice was alright  not that great either  and fries  were more like wedges size  of my finger but I liked it..  But hakka  noodles  am sorry but it was really  horrible 
I like blue  sky cafe but today let down......

This is the small shop located in a dingy locality of the city where tourists come for some snacks and coffee. Straight out of a neo noir movie set. Though, I go here for only one thing they have in their menu. The Kentucky Burger. Smart, quick service and reasonable. Lest, I forget, the Kentucky Burger is by far the best burger I have had anywhere in the whole world. The chicken patty in that burger makes you crave for more and leaves a happy taste in your mouth as you leave this place. A comforting joint with comfort food to liven up your day. Never think twice before entering Blue Sky cafe- that's my suggestion to you.

If you have went shopping and in search for a place to fill up your energy, this is the go-to outlet. Nothing more, nothing less. There's nothing to mention about interiors or ambience since it is a plain simple eatery where you need to share tables. We ordered cold coffee, hot coffee with chilly cheese sandwich. Food tasted good, but I found them a bit overpriced as per the place and the portion served.

It is rightfully said that looks are deceiving. Minimal decor, friendly ambiance and great food, that is what comprises the Blue Sky Cafe. Located at sudder street, it is a place which serves great food at minimal pocket pinch. The place is usually filled with foreigners and is a great place to meet new people. I had dropped by a week ago and the staff made sure I didn't feel lonely. The watermelon juice was truly refreshing; fresh and chilled. I also ordered  the Chicken club sandwich that was accompanied by crispy french fries. The sandwich had a touch of home food to it and was filling. I would love to go back and try their much talked about pizzas.

Shabby ambience.

Tried Drums of Heaven & Chilli Garlic mixed fried rice. Both were well made and lipsmacking. Quantity was ample too.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

A small restaurant situated behind new market. Eating at this place will only be a light pinch to your pocket. Very economical, and hence great for college students. Food is good. They have a massive menu, and some of the items are bang on delicious. Cinnamon and peanut butter toast is pure HEAVEN. Non vegetarian pizzas are a good choice, and so are the breakfast options. Worth going to for more than one time.

When you are running short of money and still want to have great food this should be your ideal destination. With a cosmopolitan crowd they serve authentic cosmopolitan food. We ordered Texas chicken burger (I don't know after having it will I be ever able to have McD's burger- it's that good), chicken pepper steak, French fries (it was one of its kind) and Nutella pancake and three sodas. After having so much bill was only 640. We are too happy to see it.

The place sure surprised us!
We hopped in for breakfast at around 9.30 in the morning, and in less than half an hour, we officially named this as our go-to breakfast place.
The staff- unbelievably friendly.
The ambience- we went rather early, so it was pretty quiet. Gives you the cafe feels. :)
We ordered:
-Jumbo Burger- comes with a chicken patty, a fried egg, vegetables and sauce inside. Potato chips on the side. 
-Grilled Chicken Burger- comes with gigantic succulent pieces of chicken inside, and fries and salad on the side. Defeated every burger we've had till date.
-Double chicken lasagna- drowned in creamy white cheese sauce and the chicken filling was brilliant.
-Orange Banana Lassi- 2 glasses for 80/-! Loved it!

No service tax, too.
Definitely down on the favourites list. :)

This has been in my wish-list for sometime so we decided to call on this afternoon...

Famous for being frequented by foreigners and especially Italian cuisine, I found this place quite intimidating...

So, we ordered Penne Arrabiata & Chicken Venzia first... Arrabiata was quite average but I found Venzia certainly toothsome; Penne baked with mushroom, olives, chicken sausages and of course lots and lots of cheese.................... SUCH YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!

Next, Grilled Chicken in Rosemary Sauce, one of my choice, delighted us too... The chicken had an uncanny essence almost close to the flavour of a betel leaf or so... And that with the sauce... A satisfying meal course!

Lastly, my friend chose Jai Thai Flat Noodles very much against my non-recommendation and in my view, it was a total disappointment!!

However, a real pocket-friendly eatery if want to try Italian!!!

 Highly recommended the Indian cuisine - don't even bother with the western food. I had the Thai rice noodles.. very nice.. You can also have a steak here if you like.. Try the mushroom burger and the fish and chips.  The prices are reasonable and wait staff are fairly friendly..

Located in sudder street, just in the lane beside indian museum. This place is a bit different, mainly serving to the tourists, and also has a crowd of foreigners. The place has a wide variety of items in the menu, and is clean but a bit small, which is adjustable if you are looking for a lesser pocket pinch. Can be surely tried out for a different experience. The bill comes without any vat,service tax,service charge, and the food served is tasty, but not extra ordinary. Can be tried out for a quick snack after shoppings. We tried the chicken grilled in rosemary sauce which was good, and the texas chicken burger which was ok-ish not mouth watering.

In this restaurant you will find lots of foreigners all the time. The breakfast menu is great with lots of choices.  This one place I like to go for breakfast or Snacks without even thinking the second time. The Kentucky burger and the grilled chicken burger is just awesome, also the cheese omelette is mouth watering. A must visit to satisfied your hungry soul.

This restaurant is very convenient if you are shopping in New Market. I thought of comparing the dishes I've tried from the Blue Poppy the previous night. So, I ordered the exact same thing which is Chicken Clear Soup, Chilli Chicken and Chicken fried rice. It is more peaceful than the Blue Poppy with just few customers but in cleanliness part it is more or less the same. 

Coming to food, the soup is much better than the previous one but Chilli Chicken was better in Blue Poppy. For the rice, both were good and quantity is as good as it is in Blue Poppy. All in all, it is rather difficult to choose which is better as both are worth a visit if you are close by to the locations.

Although it's a bit small, but they make it up in the quality of food. Overall awesome experience. Looking forward to going there again!

While roaming near Esplanade with my friend I came to know about this cafe from Zomato. Without any second thought we searched the location and after 5mins walking distance we reached at our destination. The ambience is just OK and nothing special with it. When I was looking into the menu I found few foreigners were having their snacks. The menu is designed for foreigners and most importantly the price is very cheap. We asked first for a salted lime soda and then a plate of chicken pepper steak. The steak amount was enough for both it was excellent. Though it took a while to come in to my table but the taste compensate the waiting time. Enjoyed thoroughly and will visit again for sure.

Had this uncontrollable urge to eat some crispy chilli babycorn but was tight on budget so decided to give this place a visit. It was in my wishlist for a long time but didn't get an opportunity until that day and boy I wasn't disappointed at all. First i asked for a fresh lime soda(the salty option). It was really really refreshing and they even provided the extra soda. Then  the piping hot plate of crispy chilli babycorn was served to me.. And it was yummilicious. I hadn't had such lip-smacking crispy chilli babycorn for a long time.. I finished it in no time. Then the bill came. No extra vat or any other charges.. It really had brought a large smile on my face. Will definitely visit again for their pizzas and pastas.. ☺

I have visited this cafe numerous times but this is gonna be the first time to give my review. Well, here goes.

Location: situated in new market, sudder street.

I went to this cafe in the morning today to have breakfast, about 10am. And even then it was busy. You will find a lot of foreigners of different race coming to eat here. Not only it is cheap, but they actually provide good food to fill your stomach.

Interior designing: a very small cafe with about 8 to 10 tables. Not much walking space but dont let that disappoint you. 

Food and service: for breakfast, we ordered ( 4 people ):
• mushroom, chicken and cheese omelette: any omelette with mushroom and cheese tastes good, add chicken to that, its gonna taste like heaven in your mouth.
• butter toast: comes with two slices, just your average butter toast. But they are not so miser when giving butter.
• chicken and ham sandwich: a three layer sandwich with chicken and ham. I feel it lacks a bit of mayo but still it tastes good.
• cinnamon toast: cinnamon and salt tastes good together.
• chicken and cheese omelette: another classic omelette.
• peanut butter toast: a lot of peanut butter. You would love it.
• cotton bleu burger: i had a bite of this burger. Not bad.
• milk coffee and milk tea: you can add sugar on your own for your preference. 

Since this is probably my 4th visit here, i will come back here again.

a very popular breakfast cafe near the new market area... have been there several times but not in the near future until today when i visited this place nearly after 5-6 yrs.... take a left from madge street towards kyd street and the cafe will be on your right.... something that i always noticed is that the place is always full of foreigners who probably lives nearby,  not because it has exotic menu but the food is pretty good,  pretty vast menu and definitely reasonable.... though the cafe also serves pizzas and burgers,  its menu is mainly focused on breakfast and all kinds of it... continental,  indian and south-indian delicacies... i ordered for a cheese and chicken sandwich,  a banana milkshake with icecream and a aloo paratha.... the bill was around 240 and they dont charge taxes.... so overall and definitely recommended place for foodies.... pretty hygienic and while you dont expect the most courteous staff who yells at the kitchen staff while barking orders which is kinda funny the overall experience wont let you down...

Very easy to locate this cafe. Good behavior of the staffs and well mannered and they do suggest what to eat..
Specially tourists/foreigners come to eat over here.. This cafe serve what no starting from breakfast,Chinese, Indian,Thai,Continental and varieties of desserts ..
we ordered:
*Veg chicken cheese burger: it was served with chips & taste was good and cheese was oozing out.
*Chicken Pepper steak : chicken steak toppings were thick gravy with veggies and served with potato wedges. I liked it the quality was really good chicken was soft.
*Masala fresh lime soda
*Fresh lime soda
After filling the glass of drinks the staff provided us the left over soda which no one does..
And our bill was 400 only which is pocket friendly.
Service is appreciable ..
No special ambiance but the food can drop to come again!

Amazing little place hidden in the lanes of Sutter Street. A must try. We had the cold coffee and lemon ice tea which were perfectly balanced and one of the best we have had. We had ordered macaroni and vegetable au gratin which was heavenly cheesy and cooked to perfection, the vegetables still had their fresh crunch and the sauce for au gratin was perfectly spiced and just the right amount of cheese. Along with it was a veg pizza which had fresh thin crust and ingredients that were really good quality. Not only was food great at this place, the prices were absolutely cheap. All this at a price of 550 rs. This place is a must visit for some delicious awesomeness at really cheap price.

Old little place in the bylanes of new market.  The menu is pretty comprehensive. It's pretty easy on the pocket.  The taste of the dishes more than makes up for the average decor.  We had chicken macaroni augratin,  pan fried schezwan noodles,  shredded chicken in devil's sauce and chicken pepper steak.  Cannot complain of poor taste in any of them.  Special mention for the augratin and steak.  

One suggestion : They can think of adding pork dishes on the menu.  Works with the taste they serve.

Excellent food & pocket friendly. A one stop solution for any meal throughout the day... The best place to eat at Sudder Street! You can enjoy this place both as a solo player or in a group...

A definite 4.5⭐ for the place, the only thing lacking is an English breakfast in the menu. 

Must have: Apple Pancake, Grilled Chicken Burger & the fresh juices!!

It's this unimpressive little restaurant near the Indian Museum but if you're brave enough to venture inside, your taste buds are going to be eternally grateful. I've been there thrice already and tried something new every time and not once did they disappoint. It's also quite light on the pockets. Don't expect a rich ambience;If you're a foodie though, you won't mind. So open the menu and order away

It was winter last... 
In the year past... 
When we felt this place fit... 
To go after a museum visit...
The place is small and had to wait...
We were hungry & it was getting late...
Yet we wanted to have our lunch...
There, to sit, sip and something to munch...
We order some steak and a choco-pudding, burnt...
The chef was smart and the dishes seemed well-learnt...

Anyway, enough for a gastro-rhyme. Once you enter this old shack, the ratio of white faces to black mask will confirm you all at once that this place indeed knows how to cook American and Italian food to suit the foreign tourists and make them regulars here...
The ambiance may not be classy... The place is also not that kept up... But the food smells of a long history of success and expertise that makes this place worth recommendable !

This is one of my favourite cafés in Kolkata. Might be a bit difficult to locate this for first timers. This place is always buzzing with foreigners. The waiters are one of the best I have seen. Last time, I visited Blue Sky Cafe with a friend. We had Lemon Ice Tea and Jafa milkshake. Jafa is a perfect combo of chocolate with orange fragnance. It is just yum! Then we had Chicken Burger, French fries and Pan fried Chilli Chicken. The chilli chicken is one of the best I've ever had. The best part? Its pocket-friendly.

A hidden treasure it is!! Try the Blue Sky special Pizza, Chicken pepper steak, and their lasagna. 
All the drinks and juices are also too good.

Well i visited this place with a friend of mine to have some chitchat after shopping in esplanade...and its quite  a nice place . Its a cafe yet it serves all kinds of meals which is great !

We were not that hungry so ordered for steamed momo and fried momo . Momo 's were tasty and well made just that only the momo dip they serve needs to be changed! Its made if peanut and not spicy at all ! I would like to try their other dishes too very soon.

Staff were friendly and well mannered . Decor was simple . In all i had a good experience will be hitting it again !

Continental at most affordable price

A legendary restaurant on Sudder Street,just pass lytton hotel on the land left to The Indian Museum(upon facing the museum main gate) is a gem of the "Hippy para".  You get passably hood continental at most affordable prices here. If you care about ambience and have set a high standard for hygiene, this place is a misfit for you. A small cafe to hold abput 50 odd people,the tables are laid in cluttered close proximity.
However they have made up for all these with the taste and portion of food they offer at given prices. We ordered a chicken large calzone(4 large pieces), a grilled fish in lemon butter sauce 4large chunks of becti and not basa),  baked chicken pasta(it may be challenging for one to finish, though not sufficient for 2), a chicken pepper steak,2 fresh lime and one masala lime soda. 1290/_ was the total bill amount.The soda was light and I thought it was too dilute and without fiz. Steak was a turn down. Coating was too much and the pepper sauce was tasteless. It was a confused oriental attempt at making a steak which features in their "Chinese" menu. Rest is okay. This place deserves a visit,if you havent already. Even in the not so inviting ambience you will find its own global charm. Service was slow considering the cafe wasnt really filled up but the behaviour was friendly and welcoming.This place is better enjpyed in company of friends, may be many. You need to rethink before bringing your family to this place.

The five of us decided for a heavy brunch before we tire ourselves out with endless street shopping in New Market. We decided to try out this place. Located on Sudder Street, this place doesn't exactly provide you the ambience of Flurys or Au Bon Pain, but the food will not disappoint you at all. 
We ordered cold coffees, a double cheese chicken lasagne, a farm house chicken steak, a risotto and a mushroom chinese omlette and for desserts, a chocolate pudding with flame and a dimsum.  While the main course was brilliant, the desserts were a big let down which is why I rate this place a 3.5 instead of 4.
This place is a must try if you love continental and is very reasonable. Oh, and do try out the double cheese lasagne.

Awesome food loved it so much. My friend ordered grilled chicken with rosemerry sauce it was soo yummy and I ordered biriyani it was so yummy as well.. It's really worth of money and time. Didn't even take too much time to place the order. And yes I would have loved if it had services with other food delivering sites like swiggy... But above all its really a nice cafe.

I am sitting right now in this cafe with my family. I don't know about expert review but this is what I just went through. After finishing one order I tried placing a new order and the waiter reply was " order time lagega busy time hai abhi pehle ek saath bolna tha na" . Even in hot tourist places pple do not treat customers with this attitude
 I hope the owner reads this.

The greatest USP about this place is it's location and the people who visit there . A quiet quaint atmosphere prevails throughout. We had ordered Chicken Pepper Steak and Lapchi Kai Chicken and Chocolate milkshakes. The Pepper Steak was one of the most innovative dishes I had ever tried. The Lapchi Kai Chicken was a big thumbs up but considering the price, one can get a lot more at Crystal Chimney at Chandni Chowk , but it was nothing short of awesome, and same goes for the milkshake. We also later ordered Custard Pudding which was extremely well prepared. The waiters greeted us with smiles and also were ready to take our orders at the exact moment. A must visit for people who love food :)

This place might not look very attractive from the outside but it's quality that matters :)
Had ordered a jumbo burger and a double chicken lasagna. The burger did look of average size but was pretty filling. The patty was very good. The lasagna was up to the mark, cheesy gooey and full of chicken, very tasty. But I am very disappointed with the custard, it was too hard and I think it was kept in the freezer for too long. I couldn't have it.

Was actually headed out with my sister for an evening snack out, but happened to stumble upon this place while walking down sudder street.. This place is a bit towards the interior of sudder street & best reached on foot(getting a parking space can be difficult).
So we ordered a Kentucky Burger & a chicken Cheese Sandwich. The Kentucky Burger made me forget my all time favourite KFC zinger burgers. They use freshly made mayo & that makes all the difference.. 
The chicken cheese sandwich was very delicious but too greasy. All in all, whenever visiting blue sky cafe, do try the Kentucky Burger with chips.

After completing puja shopping in Esplanade I suggested my friend to go to this place for filling our hunger. This place is tucked in a lane beside Indian museum. When we entered the place was full with mostly foreigners. They have a simple dining place with well sitting arrangements. We got seated comfortably and then decided to have some chinese foods. They have a large variety of menu including Indian, continental, chinese. We ordered chicken drums of heaven as starter following by mixed fried rice along with chicken 65 in main course. The food served within 15 minutes. The starter was just finger llicking. The chicken leg pieces served in a spicy sauce tasted too good. The mixed fried rice was perfectly cooked and tasted decent. The chicken 65 was also good but it was some less spicy type dish. The chicken pieces served were soft and juicy. So overall I am very impressed by the quality of foods they served. Apart from the delicious foods this place is pocket friendly too with no additional vat and tax. So whenever I would go to Esplansde next time I would definitely visit again for tasting other cuisines.

We ordered for Irish coffee n cappuccino. N couldn't v either of them. They used a lot of cinnamon in cappuccino. I don't know why!! The waitor said, Irish coffee would contain wine. But it seemed, it contained low quality rum instead!! I ordered for another continental dish, chicken steak with garden vegetables. It was good. Lastly we had fruit custard. It was okayish.. But after all I can't keep it in the list of best cafes in Kolkata!!

I've been to blue sky cafe once before years ago. Since that day, I've been wanting to visit this again, but that had not come to pass until very recently. What I had liked before the most was the burger here. The crisp cutlet coupled with the tomatoes and lettuce was classic. Although this time, I wish they had put in some sauces as I've grown to like that cheesy taste, but it's not a complaint. The baby corn and the spring roll are also amazing, though the latter was a bit too oily for my taste, but it was well made none the less. Pricing is also very reasonable. All in all, a must try. Next time I sure won't be waiting years for a third sitting here.

Its famous for its exotic flavour and great variety of both India and Italian cuisine.. I am fan of their bubble chicken lasagne.. The chicken supremo is also quite testy ... The service is very fast and the staff is friendly. Both the  quality and  quantity is good keeping the price in mind.. The only problem is this place is very small and stuffy .  But other than that it deserves a 👍🏼

We ordered three burgers, Texas Chicken and Veg cheese along with two shakes, Banana Honey and Mocha.
The burgers will just perfect, not too less, not too much. The shakes were decent too. we also ordered the Chocolate Pudding which was just heavenly! it tasted like the insides of a chocolava cake :p  
The place is definitely value for money. If you want to check it off your lists, its a must visit, but if you want to go out for a fun outing and try something glamorous, this place isn't it. It has a different type of charm :)

Blue Sky Cafe is located in Sudder Street,opposite to Fairlawns.Just take the lane beside Indian Museum then walk straight and you can see the cafe.
Considering the location of this restaurant it is always filled with foreigners.

Food tried here are : Mango milk shake,Fresh lime soda,Tandoori chicken,Egg chicken cheese sandwich,Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce,Pan fried chilli fish and Chocolate pudding with flame.

Ambience is something which one should not expect of this place but it is maintained well,everything was neat and clean.
Staffs are courteous,service is fast and the prices are reasonable as there are no additional taxes. 
Will recommend everybody to come here......

The order goes like a variety of lasagnas pizza, noodles etc. Though i preferred to choose chicken pepper stake from Chinese dishes. It was really light nd yummy. Nd tried haka noodles. Tandoori dishes were also good. Special mention for the chocolate pudding which was lighted up in a flame. Looks nice.

Well we go through zomato. And it is been considered as hidden gem. Well i cant justify that .
We took lemon coriander soup. That was yum. Loved the acidic taste however missed a pinch of spicy chili and pepper. Still i like that. Then we took bolognese. It was a mess. The saucier could not make it properly. The sauce was a complete mess . and then in dessert we asked for darshan , however they dint had that.so again we asked for chocolate in flames. Well that was looking awesome with the blue flames on the dish. But it was not appetizing. It was ok types .
Oh yeaah one great thing they got free WiFi ;)

One of the best restaurants offering Chinese delicacies in the new market area. Little difficult to find as it is located inside an alley opposite Cost Accountancy institute in sudder street. the dining area is okay in terms of space...not that big or small. Takeway orders are faster than dine in. The food is good in terms of quality and quantity. We ordered Shanghai chicken and prawn fried rice. Fried rice was soft and tasty , filled with medium sized prawns. Chicken was tender and succulent and came in small cubical pieces. It needed to be a little more spicy otherwise it's good. Overall, a big thumps up to this place

My first visit here. And I found that their Grilled Chicken Burger is one of the best I have till date. The chicken patty was so succulent and tasty. The lasagna was lip-smacking!The Chocolate Pudding with Flame looked spectacular as it arrived, but wasn't as good as the other items in terms of taste.Looking forward to my next visit.

Blue Sky Cafe is located in Sudder Street. Take the lane next to Indian Museum and walk straight. It's just opposite to Fairlawns. It's a relatively small space, rather it remains crowded most of the time - so probably not a very good option for big groups. This is one of those places where food is more important than the décor or the ambiance. Had ordered a couple of burgers and a Hot & Spicy Cheese Burst Pizza. The pizza was just brilliant, full of cheese and chicken. Also the Choco Pudding with Flame, their specialty was quite interesting.

Good food, no extra taxes, friendly service ( although a bit slow) , it is one of the must try places in Kolkata.

I've been to this place quite a number of times, and every time it didn't leave to impress me. So this one is situated in the Sudder street towards the end mainly, distinguishable spot be Fair lawn. Every time I've been here, I've seen majority of ppl who dine here are mostly foreigners, may be because it's a nice multi cuisine restaurant and they also provide free WiFi. 😂
This cafe is quite spacious, having a relaxed ambience. 
Now coming to food, I've tried variety of items :
So the best few lip-smacking dishes that completely took over me are :
• Double cheese chicken lasagna (perfectly made with huge amount of cheese and generous amount of chicken in it and portion is enough for 2ppl) 😁
• Grilled chicken burger (one of the relishing burgers I had) 😉
• Davioli 8" cheese crust pizza (OMG! This was something...with thin crust covered up with chicken ham and then topped with lots of cheese, I think for ham lovers this will be one of the best picks here) 😅
• Spicy polo pizza regular crust ( Also loved this pizza which had a taste of spicy tikka in it) 😯
Apart from that I've tasted their Chinese delicacies as well which wasn't that impressive though but still tasty enough. 😡
I completely loved the fruit flavoured lassi they offer, ie the mango and the honey banana lassis were just awesome!
Among desserts if you go by looks the chocolate pudding with flame will be a great choice. 😄
.

RATINGS :
FOOD : 4.5/5
AMBIENCE : 3/5
SERVICE : 4/5
VFM : 4/5

.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 👑

Went to this immensely popular place with a few friends last Saturday and tried quite a few things. Their cappuccino was pretty good, and the Lemon soda was alright too. 
The Texas burger was big, meaty, and amazing, but the fries were limp. My favourite was the Lasagne served whole and fresh. 
The flame pudding was a home style chocolate pudding topped with rum and flambéed and looked spectacular but wasn't great to taste. The honey, peanut butter pancake was supposed to be the end of the meal but then, a mad pizza craving happened so had that too. 
The prices are cheap and service is quick. However the machine for card payment wasn't working and we had to scavenge our wallets to pay the bill.

A simple place in the Sudder street. Presents a truly cosmopolitan gathering. So is the food.....covering a pretty wide range from sandwiches, breakfast plater, burgers, pizza, pasta, chinese and some other oriental preps along with the indigenous parantha and curry. Food are overall good. Tom yum soup and Om clear soup are great.

Out of sheer exhaustion after shopping,we dropped in here finding the place to be air conditioned. But surprisingly it's food turned out to be way better than the other regular eateries at new market area. It's basically the hub of the foreigners staying there. The ambience isn't that well decorated. We ordered
DUBBLE CHICKEN LASAGNE it was yummy, cheesy with decent proportion of meat ball . I would certainly go back for the lasagne. Recommended
CHICKEN FRIED RICE it was tasty but the quantity was not quite much
SINGAPORE RICE NOODLE looked amazing so did it taste.recommended.
SHANGHAI CHICKEN it tasted moderate. It was garnished with cashew nuts which added an extra charm to the dish.
Happiest we became when we saw the food was inclusive of tax. Food couldn't be better at that price. My experience was wonderful and I would say it's quite a distinguishable food joint at new market area which you must try.

I came here with my bestie for lunch.It's located in sudder street right in the lane beside the Indian Museum.It was very cramped up and we had to share the table with a couple.The place was very noisy and service was poor.The thing for which I disliked the most is the prominent discrimination between foreigners and locals which was quite evident from the difference in attitude of the staffs towards these 2 groups of visitors.

Anyway,these things doesn't hamper the merriment much when you are with your bestie and food is good.

We took chicken sausage with chilli cheese dip,french fries,pizza supreme(regular) and pancake with Nutella.

▶▶Chicken sausage with chilli cheese dip-It had fried sausages with french fries.It was a good combination.The best thing was the french fries were home-made..not the packaged frozen ones we usually see in junk food outlets..We loved it so much that we order another separate plate of fries.The chilli cheese dip was good with the right kick of spice in it.But it was more of a sauce than a dip because it was very runny.Nonetheless it went good with fried chicken sausages and french fries.

▶▶Pizza supreme-I didn't like it much.The toppings given was very less and it was quite dry.Didn't justify its description in the menu at all.

▶▶Pancake with Nutella-This was a good way to end the meal.Sinfully rich treat to the tastebuds it was.

I sincerely hope the negative part I hated the most about Blue Sky Cafe changes.

I was on a shopping spree last week in the esplanade area and any shopping spree is incomplete without the post shopping hunger curb. Hence this was our place of choice both the days after the shopping as it had some rave reviews on zomato and of course i was super impressed after my first visit. This place is located on sudder street in the same strech as fairlawn. Ambience is something which one should not expect of this place but having said that, it is maintained well( everything was neat and clean).On my first visit, we were in a group of three, and we ordered a chicken lasagne, a vegetable pizza, one masala lime soda and one plain lime soda. The lasagne was delightful. It had ample cheese and pasta and the white sauce was yummy to the core. The pizza was a veg one but it was delicious.I loved the crust which was thin with the perfect crunch. We ordered a cheeseburst one and the cheese was literally dripping all over from the pizza. However on my 2nd visit, things were a little downhill. We ordered chicken farmhouse steak, chicken in rosemary sauce, grilled fish in lemon butter sauce and a chicken supreme pizza. The pizza was excellent,..no doubt. However the chicken is rosemary was just an average dish. The flavour of the rice and the rosemary sauce didnt go well. The farmhouse steak was a confusing dish, as the pasta part served with the dish was excellent. It was cooked in butter and was delicious. Also the sauce in which the chicken were tossed was amazing. But the chicken pieces were not at all soft. They were dry and not at all juicy. But the lemon butter fish was a winner. I loved the flavour of the lemon butter sauce and the fish served was also fresh. They provided some extra lemon butter sauce and we were superhappy as the sauce was literally mind blowing. The price of the food is at par with the quality. There is no extra tax imposed on them which is a saviour. Despite its shortcomings this place has become a favourite of mine( all for the sake of the pizza and lasagne) and i am going back again for sure.

Tucked away in Sadar street, this joint is arguably one of the best places to have delicious food at extremely reasonable prices. Given the location of this restaurant it is always a hotspot for visiting foreigners. The staff is warm and cordial and is accommodative of any special requests with respect to the food. However, it is important to note that while this place serves extremely well prepared and authentic Italian and continental food, it is best to simply steer clear from the north Indian and Chinese cuisine. As far as the desserts are concerned, I ordered a chocolate pudding with flame was straight up unpalatable. But overall, if ordered right, this place is easily one of the best in this city.

Nice place for hangout. Had farmhouse steak, the chicken was a bit stiff but presentation was good. Though one of my friends had grilled chicken with rosemary sauce where the sauce was good bt chicken had the same problem. Another friend took the grilled fish and it was awesome. So, had a mixed experience of good food and nice ambience. The pizza was awesome though.

Yesterday was the day when me and friends decided to visit new market after ages for some shopping but alas the terrible weather also it being over crowded made us unable to do so. After walking like hungry and thirsty travellers we decided to give this place a shot after seeing such high ratings of it in zomato. The place is near fairlawn and after entering it we were so happy as it was an ac restaurant. The place is very simple and had no decorations whatsoever but at the same time neat. We took some time to decide what to order and ultimately came up with two dishes. Three of us ordered non veg lasagne which was prepared in white sauce and veg extravaganza pizza. The lasagne was priced at rs 340 and I found it extremely tasty with ample cheese sauce and meat which made it a wholesome dish. The pizza was a 10 inch one which had 6 pieces and we chose the cheese burst one priced at rs 310. The pizza had loads of onion, capsicum, baby corn, mushroom and cheese. The crust was thin and cheesy and the outer area of the crust was very crispy which I really liked. The dish was very filling and after having one slice each we were damn full and with a lot of difficulty we had to finish the second piece. My friends also ordered fresh lime soda (rs30)and masala lemon soda(rs 40). The best part was that the there were no extra tax added to the bill. I really enjoyed my meal and would definitely go back.

My current favourite is THE FARM HOUSE STEAK 😍👌🏼
Thick breast pieces of grilled chicken served with mushroom sauce, pasta and sauté veg (ask for a pair of bread if you like), deliciously amazing !! 

I have also tried their burgers and other steaks ... All are to be complimented for. 

And the quality you are getting for this price is irresistible.

How I love this place!
Blue sky Cafe belongs to my one of those all-tine-favourite-can-visit-anytime list. I have tried almost everything on their menu (which has a LOT of things I tell you). From the burgers to shepherds pie, From chicken lasagna to Farmhouse steak. This place is love. One of this city's most reasonable yet amazing place for continental food. Probably why you can always spot a bunch of foreigners roaming around the place. And yes, don't forget the flaming chocolate pudding and the delicious pancakes at the end of your meal.
P.S. the one and the only thing I would want to suggest for this place would be if they expand the seating area and have a better infra. For such amazing food this place is rather small.

Don't judge an eatery by it's ambience. I say this because the food at this place is way better than the vibes that this place would give you. I mean, it's not really the fanciest place, nor is it the most romantic.

But. But...if you're going there for the food, you surely will not be disappointed, most times, at least. We ordered a pineapple shake and a banana shake. The shakes were dead simple but delicious, light on the pocket too. Next up, we settled for a farm house steak and lasagna. I was genuinely lucky o have ordered the steak mainly because, the lasagna was amazingly not delicious. Let's just say it looked better than it tasted and as much as I hate to waste food, we did not manage to finish it. The steak on the other hand was really tasty, though the chicken could have been a lot more tender. A lot lot more tender. Nevertheless, I loved the steak.

The continental at this place is really really good. A must try.

This place has nice continental food in pocket friendly prices. We ordered chicken pepper steak, penne paste in white sauce and texas burger.The burger had its clichéd taste but the pasta was perfect neither too cheesy nor less of it and with good amount of chicken. The steak was nice too which had that schezuan feel in the dish . But what just ruined our tastebuds was the chocolate pancake . Its is just below average and tasted like the "golaroti" what we bengalis generally make for breakfast. But apart from that it is a good place for continental dishes

Visited this place multiple times. 
Pocket friendly place, and the menu has variety of food from different countries! You will know the reason the moment you step into the restaurant. It is frequented by foreigners from many nations, which may suggest you of the quality of food here.
Tried many cuisines here- Chinese, Italian.
The Chinese here is  very light and less spicy  and good for taste.
Tried my first (and only till date) lasagna here. It was okay.
Went once just to have coffee.
But the greatest food here, according to me, is the flaming chocolate pudding. It is delicious. Do try it if you visit the place.

What a lovely place to have breakfast (provided you know what to order). But make no mistake,  the ambience is pretty shady and dingy. It's simply the taste of food,  that has added to the reputation of this Cafe. I had partied hard last night and I needed a decent breakfast. A walk from the park Street metro station to the cafe was all worth it (esp since you also pass the Indian museum on your way).  It isn't really that hard to discover. Yes,  it does have a fan following amongst the westerners as well but please stop counting it as a TRP. I placed an order for the cheese omlette and the staff suggested cheese garlic toast with it. Additionally I asked for a cold coffee. It tasted so amazing,  that I've added this Cafe to my must visit list every time I'll go to Kolkata now!  All in all,  a bill of just rs.  300   and a huge smile on my face after such  a satisfying breakfast. Would definitely recommend it to everyone,  and also visit there again soon,  myself.

Well its a place you can really go to when your in the mood for frankly anything.
They have a lavish menu with so many pages and items that you might get confused at first thinking what to try...  Order what you like in and they will have it in the menu... 
Special items that caught my fancy are The chicken pepper steak, Grilled Chicken burger. 
The Indian food is less oily and spicy as compared to the Muglia food chains in town so even if you are in mood for good old Chicken bharta roti and tandoori this place won't disappoint and if u have a person in your group who only goes for fish curry rice.. They serve that too..

Highly overrated ! There's nothing much apart from the extreme foreigner fondness of the waiters to the extent of being racist to their own citizens perhaps , which is something absolutely unacceptable. 
Bland regular food with fancy names for breakfast. If a restaurant is judged by its " omg how many foreigners eat here" , no wonder it'll have so much good rating inspite of such clumsy service and average food. 
It's definitely cheap but certainly not a hidden gem.

A Xaviers must have . The morning breakfast with friends when classes started relatively late. Sudderstreet was synonymous with this place . Food is just like another small cafe . With banana pancakes my personal favorite . The favorite part being the experiences that you get to hear from the travellers who visit the cafe .

This place is located close to Treasure Island in New Market area.
Relatively small place with limited seating.
No fancy decor or seating. But you'd regret it if you judge them by their looks to not taste their food.
Seems like a joint which is pretty popular with foreigners. There are ACs in the café, however I don't know why they keep them switched off even during summer.
The menu is a really wide one. With so many options there it could take you a while to choose what to order. Finally, we settled for drums of heaven for starter, and double chicken lasagna for main.
Both dishes were pretty good. The drums of heaven were crispy yet soft, and the gravy had the right amount of hotness and sweetness. Really not much scope for complain in terms of taste, or quantity. The only little flaw I found was in the lasagna. While the top layer was completely was covered with cheese, after we went on to the second layer of the pasta, the quantity of cheese was lesser and then it was mostly sheets of pasta, white sauce and chicken.
This place is definitely worth a dry. The pocket pinch is also very affordable. Would revisit to try out some other dishes.

Yes, it's a cafe, but you can drop-in for lunch and even for dinner with family. Food is light and cheap for your pockets, but without compromising on quality, service, or even taste. There's free Wi-Fi too. Check on the password available at the back of their menu card.
 We had chicken cheese omelette with cold coffee. I was soooo bowled over, with their cheesy omelette that couldn't help but ask for another of their specialities, to try. Yes, chicken steak. Unlike, other food joints their chicken patty is wrapped with a crispy covering. It's served with French fries and vegetables. Simple yet elegant, muuuah, I loved it!! Do try.

One of the best cafes of parkstreet. Good food. Right amount of spices . decent ambiance and great food. The specialities change most of the days but the lasania was simply superb. The chicken fried steak was also one of the best things I have ever tasted. Pocket friendly and really a good place.

This tiny li'l place is truly a gem in the busy narrow lanes of park Street. Came to know about this place from my bestest foodie friend Ayesha and decided to try it out yesterday!
We reached at 9.45pm and were glad to find it open! Waiters were very courteous although we reached just 10mins before their closing time!
Coming to food... there's almost nothing that they don't serve.. breakfast, continental, pastas, pizzas,chinese, Indian, Thai. And almost everything was available.
We ordered a mushroom cheese omelette, chicken steak, fish n chips, a chef special pizza and custard. Each n every dish was perfectly made. The omelette with the outburst of cheese with every bite was just magical!!! We liked it so much that we ended up ordering another one! Had no idea that an omelette can be so delicious! All other dishes were equally awesome. The custard could have been better.. it was totally sugarless!
And the prices are just unbelievable! Such awesome food at such low cost is truly rare in this city.. go try out this place once and no one's gonna return disappointed I'm sure! :)

This small café on sudder street remains crowded with foreigners most of the time. Minimalistic decor but if you want cheap and good food, this is your go-to place. However, not every dish is impressive. For example, I dont quite know what they served in place of chocolate banana pancakes...but it tasted bland and weird and was very disappointing. But I love their pizzas- Chicken Supremo, loaded with generous helpings of chicken and molten cheese flatters your tastebuds. Also their grilled chicken burger and chicken spring rolls were quite delicious. Service is prompt but often they have seating problems during rush hours and you might find yourself having to share a table with others. One of the coolest things is that they don't charge extra vat over the food and drinks! I really liked the place and hoping to come back again sometime soon!

Always had heard about this Cafe. Well, tried yesterday here. Me and my friend had ordered Diavalo Pizza (large, cheese burst) and Double Cheese Lasagne. Well the quantity is more than filling for two people at very reasonable rates. The pizza was good and as of the lasagne the taste wasn't as good as I had expected it to be. The ambience of the cafe is not good but that makes up for the good food, AC and free WiFi that too without tax.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. Chinese, Italian, Indian, Continental or a Dessert whatever dish you order they will serve you with perfection. When you visit here, don't judge the place by its outer look or power of its ac, just go inside, order some food and then you will forget all of your previous doubts, same thing has happened with my girl.
The place is simply awesome, it comes 2nd in my mind after Peter Cat whenever I think for a good meal around Esplanade area.

One of the very first cafes, I had bookmarked and finally had a chance to visit.To start with, it didn't quite meet my expectations and the good reviews I had heard of it, nonetheless it was a welcome change from the regular cafes around the city, with it's quaint little environment and cheap rates.
As far as food goes, we had the Banana Milkshake, the Iced Lemon Tea, the Chicken Ala-king, the Chicken Sunrise Burger and the popular Chocolate Pudding with Flame.All were good, nothing much to talk home about, barring the flame pudding, which is kind of a crowd-puller out here.Not so much on taste though, just a simple pudding, what makes it special though is the alcohol content that renders this dish with a burning flame, which to be honest, is pretty much an amazing dish to behold.
Coming to the staff and ambience, well they are courteous and the place mainly consists of foreign tourists, with a handful of local people..There's free wi-fi and it's a big plus, right behind the policy of no extra tax, which makes this place all the more viable.Lastly, keeping all things in mind, this is pretty much a nice and light-on-pocket restaurant to have good, fulfilling food and one that surely deserves a second visit.

Contrary to what the restaurant might look like from the inside and out, the food is hygienic and rather tasty. It is pretty easy to find and the staff members are cordial, though a little slow in every sense of the word. The menu is very long and you are bound to find something to satisfy your taste buds. The pricing is affordable and there is free WiFi available.

Intro : Tucked in Sudder street ,can be easily located - this was in my wish list for some time now - Minimum ambience- air conditioned 

Food - Farm House Steak - It consists of 4 chicken steaks , dry pasta , sauteed veggies and a special sauce  .

The pasta was nice and tasty , sauteed veggies fine, liked the sauce .
Coming to the steak - well marinated , the sauce tasted nice, however I thought a bit of more marination was required for the steaks - could have been much more soft 3.5/5

Overall - Had read a lot about this place in Zomato ,but I can only rate 3.5 with my current dish - will definitely come back for more ! 3.5/5

Blue Sky Cafe is located in Sudder Street in Esplanade. It is one of the hidden gem of kolkata which serves great food at reasonable prices.. I really liked the chicken pepper stake,fried chicken wings in sweet and chilli sauce, grilled chicken wth rosemary sauce that we odered and they serve a wide variety of continental dishes and pizzas as well.. the kebabs are also tasty. The wide variety on the menu is impressive! A visit to this food joint during a shopping spree in Esplanade is a must for me! 😉

Blue Sky Cafe provides you with a wide variety of Continental, Chinese, Thai and even North Indian cuisines. Situated near the Indian Museum, this cafe is a nice hub for people shopping in New Market area. Costs of foods are reasonable, quantity and quality both surpass expectations. Foods were awesome in taste. We ordered a fusion between Chicken Jai Thai Flat Noodles from the Thai menu, along with North Indian side dish, Methi Chicken. Even the waiter was a bit confused and tried to suggest us, but well then foodies know what they are ordering. And we loved the fusion. Ambience nothing different, air-conditioned, but the tables are very closely placed. Anyway, when the food is good, a rating of 8.5 out of 10 is deserving.

Located in Sudder Street, this place is a hub for people in an and around New Market area. Now if you go there expecting some kickass interior then you'll be disappointed. However if you go there solely to soak in the varied culture presence ( tourists all over the world who visit Calcutta end up going to this place) and enjoy good food, this is your place my friend. There will be times when you might have to stand in a queue to get a place to sit. The food menu comprises of continental food as well as food closer to the land (hint: biriyani). I'd however suggest to stick to the continental menu( because c'mon!) My favorites of this place are the jumbo chicken burger and the nutella pancake. :)

Blue Sky Cafe is a nice dinning out place in Sudder Street. Most of their chinese dishes have the European touch, which makes the taste really yummy. Though ambience is not near perfect, the pocket does not burn much here. Service is fast too. After a shopping session at New Market it can be your perfect spot for petpuja!

It was simply yumm! Complete justification done with our taste buds, although the pan cake wasn't upto the mark. But that can be ignored. The service was also good.

The Food is Awesome. Pizza to Steaks its all perfectly done. Its hard to believe when you see the place but its must try. They have the best Breakfast available in town, thy the green Vegetable omelet and chicken omelet. Sausages are superb. one of the few places in kolkata where you would get chicken steak that tastes like chicken steak and not some barter fried chicken pakora... Though never tried Indian food here but they have lot of optons, i believe it wont let you down. 4.0 is Totaly for the food and staffs who are jovial. Place needs a little bit of renovation but who cares as long as its good lip smacking food

Tiny things often pack a mighty punch; this place surely does.
This blink-n-miss place is near Fairlawns, has ac, very little in terms of decor but very clean. 
I treated for my birthday here, almost a year back with a double chicken lasagna. Service was smiling and fast, and they've free WiFi (weird passwords everytime xD). The lasagna was extremely cheesy and was filled with minced chicken, and a perfect, silky white sauce, though I wish there was a bit of sourness to cut through the richness, but very filling and satisfying.
I've came back for the club sandwich and the chicken cheese sandwiches, both of which are very well made, thoughtfully customised, and very filling. I also loved their freshly pressed juices, they come without sugar on request. 
Also, strangely, the hot and sour soup not gloopy and great as well, and can give a run to major joints with its gingery peppery brothy goodness. 
Best of all, prices are very affordable and well curated.
Such a surprise, this joint, and I love it to the core :)

So finally after keeping this place in my bookmark list for quite a long time, it is now time to mark the item as completed . And I will cross this item of my list with more or less a satisfied appetite . 

This small cafe is not unknown to the foodies of Kolkata but I can still bet a lot if people have not checked this out yet . This is located at shudder Street, very near to the fairlawn bar . Firstly the biggest disadvantage of this place in the ambience . It is a small cafe with glass tables and hygiene is something they should really be careful with . I saw the waiter pouring sauce in the sauce containers from gallons which were kept below the basin . The sweet lime that was ordered was made in front of me using sods bottles and it was something I preferred to be done behind me . So these were something which really dissapointed me before even starting my meal .

But to be frank, people donot come here for the ambience . They serve a variety of food starting from breakfasts to pizza to pasta to continental to Chinese and this is really a good place for guys who are still students and are looking for pocket friendly place .

Coming to the food we ordered 3 dishes which are supposed to be the highlight of this place .

1. Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce ( 4 / 5 )
2. Chicken pepper stake ( 4 / 5 )
3. Chocolate pudding in flame ( 2 / 5 )

Coolers : -
1. Fresh lime soda sweet ( 3 / 5 )
2. Pineapple milkshake ( 4 / 5 )

Except for the choco pudding the food was really commendable . The grilled fish was well cooked and the butter sauce made it yummy . They are served with French fries making the dish quite a wholesome in a place like shudder Street . 

But the total blockbuster was the chicken pepper stake . Yes , it's stake and not steak . It is a Chinese dish to our surprise and the preparation is like gravy noodles . The chicken pieces were tender , it was coated with awraroot but that did not hinder the taste .

The coolers were super cool , nothing to complain . So yes you should absolutely have a visit and order the dishes as mentioned and you will probably not regret them , just don't go looking for the ambience .

I've been here numerous times. I've tried their Chicken steak, their pizza and I liked them both. Today I ordered Bolognese as suggested and I admit I didn't quite like the taste. Somehow the tangy taste doesn't go with me.
You'll like the place totally on your preferences and on what you order. So, don't judge by them by the reviews but you should go, try what they have in offer.
Prices aren't really cheap if you consider the quality and quantity.
On the other hand, the perks are free wifi, loads of foreigners and live screening of matches.
Worth trying.

As termed by zomato! 'Rare gems' is the exact word for this place. Located next to the Indian museum! This place serves one of the best pizzas pastas and pudding. We almost had everything from the menu here! Starting with the cheese burst pizza which did not come up to the expectations. But the Tetrazzini, mac and cheese and pasta in white sauce where amazing. Yes, everything where cheese sauce based! Being a cheese lover. It had to be. Had the burning chocolate pudding. Good way to end the course! Would recommend to try the Tetrazzini! The best thing! It was every pocket friendly!

Tried the Chicken and Cheese Sandwich, Chicken Sunrise Burger and Nutella Pancake. While the sandwich was okayish, the burger and pancake were downright horrible. The burger was too dry for my liking and the 'pancake'(I doubt whether I should call it that or not) was like a chilla and the nutella topping wasnt generous at all. I found this place to be very overrated. Maybe this place has made name but unless they improve the quality of the food they are serving, I see a very bad future ahead for them.

After a long time, my sister and me were going to dine out..seeing the reviews on Zomato we decided upon this place.

The service is satisfactory and the same goes with the ambience..the food was good both portion wise and quality wise.

I would recommend creamy folded lasagna for vegetarians..it has broccoli, spinach, corn and paneer filling wrapped in lasagna sheets with cream and well baked mozzarella cheese on top..for the non vegetarians, bolognese is a must try..it is spaghetti with shredded chicken in meat sauce (I personally love this brown sauce and very few places in Kolkata use this sauce)..chicken lasagna is also a good option..one plate is sufficient for two people..

Overall good place with a variety of food choices.

Good food at the right price, aptly said.
Very good number of options in menu, you could choose over various dishes.
We were hungry and thought to go with noodles, rice and rice noodles, :P
Shanghai chicken and one continental dish were ordered along with.
To my surprise, every dish was truly good, you would not feel the same noodles or rice served at hundreds of places. Shanghai chicken was excellent. Would like to taste baked pasta.
Highly recommended. #hiddengem

Few recommended items are club sandwich (non-veg), chicken steak, Kentucky chicken burger, chicken lasagna, pastas and strawberry shake...

Update: went there today and tried their Greek salad...and it was wow!! Never new salads could taste so nice...it's a must for salad lovers...

This place had been in my wishlist for quite sometime...until I finally managed to drop in..finding this outlet is quite a task..if you are new to the place...all hail Google Maps..
So, we went by the much raved dishes this place offers..
Starting off with
Mocha and Jafa milkshake...Mocha was plain ol cold coffee...but the Jafa is a beauty I recommend all to try for once...the odd combo of orange and chocolate...is quite a surprise and delight to the taste buds..
Next we went for Chicken Double Lasagna..which arrived as expected...lot of gooey cheese interspersing lasagna noodles..it was quite filling..The Chicken Hawaiian Salad, wasn't quite the right choice...i felt the combo strange enough...lacking dressing and forcibly trying to compliment chicken with fruits...
However what swept me off my feet was the Choco pudding in flames...it sure does live up to its repute...and no lexicon of words can describe it...its just...just...
Nevermind...why don't you try for yourself??

If u like the hustle of new market area and a crowd of foreigners gossiping in their tongue , blue sky cafe is the one u would love to be. Not a much decorated restaurant but as long as u get authentic Lasagna who cares. Not only me but also my Italian neighbour was enjoying his food and appreciating it in his language. Adding on with a Hawaiian salad , I felt a bit low on the dressing. To end up with the dessert , the chocolate flame pudding was something which surpassed all my high hopes , the mixed taste of chocolate and wine just made me dig into more of it.

I have heard about this cafe a lot as its quite popular in this part of the city and old as well. On my recent visit to esplanade I tried this place. If you visit this place in the morning we will find mostly foreigners sitting here as they serves really good English breakfast. Ordered CHICKEN BAKED LASAGNA, CHICKEN STEAK, MANGO juice and SWEET lime soda. I heard about lasagna so I opted for it and my friend likes steaks so he wanted to try it out here. Lasagna tasted delicious. If you are on diet don't dare to try it as its full of cheese and mayo sauce and all sorts of calories.. But I loved it. The upper crust of baked pasta tasted like cheese and the item was very well stuffed with chicken pieces like every single spoon of lasagna you got pasta cheese chicken mayo and I don't know what else was there but tasted too good. The steak was very juice and well good. I have tried steak in other places but there it was not that juicy so one needs to chew it a lot. Both the items were more than enough for one person like one dish can be shared by 2 people. It coasted me approx 650 bucks for this delicious evening meal.

This isn't as hidden as you'd expect. Plus, the decor is negligible. So once you enter such an establishment, you expect to be treated with oodles of goodness in every bite / sip.

But alas! That just isn't the case. The Canadina Ham Pizza has a base which is almost a burnt paratha. There is almost no salt (yes, I am indeed a salt Nazi) and the toppings aren't done properly. The pineapple juice is the saviour.

I wonder why people flock to this place?! Just go elsewhere folks.

It is a small restaurant in sudder street and remains crowded with foreigners all the time.The tables are joined with each other.So do not expect to spend a quiet alone time with your loved one.You are bound to share the table with others during rush hours.And we loved this system.We ended up talking to a french couple who were really friendly.Now,the food.Really good.We had ordered the dubble chicken lasagna,fish and chips,grilled fish with lemon butter sauce and 2 fresh lime sodas.All the dishes were good esp the grilled fish.The mayo that came with the fish and chips was outstanding.I found the lasagna a little watery and bland.They do not have vat here.Yay to that.I had a lovely experience and would definitely go back again.

The steak could have been a bit more tender but the gravy was delicious. The lasagna was loaded with cheese and scrumptious chicken filling. Loved it!

I was force-fed the pizza here by a good friend, who, like many, believe that food, when wasted, is a bad habit because lot of poor people don't get to eat. That, of course, is wrong from a pure economics perspective, but what is more important here is that it is wrong from my gastronomical sanity point of view as well, since the ham and sausage medium pizza was that insanely dry, dough-y, unseasoned, and nearly inedible. 

It is strange to come from a place with such good and fond reviews from so many reviewers. To have one's heart broken from disappointing food is one thing, but to subject one's intestine to digest today's pizza is to take one's digestive ability to another level. 

The one mark is only for the pineapple juice and the friendly staff.

This place has always been my safe heaven. If you are a cheese addict then this is the place to be. Their pastas and pizzas ooze with cheese and will leave you drooling for more. 
The chocolate flaming pudding is a bit overrated because it does not taste great. However the flame does make it an interesting item. 
This isnt a posh place but the perfect haven to kick back and eat to your fullest without paying VAT.

Zomato says a foodie favorite. And hence we were there for lunch after searching for a pocket friendly option. But sorry to say I was left wanting for more. 
Ambience wise pretty ordinary. Serving time is quick. Not much details are given to niceties. Masala lemon soda was average. Chicken taipei was awesome. We had specifically ordered a less spicy version and it was so delivered. Chicken pieces were soft and beautifully cooked. Quantity sufficient. Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce was a let down. D quality of fish wasn't good. Felt stale like. Proportions though were good. Chocolate pudding with flame was decent. The brandy makes it bitter to start with but the pudding is really smooth. 
Pocket pinch 580. 
Can b back for taipei. But taipei alone.

We ordered pepper chicken, chicken agratin, chicken fried rice, chkn thai rice and shredded chkn in devil's sauce, sweet lime soda.. They took a long time to serve but the food was delicious. But the service was horrible.. they served the rice but the side dish was not served with it.. they served the side dish after around 15 mins, when we asked them again..
Overall u can give it a try for their food..

The map marking is wrong. One need to enter sudder street from the park Street flyover side and head straight till the first right turn. The restaurant is at the corner of the turn.
We ordered prawn spring roll (rating 3), Lasagne Alforno (rating 3.5) and coffee. Ambience is 1.5. Service 3.
On another visit we ordered chicken gravy noodles and Taipei chicken. Both are 4.
But I found a rat running on the floor that made me decide not to visit the restaurant again.

Good food at reasonable price, the only issue I have with this joint is that they don't serve red meat. You must try their Chicken Pepper Steak for lunch/ dinner and Egg Chicken Club Sandwich for breakfast. The joint opens at 8am so you can have your breakfast there after a morning walk at the maidan.

There hasn't been a time in the last 6 years years that we have visited New Market but not had food at the Blue Sky Cafe. The thought of it is sheer blasphemy! We love the food here. It's cheap, there's a lot of variety and it tastes awesome. So no, we do not mind the waiters who hem and haw and fawn over the large troops of foreigners who have made it their haunt. I guess it's a part of its identity. Along with its amazing mango juice, the scrumptious Sunrise Burger and the Chicken Pepper Steak. Lovely, lovely, lovely food. Nothing like making a quick pitstop here after a few too many beers at Fairlawn or shopping induced exhaustion. What we love here?
The Spaghetti Bolognaise- incredibly filling and delicious, oozing with cheese and red sauce, with minced chicken.
The Chicken Tikka Kebabs and Naan- big portions and very satisfying.
The Chicken Pepper Steak- SO. VERY GOOD. JUST. TRY. IT.
The Grilled Fish with Rosemary Sauce- Bhetki that's grilled to perfection served with lemony rosemary sauce. Yum!
The Nutella Pancakes- Easily one of the best pancakes I have had in Calcutta. It's a thin, large pancake with a generous slathering of Nutella. Sheer sin.
The Sunrise Burger- It's so good. So much better than burgers in the fast food joints. Fresh and non greasy, comes with a side of potato chips and salad.
Other items of note are the cheese balls, the grilled chicken salad and the chicken risotto. Most of the food items here are really awesome and very pocket friendly. Love it. :)

Went there first time after reading its reviews on zomato. And the food did not disappoint me at all. Ordered a veg lasagne and chicken pepper steak. Good to see that they gave extra fill up for sweet lime soda which I hvnt found at any place I have been till now. Good Italian and continental menu. Place is a favourite hang around for foreigners. A must try for all foodies whenever they go to esplanade.

Found a gem in the city. Good quality food with excellent service I had the chicken burger and chicken steak in rosemary sauce. Both preparations were up to the mark chicken well cooked and juicy. I specially liked the burger with potato wedges on the side served with coleslaw.
Menu offers a diverse pallet with many cuisines. The ambiance though is a downside place being a bit dingy. Affordable pricing however balances that out for me.

Coming from Siliguri, whenever I visited Calcutta, I stayed at Sudder Street. And Blue Sky Cafe was a place that always fascinated me. Whenever you walk in, you find this place filled with foreigners. 
A little place with around 25 seats, but the food they serve satisfies tourists from all over the globe. You will find old French couples digging into continental dishes, Italian solo travelers satisfied with their pasta and so on. 
They have a very extensive menu, and so, even after visiting a multiple number times, I haven't been able to taste most of their dishes, but dishes like Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce, Penne Alfredo, Chicken Schezwan are very good. Great taste, and quick service. I have even seen some of the waiters speaking in other languages, which shows their dedication towards serving this area, which is abound with foreign tourists. And all the prices are tremendously affordable. This is a place you can go and enjoy with your friends even when you dont want to lighten your wallet a great deal.

Blue Sky Cafe is located nearby Fairlawn on Sudder Street,the place is really small,with nothing to talk about the decor.Though its called a cafe they actually have a lot of things on their menu which is unlike a cafe.Yesterday while we were around this place and was damn hungry,seeing the good ratings here on Zomato we decided to try this place.My friend had ordered some sandwich and i had ordered for Mixed Thai Noodles,and i loved the taste of it. The service was fast too.You can  definitely give it a try if u r around and looking for some quick bites.

It's one of those spend time with yourself day. So I decided to start with Blue Sky Cafe. Somehow solo dates are meant to eat at places where people don't like coming with  me. The service is amazing. It's fast. The waiters don't judge. I'll tell you why. My petit body ate so much. The ambience is so paharganj. Foreigners who've come to eat alone. No random chit chat. The manager ruined it in the end by being way too loud for comfort and breaking my nostalgic dreams. 
Now with the more important things. Fooood! I started with Mushroom cheese omelette and mix fruit juice. Juice was good. I shouldn't have any complaints with the omelette but I'd like it if the cheese had melted a little. Then I tried Aloo Dum. Aaaah. I really liked that. It was random because I never eat dishes like this ever! Good experiment! Last mein I ended with Chicken Sausages. They were hmm. The Sausages had cheese in them but too dry! I don't know what it was but wasn't perfect. 
So the food was easily 4/5 but the ambience blew me away. This review is just based on how this tiny place took me down the memory lane! Thank you!

I had had chicken macaroni agratin. It was delicious with lots of cheese and chicken.. Fries 🍟 were not crispy... Crispy mushroom in sauce were really crispy and with strong flavour.. Ambiance is at par with the prices... Service is good. There is only one complaint that the macaroni was bland... Maybe because there are too many foreigners visiting this place and they can't handle the spiciness.. But with oregano, pepper, chilli in vinegar and a little sauce made it good to go.. The prices are very reasonable.. 4 people getting a bill of 600 is cheap enough for this kind of restraunts...

Good ambience and great food. One of the best continental cafes in and around the Esplanade area. And though the cafe's a little heavy on the pocket, the quality and taste of the food they deliver suffice for it quite nicely.
Best bets, Chicken Alaking and Nutella Pancakes!

Food might not fill the need of your taste buds but your tummy will be happy if you treat yourself to a cold juice or milk shake. I have a great liking for their variety fruit juices and milk shakes. If you ever feel thirsty for some juice or a milk shake, Blue Sky it is!

The restaurant is a hidden gem.We went at a perfect time so there was no problem in getting seats. It is a no frill restaurant. They give free wifi and all the food are reasonably priced and the quantity is sufficient.. more than sufficient I felt. Everything in the menu is inclusive of taxes so that is a real plus point. At least for me.
Coming to the food we ordered. Finger licking. We started with tom yum soup which was a perfect balance of sweet sour tangy and spicy. But thanks to my over eagerness I burnt my mouth fully. Then came the refreshing and cold mixed meat salad. Perfectly seasoned and a lot in quantity. 
 chicken taipei was Crispy and peppery. for dessert we took the chocolate pudding with flames. It looks really cool. And tastes good too.
Had the spring roll which was crispy and delicious.

Though Blue Sky Cafe is featured in the Hidden Gems Collections on Zomato, it's not that difficult to locate if you are familiar with the streets around New Market. Located at Sudder Street, it is just a few seconds' walk from Fairlawns. 
Loved the Tai Pei Chicken and the Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce I had here. The Tai Pei Chicken, a Chinese starter dish, was perfectly cooked, with yellow and red bell peppers, and tasted amazing. However, make sure you ask them to make it a lil less spicy cos this dish is so very tangy that it'll literally burn your mouth. The Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce came with two fairly large pieces of grilled fish, a side of french fries, salad and a lil bowl of delicious lemon butter sauce. This dish is a total winner. Had the Chocolate Pudding with Flame for dessert and loved it too. But order this only if you like how chocolate and alcohol taste together cos it comes with a thin layer of brandy on top which can make it taste a little bitter at first. Again, the Chocolate milkshake was soothing but the Strawberry milkshake could have been better. 
Frequented by mostly foreigners, the interior of this place is not that great, has a very cramped up seating arrangement, not the tidiest of places either and looks, for the lack of a better word, a little shabby. Go here only if you want to enjoy a delicious continental, chinese or italian meal at very decent prices which are inclusive of taxes, as is given on the menu chart.

This is truly a hidden gem in the city of joy. People in and around the area very well know the place but for common people you may have not even heard about it,  but this is a place that definitely should be on your list. Though the Ambience and interiors are like any other road side air conditioned eatery but the food they cook in here is to die for....  Located in a bi-lane in sudden street near Indian museum you can simply order anything from their menu and you are surely gonna love it,  from Continental Affairs to the Italian Love and even their North Indian has got a mean streak to look out for.. 
A place you should not miss, hence if you can't visit you can also get a delivery done too

There is a reason why Gordon Ramsay recommends restaurants to cook fresh and this little hole in the wall place proves why. Neither the menu nor the ambience is anything to write about but the food tastes great and we know we will come back here again to try something new. Regulars have their preferences but we went with the friendly waiter's recommendation of choosing from Chinese and Continental menu - which is apparently their speciality.

I am a Vegetarian- and addicted to their Veg Pasta "Pene Arrabiata" - however I don't forget to remind the chef to keep a tab on the Basil leaves while ordering.
Portion is quite a lot for one person at times.
Price is pocket- friendly while you step in for lunch / dinner.

Quantity n quality both are perfect. Worth your time and money. Plus you get an nice ambience. Now if m bored then i know where to chill :) We had drums of heaven,barcetta pizza, lapchi kai chicken.

After reading a lot of positive ratings by fellow zomatians,atlast we decided to give it a try.
Located in Sudder street,by the side lane of Indian Museum and opposite to Fairlaws hotel..and in case u still cant find if,there is always Google Map.
Coming to the decor,nothing too much to say.However the small ceiling fans were really cute.The seating accomodations may me maximum of around 30 people.The plus point is the Free Wi-Fi.

Being too hungry,we thus started the gastronomic journey.
We ordered the Blue Sky special pizza with extra cheese burst.A thin crusted pizza with variety of meat and other spices and with extra cheese its surely was delight.
Coming to the main course we ordered,
Chicken ala king,Grilled Fish with lemon butter sauce,Grilled chicken with rosemary sauce,Chicken macaroni agratin.The chicken ala king was too delicious with succulent pieces of chicken in a large bowl of cheese.same goes for the grilled chicken and grilled fish.However the Chicken macaroni agratin was not too special with only macaroni and chicken pieces in white sauce.Even after these we were eager for more and thus ordered a Chicken lasagnia and it was just too yummy.
In the desserts we had the Chockolate Pudding with Flame which was deep chockolate in brandy.
The only negativity which i felt was the service was not too prompt.
However if u want a value for money food with a great taste,surely u must try this.
Truly this is a hidden jem.
Looking forward of visiting again
happy dining.

My first visit was not too pleasant...pasta had too much of red sauce while chocolate pudding lacked taste...after hearing so much about the place had higher expectations...would like to try it out again...a handy option for a quick bite...although the place is quite small so getting a place can be tricky at times...free wifi can just be an add on...can never be the main attraction of a food joint

Went to this tiny hidden away place on a day out shopping with a friend. I had bookmarked it for quite a while now after being recommended by a couple of friends. Quite an off route locale for me. But I went anyway. And I'm glad I did. The food here is pretty amazing. A huge menu with all my favourite genres in it, ample in amount, really tasty. A bit on the pricy side yes, but its worth it. We had the Costa Dina spinacci, a baked dish, and tai pei chicken. Loved them both. The nutella banana pancake was a bit of a disappointment. But I'm gonna surely come back to try more items. A good discovery for me.

The pepper stake is marvellous and so is the grilled fish in lemon butter sauce. The mango and chocolate milkshake are amazing. But i didnt find the choco pudding in flames that good unlike other reviews. Service was friendly and prices are very cheap. Amazing experience.

In the lane beside the Indian Museum and looking not-so-special from outside is the Blue Sky Cafe, home to mouth-watering continental, Chinese, Thai and Indian fare at very reasonable prices. I loved their Chicken Hawaiian salad, and it was such a delight to look at (see picture)! The grilled fish is served with a lemon butter sauce that is so good you shall be licking your fingers. I had also tried the Spaghetti carbonara, and though I've had better, this was a good choice at this price.
Needless to say the food more than satisfied

Finally managed to pay this delightful little place a visit. The place is a bit low on design but they make up for it with the thing that matters the most... FOOD! The moment you walk in here you are get that feeling that you are doing the right thing... that this place simply has to make your tummy happy, and trust me... it does that very much. We tried a pasta, the Penne Alfenso, which was pretty decent with perfectly cooked veggies and the melt-in-your-mouth meat. The pizzas are definitely great for your palate and very filling indeed. The Cafe Special Pizza with a crust load of tasty treats is what pizza lovers should go for! I personally loved the biscuit like thin crust with just the exact amount of crunch. The Chicken Caldo pizza was decent enough if not as lovely as the previous. One should note that although the toppings may not equal a lot of great pizzas the Caldo does provide a lovely golden fried chicken, which is a treat in itself. Proceeding as per popular opinion we went for the Chocolate Pudding in Flames... but that venture went up in flames like the alcohol in the dish. It simply looks good but is a complete waste of money. The prices are a tad on the higher end of the spectrum, but the money you spend here is money well spent! Will definitely try to get back here some other time to try out more of their offerings.

Visited here for the first time. We ordered coriander prawn clear soup which was good and served with ample prawns and veggies. The taste was good.
The second ordered was lasagna alforno which was good and it had a sour and tangy flavour. The veggies and chicken in it was not that soft. 
The next items were chocolate pancake and rice kheer.
The pancake was a plain jol ruti with chocolate sauce over it. I didnt like it though. The kheer was made o of basmati rice and it tasted more like doodh bhaat.
The ambience was noisy and yes its frequented by the foreigners.

This place is a cultural melting pot.  It's a place where Indians come to taste the continental food and the foreigners try the Indian food.. It's located in the backpackers hub - Sudder Street. The waiters here is multilingual and really knows how to connect with the customer.  And he treats everyone equally unlike other restaurants where the Europeans are preferred over Indians and chinese.  The menu card is huge and I was spoilt for the choice.  The waiter suggested me the chicken steak in pepper sauce.  It was different from the orthodox steaks.. It was more like a curry. But it was tasty nonetheless.  But the French fries were a bit soggy..  The price was very reasonable.. Only suggestion is that too include Mutton, lamb etc and stick not only to Chicken

My friend and I decided to go to Blue Sky Cafe since they served many cusines and we literally fell in love with the place and the food. In our 5 day stay in Kolkata, we visited Blue sky cafe for 3 meals. 

Ambiance: Its a very simple place yet there is something about it which is extremely appealing. They also have free Wi-Fi

Food: They serve pancakes, omlettes, cereal, paratha, chinese, thai, indian, italian etc. We had Cheese toast, Peanut butter toast, Capsicum onion cheese toast, Momo's, Ginger fried rice, and Veg Manchurian. Each and every item ordered was simply yummy. The pancakes looked very tempting (sadly it had eggs in them) so we were unable to try them. Everyone else seemed to love them. 

Pricing: Very very nominal. 

Service: Absolutely brilliant. My friend and I will never forget the person who attended to our table. :)

Overall: Must go to place!

We had venzia : spaghetti with perfect amount of cheese, perfectly baked with spinach , veggies and chicken.. ; lime soda ( loved it the way the serve the extra soda, but presentation could have been better) ; Taipei chicken : cause I was dying to have something spicy and flaming chocolate pudding for dessert ( though tasted alot like bourn vita , but flaming alcohol increased the taste)
The service was decent, price though a bit on the higher side amount and taste suffice for it...

This place was neither on my bookmarked list nor on my wishlist. Neither it was an on-spot desicion. But it was a quick descicion. I and my friend were on a hunt for a place to have a quick bite as the time was around 3 pm approx. So quick bite k liye quick desicion. And we headed towards blue sky cafe, one of the most popular places in new market area. I was very happy as i could write a review as i had not visited the place before.

Location -- just take lindsay street. Turn right. Head towards sudder street and wolla u r there. It is one of the easiest located places. If u don't know the area take google map help.

Ambiance -- the ambiance was quite simple. When we reached we could find mostly foreigners and another family. The waiters are prompt and the place is not clumsy. It can accommodate approx 30 to 40 people at a time. I want to mention one special thing . The ceiling fans out there are so cute. I forgot to click them but they are really cute and small. Next time u visit please do look up. :-)

Food -- we ordered choco milkshake, cold coffee with ice cream , chicken keema cheese grilled sandwich, corn and cheese sandwich and spanish spice pizza. I know the quantity is definitely not for a quick bite but i really do have a disgusting habit of ordering more than needed. Now head towards the menu.

The shake and coffee was quite good. The milkshake was a little more dilute than required which made the thing a little bland. The thing was a combination of cadbury choco powder and milk and water. Though quite average it was tasting nice at that time.

Coffee was pure nescafe. No specialities. Cold and ice cream filled. Very normal but tasty.

Chicken keema cheese grilled sandwich was the nicest. It had chicken keema and cheese mixed together. Very tasty and totally recommended.

Corn cheese sandwich was regular corn and cheese without any hint of speciality. It was quite average.

Pizza was simply the best part. It had cheese, it had toppings. We had cheese burst crust and so the crust also had cheese. Obvious though. The pizza was tasty and nice. The tangy taste of tomato at the bottom of the toppings added to that required wow factor.

And not to mention the size. Though it was large size it was so large that we couldn't finish it off. Told u i have a disgusting habit.

In all a very pleasant experience.

If i am in and around esplanade and want a quick bite i will surely drop in here.

With free WiFi and a widespread menu, Blue Sky Cafe is the place where you would wanna be if you are a college student, hungry and/or broke. But jokes apart, I was impressed with their Burgers. Jumbo Burger was pretty filling as the name would suggest, and tasted great. Would definitely go back for more.

This is a joint I've been to a number of times. So, I could really vouch for their food! The Baked Fish is my all-time fav from this restaurant! The gooey cheesy fish dish is a must try! It's quite heavy, but worth it completely! I tried the Grilled Chicken with Lemon Butter sauce and voila! it was pretty amazing! The lemon-butter sauce was to die for. ( yep, that good). I've tried their Mixed Hakka Noodles one, and it was pretty delicious and was served a large portion. The Custard Pudding is a huge let down, bought from a nearby shop and served! Now, the star, The Chocolate Pudding with Flame!! The chocolate, the alcohol, the burnt taste, the chocolate again, it's a huuuuuge win!! It's a must try and best dish served by BSC!
Now, the issue here is the billing. That's right, I've visited this joint 6 times, and they have screwed my bill 4 times out of that. What they do is, they (quite deliberately) write the amount for each dish wrong, so when you add the bill up, it sums up perfectly, but is actually charging you more (by Rs.150 once)! I however hold on to my menu cards, re-check the bill and pay only after that. Make sure you do that, otherwise "pocket friendly" tag will be down the drain!
I come back here solely for the food! #WillVisitAgain #ThumsUp #Foodie

Liked it! Google maps guided us there, and turned out just the one I had guessed. It serves everything right from breakfast to dinner and the place is loaded with foreigners. There was a old foreigner guy having dinner and the waiter was saying.."daaduu" here is your food! :D People are nice and friendly. Anyway the food is pretty good and cares the pocket. Burgers aren't very spicy but tasty. Quantity is also good.

It is a wow place for me. We had delicious chicken alaking (baked chicken and veggies in cheese sauce), chicken pepper steak and fish in butter lemon sauce. Pepper steak has a big fried chicken with assorted veggies and was yummy. We ordered chocolate pudding. A bowl full of buttery smooth rich chocolate pudding with a thin film of wine and a dazzling blue flame over it. Well, the taste took me to heaven :)

This is the second best restaurant I have discovered till date. What an amazing place. Such lovely items at affordable rates, my favourite place to look forward to when low on budget. Have tried many of their offerings and my personal favourite is the jumbo burger. It's equivalent to food orgasm, the best burger I have had ever.

Well this is another place everyone in calcutta must visit.... It's not fancy but it has a character of its own....  Situated in a corner of sudder Street it gets its fair share of foreign tourists...  The food is quite good even if it's not God send.  Try the milk shakes and the honey ginger tea which is my favourite.  The pizza is good and I also like club sandwich.  
Always check the bill carefully as tabulation errors occur due to the rush...

Today morning I was looking for some small bite in the area and the name popped up.  I've seen the place probably forever since the days of Jamuna cinema but never ventured inside. Once inside we loved the menu.  We ordered mango lassi, chicken cheese mushroom omelette, pancake and some French fries. The food was served super fast. The omelette was amazing with heaps of cheese. Pancake was missing the fluffiness of pancake but the taste was good nevertheless. The rest of the order was also quite tasty. The best part is the portions and the value for money. It's cheap clean and tasty. What more can I want. Definitely recommended. The place also provides free wifi.

Located just opposite fairlawns, This famous cafe is small in size but packs a lot of punch through its food. The restaurant is very small and crowded mostly with foreign tourists and one would be lucky to find seats. Also there was only one waiter taking orders and serving everyone present. At first we thought that it would infinity for us to get the food but to our pleasant surprise the service was very quick. Coming to the food, we had ordered Mixed noodles and Grilled chicken in teriyaki sauce which was awesomely delicious. And judging by the looks on other people faces while they had their food it looked like they were enjoyed a lot. One f the most positive things about blue sky cafe, it is very much pocket friendly and if you are tired of walking around new market and want quality food at a cheap price..this is your place.

It's in an alley off sudder street very close to fairlawns.The place is small and congested,and the ac really needs to be cranked if you show up for a hot summer dejeuner.They make good flavoured soda.The honey soda was actually better than masala soda.We were however,highly disappointed  with the thai tom yum prawn soup.It was ore or less a distilled chicken gravy with some veggies and a few  flyspeck shrimps thrown into the mix.The fish and chips had gracious amount of fish and it tasted good with the tartar dip,but then again they made horrible fries-the potatoes were cut in the shape and size of ladies finger,unpeeled and unkempt.It wasn't difficult to gather that the place has been set up to dish out as much as foreign cuisine as possible without paying much attention to the quality of the output,so as to snare foreigners with an "Indie" version of their hometown specialties.Fortunately for them,the idea worked,but I really hope they bring in a better cooking staff,even if not the top notch cognoscente.

I visited this place last week along with one of my fellow foodies for lunch. The place is located quite at the heart of New Market and is pretty easy to locate. I had been to Raj Spanish Café, so it was again easy for me to locate this eatery.

AMBIANCE ----- I did not like the ambiance, also it is not very spacious, few seating arrangements are there and tables are all placed together to accommodate maximum customers. You might have to share table with strangers as well, which is a huge let down for me. It's actually hard to rejuvenate yourself when you are seated in an eatery with such unclean interiors and shabby ambiance. I just liked the small ceiling fans which looked pretty cute. But I don't think the place is lively either, rather it's cramped up and pretty noisy, the place might be good for tourists / youngsters / young group of friends because of the low prices of the food items and diversified food menu.

FOOD ----- In the menu you will find several food options like - North Indian, Italian, Chinese, Continental, Thai, etc. I personally do not like places who try to serve everything. I have heard about their continental dishes so we decided to go for two continental main dishes. Food is pretty average to say the least, atleast our continental dishes were pretty mediocre. The place might be good for onetime visit if you want to go for continental food. But the place seemed to be a favorite dining spot for the tourists and foreigners who are staying nearby at Sudder Street. We ordered for:

(a) Farm House Steak:  The dish had four medium sized sliced chicken steaks which were bit tough but prepared and marinated well. The steak was accompanied by a small bowl of brown Rosemary sauce which when added to the chicken tasted pretty good. The dish has sautéed veggies like carrots, green peas, broccoli, Chinese cabbage, onions, etc. Also it has penne pasta which was cooked Al Dante, which means it is cooked just long enough that it is neither crunchy nor too soft. It is slightly under-cooked pasta and firm to bite which unfortunately my tastebuds don’t approve! Though it is known pasta cooked Al Dante is healthier, but still I like my pasta cooked Al Forno. Overall the dish tasted pretty okayish, but somehow I was missing some good mashed potato along with this :)

(b) Grilled Fish with lemon butter sauce:  The dish has got two big slices of bhetki. The quality of the fish was good and quite fresh, really enjoyed that part. But it was under-marinated and could have tasted a way lot better. It did not taste any good with the lemon butter sauce either. The sauce in itself was well-prepared, it was very buttery which I liked. The dish was served with hand-cut French Fries which were unfortunately bit soggy. Also the dish was served with sliced tomato and cucumber.

Would like to taste their burgers and pizza if I ever happen to visit this place again.

SERVICE ----- Service was moderately prompt and waiters were polite and well-informed. Water is not served in glasses, a thoroughly used bottle of regular water was placed on our table. I know the place is for casual dining, but things are way too casual here that might even lead to not-so-good dining experiences.

OVERALL ----- Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.5/5
Food quality: 3.5/5
Food presentation: 3.8/5
Value for money: 3.7/5
Ambiance: 2.3/5
Service: 3.6/5

You need to pay by cash here at this place. The pricing is pretty reasonable and that is surely one big plus point for this joint. If you've got some tried-n-tested good food item then please stick to that, trying out the varied items from that diversified menu is not one good idea. 

Cheers!

This is an interesting place. One can hardly recommend the Blue Sky Cafe for its ambiance - it's dark, shabby. The food is decent but not something that you'll necessarily talk about once out. The people waiting on you are all smiles, or relatively less-smiles depending on the colour of your skin and your nationality, if you know what I mean. The free wifi is an advantage - but of course, you can't sit here forever because it's usually always crowded, which must mean something. It's located in a brilliant place, and that is what draws me to the eatery. I'd recommend the lasagna and custard pudding.

Blue Sky is the Leopold of Calcutta. 90% of the customers at any point are sure to be foreigners and 90% of them are likely to be digging into naan and chicken curry :D This is a hole in the wall and does not boast a great ambience or food. Yet, its decidedly upbeat vibe (all courtesy the staff) will make you walk out smiling. 

We had the fries which were closer to being wedges. It was not a great start as they were simultaneously soggy and under-cooked. The mocha shake was too sugary, the masala lemonade not limey enough. Sigh. I ordered the deep pan Fruit di Mari pizza just for the pineapple (Dominos has discontinued this delicious but unpopular topping). It wasn't bad but wasn't memorable either. The alfredo pasta was a hit. Creamy well cooked pasta with veggies, as satisfying as it could get. 

Come here for the sprightly steward. In the middle of our meal, he made us share our table with 3 others and we did not swear!

So I visited this place recently and all I tried are various burgers. And they were amazing. The quantity of meat, to the molten cheese, it was twister on the taste buds. I'm eager to try the pasta and pizza at this place as it seemed quite enticing. The staff is friendly but the place isn't much in terms of ambience. Light on the pockets and a good place to eat out after college.

Blue Sky Cafe located on Sudder Street is a great favorite of the tourists who live around the area but also for local foodies most especially the younger lot. Its pocket friendly and has a good variety of tasty food. I love the Sweetlime and Orange Juice. A nice place to have breakfast their Mushroom and Cheese Omelette , Chili Cheese Toast and Nutella Pancakes are good options to pick. I also enjoy their burgers and my choice is the Cordon Bleu Burger which is pretty good. The also serve decent pizza and pastas but I usually stick to the burgers with some fresh juice when I eat here. 

There is o decor to speak of and the tables are cramped but the place has a lively vibe so especially if your a group of friends who want to grab a bite at prices that don't burn a hole in your pocket then its a good option.

Located in the heart of the city, this place cares little about the decor but makes it up in food and service. We tried the lasagna and the spaghetti in  Bolognese sauce. Both were well prepared. Helped me take a big decision. Italian isn't for me. What I loved was the chocolate pudding in flames. Imagine a average sized bowl full of chocolate, just in flame. The thing was awesome...too bad that it was just two of us and we couldn't empty the bowl. The dishes cost around 150 bucks while the pudding is just 80. This is quite a decent place to hangout all day.

A quaint little place tucked away in one corner of Sudder Street,yet undoubtedly one of the best places for continental food.
The lasagne is probably the second best here, best being Mocambo's. Pancakes are mindboggling.

Service is heartwarming.

And prices are just perfect for one's pocket.
If you haven't yet tried out this place, please do so as soon as possible. You don't know what you are missing out on.

Small, congested place. Had ordered Carbonara, Chicken steak, Double chicken lasagne and pan fried momo for a party of six. The only thing we liked was the lasagne which was covered in generous amount of cheese. Steak meat was covered in cornflour and looked like oversized chicken manchurian that wasn't good in taste either. Had been looking forward to it but was thoroughly dissatisfied with it. And the momo was too damn spicy. Carbonara tasted too bland for my liking. 
Service was good enough.

The place is near the Indian Museum. It is a small cafe and is very pocket friendly and suitable for college students. I had ordered chicken steak,my friends had ordered burger and noodles. The chicken steak was served with french fries. I absolutely loved the chicken steak. It wasn't cooked in the conventional way. It had a crispy coating which added a crunch to it. The sauce on it enhanced the taste.The french fries were tasty too. The dish might not look so good but it sure tastes good. I personally didn't like the chinese here but the burgers were good too.

Heard about this place a lot, and finally got to try it yesterday. It was around 10.30 when we reached but luckily they took our order even though it was late. We ordered baked pasta, farm house steak and chicken alaking. We had ordered for penne and they gave us spaghetti for baked pasta. Thats the only reason I am giving them a 3.5 rating. Otherwise they deserve a better rating. The food was good and I am definitely going back to try out the other dishes in their menu.

"Paisa Vasool" is the word I would use for this place.

Food is delicious and quantity is pretty good,totally worth the price.
The Baked Pasta and Blue Sky Cafe special Pizza are the must-haves.
The Pizza is a perfect blend of 'crunchy' and 'cheesy' with a generous amount of vegetables and chicken or whatever.
Wouldn't really recommend the desserts(pancakes or pudding).
Haven't tasted the Indian or Chinese dishes though.

Not much can be said about the ambience.Honestly you wouldn't mind the noisy crowd once you have tasted the food there.And there's A/C.So.

Great place to treat a group of friends.Both my visits were for my friends' birthday treats. :P

It was her birthday treat. So we decided to have something continental.Hence we walked into Blue Sky.It is a bit "cluttered",but it makes the best Double Chicken Lasagne I have ever tasted. The cheese melts into your mouth and the spicy chicken purée perfectly compliments it.I L.O.V.E.D it.
P.S : The bill won't burn a hole in your pocket.
P.P.S : Free Wi-Fi

After hearing numerous positive reviews, finally, got a chance to visit the place today! Had heard the place was famous for Continental dishes, so on receiving the menu, we quickly skipped to the continental part! Was amazed by the variety of dishes they server, so after giving quite a long thought, we decided to try BARCETTA (cheese crust pizza) &  PENEE AL POLO (pasta). The pasta came quickly & tasted yummy! Thumbs up for it! But we had to wait a while for the pizza to arrive! But when it did, it was pretty good too! Had also taken cold drinks. Loved the food altogether though the wait for pizza was a li'l bit frustrating! Coming to the ambience, the place was quite nice with equally good service! They even provided free wifi, so that was a plus! Now, the main part, no complaints about the quality or quantity of the food, all were top class! Comparing to that, the price was surprisingly low! Would recommend people searching for continental food with low budget to surely visit the place! Looking forward to a revisit! :)

Entering this place for the first time did not create that much of an impression. But when the food was served all those silly misconceptions was erased. This is perhaps one of the best places in kolkata to have awesome mouth watering food at a decent price. The best burgers can be found here. I would anyday have a jumbo burger over kfc or mac. And that banana milkshake is to fie for. Trust me my friends this is really the place to be when you want really good food awesome service when you want to hang out with your friends.

My best friend and I have been planning to try this  restaurant for quite a while. Finally on a gloomy Friday afternoon, three of us took the fall. 
First impression on entering the place is tiny and is full of foreigners/ tourists. 
We were ushered into a tiny three seat table which was right beside the sink but adjacent to the AC ! 
We ordered Chicken Pepper Stake. Chicken Texas Burger. And Chicken Macaroni Augratin. 
Drinks were packed beverages and sweet lime soda. 
The chicken pepper Stake came with a gravy of vegetables and french fries ! It tasted brilliant. The coating of the chicken was perfect and it was cooked really well. The gravy was full of flavour. 
Fries were few in number but lacked salt or crispiness. 
Texas Burger came with the burger, coleslaw and fries. 
The burger was not upto our taste. There was a layer of tomato, cucumber, meat, cheese, green olives, lettuce and ketchup..it was plain. Nothing extraordinary. 
Chicken Macaroni Augratin was a big portion. It was baked with a layer of crispy cheese on top. And the sauce was creamy and pieces of chicken was on the low side. The only lacking point was the seasoning. 
The only con of this place is the attitude of the waiters. They were a little too friendly. 
The place is bustling and the food was delightful. 
Would recommend and will come back.

If you crave for continental food and do not want to burn a hole in your pocket by opting for some classy meal in fancy restaurants, Blue Sky Cafe is the place you should come to. Any restaurant having a 4.0 and above rating in Zomato means there is something special about it and it was high time for me to try my luck on this one.

The location of this restaurant can be a little confusing if you follow the map given here. If one simply comes in front of (New) New-Market and makes his way into the lane beside the iconic Globe Cinema, as soon as you reach the end of the lane, you will need to turn left and after you walk some 10-15 steps, the cafe can be seen on your right.

Alternatively, if you are walking down towards J.N. Road from Esplanade or vice versa, enter the lane just beside Indian Museum where the iconic restaurant 'Zaranj' is located, and walk straight for 5 minutes till you see the cafe to your right (You will need to leave a lane to your left which leads to Globe Cinema)

Coming to the interiors, nothing fancy about it, The space was rather cramped with the AC really not working. The place is flocked by plenty of foreigners probably due to their pricing strategy. I was seated somewhat next to a group of foreigners who probably wanted to have their tummy full after a session of hard drinks as was evident from the smell of the liquor.

The waiter attending to me was courteous. He immediately pulled out a chilled bottle of water from the refrigerator and served me the same in a glass. I had already studied the menu from before hand and exactly knew what I wanted to order. My sit-in order consisted of Sunrise Burger and a Banana Shake. The Shake was first to come (within 5 minutes) and tasted heavenly. I would have preferred a slightly thicker consistency but then the price tag attached to it probably did not warrant for anything classy.

Next to come was the main dish, i.e. the burger. The burger was soft with the chicken patty being freshly prepared. The patty was well stuffed and did not contain any unnecessary garbage as we Bengali like to call it as 'bhusho'. The coleslaw was nothing special but the juiciness of it contributed well to the patty and together it was a heavenly combination of finger licking food. The burger was accompanied by a couple of plain chips, the ones which you usually get into the local market. This isn't the Lays one or Uncle Chips, so do not expect much out of it. By then, I was totally bowled out by their Banana Shake and I had no hesitation in ordering for another glass.

My take-away order included their popular Chicken Steak and Baked Fish. The bill came around a total of 600 Rs. exact and did not include any unnecessary VAT/Service Charge/Service Tax. Upon reaching home, it was already dinner time and we quickly jumped onto savoring the delicacies. Here is where the disappointment started. Much to the hype of the Chicken Steak, I found it rather ordinary. To me, it was more like a Chinese Side Dish, like diluted Chilly Chicken and nothing special. The portions of the Chicken was good and was mixed with vegetables, mushroom and onions.The Baked fish was not so special either. The fish was soft but not exactly crunchy and lacked the crispy nature. Furthermore, there wasn't any Oregano or Chilly Flakes to spice or flavor the dish up.

I would not stay this place serves authentic Continental or anything special which cannot be found anywhere else but if you are short on cash or do not want to spend plenty of bucks over one time of meal, this is the place you should head to. Overall worth recommending considering the quality, quantity and variety of food they offer against the relatively cheap price tag attached to them.

Once in the morning I visited on someone's strong recommendation & I openly with open heart feel to say it was a very good experience . I had Pan cake and French fry and a great black Tea. I' m  a small eater. But I had stomach full. At very justified price.
             I asked them about other tasty food stated in the Menu & they asked for the order & they are ready to Serve me promptly . Amazing ! This must be the only restaurant in Kolkata.
               But I'm sad to learn they now open it at 8.00am. But I prefer that old timing. Authority, are you listening. But I'll go for their great Sandwitch.

Location: Sudder Street; a few meters from PC Arcade & Raj Spanish Café.

• How many heads?
Four heads. 

• How was this place selected for a visit?
On a sunny afternoon having a very high temperature, a group of four friends had been contemplating over a place for lunch and landed up here after realizing Raj Spanish Café has an open seating.

• How was the place?
A place which has been here for a long time also carries the same old interiors. The place had a ceiling of average height with small fans, laminated furnitures and bluish wall colors. The seating arrangements were quite cramped to fit in as many as possible. One plus noticed was it has a high footfall of foreign as well as Indian clientele. In short, a place preferred by all (be it tourists or students: quite a large range). Always hustling and bustling with a large crowd.

• What was on offer (fare)?
The laminated menu was quite widespread with offerings from the Continental, Chinese, Italian and North Indian Cuisines.

• What did you ORDER?

- Mocha (with ice-cream)
Absolutely delicious. The mocha was well prepared and served with a dollop of Ice-cream.
Recommended (the best out of all drinks ordered).
Negative: Was served with a plate under the glass since, the drink was up to the brim and could overflow any moment; pour a bit less, customers wouldn't mind.

- Chocolate Shake (with ice-cream)
Was nicely made with the right balance of chocolate, milk and sugar. Served with a dollop of Vanilla ice-cream. Tasted decent.
Negative: The shake was served with a plate under the glass since, the drink overflowed; pour a bit less, customers wouldn't mind.

- Cold Coffee
The coffee was a complete disappointment. Way too watery with low levels of milk and sweetness. Has a great scope of improvement.

- Crispy Chilli Babycorn
The babycorns were slightly under-marinated but, were perfectly fried and tossed along with freshly chopped veggies and sichuan sauce. The corns were crisp and tossed end result tasted good. Could have been better had the marination been spot on (note: the affect of slight under-marination is negligible).

- Spinach Cheese Balls [6 pieces]
Perfectly fried balls (non-greasy) with a flavorful filling of spinach and cheese. Served on a bed of thinly sliced cabbage and carrots. Missed a dip along (chilli-mayo dip would go well; ketchup and chilli sauce were substituted instead). Nevertheless, the spinach cheese balls tasted good.

- Baked Pasta
The pasta (penne) was perfectly boiled and tossed in a flavorful primavera sauce along with fresh veggies (tomato, onion, mushrooms). Baked to perfection with mozzarella cheese on top. Tasted good.
Recommended.

- Panfried Noodles
Perfectly Panfried noodles served along with exotic vegetable gravy. Tasted good.

- Nuttella Pancake
A nicely prepared pancake with a consistent starch-based batter (since was super thin, looked more like a crepe; could have been better) served with a generous Nuttella chocolate serving. Spread and eat! Tasted decent.

• How was the STAFF CONDUCT and SERVICE?
The staff were courteous, friendly and well-informed.
The service was at a moderate speed.

• How would you categorize the COST?
The costs are slightly inclined towards the moderate end and the above fare left our pockets lighter by INR 1185 (including repeat orders).

• Any suggestions?
The seating could be a bit spaced. The service needs to speed up.

Overall a decent experience.
- Would surely return for more.
- Little flaws need to be looked upon.

Located just opposite to Fairlawns in Sudder street this place is known to many Burger Lovers..the place is a bit noicy,but the food compensates it..
Last time i went there with a few of my friends and ordered - Grilled Chicken burger,Texas chicken burger,Pineapple milk shake,Pan cake with Neutela & Chocolate pudding In Flame... The grilled chicken burger was quiet filling but we had expected a much better taste. Texas burger & the shake were really dissapointing.. 
BUT the Chocolate pudding in Flame was really Awsome- it arrived wid flame on it & after a few mins when the flame went off it tasted like Heaven.. The Pan Cake wid Neutela was also a treat to the tastebuds..
PLUS they dont charge any VAT !!!
Overall its a nice Pocket friendly place to visit with your friends if you have a sweet tooth ....

Was lucky enough to have found out this place through a friend of mine whose office is just nearby. I have had amazing breakfasts here, and I have always come to this place in groups of three or more people. Starting from college right till now, this is one gem of a place strategically located between the junction of modern food at park street and mirza ghalib street and Indian museum. This place is always filled with foreigners and gives you free wi-fi. The decor of the place may not give you a good vibe but give the place a chance to let yourself to love this place. I have always ordered peanut butter and honey toast / nutella toast with a masala omelet or a chicken cheese mushroom tomato onion capsicum omelet with extra cheese or as one of the staff likes to call it, the "everyhing omelet". Ideal to give your breakfast a power start, one can order french fries and sweet lime juice to make the meal go further. The sandwich ( veg grilled / club ) is also filling and properly grilled (neither under cooked nor burnt) and gives you a good filling sense till evening should you decide to gulp it down post having the above already.

Long on my bookmarks list, Blue Sky Cafe is a place I've heard lots of good things about from many people. Well, they certainly did not disappoint! The first thing that strikes you is the sparse Indian clientele. Then you remember that this is a cafe in the Sudder St area, so a multinational patron set is guaranteed. 
Coming to the food, I've heard good things and good things only about the burgers, so I made it a point to have one. Accordingly, I ordered the Cordon Bleu burger, if I am correctly spelling it. A juicy burger, with a decent sized patty and a layering of mayo, cheese, tomatoes and cucumber arrived, along with a portion of potato chips. I dug in and did not rest until I had finished. It was oh-so-filling, a full meal in itself. My companions ordered Noodles and Schezwan chicken and that, I'm told is also very good. 
The staff is super cool. It was raining heavily after we got out, so we turned back in after a quarter hour and the server was honest enough to ask if we wanted to order or are just inside to wait for the rain to subside. Either of which was no problem with them. 

Looking to go back soon and try out rest of the menu. Pricing is cheap enough for student pockets. :)

Visited for the first time with my friends. We ordered  chicken pepper steak, chicken alaking and mixed fried rice. 
The steak was succulent and juicy It had a pretty big portion of chicken with vegetables, fries and sauce, it was awesome.
The chicken alaking was also good. It was chicken cubes with red, green, yellow bell peppers and onion in white sauce.
Mixed Fried rice was good...
Quality and quantity were pretty good and very much pocket friendly.
This place needs to expand and get a larger space so more people can enjoy this unpretentious yet totally awesome food.

Haw been to this place many times. This is the place you would like to go when you are bored of the usual breakfast joints in the city. One of the very few good places to go for international style breakfast at a reasonable rate. It has all the breakfast items you can think of under the sun (different styles of egg/cereals/pan cakes/sandwiches etc.). The place is small but the quality of food is good and a must visit for every breakfast lover.

Anything from Indian, Italian, Chinese and Thai at a medium budget this would be the best place. Breakfast menu is the most famous and the sausages and pastas will want you to be back here again n again n again. Don't miss the burgers and sandwiches. Best place for college students around park street. ✌

This is indeed a hidden gem located in the alleys of Sudder street close to new market area..This place is no-frills attached and is mainly hailed for the lip-smacking food it serves and that too as the minimum possible prices..One of the least publicized food joints not known to many,still this place cooks up some of the finest pocket friendly continental foods in the city..Nothing to talk about its ambiance,only pros is the a.c. else it is mostly crowded and noisy and even you might need to share a table with other diners..You will definitely find a lot of foreign bag-packers and travellers and might enjoy conversing with them..COming to the food they actually offers a Huge array of items ranging from European to Oriental to Indian..However I would suggest to avoid the Indian fares here and concentrate more on their Continental dishes..Last time I visit with a friend of mine and ordered:
Choco Banana Milk Shake: Nice,refreshing,somewhat strange combo but liked the taste..
Chicken Pepper Steak: One of their more popular dishes..two big chicken fillets done well in a rich pepper based sauce..Highly Recommended..
Fish Pepper Salt: Fresh basa fish used,generous portions..it was spicy and tangy..loved the pungent flavour of pepper..
Chicken Cardinal Pizza: A thin crust pizza with toppings of chicken,capsicum and onion..regular medium one was enough for twin sharing..
Caramel Pudding: Well as most of the deserts were unavailable,we opetd for this,and it was a huge dissappointment..tasted least like a pudding..lacked consistency,lacked balance of sweetness,more of a freezed caramel..
Overall our pocket pinch was approx Rs.750/- for all these foods as they dont charge extra vat..so definitely value for money and if you intend to try some authentic Continental breakfast give this place a try..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 5/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 2.5/5

It's a nice place with a wide variety of cuisines under one roof. I love their pancakes and cheese omlettes. People crave for the chocolate pudding on flame which I just don't like at all. It's fine to visit this place if you come to sudder street for some cheap shopping from Sunshine.

My review : 4.5/5.0

I had visited this place quite recently, during my latest visit to kolkata, during April.
I had not much heard about this place honestly, as it is located at a place like new Market Area, which is flooded with good shops. It was a weekday, me n my friend were randomly roaming in and around New Market, looking for a place to have Lunch, as it was already 4pm and half of the places we went, refused us.
Suddenly this place caught our attention.. It seemed a very normal place and we didn't quite expect good food, honestly. But food was really really good and affordable. We had ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Hunan Chicken and food was yummy. They also served burgers and continental food. I can say, this place is one of the most underrated places to eat, in new market area and is a good choice if u need cheap and good food .

Despite being a frequent visitor of the Park Street area all my college life, discovered BSC only recently. Very underrated. Always bustling with tourists, this place might appear a bit cramped for space initially, but the food is worth every bit of it. The burgers are fantastic. A very much continental menu on offer- you could try out new things. A nice place for going out with friends. An after college snack or maybe a quick bite after a tiring shopping session with the girlfriend, this place is perfect for that. The fact that it goes easy on the pocket as well adds so much to its appeal. 
To sum it up, I'd say this place is a must for every Calcuttan looking for a quick bite (and not necessarily an ambiance).

This is one of the most underraated restaurants in the city which has not been highlighted at all. Located in the heart of the city in close proximity to New Market this outlet has existed over years now. It is actually a favourite hangout for the foreigners who frequent it for continental and European meals. There is also chinese and thai dishes in the menu which are equally authentic and tasty. The services start from breakfast and continues till dinner. There is always a hustle bustle in the restaurant as there's hardly any seat which you would find empty. The ambience is very ordinary with a retro feel to it. Looks like the waiters have been working here forever and they are well accustomed with the menu and services are prompt. We ordered for thai dishes like the keang chicken in red curry and the thai rice. It was yummy and I can claim that it was one of the best thai foid I tasted in the city. If you are a foodie this is a must visit place for sure. Do not miss it for anything.

This little restaurant always held my fantasy. Small place, no frills, good food and really an international crowd (there were times when I was the only Indian customer there).

Sitting places are pretty basic but clean. Waiters are courteous, give honest suggestions and don't linger around you irritatingly.

The food. I simply love the Salt and Pepper Mushroom they serve. It's a basic but a wonderful dish and a must have. Hakka noodles is also quite good. They have a huge variety of dishes and the best part is, I've never come across a messed up dish here. Spaghetti Bologna has a bit of excess tomato puree and the Chocolate Pudding in Flame is just average. But the overall quality of food is good here. Service time is also decent and acceptable.

This is a no frills place and quite easy on the pocket. Ideal for a quick lunch or snacks when one isn't quite in a mood for a fancy restaurant. I keep going back for it for the food and the simple ambience there.

One of the better placed I've been to in Kolkata. The menu is great, with a lot of variety. We ordered Paneer butter masala and yellow dal along with cheese garlic naan, roti and mango milkshake. Paneer butter masala and yellow daal were very tasty and the garlic cheese naan was just awesome! Roti could've been a bit better. The mango milkshake was thick, just a little less sweet. Overall, a very good eating experience!

Truly a hidden gem, needs good publicity! Droolworthy, scrumptious, pocket friendly food. The mango shake & double chicken lasagne is a must! Love munching the Chicken sausage with chilly cheese dip & red pepper chicken as well! The pancakes are heavenly so are the pizzas & pastas! Didn't try the Indian cuisine yet, but I'm sure it'll be as good as the Chinese & Continental ones! The only suggestion is to renovate the cafe with bright lights & comfortable seating arrangement.

The interiors are awful, so was the food. We ordered Chinese and Thai dishes, turned out to be overpriced a bit going by the quantity and quality they served. The chicken in chilli chicken had gone kinda hard and chewy and stale, and the schezwan chicken did not taste any different from the other dishes. The tofu tasted quite satisfactory, though the rice and noodles were kind of bland.

One can easily locate the place. Suddar street or rather sahebi para. A very old place serving variety at a reasonable price. If food is always there on your mind then try this place out. Varied kind of dishes available. The place is shabby but don't go by the looks. If you are planning for a treat and too many people with several opinion, then you have the right place here. Enjoy eating!

My personal favourite!! Went for the first time with my friends, some two years back and ever since I frequent this place. Sudder street to me is defined by this cafe. You might not be enamoured by the ambience, but you will never have enough of the food they serve. The gesture of the people working here is very good and better are the burgers! Texas chicken burger is one thing I never miss to order. Pasta and macaroni can not be missed either! Have had burgers in many places so far but blue sky cafe serves the best in the city according to me. Apart from continental, they serve Indian specialities as well and I must say they are yummy too!
So practically if you are somewhere near sudder street, don't miss out on this yummy and pocket friendly food junction :)

It took me hell of a lot of effort to find this place but worth it.
The interiors are not at all impressive, barely has sitting accommodations and an a.c. and a t.v. You would never guess that they serve such amazing food if you judge the place by what it looks like.
It takes them a bit of time to serve you the food but the serving boys there, are otherwise very courteous.
We had baked fish and all meat salad. The baked fish was just mouth watering. I was extremely hungry and when I put the food in my mouth I was almost teary. I could not finish it by myself so I would advice to check before ordering. One plate could be sufficient for two.
The salad was okay.
Overall a pretty amazing experience and I do hope to come back again.

Blue Sky Cafe is synonymous with my college days and breakfast after partying out the entire night. I have been going to this place for years now and i can never get bored of this place. The Chicken sunrise burger still happens to be one of my favourite burgers. The chicken cordon bleu is pretty good too. This place is also quite reasonable.
Blue sky is a favourite haunt for a lot of foreigners and the place is always buzzing and alive! The staff are quite friendly though a little slow.

Located at just five minutes walking distance from New Market this little cafe serves freshly made burgers and other fast food.

After a certain episode of retail therapy I felt like I could with some food therapy as well so I walked into this place that one of my friends had recommended. The place was small and most of the seats were already occupied but I found one spare corner and claimed it as mine. I ordered Chocolate banana milk shake and Chicken sunrise burger.

The milkshake arrived within five minutes. It was cool and thick and tasted mostly of bananas with only a slight flavour of chocolate. The burger arrived after a good fifteen minutes. It was served with potato chips on the side and was fresh and juicy with the meat patty cooked to perfection. Honestly speaking that was the best burger I ever had.

The seating was a bit tight, the staff was a bit loud but the food was fresh and reasonably priced. If you love burgers then you can't miss this place. If you don't love burgers still visit and you might start loving them.

With the blistering heat that has lain a pall over Kolkata, one huge bonus of Blue Sky Cafe is the air conditioning. It is located towards the New Market end of Sudder street and is a little difficult to find if you're going there for the first time. However, the journey is totally worth the sweat and toil.
We arrived there all hot and sweaty, and ordered mango and watermelon juices. The mango juice as thick and freshly made. The cafe is famous for burgers. The cordon Blue burger that we had was very tasty as was the mixed meat salad. Those two are absolute must haves. However, I wouldn't suggest the chicken in rosemary sauce. I found that it had a weird smell. The chocolate pudding on fire was a dessert that was highly recommended, but it failed to live up to my expectations. Although it really was on fire, it was actually nothing more than hot chocolate with a dash of wine. Not very fulfilling.
Like a typical cafe, you can sit their for as long as you want, people mind their own business and don't bother you. However, if time is a constraint, I wouldn't recommend this food haunt as they take time to serve. The waiters are courteous and all together it was an A+ experience with healthy and delicious food at a cheap price! Added bonus is the menu card shows prices inclusive of tax.

This is one of the many places in new market area where shop-aholics like me drop by after a tiresome shopping time to revitalize and rejuvenate themselves. We were around the hog market area when we encountered this place. From outside the place seemed quite small but after entering we saw that they have quite adequate space to accommodate at least 40-50 people at a time. The air conditioner was a bonus in this awfully uncomfortable weather.
The tables were placed irregularly though they had managed decent seating conditions. The walls were painted in blue and white stripes which was probably done to implement the idea of the sky...blue for the actual color and white for the clouds.
2-3 people were taking the orders who seemed to lack coordination between themselves.
We went through the menu card and decided to avoid heavy filling foods. So we ordered 1 chicken sunrise burger and 1 chicken keema cheese grilled sandwich along with 2 bottles of thums up to quench our thirst.
While waiting for our order to arrive we noticed that the place seemed really popular in the area. People were coming and leaving quite fast and they were running good on their business.

Our food took some 10 minutes to arrive. Both the items were well prepared and was served with crisp chips. The sandwich was well grilled and was loaded with mashed chicken. It was to an extent perfect.
Now..coming to the burger. It was also served along with chips. First of all,this is the first place where i saw burger being sliced into two parts. Secondly,no place in the world serves burger along with shredded veggies inside. The patty is always served along with whole slices of onion,lettuce and etc. Here they were served along with shredded onions and cabbage leaves and cucumbers that too bitter ones. This was a big let down.
Last but not least,since ingredients of burgers are arranged in layers,a toothpick is always stuck up on the bun to make sure that the insides doesn't come out and remain arranged in layers. But here,no such initiative was taken and the insides were all coming out even before we could take a bite of the burger. These points really did disappoint me to some extent but the taste of both the items were fabulous and keeping aside their small flaws,both the items are truly recommended.
The place is definitely in craze and some simple things as mentioned,if recovered,would earn more good will to this place. I did not notice anything blue sky-ish here except the wall color but the place is definitely sky rocketing in terms of its fame..!:-)

This is one place that i would love to go to again and again...although the ambience is nothing fancy...the tables are cramped up together but if you are a person who believes in the quality of the food and not fancy decor then this is your place...
We were looking for a place to land after our share of shopping at esplanade...
We dropped in at around 5.30...
I wanted to try continental so we ordered fish n chips, grilled chicken in rosemary sauce and masala lemon soda...
The food took a long time to come but when it arrived it was worth the wait...the fish was cooked to perfection and so were the fries..the dip tasted good...the chicken was good too...the butter rice was nice...although the chicken felt a little rubbery n trying to tear it with a knife seemed a little tedious...but otherwise the food tasted awesome...
Worth trying again...and next time i would like to try some of their chinese n indian dishes too

They have very basic and no nonsense arrangement. A lot of tourist clienteles frequent here, so their menu is pretty expansive covering Indian, Italian and the city's favourite.....Chinese. 
 I have been here a couple of times before. The food isn't bad but its not brilliant either. This time around we had the pizza and bolognese. The sauce in the bolognese was rich and abundant, they put a lot of cheese in it too. The pizza was nice and the topping were a lot too, the only thing was that as the pizza got cold....the base became rubbery and chewy. 
 The only meat available here is chicken, in all varieties (sausage, ham, salami, mince, etc). That I find a bit boring and redundant.

Location is good. Good food, Free WiFi! Reasonably priced cafe. But don't expect ambience. 

But food is tasty and will attract you to visit again. Most importantly, aside from pizza, pasta and continental dishes you can have tandoori, and Chinese dishes. 

Ultimate cafe.

With so much of hullabaloo around, many may not like the busy ambiance, but the quality and quantity of food here is beyond the reach of any posh cafe in the city. The pizzas here are an absolute delight to have. My friend and I ordered the large Chikki Delight and it was a cheese and chicken lover's paradise and scores well above the pizzas of popular eateries. The service is more or less prompt and there's great variety of dishes in the menu. Yet to try the much recommended farmhouse steak... looking forward to our next visit.

Places like Blue Sky Café are a must for those who really admire food and the preparations. I mean, many wouldn't have entered into this place thinking of it as just an other joint. But that's a complete wrong perception cause BSC is one of the best in the area in terms of food quality and the service. The ambiance seemes quite decent to me and the guys working here are very friendly and prompt with the service and the food is delicious.

A foodie's business is having food without being bothered or bothering anyone around so the concept of tables being placed in a close firmation didn't effect me.

You won't feel a pinch paying for your order as it's very reasonabke.

This one's been a long time coming. I've lost count of the number of times this place has failed to disappoint me. I've been here for breakfast, snacks and Sunday brunch and it's always been a tremendously satisfying experience. The farmhouse steak is out of the world on it's best days.

Blue Sky Café is one of those places which have everything on their Menu. They serve breakfast, burgers, fresh juices, shakes, pizzas, pastas, Chinese, Continental and what not! I have tried very few items on their menu and have realised that at their prices you can't really complain. 
I have tried their Burgers, The Jumbo Burger, the Texas Burger, the Grill Chicken Burger, the Cordon Bleu Burger. Most brugers are really nice to taste, comes with slaugh and fries. I would suggest not to consume the Slaugh as it mostly tastes fishy. The Fries and the Burger is really good to taste. 
I have tried their sandwiches which are really nice to taste. And their fresh fruit juices are tasty as well as healthy. However I am not a fan of their continental dishes. I have also tried their Pancakes which are usually thin and not fluffy but their honey and lemon syrup is really nice to taste. 
Blue Sky Café is really good for their Burgers and is very pocket friendly indeed. Do visit.

Want a feel of the local bangkok street? You must visit Blue sky cafe situated at sudder street..this narrow lane is adjacent to new market and you will spot foreigners all the time here..
Blue sky cafe is a 50-60 people food joint but dont go by the size of the eatery..the food gives you a "finger licking good" feel..Although they serve all cuisines, their english breakfast is one of the best! Try their cheese omlettes, garlic toasts, bacon and sausages. For lunch I had Au gratin (very cheesy) and also chicken steak in sesame sauce ( still lingers my taste buds). 
Reasonably priced and best part is its wifi enabled! You can keep gorging on to good food while you surf the net..
My suggestion- You can give Flurrys a miss one sunday and try Blue sky cafe once!

Once upon a time I had read about this central Calcutta joint in a TOI article and since then had this on my wishlist and when I finally entered the cafe it seemed I had barged into a different world.... Seemed like I had used Harry Potter's port key and landed somewhere in Europe. Its swarmed with foreigners with only 1 or 2 desi guests. And I failed to understand how we could ignore such a jewel at the heart of the city which even outsiders relish. They serve mainly continental dishes and every dish was remarkably beautiful and I say this after having tasted all these in Europe itself. 
A special mention will be undoubtedly"Chocolate pudding on Flame".... !!!

To be frank, I think this place is a tiny bit overhyped. Went there yesterday and tried their chicken cheese omelette, honey banana pancake and iced coffee - was nothing spectacular. Their chocolate pudding with flame which people talk about was a real let down - my advice is don't order it, it just looks good. The waiters were nice and polite though and it is quite light on the pocket.

I realize that there might be better items to try on the menu and I will reassess my review if I visit the place later and get better stuff to eat. But for now, my opinion on the place is lukewarm.

I was introduced to this food joint by some friends who had said that this place serves the best pizzas and pastas in town at really low cost. Well, after frequenting this place many times in the past few months, I can say they did not make it up.
I am yet to try the pastas, but the pizzas here are an absolute delight. I have tried the Chicken Makhani (Cheese Burst) and the Canadian Ham (Cheese Burst), both of which cost way less than any pizza parlour and was taste wise far, far superior.
My favourite is, however, the Chicken Pepper Steak, which is basically a huge chunk of steak covered in lip smackingly delicious gravy with a side of hand cut french fries. Instead of a side of veggies, they are mixed with the gravy, making them all the more yummy.
A few days back, I had also tried their Grilled Chicken Burger which was served with a side of french fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw was pretty plain, but the burger itself was really good. It had a pretty big portion of chicken, with a slice of cheese, lettuce and some other stuff I don't remember.
The only disappointments for me have been the Tom Yam Soup and the Chocolate Pudding on Flame. I had heard so much about this on Zomato before coming here. But I have to say, it was one of the worst desserts I have ever tried. It's really fascinating to look at but after the flame goes out, all that's left is a very bland semi-solid topped with a layer of rum that tastes something like chocolate. I don't know if I just had a bad day but I'm not ordering this again.
The ambiance and serving is nothing special. It is always half filled with a number of foreigners, for some reason. Sometimes they serve you super fast, sometimes they take a little time. But if you're one of those people who do not care about ambiance and simply go in for good food and value for money, please do visit this place. It will not disappoint you.
P.S - No pictures of the pizzas, sorry. We were just too busy devouring them to remember clicking pictures.

Update- Visited the two more times and it left me with mixed reactions. The first time I ordered a Farmhouse Steak, and my friend ordered a Mushroom and Cheese Omelette and a Grilled Chicken Burger. To accompany them we ordered a Chocolate Shake and a Mango Shake. The taste of the steak was, well, weird. It was served with a side of boiled veggies, gravy and penne pasta. The pasta was cooked al dente, which I personally disliked. The gravy was very, very bland. Infact, the only saving grace of the dish was the veggies. Now, it was later that I figured they probably cook to suit the palate of the foreigners who frequent this place. So, if you like your food spicy, then it's better to tell them beforehand. The omelette was overloaded with mushrooms and cheese and was simply delicious. The shakes are decent but a little bit on the sweeter side. The last time I visited I ordered a Chicken Sunrise Burger and my friend ordered a Mushroom and Cheese Grilled Sandwich. Both were served with a side of potato chips. The burger had lettuce, slices of cucumber, tomato, a slice of cheese, a little bit of coleslaw with cabbages and carrots and a fried chicken patty. Quite good though the coleslaw was yet again, a downer. The sandwich was, however, absolutely brilliant. :D

I recently found out this place and fell in love at first bite. Located at a stone's throw away from fairlawns, its a place frequented by foreign nationals. Infact in my first visit, my friends and i were the only indians. Nothing much to say about decor or ambience. Very much like a normal restaurant. The staffs are very friendly, eager to make suggestions, always wearing a big smile on them. The food now-it is so so cheap. Never expected such a wonderful steak at just 200rs. The chicken pepper steak is good, so is the farmhouse steak. The chicken pepper steak comes with fries and vegetables soaked in a curry. The farmhouse steak has chicken cut into chunks, sauteed veggies, sauteed penne pasta and a curry. The chicken ala king is yummy. Its chicken, bell peppers and onion in white sauce. The garlic bread has a fat layer of the garlic topping. But their indo-chinese section is okay. The noodles are fine. We ordered chicken 65 which tasted like achari chicken. Their pancakes are a disaster. It doesnt look like a pancake at all. Thanks to the good Lord, we ordered with nutella. That saved the pancakes literally. Im a big fan of their continental. Recommended, with friends, ofcourse! Cheerie!

Huge menu for a small place. Was packed with foreigners the time I went visiting. Apparently it's a favourite among volunteers who come from different countries to kolkata. Anyways, the place is small and can maybe hold 20-30 people At a go making it a little stuffed. The food has been slightly dulled to better suit the foreign taste palates. The service is quick. Can give it a try If you want to strike up a conversation with strangers and don't mind the stuffy feeling.

The only thing that you will ask when you go to Blue Sky is, why haven’t I come here before; or if you have come here before, then, why don’t I come here more often. Or at least, so I think you should. 

Easily accessible, as-affordable-as-it-gets and abundantly satisfying, Blue Sky is refreshingly different. The interiors are shabby and the table settings are cramped for want of space nevertheless the food is scrumptious. My friends and I, with the kind help of the waiter, settled on the following:

(1) Jumbo Burger: Served with a handful of potato chips, the burger bun contains a thick, juicy chicken patty, topped with an egg sunny side up and a cheese slice with the usual vegetables. This one decidedly took the longest time to finish.

(2) Cordon Bleu Burger: Mayo oozed out of the burger buns and surprisingly there were chunks of sausages inside the chicken patty. No egg. Same dose of potato chips. A slice of cheese.

(3) Texas Chicken Burger: Jalapenos. Olives. Crispy fried chicken patty. A slice of cheese. The bun is served with a side of large French fries and a dollop of an incredible coleslaw salad. No egg.

(4) Chicken Pepper Steak: Served with a side of large French fries, the steak was a last-minute choice and it was a good one! The flavoursome gravy was laden with hot spices and vegetables while the chicken in it was lip-smacking. This isn’t the conventional steak and it was delicious!

The above four and a Sweet Lime Soda cost us a meagre Rs. 495, assuredly the most reasonably priced meal. Service was swift, the place was moderately crowded and our stomachs were full. There is hardly any place in the city that serves good burgers, that too, at such an unbelievable rate!

I don’t think I care enough about the interiors to deduct any points, even half.

The place is not really on the interiors of Sudder Street as some of my friends had earlier told me. Its at the corner of the second crossroad one meets while walking on Sudder Street from J.N.Road. However this Cafe, which does serve great food, is too shabby and one might feel a bit suffocated. I went at around 2.45 p.m. when it was filled with too many people, foreigners mostly, that it was a bit difficult for me and my friend to get just two seats. We noticed that the restaurant had just two waiters (yes, the place is that tiny!) to serve everyone.

Anyhow, we  had decided to gorge on Continental food and therefore our first order was Chicken Pepper Steak. It took around 20 minutes for the dish to arrive even though it was lunchtime! The steak was tender and yummy! It was neither too hot, nor cold. It was just comfortably warm and delightful. The vegetables and the fries received on the plate were tender. It was worth the wait, we agreed!

Next, we had Grilled Chicken with Rosemary Sauce, a dish that has brought fame to this tiny little cafe. I exactly can't describe the taste in words. It had a funny taste- it was a bit sweet, and tangy at the same time. Balancing the taste with the vegetables, the buttery rice and the soft grilled chicken pieces, we continued eating in glee. 

I know it's usually not a dessert, but lastly 
we tried out a plate of fried chicken momos. They were soft indeed and lightly fried, and tasted like any other momos in and around Kolkata. Nothing great. 

Overall, I had good continental food at  a reasonable price. Shall come back again for some other cuisine and the well-known 'chocolate pudding in flame'!

The thing about Blue Sky Cafe is that you need to know what to order and what to avoid. At first glance, everything seems good. However once you've been here around 4 to 5 times, you'll have developed an understanding.

Chinese cuisine is pretty much the same everywhere and Blue Sky is no exception, however the must-have here is the Sunrise Burger with a side of fries. Easily one of the best burgers I've ever had! Try to avoid the continental dishes, they're edible, but you can get better elsewhere. If you're looking for value-for-money, Blue Sky is right up there along side Bar-B-Q in terms of amount paid for amount received.

It's a to-the-point cafe, don't expect a very warm and hospitable staff. They're just there to take your order and serve it to you. Still one of the better experiences, and I'd highly recommend Blue Sky Cafe, even with Park Street right around the corner.
Update (3/9/15): Still amazing! Can't get enough! I keep forgetting to snap a photo of their continental dishes though. Avoid the flaming chocolate desserts - too much rum.
Update(14/8/16): Still brilliant! Prices have gone up a bit though.

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

To be honest,this place is a little to overhyped.Been hearing of it from friends and colleagues alike.However,the Kentucky burger ,the cheese grilled sandwich and the apple juice were nothing spectacular.The price seems reasonable and the ambience is very ordinary.Its frequently haunted by foreign nationals.
Good for a breakfast,just good nothing more.
Sort of recommended for a low on the budget breakfast.

This place is really good and cosy. There are no segregated seating potion you sit where you get a place preferably close to your friends on a single table. The service is adequately fast but what takes the cake is the sheer variety of items and yet somehow the quaint management of the items to prevent them from going over the patrons heads. From steaks to club sandwiches to chapatis everything is available and in stock to be served, mostly due to the foreign clientele this place caters to. You might walk in to see 80% of the place filled with foreign nationals. Parking you car might be a problem as it is the new market area but I managed to park it right in front of the cafe gate and the staff were OK with it. The food is tasty and nothing spectacular. It's a place to grab a quick bite. The prices are pretty reasonable and the all time availability of all food items are a big plus along with this mind boggling assortment of milk shakes and juices. It's one of those "must eat at" places in Kolkata, albeit more for the reputation of this long standing establishment rather than, say, the outstanding quality of food

A great place for a decent bite at a cheap proce but not much else. I don't know why this place is rated so highly. The food quality is average. There is zero decor. It is a backpacker haven, and open long hours, but those aren't particularly relevant for those not living nearby.
 I will say that the lassis are good and must be made in a more sanitary way than the ones on the street.

I came across this on Zomato a couple of days back, and after going through the menu, I knew that I had to visit this place sometime soon.And luckily, I was able to pay Blue Sky a visit the very next day.
Located on Sudder Street, this one is hard to miss. 
Although it looks quite shabby from outside, and doesn't have a great ambiance, it does serve some good quality stuff at very decent prices.
We ordered Cheese Toast, Chicken Pepper Steak, Grilled Chicken with Rosemary Sauce, and Chocolate Pudding on Flame. 
The Cheese Toast was recommended by the waiter to go along the Steak, and we agreed. The toast was served with potato chips. The toast was nice, although I believe, for the price, the portion was not upto the mark. The chips too were unsalted.
Although the evening started on not a very great tone, what followed was good.
The chicken pepper stake was pretty good. Served with handcut french fries, and cooked with some veggies in a pepper sauce, it was a nice break from the regular chicken dishes.
I personally liked the grilled chicken in rosemary sauce better than the steak. Served with a portion of veggies, buttered rice flavoured with rosemary (not sure about the herb, though) and rosemary sauce, it was an absolute delight.
We had ordered Chocolate Pudding on Flame for our desert. The portion is extremely good when compared to the price. And the pudding is on flame, literally. Unlike other pudding that I have had, this one was heavy. And we had made the mistake of ordering one each for us. So, although the pudding was not too sweet, it took us some time to finish. One pudding for two should be just fine. The entire meal cost us a decent Rs 570.

Though i have been to esplanade like a thousand times but never heard of it. One of my closest one suggested about to visit the place. Eventually we did and really liked this place. Its a very good place to hang around. The food is really good. Chicken steak is the most famous dish at there. And for the fish lover the grilled fish with lemon sauce is mouth watering. The first day we ordered one chicken steak one plate chilli cheese toast one burger one grilled fish. The most interesting part of this restaurant is that the variety it covers. Well you visit there then i can tell that it has the ability to please anybody. I am planning to visit there very soon. I suggest you that don't be late..

went with two friends. Ordered Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce, French Onion Soup, Cheese Balls, and Baked Spinach and Corn. The grilled fish was a bit too dry for our taste, and the lemon butter sauce was not adequate in amount. The onion soup greatly disappointed and was a poor imitation of the original.  The cheese balls, however, were awesomely cheesy. The star of the day was the spinach and golden corn, which was baked to perfection (the stuff here are not heavy handed with the flour in the bechamel sauce, to my eternal gratefulness). All in all, a rather nice (and perhaps only) place to visit if you are in New Market, and are in mood for continental at pocket-friendly prices. Don't order the juices if you don't want to be ripped off, though. 120 bucks per glass is a bit exorbitant, I think.
cons: no bathroom, no AC.
pro: free wi-fi.

I found out about this place from Zomato. Reaching here is seriously a hustle for the first time. It is not at all well decorated. Normal sitting arrangements with basic furniture.
Menu is quite promising. We ordered veg rice noodle soup, it was served piping hot and taste was simple yet tasty. Noodles were well balanced.  two tandoori rotis, egg masala, cheese malai kofta, grilled chicken with rosemary sauce and flamed chocolate pudding.
Chicken was not grilled and sauce was bland. It was served with rice and it was well cooked and tasty. Egg masala and best dish was cheese malai kofta. Though chocolate pudding was the show stopper literally lip smacking. Presentation was also amazing specially the flame work.
Quality and quantity were pretty apt and also pocket friendly. Would recommend for sure.

After hours of shopping,I and my friends were super hungry and wanted to gorge ourselves on food as soon as possible but left with little money. We searched this joint out via zomato and reached. It is a very ordinary décor with good air conditioned seats. We ordered chicken pepper steak,grilled chicken with rosemary sauce as main course and chocolate pudding with flame as dessert. Main course was good but this dessert is just awesome. I have never tasted this thing before. The unique idea of chocolate pudding served with lighted wine which gives the flame is just great. It is highly recommended.

On my occasional visits to sunshine, Spanish café, fairlawns I had noticed this joint. But somehow I did not feel the urge to go in as I found the place too shabby. After reading the reviews on zomato and ofcourse our money crunch being an issue, after a shopping spree at esplanade, we decided to ditch Spanish café and head towards the blue sky café. When we entered, we saw a shabby café with whole lot people chatting and a huge amount of commotion. Nonetheless the three of us added to the commotion. The decor was minimal. The intensity of light was too dim. We were thirsty so went in for a mountain dew and chatted. The staffs are enough courteous to let us chat for a while and then they came in for the order. Continental being on my mind for a few days, we turned to the page where conti food lay. Wanted to do chicken schinitzel, but the waiter said it was just fried chicken. I appreciated there honesty and willingness to help. They could have easily taken the order but they wanted to enquire what we would like so they suggested us the chicken pepper steak and we did that. And he also suggested grilled chicken with rosemary sauce. We definitely stuck to it. The order came within 5 minutes. The pepper steak was heaven. The succulent chicken with smoky affair was out of world I wish I could get more of it. So was the grilled chicken . The buttery rice and the sauté chicken with sauce wid boiled chicken...exotic! The waiter asked us to try the spaghetti bolognese and the spaghetti nepolitana, I would definitely go back for it. Then we were dropping the idea of having our dinner when our eyes struck the chocolate pudding with flame and three of us decided on it. When the order was placed on our table, all eyes were set to our table. The pudding was actually on flame. Wine was poured over the pudding and a sensation burning deep down the throat which tasted amazing. By far the second best dessert that I have tasted in kolkata. Loved it. And its pretty pocket friendly as well. I would revisit it innumerable amount of times.

My second visit and I feel so good. The same old goodness of rich taste and the same old willingness to help made me feel so much at home. This time we went in directly for the continental main course. Yes it was the amazing grilled fish with lemon butter sauce. It is highly recommended a dish. A must try. The softness of fish and the amazing sauce. and of course we had the chicken ala king with cheese chilli garlic toast. The ala king was too bland. But the chill garlic toast amazing. The fruit custard was amazing in taste.
Another visit to the blue sky café will occur shortly as I am addicted. 

The last day I visited all I wanted was the burgers available as I oggled at the amazing looking burger at the next table the last time. And texas chicken burger sounded amazing. And sandwich to follow it. rhe club sandwich was the call. However I have had better sandwiches before. But the burger was amazing as never. A slight minty taste , whole lot of crunchy meat and amazing mayo and sauce to wrap up. The  next time, the burger calls again.

blue sky cafe... so lets start.... the cheapest and the best.... i was shocked to find that there were hardly any items that crosses rs 100... gawd... i bit too shabby and noisy i.e. may be because of the foreign customers that come. I had chicken keema grilled sandwich, jumbo burger, burning chocolate and they were just too good at the price. 

A worth visiting place if you are hungry......

There are a few pics more other than the reviewed foods because those were taken in lot of other visits..

For all people like me who love their burgers,Blue Sky Cafe is a must try.This is even more so because they offer something a little different from the usual MacD and Kfc of which we are so very used to.
I have been to this place mainly for their burgers.The Texas Burger and the Chciken cordon Bleu burgers are the ones I have particularly liked.They are made the right way.The bun is soft and fresh.The patty is thick and meaty.There is the perfect amount of cheese and lettuce to go with the burger.Finally it is served with french fries or potato chips.The overall size of the burger is appreciable and arguably better than the MacD and Kfc ones.And all this at much lesser prices.
The place also offers Indian,Chinese,continental,Italian and some classic breakfast items.I have had their Chinese and have found it to be though not great but okay.I am yet to try their other offerings.But having heard that they are all pretty decent and also considering the very very reasonable prices I intend to do so soon!
Located in Sudder street the place is smaller than you would expect but certainly not so in terms of popularity.It is frequented by foreigners visiting the locality.The service is quite swift.The place also offers free WiFi during breakfast hours and also for some time during the afternoon if you are interested.

For foodies in Kolkata, to be unaware of this pint sized dynamite, is sure blasphemy! it holds true to the saying- good things come in small packages! since it is located quite close to my office near Park street, I keep visiting this places and always love the food they put out. They serve a mixed bag of Indian, Chinese, Continental, Italian and Mughlai cuisine- but I love their Conti and Italian affairs. Simply mind blowing and delicious. The  toasts are delicious, the soups- appetizing. Try out the pastas if you visit and the other Italian dishes like Pizza. The momo is tasty too. The Spaghetti Nepolitana is a tasty and filling dish, as well as Spaghetti Bolognese. I love the Chicken Pepper Steak too. Try out some of the salads- the Mexican, Penne Grilled chicken and Coleslaw salads are my favorites.

Feel like having burger at 6:30 in the morning??... Or pancakes at 9:00 pm in the night??..And dont  feel like spending too much...What to do??..Blue sky cafe is the answer..This little cafe in Sudder Street offers good food in a pocket friendly way..The pancakes and the chocolate flame pudding are the two things that draw me back to this place again and again..

The staff is very friendly..But they take a hell lot of time for serving the orders..The only drawback in find in this otherwise great joint...

Located on Sudder Street, this little eating joint definitely has more up its sleeves, than it lets on. 
We happened to visit this place by a way of chance because we were tired, hungry and hot. What we didn't expect to find was a wonderful eclectic atmosphere inside, definitely not because of decor or such but rather the people frequenting the place. 
An absolutely informal place, where you can hang around and savour and indulge in the various options available from their extensive menu. 
Since we were hungry we had decided on Thai and some Chinese. For the price we paid, the food was definitely a pleasant surprise. 
Though the service is a bit casual bit then again, in some strange way it adds to the charm of the place, the laid-back attitude definitely helps you to relax. 
For dessert we had the Banana Fitters With Ice Cream. Very nice. 

I cannot wait to visit the place soon. 
You should too.

I am partial about Blue Sky Cafe. It reminds me of lazy afternoons when we shared a plate of pasta after our shopping at New Market. For students, it continues to be one of the pocket friendly places. Barring the flies, and the bustle of the street, I made a quick stopover after all these years and settled for their chocolate pudding in flames. I have tasted this dish in all seasons and they have maintained the same taste ever since my bonding with this place. My other favourite picks are their pancakes, and sandwiches. A place etched in my memory for some wonderful time, pocket friendly food and most importantly the star dish that has never betrayed my taste buds. Try to make a stopover here for the chocolate pudding.... its worth it!

Had always heard about this place from the college kids..at Kolkata. Finally had the chance of visiting yesterday during the evening. Well frankly I wasn't impressed. Its not the decor or the houseflies or seating arrangement that ticked me off actually.. It looks like the erstwhile German bakery in Pune..rather the latter was dingier. This place  obviously serves  to  the phoren clientele.. Thus the very competitive prices. The food's not that great really..the burger was passably good. The cold coffee..nothing great. The pizza was lighter on the pocket than a regular Dominos but failed to impressive on taste. The omelette was probably the only good thing about the place.. As good as Vahumas cafe..Pune (if you have been there you d know what I am speaking of) All in all .. It was a very okay experience.

Went there again..!

Had chicken princes and barcetta pizza.. Both were good..

chicken princes  -  chicken breast in white sauce (sauce was creamy ! lovely ! ) with mashed potatoes ( topped with lettuce leaves ) n boiled veggies..! 4/5

Barcetta pizza : good..! 3/5

Service was faster than the previous time , I visited.. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We went there for a weekend lunch. Location was a bit tricky.

Ambience : House flies were flying around. As they served mineral water it can be considered that health issue is important for them. But then how can U guys allow such type of dirtiness ?! That was annoying a bit.

Food: Chicken pepper steak (more chinese less continental. batter fried chicken in finger-licking sauce and veggies with fries. so good. 4.5/5 )
                 
    Chicken schinitzel (more like chicken cutlet . served with fries. nice ! 3.5/5 )

      Barcetta pizza ( delectable ! juicy , cheesy , a bit tomatoey . 4/5 )

Service: First we ordered steak and schinitzel. It took almost 27 mins to come. But the pizza came faster ;) .It took around 17 mins. People were polite and informative there.

It was a bit cheaper. Quantity was not much though. For these three items, our bill was 515 ( 170 + 165 + 200 ). 
They had tax  included  pricein the menu.
Finally, delicious food made us happy. Certainly, we are going back to check out your other items.

P.S : actual price = zomato price + 30 for each item.

Before I write my review I have to thank one of my two favourite reviewers, Poorna di for introducing me to this place through her review on Zomato. The place is bang on Sudder Street and is quite easy to locate. We reached there at about 9:00 hours after buying custom made sausages from Baldwin's. Being a pork fanatic, I had verified from Poorna di whether this place serves pork sausages or not and had my utter dismay learned that it does not. Since I visited Baldwin to buy sausages I thought I might as well give it a go.
Four of us entered the cafe at around half past nine. There were quite a few people scattered around the place having thier breakfasts and most of them appeared to be tourists or people visiting Kolkata for some purpose or the other. We ordered a fresh mausambi juice each. We whiled away our time sipping the juice and making small talk. There was just one persont catering to everyone and we took a liking to him. He was a middle aged wiry man who can never stop smiling. He took our orders with a smile, repeated the same with a smile and brought the food to the table with a smile. We made jokes with and he responded with subdued and somewhat concious laughs. The food however, took a while to reach our table.
We had ordered two Spanish omelettes, one Italian omelette and a chicken and cheese omelette, four plain pancakes and a bowl of muesli and fruit curd. All the omelettes were huge and I think they were made with three or four eggs each. Some areas were a bit overcooked but otherwise good. The pancakes were more like crepes in size and shape but tasted pretty nice. Our friend forgot to drizzle our pancakes with honey. On being reminded he lightly slapped his forehead and smiled and said 'Abhi laa raha hoon!' (I'm getting it right away!). Although it was not quite American pancakes with honey but the crepe-y pancakes were good and very filling. The muesli and fruit curd was again very heavy and filling and there was a generous helping of fruits. There was an abundance of mango, watermelon, melon, bananas, raisins and cashews. The muesli lent a very interesting crunchy texture to the gooey curd and soft fruits.
I need my cup of Americano in the morning so I ordered one. He got me black coffee without sugar as I had ordered but to my dismay it was instant coffee. Normally I use a percolator at home and the coffee is of very good quality so that was a bit disappointing. Otherwise I enjoyed eating breakfast here and our server really made our morning. The value for money is about 7-8/10 so this place is definitely worth giving a try.

Visited this place today. Location is bit tricky atleast it was for me being new to the city. Place is good but was little congested. 
However the food tastes good. We ordered chicken tandoori, chicken kassa, chicken butter masala and veg kolapuri for 3 people and the quantity was sufficient. Food was tasty and satisfying. Service too was nice. 
So overall a 4.5

Located just inside the Sudder Street it may take an unfamiliar one some time to find the restaturant but any Kolkatan who goes in that Esplanade area frequently must have came across this restaturant. The outlet was a medium sized one with approx 30 person seating arrangement. The waiter attented us the moment we sat and after serving us with water i asked them whether there is any special items of Blue Sky Cafe. He recommended the Chicken Pepper Steak and we took Sattay Chicken also as a starter. Sattay Chicken was a descent starter with slight crispy chicken pieces cooked in bell pepper and peanut butter sauce. The steak was the usual steaks we find but instead of boiled veggies served on the side it was covered by a veggie mixed thick gravy and the steak was pretty well cooked. But one thing what i found and it may vary from person to person is that i found the salt little less in both the items and i had to sprinkle some.. Overall a descent experience.

P.S. Look out for their Wiiiiiiiiide variety of menus..mindblowing versatality..:P

It awesome ... simply nice . Anytime you go and ask for anything listed in menu and you will never get disappointed . Salads , Italians , Russian , every variant you like you will have it nice place to eat breakfast , fast servicing nice staff . Most important open so early and in night you find door open , Because of this I survived my worst hotel experience . Juices , Sandwich I liked most , and Kolkata is best for fish I loved fish dishes here .

Must go if you ever get to park street .

Blue sky cafe is the best cafe you will find in the city of joy. Centrally located, it serves Continental, Thai, Indian and Chinese cuisine. The cafe is well priced and is worth the money. It mostly attracts foreign tourists and college crowd as the food is great and its not heavy on your pocket. It opens  at 7 AM and serves breakfast. From Porridge, Pancakes, Cornflakes, Muesli, Sandwiches and variety of omeletts.

I once visited this cafe for all the three meals in a day.
 
My favorite meal is the awesome:wow-some burger called Cordon blew. Its the burger to die for. its blew my mind away. One can't have enough of it. Its juicy and the chicken patty is differently flavored. I still dream about this burger. My other favorite is the chicken thai curry with steamed rice. Rice as light as feather and the thai curry is seriously made out of some magical recipe.  I am not a big fan of Fish and chips but they make it very nicely. 

One must try their Marconi, Salads and Soup. They have a good variety of dishes in their menu.  

The ambience is basic and clean. The staff is friendly. After few visits they start to know your preferences. 

Its very affordable and gives you value for your money. 

You've got to visit this cafe for the love of food.

Hmmmm... OK I have a mixed reaction for this place. Whenever I have been to this place I was really very hungry and anything could satisfy me wen I am hungry... So ya I might have liked their sunrise burger and their heavy quantity gravy chicken chowmein..And but I must say the food might not be that great but good enuf to feed hungry soul.
Prompt service also something I liked about this place. Going there u might think deir menu is very continental type... But mind u the chefs are all Indian and not that experienced so what u get is just Indian version of those food.. Also mostly this food hogging place is visited by foreign tourists..

Moreover, when you're out with your friends, Blue Sky Cafe's a great place to visit!

One of the worst ever experience came across me...I have been a diner of this place for quite a long time... as well as even suggested many of my friends.. but today it was just a nightmare... went for a lunch ... ordered a mutton biriyani... the thing which came.. to me.. was no way near what is known as biriyani... it was neither a Polao.. just like a piece of mutton kassa with gravy smeared all over the rice... as well the waiter argued.... then I ordered a simple chicken gravy noodles... which turned into a cantonese chicken noodles with egg white in the gravy (am allergic to egg).. without asking my consent... I just came out paying the bill... and they didnt even ask an apology...so better avoid such joints... who doesnt have respect towards their customers...

The biggest point of Blue Sky Cafe is the fact that it opens up around 6.30 am, and what better than going there early morning for a no-fancy breakfast? The two of us hit the place around 6.25 am and had to wait 10 minutes for the cafe to open up. Once in, we checked the menu cards and ordered fried eggs with toast, Spanish omelette, and mausambi juice.

The mausambi juice came first, and it was icy and refreshing, and so good that I ended up reordering it. The fried eggs were done to perfection - cooked on both sides but the yolks still runny inside - just the way I like it, and were served with two slices of crisp toast. The Spanish omelette, containing a lot of potatoes (in the lines of a frittata) is thin, and with some tomato sauce, pretty good. Service, as always, was super fast, and our meal set us back about 250/-, which the two of us were pretty happy paying.

And oh, did I mention free Wi-Fi when you ask for it?
Another day, we checked out the mushroom and cheese omelette, and then followed up with the jalapeno cheese grilled sandwich, which was pretty much exactly what it claimed to be, but came with a side of chips, which was great for me. We also decided to go for the Indian fare, and ordered the chicken butter masala, which was mediocre, with the garlic naan, and the naan was pretty good. However, the roti I ordered later was pretty weird. We ended with the  cold coffee with ice cream, which was extremely creamy and tasty. This meal cost us under 500/- so life was pretty much fine.

We were going through a phase of 'try-a-new-every-week' and came across this restaurant while shopping in Sudder Street.The waiters were welcoming enough to make us take a table in a corner and watch the set of foreigners inside the cafe.The Thai curries tasted of coconut oil ,Thai red chicken curry was not at all red,the veggies were rancid.Pasta was equally bland.Though the hand made pizzas were heavenly and their hot chocolate were 'melt-in your-mouth'(a must recommended)

for Ambiance -3/5
Serving Time-15-20 mins
Cost-pocket friendly

P.S-ever welcoming manager and waiters is a plus point.

I've been here twice with 6 friends and mostly found non-Indian people. So, if you are looking to meet and dine with some foreign taste do visit. The servers were slow and some of the food wasn't too good. But overall when you are with friends who concentrates on food.

Visited The Blue Sky Cafe today with my office colleagues for Breakfast and oh boy what a spread !!!!!
It ranged from Continental , Chinese,Thai ,Indian & Italian. We started with Milkshake like Moca & Mango which tasted awesome.Then each one of us ordered a Omelet of different kind, which they served very quickly with that perfect taste. After that Omelet we were pretty full and had to take a break of sorts to make way for the rest :P .The stewards were attentive and very helpful.. Its been a while since I had this kinda perfect breakfast ! If i had more place in the tummy , would try some other dishes as well but maybe next time....
The food is absolutely worth every penny spent and I will surely not think twice before heading here again :)

Food is good. Tha pancakes. Sandwiches. Special mention to the rumble tumble burger (Amazing). Overall good food. Ambience could be better.
Went there with a couple of friends on a fine morning. Service speed was decent. I'm actually willing to overlook any service delays because the food made up for it. Try the shakes. Nutella pancake and rumble tumble burger were the 2 menu items which I really liked. 
I'm planning to visit the place again because I couldn't get the most of it in my first visit.
Good to see lots of foreigners visiting this place, specially breakfast time. :)

I have been here twice. it is a  quaint little place equipped with WiFi and quite 'tourist' friendly. You will look around your table and find quite a few Chinese and Europeans buzzing away in their own languages! They come here mostly because it fits the pocket and in that kind of money the food is the closest reminder of all things foreign. Their burgers are good though a little dry. Quite liked their grill chicken one. They are quite cheap so one cant complain about less fries on the side. I have tasted their Irish coffee which is very much 'Irish'. (The waiter who is a very friendly bloke told us (under bated breath) that they actually do put a little bit of rum into it). It was authentic unlike the ones you're served at the Barista chain of cafes. 

Tasted their mixed sauce pasta too. It was quite good. Lots of veggies and chicken sausage. There is something very special about their baked fish. Haven't had the chance to taste the likes of that elsewhere in Kolkata - Creamy, consistent and the fish is really large and  boneless.

All in all, it is an acceptable place. If you are in for breakfast, do order their pancakes and their variety of omelettes. Since you have to pay less, you may like the place more than Flurys if you are the kind who doesn't fuss about heritage and ambiance!

 P.S. - I didn't know what Jaffa was. Looked up after I got home. Their Jaffa milkshake is a novelty!

P.P.S - They spell it wrong on the menu!

This place is a delight for foodies like us who can't stop looking for an adventurous meal all the time. The food is cheap and very very delicious. The continental fare at Blue Sky is worth killing for, the best part being that it doesn't pinch your pocket! Try the spaghetti and pancakes. You will keep going back I promise.

Once you go Blue Sky, you never go back to ordering burgers at fast food chains. Food and service are amazing. I usually look no further than the long list of burgers, but the Chinese and continental bits are delectable as well. I especially recommend the Grilled Chicken burger, served with fries and Coleslaw. At that price it really doesn't get any better than this.

Definitely one of my fav places in town. And had to review it properly. 
I was here yesterday , celebrating ma'am birthday dinner. 
We ordered fresh lime soda , masala lime soda, fish n' chips and grilled chicken in rosemary sauce and also custard pudding. 
Lime sodas - fresh lime soda was good , it tasted like normal lemonade , and so did the masala lime soda taste the same except it had masala flavour. 
Fish n'chips - one of those things I never fail to order. It came along with mustard sauce and 3 pieces of tomato. 
Fish ~ it was perfectly cooked no sogginess no fishy smell (considering I'm not a big fish person but I love fish n' chips ) 
Finely perfectly cooked and did go well with the mustard sauce. But I wish they introduce the white sauce which is the classic serve with fish n' chips. 
Chips ~ well this also was finely fried. 
So fish n' chips is a big win win here. But just hope they serve the white sauce. 
Grilled chicken in rosemary sauce - this one, everyone should try here! It's way too good n Me being a foodie can't help but drool over it. 
This one came along with rice and boiled veggies. 
Rice ~ had little butter and was perfectly cooked. 
Veggies ~ I love broccoli and corn I got a huge piece of baby corn. Veggies totally complimented the dish. 
Grilled chicken in rosemary sauce ~ the chicken was soft and well grilled. 
And the rosemary sauce had a very very prominent rich taste of rosemary which I find very refreshing. Usually rosemary if overcooked can be a trouble while eating but this place serves it just right. So the chicken is a MUST have here. 
Then came the custard pudding , which was okay. One good thing was it wasn't too sweet at all , just the way I like it. :) 
--------------------------------------------------------------
ambience- simple yet neat n clean ! 
3/5 
Service - 5/5 
Food - 5/5 
Cost - 5/5 ( I wanna rate this 6/5) 
Overall - 4.5/5 
Highly recommended. Must try the grilled chicken in rosemary sauce ( falls under the continental non veg menu ) 
Enjoy :D

Excited and apprehensive as I entered the cafe I was instantly disappointed to find they had a small seating area .BUt at 2:OO pm  we didnt have to wait to get a seat .  Its a nice place to hang out with friends.
The staff were familiar with the custom of serve with a smile. but they are very slow in serivce. They even failed to serve us in the "order" we had ordered :( The waiter had made an error in the billing and charged us Rs 100 extra .....when i pointed that out ..he did correct it but without uttering any words of apology....
the menu is interestingly versatile and the prices too seemed pretty reasonable too.. 
(Here it is important that i add that the prices in the zomato menu are not up to date every thing costs at least 20-30 rupees extra) 
we ordered
 strawberry milk shake: it tasted vey good. But after two three sips i realized the the drink had 3 inch thick layer of foam and when i was half way through, it was very difficult to straw the drink as it contained small pieces of ice which blocked the straw. i was very disappointed ......they should grind the ice more finely from next time
# next time when i visited they really did fix all their errors 
Very little froth , no ice problem and tasted delicious..
The more dense mango milkshake which seemed rather like mango lassi was pretty good too 

schezwan fried rice :tasted very average and it had to salted and sauced ( we used the soya sauce and chili vinegar sauce they had served )  before it tasted any where near good. 
(If Chef Harpal were to visit here he would have to sing " Namak Shamak" for almost all the dishes except the desserts :P)
# 2nd time we ordered hot garlic noodles and they were perfectly  seasoned and very tasty
 
They took a surprisingly long time to serve the chicken cheese grill sandwich ( were they baking the bread or something ??) 
 bread was too thick and the filling too less had few strands of chicken and cheese was no where to be found.
 we had to salt this one too and add tomato sauce as well .....the tomato sauce was very good :P 

after eating all that we waited 2min till we were served the Meat Supremo pizza
taste was good .we had ordered the costliest pizza thinking it would be their best one which had different kinds of toppings..... BUt the base was completely burnt black and tasted bitter ..... yes we had to salt this one too 

after this ordeal we dropped the idea of ordering any dessert:P 
I am still intrigued by their menu though and wish to give this place another try
many people have given it good review and foreigners are often-ing this place as well . May be it was a bad day for them.....
well hope next time this place doesn't let me down    
# I am very happy that they did in fact take care of all the issues i mentioned and fixed their errors.

I've been to blue sky cafe 4-5 times and mostly for breakfast. Good international menu and they've never said things like 'Yeh nahi hoga' or something similar. The dishes are authentic - be it a spanish omlette or pancakes. The ambience is very vibrant with lots of foreign tourists hanging around. The waiters speak good english - sometimes with an accent, which I find irritating. The Irish coffee here is a must-try here! So is the nutella pancake. As are the sandwiches. One of the few good breakfast joints in Kolkata that I know.

It was my niece's birthday and she wanted to go somewhere far from home for breakfast, so we pulled ourselves up from bed and headed for New Market with our groggy eyes and rumbling tummies. Enjoying the early morning fresh air of the otherwise bustling area, needed cups of tea and an incessant amount of photography kept us busy until a few of her close friends arrived with clearly tortured looks on their faces.
When inside the Cafe, we secured the largest table and placed our orders. The place was clean and cheerful and was as expected dotted with happy hippies and foreign tourists with their Indian guides. Our super-friendly server shortly came up with the food, much to our respite from starving. We ordered Chicken Cheese Grilled Sandwiches, Chocolate Pancake and the Chocolate Pudding with Flame. Being skeptical about the food, we refrained from ordering much. The sandwiches which came with a generous helping of potato chips were tasty and filling. The pancakes however were totally disappointing. They were extremely thin and bland with just a spoon of chocolate sauce on top. The pudding was another let down. The flame bit was interesting but that lasted for only a few seconds. Owing to the topmost layer of rum, the first few spoonfuls tasted bitter but it was still better than the rest. As we dug deeper into the bowl, the pudding was more fluid but lacked any flavour.
At the end, there was a lot of cursing under our breaths, but a bite off the sandwiches after dessert subdued that for a while. :P
The place is quite okay in terms of prices and services, but I'd like to discover a better dish over here the next time I drop in.

Great food, great location, but quantity must be improved, and indian foods are not that good compared to the other foods available there. And I think they give more services to the foreigners.

I went there yesterday with a few college friends of mine after seeing the reviews and amazing ratings on Zomato around 2pm. The place was filled with foreigners and we even shared our table with one. We ordered a Kentucky Chicken Burger, a Texas Chicken Burger and since I had a fetish for salads for a long time, decided to try Chicken Hawaiian Salad. Service was really fast and the waiters were really polite. The Texas Chicken Burger came with french fries and a little salad. It looked very much home made and healthy. Tasted great. Though I think the french fries could have been more crispier. Then came the Kentucky Chicken Burger served with chips. It was ok in taste. Niether too great nor too bad but I felt there is a lot of room for improvement in that one. Finally we started with the Hawain Chicken Salad... and alas! I was really disappointed. The fruits tasted fresh but the chicken bits were completely tasteless. Dressing could have been lot better. Suddenly my eyes caught a small notice. It said free wifi is available from 3pm in the afternoons. The waiter was kind enough to punch in the password. Since the speed was around 150kbps which was a bit on the slower side, we decided to have a Nutella Pancake. It was simple yet amazing. The food joint is small but the seating arrangement is really good. And don't rely on your gps. It may lead you to Shudder Street (beside Indian Museum) but the restaurant a block away from where it actually points. But don't worry. Its really famous and anyone can show you the way, as in our case, a puchkawala.

My college is really early in the morning, and it ends early too. You have only so many choices for breakfast joints, but whenever we do go for breakfast, Blue Sky Cafe tops our choices.

You can never go wrong with your order here. From omelettes, to pancakes, to burgers and salads, to momos and babycorn, everything is YUM. If anything, try the Spanish omelette, or the Fried Momos, or the Nutella pancake. 

On top of that, the price is so cheap! You will be spoilt for choice when you get their menu, and it's not like one of those restaurants where they have a whole lot of items, but serve a choice few. They serve everything! The chef(s) are insane!

And service is really good. They suggest their own choices sometimes, which turn out to be really good. They give a personal touch to the service and it really makes you feel good. Must place to visit, especially in the morning. A true American/Continental diner.

I had gone to Cafe blue sky one fine day,some 2 years back,and it was just like that!Sudder st,is famous for old locations,and i wanted to check this out.Blue sky,is mostly frequented by the foreigners,who you will find at any point of time,filling the place.It seats about 30-35 people,with many time you sharing your table with someone from a different nation,which is nice experience.Place is clean,although the service can be slow at times.

The food is mainly light,as the chicken cheese sandwich was,well made,and with fries.Also had cold coffee which was nice.Fresh lime water was decent..they also serve breakfast to around 12 pm,and the Egg cheese omellete is a killer.

A nice place to come,grab a bite and relax,and now they also provide free WiFi :)

I have a life long affair with this City of Joy and restaurants such as Blue Sky Cafe are a major reason why.

I like to walk around the city on weekends just by myself and on one such trips I had chanced upon Blue Sky Cafe. It looked highly unimpressive but was the only one open at 10 AM in the morning. I walked in and was surprised to see the tiny place over-crowded with mostly foreigners. It was so crowded infact that I had to share my table with two other women who happened to be visiting India from the U.S. I ordered myself a chicken mushroom cheese omlette and a cold coffee milk shake.  The food arrived and I was in like. The bill arrived and I was in love. This was way back in 2007. Ever since then I frequent Blue Sky Cafe and it has never disappointed me till date.

I have had a variety of their breakfast items and recommend most of them. The omelettes to start with. I don't know what they do with it but every single time the omelette arrives light and fluffy. Then the pancakes. They make an amazing Nuetella Banana Pancake. The Chicken Sausages is also a must which they serve with a lip smacking cheese dip. But I think I am most fond of the Burgers served here specially the Kentucky Burger and the Chicken Sunrise Burger. They are far far superior than any Burgers served in the much costlier fast food joints. Also they make the most amazing thick frothy milkshakes in front of your eyes. For me it is like witnessing magic.

This place also serves Indian and Chinese. I did order the Chinese here once and it was not per my taste at all. I suggest NEVER to order the Indian or the Chinese here.

The staff are competent considering the huge rush of customers they have to serve to almost everyday. They also hang around and give suggestions, which I like. As I mentioned earlier there is not much of an ambiance, but you know the saying - "Never judge a book by its cover."

The cafe does not give a very good 1st impression.The place is quite small, not very clean, seating arrangements may not satisfy all. However, given the taste of the food, the drawbacks can be excused! We ordered chicken pepper steaks, baked fish, mixed hakka noodles,chicken cheese grilled sandwich and spaghetti. The dishes were served within 10 minutes., hats off to the prompt and efficient service. The prices are reasonable enough and the quantity is just perfect. This place is worth a visit with friends.

my rating and review is strictly based on the continental and italian i have tasted here so far. located at the sudder street , at walking distance from lindsay, blue sky cafe for me has become a place for a quick budget meal after shopping.the main advantage here is that they do not levy additional vat on their prices, and prices in itself are very affordable, if not cheap.
decoration and ambience wise, no one will prefer to rate it.the inside is clean, comfortable and air conditioned to say the most.
but the food, the topic of discussion even  did not much impress me as well.
pasta alfredo - was one of the better things i had here, quantity was impressive. and that's it. it tasted good.
pasta arrabiata- did not suit my palate.
mixed meat salad- the veggies lacked variety were slices of cucumber and tomato, dressed with mayo with pieces of meat and egg white.it was an average dish.
chicken macaroni au gratin- this was the best dish i had there.worth recommending.
chocolate pudding with flame- only thing i liked about it was the presentation,yes the flame on the bowl served on our table was an instant eyecatcher of every customer in the house. but coming to the pudding, it lacked in consistency and even the taste..my sister described it like  the hot chocolate flavoured complan she had to forcefully drink in her school days.we couldnot force ourselves much, and left it after consuming half of it.

i might drop in for the pizza,burgers and thai menu again ; hoping to rate a wholesome 4 soon.
for now, 3 out of 5 , for blue sky cafe.

The BEST Cafe/Restuarant I have went so far! I hardly review a restuarant but this is worth reviewing it! I first came here 2 months ago and ordered cold coffee with ice cream and a chicken cheese sandwitch. I loved the taste of it and when the bill came,I was shocked to see that they charge no VAT on it. Later I went with my friends and tried Mushroom Pepper Salt,Shredded Chicken in Oyster Sauce,Jumbo and Kentucky Burger,Friend Chicken Wanton,Country Feast Pizza and the bill amount was so low that I didn't expect it to be. The staff over here is very friendly,the people working over here are very friendly and nice and the food comes quick always! The manager and the staffs have come to know me well and I still try their new dishes and trust me I have never been disappointed with one trying a new dish. Its THE BEST PLACE! The only problem is that they don't have a washroom but this place is worth coming. 
P.S Also try their Cheese Pakora and Nutella Pancakes. They are so yummy! Undoubtedly the best place.

I went there today, after reading the review on Zomato. And, I wasn't let down at all.
This place serves quite authentic continental and italian food. Although many people wouldn't quite like the ambiance, I kind of liked it. The place has a nice old world charm to it. 
Coming to food, we were a group of 3; we had ordered almost 7 dishes (yes, we were THAT hungry), including a sweet lime juice and a mango lassi, and the total expense was only around 575 bucks! Beat that! And the only reaction which I could afford after gorging on the sumptuous meal, was "Okay, I'm gonna be back in a couple of days!"

I went there with a friend,after reading about it on a t2 feature.It was a sunday,and when i spotted the place,i had my doubts,When i entered the rooms,my suspicions deepened as it was a bit...er....different from the average decor.
The place was fiiled with foreigners,and,consequently noisy.However,i kept my misgivings down and i ordered....and the food delivered!Alleluia!
We ordered a mixed meat salad,chicken agratin,and cheese chilli toast.The toast was good,the agratin heavy and spicy.If u are a cheese lover,u'll love it.However,my friend was not and he said it was tad too cheesy.The stunner was the mix meat salad....with tender diced meat,veggies,mayo....all served within a ring of cucumber slices topped with olives.
Then came the piece de resistance....the chocolate pudding with flame.They served it with a real violet flame on top.It has a layer of rum on it.Now,personally,the smell of rum always puts me off,but the taste was good....they probably used dark chocolate as the pudding had a delicious chocolatey bitterness to it.
And then,the pocket pinch....510!Unbelievable!

This place is too good...the food is awesome in taste and the price is affordable right in the heart of the city...we ordered Grilled Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce, Grilled Chicken with Rosemary Sauce and a Pasta with Large Prawn and Tangy Tomato Sauce..the name is probably Penne Ala Arrabiatta if i am not wrong....the Cheese Chilli Garlic Toast was also too good..even better than Pizza Hut. The place is little cramped but thats not a big deal...the waiters are good...though the Pizza that an Italian couple ordered in my adjacent seat was a little burnt..so i am looking forward to going there again to try the Spaghetti, Pasta and other Continental flair...Double Thumbs Up for Sure

This simple looking one storied place on Sudder Street looks plain and overpriced from the outside. Located in a neighborhood teeming with foreigners, you'd think it's a deathtrap for your pocket. I believed my girlfriend's suggestion and entered bravely. And I was amply rewarded for my choice. :) A snug air and ample seating will welcome you along with a menu which will make you smile as much as the smiley before this sentence. 
The place looks even plainer on the inside with minimum ambience and is definitely a family joint. It's particularly liked by the foreigners whom you will see in large numbers. The crowd at such places where foreigners frequent sometimes is a bit rowdy, but here that's not a problem. The staff are friendly and the service is fast. The gaudy wall pictures bearing Indian motiffs and sayings are hilarious to look at. Add to that a nice location just behind the Indian Museum with a short walk from the metro and you've got a winner.

The food here makes you simply happy. The quality, portions and servings of all dishes were extremely satisfying. The menu is divided primarily between the Continental, Italian and Indian sections. The continental items are costlier than you'd like and it's best to leave the Indian part for the " Gora's ". Ordering the Italian and finishing off with a dessert is suggested. 

For starters we had a pancake with lemon. The pancake was well fried with just the sweetness just right. The two pieces of smallish cutlemon looked a bit rudimentary though. 
The cardinal pizza with an oozing capsicum, onion and and chicken topping came second. I swear these guys have the potential to put any large pizza chain out of business. The size of the pizza was quite large considering the price. The chicken pieces were large and abundant. The grilled cheese was thickly covered with the sauce and mayonnaise hitting the perfect balance. The thick crust of the bread was supplemented by it's softness.
The high of our meal came last in the form of a dish which has raised this establishment to the status of a cult hangout, the Chocolate Pudding with Flame. It is served with a dancing blue flame on top which makes it look beautiful. The simmering chocolate cools fast though. The first smell which hits you is of the Rum they add on the top. **Do I need to say more ?**  :) The dark brown look and slight bitter taste reminds of American Chocolate. The spreading Chocolate is served in a large bowl which is for 2 -3 persons. I repeat that it's a struggle for 2 people.
The fact that they don't charge VAT broadens the smile.

Chakraborty Tip : A particularly funny sight :- Both locals as well as foreigners glued to the old bollywood movies being shown on the small tv.

Went there with a friend. We both are known as foodie and when we came to know about this place we thought of checking it out. I would say Cafe blue sky offers one of the best continental foods in Kolkata. Those who love continental must visit here. The meat salad, omlette, pasta and soup were really tasty and delicious. The ambience good to go there with friends, having chit chat with them along with good food.

we entered this place around 7:30  and it was filled up with foreigners and we two were the only Indian that time . certainly gives you  the feel of a so called ethnic European Bistro. ambiance is not so nice. decent place. no room for privacy if you want. but if you want food with extremely cheap budget this place is 5 out of 5. 

Now comes the quality of the food. -  we ordered mixed Tom yum soup and it was very spicy and very delicious. Next came mixed Meat salad , it was very cheesy, very tender and very tasty . den came  scrumptious chicken veg agratin and it stole the show. finally we ordered chocolate pudding with flame , and it was unique. thin layers of rum above and a flame :) .. it test different but nice. waiters are very well behaved and friendly.
 
Now the bill. unbelievably cheap - Rs 435 only . soup, salad, main course and dessert,  just for 400 bucks and extremely good quality . just becoz of the ambiance i deduct .5 . overall very nice  place to eat in the heart of the city .

Great place for foodies on a budget.. You've got pretty much every dish you can think of on their menu, and most of them being pretty good! Though ambiance is nowhere near comfortable, as the place is almost always full, with some foreigner couple taking sitting too close to you! :P Anyways, you'd hardly complain when you see the prices, given the quality and quantity of their food! 
My pick would be the Kentucky burger. Since I had it for the first time, I really don't care about the Maharaja Mac anymore! Kentucky tastes rich, and costs you 65 bucks.. We've tried the Sandwiches, Chicken Au Gratin and Chopsuey,  all of which tasted pretty good.. And good news, they're probably the only place left who gives you a glass bottle of Pepsi at 15 bucks! 
A great place.. I'd be going back there many times more.. :)

Went to Blue Sky Cafe for a breakfast. It reminds me of a Diner in NYC - typical small place, tables in a row, silver and red walls and a small kitchen. The place being full of tourists is another aspect. The menu is totally continental - omelettes, breads, pancakes, sandwiches, flakes etc. and I must say the service was nice. 

We tried the cinnamon toast, the omelettes, pancakes with Nutella and hot coffee. Preparation was really good. A favourite joint of mine in Kolkata is Flurys. As far as food is concerned - this cafe beats Flurys! The only thing I wish we had was the ambience. It's a hidden small joint more than a classy decor place. 

The honey ginger, lemon  tea was neat served in a typical glass. 

Amused with words like 'Free Wai Fai' and 'Backed Beans Toast' - it's just on the lighter side. The guys have worked hard on keeping customers enjoy with a smile. 

If you are in the City of Joy and are in the mood for something totally different - try this!

Location : Enter the lane beside the Indian Museum and follow it till you hit the place on the right side! 

Ambiance : Negligible!  It's very simple and ordinary to be precise. Kinda like the Diners beside the Highways.
 
The Grub : Ordered the Texas chicken burger with a meat supreme pizza and a strawberry milkshake with ice cream and apple fritters. The one thing that will certainly put a smile on your face before you even touch the food is the price of the dishes. Highly economical!! The burger was fine, but was devoid of any cheese. The plate came with a helping of French fries. The highlight of the afternoon was the pizza. It was very well done with the guey cheese, olives, and a host of different meats. The crust was thick yet juicy on the inside. The strawberry milkshake was good but it was nothing to go gaga  over!.  The apple fritters were delicious though, dipping it in the vanilla ice cream lent a nice flavor to it. 

Service : Extremely polite is what I would say while referring to the waiters. Although waiting for the food to arrive took longer than usual.

USP : Despite the lack of any suitable ambiance this place is a hot spot for foreigners. In fact four of the five people you meet here will be an outsider. From Americans to Europeans to Filipinos, you'll find 'em all here having a gala time. 

Final conclusion : The food isn't spectacular but the prices are!!  Italian is something they excel in. The American dishes were fine. With a Lackluster ambiance, but a friendly crew, this place is quite popular with the crowds. Extremely cheap with acceptable portions. Cost for 2 : 700/-. Worth a visit!!

Blue Sky Cafe ! 

If you are the kind of person who loves food that matches your pocket size ( you know specially when you are out with your age old girlfriend whom you don't need to impress ) or if you are the foodie who loves to eat cheap as with no compromise in the quality , this place is perfect for you! 

I have been living in Calcutta ( i like to call it so .. ) for the last 21 years and whenever i go out shopping with my friends or just goofing around new market area, I have to visit Blue sky cafe ! 
Their best sellers are the pancakes which are basically flat pancakes ( specially the nutella ones) and they can pair it up with your favorite ice cream just for 100 bucks ! 
If you like spice ( like me ) then you must ask for the chilly fish ! 

The place will remind you of small road side bistros , extremely casual dining , which is something that i like in this fast growing city ! And if you are lucky to knock during breakfast timings, you should totally ask for the baked beans on toast with eggs of your choice and also SAUSAGES ! AAH ! 

You'd be a fool to miss this ! So prove me wrong eh ? 
Have fun and feel free to let me know about your experience !!

Blue Sky Cafe serves everything you need
3.5 out of 5

After managing the huge crowd of New Market, whenever I feel the need for some real refreshment, only Blue Sky Cafe comes to mind. Located in Sudder Street, this cafe is something more than a normal restaurant as it offers a lot of options on its menu, from Chinese to Indian, Continental, Italian as well as light snacks, desserts and beverages. Compared to its small size and off-beat location, the menu is quite lengthy and the food is good.

Whenever you step into this cafe cum restaurant, you will come across a lot of foreigner diners; sometimes you will find you're the only Indian among the other diners (barring the staff and your companions). This is a common scenario here. Coming to the ambience, there is nothing extraordinary to talk about. The tables and chairs are arranged in rows so this small food joint can accommodate a larger number of diners. So, if you are planning a private lunch or dinner with your date, you'd better avoid this place because you may have to sit beside a stranger to have your meal here as this place is always full. 

Service is very fast and effective, with a homely touch to their service. To start with, the food is really good. I haven't tasted many of their main course dishes, although I have been there many times. So far, we've ordered Chicken Momo (in all the three forms), Pan Fried Chilli Chicken, Barcetta Pizza, Penne Grilled Chicken Salad, Tandoori chicken and chicken reshmi and tikka kabab. Every item on that list was really wonderful and Blue Sky Cafe demands repeat visits. I have realized that this place is really the "Jack of all Trades". In addition, when it comes to paying the bill, you will never have to worry as their prices are really on the lower end. This place deserves a better rating than its peers as Blue Sky Cafe can always tantalize your taste buds with its delightful preparations.

Of the many cafe's that dot Sudder street, this perhaps conforms to the "Atithi Deva Vaba" adage more than anyone I have seen.. If you visit the place and have to wait for your table, the waiters will pop up every few minutes apologizing profusely for the delay..
I went there with my friends a couple of days back and strictly speaking, if you are looking for ambiance, this place is a strict no-no! You will feel cramped for space and there is no room for privacy here..
We ordered a shepherd's pie, pasta bolognese and a chicken penne au gratin. All of them tasted really well. The pasta was delicious and authentic. But the au gratin really stole the show! Be sure to try it if you give this place a visit. The smoothies are also very well made and not too sweet.
The pricing is pretty standard and the portions offered are also quite moderate ( 3 dishes shared among 4 wont make you full).
But as I said they are really really friendly! Sample this: my friend broke one of the bowls and the waiter offered him ice!! And they vehemently refused to take money when we offered to refund the cost of the bowl! Hats off to you Blue Sky. I hope you always remain this friendly.
P.S. They also give free hugs!

The Blue Sky Cafe or the Cafe Cielo Azul as they like to call it, is a tiny and cosy place located very conveniently in Sudder Street near the New Market area. If you're lost, just ask anyone they'll point it out to you. The first thing you'd probably notice that you're the only 'native' in that place. The waiters are quick, friendly and really efficient. The food is great, I must say. I went with my connoisseur friend Shounak Ghosh and we had pineapple juices, Chocolate pancakes and a Chicken Margarita au Gratin. When the bill came, I was surprised really. Didn't except this kind of place to be as easy on the pockets. Great food, easy on your pockets, what else do you need! Definitely visit this place if you're nearby!

From outside, seriously you won't consider it as a Cafe to hangout. It looks much like a small rented Tours & Travels agency filled with foreigners. Again, if you do feel it like a cafe and once stepped in... Don't except any sort of fancy interior like other Restaurants around Park Street.

The place is not to big but the ambiance will soothe you as it is very homely. No doubt, the staff looks nothing less than any normal Irani Hotel service boys but they are very prompt and friendly! They offers a wide variety of foods... Keeping in view about the foreign customers , they kept the chart and the quality of food up to the standard.

But, I didn't found out the 'Sunrise Burger' throughout the Burgers' section which was no doubt very good. Here, the Indian foods are not so noteworthy. They're not bad but average. Try out the pancakes and Spaghetti Cardinale.

Overall, from price point of view, in one word "Paisaa Vasool". Not 'Perfect' but 'Decent' place to hangout with friends of 2/3 or you can come along with your partner (if in case nothing suites you or you're craving out for a place to feed within or under your budget). I'll give 3.5/5. Hoping 4 another visit very soon...

I am always on the lookout for good, cheap, easily accessible eateries in Kolkata. 
Case in point: Blue Sky Cafe.....
It's a small food outlet located just a couples of lanes away from the New Market complex. When you start noticing a little too many foreigners in loose-fitting, flowing Indian tops or kurtas, you're probably standing right outside this cafe. It's not a magnificent looking affair, but if you've spent a day through New Market and it's larger-than-life crowds, then you'd love just sinking into a chair at this cosy parlour.
The seating is basically rows of tables and chairs side-by-side, but the ambience is very homely (although 8 out of 10 people there will be foreigners). The waiters are very prompt and efficient, and I must say this: the service was faster than anything I've seen.
As for the food, this cafe offers a vast variety of items in spite of its size, and my friends and I (3 ppl in all), had pineapple juices, a Chocolate pancake and a Chicken Margarita au Gratin. Also we ended up thirsty so we washed it down with fresh lemon sodas. The food tasted great, and the costs really went easy on our pockets. Two thumbs up for this place. I'm definitely going again.

This eatery is located at the new market area. Food quality is really very good along with good service and quite reasonable prices. i tried their momos, hong kong chicken and shanghai chicken....all were very tasty and wholesome. In thai section the thai soup is very delectable and my moat fav. In the italian section i love their Barcetta Pizza...it is really very well made.
I would rate 3.5 for Blue Sky Cafe.

Blue Sky Cafe is one of my favourites. With amazing food in really amazing prices, this place is a must go for every food lover. Italian, Chinese, Continental, Thai...you name it...you'll get it. There are no favourite dishes for this restaurant. You'll love them all. :D 

I'll give a fine 4 out of 5 for Blue Sky Cafe.

Ambience: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Cost: 4/5

When one has burnt a hole in one's pocket and yet wants delicious food in a place where those who serve you are friendly and remembers you post a few visits The Blue Sky Cafe is the place to be. Located right behind New Market on Sudder Street one must try their Chicken Steak from the starters (Continental Section) which is quite delicious. It is not really a steak but a large piece of chicken breast coated in a wonderful batter, fried and served with plenty of vegetables and a nice smoky sauce. Their pancakes, especially the Nutella filled ones are tempting and so are the omlettes. They serve food which is value for money which seems a rarity these days. Their coffee is moderately strong and they make it extra strong on request. Their offer of seasonal fresh fruit juice is actually freshly pressed. The added attraction is that the shop opens real early, 7 a.m. for those in want of a nice hearty breakfast.

This is definitely a good place for continentals. its best for me when fund is a problem but  i  want  to flatter my taste senses. ambiance is so so,but quality and taste is not compromised with the moderate price.

Fond memories don't translate into good reviews.

It's decent especially for a college crowd but don't expect anything out of the ordinary. It's targeted at the cheap hippy scene but doesn't compromise much on value. Great for breakfast or high tea, but definitely not a front runner for a decent lunch or dinner. Go here if you're low on cash or just need a place to sit down after new market's madness.

I have spent many a wonderful evening at Blue Sky. Located very conveniently on Sudder, it'd be very difficult to miss. Very friendly staff and more friendly people come in. The max junta are the foreign tourists - so evidently the menu is more suited for them.

Mango Lassi, Shepherd's Pie and Custard Pudding are must tries.They also have a pretty good burger. You might want to avoid Indian food here. It's quite average actually. However, their Italian is quite good. 

Nothing extraordinary interiors, but might be a nice place to watch a cricket/football match.

800 for two is actually quite incorrect. 600-650 is more like it.
