Usually go to this place for takeaways when feeling too lazy to cook dinner. My mom loves their egg tadka. The chicken and mutton dishes are quite tasty. Pocket friendly prices, sufficient quantity and quick service.

Not bad. Worth it if you re living nearby. Keep buying from here not just out of necessity. Some of the dishes like mixed veg are quite good
