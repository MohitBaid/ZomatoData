I ordered food out which aloo dum has too much of garlic cause of that the flavour of the sabzi was sour but other stuffs were really tasty like paneer butter masala and masala kulcha was also up to the mark.
Now coming to service,I had a bad experience coz it take too long time.Please make sure to put less amount of garlic on sabzi and services should be fast.
Thank you.
