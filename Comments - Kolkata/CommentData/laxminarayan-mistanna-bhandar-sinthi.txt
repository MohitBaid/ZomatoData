In spite of being located in the most prime place in the area .. the ambience is poor .. there has been no improvement in the tidiness of the shop ... earlier (say about 15 years ago) .. the sweets used to great .. but now the quality is very poor .. 
It's better to avoid the sweets displayed .. 
only thing a very hungry person can try is the hot kachuri (but not at all the Dal served therewith) .. it's cheap and worth for a while ..
otherwise, the place is not even worth a review or finding it's place on Zomato ..

This mishti-shop has a great location advantage of being in Sinthi More. Despite having a large consumer base, this shop doesn't have enough variety of sweets. Not just that, the sweets are sometime stale. The shop is also very dirty and full of flies wandering on sweets. The best service you can get here is 'Luchi & Chholar Daal' at breakfast and even during the afternoon. In some special days, they sale Kulfi.
I would suppose having such a popularity and sizeable customer base, their sweet-shop must be clean!!!!!....must be clean!!!!

It's another decent sweet shop close to our home (the Sinthi area does have it's fair share of sweet shops) which also serves snacks come early morning or evening. Their 'Singara' (not Samosa) is delightful as is the 'Kamalabhog' (which is a variation of the 'Rajbhog'). Considering the competition around they've maintained their popularity due to the standard of hygiene & excellent management.

One of the famous 'mishti' outlets at this place. Good quality sweets. Tasty, yummm!
The dal kachouri tastes great and is a superb preparation for the breakfast. This place maintains hygiene.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Right at the Sinthi More Crossing near to my house. This is a very old place and very well named for its service from so many days. The name seems to be a sweet shop but it has more than that for your likings. With the selling of sweets they also provide you with breakfast dishes and other food stuffs. My visit to this place was way long ago.

AMBIENCE AND STAFF: Ambience is fine but very ordinary, joint wooden table with benches to take the seat. In the morning it seems very dim inside from the bus but its not. Its built in from the very old times with old walls paints and floor. Sometimes very unhygienic and dirty. Your mood will go off when you find the eaten utensils still lying on the table to be taken off. Few staffs are there  to take your order quickly.

FOOD: Sweets are very nice here thou tasted very less of them. The Singhara and the Kachori here with dal are my personal favorites here. The jalebis are also satisfactory. Havent tried many dishes, looking forword too. 

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality is average so is the Quantity. Prices are fine according to the current rated everywhere.

CONCLUSION: Being a sweet shop this place have managed some daily customers here for breakfast. Sometime very crowded in the morning.

Note: The review is based on personal visit and Experience to this place.

Was at this place a while ago to taste some sweets and turned out to be a really good sweet corner.
Tried 6 different sweets including gulab jamun and few barfis, I don't know their names but the taste was good and maybe I will go again to this place after meal someday if I happen to be around Sinthi.
