Entry fee : 1000 / couple and 1500 for single .. non redeemable. After the first step we took, we were simply left awestruck by their mismanagement. We were 4 people but they can only offer us a table of 3 and not even an additional chair. To my surprise, all tables were set for 3 people. They charges 6000 for table which needs to be pre booked. After a lots of discussion they finally provided us an extra chair after shifting us to a corner. They don't have a proper menu card rather just some Xerox chits. Menu prices are not updated. Music were looping so if you seat down for couple of hours be prepare for same songs even on Friday night. Table attendant was good in nature rest everyone seemed to be arrogant , specially those who were at gets. Only points for their exceptionally good Vanilla Hookah and starter platter. I ll definitely not visit this place again.

I went there on a Saturday at around 9pm and was surprised to see the entire club was empty, hence we entered the club without any charges and hassles as have been reading in the below reviews. I was told that the crowd starts pouring in from 10pm and the party lasts till 3 o' clock in the morning. Guess I was too early for a night club and couldn't wait till late to see the full house. Maybe sometimes later will just visit again just to see the crowd and how the place is when its full. 

The place is big with sofas and chairs. The ambience is cool and apt for a night club.

I ordered Gandharaj Fish Kebab which was quite good taste wise.

Arguably the best club in Kolkata now.
I expected it to be bigger, considering the unbelievable hype around this place.
Looks beautiful and very classy. Equally good music.
Seating's okay-ish. We got the couch on the far left, very comfy.

Food and alcohol.
Both overpriced. They don't offer much in the way of food, pizza's the safest option.
Beer. A pint of Kingfisher costs Rs.500.
But they don't have most other beers.
Very courteous staff though.

Go here if you're looking for a good night of clubbing and a decent crowd.

@Management - Stock more beers, at least BIRA and Miller.

Never order food! 
Ordered French fries which they charged ₹500 for. Thats the most expensive french fries I have ever seen. Then when we tasted it, it was stale! Seriously!! Outrageous! Though we dint complaint since it was really crowded & simply left that basket as it is in the picture. It seemed like, they gave us leftovers from before. They don't have a proper menu on event nights, they charge as much as they like. Their are way better night clubs than what this place is. Simply waste of my money...

Well they have tried to make it as good as it gets in Kolkatta, yes I am saying it right without any corrections. Went their on a weekday and it was quite sad to be in unlike other places in Kolkatta. I never found the night life as good as Mumbai or delhi it still need to be moved quite a notches up to match a metro city but, what the hell its the city of joy we talk about. I would give the music a 8 out of 10 and ambiance a 7 the menu would be a 3 and staff a 7 again friendly and informative I would say. If your in the bong captain do visit this place once and try for a Thursday of weekends.

One of the best of its kind with a big dance floor and ample place to sit and relax while grooving to the awesome tracks of the  in house DJ. The food is lip smacking with good number of varieties which is rarely seen in a pub/ lounge bar. The ambience and decor is truly up to the franchisee standards. The stuffs are courteous though they lack one small essential quality of a human emotion which is "Smile". The crowd is mostly young college goers and residents of central Kolkata. Overall a nice experience and will be looking forward for visiting the place more often.

Ladies please visit this place on a Thursday evening after 8pm...u shall be treated with amazing cocktails (3 for each pax) and without spending a single penny. The ambience was really amazing, first i tried french fries and fish & chips. Fish & chips was really costly but it was worth it, french fries were regular. Ask the bartender to make something for you and trust me the bartenders here make amazing cocktails. I tried mojito and it was amazing, the second drink was something with mango and jaljeera and it was fabulous in taste. The last cocktail I had was a alcoholic kesar badam and it was probably the best cocktail i ever had till date. I also tried chicken drums of heaven and they were very juicy inside and crisp outside, perfectly tosses in the sauce. A very much recommended club, specially for the ladies on every Thursday after 8pm.

Club Boudoir is the hottest party spot in town, so we decided to pay a vist. The atmosphere is electric , the decor is great, the seats are quite cozy,the lighting was quiet impressive and the dance was sure to grab your eyes. However, the only drawback is that they have a short food menu listed just like a coffee shop but drinks menu is long and quiet expensive.
We just ordered a mini pizza which at best was mediocre and had a few drinks and cocktails and the bill came approximately 5000 . And also a major drawback is that they a separate room for having hookah.

The Decor is amazing, great music,good quality of food & liquor, the staff is friendly, nice place to party, good option for Private parties.
The drawback being is on the entry, the people at the entry are not very friendly, and the behavior towards guests is bad for except Pushpa Pandey & Anand Gupta.
Its probably the best night club in Kolkata just the entry part needs to be looked after.

Good food, great bar with a spreaded liquor options, exotic shishas. And not to forget the awesome cocktails by Rana, Rajdeep and Nitya. Hospitality at its best. Music is something which will take you to the dance floor. I m in love with the place.

Went there for a few times. I had the worst experience when I went their with my friends the last time. A waiter (with a French Cut) was not at all friendly and he kept asking us to order for more than 2-3 times in the first 10mins or so. When we did, he told us a certain thing in a sarcastic manner as we didn't order much booze. After that treatment we were not there for long amd left soon. Though the atmosphere was wonderful as well as the people there the waiter turned off our mood. Never gave anyone a 1star. But sorry had to.

Visited the place on a Thursday night .the first thing that got my attention was the awesome interior.the sitting arrangement was quite innovative and mostly for couples with cozy sofas ,two sitters and some interesting chairs..the neon lit dance floor was sure a hit . It was Thursday and we did not want to gef wasted ...so we opted for breezers and ended up ordering six of them !!! but what disappointed us was the food menu.its way too short and simple and just like a coffee shop menu.though they have an elaborate and interesting drink menu to offer. The sheesha room is secluded from the main dance floor and it's not that roomy ..music is too loud to strike a conversation and Linda monotonous.the place started to lit up after 11pm. And d crowd went insane when d DJ started playing some real stuffs...over all a nice experience..

Location : on theatre road near Kala Mandir
Pocket pinch : High
Pros: location ,bar menu ,sitting arrangement ,interior, dance floor, DJ
Cons : too expensive ,food menu ,parking (always full,ALWAYS)

Location is very prime. Visited on a weekend .Chic ambiance , music very average for a Friday night . 
Surprisingly the food menu resembled a next door cafe or coffee parlour, with its look and array of dishes . Staff service was ok.  Hookah was being served in a small private chamber which didn't even look like a part of the club. 
Anyhow, judging it on one visit will be unfair so will visit again and hope for a better experience .

This place has been in my 'must visit ' list since a long time now.Had high expectations!! The lady at the entrance was cold and unwelcoming 😒Went with friends on a Friday night .They charged 2k for entry and cover charge. The place is too flashy with sitting arrangements suitable for mostly couples.Most of them were emptyy when we went but had reserved card on them.After around 11pm the place was packed.Very very less options to eat! So better eat ur meal and come.U can count on ur fingers .Enjoyed my drinks with a very very long list to choose from.(spoilt for choice unlike the food part) .Music was pathetic. No one was on d dance floor even after 11pm. We requested them to play some bollywood .The whole dance floor was lit up as soon as Bollywood nos lined up.Lights are extremely dim. And music too loud to have any conversation.The place is not worth spending 2k per person and coming empty stomach .Overall wud NVR want to visit this place again .

Horrible behaviour of the staff ,they are rude and have a very bad attitude. I am not sure if they are trained well enough to speak to guests. Reached the club directly from office hence had a bottle of water in the bag . While checking the bag the man at the door only told me to keep the bottle inside my bag (it was in the side pocket of my bag and was showing).I had back to back dance performance and needed to sip water in between. At that point of time one security person came and told me not to drink water from my bottle and I said OK to that and went ahead to the dance floor. Now while I was in the middle of a dance one lady (security of the club) came up to the dance floor and started shouting at me. I told them to be calm as I have been told that once and was not required. Still she kept on yelling and I was bound to raise my voice and asked her to behave.
Was not in a mood to create a scene hence while leaving just informed the manger about the incident to which she gave me an extremely cold reaction and did not apologise.
Have visited a lot of clubs in Kolkata  and abroad have never experienced such bad behaviour from the staff ever. 
I would never ever recommend this club to anyone I know. 
The place looks good , has a good ambience but needs to appoint well trained and well behaved staff.

As the name suggests Club Boudoir... when the door closes behind you...it gives you a feel of being in a place where anything can happen any time...a perfect setting which can bring out the devil in you...I had a lazy smile and relaxed in the cushiony soft chairs...and from my vantage point it felt I was in a Hollywood movie set...the music is awesomely distributed, the sitting arrangements give enough space to be private, the lighting was magical .... the service personnel was discreet but always available...and you can smoke at tour table....I had ordered Corona and Gandhoraj fish kebabs..kebabs were succulent and very fresh when I had to leave as my male friends were not attired as per the club rules ( no open toes) and could not join us...my requests of an exception went unheeded as they are extremely strict( 😢seemed stricter than RBI). Wish it was clearly stated..the place was nearly empty so I feel they could have allowed...otherwise if you want to relax...or want an edgy feel go enter the Club and wait for it to engulf you...it's simply a lovely place to be...

I thought of writing down about boudoir on my first visit itself..but wanted to explore it more..
This club flaunts an extravagant ambience..a place which may not fit pockets easily..
I was here with my gang on V-day as well as on friday (03.03.17)..
The drinks we ordered were nice and subtle being a blended scotch whiskey, smirnoff and among cocktails were LIT (longislandicedtea)..
Now coming to food..food was something I loved to the core..from grilled chicken ,golden fried prawns,fish finger,chicken wraps ,dry chilli chicken to mini pizzas..everything was perfectly cooked and suited our taste buds well..no doubt it's a happening place but it remains very empty..on my both visits we were the only group along with 1-2 of them..
A must visit though:)

Boudoir is one of the Best places to be in on a weekend if you want to experience some great nightlife scene....
Its Located very conviniently...
Spacious dance floor with great interiors surely mesmerizes you every singly time you visit the place..
Bouncers are really well mannered and the Bartenders are also helpful...
Drinks are really good and the food too..
P.S👉🏿The in house dj's also does a great job 
So in all if you want to experience a great weekend
BOUDOIR is the place to be 
P.S👉🏿Valet Parking was also good though ✌🏿️

This night club at Kolkata has a lovely ambiance with a big dance floor. it is a tad bit too expensive. The cocktail list needs ti be updated. The staff is excellent and courteous..

I thought of writing down about boudoir on my first visit itself..but wanted to explore it more..
This club flaunts an extravagant ambience..a place which may not fit pockets easily..
I was here with my gang on V-day as well as on friday (03.03.17)..
The drinks we ordered were nice and subtle being a blended scotch whiskey, smirnoff and among cocktails were LIT (longislandicedtea)..
Now coming to food..food was something I loved to the core..from grilled chicken ,golden fried prawns,fish finger,chicken wraps ,dry chilli chicken to mini pizzas..everything was perfectly cooked and suited our taste buds well..no doubt it's a happening place but it remains very empty..on my both visits we were the only group along with 1-2 of them..
A must visit though:)

This place is very beautiful and a must go with your girl gangs on a Thursday because you get  wine there on Thursday that too for free .. ya the food there was pretty expensive .. but then if you are with a group then it would seem fine to you.

Visited club on my last visit to the city, by a recommendation of a friend. Found to be the best one till now I visited in the city of joy. 

Superb music played by Dj Amit.  Music was super and met all the expectations of the crowd. Mouth watering dishes. But just need a little quick service . 

Do wish to visit the club on my every next visits .

Had gone there for a bachelors party for the fist time..!! Must say that the ambience is too good and the food too..! The only thing that needs to improve is the quality of songs that dj was playing was not that great which can keep the dancers on their toes..! Needs to work on that to be one of the great clubs in kolkata...!!

Hit this crazy place on New Year's Eve and boy oh boy was it a treat. Insane ambience. Amazing food even on a crowded night such as the New Years. 
What amazed the most is the prompt service to the table even on a busy night. 

Would love to hit this well decorated lounge again on a not so crowded night. :)

We waited till 11 oclock for the dj to play atleast one decent song, and finally left because it was soo boring. I havent seen a worse dj in my life. The place is expensive,thats okay not every place will be  pocket friendly but the taste of their food sucks. Coming to the ladies night, they have 3 free cocktails/ shots for the ladies. The good things about this place -1)decor 2)waiter  (extremely sweet and wrll natured)

Club boudoir is the biggest club in town. Located in Shakespeare sarani which makes the genre of clubbers to hop very easily to this place.
Its a Dubai based brand and has done well in Dubai too. Big dance floor, huge bar and a very upmarket interiors is at your disposal. They serve exotic range of sheesha's.
The best part about this place is that they have separate private party area which was just fantabulous. I met Mr Ismet in the club who has come down from boudoir dubai to design operations in kolkata. He is a true gentleman and is very hospitable.
Would recommend this place to all club goers.

So visited the much hyped club of Kolkata this Christmas. There was a Christmas party so we had to pay a ransom to get an entry there. The pass gave us the permit to have unlimited drinks and food. All in all a lovely place which was much needed by this city. The dance floor is huge and spacious. The food is nice too. Everything was on the house so we ate n boozed till we were tipsy enough to even dance..Only thing i disliked about this place was its music. The DJ was not apt for a place like Boudoir..

The atmosphere at the entrance looked promising; This place will lighten up your mood with its first look with all that jazziness . It's a spacious club thus Saturdays are less pushy and shovey here... 
Couple charges were 2000 INR out of which 1000 was redeemable and rest cover charges which we thought was baseless. But we wanted to try the place so we thought of giving it a chance. On entering the space was quite huge with people drinking and dancing on the floor. The turn off was the music. Expectation: English hi end pop Reality: Hindi govinda songs. Although I wouldn’t mind dancing on Hindi numbers but somehow it wasn’t going with the atmosphere. Menu is limited to only 20 dishes or so. But the food quality was good.
Prices are also on the higher side.

This place will lighten up your mood with its first look with all that bling . It's a spacious club thus Saturdays are less pushy and shovey here. The price of food and beverage is decent. I had this most pleasant experience on a weekday. One of their bartender made me and my friend few whisky sours and to my surprise every single time it had absolutely same taste. It can work on the music side though. All over its an awesome place. Do check it out.

Before entering the lounge the first thing the guard asks is if ur name is there in the guest list while there was no party going on inside? We had already booked a table so were saved from the embarrassment. And when we enter the place most of the table were empty.
Didnt like the ambiance at all music of pathetic with only transe being played by the dj.
Menu is limited to only 20 dishes or so. But the food quality was good.
Prices are also on the higher side. 
I woud not recommend anyone to visit.

First time clubbing in Kolkata. Well its open until 4 am and I along with my friend visited the place. First of all at 1 am there was a queue for vallet parking and it took us around 20 mins to give our car for vallet. The atmosphere at the entrance looked promising. Couple charges were 2000 INR out of which 1000 was redeemable and rest cover charges which we thought was baseless. But we wanted to try the place so we thought of giving it a chance. On entering the space was quite huge with people drinking and dancing on the floor. The turn off was the music. Expectation : english hi end pop Reality : hindi govinda songs. Although I wouldnt mind dancing in hindi numbers but somehow it wasnt going with the atmosphere. Stags were allowed too which was a turn off too, staring at women disgustingly. Overall I am not visiting here next but go try for yourself. Take a feeler with a couple of drinks and some moves!

Management is worst... we entered thinking its lounge.. there was no place as everything was reserved. We had no place to even keep our drinks on table. At the entry nothing was intimated . We came down to the counter and informed we have been told to stand near washroom , so kindly arrange for the place or refund the amount. The manager standing near the counter was so unethical he is showing his back and talking to us. We are requesting to refund the amount but not even talking to our face this guy showed his back. We decided to complain the gentleman from the lounge area stepped down and helped to get some space in lounge . Sad food and service is also bad

Poor service to say the least.! We ordered hookah and 3-4 drinks and guess what they don't change the coal for hookahs.! Order another for 600 approx.! Too less quantity for food given their price range.! Just in the name of ambience they're fooling.! Certainly won't come again.! And neither would advice anyone to go.! Why won't one go to the opposite foot in nocturne.!

Just next to my house, this place has already become a habit. The ambience is so much better than other clubs as it has good space to move around and chill. People aren't allowed to drink on the dance floor which makes it even better without any mess.Djs are good, food is great. My weekend is sorted. Thanks to Club Boudoir

I visited club boudoir in Dubai some 2 years back and was mesmerised by the music of DJ shadow. I wished we had something of that sort in kolkata. 
This is like the dream come true. Club Boudoir comes to the city of joy. 
The same feel the same ambiance and the same energy. Just loved everything there. Keep rocking the charts #Boudoir

One of the best in town, as for the clubbing ambience and experience goes. Music and lightings are fantastic. Very well located also.
The drinks and food are very expensive, and the service needs to be quick.
Surely such places neds to be visited once in a while.

The latest addition to kol nightline club boudoir aims to do things differently or thats wat message i got as i checked out this place . The sound and ambience is good and food also was good . My only worry is the same as in most nightline places the liqour . My single malt did not look what it shud have . Music was ok , nothing great . Looks like a lot of theme parties is wat is in store and cb will be on my visit again list soon !

Visited this lavish Dubai based club lounge on Diwali evening - one of the most happening lounge cum disc located at the crossing of  Shakespeare Sarani and Rowdon on the left corner if you are coming from Rawdon. Amazing ambience with great hospitality, staffs are very friendly. No doubt the cocktails are frightfully expensive than the 5 star bars. Ordered Vampire Kiss - martini based cocktail and prawn balls tossed in basil and lemon which tasted not only good but the portions are enough for 2 persons. The disc is open to the guests after 9 PM. Cost of one cocktail and an appetizer including taxes will come around 1.5K

Food - cant get worse. Ambience - cant get any worse. Drinks - Club serving less than promised liqour. We called the billing guy and the steward admitted that there was less alcohol than promised. To top it all The DJ Amit tonite - i think the worst DJ to have played in Cal by far. Please get rid of him asap. Talks too much. Wish there was a minus rating for the DJ. 

In all, the Clubbing experience if you come here, cant get any worse. Thats a relief. Since, wherever you go from here will be better.

In the heart of Kolkata comes Club Boudoir.. Extremely refreshing with mesmerising ambience.. Gives u an international clubbing experience.. Smoking skull drink a must try.. Rely tasty cocktail... Had few dishes like mini pizza, wraps and rolls,etc.. Quantity of the food is too less in comparison to its price hence makes the food expensive.. Need a more elaborate menu but definitely a must visit for all the music lovers.. A new experience altogether...

If you want to acquaint yourself with the nightlife of Kolkata you need to be here and boudoir will do all the rest. Have just returned from the opening of the club and am amazed at the excellent interiors, hospitality, comfort and safe partying destination that this place has to offer. Guys this place is a must visit.
