I am in love with this place. The decor is just so beautiful. This cute little cafe in New Alipore is my go to destination for spending some time with friends. The staff is extremely friendly and polite. The service is great. The prices are low and the food of course is very good. What more can someone ask for. My favorites are the cute colorful cupcakes and the shakes. The chicken sandwich is also nice..

Located in a corner of the quite lane, this place is a delight to visit. Its a small yet cosy place. Interiors are all nicely done and soothing pleasant to the eyes. I had a wonderful experience. Their pastries are heavenly. The other morning i went there and treated myself to a ferrero rocher pastry and an eggless choco truffle. The ferrero rocher was awesome. For my bday i ordered a 2 pound tiramisu cake. And oh my god, the cake was to die for. My best bday cake so far. Thank you Cocoa Bakery! I love you guys. Also, they delivered it at my place on time mentioned. The staff are quite friendly there and cater to all your needs and take care of all your worries. The place is perfect to visit with your loved ones or your friends or even your family. Light on the pocket too. Visit in for a guilty pleasure. I am yet to try the other stuffs on their menu. Eagerly waiting for that. Till then i give a thumbs up to this place and totally recommend you all to visit.
P.S : DO TRY THE TIRAMISU PASTRY!!!!! You won't regret. You can thank me later! :)
Love <3

Found in an hidden alley in New Alipore stood the bakery. A place common for gossip mongering over some delicious snacks. Sells bakery and beverages. Accepts pre order for wedding and birthday cakes etc. But has severe space crunch and the staff though courteous but takes too long to respond. Dimly lit. Not much popular among the college crowd. Oh yes but light on the pocket though.

The food is no doubt tasty. However, the serving is slow. We ordered a chicken and cheese sandwich, chicken tikka pattie, chicken burger, cheese omelette, cappuccino (vanilla) and cold coffee. All the savoury items were lip smacking. The bread was soft and fluffy. The stuffings were excellently cooked with all the right amount of spices and ingredients. The drinks were good too. Overall, this is a place which excel both at food and decor left alone the serving.

A small joint in an alley near Alipore, visited here on 21.10.2017.As the place was full we waited for the seats to be cleared, after 5 mins we got seated.the place is tiny,the staff is corteous and the ambience is soothing.we ordered: - 
1.chicken cheese burger 
This came with fries and onion rings.The buger was ok in taste.The fries and onion rings were too good.
2.grilled chicken sandwich 
This was to die for, probably the best grilled chicken sandwich i have ever tasted.It was too tasty,came with fries and salad,which were again good. 
3.Black forest Pastry 
The pastry was moist and was very good in taste.Perfect balance of sweetness. 
4.truffle pastry 
The pastry was also too good and i enjoyed it.Really recommended.
Serving took around 20 mins, and the staff was very friendly, will visit again.

The decor is nice..the place is small.. they could really increase the no. of seats..there are hardly 5 tables..anyway..Diwali is right around the corner..so the bakery people are busy taking Diwali orders..I completely understand..but who ignores customers like this? We are sitting there for almost 7 minutes.. right in front of the waiters and no one even hands over a menu card..we get it after asking for it..we ordered a chicken burger and a mud pie..they took some time before serving the food..the burger was okay..but the mud pie was quite good..I recommend the mudpie..the prices are fine..I don't think I will be going back..but this place is cozy and u can go and check it out..the rating I have given is for the mudpie and ambience.

I think the rating for this one should be obsolete because I've never evermy life been to a cafe where customers are so ignored. The stop at this cafe was random and short and among all the eat out places in the area, I chose this because it was highly recommended by a friend. I understand that cafes can be busy, but t does not justify having to tell the person twice to clean up the mess of the customer before me. After sitting for almost 10 minutes, and several "excuse me, can I please have the menu", I had to go over to the main counter and literally scavenge for a menu card myself. After that episode,  there was not one soul who even bothered to ask foe water or the order, even though there were people actively pacing the cafe. Sometime into the order, I get up to ask if it has already been made, and if not, to cancel it. I did not get any respinse for 10 minutes other than we're checking. Till then other customers were well attended with proper manners and offers. The white suace pasta was parceled and handed over without any spoons, without any tisshe papers and when I asked for these, I was given the weirdedt most rude look one can ever expect from such a reputed place. All in all, this was one terrible experience. And nothing personal here, but as an avid cafe go-er, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE BECAUSE OF THE SHEER RUDENESS AND CALLOUSNESS THAT GOES AROUND.

Being honest here..
You won't notice this place unless you are looking for it as it is kinda hidden from the distracted eye.
I visited this place couple of weeks back and it was a satisfactory experience in my part.
Food: Delicious and well prepared along with an amazing representation.
Even though the food is tasty and the menu they provide will be enough for most, but if you are looking for the literal meaning of the name of the place then you will not be overly amused.
The other thing is what ever you order , the items on the menu are a bit overpriced but if you take the quality and the ambiance of the place into consideration then I would say it is worth it for a enjoyable evening.
Service - Service of the staff is quite prompt but the only problem they face is the lack of space inside the eatery.
(A great place for a first date)

It's a small cafe tucked in a quiet corner along the road. The ambience is soothing with large glass windows and soft light. However, I noticed something very disturbing. There were people continuously entering and exiting the place who were definitely not customers. It was noisy and uncomfortable. However,the food was good and the quantity was even better. We had gone for breakfast and had ordered : 

1. Lychee mojito : This was refreshing but tasted like an ordinary mojito. The flavour of lychee was hardly felt!

2. Cafe latte : Decent coffee. The presentation was pleasant. 

3. Chicken and cheese grilled sandwich : Two big sandwiches with a generous filling of chicken and cheese, served with fries and coleslaw. It tasted good and was crispy.

4. Herbs Chicken crepe : It was so filling that we couldn't finish it. Very cheesy and tasty ; this is a recommendation.

Ordered an eggless cake lat night from swiggy, I expected the cake to be of a better quality , I am generally not disappointed with the bakery's I order but the cake was not at all good,it was a bit salty, I don't know if it was the cream that was salty, or was it because of the eggless part.

I haven't been to the shop in person but have ordered through Swiggy. I really love there patties, how fluffy and crunchy they are. The filling inside is also good and tasty. I usually order the chicken tikka patty and veg patty and both are tasty. In pastries I usually order the black forest slice, nut corners and opera pastry. Opera pastry is just too good and even rest two were good too. But the opera one is brilliant.

A nice place to hang out. We did not order much. My friend ordered tea and me brownie with vanilla ice cream (which was yummmm). They have an interesting menu and surely visit again to try out other stuffs.

A small cosy place that welcomes you with variety of food options. I have visited this placed many times with friends to have small talks. They make really good sandwiches! You would lot of options in the dessert section as well. But I personally did not find some items like the blueberry cheese cake appealing at all. You may try out some cakes from their bakery for Birthday parties. They also have a display section for different breads and subs which you may buy for consumption at home. The Service typically takes 10 to 15 mins on a normal day. Staff is cordial. Also a good recommendation for those who want to spent some time alone and enjoy a cup of coffee with not too much of a disturbance.

Okay now I am forced to review this. I usually order pastriesand desserts from here and no doubt they are delicious. I finally decided to visit this cafe. I sat down inside and one guy told me to move to another table as it was booked. I got up and moved to another table in the corner. I had to asked for the menu after realising that I won't get it until I ask for it. After sitting there for 15-20 mins I realised that nobody is bothered about me much. They did not even come to take my order and the café wasn't even crowded. And I left without having anything. Today I ordered 2 lemon tarts online but I got only 1 tart instead of 2. 

Please improve your service. Food alone isn't enough. 🙏

It's a lovely place to go for a soothing,chillaxing(as they say) evening with light snacks,tranquil drinks and some of the most delicious food as well as bakery items available in Kolkata.
Had visited their Minto Park outlet, which I found to be far more attractive and comfortable in terms of size as well as ambience(though even that is pretty small).The service here is extremely nice and pretty quick.Ambience is excellent for relaxing your day-long tired brains.All in all,a wonderful atmosphere but it's just a bit congested.

Coming to the food... We ordered -

* Grilled Chicken with Parsley Rice - it was simply awesome...the combination worked wonders with the boiled vegetables adding to the sensational stimuli on the taste buds.

* Chicken Penne Pasta - Was well-made and delicious(just a tad bit oily).

* Brownie in bowl - You just HAVE TO TRY THIS !! One of the best desserts I have had in a while.The all-so creamy layer of chocolate sauce with the soft, smooth brownie stuffed inside a bowl, was simply a delight and a perfect end to our small yet yummalicious meal time !

Do give it a try !! :)
(if not the food,then for the bakery items.I have had a few & they are simply worth it)

Next day when I go to complain, I am told that it is impossible and I should have carried back atleast a slice of it to prove my authenticity. #Outrageous #Flabbergasted #Downright Insulting.

I got them to make a cake for our tenth wedding anniversary and they did an absolutely fantastic job. The order process is very simple and there is a lot of interaction in deciding the design of the cake. We chose the chocolate truffle cake for our cake and then the design was as per our specifications. The design was spot on and the cake tasted as good as it looked. i will definitely re-order whenever i need cakes for future occasions. we have ordered from them various times and they have never let us down.

This small cafe' (more like an eatery) is tucked away in the maze of bylanes in New Alipore. A bit troublesome to find it since it's a blink and you miss! The indoor area is very small and clumsy. The place is mostly frequented by the locals (due to it's location). 

Coming to it's food section, they serve the typical fare which one expects from a cafe. I ordered a Mocha (a type of coffee) and with it a Grilled Chicken Sandwich while my friend ordered a cup of tea. Mocha tasted fine. But the letdown was the sandwich. It tasted bland! My friend didn't complain about the tea though! 

All in all, this place is not recommended as it has nothing special about it. It takes a lot of time to place an order here. And moreover the claustrophobic seating area is a letdown at peak hours!

Picked up a #Mixed Fruit Gateau Cake on Monday evening for a friend's Birthday. Post dinner when the cake was cut, turns out to be sour & stale. Next day when I go to complain, I am told that it is impossible and I should have carried back atleast a slice of it to prove my authenticity. #Outrageous #Flabbergasted #Downright Insulting.

I got them to make a cake for our tenth wedding anniversary and they did an absolutely fantastic job. The order process is very simple and there is a lot of interaction in deciding the design of the cake. We chose the chocolate truffle cake for our cake and then the design was as per our specifications. The design was spot on and the cake tasted as good as it looked. i will definitely re-order whenever i need cakes for future occasions. we have ordered from them various times and they have never let us down.

Chicken nuggets were tasteless 
Crossaints were stale too

For this week's culinary adventure, we chose to go beyond our usual Gariahat-Golpark belt - to New Alipore. Located opposite Cafe Coffee Day, in a wide by lane, this outlet is known most for it's custom cakes. It is a small, quaint place - looks like one of those European roadside cafes - and on display is a collection of fruit cakes, cookies, home made chocolates, croissants, cupcakes and so on...

We ordered Iced Coffee and Cold Coffee to start with - the service was a little slow, but no complaints with the taste. I followed it up with a favorite of mine - Baked Beans on Toast, as well as a Chicken Omelette (served with thick French Fries, the kind I love best). The portion size was slightly smaller than expected, but again, quite delicious. Hubby ordered a Chicken Steak with Herbed Rice, and it was surprisingly delicious. The vegetables were perfectly sauteed, the rice was delectable, and the chicken sauce was yummy! 

Was eyeing the nutty eclairs, choco chip muffins and lemon cake slices, but the ice cream devoured last night sent me on a guilt trip, so gave it a miss this time. Will be back for dessert next time.

Damn happy girl, I am! :)

I went last evening for coffee with some friends. Well all girls love to relax and chill on a coffee date with girls . But surely this is NOT the place. First we were asked by the very aged manager mr singh not to laugh loudly. I bet he doesn't know how to himself. Then we were told that other people are waiting so please leave. REALLY!!! Well if we go to a cafe and there is no place we either leave or wait. You cannot tell a customer to leave. NEVER. Unless the place is shutting down for the day. 
So the point is if u need a quick coffee then ok. To relax and enjoy please DO NOT GO HERE !!!

You can choose to go a little extravagant or not depending on your pocket. This place has it all.

Try out their chicken and egg sandwich. It is yum! Their different pastries are also delicious. Give the chocolate caramel tart and the macaroons a shot.

You can also get sweet gifts for occasions in lovely little boxes.

The best part is that the price on the menu card is inclusive of all taxes..I would love to visit this place again..

It took me a bit of time to find this small food joint in New Alipore. Entering the place, I was welcomed by the wide array of muffins and cupcakes. I managed to take some of the snaps by taking permission from the management team. The ambience was absolutely cool and romantic one. Coming to menu, we ordered Pastries and sandwich
(I don't remember the name :p). To be honest, I was not at all enthralled by the flavor.
It was frozen and had gritty crystals of ice.
It's not basically tad bad but it's not a good option too..

Desserts are pretty awesome in taste, decor is pretty well with all fondant cakes for displays. The only things that pinches is the place area is really small so sometimes you have to wait to get any table. Red Velvet Pastry and Chocolate Truffle tastes fab.

If you are a dweller nearby r alipore and not in a mood to cook breakfast.. Cocoa bakery is the place you need to hop in to! They dont have sausages on the menu, but request them and they make it so amazingly well, its a delight to your tastebuds. The sausages are cooked with caramelised onions. One of the best cold coffee​ in town, a little bitter that is not over powering at all.. The perfect blend​ of sugar and coffee,  a rare thing to find in the land of sweetmeat lovers! The garlic bread toast was oh so fresh and the chicken omellete was a favourite too! The Sunday breakfast buffet is what i am looking forward to!

Ok, I've been to this place a while back, how did I forget to review it, is beyond me!
Anyhow, I'm not gonna write much about a place where I have been a while back but to be crisp n short , it's nice little quaint looking place located in the bylane opposite to the newalipore CCD.
The interior is rustic yet tastefully done. My wife & I were on probation from eating outside so we kept it neat during our visit. She ordered a grilled chicken wrap , Irish coffee and I settled for a chicken pasta in arrabiata sauce.
As far as I remember the service was slow. 1st came in the coffee followed by the wrap n pasta. The coffee was good as informed by her. I had a bit of the wrap, it was nice, roasted in a bit of ghee and chicken grilled perfectly. The pasta was usual, a bit sweet and strong flavour of tomato more than wat usually is for the arrabiata sauce. 
Overall we enjoyed it. Nice place to hangout on a lazy weekend evening.

Ps cost is abt 600 for 2 ppl

A small bakery shop located in the by lanes of new alipore near bidya bharati girls high school and in the lane opposite to CCD (new alipore), it is a fantastic place to be in. The decor is quite splendid altough it is very small place. The food is excellent. We have been here twice.
On our first visit we ordered chocolate mousse boat and chocolate truffle slice. Both the items were excellent. 
On the second visit we ordered chocolate pastry, iced coffee and suba noodle soup(non veg).They were very good indeed. 
The prices are more or less reasonable. One cannot miss this place if nearby. Looking forward to visit again.

A regular evening place to sit and have coffee and dinner with friends and family. Good food, great pricing. The chicken wings , pastas, Tomato and Basil soup, stroganoff are quite impressive. Don't expect a super service.  You get what you pay for.

Hey Foodies, 
Hope you all are doing good😊 
So, there's this place called "Cocoa Bakery" in New Alipore, kolkata located in just the opposite lane of CCD. 
Its a bakery cum cafe and must say the place is so nicely decorated and organised❤️. The service is really good and plus the ambience. 
This place is surely a delight for all the dessert lovers out there. 
I have visited this place a few months ago and this time I opted for home delivery. 
The service was really good and the delivery was on time. 
So, I ordered the mudpie ( its kind of a chocolate pie in a bowl filled with chocolate, choco chips and vanilla chips) and truffle pastry which was for Rs.100/- & Rs.50/- respectively. 
It was really good. I love almost all the things that I've tried till now from this place. 
I'll surely recommend this place to everyone👍🏻. Those of you who've already visited this place do let me know your experience😌.

Once i ordered a 1lb chocolate cake from this cafe located at new alipur. quite difficult to locate actually. As it was durga puja going and no bakery would deliver at home so i ordered the birthday cake via zomato. Honestly no chocolatey flavour, salty a bit but well decorated , packing charge was unsually high about 20 bucks just a box.. it was ok ok stuff. Another day i ordered chicken pasta via swiggy but they sent me veg pasta . When i complained they refused the allegations. Pasta was dry and there were microscopic pieces of carrot and veggies so small that i could not even understand what they were. But there 30rs per pc chocolate pastry was good once i ordered 10pcs of them. But the 300rs same chocolate cake was average. I think they are not constant in their service.

The quality of their product is very good. They bake all of their items themselves.  That's the best part. Mis fruit pudding is the best. The others are good too.. I mean really good. But the mid fruit pudding is just like my taste. 😊. I had a wonderful time 😊. The price is also reasonable 😄

Coca bakery is a small but a very well done up place. Visited this place for brunch on a Sunday morning. Since we had reservation, getting a place wasn't a problem. 
The patties here is very good. Special mention should be made of the chicken tikka and chicken envelope patties. One of the best I have had. 
Apart from this we had ordered the chicken burger and chicken sandwich it was ordinary. The portion was enough for one person.
Coming to the drinks all of us opted for hot chocolate, it wasn't great.
What stole the show were the pastries and tarts. We tried a number of them, from the macaroons to the chocolate tarts. Everything was excellent. If you have a sweet tooth you must visit this place. 
Overall it was a good experience.

Many cafes and coffee parlours are there in my locality but I'm blessed to have Cocoa Bakery. Their burgers are tasty and filling. The chocolate brownie is a must try. I've tried almost all the dishes from the menu. Though the quantity is less for most of the dishes compared to the price and the service slow. It's a small cafe and cannot occupy many people but I'm sure one will make good memories while playing board games( which you have to carry).
Cheese and spinach quesadillas served with salsa dip is yummy. 
Didn't like the veg French onion soup. But the cheese bread dipped in it was yum. 
Chocolate 🍩 is okayish

Cocoa Bakery , located in the central and posh area of New Alipore just to the opposite lane of Cafe Coffee Day, is a small bakery Cafe which is a heaven for dessert lovers .The ambience is soothing with dim lights and soft music always up their sleeves.The cafe is a delight for dessert lovers and is loved by everyone .Priced moderately the place attracts people from far .
The highlights of the restaurant are Brownie in a bowl at 100 bucks and 
Mudpie at 110. There's a special dessert up their menu known as the Chocolate Surprise which leaves you in awe when you see it being prepared right in front of your eyes and molten chocolate all over .The cafe also has a specialized cookie counter where you get cookies and hand made chocolates.During Diwali they have a special variety of sweets and chocolate boxes which is hard to resist.

The cafe is small and at times handling the rush becomes tough for them so they should work on it.

The hospitality and the dignity of the cafe should always be retained.
One should always go back to Cocoa Bakery for their mouth watering desserts and ambience.

If we are in huge in number the place might be a problem during the rush hours.
Overall Cocoa Bakery is a friendly place and it can be visited by everyone.
Happy Eating :D

It's a small cute little cafe. Feels very crowded if all tables are filled. We ordered Chicken cheese Sandwich, bruschetta, mushroom and spinach crepes and corn and spinach crepes. The crepes were amazing drowned in mountains of cheese 😍. The sandwich was okay, the chicken layer was very thin and felt more like a cheese sandwich. The bruschetta was regular and was served cold which killed the taste. Apart from this we ordered a cold coffee, dark mocha coffee, banana caramel shake and brownie shake. Everything was extremely sweet and hence while ordering do mention no added sugar because they use flavour pulp which itself is very sweet. The cupcakes were average in taste

Its a small outlet located in posh Alipore area. Very near to CCD and Dominos. The place is designed well and seem very very pretty. But then the good things end there. When we went there, a group of ladies continued to talk aloud which did make it look more like their dining room rather than a bakery. No attendant came in to take order for good amount of time which kept me wondering if it's self service. We tried sandwiches and coffee. Coffee was good but sandwiches were just OK. Nothing really great about it.  May be their pastry and other bakery products are good. I have heard their bakery does supply to many hotels and restaurants in the nearby area, so everything seemed fresh.

Small in size but beautiful interior wise.

Food - Chicken tikka Pattie: its a not so small puff but with a good amount of filling. I liked its flaky, crispy texture on the outside.

Exotic corn puff: Small round shaped, there was nothing exotic about this puff. The filling was less as well.

Baked veg Florentine: A bed of spinach at the bottom, exotic veggies like broccoli, zucchini, etc were cooked in white sauce & cheese & freshly baked with a golden layer on top. This gave out a really good taste. I had to order garlic bread separately with this.

Red Velvet Milk shake : Fresh and amazing. One could feel the granules of red velvet cake in the milkshake as you take a sip it. The glass bottle in which the shake was served seemed huge too. A must try!

Swiss roll: It was one of the best swiss rolls I have ever had. Soft on the outside, the chocolate coating on the outside made it drooling. It wasn't too sweet as well.

Mix fruit pudding: A mixture of cake, cream & fresh fruits like kiwis, strawberries etc. This is less sweet & perfect if u want to try something other than chocolate.

Ambience: It was a cute little cafe with a few tables & chairs. One part was dimly lit & other part was well lit.

Hospitality: The staff was courteous and attentive to our needs.

Overall experience: They excel in the kind of desserts they provide be it huge cakes or small pastries. Do not leave their cafe without trying their desserts which are droolworthy & reasonably priced too. Also, they are known for their freshly baked breads.

Cocoa Bakery's located in New Alipore, its on the opposite lane of CCD and Cakes 📍
Opted here today for breakfast with my hubby and man it was a worth visit ..! Be it their service, be it the foods - everything was perfect 👌
Small place yet not tiny or cram full. It's Pocket friendly bakery comes with cafe. Sitting arrangements done such beautiful way so no one can overhear your conversation while you gossip over your coffee and foods 🙌  I liked their background music same time 🎶 
Foods we had here are : Toast with butter, Chicken sausages, Chocolate cornflakes with milk, Veg Sandwiches, Cakes, Masala omelettes, Coffee, some other savories I can't recall the name! I found egg shells while munching the omelette and the coffee was poor kind sadly! They can improve in this by providing good coffees on coffee cup instead of small glasses!! Rest of foods were fresh and tested good! Chicken sausages were worth having 😋
Service was good and courteous, couldn't be better! 

All inclusive Tax and vat 
Foods : 4/5
Service : 4/5

Hope you find it helpful! 😁

I am a true fan of this awesome place.They are the best! All our celebrations necessarily include their indulgent cakes.They customize your cake so nicely that you cannot ask for anything more but wish for a larger size! The cream they give is pure blissfully buttery and it's recommended that you keep the cake refrigerated.Thanks for being there in my vicinity.

Its true that being in Kolkata, where now a days, new bakeries and cafes are opening in every nook and corner, its hard to find the right one. And by right one i dont mean the big, flashy and crowded kind, but rather a one that's small, cosy, quaint and above all, serves great food.

I have been a regular at Cocoa Bakery for some time now, and I love their service, be it at the cafe or home delivery. Its tucked away in a small lane in New Alipore, away from the noisy traffic and crowded CCD nearby, but you must visit here to try their pastries, pasta or even salads.
The pastries which are most try are
1. Brownie in a Bowl: a dense brownie served in a bowl, set in rich molten chocolate poured. Ask the waiter to heat this up slightly, so that the liquid chocolate melts a little. Divine!
2. Tiramisu Pastry: Its better than the Tiramisu cakes available else where. This one actually has a whipped cream topping, which has been torched. This gives a nice bitter coffee like flavour to this one. I Love it!
3. Chocolate Caramel Tart: Sinful. The chocolate cream and caramel are beautifully married together!
4. Chocolate Muffins: Its one of the best ones I have tasted recently. Heavily laden with choco chips, the mufgin itself is light and fluffy, with rich chocolate flavour.
5. Chicken Ceaser Salad: This was ok, not as good as their pastries.

Also you can try their brown bread, if you are tired of the market ones. That's a winner too.

This place is located just inside the lane opposite side of CCD new Alipore. The lane which leads to Udayan Club.
It's not a very known place of Kolkata but I love it's food. 
It's a small place with sitting area for just a few people, but the food has some good quality. 
For every occasions, I order cake from this place only. Same order for every birthday occassion isTruffle chocolate cake.
Italian is really nice. If you want spend some quality time with small groups then this is the right place.

Came here with my sister on Republic Day post lunch to have some desserts. It's a pretty quaint cafe from outside and the décor I side is pretty cool. The place is really small compared to what it seemed from the pictures on Zomato and the furniture needs a recovery really soon as many of the sofas are torn.
On entering, the colourful array of chocolates, brownies, pastries and other goodies attracted me and I started clicking with due permission of the management. But one part of them were actually impolite and explicitly expressed their disgust when I said I was doing that due permission of the management.
Next comes food. We had -
Vanilla Macaroon - Pink coloured crust filled with rich vanilla cream inside. The cream was delicious but the crust could have been better in taste.
Tiramisu Pastry - This pastry version of Italian classic is my absolute favourite and I never miss a chance to try out this. Alas! The pastry was actually frozen inside. I guess there was some problem in the preservation and the mascarpone cheese tasted really bitter. We finished it as it was pretty expensive but it would have been better without.
Won't recommend this place. May come again if I pass nearby for trying out the chocolate based desserts as they have been gladly praised by my foodie friends. Otherwise, never again. Happy Dining! :)

A cosy little place near my place of residence, the Coco bakery is a true delight....
Right from the amazing craftsmanship towards baked items (especially the cakes.....they will make you anything just choose the design) to a customer oriented staff this place can give a tough competition to bigger bakeries and bake shops at five stars (mind you am from hotel industry myself)
The Sunday breakfast is almost a routine for me now or a ritual where I get some my time while enjoying my lovely breakfast. Limited but good choices of items for a single person like me who is struggling to get up and prepare breakfast in morning is like a blessing in disguise.
I would especially mention Mr. Rajesh and Mr. Partho who greet me with a smile and make me feel at home and know my choices so well that things are on table before even having to ask for it. A special thanks to them.
I would also like to mention that m more of a savoury loving person and hardly ever go for sweet stuff but when it comes to Coco bakery I will have anything with my eyes closed coz I know it would be delicious.
Ever since one of my friend made me try a cake from the bakery there has been no turning back.
I would conclude with the fact that I love this place and would miss it long after I have left Kolkata

One of the worst place I have visited.. THEY suggested us to try chocolate ganache which was not only bad in taste but was HARD like a rock ... after we left we suffered from nausea... which spoiled the rest of the day ...not only the food was bad but they charged us extra... we ordered one scoop of ice cream they charged us for two(which after telling they refunded) and when I rechecked the bill once I was home .. I saw the premium muffin which we bought was of Rs. 80 but they charged us with Rs. 90...a very bad place to visit .. #waste of money #bad experience #worst place

I have been to this place a couple of times. The place might be small but it still is well decorated. Their desserts are usually on point. But what bowled me over was their french fries. The brownie shake was amazing and so was the mud cake. The veg sandwich was good but nothing special. overall a good place to just hang out with your friend.

We ordered a eggless truffle cake from this place on the eve of christmas and all thanks to them for delivering it to us at such a short notice.They have a huge variety in bakery products and we found them relatively cheap compared to many existing brands.The taste of the truffle was quite regular and it was delivered fresh.

It's a very cozy and cute little bakery located in the most posh area of Kolkata. The ambience is soothing. I ordered their red velvet pastry worth Rs. 100 and wasn't really satisfied, it was utterly sweet but the Ferrero Rocher eggless chocolate pastry was delightful. However, a good place for small chills.

Good Food for a small bakery. The risotto is outstanding, and specially the breakfast here is something I have a good feel about. The Red Velvet cake is a Big Turn off. Mushroom Risotto, omlets are the icing on the cake. The customised cakes are good but not very accurate to what they make.

Gist : Best Breakfast Buffet @ INR 275. Great ambience in a small place. Must visit place for a foodie couple.

I have visited this place on 18.12.16 at 9.30AM. Easy to found. Decor was good. They were playing music also. Total seats are 2+2+3+3+a lounge. Washroom is inside the kitchen and clean. There was only 1 staff at first later it was 2 but still prompt. Buffet items kept aside but without marking so have to ask for which items are where. Staff are very helpful but need to ask us what we require instead we instruct them most of the time. Cake slice, sausage and sandwich was great. Expected the juice to be far thicker but mill and coffee are great. Veg cutlet is outstanding , small in size but very crunchy. Omelet was great, bit spicy, bit oily, bit salty. Just this item alone needs an appraisal. Bread, crossiants are good but not great. Missed baked beans , cereals and pastries to eat. Overall experience is good enough for more visits and recommendation to all my friends.

I visited this place with a friend on a Sunday evening.This quaint little cafe is located in the bylanes of new alipore.The decor represents that of small European bistro.Ambience is very romantic and cosy.

We took a table for two by the corner.We came for some light eats hence ordered things over the counter in the patisserie section.From the savouries our pick was mutton patty and chicken quiche.

•Mutton patty-The minced mutton filling was really delicious.It was spicy which I liked a lot.The puff pastry on the outside needs work though.It wasn't that flaky and was bit too oily.

•Chicken quiche-This was better.The pastry that makes the pie base had a golden brown hue,flaky,thin with a nice crunch.The filling was cheesy with chunks of chicken in it and bits of veggies.

For desserts we chose chocolate pastry and mousse boat.

•Chocolate pastry-The chocolate ganache glaze on top of the cake was shiny,dark.. which is a sign of a good ganache.The cake was moist.It tasted very good.It was priced just at INR 30..but quality wasn't compromised even then.

•Mousse boat-Here chocolate mousse was served in a boat shaped tart shell.The mousse was had such a rich chocolatey flavour with a brilliant smoothness and light airy feel.The crunch from the flaky,shortcrust base gave this dessert a nice texture.

Service was a bit slow but one can be fine with it when you come here for a lazy time with friends for chitchat over some light snacks.Can be a problem for guests who'll cone for proper dining.Servers were efficient and polite.Will surely come back again.

Really very impressed with the quality of products they offer here, the menu ranges on all sections of bakery including cupcakes , dry cakes , pastries , breads ,muffins, cookies , celebration cakes (i was drooling over them) and savouries ; plus a kitchen serving wonderfully cooked crepes , grilled sandwiches , burgers , pastas and main courses .
The prices given here in zomato have to be upgarded as i found some markable increase.
After a lot of this and that , chose HERB CHICKEN CREPE that was heavenly for a cheese sucker like me. The CHICKEN QUICHE was nice one.RED VELVET CAKE was one red slice of pure love and the most indulging was the sinful MUDPIE. Our cups of CUPPACCINO and MOCHA came after a lag , infact here i must say the staff are very friendly and polite but they need to be more attentive. The decor of the place done in warm shades giving a very cozy and comfortable feeling once you are in. The sitting capacity is restricted to 2 tables for two , 2 tables for three and 1 for group of 6-7 pax. The pricing is all inclusive , hence pocket friendly.
Great spot for birthday celebrations and quick catch ups , a visit to COCOA Bakery can not be missed.

Cocoa Bakery was stayed around 5 months in my wishlist and finally I went three days ago.

▪Located at the near to the New Alipore crossing.

▪Place was big, seating arrangements are nice and spacious. Ambiance was good.

▪Mocktails - Kulfi Shake was too sweet and I cannot bear that. Dark mocha was good.

▪Grilled Chicken Salad is nonetheless a simple salad with no chicken or you can barely find a piece. Tasteless.

▪Cheese Chicken Sandwich was nice.

▪Chocolate mud pie and muffin was not fresh and too sweet.

I have been to this place 2-3 times.. found the ambience to be quiet nice and the food is also pretty good although many of the items mentioned on the menu are not available at times... 

My experience with this place has been average except for the last time when we were served chicken pasta instead of the veg pasta ordered! It was irritating as the waiter had re-confirmed with us if we wanted veg pasta or non-veg...even after that such negligence on part of the staff was uncalled for.. I think the service would be a huge thumbs down for this place... And to all vegetarians visiting this place, guys be careful!

It's an absolutely delightful bakery and cozy cafe for delicious pastries,cakes or a cup of good coffee!
Dark chocolate cake is highly recommended. Also,brownie and mousse hit the top 5 on my list. I like their coffee- be it Americano or cappuccino or mocha. Even the dark mocha from cold coffee section tastes real good!

A word of caution for their hot chocolate or spaghetti aglio oglio, though.Also, seats are limited so it is not really a place where one can look forward to uninterrupted hours of gossip/chilling out. However,prices are suitable for the quality of food offered.
I'm a regular at Cocoa for their hot coffee & dark chocolate pastries! Looking forward to my next visit anyday now 😁

Cool place to visit for a snack, with nice ambience and modern setup - well, we sort of take it for granted such things ought to be presented whenever a new place opens up. But I am going to give a special round of applause for their interior design and setup. 

But I was disappointed at the end of my visit, because ultimately one needs to serve really good food/drink to satisfy their customers. Yet that was missing, mainly because their preparations has been grossly being modified against the name they are being sold on their counter. 
We ordered a host of dishes ranging from omelets to Swiss roll to burgers to pastries to focaccia and crepes. But their customization to these vintage dishes did ruin everything. 
Hoping the management would take note of these and restore them to their original best and keep their customized offerings on an different menu.

post my arrival on 23/10 morning for a breakfast, i had to wait for 15-20 mins before somebody came to take down my order.
and then the order arrived 30 mins later, only the hot chocolate came in a little lesser time.
Considering the price of a cheese omelette the quantity was not good enough and the filling was not satisfying where as the chocolate pancake was very good in taste and the rating goes to 3 only for the pancakes alone.....the environment is nice also

1)ambience,decor-a 4.5/5 because of the lovely decor and the comfortable environment that gives a very homely feeling.the host was courteous too.the photos in frames on the walls,and the packaged goodies look super cute.and sitting amidst them is an absolute beautiful feeling.
2)food-we ordered a chocolate boat,mud pie,cold coffee and hot chocolate.
           the mud pie is sumthing heavenly and one of the best things that i have tasted ever,the chocolate boat was okayish,wirh solid chocolate coating outside and a bit hard to break with a spoon.the cold coffee is one of the best cold coffees i've ever tasted,but the hot chocolate was a huge disappointment.it was thin and tasted like bourn vita.
the pricing is a bit on the higher side,but given the time we spent there,it was worth the money.
thank you.

On reading the positive reviews I was very excited to visit the cocoa bakery with my friends to try the cakes they have. The ambience was really nice. We ordered a red velvet cheesecake, blueberry cheesecake pudding and cold coffee. We had to wait for almost an hour for the cake which we did not mind as its a good place to spend time with friends chatting. But, I was really disappointed after having the cake. It wasn't fresh at all. Not soft either!! Then came the blueberry cheesecake pudding which was comparatively better but not as it should have been. The cold coffee was the only item worth having. And the service wasn't good either. Overall experience was really bad!!!

Ok... its very close to my place and the only place closeby that has donuts!!!!(oh the heavenly donuts.... thou art missed in kolkata) can someone open an mod outlet here pls???? 
Coming back to cocoa bakery, the donuts are okish i guess... the nutells filled one is good. The cupcakes are pretty... and taste good too.... tried the red velvet.
The red velvet pastry is super fantabulously amazing... so soft it melts in your mouth and u wish u had the full cake instead of the small piece and you could eat all of it... n want more!  Yeah...
Have ordered the creme brulee and the choco mousse... wchich is featured in the recommended dessert section on online zomato order. Creme brulee didnt like so much.... but the mousse was good.
Coming to their sunday brunch, i really liked it.... the croissant and the rest ok, the veg sandwich good and the cake slices heavenly.... i think it was freshly baked and super soft to eat... even after the full brunch and everthing, i ate 2 full slices... 
The best thing about this bakery is the coffee though! 
Its perfect! I have tried a lot of places, I declare it to be the best in kolkata.
Yeah... i did not eat all of this in one go.... ordered some ate some packed some for later use. Wl definitely go for the coffee and red velvet agn!

This place in new alipore is easy to locate. It's in the lane opposite to cafe coffee day. You have to be careful what you choose to eat here.....we had ordered the cheese chicken spaghetti, green apple virgin mohito, mudpie and creme burlee. The spaghetti and mudpie was out of the world...very yummy. But virgin mohito was a bummer and I hated the creme burlee. I even bought a loaf of multi grain bread from here since it's a bakery. The bread is of good quality and reasonable price. Overall i am definitely satisfied and will go back. They can increase the seating though.... people had to come wait for seats because seating is very less. Ambience is very cozy. Staff is courteous but service a tad bit slow but great quality of food makes up for all those shortcomings.

This is my all time favorite for desserts...intense in flavor and visually spectacular, their petit desserts can accommodate all of your affairs...taste buds. The delicacies combine traditional pastry with an innovative use of fresh fruits, chocolate mousse cake which has an exquisite taste...and every dessert here makes me drool for another visit... Indeed a great bakery with innovative ideas and wonderful chefs !!!

Very good food. Their macaroons are really good. The staff is also very helpful. Though cakes is just opposite this place, cocoa bakery gives cakes a run for its money.

I went to cocoa bakery to have breakfast with a friend on his birthday. They had a nano buffet laid out, which was very cute. But we settled in for sandwiches, which were better than what I was expecting. The staff were extremely slow with the orders (as it only took them them an hour to get us our coffees. And the birthday cake had this hair in it, which the staff promptly took back and replaced with a fresh cake. However the new cake was frozen solid and it took the two of us all our strength to cut trough a millimetre of that cake. This place could have been better organised.

Excellent quaint little cafe in new alipore. My friend is a fan so we planned a visit. It's a small place and seating is a bit odd but the ambience is pretty nice and so is the menu. 
We tried their coffee, quiche, spaghetti, grilled chicken, omelette and some desserts. All were excellent except the omelette. Service is a bit slow but sometimes the food is so great that you don't even mind it.

Third time here. This small, cozy well done up cafe cum bakery offers a very well chalked out menu. Everything I've tried in the menu is absolutely delicious. We tried the herb and chicken crêpe and the grilled chicken in wine sauce. The crêpe was perfectly baked and was generously loaded with cheese. This is a must try. The wine sauce was finger licking good. I would have hoped for an accompaniment of breads or mashed potatoes with the chicken though. Gives a more wholesome feel. We followed this with crème brulee which was topped with kiwis, apricots and plums. The best I've had. All the prices stated in the menu are very reasonable and are inclusive of taxes. Service was a bit slow but the waiters were extremely amicable.

Nice ambiance. Service delayed. However the items are worth the wait. We went there for a simple dessert but go spellbound by their brownie bowl which is served warm with a scoop of ice cream added.
The staffs are good and price is okay.

I have been there twice and both the times at evening.. So the place looks good, its small but they have managed good seating.. I just feel the price of food there is quite more than other bakery shop like rouge, paris cafe and all! 
The food was okay.. The first visit I had better food experience and then the second time, I haven't had the same taste! But its good.. If you are a foodie and likes to explore different places. This could be a good experience.

Probably one of the most overrated bakeries in town. DO NOT GO THERE OR PREPARE TO GET "MUGGED".

STAFF: LYING THIEVES. At first I was told that the chocolate truffle cake on display was Rs.440. There were two cakes and the price tag was placed in middle of them -Rs. 440. The man told me that he would be charging me Rs.880 for 2 pounds. When the order came around I was shocked to see I WAS CHARGED RS.1600. When I asked them they simply said they charge Rs.850 per pound and this was not Rs. 440 but Rs. 880. LYING PIECES OF SHIT!

FOOD: The cake was not upto the mark. AND I WAS NOT EVEN ASKED WHETHER I WANTED IT EGGLESS OR NOT.
The Ice Tea was was more ice and less tea- the WORST ICE TEA I EVER HAD!

BILL: Rs. 1700.

THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE IF YOU WANT TO GET WILLINGLY MUGGED!

I have always had a great experience at this place. But yesterday I purchased 2 breads and 3 muffins for my family and it was a complete disaster. The muffins were horrible as soon as we took a bite in to it we were hit by a smell of bagon spray or something. My mom ended up puking. If a cafe starts doing things like this I have no words. Definitely not going back. Plus I feel you guys should look into this matter seriously someone can actually fall really ill if you don't maintain hygiene standards.

Sorry but I am constrained to revise my earlier high opinion. Ive been there twice since then and all I can say is that they have changed so much over the past 1 year. Service is pathetic...food is cold and most importantly, nobody really gives a damn. I had to actually carry my own plate to the kitchen since the food was served cold. After 20 minutes I get the same plate back re-heated on a microwave. If that wasnt enough, not one single waiter either served me a glass of water, nor asked if I wanted a dessert.  As I said....pathetic. Please ignore my earlier rating and PLEASE dont bother to even try going to Cocoa Bakery ever.

This is a beautiful little cafe. The decor is really nice. :) I bought chocolate cookies from here. The cookies had gems on top of it. They looked cute. My sisters loved it. I found everything to be pricy. One cookie costed 40 bucks. The size of the cookie was small too. I would love to try their other dishes too.

The place might be small and tucked away into a lane but they make the finest desserts. Ordered a truffle cake for my father's cake and was mighty pleased! Have also tried their pancakes which weren't all that impressive. Chocolates are ther forte and they really excel in cakes. Do give this place a try.

Place is bit tricky to find out in New Alipore - located right on the lane opposite to Cafe Coffee Day - referred by one of my friend. The ambience is very cozy reflecting the theme of dessert and bakery in every corner of the shop. Visited for the first time today and ordered Brownie Shake, Fish Floentine and Creme Brulee. The taste are perfect and met my expectation. Will visit again.......

Fallen in love with this boutique bakery. Drop in everytime, i visit the area. Not only me but my friends appreciated a lot about their taste and quality - macaroons, bday cakes,  home made chocolates boxes gifted by me. 

During the time tried their yummy delicious chicken tikka patty, oreo cheese cake, tiramisu pastry - simple out of the world. Love their normal cold coffee.

 Hence moving my rating from 4.5 to 5.0. All the best Cocoa Bakery !!!

I had ordered a birthday cake for my mother at around 8.30pm, which is when the bakery confirmed the order via Zomato for a delivera at 9.53pm. I called the restaurant up at 9.50pm to ask how much longer it would take, when I was rudely told that the order wouldn't be delivered, and that I should speak to Zomato. The line was then promptly disconnected. This has been a pathetic experience.

Well this had to be big. The comeback. Got invited for an event for holi. The launch of their cakes being the main event , we were definitely made to savour the rich flavours of the desserts. 

The location is quite tricky for people who are novice to New Alipore. It is situated near the Cafe Coffee Day , New Alipore.

What attracted my attention as soon as I entered the joint was the superb utilisation of space. The café have been areanged in such a way that it looks spacious. It is a place where people can just hop in, spread their legs, relax and relish chocolates. 

The decor was particularly innovative, in a true sense , the way a bakery should look like. A dummy marriage cake with a flowing fountain and a dancing doll cake is quite a noticeable feature The beautiful chandelier and the couches to relax makes it even more apt. However, I felt good music was lacking.

Mr. Sunil Lakhani and Mrs. Sarita Lakhani has been beautiful hosts, amicable, pleasant and great-to-talk to. The speciality is they make customised cake even at odd hours and that stands out.

Since it was introduction of Holi hampers , the goodie bags , we were gifted amazingly made chocolate cupcakes, which definitely deserves a mention. Along with it, we were served high tea and the menu included:

Food-

1. Pasta Alfredo : the pasta was beautifully cooked to perfection. Served twice, quite consistent. The flavours of basil however was quite stern which added to the aroma . The white sauce was amazingly made. It was served hot, and that of course made it tastier.

2. Veg focassia : found it quite dry as it was overcooked.

3. Paneer tikka patties: tasted great. The paneer stuffing was cooked to perfection. It tasted amazing.
                                          ...

This place has seating arrangement and there is enough place even if you go in a group .. 
Ideal place for an evening chai n relaxing.. Or you can take your girlfriends and enjoy the delicacies while you chat away.. 
Oh this place also offers a variety of bread options ..

Had ordered online, a black forest pastry and a sesame mousse. The delivery guy called me 3-4 times asking me directions. I had to tell him the route and guide him as he came by auto rickshaw. Finally he reached but my order was in a total mess, still edible. He worked too hard to cover a short distance. The owner has to do something about their delivery service. 

Food - Black forest @ 60 Rupees, nothing extra ordinary, Mio amore Black forest which costs 35 bucks is way better. The mousse was rich, okayish in taste, was expensive, nothing extraordinary.

Warning - Never order cakes online from this place.

One of the nicest place I have been to. This cafe is located near Bidya Bharati School in the New Alipore.

#Price: This cafe is pricey, compared to other similar cafes. It charges quite a bucks even for common, simple & light amount of food stuffs.

#Food: The cafe provides a variety of snacks, shakes & deserts. Though some items are always not available.

The place is better known for making amazingly designed birthday & anniversary cakes. It also has a great collection of cookies & breads which you can buy in packets & take home.

We went there for some desert & ordered chocolate brownie with ice cream, chocolate mouse and cold drinks. Both the items were yum & licking good.

#Interior: The interior arrangement is an added point of this cafe.

#Service: They treat their customers well.

#Location: New Alipore, close toVidhya Bharati School/ American Cave/CCD

#Service: Excellent. Mr. Rajesh Mishra the manager was swift, diligent and welcoming. 

#Ambiance: There is only one adjective that is echoed by the entire restaurant cum bakery -' PRETTY'. A pretty signboard welcomes you at the entrance. Once you walk in, the aroma of freshly baked goodies, the vintage lights, the cozy sofa, the stoned walls, and the array of colorful bakery items from chocolates, to bread, to cakes on display ; everything gave the place a cozy and homely atmosphere. 

#My Experience : 
I had walked in for a quick breakfast and wanted to try something very simple. I ordered A chicken sandwich and some fresh lime soda. The food arrived in sometime. In the meanwhile we got chatting with the owner Mrs. Sarita Lakhamani . We talked about an array of things from her cafe, to her business and the more she spoke the more I got more interested. She is warm in a subtle way and her confidence is noteworthy.
Now talking of the food , the sandwich was simple and tasty, with nothing superfluous about it. The fresh lime was a tad bit bland and i would have liked it more had there been some more of mint leaves and lemon.

Here is wishing the team of Cocoa Bakery all the very best for their future endeavor.

Upon coming back to Kolkata, I've constantly been on the lookout for coffee places, just to hang out with a couple of friends and have a good cup of coffee, with minimum pocket pinch. In this hunt, I came across Cocoa Bakery and I loved it from the first time I went. Great ambience, reasonable prices and delicious food. They make amazing sandwiches and the pasta was good too. The coffee is especially good and the mudpie simply outstanding. Looking forward to going back again :)

I ordered 3 food items (Dry Marble Cake, Grilled Chicken Sandwich, Multi-grain Bread) on 1st July,2016 at 3.31 PM via Zomato Online Ordering service. My total bill amount as calculated by Zomato was as follows... Chicken Sandwich

1  ₹170.00 
Marble Cake

1  ₹300.00 
Multi-grain Bread

1  ₹50.00 
Subtotal ₹520.00

Restaurant promo ₹78.00

Packing Charge ₹26.52

Delivery Charge ₹20.00

Total ₹488.52
I got an SMS at 3.36 PM that my order got confirmed and I would be receiving the food by 4.46 PM.
Eventually, I got my food at 5.45 PM. I tried to call the restaurant in-between who replied with a careless tone that the food is on its way. Similarly, I tried to call Zomato on 011-33105234, but unfortunately the call didn't get connected. So the food came after 1 hr of its schedule arrival time.  And now another shocker. The delivery boy handed me over a bill of Rs. 540/-  to my surprise as I was intimated by Zomato that it was only Rs. 488.52/-. The food was on average side. Now, the question which arises is whom to blame. Neither the restaurant nor the service provider informed me about the late delivery. Zomato was not even bothered to know whether the food was delivered on time or not and did send me a email at 6.00 PM confirming the delivery with the same amount of Rs. 488.52 stated in it. This is not at all happening. And this is simply not expected from a premiere food delivery service provider. So please wake up and put a thorough coordination cell in your system to avoid these kind of failures in future. Hope my clarification will help.
N.B.: I have attached the bill which I got from Cocoa Bakery.

Truth be told- this place is good at some stuff and average at others. 
The desserts (especially the Monte Carlo) are class. We tried the new dessert- which doesn't have a name yet. It's the same spherical concoction with a chocolate fudge filling as seen all over the internet. Definitely worth the experience! 
Moderately priced but worth the money. Also, other food items like their pastas and risottos are good. 
However. The salad was a total let down. Even a wrap we had ordered was simple. Nothing of the way or extraordinary. 
Would I visit again? Of course. But not to try out anything new. I'll just stick with what I'm used to and be happy about it!

This little adorable confectionary was discovered during a walk. Not by me, by an erstwhile friend. Delighted by their creation, she introduced me to their red velvet cake and walnut brownies - a slice of which can whisk away all your stress. A few more slices and you'll complain about nothing in the world. Try - it works, trust me :-)
P.S. If you wish to customize your cake, you totally have to try this little paradise on earth.

I had come to this cafe with a lot expectations as it is one of the three bakeries in the city that serves Red velvet cakes and the only one to  have macaroons. And guess what? I was disappointed. The red velvet cake was so bad and the cheese cream was shit. The macaroons were just fine.

My comfort zone. I find everything good about this cafe, right from the food to the ambience.
Only few faukts that i find are:
1) seating area is small
2) menu is same and needs fresh additions (even if pop-up) in near future
3) filling of sandwich is varying with time
4) more options for soups
5) some choices for low-calorie food hunters
The owners are really sweet and the managers efficient. Its a definite winner!

I have been to this place for 6 times now. And I stay in Garia, mind you. Their cakes and pastries and pastas and quiche everything draw me to this place like a magnet.
The food is amazing. Ambience is good. Staff is also very helpful. What else can anyone ask?
This is the favorite hangout place of me and my bff Ragini(both foodies) and we LOVE this place.
People should try- cordon bleu, tetrazzini, quesadillas, fish n chips, swiss roll, monte carlo, custom cupcakes, choco cones, red velvet pastries.
And many more.
Keep baking and make us more happy! :)

One fine evening my friend discovers this place while waiting for me outside the CCD and then we came here just to explore options. Much to our delight we found this as a right place to have our post work siesta. That day we had ordered for grilled chicken salad and grilled chicken in red wine sauce and both tasted just delicious to our taste buds. Within another 15 days we have again visited this place and we had ordered for chicken tetrazzini and smoked BBQ chicken. Again, to our delight, both tasted perfect. But the real showstopper was the brownie in chocolate sauce which tasted heavenly. 
While space crunch is an issue, I would like to point out that the music played inside the cafè seems loud for a cafè. They might need to look into this matter. However, the food and service both are extremely good and will strongly recommend this place to anyone.

Pretty awesome  a place . A little space crunch but that's only because of the ever flowing crowd . The pasta was good - mixed sauce.  Ordered for a crumb fried chicken too which was equally tasteful . Crispy yet not very oily . What - was enjoyed most was the Chocolate Mud Pie warmed up - so soft and delicious.

A 15 seater bakery cafe in the heart of new Alipore. A cool joint to hang out for a short time or even grab a meal. Our order and highly impressed by the taste : 
1. Mushroom omlette(outstanding)
2. Veg quesadilla 
3. Penne in red sauce
4. Virgin Mojito
5. Montecarlo

And pastries and patties, KJ has got a sweet competition to say the least.

Cafes which don't serve blueberry cheesecake/ serve bad blueberry cheesecake rarely get this kind of a rating from me. 
But Cocoa Bakery has some amazing confectionaries (chocolate boat <3). The beverages are good too. 
Must visit!

We tried this new cafe in Alipur and it was extremely good. The seating, food, price is very very good. I think I can go to this place for breakfast for a good omlette. Overall a very good option to meet friends/ family over italian/ Mexican food.
For the management - maintain your quality and I am sure you are here to stay.

Cocoa Bakery is now a renowned name in bakery industry. Their forte is to make any type of customized cake. I am privileged to be invited for a food tasting session on the occasion of pre-launching of "LEBANESE MENU" through 'PANCH PHORON' group.

It is located near Bidya Bharati Girls' High School,New Alipore opposite to Cafe Coffee Day. Well,for me it was not an easy find. People are requested to follow zomato map instead of google map.

It is a small outlet with nice and simple decor. It has 4-5 tables accommodating 12-15 people at a time. The biscuit colored textured walls with photos of food and interesting quotations on food,the chairs and tables are in sync with the walls which gives a soothing effect as soon as you enter. Various decorative cake replicas are used for decoration. Though there is a serious issue of space crunch.

As we made ourselves comfortable,we were welcomed with some refreshing mocktails. We had-Classic Virgin Mojito and Sea Blue Cooler. Both were thirst-quenching and ideal to beat the scorching sun.

Now the food-
Chicken Shawarma- It is a vastly popular gourmet sandwich of Middle East. Grilled chicken mixed with little greek yogurt and tahini and is filled in soft flat pita bread made from baking wheat flour. It was small in size garnished with small red cherry tomato but filling was in good proportion and the whole thing was tightly bound with a piece of spring onion so that it did not fall of while eating. The taste was amazing though I found it a bit dry.

Lentil Burger- A pure veg item. The crunchy and crispy inner patty was made of chick pea and red kidney bean or rajma while the fresh bread was soft and balanced the taste. It was topped with cucumber and red cherry tomato. It was decent in taste. A very good option for all vegetarians.

Hummus and Nachos- Initially,we thought it was another item;then the owner Mrs. Sarita Lakhmani informed us that it would be served with shawarma and burgers. Hummus is a dip made from boiled,mashed chick pea and tahini or sesame seed paste.  It is an appetizer and tasted great with crispy nachos.

Penne Pasta with Feta Cheese- Its smell was really mouth watering. Penne were properly boiled and mixed with red sauce and good amount of black olives,zucchini and big pieces of feta cheese. It tasted good but excess cheese just killed the appetite after some time and made the taste buds go insensitive.

Mixed Fruit Pastry- This was just amazing. Small soft white cream pastry topped with kiwi,apple and cherry was yummy. It is a must have.

Mango Cheese Cake- It is a show stopper for me. The base layer made up of ground coconut and then layered by cream cheese and ripe mango mousse and topped with fresh ripe mango. The whole thing was scrumptious and well balanced in sweetness. Nothing can beat it as an ideal dessert during the hot summer.

Trio Mousse- It is meant for all chocolate lovers.As the name says,it is of three layers- upper thin dark and bitter chocolate layer followed by thick white chocolate layer which is followed by milk chocolate layer and then dark but sweet chocolate layer. It was decorated with a dollop of dark chocolate and sheet of white and dark chocolate on top. It was ambrosial though sweetness was high.

All the items were very reasonably priced. The staffs were courteous. Overall the experience was really nice.

So,if you want to chill out with your friends over some snacks or you want to surprise your loved ones with a customized cake of your imagination, this is the joint you should go for. But yes.. don't forget to ring them before you drop in!!

P.S. Thanks a lot for the amazing "NABO BARSHO" cake.

It was a big moment for me when I got invited to Cocoa Bakery to sample their new Lebaneese menu which they are planning to launch during Poila Boisakh.Thanks to Panchphoron and Pritha di for that. This place could be a bit difficult to locate if you are new to New Alipore since it’s divided into a number of blocks.However,the nearest landmark is Bidya Bharati Girl’s High School.It would be better to follow the Zomato map than Gmap. It’s a very small place with limited seating but one can’t help but adore this place.

This place could be a bit difficult to locate if you are new to New Alipore since it's divided into a number of blocks.
However,the nearest landmark is Bidya Bharati Girl's High School.It would be better to follow the Zomato map than Gmap. It's a very small place with limited seating but one can't help but adore this place.

Description:

On entrance,we find a replica of the wedding cake which I'm sure every to-be bride wants on her D-Day!!!Apart from that,they have many gift boxes,chocolate lollypops,mini muffins,pastries and cakes.They had some leftover Easter chocolates  which were very cute.One of the best parts about this bakery is their ability to make customized birthday cakes or cakes for different occasions.They make 1 lb customized cakes and have no minimum no. of lb that one necessarily has to order in other bakeries!!!The owner welcomed us with a warm smile after we were seated.
Their couches are pretty comfortable and one never finds this place empty in the evening,since they host a no. of parties as well. 

Food:

Mojito-It was pretty refreshing with the mint and the basil leaves.There was fizz as well which many mojitos lack due to usage of old sodas/Sprites.Overall,it had a perfect balance of all the ingredients.

Chicken Shawarma-This was rather a mini Shawarma but quite filling.What I liked more about this dish was the way it was  wrapped,it was tied at the bottom with Spring Onion which helped the entire wrap to stay intact without the filling coming out.This was served with cherry tomatoes.Coming to flavour,the filling was good but it was a bit dry since too much cheese had been used.It would be better if the amount of grated cheese be reduced or still better,the cheese be melted into sauce.A bit too much cheese made the dish dry.

Nachos and spicy hummus-The nachos went very well with the hummus.I was really impressed to find 
the well balanced hummus,since the chickpeas were ground finely and did not contain lumps.Even,the flavor of garlic did not overpower it.

Lentil burger-The burger was quite crunchy,being made with chickpeas and rajma.Initially,the burger was a bit dry but we were told to have it with the hummus and it went very well with it.The burgers were small in size but since the patties were made from lentils,it made the burger quite filling.A pretty good option for vegetarians.

Penne pasta with Feta cheese-The pasta had a very nice aroma as soon as we lifted the lid to have a look at it.It tasted good too,being made with red sauce,and had ample zucchini,black olives and lumps of Feta cheese.The concept of the lumps of Feta cheese was new to me,but it tasted good nevertheless. 

Mixed Fruit Pastry-These were served in small cubes.It was fresh and served with avocade,apple and cherry on top.The pastry had chopped fruits with the cream.A must try for all fruit lovers!!! 

Mango Cheesecake-This was an absolute delight!!!The base was made with ground coconut followed by coconut and mango mousse.All the ingredients tasted fresh,including the pieces of mango served on top of each cheesecake.One of the best mango cheesecakes I have had!!! 

Trio Mousse-This patry is visualling appealing for all chocolate lovers!!!It has three layers,the bottom layer being
 made from dark chocolate,the middle one with milk chocolate and the top comprising of milk chocolate,topped off with a piece of chocolate on top.I found this pastry a bit too sweet for my tastebuds,but nevertheless wasn't bad.

Pricing:

Chicken Shawarma-150

Penne Pasta with Feta cheese-275

Falafel Cheese burger with nachos and spicy hummus-200

Mixed Fruit Pastry-70

Trio Mousse-100

Mango Cheesecake-150

We were given a special "Poila Boisakh" cake as a gift in the end which tasted exceptionally good!!!It had interestingfondant decorations which included the replica of rice,coconut,genda phool and the traditional shiuli phool.

I would have been oblivious of its presence, had I not happened to look up Zomato while roaming around the Taratala area to look for a cosy place to sit in to have a good adda. And it's such a small yet classy place! The porch and the leaves hanging down, with an oldish board sticking out, and the yellow lights inside give you a feeling of getting transported to some European city some centuries back.

And on entering the place, you will be filled with the aroma of fresh confectioneries, and beautiful cake-models set up around the place. And you will be surprised by the number of items this tiny place has to offer! Though mostly meant for snacks, this bakery will even give you options of pasta or stroganoff, or burgers.

I visited the place around 4.30 p.m. and so stuck to a Chicken Envelope, a Tiramisu Pastry and Monte Carlo. The prices are reasonable for the quantity. And my, my, the taste of the pastries still linger in my mouth!
The Tiramisu never disappoints, no matter where I taste it. But I tried the Monte Carlo for the first time, and the molten chocolate and choco chips just mixed oh-so-deliciously in my mouth, along with the vanilla. And it's so fulling!

I had also ordered for a Tiramisu Birthday Cake, and needless to say, it was all you can ask for on your birthday!

I am definitely gonna try to go in for their seasonal Nolen Gur Soufflae and the Mango Brulee. Or maybe, I will just hop in to enjoy the ambiance and try out their chocolate delights!

After reading all the reviews, I could not resist myself from visiting this place. Finding this place from the Google maps is a task. Later figured out that its on the opposite lane of the CCD New Alipore. Its a small cozy place.

I liked the small cake fountain kept at the entrance. The seating arrangement is a mix of chairs and sofas and you have six different places to sit. 

The staff are very friendly and while going through the menu I realized that they have a host of offerings. At first I ordered Cappuccino Chicken mayo sandwich and one grilled chicken sandwich. The coffee taste was great and it was much needed by me and I should say that it tasted better than other coffee provided by the nearby joints. The chiken mayo was OK and so the grilld chicken sandwich which had some french fries. 

I also ordered the strawberry shake after some time and I must say, this was the best of the lot, simply loved it. White milk bread, smaller than what you get in the market but at the same time better than what you have regularly.

In terms of the price point reasonable, good food and cozy is what I have to say about this place. I will surely look forward to the next visit where I can try out something more specially the Pan cakes, its been ages for me since I had the pan cakes with honey.

We decided to go for a drive on the quiet evening of holi and then landed up here.I had been to cocoa bakery before but this visit was special.Previously I had tried some of their desserts and shakes.So this time we decided to try out their savoury items as well.We ordered a non veg quiche and an envelope and a mud pie.Everything tasted sooooooooooooo fresh and tasty.I fell in love with the quality of the puff pastry.The prices mentioned are inclusive of taxes.Great ambiance,lovely decor,awesome lighting.It gives you a homely feeling.And the person waiting on us reminded us of Alfred from Batman,so very polite. *_*

Cocoa bakery has already made its mark in the short span of about 2.5 years mainly because of its premium quality bakery products, cookies, cup cakes and amazing quick bites. The advertisement has primarily been the word of mouth which I believe is the best way to build the goodwill and customer base. It is not present in any buzzing food gully or somewhere like Park Street or Sector-5, the place is basically a residential area (New Alipur Block-A); but still this place draws loads of crowd, primarily because people tend to come back to this place for more. People who appreciate quality and love the classy ambiance this place has to offer are sure to visit time and again. 

I was invited at this place for their event named ‘Bakery Bahar for Bashant Panchami’ along with other Panch phoron members. They had arranged a foodie meet to mark the introduction of bakery items in lovely gift boxes for presenting to your loved ones, family and friends during this Holi. It being such a popular festival in Kolkata this offering from Cocoa Bakery is definitely like an icing on the cake for the fun filled festivities of Holi. I was quite amazed to see their collection of gift items for this Holi that included cookies, cup cakes, macaroons, mousse, chocolates, & assorted bakery items.

Holi is knocking at the door. To celebrate the festival of colours with the modern trend, Cocoa bakery has launched a wide range of assorted chocolates, cakes, cookies, cupcakes, etc. To be a part of this event, I was invited along with my 'Panchphoron' team.

Cocoa bakery is located opposite CCD, New Alipore. From outside, the place looks very simple. But on entering, I was startled by the décor. Rarely any bakery has such exquisite decor in this city. The place has been very neatly done up in European style. The seats are cushioned and very comfortable.

The cakes, cupcakes, cookies and chocolates specially designed for holi were displayed before us. They looked so amazing that it was almost impossible to even think of eating them. Each item they prepared looked very colourful and well suited to the holi theme.

Now coming to the food, we were served iced tea. The drink was cold and quite refreshing. Though it lacked tanginess, I enjoyed sipping it on the summer afternoon.

Then, there was a good buffet spread awaiting us. We started with Pasta Alfredo. The penne was perfectly cooked. A special mention to the white cheese sauce which was rich and creamy and it was the sauce that enhanced the flavour of the dish. Served hot, the pasta tasted great. Each of us liked it so much, that we all took a second serving.

Next, we had veg focaccia. It was topped with broccoli, olives, capsicum, corn and a decent amount of cheese. The dish looked colourful and tasted good. However the bread was a little dry.

Then there were paneer tikka patties and chicken tikka patties. Both looked similar and were cooked well.The tikka flavour was very nice. The paneer stuffing tasted decent. The chicken patties had generous amount of chicken and tasted good.

The pastry which we tried in the end was the best of lot. It was their signature Mixed fruit pastry. The pastry looked nice and tasted amazing. Juicy slices of fruits like apple, mango, grapes, pineapple, etc had been infused between layers of cake and cream. A must try over here !

Our meal was accompanied by a mug of cold coffee which was well made. It was very refreshing.

I was gifted with a set of assorted chocolates, which were indeed praiseworthy.

Overall, this place is good if you want to spend some time with a cup of coffee and some desserts. The customized cakes they make are really good and commendable. So, once you order from here, you will keep on ordering !

Showcasing of Holi Themed Desserts & Hi Tea by Cocoa Bakery :)

Holi, the festival of colors, is one of the mega Indian festivals, denoted by splash of colors, water balloons, containers of abir (dry color), thandai (a beverage) etc. Few days prior to the festival, the folks go crazy with holi themed parties, kirtans (prayer songs), and other get-togethers. Also, there is distribution of holi sweets amongst family and friends. 

With time, this exchange of Holi desserts, has evolved from the traditional gujiyas, badas and kachoris, to modern age cupcakes, brownies and macaroons. Children and youth enjoy them, and elders welcome the fresh change.

To commemorate Holi and its spirit, Cocoa Bakery has come up with a whole new range of cakes, teacakes, cupcakes, brownies, macaroons, cookies, chocolates etc. They also have an assortment of pre designed Holi platters, which can be given as gifts, or even, used for home consumption. The platters are, both sweet based, as well as, sweet and savoury based.

They invited us over high tea, to showcase their Holi themed collection, which was pretty colorful and attractive. They also gifted us a dessert pack, containing a couple of brownies, chocolates and cookies. All of these items were well made, and tasted nice.

Cozy little cafe situated in the heart of New Alipore in the lane opposite to CCD. Their menu is pretty diverse, ranging from a catalogue of cakes to a variety of burgers. The presence of a television in the inner half of the cafe is a boon to cricket lovers. The cafe is a treat to watch in the evening from outside owing to their wonderful lighting system. Ideal place for a quick bite and a long chat.

Bored of the same old mainstream cafés and pizza outlets? Look no more! Cocoa Bakery is this one wonderful café located right across CCD in New Alipore. This place is a must try if you're a Behala foodie. It serves the best mixed sauce penne pasta. Monte Carlo is a pretty good selection among the dessert section. This café provides you with a warm ambience and is pocket friendly for students and college goers.

I had visited this place for breakfast. Had taken the buffet options, like there timings as it could be a brunch- if they had added some more variety with pancakes/ waffles/ a North Indian item and yes increase the price a bit, but keeping the pricing in mind which would be easy to the pocket.
Anyways it was worth the price 275 INR per person good deal, a suggestion if you could add a vegetable and fresh cut fruit would make it more complete. 
The spread included Coleslaw sandwiches- ok, croissants- which was good, vegetable cutlets, chicken sausages, eggs to order, (sad to hear they do not serve mushrooms in the omelette if u go for buffet- the way staff replied was not approachable and not welcoming at all) baked beans which was tasty, sliced bread, sliced cake pastries, cereals, canned pineapple juice, tea and coffee.
Overall the food quality was good, but service and organization could have been much much better, there were no extra plates, cutlery on the buffet said, no tissue on the tables,everything was to be asked for  more than once. 
After which I had packed all there varieties of breads and taken few pastries- chocolate truffle, pineapple, and tiramisu. All yeh breads were tasty, fresh, and good excepting the Special Masala bread and the Cheese bread, the prices are extremely high but sorry not worth it at all, yes the other breads are good. The pastries were awesome both which was packed and which was on the buffet. 
Overall liked everything, organization and hygiene should be worked on. Hoping to visit agin for buffet and try A la Carte too. Thank you, cheers all the best!!

Heard lots about this place and visited with my family. Food was good...but we saw cockroaches at our table. Not once but twice! Cafe staff stood and stared while we had to kill them. What was worse was the hair in the pasta. We spoke with the owner who was rather casual about the roaches and the hair. Not even a courtsey discount given the experience! Seemed to care a damn! Tasty food cannot overshadow cockroaches snd hair!

We went here during durga pujas mainly to avoid the crowd as its a bit off beat location and would be relatively less crowded.

Food: We had ordered a Smoked bar B Q chicken which was nice and Chicken Stroganoff with rice which didn't taste that well, especially if you look at the price range. Then we had a chocolate cone(was hard and too sweet i thought!) and a chocolate brownie sundae which was quite good. We also had Sea blue cooler and classic virgin mojito to go with the food that was pretty much standard.

Service: Very prompt service, you might feel its a bit understaffed if the place is very busy on a given day.

Ambiance: Typical cozy cafe ambiance as in any good confectionery/bakery outlet. Nothing out of the world that needs special mention.

Verdict: Can visit once in a while if you live in the area. You must have a very sweet tooth to like this place, The desserts and chocolates taste extra sweet! :D

I super love this place. The decor, the collections, the everything! We went there twice, to order a birthday cake for a friend and next for reception. During the placement of our order, a lady helped us out, who seemed to be a benchmark for the shop itself. Excellent choices, remarkable gallery of options. All other people are also very amicable and helpful here. And finally the cake, oh it was yummy!

Just the opposite lane of tje new alipore ccd. I dropped in there to buy a birthday cake and ordered for a double truffle cake. Service was very prompt and behaviour was excellent which is primarily required. The cake was awesome and crunchy with tripple layer. Taste was fantastic. Surely visit again for fish florentine and to taste other large variety of dishes. All the best and keep the level up.

It's all the deliciousness of a bakery and the comfort of cafe rolled into one. This snug little place will spoil you with the most delectable choices of fresh baked goodies, cakes, savories and classics done to perfection. It's our new go-to place for every celebration, mood swing, comfort food needs, and random coffee cravings. 

After much speculation, we concluded that they probably have the nicest and most passionate people baking, cooking, serving and managing this place.

A very easy to locate, cosy and beautifully decorated place! Being a cake lover, i visited there with my girlfriends to spend some quality time as well as taste cakes & cookies from the place that i have been eyeing for long!
before the first visit, i got to taste their tiramisu pastry in Bakery festival in cc, held 2 weeks ago! the pastry won my heart instantly!
here we had the red velvet cake, brownie in a bowl, mudpie, hot chocolate drink and spaghetti in red sauce! everything was good but not the hot choco! it tasted like bournvita! n i have had hot chocolate in places like choco cafe! n they serve it really good! bought muffins for my mother, she loved it too.
10 on 10 on the ambience part though! v well decorated & also on the hugeee menu!
u r actually spoilt for choices!!
will go back soon!!
for the brunch on sunday!!

This bakery was in my must-visit list since a long time. Finally got time to visit here on the first day of the new year.  
When entered into the restaurant , it was totally full . It is a small cozy place beautifully decorated. As it was full, we planned to take home delivery. Took two cute cupcakes n four chocolate pastry. The cupcake costs 100rs each and pastry costs 30rs each. 
The pastry was very moist n yummy.  The cupcake was huge in size.  Its a plain chocolate muffin with chocolate frosting n topped with teddy topper. The topper was too sweet in taste which I didn't like ., otherwise it was good.

Small little place located on the road opposite Cafe Coffee Day just after Block G in New Alipore known especially for their bread. The garlic bread is especially awesome. They have the typical cafe stuff going and attract a lot of the young crowd in the neighbourhood. 

Their cafe eats are also decent but I think it is the cuteness and coziness of the ambience which gets them their customers more than the quality of their stuff. Worth the evening coffee if you are okay with a little more noise than one would expect at such a place.

Cheers,

This is definitely one bakery which can give competition to Mrs Magpie if it keeps up the good work they're doing at the moment. Have only tried a couple of their items (Nolen Gur Souffle & Brownie in Bowl) so far and will judge on that basis only. Both the items were extremely appealing to the taste buds. Really liked the overall experience here, would definitely go back here from time to time to try the other items they have to offer.

Saw the brightly lit signage and landed up with 3 friends for the first time ever! Have seen this place for long but frankly was always a bit worried that it maynot be what it looks like from outside !!
Cosy interiors... Clean tables ..
Best of all I must say extremely accommodating staff and owner ..
Asked for a lemon ginger and honey tea, as we all were mostly down with cold and sore throat( which is not in the menu) they were initially a bit unsure but then the owner ( we presume ) very happily accommodated our request !! Star 1
Ordered tea cakes - the date and walnut steals the show with just the right amount of sweetness :) 
It's as simple but frankly it's those simple food we look for when we want to feel good :) next comes the special chocolate muffin and the cinnamon cake. All simple yet delicious !! Star 2
Ordered the Smoked BBQ chicken - spot on with right flavours and just lightly sautéed bell peppers can't complain ( maybe a bit bigger portion size for that price) still can't complain as the flavours -
Star-3
Bongs favourite - Fish and chips 
It's a classic which other places in the city are ruining by using Basa fish( absolutely tasteless)
But here at this place it was just AMAZING , juicy Betki , lightly spiced, thinly crumbed , and served with fresh ( really fresh) tartare sauce and just the right amount of crispy fries.
I am a sucker for good fish fries and believe me this place serves one of the best fish fries I have had in recent times .. As I am writing this review after 2 hours I am still salivating ..Star -4
We sat and chatted for a long time and the staff never seemed to mind or rushed us in any way even though it's a small cafe .
I only took away 1/2 a star for the choice of ambient music which I thought was a bit loud , thumps and jarring for such a small place!!
But 4.5 stars is one of the highest I have ever given :) 
Don't miss this little gem of a place !!! Brightly lit from outside !! But warm from inside with even warmer and accommodating staff and team!! Most importantly great food !!
I am going back soon for my Fish and chips 
So should you plus I want to explore rest of the menu!!!!

Tucked cozily in one of the many New-Alipore Bylanes, this one is a teeny weeny cafe - more of a takeaway joint and more than a bakery really... I tried their cappuccino which was creamy and well-brewed (I like my coffee way too milky), and picked a few of their pastries and red-velvet cakes. The pastries were not too bad (tad dry), the red velvet cake was truly the winner. I will go back for it.

The Food is amazing. Chicken Tettrazini and Chicken Corde La Bleu. MindBlowing.
We Visited This Place For Two Consecutive Days , Heard of the dessert named Monte Carlo but we werent lucky enough to get it all we got is brownie in truffle sauce which is a classy yet simple dessert.. Place crunch is a bit of a problem otherwise it beats Wise Owl and other italian food serving places... Do visit this place but make sure you prebook a table
else you can always opt for takeaways.. Never the less the food is of sheer and supreme quality. :)

My experience has been more of a pick up then dine in, the decor is dazzling and it has a subdued vibe. All in all it is good looking bakery. At first encounters I just ordered dessert and refreshments for my brunches at home and my taste buds were never disappointed. I always was reluctant of the savory that they served because it is a bakery and did not consider savory food to be up to standard but then one fine day I had it anyways and I was baffled cause everything tasted so good. All in all a great shop and more than an average bakery.

One of the good new coffee shop around here. The coffee tea and snacks given were not awesome but not bad either.
Awful experience when i visited with a friend. The shop was empty then and we took the only comfortable sofa seating (meant for seating 4) available there. We were asked by the manager to take the wooden chair seating as they had group of 4 waiting, and if we didnt want to, we could leave.
Service standards hit a new low.
Disgusted by the approach of the manager, we left, only to find out that no one was waiting and they wanted sofa seats IF a bigger group arrives.

I had visited this place once based on the reviews on Zomato! Found this place a bit over hyped, nothing too great about the place, it a small joint, in New Alipore! I had a chocolate mud pie, which I didn really relish it. Also had packed some chocolate pastries for my house but I didn't really like the quality of the product. I feel it wasn't worth the price at all, at the given price there are many more bakery joints in Kolkata offering good quality stuff. Their quantity is also too less! Not so happy with the place! Buck up guys!

My experience has been more of a pick up then dine in, the decor is dazzling and it has a subdued vibe. All in all it is good looking bakery. At first encounters I just ordered dessert and refreshments for my brunches at home and my taste buds were never disappointed. I always was reluctant of the savory that they served because it is a bakery and did not consider savory food to be up to standard but then one fine day I had it anyways and I was baffled cause everything tasted so good. All in all a great shop and more than an average bakery.

One of the good new coffee shop around here. The coffee tea and snacks given were not awesome but not bad either.
Awful experience when i visited with a friend. The shop was empty then and we took the only comfortable sofa seating (meant for seating 4) available there. We were asked by the manager to take the wooden chair seating as they had group of 4 waiting, and if we didnt want to, we could leave.
Service standards hit a new low.
Disgusted by the approach of the manager, we left, only to find out that no one was waiting and they wanted sofa seats IF a bigger group arrives.

I had visited this place once based on the reviews on Zomato! Found this place a bit over hyped, nothing too great about the place, it a small joint, in New Alipore! I had a chocolate mud pie, which I didn really relish it. Also had packed some chocolate pastries for my house but I didn't really like the quality of the product. I feel it wasn't worth the price at all, at the given price there are many more bakery joints in Kolkata offering good quality stuff. Their quantity is also too less! Not so happy with the place! Buck up guys!

I've been a frequent visitor at cocoa bakery right from the time it started. It's an impressively designed cafe, the small space is well utilized. The  cafe is adequately illuminated with modern designs and lights which is quite propelling.

Speaking about food, I've been visiting cocoa bakery mainly for having coffee, pattie (veg, paneer), sandwiches, pastry, tarts and cakes.

For once I tried it's veg main course and I'm sorry to state that it wasn't tasty or impressive considering its premium pricing (just to add that the prices of most of the food items of cocoa bakery are on a higher side compared to other cafes) if compared to its bakery items.

Service is on a slower side. For the main course item was delivered on my table after 40 mins from order. For other bakery items / coffee the average time was 15 / 20 minutes.  I expect the service turnaround time to improve during the course of time. 

My overall rating would be 3 out of 5. I'm yet to be wholly impressed by the cafe where I'm frequent. I've visited Cocoa Bakery for more than 20 times.

My first order online and my first food from cocoa bakery. It was my birthday and a red velvet cake was ordered. INR 600+ Delivery charges+ Packaging charges. It took more time than they said it would when I gave the order but it was okay. Well, at first I was a bit disappointed  with the size and the shocking pink color on it. I had expected something bigger and more elegant (like they show in masterchefs!!). But when I cut the cake it was truly amazing ; those three beautiful layers of red cake and cream in between, marvelous. The taste was very good as well, the frosting on the cake was very light, almost like vanilla ice cream and the cake was fresh. It was a fair enough experience :)

This Sunday (4 October) was not the first time I had visited this place. My family and I had loved the ambience and food on earlier visits. However, it was the first time we were turned away despite a booking. 

I had called the bakery on Saturday, late afternoon, and made a booking for the window table for a Sunday lunch. We were really looking forward to it, especially my mum, who hadn't left her house in over a month due to ill health. When we reached around 12.40, for a booking made for 1 pm, the host and hostess at the counter said that a) they didn't have a booking in my name, and b) they always take a booking against an advance, which I hadn't made. 

Firstly, it did not matter that I had the call record on my mobile as proof of my call to their establishment to make the booking. Secondly, as I had indicated, this wasn't the first time we were patronising them. Our previous bookings had certainly not required an advance payment (not that I know of other restaurants that do so); nor was I told about this when making the booking this time. However what ultimately did leave us with a bad taste in our mouths was the attitude of rudeness, animosity and defiance from the hosts. 

Had they momentarily forgotten that they are in the hospitality industry and that customers must be treated with respect and decorum? 

We were visiting this place after a long time with much eagerness. Not only were we effectively termed liars, we were turned away with no attempt on their part to resolve the situation. 

Since this is a forum for reviews, please note that the food here is quite good. At least it was the last time we ate here. However, after this horrifying experience, which is frankly a first for me, rest assured Cocoa Bakery has lost one good customer. My patronage unfortunately comes not at the cost of a mere bill but rather its reputation. 

And I count. 

P.S. Fortunately, the afternoon was saved by good old dependable Steak Factory in the same neighbourhood.

This cafe has been in my wishlist for many days, maybe, over a year. Going by its menu, its photos, and good reviews, I've had high expectations about this cafe. But not all expectations were met.

LOCATION: In New Alipore, in a bylane opposite to the Indian Mint. Since we both were new to the place, we had to use Google Maps to locate this cafe which is just 2 mins away from Bidya Bharati School.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: Fancily decorated with tiled walls, elegant lampshades. It's a small place, but has comfortable seating arrangements.  As we entered, there was no one to greet us, nor was there anyone who'd show us a table to sit. We settled in one of the two tables in front of the door; the section being secluded from the section with billing counter and bigger tables. We sat there, waiting for someone to arrive for nearly 10 minutes, until I decided to call someone from the counter. UTTER NEGLIGENCE, this was the first turn off. As I went up to the counter and asked them if it was a pay-first cafe, a man said, he was coming. He arrived to our table after some more delay, and asked for orders. Our table DID NOT have a menu card. Hearing this he gave us two menus from another table. This is by far the most CASUAL SERVICE I've seen in any cafe.

There were some good number of waiters, but they were mostly busy among themselves, and everytime I had to order something, I had to show up to the counter and ask for it.

Somewhere between our meal, I went up to the counter to ask for their WiFi password, and they refused.

HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!

FOOD: We had Cappuccino, Truffle Pastry, Roast Chicken and Onion Focaccia, and Grilled Chicken for main course.

Foods were okay to good. However the the grilled chicken tasted a bit odd, as the sauce didn't quite taste like red wine sauce, and was too peppery.

We were about to place orders for desserts, but their negligence was so irritating, we decided to leave the place, and have some desserts from somewhere else.

CONCLUSION: Good ambience, okay foods, awful service. I'd have given 3.5 otherwise, but -0.5 for the service.

A beautiful place to visit! The ambience is great! The staff was polite and courteous!  The the mushroom soup with sandwich was a real comfort food! But the best part was the apple pie! It was scrumptious! Bt i would suggest not to try the tomato soup though...its too acidic and has got the smell of raw tomatoes! Otherwise its a must visit!

Have ordered a few times.. food is pretty decent but there have been a few errors by them This includes forgetting to send me my creme brulee after i ordered it home , to not answering the call when i wanted to know why they missed it out... 
Dishes :
- Chicken Sicilana - Quite good actually. Was the first thing i had from there and it made me want to try the other dishes.
- Chicked Tetrazinni - OK. Not bad at all. Though I have had better but it good.
- Chicked Quesadilla - Overdone. Was too dry. JUST TOO DRY!!!
- Fish and Chips - Was decent. Quite liked the dip along with it. But yea the dip definitely overpowers the taste of the fish.
BUT THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT WAS FORGETTING MY CREME BRULEE.

The first left from the Majherhat bridge brings you here. The aroma of baked goodies can be smelled outside too. The interiors are cozy, I had high expectations from this place. We ordered 3 varieties of chocolate pastries but none of them could live up to my expectations. Then we ordered cream of mushroom soup, spinach and mushroom crepe and a penne pasta. Highly disappointing all of it were. I wouldn't recommend it further.

REVIEW-II
One should never visit this one! Few months after my 1st visit, my mum was there again with her student. She got me some take away creme brulee which tasted like a bland flavorless custard with no caramel cover to crack! Such a disappointment! What we found out after that was, they added some 8 pastries in the bill, which wasn't even ordered.We got them on the phone, they apologised,told us we'll be refunded and we decided to let go of the matter. 2 months after this incident my mum went there with her friends, and in the bill they had added 9 breads instead of the 3 my mum had bought. This is called forgery and theft,and apparently this cafe is excellent at it. I've decided to dump this one for good, and urging everyone to avoid it. Or at least, check the bills before paying. 
REVIEW-I
Went there for a quick lunch one afternoon! Tried the Fish and Chips, Veg Florentine and Grilled Chicken with Red Wine Sauce!! To begin with, though a tad bit drym Fish and Chips was delicious and the tartar sauce was yum!! Grilled chicken was good, the sauce being a bit too peppery! Veg Florentine was a huge win! The Red Velvet Cake was quite moist and flavorsome. It's a small cute eatery! Could be visited with friends. #Foodie

A beautiful  designed place which gives u a very cosy feel. I really loved the interiors and was pleasantly suprised with the food.
We had ordered spinach and corn crepe, mint mojito , cafe mocha and beans on toast.
I must say the crepe was just outstanding..I have not had such a crepe yet and I have had some.
The mint mojito was fresh and refreshing.
Beans on toast was also very good.
The only downer for me was the coffee. I don't know some how I did not like the taste.
I will go again pretty soon and try out everything in their menu. This one looks set to become a small gem.

I have never visited this place I have just seen the place while travelling yet all our birthday , anniversary cakes are from here. I have had cakes from many places but their cakes are just awesome or divine I must say. My wedding cake was from here. It was a nice chocolate two tier cake with a couple on the top. I just love eating their cakes. Even though I am not that much of a sweet lover and feel guilty if I eat too much sweets I happily gorge on their sinfully delightful cakes. For my sister in law who's a doc they had made a cute stethoscope on top of her birthday cake. Cakes are aesthetically made which makes it all the more special. Apart from chocolate cake I even had the black forest and tiramisu cake which were also yummy.

After a great dinner at CSC, it was time for some desserts. Friend who is a local of Kolkata suggested this placed. He incidentally stays in the same area as well and is fairly regular with the snacks(puff, etc) here. 

Its a small yet cosy place, with 4 tables. Two tables for 2 people, and 2 tables for 3-4 people. Ambiance is nice and uber. 

All the desserts were displayed over the rack. 

We ordered (we ate a lot in dinner and hence came here more for tasting) - 

2 Chocolate Moussee
1 Brownie with Ice-cream

Total Bill - Rs. 225

Needless to say this place I found very cheap, compared to Bangalore (my current home). And Kolkata in general is more economical in many facets as far as standard of living is concerned. So my view of reasonable may not be accurate. 

In hindsight, ordered 2 chocolate mousse was a mistake, instead we could have ordered 3 different desserts. 

Mousse had a nice flavor to it, though I found it very dry and hard for my liking. Moist is what I need. Will not repeat this if given a choice. One mousse we could barely finish half and left it. 

Brownie was outstanding, truly. Giving 4 stars only for this. The interesting part was brownie was in a cup, something like a crumbled one and very liquidy, unlike those usual slice brownies. 

Couldn't take photos as we all attacked quite immediately. May be next time. :-) 

Should you visit?
Yes!

I've ordered from this place a couple of times. The deserts are really good. Love the brownie, topped with the white and dark chocolate chips, their pastas are perfect comfort food. We've also tried the Monte Carlo desert: chocolate, caramel and mousse, very decadent. The breads are lovely, however it's not consistent: sometimes we've tried lovely fluffy croissants, sometimes they're tough and chewy.

Located just opposite to new alipore ccd this is a sweet little cafe and bakery. I have been there last week and had tasted few of the items which includes virgin pinacolada..brownie shake.. chicken envelope. Chicken mayonese sandwich.. roast chicken with onion focaccia and brownie with hot chocolate sauce.
I personally didnt like the pinacolada .. the brownie shake was as expected. It was nice. Chicken envelope looked exactly like an envelope.. Although it was pretty small in size it was fully stuffed with chicken (not like other chicken patties,where in other stores they put less chicken and more onion n capcium). I expected more mayonese in chicken mayonese sandwich. It was okay but not as good as the chicken sandwich i tasted at au bon pain,park street. The two items which i really liked was the focaccia which was served with olives..roasted chicken and onion with pizza sauce. It was too good. And the brownie with hot chocolate sauce .. it was as yumm as it sounds..
I took freash baked whole wheat bread which was really nice.
Coming to the ambiance,as i have mentioned its a sweet cafe with wonderful decor and perfect lightings.
I would love to visit this place soon and taste more of their items.
P.s- Two things i didnt like regarding this place are-
1) When the customer was present continious cleaning was under process which was really disturbing and irritating.
2) Some of the crowds..although it was nothing to do with the cafe..still..
One girl came up and started taking pic of the whole place when the cafe was full. It was so insenstive and i found my pic in her zomato profile which was completely unexpected. And that girl commented "you can see these pics in my review" when the owner asked about why is she clicking the pics.
I think the cafe should be more strict regarding these things. Its a matter of some one's privacy.

a beautiful place is indeed what can be said to describe this bakery. wonderful interiors, with a warm ambience, and even warm and cordial staffs, this place is surely going to occupy a special place in your heart. and what justifies an eatery more if the food is not satisfying your taste buds? cocoa bakery will live upto your expectations with their wide range of courses and delicious dishes they serve. being primarily a bakery you will get no chance to complaint about the number of delicacies it has to offer ( the yummy mud cake and delicate cheese pudding) and nobody should miss out on the chocolate cone. but besides the baked wonders, there are a number of focaccias, crepes, and other Italian dishes that  come at 'oh-so-affordable' prices. 
be it an outing with buddies or a surprise for someone special...this place is sure to do wonders.

My first unplanned visit today to this cute little cafe was a major mood-lifter. Went there with a friend for some good coffee and fell in love with the place. The decor, the ambience, the well-lit interiors were extremely heart-warming. Ordered Cafe Mochas with Chicken Envelopes. The mocha was lukewarm, so on request theyre-heated it, as I love my cuppa to be absolute hot. Enveloppe was decent enough. The ambience and well-behaved and friendly staff made up for that small loophole. They are primarily a bakery as thr name suggests, so they have a wide variety of bakery stuff ranging from breads, muffins,cookies,biscuits et al. Definitely looking forward for a re-visit.

I had visited this place quite a few weeks ago. The outlet is located very near to CCD and Uddyan Club. It's a vry small outlet with a seating capacity of around 15 ppl. It sells a variety of breads, cookies, and chocolates which are very tempting to look at. I didn't have any of those. My friend and i were very hungry, so we ordered a crepe and a Gratin. Both were served in quick time and we didn't have to wait for long. Both, the gratin and crepes were prepared really well. The gratin had a very generous layer of cheese onto it, and also the vegetables inside were well prepared. The crepe was served hot and the white cheesy sauce in which it was prepared was real tasty.
In all I enjoyed the food and looking forward to visit the place again. The food was worth the money spent.

Cocoa Bakery is a small and quaint bakery/eatery . They make several baked goods and have some inside seating. One could call it a mini cafe. The decor is really cute. Their cakes are really good quality and they remind you of what real baking is. 
However you'd be rolling the dice when it comes to food. Some items are a hit and some a definite miss. I ordered the egg wrap and explicitly asked them to make it with as little oil as possible. When it arrived, it was the exact opposite; smothered in oil which coats your face each time you take a bit. That can be counted as a definite miss. 
Hence giving it an average rating of 3.5 
Definitely opt for it if baked goods or desserts are what you're looking for but stay away from most of the food.

Quite neatly tucked into a side street off the main road. For people looking for a quite & cozy place, this is the goto. The chocolate brownie wqs delivered soft and with a deliciously inviting molten core. Visit this place just for the sake of that one. Otherwise it is a wonderful bakery, with fine dishes innumerable to wet your sweet tooth.
 The cold latte was okayish. Hoping that the blend was wrong for just that cuppa' . The Mocktails will re invigorate you.

Went there for the first time. Really like the interior. A small cute place with simple but good interior. But the food!!! Really didn't expect it to be so bad. I would say that Cocoa Bakery has many flaws. 1.The sitting area. Very small place for sure but the sitting arrangements are made in such a manner that it ends up having hardly 3-4 tables. 2.The service. No doubt the men there are very welcoming but the immense long time they take to get a simple dish like pasta done is very annoying. They took an hour to get us our 2 dishes that we had ordered. 3.Lastly and the most important is the food. Really not worth it. We had taken Smoked Barbeque Chicken and Chicken Penne Pasta in White Sauce. First of all they took more than an hour to serve us the dishes. Secondly, the taste. Horrible. The chicken was not properly smoked. It was like few small pieces of chicken and onion dipped in sone sauce. And the pasta was Ok. Nothing great or tasty. Rather less quantity. And seriously horrible taste. I cook better white sauce pasta than them. Literally bad!!

A cute place so to say. Very limited sitting options hence makes it quite crowded. Food is ok. But cakes are very innovative. Chocolates are yummy but more expensive than the international ones. More training needed for staff as they talk too much amongst themselves which you don't see in good cafe making the place very noisy.

Rajesh and Partho are awesome employees. Food is insane and very cheap! Best place, they offer you extra stuff also on requisition, what more can u expect in a small amount like 275? Perfect!!!

A place that I'm superduper fond of, Cocoa Bakery ( formerly known as Cocoa Cafe ), is located in new alipore in the lane bang opp. Cafe Coffee Day and Cakes. 
With a great location and no parking issues, cocoa cafe is a small and cozy cafe that has a very English feel to it. You step in and you feel like you're at a cafe in England. With heavy usage of wooden touch in the interior and great yellow lighting, cocoa bakery has a very welcoming ambience. 
Coming to the food, this place serves amazing continental food and brilliant sandwiches along with great non-alcoholic beverages. 
The chicken tetrazzini and the grilled chicken in red wine sauce are my personal favourites and a must try ! 
I love the cold coffee with ice cream which is also a must at cocoa bakery.
This is one such place where you could go on a date, go with family and your friends as well .. 
This place is very fortunate to have staff like Mr.Gurdip, a very softspoken and welcoming gentleman with a smile who will go that extra mile to help you out and make sure that customers go back home happy. 
With great location, ambience, decor, service, and superamazing food, cocoa bakery is one place regarding which I have no complaints and is a must visit for all foodies :) 
A meal for 2 would cost somewhere around Rs 600 which is great for the service and quality of the cafe.

My first review in zomato and it has to start with this delight of a place. It was actually my partner who spotted this place one evening and we decided to try it. The moment I entered it looked like the right place. I love their decor so minimal yet so perfect. We ordered for two coolers and the tiramisu loved all of them. And the bill was much less than the overpriced cafes we all know of. We obviously left with a smile. The next time was with my all my girlfriends the day before my birthday and we ordered everything from soups, roasted chicken, tetrazini, burger, sandwiches ,mojitos and deserts ofcourse. And to my surprise all of it was delicious.. the chicken tetrazini and brownie in choclate mud deserves a special mention. And again it was easier on the pocket too. Its one of my favourite places in kolkata for sure. So next time you are around the area do visit them and let it surprise you.

This small cafe cum bakery has one of the best cakes in kolkata. Their creme brulé, tiramisu, truffle are awesome. We had bought the mixed fruit birthday cake which is awesome. Their custom made cakes are superb. Definitely worth repeat visits.

This place was a zomato find for me n I went there craving desserts after a much depressing day at college.
The place might be a bit trying to find but is cute n d inside is bright n pretty.  .
We ordered a creme brulé n a choco mousse along with a barbecue chicken . .
The desserts were good but nothing extraordinary n d chicken was dissapointing . .being too saucy .

But then I had m second experience with the place . .it was my sister's birthday n she being the no-chocolate person . .we opted for a red velvet cake from d bakery .  
Since then . .I (the nothing-can-beat-chocolate person) have decided to have the very same on everyone's birthday.
It was amazing n delicious to say the least . .a cute red velvet cake with butter cream layering n frosting n pink rose icing all over.   YOU NEED TO TRY IT PEOPLE!!!!! I am in love. .<3

Attractive decor and a feel good factor makes this place a cool joint to hang out with friends. One can definitely try out their pastries and cakes, but there are a certain issues which I would like to point out: 
1. The brownie truffle and the mud pie tasted almost similar. No doubt that the mud pie was really good but the brownie was overheated and it also turned into a mud cake.
2. The cold coffee was a tad too plain. I mean it seemed like an iced coffee. May be the milk should have been toned a bit more.

The ultimate hub for all things pretty posh and delicious. Tucked in one of the quiet bylanes of New Alipore, this place comes with a rare English feel about it. The service was impeccable and so was the decor and ambience. Food was amazing and the desserts were delectable. Intend to go back from time to time. Keep up the good work!

We had the Sunday breakfast buffet. The sandwich, pastry, sausage were awesome. Background music was awesome and so was the lighting making the ambience of the place pretty nice.  The overall quality of food was pretty good considering its a buffet. The service however, I would like to mention was not up to the mark. We spent a  considerable amount time waiting and had to remind them from time to time about various stuff. A good place for young people .

We went for this "sunday breakfast buffet" here. I personally recommend it. They have nice varieties of items from cornflakes to bread toast , juice to coffee , pastries to sausages. It is perfect for an ideal happy breakfast. The ambience is soothing too. The service can be improved upon, as there are less staffs so you might have to sit for a while having an empty plate, waiting for something which is still in the kitchen. 
Overall , it is something worth trying. But i think a smile on the face of the staffs can improve! . It seems like they are not happy to see us there.

Visited last week with family.

Extremely nice decor and the ambiance pretty good. Display was good.

They have a good variety of pastries, cakes, patties, breads, chocolates, cookies. Along with the conventional bakery menu they also serve good continental dishes, salads, pastas, sandwiches and lot more.

We had following:

Veg. Quiche:  muffin-shaped with a filling of spinach and corn. The filling was wow.

Corn Puff: very good taste.

Black forest: kids loved it.

Eggless Chocolate Delite:  mouth melting.

Au Gratin with Bread: good in taste. Qty. is less but taste made it up.

Grilled Italian Veg:  enjoyed it .

This place is little unknown to people but I am sure the products they have, this place can easily become quite a rage. The service is top notch and the staff very friendly and courteous, makes your experience even better.

Need to taste few more things on next visit.

Till, then bye.

Dropped by this cute quaint cafe today,looks like a parisian cafe from outside and is done up well with quiry onliners framed and put up on the walls.Bang opposite to the New Alipore CCD..
Started with red velvet cake,cold coffee and hot cafe mocha.The coffees were pretty good,however the red velvet cake was a complete let down,it was dry and tasteless.
Then ordered mango pudding which tasted good,although would like to mention that they have an immense variety on their display racks and this place is easy on the pocket as well.
Would definitely visit again to try their savouries!!

A small cosy place with simple and fresh decor. Had gone for desserts. Tried Brownie in a Bowl (was like any other hot chocolate brownie with ice-cream ) and their pretty famous Monte Carlo (was good but a tad bit on the nutty side) Those who like nuts should surely opt for it.  Will drop by again to try their savoury dishes. It is worth a visit :)

This small place tucked in a corner is really adorable and serves up great food! We had ordered a chicken tetrazinni which was yummy and a spaghetti pasta, which we loved equally. The creme brulee could have been better and we were slightly disappointed. The ginger mocktail was nice as well. The staff was courteous and polite and the ambience is so soothing. This place just makes one feel good! ☺

I found this place on zomato while searching for some nice bakery shops and decided to give it a try on the occassion of my parents anniversary.Its not that difficult to find if one knows where new alipore ccd is.What i noticed is extremely nice decor and the ambience was pretty good.They had a variety of items available but the portion sizes are pretty small as compared to the price.  The cakes were beautiful looking and there were a lot of variety,but the sizes are too small and price is on the higher end.But they were fresh and very spongy n moist.A visit is definately a must but for people looking for cakes which cost them less yet doesnot compromise on the taste,well this isnot the place.If they increase the portion sizes,I guess it will solve all the problems.

Went to this place as it is near to my place. The staff were courteous and the place was clean. It was lunch time and I ordered for a grilled chicken salad and cold tea. The salad was just awful. The vegetables were warm as if they were just brought in from the sun. The chicken was ok. The salad dressing was all wrong….. there was only oil and too much salt and nothing else. It looked very unappetizing. They only gave a fork (no knife) to eat it with. No bread. And the tea is better not discussed. Please do know that salad  is a dish in itself. So one has to be served with bread, and if it is not done so, it should be mentioned to the customer. I was hoping this would be good experience so I can go and have lunch sometimes here, but sorry its just not upto the mark. Just a little bit of patience and diligence should put in place though.

Thus place might look very attractive from the outside but there's a different story to tell from inside. Their way of doing business is very unprofessional. House maids and servants are entering and exiting the place from the same place as we are. The waiters aren't well trained. They lack hospitality. 
Talking about the food, the food is not something very new or exquisite, food isn't served hot the way it should be and it lacks taste.

I had recently gone to Cocoa Bakery for a quick bite. We ordered the Spinach Mushroom Crepe and the Italian Sandwich. 
Our first impression was good because of the cosy ambience. However, our experience turned out to be a disaster later. Firstly, the tables weren't clean. Then, the waiters weren't well trained. Now coming to the food, the layer of cheese on the mushroom crepe was burnt. The sandwich was like just any other sandwich. We wished to order some mocktails but later changed our mind because of the slow service. I wish the place had more well trained staff.

Decent food , cozy place but the  issue is that I could not eat in peace, hence enjoying a meal for others too could be a task.. Loud customers coming to buy pastries and ordering cakes flutter around your table if you happen to sit close to their counter and its very unpleasant. Avoid sitting close to the counter . I ordered grilled chicken but the red wine sauce was overdone.

Cocoa bakery is a small bakery cum cafe in New Alipore which has done its interiors well giving it an elite touch! 
I have visited the place twice and found the food to be average...I had ordered mushrooms on toast, penne pasta in white sauce and cold coffee which were nice but nothing great..their mint mojito was made well..
On my next visit we ordered a veg pattie which was okaish and a cheesecake pudding which wasn't good at all! It didn't seem fresh and had been kept refrigerated for a long tym! 
Cocoa bakery is doing a great job with its cakes (chocolate sponge ,mousse, truffle tried..)
No doubt abt any of the chocolate cakes or pastry!
But the other stuffs are average..
The items are quite fairly priced but the taste can be improved..
Overall it's a nice place to chill with friends or to satisfy a late evening cake craving!

Cocoa Bakery is a rare gem tucked away in a quiet corner of New Alipore, easy to locate, just opposite to New Alipore, CCD I came to know about this cafe through Zomato. The photos tempted me to try out this place and honestly the place has delighted me! 
The exterior is that of a cute cafe usually found in each and every corner in Paris, the space inside is a little small but it looks very cosy. Warm nice colours and interesting posters adorn their wall, the place has a nice vibe, well lit and nicely decorated, their shelves are full of freshly baked breads and lovely desserts made from scratch, they have a bakery at the back of this restaurant and everything served is fresh and right from their kitchen. 
We ordered for one cold coffee ( creamy and delicious ) lemon iced tea (refreshing and just perfect ) a chicken and cheese sandwich - this one was amazing and is a must try for any cheese lover, filled with minced chicken and oozing with melting mozzarella cheese it was grilled to perfection and came with a generous portion of French fries , a chicken envelope ( very nice seasoning and lovely crust ) and last but not the least their RED VELVET CAKE! This needs a special mention for sure, creamy and smooth this just melts in your mouth, I was too full to try their other delicious looking desserts but one should and MUST try their red velvet cake, it's amazing and it's better than any other confectionary in town. This place is little unknown to people but I am sure the products they have, this place can easily become quite a rage. The service is top notch and the staff very friendly and courteous, makes your experience even better. I loved the food and ambience out here and I think everyone should try out this place. I can guarantee this won't disappoint at all.

I can vouch that they have, arguably, among the finest Grilled Chicken sandwiches this side of our river! Two firm, sizeable triangular sandwiches with melt-in-the-mouth chicken and a generous helping of crisp, fresh fries and a little clutch of really light coleslaw! And no, their's isn't the kind that fills you up and gives you chicken-flavoured burps for after-taste! The cold-coffee is frills-free and a great way to wash down the sandwich on a sweltering afternoon! The place is beautifully done up - almost like a selfie addict's perfect den and I promise to go back very soon before my craving drives me insane!

Visited this place late afternoon despite of empty house the service was very poor. Had to call twice to clean up the table then get up call again to place the order by the time food comes you are done with your appetite. Food may be good but if the wait is never ending it is not worth. I suggest them to increase the staff and encourage them to wait the tables where as people get up and place the order here. Not worth

I always go here with my family. It reminds of a English café every time I enter Cocoa Bakery. People are very friendly and like family out there. The area is perfect too. Could not be better. :D

One of the best French style eateries around town. Visited today evening and was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful quaint ambience. Had spinach & mushroom crêpe, which was doused in delectable, delicately flavored cheese sauce. Also had smoked b'bque chicken with a wonderful smokiness to fill your palate. The sauce was so wonderful we ordered cheese croissants just to mop up the remaining sauce which was too good to waste. And this place boasts an impressive array of desserts, of which the red velvet pastry is just right, with a hint of saltiness in the cream cheese frosting. The only letdown is the macaroons, but can be easily overlooked in respect to other wonderful items. Thank you for the lovely experience, will keep coming back for more.

Finally my search for a good Bakery with reasonable price is over. The decoration & ambiance is mind blowing, though its a bit small in space. The staffs are very well mannered & always ready to help. I am extremely impressed by their attitude. I have come to know about this place from Zomato only & decided to give this place a visit. Finally I visited there on 03/03/2015. I bought a few items from them which are Brownie Balls, Red Velvet Pastry, Truffle Pastry, Tiramisu Pastry, Nolen Gur Soufflae & Strawberry Cheese Cake. I was blown up by the taste of Nolen Gur Soufflae & Strawberry Cheese Cake. They were out of this world. Awesome in one word. The other items were also satisfactory. Thank you Cocoa Bakery for making my day. Me & my family members thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. Dying to taste other items such as Pineapple Pudding, Ferrero Rocher Pastry, Baked Alaska, Cup Cakes Chicken Crunchy & Fish Florentine. I also enjoyed the pics of the birthday cakes that they make. 
Surely going for another visit very soon to try other items. Definitely count me from now as one of your regular visitor. You are the very best.

This small bakery in New Alipore is one of its kind. A 20 seater cosy place. The ambience and decor of this place is just too perfect for a bakery. The staff was very respectful and cooperative.
We ordered Chicken and onion Focaccia, Cheese and Chicken Burger, Herb and Chicken Crepe, Grilled Chicken wrap and Grilled Chicken with Parsley rice (not in the menu)
Focaccia was pretty tasty. Had the flavour.
Burger was kind of normal. Nothing to be fascinated about.
Crepe was heaven since I'm a cheese lover.
Wrap had the same filling as the crepe, so a little disappointed.
Grilled Chicken without Wine Sauce was standout dish. The sweet n sour taste was apt for my taste buds.
A must visit place if you're in New Alipore area.

I went there on reading reviews on zomato. It's a nice bakery. Quite small to enjoy a dine-in. The food and the shake was average. Nothing great. Even their monte carlo was average. However, their kit-kat tart was amazing and their cheese loaf that I enjoyed for my breakfast the next day was nice. The other pastries I tried were nice. Overall a nice bakery.

Cocoa Bakery is something very different from what New Alipore has to offer. In the opposite lane of CCD, a small little cafe that is so beautiful, it'll definitely catch your eyes. Food here is really good and desserts are amazing, specially Brownie in Bowl... Lot's of sweet memories have been created here, and infact I was there just yesterday, will revisit soon. Overall it's a beautiful place highly recommended.

I was impressed by the interiors the very first moment I entered the place,I know the place through my father as he someday ordered a beautifully decorated yummy birthday cake on my birthday... After that only I visited the place...before a couple of years...I appreciate their quality which is quite fresh.and have a good range of pastries as I love them...had some of the wraps and desserts from their menu didn't remember the name though but if talking about the pastries mixed fruit,chocolate truffle and strawberry are my favourite though some seasonal... Had their sandwich also its softer and tasty to eat...so you leave the bakery with a choco happy heart::))__--

Location: In the lane opposite CCD, New Alipore.

India is known as the land of festivals and Holi is one of the major festivals, also known as the festival of colors or the festival of sharing love. Holi is celebrated with much pomp and marked with the play of colors, colored water balloon attacks, dance and an array of food & drink items. Every festival in India is observed with such merriment that it also includes the sharing of joy with your near and dear ones. Such so, because every festival is somewhat a signification & celebration of the victory of the good over evil. This sharing is something that sets apart the festivals from each other. Every festival, people send their loved ones blessings and happiness wrapped in a box full of sweets or fruits depending upon the festival being celebrated. But, this age old practice like all others has stepped into the modern world and has undergone a makeover!
The sweets, dry fruits and meal spreads have been replaced with the new age desserts. Baked items are the new in of the era. Brownies, cakes, pastries, muffins & cupcakes are what most people prefer these days.
Though many stick to the traditional style of sending across sweets accompanied along with a bottle of Thandai, but, with the advent of this new change, how could one be behind?
The new generation have started opting for the change and the food industry isn't behind either. 
Cocoa Bakery, a two year old bakery is one of those who have aggressively absorbed this trend and are bound to have a first-mover advantage. This place, strategically located at one of the best localites, spells of a calm and contemporary style of café where one could sit for hours and unwind at a relaxed pace. The AMBIANCE of this place does give you a warm feel and could leave you in the best of moods. From the strategically utilized space to the elegant European touch, everything would remind you of the old days of the English world. And, the spotlights to the upholstered seating & furniture adds as a tangent in the modern world.
Was invited for the launch of their Holi goodies over high tea. And, it was a sight to see. The usual bakery items being young enough, got a color splash as a makeover and the known-old savory ones accompanying them as their loved ones to compliment. The gift items were priced at a pocket-friendly range to not burn a hole in the pockets. One shouldn't miss on to this new trend! 
The boxes had an assortment of muffins, macaroons, chocolates, cupcakes, cakes, pizzas, puffs & more. 
The high tea at the launch had a nice buffet spread of the following:

- Ice Tea (Welcome Drink)
The ice tea was nicely prepared and was refreshing enough in the heat.

- Pasta Alfredo
The slightly under-boiled penne along with fresh veggies was tossed in a well prepared Bechamél sauce. The seasoning & texture of the dish was spot-on and oh boy! It did impress. Was absolutely delicious to taste.
Highly recommended.

- Vegetable Focaccia
The flat-oven baked bread was topped with freshly cut vegetables (broccoli, zucchini, bell peppers, black olives & tomato) and a decent amount of cheese. The focaccia toppings did compliment, but, the bread was too dry & stiff to impress.

- Paneer Tikka Puff
The puff had a flavorful filling of well-marinated & cubed pieces of cottage cheese. Though, the puff could have been served warm, the taste did not let the little flaw take its toll.

- Mixed Fruit Pastry
Oh-so-delicious! is what one would end up saying right at the first bite. The well balanced sponginess & creaminess of their signature pastry did the trick. The glaze on the fresh fruits added as a plus to the look of the layered pastry. An absolute delicacy. Recommended.

- Cold Coffee
A mild flavored blend with the right balance of ingredients did impress.

The courteous & friendly staff were always on their toes to not let a single disappointed show up on the face of their guests/customers.

• The owners, Mr. & Mrs. Lakhmani had been a great, attentive and warm hosts. Their idea of introducing the baked items as a gift to your near and dear ones instead of the usual trend of sweets is bound to hit the right spot and be the trend-setter. Hope to see such a change in every possible festival!

• An assorted box of their Holi Hamper was given as a vote of thanks wherein every item tasted delicious & fresh.

Overall the place gave a warm feel and a beautiful experience to take back.
- Happy Holi people & All the Best for the introduced trend! :)

A wonderful bakery at New Alipore. The branch manager was very cordial
and suggested us grilled chicken with wine sauce that was really very good. 
The fish n chips, which is generally a very common preparation,  also had a special touch. However my favourite was the chicken crêpe with herbs.
The patisserie section was also wow.
They have a takeaway facility and they pack the food very well. Overall a very impressive experience.  Shall definitely visit again.

Being a coffee and café person I was keen to find a place apart from the much popular coffee franchise as I was almost tired visiting them and tht is exactly when COCOA BAKERY happened. It was the day before my 3rd marriage anniversary that me and my husband headed to raise a caffeine toast to us and this place was just purrfect. A little tricky to locate this cute little café was really too cosy and warm …I absolutely loved the interiors . we just had some coffee and muffins but they also had this food menu but we were told that kitchen closes by 8 ..so I guess I will make my second visit very soon to have a slice of their kitchen as well !:)..ah and the best part it is easy on your pocket .

A newly opened joint in the heart of newalipore, located inside the lane just opposite to new alipore's cafe coffee day. Just from the entrance porches, this place offers an adorable and elegant decor. The interiors are cozy with an artistic touch, the extravagant wallpapers, the gorgeous mappled floor designs everything makes this outlet heavenly.  it is sufficiently spacious and offers cozy and damn comfortable cushions, pouffees and all to accommodate sitting arrangements. The ambience is soothing with dim lights and melodical music being played at the back ground. They have a good variety of pastries, cakes, patties, breads, chocolates, cookies. They offer beverages in variety as well. Along with the conventional bakery menu they also serve good continental dishes, salads, pastas, sandwiches and other succumbing main courses too. The quality and taste are pretty good but some of their offerings could be a bit better. The staffs are courteous and have sufficient expertise in this field. The prices are on the moderately reasonable. Overall a nice place to savor delicious pastries and snacks and specially the flamboyant decor and cozy ambience is the added advantage which takes the complete experience into a whole new and worth cherishing level.

This is a quaint little cafe that had been on my to-visit list for a month now and we finally had a chance on Saptami. It was nice to find a place in the Puja rush where no one bothered you with pushy 'Bill, madam?' requests. In fact, on all three days that we visited, there was at least one table empty of any patron. The place is perfect for a date with the tables tucked away in the corners, behind showcases that makes you feel like you're in a space of your own. The small candles on each table help too. The decor is classy- the shelf full of baked goodies and glass bowls full of colorfully wrapped chocolates, the glass showcase with a wedding cake replica, small figurines, the street-gas-light like lamps and plump leather sofas all fit in beautifully in the small cafe.

We had a Danish. It was baked well with layers of flaky pastry swathed in light sugar syrup. There was a small puddle of lime curd in the middle with slices of plum. It is very pretty and decent to taste too.

The Red Velvet Cake was really delicious. The cake itself was moist and dense, which is the perfect texture of red velvet cake. The cream cheese frosting had a hint of white chocolate that I really liked. The surface of the cake was covered in red colored rosettes of the same frosting. It looked exquisite and tasted just as good. The only tiny complaint I have is that the surface of the icing was a little bit dried.

The cake me and my boyfriend have already had about 6 of between us is the Chocolate Pastry. It is SO GOOD! And it is really inexpensive (30INR). Two tiered chocolate cake covered in chocolate buttercream that is slightly salted and covered in thick, sticky chocolate ganache. It is brilliant to taste and thanks to the salted buttercream, you never get a cloying taste in your mouth even after eating two slices. We just loved it and we'd be back again tomorrow to have a couple more!

Cosy little place... Bread lover's paradise..   Their brownies are to die for! All deserts are to be tasted.. My son's a fan of their hot chocolate and many a times we've walked down to Cocoa Bakery for a quick and relaxed dinner of salads & crepes. The ambience makes you feel as if you're in one of the Kodai or Darjeeling bakeries/cafes.
Prices could have been less steep but the flavours, quality and ambience make up for it.

Had visited this particular bakery shop a month ago, situated at the lane just in front of CCD and Cakes this place is sure to give them healthy competition. The interior of this place is pretty vibrant. If my counting was right I think it can host about 14 people at a time. The place is pretty small but the owner has really arranged it well. Its different than all the monotonous bakeries that we come across and that sure is a bonus point for this joint. The service seems to be a bit slow but that's acceptable as it had just started out. Prices are comparably lower considering the location of the shop. They could however work on the music being played, got real distracting at times. The peach tea is one of the best that I have tried and a definite recommendation and the grilled chicken is also worth mentioning. Give the chocolate shots a try, much more satisfactory than the ones you get across the street. Overall I would like to visit this place again and would recommend others to give it a chance.

This time I am very much disappointed....i have ordered a 1 pound red velvet cake and 3 chicken salads and get it delivered to my home...they have taken Rs.10 extra for each of the salad packaging box, which is nothing but normal aluminium foil box....at the very last moment they called and told that i have to give the taxi fare for the delivery boy as he will carry a cake...its for sure that the delivery boy didn't take any taxi and took Rs.80 which is much more than the normal taxi fare for that distance....now if I ignore these things and come to food then very much disappointed with the cake...the topping of cake was very soft though it was in the freezer...the taste is not as good as I tasted for the first time... Chicken salad was ok ok...expecting better next time...

The photos in Zomato gave me the urge to visit this place and experience a neatly decked up cafe with great food and an applaudable service. Located inside an alley this place may be a bit difficult to spot. It is opposite to the CCD of New Alipore.
The exterior of the cafe is very welcoming with yellow lights and transparent glasses, that give you a sneak peak of the interior which is equally good if not better.
Cocoa bakery reflects the art of fusion by bringing together  the best of a cafe and a bakery. The interior is small but warm and the owners have put in a lot of effort to make it stand out among the crowd of cafes and bakeries in Kolkata. The soft music adds to the ambience by making it a soothing one. Please see the photos and you will surely not want to miss this place.
We ordered Grilled chicken in red wine, Lemon Cucumber Sparkz, Chef special salad and a black forest pastry. The grilled chicken was immaculate, and had everything right about it. The red wine sauce made the flavour exquisite. The lemon cucumber sparkz was feathery light and delightful. The pastry was also to our satisfaction. It had a layer or strawberry that made the pastry complete. My only complaint was regarding the salad. It had nothing special about it and the dressing could have been better. Moreover the taste was not cohesive at all. There are far better places to have a salad. That apart, the experience was one to be satisfied with. 

Keep up the great work.

I go here very often since its a stone's throw away from my place, sometimes just to buy fresh bread (love their French loaf @ just Rs. 35/-). They have a very cute collection of cake slices, croissants and chocolates. The people there are very helpful and courteous. 

Their Brownie in a bowl is a must-have. 

I have been craving to try their Sunday breakfast spread (250 odd bucks per head), but can't manage to get out of my Sunday morning laziness. Will try to upload everything on the Sunday menu once I succeed. 

Only thing they need improving is the seating capacity. They can easily accommodate more people if the arrange their furniture properly.

I think one of the best coffee shop/bakery in New alipore area... After my office I went there and ordered Grilled chicken sandwich... it was just awesome and fabulous... I also took their some home made chocolates for which they are famous for...Regarding the ambience its perfect and excellent as if m sitting  in a coffee shop in London... U must listen their soft/relaxing lounge instrumental music... after a tiring day i was feeling very much relaxed seriously... the waiter was very much well behaved and helpful.. Only thing they need to improve is their washroom which I think is not hygenic and a bad odour was there in the washroom... A must visit bakery for everyone who stays in south kolkata specially...

Visited this place this evening....the ambience is very cozy and they've got cool songs playing in the background with lots of humour art. We ordered peach iced tea, fish and chips, smoked BBQ chicken, grilled chicken, chicken quiche and a veg quiche. The peach iced tea was really refreshing but a tad bit too sweet...won't recommend that to the diabetics! The chicken dishes were real good with quite a lot of improvisation been done on the smoked BBQ chicken, which turned out to be delicious. The one bad dish was the fish and chips....the fish seemed stale and had a awful smell. The staff are pretty unresponsive and very slow to serve. Fun place to relax but only once in a while

Wonderful place!! Super deco, a very different look, excellent interior lighting too.
Most importantly, serves great (bean/grain) coffee (still a rare thing in Kolkata). Great menu and not expensive at all! Very polite and nice people to help you out.
 I would only change one thing, they can make space for a few more tables (to go with their very urban look), and get rid of one of the good looking but too big couch-formations!

Cocoa Bakery - Girl's, You cannot miss this. 
=======================================
Intro: 

Cocoa Bakery has two branches if you guy's don't know about it. One is in the Punjab Club and one has been recently opened in New Alipore couple of months back. I had a lot of plans to visit this particular bakery which is just located in the lane opposite to CCD, New Alipore. The place is small and more like a girly place with breads and cookies all around. It's fun to visit such places which are usual breaks from the usual heavy food. The place is a good one having well done interiors with soft lighting and slow instrumental music playing in the background(Just as i like). The seats were pretty comfortable too. 
=======================================
Food and drinks:

Ordered a couple of things here: - 

1) Corn Puff - It was served to me with Del monte ketchup. It is ditto same as Cakes puff. I did not find any difference in it. It was good yet greased with oil. 
2) Peach Ice Tea - I loved it. Though i was not served a straw to sip in my ice tea. Had haphazardly broken(not crushed) ice pieces in top. The tea was superbly amazing. 
3) Veg Turnover - It had a continental touch. I personally did not like it at all.
4) Brownie with nuts on top - It was good. But, i had have better brownies before.

 My bill came to 180 Dot which i found is cheap. 
=======================================
Pros: -

1) Courteous and knowledgable staffs.
2) Ambience is a win win.
3) Prices are very reasonable. 
4) Opened in a posh location 

Cons:- 

1) The turnover could have been much better. It did not taste good. 
=======================================
Suggestions: - 

1) Implement more ice tea's. Only peach and lemon is not sufficient. 
2) Oil content a little on the higher side. If kept low, would do wonders. 
=======================================
Summary:

Ambience 4/5
Food presentation 4/5
Food quantity 4/5
Food quality 4/5
Hospitality 4/5
Taste 4/5 ( Except the veg turnover) 
Value for money 4/5
=======================================
Conclusion:

Will definitely visit Cocoa Bakery in the near future. :)

I have visited this place twice... Their Sunday breakfast buffet is really good.. One of the best sausages and egg preparations in town... Their a-la-carte continental dishes are also very well prepared... Do try their fish n chips and pastas... Extremely hygienic and a wonderful ambience... Very friendly staff but they must be a little more informed about the items on their own menu... Overall I have had an excellent experience on both my visits... A wonderful small, cosy and well furnished place with great food... Keep it up!!!

One would wonder why to believe a review of a person who is a non-foodie... Well I would like to answer that by saying - u need to see someone to know if he is a foodie or not... U can't get a tag from Zomato to decide if ur worth the coronation... So please just read on for ur own GK(XD) - 
Without doubt, a lakhmani is born into a family of monsters who live and earn, to eat and scream.... I guess they bellow away everyday just to digest, so they can stuff themselves like a turkey in Thanksgiving.(If u haven't had a turkey I would advice u to visit bistro by the park next Christmas). 
All that said and done... My credentials for this comment is my 'birth right'... :P

COCOA BAKERY is a high end bakery built by people with years of experience(One just cannot open a shop overnight). This decade old business had opened serving a very confidential crowed that loved whatever they othered. Long ago <anonomous> shop begged to sell their GOODS. Following which the bakery expanded from a kitchen to a flat and 5 years hence into a indie-shop. What point I am trying to drill through the reader is that ( If u stil haven't got it)  this shop event tough is a new shop it has a old experienced kitchen supporting it's foundations. There are many new versatile dishes in the menue! Even I haven't gourmet-ed (A term of my own coining) some of them yet. Prising time and money from my busy schedule and my light wallet, like a junkie would for Ganja, I visit the shop as often as I can just to recieve the lively and warm hearted welcome from the owner. But mind you don't take that warm hearted welcome as a sign of desprateness because the owner is a gentlelady who has sponged from a very elegant grooming since childhood. 
The location, quite off the radar when it comes to a new bakery. Is purposely chosen to attract their original  customers.  Which as it seems they have been able to managed quite successfully.(By now you would have had to figure out that me/someone very close to me is one of their original customers.) 
So anytime u get a pregnant ladys' hormonal urge - "I want to have something chocolatey." shut ur brain  and tell your husband / boyfriend to take u to COCOA and turn that hour into the most romantic time ever spent as the ambience will never let you down let alone your order

Great food. Lovely ambiance. Interior is just wow. Service a bit slow. Mains a bit on the expensive side. For those who might face difficulty locating it, get down at rabindra sarobar metro and take a auto towards New Alipore. Get down at Taratala. Ask around for Cafe Coffee Day. Its steps away from that. Zomato has not yet uploaded the updated menu yet. So posting that as well.

Must have Coffee with dessert Monte Carlo. baked Alaska... Also dont forget the mini meals crepes and fish with starter sauce!!

The ambience around made me feel like the 'Patricians of Venice' with very inviting atmosphere where spontaneous conversations naturally take place.
