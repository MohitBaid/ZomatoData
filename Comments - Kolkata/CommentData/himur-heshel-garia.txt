was looking for a decent bengali lunch last week! My friend had orderered from here and found foods tasty but once I saw the prices, that seemed quite higher than the quality of the food. Otherwise its good. 

on the very next day I surprised my friends Ordering some homemade food from Taltala Biriyani & Caterer from swiggy and they were too good with their taste and quantity as well. Have a try guys! must recommended for people who prefer to have pocket friendly homemade lunch!

Very good experience. Food quality, taste was nice. If anyone wants good Bengali food, I would suggest to try this once. Sarse Ilish & Achari begun was really delicious.

Had planned for eating out on nabami but it started raining, so i was scanning zomato and came across this delivery restaurant, and it was definitely a good choice. We ordered ( infact I was helped by the entrepreneur herself in choosing the menu) basanti polao, gondhoraj chicken, doodh ilish and pabda tomato jhaal. All items were very neatly packed and delivered to us. The food tasted awesome. Looking forward to tasting other items on the menu.
Lastly, I was pretty surprised to find complementary Sandesh with the order.
Loved the gesture, "Himur Heshel"- Bengali food with a difference.

I personally have tasted their "twist of flavour". I must say Himur Heshel served genuinely delicious lunch and made our day special on a day when we hosted our uncle from the US. We all relished the food with nostalgia of old day's Bengali lunch menu. It's a must try if one wants to enjoy authentic Bengali food without going out.

Thank you, Himur Heshel.

In one word...mindblowing...if you want to taste genuine East Bengal cuisine...Heshel is the perfect choice...wide range of traditional dishes within an affordable price...taste wise...lajabab. Moreover the service being provided with a smile. 
Truely my puja season started with a Twist.
