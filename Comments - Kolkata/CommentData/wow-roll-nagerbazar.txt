Well here the rolls are ordinary. Nothing special is there. It charges 5 or 10 rs more than the rest of the local shops. If you try the cheese one then it's something really tasty.

Wow Roll is nothing but just the extended part of Hotel Taaj. The place is very easy to access, just on the Saatgachi more. I took one egg roll today for testing purpose but that turned out to be not so good. Probably its the lemon inside which was squeezed more than it was supposed to. No such place to sit and have your food instead you have to go for takeaway.

A roll centre located in nager bazar area. Good for a quick bite. Take away is only option. Varieties of rolls are available. The cheese chicken roll was really good. Service was fast. Pocket friendly.

Wow roll is a roadside joint located at Nagerbazar. 

No sitting arrangenents.

Quick service.

Tried special Chicken Roll , which was tasty with good stuffings inside and paratha was soft & crispy. One  roll is enough to relieve hunger pangs.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

আড্ডা মারার জায়গার পাশেই , তাই মাঝে মাঝে হানা দি ।  ছোটর ওপর , বসে খাবার জায়গা নেই , রোল এর স্বাদ ভালই , চিকেন রোল বেশি ভালো লেগেছে । বসে খাবার জায়গা থাকলে ভালো হত বলে মনে হয়েছে ।
