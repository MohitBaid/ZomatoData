Its good to know that IT Sector in Kolkata have such great restaurants, So people working over here can enjoy good dinner or drink after being tired all day in office. Red Express is one of them having very nice ambiance offering good food and full fledged bar experience.

We were treated with their new Seafood Menu and office combos.

General Jumbo Prawn :
--------------------------------------
Why I'm writing about this dish on top when I can’t even eat it? Just after looking at the garnishing of this dish someone can definitely tell its their Signature dish, they have worked that hard to make it look super premium. I wonder if it looks this good then how it would taste like?

After seeing this dish I am thinking about to consult with a Doctor? If any Doctor out there reading this, please help me out!
 
Sergeant Squid : 
----------------------------
Now something what I can eat. Squid is must when taking about seafood starters. It was crispy fried tossed with diced spring onion, bell peppers and tomatoes along with black peppers. It was lovely as a starter.

Major Pomfret :
----------------------------
Pomfret is one of the greatest item to grill. You will curse the fish bones because they come in between the way of enjoying this dish. Fish lovers will find another way to enjoy this.

Drunken Turkey :
-------------------------------
Oh Man! This Turkey gone real high. Sliced Turkey pieces was highly tossed in rich wine. Here alcohol was overpowering the turkey in taste and flavour, so its not for everyone. But alcohol lovers may find it the dish to enjoy.

Lebanese BBQ Turkey :
------------------------------------
6 pieces of Turkey served in kebab standard. This pieces were well grilled in bbq with lots of spices on body and soft inside.

Chilli Crab Claws :
---------------------------------
Crab in different avetar. It was hot and spicy with crispy shell of crabs to be felt with the flavour of crab meal coming from inside all served in well garnished condition. 

Chelo Kebab :
----------------------------
The legendary dish made in their style with Chicken Malai, Tikka and Lasooni Kebab all of 2 pieces that was flavourful and tasty. Rice was plain, a bit of more buttery touch could have made it much better. Of-course a pouched egg was on top, but green chutney and salad with it made it look bit different than usual.

Mutton Biryani :
------------------------------
I wasn’t expecting such good Biryani from a place like this, but they proved me wrong. This Biryani wasn’t just colourful, this was a blast of flavours. Totally new flavours that made it brilliant to taste.

Veg Indian Combo :
-----------------------------------
A combo is a must to do business in office areas. This not only give the customers taste of different dishes for an affordable price tag, also it comes as a full package when delivered. It was colourful and packed with their great dishes.

Non Veg Chinese Combo : 
-----------------------------------------
Another combo, same rule applies here too but this one is for Non-Veg lovers. Do I need to tell that this also looked delicious and fully packed with their best dishes?

Mocktails :
-------------------------
I will not say anything, just scroll down and see how colourful were those Mocktails. All of them were mainly based on pineapple juice that is always refreshing.

Final Words :
-------------------------
Overall our experience at Red Xpress was very good, from the foods to a decent dining it fulfilled our expectations. Recommended to those working nearby and want to spent quality time after office. Even if you aren’t from nearby then also there’s no harm visiting this place.

People usually in Tech hub area like to have quick bite snacks during their office hours but when it comes about full lunch or dinner or family occasion, they usually try to avoid the crowd of Tech area and go to some restaurant where food as well as peace is their main concern. But it is quite common that we lose something when we are in crowd or doing anything in hurry. Don’t know about the other stuffs, but when it comes about a perfect dining place, people usually lose their attention over some hidden gems. Red Xpress is such kind of restaurant which is really a hidden gems in Saltlake Sec – V area. So let’s come and explore this place.

Location, Ambiance - The restaurant situated at the Bengal Intelligent Park, Sector V, Kolkata. It is just min10 walking distance from the College More towards infinity More. In terms of spacing, the restaurant is huge and it serves both A la carte & buffet spread. The dark ambiance, glass fountain adds some serious mood in your dining experiences. The well-equipped bar section is the blessing for all alcoholic person. So come to the main attraction, food section.

Food – Few days ago, Red Xpress launched their new menu by their new chef & we’re lucky that we got an opportunity to try some of the dishes from their new menu section. The food we tried were –

>> Chelo Kebab (3.5/5.0) – The presentation of the platter was quite different from traditional Chelo Kebab platter. It had 6 chicken kebab (2 pieces of Malai kebab, Tikka Kebab & Lasooni Kebab) but unfortunately sausage or mutton seekh kebab was missing. Rice was okay but buttery touch was missing. Egg omelet with sunny side up was beautifully served but the green chutney addition to the platter feel little excess from my side. Overall okay. 

>> Veg Platter – The platter consists of 2 butter nun with 3 types of side items (Mixed Vegetable, Butter Paneer & Dal Makhani) & salad. My fellow pure vegetarian foodie friend ordered this one & it was good, as per his word. 

>> General Jumbo Prawn (5.0/5.0) – What I love about this dish is the presentation of it. Well-cooked Jumbo prawn was served with little gravy consist of Pak Choi leaves. Fine sliced cucumber & tomato added the extra beautiful texture of the dish. The prawn was full juicy & little burnt grill flavor really touch my taste buds.

>> Sergeant Squid (4.5/5.0) – Deep fried squid tossed with fine diced onion, tomato & spring onion. Tastes better when it serves hot because in hot condition you will get the crispy feeling. Overall a great item as a starter. 

>> Major Pomfret (4.0/5.0) – Whole grilled spicy pomfret was served with green chutney. The pomfret was well marinated but the mustard sauce rich gravy somehow suppressed the burnt flavor of the fish. Overall okay. 

>> Chilly Crab Claws (4.5/5.0) – 5 pieces of Crab claws were well cooked with chilly tomato sauce. The claws were full of crab meat which was soft. Like it.

>> Lebanese Barbecue Turkey (4.5/5.0) – 6 pieces of mid sized turkey meat were beautifully served. The meats were juicy as well as spicy. Barbeque grilled aroma added the extra touch of beauty to the dish. Recommended item here.

>> Drunken Turkey (3.5/5.0) – Yes, the turkey is totally drunk by alcohol. The item is a semi gravy one. Turkey was well tossed with the gravy with sautéed veggies like broccoli, colourful capsicum. Overall okay but was expecting something more.

>> Mutton Biryani (4.0/5.0) – Well, this is every Bong’s crush. Aromatic rice with 2 mid sized mutton piece and one aloo but surprisingly no egg was there. The handi of Biryani comes with raita. The quantity of rice was good for 2 persons and what I love most about this dish is the oily portion of the dish. It was less oily but yet tasty. Lovely.

>> Veg Combo – My friend ordered this one for parcel which consist of portion of rice, two pieces of nawabi roti and three types of side dish (same as my friend ordered for dine in) & salad. Well the quantity is sufficient for one person.

>> Non-Veg Combo (3.5/5.0) – The combo consists of a portion of Egg fried rice with little spring onion garnishing on top, chilly chicken, sautéed veggies, cabbage & darsaan. Although the combo is enough for one person, still I think one extra non veg item will go well in the place of cabbage. Overall okay.

>> Mocktail (3.0/5.0) – We ordered 4 different types of drinks but none of them was too much excellent. The Blue lagoon & the Cranberry one was the best among all of them.

**<<The Combo items are available only for parcel, not for dine in inside of the restaurant>>**

So in conclusion I will say Red Xpress is one of the best budget family restaurant at Saltlake Sec V area. With good quality food & warm hospitality, the restaurant will surely melts your heart down. Overall a good dining experiences from our side.

Red Xpress has revamped itself from Red hot chilli pepper and I had my eyes to visit this place from quite long now.This new year I dropped at this restaurant to have a taste of their new seafood fare.

The ambience gives you an old school romantic feel with the walls and seating done in red with a back drop of large glass panes.The huge space has been set up.neatly with a well stocked bar at one end and a beautiful glass fountain on the other.There is seating arrangement outside where you can enjoy the cold weather with a hot bowl of noodles

The chef has put together a range of dishes using the fresh local produce.The result--a plate that is fresh and packed with flavours.On my plate today ,i had

🍁General Jumbo Prawn--the plate lived up to its name with a huge prawn topped with a delicious gravy
🍁Major Pomfret--The pomfret was cooked to perfection with a lot of spices
🍁Seargent Squid--the squid were fried crisp seasoned with pepper and salt.It is a recommendation
🍁Chilli crab Claws--the claws were absolutely spot on being meaty and spicy affair
🍁Drunken Turkey--This one was just too drunken for my taste.I could barely manage a spoonful so always specify your need
🍁Lebanese Barbeque Turkey--Succulent juicy chunks of turkey flavoured with spices
🍁Chelo Kebab--The chelo kebab tasted a bit bland as per my taste
🍁Mutton Biriyani--The biriyani was the star of the day with light fluffy rice and a big chunk of meat sitting in the bowl.

We also tasted the veg and non vegetarian combo meals.The meals had huge portion sufficient for one and available for delivery also.The mocktails came in a number of flavours with pineapple being my favourite

Kudos to team Red xpress for putting up such a grand feast keeping sea food as the centre of attraction.

Well, have been blogging for almost 3 years now and still was only partly aware of the varied delicacies the Red Xpress guys serve.

Situated in the IT hub of Kolkata (Sector 5), in the BIPL building at Webel more, they offer everything from Cocktails to Mocktails, from Chinese to North Indian / Mughlai, from soups / starters to desserts, from combo meals to even thalis!

Not too many places having a bar serve decent food also – and ambience – my oh my! Perhaps, the best in the whole of Sector 5.

Amongst a long list of items gorged by we foodie friends, the 2 veg combos and a couple of mocktails were sampled by the herbivore me and below are the comments thereon: -

(i)	Yellow dal fry – tasty, homely but garlic content can be moderated.

(ii)	Tandoori roti – Atta based, fine!

(iii)	Paneer butter masala – pretty tasty, very well marinated with variety spices and a little pinch of sugar!

(iv)	Mixed vegetables – Expected to be better because a wide variety of vegetables are available in winters, but was nevertheless fine!

(v)	Darsaan – Very crispy, moderately sweet and lots of sesame seeds!

(vi)	Raita – Great – went very well with the above main course

(vii)	Paratha – Seemed to be an atta and besan combination based!

(viii)	Jeera rice – Fine

(ix)	Steamed rice

(x)	Sautéed vegetables (Chinese) – Munchy

(xi)	Salads

(xii)	Cranberry and orange juice mocktail – It looked as well as tasted a million bucks – the varied layers of different juices in the same glass are quite appealing!

Overall, a decent experience! Service is fine and prices are not high! No reservations for quantity as well as quality served! So, walk in today to experience fine dining at reasonable prices!

Red Xpress used to be Red Hot Chilli Pepper at Bengal Intelligence Park earlier. However, every things same because it’s a sister brand of the same chain. Located right at the IT Hub of the city, this restaurant cum bar lounge caters to families and professionals with their lip smacking delicacies.

Ambience: Almost 500 sq ft of seating area makes the entire setting look spacious and well synced. The small corner bar has a great collection of spirits, liquor’s and even wines. The dim lights and the water fountain adds to the exclusivity of this place.

Let’s talk about food:
• General Jumbo Prawn : Part of their newly launched menu and their signature dish, very well presented. Coated prawn deep fried with aromatic spirit and topped with peppery sauce. I loved it.

•Sergeant Squid: Good one. Squid rings crispy fried with pepper and salt.

•Drunken Turkey: It menu’s New Year’s Eve so there has to be some Turkey in the . This Turkey was totally drunk. Too much alcohol, could be a bit balanced.

•Lebanese BBQ Turkey : Very nicely marinated with spices and quite innovative.

•Chilli Crab Claws: It’s the first time that I didn’t have to struggle with the claws. It was de shelled 😃
• Also tried the Chelo Kebab Platter and there were two combos which are really amazing to order from office and even from home. Few of the mocktails are worth mentioning as they come layered with different colours. 

Overall satisfied, rest you should visit and figure out.☺️
Happy Eating!!

Red Xpress is a fine dine restaurant located in sdf more in sector v. I have been planning to visit this place, finally it happened yesterday.
The things which I had yesterday is a very new addition to their menu, also special for the winters.

General jumbo prawn- A deep fried jumbo prawn tossed in gravy. It was sweet and spicy at the same time, I loved the tenderness of the prawn.

Major pomfret- Tandoori pomfret fish very spicy and having all the flavors from the slow cooking in tandoor.

Sergeant squid- These were really delicate, crispy fried squid rings with lot of garlic and spring onions.

Chili crab claws- They got all the heat from the chilies and that gravy along with it was lip smacking. The Crab meat was huge and very succulent.

Drunken turkey- Just as the name suggests, it is a side dish that I had and the the gravy actually had alcohol in it. I felt it was a tad bit too much, you can always mention your intensity of alcohol though.

Lebanese Barbeque turkey- I loved the smokey flavor of the turkey and the Lebanese marination was to the point. Both the turkey dishes were something between exotic and exquisite. Must try!

Chelo kebab- Their chelo kebab is a bit different than the others, as they have 3 types of kebab on the plate lehsuni,Tikka and Malai kebabs. This was good but could have been improved, with some additional veggies and some moisture to the dish.

Mutton biryani- There is lot of local biryani shops out there in sector v, so if the question is why should you have it here, then I would say the less oil factor and having a rich taste along with two big pieces of mutton, also a lot of rice good enough for serving two portions is your answer!

The veg and non veg combos are also launched with this menu, considering the corporate crowd. The veg combo is really nice because it had my favorite darsan. The quantity of food for both the items is very appropriate, and will suffice one person to the brim.
The mocktails along with my meal were very refreshing specially the blue lagoon.

The interiors represent a classic fine dine ambiance, on your left at the entrance you will find a well stocked bar, on your right they have a glass fountain adding a bit of liveliness to the theme. Loved the hospitality, only thing i would like to add that is, the servers need to be a bit more trained on service essentials. Apart from that please keep up the good menu at your place, Sector V needs a place serving exotic meals and sides like these!

The Christmas Lunch !
When we stepped in, this place was completely empty. .they took some time to serve us the food but when they did that, they served some yummy food ! We both loved the fish item. It was just amazing !! Now coming to the lunch they took almost 15 mins to fill the food thus we were asked to wait. But yet again the wait paid off! The main course was good but not as good as the starters. Desserts just had julab jamun , vanilla ice cream and darssans .
Staffs should have been a little more courteous and prompt as we had to call them several times for water, to adjust the AC and for food even though the place was not at all crowded. Otherwise the decor was top class ..5/5 for that... Food was good! Starters were excellent. So 4/5 for the food. Good work team. What's say

This place WAS good. The quality in buffet degraded. Number of items decreased, we went with a certain expectation due to their prior reputation. But now things have changed particularly the ambience,  inactive staff, fewer items on list and the same old recipes. Went there in a group of 20 and I feel like all my money was in vain. Not gonna visit the place again.

We reached the restaurant at around 10:45 pm nd the guard welcomed us with a smile on his face . Not very crowded execpt us there were only 10 customer. We went to the restaurant and order some drinks nd along with it we also ordered tandoori chicken nd dry chilli pork which tasted heaven and after that we also ordered mixed fried rice and red hot pepper chicken ( shredded ) and it was also equally good in taste ... 
Looking forward to visit this restaurant soon in future...

Amazing food, lovely ambiance, too good customer service and a super cool DJ. 

We hosted our private party at Red Xpress last Saturday, and it was nothing but an amazing experience. All of our guests were visibly impressed by the hospitality of the staffs. Especially 
Mr. Sourav Dutta, who was our primary point of contact since the day we decided the venue.

He was wonderfully cooperative, prompt in response and a real man of action. Whatever services he promised, we received the same. Even after it was time for the closing, all the staffs waited upon is with a smile on their face, not for a single moment they looked pissed off. 

The evening was amazing, and we all look forward to hosting another party at Red Xpress soon. Not to mention our intention of visiting the restaurant now and then.   :)

Good Luck Red Xpress!  :)

I have been to this place quite a number of times and always for their buffet. The soup has always been a turn off there, starters very very average. The main course and desserts also are nothing worth a mention. There are a lot more places with a better spread at the same price.

This was the most unexpected place to serve such tasteless dishes. We went there for birthday treat of my friend & opted for the buffet. Here in zomato the code shows 499 but we had to pay 575 per person excluding the taxes. There was plenty of options in starters but each of that was not up to the mark. Only that pan fried fish fry had a little taste. 
Other than that I noticed small cockroaches roaming there at the salad corner , it is very uneasy to see such things at any restaurant. 
The zeera rice and the noodle were also bad. Mutton rogan josh was also much rich and tasteless. The Hunan chicken was okayish type. Coming to the sweet section, they have just only one option of gulab jamun. Ice cream was available but only vanilla flavour and that was kept beside those hot pans without any refrigerator. The ice cream was almost melted. So summing up the foods I am giving it 2.0 and suggest them to improve everything . 
But the people out there were good at service so I will give 4.0 for them.

One of the best family restaurants in sector 5 area.Have been here quite a few times.I really liked their Chinese items specially crispy pork in chilli plum sauce.I really like their hospitality ,even if you ask them to make something out of the menu they will go to the extent of making that dish.Price wise is a bit high considering the nearby options available.The happy hours on drink is a good option too.

This is a great place to be. The spread is wide and has many varieties and not too heavy on the pocket either.

We had Dry Chilly Chicken & Paneer tikka for starters which were delicious. The main course, cocktails and desserts were good as well.

Loved the ambience. The staff here are very very friendly! They deserve full points for this. On the whole, a very good experience.

Overall satisfied and would surely visit again.

I am really late to pen down this ride due to heavy workload during Puja and along with Food tasting Invitation in various Hotel and Restaurants !. RED XPRESS RESTAURANT CUM LOUNGE, previously known as Red Hot Chilli Pepper, a fine dining place located in Tech Hub of our city. The place is very conveniently located. The entrance is nice and inviting. One of the promising places serving both Chinese and north Indian delicacies. Their culinary skills were well proven by the lip smacking experience we had during our dining experience.  Interiors are done very beautifully and in an eye catching way. It has a huge sitting area which can accommodate almost 50 head counts with a bar just decked up in the left of the entrance. The interior is done keeping in mind the woods; the artificial fireplace set up is the thing which catches the more attention. Dimly lit lights in the evening will give a perfect mood for candle light dinner. Was pleasantly surprised to see this place which is totally underrated by all means ! Its time for you guys to dine out and take the good food ride.

Went there with my family today for an afternoon lunch. The lights and decor gave the place a nice, warm and cozy ambience. Coming to the food, we had the lunch buffet which had a perfect variety of Indian and Chinese dishes. The kebabs in the starter were soft and yummy. To top it off, the desserts offered were delicious and a perfect complement to the food. To conclude, it was an interesting visit and will surely be back again to spend some quality time with family.

"Shae... Please don't!!"
That would be my advice and reaction to anyone mentioning this horrific restaurant to me from now on. We were four hungry souls who ordered a bunch of shit, and then regretted every frickin' time we put spoons to our mouths. The drinks (Shirley's Tale and Deep blue) were nothing more than over sweetened cough syrups. The starters were really really scary! The golden fried prawns were only batter, and the chicken was only red chilli powder. The mixed fried rice cost 500 RS per plate and contained stale lamb pieces. The side dishes were vomit worthy, and the dessert (Monty Carlo) was so hard. So, in short, I would rather choose Tommen as my champion in a trial by combat scenario than walking into this shit hole again. In all my years of reviewing places in Zomato, this is the worst rating I have given. I wish they had an option for zero ratings.
P.S. Icing on the cake: unattentive waiters!

While I’m sure a lot of people plying by the RDB boulevard in Salt Lake, I am certain that few people have thought of entering and fewer people have actually entered the place.

Red Xpress comes from the house of Red Hot Chilli Pepper, previously they were serving only Chinese but now they have come up with North Indian cuisine. Red Xpress  located at Sector V, Salt Lake is very convenient location wise. The area of the restaurant is huge with an open garden in front with few bench arrangements. The interiors of this place will blow your mind. The bar is decked up at the left of entrance with huge seating area inside, they have different counter set up for buffet, the artificial fireplace type set up adds stars to this place.

There are eating joints which get hooked onto your memory even if you are not very conscious about that fact. I never realized (until last Saturday) that somehow or the other Red Xpress (located at Sector-V, Saltlake) has got a little special place in my head (or heart, maybe) for some not-so-well-defined reasons stitched to my sub-conscious mind. This place in basically in my ‘office para’, that is the techie alleys of Kolkata where I have already spent one third of my life! Red Xpress was previously known as Red Hot Chilli Peppers and was one of the oldest family restaurants in this part of the city. So, last Saturday when I walked into this place loads of mixed memories came rushing back, though this place now looks very different with loads of improvisations and improvements still going on. In all these years many eateries have opened up in the locality and many have closed down, but there are only a few like Red Xpress that has stood the test of time. This is still one of the best family restaurants in Saltlake Sector-V area that can boast of warm hospitality, homely atmosphere and some really good food.

Very recently, visited this restaurant situated in Sector V, Salt Lake, which is believed to be the tech hub pf the city. Amidst all the offices and tech hubs, finding this fine-dine family restaurant is indeed a relief to all nearby. This one was previously known as the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, renamed as Res Xpress. The ambient dim lighting of the place gives you a feel of the medieval eateries. And its quite spacious. I was there for a bloggers' meet arranged by

Red Xpress Restaurant cum Bar Lounge is located at  Bengal Intelligent Park, Sector V, Salt Lake, Kolkata, West Bengal 700091. It is one of the most promising new happening places for great culinary works as well as for it’s breathtaking interiors and spacious seating arrangements .Recently Calcutta Food Scenes visited this place to know more about it and the ambiance was initially picking up footfalls as we entered but it was almost complete packed the moment the Dj was in action and that was an interesting moment to see. Talking more about the restaurant at first i would like to give my thanks to the management for delivering the experience and support overall.

This restaurant is part of the same group which started Red Hot Chilli Pepper. The are famous for their Chinese cuisine but they are serving good North Indian food too.

First I come to the ambience part. It was calm and soothing. The lights and décor is good enough and the sorroundings of the restaurant is well decorated with greenery and they have an option to sit outside provided with benches. Loved that…!! The dining has an artificial fireplace with a beautifully decorated mantle. It has a proper sections for everything. The bar is located at the left side of the entrance. The dining hall takes the bigger area in the middle and the buffet section is in the extreme left corner of the restaurant. Everything seemed pretty. Good work related to ambience part. Even they serve hookah when there is any party organised at that place.

Now I come to the food part. We started off with starters followed by main course, drinks and deserts. The course meal consisted of both Chinese and Indian dishes.

Starters:-

Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Stir Fried Exotic Veg, Pan fried Chilli Fish and Murgh Reshmi Kebab.

Main Course:-

Hakka Noodles, Hunan Chicken, Egg Wrapped fried rice, Veg Pulao and Mutton Roganjosh.

Drinks:-

Refreshing cocktails – Blue Lagoon, Mojito, Ginger Bed and Cosmopolitan.

Dessert:-

Darshaan with Ice cream.

Basically all the items are good enough with some critics. For details visit my blog.

Situated in the heart of Salt Lake Sec V, the Red Xpress is a restaurant from the house of Red Hot Chilli Pepper. We went there for our Saturday lunch meetup. The moment we entered, we were cordially greeted and were served Fresh Lime as welcome drinks. The ambience was calm and soothing. The dining area was dimly lit,  with an artificial fireplace with a beautifully decorated mantle. As we looked around, we noticed that the place had different sections - the dining hall of course, a bar, a place to host a buffet and even a dj stand. Everything seemed pretty nice and then came the food which was the highlight.
We started off with the following as starters.
• Stir Fried Exotic Veg -  a light yet flavourful preparation.
• Crispy Chilli Babycorn - crunchy pieces of deep fried babycorn tossed in a spicy tangy sauce.
• Pan fried Chilli Fish - chunks of fish fillet panfried in a chilli based sauce.
• Murgh Reshmi Kebab - tender pieces of chicken cooked to perfection.
The main course also consisted a combination of Chinese and Indian dishes.
• Egg Wrapped Fried Rice - Chinese style fried rice wrapped inside a thin egg crepe.
• Hakka Noodles - Good old wok tossed noodles.
• Hunan Chicken - Shredded chicken in a garlic and vinegar based white gravy.
• Veg Pulao - Indian style pulao prepared with an assortment of veggies.
• Mutton Roganjosh - Succulent pieces of mutton, falling off the bone, in an aromatic gravy.
And then to round of the elaborate meal, came the dessert.
• Darshaan with Ice cream - An all time favourite for the ones with a sweet tooth!
And it's still not the time to drop the curtains.. what came along with the lovely food were some refreshing cocktails - Blue Lagoon, Mojito, Ginger Bed and Cosmopolitan.. 
It was an amazing experience with all the food, ambience and service.. Thumbs up to Red Xpress!

Yesterday I ordered baby corn which was brought by my chauffeur as it was a take away, he handed a bill amount of Rs  420 and I was shocked that for one portion of baby corn I was being charged so much? Not even a three star thing. 

After that I was expecting a delicious food but baby corn was stale not at all crispy. 

I would not recommend anyone to go there and experiment with rest of the things.

Absolutely waste of money. We ordered pan fried chicken noodles large, and kun Pau chicken. I don't know how it's called a large quantity when it's less than medium even. We were really disappointed but still we tried to experiment one more dish that is Chicken Drumstick. It was merely three chicken leg pieces that too only fried , we have no idea how could be chicken drumstick is just few fried chicken pieces. Really Disappointed... It was just a waste of money.

The huge spacious restaurant with not so good foood is what defines the red xpress. We came here for a weekday lunch buffet a few days back. The dishes from the buffet menu that we tried are the following - 1. Lemon Coriander Soup- tasted good 
2. Dry Chilli Chicken - a big let down. It wasn't very dry and on top of that it wasn't boneless. I guess this is the only well known chinese joint which serves chilli chicken which isn't boneless. Even the snacks corner near my house serves only boneless chilli chicken. When we asked if the dish can be made with boneless pieces, they said they couldn't. 
3. Fish Fingers - better than the first. Nothing special, the taste was very ordinary. 
4. Steamed Chicken Momos - the flour coating was thick which made it a bit more chewy than the momos we usually have. 
5. Paneer Tikka Kebab- wasn't properly cooked. The marinade felt very raw ruining the taste. 
6. Noodles and Hunan Chicken - noodles was very oily and the chicken side was too tangy. Also hunan chicken is based on a red sauce and does not have a white gravy unlike this place. 
6. Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Sauce - the saviour. 
Another thing I would I to mention they all seemed very gloomy. Everyone was doing their duty without showing any interest in doing so. Neither the servers nor the manager nobody smiled throughput out stay nor did they greet us with a smile which usually most places do. A big let down. 
The price of the buffet might seem attractive and the decorations might do too but don't be fooled by this because the food is not worth to be tried.

Visited the place yesterday and opted for the weekday lunch buffet. 
This place is quite spacious with nice decor and ambience. The bar counter inside the restaurant looks really pretty. Now coming to the food, I can say that the spread was pretty good given the price 499+taxes.
Our food journey began with the Chicken Coriander Thick Soup which was tasty and served as a good start to our meal. 
For  starters, we ate -
1. Dry Chilli Chicken - a decent chinese joint serving chilli chicken which isn't boneless. Sounds ridiculous right? The dry chilli chicken here was made with chicken which wasn't boneless and it kind of disappointed us very much. On asking then if the dish could be made with boneless chicken they denied. Though the taste of the dish was good but those bones ruined the mood. 
2. Chicken Dimsum - these were good. The filling was very tasty and the covering wasn't rubbery.
3. Fish Fingers - just amazing 
4. Paneer Tikka- not properly grilled and still had the smell of uncooked masalas
For the main course there were decent number of options but we only took the Hakka Noodles and Shredded Chicken in Hunan Sauce. Both of the dish tasted decent. The chicken was a bit tangy and different. 
For the desserts there were 2 options but we only had Vanilla Icecream with Chocolate Sauce. 
The service was promt. They were very attentive and polite and the service was quick too. 
Overall a good place to visit for a filling lunch or dinner 😊

This joint offered Chines food, food quality is not bad, taste is good, and quantity is very huge. One plate is enough for people. Its very specious but interior is very awful, not much creative. Has a small Bar inside, only serve expensive liqueurs. Price is a factor in this joint. If you really want to pay much then only visit this place. It will cost 1700 for 2 people with just a pint of beer.

Went to this place in sector 5 on a Friday night with friends. There were hardly any people inside may be a couple of tables occupied. Decor and interiors are just ok nothing worth mentioning. We just wanted to have standard dinner so ordered veg Hakka chow, veg fried rice and veg manchurian. It took them ages to get these 3 very basic standard dishes. All 3 were good and worth waiting for. Veg manchurian was crispy stir fried which made it even better. Poor service but Worth trying.

I have tried almost everything from their menu and Im pretty confused which one to list as the best among the rest. The ambience is very good. It's not loud and over crowded. Anyway...this place has been a favourite and I hope it will remain the same.

Red hot chili peppers rechristened Red Xpress. The sitting area is big, it's perfect for large office parties. Ordered combo meals, one indian non veg and one chinese non veg. The quality was very good, as was the quantity. The problem i had was with the chicken pieces in the chinese chicken item being pretty small. The price given on menu was ₹300, but they charged ₹200, maybe some offer were going on. The waiter's were courteous. The food was a bit late to arrive though. Overall, a good experience.

The ambience is very plain and elegant. Most of the time office people crowd over there but the noise level is ok. Sitting is fine but the space is very less. I ordered fried non-veg wonton, veg noodles, chilly chicken and vanilla ice cream to the desert. I found it good enough. They even complimented with two extra scoops of ice cream.

Location: In Sector 5, a few paces from Infinity Think Tank.

Ambiance: It is mostly visited by sophisticated customers and thus has a very quiet and elegant ambiance.

Items Ordered: The menu was filled with a wide variety of items and it was very difficult to settle on a particular dish. I went in for a light brunch and ordered Murg Malai Kebab, Tandoori Jhinga and Date Pancake.

Service/Quality: It was cool and cozy inside the restaurant and thus I was in no hurry to have my ordered items served in quick time. The staff looked suave in the uniforms and they were attentive to every demand from every customer. I was updated twice for the prawn dish being a bit late. As for the food, well it was splendid and worth the money invested. The tandoor items were cooked to perfection and the dollops of ice cream on the pancakes looked too good to be disturbed and savoured.

Revisit/Recommend: The price of the food items is definitely on the higher range, but again it is definitely worth the price. I am out of Kolkata right now so can't promise on a revisit, but would surely recommend to anyone looking for good food and service.

It was lunchtime at office in sector 5 and 4 of us went out to grab a bite outside. Red hot chilli pepper is closest, so we went there. The ambience is beautiful. Staff count seemed low , but was ok as only 3 tables had people sitting ( including ours). We ordered chicken fried rice, hunan chicken and Chicken hot and sour. The quantity was ok-ish. The hunan chicken didn't taste very good. Other two items were good. Staff were very helpful in choosing the menu. We also got a 10% corporate discount.

Went there for Sunday lunch and we were the only guest at that time. First thing that would catch your eyes is their beautiful ambience. The behavior of the staffs were also courteous, but when it came to their food it was a major disappointment. The chicken lung fung soup was a bit more salty. The mixed Hakka chow was perfect. We also ordered rosted pork ribs. The waiter told us that the ribs would have a little fat which we happily accepted. But when it was served it was 4 pieces of only FAT!! No pork meat was there.. A bit of more honesty was expected. The pocket pinch is also on the higher side.

Visited this place on a Wednesday.
Food was below average.
Absolutely not a value for money place!
Maybe it's this branch of the restaurant which is poor.
Not sure but the experience was not nice

American corn, Chilly garlic noodles and chilly potato have been our fixed menu.
At the same time we even relished the North Indian main course here.

Although Red Hot Chilli Pepper has been one of our favourite  Chinese dine out, we were disheartened to know that the place has discontinued with the other cuisine !

If you want to have good Chinese food and looking to have a family outing or wanting to take your girl friend out for a nice dinner or lunch,this is the place to be.Located in Sector V fantastic place to have your lunch or dinner.Try out the Pan Fried Noodles and the starters.The service staff is also very good.👍🏻

Visited this food joint multiple times to try out their chinese buffet spread for lunch which is authentic in taste with a reasonable rate. This place mainly draws the crowd of office goers in the Sector V area. But i have observed they hardly bring variations in their buffet menu. Ambience is good.

Went for team lunch there today. Have been there before but only for drinks and snacks. We had the buffet spread which had a very justified combination of veg and non veg items. The food was amazing. I liked the Dahl kebab and kadai paneer in veg and special mention for the hariyali fish kebab, chicken momo and a chicken salad. The mango cake served for dessert was a bit soggy. Decor and ambience is decent. The staff is extremely amicable.

The worst  buffet I've ever come across.  The cost of non veg buffet is more or less equal or even more than its contemporaries like chai break or others but the quality of the food and variety is not even remotely close to them.  I went there for buffet lunch and I was offered only 2 non veg starters with one veg. The main course was not given in the buffet trays as it is done normally but the staffs will ask u what u need.  And the main course also hardly has 2 or 3 items at max with no mutton or prawn items. The chicken served in the starters were not even boneless. In the dessert section they have a very ordinary vanilla ice cream and even chocolate sauce with it is also not available. Very disappointed with its buffet and highly over priced for a buffet of this standard.

Red hot chilli pepper is an excellent Chinese family restaurant situated in the IT sector of Kolkata. The food is very tasty and has the authentic chinese flavour. The decor is very minimal but elegant. The staff is very courteous and friendly. The Cantonese style chowmein and the hunan chicken are amazing. The dry chilli lamb is the best I have ever tried. The price is a bit on the costlier side but the food has a great flavour and is a must recommendation. :)

The walk-from-work place for me and my colleagues specially during festival times. While their regular a-la-carte menu is nice and worth a shot, I have tried their festive buffet more. A good variety of spread is enjoyable along with a couple of sumptuous dessert options. A definite plus for those who enjoy alcohol as an accompaniment. Recommended for buffet than a-la-carte from quality, preparations and pocket pinch perspectives.

Food Quality was not good. Tandoori Chicken was terrific, Kali Dal was burnt, and Buffet is not good. Each chicken piece had blood patches inside. Food gets finished very quickly and you will have to wait a long for them to fill pots again. I had a bad experience. Not recommended. IIHM is far better for Buffet than them and of course, Barbeque Nation.

This restaurant is part of the same group which started Red Hot Chilli Pepper in Ballygunge almost two decades back and serves up some great Chinese cuisine. There are now 4 branches in the city including this one and they flourish as Kolkata’s love for Chinese endures. They serve a lunch buffet for INR 525/= plus which includes Assorted Salads, Soup, Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian Starters (3 each), Two Non –Vegetarian and Three Vegetarian Mains along with Rice and Noodles and Two Desserts. A complimentary soft drink is included. That makes it a decent enough deal and while it’s not a huge spread its quite good. The alcohol is decently priced and it’s basically aimed to fulfill the requirements of the techie crowd in Sec V.

Visited this place after years. Well this place stole my heart. The crowd increased drastically around 9 pm. We ordered Chinese Salad which was pretty good, must try. They dint have crackling spinach which made me a bit disappointed. To cover up they suggested cheese spinach roll which was out of the world. We ordered it twice. Hakka noodles was soft and well cooked. The vegetable we ordered was exotic veggie in Hunan style which was superb. The waiters were very courteous. I loved this place. I would love to get back here soon. ❤👍👌

Been here several times with friends and liked the hospitality. However the one time I went for a team lunch with colleagues, the service had gone for a toss.

The decor is simple yet decent. But the entrance is just dirty. They should seriously think of renovating the entrance.

The Chinese food is good. Mixed noodles, Hunan chicken, Cantonese prawn, black pepper and honey lamb, pork ribs are nice. However pork and lamb aren't available all the time. Among the desserts, the darshan is okayish. Toffee-walnut and date pancake are fine. The alcohol is dirt cheap. Don't really like the pickled cabbage that is served as a complimentary with the alcohol.

Had an Indian-Chinese buffet. Though was not very much confident about the Indian food, however it turned out to be pretty good. The tandoori chicken was soft and succulent, the kebabs and Chinese starters were good, the chicken and mutton sides were pretty decent. Kalmi fingers and veggies baked with cheese were finger licking good, and everyone loved them more than the non veg items. The options for desserts were limited. They had suggested Monte Carlo ice cream and it was blissfully delicious.

The service during the buffet was not up to the mark. We had to ask several times for the complimentary soft drinks. The diners had to wait for long for the baked veggies and the mutton. And the worst part is, they did not changed the cutlery every time they changed the plate with every course of the meal. I mean who keeps the used cutlery on the mat while keeping a fresh plate, that too during a corporate buffet? That was really filthy.

As far as the food is concerned, this place gets a clear 3.5 to 4 But the service during the buffet was really disappointing, hence a 2.5

I visited Red Hot Chillie a year back with my friends working in Cognizant. The food quality was so good. As per that I recently visited the restaurant just a week back..... I ordered Sea Food Coriander Thick Soup . After tasting the soup I found as if I am having hot water mixed with the stuffs. Then I ordered Red Hot Chilli Mixed Rice . It was good enough. But another horrible was the side dish... Cantonese Chicken.... 

I can give max 2.5 for the food quality. Can't think how they serve this quality of food.

Went there with a hope to enjoy a lunch after many days...but i got somewat disappointed....the prices are quite high....first of all, it was empty like some movie hall running a flop film...the emptiness spreaded when we entered as some ppl were havng food...they too went away...the awkward thing in the empty restaurant was that all the staffs were staring at us like we ran away from the central jail...it was very embrssng...
Next comes the food...the food was ordinary compared to the price of each item...we had a beer and a cocktail, fire cracker chickn, noodles nd a side dish(chicken item but name i frgt)...the bill was above 2k...the quantity was also not too much...the waiter who was serving us was helpful though...
Overall in a place like sector 5 where many ppl come fr good food...this restaurant sucks among them in terms of value for money...this wat makes the place more secluded...
Overall dont even try fr it...my opinion...try this when u need to have lunch nd all other places nearby r full...orelse DONT EVER THINK BOUT IT...

Now coming to the food the noodles was extremely dry &I didn't like it a bit .. the gravy of the side dish came as a savior of sorts .. the side dish was okayish ..
Price - verry expensive as they always are ..
Overall a not so pleasant experience .. would like to sit & dine once before giving the final verdict though :)

I loved their food a couple of yeas ago. But it was very much disappointing today. Buffet range is meagre compared to the price. Could not have the fish items as they were not at all fresh. Shredded lamb was like chewing gum, seemed like dog's food. The iced cake was so hard that it was difficult to cut a scoop. Relished the veg items only, specially the spinach cheese spring roll. Something went very wrong in the last couple of years, chef changed or management changed ?!!? Should there be any option, would like to rate zero.

Stuffs are very courteous. Food is above average. Don't expect that 'out of the world shock' to your tastebuds, but flavor is good.
I liked the ambiance of the place - not too shabby, not too posh. They have an adequate in-house bar.
Had a party here, enough space to accommodate 80 people, but only on reservation.
Go for this place, totally recommended.

Right from the decor, ambience, friendly and courteous staff to its variety of chinese dishes they serve, all get thumbs up. Quality and quantity both are good. 
But it's a bit high on the price side. 
Coming to the buffet, number of dishes are less but whatever is available, they taste yum. 

Thumbs down to the entrance door and external appearance and the high price!

We were there a week ago. The food is quite good. Its doesnt look like a fancy resturant from the outset but wen u get in its the other way round.. Price is on the higher side because usually chinese resturants are not that expensive. But quantity they serve is quite enough and value for money.
One suggestion i want to give to them is to change is the entrance gate its look so cheap and dull. Please convert it to any chinese themed gate as per their inner ambience.

RHCP is easy to locate, since it is on the main road. What's great is that it has A la Carte as well as Buffet options. I remember enjoying the Pork dishes here but I must warn you it this place is slightly expensive. Also, I prefer the A la Carte over the buffet here.

It was Saturday lunch time and the place was 95% empty.
Thought they dont serve good food and that is why people are not here.
But they proved me wrong.
We ordered typical Chinese dishes.
1. Chicken fried rice, 
2. Mix chowmin.
3. chili Chicken.

Trust me, one of the best Fried rice I ever had. 
And the quantity !!!!!!!!!. My God. Almost 1:3.

I was really surprised by the hospitality of the Stuff.

Have been to this place many times. 
The buffet here lacks variety especially for vegetarians. Even the non-veg section doesn't have much option. For non-veg they have just one chicken and one fish item. They taste just average. In the veg section, apart from the traditional paneer dish the other option is not that great. Only chicken momo is kept in the buffet section. They serve veg momo only on request. I must say the veg momo was horrible. In the desert section they usually serve an ice cream, caramel custard, and one more item. All seem just average. A complimentary drink also comes with the buffet. The price of buffet is nominal.
The ala carte section is better but a bit overpriced. I have tried Hakka noodles and prawn chilly. Both were tasty. 
I would just to go for ala carte if you are ready to shell out some money.

We went there on Friday and took a lunch buffet. Must say was disappointed by the standards. Everything was cold. And we had to ask them to get us fresh hot portions while we waited on our table. The variety was decent. Not great. At least in the vegetarian category. There was sweet corn soup, crispy corn, manchurian, fried rice, hakka noodles. The salad spread was good however. Kimchi, veggies in lime and vinegar, a salad made out of grated raw papaya or green mango which tasted tangy and fresh. Non-vegetarian had chicken manchurian soup which was not on the hot and spicy side. Chicken in garlic sauce was good, but couldn't eat grilled fish and chicken starters as they didn't serve us hot ones. The fresh lime soda complimentary with the buffet was good.

All in all a cold experience with the service and presentation of food. Even if the variety and taste was decent it was served cold. Taking away 2 stars for it

I checked the Indian menu photographs posted and decided to go for dinner. To my surprise the waiter said they do not serve Indian food and the photos posted online are 9 months old. The restaurant was smelly , the Chinese food quality was average and overpriced. The chilli chicken was undercooked. Not worth for the money charged. Disappointed. However the staff was courteous and well behaved , that was the only plus point.

I have visited there once & the experience was average. yes the food quality was good but the service was slow (maybe bcoz it was Christmas time) & the quantity if compared to some other places of similar kind was also lesser which means one plate of noodles might not serve 2 properly even though if u have had starters n soup!
Otherwise it is a nice restaurant with very nice ambience & u can try if u have not visited once.

Been there a few times. The experience has always been average or above average if not really good, but today's food was just not up to the mark. Had ordered a portion of Crispy Chili Babycorn with special instructions of making it really less spicy. I remember my ears burning after the first bite. Next was veg Hakka noodles which was very dry and just not there. The veg munchurian tasted kind of okay, but the overall experience was disappointing. Am rating it 3 because I was happy the last few times I was there. The ambience is okay, parking is a huge problem and service is manageable!

Originally wanted to go to Barbecue Nation, but they were already booked, so went to this joint. With a little hope (since Barbecue Nation broke our heart), we entered the place,looking at the decor and the location, thought it might not be that bad. They offered complementary drinks (Fresh Lime/ Blue Lagoon / Vodka based cocktail), which was very nice in both looks and taste. Then we started with the soup, which was also decent. Some of our team members also brought salads,which was not available later. We asked the staffs for it, they said there was no salads, we said some of us found that here, they gave a vacant look and literally ran into the kitchen.

Well, forgot, about the salads, we moved on to starters. They had some fried corns, veg spring roll, a chicken starter and a fish starter. Among the very few things I found good, spring roll was one of em. Fish was decent, but the chicken starter seemed like not fried properly. Thats all they got for starter.

We also found momos there, thought may be thats gonna be good, but trust me, you will find better momo at any stall at footpaths. 

Coming to main course, for non veg they have only egg fried rice, some chilly chicken (I had better chilly chicken at our office cafeteria) and fish (which was also the same). For veg, they had noodles (at least decent in taste), veg fried rice, some veg curry, veg manchurian (took and could not eat them), and curry made with baby corn and mashrooms which was very hot and spicy but tastes good.

For dessert, normal vanilla ice cream (which I must say the best thing I had here), darshan and some dry pan cake (could not eat the whole). 

Coming to service, the few things that were at least eatable here, were getting finished in no time and taking an eternity to get refilled.

For all of these pain, they are costing 600 bucks, Wow!!

The ambiance of this place in Sector 5 is just like any other chinese restaurant. But the prices are way too high than the other chinese restaurants in Kolkata.
A fried rice with decent quantity is priced at 350 INR. No complains on the taste though.
The Lat Mai Kai was way too dry and tasted like pakodas. Not a very good thing to have when you shell out 415 INR for 1 plate.
The quantity is decent though.
Staff is also okay.
Ambiance 3/5
Quantity 4/5

Food not so good. Been there recently for Team lunch. Took the buffet option and guess what got nothing to eat because nobody refilled the food items that got emptied. The starters were same as the main course except for few items. Servers there don't even know the difference between there food items, they said that two different food items were same as one of them got finished. Such a service lol.

Red Hot Chilli Pepper serves very good Chinese cuisine. There is an option of going for buffet as well as a-la-carte. The buffet is priced at around Rs. 600 inclusive of all taxes. The food which is offered in the buffet us Chinese. There is no Indian option in the spread. They have a nice variety of sopus, salads and starters, though not many options in terms of numbers, the taste of each salad or starter is pretty unique and nice. Do not forget to ask for your welcome drink which is a part of your buffet. Among alcoholic drinks, they offer mocktails in a wisky or vodka base. Mint and lime based mocktails are very well prepared. Main course has standard stuff like chinese fried rice, noodles, couple of oyster / chilli based chicken and fish sides and 2 to 3 very good veg preparations with good quantity of exotic vegetables in them. The spread winds up with some custard, darasan and vanilla. A la carte is also not a bad option to go for if you want to pick and chose specific dishes. Tai Chin chicken, chilli chicken / prawn, chicken hunan, Chicken kung pao, Cantonese noodles and egg wrapped mixed are some of the signature dishes. The ambience, space and light instrumental music make it a very comfortable experience. All in all if you are in the mood of having a relaxed Friday lunch with quality food and not very keen on hogging or gulping on large quantity of food and drinks, Red Hot Chilli Pepper is an ideal place.

Oh I loved this restaurant! When I checked it in Zomato I didn't thought it would be such a surprise to me. The Buffet was damn delicious. All the available options were mouth watering and equally delicious. Every tinge and flavour could be perfectly identified. All the dishes had different tastes and it was identifiable. I could really understand my active taste buds today. The complimentary drink added to the charm. The ambiance and hospitality was equally good. Enjoyed a very good lunch after so long days. I could say Dil-aa-gaya and would definitely visit the outlet again and again. Super happy !!

I went to this restaurant a couple of weeks ago with my office colleagues for lunch.. We have opted for buffet here.

The food was good. The buffet spread was also nice. There were chicken and fish in the starters and chicken and prawn in the main course.

In the dessert section, there were nothing much.. There were darshan,caramel custard and ice cream only.

Overall experience was good.

Red Express has once been one of the first choices to our mind, while going out for team lunch, but now it has lost its edge.
I recently been there with 5-6 of my friends and opted for their lunch buffet. The spread is really to less to consider and indian items has gone out of their table. The starter section is no more that good and they options available for main course was also too low.

I would think twice before visiting red express next time.

Been there for lunch yesterday.It is very easy to locate this restaurant as it was just the main road opposite to backstage.I liked the ambiance, very comfortable,chilled and peaceful (I usually find the buffet places very noisy and crowed).This place is perfect for business meetings as well dates .We opted for buffet lunch.It was a pure Chinese spread consisting of 2 non veg starters,2 veg starters,soups main course followed by dessert.I loved all the preparations.The items were very well presented.There are few places which serves Chinese buffets.Me being a Chinese lover loved the lunch buffet.PAN FRIED CHILI FISH,CHILI BABY CORN,PRAWN,OPEN SANDWICH,CHICKEN DIMSUMPS, FISH SALAD AND STRAWBERRY DARSHAN, MONTE CARLO WERE VERY GOOD among the other items.Staffs were very cordial as well.But they should add some more items in the dessert section.It costed as Rs 630 per person after tax.

We had a not so memorable lunch at this restaurant few years ago. Last Sunday, we tried this restaurant again after loitering along the 'SDF' and 'college more' and fighting over which restaurant to dine with my friend. The name of the restaurant changed. It is now red hot chilli pepper though the inner decorations are mostly the same. We went there at about 9 pm at a Sunday night and still it was mostly vacant, only two more families were having there dinner there. 
We ordered smoked pork in chilli and pepper sauce in starter and singapore rice noodles and chicken as our main course. The pork tastes good with its smoked flavour and chilli sauce. The yellowish colour of the rice noodles is unique to me and it tastes beautiful and it came with humongous amount for the two of us. Chicken is soft and tastes good with a bit of chilli. 
One negative point is it is overpriced restaurant and costs us 1600 for the two of us and also they are charging 14 % vat and 14% service tax which in general should be 14% vat and 5% service tax. But, overall we had a good experience.

On the buffet menu few items were really so tasty, mainly Chicken Momo. A large size Momo was so tasty and full of chicken. It was nicely made. Rest items are nice. Fish Orly was also good. In the main course, Mutton curry was good and the rest are average taste.

The space is very congested to start with. Few food items like dumplings were good but they vanished in front of the eye and they took quiet a big of time to refill it. So if you visit on a large group or a large group is there when you visit then it would be difficult to get the best food of that day. In the dessert section though they mention unlimited ice cream but are very reluctant to give you more than one scoop, two maximum... And if you still ask for one more, you will get a stern look from the server. There were some choice in the welcome drinks but we were served what they felt like serving. We weren't even asked. Highly disappointed.

Once hailed for it's buffet and the spread served, this place has lost quiet a bit of it's glory. Tried their lunch buffet recently, one thing that struck me bang on was complete absence of Indian cuisine from their menu. Although Red Express started of as a Chinese joint still the improvisation on their menu was the main eye catcher which went missing. Coming straight to food, the best part of the buffet that I could find was the salads, starters were just bland and seemed they came from pretty novice hands. Main course is not even worth mentioning. Management should take up the matter seriously and look into the quality affair. Expecting to get back the old charming and gastronomical Red Express soon.

Been there multiple time. Average type of  restaurant.  If you are going in a group, expect delay in getting food in buffet. Restaurant area is very small, in case there are multiple groups booked the restaurant u ll get very little space to move and you have to fight for your food. However quality of good is above average and service is quite good.

I had gone there for a buffet on a Friday evening with a large group of friends. The menu was not very impressive and the standard of food was not great either. The lat mai kai was too spicy and tha pan fried chilly fish could have been less sweet. I did not taste the pork so cannot comment on that. The hunan chicken was the saving grace in the main course. The chocolate darsaan and monte carlo were pretty decent. The service was good and so was the ambience. However, the buffet was definitely not up to my expectations.

Even after being right on the main road, this restaurant has solid visibility issue and you shall pass by the road without noticing it.

Dined here once,  around 3 years back... Nothing special to mention about. The food is just okay types. The show is running for the extremely courtious service personnel. If i ever come back here, i shall do that for the service n not the food.

Good ambiance, decent service but awesome food. There are very few places in kolkata where you can eat better Chinese then the Red Express. They don't have a very wide range of items to choose from but whatever you ask for you will be satisfied. The quality and the quantity is fantastic. Loved the squid because of the perfect seasoning. Finally I would say it's a tad overpriced but that won't be an issue if you you are looking for a great weekend dinner.

Really? I know people in this part of country can forsake anything for food. But, even to forsake the minimum or gratitude of service to be given up too? Well u want to go here, hell yeah...

If you scroll down you will find my first review..as this is my second visit to this place. But this time surprisingly they served only Chinese items. Anyway but all the items were good, delicious. I liked it. I wish I could give more than a 3.5 but the desert again failed. Very much disappointing. Guys please improve your last course. This time I have some photos of buffet. They serve lamb which is an unique item to the list.

This is a good restaurant:
1. Chinese was nice.soup was yummy.
2. Mutton kasa was awesome with plain rice.
3. Chicken dumpling( momo) was mouthwatering

But disappointment was
1.desert. I heard kesar jalebi is speciality of red express. But it was not available that day.
2. Space was little stuffy and congested.

Food wise I will give a thumb up. It's good for your office party.

I visited this restaurant in the weekend.The first thing I felt when I entered was that there was something missing with regards to the ambience.Decor is decent though the place dint feel welcoming.
Now, talking about the food,we ordered a hot n sour soup,sliced chicken in hot garlic sauce and ginger capsicum fried rice.
The soup was average.I would have liked a more thicker consistency.Also, the quantity of chicken and vegetables was very less.
The ginger capsicum rice was amazing.The rice had absorbed the flavours very well.One could smell the aroma.I like these sort of light flavours.
The sliced chicken in hot garlic became a favorite of mine.Not too spicy but just tickles the tongue.Fabulous!

We had also ordered fresh lime soda which was upto the mark.But the thing which surprised me most was that they raised the prices by a huge amount.Rates have become a bit exorbitant.Just because of the rates and ambience I fall short of giving them a 4 but the food is very satisfactory.

I personally prefer their buffet spread than the A La Carte menu. The buffet is nicely divided in starters and main course (Indian n Chinese). I think their main course in the buffet spread is far better than any buffet offering restaurant in sec v. The A La Carte menu is chinese and its costly with not so much on the quantity. But quality wise the food is excellent. Every dish is cooked perfectly n is light in nature.
PS buffet price varies. The A la carte would cost above 1500bux for 2ppl without drinks.

This happens to be my lucky 100th review on Zomato, so I had to write about a special restaurant, one that is really close to my heart...

This dates back to the Sector 5 of 2007-08, which was more empty, clean, lonely, and may I even add - a tad boring!

I was then the fresh new IT recruit, pocketing my wholesome salary at the end of every month - deliriously happy to be independent and to be spending with a sense of abandon which probably my parents' generation never knew!

So back then, every birthday, every anniversary, every project kick-off called for a grand buffet lunch. This was an era when smartphones, jeggings, and barbeque nation hadn't happened to the world, so a grand buffet lunch meant Red Express! And boy, was it grand!

Theirs was the first multi-cuisine buffet I had known after BBs, and honestly, it had me bowled over! And truth be told, I am still moony-eyed over it. Here's why:

1) The lady at the reception has the sweetest smile ever. Ma'am I don't know your name, but may God keep that smile intact!
2) The starters change every now and then, unlike other places. And they get better each time.
3) The fish salad is to die for.
4) I have witnessed people fight over the chicken tandoori.
5) The papri-chaat, I am sure has a secret ingredient. It leaves me hungrier after each bite!
6) If you are not in the mood for indian or chinese, you can eat rice and amazing mutton curry, and end with some awesome desserts - like I say, if you are a bengali, this is sure to make you delirious with happiness.
7) The desserts are awesome. Lesser in number, but always awesome!
8) They have complimentary drinks.
9) Price is still about 500 plus taxes.
10) Service is superbly courteous.

P.S - The A-la-carte is also nice. There is a wine list too. Enjoy!

I had planned to visit it for quite sometime by then. The place showcases a decent Chinese authenticity in its decor. Large windows provide excellent lighting during the day. The food was really awesome. Despite being chinese cuisines, they werent as pungent as anyone would anticipate, which is a good point for me. Every flavour was very authentic and is well distinguishable from each other. For example, many good food joints use the same Schezwan sauce for their Schezwan Fish and Schezwan Chicken. But Red Express is different for the better. It definitely is one of the best Chinese diners in the town.

Been there to this place on a number of occasions.  Their buffet spread although good is nothing to brag around town.  The thing is they offer buffet at a pretty decent light on the pocket price point and its average. 
The place is well maintained and service is quite prompt.

Visited this place on last Wednesday for a team lunch. Needless to mention we opted for buffet which was 500 rs per head exclusive tax. 
As you enter you quite like the ambiance, there was nothing extraordinary about it was simple yet good. Place was not huge but decent in size. 
Food options were a lot and it seemed like a wedding as enough options were present for Indian and Chinese. I personally preferred the fish and babycorn along with gulab jamun which I felt stood out. The other items included were 
Veg tomato soup
Chicken sweet corn 
Bread sandwich 
Cheese balls
Crispy babycorn
Orly fish
Crispy chicken 
Tikka salad / fish salad
Mutton organ
Egg fries rice / hunan chicken 
Papas
Pepsi chart
Chicken mono
Paneer Tikka
Dal fry
Hobo m anchorman
Aloe mater
Veg noodles
Steamed rice
Mix breads 
 custard
Ice cream
Gulab jamun 
 

I just felt that the food could have been warmer other than that  it was a decent experience not outstanding but decent. Service was  nice but could have been better and a bit more agile

I have visited here a lot many times. Very good ambiance and staffs are really qualified and friendly. This is another reason why I come back here. Not a good place to drink, drinks are costly. But very good soups and lamb items you will get here. Prawns are also good. I had tested fish items but those I dont like. Good place for meat items and soups.

One of the better Chinese restaurants in town. Visited this only once, but was quite delighted with the food quality. Located at the heart of Salt Lake Sector V, this place would be cool place to hang around for people working nearby. The ambience is however a bit on the lower side.

The food is really good over here. Had cream of chicken soup which was OK (chicken could have been cooked better), vegetable Hakka noodles and Hunan chicken (chef's suggestion). Alcohol is reasonably priced ( although there are cheaper options in Sec V) but this place is Costly!!! Cost for the above, along with 1 large Passport Scotch was INR1600 ( comparable to Chili's). Cost is the only Con here.

This place is perfect for a team outing with colleagues as this is in the heart of the office paara in sector v. They have buffet lunch and also an ala carte menu here. The buffet is good for foodies who can gorge on the various items on the menu. Priced reasonably the ambience is good but it tends to become a bit chaotic when a big group enters. A nice place to enjoy good Chinese food.

I recently visited Red Express with a friend and found it to be one of the better Chinese restaurants in town. We ordered veg. Wantons for starters, Haka noodles and veg. Manchurian for the main course and Darshaan for dessert. It was the first time I tried Wantons and Darshan and it was like a feast for my taste buds. Other than the usual accompaniments (chilli sauce, soya sauce and vinegar), they also served pickled cabbage and cucumber. Red Express scores high points for the taste of their food but there are quite a few cons which bring down the overall experience. The ambience is average and service below average. While we were waiting for our food, a group next to us complained about an insect in their food. According to them, this wasn’t the first time it had happened. Although we dint find any insect in our food, but complains like this do raise apprehensions about the quality of their food. 

Also, under the zomato information section, the cost for two is estimated to be 600rupees+taxes. I found this information misleading cause we ordered one starter, two main course and one dessert and the bill came around 1250rupees. 

Nevertheless I would still visit this place the next time I crave for good Chinese food.

Amongst the Best Chinese in the city, this clearly can get the label. Our office being extremely close to this restaurant, we have had the chance to enjoy their food quite a number of times.

The appetisers are all good and tasty. In main course most of the times I have had food there, it was primarily fried rice. I like their fried rice 2nd to Mainland China. The quantity is also good enough to serve 2 people. Among the side dishes I have tried almost all of them. Of what I recall, to name a few like the human chicken, chicken in oyster sauce, chilli garlic prawn all have a finger licking taste.

All in all, the food here is really enticing. As for the price...1 starter and 2 fried rice with 1 side dish..we spend ₹1000/- to ₹1500/-. They also have buffet for lunch...but I have never had it. All the time I had opted a-la-carte. 

There are very few restaurants in Sector 5 that have real good food and this is surely one of the best. Those of you go to Barbeque Nation in Sector 5...give this a try too.

Pros:
I have visited Red Express twice and on both occasions, every single food items was delicious. By food items, I include vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian items. Everything from Starter to Main Course was very well prepared. 

Cons:
Red Express will be considered expensive from a conventional perspective. Expect Rs.900 per head if you are eat well. Else, Rs.800 will be a good estimate for all. Having said that, paying extra and getting such good quality food is absolutely worth it.

We are just back from having a team lunch at Red Express and with much disgrace, I am writing this review. To be very honest 562/- (Inclusive of tax per head) is what we paid and being very frequent visitor to many restaurants in Kolkata, I strongly DON't recommend this restaurant to anyone. The first thing which we noticed was there was not non veg side-dish. There was NO mutton preparation for a 562 rupees buffet. The starters were just okey. Later on, another team in a much higher count arrived at the place and we found that muttoon dishes were being hidden from us by the waitors. This was hilarious, when we asked them the reason, after much stammering they responded that the other team are in more count, so mutton is for them and they are paying 655/- per head for this. This was really very disappointing and we have decided not to visit there ever going forward. I would also like to suggest you, There are other much better restaurants present in Salt Lake Sector 5 to be very specific like Bar-B-Q nation,The ocean Grill, Funjabi Tadka etc where you would definitely get the actual food what you are paying for.

I guess thrice I have visited this place, one of them was some reception ceremony.
To be honest, I always found the momos of good qulaities here but coming to starters and main courses, I did not find an item which I could relish that much, neither were any poor preparations there, eating which you will be disgusted,
But desserts varities is really less--Shahi tukda/one sweet and one ice-cream, one pudding/cake-- I guess they can afford a bit more varieties here.

We had a buffet lunch with my team today. I was sceptical about the place, as till now only 2 positive review I have received. But by my hunch and my colleague's feedback we finalized to try our luck and found it was though not as great but fair and value for money.
About 90% food are of Chinese cuisine. Only Chicken Butter masala, Tadka Dal, Palak Paneer and Dahi Chat (as it seemed to me) are North Indian Style. Food was good specially I liked the Fish Orly and Lamb preparation. There were around 5-6 starters, Chicken Dim-sum, 2 Types of rice(Chicken Fried and veg Steam Rice), 1 bread, Salads, Raita, Papad, Palak Paneer, yellow Daal, Veg hakka noodles, Caramel Custard, Gulab Jamun and Ice Cream (Chocolate & Vanilla). Overall it's good. Ambiance is also soothing as they were playing Eagles, UB40 and other soft rock numbers to keep the mood light. The price cost us INR 538.00 (Inclusive of all Taxes). I would recommend my other friends, too visit at least once.

We went on a working day lunch and the menu had 2 soups, 3 or 4 veg starters (indian & chinese), 3 or 4 non-veg starters (indian & chinese) including sui mai. 

The ones that were great amritsari fish, chilli garlic fish, the tandoori gobi and the egg and parsley salad. The main course had a delicious sliced lamb preparation among other dishes which was simply mind blowing.

Dessert consisted of darsaan and ice cream and yummy malpoa with rabri. 

Good value for money at Rs.450 plus taxes and you get a free beer or a non alcoholic drink

Food: 3.5/5

Ambiance: 4/5

I had buffet lunch with my team a few weeks ago and I was bit worried because of their poor reviews on Zomato and as told by my other colleagues but for our surprise it was not that bad and Red Xpress really catered us well and made us happy.

We had to wait for 20 minutes or so even after we booked a table in advance because we arrived there late. So, starting with food, they have a nice combination of Indian and Chinese food. Starters were really good but the only thing which I really didn't like was the tandoori chicken, it was hard and dry, could not relish that much. Main course was quite decent too with different options like noodles, rice, chicken/mutton/fish items on the menu. Dessert was quite simple and nice with pudding, rosogolla and ice cream.

Service was bit slow as the place suddenly became so crowded and the food started vanishing in no time. It was taking ages to refill the empty containers once it is finished. Nevertheless, had a great time there and the food was way better than what I expected.

Went for dinner last Saturday with a few family friends. As usual the food did not disappoint.  My friends are regulars here, but even they didnt know about an off menu dish - spinach chesse rolls, which is brilliant. 

The food was vegetarian topped with some good cocktail mix. Both the indian and Chinese cuisine options here are good.

You don't need to think to much about what to order as the quality is good overall. You will have a good experience and maybe a wow effect once in awhile. So dont hesitate to try different items on the menu and ask for some off menu options also.

Red hot chilli pepper has been one of my favourite chinese eating joints. They started with a very simply decorated outlet on ballygunj circular road which I used to frequent often. I had high regards for red express which opened in sector 5 no sooner.

My office being sector 5 I was quite regular there too for their lunch buffet. No wherr would you have got a quality meal for 250 bucks till a few years. Over the years I have been rather disappointed with their buffet. With the awesome chinese preparations like dry chilli chicken and lemon fish...I have seen biriyani and luchi and kosha mangsho to be served. For a joint very well known for their chinese delicacies...I guess its not a very great idea to mix indian dishea with some great chowmein, rice and chicken...not to mention the awesome dimsims for starters.

At the current buffet rates, you would be a tad disappointed with the fusion spread but the chinese delicacies will linger in my mouth always. Do round up your meal with the awesome deserts served in the buffet.

I had visited this place couple of times and had mixed experience overall.

First three times,I went there with our project team member for a team lunch and opted for buffet.Buffet cost was much cheaper than other food joint in Saltlake Sec-5 area.Plenty of dishes were there in buffet.Welcome drink was there.Food was good enough to make the visit worthy.

Later I visited this place with two of my friends.That time buffet was not there and we opted for a-la-cart and it was disaster.Chicken clear soup was so-so.After that we ordered some chicken starter(forgot the name) which was good and sufficient for 3 of us.After that,stuffs suggested us to try their pork and lamb dishes and we ordered 1 pork dish(forgot name) and 1 chicken dish with rice.Pork dish was not well cooked and smelling like .... (ohh!! I don't want to remember at all) and when we asked the stuff to check the dish with Sheff thinking some mistake might happen.Now?..Sheff came and started arguing and pushed us to accept the dishes as it was. He refused to accept the fact and it was really disaster.After long argue,one stuff came and offered to change the item with some other dish and that time we ordered one shredded lamb dish(again forgot name. )It was salty and not so good.

Lastly I had visited 5 months back and opted for buffet.Items had changed and quality also.It was just so-so types and always running out of stock.Had to wait long time to get it into the buffet container.Gulabjamons were too good.But Buffet price appeared expensive according to the food quality and services.

Overall it is good enough but not up to the marks.Presently does not worth money in accept to food quality and services.

I have eaten here many times a couple of years back . This started as a slightly pocket friendly place from the house of Red Hot Chili Pepper. Initially they were brilliant and remained so over over a year and a half. Gradually as days went by ... Indian was introduced and the pizza and pasta and the quality of the Chinese kept going down . not the that Indian or the lunch buffet was any good . 

The ambiance is a little tacky, especially the expectation bar is high as red hot chili pepper is an all time favorite . 

This is a disappointment. 

The staff here is forever trying to push the buffet .. giving the feel that they just are too lazy to serve, as buffets are hassle free . 

It was a brilliant place. stopped going there after the last few negative experiences. I wont say the food is entirely bad. It is swallow-able !

Had the worst experience of buffet here when we visited this place last month. Spending around rs.510 on such a buffet is just worthless. There was a welcome drink and soup to start up the lunch. In chicken there was only a kebab item and no gravy item of chicken. In mutton there was only Mutton keema matar where there was hardly mutton available. besides these there was lots of other veg dishes which are not such tasty. They also make nun to go with chana matar etc. there was only ice cream of one type and a payesh in the desert. Service was oky but not satisfactory at all.
So to sum up its not at all recommended  to spend such amount of money on such kind of dining which is not at all satisfactory.

One of the best buffets in Kolkata which serves such great food at such a cheap rate. Being so close to Infinity and Webel, Red Express is a hot-spot for young (and hungry) IT employees. Coming to the buffet, it has every thing you would love to fill your tummy with. The complementary beer totally made my day. The Shredded Lamb is just fantastic. And so are the salads. The Caramel Custard at the end is the perfect way to finish. i remember that me and my friends ate so much that we made sure there are no custard left for others.

I'm looking forward to pay a visit pretty soon.

Its a just Ok restaurant. Their buffet price is around Rs. 425/-+ Tax which is reasonable and mainly aimed for Sec-V IT crowd. The starters are not very impressive, main course is Ok, deserts also lack variety. Lat Malkai was good, Fish Pan Cake was not that tasty, Dum ka murg was fine. We enjoyed the goolabjamuns at the end.

A nice place for chinese at sector V.
If you drop by, do take the items mentioned in the a-la-carte menu, prefer not to go for the buffet. Before marriage, me and my then-boyfriend(now husband :-)) used to have our quick lunch-dates often at this place. We have tried almost everything in the menu and nothing really disappointed us.
The menu is not huge, lesser items in starter section. This is one of those few places, where the main courses are better than the starters.
Special mention:  whole fried bhetki with schezwan sauce(good for 4-5 people), egg meifoon, egg wrapped rice and sliced chicken/fish in any sauce. And my favourite is, cantonese chicken, Soft, delicate, flavourful and subtle..I just love it. Also the cucumber pieces(soaked in vinegar and sugar) they serve with the starters are really refreshing.
Service is good and friendly (my rating: 3/5).
Price: little on the higher side, but worth it. But then they provide corporate discount.. yay!!
Value For Money: Yeah(3.5/5)
Food: for the cantonese chicken :-)  and everything else(4/5)
Ambience: average, nothing great. (2.5/5)

Thumbs up.

located in sector 5 which is always deserted on Sundays, I was amazed by the hussle and bussle inside. the decor was apt. the staff is really helpful in suggesting dishes or accommodating unusual requests. 

during the waiting time the complimentary dishes served was decent, especially the tomoto soup - which literally blew me away. really liked the pan fried chicken noodles which was crispy. if you are looking to have chinese food it is one of the best place in salt lake. they also serve indian but dont have much options.

the food is little overpriced compared to the the quantity they serve. the alcohol is way cheaper as compared to other restaurants in its category across calcutta e.g. a bottle of hoegarden costs 260 (excl tax. MRP is 215). Further happy hrs was from 4-8 pm, but we managed to get the happy hours at 3.15. pocket pinch 2600 for 4 which includes 2 starters, 4 main course dishes, 4 hoegarden beer.

A good place to dine in Sector V that has been around a while. It is under the same management as Red Hot Chilli Pepper which serves up some of the best Chinese cuisine available in this city. They serve a buffet for less than INR 525/= plus and while its not a huge spread its quite good. Also the alcohol is decently priced and its basically aimed to fulfill the requirements of the techie crowd in Sec V. The a-la-carte is my preferred choice and I have my standard items that I order like meifoon rice , lat me kai and sliced chicken with mushrooms in oyster sauce or konjee crispy lamb. Drop in if your in the area and you want to have a relaxed meal its fairly quite on weekends so its actually a good place to unwind. Usually my preferred place to dine if I am in Sector V.

The thing about Red Express is that it is Very Ordinary. I feel that the food is slightly over priced for what it seems is it's essential worth. The decor too is nothing great and is matter of fact. Its not bad but it hasn't got an x factor that will make me want to go back there again. If u want to, go ahead and try. Definitely try. But don't expect a boom of flavors or anything. You shall come out fed n satisfied but bogong special to talk about. When I had visited I came out a tad dissappointed coz the food was not special and the service was a bit crude and a little slow. My friends keep on going because it's near their office. Drop by if convenient- is all I suggest!

I went there today and found the buffet is good. But I deduct the number ( :-)) because of the following reasons:
1. They put smaller quantities of food stuffs in the bucket though there are only 3 groups at that time in the place but because of lesser amounts of food people need to wait and sometimes they got frustrated and go back to their seat instead of waiting.
2. Deserts variety is very less.
3. Limited variety for kabab too.
Other than that overall experience is good.
Best one: shik kabab, the close second was the "BASA" fish in oyester sauce

I had been to this place on a weekday for lunch with a friend.
Since this was my first visit to this joint i found the interiors to be impressive,spacious and clean.The staff was courteous.The place is frequented by office-goers and found it a bit noisy courtesy the large groups that were present on that day.
We opted for the buffet.Spread was decent enough although the dessert section lacked the variety.As far as food quality is concerned it was strictly OK and nothing to write home about.Couple of items in the non-veg section(chicken chap and biriyani) did not seem fresh.The buffet also had a lot of items for vegetarians, so that's the good part.The complimentary beer pint/soft drink was the added attraction.The price tag of Rs 350 excluding taxes is not a bad bet i guess.
