Just when we accidentally discovered this place, I remembered that I've came here many years ago.... Nothing special about the place.... Nothing fancy in the menu card.... limited choice.... most people come here to parcel their dinner.... we tried their mutton do- pyaza.... Frankly speaking, the food is just ok.... taste wise and also in quantity....

I never dine in there, but I tasted there chicken kasa and roti more often... as we take delivery to our office many times... taste was good as well as the quantity was good too... costing was quite reasonable...

Average food quality although it is quite an old joint. Have not changed much in looks and menu. Best feature, it is open throughout the day late into the night.

The restaurant is nearby to my hostel, cycling of ten minutes. I paid a couple of visit. The best thing is that the Dhaba is open even at odd times. Yesterday I went for having my dinner. On the occasion of immersion of Goddess Durga's idol all restaurant were closed, but then Dhaba served its utility. I had almost the idea of menu so ordered roti with Chana masala and Dal fry. Roti's are soft and warm. The side dish were good too. Earlier I also had Aloo Dum, it tastes fantastic with finger licking gravy. Ambience and food is good, best suited for passer-by and students, not recommended for family. The menu card as uploaded here is old, several dishes have been removed, prices increased. You can have a peek if with friends at odd times as the only option left, lest I will suggest to move up to Danesh Sheikh Lane and have dined at Penguin.

More or less a good dhaba for its open till 12 am in the midnight. Food quality is better than average (keeping in mind the price point, u can't expect any better at this price). Another convenience point is: In this area, this is the only place where you will be served Roti even during lunch, if you wish.
  Rather than rating this food joint entirely on the food served, my rating for this place is mainly based on these aforementioned conveniences and price as well.

Had been to this place before, once. It's a normal punjabi dhaba but the food didn't do justice to the reputation of punjabi dhabas. 
I ordered alu parantha which I normally do whenever I visit places like these as they do it well. And ordered one chicken chilly. 
Parantha was normal and decent while there was tremendous scope of improvement with chicken chilli.
