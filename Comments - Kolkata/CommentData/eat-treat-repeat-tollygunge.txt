This road side eatery is a must visit when it comes to tasty Chinese food at a reasonable deal. With limited seating arrangement, their wooden Dhaba-style decor is note worthy. We just love the food here. Absolutely finger licking and leaves you craving for more. Hoping to eat more from this eatery.
