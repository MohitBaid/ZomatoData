Very bad.
Taste of the food is not up to the mark, whereas the price is also not that less. I had ordered a chicken preparation and they just added sauce to chicken, I dont think they had cooked the recipe properly.

This is the best Chinese restaurant in this area (Shyambazar - College Street Area)..
The ambience is good enough, though it can be improved.
Visited during this Durga Puja days on Saptami night in a group of 6. It was very crowded and we had to wait over an hour to get our table.
We ordered Chicken & Prawn Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice, Special Fried Rice, Chilli Pork and Manchurian Fish.
The quantity was more than enough (3 people can eat from 2 Fried Rice), the food smelled delicious and looked awesome.
Only I expected more from the Manchurian Fish, somehow I felt it wasn't up to the mark (though others from my gang loved it)
The staff was very well behaved and professional and the table and plates and other cutlery were properly cleaned.

Situated just opposite to Hedua Park(a typical North Kolkata area), it might seem the restaurant is overpriced, but its not. You get to taste proper Chinese cuisine and they serve Pork as well as Ham in a North Kolkata which is a total rarity.

In a whole , a wonderful restaurant to visit if you really crave for Chinese cuisine.

P.S. - A little more space and little work on the ambience would have extracted 5 star rating.

Chicken hot and sour soup, egg fried rice & chili chicken, just pathetic. Taste of Food is not Chinese nor Indian ,God knows about the origin of food.

Since childhood I had known this place for it's really good food. But this time I was highly disappointed by it's food. one should never order the chicken baby corn and mushroom main course. They also served us burnt veg fried rice. All the food items are highly priced and the food wasn't even worth the cost.

It is more like a road side stall who has upgraded to an AC place and sky rocketed their food price like hell for the worst quality of food.DO NOT GO HERE UNTILL YOU ARE DYING OF HUNGER AND THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE .

This reastraunt holds a special space in my heart because my father used to take me there. Nowadays it lost its charm. Food is good in here , nothing extra ordinary the only thing that I can never forget that it serves a warm vibe but that definitely is not a good reason  to spend money when you can have chilli chicken and fried rice any where

Not the best shop in the area specially with Blossom and Fatso right around the corner. The restaurant is mostly empty as the prices here are higher compared to the other two around. The quality of the food is almost similar to the other two which is quite average. However the staff here are really nice and talk to you very politely which is something that is missing in many restaurants in and around North Kolkata.

Poor restaurant with thoroughly unprofessional staffs, no wonder getting such low rating. Ordered via phone and told them that I will pick up the items after 1 hour, when I reached there after 1 hour they still have not started preparing  the food, If i willI have to wait there for 30 mins then whats the point of ordering in advance?? Ordered mixed fried rice which was very very bad, crispy chicken not at all crispy, special fish- one of the worst fish item I have ever tried, 6 tiny little pieces of smelly fish for rs-350( are u kidding me?) and chili prawn but to our utter surprise when I opened the container it turned out to be chilly fish, dipping in dark soya sauce, they charged us of prawn item but gave fish item, to let you know their prawn items cost 100 rs more than fish items. All the food items were disasters, absolutely tasteless. the amount of money they are charging for such low quality and quantity of food is really astonishing.  Never going there again.

Capri is carrying forward the old school restaurant culture with its presence for long now and it is still the same with modified I interiors.

**Location**
Very near to Scottish Church College. It's on the left hand side lane from Hedua crossing if you are coming from Star theatre side.

**Experience**
On a Saturday night at around 9 p.m. at the cozy restaurant with small sitting arrangements. As one of my friend recommended Chinese here.  

Food:
Dry chilli Chicken: (4/5)
Spring chicken (4.5/5)

Chicken Fried rice (4/5)
Chilli Chicken gravy (3.5/5)
Gravy noodles (3.5/5)
Fish Manchurian (4.5/5)

The person serving was really good with his behavior and service. Quite liked it and appreciate him thoroughly. Thanks for this.

A nice and cozy place near scottish church college. Its air conditioned and the ambience is quite nice inside. The dishes are amazing but the prices are a bit on the higher side if you compare with the other restaurants beside it. The quality and taste is good and so is the quantity. 
--------
We had capri special mixed fried rice, schezuan prawn fried rice, prawn with vegetables, and chilly chicken.
The pork in the fried rice was tender and juicy... so was the chicken. But the prawn with vegetables could have been a bit better. It was a bit bland for my taste.
--------
Overall this is a good place to visit among the line of restaurant off of hedua. Do give this place a try.

What a total disaster! My parents who live about 5 minutes walk away from Capri ordered some takeaway the day before the Durga Pujas, of chicken and prawn fried rice, which cost Rs 180 a packet. Upon starting to eat, she discovered they had given her egg fried rice instead(cost Rs 130/packet), or at the very least no chicken or prawn pieces. She called the restaurant and the owner agreed to despatch a replacement pack for her promptly. The delivery driver took a look at the half-eaten pack which did not contain any chicken or prawn, and to mum's horror he took out his keys and started to poke around with them in the food. Mum was furious and demanded to know why he had contaminated the food in this way. The driver nonchalantly called and spoke to his boss, but would not allow mum to despite her entreaties. She then asked him to take the offending product back with him, to which he replied that he would discard on on the street nearby. On hearing this mum threatened to create a scene by calling the neighbours. The driver left without another word and moreover took the new packet of food--presumably the correct item--with him.

We are absolutely disgusted at their attitude and have no intention of going back there again, and would also like to ensure none of our friends and acquaintances ever darken it's doors either.

○ This place was a wreck even 1.5 years ago.I remember the last time when i was here I have seen cockroaches.Creep the hell out of me.It was damp,dark.
● Yesterday I went with my sister's & by seeing the place only I got shocked. Drastically changed the whole place.Uploaded a pic for that reason.
● This is a very small place hardly can accommodate 20 people at a batch.
● During this puja visit I got the best bread from here.Strange but true. Loved it.So was the butter masala and chicken Bharta. The only crappy thing was the chicken cashewnut. It was horrible.
● Verdict : They take a awful lot of time to bring your food, apart from that I'd recommend this place as a nice and cheap restaurant. :)

Definitely one of the go-to places in Hedua for Chinese. I'm yet to taste a Chicken fried rice better than Capri's. That and its chilli chicken (gravy) is a killer combo. Blossom's fried rice is good too, being slightly larger in quantity and with more veggies than Capri's (which uses just spring onions and black pepper seasoning yet somehow manages to taste FAB!)
I always go to Capri whenever I get my fried rice- chicken chilli cravings and want a quick fix - they can serve your order within 15 minutes as opposed to Blossom which will make you wait for atleast half an hour, and if its a Sunday then.........
I have tasted very few other items so can't say about its overall food quality, but Its gravy chowmein is not as good ( as Blossom's- really , here blossom wins hands down). And avoid ordering its chilli chicken as dry if you can't handle too hot or spicy food as its literally DRY and laden with Chillis ( I actually choked on it) Here also Blossom wins, its Chilli chicken whether Dry or gravy, both are TOO GOOD.
Quantity and price-wise Blossom wins, and in taste too, but only I prefer Capri's fried rice over Blossom's in its taste. Capri's Chilli Chicken (gravy) complements the rice superbly, I love it.
That's my opinion. Now you be the judge:)

I'd ordered for veg fried rice, egg chowmein, spring chicken and Chicken lollipop.
Quantity: One portion was sufficient for two
Quality: Below standard. Cooked in high flame and excess oil to mask the uncooked textures. Chicken lollipop was a show of chicken piece coated within a dollop of flour and whatnot!
Taste: Well, the sad part is both the rice and noodles tasted similar. The spring chicken and lollipop were no good either.
Verdict: Thankfully I had some site's coupon that got me discount on the total bill. I feel the money could have been invested in better places. Finally, never going to eat here again!

Capri is a small chinese joint located in beadon street opposite to hedua park..It is probably the only restaurant in the vicinity that serves pork,however my advice will be to try avoid it here as the pork served here is below accepted standard..The interior is very stuffy,seats will make you uncomfortable and the floors are quite low..so it is better for a take away..The service here is also pretty dissappointing..the waiters seemed to be out of place..prices are way to high considering the standard of this place,the portions do not justify the higher cheques you pay..
Coming to food, we ordered:
Crispy Fish: This is basically a fried dish of fish strips and not the conventional pan fried dish we taste in other places,not worth ordering..
Chilly Pork: Dissappointing to say the least, lots of fat in the plate, also the porks are chewy and rubbery..
Manchurian Chicken: It tasted a tad better, also the quantity was good, but the whole rendering should have been better..
Mixed Schezwan Hakka Noodles: Again the proteins are meagre in quantity, also a bit too oily for my liking..and quantity don't justify the price..
Overall not worth visiting as there are better options in the vicinity..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 1.5/5
Service:1.5/5
Ambiance: 1/5

The first time I sneaked away a dinner with my dad only, Capri was the delicious host. Since then it has been a niche in my choice of eateries in North Kolkata. The Chinese is truly made suiting our Indian taste buds and menu has necessary items to justify the varieties in the same cuisine. I still go for its soft juicy chili pork littering my mouth with its tantalizing juices on every of my visit.
Ambience is totally supportive for the sneak out dinners or solo eating. Pricing and quantity is justified and service is always homely.
What this place lacks is the variety of complimentary drinks bit If you crave for tender pork meet suddenly Capri will surely serve you the best.

LOCATION:
Opposite hedua park just beside Scottish church college.

AMBIANCE: 
Nothing special about it. But its bit to dark. The only source of light inside the restaurant are few focus lamp on each tables and ceiling have a blue led borders.

FOOD:We ordered:-
1)Garlic Fried Rice
 2) Schezwan Chicken  3) Garlic Chicken

Garlic fried rice was not well cooked the rice was bit under cooked and also oily. The quantity served was good.Schezwan Chicken: The preparation didnt taste like a schezwan preparation .Chicken was not well marinated.

Garlic Chicken: Too much of garlic ruined its taste. so we had to eat the chicken pieces leaving the gravy.   

POCKET PINCH: DAMN CHEAP 400 FOR TWO

CONCLUSION: 
Not  a   good experience. Wont visit it second time.

I have ordered food from here many times. I would like to suggest you that, the chicken menu here is delicious. Avoid the pork and ham items, they taste horrible. But the Spring chicken makes up for that. The gravy is simply as good as Bukhara, located in Delhi, one of the finest restaurants in India. The chicken Manchurian are OK OK, but the best is the Ginger chicken, it is full of flavors , and spicy. The Rotis, and naans are fine also. But the spring chicken is must for all chicken lovers.

The food over here is value for money for any Chinese food lover. And the quantity of the dishes is also good. So overall its worth having food here.

I have ordered food from here many times. I would like to suggest you that, the chicken menu here is delicious. Avoid the pork and ham items, they taste horrible. But the Spring chicken makes up for that. The gravy is simply as good as Bukhara, located in Delhi, one of the finest restaurants in India. The chicken Manchurian are OK OK, but the best is the Ginger chicken, it is full of flavors , and spicy. The Rotis, and naans are fine also. But the spring chicken is must for all chicken lovers.

Chicken Prawn Egg Chowmein/ Spl. Veg Chowmein and Mixed Fried Rice accompanied with a decent choice of Hot Garlic Chicken and Schezwan Chicken satisfied my taste buds a lot. Flavoursome Chinese food at a reasonable price like in Capri is hard to find. Good quantity, great flavours, pleasant meal.

The food quality is not even close to the price it asks for. The chowmein is similar in quality the one available at road side eataries. The chilly chicken/fish/prawns are a curry made with soya sauce and pepper. Aa far as the prices go.. you are better off eating at chang-wa, tung foo or waldorf.

Located near Blossom restaurant opposite Hedua Park, have been seeing this restaurant for quite a few years but got the oppurtunity to try it not before a couple of weeks back and the experience was not so amazing as i would say !!!

The eating area is pretty cramped up, congested and so would recommend it for a takeaway which i myself did. The servings are generous but i found the price of side dishes bit over the top and not so value for money. The rice was decent, hakka noodles were really good with a nice smokey flavour though both could have been a little less oily. The paneer chilly did not justify that price tag of 200 bucks and was a disappointment. Manchurian was decent for some 140 bucks. 

The food is not so impressive at that price. Moreover blossom is located just beside it which offers better food at more reasonable prices.

This place is very near my home and I visit quite often. It's diagonally opposite Hedua park and Scottish Church college, don't know why this has been classified as Sealdah area, it's Hatibagan area at best.

Quality of food is excellent, can easily compare with the top restos of Tangra, China town. The quantities served are also adequate. A full plate can easily feed two. One of the few restaurants in north Kolkata to serve pork, their mixed chowmien, hot garlic pork and sweet and sour chicken/pork is particularly delectable. Decor is nice,clean and cosy, but nothing fancy.

One warning, their card reader often goes out of order, so ask beforehand.

Since I stay nearby this restro, I frequently order foods on home delivery from it. Their pork balls and pepper chicken are quite good dishes to mention, which are different from other cuisines around. I also love their threaded-quality choupsuey which are crispier, much slender and stir-fried with lesser oil. Other dishes are average, and somehow I feel the taste lacks authentic chinese savor and tinge. Price is a bit on the cheaper side considering the amount they serve. My rating for Capri would be 2.5 out of 5.

Located near Scottish Church College in Hedua, North Kolkata, Capri is one of the most popular names among a long stretch of restaurants on that road. Among all the restaurants in that area, Capri is my preferred choice.

Once you enter and go up the stairs you’ll find yourself in a small tidy room with 4 or 5 tables. The décor is simple. The ambiance is okay. Nothing fancy at all. Now for the food, the quantity and the quality are quite good. It’s one of the few restaurants in North Kolkata which serves Pork. There are a variety of dishes to choose from. I always choose Fried Rice with a new chicken/fish dish every time and I haven’t been disappointed at all till now. The service is quick and the staff is quite well mannered. The price is affordable

Definitely a must go if you want to grab a bite in that area!

Being the resident of South Kolkata, this is the first time I have been there with my brother. Came to know that this is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants of North Kolkata. This is a small duplex restaurant with ordinary ambience. Waiters are well behaved and service is good.Coming to the food, we had a sweet corn soup(not good), Mixed fried rice( with ample of fresh prawns, chicken and egg but the quality of rice is not good: it's not fine), schezwan chicken (having a red gravy not brown and a taste which is not good, chicken pieces are not properly cooked also). Cost is medium.

In college and uni, this would be the place for cheap eats and birthday celebration for friends. Nowadays, I come here to pack away food or sit down and have the pepper chicken, ginger fish and fried rice. Probably one of the few restaurants in North Kolkata which serves pork and ham, Capri is one of the places which makes decent food at a price which I consider to be slightly over the mark area wise, but the quantities make up for it.
