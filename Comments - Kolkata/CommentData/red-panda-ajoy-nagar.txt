Location: Calcutta Greens Commercial Complex. 
Small joint with well decorated seating area. Prompt, very good service in restaurant and in home delivery also. The quality of food didn't change even during rush like durga puja or Christmas. Amazing food at this rate. The quantity is also sufficient. Already tried - 
1. Crispy Chilli Babycorn
2 . Chicken Lat Mei Kai (Favorite) 
3. Chicken wrapped prawns
4. Double Cooked Smoked Lamb
5. Hot Basil Chicken (really HOT! üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è) 
6. Shredded Chicken with Black pepper sauce (üòãüå∂Ô∏è) 
7. Malaysian noodles 
8. Chilli and Basil Fried Rice
9. Fish Otak Otak (Drooling ü§§) 
10. Mixed Nasi Goreng. (wish that Omelette had salt, and the rice had less soya sauce. But full of chicken and prawns!) 
I should start taking more photographs of food than just gorging on it! So many items are left to taste! üòÇü§¶

We went there on 1st of January 2018. Well first of all ambience wise its not that happening.. low ceiling is a bit of a headache for tall or average heighted people.. though cozy sitting and appropriate lighting were there. We visited near about 3 pm and the place was totally vacant at that point of time.. we were the first one to hold a table over there which was quite surprising to us! Later we realized that this place never gets too busy even on weekends or special occasions which is a good thing .
Anyway.. coming to food.. we had:

~Chicken Drums of Heaven
~Chicken Thai Green Curry which was served with rice.
~ Hakka style Lamb with soy garlic sauce
~ Chicken Singapore Rice Noodles
~ Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice
~ Thumbs Up 600 ml

The starter i.e Drums of Heaven felt like we were tasting something directly delivered from Heaven.. it tasted that delicious.. the chicken was succulent and juicy with just the right amount of spices and veggies added to it. It tasted just WOW! A must try if you are planning to visit this place.

Next , the Thai Green Curry was equally tasty with lots and lots of chicken and veggies and usage of very limited and right amount of spices made it quite appetizing .. the portion of the curry was enough for two. However, the plain rice served with it was portion wise a disappointment otherwise the duo tasted quite good.
Hakka style Lamb with soy garlic sauce was on the sweet side. It was not that spicy which it should have been but the shredded pieces of Lamb were a complete bliss!! Taste wise it was just okayish and a plate can easily be shared by two.
Chicken Singapore Rice Noodles was mouthwatering!! But quantity wise it was a complete disappointment. Very limited portion. Can barely serve a person with a big hunger.
Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice was quantity wise superb.. perfect for two.. but taste wise it was just okayish .. though they promised to add mushrooms and sweet corns along with chicken , prawn and egg but we only got chicken , egg and very few but quite big prawns.. huge scope for improvement over here.. Even the Chicken Fried Rice which we ordered as a parcel tasted much  better than this one..

The service was slow and when we asked them about it we got a reply that the staffs were having their lunch so they cannot come. Infact we had to personally go and get ourselves water ! We initially ordered sweet lime sodas but we later had to stick to thumbs up as the staffs were not available to prepare the sodas.. but, they were polite enough to apologize which was a good point.

However, kudos to them.. despite being a fine dine and an air conditioned restaurant they don't charge any extra taxes and even prices are quite reasonable!!

P.S - they also didn't charge any extra amount for packaging and other stuffs for the food which was parcelled. Everything was perfectly packed with care . Spoons, Forks and Tomato ketchup were also provided along with them.. really it's a very rare sight these days!

Overall a nice place to visit with your near and dear ones and have a huge fulfilling meal without even burning a hole in your pockets!

Happy eating! ‚ò∫

Was looking for a good Chinese outlet within reasonable price when this popped up among the suggestions. Located beside the main road E.M Bypass, this restaurant didn't fail to impress me with the best of their food. In fact I'm more than impressed. They provide a very good quantity with pocket friendly prices! I keep on recommending my friends to look out for this place. Most importantly, the staffs are really quick and they also have a good home-delivery network. ‚ù£

Visited the place on 31st night after reading reviews from Zomato. Food was good and value for food but the space is very small and also the waiter were not sure of the menu and quantity. Order chicken gravy noodles and hot garlic chicken and mixed fried rice. Better option for online and home delivery.

Ordered special chicken thupka, shezwan rice and shredded chicken with black pepper sauce. The food is delicious and the quantity is ample. Can try this eatery anytime as quite pocket friendly. Will love to visit again.

I came to know about Red Panda few months back from a friend. Never had the opportunity to dine in there but last Sunday ordered our lunch from there.
I ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Shredded Chicken with Black Pepper Sauce. Quantity wise the chicken item was enough for two persons. Fried rice had good amount off egg, chicken and it tasted nice. It was nothing special but nice. I felt that the chicken item was different from other restaurants. It didn't has too much of gravy. I liked the taste of it very much.
Overall Red Panda is a very nice place to have quality Chinese at this area. Pricing is also affordable.

Small crammed place. The AC wasn't on when we entered and it was extremely suffocating.
There was only one guy to take orders from all the tables and he was flustered.
The food was okay-ish..we ordered for a chicken sizzler, baby corn and squid
The other two dishes were good, but the squid wasn't well cooked and the taste got me nauseated.
The sizzler was a lot in Quantity for the price. Also had a poached egg. It was good.
It was an average experience. Probably won't be going back there.

It's a small outlet located in the Calcutta Greens complex, and tall people literally have to bow down while entering the restaurant!
The food was delicious but I reduced the rating to 3 because of their egg hakka chow which was burnt but they never cared to replace it nor did they apologize for their mistake . I loved the vegetable sweet corn soup, gravy egg chow, the pan fried grilled fish was nice and soft but the crispy chilli baby corn was way too crispier than required!

Ajoynagar is a place for Adda after college, filling stomach of people who came there after watching movie. As I leave near to this place, I visit this place quite often and have tried almost every eatery be it food stall or dine-in. But I found none which can satisfy my taste buds although they don't burn a hole in the pocket. Then I found Red panda which statisfies your taste buds and also doesn't burn a hole in the pocket. The place is quite small and you've to bend down to enter and also service is a bit slow which can be problem during time of rush. But then, such good food at such low rate won't let complain much. 
Coming to food, we ordered Konjee Crispy Chicken which was crispy and the sauce is quite nice in taste. Then we ordered Schezwan Fried Rice and Braided Fish in hot garlic sauce. The rice which was good but not much spicy like Schezwan. The gravy of Braised fish tasted awesome and the pieces are big in size, 6 in number and is medium spicy.

Great food. Had ordered through Swiggy and it was a huge order so they initially missed an item, but immediate care was taken when informed. Coming to the food, we had Mixed pan fried cantonese noodles, egg ginger capsicum fried rice, grilled chicken drumsticks, pan fried chilli fish and mongolian lamb.
The last 3 dishes were beyond beautiful. The noodles were nice too, loaded with egg, meat, prawns, mushrooms and baby corns. The fried rice was okayish. But overall, the food was very delightful on our palates and easy on our pockets. Highly recommended!!!!

Ordered Veg Hakka Noodles with Mushroom and baby corn topping and Chicken Drums Of heaven. I was very excited to have drums of heaven as I read good reviews on Zomato, but I am disappointed. It had too much coating instead of meat, and although I understand they are giving 8 pieces but would have been better if it had 4 pieces of good quantity meat instead of all the coating. To be honest, I didn't like it all that much, and couldn't understand what was all the hype about this particular dish. Coming to the Veg Hakka, it was good. Nothing extraordinary but good enough to eat. I like it.

A tiny place located in Ajoy Nagar near Udita residential towers. From outside, one is bound to suspect if it would be that good. But fret not. This place is unlike its neighbours and offers great Chinese at jaw dropping prices. The diner is led up to a first floor make shift area through a woobly flight of stairs but upon entering one would be decently pleased to find the neatly done decor. The chairs are comfortable and the place is spacious. The Chinese music that plays in the background is so soothing that it immediately snatches your attention. Tried out quite a few of their dishes and liked their salad 'Larb Gai' the most. The lamb dishes here are also subtle and calls for a must try. The portions on offer are sufficient for 2 and the average spending comes at around Rs.350-600, depending on what you order. This place definitely stands tall amongst all other restaurants of the locality.

It's a small place with 5-6 tables , decoration is okay , not so well decorated .
Coming to Food ; we had Tom-yum soup (chicken) , Schezwan chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken
Quantity is more than enough for two people , which is really satisfying
But in fried rice , they need to increase the quantity of chicken pieces as it was very very less in amount!
Except this problem we Enjoyed everything ‚ò∫Ô∏è
They don't charge extra amount on bill , it means you have to pay what you are having

** After puja , price of every item is increased at least 15-20 rupees , it isn't't updated still **

Red Panda is a small little restaurant located in Ajoy Nagar, near Survey Park. The place has a nice decor with a lovely ambience built up by Chinese music. The lighting and the paintings makes up for a great ambience for a date on light budget. We ordered Drums of Heaven for starter which was delicious. It had eight pieces of chicken and tasted brilliant. For main course we ordered Nasi Goreng which happens to be the national dish of Indonesia. The spicy dish was very well made. The dish had a piece of omelette with it alongside rice. The prawn pieces were very soft and tasted delightfully well. The dish would easily suffice a couple of people especially after a starter like Drums of Heaven. As a whole, we were very satisfied with our experience at Red Panda.

The place is very small with seating available for around 15people. But the food is very good. We had chicken lat me Kai in starters. It was very good. And in main course we had Mongolian chicken and Malaysian chicken noodles. The quantity of the noodle is sufficient for two people. The quality of the food was very good and the staff was very well behaved. All in all a very nice place.

I took :-
*GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST WITH STICKY RICE : it tasted more like a fried rice. And chicken , well it didn't go well with my taste .

P.S - I might be quick to judge the restaurant by eating one food item and I may change it when I visit again .

1. Fish Otak Otak -  A grilled fish cake made of ground fish meat mixed with tapioca starch and spices. It is widely known across Southeast Asia, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The spices are too well balanced and the steam in the banana leaf sets it to a level apart.

2.Grilled Chicken Breast with Sticky Rice - Nothing better than grilled chicken, sticky rice (in basket) and dipping sauces! Sweet and Sour Sticky Thai Boneless Oven Baked Chicken breasts is a class apart.

3. Nasi Lemak - A Malay fragrant rice dish cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. It is served with a hot spicy sauce (sambal), and usually includes various garnishes, including fresh cucumber slices, small fried anchovies, roasted peanuts, and hard-boiled or fried egg.

Tempted enough? Dunk into the Pujo groove with the newest addition to the Kolkatan food map.Drop in today. Cheers!

Yesterday we went to Red panda for dinner. We ordered prawn tempura, green thai curry (chicken), Nasi Goreng and Braised fish in chilli bean sauce. All food are very tasty except prawn tempura. I felt prawn tempura is average. But all are really so good. We will go there again to try other dishes. It is very cheap with good quality.

We ordered twice from this joint in the past 3 weeks. The quality and quantity of the food is really good. We had their mixed hakka noodles, braised fish in chilli bean sauce and hot garlic chicken. All three items were well-prepared and tasted delicious. Their packaging was also satisfactory. Looking forward to ordering from them again in the future.

Visited this restaurant a couple of times before and was quite satisfied with their food.
But today I ordered a crispy chilli baby corn,which by every means was horrible.JUST RUINED MY MOOD.


I increased the ratings after being quite satisfied during the last visit.
Ordered chicken Malaysian noodles and tangra style dry chilli chicken
Both tasted pretty well.

The best place to have Chinese foods. The food is very tasty and the behaviour of the staffs are also very decent.
I came to know about this place from Zomato and I have visited the same place twice in a week only for their Chinese dishes.

Never fails to satisfy our taste buds. Really pleased to have such a nice food joint around my place. Though the area is infested with numerous food outlets but this one stands out for it's different (most them r biriyani places) menu and finger licking food.

Located amongst the tons of eateries near hiland park, from outside & even from inside this place will not please you at all, but oh boy! The cuisine they serve & the taste it offers is really enough to make your eyes go wide. Chinese, Thai & Oriental cuisine will be what you need to settle for. Floor space is really small, not recommended for large groups, even the ceiling is so low that you need to mind your head everytime you stand. Coming to the agenda for what we went there,
üçóGrilled Chicken Drumstick: crispy crust with juicy meat inside a must go for drumstick lovers. Even served in a sauce which was unique. Recommended.
üç§Sliced fish with roasted chilli & sichuan pepper: inspired from the chinese dish just like the long name the taste of it will also remain very long in your tastebuds. The fish just melts in your mouth like butter served with saut√©ed veggies. Highly Recommended.
üçöChilli & Basil fried rice: it is a bit on the spicier side but will go nicely with any gravy item. Portion is enough for two.
üçõThai Chicken Green Curry: very moderately spiced cooked with veggies went well with the rice. Surprisingly, with this curry they serve half a portion of boiled rice. Chicken pieces were sliced to perfection.
There are some places which have hindrances of space & ambience but that space crunch can be overlooked if they serve proper taste this place is amongst them. Rating solely given for the food & taste it offers. Ambience & service can be made better. Pocket pinch is on the lower side so ideal for students to hangout.
P.S.: Prices are inclusive so no extra charges, you pay for what you eat!

I visited the place with my partner sometime back. The ambience is really great. The price is cheap and affordable. We ordered for some chicken with sauteed veggies in oyster sauce. Brocolli and mushrooms being my favourite made the dish taste delicious. Later we ordered mix sea food fried rice and Shanghai prawn. The rice was well boiled and the prawn tasted good but the only problem with the rice was it was over fried and had little salt. Since it was mixed sea food rice the smell of squid and prawn made it smell like a rotten dish. But the overall presentation was good. If the price is taken in account then the place gets a thumbs up.

While returning from a tiring day at work, my irresistible momo craving brought us here. That was our 1st visit, last Jan & we had thought it to be a take away joint.. was excited to climb up the ladder to see the small but cosy & meticulous set up. Courteous staff, stylish cutlery and crockeries, good presentation & above all palatable food... definitely stands apart from the league of the relatively popular eateries of the area. Since then have ordered quite a few times (in large scale too) & their detailed packaging & timely home delivery have never disappointed me.  The only thing I need to mention here is the packaging cost which shouldn't be so high especially for the foil packs.. Dishes like Braised fish, crispy chicken, Chicken fried rice, hakka noodles are praiseworthy. Looking forward to try out their other specialities.

The food was delicious. We ordered Prawns tempura, Stir fried noodles in XO sauce, braised fish in chili wine sauce and mixed Nasi Ghoreng. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. The staff was hospitable and the ambience was soothing as slow Indonesian music played in the background. Would definitely visit again.

To tell you the truth you can hardly find such tasty chinese food at this price. Worth a visit. It was an unplanned visit with my friends on a lazy Satuday night. It's small joint near Ajaynagar. Dinning area is small , nothing impressive. We did not expect nothing great considering the ambiance and such pocket friendly price. We casually ordered Mixed Gravy Chowmein,  Ginger and pepper fried rice(mixed) and a lamb dish(dont exactly remember the name). The food was served in 5 minutes and it was too good. We did not expect this. Very statisfied and highly imressed. I myself personally met the manager and praised him. Look forward to visit it again with family and friends.

Trust me if you take anyone here you can't stop cuddling the food.
Me along with my foodie mates of Team PanchPhoron were invited there to taste the food.
We tasted a 5 Course Meal there but from all of them OTAK OTAK was the show stopper.

Though I loved other food too, OTAK OTAK was very innovative and I'll say it's a must try for you..

We tasted seafood fried rice with Fish...Fish was cooked so nicely..

I actually liked each dishes. so you can go and give it a try from this place at any time.

Asian cuisine includes several major regional cuisines East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian,¬†Central Asian & Middle Asian. usually associated with a specific culture. Asia being the largest and most populous continent is home to many cultures. being a hardcore foodie most of the time I prefer to eat outside, side by side I do like home-made¬†food. in Calcutta you‚Äôll find not only Bengali cuisines, Chinese, Thai and many other cuisines there to serve traditional & authentic dishes of the county. recently I went to a place which is known by the name of ‚ÄúRed Panda‚Äù, serve really good Asian dishes. it was a meet up over some food, I and my fellow foodie friends are invited there to a food tasting session. this place serves really good Chinese, Thai and Japanese dishes. we tried some of the signature dishes of this restaurant. this place is located in EM Bypass, Ajay¬†Nagar, walking distance from Ajay Nagar more.

Oriental Food is not only a complex combination of different flavours but also a combination of different cultures as well. If you want to taste some great quality Oriental food then Red Panda in Ajaynagar has the perfect recipe for you. This is a really small outlet sits right on the edge of the main service road with a big Red Panda Banner which is very difficult to neglect. The restaurant has two sections, ground floor is for the takeaways and for the Dine in you have to climb up the ladder. This is a small but nice and cosy place. In spite of the space crunch they keep this place very clean and maintain proper hygiene. Me along with the members of PanchPhoron went there for a food tasting event and we really amazed by the quality and quantity of the food they served. The dishes were as follows : Fresh Lime Soda, Vietnamese pho Soup Chicken, Fish Otak Otak, Grilled Chicken Breast with Sticky Rice, Nasi Lemak, Seafood Fried Rice, Braised Fish in Chill Bean Sauce.

Located amongst the series of eateries near ambuja at ajaynagar, RED PANDA is definitely a 'chota-packet  bara dhamaka' restraunt!üòçüòç The ground floor is where the take away section is and the 1st floor has the sitting accommodation. The staircase that takes you to the1st floor is a bit risky but it definitely adds a rare charm to the place. The 1st floor has a small but a comfortable sitting arrangement for not more than 16-18 people. The best part is that the place is absolutely not at all clingy and cramped and you can enjoy your privacy totally. üòç  Infact it has a soothing ambience with dim lights and soulful music being played all through. Another noteworthy feature was their smart and stylish cutlery sets.üòç


Talking about the food... it has got one of the best flavours and aura that satiates your hunger completely.üòçüòç We wanted to have a plate of momo but most probably they don't serve any kind of dim-sums in the afternoon. We finally ordered chicken sechzwan fried rice and crispy stir fried chicken with assorted mushroom in ginger sauce. Both the dishes were excellent. They also serve Thai and seafood dishes. The quantity was huge.. a single bowl of cereal was enough for two üòõ. The price is utterly reasonable and so is pretty pocket friendly.ü§ìü§ì

The staffs and sevice of the place was quite polite and gentle and were very courteous in natureü§ì. 
So, if you want to satisfy and please your tummy with delicious food at reasonable prices... Red Panda is where you should visit. üòçü§ìüòçü§ì

This place is at a stone's throw distance from my house and in my opinion "THE LONE RANGER"( serving proper Chinese) in a stretch mostly dominated by an array of international chains as well as Indian restaurants. But that it has carved a niche for itself even among stiff competition is evident as the name has been popping up during the past few months in various blogs, reviews, articles and in social media as well. Recently opted for a takeaway from here. My order consisted of very basic items, quality and quantity of food is sufficient. Very pocket friendly place - a much needed one in our locality. Would definitely dine out here sometime to try Thai dishes as well. Till then a 3.5 from my end should suffice as I have high expectations from this place.

A small well decorated restaurant near ajaynagar... This is one place where you go grab a quick bite when you're on the run, and to that respect, it won't disappoint you. The momos are good and the gravy noodles not so bad. Quantity is okay as well. However the service is a bit on the slow side but that's okay. However a friend of mine once had crispy chilly baby corn out there and after that day, she has vowed never to have baby corn again. Might want to look into it! Overall it's nice, not bad.. They have chopsticks!

This place is at a stone's throw distance from my house and in my opinion "THE LONE RANGER"( serving proper Chinese) in a stretch mostly dominated by an array of international chains as well as Indian restaurants. But that it has carved a niche for itself even among stiff competition is evident as the name has been popping up during the past few months in various blogs, reviews, articles and in social media as well. Recently opted for a takeaway from here. My order consisted of very basic items, quality and quantity of food is sufficient. Very pocket friendly place - a much needed one in our locality. Would definitely dine out here sometime to try Thai dishes as well. Till then a 3.5 from my end should suffice as I have high expectations from this place.

A small well decorated restaurant near ajaynagar... This is one place where you go grab a quick bite when you're on the run, and to that respect, it won't disappoint you. The momos are good and the gravy noodles not so bad. Quantity is okay as well. However the service is a bit on the slow side but that's okay. However a friend of mine once had crispy chilly baby corn out there and after that day, she has vowed never to have baby corn again. Might want to look into it! Overall it's nice, not bad.. They have chopsticks!

Ordered crispy fried brocolo got cauliflower instead
These people don't seem to know the difference between cauliflower and broccoli or they fool people intentionally. My friend told me about a similar incident he faced while ordering from zomato. I guess its my fault that I tried to order from a shitty place
 Edit: I called them and they replaced my dish, very much satisfied with the service

If you are looking for a really good chinese yet pocket friendly, you must pay a visit to Red panda. Yesterday night we 7 people went there. We ordered for Garlic Butter Fish and Pan fried chilli fish in starter. I must say the fish was really good.. In main course we ordered for Stir fried noodles with XO sauce(Japan), Mixed fried Rice, Nasi Lemak ( it's a Malaysian dish, more kind of combo platter serves butter rice, chicken in a spicy gravy which tasted like coastal curry with coconut and other spices,,,person who like super hot dish, this one is perfect) a boiled egg and salad, devil's Lamb and Hongkong Chicken (yummiest chicken dish i hv ever had). Each n every dish was perfectly done. Lamb was soft. Staff beahaviour was very good. Though the space is very small, this one is perfect for a family dinner as well as friends hang out. All the best Red Panda team ....

A nice and quaint place in Ajoy Nagar, Red Panda a new kid in the block. What's good about this place is that it isn't your run of the mill Chinese takeaway place by the corner of the road. It's experimenting with different flavours, tastes and ingredients. The ambience in general was warm and cosy. While the place is small, it is not crammed. It has the arrangement for seating hardly 20-25 people. So you can more or less enjoy your privacy while enjoying your dinner. You have climb a small staircase to reach the restaurant; I tried not to be disheartened by the disagreeable scenes at the bottom of the stairs, especially since it was raining heavily the day I went there. But once I was up inside the restaurant, the scene definitely changed. The food here is quite good, and I really liked their chicken drumsticks, sliced fish with chilli and pepper, lemon butter fish, and Thai green curry. The only problem I found with the fish dishes was that even though they had used Indian basa, the pieces were dense like Rohu, which I believe was because of overcooking. I also found the squid fries a little floury. All in all, the place is nice and has the potential to do a lot better in the hands of the dedicated management.

Red Panda is located somewhere near Ajoynagar.
4 days back we ordered home delivery from them.

Packing was very good.. 

Chiecken Fried Rice was very simple as well as the chilli chicken. Apart from those two Mongolian Chicken and Malasiyan Hakka Chowmien was very good...

Decided to order take out from here after reading all the abive average reviews. Stepwise my experience is as follows:
1) Placing of order was done effortlessly .... person on the other end of the phone was aware of the menu and was quick, pleasant and efficient.
2) Delivery time- order arrived on time.
3) Portion Size- small; but do keep in mind that their prices are slightly lower.
4) Taste- we had the crispy chilli baby corn, veg fried rice, egg chk noodles and egg chk fried rice, sesame paneer, mongolian chicken and sweet and sour crispy chicken. Overall in entirety the food was mediocre at best. The mongolian chicken was bland  ... a few pieces of chicken swimming in a tasteless gravy. On a positive note the fried rice and noodles were not not swimming in oil ( unlike a lot of other places).

Over all a below avg to average experience. Should have given it a 2 .... but the fact that my lips did not gleam like the sun once I dug into the rice and noodles deserves an extra point in my book.

This place is near Ambuja, Ajay nagar. We were searching for a Chinese restaurant nearby, and this place seemed nice from outside. So we decided to give it a try and of course we were not disappointed. We ordered egg and mixed chowmein and dry chilli chicken. The chowmein were awesome and chilli chicken was also good. Though this is an AC restaurant, they charged us only what was mentioned in menu card. And the price is also very pocket friendly compared to the quantity and quality. I would like to visit this place again.

Red Panda ,Restaurant located at¬†F5 Calcutta Greens Commercial Complex, 1050/2, EM Bypass, Survey Park, Santoshpur, Kolkata, West Bengal 700075¬†(Very close to METROPOLIS MALL ,HILAND PARK AREA ) has been lately the kind of place i was never ever aware of and it was a sad thing for me that i pass the Bypass stretch almost two to three times a week and i have never ever came across this place maybe because these are the real hidden gems in the city and one needs to get there when you tend to have that exploring thing in you.Fortunately i did not need to trouble myself discovering this place on my own as an invitation had popped by the management of Red Panda and Blogger Debajyoti of Foodie dada .I was extremely excited to know how this restaurant fairs in all the possible angles of lookout ,so on the day of my very first visit i started early to battle the storm and rain that was about to shatter and wash the city clean ,i guess the Weather God wanted me to have an adventurous day and not just sit and happily eat carefree (Giggles) . So on that note saying so it took me around more than an hour to reach here with all the traffic moving swiftly right from Rajarhat area so its quite a distance for me yet i will be there and everywhere when needed to do so.

The city dwellers have lately developed affection for South East Asian cuisine and have started to fit in Thai or Burmese food beside the Chinese delicacies which has been ruling the Kolkata culinary scenarios for decades now. You will find several new eateries or grandiose restaurants coming up in the city serving these soul-pleasing Asian dishes. Some of the old eateries have remodeled and realigned themselves to fit in into this segment which is really trending these days among foodies. In some recent blog post I have expressed my love for these cuisines and how I can have them everyday, if it‚Äôs well prepared and comes close enough to the authentic dishes. I do cook them back at home as well to satiate my cravings at odd hours! And every time one such eatery opens up in the city, I somehow make it a point to visit them at least once. Recently, I came across one such eatery called ‚ÄòRed Panda‚Äô which is less than an year old now. They serve most of these South East Asian cuisines with an emphasis on the Chinese cuisine and have got an enormous menu which is sure to impress you. In fact, they are trying to serve the typical Indo-Chinese cuisine as well which is popular in Kolkata. Most importantly, they won‚Äôt burn a hole in your pocket. The prices are extremely reasonable keeping in mind the quality and quantity served.

If u order food at 5 pm with guests at your place, with an expectation that you will be able to serve food to them within 6 pm then this food joint is not meant for u.the delivery boy will not be knowing proper locations with distinguished landmarks for delivering your food.you will have to wait till 8 pm for the food and subsequently cancel the order.when u personally visit the food joint to complain about the same they will apologise but the services will remain the same.had very bitter experiences with this food joint and would not recommend it to anyone,thanks to their pathetic service and harsh behaviour..

Don't exactly know its location, but somewhere in Ajoynagar side, as the food got delivered by the food delivery app.. Had a very bad experience with the app as it took around 1.5hrs to get the parcel delivered and that too after several phone calls...

Anyway coming to the food, packaging was impressive.. it came in a thaali type plastic container... Had ordered Non-veg combo 1 and 2...Combo 1 had Fried Rice, 4 pieces of Chicken Manchurian and vegetable salad...Combo 2 had all the items of Combo 1 with an addition being 2 pieces of Chicken Pakora with a tomato ketchup satchet...

Fried rice was good with adequate veggies...chicken manchurian was full of chillies and only chillies, thus I could not have the gravy, anyhow managed with the chicken pieces which were thankfully soft and well cooked although small in size...chicken pakora was the best...

Pocket pinch I felt was high in comparison to the amount and quality served...

This is a fairly tiny restaurant seating about 16 people, but the ambiance is soothing, thanks to the lamps hung around. We had ordered Seafood Fried Rice with Braised Fish with Chili Bean Sauce, and Malaysian Chowmein with Hakka Lamb in Soy Sauce. The food arrived pretty fast. The Braised Fish was the best, very soft and comes in 6 pieces. The Noodles was moderately spicy, and the Seafood Rice had an egg-like smell, but it was not bad. I'd have given it 4 stars if not for the lamb which was not soft, but hard and chewy.

Red Panda is the brainchild of a bunch of good folks trying their best to serve good quality Chinese food to the ever so hungry patrons of the city . In a market already congested with so many Asian joints it is not easy to come up and declare yourself . But a catchy brand name , some really fantastic dishes served in a hearty quantity and an amicable service has helped them to catch quite a bit of attention . And who knows , maybe someday this brand catches up with the other big daddies of Chinese cuisine in our city . I am really optimistic about this and trust me , I have got considerable reason to vouch for my optimism .

I found the food to be pretty good for the price they offered, so I would definitely recommend it for ones with a tight pocket.
‚Ä¢ The Veg Hakka Noodles was so good. It was not very salty, which was a win win as I do not like too much salt. The noodles were not of chowmein texture like with other restaurants, it was more of a Maggi texture. 
‚Ä¢ Chilli Chicken was SO GOOD. It had the skin still in some areas. The chicken was juicy and not dry, overcooked. The gravy was amazing with loads of chillies
‚Ä¢ There was one dish which I would recommend against and that is the Kimchi. Kimchi is supposed to be a cold dish but it was cooked. And not only that, it also had a bad aftertaste which spoiled it totally! 
‚Ä¢ The one dish I do not have a picture of and was the dish of the day was the Veg Steamed Momo and it was a delight to have. Filled to the brim, you could tell the chef didn't hold back with the filling and the coating was not too flour-y. Such a beauty it was!

At a stone's throw distance from Highland park, red panda is a small Chinese restaurant opposite of SRFTI campus. 
The restaurant features a well trained chef who brings finesse to the wide range of exquisite Chinese dishes they present in their menu. The taste of each dish is distinct and differs from the other. @
Apart from a professional kitchen, the restaurant features an amiable hospitality team that takes good care of the food lovers that walk in. Good food is served with a smile and with good vibes. 
The restaurant features a feedback system through which customers and communicate with the management team regarding their suggestions or complaints. The review board is checked regularly and improvements are implemented regularly. 
However , due to lack of space the restaurant doesn't host a wash basin.  The hospitality team however has a way to tackle this problem by providing hot water bowls for washing purposes. 
Overall, it's a good restaurant to visit with family as well as friends. Food is served at good speed at astoundingly reasonable prices for the quality they provide.

The dearth of good eateries near our localities and the zomato ratings made me pay a visit to this place. It was a bit disappointing for me. The small place has been really worked out well and doesnot give a claustrophobic feeling all decked up with the comfy seating, soothing lighting and minimal decor. Full points for that.
As for the food I had ordered crispy chilli babycorn, veg hakka chowmein and hong kong chicken. The babycorn was fine and the quantity is sufficient for 3 people. The chowmein had no salt in it. And the hong kong chicken was average. No mocktails or desserts were available. I somehow found that the cooking oil was not up to the mark as every food had a bit odd taste in it. This heat coupled with a bad cooking medium can make people fall sick. So if care is taken in this part then I guess a lot of issues will be solved. Coming to the price, it is really very cheap with no added taxes. But a bit improvement in quality won't harm your food joint even if you increase the prices cause Good food is everything that one wants.

It's not the popular version with tamarind sauce and groundnuts.The green curry is good.A little sweet for my liking.Packing is good and even on a Sunday evening the turnaround time was decent.

Was looking for a decent place serving pan asian cuisine when I came across this restaurant in my vicinity. Boy they are much better than a decent restaurant. 
Fish in oyster sauce was great, a bit salty just like it should be. Garlic butter fish is creamy and yet not too overpowering. Stir fried Asian greens was a bit bland I thought‚Äã. The Cantonese soy sauce noodles was a bit disappointing though. 
Definitely want to visit again. And last but not least they serve quite big portions.

Was very happy with the food and service here. Small outlet at the Ambuja stretch. They serve authentic Thai, Indonesian and Chinese cuisine here. We tried the Nasi Goreng, Thai green curry (less spicy Thai curry with plain rice) and salt and pepper chicken. The quantity was huge, the food was tasty and the price was affordable. They do not charge taxes also. Definitely recommending this place.

I love Chinese cuisine, and I'm always on the lookout for new places serving Chinese. So when I got an invitation to Red Panda, I was thrilled!! Before starting my review, I would like to mention this - I LOVED RED PANDA!!!! 

Located near Udita, on EM Bypass this is a gem of a place, and I'm so glad I had an opportunity to visit it. The place is small and cozy. It has a takeaway section in the ground floor, and the mezzanine floor has been turned into the restaurant. Don't get fooled by the pictures up on Zomato, this place looks vibrant and well lit in reality! The seating arrangement is commendable, as the management has put the small space into great use, not making it in the least bit crammed! 

Now coming to the best part of the evening - THE FOOD! 

When we were handed the menu, we were baffled at the variety of the items. Thank God our menu was pre set, other wise we would end up ordering everything I guess! So let's begin. 

We started our evening with a glass of chilled Blue Lagoon, which we were told was a new inclusion to their menu along with desserts. The drink was refreshing and soothed our souls. 

‚Ä¢ Manchow Soup - Next up was the Manchow Soup which was a stunner. I usually avoid soups, but here I fell in love with this one. The huge quantity was something that I must add (one serving is enough for 2 people, and that is a lot!). The soup was rich in flavour and minced chicken, topped with perfectly fried noodles. Perfect start to the food tasting session, I must say! 

‚Ä¢ Cantonese Soy Sauce Pan Fried Noodles - Thoroughly impressed with the soup, we went for our next dish which proved to be excellent! Being an avid lover of noodles, for me this was perfection on a plate. The noodles were fried to perfection and had an abundance of chicken, broccoli, babycorn and capsicum. Tasted delicious! 

‚Ä¢ Seafood Fried Rice - Almost full, when this was served to us, we were awestruck! The aroma, the quantity, the flavour, everything was bang on. The rice was rich in exotic seafood like squids and prawns. We coupled this dish with 2 side dishes of fish and lamb and it tasted brilliant. The rice was amazing and I loved it!! Priced unbelievably at 170 bucks, this is bomb!

‚Ä¢ Braised Fish in Chilli Bean Sauce - 6 large pieces of fish were served which was almost melting in my mouth. The gravy was rich and tasted amazing with the rice. The fish was fresh and had a beautiful texture. Loved this dish too. Highly recommended.

‚Ä¢ Hakka Style Lamb in Soy Garlic Sauce - The best dish of the evening hands down. If you love lamb, you just can't give this dish a miss! Again the texture and taste gave me food coma, and I was left wanting more. Coupled with the rice, it tasted even more fantastic. My advice : Don't leave Red Panda without tasting this delicacy.

‚Ä¢ Darsaan with Ice Cream - Time for dessert! As mentioned earlier, this is a new inclusion to their menu. I've always been a fan of Darsaan ever since I've tried it, and here too, it wasn't an exception! The flour chips were crispy and was served with a topping of honey and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. This was the sweetest ending to our gastronomical evening. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the evening, and I thank Mr. Rabi Sankar Saha for inviting us. He was a great company and explained to us, the intricacies of each dish. 

Verdict - Must visit because of this amazing quantity and quality. Also one has to keep in mind the nominal rates. Extremely affordable! 

All my love and best wishes to Team Red Panda. It was a pleasure to taste such lipsmacking delicacies!

Ordered their food many times through Swiggy..but personally visited today for lunch. Very cozy restaurant situated in d area between ajay nagar and hiland park. There is a small seating arrangement but very tasteful and well decorated. The staffs are good and food is very tasty..
They prepare not only chinese but also thai, japanese etc. We ordered Pan fried Cantonese noodles and also Japanese style chicken teriyaki.Both the food were tasty and adequate in amount.At d end its pocket friendly also.They dont charges extra for serving you food in AC and wid some nice music.

Hidden gem of Kolkata food joints & a must visit. Its a small place but they make up the scarcity of space with their warm hospitality & an array of lip-smacking chinese delicacies. We started off with Crispy chilly babycorn which was good but nothing special, Japanese grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce & boiled vegetables- loved it very much. For main course we took Seafood mixed fried rice - in love with the preparation. Its a must order. Squids were fresh & flavours could be enjoyed in each and every spoonful. Lastly ordered some wok fried prawns with cashewnuts - well it was good but not that great. By this time we were so full that we could not enjoy the Darsan with ice cream but it was great nonetheless. Its a must visit for all foodies. Attaching few snaps.

Food is good. Liked the Chicken teriyaki and Mongolian Chicken. 
Though the place is quite small, we didn't mind that. The service - that's another matter altogether. Clueless and obviously untrained staff. Our table did not have forks and spoons for all of us. Water wasn't served till we asked thrice for it and the dinner plates came AFTER the meal was already served. 
They were all quite polite though. 
Conclusion: I may order take out from them but not coming back to dine here.

Red Panda, one of the finest Chinese restaurant in Survey Park area, turned out to be a hidden gem. It was quite far from my place and I wasn't really anxious to visit this place. But one fine day, I received an invitation for a food tasting event from the owner of this place and that actually changed my entire vision about this place. To be honest, I had expected the food to taste pretty normal. But every dish that I tried here, exceeded all my expectations and left me speechless.

Red Panda is located beside Udita, close to EM Bypass. I was accompanied by Nilanjana Bagchi . There's a small takeaway counter in the ground floor. The mezzanine floor was beautifully decorated with a seating capacity of 16 people. Though small, the place wasn't cramped up. The seats were very comfortable. I somehow felt the place has much more potential than what it looked from outside and I was proven true with every dish that was served on our plates.

The menu is different, rather interesting, compared to the other Chinese restaurants in the vicinity. There were a huge number of options and we would have had a tough time to decide the menu, if it wasn't pre set for our dinner. What surprised us was the economy factor, which was looked after with great care. The menu looked very pocket friendly even for students.

We started with blue lagoon. We were informed that the drinks and desserts had been just added to the menu and we were the first to try them. The blue lagoon was perfectly sweet, chilled and refreshing.

Moving ahead, we had Manchow Soup. Considering the portion and the nominal price, we were taken aback. One portion was divided into two large bowls, each of which is enough for a single person. The soup was dense and rich in minced chicken and veggies. The noodles on top were absolutely crispy. The soup was very tasty and gave a delicious start to our dinner.

Next we had the Cantonese Soy Sauce Pan Fried Noodles. In one word, it was amazing ! The pan fried noodles were topped with large chicken slices, mushroom, babycorn, broccoli, capsicum, etc. The quantity was perfect for two of us. Want to know the price? It's just 150 bucks ! I can't recall any casual dining restaurant charging so less for a plate of pan fried noodles decked up with so many ingredients and that too in generous quantity ! I was actually overwhelmed. The noodles tasted excellent. The sauce was subtle and flavourful.

We were full ! Yes, with just a soup and a plate of pan fried noodles, we were full. You can imagine the quantity. But seeing the seafood Fried rice arrive, I somehow managed to create some space in my stomach. The Seafood Fried rice was loaded with squid and shrimps along with fish and egg. That's something exotic, which you can't miss out ! The quantity of rice at just 170 bucks with the generous portions of seafood was really surprising. The first time I tried it, I was taken aback by its mild flavour. Also the amazing texture of the squid was commendable.

We paired the Seafood Fried Rice with a fish and a lamb side dish. The Braised Fish in Chilli Bean Sauce was one of its kind. The sauce was medium spicy and tasted very good. Six pieces of fish were served in a portion. The pieces were unexpectedly large. I fell in love with the texture of the fish. The soft and delicate fish just melted in my mouth, taking me to a gastronomical journey. I'd definitely recommend everyone to try out this particular dish at Red Panda. This would definitely impress you in terms of quality, quantity and taste !

Hakka Style Lamb with Soy Garlic Soy once again stood upto our expectations. The texture was something that blew me over. Perhaps, it was the best oriental preparation of lamb I've ever had. The quantity was once again great. I'm revisiting Red Panda for this one again !

We were too stuffed to even breathe. But then the dessert arrived and as they say, 'There's always a special room for desserts. They do not go to the stomach. They enter our heart !' A plate of Darsaan was brought before us. Darsaan is a very common dessert available at almost all Chinese dine in restaurants and I was kinda bored of it. But the darsaan I tried here, tasted out of the world. The crispness of the flour chips, the texture, the sweetness imparted by honey and everything else was picture perfect. I was glad to have such a beautiful darsaan after many days !

Overall, I can call this place to be my best discovery of this year. Unexpectedly, it proved to be a hidden gem. The service and hospitality were of top notch. The food exceed all my expectations. I'm looking forward to come back again and devour everything that's available here !

On the first day I and my wife just casually hopped there for some momo. It was awesome. Also the noodles over there are so good. Though the room is small but the ambiance of Red Panda is very good and quite pleasant. I liked the restaurant and its food so much that I went there again after some days. I have to taste their other foods also . ¬†Staffs are friendly and both the quality and quantity of the food are much better than any other frequently seen Chinese restaurants in the town. I strongly recommend Red Panda for the foodies.

I heard about Red Panda from a friend of mine. Since it is located very near to my place I seleted this place for my poila baishakh dinner.
It is very easy to locate. Just get down at the ambuja stoppage and after crossing the road one will see this place just adjacent to Neil's Kitchen. 
It is a small and cozy place with a very soothing music playing in the background. There are 4 tables, with 4 chairs each. 
We started off with starters... 
Japanese style grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce- it tasted amazing. I absolutely loved it. The chicken was well cooked and soft. The sauce was yummy. The flavour of the grilled chicken was too good. It was served with veggies like baby corn, carrot, capsicum, etc. 
Konjee crispy lamb- the lamb was good as well. It was crispy and well cooked. Tasted good. 
The dishes for the main course were:
Cantonese soy sauce pan fried noodles (mixed) - the quantity and the quality was great. There were generous amount of chicken egg and prawn. 
Mongolian chicken- there were eight pieces of chicken. Tasted good. The chicken was soft and tender. 
Overall I am very much satisfied. We also could avail the poila baishakh offer which was 10% off on billing of Rs. 500 and above. 
Definitely coming back to try out the other dishes. :)

Ordered fish fingers through them they were good but the sizes were little small and thin as compare to the usual fingers, they provided it with some tartar sauce and French fries which was the best..

Day 2 : ordered through food delivery app two types of non veg combos from here. The taste was nice except the drumstick which was overfried and broken,packaging was neat.. only thing is that I have got some insect in my khimchi salad which disappointed me, didn't expect that there will be some hygiene issues from a good restaurant like this.. I think they should work hard in terms of maintaining the hygiene otherwise they can loose good customers.

This is absolutely the new food place to visit in Kolkata. A quaint little restaurant with a very charming golden beige interior, it gives you the feel of a Parisian cafe, with beautiful music and Kolkata captured in beautiful photos. Coming to the food, which is the most important for any restaurant goer, this place just delights. Each dish that we ordered was mouthwatering good. One must absolutely try the wantons. Crispy, light, and the stuffing is moist and melt in your mouth and the homemade sauce they give with it has the perfect oriental  blend of sweet and chilly. The ginger and pepper fried rice is really good. We tried it with  double cooked smoky lamb which was really nice. But the best dish was the dry chilly chicken. The Prawn Tempura was very fresh. We had also ordered crispy konjee fish, which was one of the best starter fish dishes I have had in a very long time. We ultimately finished it off with Darshan with ice cream for dessert, which I have to say, is the best honey glazed crispy noodles I have ever had. I would go so far as to say that this is definitely one of their dessert specialities. Loved the food and the ambience. Red Panda is most definitely one of my favorite restaurants now.

The restaurants with the name "red" in it seems to be the new trend in kolkata like red bamboo shoot,red hot chilli pepper, red kitchen & lounge and recently red panda but the common factor between all of them is that they are running successfully. Yesterday i decided to taste the food from this new place & hence i opted for home delivery via swiggy.

I had the following items:-

1. Gai sai takrai with herbs - A thai started which had generous amounts of light crusted shredded chicken with shallow fried capsicum,bell peppers,mushroom,broccoli,onions & chillies. The vegetable preparation was a standout due to its peppery taste. The chicken itself was outstanding to eat. Recommended!!

2. Schezwan chicken friedrice - Huge quantity of friedrice prepared in schezwan sauce. The friedrice was different as compared to other place since it had lots of solid pepper which kind of ruined the spicy taste but in fact it was different to eat.

3. Fish in chilli bean sauce - Spicy dish which had 6 medium sized bhetki pieces. The sauce was superbly made. The fish itself was very fresh & the quality was top notch. Highly recommended!!

4. Chicken malaysian noodles - This was the star of my order. I'm an ardent lover of friedrice but i liked this dish more than the friedrice. Thick noodles prepared in spicy malaysian flavours with lemongrass. I loved the infusion of lemongrass taste into the noodles which gave a very subtle distinct taste which was tantalising. The chicken & eggs were in generous. This dish was just sumptuous. Highly recommended dish!!

The pocket pinch is on the lower side with no extra taxes being charged. Looking to try more of their food items in the near future!!

This restaurant is located near hiland park,very easy to locate it. Small space but nicely decorated and the stuff was nice. We ordered double cooked lamb as starter which was awesome. After that we had fried rice and Hong Kong chicken, both were ok. The price was tax included!! Therefore, it's very much pocket friendly!!

I had ordered home delivery through Swiggy for one of their Chinese combo meals. The combo included Egg fried rice, chicken in hot garlic sauce and kimchi salad. Portion size was quite good for one person. They gave 3 pieces of chicken unlike other places which serve only 2 for combo meals. Taste was decent. The combo was only for 115rs with some added delivery charges. Pocket friendly I must say ‚ò∫

Located just in a few minutes walking distance from.Metropolis Mall. Nice Decor and Ambience. They basically serve Chinese , Thai dishes. The food quality and presentation really was better than expectation. Had Stired Fried Momo , which was really amazing. Hakka noodles was ok. I think they should emphasis on the main dishes a bit. 
But definitely recommend. Probably its location is not helping to create the hype as supposed to be.

A small cozy eatery on the bank of EM Bypass just 2 min walk from Metropolis Mall. Visited here on an invitation from the owner Rabi da, who asked me come and try their food, and I was very delighted to find quality food at very very affordable price.
So coming to the food directly. Here are the things I would recommend you to try here.
‚Ä¢Chicken Wanton : Crispy Fried dim sum with a sweet chilli dip. Its a wonderful item and you shouldn't miss it out, that too at just Rs.80
‚Ä¢Soup of the day (Chef special) : We were served with Lemon and Coriander soup, had a bit more of Lemon in it.
For the mains to took the
‚Ä¢ Malaysian Chowmine Mixed : Very good to try. The quantity is enough to serve 2 adult. Good amount of Prawn, Chicken and egg in it. Had Lemon leafs which gave it a touch of Asian cuisine.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Hong Kong : It was a hit in the table. My friends loved it. Comes in 8 pieces, perfect spicy. Would love to have it again on my next visit.
‚Ä¢ Pepper and Garlic Prawn : This was mind blowing. Much of Pepper blended with Garlic and 8 large sized Prawn. It tasted very good.
.
With this we came to end of our dinner. Red Panda has come up newly and is doing really good. Each of their dish that we tasted was fine. And most strikingly their prices are very very attractive. Meal for 2 at Rs.400 appx is damn cheap. And they don't charge any Tax.
.
Recommend !!

Ordered chicken momo, mixed Hakka noodles and chicken garlic. All tasted good. Mixed noodles was stuffed with shredded chicken and prawns. Garlic chicken was extremely tender. Momo was juicy. The broth which came in with the momo also tasted good. Food came in on time. Thanks Red Panda. Much appreciated. Keep going

It's a great restaurant Period. My 5 yr old kid loves the chicken noodles ( very less oily and spicey). I always ordered for less oil and spice and they made it to perfection. I have had multiple stuffs from Redpanda, I particularly want to call out Momos, Chicken Chowmin, Lamb preparation , Chickenteriyaki, Chicken lollypop for the awesomeness. I might be missing a lot more names. I am waiting for their sit in to be opened so that I can dine our there with my family. Last but not least these guys are very friendly and cooperative. CArry on Red Panda- Thanks for the service.

Eat here when i feel like eating out and if i have people to share the food with. Expensive for just one person but really good for two or more. I had vegetable Malaysian noodles and veg momos today. Did not like the momos but the noodles was great. I wish they gave more. They take time to serve. Have had chicken lollipops, chicken momos, chicken malaysian noodles here and all of it is really good. You get cool drinks as well.

Say Momo and 1st name that pops in my mind is Red Panda. The momos are simply yummy, juicy, filled with Chicken and lip-smacking delicious!!! The chow mein, and every other preparation is well and truly awesome! The best part about this outlet is its super pocket-friendly rates. Cheap rates and super quality food. Keep up the good work. Thumbs up from my side.

As a fan of Asian cuisine, I've heard of Red Panda from a friend & been there to try Chicken Fried Wontons. It was really delicious & in addition would like to mention their curteous service. I'll certainly visit them again to try other dishes & would recommend this place to all Asian food lovers in the town.

We visited the place during puja. We were  looking for a place for having dinner. 
Location : great location, close to Hiland Park, on E M Bypass. EASY TO PARK CAR. 
Ambience and decor : mainly takeaway, they  just started 
Staffs:well mannered, polite and helped us in placing order. 
FOOD : EXCELLENT in  taste and POCKET FRIENDLY . Chicken momo was simply one of the best momo I've ever tasted. 
Mixed fried rice and mixed chow mien were wonderful, light, not very spicy and chicken, prawn were added generously. Hot garlic chicken was great  too. 
I ordered again for  home delivery . Packing  and  punctuality are worth mentioning. 
It's a new  place which we will visit again. I'll give my feedback after trying Sizzler and  squid. They  have recently started these items also.
