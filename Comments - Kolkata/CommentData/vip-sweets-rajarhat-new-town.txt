Provides a lot of variety of fresh sweets to choose from. Baked Rasogolla, Paturi Sandesh, Butterscoth Sandesh, Nolen Gurer Cadbury Sandesh all are equally good in taste. They also provide good packaging if you're planning to take them to a long distance. Cards accepted.

The Shop is at prime location. I am not aware of most of the names of sweets, but I actually loved everything here ☺️
With respect to the money spend, I was totally satisfied with the stuff here. 

You must visit here.

In and around Rajarhaat, this I believe is the only reputed Sweet shop present. Adjacent to Arsalan near CC2.

Tried few of their chocolate sweet options, it was okay. The baked khir kodom was too good.

Sweets are my favourite and a dessert is must after a  meal. You will love their variety of sweets. Do try the sandesh, the baked chomchom, the malai chomchom and many more. After a yummy biryani at adjacent Arsalan , a visit to the VIP sweets is a must

Well, after a superb experience at their Ultadanga outlet, my wandering heart took me to their Rajarhat outlet, nearby the Chinar Park – for another divine experience!

However, this place fell below my expectations – specially, the standards being set so high by their Ultadanga counterparts! After a short tour of their goodies on offer, I placed an order for a takeaway of gurer rosogolla – priced at just Rs. 12 per piece.

I was grossly disappointed at the poor packing as the rosogolla chashni started leaking and created quite a mess inside my bag. Nevertheless, taste was the same signature one – a distinct taste of nolen gur and a distinct gur composure!

Don’t expect a great ambience, expect just decent stuff at decent rates!

This sweet outlet is located near Chinar Park at Rajarhat, New Town.

It's quite spacious and clean with a wide array of sweets & snacks.

Service is swift.

Tried Kachagolla, rosomalai & pineapple sondesh. All were fresh and absolutely delicious.

Pocket pinch is also reasonable.

A good place for sweetlovers.

There happened to be a grand party to be thrown at Rajarhat by my Uncle and hence wished to buy 10 dozen sweets at the nearby place. Although Haldiram's was in back of my mind, I decided to try this out.
The interior of this place is quite huge and is located just off the New Town Road very near Chinar Park, directly opposite to Spencer's.
Upon entering, we were acknowledged well and we decided to try out few sweets (for which we paid) and ultimately chalked upon "Rasogolla" as that is the only sweet seemed well enough. When they learned that we are in need of bulk sweets, they bought some time from us and then started packing sweets in "Mud Bhaand".
We orally counted the number of sweets as they started putting in the Bhaand and while it was been done, I tried one sweet from the lot (to confirm that the one we tasted prior from the showcased one is the same they are packing). After doing the needful we made the calculations and paid for all the sweets, included the ones tasted but one piece got slipped from it (the one I tasted from Bhaand). Almost instantly, both of us realized the mistake I made and I apologized but they made such a lewd gesture as if I meant to cheat them.
Apart from that, I later realized that, the container they store sweets on are not of the hygienic condition. However, since all the payments were made, I decided not to cancel the order.

End Note: I was somewhat dissatisfied despite the fact that the sweet tasted good.

জিভে প্রেম করে যেই জন.........।।

শাস্ত্রে বলেছে আত্মাই ব্রহ্ম। তাই নিজেকে জানা মানে ভগবানকে পাওয়া । নিজেকে চেনা মানে নিজের মধ্যে সেই স্ব-স্বরুপ উপলব্ধি করা। এই আমাদের হিন্দু শাস্ত্রের মূল কথা। নিজেকে জানা মানে কি? আমাদের বিশ্বকবির ‘চিত্তমাঝে’ কি চলতো কে জানে? তিনি তো কবেই লিখে গেছেন “আপনাকে এই জানা আমার ফুরাবে না”।

আমরা পুজ কেন করি? কাউকেএকটা তুষ্ট করার জন্ন্য। কিন্তু যাকে কোনদিন দেখিনি, তাকে পুজ করার থেকে ভাল, যে ভগবান  সামনে রয়েছেন, তার পুজা করা। শাস্ত্রে আরও বলছে আমরা নিজেরাই ভগবান। আমাদেরপুজা মানে ভগবানকে পাওয়া।  আবার এও বলছে তস্মিন তুষ্টে জগত তুস্টম। মানে আমরা যদি নিজেকে খুশি করতে পারি। তাহলেই কেল্লাফতে। এ জগতে খুব বেশি মানুষই আছেন, যারা সব সময় অন্যের চোখে ভাল হতে চান, তাদের তুষ্টির জন্ন্য নিজের প্রান বলিদান দিতে চান।

সে দলে আমি পড়ি না। আমার দল নির্দল। আমি কেবল খেয়ে বেড়াই। তার জন্য নিন্দুকরা আমায় পেটুক বলে, পরোয়া করি না। পছন্দমত খাবার দেখলে আমি নিজেকে থিক রাখতে পারি না। রাস্তায়- ঘাটে লোকাল ট্রেনে যখন যাই- তখন আশেপাশে কোনও সু-গন্ধ্য পেলে মনে হয় নেমে পড়ি- কাজ , অফিস যাওয়া চুলোয় যাক;

আগে মিষ্টির সাথে আমার খুব একটা প্রেম ছিল না। কিন্তু ইদানিং দেখছি প্রেম টা বেড়েই চলেছে। সে সরপুরিয়া –ই হোক, বা জিবেগজা, কিমবা কোনও দোকানের রসমালাই। 

এখানে এলে আমি হলফ করে বলতে পারি। পাঁচশ রসমালাই খাওয়া কোনও ব্যাপারই নয়। জীবনে বসন্ত সব সময়ই ঘুরে ফেরে, কিন্তু দরকার তাকে খালি আসন দেওয়া। এখানে বসার কোনও আয়োজন নেই। তাও সই। কিন্তু এই দোকানে এসে যদি রসমালাই মিস করেন, তাহলে সেটা হবে ভারতে এসে তাজমহল মিস করা। মিষ্টির এই অনুপম ভূস্বর্গে খালি রসমালাই নেই। আছে প্রচুর মিষ্টি। কিন্তু মন কাড়বে এই বস্তুটি। 

ক্ষীর ভরা দূরনিলিমায় রসগোল্লার এমন নিশ্চিন্ত সাঁতার –আর কোথায় পাওয়া যাবে? উপরি পাওনা কেশর পেস্তার এতিউতি বিচরণ। সত্যি খাবারের এতো বাহার- এ শুধু বঙ্গদেশেই সম্ভব। আর যদি বাড়িতে বসে বেশ মৌজ করে খেতে চান, তাহলে ফ্রিজে রেখে দু –তিন ঘণ্টা পরে খান- দেখবেন স্বাদ অমলিন।

They had baked mihidana, priced at 70 per pack this one is worth trying. You can also try their mongo mishti which though not overtly sweet is temptingly delicious.

They are pretty old at this location as they have a shop already near Lokenath Temple which is yet to get listed in zomato. This is a newly opened outlet by them to enhance the things in a better way with lots of other varieties to be added on. Big in size shape and quantity of sweets. Located beside Arsalan, Chinar park, went there to buy sweets and got nearly confused what to buy. Still chosen two of the sweets and took them home. Quality of the sweet and taste was commendable but still they lacks the Extraordinary Feature. I believe in the coming days it will be there too...

Strategically located adjacent to the Arsalan restaurant near City Centre 2 in Rajarhat, VIP Sweets is a huge outlet. I am not very fond of sweets but I found the offering virtually irresistible - there was a "taalshash" sondesh fit for a giant's offering, so huge that it costs Rs. 80 a piece. One of that will do for your lunch. Their Aam Doi, Pineapple Sondesh, Nolen Gurer Sondesh etc. are worth a special mention. Avoid the Shorbhaja please. Otherwise a 5 star place.

Sweets have a very important role in spreading happiness and bringing smiles on each ones face, so to justify that i had been looking out for a nice sweet shop in Rajarhat  as i was in a crave for sweets after a nice meal .So after a quest  i headed to this sweet shop in Chinar park called the VIP SWEETS and as the name sounds very nice i expected the sweets to be nice enough. So i entered and found the shop with a lot of varieties from ROSSOGULAS,KHER KADAM TO MISTI DOI and everything possible is available here . The shop is kept clean and the sweets are kept in proper environment allowing the sweets to stay fresh and tasty . The guys behind the shop work very fast and are very good at their job which is certainly a good thing as, if you are new and dont know any thing about sweets then suggestions and what to eat based on your liking is done by the guys here . Coming to what i ate here was a basically 2 GULAB JAMUN'S which i was wanting to try as i needed something sweet after a heavy meal so a warm and nice sweet would be good but my luck was bad that the sweets were could not be heated i dont know what was the reason and i did not ask much , so that surely was  a dissapointment for me as such a big brand in the name of sweets doesnt heat the GULAB JAMUNS was a strange thing, however i had it and the taste was very yummy and filled with liquid syrup ,made very well,just the way you get sweets in marriage or parties it was exactly the same feeling and i had been so satisfied after having it that i m surely going to visit this sweet shop for other sweets once again soon and add some photos too as i was so hungry that i forgot to click the picture before eating and walked out being happy :) .

Recently they have came up with their new outlet at Rajarhat. It's located at chinar park just in between the Aminia and Arsalan chinar park branch. Opposite Spencer's. Very easy to locate.

I am not a sweet lover but whenever I need or want to have I prefer them. Always a fresh quality and taste is also very good. 

Staffs are very well behaved and ready to help. They always give you the correct information and guide you to experience the best. Good vibes :)
Keep up the good
