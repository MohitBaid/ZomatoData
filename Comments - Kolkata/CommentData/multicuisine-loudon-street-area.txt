Conferences go on during the day and so table reservation is recommended. Delicious food and amazing variety of different cuisines. I specifically loved Jeera Rice, Dal Makhani and White Sauce Spaghetti pasta.

Food is delicious; only problem is conferences may go on during the day time and sometimes at night because of which the staff takes you to another hotel Restaurant : Gharana which is just as good in terms of food quality and staff service.

Contrary to the present lower ratings, i would like to give them a 4 star as i found their dishes to be freshly made coupled with the staff courtesy which was commendable. Special mention requires for their mocktail and their deserts. I was carrying a buffet voucher and they were not serving buffet on that day / time, still they arranged to serve each and every item (including 3 different salads) on unlimited ala carte basis. Ambience is absolutely normal and nothing great about it. Value for money is 10 on 10.

Hey folk, never ever waste your money in this shitty restaurant. I had gone for buffet lunch with my friends and was expecting proper ambience, good food and adequate hospitality. But sadly, all of these were horrible. They denied from serving buffet giving lame excuses instead they provided a regular lunch. Even the items served were shitty. The experience was totally disgusting. Why they are running this shitty place, I am still wondering. I wish I could give it a negative rating. Rating 1 is too much for a miserable place like this.

I have to write this review else it will be injustice with the restaurant. Peaple have given very poor reviews about it.here I must mention that we go for a restaurant to eat not to see primarily.the hospitality I have received there now way less than any other place. The food was delicious specially the egg and chicken salad, mustered fish and gulabjamun. It supposed to be a buffet but for some technical defoult they serve everything on the table. They will even ask you that what would you like to have among the buffet menu and serve accordingly. The food was unlimited, worm , and yaam unlike other reviews .Even we have received complimentary drinks which were from the house. One thing I must say that they need to clean up this place and make it little fancy. Apart from this small thing if I ask my tongue then they rply is nice.overall it was a sumptuous Sunday lunch and enjoyed totally.@camelia kumar

This place is one of the average buffet restaurants in Kolkata. I have been there about a year ago and all I can say that the food was definitely not good. Ambience is nice, service needs to be improved. 
About the food, cooking is pathetic. And the buffet items do not have much variety. Not recommended at all.

I had purchased a breakfast buffet of this restaurant from a popular app. I had a hard time finding this place as Google maps gave me a hard time to locate this one. Anyway I reached this place famished and expected to eat a good breakfast. 
Starting from fruits but to my dismay there was only Papaya in the fruits section. 
I am really fond of muffins but the muffin they had was the cheap plain ones which you get in any nearby shop. 
The only thing good about the buffet was the bread and the option of butter and mixed fruit jam.( But wait anyone can give you that right!) 
The Puri sabji had gone cold and no freshly made Puri was added. 
The baked beans was the tinned ones that you get at stores. 
The South Indian platter had idli and sambar which was kinda okay nothing good about it. 
There were no cakes or baked bread or anything sweet except that plain nukkad ki dukan wala muffin! 
I ordered scrambled eggs and a spicy omelette but the eggs were horribly done. The omelette was undercooked and raw at places! The scrambled eggs was without salt. I can make better scrambled eggs and omelette. 
There were no fresh juices or anything which you expect in a breakfast buffet at such a huge establishment. 
Then came the worst part of the breakfast their tea. It was so bad that I could take another sip. I am just too fond of tea and I always need to have tea at different times of the day but their tea was the worst I've ever had. 

The tables were extremely dirty, there was left over food in most of the tables.
The staff were nonchalant to our requests and we had to call out many times to order. 
It was a bad experience overall.

I wish I could have an option of rating in negative. However, First of all I would say they don't know how to serve, I had been there for having Buffet Lunch but they wouldn't provide me that, instead of that offered me soup, 2 pc roti, chicken, salad and gulab jamun. And all these items were served at the same time. So, it's not a technique to serve. Apart form that staffs were co-operative, decent and very helpful and ambience was very good but food quality was not up to the mark which is very important. I'd like to request to the administration to improve your service and give proper training to your staffs first. I will not have there again and will not recommend anyone to be there.

Bought Sunday breakfast coupon from Nearbuy and went there today.many items were missing from d menu like juice, sprouts, amla morbba,chawanprash, egg sunny sideups, sandwiches etc.and only one type of North Indian breakfast was provided (puri Sabji).the 2‚Ä¢5 rating is solely based on their hospitality and south Indian dishes (vada and idli).in fact they promised to serve 2 types of cakes bt we only found muffins (they were dry and unappetizing).

Take my advice, never ever book buffet from Groupon/Nearby during Puja. Today I am having the worst experience on my life. Bad management, and the service really sucks. They arrange buffet but all on a sudden they ran out of food. What ever you ask for, they will tell you it's coming in a minute, I waited 20 minutes to get Vetki Paturi, for Loochi I had to wait for 15 minutes, and the worst part, had to wait 30 minutes for Kaci Phatar Jhol and it taste utterly bad, not properly boiled.Don't even think about buying their coupon even in your dreams, I promise it will became your nightmare.

Multicuisine- The restaurant of the Hotel Big boss came across my food journey when a friend invited me over here for his birthday party. We opted for the buffet and if you see the spread starting with soups and salads followed by some decent mains including grilled fish and chicken you will find them very decent at a cost it is offered.
But unfortunately they do not live up to the expectation as the food was not that well prepared specially the taste of some of items were very blunt and very ordinary. Though the fish and the Cesar ¬†salad was good. Apart from it the dessert section disappointing serving cold gulab jamuns as a part of it.Also to mention the service is very slow and are not able to handle big crowd at the same time. Even it had potential to be a good buffet offering wasted it completely with a lot of flaws. I would request the management to take care of it and work on the loopholes.

Well, we are all aware of the famous line:- ‚ÄúBig Boss chahte hain ke aap confession room mein aa jayein‚Äù ‚Äì from the stupid daily soap ‚ÄúBig Boss‚Äù. But, now we are also aware of the famous Big Boss 3-star property situated near Lamartinere school @ Beckbagan, which definitely serves decent food.

Multi-cuisine is one of the restaurants of the Big Boss hotel. My 2nd visit to this place ‚Äì 1st one was a buffet lunch a couple of years back followed by a buffet breakfast today. From outside, it does not seem like a 3-star property, but from inside it looks atleast 2 stars (not 3 though). Multi-cuisine, their restaurant is based out of the 2nd floor of this property. Ambience is pretty decent and temperature soothing. Restaurant can accommodate 30 odd heads! D√©cor is moderate and hygiene is great!

We had papayas and watermelon at inception followed by canned pineapple juice. Bananas were also available in the fruit section. Condiments such as sugar, jam and butter etc were neatly placed on our tables. Chocolate milk shake was there, which was also fine ‚Äì though, it should have been more chilled. This was followed by steamed idly + nariyal chutney + sambhar. This was an ideal South Indian sambhar ‚Äì so much of drumsticks, gourd and what not ‚Äì and as hot as the sun - just like the south indian people prepare - a superb sambhar in all! However, spice content was pretty high in it. Nariyal chutney was also fine and idly ‚Äì pretty soft. Corn flakes were available and some chocos also. We did not taste, but hot as well as cold milk was available.

This was followed by baked beans ‚Äì which was pretty mediocre ‚Äì toooooo ordinary on taste, although, it felt better when had with bread toast (both brown and white were there). Vermicelli pulao was there, which I just tasted a morsel and decided not to have any more. Luchi and cholar daal ‚Äì typical Bengali style ‚Äì was placed ‚Äì which was fine, the only drawback being that luchi was pure maida base ‚Äì as such, it became chewy within minutes of preparation. Daal was great, nice chilly content also. Hash brown potato (cutlet mind it!) was available, which was great ‚Äì simply out of the world. 

Coming to the show stopper ‚Äì their muffins, simply the best I have ever had in my life ‚Äì soft and fresh ‚Äì baked to perfection and I was not satisfied even after having 3 pieces of the same. Their slice cake also was godly! We ended with milk powder tea ‚Äì which was medium hot when served ‚Äì disappointing!

Nice to see that the number of non-veg items was quite few ‚Äì a positive for we vegetarians. Also, the number of veg items were limited but decent.

Service is fine and prices are reasonable as well. They might spend some money on renovation ‚Äì as this property lacks maintenance. Even the AC was leaking, the elevator too old and slow ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

Nevertheless, I was quite satisfied with my breakfast and I wish this place the very best of luck.

Very very very poor quality of food !
I purchased nearby voucher f buffet lunch. 
Was highly disappointed.  First and foremost no name tags on the food items. I had to guess the food by seeing. When I pointed out that there should be name tags then quickly he started putting all tags. There was no starters. Main course wasn't good. Chicken dish was so below average. Paneer was also below standard. Mocktails were also below standard ...just added blue lagoon to pineapple juice and sprite and gave.  Sweets ... or deserts ... very less variety.  Gulab jamuns were so hard and dry. Ice cream was in melted form.. it was as if I m hvng shake.  Darshaan wasn't cooked properly. Poor experience.  Would not visit again.

Went to this place for a dinner buffet on the occasion of a friend's birthday, in a group of around ten. Though the lobby looked elegant, the restaurant itself was ill-ventilated. The spread was decent, with salads, soups, rice, flat breads and a number of side dishes. But I stuck to the chicken Caesar salad, and the grilled fish. Both these were amazing. The salad was well-dressed and had loads of chicken pieces. The fish was well cooked and had a lovely sauce coating it. The desserts were disappointing, but the welcome crinkle looked good and tasted good too.

The Food & Hospitality Industry, bears a very competitive market, where each and every thing deserves perfection to sustain. And one just cannot afford to neglect any part of it, as people checking in a restaurant is sure to expect a complete 360 degree package of food, hospitality, presentation, comfort and all the other components, that sum up to create an experience, and an overall perception of the place.

And this is the thing where "Multicuisine" lags behind, specially in the hospitality part. In this competitive world, it really leaves everyone surprised to see that a restaurant inside a 3 star Hotel, can be so reluctant about their service and hospitality. Unskilled service person, having no clue of how to treat the guests, a clueless manager having least concern about the guests walking in to make them feel comfortable, the restaurant's washroom doors kept open, eventually leading to the whiffy stink all over the dining area, is sure to disgust anyone with its very first appearance. Adding upto it, when the service team is repeatedly insisted on lowering the temperature of AC to increase the cooling effect, and they don't even bother to listen to it, then it clearly reflects an utter unprofessionalism which have no place in a hospitality industry.
And importantly, in a 3 star property, a guest walking in is sure to expect the basic minimum courtsey of a minimal greeting, serving water on the table etc. Unfortunately, they are lagging in those basic etiquette too.

So "Multicuisine" can easily be claimed as a live example of 'disaster due to poor hospitality' even after service genuinely good food.
The tangy lemon soup, the veggies, the paneer preparation, and the salads are really good. Specially, the 'fish in lemon sauce' is really amazing, to be honest. But even then makeover is needed in the "Cream of chicken soup", as it lacked the zing, and the main course chicken dish is literally hard to chew and fibrous. And coming to desserts, even a local ordinary sweet shop can prepare it better, honestly.
The moctails looked stunning, and tasted good too.

And to summarize as a whole, serious makeover is needed, specially in service. Afterall, encouraging worthlessness in hospitality segment is like injecting poison to a business, in this competitive market scenario.

The occasion was a friend's birthday and we were invited over for a sumptuous buffet. To start with the hall meant for the buffet was a bit stuffy and the staff was completely cluless about was items were on offer. After much research they informed us about the names. Among the soups there were lemon coriander veg soup and cr√®me of chicken soup. I liked the tanginess of the veg soup but the cr√®me of chivken lacked the zing.
The salads that were plated were veg pasta salad, chicken hawaian salad and egg salad. The chicken hawaiian salad was quite appetising.
The absolute star of the buffet was the fish in lemon sauce, a clear winner. A perfect dish with fresh pieces of fish.
The other items were mudane and desserts were a disaster !!
They need to work on their dessert department for sure.
All in all an average spread where fish in lemon sauce was the saving grace.
