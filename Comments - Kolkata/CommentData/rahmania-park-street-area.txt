Honestly speaking it's the biriyani which matters the most here no it has no ac or great decor but I guarantee a satisfying burp will let you forget all these things.

Well, ordered online for Mutton Biryani and Chicken Reshmi Kabab.Both the dishes were good but expected a bit more owing to the reputation of Rahmania. The Mutton in the Biryani was good and well cooked however the rice felt a bit low.The price is decent as well. Will be looking forward to other dishes from here in the future.

Heard so much about the place and so decided to drop in. As it was way past lunch time so decided not to order biriyani and instead ordered mutton chap and rumali roti. The place is not very well decorated, just simple furnitures (I was in the non AC section though). The food was served within about 5mins. This is the worst mutton chap I have ever had. There was no taste at all. The mutton chunks were just swimming in a plate full of oil. I could hardly see any mutton, it had only bones. A very very dissapointing experience. Maybe I would have biriyani next time and change the rating.

This is a legendary Biryani joint of the city. The name Rahmania is unknown to absolutely no one in Kolkata. The ambience and service are not something worth a mention.
                  I've tried out Mutton Biryani, Mutton Chaap, Chicken Kassa, Lachcha Paratha and Firni from here. I was very impressed by the food and instantly understood why 'Rahmania' is such a big name in the field of North Indian cuisine. The Biryani deserves a special mention and so does the chaap.

FINAL VERDICT- I highly recommend this place if you are a Biryani lover like I am.

It's located in park Street near Jameson inn. First of all, it is not an AC restaurant, which is very disappointing. Also the dinning and staffs are very casual. Coming to food, it's mainly north Indian n briyani restaurant.The Briyani was really very good in a very affordable price. If u r a briyani fan and AC n dinning is not a factor for u, then go for it. This is the restaurant u r searching for.

Rahmania is located right at the Mallick bazar crossing just opposite to Shiraz. Both of them are formidable names in the biryani scenario of Kolkata. Mutton biryani, mutton pasinda, mutton rezala and firni were the things we went for and the food was delicious. But what it lacked was the ambience. The  place and the staff need to imlrove, or else it will soon lose by long strides against its rival across the road.

This is one of the older restaurants in the city serving Mughlai food. The two big names of Park Street have always been Shiraz and Rahmania. And though the former has grown exponentially,  Rahmania seems to have reached a plateau phase in their growth. Rahmania is good by their own standards... The Biryanis and the Mutton and Chicken Chaap they serve, is no less than that dished out by the giant on the other side of the street. The Mutton Pasinda is one dish where they can certainly do a better job. Firnis are reasonably good too. They can certainly work to improve upon the ambience factor. Service is standard. It seems they lack the ambition for that final push,  to be considered in the big league of today. To be in the race, they need to try out something new, like innovate on the menu, improve the ambience, reach out to the people. Cause definitely the 'Biryani Race' in Kolkata is hotting up......

Rahmania and Shiraz has had roaring businesses in the Mallick Bazar area forever and both are institutions​... And every man woman and child has their own favorite among these two.... While mine is Shiraz I can't deny the awesomeness of Rahmania.... The impeccable biryani and the lovely dishes.... That they have served for decades are undeniably great and time tested.... While one should not compare legends... We however always end up doing just that!!! I can safely say if Shiraz is the Bette Davis of mughlai food Rahmania is Joan Crawford .. beautiful, relevant and genius!!!

One of the oldest mughal food joint of kolkata. Been here many times.Service & ambience is quite well. They believe in quality. Ordered through zomato. Food quality & quantity are good enough. The most important part is its very much pocket friendly. The common concept " the more you pay, the better you get" does not fit here. A must visit for indian-mughal food lovers.

This place is probably one of the first to open every morning for Breakfast.. They start serving their customers as early as 5.30am. You get the usual suspects, like Paaya, Mutton Stew etc.. I tried both the Paaya as well as the Mutton Stew.. The Paaya for me felt too watery and lacked flavour, but the Mutton Stew was quite good. I have heard they make a very good Malai Roti, but you need to be lucky to get your hands on one, since it is not always available. During the day, Kolkata has so many options to offer, and I would probably not pick this place, but if you are craving a heavy Breakfast first thing in the morning, you can head to Rehmania.

This place I visit every now and then , I havent had a biriyani's mutton so soft and perfectly cooked. I know the ambience might not be that great but surely you wont feel bad here , its quite comfortable . The staff is so humble and polite , I always end up giving a lot of tips . Also I remember one of staffs who serve inside the a/c  area once changed the piece of mutton because it was rubbery. You must try them once ! and I just hope their prices and hospitality keep up like this.

Well as you can make out from the other reviews here, they serve some very good Biriyani - especially the Mutton Biriyani. But the Chicken chaap is one of the best and highly recommend. For a dish which has become a commodity over the years and is now served in every alternate eatery in this city, it is nice to taste chaap which actually the way it is supposed to be - Soft and succulent chicken, Thick and spicy Gravy and just the right amount of oil floating over the bowl !!!

A nostalgic outlet per-se, for people who have come here in their childhood. I still remember the day, when my friend forced to come here and have lunch after a seminar at one of the nearby colleges. My father gave me 100 Rs. to have the Biryani as being a school kid, I obviously lacked resources. It was somewhere around 1999-2000, when I was in standard VII-VIII. We made our way inside and ordered for a Mutton Biryani each. Huge quantity of rice, with soft grains. The mutton was a nice beauty of wonder and the potato was beyond any description. I have made several visits later when I could, but this was one extravaganza, which will forever be etched in my heart.

Today me and my office colleagues went to this place,which is my first sit and dine experience here.This eatery is quite old but had a facelift few years back. It's located right at the Mullick bazar and Parkstreet crossing.There are both AC and non AC segments.Sitting in the comfort of AC , we ordered Chicken biryani, Salad and Firni for our lunch.
Firstly the biryani struck the right balance between oil and masala.The mild aroma from the Biryani fuelled our appetite. However, the chicken piece was small. Salad was freshly cut and served. Firni was good.The colour was like misti doi and tastes quite delicious !

Kolkata has a definite trail of brilliant Mughlai Food institutions that have managed to put the city on the top of the Mughlai Food scene in the country. One of these institutions is Rahmania. The place is known to serve some of the best mutton delicacies. You must try their biriyani and the chaap here. It is delectable. Every holi in our family at one time, had called for Biriyani from Rahamania and box after box of kebabs. They are soft and succulent and tick all the right boxes. If you have not tried their nihari yet...then you must.

Kolkata is nothing short of an institution,,, moving beyond the idea of a sanctuary or paradise,,, for the early riser.... Rahmania,,, opens at 5:30 am,,, nd believe it or not,, the place is packed with people who love walking,, their talk nd breaking bread thereafter.... Only here they choose to do it with all kinds of mutton dishes as an accompaniment to the above,,, making it undoubtedly the best breakfast in Kolkata.......
Mutton stew, mutton dal, nihari, zuban, kassa nd keema,,, among a host of other options..... There is the usual option of tandoori fare,,, if your system nd appetite can go for such a heavy meal in the morning nd fresh malai to cream off the remains on your plate later........

Thought of trying my favourite "Double Aloo Khuska" @ Rahmania today at lunch (fuelling my Sunday Bohemianism !!!), after a long long time...

With time their taste has also changed - Rice has become less aromatic...Aloos (potatoes) are half boiled ... juiciness is at ground zero... 

Only winner is their simplicity of the overall presentation & a surreal nostalgia surfacing from childhood memories which prompt you to ignore thousands faults while leaving the payment counter the person on other side bids adieu saying "Aur bhaijaan Saab Khairiaat !!!" 😢

Visited this place a couple of weeks back, its at the MullickBazar bus stop, on A.J.C. Bose Road. Its a very famous place and hence was looking forward to dining here, and it did not disappoint. I only had the normal mutton biryani and chicken tikka kebab. The quality of the food was really good, the kebab was good and the biryani was perfect, it wasn't oily at all like it usually is at several other joints. The price is o.k. as well in terms of the quality and quantity of food served, looking forward to visiting again.

Due to the omni presence of Shiraz and Arsalan The Rahmania lack its business but... i should recomend all to atleast taste the food here. The Biriyani is good. Not too dry not too oily... but as you wantbit to be. So go give it a try... you will not be a looser.

Been Here many times one thing i really like about rahmania is that the waiters are gentle and well mannered. Ordered Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tandoori And Chicken Kassa. It was all average the chicken pieces are really small which is a disappointment. Ambience Is so so but you can come here if you have no other option.

This place is a nostalgic one to me as it is related to my childhood. While growing up I have seen my family members going to this restaurant to pick up the mutton chaap specially. 

A few months back I was in Park street area and decided to go there, it has been ages, but the ambiance of this place remains the same. Ordered biryani and mutton chaap. Simply one word heavenly ..and brought back the childhood days for me.  If you have not been there, this is a must visit place for the biryani lovers.

I am new to Kolkata and I am a big Foodie. I like exploring restaurants. I went to Rahmania with the help of zomato and found that to be the one the oldest biryani restaurant. I was expecting really a lot from this place. I ordered Chicken chap and chicken biryani. Biryani was upto the mark. The chicken piece was soft and there was moisture in it. But the chap was not at all good. It was overpriced and it spoiled my  expectations. It was highly salted. Still I am looking forward to visit this place again and try something new. It is a pocket friendly restaurant  and it's worth a try but think twice before ordering Chicken chap.

The word of mouth finally forced me to dine in this place.
Situated near park Street area on the way to park circus.....very decent ambience, good food and proactive service personnel should define "rahmania".....
Ordered for mutton kasha, haleem, biryani and some breads.
Excellent food with good pocket friendly pricing.
BUT....haleem was a disappointed
Biryani at India restaurant (kidderpore) was better and their haleem too.
It's a good place to hangout with friends......

I have had only biriyani from Rahmania till yesterday, when I decided it's time for some haleem. You don't get it all year, it's only during the Ramzan month that they are prepared and till now I've always missed having them somehow. The biriyani here is nice, bit on the drier side but on both the occasions I found the meat to be somewhat chewy. 
Last evening, a friend and I landed here on our way to French class and ordered a bowl of haleem, and a paratha each. The service was extremely fast and we were served in 2 minutes. The food, however, disappointed us. I don't know if it's because our expectations from haleem were sky-high, as I've seen many people go gaga over this dish, or it was genuinely just bad. The meat was soft, but the dal was bland. I expected it to be spicier. The paratha was a lot better, soft and flavoursome. 
The ambiance was very casual, to my liking. The bill came to Rs. 206 with taxes. Overall, it was a mediocre experience at a cheap price.

In his heyday Mithun Chakraverty was called poor man's Amitabh Bachhan.Well,Rahmania likewise have been called the poor man's Shiraz.

Till a couple of years back,they were located back to back,serving almost the same food,with the same ambience.

Item to item,I personally liked Shiraz better but there have been occasions when due to a parking issue I ate at Rahmania and always came out a happy man with a content stomach.

A kickass biryani and hot tawa cooked chaap more or less sums up the vocabulary and maybe in their rivalry benefits the people of Kolkata.Today the chaap I packed was heavenly.Who knows how Shiraz will match up in a friends Iftaar party tomorrow.

The first mughlai restaurant i went as a kid. The quality was superb then as the number of mughlai cuisine places in kolkata was very less
 This time i went to rahamania i was a little dissapointed as the quality has fallen tremendously and though the biriyani was pocket friendly it couldnot make friendship with my taste buds. The kebabs were hard and the gravy items had excess oil. So a little dissapointed.

One of the oldest joints in the Park Street area, Rahmania is still one of the favourites among people liking mughlaai food. I have been to this place 3/4 times and really enjoyed the food.

Mutton Biryani is good, flavourful and spicy. Apart from that mutton qalia, chicken chaap, mutton special kassa, mutton special keema all are very good. Items from tandoor are not that great but quite good. The butter masalas are also not great but good.

Rahmanias biryani is a favourite among many Kolkatans and also the pricing is cheap. The decor is old and ambience is as usual hustly-bustly. The quality of food has downgraded a bit in the years, but still it is very good. 

Lastly - recommended to all friends for a very good biryani for a cheap price.

Another restaurant known for its Biriyani expertise. This place is one if the most preferred restaurant when it comes to biriyani. The food here has a huge number of followers. The pricing is just. Thus is one place that should be visited surely. The experience will add to your knowledge of biriyani. Calcutta biriyani has its own flavor and this place gives its own touch. This place has lots of branches around the city. Be sure to treat yourself at this brand of good food. Rahmania competes with top restaurants of its kind in the city and does a good job. Enjoy yourself here.

At reasonable price, Rahmania is the go to place for Biryani in the Park Street locale. It is famous for its Mutton Biryani which is neither  too rich nor too bland but still maintains the correct mix of flavours. Seating is strictly OK, with provisions for AC dining too. I would certainly go again.

Located near Park Street cemetery area is Rahmania. Well know for its biriyani, I have visited this restaurant many time over the past years. As a biriyani lover, I would rate it very highly. A restaurant which wont be topping when it comes to ambiance and décor but certainly will make it up with the biriyani served. The prices are normal rates compared to the restaurant in the same league. But rahmania has downgraded a bit over the years. But still on its day serves among the top 5 biriyani served restaurants in kolkata.

Rahmania has been my favourite ever since school days. Just 5 minutes from my school and u reach rahmania. Once upon a time when I loved biryanis. Mutton biryanis out here blew me off. Non sticky, less oil and superb biryanis at such unbelievably cheap price and the chicken chaap to team it up along with it. And u have the best ever meal. But ever since my no- biryani phase has started I visited here 3 days back. And the old restro has been renovated. It looks like a piece of muslim architecture with the beautifully etched persian works on the wall and the lamps. But the ambience can be worked upon. Coming to the food. We ordered mutton rezala and lachchha paratha. My dead favourite it was yummilicious. The tasted of the curd n the mutton blending into my mouth made me ecstatic.  However, the best was of course the mutton pasinda. Its basically minced mutton done in the chaap style wid added spices. I dont know how they prepared it. It was awetastic. Highly recommended.  The raita was good. However the firni was a huge turn off. I hated it. But I can go back for the mutton pasinda n mutton rezala innumerable times.

Me and my best friend went to shopping and when we finally finished it off we realised that we were very hungry. And we landed in this restaurant. It has both non-air conditioned and air-conditioned seating facilities. We opted for air conditioned seats. We ordered lachha paratha, mutton pasinda, mutton rezala and firni. All the dishes were very tasty and yummy. But i would like to mention that mutton pasinda was really good. The meat was soft and properly cooked and smelled awesome. Mutton rezala was a very light preparation. The curry which they provided with it tasted heavenly. But i would say that firni was not that good compared to the other dishes. It tasted average to me. Service is good and it is pocket friendly. One visit is must.

Well if you simply want to get your taste buds blown out and scream for more food, this is the place to be. Simply, the best biriyani of the city ahead of Arsalan, and a decent enough sitting accomodation with both AC and non AC. This place is right in the opposite foot of Gorosthan and simply the best Mughlai cuisine one can get his hands on. Starting from morning breakfast, soft rotis and mutton kasha right to the biriyani, every food is as tasty as it can get. Definitely a place highly recommended for foodies.

Located very close to the Park Circus Seven-Point crossing, this place was easily accessible from my school in Ballygunj. I had been to this Rahmania outlet on a number of occasions whenever we friends, individually, had saved a considerable amount out of our daily allotted pocket money. “Each man with its own” used to be our friendly caution when anyone struck upon such an idea. The love for Rahmania actually grew when we savoured a Chicken Roll from their branch near Ballugunj Railway Station. They prepare the kebabs in such a fashion that no sooner had you taken a bite than the same would become miscible within a matter of some fractions of a second with your saliva. Since the latter had no arrangements for seating, we kept on searching for another branch in the proximity of the school till we found the former. The Biryanis here are light. It’s probably the only restaurant across Calcutta which can afford to mix a small pinch of saffron to their biryani dishes. The place is quite satisfying and equally enjoyable with your buddies around.

Last week I did something truly awesome - drove early in the morning to catch the breakfast at Rahmania's and boy, was I blown! I ordered plain roti (soft, fluffy, piping hot, melts in the mouth), some mutton stew, mutton curry, firni, and sweet milky tea. I can't express the pure bliss of it all in words. The mutton stew is a must try (available only early in the morning). Team it with fluffy fresh rotis - ahh heavenly. I am not a breakfast person, but I am glad I tried this. Yes, the food was a tad heavy, but it had no bad aftermath on the body, as the metabolic rate is at the highest in the morning. I felt fresh, nourished, happy and strangely fulfilled as I drove back to make a regular start of the day.

Another Biriyani place is this. Located just opposite of Shiraj in mullick bajar more, this place is well known for kababs and biriyani. 

On friends advice, went there for Mutton pasinda, which seems a very good option as well.  
Had all these 3 items along with Some sweet desert, and the bill was pretty pocket friendly.

Few days ago read in the news paper that all Afghanis flock to this restaurant from 5.30 am. And they serve breakfast.Went there today 20th March .Reached there by 6 am. The place was on but no customers.Good for me.. Ordered rotis and dal ghost. The rotis were freshly baked. The dal ghost being Rs 70 only had  a lot........two big chunks of mutton and good portion of chana dal. Again reminded me of my Gulf days.Those Pakistani restaurants......small but serving tasty  fresh food.
Typical bongs will sheer by the concept of mutton in the morning and will start calorie counting but this is not for those type of people.Tasty fresh wholesome breakfast for the working class.Loved it.  Finished with two  c ups of sweet gooey milky tea quite relaxing. Made my day..Will come back soon. When  I was coming out the restaurant  it seemed I was in Kabul .Kolkata is so colourful.

On Sunday most places were closed and we were driving back from Salt Lake when the hunger pangs hit so we decided to do a take-away from Rahmania ! We ordered Mutton Biryani , Chicken Rezala , Mutton Shami Tikia and Tandoori Roti and asked for a parcel to be made. The Parcel was ready in five minutes and we headed home hungry as hell. The food had both hits and misses .... the Mutton Shami Tikia and the Tandoori Roti's were sure shot hits .... the Tikia was juicy , meaty and succulent ...  a perfect blend of spices and we really enjoyed it , the Roti's retained their softness and were perfectly paired with the Tikia .... combined with onion salad and some lemon it was delightful. The Chicken Rezala was decent not bad but nothing to shout from the roof tops about either ! The letdown was the biryani .... mutton pieces were hard and fibrous not properly cooked and the rice was just average in flavor and taste. I would certainly recommend the Tikia and Roti but would advise one to avoid the biryani ... Arsalan's is way better and its just a few minutes away !!!

This was the place which we frequented during our college days .... the used to make a great biryani which was also pocket friendly because that was a huge criteria when we were in college : ) . However what we repeatedly kept going back for was the mutton shami or tikia and the tandoori roti which were really yummy and filling as well as the delicious and flavorful firni which was a hot favorite with all of us. Of late though I still venture back for the mutton shami and roti the quality of the shami has gone down and also become very oily ... but for those of you who like their tandoori roti's soft they make excellent roti's.

After a long time I visited Rahmania with my friends. We ordered ‘Mutton Biryani’ , ‘Chicken Chap’ and Green Salad. The chap had the usual spicy gravy but the chicken piece was a big let-down. The biryani was very ordinary, not too great or bad. While eating biryani I noticed a long hair in my mutton piece after given a small bite. When I reported the matter and they change the mutton but they do not throw away the bitten mutton piece. They carefully put it in the hundi, may be for next customer.  I personally felt that Waiters are inattentive and rude.  Please avoid this joint in rush hours.

Rahmania, for me is the king of Mughlai food in Kolkata. Today at the age of health and diet consciousness, I feel they serve the least spicy yet very tasty Biriyani. And their kebabs are just awesome good (specially the new ones they have added in their menu- Achaari and Kasturi)
We are regular at their Mullickbazar Outlet. Staff hospitality is very heart-warming (specially there’s a guy called Mateen, he’s just brilliant), Food doesn’t take too much time to be served at the table. 
Apart from the fact that the AC section is a little bit smaller than I would have liked it to be, this restaurant’s food seriously rocks!
Log live Mughlai…Long live Rahmania.

I like their Biriani - it's simple. The spices are well balance, there's no overpowering smell of "keora", and the meat is consistently soft and juicy. Along with the Biriani, I would highly recommend their mutton chaap, and their shammi-kebab.

Preordered 17 boxes of chicken biriyani on 16/9/13 for delivery on 17/9/13 for distribution to our Salt Lake factory workers on the occasion of Viswakarma Puja. Delivered by 12.30 as scheduled and distributed by 1.30 as the food was for lunch.
Got feedback later in the day and personally tasted a sample and the chicken was fully rotten.
Going to the outlet in BE Salt Lake after much stubbornness they admitted that that there had indeed been other complaints from the morning and that the remaining biriyanis had been sent back to the main Park St outlet. But an apology was refused.
Tried talking to the main manager Javed ( phone 9748141225) but the phone was finally switched off and even the following day wasn't answered. Trying to contact the owner was simply not allowed by all staff members.
Am still trying to get an apology but no go yet! But will keep trying.
As for you guys reading this review - want to try your luck at Rahmania?

My favourite food has always remained Biryani. I have tried almost all the popular ones_Arsalan,shiraz,Mezban & Royal. This I would rank second from the list following Shiraz. But the chicken Chaap has been consistent at all times & have maintained standards. I feel that their biryani has deteriorated over time. However, they still are good at the other dishes so rating it a fair 'FOUR'. 

The ambiance is average, and the restaurant remains empty at almost all times which I like. I always prefer privacy. The food is also pretty economical. This makes it more convenient for group dinners. I am a regular customer of Rahmania & hope they are able to maintain that :)

When Rahmania first opened it used to serve good quality food and used to be pronounced in the same breath as the other more popular places for Biryani.But of late the quality has gone down quite significantly.
The ambience and decor is not good.At present certainly not a place to dine in.One can try their take away.But then also I would recommend their Rotis and tarkas and tikias but not their Biryani.There are many better places for Biryani.

I have seen Rahmania literally grow from just another biryani place to a solid joint. It shot to fame by opening up numerous outlets in Kolkata.
They were also doing very well but then it all stopped, their quality dropped and now again it is left as a nothing as it was compared to the giants like shiraz in the area.
It is located in the Park Street-Mullick Bazaar crossing.
They used to serve pretty good biryani and chaap once and their outlet at Lake Market happened to be a huge hit but then as quality kept on deteriorating its fame also fell. Their numerous outlets started closing down.
Today it is worth nothing and I would not visit the place again but it is again a proof of how another mughlai joint failed to hold on to increasing fame a lot like Bedwin and Shiraz at one time until it reopened with a bang.
The decor is very very poor and I would not suggest it to anyone.
I do hope quite like Shiraz it also reopens all renovated and ready with new staff till then it will continue to sell at areas with low competition but will not at all be worth you money.

A non descript place - but a place for great biryanis and other non-veg dishes. A must for me always when I visit Kolkata. Its not a place to sit and dine - but great for takeaways. I recommend for anyone who loves Kolkata style biryanis.

As compared to its neighbours, it does not quite live up to the fame biriyani. Although, it did taste  good - a little different with not a very high quality of rice. It had good aroma though.

However, their Mutton Chaanp is a must try. The mutton chops are quite tender and regularly so. 

This has been my fallback option for times when the ones around are teeming with people.

The best thing that I remember about this place is an Egg Chicken Roll.  Other items are although mediocre and don't stand in competition with its counterparts in the city, must say, their rolls are really worth trying. 

Do not expect much except decent rolls from this place. Overall, okay.

The biriyani is nothing compared to what I expected it to be, & the same goes for the Chap...I liked the Kasha, though its a bit on the sweeter side & more like a korma..

Staffs and service is also good.. Overall Okay.
