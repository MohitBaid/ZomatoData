Aakash Caterer is mainly a caterer which serves in many occasions, beside their Catering business their Restaurant is also a good place to dine in. Located near the Sodpur Station on Station Road, good place for Biryani. Priced at Rs.120 the Chicken biryani is a Good deal. I have also tried their rolls which were of average quality.
Not so pleasant ambiance with small pocket pinch.

It's a small but busy food stop in sodepur station market area. They mainly serves snaks. Price is very reasonable. Attracts a fair account of local crowds and daily passengers from trains.

Alone and no food at hand? And craving for good stuffs but don't wanna shell out much?? Lazy enough to go out far? Well if you're near the Sodepur station this is very popular roadside eatery having quite a lenghty menu at hand and prices cheap...food is standard... they are known for their catrring mainly but make good food in the restro too... small but okayish ambience...

In sodepur it is quite a good place near railway station.Â 

Food- I have ordered mutton biryani, chicken kasha. Biryani is well prepared and chicken kasha is quite good.

Ambience- Not at all good. You need to cross their kitchen to get a place and the kitchen is open. The entry space is small. Not a good ambience to eat with your loved one or your family.For take away it is good restaurant.

It's not worth our time or money. Bad food. Had a really bad experience that too when very hungry. Location good but the place is tiny.

They will charge u 150-200 depending on the quantity of the chicken/mutton. Though it sounds fair,the quality of the food is not worth it. Bnj
