A very good place for chinese food when you're up for a takeaway or hone delivery, changing their name recently to Noodle Time, has changed them a bit.
Very reasonably priced menu.
Took,

Chicken Wantons
3 Chicken Fried Rice
2 plates Schezwan Chicken

Chicken Wantons(7/10): For Rs 60 you get 5 pieces and is enough for 1. Tastes crispy as usual and could have had some more filling. Quiet a good starter.

Chk Fried Rice(9/10): A very nicely prepared item. Enough amount of add-ons and it can easily be shared by 2 for each plate. Every grain on your plate will be flavorful! Remarkable.

Schezwan Chicken(8/10): Palatable it was! 8 pieces for Rs 110 was were decently sized and well cooked. The coating of the pieces were perfect and tasted very good! And not too spicy for kids(still, it depends)

Everything other than their schezwan fried rice is good here. This outlet is only for takeaway. No sitting arrangements whatsoever. Staff is well behaved.

Located near tiljala police station this small outlet serves decent Chinese preparations. I ordered a chicken chilli garlic noodles from here. The delivery was quick. The taste was okayish with too much oil though. But the bad part was I found a thin plastic like substance in my noodles. Utterly disgusted. :(

Even though a noticeable joint,  but never stopped by to eat. Until today, when I didn't have any option since it was too early to get anything from any other restaurants. Chilly chicken was ordered, the dish was nice and tasty with less batter. Not too spicy and fair amount of chicken pieces delivered. An Apt place for takeaways and home deliveries.

they are a branch of little china town operating out of tiljala area.I tried their chilli prawn and mixed schezuan rice this time.Just like their main branch,they provide good food at very reasonable rates.That means good proportion,good taste,hygienic,and no packing or delivery charge.I also tried their thai soup.Unlike preity's,they don't have an option for small or large one.They serve a preity's small version at again a cheaper rate.Very convenient for some last minute plans.

For the price you pay, you get decent quality food. Haven't checked out the place as yet, ordered from home itself. The food is decent. Not too good neither too bad.
