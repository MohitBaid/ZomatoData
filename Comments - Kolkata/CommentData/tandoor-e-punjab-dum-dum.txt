The kebabs are delicious. The tandoori kebab is one of the best I have had. The Reshmi Butter Masala is creamy and tasty. The tandoori roti is soft and moist.
The chicken rolls is fantastic.

This is one of my favorite kebab places which is very cheap. This is place is right in the middle of Sinthi more and is very easy to locate. I go to this place regularly as it is very near to my residence and serves some delicious kebabs and rolls. The place is clean and the service is usually fast despite of the pressure.

This and Nararaj are certainly one of those oldest joints at Chiriamore, B.T.Road. Since childhood I have known this place and its good old tandoori chicken, butter nun and mutton biriyanis. The place is quite small, ordinary with efficient service. Though with passing years this place has lost its charm and crowd as well because of growing competitions their biriyani is still good at quite cheap rates. Worth a try.

Easy to go food store. As a fast food centre it works pretty well for the localities. Generally different type of rolls and chicken tandoori are good over here. The place is not good to sit n dine. So, if you are passing by, you can grab a roll or can go for takeaway.

This is a Roadside small restaurant located near Chiria More crossing.This is mainly a takeaway place but they also have seating arrangements with 4-5 tables.
We tried their¬† Chicken Tangri kebab and Chicken tikka kebab and they were great.
They serve mouthwatering and delicious kebabs at a very low price.
This is a great value for money outlet....

Worst food I have ever ordered as home delivery. Butter nuns weren't edible at all. Not prepared in Tandoor and were burnt to bitter taste. No sign of butter on the nuns. Doesn't have a concept of chicken tandoori butter masala and tadka. Overall the food has to throwaway.

Tarka, Chap, Kebabs are quite reasonable.
Rolls are pretty average.
Chiriyamore lacks a good fast food joint, till then this is the place where you have to go to tame your hunger demon.

My place of birth, Dum dum has off late overburdened with big big Mughlai and tandoor restaurant like Aminia, Alibaba, and Arsalan (I honestly don't understand this creepy logic that why on earth, between 100 sq metre area, u build up 3 such restaurants) nevermind, good for us as you get to have the choice of eating any place you want. Now coming to the "Tandoor e punjab" restaurant - the most old one on dum dum road just at the chiriamore crossing, though they don't have much space for enough sitting arrangements, but somehow managed the area quite well. The reason I like this restaurant is because of its pocket friendly price list. From a school bound boy to a filthy rich marwari businessman - this place has stock for everyone. I never ever had such juicy and mouth melting egg chicken roll anywhere. In main course, biriyani, kebabs all are really nice and worth every penny. Only problem I think is with the maintenance and hygiene of the place - they should be more careful about the sanity of the place and make it more attractive in order to fetch more customers.

Standing right at the chiria more crossing for ages, This place has become integral part of the identity of chiria more.
I use this place for take away and never tasted their biryani, but I know that this place offer great kolkata rolls and brilliant Kebabs and tandoori.
The Kebabs and tandoori are in parallel with the de facto master outlets of kebabs in the city. Tho only difference is the price which is significantly low here.
A great value for money outlet which is also conveniently located.

Visited the place few days ago, placed in a good location. If you are short on your budget then surely this place is going to fill your appetite within your tight budget. Regarding their food, their Kebabs are very nice and tender. I tried their chicken tandoori, reshmi kebab and boti kebab, all of them are very good. Their Lacha Paratha is also very good but the biryani is not up to the mark. Their side dishes are also not up to the benchmark, though you can't expect more at this price range. So my recommendation goes for the Kebab's only. Surely try those items.

Just as you expect decent road side dhabas to be, the place looked clean enough to dine in.
We took a  seat and ordered chicken tandoori first, size was good and so was the taste. 
Next we ordered Reshmi butter masala and nan. They didn't take long to serve. Reshmi butter masala however could have been better, it was neither great nor any bad. Overall a decent one.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: In the Chiriamore crossing at B.T Road. Just beside the very old Restorent "Natraj". A place for quite a variety. This place is very near to my house. Usually i go there for their rolls. At the beginning it was very ordinary resto with cheap prices of the food. But Recently this place picked up the standards and they are the most eye catching resto at chiriamore.

AMBIENCE AND STAFF: Ambience is not that big but they have some tables like 5-6 to have a seat. These Resto have changed very much in these years with their decorations to space. The walls are now decorated with tiles and the floors too. Lighting have been improved. Tables and chairs are changed from sofa sitting to normal chairs. Place is neat and clean ¬†At the entry u see the roll hub and just at the gate you can see the Kababs and the Tandoori hanged in the sikh for display. Staff are ordinary but friendly. Attentive towards you.

FOOD: They serve North Indian as well as the Chinese dishes. Kebabs are very good here. Tandoori is on a disappointing side as the pieces they provide are quite small. Biriyani here is very good. ¬†The chicken in the biriyani will satisfy u really. The Chicken bharta is quite good, Taste is decent. Tandoori roti is on a hard side. Mutton Kasa is very nice, a little bit oily but it contains good sour flavour. The Rolls are very delicious here. Parathas are fried hard and red thou in Dalda oil. But the chicken, mutton and Paneer used is quite fresh and decent. Well fried in the onion, capsicum,chiilies. Chinese dishes are sort of disaster here, so its recommended to have North indian only.

QNQ and PRICES: Quality is average but good as well as the quantity is fine, little need to increase their gravy in the side dishes. Prices are pocket Friendly but some dishes are over charged, specially the Egg roll is been charged with Rs.25, Thats a bit high. Thou i had chicken biriyani here in Rs. 40 also one time. But thats history now.

Conclusion: This place have both Indian and chinese but indian dishes wins the race here. Mainly people go for take away here. Flying customers take a dine in here. Well not recommended for any party or treats.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

this place comes on the way to my home. On a rainy afternoon I tried their food. Yes...takeway is better option bcoz this place is just like a road-side dhaba....so not great for dine-in.
About food.....taste is Ok (dhaba style). I have tried Chkn boti kebab butter masala, chkn bharta, paneer butter masala & plain Nuns, Rumali rotis. The first two was quite good...but didn't like the paneer dish enough. And please try to avoid their NUNs...they are below standard. In the other hand their Rools are very popular (I haven't tried yet).
The price makes everyone happy......so don't expect much within such cheap cost.

Recomend for a change of taste....punjabi and mughlai dishes.

As mentioned by others it is mainly a take-away joint. The food is of good quality, tasty, not overtly spicy and very decently priced. I have tried their paneer tarka and liked it very much, want to try something new soon!

The Chicken Tangri Kebabs are great. However you cannot dine-in as the place is shabby...take away is a must.
