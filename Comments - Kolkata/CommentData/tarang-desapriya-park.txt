When in the mood for awesome dal tadka this is heaven. Wonderful air-conditioned seating , proper table service , and authentic Punjabi food are the trademarks of tarang. 250 is the average expenditure for a meal for 2 with cold drinks . It is superbly value for money. The butter chicken and aloo paratha is worth trying too. .5 stars deducted bcoz the bathroom is dirty.

This place just sprung up from nowhere in front of us. It was an odd hour during the Pujas as none of the popular dining places were open then.
Simple Tandoori Rotis & Chicken Rashmi Butter Masala made it look like heaven. Nevertheless, the food was really well cooked with appropriate amount of ingredients, as the taste was very delightful.
Other platters of Chicken Boti Masala & Chicken Tikka Masala were equally tasty.
The best part was, that the ingredients seemed fresh unlike anywhere else. And one may find nowadays excess / unnecessary amount of oil in any recipe, which wasn't here. Serving was good & swift. Worthy of price as the quantity & quality of the items were satisfying.
Hygiene is not up to the mark and only issue. Hope it is a temporary concern.
Apart everything else is pretty good.

Today Was Astami and as usual we are hopping in puja pendals..  After hopping some of great pendals we are starving and searching a pocket friendly restaurant with a good food.. Then we landed here at 12AM.  The restaurant was fully crowded and we were in waiting list..  After couple of minutes we finally got our seat and decided to order chicken boti kebab as starter then butter tandoori roti, rumali roti, chicken reshmi butter masala and Chicken do piyaza(Forgot to click the pic) as main course...  Everything from start to finish was good in taste but I'm little disappointed about reshmi buter masala.. 
Never mind..  :p
We enjoyed a lot. That matters most ;) CHEERS!!

I ordered tandoori chicken , veg pulao and reshmi kababs. The food was very good. It was also delivered within an hour as promised. Â The pulao especially was great. I would have given it 4.5 if the reshmi kababs hadn't been a little tough. Overall more than satisfactory experience.

It has a small seating area, although its best used as a take-away; priced moderately and servings are quite good!!
Food: 7/10
Specialising in north indian and mughlai dishes, I recommend their dal makhani, egg tadka, chicken bharta, chicken butter masala, all paneer preparations kulcha and their naans! I did not like their aaloo paratha much!!

Value for money: 8/10

I had a superb experience here at Tarang at the midnight of shashthi during the Durga Puja 2015. Most of the restaurants were closed most probably bcoz of food shortage. So after seraching here and there nearby at Deshapriya Park, I and my Frnndzz hopped at Tarang. We ordered pure Punjabi delicacies and no wonder the owner of the restora was superb and Mazzaddarr..!!!
We orderd Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Tikka...the tastes was Superb and the prices were quite Resonable....
#Kudos to Tarang..!!!

Don't visit with high expectations as this is a small place, which is better for your take away. The taste is good. Provides sitting space with food being served on the table. Provides AC and thus can be visited at all times.

I have had take away from here. The food is really good. The dal makhani and paneer butter masala are tasty. Chicken tarka is even better but the chicken bharta needs more improvement. The tandoori and romali rotis are really soft.

A not so well known joint but this place serves some great north indian food. Mostly a take away joint they also have an air-conditioned restaurant. Being owned by a punjabi family you certainly get that awsome flavour that is mastered and perfected by them. The chicken tikka butter masala the kadhai chickrn and the bhuna chicken are the 3 best dishes there. Couple with tandoori roti or tawa roti fresh from the oven even betters the food. But the one thing you have to try here is the tadka dal and yes their dal is "tadka marke". All said the one thing that tops everything is that they serve all their food with a cherry on top a signature that you come across in dhabas of repute that was the main attraction in my childhood days and yes we still fight about who gets the cherry!!!

Location: Tarang is located diagonally on opposite to Royal Lebanese. Basically serves Indian food and is a very short place basically for takeaways. 

Discussing the pros and cons now. 

Pros:-
1) located at a prime location.
2) service is moderate
3) very small fast food Center earning good amount of money 

Cons :-
1) unhygienic food
2) food quality is not upto the mark
3) kababs are very hard. They should be tender.
4) no seating arrangements
