Ask a bangali guy to hop in for a booze treat and he would leap into it in a blink of an eye. Ours was no different when my colleague & I decided to try out local bars around esplanade & chandni chowk area. So after hovering here & there, we stumbled into mayfair which is at stone's throw from chung wah opposite of LIC building.

We entered into the ground floor sitting which is the bar. A peaceful dimly lit ambience which was empty at that point of time(around 4.30). The place is small with 7-8 tables. We quickly grabbed our seat & ordered the following:-

1. Haywards 5000 & Carlsberg elephant - Must try haywards if you are looking for super strong beers.

2. Chicken pakora - A full plate comes with 8 pcs. Crunchy coated with tender chicken sprinkled in chat masala served with chopped onions & lemon. This was a superb starter with our beers.

3. Chilli babycorn - We ordered the dry one although the same wont be there in the menu so you will have to specify that. Babycorn wasn't crunchy but it was soft & was nicely cooked with capsicums,chillies & onions. The quantity was very generous & could easily be shared by 2 persons. Recommended dish!!

4. Crispy chicken - Shredded crispy chicken prepare in sweet chilli sauce. Again came in huge quantity although it was a tad sweet to our liking but none the less was good in taste.

The service was good & the servers are attentive. The food was also provided within a decent time period. The bill came to around 1350 for 5 beers(650ml) & 3 starters which was light on the pockets for 2 persons. They only charge additional service tax of 6â„…. No VAT or liquor tax, so cheers to that. So hit this spot if you are looking for cheap booze place with good food.

Very reasonably priced place. Apart from the drinks, I would suggest a plate of "Thai Chicken". It's awesome. Beats KFC hands down any day. And the sauce that comes with it. Ohhhh!!!!!

Visited here once during college days to enjoy a glass of chilled beer with buddies. Not much to talk about this place. An average pocket friendly bar.

I don't know why people mention the "shabby" adjective... I have been at shabbier and nastier places at Kolkata...

Well... This one's sophisticated... Yes, it's a jackpot... I haven't seen any other place of this standard offering Havana Club rum for a meagre 120 rupees...

Employees are polite... Me and my friend who also happens to be an alcohol connoisseur, really liked this place...

It's once again a shabby place but some how I found many people who like this place. There are very loyal customers of this place who wants to come here only and I also went with the so called loyal Customer. Price is very cheap and service is good but place is little down market. Got to find not that great gentry having food or drinks over there so if u wish to go with a family then definitely avoid.

This is a bar at Chandni Chowk

Intro : A bar just beside Madras Restaurant .. In short this is a dearth cheap place for drinks that is it ... I have visited this place quite a few times from the last 10 years ! 

Let me just give you the prices of drinks and you will faint :
Lager beer : 130
Blenders , signature : 100
Smirnoff :100
Teachers :120 

Do not expect anything else other than such dearth cheap drinks ... 

Oh one more thing never ever even think of using their rest room

Summary : a place to have drinks at prices you can't believe ... That's it 

Rating : 3.5 (just for offering such amazing prices on drinks ) or else I would have rated 2.5

If you are  a  TIPPLER like me then  please visit  this  BAR  , drinks at awesome prices  100 pipers 60  ml peg costs only Rs 160 , food is very decent too  , but ambience is pathetic ....  A  NO GO wiTh  FAMILY  .....  but  for STAGS   this  is tippler's paradise  ...  drink to your  heart's  content & be surprised  at the Low amount  of bill ....  try out  teacher's  & 100  pipers  ....  also try HAVANA rum ( for rum guzzlers  )  a very decent proposition for aspiring as well as current tipplers
