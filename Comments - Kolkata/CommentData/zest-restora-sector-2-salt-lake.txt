The place is situated inside the 206 bus stand. This place offers good food at reasonable rate. 
Must try the Chinese dishes that they offer . The staff is also polite. The place is clean and I guess that's the best part of the whole thing .

We had food delivered yesterday for a 30 member team lunch. Ordered mutton n chichen hydrabadi biryani.... the food is quite ok in terms of taste mutton quality is better than chicken one . But all biryanis r little bit more spicy n oily in even after egg n aloo added...
Apart from this we had navaratna qorma n fried rice also the veggies liked it. N a vetki masala also in the order. That is quite delicious.... overall ok in terms of taste. My rating goes half xtra nly bcus of its prompted delivery n over the phone their behaviour(even they were ready to take old 500/1000).... A good place to try as its near by 206 bus stop in sec 2 salt lake so not very far from college more area.

Ordered Chicken Biryani. Not at all satisfied. I have had Biryani from relatively lesser known outlets. The taste along with the smell of egg together complicated to something not that palatable. However, the delivery was prompt and very precise.

This is an average place to dine. Pocket friendly. Staff is polite. Chinese cuisine is good. But the biryani isn't satisfactory. The interior is dark..like seriously dark! But if you want to have food to satisfy your stomach without burying a hole in your pocket, Zest is a good option,otherwise not. The location isn't where you'd normally think a restaurant would be. Its inside a bus terminal.

I, along with some colleagues have been admirers of this place for the last 16years. Originally this restaurant was at Kwality Saltlake, at BE block opp to AE market area. Small place, where one would have to climb up to find recluse and comfort of some patent specialities, without burning your pocket.
What this place has never failed me for:
Lungfung soup, chicken veg soup, chicken reshmi kebab, lemon chicken, Manchurian fish or chicken, and a special dish which we customized as and when required -- the steamed rice with vegetables, mushroom, prawns and chicken , which was their divine invention. If you have not tried it here, you have missed something really good.
Now that the place has shifted to the hidden corner of the 206 bus stand, not many new people are aware. The interior is very unimpressive now, but the quality of service is still maintained.

Food - Mixed Fried Rice (with pork preferably), Tandoori Chilly Chicken and Chilly Pork (dry) - and you are in heaven! You are just in heaven, trust me.

Ambiance - Average. Light is little dim for my taste.

Service - Good actually. The  middle aged guy is very attentive and modest.

Bottom line - Believe me, just those three dishes...and you are in heaven!!

They prepare Lungfung soup and Lemon Chicken very well and hence these may be taken as starter and with main course respectively.

With the soup try to enjoy Chicken Reshmi Kebab from their kitchen!!

Have been a regular since last few years while ordering home delivey on sunday nights from them. Always used to order chinese from them as they specialise in that cuisine as per me. Ordered chilly panner hakka veg chow chilly chkn and veg rice from them this sunday  8thmay 2016 evening. Chowmein was burnt chilly panner was burnt and tasted very odd rice and chkn was just abt ok. This was very odd considering past experience from them. Immediately called up zest informed them about food quality . They said they made everything fresh and denied any misdoing. There was no point arguing we thougt we will give the panner to our housemaid next day ..however to our suprise while giving it to her next day a dead coakroach was there insude the gravy fully cooked...yuck..please do not order from this place..if u do at your own risk..

Located at the 206 bus stand opposite BJ block. They have a decent dining area ..mod sized..

Good for the Indian food like nan roti and chicken dish.. Like the chicken kasa or butter masala types... 
Chinese is okish ..I still remember their biriyani which was one of the value for money dishes... 
Best place for students specially

we called the restaurant but he has denied to take it back. Moreover the food quality was bad... I suggest do not order from this restaurant.

I remember this place from my childhood when this was situated near Kwality Bus Stand. An age-old restaurant and equally popular, this institution still stands tall as a popular hangout competing against some big names inside Salt Lake City, Kolkata.

The current location is within the vicinity of 206 Bus Stand, as it is popular called, a stoppage just after No. 8 Island. The ambiance is nothing special and is more of a quiet and serene one. The lighting is pretty dim but the tables and chairs are sufficiently spaced. They offer a variety of menu from Indian to Chinese but down these 10+ years, the single most combination which has stood the test of time (atleast to me) would be their Noodles and Dry Chilli Chicken. The kind of Pan Fried Noodles they offer serves as a perfect companion to their juicy Chicken Balls spiced with the right amount of Soya Sauce and Chilli.

I can go back everyday to have a plate or two alone of the Chilli Chicken without even bothering to have anything with it. This is one restaurant I want to remain as operational till I live here in Salt Lake. :-P

Zest has been more of a take out place than a eat in restaurant for me. When I was living in Salt Lake, I ordered atleast once a week from Zest. We had a set menu, as ordering anything else would mean betrayal of something divine.

I would highly recommend this place for wo dishes - Chilly Pork (Dry) and Special Chilly Chicken. 

Along with this, you can order either the meifoon or their special fried rice (with pork and prawns and everything). 

If you chose to eat in, do order the prawns papad to munch on, while you stare at the pre 911 image of World Trade Center.

Being the nearest eatery from home, this happens to be my SOS place for home alone days. The food is okay. Have tried a few options on the menu as take-aways. The foo-yung is worth a try. The hakka noodles are decent as well. The veg manchurian is a no. Otherwise a decent place when needed. Happy eating.

Located adjacent to the 206 bust stand, Zest serves decent food at reasonable prices. The ambiance is good enough for people to comfortably have whatever they want to. One mostly wouldn't find air-conditioning in a restaurant with the range of prices they have. It's perfectly suited for people looking for home delivery in and around this area. I stayed at SA block for more than 2 years and used to visit the place frequently. Overall, nothing too great but quite a nice joint.

The soup tasted really good. For main course we ordered Mixed Chow(Gravy) and Shezwan Chicken. Quantity was Very good. Both the Chowmin and Chicken side dish was good in quality and taste. We also got 4pcs of Chicken Lollypop as complementary offer. We were surprised to see the bill as there was not Vat included. Staffs are also well behaved.

One of the oldest restaurants (or perhaps the oldest) in Salt Lake had shifted its base from the Quality-bus stand area to the Baishakhi bus stand area. Very simplistic, the outlet draws crowd because of its tasty food and Chinese cuisine. The Indian dishes are good too, but the Chinese is the best. However over the years, it has been losing the crowd because of competition and its own denial to upgrade/modernanise. 

My favourite here are the Lung Fung Soup and the Fried Prawn Balls. Inexpensive but resourceful, they are a great hit and have not lost their charm over the years. The noodles/fried rice and Hong Kong chicken are wonderful too. You can also try the "Mushroom Baby Corn with Steam Rice" which is also popularly known as "Shabji Bhaath" ?

I pray that this restaurant continues its run over many more years.

OMG! Cant believe this- thanks to the team of Zomato for including this restaurant. It is just a stone throws distance from my apartment! After reconstruction,AC installation, it became a decent restaurant. Very pocket friendly, no VAT added to bill! Just taste "chicken hyderabadi biriyani" there- my favourite. You gotta taste it once... and if you are a veggie, i will recommend "chilli potato"... overall, a nice small cosy restaurant to get away from maid's cooking!!

I can give review for the veg food only. Veg dishes are average and not delicious. I had paneer butter masala which was very less in quantity. I also had dum aloo which was a bit good. The reason behind I gave rating 2.5 is because of NAAN. They do not know how to make NAAN. Infact in many restaurants in Salt lake area I found they are not good in making Naan. Yes tandoor roti is good here but I had the worst Naan here in my life. So if you guys are visiting this place, try not to order NAAN.

Rates are reasonable and place to sit is also good. They have AC but not all of them were in working condition when I visited there. 

Staff here always irritate you by asking for order in advance at once. How could I order everything at once? Damn it.

I have been visiting this place for last 10 years. And i like this place very much. This is not a hi-fi resraurant. It's an avaerage class restaurant. But the food in here is superb. Like i said i have been visiting this place for long time, and the food quality is still the same. The waiters are very friendly and polite. They always give a warm welcome. Every food is delicious. Specially i like the mutton kasha. Well cooked and super tasty. Biriyani is a bit dry. Chinese items are also good. You can have the pork items without the hygiene issues. Though the quantity is a bit lesscompared to the price. But when you will have the food you will forget that. Never tried any desert. So dont have opinion on that. They have shifted to a different place some years ago, but they did not compromise the quality or the service. So overall i give this place a good rating
