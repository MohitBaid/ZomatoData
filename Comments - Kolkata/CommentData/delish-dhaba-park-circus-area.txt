The place is nicely decorated.... Service was excellent.... Behavior of the staff members was good.... Ordered Kabab, butter tandoori roti, and two chicken side dishes.... The food quality is good.... 24 hours it remains open so it is a plus point.... I would refer this place to my friends and family..

This place showered me with an immense happy feeling...It is a bollywood themed restaurant with cool graffitis painted on the walls...
The food has to be marvellous...the delicacies that we ordered were  chicken bharta, butter tandoori roti and chicken tikka kebab which was not spicy but yet hunger quenching. 

I would definitely recommend this place for all.

I went there during Durga Pujo.. amazing food, well mannered stuff and very beautiful decorative place. During Pujo it's very difficult to get seats available, luckily we found this place & we entered & u won't believe.. the moment we entered, we found a place beautifully decorated with movie posters, it was around 10.30pm but they served us yummy mouthwatering dishes.. although the decoration is like a dhaba but a very sophisticated place.. we went for a Diner date & it was a marvellous experience there.

While walking we discovered this place and almost hopped in to as we were too hungry.. a newly opened restro with nice filmy decoration inside.. but........ when it comes to food it was not so nice.. we asked them what would be the best food to order then and they said "biriyani". All I can say is the taste was average.. didn't enjoyed the food that much.. If we visit again thn will try something else with fingers crossed

Never expected butter chicken to be so sweet and in white gravy and chicken was not well cooked. I order a lot from many restaurants a friend suggested me this one and I decided to go for butter chicken and having a taste of Punjabi dishes this was not at all the butter chicken anyone should expect. Kadhai chicken though was better when I had ordered it last time before this order. hope you consider my suggestion and start making butter chicken in a gravy more appropriate and suitable for the name butter chicken.

Not really great food. I had a terrible experience ordering from this place. I ordered Chilly garlic noodles which was mentioned under veg dishes but I was served with chicken in the noodles and the restaurant tells me that they usually put chicken in CHILLY GARLIC NOODLES. Then I dont understand the difference between Chicken Chilly Garlic Noodles and Chilly Garlic Noodles...

Another midnight and late night hotspot when your stomach craves more more. Overall a comfortable place to hop in and dine in peace witj services being a bit laggard.

The interior is well furnished with a unique theme of old bollywodish posts and quotes. Well maintained and clean and food ranges from average to good. 

Dal makhni and roti have been my favourite along with a few kebabs on the plate. Sometimes the price does cross a limit, so do keep a check. Overall a good place with somewhat better food and the only well to do sustaianance in the middle of the night when you are in high craving for good food

Kebab were soft made served with green mint chutney, chowemin was very tasty and friend rice was not up to my taste but still the quality of food was too good and yuuuaammi

A place where u get the best servicing with delicious food and remarkable filmy quotes...

i have seen this bright exterior of the outlet several times really late at night while returning from office and always wanted to explore more....finally got the chance last night when i went for a late night date with my wife and was looking for options to eat outside.... Delish it had to be and i am so happy to have discovered this hidden gem which was there out in broad day light but never heard a lot of tales before unfortunately..... before i start talking about the food,  the decor needs a special mention which is not the most creative since several other restaurants in the city and country has opted for something similar but the entrance got me impressed.... its a replica of a typical punjab truck back and you will understand it better once u see the pics... very catchy and noticeable..... inside,  the chandelier is worth taking a second look which is made out of a big wooden wheels and lanterns..... we entered and were greeted nicely and while we walked inside, we saw that the place was divided into sections and we went inside one of the rooms...walls are decorated with bollywood ester year graphities and given a typical punjabi dhaba look.... the menu card was typically the home delivery leaflets and i was surprised a bit to see the real ones missing..... the menu was elaborate with indian and chinese cuisine on offer and we went for chicken bharta,  mutton biriyani and garlic butter naan and a sweet lassi.... the waiting time was manageable and the service was swift.... the food was excellent.... the biriyani was the best wit the flavours very subtle and the overall dish very light on the palate yet oozing with the exuberance of what you expect out of a typical biriyani.... the bharta too was creamy and tasty with flaky naan..... when compared with the pocket pinch,  you would love to come here again and again.... all these food with no additional tax costed us 460 only...... this place can host bigger groups of 10-12 easily and is absolutely recommended for all kinds of crowd,  couple,  family,  friends etc.... located bang on the main road of park circus on your left if you travel from ballygunge phari towards park circus..... cheers to the team and i bet its certainly better than the current zomato score shown.... probably they dont rock much with the Chinese cuisine as i understood from some of the reviews but the Indian food rocks for sure.....0.5 score deducted due to non availability of desserts at the end of our meal and i was so craving for shahi tukra which was there in the menu and the fact that while the place looks clean,  the room inside we sat had dirty floors and shabby walls....

This place is opposite the Quest Mall and just beside "Royal" restaurant at Park Circus Zeeshan crossing. The entrance of this restaurant is quite interesting, it looks like a tempo. The interior decor is influenced by Bollywood and it's pretty interesting. There's a small cabin which is AC. 

We ordered 

Chicken Malai Kebab- They served 6 kebab pieces of medium size. The dhania chutney was a bit more liquid (as if water was added to it).

Tandoori butter naan- It was covered with melted butter and was too tasty. I haven't tasted such naan for a long time.
 
Chicken lababdar - It was so yummy and so tasty. I will definitely try this dish again.

Chicken Reshmi butter masala - This dish was creamy and people who like garlic will love this dish more.

The only complain is that there were some kind of disturbance which was coming from outside (Some boys were singing and shouting inside the kitchen I guess). Also the area near the washroom was stinking a bit. The authority should look into these two issues. I would like to opt for a takeaway from this restaurant next time.

Excellent decor with posters of Bollywood classic movies all around the restaurant. I had gone to the previous restaurant also which is just beside the present one. The food was really good. Specially the kebabs and tandoori naan..
But for the present one I never dined in, just took a parcel of chilli chicken. The food taste was not up the the standard what I was excepting. Keeping the taste aside, while placing the order when I asked the person about the chicken whether it was shredded or chunks of chicken will b there, the person said it will b shredded. But to my surprise it was chunks of chicken.
So it highly suggested that the server should know the menu properly before taking order.
Otherwise I like the restaurant and would love to visit again.

This restaurent is located in sayed amir ali avenue jst a few walking mins away from quset mall near nasiruddin road just beside ROYAL INDIAN  resaturent.
The place is wonderfully decorated..the main entrance of the restaurent resembles somewhat of a desi lorry .. very unique and one of its kind.. 
The restaurent consits of ac and non-ac dining hall.. the only difference between this is the tax which is slightly more than if you eat in the non-ac rooms
The non ac and ac rooms are wonderfully decorated with various hindi movie postes and drawings of bollywood superstars... the size of the interior is preety large and the service is okayish.... 
Now comming to the food we ordered 2 chicken biriyani..  i was absolutely amazed( as i was not expecting to be) to find that it tasts really awsome .. some what less spicy but absolutely awsome ...the portion of the salad was decent two... the quantity and quality was good..
Really i will again visit this particular place and try the rest of the menu.. somewhere i feel that all of the dishes will be good and also it costs much less compared to a restaurent of its class..
Guys its a definately must go not only if you want to spend  much decorated time in a place like a tipical DHABA  but also because of the food!!

The quality and taste of food is good and usually they serve fresh. I prefer to visit here during my dinner meal because the chef during the day times doesn't cook very well...
Interior of this place is not up to mark but as per the food prospects i have rated 3/5.

After a very buzy day with stomach seeking for some heavy dinner with less than 200 as a budget, the only option that i reminded myself, was to search for something apt from little app. Found this one, and without any preliminery research headed there with a friend of mine.
We bought a coupon code of 6 course non veg chinese dinner. (Per head 150 bucks)
The restaurant's ambience was okay with a service that was pretty responsive.
But what disappointed me was the quality of food they provided us and what mesmerized me was their quantity and all that i was getting for 150 bucks. The fresh lime soda was vey refreshing but sweet corn soup was lacking flavour, the dry chilli chicken's were awfully prepared and the veg momo's were pathetic to eat. However mixed hakka chowmein was appetizing and chicken shezwan and fried rice were more or less "Delish" . They could not provide us with the flavour of ice cream that we wanted but that was okay.
Even though it could not satisfy my taste buds but the good quantity of food over-gratified the hunger and made us leave with satisfaction.

Located close to Quest Mall, this little restaurant is worth a visit. The decor is that of a typical dhaba only with bollywood posters everywhere,even on the table (mine had SRK screaming *Don't underestimate the power of a common man!*). The staff were also very friendly. 
 
I ordered Tandoori Chicken, Tandoori Butter Roti and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala(it was past lunch time). The Tandoori Chicken was cooked to perfection with the right amount of condiments unlike a few restaurants that overload the chicken with extra spices. I might as well say it is one of the best i've ever had. However the tandoori butter roti had a faint hint of butter in it. The Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was a hit, garnished with a generous amount of fresh cream. Lastly i completed my meal with a glass of sweetened lassi since my favourite gulaab jamun wasn't available. The quantity of the food is remarkable, whatsoever.

I would recommend this place for its spread of North Indian delicacies that does not burn a hole in your pocket. Enjoy your meal with a series of romantic bollywood numbers!

Who could imagine that in an area with all the big names , Arsalaan , Royal and others a new place could pop up and create a name in such short time.
All this has been possible due to their great food   (specially Kebabs and North Indian delicacies), prime location(opp. Quest mall) and good service. As the name suggest it has been given a tinge of the dhaba atmoshphere wid the walls glammering with posters of old bollywood movies and good bollywood tracks being played . In food chicken tandoori was the pick of the menu . Overall a good experience.

Chicken Bharta - the right amount of spice and the gravy was lip-smacking.
Veg Pulao - the usual.
Naan Roti - one of the better naan rotis I've had in a while.
Virgin mohito - cool and refreshing as promised.

The quantity of each item was quite considerate, and the taste was just right - north indian food at its best. The most overpowering factor was the price. The place is quite cheap and the food, great.

We were greeted and served by Md. Alamgir..  he was extremely courteous and ensured nothing was a miss!

I HAD A NICE EXPERIENCE!!!!
After going through not very gud review here from a lot of people who went with a nearby coupon I was very scared of what's in store for me .
Thankfully the staff was very warm.no problem with voucher . We were provided all the item written in the nearby menu.
1. Fresh lime soda sweet : 👍. It's a nimbu pani than a fresh lime soda since soda content was less.
2. Chicken coriander lemon soup : nice taste , huge quantity only problem was excess salt. We told the person serving .he very politely said he can bring another serving.
3. Chilly chicken dry : tasted gud . Most places I have seen making it dry leads to excess salty. Taste was bang on in this.
4. Steamed chicken momo: nicely steamed momo chicken content generous. Szechwan sauce lovely.
5. Chicken Hakka chowmin : no excess oil and gud quantity. Taste gud enough.
6. Veg fried rice : very nicely done
7. garlic chicken : quantity is gud. Chicken was soft. Taste ok.
8. Ice cream : 👍 they were served with some cyrup . If not done that . It. Whould have been much better.

My exp was gud . Staff behaviour very nice.

The ambiance is something unique .

Delish is located in a place that is surrounded by amazing restaurants that everyone is trying to get in to. You definitely need to step up your game.. 
The food was delivered on time,  which is the only plus point I can think of at the moment. 
Overall you guys have the potential and the means to do so much better. 
Pros :
Evenly priced, 
Vast Menu

Cons : 
Quality of meat isn't good at all. 
Food cooked is way too blande.

Suggestions :
Raise the prices if you have to,  the food market won't allow you to fall out of buisness. But that bieng said, you operate the same time as resturants such as Sharma and Jai hind Dhaba do. You can be different but try your best to keep up

This restaurant was in my bookmark list since it had been opened and today finally visited to have a 6 course chinese lunch through a nearbuy coupon. After we entered the staffs took us to the dining area and we comfortably seated. The ambiance of the dhaba type restaurant is quite filmy and colorful. We ordered a lemon coriander chicken soup, Chilly Chicken dry as starter followed by chicken fried momo. Then for the main course we chose schezwan chicken along with chicken noodles and veg fried rice. We preferred sweet fresh lime soda as mocktail. The food arrived within 15 minutes. Starting with the soup it tasted just awesome. It was a perfect lemon coriander soup with delicious balance of flavors and lots of chicken. Then coming to the starter chilly chicken dry tasted good but nothing extra ordinary. The fried momo tasted really yummy and it was probably the most tasty dish of the day after the soup. Now coming to the main course the gravy of schezwan chicken was a little bit extra spicy yet tasty. The quantity and quality of both the chicken noodles and the veg rice was good. The noodles tasted more yummy in comparison with the rice. The fresh lime soda was refreshing. Lastly the dessert was served and it was just two very small vanilla scoops which actually disappointed us. 😞
Overall it was a great value for money deal to us. So it was a satisfactory experience. The staffs need to be more professional in their job as I had to ask them to serve slow when they were just serving one after another within a couple of minutes. Otherwise according to the foods they served it deserves 3.5 out of 5.

Worst dining experience ever. I don't know where to start the starters Horrible , Main course Disgusting Dessert Dreadful.

Went there yesterday at 12:30am only good thing about this restaurant is that it is open all through the night.

Now this is a good looking outlet with posters of famous bolly flicks but that's the only silver lining. Staffs were although polite but untrained.

Now food... THE HORROR.... in starters we ordered crispy  chilly baby corn which was not at all crispy but mushy and tandoori chicken was very dry. In main course we ordered butter chicken which was not at all eatable it was straight out of those shitty kitchen nightmare's restaurant .. I am no Gordon Ramsay but.. I know my chicken and that shit ruined chicken for me FOREVER.We also ordered paneer lababdar and paneer kadhai which were equally bad. Paneer kadhai had paneer chillie's gravy and was awful. Breads were decent but this was my worst dining experience ever. We went there late at night and that may be one of the reasons of the food being like this but it is no excuse to serve food straight out of garbage cans in customer's plates.

I am never going back to this place and for all you guys TRY THIS PLACE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Reasonably priced. Staff is very friendly. The Chinese food is very spicy but tastes good. Indian food is tasty and well made. Overall a great place to take a big group at a low cost.

Nice place to hang out with friends. Food is considerably good and the place is well decorated with posters and paintings. A reasonable place as well.

Staff are not trained properly, they do not accept debit cards which is weird but they are taking paytm payments anyways we did not face such problems as we went on a nearbuy coupon.
We got Fresh Lime Water, Chicken Drumsticks, Chicken Steam Momo, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Noodles and Veg Fried Rice. All the items were extremely spicy which made it a nightmare for us.
Ambience is cool but the place is not clean or tidy at all. Overall a below average experience. Manager has a bad body language and presentation/speaking skills are extremely poor you guys need a proper individual. Wish you well.

Went here by a nearby coupon, half of the things you cannot choose from their menu, my request to the management is then why not provide a separate menu for Online platforms if you have so much issues! Disgusting a s hell! The staff members are an arrogant display! Although food is okayish but nowadays to level up ambiance and staff behaviour matters a lot!! Huge scope of improvement :(

Just opposite quest mall beside ali baba golden. This place is ideal for people who love bollywood masala films. Well decorated and looks like a bollywood 80's ka shack. The quirky bollywood dialogues inspired tag lines are splendid. Coming to the food- served in earthen traditional dishes and gives quite an ethnic old school feeling. We ordered a veg noodles and shredded chicken garlic pepper. The noodles were of very good quality and excellent taste. it is enough for 2people. The chicken side dish was good but needed a little more of spices. It was more on the light chinese style. Overall an excellent affordable place.

"Delish Dhaba"

Tomorrow I visit this place..
I buyed the ₹99 coupon from nearby Groupon..in the menu,, there were 2mocktails and 1non veg or veg starter..it's located near Quest mall..when You crossed the quest mall..towards park circus..it will be on left side...
Now coming to food..
First of all,,when m going to place the order about mocktails..they said mocktails are not available..only lime soda and blue lagoon(I can't remember the exact name) is available..It was really disappointing..
Next..about starter ,,I ordered Chicken Lollipop..
First the lady said four pieces will be there.. afterwards she said "no mam..6pieces"
They even don't know..
When the chicken Lollipop came it was cold..
They served cold food...
It was disappointing...
And the lime soda...it was like yaaak!!
The lime soda's you get on footpaths about 10bucks...which is better from that one...
It was very bad experience of mine..
I personally don't prefer this restaurant..👎

So I am reviewing  this restaurant after a month since I dint use zomato for some time. It was late and we were hungry so one of my friend recommended this place we went there at 2 am on a Saturday night. 
1st the interior - the interior was sober and decent nothing too posh or classy with bollywood movie posters as it is the new trend I guess. 
2nd the staff - the staff were dressed like Dhaba walas and were very warm and well mannered. 

3rd the food and pricing - the food was surprisingly  very nice we ordered a crisp mushroom and a crisp babycorn and a veg haka noodles. 
The reson for giving it 3 is that we waited for more than 40 mins for our food so to compensate the  manager offered us free blue lagoon drink. And also apologised for the delay. But as they say all's well that's ends well. So the food at a very affordable price might work for this restaurant. And they are open 24*7.

Just opposite to quest mall,the outer decoration of this place will ofcourse draw you,it drew us too.But the food disappointed us to an extreme level.We ordered peas polao but it was nothing but ghee stuffed rice with peas scattered all over.We had also ordered dry chilli chicken which was BURNT! We had opted for a takeaway for which we had to wait for long 40mins which also signifies very slow service. After such a long wait the food they packed for us was rubbish.

It's a new eatery with unique filmy decor and lorry graffiti! We went there with a combo voucher and ordered pan fried chili fish, veg fried rice, chicken noodles and chicken sweet n sour. All were delicious, specially the pan fried chili fish.

Well its newly opened just opposite Quest mall . Another place to check out for biriyani. It was overall a good experience. The decor is eye catching.More kinda filmy and it's quite fun. The food was tasty and pocket friendly. More visits can be suggested..Filmy experience!

Both Chinese and North Indian all those that I tried lived up to the mark. Chicken Malai Kabab was worth the price paid for. Butter Naan was soft and Paneer Lababdar was well cooked.

Special mention should be made of Drums of Heaven and Fish in Sweet and Sour sauce, since it leaves an impressive and lasting taste in your pallette.


Although, servicing is slightly delayed here but the amicable staff, congenial ambience and unique interiors add an extra plus point.
Considering most of the mainstream dhabas I have been to, Delish Dhaba is an eye catcher for all those who relish North Indian and Chinese.
