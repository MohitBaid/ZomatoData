Very poor and lethargic service. The menu was very limited and quantity was disappointing for the prices quoted. We did not get a seat in the nearby places..so we had to check this out. But a must NO!

Senator, a budget hotel, stands right in the middle of corporate offices, shopping malls nd a high-rise residential area.... While its first-floor,,,,La Oriental Resto Bar lacks smart interiors,,, it makes up in the wide range of offerings in both the drinks nd food... The well-stocked bar offers regular liquors, spirits nd innovative cocktails- you should try their house classic cocktail Calcutta Cooler....Murgh Kasturi Kebab, Nawabi Seekh Kebab, Chicken/Fish Satays nd the fiery Drums of Monster (Chicken Wings in Green and Red Schezwan Sauce) are my favourites from their regular Indian, Chinese nd Continental fare....

It's a bar. Does not serve main course meals. Ambience is good, not too crowded, so chances are you will get a place easily. Starters are good.

The reason behind giving 3.5 to this is that we couldn't actualy taste the main course here as we were a bit late. So started with drinks which is like rilly cheap. In terms of dishes,would like to mntion about only jade chicken and pan fried fish which was tasty enough. But the ambience is something which is realy here to look for..

It is a small hotel and restaurant of the hotel is very good. The food is really tasty but not at all costly. The ambience is also very good . The Italian cuisine and continental cuisine is really very nice.

I have been here for almost 100 times since past 5 years and I have realized that the price of food has increased BUT the taste is quite inferior to what it was before.
The service here is okay.The decor is simple but sophisticated.
