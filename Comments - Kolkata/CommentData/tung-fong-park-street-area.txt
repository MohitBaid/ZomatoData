They are one of the great Chinese Restaurants in the City. Some dishes that I must suggest are - Kung Pao Lamb,  Golden Fried Jumbo Prawns, Tung Fong special chilly fish, Brownie ice cream (you'll really be amazed having this üòÄ)
They have great accommodation and good service. 
They also make good meifoon and rice. You can have a choice of sauces like Schezwan, chilly garlic etc. 
Overall you can have a great time coming here. 
Try bringing more and more friends and family. 
It's more fun coming in large groups.

Tung Fong is one of the oldest and authentic Chinese makers in Park Street.
It is bound to please you with its mouthwatering dishes and its rich ambience.
*Food : We had ordered Hot and Sour Chicken soup, Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, Chilli Garlic Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Schezwan. 
The rice had chicken, scrambled eggs, prawn and veggies with a subtle flavor of Garlic and chilly. It had a very balanced blend of spices. Price: ‚Çπ188
Schezwan Chicken was a bit disappointing. It did not came out to be that delicious. Rather a decent chicken preparation. I expected it to be more spicy but was a bit on the sweeter side. Price: ‚Çπ288 (6 pieces)
The starters i.e Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken was made with perfection. Tung Fong has its Special green sauce which goes phenomenally well with the starter. The chicken pieces are quite moderate in size, tender, flavorful and filling. Price ‚Çπ 393/-
Coming to the star of the meal. The Chicken hot n sour  soup was the best part. It consisted of a good quantity of shredded chicken, mushrooms, tofu, and a variety of veggies; thick in consistency, delicious and the best  it is a perfect indulgence in this winter. Price ‚Çπ 263/- (2 portions)
*Quality: The quality of the dishes are commendable.
*Ambience: Tung Fong occupies a quite large place with two storey seating arrangement. The ambience is rich and lively. It compliments the yummy food there.
* Value for money : Tung Fong must be in your wish list if you are looking for some authentic Chinese dishes at a reasonable rate. Our total bill was around ‚Çπ1200
* Highly recommended: Chicken Hot n Sour Soup 
I am looking forward to explore more of Tung Fong. üëç

Went there on 1st Jan when when it was comparatively less crowded. I loved the ambience in the first go. 
We ordered red pepper chicken and two soups (sweet corn and hot and sour) both the small one. The quantity was absolutely perfect for one person.
Then we ordered chicken fried rice and half chicken manchurian which was really delicious. The bill was around 1000. 
Which I found best was the quantity. If anyone is thinking half plate might not be enough then let me tell you it was 9 pieces of chicken. 
Very happy and would love to go there again and again.

Situated right at the heart of Kolkata's food/ party hub Park Street, Tung Fong is truly a remarkable Chinese restaurant.

The Good -
i. Ambience & Decor - Soothing
ii. Service - Polite and courteous staff along with prompt service.
iii. Food - For starters we ordered Red Pepper Chicken and Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, both of the items were absolutely splendid. For main course, Mixed Hakka Chowmein and Five Spice Chicken were nothing short of perfection. The Five Spice Chicken had a smokey flavor to it, it was excellent as per my tastebuds. For dessert we ordered Chocolate Brownie, which was good too.
iv. Pocket Pinch - This is the most important highlight, I was happily surprised with the bill. @Considering the food quantity, Tung Fong is true value for the money.

The bad -
NONE

Overall -
Tung Fong has made its place in my heart after this visit, and I will surely be visiting them again. Good job guys, keep it up.

We visited Tung Fong for a birthday celebration. The place is quite awesome & there is a separate area which can be reserved. We ordered chicken soups & hot garlic fish for starters. In main course, we decided to have kung pao lamb, chilli chicken & chilli honey prawns along with fried rice & noodles. We liked most of the items. The prawn was simply the best with distinct flavour.

We visited this place 2 days back. We had plans for clubbing so we went there around 6.30 for early dinner. It was empty then. It was beautiful inside with lights and all. And as it was the last week of the year and Christmas time, they decorated it too. We ordered Crispy baby corn and chilly pepper fish for starters. Then veg noodles and another fish side dish for main course. We loved all of them. And the quantity was huge. We ordered half plate and they served 7 pieces of fish. It was yummy with right amount of spices. The waiters were courteous and attentive enough. I loved my experience here. Must visit place for a good Chinese dinner. :)

Today went to tung fong to have lunch with my family . The year end' s rush kept us waiting for 30 minutes, although no issues with it. But after that the rude behaviour of the manager was really a mood spoiler followed by a messy serving by their professionals, the starters and main course are all put together on our plates while serving. The starters were really disappointing, drums of heaven were so dry and was a wastage to order.. 
Went there for the first time but it was a total disappointment.. and thus as per the proverb "the first impression is the last impression" u can imagine what impression we hold about that place...!!

Kolkata is all about food!! And well you really have to think a lot about which place to visit for lunch as there are hell lot of options for amazing food.

My cousin suggested to go for Tung Fong, situated at the prime location of Park street. The ambience was perfect for a family fine dine; and specially for Christmas they had made some beautiful decorations. I was so hungry that simply forgot to take pictures of the food items we tried üôà

Loved what we ordered, we went ahead with the recommendations given by the restaurant people. Quality and quantity both superb!

Things we tried:
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Tung Fong Fried Chicken ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê1/2
This was a chef recommendation, but didn't enjoy that much compared to the other dishes we tried. It's our basic chicken fingers, well crisped but quite bland.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Chilli garlic pepper chicken ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Loved it. Tangy, spicy, lots of chillies, amazingly tasty! Recommended

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Hakka chilli fish ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê1/2 This Bhetki fish preparation was superb. Don't miss this out.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Non veg Cantonese chow ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Chow is not very popular in Mumbai, and this kind of chow definitely is not available in Mumbai. I just could not miss to try this out here, both chicken and prawns based chow super delicious, not spicy at all. Quite slurpy! Nice

Conclusion:
I really enjoyed the food here along with my parents. Will definitely recommend people to try this place out.

We visited your place on the 25th and we were really disappointed when your waiter told us that you use the same oil for frying veg and non veg starters.we even confirmed this from one of ur managers and even he confirmed the same.It was really disheartening for us as we are pure vegetarian and will not be visiting your place anymore after the information that was provided.Was coming to ur place since 2005 but it was really bitter end to the experience we had.

But the food was worth it. Everything was nice. The ambience, serving, etc. Undoubtedly, one of the best Chinese restaurants in Calcutta.

Tung Fond is a name that's iconic in the Park Street area especially. Known for great Oriental cuisine, we had gone here for a rather large gathering and availed the a la carte menu. Firstly, I'd like to add that the decor here is very calming and quite zen-like (until it gets crowded of course). The entryway is quite nicely done and the seats are very comfortable.¬†
Among the extensive list my favourites were the Butter Garlic Prawns, Four Treasure Soup and Kung Pao Chicken. The rice and noodle items I do not remember much, but I'd definitely like to go back again and this time enjoy a wider spectrum of food.

When you are someone's private santa, so it's your duty to fulfill her wish. Yesterday, 25th of december we dare to go to park street for having dinner. After we got down from metro station, the situation was far like durga puja, so we have to take Mirza Galib street to reach park street. Since chinese was our favourite, we went to Tung fong. My goodness we have to wait for 45mins to get a seat for two. As Tung fong is the popular and legendary chinese restora, so we decided to stand in the queue. At last we got a seat, then ordered a beer and vodka, red pepper chili fish, egg fried rice & kung pao chicken. All the items were amazing in taste, quality was up to the mark, without a pocket pinch. The hospitality was very courteous and polite. The interiors were cosy & decors were perfect for christmas. Will be coming soon.

What better way to carve your hunger on a 25th eve, than on Tung Fong

Indeed the best place in Kolkata to have the best authentic Chinese food.¬†

Located just beside Mocabo, this place serves lip smacking Chinese dishes with authenticity at its best and the ambiance speaks for it self. This was the second time I visited this place, and I wasn't left unsatisfied at all.
The restaurant has a huge seating capacity of almost 200 approx at a time. This restaurant serves a huge variety of Chinese dishes & the buffet menu always steals the lime-light for the day.¬†
The ambiance is quite pleasant with helpful staffs, always ready to assist you whenever required. The decor of this place has a Mandarin touch to it, which is itself a very distinct feature about this magnificent & historic place.¬†

Items Ordered: Chilly Lemon Chicken, Mixed chow, Mixed rice & Lamb in chilly sauce
Alcohol Ordered: 3* Carlsberg 650ml (Complementary cheeselings are served with it)
Pocket Pinch: Rs.2740 (Including GST)

The Chilly Lemon Chicken & Lamb in chilly sauce was just too good to savour for the mouth. The lamb was not at all chewy, rather the tenderness of it, completely melted it in ones mouth. Both the mixed noodles and rice had good proportion of meat, prawn and egg, with each bite the taste got even better.¬†

As the this restaurant is a land mark among the foodies of Kolkata, the menu is a bit highly priced, but eating such good authentic Chinese food is always a pleasure for any foodie. 

Cost for two: Rs.1000 approx including Alcohol (Including GST)

Restaurants like Tung Fong are the real reason for the existence of Chinese cuisine in the city of joy!

On the day of Christmas when every other restaurant in park street had a waiting time of 1 hr+, we got chance to had lunch in Tung Fong within 30 min, though there was a long queue. Inspite of such rush, the service was quite well, we had enough time to spend a great lunch. The ambience was awesome, though I will prefer any kind of soft music from next time. Food was good, hot garlic pepper chiken was yummy and moist, mushroom was good, though soup was on the flat side. Noodle and sanghai fish was ok. The food that stole the show was schezwan fried rice, which was fantabulous. I am quite satisfied with the food and service.

I will give a thumbs up.

Amazing amazing food ‚úåÔ∏è Had ordered drums of heaven, chilli garlic pepper fish, and red pepper fish as starters. Kung pao chicken and prawn hakka noodles for maincourse. The drums of heaven were melt in the mouth and absolutely delightful! The prawns so fresh and fish so soft and tasty! The portions of the food served were plenty, even though we had ordered half portions and for 3 people (yes we were looking for variety). The service was quick considering it was a Saturday lunch time and polite. Just that our sitting area was not on the main floor but in an adjacent room. But the food more than made up for the lack of ambience. I would love to visit again just for the drums of heaven itself! ü§òüòÅ

One of the best Chinese I have come across in Park Street. Great quality and great service too. If you think Barbeque (Flavours Of China) is the best then you need to try this once as my barbeque experience was horrible which you can check in my review for it. Prices are great according to the area it's situated in. Had a great experience and you must visit TUNG FONG.

You see a lot of chinese cuisine in the city.But a few have the capacity to serve and reach up to a fantastic level with their food items.Tung fong is one of them.And honestly most of us generally prefer to go a resturant which serves good food with a reasonable price.This place is a perfect example of such kind.
Ambiance so so but as the food arrives you forget other things.We ordered Red pepper chicken,Veg Fried rice,Chicken in black bean sauce....All of them were amazing and also very indifferent in taste from one another.Because many chinese items in many places taste are similar in taste.And we took half plate for each items.So basically if you are to treat some people (more in number) on any occasion and expect good food at cheap rate.Tung fong is perfect. 
Thanks

Being a Chinese cuisine lover....this place was always there in my mind.
And last week I happened to visit this place to have a scrumptious lunch with my family.

#Service 4.5/5
Service was exceptional. Right from the manager to the staff...they were all well coordinated,fast and welcoming.

#Ambience
The place had royal but simple seating with a big round arch in the centre. The place was dimly lit which added the needful grace to the place.

#Food
To start off with we opted for 2 starters... The saucy and spicy Red pepper chicken and cridpy Garlic prawns. Both of them were amazing.
Then we ordered plain veg fried rice and chicken fried rice and along with them we tried their Kung Pao Chicken.
Kung Pao out here is awesome guyz. A must try!!
We ended our lunch with big heavenly glass of Tutti frooti.

My rating is based on one visit. Food was really good and cost me 400+ without alcohol. Loved the ambience and specifically the furniture. Reasons for downgrading my rating are one, a chicken dish had a little too much salt whereas the gravy mixed noodles was way too bland. Rest of the items from soup, starters, rice noodles and fried rice were awesome. The place was almost closing and we were the last people to leave. Need to try again.

The staffs were very friendly and attentive all time. Though the quality of noodles can still be improved, as it's a Chinese restaurant they must focus on that. All over everything was nice except for that part.

One of the best places in the city for starter diving... The golden fried prawns.. the wantons and last but not the least the best starter in the queue smoked lamb.. that is a must try. Overall a good place for family wine and dine.. main courses are sort of ok.. the lacking thing about this place is their alcoholic beverages.. beers etc which should definitely be a bit wider and should have better choices considering the standard of the restaurant.

I have been to this place many times. It is perfect for family dinner or a office party. Located just beside Marco Polo and easy to find. Ambience is pretty good with classic decor. Now coming to food it's pretty much basic. They have got all classic Chinese menu. I have tasted almost everything here and I like most crispy fried prawns. Other dishes are very much tasty and you won't get disappointed. The complementary salad is served with drinks that is an extra.

The city's on of the fine-dining chinese experiences.

Only glitch is that they do not serve pork.

The first thing that strikes you about the place is good ambience and cozy seating arrangements that sets the mood for good food. Disappointment is something that you leave outside once you enter the premises. The food is great. With so many big Chinese names cropping up around the corner, this old boy is way ahead in terms of food. From prawn cocktails to shezwan rice, noodles and caramel custard, anything you name, smell and taste will leave a lasting impression. A great place to gather with family will add to tummy memories.

We went there on Tuesday evening. It was nice Ambience..Interior decoration was also good and so as staff's behaviour..

Food: starter: we ordered tung fong fried chicken and chilli baby corn..The baby corn was so good that we ordered again half plate. 

Main course: we ordered one plate of egg rice noodles and tung fong chicken as side this..The quantity of noodles is sufficient for 2-3 people..

Desert:  we ordered brownie with ice cream and ice cream with hot chocolate..Hot chocolate syrup was not as hot..Both the dishes were good but not extraordinary..

 1 point is deducted due to non availability of darshan and overprice of dishes which I found.. overall it was a good experience.

Tung Fong is one the popular and legendary Chinese restaurant in park Street area since 2001.

Located at 5 mins walking distance from Mocambo.

Ambiance was fantastic with soothing decor, place was very huge and spacious and can accommodate 100 or more peoples at a time.

Drinks we had Coconoco Coconut which was a chocolate and coconut based drink, quite refreshing and good along with fresh lime soda.

Starters we tried Red Pepper Fish and Tung Fong Special Chilli Chicken, both were amazing in terms of taste and quality.

From Main course we had Mixed Garlic Hakka Noodles with Sichuan Lamb, noodles tasted good but lamb was a bit harder and chewy.

Service was amazingly fast and good.

I will visit again very soon.

Being an age old legacy the place has maintained its quality of food... however vegetarian options are limited but whatever they serve is lip smacking... Cantonese gravy is a must try

Very nice ambiance, quite good. Here we ordered chilly garlic pepper fish, shanghai chicken, red pepper chicken and mixed noodles and amongst coktails we ordered Carribean frost,Planters punch and Screw driver. I found screw driver better than others, though cocktails were nothing special it was kinda okay.

What to say the food is bang on taste and quality.
I got an opportunity to try the food from this restaurant on my kolkata visit. Really when I compared chinese cuisine what they serve in hyderabad from what they serve here it's beyond any comparison. Kolkata chinese food stand apart.
Coming on the food we order:
Jumbo Golden Fried prawn: It's was yummy. Will prawns properly cooked. No words to describe at all.
Chicken lollipop: It compliment the prawns and Jack Daniel's very well.
Masala Chicken Pan Fry: This dish disappointed me a bit. Didn't turned out the way I was expecting it to be frm the name of the dish. 
Mixed Hakka Noddles: Really divine on taste.
Kam-Pao Chicken: Had tasted Kam-Pao Chicken at so many restaurant but in comparison to taste this was best I had in recent times.

Value of money: 4/5
Service:4.5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Food:4.5/5

I have been to Tung Fong for three to four times. Points which i like most-
->The best part which i like about this restro is it is very spacious. It has got three tiers one at ground floor, one at up stairs and one at underground(opens during rush hours). 
->The second thing is food. Awesome taste and you will fall in love with the dishes. I ordered for Chicken Lung Fung Soup, Chilli Garlic Peper Prawn in starters and main dish Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Chilli Garlic Sauce(bit spicy). Lung Fung soup was too good, yummy. Chilli Garlic Pepper Prawn was mouth watering and after eating one plate i could not resist my self, I orders for another one. About main dish Fried rice was perfect in taste and also well cooked. The side was bit spicy but good in taste.
->The behaviour of the waiter was too courteous and they were well behaved. 

Overall good experience will visit again.

From food perspective I would have given 3.5. The food here is though noting wow but is good. But what put me off is the management policy, there is separate seating area for gents which means if you there is no lady in your group you will be seating in a partitioned corner on the 1st floor. This discrimination is simply not acceptable. Secondly the ambience of the gents seating area is pathetic, you won‚Äôt feel like going into a premium dinning place. While the family seating area is very lavishly arranged n have fantastic decor the gents seating area feels like 2nd class arrangement.

This Chinese restaurant is one of the many restaurants in the park street area, but unlike other Chinese restaurants, this brings something more to the table. The restaurant is huge with enough seating arrangements. Its dimly lit inside to give you a candle-light like ambience. The decor is simple yet beautiful. The staff was well mannered and showed us to our table. Then our server for the afternoon greeted us with the menu from which, we tried out the mixed fried rice followed by a half plate of honey chicken. It took them about 10 mins to bring us our food. A single course of fried rice was enough for the two of us and the honey chicken was so soft! We were famished so we dug in immediately. A small warning though, the gravy of the honey chicken tends to get stuck on your teeth if you leave it in your plate for too long to cool down. Its manageable though. After that, we decided to try out their crispy chili prawn. The waiter brought our food almost immediately (took them maybe 5 mins). The prawn was well cooked and fresh chili pieces were added to provide the spicy flavor instead of adding any spices directly in it. That way, someone can avoid the chilis if they want to. All in all, the food was excellent and well cooked. The fun part here is, the price to food/experience ratio is great. If you're looking for a restaurant to bring your date or spouse to but youl don't wanna shell out too much and yet have a fine dine experience, definitely consider this place in your top five. Do check this place out if you haven't already. You won't regret it.

Been a regular at Park Street restaurants but never tried this one until this Durga Puja. I was amazed with the value for money food here. The best part is if you go in large groups you would do more profit. Every full plate comes in 12 pieces and tastes awesome. We ordered Drums of Heaven and Chilli Garlic pepper chicken in starters, Sweet and Sour and Kung pao chicken and Mixed Noodles in main course. We were very happy to see the final bill after such a sumptuous dinner.

Once on a Saturday night, When all of the restaurants in park street had hours of waiting list, we decided to try our luck at already one of our favorite places, Tung Fong. I would suggest you do the same, try your luck at this place if you do not want to wait outside mocambo or barbecue & you will be pleasantly surprised with this place.
This restaurant is spacious and quite spread out. It's clean and neat. It's one of the older restaurants of park street but a surprisingly lesser known or popular one for no apparent reason. It's got all the elements of a very popular place, but I realized that the owners prefer it this way.
The food is very good. I've come to this place a number of times with friends and with family. The service is good. The quantity is good. I've always had a good time here. 
I suggest you try this place, you will not be disappointed. Don't let the availability of table in peak hours and days, fool you.

Absolutely disgraceful management etiquette. I was awaiting the arrival of 2 friends which I had clearly stated at the outset. They gave me a table. Five minutes later they ask me to leave the table for one person in the lobby. This is me despite telling them that my friends had arrived at the metro station and it would take them roughly five to seven minutes to arrive. Not only is this non sensical from a customer relations point of view but downright stupid from a pure revenue perspective as well. I had frequented this place a fair few times prior to this. A mistake which I am not about to repeat. For those who cherish manners of the staff as a valuable aspect of the dining experience, you would be well served looking elsewhere to sate your cullinary cravings.

A sudden plan was made, and I, along with two of family members, ended up at Tung Fong! It's located at park street, beside Mocambo. 
The ambience is very soothing. The lights are not too bright, but not very dim as well. They have got great seating arrangements! 
We ordered a chicken item, name I don't remember, and fish mandarin. Each had 12 pieces. Filling enough for 3 people. The taste was good. 
Then we had chicken sweet corn soup! One of the best I have had till date! The chicken pieces are there in abundance and they're big. 
Then we had mixed hakka noodles! The best of all. The noodles were thick but not for once, I felt like they were. It just blended so well with the chicken, egg and prawn and veggies. 
The service was quick. And staff are very courteous and helpful!

Once again amazed by the service and the food from Kolkata's one of the most finest Chinese restaurants in the park street area. I went there for the third time during the pujas this year with some friends for lunch. We had garlic prawn,  chilli garlic pepper fish,  chicken drumsticks for starters.  For main course we ordered some traditional chinese rice and rice noodles alongside some chicken side dishes. We really enjoyed the meal, I would love to come back again and again to Tung Fong.

My all time favorite, this restaurant is very close to my heart. The ambience is just perfect for any occasion, be it a date or a family dinner. I have many favorites here especially the prawn gold coins and mixed meifoon. The hot garlic prawn is also a must try. The Kung pao lamb is moderate. The only con of this place is that the service can be better. The waiters are sometimes rude and not efficient.

Been here a couple of times. Last time I visited this place with my parents. Food was decent and love the ambience which is perfect for a nice quiet dinner. I had ordered a chicken dish for main course and I had specifically requested to make it spicy, but when we tasted it, it was pretty bland. I didn't expect this from such a popular restaurant situated at a prime location like parkstreet. Rest all. Items tasted really good,especially the fish starter. The five spice chicken here, is one of my favorite.

Red Pepper Chicken Dry(10/10): As the name suggests, it's not for those who can't tolerate spiciness. But whether it's red or green, they're awesome! A must try!

On shaptami with two of my friends I went to have dinner here. I loved how the ambience of this restaurant is. Spacious, neat and well lit. Coming to the food all the dishes tasted really good. We had ordered one full red pepper chicken (12pcs) for starter. It was hot and spicy and tangy. YUM! For the main course we had two plates of mixed fried rice and half plate of chilli fish (6pcs). Both the dishes complemented each other and by the end our tummies were full so didn't opt for ordering anything else.

The experience over there was really good and the staffs were courteous. Pocket pinch is on the higher side. We had spent a nice time there.

Saptami dinner 2017 took us to this place again. This one is my favorite chinese restaurant in town. Being Park Street and puja time it was definitely over crowded and being a large group we had to wait for long. But it was the worth the wait when the food arrived.
Prompt service, staff is helpful and courteous.
Coming to the food we ordered red pepper chicken and drums of heaven. For main course we took chicken schezwan and plain chickenrice noodles , chicken fried rice and for side dishes had sanghai, chicken, Thai garlic chicken and shezwan chicken. All the side dishes, starters and rice noodles were heavenly. 
Usually in most of the restaurants during puja time the quality drops but here they always maintain their fav quality. Yes! I will come here again and again.

Groups consisting of only men aren't allowed in during the Durga Pujas.

The 'MAN' manning the door puts of a pretty bad behavior when a group of 8 men (none of them a bane to the society in any forms), asks to be put on the waiting list for entry.

No point in visiting such a place so that they can fuel on their sexism.

'Tung Fong' is one of the legendary restaurants when it comes to Chinese food. It is located in Park Street,just beside Mocambo. We went here yesterday at around 12.30 p.m for our Shasthi lunch.

AMBIENCE- The ambience of this restaurant was truly amazing. The decor, the lighting ,the perfect air conditioning can soothe anyone's mind before the meal. 

FOOD - We ordered 2 chicken fried rices, one chicken hakka noodles and one chilli garlic chicken.  The rice tasted great though not so different form some other chinese eateries. The Chicken hakka noodle was delicious.  The Chilli garlic chicken was hot and delicious and went well with the dishes. The Chicken pieces were nearly batterless,juicy,soft and delicious. It enticed our tastebuds.

STAFF - The staff was extremely well-behaved and did not have the usual snobbish nature of other Park Street eateries.

VERDICT - A grand dining affair awaits you here. I will definitely visit again.

Authentic Chinese Experience

Ambience: Located on the lane of Mocambo and Ontrack, this is undoubtedly the best Chinese restaurant in the Park Street area. Once you enter the premises, the spacious restaurant just makes you gape in awe at the sheer grandeur of the place. With the paintings and frescos on the wall, to the beautiful bone China vases, to the dragons sculpted on the pillar tops, the entire place just makes the Chinese essence obvious at every steps. The roof centre is a particular attractive aspect of the restaurant. Tables are arranged in twos, fours , sixes and even eights. The staffs offer you the seat according to your requirement.

Food: We ordered a Mixed Schezwan noodles and a Honey Chicken. The taste was pretty good. Particularly the honey chicken left a lasting impression on our taste buds. Well cooked food and was of sufficient quantity to fill our appetite. 

Service: The staffs are very very courteous. They look in to every tiny needs of yours and solve them without any kind of hesitation. Such well behaved staffs really add to the glamour of the place. Considering the foosd we had, the bill that came was pretty low in cost. So the pocket pinch was really small. Considering the way the place is maintained, we expected a much higher bill actually... :P Cash and card were accepted. Parking available for 2 wheelers in front of the restaurant. 

Overall: Recommended for any true chinese lover in Kolkata.

Visited the place after quite a long time. But the feel is still the same. Tried Smoked Lamb and Red Chilli Fish. Must say the fish was good and the lamb was heaven. After long had such soft and tender lamb. In the main course tried mixed rice and rice noodles along with 
Lamb and Shanghai Fish. It was good but loved the rice noodles more than the rest. Very pocket friendly too.

This is one of the signature restaurants of kolkata. Though it went through a bad reputation few months back, its service hasn't dropped. Cost is  a bit on the higher side. But one visit is a must.

A great evening with delicious chinese recipes.RED PEPPER CHICKEN & CHILLI GARLIC PEPPER CHICKEN as starters..chilli garlic was my choice but they recommend us that red pepper chicken,a great dish.As mains we ordered MIXED MANCHURIAN NOODLES and SANGHAI LAMB....also their recommendation.. Noodles was good but that lamb dish was not up to the mark infact the mutton was hard, chewing gum type..after eating the best quality chicken,soft and juicy...that lamb was very much bad,but the gravy was very tasty..service was good with great atmosphere and comfortable seating arrangement..

One of my best friends from college days was back from Milan for a week. Rainy season restricted my urge to treat him somewhere better (more expensive), although this wasn't all that bad.

First thing, the place is quite spacious. Mocambo, just next door, has slightly better food, but when the rush is big, you can get a little too close to other diners.

But here, they have resisted the greed of adding a few more tables and kept the floor spacious.

Prawn Wantons for starters. I had promised myself to lose a couple of pounds but there you go. Friend was back. Had to compromise.

Mixed fried rice with Shanghai Chicken and Mandarin Fish for mains. Taste was good, better than some other Park Street restaurants. Quantity was ample. Had a hard time finishing everything, the both of us. All this cost us just over a thousand rupees. Cheap considering the location, quality and service. Impressed!!

The restaurant being in my office area, I have been there quite a few times. The decor is quite good and the Chinese food tastes really good. One of my favourites from the restaurant would definitely be the red pepper fish which I am sure to order everytime I go even though it is on the spicier side. Their special yang chu fried rice and tung fong chilli chicken are definitely worth a mention. Good portion sizes also make it a good eating experience.

No complaints regarding the service and amicability. The food is quite delicious and the quantity had been sufficient for two. Based on the price, the ambience and taking everything into account, it's a must visit place in Kolkata. The service of food had been a tad slow.

Ordered red pepper chicken which tasted awesome. Main course consisted of chicken rice, chicken noodles,szechwan chicken and kung pao fish.Loved all the dishes. 
Service would have been a little bit better.

Food here is delicious! One of the best chinese restaurants of the city! We ordered red pepper chicken as the starter. For main course, we ordered kung pao fish,schezwan chicken, chicken fried rice,chicken garlic noodles. Red pepper chicken was the best of all. Kungpao fish also deserves appreciation.
Decor was good,beautiful infact. Service was pretty good in the beginning. But later ,after 3.30 pm,they were in a hurry to vacate the restaurant. They didn't even provide us with mouth refreshner at the end of the meal. 1 point deducted for their bad service after 3.30 pm.

This place is typical Chinese. I loved the ambience- furniture,Crockery, paintings, porcelain vases, buddhas and dragons of china just made the ambience worth it.

Food: 3.5/5
Content of food per serving: 2/5
Ambience: 5/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Service: 2/5

We tried the Tum Yum soup (non-veg). The menu is very well designed. They have priced it in 2-3 terms. Full (serves 4) half (serves 2) and small (serves 1).
We ordered the chilli fish and schezwan chicken. We found all the portions were less. So we (3) ordered a full Hakka noodles but this came in good quantity that we left a little behind.

In drinks we tried the pina cola and the Hawaiian blue  both having a vodka base. Pina cola is a must have drink at this place.

The service was not upto the mark. We went to the restaurant around 2. The waiters were hurrying us up so they can leave. The cutlery was not arranged properly and for some of us a few basic cutlery was missing. The waiter serves as if he is a robot and he has his proportions to serve and wouldn't stop even if I asked him to.

Overall this restaurant is worth visiting for authentic Chinese once in a while.

The taste of the food is 100% as delicious as that of Beijing.
The only complain that I have with this place is that the quantity given is far too less compared to that of Beijing.

Nothing exceptional about this place. Ordinary ambiance, ordinary food and slow service. We visited this place last weekend had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table. We ordered Chinese - Hakka Chilli Fish and Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken for starters, Mixed noodles and Kung Pao Chicken for the mains. The starters were okay however the main course was very oily and tasteless.

They really need to work hard to keep up with the competition.

There are some restaurants which quench ur appetite, are perfectly pocket-friendly and have well behaved satisfactory staff as well but as u leave the place with ur hunger all satisfied... U fail to experience a wow factor... Tung Fong was that restaurant for me... The quality of the food varied and was not consistently good.
For starters, we had chilli pepper garlic chicken and drums of heaven... Both the items were good enough... If I were to recommend, I wud definitely favour the drums of heaven... They were crisp on the outside and yet juicy on the inside... Just everything that u cud possibly want from a chicken drumstick...
As for the mains... They impressed the most in the entire meal... Ordered chicken hakka noodles and shanghai chicken... The noodles were perfectly cooked and there is absolutely no complaint whatsoever regarding that... The shanghai chicken is the one reason that I cud not drop my rating below 4 as it was one of the best chinese sides I have ever had... I wud veritably recommend shanghai chicken and I wud specially thank the waiter attending to us since he was the one who came up with the brilliant recommendation.
The dessert was expected to be good after a hearty main course but as I pointed out earlier, the food lacks consistency in taste... We had caramel custard which tasted bland and was the real downer of the day... It lacked the balance between the bitterness of the caramel and the sweetness of the custard...
On the other hand, the staff was utterly helpful and courteous whereas the pocket pinch is perfectly reasonable... That's all for tung fong‚ò∫

We took red pepper chicken 
Which was good and most importantly the sause
I liked it totally.
Then in mains we went for schewan rice noodles and chili garlic chicken
Chiken preparation was horrible enough for me to order some desert 
I called the waiter and ordered caramel custerd
Same drama repeated
Chocolate castard hated it

Am from Mumbai  and had visited my hometown kolkata last month and  visited the place last iin  May.
Was surprised they don't serve momos or Dumplings .it was Quite  a surprise for us.
Some of my family members were unwell after having the food . Earlier also it happened once.

Food quality was really good and cantonese chicken was just delicious. We also ordered Tung Fong special baby corn as starter and Maifoon noodles as main course. Maifoon was really appetizing.

At the end overall experience is good and want to have that Maifoon and Cantonese chicken again.

It was a sudden plan to hop in but I am just too happy to explain that it happened. Choosing Tung Fong over a few other restaurant options was a perfect decision. I liked the place the very moment we entered. The place is spacious and nicely decorated with minimalistic stuff. The wooden tables and chairs will impress you without fail. The crowd was decent. A perfect place for family lunch/dinner.

Now let's come to food. The food was beyond delicious. We ordered beer (Budweiser), Chilli Garlic Fish, Fortune Non-Veg Mixed Rice, and Kung Pao Lamb. Trust me, I haven't had such light and tasty Chinese food lately. The mushrooms in the fried rice just melted in the mouth! Do give it a visit. It's worth the steep prices of the food items.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life! :)

Pocket pinch: Rs. 1200 for two (approx.)

I have been ordering Chinese from Park Street restaurant. Since others were not taking orders I ordered with Tung Fong as I visit the restaurant quite often. First the quantity of the food delivered against my order was atleast 40% less than other restaurants like BarBQ and they gave a wrong item. Instead of a gravy chicken they have dry chicken. So one should be careful in ordering online with Tung Fong for quantity. Quality was ok

Just located 5 mins away from my house so I wanted to visit it for a long time so finally I was able to.
I don't know why Zomato has kept 1000 rupees for two people approx when in  reality it should be 800 rupees unless you order family size portion .
They serve half plate which contains 8 pieces which is enough for two people.
For starters we ordered red pepper chicken .
Excellent üòã
Main course was schezwan chicken noodles and chiii chicken gravy
Noodles were excellent again but the chilli chicken was among the very best I have ever had 
Top marks .
Will surely visit again !!

Went with family. Ambience was extremely good. Quite spacious. Ordered chicken drumsticks, mixed gravy noodles, mixed meifoon, fish mandarin and chicken in black bean sauce. Surprisingly both the gravies were almost same and tasteless. Portions were below average. Moreover the service wasn't at all good. Some cricket match was going on in the tv there and all the waiters were standing togeth @er and watching it instead of attending their customers. Had to call them twice or thrice for anything. Found this quite unprofessional. Found nothing to revisit.

Went there with my friend .First of all I would like to mention about the ambience and decor, it's beautiful ‚ù§.It feels like your in a Chinese ambience and dome shaped ceiling  üíô.The food was tasty. Red hot chilly pepper chicken is a must try . It's delicious.
Kung pao chicken is also a must try .If you are spicy food lover then try red hot chilly pepper chicken. The rice noodles was good.
This is definitely worth your money .
Definitely going back here!.

Went there with my gang. Decent Chinese food but costly. Had chicken gravy noodles with lamb and hot crispy prawn. I had a peg of Blenders Pride.
A perfect place for sophisticated dining. Service was really good........
Could have ordered more. But budget was limited

Among the better places for Chinese food on Park Street. Their buffet has quite a good spread. Food portions are generous. Why I don't go here when out with a guy friend is that they seat you upstairs in the bar section and not downstairs in the family section even if you're there only to eat food!

Decent chinese food and good ambience, a bit costly.

Always wanted to visit this famous restro in park street area and finally got the chance. Four of us went there on a sunday evening around 7pm. Large dining space, good ambience, well mannered staff and servicec was prompt. The place was jam packed within the next hour.

First we ordered two cocktails, one Moscow mule and one Blue Lagoon. Along with that one small chicken munchow soup, one small chicken mushroom clear soup and one large portion of tung fong fried chicken. Alcohol came with complementary cheeselings. Now both the cocktails were served in small wine glass and were kind of bland, not good at all. The soups were filled with tender chicken and mushroom but were very mild, even the munchow soup wasnt spicy at all. Tung fong fried chucken had 14 pieces of long fried chicken strips and tasted very good! Cocktails were rs 281 each, munchow soup was rs 131 and other soup was rs 119, starter was rs 422.

For main course we ordered veg chili garlic meifoon, non veg fortune rice and one large plate of chicken with vegetables in schezwan sauce. Portion of rice and noodles was barely enough for two. Side dish had small pieces of chicken and portion was less compared to price. Meifoon was rs 165, rice was rs 188 and the side was rs 393. Again the side dish was very mild flavour, although it was schezwan it wasnt spicy at all. Total bill came rs 2304. Overall the experience was good but food is nothing extra ordinary compared to price.

Yummiest Chinese in Kolkata! Tung Fong has been a childhood favourite. The quality of the food remains same. The ambience is very good and the service of this place is excellent. The staffs are always very helpful and cordial. You can order anything off the menu and I can guarantee you that you will not be disappointed. Food is simply DELICIOUS! If you are in Park Street and craving for Chinese then you should simply just walk into Tung Fong.

Visit this place for some lip smacking chinese along with great hospitality from their staff. There are very restaurants in the city where staffs are so well behaved and are courteous. Ambience is very peaceful, u can have a great dinner with your closed ones. Food quality and taste is also something to recommend. Would suggest to have Kung Pao Chicken which is one of there speciality. Overall it was a good experience.

Tung Fong was in my wish list for long and why not should it be ?! Afterall, it's distinct presence in the Chinese food scene of Kolkata since my father's college days made the name reverberate many a times during my family's food related discussions. It was out of this quest for accomplishment that I thought of trying out this place today's lunch.

So, we entered the place at 3.15 PM checking from Zomato that the place closes down at 4 PM. As soon as we entered the place, we were being escorted to a table where we settled down comfortably. 

We ordered the food all together as the Manager has requested us to do so. Following are the food we ordered and their feedback alongside :

1. Chicken Thai Soup - Thick and tasty. But the sourness was overpowering.

2. Drums of Heaven (Tossed in Sichuan sauce) - Chicken drumsticks were fresh and juicy. But again the sauce was dominantly sour.

3. Mixed Cantonese Noodles - Very bad. Even a small noodle joint would make a better Cantonese noodles. It lacked the basic salt and taste to say the least !

4. Kung Pao Fish - It was a dry dish and went well with a Cantonese noodle. However, I can very well challenge that the sauce is the same as that of the Drums of Heaven, as there was no difference in the taste.

5. Fresh Lime Soda (Sweet) - Nice ! The Kaafir lime added the tang to it !

Some basic observations - My wife and I was still having our food at 3.55 PM when the bill came down, as they were more concerned about closing the gates at 4 PM than giving us a decent customer experience.

Overall, the place needs a reality check as nostalgia may bring a customer till their gates but it won't make sure they take back a worthy experience !

This restaurant is located in one of the most restaurant covered area that is park street where you will find lot lf restaurants from Indian, conti to chinese, thai everythng.
Went there to meet my best friends after ages and ofcourse a big chinese cuisine fan starters are delicious but they make it very spicy and add soo much of green chilies which needs to be reduced main course and soups are delicious as expected.
They got two sides family and teenagers which is good for the one who needs privacy as they serve alcohol too.
If you are more thn 6 to 8 u will get a good table round where u can turn the centre marble for the convineance of others !! 
Service is very nice staffs are very professional !!

On a weekend date, this place by serving authentic Chinese food, made everything exemplary.
For some reason, I could only try the vegetarian items, and I had not even the slightest complaint.

Starters: Veg Lung Fung Soup

Main Course: Veg Sezchwan Fried Rice/ Veg Manchurian

Dessert: Vanilla Ice Cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce/ Fruit Salad with Ice Cream

Ambiance: Fairly spacious, attentive staff, pleasant decor.

This place was on my list for long. So finally visited here.

Ordered the following:
Smoked lamb
Chilli garlic pepper fish
Mixed non-veg rice
Kung pao chicken

I found the fish item very average, especially since I decided to order it from "What should you order" suggestions list. The smoked lamb just blew me away! It was yummmm! 5.5/5 for that! The rest were okay to good.

The ambience is very much Chinese. And I loved being there.

Hospitality was tricky. The AC was switched off‚Äã at 3.50 pm saying that 4pm was their closing time. Fine! But who turns out the AC 10 minutes earlier when the customers were already having their food? People seated beside our table literally got into an argument with an attendant.

A friend of mine had made glowing recommendations about this restaurant, so when I was in Kolkata this summer vacation, I took an oppotunity to visit it with my relatives.

The restaurant has a fine ambience with traditional Chinese decor and comfortable seating. ¬†For the starters, we ordered Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken, Drums of Heaven and Schezwan Prawns. All of these starters were perfectly prepared and were mouth watering delicious. For the mains, we had Kung Pao Chicken and Hot Garlic Fish with Mixed Meifoon and Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice. All the main course items were tasty and fulfilling.

The service was OK, though a tad slow. The prices were moderate, and came to roughly 2600 for four persons.

Here are my ratings regarding the restaurant
Ambience - 3.5/5
Food - 4/5
Service - 3.5/5
VFM - 3.5/5
Overall - 3.5/5

The restaurant is definitely worth a visit. It would be nice if the service is improved a bit.

So 4 of us went there and thoroughly had a blast...one of the best Chinese outlet in the city with a cool choice of hard drinks. We took beer to kill the summer heat along with masala chicken and other spicy chicken dish as starters. Moving over to the main course we took American chopsuey, mixed fried rice , mixed meifoon , kung pao chicken and chicken in assorted veggies. Quantity wise the side dishes had a lot of chicken....but the main course is just enough for one person obviously considering the fact that we were tremendously hungry. Overall the ambience was a real beauty and a perfect hangout for a lazy Saturday afternoon for the corporate people like us. A must visit.

A nice Chinese eatery which wasn't crowded on a Monday lunch time and served up  good Indie Chinese fare.We went for the typical Hakka noodles, fried rice and one side dish route and had no complaints. The fresh lime soda with which we quenched our thirst on this sultry day was somewhat less sweet for my liking. So I requested for sugar syrup which they provided immediately and poured into my drink to make it to my taste.The ambience was good as was the service.

We had mixed (chicken+shrimp) fried rice, pepper chilli prawns, chicken with babycorn and mushroom and in dessert, we had brownie with vanilla ice cream.

Food proportion was less in this restaurant. So, be sure before you place the order. Fried rice was light but it missed the chicken and shrimps in proportion. It seemed to be normal fried rice.
Pepper chili prawn was good in taste, but the prawns were overcooked and chewee. The quality compared to the price tag is very much disappointing.
Chicken with babycorn and mushroom was good. Chicken pieces were soft and the dish was full with mushrooms.
The brownie was delicious and the point fetching dish.

Decor was nice, staffs were humble. But the main attraction which is the Chinese food, was not at all charming.

Let me explain the lower rating given by me for this greatly popular restaurant of Park Street. I visited the restaurant on a public holiday. That was a mistake. And I do not recommend any one to visit a restaurant this size on a holiday. The service boys become all impatient. Service becomes slow. And also u won't get a decent table. Now let us come to the food. For the same reason quality degraded a lot. Chicken Lat me kai was nothing special. The lamb was an exception. It was very tender spicy and tasty. Mixed hakka Chow was good but the chilly garlic chicken was too salty. I'll definitely visit the place another time to give it a shot. But my first experience was not that cool. Cheers!!!!

We ordered half plate each of pepper chicken and prawn spring rolls for starters. For main course we ordered mixed Hakka chow,Manchurian mixed rice,and again half plate each of kung pao chicken,lemon chicken and mandarin fish. All the items were really tasty.

I went to tung fong with my school friends for Christmas lunch. We had ordered an item from each of the meat sections. Opted for half plate because we wanted to try most of the items . However none of the items stood out. The only thing I like about this place are their meat preparations in black bean sauce and fried prawns. The restaurant is handled very well and getting a table isn't all that difficult even during rush hours.

The waiting staff refused to take order after 3.20 pm. The food was little overpriced by its quantity and quality.. The ambiance was fine.. But overall‚Äã experience was really very bad will think twice before going there again.

The fried baby corn was mouth watering, it was of firm shape and the crisp brought an ecstatic feel in mouth along with lemon-ish taste.
Red pepper chicken was pretty good.
The Mixed hakka chow was delicious , the shredded pieces of mushrooms and prawns were bringing water in my mouth. All together it was a pleasant experience

The ambiance is nice and lively. Service is little on the slower side. They will greet you well but the serving is not upto mark. The waiters are little lethargic too. Food quality is pretty good and so is the quantity, but again the taste in some of the portions was bland. We even asked the waiter for their suggestions before ordering but still didn't like some of the dishes. Mambo Jambo in the mocktails was really soothing and nice. The starters Four Treasure Toufu and Hakka Chili Chicken were disappointing as they lacked taste and were bland. Mixed Schezwan Fried Rice had ample bit of shrimps and chicken and tasted good and was less oily too, nicely made! The Chili Garlic Lamb was good but was little more salty than what it should have been.

Huge interior with awesome decoration ,sumptuous meal and courteous staff - that's all about Tung-fong. Any prawn or lamb item is a must try.Their fiery items are really hot and spicy. So beware before ordering those items!!! I would love to be there any day any time.

Was there for a laid back week day lunch with a friend , the space is huge and the decorations , well exactly what one expects in a upscale Indo Chinese restaurant , no surprises and a load of mock Chinese and Raj infulence  . The service though prompt and friendly was quite old school , but that , I have discovered in Kolkata , is the norm . 

Menu was extensive , with all the usual listings .
The food , itself was the regular nice tasting but certainly Indo Chinese , was actually looking for some Kolkata Chinese  infulence , which were sadly lacking , nothing memorable or note worthy here .

A please enough meal in a classic old school setting , sure to repeat the experience if  I get a chance .

ENJOY

Quite often I visit the restaurants at the Parkstreet area but this one was left to visit till this Sunday afternoon. Well, today went there for the lunch. We did not need to wait for getting seats here, spacious place, peaceful environment.

Now coming to the Drinks: we ordered Beer and cocktail, but found the price was in little higher side than the other places of this kind.

Food: in the starter we ordered the Drums of Heaven, delicious this was, soft and tasty. Then in the main course we went for the Hakka Noodles and Sanghai Chicken . Both were upto the mark.

Desert: we tried Caramel Custard, good enough.

..... The thing I liked most about this place is their speed of their delivering foods.

Arguably the best fine dining Chinese Restaurant in Central Kolkata. The decor is great (avoid sitting upstairs) and roughly at the middle, the roof has been moulded like a dome and somehow the structure amplifies our voices (Notice it). Anyway the Chilli Garlic Prawns are a must have as a starter. The noodles surely give an authentic aroma and taste and go best with their Cashew Chicken. The ambience literally screams "Family time". Enjoy!!

This is one of the best place to have chinese food. I prefer it over mainland china and other chinese restaurant. Tung fong serve delicious food with authentic chinese flavor. The ambience is the icing on the cake, very spacious, courteous staff and peaceful ambience. Each time I visit Tung Fong I feel like to come back again. Try out their Thai garlic chicken and fish finger and u wont regret.

It is among 'The Great Chinese collection', and it really offers great Chinese food.
I went to have lunch with my mum as she loves Chinese, and Tung Fong really lived up to our expectations.
We had Chicken wantons as starter and took Pina Colada in drinks.
The cocktail was on point.
In main course we had Chicken Fired Rice and for sides we had a preparation of chicken and lamb each.
All the items were delicious and we had such good Chinese after a long time.
The only issue that we had was, we ordered one preparation of lamb and one of chicken but instead they brought us two preparations of chicken. So we had to wait a while for them to replace the dish.
If it wasnt for this blunder I would have easily rated 5/5.
Otherwise I really appreciate the food and will visit again some time soon.

This has been my one of my favorite Chinese places for a long time. The ambiance and service is excellent. The quality of food is beyond comparison.However, i was really disappointed in my last visit. I had ordered my favorite Chicken with Cashewnuts and they just forgot to add the cashew nuts! Not something one expects from a place like this.

It felt that they have gained quite an experience in Chinese cuisine over all the years.

Now a days we are getting controlled by two things - Rush hour and happy hour(very rare and only available in restaurants)!! Yesterday we decided to celebrate the Bengali New Year with some authentic Chinese food. So Tung Fong is one of common name that will come to your mind.
After long wait, we got the chance. 
Food was totally awesome. In starter we had butter fried chicken. Mocktail (mambo jambo)was also good.
In main course, we tried American chopsey, Fortune Rice and one chicken preparation. 
I would like to give 5 out of 5 for food.
Ambience is also nice. But only one thing is very disappointing, the behaviour of the staffs.
I have to ask for water atleast thrice, before they served it. May be they are too much puzzled or messed up due to rush hour. We have also asked about any special food item, but they are reluctant to guide us.
This kind of things is quite frustrating. Handling customers in rush hours is a tough job, but this is the important thing for any restaurant and my first experience with Tung Fong is not good regarding this.

But anyway I would like to visit there for one more time,with a hope for some better experience!!

I had been to this place a couple of times before. Of late I visited Tung Fong with friends for dinner on a Saturday. The ambience is very nice, but the service is a bit slow. Though the menu spread is pretty nice, almost all the food that we happened to try were high in cornflower content. The quantity of food was good, but it wasn't a very satisfactory experience overall.

Tung Fong is a well-known Chinese restaurant on Park Street. Its d√©cor is so 70‚Äôs-style clich√©, it could pass off as retro-chic these days. The food, an Indianized version of the Chinese food Calcutta is so famous for, is really good. Service is accommodating rather than friendly, and super-fast (just the way Chinese needs to be). Worth a visit. But bachelors and unaccompanied men be forewarned, you could be ushered upstairs to a small, claustrophobic dining room. Pah! I wouldn‚Äôt stand for it if I were you, the main dining room downstairs is so much better‚Ä¶

Waste NOT. Want NOT.

The ambience is perfect, nice simple decor, spacious arrangements and a Chinese structure with a golden dome in the middle make everything perfect.... Staff are nice and attentive..... It was monday evening and we could easily get seats.... Food is excellent with top quality..... The starters are so good that we hardly had anything for main course..... Prawns, fish, chicken and lamb items were nice and well cooked with distinct tastes.... Caramel custard was perfect to end the dinner..... I Loved this place and will definitely visit it again.... And definitely not too much expensive.......

Came here on a Friday night. The service was just absolutely horrible. The waiters was lazy and tired. Their attitude towards all their customers were like just take it or leave it. The food was just rubbish. Their prices compared to other big established franchises is pretty high when compared but the quality of the food is just rubbish. The only person who even decided to make an effort was the manager but all the other waiters were just lazy. Sometimes I think people who write reviews for this restaurant are just people working in the restaurant. I mean if anybody were to follow the reviews and go to this restaurant, they would be in for a surprise.

This was my first visit to Tung Fong. Although there were many other eateries that I could have visited, I was told that this place was awesome. And it was so. As soon as you enter the restaurant, the familiar aroma of Chinese food engulfs your senses as you are cordially taken to a suitable table by the waiting staff. The menu is not too elaborate and it is easier to seek help with ordering the meals. The food arrives pretty quickly and tastes amazing. We were 12 of us and ordered a variety of starters viz. Prawn pakoda, fish finger, drums of heaven etc. For main course we ordered lamb in black bean sauce along with schezwan chicken. Both the main courses were exquisite and the mixed mei foon went quite well with the dishes. Overall a must visit if you are in the vicinity of park street.

Well one of the most renowned restaurants in Kolkata. Classy ambience, spacious. Those dim lights, huge dome gives a premium feeling.
Staffs were really courteous and even they suggested us their specialities. We were 7people in total.
Ok now for the foods we had
*MIXED FRIED RICE- Really tasty. The rice is filled with sumptous egg and chicken. But the portion was not that much in accordance with other restaurants in park street. (3plate)
*MIXED GARLIC RICE- Another worthy one. Garlic flavoured rice filled with eggs and shredded chicken.(1 plate)
*MIXED MANCHURIAN RICE- Again a sixer. Spicy mixed rice which is really delicious. (1 plate)

For the sides ordered
*LEMON GINGER FISH- Soft tender fish fillets served in tangy gingery flavoured gravy. One of the best fish preparation i had. (Full plate - 12 pieces)
*CHILLY GARLIC CHICKEN- 12 chunky pieces of chicken served in chilly garlic gravy. The meat was soft and tender. (Full plate - 12 pieces)
*MUTTON IN CHOISE SAUCE- Shredded pieces of mutton served with tangy chilly flavoured sauce. This was the showstopper. Loved it. Must have.

Our total bill was Rs 2992. Really reasonable in accordance with the quality served.

So basically each and everything of Tung Fung is mention worthy. The ambience, the foods is definitely a must visit for chinese food lovers. Highly recommended, will visit again ‚úå

We were visitors in Kolkata and walked in here for a meal after just completing a rather successful book reading function.........needless to say we were in a mood to celebrate.

The ebullience of the mind will always find succor in the Bacchus and so it is that we started with whisky and assorted cocktails and had some fantastic starters¬† - chilli garlic pepper fish & golden fried prawns & Chilli garlic potato. We followed through with mixed non veg manchurian fried rice and helpings of the Fish in Oyster Sauce & Chilly chicken.

It was great food and at great value as only kolkata can offer, nowhere else in the country can you find such good quality food served in great ambiance and in the heart of the city with such aplomb and at such a price....i would be happy to be proved wrong on this. 

The restaurant interiors are done in the grand old¬† style with high ceilings and huge golden chinese lettering on the walls. The walls are interspersed with golden coloured ribbons and chinese characters with bold dashes of red across whitewashed walls to stunning effects. There are golden dragons on huge pillars and we most definitely feel we are in the presence of chinese nobility in one of their great halls. 

This is a great place and you just cannot go wrong if a good meal or a grand celebration or both are in the offing.¬† Xi√®xi√® t≈çngfƒÅng !!!

Just walking down Park Street and when suddenly our taste buds wanted to sink our teeth in some authentic Chinese cuisine.

Chanced upon Tung Fong and was warmly welcomed by Rajesh.

Wow, loved the place straight away with the copper encrusted pillars and a huge dome adorning the Centre.

Everything in Tung Fong was worth ten looks, from the the d√©cor to the furniture to the ceiling. The Menu was explained with Rajesh expertly running us through the favourites.

Started with Chilly Garlic Pepper chicken which was perfect to commence our dinner.

Hakka Noodles accompanied with Garlic Chicken made our day.

The chicken pieces were tender infused with the pepper and garlic but not overpowering.

The night ended on a magical note when Rajesh brought us two mint looking tablets which we presumed were mouth freshners but then he gently poured water on them and then the tablets started to rise and lo behold we had wet wipes to cleanse our fingers.

We went for lunch on Sunday afternoon - it was my second visit after an outing with my office colleagues. I really like the food here , especially the starters. We ordered our usual rounds of beer and for starters we had the Tung Fong Fried Chicken which is absolutely divine. It's nothing like your usual fried chicken. More like well seasoned chicken fingers. Along with that Red Pepper Chicken. For the mains we ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken in Black Bean Sauce and Hot Garlic Fish. The fish was really fresh but I personally preferred chicken mains. For dessert we had the caramel custard and it wasn't good at all. It was hard and tasteless. But overall we liked the ambiance of the place as well as the food itself and will definitely visit again. It's not exorbitant and the meal along with two rounds of beer cost us around Rs 2000.¬†

My recommendation is definitely the fried chicken.

We really enjoyed every bit that we ordered....and the staff too was courteous and gave helpful suggestions for deciding over the dishes. The service was also on time. In starters we ordered for chicken dishes. One was chilli garlic pepper chicken and other one drumsticks... Both were excellent in look and taste as well. In the main course we had fried rice, noodles, and kung pao chicken. All the food preparations excelled. Though after the main course little space was left in our stomach still we ordered we ordered for brownie... And thank god we ordered otherwise we would have missed this one!!! üôÇ

Right next to the famous (infamous?) Mogambo is Tung Fong with its huge gate that you just can't miss. Four of us visited it on Saturday afternoon at 2pm and we immediately got a seat there.
For starters, we ordered
1. Hot Chilli Fish
2. Chilli Garlic Chicken
Both the dishes had twelve pieces each that were sufficient for us. On the table, there were three dips, one reddish in colour and one green. It is highly recommended that you use those dips when you are having the starters as they increase the flavors a lot more. The fish and the chicken both were good in taste and soft. Great starters!
For main course we ordered,
1. Mixed Fried Rice
2. ¬†Garlic Fish
3. A chicken dish, the name of which I can't recall.
Once again, the side dishes had twelve pieces each and we enjoyed the food. The sauce of the fish item was very good.
For desserts, we ordered Hot Brownie but they said that it isn't available so we went with Caramel Custard and it tasted okay. The custard was a bit hard to my liking and I've had better Caramel Custards elsewhere so it was a bit let down with the brownie also not available.

Overall it was a nice visit and the ambiance is fantastic. It seemed like the waiters were hurrying us a bit but that can be neglected as the food makes up for it. Also, I don't understand why they don't have a menu uploaded here. Anyway, great place!

One of the most well known and highly rated restaurants in Park Street this place does not disappoint at all. Ambiance is good and the hall where this restaurant is housed is one of the largest I have visited. Coming to the food, quality is great. Prawns in Black Bean sauce were the pick of the lot and should definitely be tried. However one thing which disappointed me was that the place is supposed to be emptied at 4 PM and even if people have not completed their lunch they are expected to leave the place. All the waiters I found were very adamant regarding this, but fortunately I was not affected as i had finished my lunch just in time. Overall a place which must be tried

Tung Fong was surely placed at a premium level in our minds. But the experience at the restaurant yesterday truly upset us. We went with high expectations but we're clearly disappointed. The food which had a premium price tag to it did not at all feel premium to the taste buds. The quality was much of a lower standard than expected from a restaurant like Tung Fong. The quantity was very less and the pieces of chicken and fish were extremely small. But the service was commendable and the gentleman who served us was very courteous. The ambience has nothing that is complain about. But we hope that the next time we step in to Tung Fong, we will not return dissatisfied.

It was Ma and Baba's 36th Anniversary and definitely to celebrate their years of togetherness I offered my parents to choose the venue and after a long discussion, they settled for a place which they visited during their good ¬†ol' service days.So I booked a table for ¬†on a Sunday afternoon and as we entered the restaurant we were ushered to my favorite spot in Tung Fong!Right you are!We got our seats "under the dome".The place, as usual, was full and we could hear the occasional¬†peals of laughter from the satiated customers at tables nearby.The decor is plush, ¬†wooden chairs neatly arranged, white table¬†linen, yellow lights, and pretty woodwork!We ordered for Drums of Heaven and Prawn Wantons for starters along with Thai soup.Chicken Meifoon, Cantonese Rice, Mixed Fried Rice along with Chicken with Vegetables, Fish with Mushroom and Babycorn was ordered as the main course.Food arrived very fast(and I mean verrryyy fast).The wontons¬†looked and tasted great!The Drumsticks were crisp on the outside and soft and juicy inside.The Thai soup was delectable!(must try), but what I gorged upon was the Cantonese Rice- rice with a gravy topping of vegetables and meat!The meifoon¬†is a perennial favorite and not to mention the fish fillets dipped in a cornflour gravy with an ample helping of mushrooms and baby corns.We polished off our plates fast over memories and chilled glasses of lime soda.Service was excellent!Food tasted yummilicious!To top it up we ordered Darsaan¬†with ¬†Vanilla Icecream!Overall a ¬†regalement!

1. red pepper chicken and kung pao chicken were both good.
2. the cantonese mixed chowmein tasted good.
3. the john collins served to me was not cold which didnt make it as tasty.
4. the waiter asked whether he should add the tip amount with the original bill which is not quite a good behaviour and i am sad to say so.

Tung Fong is one of the most famous restaurants in the Park Street area.
They are very good at Chinese delicacies. So, if you are a Chinese food lover and in case, you are looking for some authentic Chinese, do visit this restaurant.¬†

Regarding the ambiance, you will have a Chinese environment to dine-in with well decorated dim lights.

Not very expensive, prices are pocket friendly for special dinners and the staff and the service are at their best.

Oh yes! I forgot to mention. they serve drinks as well. ENJOY !!!

So, here goes my rating for Tung Fong,
Food-4.5/5
Price- 4/5
Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

Went there on Valentine's Day so quite naturally the place was packed up. Thank god the seating area was spacious so we just had to wait for 20mins & we got our seats. Dimly lit, lovely ambience. 
For starters we ordered Chicken Drumsticks which was soft inside & crunchy outside. It was perfect, just like it should be. For main course we took Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken & Kung Pao Chicken. I absolutely loved their Kung Pao Chicken.
Service & Staff is good. Will definitely visit again. :)

If you love Chinese cuisine, Tung Fong can be a nice place to satiate your hunger and yet not burn a hole in your pocket. 
The seating area is large and nicely decorated. The staff and service is good. It is good for large groups too. 
The food is ok, but not that great. I have had better Chinese in Park Street. I found the food a little bland for my palette and not at par with it's competitors in the area.

Been here quite a few times.
Last night celebrated my parents' marriage anniversary here. The fish and chicken starters that we had ordered were really good and spicy. Prawns in mixed fried rice were quite big. Quality of rice was fine and quantity was sufficient too. Totally value for money. Just the caramel custard was not so good. It could be a lot better.
Place is quite spacious.

I went there after my friends recommended me to visit this place. And i hate them for this. I went to this place with 2 of my friends and had a veg buffet for lunch that costed me ‚Çπ500. To be frank that was the wastage of my money like throwing it away in a gutter. The food items on offer were stale and cold. I had to ask them to warm them up and everytime i asked them, they had an arrogant reply. Some of the items were good like the beerüòù. Overall would not recommend this place for veggies.

First of all this place has a huge area that is well decorated and posh. The dome, dim lighting just add to the charm. Superb ambiance. We were here for dinner and to our surprise the place was quite empty. Now about the food, plenty of options available. We ordered for chicken wanton soup,  tung Fong crispy chicken, mixed fried rice and garlic chicken . We also ordered two drinks.The food was fresh and served hot. But I expected a little spark from a restaurant of this repute. The staff was courteous and service is efficient. Overall its worth a visit.

This place is located adjacent to Mocambo on Park Street, I have heard many recommendations from my friends. I decided to try the place last evening.

The interiors is spacious and ambience is nice.
The menu has options for portion size so one can order large and small in terms of the number of people. This is a great option as one can try greater variety even if the number of people is less.

We ordered

Veg Talumein Soup : A mildly spiced thick noodle soup with veggies and lots of button mushrooms.
It's great to start the meal with.

Indonesian Potatoes : Potatoes crispy fried French fries style tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce with lots of garlic. I loved this one.

Fried Wonton : crispy perfect wontons, the filling could be better though both in terms of taste and quantity.

Chilly Garlic Chow: it was not as spicy as I had expected and the flavor of garlic was amazing

Fried Rice: The fried rice was very good

Baby corn Mushroom in Garlic Sauce : yummy fried pieces of perfectly cooked baby corn and mushroom in a tangy sweet garlic sauce.

Tutti frutti: is one thing I was slightly disappointed by both in portion size and taste.

Overall a great experience. I definitely enjoyed my meal with family. A great plus point being quick service. Will visit again. They end the meal by giving one a plate full of Candies.

Tung Fong is one of the best restaurants that serve delicious Chinese. Visited this place for lunch, and the place was bustling. Nevertheless, service was fast. ¬†Liked the interior a lot . Tested their buffet once it was good . Quantities are good for two and the food was overall tasty as it still maintained a different flavor from most Chinese I have tasted. So kudos for that !! Service was quick, courteous staff and patient as our order was last. May visit again!!

An excellent Chinese restaurant. If u hv a taste bud for Chinese food and yet don't want to spend a hefty amount for it , this will be your place of preference. 
Located on mirza galib street ( also known as free school street) this will come under pari street eateries because it's closer proximity to park street. 
One thing which will first strike you is that the tables are very widely spread unlike other  restaurants in the neighbourhood. The decorations and ambience will make u very comfortable. 

I love their chicken with cashew nuts , garlic pepper chicken and fish fingers. The soups are very tasty. The noodles and rice are very well cooked  and quantity is very good too.

Quality of food and staff service was good.
We ordered drums of haven in starters.Then we went on to order mix rice noodles.Both were really tasty.Then the staff suggested chicken cashew as side dish as I wanted something non spicy.This preparation was not up to mark.I would suggest that one should never order this.
Overall this place has a nice ambience and it offers good food.

Food - Having grown on Tung Fong food, you expect nothing but the best chinese when you go there after almost 5 years. With the same expectation we chose Tung Fong as our preferred lunch spot. For starters we wanted baby corn, and requested for something less spicy. The server, was kind enough to suggest salt pepper fried baby corn. our mouths were on fire!! With teary eyes we ordered for Chicken in black bean sauce and chicken fried rice. The Chicken in black bean sauce was tasteless, and only had a strong hint of dark soya sauce, the fried rice could have been from any road side stall.¬†
Extremely disappointed, felt let down by Tung Fong's food. Will not visit this restaurant again.

Had a wonderful dinner with the friends at the time of durgapuja in this amazing Chinese Restaurant in the heart of the city.A good option for Chinese Cuisine in Park Street. Surely, it ranks among the best in terms of taste, ambiance and service. The food was on the table surprisingly fast and the taste good
. The drums of heaven and wantons offered as starters are also quite good. A vast choice of menu and difficult to choose which one to go for but finally we choose kungpao chicken, chilli garlic fish and pan fried noodles. Foods were very good and quantity was satisfactory.

Only Calcutta still has those old-style restaurants which focus primarily on food and service, and everything else is peripheral. This is a great example of that. My family and I loved the food, particularly the prawns. It's the same menu that exists in thousands of "Chinese" restaurants across the country, yet each dish had flavours and portions that were unbelievably delicious. The service was super prompt and despite a heavy crowd, they had great throughput. All these new restauranteurs in Delhi & Bombay should come and take a few lessons here.

Coming to the food and price, well price is a bit heavy according to the quantity of the food. We ordered Mixed american chopsuey, spring chicken, fried rice, hakka noodles. Imo, Food was not that much great but yes the place is worth one visit.

Gist: Great food in a big restaurant, but try only with buffet whenever available otherwise way overpriced.

I visited this place on 3.6.16 around 1.00PM. Easy to locate. Big restaurant to accommodate around 60 people with a spacious washroom also. Very calm ambience. That time a buffet was available @INR 557 + tax, so ordered that. Buffet spread was great. Serving speed & behaviour of staffs needs to way better. Food tasted great whether it was noodles, a seafood item or chicken. Every items were delicious. Complimentary drinks and ice cream was given which was good but not great. But it is way overpriced if I had to try 2-3 items according to the menu.

Few days before we decided to go to Park Street.. Our first choice was Peter Cat.. but for long queue we decided to shift to Tung Fong.....

Location : Well known Restaurant.. so it does not need any introduction ... its just beside Mocambo....

Decor : Very well Decorated and Spacious Restaurant.... Very Well maintained... Just need to work with the wash room....

Food : There were like thousands of items.. But we decided to stick to the familiar ones... We ordered 1 Veg Chow, 1 Mix Hakka Chow, 1 Sezchwan Rice, 1 Chilli-Garlic Chicken, 1 Shanghai Fish¬†

Accidentally they also served us Garlic Chicken to us in place of Shanghai Fish... but later they changed it immediately when they noticed it.. but by that time we already consumed almost 50%...But they did not charge us for it....¬†

Veg chow was decent... Mix Hakka Chow was delicious.... We thought the sezchwan rice would be little spicy... but it was not so... Chilli Garlic Chicken was Good... Shanghai Fish was very tasty and spicy as we expected... and Non paid Garlic chicken was also very good and tasty too........¬†

Price : Before entering we thought its a very costly restaurant.... but delightfully it was very much affordable... all this costed around 1600/- only......

Service : Very good... one of the best service i have ever seen... very polite and decent and quick......

I went there for a friend's birthday treat. The location is a bit difficult to find and since I myself got lost, I cannot provide much assistance. 
The ambience is okay, but the drinking and dining area is the same so if people have apprehensions, don't take your children. Also, very dimly lit, which I don't find quite appealing. 
The food was good. We had some chicken drumsticks, dry chilli chicken, chicken fried rice, noodles and 2 side dishes, both chicken (I'm not quite clear on the items since they were pre ordered by the friend who was treating.) 
Service was prompt. But, the reason why I have rated it so low is that, if you're charging so much for the food, it needs to be extra ordinary which, frankly, it wasn't. It was good but not great. Kolkata has better Chinese joints where a tastier meal will come cheaper. I would go there as long as I'm not paying.

A chinese restuarant having an old world decor and ambience, very spacious (dining and bar separate) and tucked on road next to Park street next to Mocambo's with great prices and value for money defines Tung Fong where I came for a late dinner after KIFF 2016 and was served good food. Ordered butter fried chicken which was hot and buttery yum served with veggies and the best sweet chilly sauce i have tasted so far. Menu is well-customised for orders of a small or large group thus being cost-effective when in a large group. Ordered mixed fried rice and mixed hakka chow along with cantonese style chicken gravy to go with. Quantities are good for two and the food was overall tasty as it still maintained a different flavour from most chinese I have tasted. So kudos for that !! Service was quick, courteous staff and patient as our order was last. May visit again!!

I have been meaning to go there again for a long time. Finally visited a week back. First of all it's such a huge place. And the pagoda hall in the middle just completes the look. The servers were courteous but a little prompt for my liking , but can't blame them, we had entered at the closing time. The drumstick and chilli pepper fish was so good. The best drumsticks I have had in the fish and the fish tasted so good. Though my knowledge of fish is a little limited but the fish could have been a slight more tender. We had ordered a mixed rice and Hakka noodles  and kung Pao chicken. The rice and noodles were full of flavours with each spices penetrating the grains. Given the abundance of restaurants opening up in Kolkata and the thought of serving great food fills them with abhorrence, tung Fong clearly strives continuously in serving great food albeit at a price. But what really made my day was the kung Pao chicken. It was outrightly the best dish I had in a long time.  So if you are in the mood for Chinese and can shell quite a few bucks, come here and you won't be disappointed. And while you wait for your food you can clearly marvel at the well thought-out interior of this place. A must try.

The service is quite good here. The food is yummy too. The wontons,babycorn,chicken drumsticks are very good according to me. I like their noodles too,which aren't sticky at all.

There is a big tomb type structure centrally placed high up on the ceiling. It looks beautiful with bright yellow light shinning from above. 
The food is marvellous with a good quantity. I visited the place a couple of time's and i loved, each and every dish i had.

Tried their Cocktails & Veg starters...
'Moscow Mule' was quite authentic in taste but surprisingly they served the drink in wine glass instead of copper mug/glass, which is customary in this case...
'Tom Collins' was standard...
In starters - 'Onion Rings' were crisp & tasty & not so oily in spite of being deep fried...
'Fried Paneers' tasted good with Coriander Chutney, however 'Schezwan Button Mushrooms' was too tangy and the sourness added to it had gone over board...

Over all ambiance was good at downstairs meant for family, but first floor (meant for stags) lacked the warmth!!!

Stewards were grumpy & not very courteous, which goes against the customer centricity of any hospitality business...

Price v/s quantity wise servings were satisfactory.

The chinese restaurants at Park Street never fails to amaze you. 
A wonderful place this is!
Ambience is lovely, sophisticated.
Food is good too. I would prefer more of the quantity though.. 
Fried rice, Crispy chilli chicken, chicken Drumsticks should be the choice to be safe.
Meal for two: 1200 approx.

One of the oldest restaurants that serves authentic Chinese in Kolkata. Food is good. Service is bad. We had to wait for a long time just to order food.
The starters were better than the main course. Half of the Desserts were not available.

This 2 rating is for brilliant preparation of Chinese food. One of the best I have had. Ambience is also good but the table arrangement sucks. To top it off unapologetically unflinchingly extreemly rude and dumb staff. I would say the average IQ of them would be lesser than what is required to be a domestic help. 
There is a place in the restaurant they have dedicated for people who come as a couple. That place is just adjacent to the serving table, where water and condiments are kept. And its beside an arena of a separate section for people with more number of people. That arena is a notch higher and the people sitting in that arena is joined to the couple table. Extreemly uncomfortable place to sit. Now next logical step is to ask the manager for a replacement, provided the restaurant has free tables. Upon doing so the manager happily declined saying there might be more people coming in and if happens so how will I accommodate them. And this statement is coming when 50% of the restaurant was vacant. They just asked me to leave. I without saying a word did so. This is my experience with them. Otherwise have been in separate occasions with office colleagues and the treatment has been different.

Totally avoidable place. The food is far removed from anything Chinese. It only serves what Bengalis think is Chinese, which too is quite unpalatable. Doesn't offer pork - one wonders why if not to appease a certain underground section of the society. The waiters are extremely rustic & lacking in culture befitting a fine dining place which this outlet claims to be. YOU DESERVE A BETTER TIME. DON'T COME HERE.

It was my cousin sisters bday get-together. A biggi family affair :-D. We were 17 ppl . Went for dinner . The second u enter u will get all the vibes of being in a traditional Chinese restaurant with a perfect ambiance. Huge place with loads of sitting arrangement.
Staff are very polite and helpful.
Serving were spot-on .
Now coming to the food .
1. Sweet corn chicken soup : thumbs up
2. Butter fish : pieces of fish with butter sauted beans,carrot, French fries and tender fish perfectly buttery flavour !
3. Chicken lollypop : crispy coating, tender chicken, nicely sized drumsticks .
4: baby corn : perfectly crisped baby corn . Lovely .
5. Rice noodle : I have had rice noodle at places never found it tasty so given a choice I would have avoided it . Even that day I was sceptical about it but when I tasted it real good. Not bland at all which remains my complain with rice noodle normally
It was real nicely done .
6. Fried rice : gud
7. Chilly garlic fish : the garlic flavour was nicely infused but somehow fish was too soft . It needed a bit of crunch. Not that impressive.
8. Kung pao chicken : it's one of their very popular dish and it's bang on . The sweetness with the @ shejwan sauce filled with cashew and fried chicken tossed in it. It's perfect. I anyway love this version of Kung pao rather than the gravy one which is another variant . Actually till now I have had three distinct variant flavour wise of Kung pao at diff places. It is best here !
9. Vanila with warm darsan : üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
A lovely evening with my family and awsome food.

Nice ambience and located beside the now infamous Mocambo restaurant. Great place for families and friends alike. Prices are cheap by Park Street standard, and a bit higher than Chinatown.Surely worth a visit.

This place is not for you if you are in a hurry and want to grab a quick dinner.  Because from evenings till night you might have to stand in a Q for at least 20 mins. Totally pocket-friendly menu. 
And if you are looking at my review, keep your phone down and leave immediately, you might get inside in 5 mins ;)

Like other restaurants of park street this restaurant's staff also have attitude problem. We asked for some suggestions in vegetarian items and the guy was like check the menu and order whatever is available will be served.  Then we asked about some dishes like how it wud be made or how it is in taste then again he got hurt i guess and did not bothered to review. Finally we ordered some dishes. The service is quick. Food is ok not so so great in taste and quality found it average. The place is huge though. I wud not recommend. totally worthless, because i feel that one should serve food with a smile and attend customers with positive gesture.

Good place. Surely worth a visit if you're a fan of Chinese food. 
I have been here a couple of times, the first time being farewell party of our college seniors. We were a large group of around fifty students, the treat being given by some five-six seniors. We were seated in tables in groups without disturbing the furniture arrangement and given a per head budget. The order and everything was organised very well.
As for the food and the ambience, this place is surely worth a visit.

Nabami night it was, and a date, and Chinese was on our cards and this one looked yummy with the decor. The last day of the pujas meant that the rush would be huge and we were no exception. We waited for a solid ¬†45 minutes before we were guided to the upper floors for a seat of two.

We started off with a couple of beers as we had a lot of catching up to do. They served cheese-lings which was like bonus.

We started off with the red pepper chicken and the chili chicken dry and we asked for a little customization and were offered with a warm smile.

The red pepper chicken was perfectly hot and the pieces were very well prepared and we had no qualms.

You an judge a Chinese outlet by the taste of their chili chicken and its one of the very few Chinese joints in the city that provided me with such authentic flavors. A special mention to the chef for such an amazing preparation

For the main course we went for the mixed fried rice and a recommendation of kung pao chicken which was their specialty. The taste still lingers on my mouth. Even amidst so much of a rush, they were warm and always had a smile and always apologized for the delay or any fault of theirs

We decided to give this place another try and our opinion remains the same.. There is no match between the price and the food quality or quantity.. We ordered mixed gravy noodles, mixed fried rice, garlic fish and chilli garlic pepper chicken.. The food was below average.. and the service was even worse... The plates that we were given at first had a pungent odour.. Please try to avoid this place if u dont want to spend a lot of money on bad food..

Someone once raved about the magnificently spacious and lovely interiors of Tung Fong. I like the space. I like the very comfortable and stylish furniture. I like the impact made by the artefacts. Unfortunately, I cannot eat them. 
I prefer its sister concerns in Tangra. Sorry management! But Beijing restaurant and Kim Ling serves some of the best, yummiest Chinese, from the soups to the side dishes. 
I loved the food in Tung Fong initially when there used to be a chef called Michael Mya. I could have easily given a rating of 4.5 then. 
One thing that the sister concerns don't have is the black forest sundae and toffee walnut dessert. And of course, the feeling of space. It is a nice, central place for meeting up friends and family. But, as I said earlier, there is much room for improvement in the cooking.

Tung Fong... One of the Legendary restaurants in kolkata in the heart of the city of foodies (Park street)...
This Chinese Cuisine was in my wishlist for a long time and finally had the opportunity to visit it on "Mahasaptami" (08.10.2016).. This place serves the most Authentic Chinese Cuisine in the town.. 

Location :- Easily accessible.. just beside Mocambo.. 

Ambience :- You will feel like dining in China... :-D under the dome with low lights... The seating arrangements were perfect with a lot of space to accommodate people.... 

Food :- 1) First started of with one of their signature starters the " Drums of Heaven"... It was lipsmacking.. The best drums of heaven I have had after BARBQ

2 ) Then we ordered their Mixed Fried Rice.. The quantity was really impressive.. I guess it will be sufficient for two... The rice was very tasty with good portion of prawns.. chicken and eggs... Must try... :-)

3) Kung Pao Chicken :- Another signature dish of Tung Fong... I have tried this dish before at Chili wok and I personally liked the dish over there... :-/ It was good but something was missing... :-p

4) Chilli Chicken :- One of the most common Chinese dish.. It was very tasty and had a different flavour which was very good..  

Service  was good... They were prompt in their service... :-)

OVERALL liked the place... A great Chinese joint...

 Pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side as the price differs from that of the given Menu In Zomato... :-)

The food was not authentic chinese. One of the worst chinese food i have had. Ambience was good. The waiters are rude. I had asked for spicy chicken. He brought something that was so sour, that we could not eat anything and had to order for an alternative. He just kept staring. The portions are also very small. While paying the bill, the waiters kept staring at me. I did not understand why. But while leaving i saw them giving me faces and murmuring to each other about us not giving tips and saying to each other: I told you they wont give tips. This is the condition of highly rated restaurants in Kolkata. Even after ruining our lunch they are expecting tips. And had the audacity to make such snide remarks behind our back. 
Suggestions to management: Taste of the food  can be given a 3.5. But if you keep such people with begging attitude as waiters, you will lose customers.  Please train or change your staff.

One of the best place to have chinese in Park street area. Old heritage with its spacious sitting is a huge plus point. 
Food is delicious. Coming to food we ordered:-
Starters-¬† Golden fried prawn, red pepper chili garlic chicken, fish fingers. 
Main course - Chicken hakka noddles , mixed fried rice, chili garlic chicken and seafood combination. 
All of them are superb tasty.
Stuff are helpful and cordial.
Pocket pinch will be on higher side though.

Go to this place for Buffet Lunch and you will be amazed with such a well spread buffet menu. 
There is a different menu for each day of the week. 
The experience starts from your 
fresh lime or beer on the table, 
to soups and starters, 
to the chicken and fish menus and the cereal complimenting it and 
finally ending with fruits, ice cream and what not. 
It is best for Lunch Date for foodies. 
Dinner time Experience has also been great for me, but still the weekday lunch is best.

Tung Fong is undoubtedly one of the best Chinese restaurants in town. The ambience is great and the decor is lovely. With the dragons carved on the walls and the dome, it feels like you are really in China :D ¬†I had been there for a Family Dinner. We had ordered some Manchow Soup, Tung Fong dried chilli chicken, Red pepper fish and delicious prawn wantons for starters. The Blue hawaii mocktail was nicely done. For the main course we had an awesome Fish in oyster sauce with some good old mixed fried rice. The food was great. The staff was prompt and nice. Highly recommended.

The BEST place to have chinese food. I have been to this place quite a few times now both with family and with friends. Hands down this place serves some of the best chinese cuisine in town. The ambience of the place is also very refreshing. The tables are quite spread out and you never feel cramped even when the place is full. The service is excellent as well.

Food is good , ambience is nice but something which I found to be unusual was that they denied to serve food until the entire group was there .. we were sitting in the family section and were all males waiting for our female friends to join us when this happened and they refused to serve us..  although no complaints regarding service or food .. they serve a sweet chilli sauce or reduction which is very nice and goes really nice with starters.. cheese corn rolls, spring rolls, wantons it's good

Easily one of the best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. Dined out with my family on a couple of occasions. Loved the food - tasty and the quantity is also very good. We had both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes and my family loved it. It is not very expensive either. Tung Fong should be one of the primary destinations if one looks for good Chinese food in Kolkata.

Visited Tung Fong with Parents for dinner on a weekday. The food is excellent and serves delicious oriental cuisine.

We ordered a few starters, some main course and dessert.¬†

Ambience : Excellent. Try sitting under the dome if a seat is available.¬†

Service : Very good, individual attention given by waiters.¬†

Starters : Chicken Red Pepper is fantastic. Tangy and different. the red pepper flavour adds pungency.¬†
Prawn Chilli Garlic and Corn are good too.¬†

Main Course : Rice Noodles are well made, along with Shanghai Chicken.¬†

Dessert : Daarsaan with Ice Cream is very nice.¬†

A good dining experience!

Well after peiping gt closed forever it is the only good chinese joint in park street in my opinion.it offers good quality food n service is qt prompt to be honest.In festive seasons u will find a big que infront of it so be prepared for that.It is one of the most cleanest restaurants in town.

Try honey chicken,Cantonese rice,Hakka chowmein,Special chilli chicken with mushrooms.

Price is moderate.

Ps : Never tried buffet there bt heard its not that special.

Being situated in one of the happening places in kolkata it is a renowned restaurant but regret to say that we had a disappointing experience.  We went there directly after office with colleagues in a big group... Had to wait sometime to get d table though d restaurant was empty.. Anyways d food ordered was tasty but what was disappointing was d misbehavior of d staffs working there... They didn't served d water or food even n whole time were staring at us which was so irritating... Seeing der bad service, we decided not to give any tip and to our shock when we were leaving d place after completing our food, they passed comments n taunted for not giving any tip.. I wonder why should we give any tip to someone if there service is so poor..we really felt disgusted... My request is to d owner please take action against ur staffs bcz there poor service can lead this well named restaurant in a mess in near future. Sorry but I will never suggest anyone to go there.

Excellent Place for Chinese foods. One of my favorites. The smoked lamb is very good ¬†and exquisite. Also you can order buffet lunch with complimentary drinks. Since I have visited there many times, one shortfall which I noticed was the buffet menu dies not ¬†get changed.

Its one of the best Chinese family restaurants in kolkata. Situated on the prime location of Park Street. The ambience is well blended with the cuisine served here. 
We ordered: 
Chicken Hot and Sour Soup
Butter Fish Finger
Tung Fong Chilli Chicken
Tung Fong Fried Chicken
Mixed Gravy Noodles
Mixed Haka Noodles
Shanghai Chicken

The soup and the noodles were more than average or of standard quality... Everything was well cooked and the meat portions were of very generous amount.

Butter Fish Finger:- the fish was the of best quality bhetki one can serve. Fried in a light batter, it was a delish

Tung Fong Chilli Chicken was a chef special Chili chicken coupled with cashews, veggies and lot more.... Though it was a little spicy but it was refreshing for my taste buds.

After the spicy chili chicken, Tung Fong Fried Chicken acted as a palate cleanser.. The chicken was very crispy and it blended well with the pre-served  dips.

And last but not the least, Shanghai Chicken came into play, with the noodles. Tung Fong is famous for its Shanghai Chicken and I just keep falling in love with it, whenever I visit this place.

On addition, the staff was very polite and was kind enough.

For three of us, the bill was around 2500 inclusive of all taxes.

This restaurant was good and i used to go to this restaurant for a long time but yesterday they asked me for my id to prove that I'm 21 or not which i happily agreed to provide and on top of that i was with a lady who is also a working professional they asked for a id of her as well AS SHE WAS NOT LOOKING LIKE ONE as said by the staff which was really embarrassing even i said that she is a wprking professional and they can take my number and info for future reference.. They refused to provide just a breezer? That was really uncalled for.. So that means now under age guys and girls who looks like an adult they would happily serve alcohol and won't ask for their I. D's based on how they look.. I'm a food blogger and critic i dislike this attitude definitely u have rules to obide but make sure you guys are not overdoing it just for the sake of it.

The old heritage of Park Street when it comes for Chinese. 
Tung Fong is the name we know from many decades..The wooden furnitures and the stoned lions gives you a ancient chinese theme.
The much spacious accommodation is one it's plus points.
Coming to the food..
Every item has its distinct taste but I prefer having their signature dishes Kung Pao chicken,sweet and sour fish and their mixed fried rice.
More than sufficient quantity and tantalising taste.
In terms of beverages..hard drink are very well stocked.
Staffs are friendly and courteous.
And most of all pricing is very decent at a place like Park Street.

What to say and how to start? This place pleased me... As I expected... Nice and simple decorations and the dim lighting pattern is so attractive. Now coming to our menu... We took chilli garlic pepper chicken in starter. They were nicely cooked and so juicy and tender. We had special yang chi fried rice, chicken Manchurian fried rice, kung pao fish, shezwan chiken in main course. Every item was delicious. The proportions of chicken, lamb, prawn, corn in the special rice was perfect. I heard about the kung pao chicken but ordered their kung pao fish which was the best... In dessert we had fresh fruits with ice cream. I have an objection for that. Only two fruits!!!!??? Really??? They served ice cream with only pineapple and few papayas. It was embarrassing. Overall I am keeping this place top in my favourite Chinese restaurants. This place can be in your list also but for the first timers my message is- " think before you order, because they served 10ps chiken in half plate".... Hope to see this place again in few days...

Well when it comes about Chinese how can someone ignore Tung Fong, the famous Chinese restaurant in park street. But was not at all satisfied after been there. We have been there at 3 pm but the staffs were not at all willing to surf and it ws clearly visible in their attitude. They were busy on wrapping up the restaurant for the next shift. And their attitude was like "khana khatam paisa hazam" type. Quality of the food was good,there was no compromise on that. Whatever rating I am sharing this is only for the food. For the service I am rating 0.

This Sunday.. Finally visited the oh so famous Chinese place.. We were actually looking for momos but since The Blue Poppy was shut, we looked elsewhere.
This place generally has a queue for customers, I called up for reservations and I was told "sorry not until tomorrow "
Still we went to try our luck and voil√† we got a place.

Ambience: casual nothing very extraordinary.

Staff: cordial and pleasant

Food: we ordered for egg rice and paneer gravy along with crispy baby potato .
To be true, the food was average.
The potato was too sweet 
The rice was good
Again the paneer lacked that extra taste.
I guess this is more of a non veg place, they had very few veg options.
 Pocket pinch: decent and satisfying!!

Non veg people - do try this place!

It's another of those legendary places we have in the city. The dome looks beautiful. The decor is soothing and soft and totally in blend with the ambience. The place speaks of China. The waiters are very well trained. And please note, Tung Fong serves one of the best chilli garlic noodles in the city! So much so,they just leave you wanting for more. 
You will be very impressed by this hidden gem and that's a guarantee. 
I feel this place should be visited by food lovers so that they can try something other than the usual favourites like Mocambo or Peter Cat. It definitely deserves the recognition of a legendary restaurant in Park Street.  
Bon appetit!

We had smoked lamb in starter. It was spicy, sugary and yummy. In the main course we had mixed Haka noodles, chicken garlic fried rice, kung pao chicken and chicken schezwan. All of them were tasty. Kung Pao was made by red sauce whereas sezwan was dipped in black sauce. And the latter was more spicy. Overall, good food, good ambience. Thumbs Up.

This particular review contains my lunch experience and the food quantity per plate.

Service: its really good. At least I am pleased. You don't have to waste your time to get the attention of a waiter. And for a tasty food one needs to give the sufficient time to the chef.

Ambience: as I have lunch over there,that time it was really very less crowded. I really enjoyed the atmosphere.
Food: The main point; FOOD
Ordered :
Soup: four treasure soup
Starter: 1. Hakka chilli fish.
2. Smoked lamb.
3. chilli garlic pepper prawn.

Drink: 1. A pint of beer.
2. Chips(complementary).
3. Masala cola.

Main course: 1.prawn fried rice.
2. Mandarin fish.

Except the mandarin fish Each and every item is well prepared and was exceptionally delicious.but i really didn't like the mandarin fish at all.

Recommended: hakka chilli fish, smoked lamb.

Quantity: 1.a middle size soup bowl will be enough for two.
2.half plate (chicken or fish) starter or side dish: 6 pieces, full plate: 12 pieces.
3.half plate prawn starter or side dish: 5 pieces, full plate: 10 pieces
4. Half plate smoked lamb: 7 pieces.

Hope this information will help who are willing to go there.

Before reviewing this legendary restaurant, I would like to start by mentioning..."FINALLY THIS IS MY 100th REVIEW IN ZOMATO"..So happy..YAAY!!! üéâ üéá üéä üéÜ
.
Well, Tung Fong is one of the leading names in Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, administered by the same person as of Kim Ling, Beijing of China Town and Mandarin of S.Avenue... So here authenticity of the cuisine is well retained going by the name other big shots.
The interior looks luxurious with meticulous detailing and exact amount of lighting and that eye-catching false ceiling design (dome) with cove lights makes it look royal. Although the tavern is a well spacious one but occupancy is almost at par on the weekends.

Coming to dining, we're in a group, and hence ordered 2 starters :
‚Ä¢ Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish : coated in minimal amount of panko n fried and then saut√©ed in chilli garlic, this starter is just mind-blowing and it kick started our appetite and craved us for wanting more. This starter is also a suggested dish from zomato.
‚Ä¢ Butter Fried Chicken : unlike other eateries this place uses light and thin batter to retain the similar taste inside the chicken pieces... Soft and succulent pieces of chicken supplemented with assorted veggies satiated our taste buds like anything.
Well, in main course we opted for :
‚Ä¢ Kung Pao Chicken : this preparation is my personal favourite plus I saw it's name in zomato suggestion as well and the taste of this dish was enough to justify that. With ample of nuts in it, the dish had a sweet strong garlicky flavour enough to fall for it.
‚Ä¢ Fish in Black Bean Sauce : this was the first time I tried black bean thing which had the taste of fermented black beans with a concomitant pungent salty and spicy taste which didn't go well for me.
‚Ä¢ Thai Garlic Prawn : Prawns saut√©ed in rich spicy garlic and chilli sauce had quite an impact on our taste buds.
‚Ä¢ Mixed Meinfoon : although not much a fan of Meinfoon, still I liked it.
‚Ä¢ Mixed Hakka Chow : chowmein was delectable with a hint of ajinamoto in it and had generous amount of chicken, shrimps in it.
And finally we ended the meal with :
‚Ä¢ Darsaan - this quintessential dessert after a Chinese meal is much needed..darsaan had the perfect crunch with sesame seeds enhancing the taste. üòÑ
.
Staffs were prompt and suave!
.
RATINGS : :
FOOD : 4.5/5
AMBIENCE DECOR : 4.5/5
SERVICE : 4/5
VFM : 4/5

hence with all the positive points this restaurant gave me one of my finest dining experiences.

Thus,
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! üëë

One of my favourite restaurants not only in the Park Street area but also in the city. The price might be on the higher side by a small margin compared to places at China Town and the neighbouring Bar B-Q but their food is absolutely brilliant and yum.
From the Kung Pao chicken to the Golden fried prawns and from the wontons to the mocktails, the preparations are pretty damn good and definitely one of the best chinese restaurants in the city.
And definitely it takes a lot to extract a 5 star rating from me.
The ambience is also quite good but it's more of a family gathering or a friends gathering place. It doesn't have that privacy for a date but the food more than makes up for it. It's a must visit for everyone if you havn't already tried it out.

Had lunch here today. The d√©cor here is lovely, with pretty looking Chinese teapots and intricate wood carvings. 
The sauces and condiments on the table are really nice as well, loved the green chilli dip. We started off with fried chicken wontons, light and crispy golden, tasty as ever. For the main course, we had chicken fried rice, chicken gravy chow, kung pao chicken and soya chilli chicken. Yes, that's a lot of poultry, but it was all good. Special mention of the kung pao chicken, it's the best I've had, till date. Absolutely divine. Half a plate of chicken here has 7 pieces, so keep that in mind while ordering. For dessert, we chose the chocolate brownies. Topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream covered with chocolate sauce and chocolate dust, this was sweet nirvana on a plate. Loved the experience, can't wait to go back.

Nice decor with great service. The turn around time for an order is super fast which was impressive.
Went totally with the suggestion.

Started with Lung Fong soup which was delicious. Followed it with fish fingers(pure kol bhetki no basa crap)

Cantonese noodles, mixed friedrice and chicken manchurian summed up the menu.

Their quantities are on the higher side so pls discuss before ordering.

All in all a nice experience

Terrible experience. I visited the restaurant with my friends on August 10, 2016 at around 6.00pm. The service personnel were inhospitable and did not have the minimum etiquette that is required. the food was overpriced and did not reach the level of expectations. I do not recommend the restaurant to anyone as I feel the coinage of the term "FINE DINING" simply does not go with it.

Beautiful place to have a classic dinner. This is my most favourite Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. I liked the ambiance very much. The ambiance was just of my type, with a fluent and nice music. The service was also very good.

Been there several times, took several of my friends. Drumsticks of heaven is everyone's favorite it seems. But my personal fav is onion rings. Good bar menu, ambience is really good (do have some memories tied to this place though). But must visit if you are around park street. Buffet is value for money.

We were at a fix on where to go for our office anniversary dinner last year (August 2015). We zeroed in on two names on Park Street- the just-opened Barbecue Nation near Camac Street crossing and Tung Fong near Free School Street crossing. The scale finally tilted to Tung Fong as we‚Äôve been to the other one a couple of times in the last few years and it didn‚Äôt mean anything new to us.

Tung Fong is a leading name in the Chinese cuisine in Kolkata, run by Monica Liu who also helms the popular Chinese restaurants Beijing and Kim Ling in Chinatown at Tangra and Mandarin at Southern Avenue.

As we were waiting for some of our colleagues, I went in with one to keep a table. The waiting area is adequate and nicely done.  It is a spacious restaurant (and bar) decorated classic Chinese style.

Butter Fried Chicken, Chili/ Garlic Pepper Fish and Tung Fong Fried Prawn were ordered as starters. Butter Fried Chicken was chicken fingers fried in thin batter and served with saut√©ed vegetables. The tender fingers made for a good start and went well with the sweet chili sauce and green chili sauce kept on the table, but the chicken was a tad too salty. The fish dish was better- succulent fish encased in a crisp coat of crumbs. The prawn topped the charts. Juicy prawn in a super crunchy crust.

All were ordered again on popular feedback. The chicken this time was perfect. The fish was softer, not crunchy and tasted even better. The prawn was equally good. My recommendation goes for all three. Starter is definitely a strength of this place.

We took fresh lime soda, whisky and vodka to go with the starters (and not the other way round). Drinks complement the food in our office outings.

Soup came next. The Non-veg Thai Soup tasted average to me. I found it a little too sour for my palate. The shredded chicken in it was also not much appealing.

We came pretty early for dinner, at eight-ish. The occupancy was not high then and it was pretty calm. Saw a few young couples, a young group and one/ two families. The occupancy was rising with time as more families were coming in. The buzz went up a bit, thanks to the little ones. Nevertheless, this is definitely one place where you can have a dinner with friends or family with peace of mind.

Time for mains. We ordered vegetable fried rice (for an odd man out in the whole group of meat lovers), mixed fried rice and mixed rice noodles. As sides we chose Shanghai Fish, Szechwan Chicken and Smoked Lamb. I opted for the mixed fried rice and found it good. Nothing special. Tried the Szechwan Chicken to go with it first.  Tender chicken pieces in a thick, tangy gravy. The chicken tasted good, but the gravy was a wee bit too sour for me. I had expected it to be a little more pungent.

Took the Shanghai Fish next. The fish was soft and tasty, but the gravy tasted a bit suspiciously similar to the chicken‚Äôs. This is one phenomenon I have found in quite a few Chinese restaurants in the city. The smoked lamb was a disappointment! It was very dry and nothing to talk on the taste front.

We rounded off with a yummy hot choco brownie on a bed of ice cream.

A pleasing dinner! Would like to come back especially for the tempting starters.

Was in the park street area, decided to give this place a shot, and boy weren`t we rewarded!! The first thing I liked abut the place was the dim lighting and the spacious hall. The service was decent too, we opted for 4 Treasure soup and lemon soda to start with. Next we asked for chilli garlic pepper fish and Cantonese noodles. To finish the meal we had a caramel custard.¬†
Each of the dishes was cooked to perfection. The soup deserves special mention, it has been a while since I had tasted a better soup than this.¬†
The prices were also decent and doesn`t burn a hole in your pocket.¬†
All in all, a pleasant experience will definitely come back to try some of the other dishes that they have to offer.

Whenever  Chinese cuisine comes to mind, Tung fong is one of the premium restaurants of Kolkata to serve up some of the best oriental delicacies till date!! The decor and ambience are in tune with a Chinese theme -the dragon carvings on the pillars, chinese paintings, the huge dome make you feel almost as if you are in Hong Kong!! We ordered butter fried chicken amd smoked lamb for starters. The lamb meat was tender with a marvellous smoky flavour and the butter fried chicken was outright delicious. We also had chilli garlic mixed fried rice with green pepper lamb and chicken hakka noodles with chicken in baby corn and button mushrooms. All the dishes were prepared very well, served in generous proportions..my favourite however, was the green pepper lamb! Among the cocktails, the carribean frost tea deserves special mention for its taste. And the pocket pinch is also very reasonable! This place is sure to be anyone's ultimate destination for awesome chinese cuisine!!

One of the best chinese restaurant around park street. You get some authentic chinese , tibetial delicacy here. Fish items are superb here. From soup to starters to desert everything just fills your soul. You will love their crispy fried babycorn! Probably the beat I had in recent times. If you want to have good chinese food around park street this is the place to hit without any doubts. Only thing you should be ready is to loosen up your purse...price is on higher side so, it can burn hole in your pocket

I visited this place last Sunday with my parents for dinner. My parents prefer Chinese so we decided to visit this place in Park Street which is so famous for Chinese. This is located just beside Mocambo in Park Street so it was not at all a problem to locate this place.

Food:

In the starters we ordered the following:

ÔÉº	‚àö Chilly garlic pepper chicken

   ‚àö Chilly garlic pepper fish

ÔÉº	‚àö  Fried button mushroom tossed in manchurian sauce

We took fresh lime soda along with these.

All the starters were ordered in half plate as it had 6-7pcs which were enough for us. The starters were really great and mouth-watering specially the chicken and the mushroom preparation.

In the main course we ordered the following:

ÔÉº‚àö 1 plate of Chicken american chopseuy

ÔÉº‚àö 1 plate of Chicken rice noodles

ÔÉº‚àö 1 plate of Kung pao prawn

ÔÉº‚àö 1 plate of fried baby corn

I did not like chopseuy much but my parents really enjoyed it. I always prefer rice noodles in Chinese main course and this time also I loved it. BUT I was disappointed by both of their side dishes. I had better Kung pao prawn preparation in my life. The fried baby corn preparation was more of a boiled babycorns preparation served in chilly garlic gravy.

All of these cost us 2397/- including all taxes and charges.

Service and ambience:

This is a huge place which can accommodate around 80 odd people at a given time. The interiors are so well that it will give you a classy feeling while you are dining.

Their service was not up to the mark as they responded bit slowly and lacked the warmth that we expect from places like Tungfong.

Overall:

If you prefer to have Chinese in Park Street then you can go for this but if you prefer to have excellent Chinese in Kolkata then there are many other places.

So this place is one of the most underrated joints on Park Street, but absolutely the last word in (Indo) Chinese cuisine in the area.

Start off with the Red Pepper Fish and the Chilli Garlic Pepper Prawn, have your fill of the Mixed Schezwan Chow and the Kung Pao Chicken and polish it off with the Tutti Frutti.

A cosy "family" place which will drag you back by your taste buds.

Well... Fair enough ! Good enough ! On its own a good place to dine for Chinese food but falls short when just compared to BarBQ which is just 100m away from this place. Everything is fine, the decor, the food, the staff but still somehow you would feel something is lacking, missing the punch (Only If u have already visited places in park street like Mocambo, BarBQ, Peter Cat etc)

Coming to food.. Drums of Heaven and Chilli Garlic Pepper fish was nice. Was hot but not unnecessarily spicy.

We ordered Schewan rice and chilli garlic rice ( both seemed identical.. Alas.. )
Their 'todays' special' Sea food rice was good nonetheless.

Standout was Kung Pao Lamb. Thai Garlic fish was okayish !

P.S. Sauces/Chutney served at the table was just delicious. A green chilli chutney and red chilli sweet chutney !!! 5star on that. 

One time visit. Yes definitely. Look around there are better options available for lunch/dining.

No matter how much i write about this place, it just wouldn't be enough. This place has been my all time favourite and i visit it at least once a month. It is an amazing experience to sit and eat under that huge arc with magnificent golden oriental work all over it. The ambience gets brownie points. Talking about the food, well, they have one of the best oriental dishes in their menu. The prawn fried wonton, chilli garlic pepper fish, the tangy thai soup with sea food, shanghai fish, kungpao chicken and their legendary mixed rice noodles are my favourites. One must try out the meinfoon, it is really light and tasty. I've visited this place so many times and i'm still not bored, but yes, i do miss those wet tissues that they used to serve which used to rise up after pouring warm water on them. One should make it a point to visit Tung fong during the chinese new year( around 25th january) to enjoy the amazing dragon dancers that come into the restaurant to perform.

This is one of the best chinese i had after a long time. Starting with the interior and ambience, it's awesome, immediately after entering you would feel that you have entered an authentic chinese club as shown in the movies.
Secondly the service is above average better than the counter parts in Park Street area.
Thirdly and most importantly the food, it's absolutely amazing and delicious and the quantity is also appropriate as per pricing.
As per overall experience i would give it 4.5 out of 5.

The best fine dining restaurant in Park Street if you are looking for authentic and sumptuous Chinese delicacies. The quantity is healthy and the quality is possibly the best you can wish for. Any of the soups are worth a try especially the chicken asparagus thick soup. Kung pao chicken is one of their best non veg sides and their main course has a wide range to choose from. The mixed american chopsuey is a must try. The decor is pleasant and the dining area is spacious and peaceful, free from the clamours generally encountered in a big busy joint like this. The service is extremely cordial and the price too is not that heavy. A must visit for people who appreciate real Chinese delicacies.

But d trip was a total disaster
Ordered chilly garlic fish, drums f heaven, hot and sour soup
Drums f heaven can easily send someone to heaven....just fried it up and served
Soup was just boiled water with no taste
Service wasn't even good enough
It's better to avoid it in my opinion

After checking high ratings of Tung Fong at zomato I decided to visit this place with my best friend as I wanted to give him the treat as a gift from my end, but regretfully the experience was so bad that I ended up with a dull memory all together.. Coming to good points - The decor was good... And I thought the food would be too but no it was not.. When we checked in first, the expression of one of the waiter was so awful, that he was not at all happy to welcome us and also despite of so many empty places the waiter asked to sit on a place which is just beside kitchen and was too noisy as well.. Later on we have to ask them to change and got a sit finally after 15 minutes.. Coming to food, I had ordered Chilly Garlic Pepper Fish, Drums of heaven, chicken hot and sour soup, and among mocktails I had ordered highway marry... Gone thorugh the recommended dishes as per trend but found nothing special on pepper fish, the drums of heaven was only chicken fried in batters, no salt, poor presentation as well, it came in a serving bowl, and not plate.. The hot and sour soup was more like tomato soup, mocktail was good.. When we ordered the main course, they took the order without informing us that they are going to shut down the place. I was aware that it is open from 12:00pm to 4pm, but when it is 03:15 they are taking orders for main course, and you expect them that it should come by next 15 minutes and finally you have to finish them within 4pm. When we informed that it will be not possible to finish the main course by 4pm, the reply from the waiter was "The AC and the lights will be off and if you want you can continue to have it".. really so embarrassing, we had to cancel the main course.. Just for decor I give it a 3... I believe that the staffs were so much in hurry , that they compromised with the food. If you want to close it by 4, please dont allow anyone to enter your restaurent after 3 and then place order which the customers will not be able to eat.

In the Park Street food-caste hierarchy, Tung Fong is that place one visits only after being turned down by long queues at Peter Cat + Mocambo, and having being bored of its more successful cousin, Bar-B-Q (and now Flavours of China), which are cheaper to eat at.

Tung Fong has been very few's first preference, and it clearly seems the big space and easy availability of seats is its greatest asset, since the food is just as decent as any Indian Chinese Place offers.

If Tung Fong were a person, I would wonder how felt to be always the under-performing horse amidst its great kins and that feeling must suck !

A reliable Chinese eatery in Park Street. When we are here, we don't think twice before ordering any new items, as we believe they won't serve anything which tastes bad. Most items we tasted here are good. Our personal favourite is the smoked lamb. 

Service is a bit slow, but friendly. Ambiance is basic but comfortable.

We ordered veg Hakka noodles and stir fried veggies. To go along with that, a glass of fresh lime soda.
The stir fry was more of a soft soggy prep  unlike the crunchy fried veggies I prefer. The noodles were cooked perfectly but the winner was the fresh lime soda. 
Sadly, we couldn't finish even 10% of what we ordered. I wished to have eaten good food but was disappointed.

Tung Fong gives you the oriental fine dining restaurant feel to you the moment you enter the restaurant. The ambience of the restaurant is amazing and very authentic. The staff are fast and skilled with friendly attitude. The food is tasty n not that spicy and oily. The portion size is good too.

Went for dinner with family to Tung fong last month after reading Zomato reviews...but was hugely disappointed with the main thing...food...the golden fried prawns for which we were charged a hefty inr 1100/- for just 6 pieces were the biggest letdown...they were soggy...far from being crispy and crunchy!! Even the pan fried noodles were soggy and tasteless and the restaurant captain tried to justify that rather than replace it and were also charged for those...only the soup and lamb seemed average...hygienic service is lacking too! ambience is nice and spacious but that doesn't justify the bad food...definitely don't intend to go back or even recommend to anyone. Please go to Golden Dragon or for that matter BBQ for better quality food.

This chineese restaurant never dishearten you. Located at parkstreet and the freeschool street junction. We keep visiting this place but still not tired of it. Everything about this place is amazing.
Be it the ambience or the food or the behavior of the staff members.
We always order soup and startes. The starters are so delicious that you are full before ordering the main course. The highlight of this restaurant is drums of heaven....chilli chicken and jumbo prawns. The other food they serve are equally good. They have their unique style of cooking the most clich√©d dishes. They have a half plate and full plate concept and the quality is pretty massive. It is pocket friendly as well. They never compromise with the quality of food even if the restaurant is super crowded.
People visiting to Kolkata ....its a must try!!!

Starting with the ambiance as it was simple and elegant. The restaurant is quite spacious compared to restaurants in Mumbai. 

For food, we ordered Thai Soup and Sweet Corn Soup which were okish. We ordered fried baby corn which I found quite tasty. For the main course we had veg manchurian and veg chilly garlic noodles. The noodles were too tasty and the taste was quite authentic. 

Service was not upto the mark but the food made up for it.

So I would give 3.8 or may be 4 out of 5

Located just beside mocambo we went there on a sunday eve. The decor is amazing to start with. I really loved the fact that the place was well lit. Actually i really don't like place that are dimly lit. Coming to their food we order garlic rice mixed rice chicken with baby corm and mushroom and kung pao chicken. The quality of the ffod is excellent and the quatinty suffices three person. If you are in and around park street and looking for chinese do visit this place.

Its not a very discussed place w.r.t. Mainland Chinas or Barbeque Nations. But its one of the best Chinese that I rarely had after Mainland China. The ambience is what I am most impressed of the place. Lot of space, silence very cosy seating arrangement. The food is v. good. Would love to visit the place again.

Tung Fong is one of the best family restaurants in Park Street area. Simple yet nice decor, the ground floor is for the family. Coming to the food, we ordered Drums of Heaven, Butter Fish Finger, Mushroom Soup for starters. Butter fish was amazing, so amazing that we ended up ordering another plate of it. For main course, we took mixed Manchurian fried rice, mandarin fish, thai chicken and chilli crab. Again, I loved the fish most. But the other dishea were pretty good too. The service was pretty fast and the waiters are extremely well behaved. All in all, a wonderful experience.

Though it is a famous Chinese restaurant in Park Street, it couldn't please me at all except its mocktail and drums of heaven. The main course was a disaster as it was too oily and there was less prawn and chicken in a mixed noodles. Even the quantity of chicken in black bean sauce was less. And they charged me 1589 for this. The staffs were also in so hurry that we couldn't enjoy our food.

If you love chinese food and wanna taste it in a such ambience,you should try here..the ambience is very nice with it's center place which is a little bit higher up from the floor with a concave roof and surrounded by 4 pillars which are also decorated with dragons on it..we went for buffet(@670/- with tax per head).first there was  complementary coke.then drums of heaven and veg fried wanton.loved their chicken drums..chilly garlic aloo and hunan chicken were very  tasty..manchurian fish was so delicious and  so soft.chili prawn was awsome..we took 4 items separately....virgin mojito, kung pao chicken,hakka chili fish and fried button mushroom...virgin mojito was perfect..everything was nice...will go again...

Been there last evening, after bouncing off the serpentine waiting queues at some other restaurants in the area - Sunday evening in full flow. Tung Fong also had people waiting in the anteroom but my wife and I were lucky being just the two of us. The chilled AC was very welcome after the sultry outdoors.

As always it was clean and clutter free. The spaciousness is very evident. Chef's recommendation Tung Fong fried chicken was the perfect accompaniment for the beer. Strips of fresh chicken lightly crumb fried, served hot. The chicken did not have that 'long-in-the-freezer' texture nor the smell if you know what I am talking about. The sweet chili dip was perfect with it.

The pepper chicken was very good too. Light batter, decent pieces with just the correct flavors. Fish fingers were great, I guess the freshest Bekti wrapped in the lightest of crumbs and fried to perfection. The first bite was tongue scalding hot.¬†

We had filled ourselves up with the starters. So dinner was simple - Chicken and egg rice noodles and chili lemon chicken. The spotless plates were pre-warmed, a practice you hardly find anywhere nowadays. The noodle strands were firm yet tender, nicely seasoned and the chicken pieces had a crusty foretaste before yielding to the tender insides - all balanced nicely with the gravy. Much recommended. Did not have tummy space for desserts after this.¬†

Courteous service, fast delivery even on an evening of very high footfalls without any compromise in quality is commendable. For good and authentic Chinese fare around Park Street, Tung Fong nails it fair and square. Real value for money and the half plate portions are more than decent for two adults.

With a very pleasant ambience and delicious dishes, Tung Fong serves exquisite food experience. I visited the place with my friend on a Monday afternoon and we were greeted with wonderful decor and great lighting. We had to choose either Buffet or √† la carte; we took the latter. We ordered a half plate of Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken as a starter. Though it was said that there will be 6 chicken pieces in the half plate, we were served with 9 (:p) . We were very hungry and noticed it after finishing the dish. For the main course, we ordered Chicken Manchurian Chowmein and a full Chicken with Baby Corn and Button Mushroom. The Chowmein was supposed to be spicy (at least according to the menu) but turned out to be of regular taste, though it was good. The Chicken with Baby Corn and Mushroom was delicious. Large number of chicken pieces, baby corns and succulent button mushrooms were served in white sauce. The dishes were enough for 2. The Service was very good; we were served with our order within 10 minutes. The total costing for these dishes was Rs 966 (including VAT & Service Tax). There were many other dishes of Prawn, Crab, Lamb etc. Will surely visit again to taste these dishes and also the buffet.

Tung Fong in Park Street is a gem when it comes to chinese food. The decor of the restaurant with its wooden furniture's, beautifully lit space and the ambience immediately sets the mood. And then comes the most important part...it's food. In this area also Tung Fong doesn't let us down at all...instead it's light, perfectly cooked mouth watering dishes gives the soul a perfect serene that is long desired.
To be honest it is not easy to order in this restaurant as one will be spoilt with that many choices. For starters we ordered chilli garlic pepper fish and butter fried chicken. Both were exceptionally good but the pepper fish had a slight edge over the fried chicken. For main course we ordered mixed fried rice, kung pao prawns and chilli garlic lambs. The mixed rice was the best of its kind with the kung pao prawns delivered a solid punch in the taste bud, the lambs though were a little bland. Overall a fantastic experience especially when you are a die-hard Chinese food lover. Will surely recommend this place and would love to visit again.

The kung pao chicken was good, the fried rice na chowmein were good. Chilly fish was delicious.
Overall a nice place to visit with your family, not ao much with college friends.

If you know the food trail around the Park Street Area like the back of your hand, there is rarely a chance that you have not introduced yourself to Tung Fong. In case that you have not visited the place yet, it is time you do. Like the handful of other legendary eateries in the area, Tung Fong too owns a massive space. The first two things you notice when entering its grand doors are the stone lions, by the door sides. The interiors are sufficiently lit and the wooden furniture, does take you back to the authentic food scenes in the the 60s and 70s. 

The food for that matter is quite likeable and I have a certain luring for it. There are a specific number of things that I love from their menu. Some of my favorites, include- the fried wantons, the red pepper fish/chicken, drums of heaven, chili garlic pepper chicken/fish, Schezwan fried rice, chili garlic crab claws, pepper chili chicken, soya chili fish and a lot more. The chili chicken tastes great too. I can just go on and on. Waiting to visit again.

One of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Kolkata,,,, Tung Fong has been a favorite Chinese cuisine hub for me (though I don't like Chinese much).... Tom Yum soup nd kung pao chicken amidst the other delectable dishes are my fav here.....
The place offers a la carte menu as well as buffet (lunch).... The best thing about Tung Fong is,,, however,,, their large waiting arena‚Äîno matter how long the queue is,,,, you will never have to stand in queue....

A very popular eatery in Park Street. Good Chinese food at very reasonable price. But the only problem is dont expect a quick service if you are visiting on weekends. They dont have too much waiting but still for some reason the service is pretty slow and you always have to waive the waiters to take your order. So sometime you might lose your patience. Also tips are expected from waiters so if you dont pay tips they give you a looks as if its their right and you denied it... But then they should not charge service tax if they expect tips.... Overall in food quality and quantity its pretty good compared to pricing... Overall an OK experience...

Had the most amazing time. Not just once, but  twice. The ambience is just perfect for chit-chat with friends. The service providers ensure that they quietly serve you and pass on to the next table, so you are at ease. As for the food, awesome and especially love their pepper fish. Not that the other cuisines are any less. Because of the area too, it's easily accesible. So, even dead in the night at around 11,  I was able to swosh down to my home. Book an ola or uber. Enjoy!

The Chinese preparations are light and tasty. One will be spoilt for choices when it comes to select the chicken and fish preparations. One who loves Chinese food must visit this restaurant. Once you enter, you are bound to get flattered by its sophisticated decor. I have been there many times; the food and the service never cease to impress me. Table reservation is must if you are going with your family.

Ambience: better than other stag sections in other restaurants.
Hospitality: The staffs were much hospitable and prompt.
Food: We ordered A Bloody Mary, Blue Mary & a Blue Gin and chilli chicken for starters. The Blue Gin was the best and others were not so good.
For maincourse we ordered Prawn Fried Rice, Chicken hakka chow, lemon chicken & chilli garlic chicken. The lemon chicken was finger licking good.
Cost: We ordered so many things and didnt even reach the 3K mark.. its cheap for such good food at Park Street.

Overall the restaurant was awesome and would try out more often for the general section.

Revisiting the time tested dine out destination in Kolkata, Park Street, which offers a wide variety of options nestled with an old world charm, we choose Tung Fong for a Chinese lunch. Located on Mirza Ghalib street, this is a popular place. If one heads from the Park Street metro, walk on the left foot, take a left on the second intersection, walk a few paces and you are there. The location on Zomato is pretty accurate.

This place is a classic family destination. They have this huge hall with cosy semi-enclosures to give the right privacy. They usually have a waiting on most days, and have catered to it well. The hall also has a separate enclosure below a dome which they say is strictly for family. The place is cosy and the lighting is mellow. The walls are adorened with nice wall hangings and vases going well with the Chinese theme. The dome at the centre is lit with golden light and with the dragons making up the pillar art, it all sets up the mood.

Coming to the food, one can choose from the classic menu for ala carte or go for the buffet (at least for lunch). We went for the ala carte. The menu is wide spread with a lot to offer. For atarters we tried the mixed talumein soup, chilly garlic pepper soup and fried prawn wantons. The soup was served hot and was tasty to say the least. Full with noodles and chicken it also had a wanton. It made a good start to the meal. The fish was cooked really soft and saut√©ed with chillies and spring onions and had that perfect taste. Among the starters, the wanton did not live up to the expectation. It was fried crisp but the filling was a bit bland. Also the shellwas too greasy and the dish filled us up. A special mention must me made of the hot and sweet dip served with the starters, it had the perfect mix of sweet and hot and went well with both the starters.

The mains comprised of mixed manchurian rice and chilly lemon chicken (gravy). The rice was cooked well and full with small diced carrots, beans, spring onions and shredded chicken and prawns. The chicken gravy was saucy and had that perfect sense of hotness and sour. The quantities served were more than adequate for two. By the end o te meal, we were so full that we skipped desserts and instead chose a glass of sweet lime soda.

Coming to the other aspects, the hygiene and cleanliness is well maintained. The staff could be a bit more courteous and attentive. There was this incident where our dish was served to the next table. The prices are on the higher side.

Overall the food wins hands down. This place is here for a long time and it must stay so. It serves quality Chinese food and is a must try.

Happy eating!!!

Went there with my parents who love Chinese as much as they love Bengali maach-bhaat. The vegetable spring roll was the best I've ever had (and i've had at many places!). Half portion had six pieces and that was more than enough for us three. 

Next was red chilly pepper fish. I didn't like that much since the fish wasn't crispy enough. The half portion (7 pieces) again was However, sufficient. 

For main course, Prawn American chopsuey was good enough though I liked the egg Cantonese noodles more. The vegetables were perfectly cooked! The schezwan egg fried rice was good too and i would order the fish in garlic sauce again. 

I am definitely going back for the spring rolls and Cantonese noodles! 

Ambiance : You'll fall in love with the Chinese decoration and the giant oval ceiling. 

Overall it was a good experience and worth the bucks! Definitely going back :)

We went for the buffet this time. The taste of the food was quite good. There was chicken, fish and prawn in the non-veg portion of the main dish. The chicken starter which was spring chicken, was a bit dry. I loved the ginger prawns. There is a complimentary drink (cold drink/fresh lime soda/beer). The downside could be the fact that you are only entitled to 2 scoops of ice cream.
All in all, I would say, it is at par with its price, which means that you pay a little less than you do at Mainland, and you a get a little less because of that, no more. :)

An excellent combination of charming ambience, wonderful d√©cor, and delectably delicious Chinese cuisine- Is that what you are looking for at Park Street?!!
"Tung Fong" is the place you should opt for!!
Located at the junction of Park Street and Free School Street, just beside "Mocambo", this restaurant is popular since ages for the awesome, authentic and delectable Chinese cuisine they serve, and the artistic China themed interior decor, with a perfect charming ambience it bears. 
The moment you step inside, you'll feel the perfect vibe of sophistication that a fine dining restaurant is expected to possess.
The service staffs are courteous, polite and well mannered, and the food is just fantastic.
If you are fond of Chinese cuisine, you just can't afford to give it a miss. And If you are not, then you will be, after visiting this place.
A must visit for all the foodies out there.
Cheers.

Location: Park Street (right beside Mocambo) This restaurant has gained a lot of popularity over the years. Like the name suggests it's a Chinese restaurant. The ambiance is quite impressive: dimly lit, spacious and comfortable seats. The must haves of this place are chicken drumsticks, crispy baby corn, pepper fish. Barring this my personal fav is lemon fish which has just the right amount of tangy flavor and melts in the mouth leaving the perfect after taste. Coming to the staff now.  The staff here is usually extremely well behaved however I'm sad to say that I was a little disappointed in my last visit. The person attending our table was extremely rude. He had no inputs whatsoever and he simply took away the plate kept in front of one of my friends who wasn't eating. He was for some reason in a hurry to take away the plates! Amusing. I really hope I don't have to experience such a thing again.

Waiting time is too much in weekends.
Buffet available in weekends is a plus point.
Quantity is good but quality is ok types.
All types of alcohol they have in their menu card are actually they having in stock. That's definitely a very good point for me. 
Cordiality of the staffs is good.

Can go with a big gang here. Attentive staff. Large place. Nice Chinese food. Don't go if you are looking for an Indian version of 'chini' food. Had tried buffet once, desert were bit of disappointment, with just darsan and ice creams :(

Located just beside the famous Mocambo, Tung Fong is an absolutely delightful restaurant. I went there on Valentine's Day and I was totally taken aback by the place and food. Very spacious and the classy lights just make the place extra amazing. Coming to the food, we ordered #HakkaChilliChicken , #KungPaoChicken and #FortuneRice. Sufficient quantity and the food was fine in taste. Amiable staff.  
Overall a good experience.

If you are looking for authentic Chinese restaurant this is the place u want to be. The decor and ambiance is nice. It give u a mainland china feeling. The food is as good as the place. Loved the wantons. And awesome rice. Rice was just perfectly balanced. So was the chicken and fish dishes. Looking forward to visit again.

This is one of the best standalone restaurants at Park Street. What I really like about Tung Fong, is their food, which is extremely light and tasty. The desserts are delicious too. The staff is quite good and they always provide a bowl of extra chocolate sauce for icecreams. Chinese food lovers, must visit this place! :)

I was with my school friends for lunch on 24.04.16 I insisted them for Tung Fong as this place is quite a fav of mine. The food was good, I came here after a couple of years back and found the quality has deteriorated a bit. I love the Drums of Heaven here which they used to serve in buffet we ordered it in a la carte found the salt to be a bit less. Meifoon, Chilli Garlic Chicken, Sweet N Sour Chicken, Hakka Noodles, Non veg mixed fried rice all tasted as if it has lost the Tung Fong magic touch. But I wont say bad either. What astounded me this time was stern and strict look of all the stewards of captains none of them looked welcoming, no smile on their face. The table linen were crumbled required touch of ironing. I will still be back. Thank You.

The food available can have no complaints. Starting with appetizers, one can go for the Tung Fong special chicken with a glass of desert storm on the side (if they're not having alcohol, that is). The baby corn and chicken wontons are good too. The chicken drumsticks are lovely. In fact, the choice of starters is so good that sometimes, I don't have the audacity to go for a main course dish lest I should explode.

Went here on Sunday, 24/4/16, with friends for a get-together. Buffet looked tempting, so we opted for it. That was the mistake we made. Food was stale. Noodle was smelly. Chicken gold coin was full of cabbage and onion. Fried wanton did not have any chicken stuffing. Tom yum soup was horrible (won't take another chance to have soup at Tung Fong). When questioned the manager about the quality, all he had to say was 'we prepare our dishes as per the instructions given by the owner'. Is the owner at fault? Is it that the owner, Mr. Michael Liu, compromising with the quality of the food served at the buffet? After tasting such pathetic starters, we wanted to discontinue the buffet and opt for a-la-carte. The present management declined our proposal. There wasn't any senior authorities present where we could put up our grievances. Though Tung Fong, Mandarin, Kimling, Beijing belongs to the same family, I wonder how the taste and quality differs to such an extent! Hope that management will look into the quality of the food they serve...It was my worst experience at Tung Fong ever!!

Maybe its high time to write a review about the place you have been going to eat since you learnt the taste of good Chinese food in Kolkata. Happened to pay a visit for weekend lunch. 

As usual every course was delicious.

1.For starters the hot pepper fish's heat,the lemon chickens sweet tanginess and the smoked lambs delicate aftertaste proved a perfect blend in your palate,better if you have a mug of beer and some best friends with you.

2.The main course was mixed fried rice with hot garlic prawns and sanghai lambs ,both of which fills the little space you had after the scrumptious appetizers.  

3.If you still are in a mood for some sweet to get the digestion going after a heavy lunch go for the chocolate brownie with ice cream,even though I think the section lacks a bit of variety.

All in all a great experience for any foodie whenever he feels the urge for Chinese eating out. Burp!!!

A very well known place among Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. The place is nicely decorated and spacious. Staffs are courteous and helpful. Their buffet is quite well spread. The starters mainly include DOH ( quite good ) and another vegetarian item which varies . The food is quite light yet tasty. Veggie Delight is awesome with mushrooms, baby corn added in good proportion. Both Noodles & Fried Rice were good.Lemon chilly chicken was very good. Though I generally do not prefer the dish yet enjoyed it very much, but my personal favourite is Kung Pao Chicken. Manchurian fish was as usual . The best item comes with prawn. I have tasted quite a few prawn items on a number of visits and each one has been rewarding. They lag a bit when it comes to desserts as there is not much of choices there. Located at a very convenient place this place is worth visiting again and again.

Poila Boishal Lunch with my friend. Amazing and charming decor will definitely attracts you. The restaurant was totally full though we got our food very quickly. The taste was Mind blowing of fried fish with chips though the chips were not crispy. Even the main course was superb in one word. Would love to visit again.

I have had a really good experience in Tung Fong. Located in Park Street, this restaurant has the right ambiance, the right crowd and the right food. Having checked out this place with a few friends, I decided to throw my birthday dinner here and I was satisfied with the quality and quantity of the food, the seating area, and the ambiance. My only complaint, however, was with respect to the service. The servers were not as attentive as I would have preferred. 

When it comes to Chinese, I usually stick to my favorites - pan fried noodles, fried rice and chicken. I loved all the dishes ordered and the food tasted appropriately tasty.  

Tip: Just read the menu carefully so as to ensure that you get the food you want at affordable prices.

I was there on 13th April (eve of Poila Baisakh). As we settled with a glass of drink, we suddenly felt the tremors from the earthquake that hit Myanmar on 13th evening. 
We quickly forgot the incident with some lovely food served to us. For starter, we ordered their specialty Fried Chicken which is actually Chicken Strips coated in bread crumbs & deep fried. It tasted fantastic with the salsa & sauces served alongside. For main course we ordered Mixed Cantonese Chowmein & Mixed Maifoon along with Chicken in Black Bean Sauce. Both the varieties of noodles were awesome & so was the chicken dish. At the end it was a heartwarming meal.

If you want to have authentic Chinese cuisine in a cosy environment set your foot @ Tung Fong. Located in Park Street, Kolkata this restaurant will ignite your Chinese taste buds with their delicious preparations. Courteous service and a relaxing ambience will increase your hunger. Try the Prawn Tempura Dish. Pricing is around 750/- per head for a sumptous lunch/dinner.

mmmm!!!! this is one of the Legendary Restaurants in Kolkata located at my favourite PARK STREET, the majestic grandeur offers the vintage flavour the moment you see the typical Chinese Door of the Tung Fung, this is place for family and romantic date and here they scored perfect 10 on 10, I must confess before saying anything further, that I do not like Chinese Cuisine much! :P some how I find them as distant cousin of Bengal, Himalayan, Nort-East & Puducheri Cuisines :P nevertheless my boudi is big time Chinese food lover and I had to take her some authentic place in Kolkata as she was giving me Treat :D although her soul purpose was to satisfy her taste buds only :D We ordered Hakka Noodles, Crispy baby corn with honey, Pan Fried Fish, Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Drumsticks and soft drinks. Hakka Noodles, although Hakka is a little different genre of Chinese Cuisine, the texture of Noodles are very soft, well cooked and yet not sticky, oodles of well cooked vegetables and light flavours I found perfect with our chicken drumstickes, I have tried Chinese in many joints but what makes Tung Fung different from others is their Flavours & Spices, no over the top flavouring, no ocean of Oil and last but not the least they are no distant cousin of "Bengal, Himayan, North-East and Puducheri" hehehe... I tookaway ¬†.5 marks because I hate to wait more than 10 minutes for food :'(

Located in one of the hot spots for eating in the whole of Kolkata, Tung Fong is quite a nice option for Chinese food lovers. The food is really good. I won't call it the best in Kolkata but it does provide you with a great meal and a fine dining experience! We had the following:
Chicken Sweet corn soup - Something I have had so often that I am reaching the point where it no longer impresses me. Nonetheless, the soup is quite pleasing and nice.
Chicken Talumein Soup - First time I tried Talumein soup and it is was okay. I mean I don't think I will remember this soup because it had no wow factor.
Chilli Garlic Chicken - Again, something that I have tried at many places and it was a good dish, the flavours worked well.
Chilli Fish - The fish was cooked really well and I quite enjoyed it.
Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was well cooked and tasted quite nice by itself.
All in all a nice place with a nice ambiance making it a good lunch/dinner outing.

The sudden rains brought Chinese cravings which pulled us to this popular park street restaurant. The place is a hall room which is finely decorated but not overdone. Coming to the food we ordered red pepper chicken and chilli garlic pepper fish for starters. Both dishes were quite nice. Then we ordered mixed fried rice and they recommended shanghai chicken. The fried rice was really good and the chicken was neither too spicy nor bland.. Just the kind of Chinese food I adore. Overall a nice experience. Hope to visit again.

It is a decent place to visit for a lunch in weekends. I tried buffet which was very much with in budget Rs615+tax. They offered complementary drinks beer/cold drink.
Space and ambience is soothing. In menu not much really to offer but what was there is tasty. 4 types of salad, 2 non veg starters ,1 veg starters ,1 veg soup ,2 non veg soup. 4 non-veg side dish egg rice, 3 veg side dish, veg rice, ice cream.
The price in a la carte is high both for food and drinks. I will recommend to try this place for buffet and to try prawn salad which i liked very much.
Over all it can be a very nice place for weekend lunch with friends and family as well.

Tung fong was on my list of restaurants for a long time so while catching up with college mates we played this place a visit.This place is a must visit for chinese lovers. We arrived at 3 pm and immediately received the seats.We were lucky enough to get the center table under the dome.
For starters we ordered fried chicken wanton and smoked lamb.I did not have lamb before so wanted to try it.The food arrived and the staff were courteous enough to serve it.The fried chicken wanton were crispy and filled with chicken.The smoked lamb was also tasty enough and a little sweet. We also ordered red pepper chicken which was crispy and spicy too.If you are a spice lover you would love it.
For main course we ordered mixed fried rice,chicken rice noodles and chilli lemon chicken.The mixed fried rice was light and had ample parts of prawn,chicken and egg.The rice noodles were also good.The chilli lemon chicken was a little sweet but tasty enough.
We left the restaurant with food in our stomach and our hearts content. Hope to visit soon again.

I must say that I was really impressed by the decor. It feels awesome to dine under the dome area. I went there with my friends for lunch. For starters we took chicken thai soup. In the main course, we had ordered fortune rice, chicken fried rice and chilli garlic babycorn. The quantity is less when compared to the price. The babycorn was delicious. The fortune rice was tasteless.

A legendary Chinese joint right at heart if bustling part of city of joy. Got seats straight away and first impression after entering was grand white interior like Chinese palace. Though interior was dated but maintained immaculately.

In starters had Tung Fong Chilli Fish and Chilli Garlic Crab Claws. Fish was fresh but crab was complete let down. Both were in half portions comprising 6-7 pieces. We are not satisfied yet hence ordered half portion Spicy Hosin Lamb. This was lovely dish but can't be treated as main course due to lack of gravy.

In main course had Mixed Fried Rice, Fortune Rice with half portions of Chilli Lemon Fish and Hot Garlic Prawns each. Both rice dishes were excellent full of chicken, prawn, egg and shitake mushrooms. Chilli Lemon Fish was refreshing taste some thing different while prawns here huge in the side dish. 

Servers were not polite and always in defensive mode if any feedback passed. Service was slow and lacks attention. Bill was around INR 2800 inclusive all. Still a wonderful spread out place for enjoying Chinese cuisine.

For main course we ordered gravy rice which was a new try for me and I was overwhelmed with it and normal hakka noodles with chicken gravy and overall had an awesome  experience there.

This place is on Free School Street, just a little way past Mocambo. Huge, spacious interiors, nice ambiance, very vintage decor. 
We ordered the chicken hot and sour soup alongside red pepper chicken to start with. The soup was medium, split four ways (ideally should be three though). The red pepper chicken was really nice. 
The main course included green pepper chicken, cantonese garlic fried rice and a chicken schezwan noodles. The rice was pretty good, as was the chicken. The noodles was slightly below expectations though. There was also a slight mix up in the service, due to which we got rice instead of the noodles we had ordered (SIGNS???). Anyway, all said and done, this was a pretty good meal overall. 
The pocket pinch was considerable, but expected I would say. Service was good barring the slight mishap. 
Best Chinese I had in the city? Probably not. But among the top 4 or 5, I daresay.

Park street on sunday. For lunch. And we didnt have to stand in the queue. So i was sceptic wdr its my lucky stars or the place aint worth it. The next 45 mins cleared away any doubts that may hav cropped up. 
Was greeted courteously by the staff into a spacious dim light hall with nice seating arrangements. Its not crampy and u donot overhear ur fellow gourmets conversation as in many places here in park st. they offered their suggestions politely as what we should order coz we wanted to avoid v spicy dishes. Ended up ordering hakka chilly fish half as starters followed by mixed fried rice and half green pepper chicken.first visit so¬†stuck to basics.¬†Zomato reviewers had made me aware of the proportion of the food they served. 
Waiting time 15-20¬†¬†mins. 
On came the starter. The hakka fish was perfectly yum and it went v well with the sweet chilly sauce which deserves some mention here. Proportion of food will make many resturants die of shame.
The fried rice had d perfect quantities of egg prawn and chicken. The green pepper chicken gravy wasnt spicy. Chicken pieces were soft and well marinated. Proportions, again, huge considering its a half serving. 
Finally we had the traditional two scoops vanilla with hot choclate sauce. It was a tad disappointing coz we r so specific about our desserts.the choclate wasnt hot and d scoops shud have been larger. 
pocket pinch : 1000 including taxes.
Nonetheless a great experience. Will b back again quickly for more authentic chinese menu.

If you're in Kolkata, Chinese is what you get to have the most. Tong Fong is one of the fine dining Chinese places located in Park Street. There's nothing really special about this place apart from the fact that this is a very old restaurant and you can see that from the people working and the services. We had the buffet which was pretty up to the mark. 
A visit if you're a Chinese lover is surely advised.

Very good when it comes to Thai or Cantonese style preparation. I have tried Four Treasure soup along with chilly garlic fish. The meaty froth soup along with the tangy flavour of garlic fish made a heavenly combo. Main course was pretty simple when it came to Cantonese style soupy noodles with schezwan style dry fish. A stomach filling but a light dinner served by old tung fong restaurant.

A great place!! Ambience is probably the best I have seen in the years..total Chinese feel... food was good.. it's better than good but lack awesomeness. Drums of heaven is actually heavenly!! Soup was not that good. Noodles were perfect. And dumplings were Okish.. overall a good experience.

Great ambience, lovely decor, and when the occassion is Valentines day.. love was in the air.. we ordered tung fong chilli fish for starter.. it tasted yum.. basha fish is once and for all my favourite..the prepation tasted too good.. quantity was less though.. 
Coming to the main course we ordered kung pao chicken, mandarin fish, and mixed chilli garlic noodles.. once again i loved the fush preparation more than the chicken.. the chicken tasted good but i found it a bit too spicy.. otherwise well cooked and tasty.. 
Staffs were courtseous.. cozy sitting area.. well ventilated. Overall a good experience.. INR 2585 for two people including alcohol vat and tax. :)

The first thing I liked about this place was the ambience. It's vibrant and full of life. The food was good not great. Their rice noodles are a must try. Apart from that  food is good not great. The service was brisk, which I appreciate. Judging by the location, ambience and service it's value for money... Excluding the food part though. Overall it's a place worth trying out once.

I have visited this outlet after a span of five years and to my surprise their food quality has been deteriorated in such a fashion

Every time I visit this place, my order contains these. Must try the rice menu. They have some really good ones. One thing that I did not like here was the cantonese rice. kung pao chicken is nice. Overall a nice place. The ambience and the service is really nice.

First of all the ambience is great here. We ordered Garlic Chilli Chicken and Veg Garlic fried rice. To be honest the food is average here considering the price. It's not cheap so I expected at least better food here. The service,people,ambience everything is great except the food. I'm not saying it's bad but it must have been better considering the price you pay for it as it's not cheap.

Would be upfront here first. I am not an avid Chinese Food fan. But this food takes a bow in terms of quality, preparation and service and a midscale fine dine restaurant. Must try: Chicken Wanton Soup., Crab Chilly, Chef's specialty Tung Fong Prawn is another thing I liked. Tofu is a specialty too. But personally did not like it. Red Pepper Chicken , Spicy Hoisin Chicken , Chicken Paichoi was good to taste too!What I liked most was the entrance part which is pretty royal. The ambience and look and feel is great to spend good time with friends but of course with a bit more on budget.

So this one time I was craving for Chinese food and a friend of mine decided on Tung Fong. I fell in love with the ambience. Lovely English setting and warmly lit. 
We asked for a basic mixed fried rice and another side dish. The helping was huge and more than sufficient for two people. Non-greasy, and good amount of prawns in it.  Made my evening :)

So my friend and I decided to have only appetisers here. We ordered red pepper garlic fish , kung pao chicken , chicken spring rolls , deep fried prawns and hot garlic chicken, all of which were amazing. I had never imagined this place would be so good. I loved the fish in particular. It was really hot because it was served with saut√©ed chillis. The ambience of the place is also beautiful , a big dome in the centre of the dining area. The staff is friendly and helpful. In the end we had a tutti fruitti whic was basically canned fruits with strawberry and vanilla ice cream. This place is a hidden gem. And it would be regretful to not have been here.

We had gone to Tung Fong recently for dinner. The decor is nice and the restaurant is huge. The food was pretty average. On the pricier side, considering that the outlet is located in Park Street. One could visit CIT CAFE for better Chinese food at a more pocket friendly range. Tung Fong is just OK. Around Average.

Tung Fong is well known restaurant, well located and the food lives up to the reputation. We had prawn wanton soup, chilli pepper garlic fish, American chopsuey and chicken in black bean sauce. Food was good, and the ambience too was nice.
But what I did not like were the cocktails. We ordered planter's punch, vod kiss and green magic. The composition of the cocktails were not mentioned and as a result vod kiss and green magic turned out to be just rose and khas syrup with vodka. It tasted horrible and looked no better. Planter's punch was better but I have had better. And the person taking our order looked bored and annoyed. I would not have expected this in a place like Tung Fong.

An age old restaurant but still serving decent food..If names of some restaurant are obvious with Kolkata then Tung Fong is surely one of them and a prominent one..
There are always some places in every city which have been a part of the cultural fabric of the city by the sheer number of years they have been operational...
Located in what is essentially the food hub of the city right beside of the mocambo it does live up to its hype..
This place had a soft spot in my heart..and then had the hearty Chinese meal..Never seen this place empty..Pretty spacious for a restaurant that is always crowded..luckily we didn't have to wait for our table..
I can confidently say this place is an acquired taste..It has a cult following so I tried the place..I like the uniqueness of this place and the colonial felel...
The environment is extraordinary and the crowd is up to the mark.The fried rice was decent as well..The USP being the quantity.. Humongous..
The service has deteriorated with time which regulars would be able to discern ..The ambiance is urbanised..Feels like I am being seated in a proper Chinese restaurant n being like family restaurant also...

Visited here on 1st January 2016 for lunch to celebrate new year and a friend's birthday.
Location- on the lane beside Mac Donald's, just beside Mocambo.
Ambience- the restaurant is quite big with many sections. The seats are quite comfortable.
Food- we ordered fried babycorn and button mushroom with shezuan sauce for starter. It was spicy but the fries were not crispy and it was a bit soggy which was a letdown. For main course we had mixed Friedrice which contained lot of praws, egg and chicken. It tasted good. For side dish we ordered fish in oyester sauce and kung pao lamb. The fish was tender and juicy. The gravy tasted good too. It was mildly spicy. The lamb was very tender. It tasted good. But it was dry. It will be a good choice as a starter.
We were too full to order any desert. Hence we had fresh sweet lime soda. The soda has lost its fizz and hence tasted like 'lebur jol', it was a let down.
Price- we paid near about R's.1200 for our order. Considering the area and the quality and quantity, the prices seemed fair.
Over all a nice experience. If you are near Park Street area and are longing for Chinese food along with drinks (they serve alcohol, cocktail, mocktail etc) you can consider visiting this place.

Yummy Chinese cuisine is what you get at one of the reasonable eat outs at park Street - Tung fong. 6 of us visited this place on new year's eve, 2015 for a sumptuous lunch and we were quite in love with it on the very first visit. The place was very spacious with tables spaced out by wooden partitions and you get to sit on nice couch and enjoy your time with friends or family. The crowd I suppose is usually nice over there in spite  of the fact that the bar and dining area are the same. Service was also quite prompt given it was 31st DEC. Now comes the review on food.
We ordered for starters as
Chicken asparagus soup( for those who want tummy friendly soup) - 1/2 plate for 2
Mix hot and sour soup 
Chilli fish( was a little dry though) - 1 plate for 3
Moving on to the main course, we ordered
Chicken rice noodles - 1 plate for 2 almost like authentic one
Manchurian lamb which was delicious
Mixed fried rice - again 1 for 2
Lamb in oyster sauce - average
Chicken Hakka noodles 
Fish Manchurian which tasted extremely good.
Overall our bill was around 2700/- for 6 . I would recommend this place for the reasonability and tasty food along with nice ambience for family or friends meeting after a long time. P.S. rowdy people please stay away

The family celebrations of the Christmas week this year (2016) started with plans for lunch at Park Street. The vote was for Chinese cuisine, for which we found Tung Fong the best option (thank you fellow foodies at Zomato!) . 

‚òÖ LOCATION : It is located adjacent to Mocambo, near the intersection of Park Street and Free School Street (Mirza Ghalib Street). In other words, if approaching from Park St Metro, keep walking straight and then turn left at the Flurys/KFC/Au Bon Pan crossing. Tung Fong will be on the left.

After 20 minutes of waiting outside, we were escorted towards our table. 

‚òÖ AMBIANCE : The huge seating area has a small dome-like structure located centrally in the ceiling. The tables are placed keeping a good distance thereby allowing enough privacy for a dinner with family. The entire restaurant sports a dim lighting system, although not dark, which isn't good if you are there to click a lot of photos (without flash). Overall, simple and classic interiors. 

‚òÖ FOOD & PRICING : 
We started off with some SWEET CORN SOUP and HOT & SOUR SOUP. The former was decent while my parents loved the hot & sour soup.

Next came CHICKEN DRUMS OF HEAVEN and HOT GARLIC PEPPER FISH. The latter was exceptional while the chicken drumsticks, despite being recommended by the staff and zomato alike, weren't really that good. 

In the main course, we chose MIXED FRIED RICE, EGG NOODLES and CHICKEN CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES. All of them tasted really good and the portions were enough for two. Along with these, SHANGHAI CHICKEN and KUNG PAO CHICKEN were summoned on the table. The half plates of each had 6-7 pieces of chicken so please be careful while ordering. The kung pao chicken was delightful while the other had a tad bit tangy aftertaste which I usually don't like. 

Though the taste and quantity of the preparations were satisfying, I couldn't help feeling that the prices were too steep - ‚Çπ3000 for the entire meal seemed a bit too much keeping in mind the food which was good but not really exceptional. 

‚òÖ SERVICE : We anticipated a slow service on the 25th of December but everything was served pretty quick. Appreciated.

The entire experience was nice, apart from the pocket pinch. :)

Wonderful experience! 25th Dec was definitely not the best time to visit any Park Street restaurant. But, surprisingly enough we had quite enjoyed the wait and the sumptuous food thereafter. Authentic Chinese in the heart of the city..with great Non Veg and Veg delicacies. Absolute yum. Try the chefs speciality items while having the starters. I would say bang on value for money. Quality and service impeccable! Will visit again.

It is a good Chinese restaurant in this area (Parkstreet). Located just beside the Mocambo. The decor and the ambience is quite good. We tried Prawn fried rice, Mandarin fish, shangai chicken, kung pao chicken, mixed fried rice. The food was really good. The service was good and warm.

Love coming back here.. Both and service is really good. Ordered sweet corn soup, Hakka chilli fish and tung fong FD chicken as starters, then had a sumptuous lunch consisting of mixed Cantonese noodles, mixed rice, chicken with vegetables and fish b/bean sc. It was really tasty but the quantity is very less.

The place is good enough. Its serves good food but still they needa improve because the food they provide is okay in comparison with the food the nearby famous restraunts serve. The price is average and they too have bar available. Overall this place is okay for me.

I was told this one is best Chinese in Calcutta. Went there with high expection. The environment gets a 4 star but food quality is average, it certainly did not blow me out. Most Indo-Chinese restaurants in Calcutta have a very few signature items which are palatable, keeping other items wanting. Same trend is seen here. Loved the chilli chicken, everything else were average. I found too much use of soy sauce in most items lacking some other falvors. Chinese food is much more than soy sauce and viniger. Garlic fish was a big disappointment. The mixed hakka noodle was far from perfect. I won't be back in this restautant.

The usp of this place is the very affordable lunch buffet spread consisting of chicken, prawn and fish dishes each day of the week and that makes it a very useful destination for the office goers in the area. Add to that a complimentary pint of beer... voila! Frequented this place quite a number of times and it never disappoints. however they need to revamp the menu periodically.. after few consecutive visits it tends to be a little mundane ...

Located just beside the legendary Mocambo, this place is relatively unknown to people. But true fact is, it serves the best Chinese in the city. It is tad costly, but worth every penny.
The ambience is decent. Extremely spacious. Courteous staffs always give you right suggestion. Services are quick too. All sorts of food and drinks written in the card are always available.
Drinks are of course costly. But foods are moderately priced. The Red pepper chicken, Beer Chicken, Sanghai and Sezchawn chickens are good. Fish dishes are just wow!!!
Cantonese and Mixed chows are perfect. Generous chicken and not-so-small fresh prawns make them way above average.
What I like about their Rice dishes is that, those are exquisitely white in color and less spicy. The rice smells good and the spices smell less, yet awesome to palate. The strong flavor of spices doesn't ruin the dishes.
The food are never too heavy on stomach.
It is one of my personal favourite Chinese joint as you enjoy every bit of food without post-meal discomfort.

Nice place to worship chinese foods at the heart of Kolkata (Park St) ........but dedicated to those who are lazy enough not to visit China Town or other authentic places Eau Chew (Middleton Row). 

My recent visit yielded some surprises. Staff has improved. Though set up is more crampy.(Definitely taken a few ideas from next door Mocambo for setting up their indoors.) Ambience is cool. That, I really liked. Coming to food - the important one!!!! 
Don't stare at those prices, because some of those prices may justify the preparation served. 
Four Treasure Toufu has to be tried. 
Shaslik chk/prawn another awesome dish. 
And the evergreen wonton soup. 
Well the goods ends here. 
For the main course we ordered, 
Kung Pao Chk - average 
Chicken w black bean - worse
Fish in oyster sauce - regretted paying for that. 
Szechwan and Cantonese noodles were OK. But they didn't make a fuss. 
IMHO try the starters and go for the main course at some other place.

Seeing a waiting time of 30 minutes at mocambo we went inside tung fong and waited there as well but for 10 minutes which was fine considering today was Sunday. We ordered medium chicken thai soup which we divided amongst 3 of us. Both the quantity and quality were really good. I loved the side sauces they have out there. Not the regular soy sauce n chili sauce. But a honey chili sauce, a green chili coriander sauce. Coming to the starter we ordered chili garlic chicken. Crunchy and perfectly seasoned. For main course we ordered fortune rice and chili lemon chicken. The chicken was tangy and really good. The rice is also called moon fan rice. The bill came to 1453 inclusive of all taxes.

When I went there the first time, I felt this was a hidden gem. I had not heard much about this place in my circle. So I threw a party in their upstairs party hall to impress my friends and family with my 'discovery'. However, food was not so good for the party! It was a mixed bag experience.
Since then, I have been to this place close to 10 times and the food has always been tasty and good. But I wouldn't say that the food is reason enough to frequent this place.
The staff is polite and friendly but the service can be a little slow sometimes.
One impressive thing is that they have more variety in their menu than a lot of other similar places.
Seating is comfortable, and you don't have to eat Chinese while getting the aroma of biryani from the next table.

This is one of the finest Chinese restaurant in park st. area. The staffs are very well behaved and the whole crisp white ambiance will make your feel relaxed. The food, the service and the spacious clean environment is enough reason to visit Tung Fong for repeat visit.

Best Chinese cuisine in Kolkata right beside Mocambo.
I went there this Puja on Nabhami 22nd of october with one of my school friend.Since its a dry day so our plan were to have small booze session in our home only and then go out for a dinner at Mocambo but unfortunately we were too late and itz closed.So we have to go Tungfong and fortunaly we got 2 seat.
FOOD:
Since we were too late half of the item were not available..
We ordered Mixed Fried Rice ,chili Garlic Pepper Fish and prawn in Black Bean sauce and ended With Fruit Salad with Ice-cream.
Every item were really really good specially the Prawn in Black Bean Sauce.
If they serve this quality food specially on Puja days (keep it in mind- we went there around 12am) then they deserve to be the Best in Town.
Overall a Wonderful experience in a pocket friendly budget!!

The first thing you notice here is how specious it is. You never get that crowded, sitting at your elbow feeling here. Service is very very good and although not absolutely pocket friendly, the place is on the affordable side probably due to the portion size. Do not be fooled by their half portions, it's pretty comfortable for two people with average appetite. 
Coming to the food I have tried quite a few of their starters and my recommendation would be pan fried chili fish, chili garlic crab claws, garlic pepper chicken and the Golden fried prawns. I always order Cantonese noodles in a Chinese restaurant and that's my yardstick. The mixed Cantonese noodles is excellent, warm and comforting, with generous meat,  seafood and vegetables. I have had the chili garlic chicken and Chili lemon fish,  both of which was excellent. I would absolutely recommend it for your go to place for Chinese in Park Street.

We visited the restaurant yesterday (10th November) afternoon. We were 4 adults in the group and a 4 year old. We settled for buffet lunch. The menu was short but seemed good enough. But as we proceeded with our order we faced few hiccups-1. They charged half the amount of buffet for the 4 year old. We agreed and told them that buffet food being spicy the kid cannot have anything other than chowmein¬† from the buffet, therefore requested for less spicy version of the drums of heaven or fish if possible. The waiter came back and said they cannot accommodate and will not charge the baby but then we have to take a separate a la carta dish for her and we cannot share food from buffet. This was ridiculous !! simply spoiled the appetite we had. 2.Starters, welcome drink and soup was served at table. It seemed they were not very comfortable with serving buffets. Nobody came to our table to ask if we needed more helpings of starters. We had to call the guy repeatedly and ask for the same.3. Food was good. The prawn was too spicy and there was only veg-fried rice for the non veg buffet. Very limited choice for desserts though the quality of ice cream was pretty good. My suggestion is that on weekdays donot opt for buffet lunch, on weekends menu is little more elaborate. The staff of the restaurant is prone to serve a la carta and having buffet there was not a great thing to remember. We are not coming here again. Giving 3 stars only because of the quality of food, which was good.

This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, period.
Its very conveniently located, just next to Mocambo, and the restaurant is pretty big, so waiting times are not an issue either.

Coming to the food, its ridiculously good. The prawn dishes deserve special mention. We also had a Chicken in black bean sauce and Lamb in oyster sauce, which were really good.

The place is a bit expensive, but you never feel like you are wasting money. Its so worth it.

Lavish is the term that rightfully describes TF. The biggest hiatus about TF is it's location. Had it been seeded anywhere else, it would be an anytime crowdpuller. But Park Street have better options to serve you when your taste buds are up for Chinese. The buffet provides good variety though and that too without being harsh on the pocket. If I have to name an item that's exclusive, it is their hand made herb sauces and it tastes pretty good.

Situated right next to Mocambo on Mirza Ghalib Street, this restaurant offers one a very soothing ambiance and reasonably priced Chinese food. We had the option of either the buffet menu or a la carte, and we went for the latter. Starting off with Drums of Heaven, we had the Mixed Hakka Chow and Fish with Black Bean Sauce as the main course followed by Chocolate Brownie and Tutti Fruti for dessert. All the items tasted excellent and the fish was of great quality, cooked to perfection. The dining experience was great, especially considering how pocket friendly it was. However the service, though prompt, wasn't exactly top notch. We had to ask for the a la carte menu and the wine list which one would expect would be given at the very start. Aside from this very small flaw, it was an excellent culinary experience. I would highly recommend this place.

Well this is one of our favorite restaurant near Park street. We decided to visit for our Bijoya lunch. First of all despite having number of waiters it took them almost 10 mins to come and attend to us although the restaurant was almost empty as it was only 12 PM. Also I had to repeat my order 2 to 3 times and did not feel the service was upto the mark. Coming to food no complains as every item we ordered tasted good. The best dish was the Prawn spring roll. We also loved the hot garlic chicken in the main course. So I hope they can improve on their service and would love to keep coming back to this place.

I was here yesterday to celebrate a reunion with my college friends. I heard about Tung Fong from one of my close buddy & decided to try the cuisine.
It is situated in Park Street just beside Mocambo. The cozy ambience & wonderful decor is nearly perfect. The central dome shaped elevated area has round tables & goes down pretty well with d mood.
Tung Fong has a lot of speciality items in each & every section which makes it a unique place to have proper chinese other than the regular ones.
We ordered Fried Wontons, Schezwan mixed F/R, Veg F/R, Cantonese Mixed Rice, Babycorn with Mushrooms & Garlic Chicken.
I personally feel the quantity could have been a bit more given the prices they put up.
D chicken was delicious & so were d other items. The cantonese rice was not as bland as found in other places. The service was nice & waiters were quite cordial.
Would love to visit again & try out their other signature dishes...!!

The lunch buffet service at Tung Fong caters to your Chinese cravings without doing much harm to your wallet. The ambience is amazing with excellent service. The 6 course meal came with a complimentary welcome drink and your choice of ice cream. Food is lip smacking to say the least. Will come back for the weekend buffet, of which I've heard loads.

A pleasant surprise! Very spacious, considering its prime location.¬†
The diced chicken with cashew nuts was done just right -- not drowned in white sauce, not even camouflaged in cornflour!
Mixed vegetables in chilly garlic sauce was very tasty, and the prawn fried rice was dry and fluffy, not oily.

Even the beer was nicely chilled!¬†
Service was a little lukewarm -- but I guess the the rest made up for it

But second time it was so very disappointing. The Cantonese chow was not cooked AT ALL. The person serving us could not even separate the chow to serve me. The same foo yoong was not tasty. I don't know what went wrong with them this time.

This weekend i wanted to try the famous chelo kabab at Peter cat. But with the rush and big waiting list i ended up having lunch at tung fong which is located near to mocambo.
I tried crispy chicken and chilli garlic pepper fish. Starter tasted good. In maincourse i tried garlic chicken noodles with chicken in oyster sauce.. main course tasted really nice. For dessert i tried brownie with ice cream. Brownie was comparatively cold and hard whereas i expected it to be hot and soft.
Staff service needed improvement in my opinion. There was a large buffet spread but they didnt inform us ,we found at zomato. My overall experience was ok.

Food here is average! We had buffet & I could find only 2 starters (1 veg & 1 non-veg) which was disappointing :(
The quality of food is good but the variety that one would expect in a buffet spread is lesser if compared. 
So I hope to have a better experience with ala carte here.

First, spacey, with appropriate decor, raised centres and all. Tables well designed with focus on ergonomics.Service is commendable, and reaction time of the waiters also commendable. Priced in Kolkata's higher middle range, with more than fair Guangzhounese and Mandarin dishes, though could be improved with some more northern variations. Yam Mein was good, also nice to see it on menu.Seafood Platter recommended, though easy on the sauce base. Overall, good dining experience.

I went to dine in Tung Fong with a hungry stomach after a day long tiring event.

On a Sunday evening the Resturant was full, though we did not have to wait for long. After getting a table, there was no waiting staff available for at least 15 minutes.

When finally we ordered, it took forever to serve. The waiters never bothered to ask to get the food served. The quantity of the food according to the price was quite less, though the taste and quality was moderate.

One of the more eminent Chinese restaurants of Park street, Tung Fong provides a recommendable dining experience.¬†It doesn't seem much from the outside but the interiors are expansive and elegant with a beautiful chandelier at the center, it is more of a huge dinner hall. The ambience is sure to mesmerise.

Opting for the buffet, initially qualms rose about the spread as it was not much, but the quality of the food more than made up for it. The two soups, a veg and a non-veg one, and the two starters, veg wantons and chicken drumsticks, were worth having twice.¬†The main course had rice, noodles, tofu, mixed veg, chicken, prawn and fish, and except for the fish, which was a let-down, each of the dishes were appetizing. Desert included assorted fruits and ice-cream¬†but a single serving of which was a big disappointment.¬†However, the complimentary drink was a plus.

The service was prompt and courteous and made for a favourable experience. An excellent recommendation for Chinese cuisine¬†aficionados.

I have been to this place quite a few times. ¬†Recently 5 of us visited this place and the bill came to a 1750rs which was quite a deal considering we ordered everything from Large Soup to Starters to Main course. The soup,Hot and Sour Chicken, was very good, both quantity and quality wise. It wasnt too spicy and wasnt too sweet. Was a perfect balance. The starters we chose friend onion rings and crispy babycorn.
The babycorn wasnt good, it wasnt crispy and went limp on the fork. The onion rings were comparatively better and were crispy as needed. Next the main course was egg friend rice, shezawan noodles and manchurian.. The quantity was just perfect for us 5 and we didnt hve to order anything extra. The taste was real good, as indian chinese should be, spicy and hot, We ordered large manchurian so we got 12 balls dipped in red gravy which was quite a lot for us.

I suggest this place for anyone who wants to spend moderately on Chinese food and get a decent deal with good food. The ambiance is just perfect, not too dark or too flashy. So you can try this out if ur looking for good chinese food on park street.

This is the restaurant! I mean the restaurant. It had everything going for it. Great ambience, right in the middle of Park Street, excellent interiors, classy decor, and space and space. Not to mention the terrific waiters. Ever smiling folks just makes you want to visit again and again. 

And the food. Oh the food!! The menu boasts of amazing array of foods and each is a delight. Try smoked lamb with beer. Or try the chicken. Or the fish. I can tell you every time you choose a new food, you will be pleasantly surprised. Makes me wanna steal their cook. 

So that's it. Probably the best restaurant in town if you put in all the criterion. I keep visiting it once in every month. I
Am sure so you will once you eat here. The place kinda grows on you, you know.

And btw, the price is reasonable. Very very reasonable. So if you haven't been here yet ( you moat possibly have been if you are a regular at Park Street and a foodie), do go tomorrow.

This is one of the best places for Chinese cuisine in Kolkata. I have been here twice and have fallen absolutely in love with it. The decor and ambience is beautiful, and gives you the feel of an authentic Chinese place. It is very spacious, and well planned, especially because it gives the options of both buffet and a la carte system. The waiters are polite and service is good. We started with famed Drums of Heaven, which lives up to its name. They are crispy fried chicken drumsticks. Then we ordered Chicken Hakka Chow and Kung Pao Chicken. Kung Pao Chicken, shredded chicken cooked with peanuts in lime based sauce, is something you MUST try to understand its true worth. It leaves a pleasant aftertaste in your mouth long after you have devoured it. The best thing about this place? It is very very pocket friendly, even though at first glance, it looks like a fancy place. A great place for college students.

Yet another legendary restaurant from Park Street next to another heavyweight Mocambo, enter Tung Fong & your eyes will go straight to its large dome with beautiful chandelier right at the centre!!!

Hugely spacious, simple yet elegant ambiance & beautiful sitting arrangement, tung fong is certainly among city's elite Chinese joint.

Try their Red & green pepper chicken, Kung Pau prawn, Shanghai fish & brownie with vanilla ice cream..... they are all fabulous( & are elegantly served) but I must say there are even more to try from their elaborate list of dishes to offer

Thought bit on higher side of pricing, but the kind of taste being served here will never let you feel money wasted....

Out of the many places in kolkata serving Chinese food Tung Fong will probably be one of the top ones. Located in Park Street area the place is very famous. The ambiance of the place is worth mentioning. The Architecture makes you feel that you are in china while you eat. Food is upto the mark with its price. we ordered the golden fried prawns, mix rice, chicken in black bean sauce and maifoon. The prawns and chicken were excellent.

Overall above average. A good place to try out.

Tung fong has all the ingredients to be one of the best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, but unfortunately it isn't. The main reason behind this is the service. I must say that I have never been this disappointed by the service of a restaurant. Otherwise the food was pretty good, both in terms of quality and quantity. The ambience was good too. But the service ruined everything.

The ambience is amazing and has the best lamb in town.  The food is really delicious, the lamb literally melts in the mouth, the chicken dishes were good as well. Fried rice was on the bland side but goes really well with the lamb.

We went to Tung Fong on a boring Friday evening after a gap of a few years, and safe to say I have not been let down. The d√©cor is very very nice. The central part of the restaurant draws the most attention. We ordered for Chicken Spring rolls for starters. There were 12 pieces and they were amazing, truly. We were almost full after eating the very adequately sized spring rolls. After this, we ordered chicken fried rice, chilli garlic noodles and kung pao chicken for the main course and yet again we were more than delighted. The food is simply fantastic. The service is even better. We didn't have to wait at all. 
Can't wait to again!

First thing first, upon entering we were simply awestruck by the sheer size of the dining hall of this legendary Park Street food joint. The beautifully lit up hall is decked up quite elegantly.  Everything in this place, bears a testimony to the elitism and grandeur it epitomizes. Quite luckily for us,  on a rainy Sunday afternoon,  there were very few diners present at the time,  so we managed to get quite warm hospitality from the staffs. Going with the zomato's recommendation,  we had drums of heaven,  mixed fried rice and Kung pao chicken.  Every morsel of the food was delightfully prepared, especially the Kung pao chicken.  I had this dish in many places but Tung Fong's one was by far the best. 
With all those foods and a foster beer,  our bill came up at around 830. Considering the ambience,  the food,  the hospitality I felt no pinch in my pocket. 
Overall a very satisfying experience and will surely come whenever my taste buds crave for the best Kung pao chicken in town.

This place serves the Indian Chinese which you can only find in east India. I've had Indian Chinese all over, but the Kolkata Chinese is just lip smackingly different. The spices are much stronger and the eastern flavour dominates.
The place is on the legendary Park street and it's pretty huge. Easy to find a spot to sit. The seating is old school and so is the decor and furniture.
The food proportions are generous and the ones meant for two can actually feed three.
Each and everything ordered is bound to make your eyes and ears open and nose run... That's the beauty of good Chinese food.
Over all a delightful experience. Easy on the pocket too.

Tung Fong has ample opportunity to become a good restaurant,but it fairs only a 3 on my list, the reason being that the dishes were unappealing and average in taste. ¬†Compared to the price on the menu, the food was not worth it. Ambience was good and service was just at par.

I am a vegetarian so my feedback is wrt veg food only. The main course was delicious. The veg manchurian, veg hot garlic sauce, veg Hakka noodles, ginger garlic rice were all very good. In calcutta when people think of chinese food then most of the time you end up queuing at BarBQ. But this place is a very good option for Chinese, minus the 30-40 min waiting. So in terms of food, I would rate the place as 4, but found the place lacking somewhat in terms of ambience and service. My take - its a must visit once, but i would prefer a place with a little better ambience and decor given that the food is also good. Overall rating - 3

Nice ambience & decent food,service is also decent.
over a good place to visit & an under rated place,it should be hyped a bit more.
The staff should be a bit more welcoming & the starter quantity can be better.

Sorry but had to add on to my earlier review on 2nd visit about Tutul Mondol :
i had visited the place on 24th dec for dinner,the place was crowded & had queues as usual,i did follow their procedures however the person on d gate noting the names & managing the queue was extremelly unused to such crowd i believe,he was letting people in before the queues ones & people had to wait for a long time & on asking his name,he was v proud to give his name as Tutul Mondol wid a lot of attitude & with a gesture that nothing can happen to him on complaints..
He was not even replying to the guest nicely & was doing what he felt was right..
I have been to barbQ earlier & would prefer to go to them in future as well instead of visiting tungfong wid such unproffesional staffs..
They should keep trained people,the watchman & guards were more polite than him & they apologised to me but not the attendent on gate,he had his own attitide in giving his name widout dare .
Bad service i must say on festive days that spoils guest moods...

The Ambience of this place make the difference its well spacious and huge.....
Buffet spread is Good, option of meat selection is also tremendous, good variation on the buffet....
Colour, ingredients, texture, consistency are well balanced.
Service is also very quick, buffet replenishment and table was also attended well...
As a part if buffet a beverage options is included

Been there yesterday around 3 30 pm. Ambience was good. Could have been better. Taste was upto the level with reasonable rates, but hospitality couldn't reach up the mark. That's the inly reason which brings the ratings down ton 2.5. No one to serve the new comer. Had to approach a serving waiter to ask for a table (very bad). Nobody there to attend the new comer. Had to wait for the table as there were many people, but that's not the issue. Found myself helpless and unguided when entered. Dissappointed üòûüò•üëé

We went there in 2012 for a get together with old school friends. During the Sunday evening, full house in everywhere on Park Street. Only here we found some table for around 16 people. We all are happy about the food quality. The prize is little bit higher in the range. The ambience was really good and the food tastes were very good. A nice Chinese spot in town. It is a must visit restaurant in town and you'd love their preparations. They also provide buffet lunch. Hope, I will try this buffet lunch in near future.

Food: 4/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

I visited Tung Fong twice and it remains as my one of my favourite places for chinese food. Their Red Pepper Chicken and dry chilly chicken are awesome and spicy. It makes me crave more and more. The decor is simple , its well lit and spacious seems like it has been like this forever. Don't expect something over the top from here its just fuss free nice chinese restaurant where u can eat a lot without burning a hole in ur pocket.

P.S : u may get bored with the menu if u visit here often which happened to my friends. Nevertheless i love their chilly chicken

With a mood to gorge on great Chinese cuisines at a 'never tried' restaurant, explored Tung Fong.
Ambiance: The first thing that will catch your eyes is the large dome with beautiful chandelier at the centre of rooftop and sufficiently large dining space. The walls are tastefully done with beautiful showpieces and frames. Overall, decent ambiance. 4/5

Service: Very prompt. We went here on weekday and during off time, hence waiting time was literally negligible. 4/5

Food: We ordered for hakka chilli chicken(half) as starter, chicken Szechwan noodles and spicy hoisin chicken(half) as our main course.
Hakka chilli chicken and Szechwan noodles were just perfect. Half portion of Hakka chilli chicken had 6 pieces and quite reasonable too. But spicy hoisin chicken was not upto the mark. The chicken pieces were bit hard and tasted blunt. Overall value for money is quite ok. 3.5/5

This restaurant is an absolute disaster as for the ambiance is concerned .... when you are shifted to the dark dingy sitting arrangement beside their kitchen ... solely on the basis that you are not carrying a lady with you ......... it has a basement like feel and decor is shabby(like a second class deck) ...!!
The crowd in there fitted are extremely pathetic with all mediocre drunkards who can afford tung fong but still could not manage to block their filthy mouth...
The waiters cannot even communicate properly ... not informed about the dishes they serve.....¬†
And they do not use salt in their preparations or use it in a way like they are aware of some salt crisis in the near future..... Absolutely disappointed with Honey fish, chicken with babycorn and button mushroom(feels like non veg food item stolen from the kitchens of medieval widows), thai garlic chiken, mixed cantonese rice .....

We ordered Butter Fish fry as starter with Beer and Breezer and it simply melted, the moment it entered the mouth. Next we had Mixed Meifoon and Chicken with cashew and veggies. The quantity is more than enough for one. I loved the idea of the half plate option, as it prevents wastage of food. Overall came back with a happy smile

Went for a Sunday dinner with family..since the big hall was filled we were seated at the small section right beside the kitchen. Now the service is friendly but not very efficient. The ambiance is average.
Coming to the food
Drums of heaven were delicious.
But the show stealer was the red pepper fish.
The lung fung soup(chicken) was just fine.
The Cantonese (gravy) noodles were cooked to perfection. As a side we had chicken with buttered babycorn and mushroom which did not fit right with the noodles as it was very light. But otherwise its a good prep. Would not recommend it with gravy noodles though.
A rating of 4/5 all because of the great Chinese!

Tung Fong is at the start of the Free School St. just after taking a left from Pakrk Street. The place is legendary Chinese restaurant in terms of all the aspects put together.

The ambience is elegant, the food is delicious and their service is prompt and humble. At times, it's a challenge getting a place inside and that shows how good it is. One can choose from a variety of option they provide and none seem to have disappointed me ever. It is a must visit restaurant in town and you'd love their preparations.

Another legendary restaurant in park street area,located just beside Mocambo,Tung Fong's Chinese theme with all those lanterns,vases and not to forget that beautiful dome inside the restaurant creates the perfect ambience for a dine out.Considering its prime location and great ambience, d food is actually quite reasonable. But other than these,there is nothing unique about this place when it comes to food. Although I loved their signature dish chilli garlic pepper fish but the gravy chow and red pepper lamb were just average. Moreover they said the lamb will be shredded when I ordered but it arrived in small pieces. Also the serving is not up to d mark;the stuff is quite clueless when u ask them to suggest a good dish. So apart from its look and feel,nothing seemed special to me!!!

Warm lights with simple decor.. seating spread across huge area. But what caught my attention was the centre of the place..amazing to look at n well lit ! Courteous but a bit carried away staff...
We went for the weekday buffet which consisted of Chicken hot n sour soup,Butter-Paneer rice,Sweet n Sour Chicken,Chicken Noodles,Fish Manchurian,Garlic Prawns...all items were tasty though I was pretty disappointed on the dessert part...just fruits!! 
Later, we were provided a complimentary 2 scoop vanilla ice cream,that made me walk out of the place with a smile :)

Visited this place probably after 15 years... Still has it's own charm...
We went there for dinner and didn't find any difficulty in finding a seat since the restaurant has sufficient seating capacity... Ordered chicken lung fung soup which seemed fine
For dinner, we had mixed rice noodles and Shanghai chicken... Special points for shanghai chicken since I have never tasted anything of that kind anywhere... Also spring onions add to the taste.

A very fine and reasonably priced dining experience.

Was at Tung Fong for a leisurely lunch recently. We ordered schezwan rice (veg) along with Shanghai Chicken which was delicious. The prawn based starters are amazing too and the focus is clearly on quality...In passing, I ordered a screwdriver drink which didn't have a strong vodka kick...service was quite decent. I think I'll recommend the place as among the better Chinese restaurants in Calcutta

Recently visited this place for dinner with friends. And wat an awesome experience it was. There has been no change in the decor or standard of food in this place. The decor remains simple and food remains excellent as always. The service was super efficient . 
We had seafood soup and spring chicken mix fried rice and prawnn rice noodles, seafood combination and chicken with babycorn and mushrooms and for dessert we had brownie with vanilla ice cream. 
This place is quite value for money to one.

This place is one of a kind in this city. Perhaps the best Chinese restaurant on offer in Kolkata with standards way higher than the much commoditized restaurants in Chinatown. With world class decor, furnishings and ambiance they have really set the bar higher for Kolkata's Chinese restaurants. Coming to the food We went purely by recommendations and the staffs did not disappoint us in any if the starters, main courses or dessserts. A sense of luxury descends on way as you enjoy the food in this ambiance and taste of food too gets to a whole new level. I would come here again and again and of course I haven't got a chance to take a buffet here yet but would seriously opt for it the next time I visit.

Lovely ambiance, and considering the location of the restaurant the prices seemed reasonable. But the absolute positives of this place ends there.
The Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish and Kung Pao Chicken were lovely, but not exceptional. The Pina Colada was decent and the Cuba Libre failed to bring out the flavour of lemon, making it rum and coke. 

PS: The ladies room needs a clean up!

Located at a prime location near park street area its just beside mocambo .... with two floors it has a got one of the largest surface areas when it comes to restuarants in the city ..... ambience is great .... interior is quite spacious ....ground floor is for family normally ....and has a slightly better ambience(and bit more spacious) than the one in first floor ..... talking about food quality .... its one of the better options in the area .... standard quality food ....my personal fav is special yang-chu fried rice ... it has small pieces of yellow corn in it .... other items are quite good ...though i haven't found their speciality in terms of any unique preparation or something (like 'Raan Singh Sahib' in PunJ-Aab ,nearby) ..... pricing i would say is slightly more on the higher side .... rice dishes are still ok in price but chicken and other side dishes are slightly costly ....infact similar quality u would find in flavours of china nearby at a slightly lower price .....

Food of the restaurant is simply delicious especially the chicken wantons and chicken drumsticks. The Thai chilli fish was just melting in my mouth. However the thing about which I was disappointed was the time taken for serving. We had to wait for a long time to get a place and also food was served a bit late

Having read the great reviews about this place, me and my group of friends decided to land at Tung fong to treat our taste buds. With much expectation did we order chilli garlic pepper prawn and Tung Fong fried chicken for starters. For main course we ordered Kung Pao chicken, Thai garlic Fish, mixed fried rice and mixed chow. While I cannot complain about the quantity, the quality of the food was not upto the mark. For drinks we ordered Pina Colada which were sadly left half finished by most. Darshan and brownie with ice cream also left us unimpressed. Prices were reasonable and ambience was sober. Overall I would call it a mediocre experience.

Ambiance and decor is Good,really loved it.¬†Now come to their food we took their lunch buffet, the options are limited but taste is very good.In starter they provide one veg wonton and in non veg chicken item both are delicious.After that Chowmin, chicken sweet and sower,fish item and also one prawn item.Chicken sweet and sower,fish item is delectable! They also provide soup and different kinds of salads,loved them also.One area they should improve is their dessert section,just one item and some fruit thats it,really thumbs down..With their buffet they also provide complementary drink and ice cream.Overall good experience!

The place is actually China which Indians can appreciate. The place serves a wide range of dishes, and you can select your portions accordingly. The soups and the starters are a stand out and the choice of noodles is better than the rice. The pork and lamb preparations are again, a stand out. The service not that good, but the wait is worth. And you will understand that only if you eat there sometime!B-)

A very nice place with beautiful ambiance, tasty food and reasonable price: tung fong, according to me is the best Chinese food joint in the Park street area. The prawn and chicken wantons are the best starters they serve. But their main course dishes are really good. Kung pao lamb is my favorite. Kung pao chicken is also good. Rice and noodles are okayish, i liked the rice noodle. The quality of food is very good and the place¬†has lovely decor. Only disappointment was the rude behavior of the waiters.

The Chilly Garlic Potato was good but could've been better also while the Veg Fried Wonton were great they had more shell than the filling. The Veg Schezwan Noodles were Great. Overall¬† a very pleasant experience. Highly recommend this restaurant to Chinese Food lovers since I found it to be Awesome.

And another classic park street food hub goes down this week :)

Honestly speaking, nothing wrong about this place but there is not a single thing that's out of the box or potential USP of the resto except the good location. Unlike most other restaurants of Park Street, there was no vintage-ish appeal to it. So, sorry Tung Fong, the food was good, ambience was good as well, but you were just another regular good resto for me...:)¬†

[The waiters could smile a bit more :P]

Okay now , this is one of my favourite restaurants. I've been there at least 8 or 9 times and I never succeed at controlling the amount of food that I intake.They provide a great buffet at weekends and all of the dishes taste great. Plus an additional treat is their complementary drinks and ice cream. Now common , a little beer can never fail at bringing a smile, can it?(not of course the shitty ones).
Their fine balance between the veg and non-veg items is sure to delight you.
And not to forget, their fantastic location is an added bonus.
The only reason why I didn't rate it 5 is because they seldom change their buffet menu , which becomes a little monotonous after a few visits.
But overall, it's a wonderful place.
Okay so I went there today after a year and got to know that they've stopped their buffet course. So we ordered from the main menu. Everything was amazing and as always this place kept it's place in my heart

Best Chinese food in Park street according to me. I love the ambience of this place but the first floor is not at all appealing. I always order more than two starters whenever I visit this place. Sometimes I even skip the main course and enjoy their starters and beer. I always order chilli fish/ chicken dry and pepper chicken. They are my favourite. The portions are very flexible which is good for a big group as well as a small group. As the place is huge, I never waited outside even in Christmas, puja or weekends.

Lousy food. Never had such badly prepared Hot and Sour Soup. Cheating even in the Himalayan bottled water. On a  MRP of Rs 55/-  (Batch No A15174/2) they charged Rs 66/-. On being asked, the counter clerk retorts that even the beer bottles have MRP on it but they charge extra there also. Manager as usual was conspicuous by his absence. AVOID at all costs. Only for the fact that they cheat like cheap street joints. The management should remember that their clientale is not the kind who would mind paying the correct remuneration - bit cheating is a definite No No. Immensely Avoidable.

Sauntered in tung fong a couple of days back, getting bored having tried the other Chinese joints in the city.
It was a pleasant experience, I guess a change of Guard must have taken place.
One of The few places where complete indianisation of chinese cuisine hasn't taken place.  It has an amazingly suave ambience and prompt and courteous staff.
I would personally recommend to try out The 'mein foon' and The prawn appetizers and side-alongs.

Tung Fong is definitely one of the better options for chinese cuisine in Park Street and the sophisticated,ornated decor alongwith its soothing ambiance offers a perfect option for family gathering for fine dining..I adore the ambiance of this place,so royal,loved the dome..the seatings are extremely comfortable and the interior is huge..don't need to wait behind a long queue like Peter Cat or Mocambo..The service is quite efficient here..I had tasted their buffet lunch several times..though it is economical but nothing special about it..Last time we tried from their a-la carte section..Though the food tastes delicious the steep rates of the dishes do not justify the quantity served..We ordered:
Red Pepper Chicken: Nice,pungent and tangy flavours..
Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish: The quantity was meagre..also it was a bit too salty..
Fried Shrimps: Nice,golden fried pakora..loved the light batter..
Five Spice Chicken: It could have tasted better..though a side dish it was mostly dry..the flavours didn't blend well..
Mandarin Fish: Prepared with fish fillets..loved the flavours..
Alongwith it we ordered Mixed Hakka Chow and Mixed Szechwan Rice tasted decent,nothing great though..
Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.1960/- approx..but felt that we were not as contented as the prices we paid..Its better to try Kim Ling or Mandarin from the same owner at better price and portions..

Nothing to complain about the ambience. Used to love the Chinese there. Had frequented earlier with friends and family before. Had a buffet lunch two days back. It was just just ok. Soup was good. Chicken in black bean sauce tastes good. Sweet and sour fish was fine. Prawn was way down in terms of taste and quality. Even the chicken fried twice didn't live up the expectation. Gear up. Buffet could be avoided.
Taking away few points as they stopped serving drinks from 10:15pm. Service and quality of buffet is completely avoidable

Expenditure/ VFM : 1200 for 2 people
Ambience/Service : Spacious with decent oriental decor. Lighting could be better. Service is good.
What to order: Lunch Buffet

Although I have been to this place a zillion times but here am gonna review their buffet exclusively. 
If you take a look at the buffet, it may not impress you as much as many other places in town with extensively elaborate spreads. But the taste/quality of the food will. That's the beauty of their spread. Limited items, great taste -Right from the soup n starters to their homemade ice cream. Unlike other buffets where you are completely spoilt for choices, and you end up eating a bit if everything without so much realising what you liked most, here you can have each dish to your heart's (read stomach's) content. I strongly recommend this place for Chinese.
P.S.- The weekend spread is very rich with prawns, lamb, fish and chicken.

Tung Fong is one of the best family restaurants in the area. The decor, the ambience and the crowd makes a perfect destination for it. I, along with my cousins had visited the place post Diwali and it was a great experience for all of us. We had decided to order only the starters, and that was really fun. We had taken Chicken Clear Soup, Red Pepper Chicken, Smoked Lamb, Butter Fried Fish, Tung Ding Fried Prawns, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Prawn Wafers. All of them were really good. Butter Fried Fish was the best. It's highly recommended. Later, we couldn't stick to our decision and had ordered a plate of Chicken Meifoon. And that was really yummy. Tung Fong is a wonderful combination of good food and the ambience where you can have nice meal with your family. Next time, when you plan a family dinner, go there. Happy Dining! :)

Tung fong is a good place with a pleasing ambience. Situated just beside Mocambo, this serves mouthwatering Chinese cuisine that will pull you again some day or the other towards it for sure to revisit the restura. Although senior waiters can be better there as the behaviour of one of them there wasn't upto the mark as expected! Moreover, it was good lunching there. :)

I just love dis place...cant really have enough of it. D food n service n also d environment everything scores wonderful here. But my personal favourite is chilly garlic pepper chicken and red pepper chicken in starters. The prices are also not heavy on the pocket...i prefer this one for an authentic Chinese food.

My love for buffets and chinese food and also it was a friends birthday treat so no better reason to dig in.I choose this restaurant cause not many chinese restaurants serve buffet meal.First impression on entering excellent ambience with comfortable seating and a lot of chinese crowd makes you feel you are in china and the authenticity of the cuisine somehow increases.

¬† ¬† ¬†The food though wasn't as stunning as the rest .I'll tell you why. We were served Tom Yum soup which was tasty ,then there was Schezwan potatoes which was nice ,then the Chicken Gold coin was was a complete dissapointment ,crumby and horrible.The chowmein was bland and tasteless though the fried rice was ok.The chiili fish and chilli chicken was good, but still very less items .There was only ice-cream and papaya for desert whereas in other restaurants you get 7-8 deserts.

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†i'll visit this restaurant again for their a-lacarte dishes and hope they wont disappoint again, considering their great reputation.

This place is very inviting. If you are craving for Chinese dishes,authentic that is,make sure you visit this place once. 
Try the ones with not-so-complicated names and you will love it.
The Garlic chicken is too good. ?

Coming here for quite a few years now, Tung Fong lives up to the hype! Everything on their menu is delicious and the soups are soup-erb! :)  
The dishes are moderately to highly priced so a lavish meal for two WONT cost you anything below 1000 bucks. But nevertheless, one of the shining jewels of Park Street!

Though I do not visit kolkata more n often but when I do, I like stopping by this place to savour over a platter f chinese lunch . Im not a big fan of chinese cuisine but when it comes to authentic ones, yep I cant resist to esplore . This is one place where you can check on your budget n eat your heart full at the same time .Chicken dipped in rice wine n their special fried rice is worth paying for . Good service too .

I have had heard a lot about this place. Being enlisted in the Legendary category in zomato, TF had always been in my wishlist.

We did have to wait around half an hour or so before being provided with the table. I do admit, we were late - olmost on the brink of them closing down on the buffet. Once seated, they did come down and ask us if there were things in the buffet that we would like to have more of so that they would ask the chef to make more of it, which was a good gesture as the buffet hours were almost over. The food was good. The decor - awesome. 

However, they do lack in the dessert section - something that I would request them to look into. Ice cream scoops are provided on request only.

Overall : 3.5
Food : 4
Decor : 4

Tung Fong is very conveniently located in Park Street. We went there just before Christmas and the place was bustling with food lovers high on christmas spirits. We had to wait for around 15 mins because of the rush even at 3pm. We decided to go for their lunch buffet, but lunch time was closing in so we had to hurry up. I loved their lunch menu spread out and the chinese flavour in all their dishes. Service was prompt and ambiance was pleasant.
In short it is a lovely place if you are planning to have some authentic Chinese cuisine and want to spend some quality time with your family.

Located on the heart of the city,ParK Street, TunG FonG is special for all chinese food lovers. It serves authentic chinese food and in each dish there is so much of chinese flavour! Tung Fong Chilli Chicken is a must try for starters. In the main course Fried Rice/Noodles with any side dish of chicken or prawn is like a blessing to the taste buds! I specifically prefer Soya Chilli Chicken, Hot Garlic Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Prawns! The Meifoon they serve is also great and of commendable quality. Nice interiors with a nice little touch of China. The service is quite prompt and the ambience is good enough. All in all, it's a great option for u to have authentic chinese cuisine with ur family. Give it a try. You will not be disappointed, i guarantee, Thumps Up! *.*

Visited this place for the first time with my family.
It was lunch time and we decided to have buffet.

Rating division according to me :

Ambiance : 3/5
Service : 4/5
Food : 2.5/5

As the rating goes , Ambiance was soothing and quiet.The interior dome looks nice.

Service was prompt enough. Though we had buffet lunch much service was not needed.

And lastly the food which was not at all upto the mark. The taste , the variety was very poor. Should have opted for ordering rather than going for buffet. The food quality lacked a lot. The chicken was very much hard to eat.¬†
No sweet dish variety at all.Only watermelon was there and darsan was kept. Nothing else. You can get ice cream only 2 SCOOPS and that too ONCE. You cannot order anymore even if it is a buffet.¬†

Well I wouldn't recommend much when there are so many options in Park Street location. Still you can visit and enjoy your lunch for a change.

Happy Eating ! :)

A lovely, well decorated place with ample space so that you can have your food in peace. It serves a huge variety of Indian Chinese food that one is spoilt for choice. I have been to this place time and again and it serves great and yummy food. I like the buffet spread and have ordered a la carte too. They serve a good chicken salad which you will go for more than once. Their Drums of Heaven is worth the name it is heavenly! One dish that is a must try is their Smoked Lamb, it is to die for, the lamb is succulent and tasty. Be it their mixed Sezchwan chow or Kung Pao Chicken the food is orgasmic. Hats off to the service - they always greet you with a smile and after your first visit they never fail to recognize you, their recommendations are good and behaviour impeccable. All in all I love this place.

Went to this place with cousins. Ambiance is good with ample space, which I liked very much. But the food was okay, not as great as I expected. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Fried baby corn and Button mushroom in manchurian sauce. liked the starters well enough. For the main course we had Thai Garlic Chicken and Chilli Garlic Chicken with Mixed Sezchwan Chow and Mixed manchurian Chow. The last two items were quite ordinary, but that may be because we Indians have tried so many Indianised versions of chow that we can hardly tell one Indianised version from another. Besides it appeared as if there were less than required waiters on attendance. Also this place is a bit too pricey compared to the food it serves.

It's off the main Park Street I mean off the main road not much hustle bustle just enough to make u feel that u r in Park Street. Food is authentic Asian, and I mean really authentic and awesome to taste. The best part of this restaurant is obviously the food but one thing else which u don't find on many restaurants these days is space,very spacious and uber comfortable. It's big and well laid out and lot of space to move around considering they have buffet although I prefer ala karte out here. I recently went to BBQ in Park Street only and the sitting arrangements are so cramped that we felt that we all were have food on the same table and you will be sure to rub ur shoulder with ur immediate neighbour if u even stretch a little bit.

The ambiance was very classy, and looked like a proper Chinese restaurant. The layout was designed to be non-invasive and it proved successful.

The service was as expected. The people were courteous and friendly, and their suggestions were perfect.

The food was delectable and I can still feel the taste when I write this review nearly 3 months later.

Typical Indian Chinese. Tables are nicely spaced as against many restaurants in Park Street. Decor well done. Cutlery was found wanting, especially the soup bowls and spoons. The waiters were very courteous and helpful with their suggestion. Ordered Chicken mushroom soup, Manchow Soup, Chicken Hakka noodles, Chicken fried rice, Shanghai Chicken and Chicken in black bean sauce. Loads of MSG, which makes the food very spicy and also not very good for your health.

One of the well known legendary Chinese restaurants in Kolkata that serves typically "Indian Chinese" with a wide variety of items in their big long menu card. From quality and taste perspective it falls in the same bracket of bar-b-q but unlike bar-b-q, they stick to only Chinese. Large space and accommodation of large number of heads simultaneously. Well decorated in white and creamy theme. Good service standard. Extremely consistent service as a whole. Been there many a times and would like to be there again and again.

Considering¬†this restaurant is featured in Legendary category here in Zomato, it is quite easy to access that quality and taste is not something you need to be worried about. Located in Park Street, this is one of the best eateries in the vicinity. Serves great Chinese. Their buffet is something you need to try out for sure. They serve the best darsaan¬†and it is too yummy, to¬†keep coming back for more. I love the Crispy Konje Lamb on their menu. Serice is prompt and fast. Certainly one of the my favourites.

During my visit to Kolkata, this was 1 of the restaurant's that I visited, based on a recommendation from a friend (this being my friend's favorite Chinese restaurant).
Located on Park Street - the haven of best eateries in the city their ambiance is appealing. With a huge dome at the center and a bunch of tables surrounding it, they have ample space, not invading your privacy from the other table.
Their menu is pretty huge for a Chinese restaurant, with the wide range of dishes they have to offer. A treat to a non-vegetarian stomach I can say.
We ordered for a portion of Indonesian Potatoes(based on the recommendation) and an Egg Garlic Fried Rice, both of which which tasted really good. The rice was smooth with good garlic effervescence. Upon asking, they gave me a red-chilli sauce which was nothing like I had tasted before.
The waiters / stewards are quick-to-response and help you with the order as well.

Its located just beside mocambo, looks ordinary from the outside but on the inside its amazing. The ambiance was very good , a quite place nice decor (a very good place for Chinese food loving couples ).

Now, for the food part, we tried the buffet(As we were in a group and few among us including "me" were bulk eaters :D ) . Now the food was damn good ( I usually don't like¬† Chinese, not one of my fav ) . I had the chicken soup,noodles, chicken, prawn, fish. Now, the soup was not too thick not too thin its was of moderate constancy ( in short¬† i liked it a lot ) . The other dishes were also delectable. The chicken and prawn were tongue soothing. Fish was a little ordinary compared to the rest . The only disappointment was the dessert part (as it was only ice-cream :D ) , apart from that there was iced fruits and jasmine tea. Felt nice having the tea after eating so much.

On an overall review its a tasteful place loved the food and ambiance. The price ¬† was moderate . If you like Chinese surely¬† visit this place .

The place has an outstanding location and brilliant basics. You can almost feeling like entering into a British India's elite club while entering, but for that doorman who will not even flinch in attention ( try ignoring it). 

Now coming to food quality, it is definitely authentic, one of the finest in chinese. But alas, tye variety in buffet is sad (try ignoring as buffet price is only 600 odd). Dont forget to try the chicken lollypop while you are at it. Pretty much everything here will have a recipe 100 years old; read all is edible.

However, what i could not ignore (may be you also should not) how grumpy and unfriendly staff they have. They behave as if you are stealing food from them, that it is of enormous privilege just allowing you here. And the behavior remains even if you call the waiter for a lil help on menu( the grumpy face will just come closer, so try avoiding that). And even the table cleaning, water serving boys are no better. 

Bring in crowd, this place is British scale. Try sitting under that Chinese Dome. And most of all try keeping the interaction with staff to bare minimum. And you shall enjoy your outing. Good luck.

I am generally not a chinese food person, but i loved tung fong. Nice ambience (only if u are seated in their ground floor area)  Their sweet corn soup and the crispy american corn was Delicious. Mainly it is for the non-veg as they do not have much of options for the veggies. Their main course was yet again awesome specially the veg manchurian. Would have been a 5 if they had more options on deserts and for veggies.

A beautiful Chinese eatery located at Free school street. It is adjacent to Mocambo and just beside On Track. A well furnished luxurious restaurant with magnificent decorum. It is a big restaurant & is one of the pioneer Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. The staff is always willing to help and very polite. In the food segment I have some personal fav which include the  chicken cashewnuts, Honey chicken (the taste of which can drive one insane) , Szechuan chicken, Szechuan fried rice ( which is a must for me whenever I hit the place), chicken chopsuey, kung pao chicken and many more! The quality of food is undoubtedly good & they serve you decent proportions. This is an expensive eatery & I only hit this place on occasions. I was not into chinese much but Tung Fong made me fall in love with the cuisine. Hit the place if you're/aren't a fan of Chinese, at Tung Fong you are going to love it anyway. :)

There cantonese style noodles are some of the best in kolkata. Also their sort of signature dish tung fong chicken. So soft it melts in your mouth. Don't be worried about the spicy üå∂ symbols. Food isn't that spicy. As always the park street area prices will surprise you when the bill comes

Great place for chinese foods. Foods are delicious, interior is spacious and well decorated. Inspite of its location just beside Moccambo, its a place that has achieved its own name with its authentic chinese platter.

A restaurant worth visiting.

Discovered this joint on 10 June, 2002, when I was with my mother at Park Street. Was 12 years old then. Loved the ambience, service and food. Still remember the televisions showing FIFA World Cup matches. Tung Fong undoubtedly deserves to be among the top 5 Chinese restaurants in Calcutta.

Drums of Heaven used to come with sliced cucumbers but not now. Loved the little umbrellas they provided with various desserts. Out and out, a brilliant shop. 

Dined on 14 February, 2015. My memories got jolted. Would love visiting this place over and over again.¬†

You might not want to come here at 4pm. The kitchen break starts then.

Tung Fong is probably the best Chinese restaurant in Park Street..the food is pretty decent and not very expensive. The service can be a tad slow owing to the number of patrons they serve simultaneously. Nice ambience and decent fare!

I was quite impressed by the ambiance of this place, especially the golden carved dome . It is actually a huge restaurant with lots of seating capacity. Actual Calcutta Chinese rarely visit Chinese restaurants other than the hand full of small joints in the interiors of tangra. Tung Fong has been around for a while now, but this was my first visit there, the maintenance was good. Staff was a little rude, especially in the seating. Being from the hospitality industry myself from the past 18 years, i recommended a table to the staff for us to sit and after making a lot of excuses, he also realized that the table i recommended was by then not only the best option but ¬†by then also the only option. Menu was thrown at us and the captain came very soon to take the order, order was placed and the food arrived soon enough. Food portions were good and taste was just like most other indianised Chinese restaurants (as the market demands it to be). Price was a little on the higher side, which is accepted due to its location. I owed a visit once to this place but don't think would go back there again, as the same things are available at lower prices at other places.

Ambience: One of the best in the City!
Service: In one word: Pathetic( since the waiter arrived at our table after 45mins)
Food: Since the service completely spoiled my mood, i don't think i could enjoy the food as much. My friend ordered beer and a chicken starter which was good. Coming to the main course, quantity is not at all in par with the high price. In fact one plate of rice/noodles is not sufficient for one person. We ordered schezwan rice which i personally didn't enjoy. The chicken preparation alongside wasnt bad though. 
Total bill came at rs 1500
P.s. I don't think i will visit this place again

Visited tungfung after about 3 years, for a family lunch.
The place was uncrowded in the late lunch hours and we were forced to take a corner table,though few of the centre tables were occupied by group of 4's.WAITORS ARE ALWAYS ARROGANT.

The food portions are so less here, at the same rates as bar-b-q, serving a quarter of their quantity!
The orders arrived in just 15 minutes.
We had,
Mixed Manchurian noodles
Mixed chilli garlic noodles
Mixed fried rice
sanghai Chicken
Kung pao chicken
Sweet & sour fish
The rice and noodles were good enough, but the side dishes tasted great! Daddy loved the fish, i personally felt the kung pao was the best..have it for starters, as they make it dry.
The portions and the pricing does not match up, hence the rating!

Neighboring restaurant to Mocambo , this restaurant doesn't deserve as much applause as it gets . Every dish we tried were horrible and the waiters were clumsy and absent minded. The decor is the only thing stopping me from rating it lesser . The nail to the coffin was offering Hals along with the bill. Thoroughly dissatisfied.

Food is good and pricey. I liked the decor but i don't like the fact that despite paying so much money most of the soups come with plastic spoons or on plastic cups. When they give the accompaniments they r coming out of bottle or plastic containers. Doesnt go down well with the standard of your resturant. Please look into these matters.

This Chinese stalwart at the heart of the foodies' paradise serves some gorgeous consumables. Basically a family restaurant, this place always carries a jibe that brings a lot of life. My experience has been wonderful each time I've had a chance to manoeuvre this place. The Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken Drumsticks are popular dishes out here and is sinful to miss out on. The Chinese feeling inside the restaurant is an instant attraction. The ever-courteous waiters and quirky ambience only adds to the class and authenticity of this Park Street biggie.

Visited Tung Fong with friends for the first time. Usually a big time Bar B Q fan and regretting changing my usual place at Park Street to this one. Food mediocre, however Vegetarian Manchurian Fried Rice was out of the world and the flavour was just perfect.. Prawn Fried Wonton was also spot on ! Chilli Garlic Chicken & Schezwan Fish was just very very mediocre in taste and I couldn't differentiate the gravy of any of them. Mixed American Chopseuy lacks any kick or flavour, very bland ¬†- only Hatari can nail it properly...¬†

Now why 1.5?

I assume Tung Fong & Mocambo has same Management as it was evident from the lack of skilled staffs. We entered and ordered something in 5 mins as the staffs made us feel seriously rushed and UNCOMFORTABLE...Then when we told them we will order the mains later as we are waiting for a friend, they keep on coming back to us and stared at us blankly as if you order or leave. Note that already one dish as starter has been ordered. Finally we could place the order. One of the waiters took the dish of Fish away from the table without even asking my friend. Their attitude was seriously horrendous..We were so damn annoyed with the behaviour, we decided to speak with the Manager, and we were told Manager or Duty Manager are all busy with work ! Never seen such awful indecent behaviour. To everybody who has showered them with praises, I have just one question...Will you go and pay somewhere with such shitty and awful service??? If you still want to go to this place, hats off to your Self Respect !!!! Go to bar b q if you want the same Chinese, you will never regret ! Tung Fong - Stop giving crappy reasons to customers about managers..You just made yourself a bigger fool infront of us .and your place is not the most sought after Chinese place either in town.. So work on your attitude !

Have walked past this place on several occasions but had never stepped in. However, we finally went there for a b'day dinner.

It has a nice appearance on the outside and an even more impressive and classy look on the inside. The place comprises of two floors - Ground floor which is usually meant for families while the first floor is usually occupied by business groups and/or men's groups.

The pricing is quite decent given the kind of place this is. The food is really tasty and is quite close to being authentic Chinese. The waiters are well-mannered and the service is decently quick. For two people, the bill may be around INR 2000 (incl. starters, main course, dessert).

It's definitely a place recommended for a casual dining either with family or friends.

I've visited Tung Fong 3 times and on different occasions. .1st on my mom's reunion with her college mates, 2nd on my bff's birthday treat and 3rd on a lunch date with my boyfriend. The first time itself I was taken by surprise since there's hardly an occasion when I've not heard about an authentic chinese restaurant serving well above average food and that too in the heart of Park Street. Tung Fong can well be denoted as a rescue zone when u have been disappointed by mocambo's long queue of waiting customers and your turn might come 1 hour later. Just next door to Mocambo reigns Tung Fong and once you enter through the gates greeted by a smiling door keeper you get a warm and welcoming feeling that makes you forget any prior disappointments.
Now coming to the food, its better to opt for a la carte since the options at the buffet counter are quite common and their qualities are also compromised to some extent. The a la carte is more special..made with care and you can opt for various varieties. And the prices are also quite reasonable..a full five course meal (drinks, soup, starters, main course and dessert) for two will cost you not more than rs. 2500. Overall a fulfilling experience..... :)

We , a group of four friends went to this famed restaurant on 25th of DEC this year. First of all we had to wait for about 35-40 mins outside the restaurant because of the crowd. We ordered some normal hakka noodles, rice noodles and Shanghai chicken. The food wasn't extraordinary. It was good. The chicken was properly cooked and spiced although we found the spices to be very similar to Indian spice. The waiter service was awesome and along with the ambience of the restaurant we felt like having some rajshahi khanna. The amount of food was not appropriate.

Location: Adjacent to Mocambo, Park street. 

This place had been on my wish list for a long time and it always happened so that I couldn't visit it for some or the other reason! Finally visited it yesterday, January 1, 2015 ! New year, 2k15 has finally brought me the chance to visit it. Lol. 
Reached here at around 7:30pm and it was crowded like crazy. Had to wait for a couple of minutes before being seated. 

Tung Fong is a G+Mezzanine type restaurant. On entering, the Chinese-style wall case in the front and the interiors on the whole immediately caught my eye. The pillar designs inside have been thoughtfully carved out of plaster of paris in order to match the set up. I was seated at the mezzanine floor. The wooden dragon carving at the flight-end of the staircase looked great. The mezzanine floor was a bit more lit up than the ground floor and had wall-side spotlights along with PoP-decked up walls. 
The ambiance was soothing, calm and did notch up the experience. 

About the FOOD, after a bit of contemplating and waiting for a server for around fifteen minutes ordered the following: 

- Indonesian Potatoes (Half)
The potatoes were sliced and tossed in schezwan sauce along with thinly sliced onions. The dish was inclined towards the spicy end as indicated in the menu. Tasted as expected! 
Recommended. 

- Hakka Noodles (Veg)
The noodles was perfectly boiled and wok-tossed with fresh veggies. Well-seasoned except that it was a bit low on salt.

- Mix Vegetables in Shangai Sauce (Half)
The usual veggies and exotic veggies were found to be fresh and juicy. The sauce as told by the server was to be inclined towards a high spicy nature, but had the lack of it. Was mildly spiced. 

‚Ä¢ The side dish (Mix veg in Shanghai sauce) was inclined towards an oily nature i.e. The oil content was comparatively high. 
‚Ä¢ Full and half dish options available. 

About the SERVICE, it was found to be quite slow and on enquiry, was told that as the crowd level is high, the service has gone down. C'mon management, your restaurant is counted amongst the best ones in Kolkata and thus, experiences such a high footfall on a regular basis... And, still say you couldn't manage the crowd and let your service quality fall? Disappointed.

About the STAFF, they were found to be well-uniformed and courteous yet, had an ignorant and lackadaisical attitude. To top it all, the ending note by the server or manager (the staff in the black suit) whoever he was turned me off completely! My bill amounted to a few tens less than 1200 INR (including liquor) and left a tip of exactly 150 INR above the change left of 1200 INR (keeping in mind that it was the first day of new year plus the 10% tipping norm). Even after a total tip of nearly 200 INR, the person asks me to tip more! HOW DISGUSTING AND GREEDY AN ATTITUDE HE HAD! More over the audacity to keep asking for more. I think the tip was way above 10% of the total bill and was good enough. I left without a word in silence and shock. A bad ending to the good experience! 

A moderately priced place.

Overall was a near-average experience!
- Would have rated it 4.5 with respect to food, minus 1 due to the staff conduct and slow service.

The Parkstreet area‚Äôs very famous Tung Fong restaurant serves not only excellent food but also the entire servicing is great; you surely want to be there again and again. The whopping menu of the restaurant is full with various yummy fish food items, steam chicken preparations, prawn toasts, chili crabs, soups, butter mushrooms and many more. When I am in the restaurant I get confused as there are so many options, last time when I was there with my cousins I ordered whole steam fish whose supple fish pieces were simply awesome melting in mouth. In starters we chose prawn spring rolls and some veg pakora. Among rice items my favourite was egg garlic fried rice and with that we had Manchurian lamb. The lamb went very well with the rice. I was ecstatic that my cousins were very happy and satisfied with the food culture in Kolkata. It is impressive that the restaurant has so many food items on their menu so that people would have choices. Apart from rice the restaurant offers chow, rice noodles etc. And they have also taken care of the vegetarians as they offer items like veg Manchurian, chili garlic baby corn, Manchurian paneer, garlic paneer, fried baby corn and many more. Among deserts we preferred strawberry ice cream which completed the whole meal.

There was item named smoked lamb, i ate minimum 20 of them, it was that tasty. Coming to desert, I am disappointed because they serve only 2 types of fruit and only 2 scopes of ice cream. Ice cream is limited but you will fall in love with it. Amazing food, good and fast service, ambiance is also very good.

Excellent food. Very nice decor. Professional service. Value for money. The pot of green tea was bottomless, meaning they kept refilling it. Chinese tea is a great comfort drink. At the end they had a sort of wash towel which was placed on the plate as a small tablet and the waiter stylishly poured hot water out of a kettle on top of it¬† and before our very eyes it became the wet towel it was supposed to be! That was impressive especially after a satisfying lunch and one could just sit back and relax. The restaurant is spacious and gives a sense of calm. As always, though Bengali waiters need to become more professional and less familiar. For restaurant owners, may be this can be looked at. Being back in this state after many years of living abroad and in other cities, it makes even me, a die-hard Bengali, uncomfortable at its best and outraged at its worst. The respectful distance the waiter should maintain, the courteous was he should reply to querries about food, the warmth and alacrity with which the guest should be served- they are lacking in the Kolkata waiter, especially if he is a Bengali. It's a shame that even the most wonderful food tastes bad when served by an obnoxious waiter.

Went there with my family and relatives for a Saturday Brunch.. we got the buffet, my parents had come by and tried this out before and kept singing praises and after finding this restaurant in the "legendary" section of Zomato, I had BIG hopes...However, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The buffet started of with drink which was a choice of sweet lime, beer and soft drinks. I got the Sweet lime which was good. Then the starters which included Chicken Momos, Schezwan Fried Chicken and Aloo Tikki all three were good enough, but once agai nnothing extraordinary. The Main course had a range of veg and non-veg varieties. Let me start with the good ones, the fried rice, noodles, salad and Schezwan paneer were good.. I did not like how the prawns were served with the skin of the tail intact kept getting crunchy bits in my mouth, not a nice feeling, the vegetable and tofu were bland, the fish was too oily..¬†
The highlight of my luncheon was definitely the Jasmine tea which i greatly enjoyed! I was so fascinated to find that tucked away in a corner, it was like a hidden treasure being a tea fanatic I loved the sweet aroma of the hot jasmine tea along with my food. A unique concept which I only found here.. the dessert was also good included choice of ice creams; vanilla, strawberry and chocolate.

Worth a shot I guess but I have had better chinese food in Kolkata..

Tung Fong, while a little pricey, especially when it comes to drinks, has the best Chinese food available in Kolkata. The place has a classic and clean cut look and has excellent service.

I was looking for a good Chinese restaurant in Kolkata ¬†and after reading the reviews of the place I went with my family for dinner. The Chicken Mushroom soup ¬†was very good, so were the spring/pepper prawns and chili garlic pepper fish. However the main ¬†course was highly disappointing, the chicken fried rice was very bland and the mandarin fish was not up to the mark. Though the chicken in black bean sauce was decent but nothing exceptional. There are many other places ¬†where you get much better "Chinese" food, or may be I did not choose the "correct dishes" ¬†for which they get such good reviews.

Just wow.
A good place for fine dine.

Located on the park street opposite to punj-aab. Food was great.
Ambiance was awesome and best part was size of each serving.

Totally worth every penny spent.

Visited this place with my dad as he is a regular and kept raving about the place since the day I landed in Kolkata. We got the lung fung soup to start off and it was super. We then ordered the chilli garlic pepper chicken per our waiters recommendation. It was simply amazing and turned out to be my fav dish of all the things I ordered. The portion, the flavors.....,everything was perfect. We ordered the  masala soda to wash everything down. For entrees, we ordered prawn chowmein n ginger fish and the amount of prawns n the way it was cooked... was quite impressed. If you are not big eater, you can get half size entrees. We ordered fish munchurian for to go and some more Chowmein and it tasted just as great later. The only thing I found annoying was people's cell phone ringing every so often ... that I could have done without. Great service, great food n fabulous Chinese food right in the heart of Kolkata. I will definitely go back to Tung Fung 
next time I am in town....

I love going to Tung Fong ! Located in the heart of the city Tung Fong has evolved to become one of the best places to enjoy a delicious and authentic Chinese meal. I have gone for the buffet a number of times and i have also stopped by randomly at the restaurant for lunch and dinner. Overall every experience has been absolutely delightful . Though the place may not be pocket friendly as such i can assure you its worth your hard earned money !

I don't know the meaning of tung fong, but i am sure that whatever it might be is really tasty. Been to that place couple of times. Recently Went to that place with a special one and on a special day. The feel we got just the moment we entered there was just amazing. The decor is really something else. Its attraction will lure you to order everything on the menu just to sit at this place for as long as possible. I gave it an extra .5 marks for its decor. Anyways proceeding to the food. It was really good. I mean not a particular one every item was really nice. We opted for an buffet. Every item was present. The most attracting item was the dragon chicken. Beside that soup, noodles, rice, fish, prawn & chicken item was there. Veg & non veg portion were separately placed. Everything was really very tasty. Each item satisfied our taste bud. Our taste bud was at its blissful moment. At last in the desert segment there was one sweet item, peeled apple, banana & papaya. They also offered tea. But in my opinion one thing was missing from the items what they have offered, & that's an ice-cream. I mean it would have been very nice of them if they could have taken this into their consideration. But as everybody says no one is perfect. Well i am really happy this place & planning soon to visit again very soon.

The place heralded Chinese authenticity like none other. It was amazingly spacious & brilliantly lit with beautiful chinese decor. The centre of the restaurant holds a raised platform on which few tables are placed. We were seated on one of them. The service was very prompt and efficient as it took no more than five minutes to serve the starters, soups and drinks.
The food was no less than pure delight. All the dishes were exceedingly sumptous and beyond our expectations. Every component of the food was precisely cooked to the right extent which highly contributed to the overall taste. 

Conclusion: A must visit and a must re-visit.

If you are in Park street and specially going past a legendary restaurant like Tung Fong which has been there loudly, firmly, steadily for quite sometime, then it is very hard to ignore it. You may hate it or love it but just can't ignore it.¬†
We were actually heading for On Track on a lovely enjoyably cold Sunday evening, but we found it closed ( fortunately!!) and then didn't wait for a second invitation to go straight into Tung Fong which also has been there in my wishlist for sometime.¬†

Ambiance/Decor - At first glance the decor and ambiance looked big, grandeur was simple and impressive at the same time. This is not a fancy decor, I guess very much traditional and old days kind of Chinese decor.¬†
Rating - 4/5

Service - No one came up to attend us, we found our own table to sit. Then someone came up and told us to relocate to another table for two. They seemed uninterested and reluctant to attend us, probably they were too busy to finish their just finished ( or yet to finish, may be) buffet related works.¬†
Rating - 2.5/5

Food - Ahh....Food was good, real good. We ordered risk free Chicken Drumstick, Mixed Rice Noodles and Kun Pao Chicken. Tasty, tangy, crispy, flavour full - that's our food was. Drumstick was fatty chicken legs batter fried with distinct garlic flavour in it. Outside was crispy. Mixed rice noodles was tasty and flavourful, lightly spiced and full of chicken and egg pieces. Kun Pao Chicken was dry item, very tangy and spicy. Each and every item was probably not authentic Chinese but suitable to our Indian palate. I guess half plate is sufficient for two.¬†
Rating - 5/5
Overall experience was great and We would certainly give it another try or may be many more tries again. Their buffet lunch is something I still wish for and will definitely find it out very soon. Pocket pinch was also ¬†moderate, we were billed 745 with all taxes.

Been to this place recently. The type of food they serve are a breather from the cliched spread in the other restaurants nearby. Its a decent place with sumptuous food. Though the price may be a pinch in the pocket. Recomended are the different types of soups they serve and also the prawn wantons.

I have had high expectations about this food destination, but not totally impressed after a visit here. Two of us got a seat near the passage way to washroom which was changed without much hassle and a request post explanation from our end. Hospitality has much room for improvement here. Taste of food was fine but every time we had to ask for service whenever a had dish arrived. Also I got to know from them that they do not serve Thai cuisine, though it is listed in Zomato. Not sure in which end it needs to be corrected. In short, if you love only and only Chinese cuisine, you can pay a visit there.

Located just beside Mocambo, this place has established its name with conviction among the best chinese restaurants in the town. It has got almost everything, ranging from vast carpet area to majestic decor. According to my experience it is one of the most luxuriously decorated chinese restaurants in kolkata. I have been to this eatery a several times and i have never been dissapointed. Though i can't say it has given me any kind of overwhelming experience. They offer a wide variety of chinese delicacies and the quality of their dishes are above average. Though i haven't tried out all of their offerings but according to my experience the dishes like- "kung pao chicken", "cahsew chicken", etc are one of their best presentations. There are uncountable chinese restaurants in kolkata but the special qualities which seperates them from tung fong is its esteem ambience, vast and well organised layout, rich decor and courteious behavior of the waiters. So if you are nearby parkstreet and a chinese cuisine buff and along with that wanna enjoy your meal in a luxurious manner and environment without tolerating too much of a pocket pinch then "Tung Fong" is the ideal place for you.

Located just next to Mocambo , Tung Fong ,as the name suggests, is one of the famous Chinese eateries in Park street.

Ambiance: Well-lit and quite spacious , it is more of a big diner hall. Decoration is classic Chinese without much of a fuss.¬†

Food: Went there in a group of 5.We decided to opt for the buffet since we had some gluttons in our group. Initially, we were quite disappointed to see that the spread was not much.But the quality of the food was simply outstanding. Starters were not much -2 soups(1 Veg ,1 Non veg) , 3 Starters(2 veg-1 Non veg) but almost all the dishes were worth having twice.¬†
About 4-5 salads were there.
The main course had rice,noodles,tofu, mixed veg, chicken, prawn, fish. Except tofu, each one of the dishes were palatable.Tofu was a little too spicy to my liking.
The desert had assorted fruits & ice-cream.
However, the complimentary drink and ice-cream were only a single serve( a little disappointing for us :( ! )

Service : ¬†Service was prompt and courteous and ¬†Overall, the buffet price was 600(including tax) on a weekday for lunch . Considering the price , we were quite happy with the entire arrangement.

So today I finally crossed this place out of my wish list. There was a pretty decent crowd for an weekday afternoon, wasn't expecting that. The room is well-lit and spacious. Gives you the posh feeling. We decided on an ala-carte as the buffet menu didn't look much exciting. The Tung fong prawns and chilli garlic prawns were the Pick of the lot. Mixed rice noodles was pretty much like those that you have at other places and the kung-pao chicken was a little spicy. The service was good and the food didn't take much time to reach, which again wasn't expected. Coming to the price, it was less than what I was hoping. All in all a great experience for me here.

Location: Tung fong is located at park street surrounded by famous eateries.
Decor: from outside I did not expect such a big hall inside. The decor inside is sobre and nice. No overdoing.
We entered at around 1.15pm on a weekday,when the hall was pretty empty. By the time we left at around 2.30pm the place was almost full!
Food: we opted for a-la-cart. The prawn-starters -- like tung fong fried prawn and chilli pepper garlic prawn are awesome.
Meifoon is good, but can be better,also the portion of egg,chicken,prawn in meifoon is less,I feel. Taste is no doubt good. Kung pao chicken was great. The flavors of the spices can actually be felt till the end of taste buds:)
We do not like their idea of giving chlormint as mouthfreshner!
Service: nothing worth mentioning. The waiting time for food is pretty long. (The aroma of the place actually increased our hunger: P)
Price: a bit on higher side, but I felt its quiet worth it.

Tung Fong was a reasonably good alternative for Chinese stuff especially if Bar B Q next door was packed. The interior is a little caddish - it's more of a hall than a diner. However, the food is quite nice and authentic - they cover all the standard Indian Chinese dishes. This may not be the first choice of a¬†diner in Park Street but you will never be disappointed.

After a really long time had the loveliest chinese food. The order was simple, chicken wanton, Crab Foo Yoong, mixed garlic rice noodles, Thai fish and chicken with babycorn and mushroom. The servings were swift, ambience wonderful and above all each of the food was awesome, great taste, served hot & fresh, reasonably good quantity and worth the pay.

One small suggestion ; I really did not like the end of meal choloromint offering, a little fennel could have done wonder.

Food: I had ordered the Tung Fong Fried Chicken, Butter Fish Finger, Kung Pao Lamb and the Mixed Chilli Garlic Chow, during my recent visit to this restaurant. Apart from the fried chicken, which was just perfectly done, and perhaps the lamb, I was not quite overwhelmed with the food. The chicken was boneless, soft, while the covering was quite crisp. Served with sweet garlic sauce, and a slice of lemon, it was the perfect accompaniment to a pint of cold beer. The lamb too was well-cooked, and soft. However, for the price they charge, I was not too happy with the quantities served. A dinner for 2 came to around Rs 1500.

Service: The service was just about alright. Mostly, a little confused and slow, with the service staff shuffling around the place without attending to customers promptly

Ambience: Loved the decor. Very spacious and unique. However, there weren't too many patrons around (it was just around 7 pm), and it was perhaps a bit too quiet.

Overall verdict: Mediocre to good food, good ambience, indifferent service and over-priced food.

This Chinese restaurant is located right next to the famous Mocambo Resturant on Free School Street.
On a first look of Tung Fong it appears to be a very spacious and well decorated restaurant,drawing your eyes towards the wall carvings;most of the times.
Now coming to the food....it was definitely not the best of the Chinese foods I've tasted till date.Still the better part of the starters and main course would consist of something like the chinese garlic pepper prawn,cantonese noodles,mein foon and mandarin chicken respectively.For sweet tooth one can definitely go for the various ice creams diaplayed on the menu card.
Tung Fong particularly impressed me more with its decoration than the food.It is a good family restaurant and offers a lot of space for huge groups.
My earnest request to the restaurant management authority is to fasten the service.Also after having food in so many Chinese restaurants across Calcutta I feel that restaurant authorities really don't do much to introduce authentic Chinese sweet dishes in their menu card.
Maybe taking  a better step can bring about a change in the typical Chinese Menus we opt for at these restaurants.

Its definitely not the best chinese in town but a good restaurant all together. They have got an extensive menu and the place is huge so you would generally get a seat. The food doesn't taste authentic. Their thai food is pretty good and one should definitely try it out.

Been there many times. Love the food there specially kung pao lamb. Buffet is value for money. Unfortunately had a bad experience there last year when my wallet was stolen from the table and later recovered by one of the other customer from the ladies wash room though no one from our table went to the wash room that evening and my wallet went missing after I had made the payment. So be careful with your belongings there

Awesome chinese food indeed. Quality is good and the ambiance is also very good for any family outing. Must visit place who loves to eat chinese. Kung pao chicken is always favourite. Tried hot garlic fish and it was delicious. As per me fried rice is much better than the noodles. 
Go and have it.

I've been to Tung Fong only a couple of times but both times were nice and homely..tried all vegetarian items though but loved the taste except couple of items was a little too oily...mocktails were soothing ¬†in taste as well...staff is friendly and the service of the food is fast.
A decent place with above average food

It rarely happens that i dont like Chinese food. But this was one of those rare occasions. The place is well located and the ambiance is decent. The same cannot be said about their food though. The chicken hot and sour soup that i ordered was pathetic. I have never had a worse soup than the one they served. It just tasted weird. The next dish i ordered was the drums of heaven. This was decent enough but it was not hot. The chilli fish and the veg noodles were just about alright and i left feeling cheated when i saw the bill. Very expensive and not worth the money. Certainly not a place id be going back to.

Well, my very first buffet @park street and i had high expectations from this one, but it failed to impress ! While some of the food items were great , the rest of them werent impressive! The non veg main course is a must have while the dishes in veg course were a let down! 

The appetizers had drums of heavnen an veg wontons! 
Drums of heaven were just okayish and one of the pieces i had, was little raw from inside! Veg wontons were oily and more of thr crispy crust part than the vegetarian stuffing! 
The main course( non veg): prawns and fish were delectable! Great taste! The chicken preparation was marvellous! I loved it! Chicken fried rice on the other hand had rubbery chunks of chiken ad wasnt that good! 
Veg course: potatoes were really spicy! I had to gulp oodles of water and sweet lime soda after that! So was the cottage cheese preparation! The tofu dish was good, however nothing tastes better than ma-po tofu and i wished it was in the dish! The green veggies preparation ( along with babycorn and mushroom) was one good dish! I had it with steamed rice! Great! 
There were 3 soups: i had the prawns soup , which was more of a tom yum flavour but bit more spicy and tangy in flavors! With bamboo shoots, prawns, mushroom and cottage cheese, the soup was delicious! The sweet corn soup on the other hand was a let down! 

In the desserts: only darsaan and 2 fruits! I had better darsaan somewhere else, so this one definitely wasnt upto the mark! On asking the service guy regarding more in the deserts, he told ice cream so we ha chocolate ice cream! 
Its a decency to tell what shall be served on the table and what is in the spread! But none of the service guys bothered to do that! Its a flop show in terms of service! 

If you are at park street and want to have buffet, then only the non veg pan asian delicacies would be a good choice to try here! 
Overall a 3.5/5

This restaurant has that authentic-chinese-food-smell which i search inside every chinese restaurant. Order anything and can enjoy genuine chinese flavour.

One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the town. This one has it all, from ambiance to service to quality food. You name it and you have it. Tung Fong is a place where I have visited many times. So I would combine a couple of latest experiences to give you a review of this restaurant.
To start with - you cannot miss this place, Located in Park street. The moment you enter you realize that you have entered the right place. The restaurant is very spacious and has a brilliant decor. Staff is very courteous and service is very prompt.
¬†Now coming to the all important - FOOD. Right from soups , starters to mains and desert - the food is just excellent.
Here are my picks - Chili garlic pepper prawns, Thai soup, Schezwan & manchurian - chicken/fish, cantoneese noodles, meinfoon.
If you love chinese food, visit this place.

Probably the most delicious Chinese food in Kolkata is served here. Less crowded than a lot of other restaurants in Park Street. So if you are searching for economical place with a classy ambience in the festive days without having to stand in a queue for hours, this is your bet. However the stag section serves food that seemed less tasty to me and also the ambience is not great there.

Me and some of my friends had gone couple of days back. We had to wait for some time as it was crowded.¬†
We ordered chicken mushroom soup, crispy baby corn with honey and for the main course, ¬†mixed hakka chowmein and kung pao chicken.
The food was delicious and worth the wait !!¬†
The place is bit expensive but the food makes up for it :)
The staff was very cordial and the service was quick.
Kung pao chicken is a must try, do not give it a miss !
Well , the ambiance is nice and this can be definitely the place you would like to go with friends or family for ¬†a delicious weekend dinner or lunch .

After seeing the long queue outside Mocambo we decided to have our dinner at Tung Fong at around 8 pm yesterday (Saturday, 30th August). We were 8 people and we thankfully got a table here after waiting for 5 minutes.

We were all really very hungry and started deciding upon what we wanted.
So, now coming to the food we ordered :-
1) Non veg mixed thai soup (Family portion, 343/-) : The family portion serves 4 people but they made it 5 for us. The soup was spicy and had bits of mushroom, chicken, eggdrop and crab meat. It was a spidy delight.

2) Chicken Mushroom Soup (1 into 2, 107/-) : We wanted chicken sweet corn soup but as it wasn't available we had to order this. It had mushroom, chicken and eggdrop but it was a bit too bland.

3) Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken (1 and a half plates, Rs.348+210 = 558/-) : Spicy pieces of chicken having a nice garlic flavour with a crispy outer portion and soft juicy inside. Really good.

4) Butter fried fish finger (1 and a half plates ; Rs.435+240 = 675/-) : Their fried items had a bit less salt. The fish was fresh and flaky with a soft outer coating. It was accompanied by butter sauted beans and carrots and french fried which was sauted potato strips. Altogether a very good and a dish with subtle flavours.

5) Golden Fried Prawns ( 2 plates ; Rs.926√ó2= 1852/-) : 6 large pieces of prawns (per plate) nicely coated and deep fried. As mentioned earlier, they were a bit low on salt content. The prawns were very fresh and were of brilliant quality.

Now coming to the main course,
6) Mixed Hakka Chowmein (2 plates ; Rs.164x2 = Rs.328) : It was very well made and tasted delicious. Many restaurants make hakka noodles with a lot of oil but surprisingly here, the oil content was less and was brilliant to taste.

7) Mixed Fried Rice (2 plates ; Rs.164x2= 328/-) : Though everyone liked it, I found it to lack the smokey flavour. Anyhow, it tasted good.

8) Dry Chilli Chicken (1 and a half plate ; Rs.348+210 = Rs.558) : Really liked it.

9) Dry Chilli fish (1 and a half plate ; Rs.435+240 = Rs.675) : The fish was amazing and flaky but it was a bit too dry and was just fried chilli fish. A very good dish, though.

10) Kung Pao Chicken (Rs.348, 1 plate) : Chicken strips and cashews tossed in a tangy thick sauce. Loved it.

11) Fresh lime soda : ( 4 portions, Rs.51x4 = 204/-) : This helped us to digest our food and was pretty nice. Just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness and lemon juice.

12) Tutti Fruity ( 5 portions, Rs. 168√ó5 = Rs.840) : We wanted to have Darsan or toffee walnut but neither of the two were available. So we had to order Tutti Fruity. I did not like it at all. 2 scoops of vanilla and strawberry each with canned pineapple and another weird tasting fruit which was canned too. No cherries or strawberries or nuts. Absolutely disgusting.

Mineral water here costs Rs.40 per bottle.
The staff here are courteous and humble.
They starters arrived within 8 mins and the main course arrived withing 15 mins which was pretty fast. The food was satisfying.
The total cheque was Rs. 6927.00 + 935.40 (14% V.A.T) + 342.47 ( Service chage 4.944% ) = Rs.8205.00
It is an expensive place but the food and ambience makes up for it.

The washroom is however, awfully bad. The flush doesn't work and a very bad odour (Ammonia) comes out from it.
So I would deduct 0.5 from the rating because a dirty washroom is just not acceptable in such a fine dining restaurant.

Overall, a good experience.
Recommended.
Happy eating. :D

It was a memorable visit to Tung Fong.Though the prices are a little high, they keep good value for money;by providing excellent cuisines and service.The amount of food is quite a lot and you will feel that you have spent your money justifiably (sometimes it may be too overwhelming!!). The interior propriety is very well maintained and quite pleasing to your eyes.This place is often over looked due to the presence of even more famous Mocambo and Peter Cat beside it.I had just a lovely experience to this place.The food remains stuck to your mind for a long time.

The place is a worth visit a lot of times. I have not been to this place a lot but yeah a couple of times. Chinese food at its best I can say. The ambiance , the decor, the food, the waiters are all so good here.
Tried wonton chicken with a couple of Heineken beer and then had American mixed chopsuey and i loved it a lot. Chopsuey being one of my favourite dish i have tried it at a lot of restaurants but tung fong was the best i ever tried. sanghai fish , crab meat with pakchoi , red pepper or sezuan or sanghai lambs are some of the best here.
Prices are very very reasonable. 1000 + tax for two.
Waiting to visit again.

Being a foodie, I had actually been to a lot of restaurants, in Kolkata as well as Bangalore, but sadly, never had a chance to try out a buffet in Kolkata...
I had been to almost all the restaurants in Park street, but dunno how I missed this one. So, last year , me and my friends decided to meet up here and have Chinese food. 
Well, people say, for authentic Chinese food in Kolkata, the best place is China Town. I beg to differ, coz Tung Fong serves you amazing Chinese food. 
We ordered cocktails, gravy mixed noodles, grilled fish and chilli chicken and each one of them tasted so good. I would like to recommend this to every one...Go and visit...if you love Chinese food.

And so, after all the rave reviews on zomato, I went with my family today for lunch.The good things are the space( it's large),nice decor.The food is good but definitely not great.The quantity is ok.Pocket pinch was about Rs 2500 which is quite reasonable(we were 5 people...ordered Cantonese chicken chow,chicken fried rice,kung pao prawns,chilli chicken & 2 breezers)But I did not like their service.First they never bothered to ask whether we would like buffet or a la carte.Then the worst part.They served all the side dishes and 1 fried rice and 1 chow at a time.After that they served rest of the order(4 chow) after 15 mins.after our reminders.So I would definitely visit China town next time for great food and mainland china for great food & service...

It is sad to write a negative review for Tung Fong , which used to be one of my childhood cravings and even 5 ‚Äì 10 years back was one of the cornerstones of Park Street Chinese dining places.

But , I guess industrialized lunch buffets and shopping mall low quality food courts are indeed taking a toll on places like Tung Fong.

I went for the lunch buffet on the 15th of August , thinking , it would be the best choice with my family to shift the taste a little beyond the usual Mainland China lunch buffet.

I was very disappointed with the whole setup. Food items not being replenished in time , long queue of guests waiting with their plates , very little co-ordination between kitchen team and the waiters etc ..

Not sure if it is a systemic problem Tung Fong faces , or was it just the mismanagement of the lunch buffet.

The buffet spread remained wide and boasted a strong menu. 2 soups (veg , non-veg) , 3-4 veg main course and prawn , fish and chicken preparations (one each). For starters , veg wanton and chicken lollipop.

The saddest part was that all 3 sauces of the prawn , chicken and fish almost tasted the same ‚Äì with a rich garlic flavour , accentuated with a strong vinegar-acidic taste. Surprisingly , the colour of the sauce even were almost the same reddish-brown.

With 600 rupees a person , this was clearly not something which I enjoyed with my family.

A dismal 2.5 from me.

This place is absolutely amazing in terms of ambience, decor, food quality, crowd and no doubt wears a sophisticated look. Me and my partner went over here for the buffet but since only 45 minutes were left for the buffet to end, we preferred ala carte. We ordered Red pepper fish for starters and it was heavenly. The fish was so soft that it simply melted inside my mouth. The mixed Hakka noodles n Manchurian fried rice was again too tasty. My appetite was fully served, but chicken in blackberry sauce ( I don't remember the name exactly) was still left. Here again the chicken was delicious, soft and tender. Our bill was around Rs. 1200. I loved this place and would surely come back here for the buffet :)

After going through the reviews and after our plan to other restaurants getting cancelled we atlast settled for the buffet at Tung Fong. The price of the buffet is Rs.632. If you are a starter man then Tung Fong is just not the place you should go for but if you like to have main course then Tung Fong provides you with a lot of varieties. The buffet menu for Non veg comprises of -
2 soups- one chicken soup & one prawn soup
Starters- Veg Wantons, Sczewan Fried Chicken
Salad- Corn Salad, Non veg salad and one more salad(don't remember the name)
Main Course- Lots of non veg dishes and lots of veg items( Seriously we loved all the dishes)
So overall our decision to take a buffet at Tung fong was indeed a good decision.

Location - Tung Fong is located at PARK STREET(Nearby Flury's)

Ambience - The restaurant is on the ground floor.. The ambience inside is nice with smooth beautiful decorations.. Its a large restaurant in terms of seating. The Doormen are nice and greet you nicely..

Brief - I think its one of the best chinese restaurants in Kolkata.. My frnds have a fascination giving their treats, maybe because of its location. 

Food - Blown by the ambience, service, peace & the food..Fully authentic Chinese taste.. In main course we had chicken fried rice and garlic chicken.. The fried was tasty and damn good quality..simply loved it.. I'll advice every Chinese food lovers to give Tung Fong a try. You'll really love it..

Quite a famous oriental restaurant amidst park street ( free school street ) . Good ambience , over all good food , very poor service . The interior and sitting arrangements are pretty good ( I personally prefer those old school wooden couches and decor ) , though if you go upstairs the seats looks good but not very comfortable to sit for long . Staffs are very indifferent , not attentive , not well informed , so service is slow and at times really irritating . Now come to the food , well its pretty decent , but not excellent . They serve typical calcutta chineese foods , hence cant say the recipe very authentic . Any way try their dry chilli chicken , red pepper chicken , chilli garlic pepper fish as starters . ¬†For main course go for sezuan , thi garlic , spicy hoisin chicken , sanghai fish , crab meat with pakchoi , red pepper or sezuan or sanghai lambs along with manchurian / sezuan mixed fried rice or noodles . Chineese foods are always well accompanied by rum or whisky ( I prefer on the rocks ) , so go for it .¬†
Costs around 2000 to 2500 for two .

Finally a visit at Tung Fong after a long long time. Although our planning was to visit Marco Polo but we landed on Tung Fong due to heavy rain. I had tried Tung Fong‚Äôs buffet several time before but I never found them attractive. So this time I planned to went for their a la carte. Ambiance was smoothing and staffs were welcoming. The menu was brief, when necessary, which was quite a contrast to most Chinese restaurants. We started with the ‚ÄòChicken Wanton‚Äô soups which was nicely done and delicious. About starters I choose ‚ÄòStir Fired Chilly Garlic Fish‚Äô, soft crispy fish was just perfect to warm up our taste buds. Chilly garlic fish absolutely delicious and we were off to a great start. For main course, we decided to go for ‚ÄòFortune Rice‚Äô & ‚ÄòShanghai Chicken‚Äô. But before the main courses arrived, there was time for mocktails, ‚ÄòMusical Mango‚Äô (created with mango juice, milk shake & vanilla ice cream) and ‚ÄòHighway Mary‚Äô (prepared by orange juice with crashed strawberry and butterscotch ice cream) to refresh the palate. Both mocktails are mind-blowing and really refreshing. Fortune rice was the perfect combination of shredded chicken and mushrooms, really yummy. Shanghai chicken was average but it went quite well with fortune rice. I definitely enjoyed my meal and the food offered for our money very good though. Recommended for people who were looking for Chinese food near park street area.

One of Kolkata's favourite when it comes to Chinese food.. but in Park st i prefer Flavours of China over Tung Fong.. It Is located just beside Mocambo.. the ambience is great and seating capacity is huge.. though on festive days you have wait for your turn as it is very popular and gets crowded despite its seating capacity..¬† Coming to the food, The starters are excellent and so are the sauces they serve on the table with your meal.. The main course is okay nothing great.. Once i tried their buffet long back.. and food quality was quite good in the buffet and at a reasonable price.. It is a good restaurant to dine in with your family and friends.. Keep it up!!

One of the best places to eat Chinese food in Park Street area. It is a huge restaurant which has a very old fashined charm in its decor. The wooden tables and chairs will give you a kind of ¬†royal feeling while you are seated. There is round section in the middle of the restaurant which stands apart from the rest of the place. The yellow lights add on to the lighting in this section. You are served both food and liquor here so it is a good place to spend some time over a drink and good food. I love the pepper fried fish. its yummy. Thought the service is a bit slow if you are an early bird... I also love the pork dishes here. Overall a nice experience in the heart of the city where good food comes at a reasonable price.

We went there twice.
First time we had tung fong fried chicken ( good n crispy 4/5 ) , mixed fried rice ( moderate quantity , nice ! 3.5/5 ) n lemon chicken ( that i didn't like much. round pieces of lemon made that kinda weird ! 2.8/5) .
Next time we had mixed garlic rice ( again good one ! 3.8/5 ) n sweet n sour chicken ( round pieces of pineapples n tangy taste . good ! 3.5/5 ) .

Service : bad ! :P ¬†when we went some cricket match was going on the T.V n everyone was watching that out n forgot to serve us. One funny thing happened second time. One service boy served two glasses of soda lime to our table. We surprised why were they serving it to us, was it any special occasion ! Then we asked them n they took it away saying sorry ! And what made us wonder they served those two to our next table with out changing it. It should be mentioned that one of those glasses had been sipped by my friend.

Pocket pinch : a bit over priced.

Ambiance : finest ambiance amidst all park street restro that i've visited.

Overall mixed experience...!

P.S.: they serve halls at the end.. :P :D :P

This is another favorite chinese food destination around park street. Right on the opposite road of Au bon pain (earlier the music world) beside Mocambo - it is a very easy to track down place. And you may get paid parking right infront of it - another plus point. 

Been there yesterday - ordered vod kiss and green magic - two very simple, yet nice cocktails and presented in a simplistic manner.

Then chicken mushroom soup, chicken chow and thai garlic chicken.. the food was awesom. Thai garlic chicken  was a definite hit.

Earlier during college days visited this place 2-3 more times. Worth the money - not too much expensive. :-)

This is the second time I paid a visit to this place and that too after a very long time. I wanted to treat a friend for my birthday and thus both of us decided to opt for their buffet. Unfortunately, the buffet menu was not quite convincing and therefore, we chose a-la-carte. For starters we ordered crispy baby corn which was served with sweet n sour chutney. The first bite made us go gaga over it.  For main course we ordered mixed rice noodles, mixed hakka noodles and Kung pao chicken. When the food arrived we literally started hogging it. The smell, texture, everything was so appealing and most importantly the taste just blew us away. The gravy of the Kung pao chicken was flavoured so well that we went on licking the serving spoon too. And the best part is that so much for ¬†1050 bucks only!!

People who haven‚Äôt visited this place are yet to have one of the most delightful food experiences of their life!!
 I just cannot rate this place below five!

Been to Tung Fong only once, last year during Christams with friends for lunch. Must say that the quality of food degrades on such a busy day, what with having to keep up with the long queues, nevertheless, Tung Fong was a good experience. Tried out their Crispy american corn, their crispy chicken starters, and were pretty pleased. Mains were average, but it might have been the pressure of the day. Can be comparatively pricey for the amount and quality we were served on that day.

Been here quite a few times and my experiences were kinda mixed. The first time i had been here for a buffet lunch. The food was not good at all and i believe it was the worst buffet i ever had. The food was not fresh, nor did it taste like it should. Overall it was a huge disappointment. 

The next time i had been kind of forced to visit this place again. This time we did not opt for the buffet and the experience came out to be way better. The place is less crowded than other eateries in the evening and with it's ornamental decoration you can have a perfect date in here, with good food and conversation!

When in Park street and craving for Chinese head straight to Tung Fong without looking around! Do not worry about getting a place if in afternoon, might have to stand for half and hour if in evening, but it can house upto 80 guests at one time, it is huge!! You enter and you go Wow! seeing the Interiors, specially the center podium area! Lighting perfect and the ambiance perfect for your first date or that special celebration! The people there are cordial, warm, happy and prompt with service. And if you wanna give a treat to 20 people, you can also choose Tung Fong either for their buffet or al-a-carte as the pocket pinch will not hurt you.
Now coming to the food. One of the best Chinese to serve in the city. Unlike Bar-b-Q the variety is more and better. We start with soups on most occasion and their four treasure soup is great though a bit heavy. Their noodles are all great! Whether it is cantonese or hakka or pan fried one will enjoy all the kinds. My sister loves their Chopsuey!
Now their main course, Black Bean , Hoisin and Kung Pao are my favorite, my parents stick to the regulars like manchurian, chilli chicken, garlic, hot garlic, ginger chicken and they are also good--- my recommendation do try the kung pao!¬†
Their lamb dishes are also very nice and well done every single time we order. the king of Prawn dishes are pepper chilli prawns! definitely order!
Never tried their crabs or vegetarian dishes ...¬†
neither did I ever had space to order desserts... so that you have to try for yourselves...¬†
Happy eating!!!!

So one rainy afternoon three hungry friends roaming around park street searching for some chineese food came accross this gem.Review of a landmark eatery was long due so grabbed the opportunity to jump in.Service was a tad slow since the lunch hour was just over but we were in need for a long chat so quite fine with it.Coming to the food we stick to the classics there,smoked lamb,chilli garlic pepper fish and red pepper chicken along with heiniken.The green chilli souce as a condiment was to die for.The star of the course was the smoked lamb.Succulent lamb chunks with soya souce,the perfect crunch provided by the sesame seads and green chillies.The fish was good too but the chicken was a bit dry for me.Price is a bit on higher side but the quantity and quality is worth it.A nice experience overall.

Fung Tong, Kolkata

Having sampled the Chinese food in whatever remnants of Chinese there is in Calcutta, we were cleared dismayed. The Chinese hath migrated all of them lock stock and barrel with the famous cuisine emanating from authentic Chinese refugees in the 50‚Äôs with Indian flavor. Where is it gone? What you get in most places is concoctions made by Nepalese/Bengali cooks. So if Chinese cuisine is called Chinese what should the present concoction be named? Nepalese or Bengalese noodles? Like Malaysian noodles or Hunan noodles or schezwan sauce?  Kolkata is going thru a terrible phase of change, now even Park Street is no more ‚Äì Its Mother Teresa Sarani!!!  I am confused. Apologies for my tirade! I am down right passionate on my love for Chinese food in Calcutta especially the tangram. Kolkata‚Äôs loss is Canada and Australia‚Äôs gain, I guess!

I have sampled Chinese food in Shanghai and found it bland, Cantonese in Gangzhou found too many pets on the table but nothing compares to authentic Calcutta or Tangra type Chinese cuisine. How I yearn for my Chinese, that only my taste buds can tell!

Long story short, my relatives got fed up of my Kolkata‚Äôs loss tirade and took me for lunch to Fungtong, next to Mocambo, corner of Park Street on Free School Street. The d√©cor was certainly stately and upmarket not the cheap Chinese d√©cor one used to see in the 70‚Äôs with dragons and paper lanterns. The center was a platform seating with a round dome like ceiling done in gold leaf and gold paint. It was vast, spacious and had a private lounge as well for a private party. There was a successful and I believe famous buffet on at Rs.400/- per plate with dessert. Pictures will prove the excellent delicacies on display ‚Äì Cantonese chicken, Prawn in Garlic sauce, Chicken Fried rice, Sweet corn soup with ample starters and dessert.
My relatives were late and we were famished, so ordered a stir fried vegetable of Pock Choi, Brocolli, Bell peppers, Capsicums, Spring onions, Mushrooms and stringed beans crisp and blanched at Rs.188/-. The stir fried vegetables were indeed stir fried optimally in a wok with black bean sauce to the extent the vegetables had a crunch! This was indeed yummy!!There after we ordered a Lung Fung Soup one into 2 at Rs.219/- for the same. The soup was wholesome and thick  with Mushrooms, Boneless chicken, bamboo shoots, floating eggs drops. The soup was superb as well! My wish for authentic Chinese food was now being answered!! Finally my relatives arrived and we got down to the task of ordering the main course, immediately.

We ordered my favourite sweet and sour Honey Prawns at Rs. 809/- (most weird rate) , 2 chicken rice noodles at Rs.140/- per plate, one smoked Lamb at Rs. 499/- per plate and a mixed Fried rice at Rs.152/- per plate. Add to which we ordered a chicken cantonese with special Hhosin sauce at Rs.332/- per plate.
I have never seen such fancy rates and incredibly weird as compared to cost of Chinese dishes across but whatever the reason, I guess it‚Äôs worth it and certainly making good returns. This is one Chinese smart alec business man.
Well the price really does not matter if the food is authentic, excellent, tasty and a sheer seduction to the taste buds. This meal certainly was!! The Smoked Lamb was exotic, well cooked to keep the smokiness intact, touch of rice vinegar and soya sauce with a sprinkle of sesame seeds to give the excellent texture and taste. The Sweet and sour sauce was a thick tomato based gravy with tomato puree, touch of soya sauce and rice vinegar and corn flour with the most sweetest Golda prawns softly saut√©ed  with sliced carrots, capsicums , onion petals. Indeed divine and authentic again. The fried rice had the same texture as the original Chinese and it was certainly finger smacking and so was the chicken rice noodles. Well cooked and not mushy as the locals make them.

I have decided to take back my words. This here ‚Äì Funk Tong is an authentic Chinese restaurant and Kolkata does have a few intact without sharing with either Canada or Australia.
Loved the food and am sure the buffet was great too if it could attract 4 table full of giggling Kitty party ladies!! 

The entire bill was a shocking Rs.2961/- inclusive of Indian taxes and the food was superb. This would have been around 10 K in Mumbai for sure!! 

Ambience ‚Äì 9/10 Superb 

Menu ‚Äì 9/10 excellent menu with lots and lots of authentic Chinese dishes

Taste ‚Äì 10/10  Awesome

Customer Service ‚Äì 8/10 Good 

Value for Money ‚Äì 10 /10 Superb Value for Money

Recommend ‚Äì When around Free school street or Park street with a penchant for authentic Chinese ‚Äì MUST visit to Legendary Fung Tong, Kolkata

This is a place in park street which i have been visiting right from my childhood. This place has lot of good memories like friends birthday parties and family get togethers. Because of a good ambience and a huge place this place in park street attracts many food lovers. As you enter Tung Fong you will surely like the place as its really spacious and big. The staff welcomes you with a good smile and the seating arrangements are really good. Both the buffet and the ala carte is good. Although whenever i have visited this place i have never tried the buffet.  Mostly the starters, mock tails and the main course is really good. They serve amazing prawns and chicken. The service is really fast and the place looks clean. The prices are not that cheap but the food is really worth the price. An ideal place for chinese lovers.

Visited after a long time with college friends. Ordered chili garlic chicken and spicy baby corn. Starters were really good and tasty. I always prefer a bit spicy, so opted those. Then we continued with Cantonese noodles and spicy Hakka noodles, Manchurian style followed by paneer as a veg side dish and fish with some soft drinks. Overall service and quality of food is too good. As I was visiting after so many years, my expectations were very high. They have maintained their level from all aspects. Thanks.

For Chinese food in Kolkata this is one of the best restaurants to go.
The service speed is mediocre, presentation is simple. But the food is actually very nice.

The flavors are beautifully balanced and each dish is perfectly cooked. The staff here are always a little pre occupied.

Prices are fine not very high, but not reasonable.

The quantity is okay, I mean from I plate of fried rice 2 people can not share, unless they are small eaters.

The interiors are majestic! This is a must visit if you like authentic Chinese food and this is located in a prime position as well!

I had been in this restaurant yesterday.. The food and ambiance was very good. The decor was traditional Chinese. 

Even though the food tasted delicious,the problem was the buffet spread..There were very less items in the buffet in comparison with other buffet restaurants in Kolkata

In non veg starters, there were only fried chicken and chicken momos....No fish,prawn etc.....
In main course,non veg noodles were not there...only non veg fried rice was there.
The disaster was the deserts..there were only fresh fruits,darsan and ice cream...No gulab jamun,brownies,cake,pastries etc..

But I have to say,whatever minimum things were present in the buffet taste nice. The price was Rs.632/- all inclusive taxes.

I would highly recommend not to go for the buffet but for the AL-a-carte.

Undoubtedly one of the best chinese restos in town, tung fong is one of my favorite park street joints...it is a quality establishment serving authentic chinese delicacies...
What is most refreshing is the huge space and brightly lit interiors....
Food,too,is top notch....for starters,id recommend the melt-in-your-mouth butter fish fingers..its a must...soups are also very good here,chicken sweet corn soup,chicken asparagus soup,thai soup et al..
Main courses are all worth a try be it.fried rice,kung pao chicken etc...but my favorite sides are the sweet garlic chicken(best in kol,hands down winner) and the honey chicken(despite its 'chewy'ness)....another staple order of mine is the chicken cantonese chow(im averse to hakka chow,its always gravy for me)...desserts are decent,esp the toffee walnut...
Iv mostly had ala carte here and take away a few times....i savoured the buffet just once,and it was pretty gteat too...but id still say go for the ala carte..
Prices here are reasonable considering the great food and service!! 
A must visit for any foodie!!

I got to admit, the size of the place really impressed me. A few years back it was a Tempo showroom. The owner who is a resident Chinese did a good job of converting the place to what it is today. We were there on 21 June 14 for the buffet lunch. 

The table cloth was clean and the table was set nicely. They told us that included in the buffet was a drink as well. As luck would have it, it was a Fosters Beer day and since my buddy didn't drink I had two bottles to myself. 

Chicken Sweet Corn Soup came first and it was good. Followed by Chicken Lollipop and some fried wantons. We then proceeded to the buffet table where there was the veg side and the non veg side. It wasn't a big spread, just the basics. A few essential items like chicken fried rice and veg hakka noodles, two other veg dishes, one with vegetable and the other a panir item and on the non veg side it was prawns and chicken both in some sauce. Dessert was a simple dasun ( I think that's what its called) with ice cream.

The service was friendly and attentive. The food was just a little above the ordinary Chinese food  you get in any Park Street restaurant. Except the beer the cost of the buffet is almost the same as Mainland China buffet cost except  where the buffet spread is outstandingly large including 4 different variety of dessert and the cooking is par excellent.

Given the choice I would go to Mainland China or my very favorite for the past 40 years... Ming Room in Trincas.

Wanted to visit this place for quite sometime... finally it happened over a planned meeting with a friend.
The interior is pretty spacious with various typical chinese decorative items, wall hangings, vases etc making the place look more authentic.
I liked the lighting specially the ceiling of the place.
For starters we ordered Prawn Fried Wonton.. the item which I simply loved... it has a crispy outer coat with the soft prawn part inside... something which U feel like going on munching.
For the main course we went for the meinfoons ( Mix rice noodles) with Garlic Chicken.
Both the items contained the right balance of spices n herbs keeping the Chinese flavours intact.
Tung Fong is definitely a place I would recommend if someone is looking for some real Chinese!!

I rate this place amongst one of the best Chinese joints in Kolkata. I say this is after visiting the place for more than fifty times and yet the food and aroma doesn't seems to get moribund. Chilli garlic pepper chicken, black bean chicken , hunan chicken, mei foon, yang chu rice and hot brownie are special delicacies that will tickle your taste buds for another serving. Stuarts and waiters are very cordial and keeps on suggesting special dishes, if any. If you want to spend a quality time with family over dinner then look no beyond. Pocket pinch approx Rs 500 per head.

In the main course , I ordered Chicken Chilli Garlic Rice Noodles, which was zesty as you would expect it to be. We also ordered Chicken in Black Bean sauce and it was also Quite good.

In starter we ordered one plate of large crispy babycorn with mushroom...well to be honest the service was awesome .... We gt the starter within 5 mins....but on seeing the starter we were like....WOT!!!!!
It was just few pieces of mushroom and babycorn which were fried ... No sauce nuthing.......and the quantity was very very less....at 3xx rs....it could just feed 2adult n 1 child.....
Then we ordered fr 1 veg meifoon noodles ...1 veg fried rice....small veg manchurian and small chilli chicken
The food was served in 5min....but again the quantity was considerably less considering the amount u r paying
Food was ok...nuthing extraordinary

Total bill with 4 small thumsup was 1200

It was a delightful visit to Tung Fong. The different cuisines as well as the service was in one word: excellent. The interior decorum is quite pleasing to the eyes. There is a warm homely atmosphere. Get-together s are highly recommended. The staff looks to be quite experienced. There may be some weight on your budget but this place is liable enough to be good host to a large number of customers.

well was here with family for dinner.have had a slight experience once last time but still gave it another chance.but sorry to say this place keeps on making the same mistakes again n again n again!!!first of all when this restaurant has a desk god knows there is usually nobody to welcome u or guide u where to sit.This place seems as though nobody is interested if any guest is entering the restaurant or not!!!after one finds their way where they have to sit ,the staff who is incharge of the sections comes to the only only when asked for (when they probably get time from their small chit chats in their sections or in the cashier).last when i visited a person came to the table after like 15 mins when asked for!!!We ordered for a chilli potato n trust me it was just fried potato sticks sauteed in onion n chillies....me being a chef hav some knowledge as to how a chilli potato or a crispy chilli baby corn should be(it cant just be with onions n chopped chillies).... i did ask the server to call the chef or the manager but none were available for assistance.I thought the least the server could  do was just toss it in some chilli paste n ketchup n some soya sauce!!!!!anyways i don think he knows what all those things mean!!!!N when we got our mixed veg in chilli garlic sauce ---sorry to say there were only vegetables n i spoon of sauce to to very precise which they expect can b had with noodles n rice!!!!N i didnt know that in mixed veg restaurants add JHINGHA!!!!!I don think they ever add vegetables like pokchoi,zucchini,brocolli,brussel sprouts,snow peas,chinese cabbage,baby corn!!!!
After 2 bad experience i would think a million times to go back n for sure would never reccomend others to dine there!!!!

As a Chinese food lover Tung Fong is my mom's all time favourite joint. I must say the interior decoration is classy. Normally we visit there on weekends,so a long queue always wait for us. But they have a spacious waiting area.
Lung fung soup and Thai soup both are good there and the Kung pao chicken is just yummiii.. We love their fish finger, though last time we didn't find it that tasty but not bad also. The service is quick and the joint is not that expensive according to the taste.

I have been visiting this restaurant quite frequently in the past four years and it has become one of my favorites. Tung fong serves Chinese cuisine and if you are looking for a family restaurant serving delicious meals at affordable prices, this is the one. The place is well lit and spacious and the seating is quite comfortable. The staff are polite and well trained. My favorite from the menu is Butter Fish Fingers, Sweet and Sour Prawn and American Chopsuey, but I have never been disappointed with the quality of  whatever I have been served there. They also serve desserts like brownie and caramelized walnut in case you  possess a sweet tooth. Overall its a nice place for family outings and gatherings and cost effective too, with great service and good quality food.

A nice place for Chinese food lovers. We went on Sunday. We were a group of 14 guys. Firstly we thought we won't get a table. But the men over there were very cooperative, and told us they would arrange a table within 10-15 minutes. But they gave us a single long table within 10 minutes. Cheers for that! Next, the food was good. It was tasty, nice quantity. They surprised us with the bill amount. Not in negative aspect :D. The amount was very low against what we were expecting. I'll advice every Chinese food lovers to give Tung Fong a try. You'll really love it. I promise. Cheers :D!!!

A nice pleasent place for chinese food lover... food was nice . I have ordered american fried corn which was shallow fried corn sauted in chinese spices. A starter which must be ordered. Then we ordered ginger fried rice, manchurian, hakka noodles, momos, choupsway, the food was nice but manchuria was bit smoked or burnt which was smelling little bit bitter.... interior was bit boring but service was very good and the place was hygenic too :)

Though there are umpteen no. of choices in terms of restaurants in Park Street!! Tung Fung is one among them and a good one too.
As its good for Chinese menus, has good Service
Pretty much decent no. of choices in food menu
Less choice though when it comes to beverages menu.
All in all a nice place to consider!!

This place has become like a family hub these days! Its like a picture perfect chinese restaurant for me as I have never had to complain about the food and the service...! For starters the must have is the tung gong fried chicken/prawn.... For main course their garlic friedrice ,meifoon along with fish in oyester sauce or garlic chicken stands out! Their variety of ice creams is good too!!

My friends and I have been to this place on a couple of occasions and one thing that we have learnt is that this place is expensive. But more often than not, you end up coming out totally satisfied. The ambience is fabulous - comfortable sofa, cordial staff... And food - brilliant. One of the best chinese I have had in a long long time. Well worth the money!

After walking for a while I found myself famished with one of my friend at park street. But got confused with the heavy weight names of the restaurants at Park Street. after a confer decided to go for Tung fong. I was not very sure about the quality by the same token to mocambo or peter cat near by . Any ways we entered the very place with a surprise. I don‚Äôt remember actually but as far I recon it was a Chinese new year day and it was celebrated in a majestic way. we ordered a lamb item and noodles as far I remember. But have to say the taste Is still in attendance in the mouth. The best part of the restaurant was their ambience. I will definitely rank Tung fong as one of the best restaurant in the town.

Often overshadowed by the biggies of Park Street, this restaurant holds its own in terms of good food, reasonable price and pleasing ambience. Their Kung Pao chicken and Schwezan fish are worth trying out once. Next time i visit there, i will be trying out their buffet spread.

SO one day my banking friends were on holiday and we normal people were not... on force i was taken from my office and taken to this place called "tung Fong" ... this was for the so called "best" lunch buffet available in Kolkata... at first i thought my friends have gone mad but then decided to ride this out.... so just went with the flow...

So the "best" lunch Buffet turned to the BEST lunch buffet at the cheapest price with absolutely great food... they give you a free alcoholic beverage which did not stop there and tehy kept on and on at it... the food from the starters to the soup to the main course was just very very good... 

we kept going back to the counter as they had drums of heaven and my friends went ballistic over it... more so i have relaized everytime i go there that we concentrate more on the starters than the main course and eat very little of that cause the starters are very very good here... what makes this place great for me is that there are so many people that the starters or the main course you get is fresh as the portions have to continuously be refiled compared to other places....

this place is a definite try for any one looking for a chilled out experience in Park Street at just 590.... with  a free beer or Coke as per the suiting...

this place has a lot of space and the furniture is pretty comfortable....

Though a bit secluded from the main chain of restrnts of Park Street like Peter Cat, Marco Polo, this place has its own X-factor. The ambience is quite upto the mark and soothing. Its perfect for family dinners or a group of 7-8 friends. The perfectly arranged round table add a sophisticated touch to the entire place. And, now moving onto the food which is good still not close to somethng extra-ordinary. But the quantity is comparitively on the lower side than Bar-B-Q or many other restaurants. I tried Chinese last time I went there during the New Year and though there was nothing I could complain about but similarly there was nothing as such I was flatterd about. 
But for me, Peter Cat is still a much better option amongst the Park Street chain considering the same pocket pinch.

This place is just epic. 

So the two of us entered this place and we were shown to our table. I personally disliked the table as it was situated weirdly and soon one family came and sat and we felt intruded as the only difference between us was the sorta railing. 

Anyway, the only reason why I've deducted their .5 point is because of this particular waiter. We asked him first to give us the buffet menu and he paid deaf ear to it. However, there was this other happy old waiter who gave it to us. 

After deciding to go for ala carte and deciding the stuffs we want to order we were waiting for someone to come to take our order but alas no one came. 
We called out to this particular idiot waiter (apologies for my language) but he shrugged it off and when we called the second time he said in a rather rude tone to wait and that someone will come to attend us. 
After another 5-6 minutes we knocked him again and he said again to wait for sometime -.-

Finally that happy old man came and he took our order. And boy we were impressed. He was witty and cheerful and we forgot all the qualms we had earlier. 
We ordered for a veg talumein soup, fried wanton, Hakka noodles and potato in chilly garlic sauce. 

The soup arrived and it looked little weird to me, it had too much of soya acc to me. However it tasted fine a little low on salt though but no complaints! I burnt my tongue though :3

Coming to the wantons.. They were super yummy and we got 8 pieces in half plate (whereas regular joints serve 6 in a full plate)

The noodles and the chilli potato- they were super too even though the potato was a little salty. But when mixed with the noodles it tasted just fine so no complaints. 

The bill for this come a 554 bucks and we were shocked. Specially because I had a bet with my friend regarding the bill.. He thought it'd be above 900 and I guessed it'd be around 600-700.
So we couldn't really understand how to react since it absolutely went beyond our expectations!
A double thumbs up for tung fong :D

When u r dining out somewhere, the place itself has to be divine to make it some memorable experience. I have seen both the sides of Tung Fong, as I had visited on a very rush day ie,25 of December and on a casual day as well. One thing which compels me to say is that on both the different days, service was  same. Ambience is so gentle. U get one of the best Chinese dishes here in. Prawns are cooked really well. From the starter till the dessert, u get quality food. It would be totally pleasurable for u to spend time in Tung Fong with ur near and dear ones over a steaming bowl of soup. Highly recommended.

Tung Fong is the absolute place for the Chinese lovers. Here you can have large number of variety in hot n soft drinks with mouth watering fusion Chinese food. They have create a land mark for the Chinese. Beautiful seating arrangement n the ambiance they have. The restaurant divided in two parts like one is the boy zone n other one is the family zone. Which gives you an ultimate ambiance according to your companion. Really good place to hang out.

In my ten day stint at Kolkata, I spent a lot of time in Park Street trying out different Chinese restaurants and Tung Fong is top rated on Zomato so I definitely wanted to give it a shot. I went there with my aunt for a couple of drinks and starters and was fairly disappointed with the food. The ambiance is nice and the place is spacious and well lit. Service is prompt too. Food wise, I preferred its competitors in Park Street. In starters I had the Hot Chili Fish, Chili Garlic Crab Claws and Crispy chicken sticks. The Crab claws were really good but the quantity quite less. In main course I had the Chicken and Prawn Cantonese Chowmein which I found rather disappointing as it lacked any flavor whatsoever.

Don't think I'll try this place again.

There wasn't much of Park Street that I hadn't already explored. Having visited the 'biggest players in the game' multiple times (i.e. the Peter Cats, the Mocambos, the  Barbeques and the Arsalans) , I seriously never thought I was missing out on something so prodigiously impressive. 
Even last night, Barbeque happened to be the first choice for me& my motley group of seven people. 'It would take us at least an hour to allot you a table'- one statement from the manager there was all it took for us to barge out of the place and look for modest secondary options. 'Let's go to Tung Fong'- I had a brainwave. Everybody complied with that as we marched towards the neighbour of the more prolific Mocambo. Luck deserted us here to as we couldn't find a table here either, but then we were assured of one within thirty odd minutes. 
The 30 minute time- frame was well exceeded and it wasn't before waiting for 80 odd minutes before we had a table for ourselves. The wait was mind- numbingly frustrating, but then, there isn't much you can do apart from waiting, specially when hunger pangs are threatening to get the better of you. I noticed the interiors during that period-'dazzling' was the first word that came to my mind. The opulence of the entire set- up is pleasing, inviting and thoroughly invigorating. By the looks of it, all the parameters of 'Fine- Dining' were suitably met at this place.
Our hunger levels had scaled Herculean heights by then& we didn't ponder over the nitty- gritties of the menu card at all. One look at the menu and the orders were in place in no time- Tung Fong special fried chicken, drums of heaven, chicken hakka noodles, chicken fried rice, shanghai chicken and fish in oyster sauce.
I don't know about the people who have had pitiable experiences here, but we thoroughly loved& enjoyed the fare served on our plates. Everything was 'finger- licking good' (I hope KFC wouldn't sue me for this!) , the quantities were more than sufficient (you get 12 pieces of meat/ fish for a full plate) and service time left no room for complaint either. The restaurant caters to large crowds on weekends and that can be a major setback for food connoisseurs, but the staff here is adept at handling their customers& also serving the food in quick time. 
I only took back good memories from Tung Fong last evening, the food and the ambience there have ensured I would revisit this place with my loved ones soon enough.
However, I do hope I wouldn't have to wait for 80- 90 minutes again, the human knee can ache pretty severely for all you know!

I don't know about others, but Tung Fong for me has not been a great experience. I have been to this place thrice and each time a very unusual and irritating problem came up. The first time I went with my mother and ordered clear soup, chicken fried rice and crispy chicken. Now, have you ever been served soup after the main course? I think not. The second time i went with my college friends and opted for the buffet. The food was extremely average and when the dessert came, we were taken aback. There was just fruits, cut in rough portions and the apples had started changing their colour into yellow. I was thoroughly disgusted. Third time was even better. As soon as we got seated, the power went for a toss and the restaurant got engulfed in darkness. The washroom smelt like something had died in there and in all I felt like pulling my hair in frustration. GOD!

Park street will give you ample options to choose, but if you are looking for reasonable Chinese buffet, and value for money_tung fong is the place!! The weekend buffet spread was indeed impressive. With complimentary beer, is something that would lighten up your mood.
Wide range of starters, with drums of heaven being the best of all, would definitely try to kill your appetite.
Main course offers both fried rice and noodles, Chicken, lamb, fish and prawns!! what else to ask for??!!
Although the dessert part wasn't much impressive, as they had only fresh fruits and ice-cream.
The place is very nicely done, and ambiance is really good,and so is the service.
happy eating :)

Tung Fong is a delightful place for chinese food. I love how the place looks: its spacious, the decor is elegant and it's well lit.
I had ordered the red pepper chicken, chilli garlic pepper prawns for starters. they were lipsmacking good. I also tried the chicken sweet and sour soup which was okay-ish but the mixed thai soup was wondrous. Its a must try.for main course, i really liked the crab meat with button mushroom, kung pao chicken and the mixed rice noodles. it was cooked perfectly and it had great flavours. For deserts, brownie has always been my favorite.
Over all, it is a must visit for all people who like good food and don't mind spending on it. :)

A nice place where u will get delicious Chinese dishes.. This joint is situated in the heart of park street.. & decor is good & ambiance is too.. & service is so awesome bcoz u dnt have 2 wait for ur desired dishes for so long after placing the order.. we ordered chicken cashew-nuts & mix garlic fried rice.. both were mouth watering & delicious.. Price of drinks is also reasonable too & price of foods is really worthy.. In my opinion if u r a real chinese food lover then definitely it is the perfect joint for you. Price is reasonable and quality and quantity of food is too good. i will give 5 out of 5 for food, 4 out of 5 for service, 3.5 out of 5 for ambiance. That's why 4 out of 5 is my finl rating that I would like to give....

So one rainy evening, my family and I land up at this old joint... And boy, were we glad that we did! Tung Fong is as sophisticated as ever in its d√©cor and ambience. They have slightly refurbished to bring in some modern touches in lighting and accessories while keeping the ‚Äòfeel‚Äô of the place the same. The servers are courteous, quick and friendly. That might be in part due to the owners who were doing the rounds continuously for the two hours we were there‚Ä¶hat tip to their energy!!

Coming to the food‚Ä¶we hogged‚Ä¶ Unashamedly and Tung fong catered to our taste buds like a rockstar. For starters, we took chili garlic pepper fish and the chicken drumsticks. The drumsticks were crisp, just the right amount of salty and came with a piece of lemon to squeeze over the succulent pieces of chicken. But the insane bit was the fish‚Ä¶The taste was through the roof, spicy but tempered with garlic such that the hit of spice was cut through by the moistness of fish with no uggh smell that often accompanies a Chinese fish preparation. Btw, the fish served was bhetki. Along with starters some mojitos, beers and fresh lime sodas were ordered. I had the mojito which was a little different from the ones I've had at other places as it was containing a pinch of salt. But I did not find it unpleasant. Cocktail snob approves :-)

The starters were served within 10 mins of placing the order. The main course took about 20 mins but we did not mind waiting as the match was on the TV for the cricket enthusiasts and we had a light chit chat going around the table. For the mains we had chicken Cantonese gravy noodles, the mixed fried rice, the fish (again bhetki) in black bean sauce and the chicken with green pepper. The NOODLES were awesome, insane, I loved it. I see myself going back again and again for it. The rice seemed to be okay, I did not have it myself so cannot comment. The amount of it was fairly large, certainly more than the noodles. The fish in black bean sauce is a house specialty, and Tung fong delivered on its promise with the taste and succulence of the fish in black bean gravy. The chicken with green peppers was pretty good, I would have preferred the sourness to be a bite lesser. 

Too stuffed to order dessert, we asked for the cheque. We were surprised when a sever brought a plate of small rolled stuff (!!) on a big plate and started pouring water over it and it expanded‚Ä¶and voila, we had scented fresh napkins *golly*‚Ä¶This place presents halls instead of the regular saunf or other mouth fresheners which I think is just more convenient and hygienic.

Pocket pinch after all this was around 2500 inclusive of taxes...so cheap that we broke out in grins!

I would have given this place a 5... I deducted .5 for the fact they serve starters on the plates which serve as napkin holders which are way too small, and to top it off, mine was dirty and needed to be wiped clean. Also, chopsticks are provided only on request, whereas I think they should be giving chopsticks to all tables and have it removed at guests‚Äô preference.

I‚Äôm going back for the crab claws, lamb specialties and the noodles again!

I had heard a lot about this place and one fine evening we ended up at tung fong in a grouo of 3.First that struck me was unlike the other older park street  restaurants this place isnt dark n gloomy.and is very spaciuos.The tables are well spaced unlike some others.So coming to the food.For starters we ordered their chilly pepper garlic chicken and their manchow soup.One thing that i didn like is that they served the soup after the spicy pepper garlic chicken as a result it appear a bit bland.None the less the chicken was rilly good.For main course we ordered their chicken rice noodles , shanghai fish , and chicken fortune rice.I didn try d noodles but the rice was well made,especially the shitaki mushrooms.The fish tasted rilly nice with d hot and tangy shanghai sauce.For desserts we went with thier chocolate brownie an it was simply amazing.served eith a generous helping of ice cream.The brownie just made my day.The bill came to something around 1300 which is quite good.All in all a great experience.Looking forward to another visit.

Realised every time we crave Chinese its always has been Tung Fong.Love the food here.Its spacious with pleasant oriental interiors and comfortable well spaced seating.
So far all the dishes we have ordered have been well prepared and well portioned.My favourites are the wonton soup,the prawn starters,Cantoneese  noodles and the honey smoked lamb which is an absolute must try-melt in the mouth with a delicious smoky flavour.The only dish i found okay and not great was  the chilli garlic crab claws.The flavour of the sauce was good but the size of the claws were very small and hence the taste didn't come through.I ve never tried the desserts here and also the selection is limited.The service is prompt and the staff courteous.Do try the place for good food and conversations.

Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Price: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5

Went couple of times on weekdays for lunch. It was quite a vacant place at that time of the day. It's a spacious restaurant with cozy seating arrangements.

We ordered prawn sweet corn soup to start off with. The aroma was really nice. The prawn quality was good. Fully authentic Chinese taste. In main course we had mix cantonese style fried rice and chilli garlic chicken and chilli garlic pepper fish (had this the other day). The fried was tasty and damn good quality, less spicy but good taste. Chickens were awsomely blended with spices, really crispy and superbly tasty. The chilli flakes added an extra flavour to the dish.

Service is very quick and the staff were very attentive. Little bit expensive but really enjoyed the food here.

Tung Fong is arguably the best Chinese restaurants in the town. Extremely reasonably priced and offering vast spread, it offers the best Cantonese Chowmein I have had. Their golden hit is their Golden Fried Prawns, which is priced a bit upwards, but is simply out of the world. You have some large pieces of prawns dipped in Sweet Chilli sauce. 

Tung Fong scores big on its ambience - its pretty large inside and has pockets of space here and there to accommodate people. Still,  often you would find people queuing up for tables. 

The restaurant gives you a nice warm feeling. The only place it needs to make up is probably the dessert area - not much variety there. 

Overall, its one of the best Chinese foods you will have !

Visited it after a long time with my favorite senior treating it for new job. Great fan of park street and the whole food sphere around it. But amid all the options tung fong is the best( with caps each) Chinese place in kolkata. Went there at lunch time with no waiting for table. We opted for a la carte. For starters we ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken. It was succulent spicy and well cooked with perfect quantity to leave space for main course. Then we had mixed hakka chow and schezuan lamb. One of the best lamb dishes i have tried. It's shredded very tender and hint of sweet and chilli makes it so good. Hakka noodles was good but the portion were small for two people. In dessert we opted for walnut toffee. It's basically caramelized walnut in toffee with scoops of vanilla ice cream. Yummy! And the best part is.. It was a treat. So no worry of bill! :-)  but judging by his people it wasn't that big! 
P.s. Was so busy with food. Forgot to get #foodgrams.  Next time. :-)

Paid a visit to Tung Fong after ages. Yes this was the same place I first took my (then fiancee) out to seven years ago. :) Been there perhaps once or twice since. Not much has changed. The tables are like before. Well spaced out. Comfortable seating. Reasonably prompt attention.

The food perhaps has seen better days. My friend and I decided to have the buffet. We ordered for drinks... he had a vodka with  Limca while I opted for a a couple of Bloody Marys. They were very well made. Nice and tangy. The glass had a tad too much salt perhaps. Only other issue was it was not cold enough... had to ask for ice.

The buffet itself seemed inadequate. For starters there were veg wantons (not too well made, and some were undercooked... the filly was like a mash) and chicken lollipops that were rather nice, and we all gorged on them. We had almost filled ourselves silly. My friend was not a natural non-vegetarian and claimed he had his months quota in the starter itself! A couple of items more would have made it worth it. That was followed by soup. Saw veg manchow soup and chicken sweet corn soup. The latter was rather tasteless, and almost devoid of corn. Large pieces of chicken emerged upon hunting. Seemed someone was lazy with the knife!

The main course items were not too bad. The usual complement of vegetarian dishes in form of paneer, tofu, mixed vegetables and something potatoey were guests of the vegetarian corner. There was a veg chowmein with it. Not bad. The non-vegetarian section had a chicken friend rice, along with a chicken in soya chilli gravy (nice enough), a fish in manchurian gravy (thank goodness for bhetki... tasty enough too). and a horrid prawn in some gravy.

What is with restaurants and prawns these days? Be it Mainland China or here, the prawns served are disgusting. The coating comes off as if its cooked in water. The prawns taste bad. Period. That is is they taste anything at all. I did point it out to one of the stewards and he sounded surprised. Hah! What a waste of money.

Dessert was fruit (papaya, and two others, one perhaps a pear and the other kul), darsaan and choice of icecream. They also have a complimentary drink. All fairly decent.

We were served with two small white rolls (looked like miniature icecream) till we discovered they were wet towel rolls. Scented and refreshing, though a tad remniscent of phenol. Much to my friend's (who had a bad throat) amusement, we were served halls lozenges post meal.

The buffet is priced at about Rs 460 plus applicable tax.

In a nutshell, while the buffet is less expensive than Mainland China, the spread too is more limited. Not as great a deal as it used to be.

Tung Fong serves the best Chinese Lunch Buffet in the city. Hands Down. Yes Yes...I know some of you will bring up Mainland China. But this place does it for 590 bucks which includes a complementary beer or other non-alcoholic beverages and has been doing it for atleast ten years now. The first time I went there, I went to celebrate one of my closest friends birthdays and it was exactly ten years back. I remember being delighted with their buffet menu and heaping my plate with their Prawn Dimsums and Chicken drumsticks. That is the day I became a fan of Tung Fong lunch buffet and till today I have never been dissapointed. Apart from their normal Chinese affair, most of which is delish I love their Hot Pot Soup which comes in three different sizes. So you can order the size based on the number of people you have in your group. I also love their rice wine chicken. It is a unique chicken dish that you will not get in any other restaurant of the city.

The restaurant itself is spacious with comfortable sofas. It has interesting oriental artifacts all around the restaurant. The servers are cordial and prompt. 

It is one of those places where you can go and chill with your friends and it is one of the starmark restaurants which makes Park Street .....**PARK STREET**.

Went here with a friend and the place is awesome. A forgettable experience in Mocambo especially because for my friend earlier and my knack of experimenting with food and different restaurants of the city  compels me to search Zomato most of the times before I go out for lunch or dinner. This junction had a few good reviews and so I zeroed in on this one. 
After the crowd in some of the other restaurants around that place, this seemed a very relaxed place. It had a very good ambiance and food was great. We ordered Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken, Mixed Chinese Chopsuey and Schewan Lamb, andall there were delicious to say the least. Along with all these what impressed me the most is the service, amicable, humble and very quick and efficient. Cost wise may be it could have been a bit cheaper, but when you consider the other factors it more than makes it up.
Looking forward to visit once more.

Today i happened to visit this place with my wife for lunch,  without any precedence or know how about the restaurant..which i generally do not do......just felt like having Chinese food ,,,, bored with the mocambos and peter cats of parkstreet. this was one of those lucky days i guess when a wild guess turned out to be just awesome
Ambiance and food quality----just  top notch.. nothing else can define it in better words..every item on the menu be it veg or non veg tasted perfect.... at the end we felt satisfied and content. 
it was very spacious with well thought interiors and 
prompt service, good crowd and delicious buffet menu.

This winter we had a nice family dining at Tung fong. The ambiance is really great. The ground floor is quite spacious and suitable for big family party. The quality of food and drinks are also quite good.  The restaurant staffs are cordial and efficient. The cost of the food & drink is little bit on the higher side, but compensated by the quality. Wish the quantity could be little more. Overall the experience is good.

I was out with friends and decided on Tung Fong, although one of my friends were not too keen on Chinese, because Peter Cat and Mocambo were extremely crowded, and I just was not feeling like going to anywhere else but Tung Fong since it was already 9.15 pm. We entered a relatively relaxed place, and was shown to a table for six, where we three sat comfortably. We ordered drinks and food, as we were pretty much HUNGRY. The server got us our drinks pretty fast, along with a bowl of cheeselings and the prawn chips we had ordered. From then, food started coming in - hakka style chilli fish, butter fried chicken, chicken and mushroom clear soup, Chicken Thai Soup. 

We were sitting, chatting at a relaxed pace, and service was mostly attentive. The food was excellent - each and every dish was served piping hot, portioned as we wished, and our whims answered easily (Chopsticks, extra chilli paste, lime slices, more ice... you name it!). What i liked was the courteous attitude of the staff. We decided to go for one last starter, and it was Drums of Heaven. It was served with a half-lime wedge which we squeezed over the crunchy chicken before biting in. By this time, we were pretty much full, so called it a night when the server came for our last order - Our bill came to just under 2500/- but with drinks and coke, it was actually good value for money. They also gave us Halls in place of mouth freshener. I liked that a lot.

we three people visited tung fong on the first weekend of 2014. interior decoration is pretty sophisticated. we opted for buffet lunch. After waiting  a few minutes we got our seats. Food is no doubt very good. Thai soup and chicken drumstick both gave a sumptuous start. Fish preparation in the main course was truly out of the world, it was tender and melts easily in your mouth. Prawn and chicken preparation was also nice. We ended up our meal with  tasty darshan and ice cream. A special Thumbs Up for Tung Fong  which is satisfying our test buds since the time immemorial.

This place is supposedly owned by the owners of Beijing and lilys kitchen so you need not worry about the quality of food here. 

I have been to this place many times. I have ordered a la carte and I have ordered buffet. I have liked it all. Every time. The food is fabulous with my favourites in the buffet menu being the dry chilli chicken, the chicken wanton, the potato fry in whatever sauce they fry it in and the prawns.I like their noodles and their rice as well as their veg and non veg gravy items as well.

I adore the ambiance and I adore the soft music playing inthe palce.

This place is ideal for bringing friends, family and dates. A complete recommendation from my end!!!

we ordered veg manchow soup which was pleasant in terms to taste.. along with that tung fong chicken which had a nice flavor but it looked like KFC's chicken .. though the flavor was good...
in main course i had heard gravy noodles were good so ordered pan fried noodles... i did not get even one strand of crispy noodles..  along with that we had ordered chilli garlic fish.. it was nice but could have been more crios n spicy as it was dry.. overall lfood n place is good...

Tung fong is one of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata. Tung fong has a huge variety of dishes and the taste is awesome. It also has a bar and it serves hard drinks.¬† They have a buffet service in the afternoon's which has a variety of dishes. No doubt in their taste. Ambiance is also great and service is good.¬† I have visited here many times it has never given me a bad feeling. It gives you a feel of real continental and chinese delicacies. The place is very big though is remains crowded at weekends, so you just might have to wait outside for some time.¬† A must visit if you are in kolkata.

Tung Fong adds to the rich tradition of Chinese restaurants in the city. Good place for a dinner with family or friends as it is spacious and well laid out. The staff is courteous and efficient and the food is hot and spicy, exactly the kind of Chinese food that we like. The Golden Fried prawns are great and so is the crab. The portions are ample and a half plate of rice or noodles is actually all right for two adults. The fact that it serves alcohol too adds to the attraction. Overall, a nice package.

Never looked beyond bar-b-q or a marco polo in park street for my chinese food cravings. There are a few reasons for the same inspite of crossing over tung fong numerous number of times. One being location on the one way free school street, so have always moved to that side of park street with a pre decided destination in mind which is mocambo. Never saw queues or people waiting outside, thanks to the pretty big and comfortable waiting area inside. Third is that seeing the entrance, i never perceived it to be a big restaurant but i was proven wrong yet again once i stepped in.

 Located beside mocambo on the free school street, tung fong specialises in chinese cuisine. Reading the other reviews, i am almost sure that the place is a sister concern of Kim Ling and Beijing which are pretty widely known. The parking is not so much an issue. The restaurant is large and could contain pretty large number of people. It has a pretty big waitng area too inside with seats for around 12 people to sit while waiting which is appreciable. The decor is simple, nice with the central dome shaped structure in the ceiling adding a lot of elegance. The seats are very well spaced and comfortable. 

The staff is polite, courteous. The service is fast too. The menu is a predominantly non vegetarian menu yet the staff is pretty knowledgable about the vegetarian dishes which i find lacking at various such places. 

Cheese, cheese corn spring rolls were innovative offerings atleast for me since i have never had them earlier and they were  simply amazing. Veg spring rolls were decent but could have been great for more finely chopped veggies inside. Soups are really good be it the wonton soup or a manchow soup but the latter is better of the two. Fried rice was decent but not the best i have had. The staff prepared us some tofu and mixed greens in hot garlic which was not on the menu and it was nice. Overall very satisfactory dining experience.

They offer food in half and full plates in which half is meant for two people and i thought it was indeed good enough for a couple. This also enables people to try more variety.  Anyways, the prices are very decent for pretty generous servings.  The pricing is even lower than that of bar-b-q which is great. We had two small soups, one starter, one rice and a vegetable in 600 bucks. 

I must say the experience here was wonderful and i think i have just added another place in park street to my all time favorites. But i feel a few more variety in veg starters could add to my experience in the long term.

If it would have been only for food quality -I would have given Tung Fong a minimum of 5 stars..but considering the high nose serving staffs & the manager as well ( who will insist in making you sit in HIS preferred table--despite the whole. restaurant is almost vacant --as we visited around 4 pm) is what kind-a irritating.. My favorite remains as Chilly Garlic crab claws( order more than 2 plates at the very first time as its always having availability issue) &  Schezwan crab meat ..Thai soup & walnut toffee ice cream also deserves special mention...

My favourite Chinese restaurant on Park Street. Sprawled across nearly 5000 sq ft, Tung Fong is easily among the largest restaurants in town. So you can enjoy a meal without the people at the table next to you virtually breathing down your neck, in an ambience that soothes your eyes. Prices are probably a little steep compared to the quantity of the food, but the lunch buffet is worth every penny. If you're going a la carte, make sure you order the Tung Fong special fried rice and the smoked lamb. Another dish worth trying is the kung pao chicken, though it may be slightly spicy for some. What Tung Fong is really good with is prawn, right from the prawn chips as starters to prawn foo yong. Highly recommended.

80% of the times we visit Park Street we end up hogging at the Tung Fong. For all those who crave for Chinese food, this place is a definite 'give a try'. Although most of the time you would find it rather difficult to grab upon a table (pertaining to the house-full status this restaurant depicts mostly), the wait IS worth. Tum Yum soup, hot pot soup, prawn fried wonton, hakka chilli fish, kung pao chicken are a selected few from my list of favorites (the list being endless). Can give a double thumbs up for the food and going by the volume they serve, the price is pretty justified. A perfect dine in experience with friends and family, this eatery is a sheer delight. 
Next time you visit Park Street, give your taste buds the satiety of Tung Fong.

This was my second visit to Tung Fung.  Ambience was pleasant, quality of food was good. We had went for a lunch buffet. 
Soups and Salads were good, Sole non-veg item in starter was chicken drumstick. It was bit oily and the taste did not meet our expectations comparing to the highly popular Drums of Heaven.  Also the Prawns were missing from the spread. The main courses served were satisfactory except the chicken. The lamb dish was excellent on account of tenderness. But again non-veg items were few, and not being replenished in time. Desserts were a big disappointment. The desserts spread not up to the mark as one would expect at this moderately high price. Definitely it could had been far better. I was impressed by the attentive service given to us during the visit. Rating as Average for little options for non-veg items in buffet, and disappointing desserts, otherwise it should get a Good rating. You can be here and experience good chinese food in Kolkata.

Was there to get some good chinese food packed for home on the occasion of my dad's birthday.Truth be told i was not disappointed at all. I had ordered chicken american chopsuey,mixed fried rice, chilli garlic pepper fish, chicken in black bean sauce and red pepper prawns.Nothing much can go wrong with dishes like American chopsuey and mixed fried rice in a classy joint like Tung Fong. The chopsuey was tangy and had just the right mix of sweet and sour of taste.Only complain was that fried egg was missing.Either they had forgotten about it or do not serve it at all with the chopsuey, which is strange to say the least. The mixed fried rice was also well made and had loads of shredded chicken and shrimps in it.The fried fish contained cubes of  beckty-fried in loads of chopped green chillies. Though the sight of plentiful chillies was scary but surprisingly the dish was not spicy at all.The red pepper prawn was decent though my folks found it to be too spicy for consumption. Same holds true for the chicken in black bean sauce.The dish was very tasty and highly recommended by the chef.But alas too spicy for me to handle it. Portions in this joint are huge.A full plate would suffice for 3 people who are "normal" eaters.Half plate would be enough for a couple.Quite an improvement on the quantity front as compared to my earlier dine-in visit.My only complain is about the prawn dishes at this joint.The prawns lacked the flavour and the dishes are too pricey.I mean a half plate of finger sized prawns priced at Rs 424/- is too much to ask for.Rest all was fine.We all were happy after the meal and that is what matters at the end of the day. Isn't it?



Well managed to visit the restaurant yesterday on the occasion of Mahalaya in the evening.The joint was almost empty and the waiters were quite surprised to  see us walking in that early for a meal.It was five in the evening.We had no plans for a full-fledged meal .Thus opted for a couple of drinks accompanied by snacks/finger food.
Ambiance:The interiors were classy indeed and the space is huge.The dome shaped structure in the centre of the hall was the eye-catcher.No wonder Tung Fong is famous for their lunch buffet.The spacious interiors is ideal to enjoy a buffet unlike the cramped environment in most joints.In fact one side of the dining area is fully dedicated to the buffet counter.It was non-functional though when we were there.
Food: We tried the Drums of heaven, Red pepper fish, Tung fong fried chicken, spicy chilly lamb.The quality of the food was decent enough especially the red pepper fish and the drums of heaven.They serve a  sweet garlic sauce as a condiment which is yummy indeed.Prices are reasonable  given the posh locale of Park Street.Most of the items are priced below Rs 200 barring the exotic prawn and crab dishes of course.Another plus is the economical prices of drinks.Large peg of Smirnoff vodka at Rs 175/- says it all.However the drawback was the quantity of the dishes.They have this system of half/full plates.According to them half would suffice for 2 persons while a full plate is meant for 3 persons.However we found out to be highly inadequate.Given the fact that the the joint is owned by the same person who owns Kim Ling and Beijing at Tangra( unconfirmed fact i must admit and based on hearsay), we were expecting the size of helpings akin to Tangra. But alas that was not to be.
All in all a decent joint to enjoy Chinese food and also a buffet at right prices on Park Street, though experts would readily say that Bar-B-Q is a better option.

Got a takeaway packed for tonight's dinner from tung fong. The food was great, as usual, though I feel for the price we end up paying, the quantity isn't all that great. We settled for chicken talumein soup, smoked lamb, veg hakka noodles, chicken hakka noodles, hot garlic prawn, chilli fish, kung pao chicken and honey chicken. The food was mostly on the spicier side, and we loved every bit of the taste, though I failed to understand why the honey chicken, being of the main course variety, was devoid of any gravy at all. The smoked lamb, my favourite from this restaurant, lived upto the expectation. The hot garlic prawns were just that, hot and yummy. The rest of the dishes were strictly okay, nothing too great to write about. The bill came to Rs. 2300+.

A decent place in a locality like park street to satisfy your taste buds...it does not bite your pocket much but gives you a good bite...good ambience is something I might add to the list...good service whether you choose buffet or a la carte...a genuine food stop to stop by. Has been one of my regular places to eat.

Another visit to Tung Fong today. This restaurant is not my first choice for Chinese on Park Street (I usually prefer Flavours of China) but tonight I was quite surprised by their food and attentive service. We ordered a Prawn Manchow soup, Prawn foo Yung, Non-Veg Mixed Garlic Fried Rice, Five Spice Chicken and their signature dish Hot Chilli Prawns. The meal was overall satisfactory except the Chicken. What really stood out was the Prawn Foo Yung - it was amazing! Especially when mixed with their green chilli paste (which itself is a wonder). I was also impressed by the attentive service given to us during the visit. Really enjoyed the visit and shall be back for more!

Location (Rating - 4):
Located just about 30 seconds walk from Park Street and Mirza Ghalib Street Crossing onto Mirza Ghalib Streeet. Beside Mocambo.

Ambiance (Rating - 4):
I really loved the ambiance. The decor was modern cum traditional chinese, the lightings were perfect on the eyes. Only the irritating part were the guests who wanted the whole restaurant to hear their conversation.

Service (Rating - 5):
The staff were very polite and courteous. Quite well trained and served everything very quickly. Compared to other restaurants there was not much waiting time for the food to arrive after giving the order.

Food (Rating - 5):
Food was nice actually really nice. I would say that it was the best chinese food I have had in Park Street well of course in parity to Flavours of China. It tingled the taste buds in the right manner. I specially enjoyed their sweet chilly sauce. It was something new.

Price (Rating - 4):
The price was alright compared to the food and ambiance at Tung Fong. Not expensive at all. Dinner for 2 without drinks is approx 600 rupees.

decided to have my 2013 independence day dinner at tung fong on a rainy evening. thankfully, due to the rain, the crowd was less and we easily got a good table. ambiance and decor was nice and ethnic. stuffs were courteous and guided us to choose our menu well. we ordered various chicken, prawn and fish delicacies and all were very tasty. liked the food very much. amount per portion was quite enough. for example, a portion of chicken fried rice can easily feed 2 adults. chicken side dishes mostly contain 10-12 pieces of boneless chicken which again can feed 2 adults easily. overall, the experience was very nice. it's not costly, but not too cheap as well. i guess the cost per couple would be around 1200-1400 for a good sumptuous dinner with 2 starters, 1 rice and 2 side dishes. definitely a must visit for you in park street area if you are a chinese food lover like me.

Specially the butter fish fry and the chilli garlic lamb. The huge space makes you feel relax and comfortable.I get a vintage feeling whenever I go there because of its enormous space.

The best Chinese food in the Park Street area. Exceptional food, great ambience, crisp service, excellent value for money. Plus, the place is large enough to seat a lot of people, so you might just get to enter without any waiting queue (which one often encounters in other restaurants in the area) during the busy hours. I have been to this place a huge number of time, and each time they have impressed me. 

So, on a given day, 

if your eating needs = f(Chinese @ Park Street), 

the inevitable solution is Tung Fong.

Tung Fong is the best Chinese restaurant in the Park Street area!
They never disappoint you with the quality and taste.
Almost everything you order here is tasty and will taste the same if you revisit after 6 months!
Every time I visit here I'm sure to order "drums of heaven",as it's totally yum!

The service can be varying,as once I remember a waiter had  misbehaved with us because my friend changed her order(within 2 mins).
But when I revisited I could not find that guy again.
All the other waiters are good and look really experienced!

I also feel,this place is a total value for money.
Quantity,quality and ambiance justifies the amount of money you pay for your food!

I'd keep going there,as I have been doing so far!

The serving staff are very pleasant as well and considering the footfall in there, food was served extremely fast. The seating is very spacious and the mints at the end are a nice touch.

My earlier visit here was a very pleasant one. This time, however tried their lunch buffet and my experiences were mixed. We reached around 2:30 pm, which certainly is not very late. The first disappointment was the complementary beer they gave - Kalyani Black Label. I hope they either give us something better or do away with it altogether. Coming to the menu, at first thought we thought it was a vegetarian buffet. The non-veg items were few, and they were not being replenished in time. The chicken in cashew nuts was bland, noodles were somewhat good. The prawn in garlic sauce was a savior, the best item on the menu. Desserts were a disappointment as well, we couldn't find any. Only when we asked the waiter about ice-cream did he serve us all-two scoops each. So much for the have as much as you want in buffet.
The darsan had finished almost and we had to do with whatever little was in the bowl.They charge quite a good amount for the buffet, I sincerely hope it improves the next time I go there.

This place is grand. Situated in the Park Street area just beside Mocambo and competing with so many other places serving chinese, Tung fong makes its mark with its very fine food. Complementing it, is the superb decor and ambience. Its on par with Mainland China and the likes. The service is quick, waiters are friendly. Had a lovely lunch in this place. Will Definitely come here again!

Tong Fong is one of the esteemed Chinese restaurants in Kolkata.
The ambience inside Tong Fong is commendable. It is spacious and the decor is pleasant.
The food available represents a wide range of variety.
Most items are Chinese dishes but there is  some continental cuisine to be found.
For starters or appetisers I would suggest the hot pot soup, the tum yum soup and the chicken mushroom thick soup in the soups department.
you may like the butter fried chicken,the tong fong fried chicken,crab claws,Chinese style fish finger and the spring fish.
For the main course I'd suggest the chicken egg fried rice , the egg Cantonese chow,and your choice of mein foon(rice noodles). For the entree I'd eat a fish with pakchoi and any choice from the wide variety of chicken available. You should stay away from the lamb.
In deserts you can't really go wrong. everything is up to the mark and compliments the delicious maim course you just had. I'd go for the classic vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce or the black forest.
All in all I think Tong Fong is a wonderful restaurant and the service is extraordinary. If you ever dine here you're gonna wanna come back again.

Tung Fong is my favorite chinese  restraunt in Kolkata. It is a place where you go and enjoy authentic chinese cusines. 

Two things anyone wants from a restraunt: -

1. Food is delicious. You can get authentic chinese flavour here.
2. Service is good. The staff here are all professional.
3. Easily accessible. Just beside Mocambo.

Two things to worry about: -

1. It's a little expensive, maybe because of the location.
2. Lack of privacy if you sit on the long sofa.
3. Quantity is little less, not enough for two people.

Well, overall i love this place because of the first two points - awesome food and good service. :)

Chinese...clearly the first choice for all us bengalis...(Mughlai being a close second)....

Tung Fong is a great breather compared to the other overly clustered restaurants in park street...

Thumbs Up: :)

- Great ambience (8/10)
- Authentic taste (7/10)
- Perfectly spaced out tables - not climbing on top of each other (10/10)
- Extremely good fried wantons - a must try!! 
- Chili Lemon chicken was nice
- Prompt Service - decent wait time (7/10)
- Quite reasonable on the pocket (8/10)

Thumbs Down: :(

- Walnut Toffee...was really looking forward to it..but depressed to find the walnuts not crunchy..felt quite old..not even remotely sweet (2/10)
- Missed the traditional Date Pancake in the menu

All in all...a must go for all who would like to bite into a bit of traditional chinese food in a comfortable classic restaurant of our good ol' Park St.

Tung Fong is one of the nicer Chinese restaurants in the city. Located off Park Street, this place attracts a fair crowd. This place is also among those run by someone of Chinese origins, which reflects in the quality of the food.

Most of the items served are very good. In particular, he lamb dishes are recommended on account of the tenderness of the pieces. The spices and seasoning are rarely overdone, so the dishes aren't too hot or two sweet. They also serve a rather nice Pak Choy, which is not cloyed with oil or drowned in sauce. The quantities per dish also substantial.

The restaurant is spacious, and large groups can sit apart in comfort and converse without overhearing what goes on at other tables. The waiters are polite and the service efficient. The only negative factor is the high price of the meat and fish items.

Overall, an excellent place to go to for a meal.

In an area full of restaurants competing to be the best, Tung Fong has certainly left a very prominent mark as a brilliant Chinese restaurant. 
First of all, the decor has a fine touch of class, at par with any of the costlier restaurants of Park Street. Another great point is that the place is really spacious and the arrangement gives the diners a little space of their own. 
The food here tastes amazing. I honestly have nothing to complain about or want to change about the dishes. Considering the quality of food and the look of the place, the prices are reasonable too.
A must go for Chinese lovers looking for a new place to try.

If you want quality food at moderately high price with a perfect dine in ambience - tung fong is the place. It is situated near the uk visa office. Basically, it offers Chinese food. Food is pretty delicious but fails as compared to barbq. Ambience is quite cool. Their buffet is also pretty good but not the best. 

Best part about tung fong is it accommodates a large number of space which gives it a chance to make a perfect ambience for dine in. Service is pretty poor not upto the mark. Could have been better. And it is
Costly too.

Tung Fong is one of those  places which pulls you towards it with a magnet and even if you are annoyed at that point you will have to change your mood after the meal. It serves one of the best Chinese cuisines in Kolkata and is a must for people who simply relish Chinese food. It has an ambience which is difficult to find out for people these days because it has a certain wonderful air about it which I am sure attracts many people towards it including me. The  service is fast and polite and the food , though on the higher side in terms of money, is pure bliss. The Drums of Heaven are I think smuggled from heaven above and the Chicken Wontons are a delight.You should also try out the Thai Soup.The Chicken Hakka Noodles and the Mixed Garlic Fried Rice taste awesome with the Kung Pao Lamb and the Crab Claws in Black Pepper. 

Pure Delight

Again a great place to be if you like the Chinese cuisine.  great interiors, good ambience and good food makes it a attractive choice. However the price is a tad on the highet side and the quantity sometimes defying the price makes it a bit vulnerable among the numerous Chinese restaurants available in the city. but then again its located in the heart of the city.  so thumbs up.

A hottt and spicy spot in Park Street.One can enter without any hesitation in here,for Chinese and Thai food. The decor and ambiance is excellent,a mix of Chinese culture with modern interiors and decor. The circular mid section seating is awesome,it gives you a different feeling while having your food. The seats are well cushioned and service is quite prompt. Now,the food,the quality,taste and presentation all are truly delight full. The soups are good and really tasty.Leader boards  are THAI,Chicken/Prawn SWEET CORN,Chicken/Prawn TALUMEIN Soups They serve their stater with 3 special sauce,among which the Honey-Lime and Chilli is the best.The best starters are RED PEPPER CHICKEN ,GOLDEN FRIED JUMBO PRAWNS,FISH IN SOYA and HONEY and more....In main course the MIXED/PRAWN MEIFOON( Rice noddles),PRAWN CHILLI and GARLIC Rice and CHICKEN SEZCHWAN Rice are hot picks and personal favourite.And in side dish a must have is the Specialty dish *SEAFOOD COMBINATION*-king of all side dishes it is a awesome combination of Whole Prawns,Sliced Fish,Crab meat saute'ed in a unique soya sauce with selected fresh herbs and veggies.The dish is awesome,you will come here again and again for this dish only if once tried. Desserts, I'll  recommend to walk down the street an indulge your self in the delicious,mouth watering desserts of Flury's,which needs no description.And if not try out the ice creams with Darsaan and the Trutti Frutti is also good. 
            So, be here and experience the best Chinese and Thai food experience in Kolkata.

Visited this Chinese joint after a long time and it didn't disappoint me or my family at all!
The age-old homely ambience still greets you once you enter the restaurant.
And they still serve one of the authentic Chinese cuisine in the city though food has become a lot more pricier.
Quality of food and portions served was something no one can complain about. Lipsmacking crispy mutton and golden fried prawns make a wonderful start with thai soup. 
Cantonese noodles is something signature here and all of us loved it! But the fried rice is something one can skip here.
The waiters are eager to serve and they do mindfully take the orders and suggest you just the correct portion so that wastage is less.
Have to be among the top performers even after so many years in business!

TUNG FONG BECKONS!

To sample authentic Chinese cuisine head to Tung Fong on Park Street. This is another address for all things Chinese by the owner of Beijing and Kim Ling. Like their cousins this place will not disappoint you. The decor, the spacious sitting arrangement, and the tables with a 360 degree rotating smaller disk on the table makes having food here a pleasure. The menu is extensive, exhaustive and well written. Certain dishes even come with a description of what they contain. 

One can order straight from the menu or just head towards the buffet table. For starter there is the highly popular Drums of Heaven and the Chicken or Prawn Shaslik, you can never go wrong with them. For the main course if you have deep pockets order as much as you can from the specialty section. Begin with Prawn or Chicken Lung Fung Soup and the Four Treasure Tofu  and then move onto the Honey Chicken and Mixed Szechwan Chow. But if you prefer Mei foon or rice noodles to rice check out their Chilli Garlic Rice Noodles available either with chicken or prawn or both. If you can stomach the extremely salty taste of fermented bean sauce then try out the Prawn in Black Bean Sauce. The Crabmeat with Pakchoi dish is also praiseworthy. For those who love their lamb there is the lightly spiced Hakka Chilli Lamb. The chefs are generous with their meat portions not only in terms of pieces but size as well. End your sumptuous dinner or lunch with the Black Forest Sundae. You can expect not only great food but excellent food service as well. At such reasonable prices and for  such quality and quantitative food Tung Fong on Park Street is the place to go or be at all times.

I always thought how actual Chinese food will taste. I have passed beside Tung Fong a lot of times but never managed to enter. But I always had a feeling that may be this is the place which can give me the real feeling of Chinese food.

One Thursday my classes at a nearby coaching center got over due to low attendance of students because of  exam and thanks to them, as their teacher finally got a chance to visit to his long thought food station.

Just after entering into Tung Fong I got a feeling that this is the place of my choice. The ambiance made me feel that this may be a place on a street of a city in china . Each and every corner is filled with Chinese architecture from chairs to ceilings.  

Now coming to the food section. 

I ordered mixed Cantonese Chow along with Manchurian lamb. I thought it would take a bit long time but surprisingly they placed the two dishes within 10 to 12 minutes. I grabbed the spoon and it was utter delightful joyride into the planet of food. I finished it within half an hour.

When the waiter was taking the plated away I thought of ordering something more but my stomach was not ready to cope up with my taste buds as it was already fully loaded with the vast quantity of Cantonese Chow and Manchurian Lamb. 

Behavior of waiters was so descent. I had a feeling that in this type of restaurants I must have to talk in English and must behave in a highly sophisticated manner, but Tung Fong made me feel like eating at mamar bari( mother's brother's home).

I am going to revisit to capture the feeling again and again. 

Oh, one thing I forgot to mention; after getting this much the bill came to my table was showing me the numbers which made my thought of revisit even stronger!

Tung Fong is undoubtedly one of the best places for Chinese cuisine in this city. Never has this place disappointed me; in fact it has always elicited nothing but a "wow" from me and other diners. The service and decor are impeccable, and the lighting and the tables are absolutely delightful.

To blast off, choose the Chicken Mushroom Soup (Thick) and follow it up with the blissful Prawn Fried Wonton and Chicken Shaslik. It is one of the few genuine places in Kolkata which really have the skill and confidence to offer a large variety of dishes. Kudos to them for none that I have tasted have seemed bland to me. The Chef's Recommendations are usually mind-blowing, and I make sure to choose a new one each time I am in the mood to experiment. The Four-Treasure Tofu is a personal favourite, and so is the Kung Pau Lamb, Chicken Cashewnuts, Prawn in Black Bean Sauce and Crab Claws in Mint/Black Pepper.

The helpings are substantial and the dessert section too is great.

Verdict: Located at Karnani Mansions, they offer you great food and are on the slightly higher priced side. A complete meal for two would cost around Rs. 1200-1500 ($25 - 30) without alcohol. I have never been let down and each time, they just seem to get better!

Fairly decent place to have dinner. The best thing about Tung fong is the feeling of spaciousness that you get when you enter. High ceiling and the tables really spaced out gives one a nice relaxed feel. The food is good but used to be better till about a year back.

Lunch buffet is well priced but their food lacks consistency, most items range from average to good whilst some items are over cooked, the fish is not fresh. Overall worth the money, they're slow at renewing the food, trays lie empty for quite some time during the buffet

I have been visiting this restaurant for the last 12 years. I have no complaints as on date as regard to the food, service, reception, ambiance of this place. 
A visit to this place is a complete refreshing experience. To name a few of my favorite dishes are:
1) Crab Claws
2) Butter Fish
3) Fortune Rice ( Mushroom Rice)
4) Drums of Heaven
5) Chicken Cashew 
6) Prawn Wantons 
7) Golden Fried Prawns

The list is never ending. I believe they will continue with their good work.

My personal favourite is the lunch buffet. As far as lunch buffets go it has one of the most economical lunch buffets in the city and at the same time boasts of a good spread over both vegetarian and non vegetarian sections. It is also a good place to have a professional or not-too-personal meet up. The decor is pretty good and the waiters are professional. I loved their smoked lamb and crispy mutton.

I generally opt for the lunch buffet here. The spread is quite decent. The salads are excellent. The drums of heaven and wantons offered as starters are also quite good. The main course consists of chicken/fish/prawns. Would love to see some lamb offered from time to time. Nothing special about the dessert section. Just some ice cream and fresh fruits. Would be better if they can add some pastries.

To sum it up, this is a decent restaurant with a nice ambiance which offers good food at reasonable rates.

TUng Fong is one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata. I have visited there 2 to 3 times. It has never failed to delight me. Ambience is cool and decor is great,,,food is exceptional and staffs are warm. I mainly visit there to have their Drums of Heaven which is just awesome,,the Crab Foo Yoong is delicious and they have various items of lamb,,,,amongst them the Shanghai Lamb is mu favourite. Cantonese Chicken and Mandarin fish is good and my most favourite dish among all the dishes is the Red Pepper... Guys,,for starters i would suggestst you to Chicken Fried Wonton and for dinner everything is equally nice.. Prices are affordable and sitting arrangement is comfy and the round table with sliding disks are too good. I would surely suggest you all to visit there and giving you 100% guarantee that you will be totally satisfied...I would rate 5.0 for them.

Everytime I'm in Kolkata, Tung Fung is a sure visit! Been there to binge in drink and/or food, and the delight keeps you bringing back to this great restaurant, time and again..

Surprisingly reasonable on price, without compromising the quantity and taste of food, they've managed to preserve their persona over all these years!

Whenever we are in the Park Sreet area and want to have Chinese food - it is Tung Fong that we go to. The restaurant has a large seating capacity - even then it is normal to wait to get a place. The al-carte menu offers a very good selection. The lunch buffet is surely worth a try for variety.

This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in the city..Love the ambience and the seating arrangement as well.. The tables are placed at a comfortable distance from each other and you do not have to overhear the conversations going on around you..
The Smoked Lamb is one of the best starters here and a must-have if you like Lamb..The Butter Fish Finger is another must-have here..
Overall..Very good!!

I have a definite soft corner for this restaurant that has built up since my childhood days and the place has lived up to its expectations every time I visited. Awesome and delicious Chinese food that suits tha Kolkatan palate at reasonable prices. Very prompt service and ample seating space. Just don't expect exotic and purely authentic Chinese dishes here.

i hav a soft corner for this restaurant. 

to beign with.. the decor. 
huge , spacious, and the central dome is beautiful,  love the round tables. 
although i don't like the all men seating on the mezzanine floor. its very stuffy up there. 

I simply cannot fault the food here.. maybe because i hav never had a bad experience here. the soups are wonderful.. especially the thai soup and the hot n sour soup. 

one of the very few restaurants that hav such a huge variety in lamb preparations. the kung pao lamb is especially mind blowing. even the black pepper crab claws are yum too . 

the rice and noodle portions are great too. 

i have never left this place unhappy ...

The first thing you notice when you walk in is the lavish floor spread, that too in a central park street restaurant. The ambiance is pleasing and surprisingly laid back even on a Saturday evening.
Knowing KimLing and Beijing, food was expectedly good and the Chilli Garlic Button Mushroom was the best dish over the entire dinner (I maybe a bit biased since That dish is the only reason I used to patronize KimLing in the first place)!
Service is Top Notch with the steward willingly accepting our request not to be seated at a table@the far end (My wife and I were made to feel comfortable sitting in a table meant for four even in rush time).
The Cocktail - PinaColada and Bourbon (J.D.) are fairly priced and go well with the ambience and pocket..
Overall it was a wonderful evening and definitely our (My wife and I) first choice for Chinese food from now on.

Tung Fong is a favourite place for both the spouse and I. But we were a little agitated at our experience this afteroon. We were waiting for a table. The family section was full. But the men's section had free tables. We were told those could not be assigned to us. We understood and we were waiting patiently in the lobby. With us were two other groups -- one with 4 gentlemen and a lady, another of two ladies. There was another larger party who were given a table before us -- we understood that they cannot engage a large table for a party of two, and kept waiting. Suddenly a waiter comes and ushers these two ladies to a small table in the gentlemen's section. We had requested for that table, but were refused since I (a lady) was part of the party. Moreover, these two ladies had come after us (quite some time later, in fact). When we told the waiter about it, the one who was receiving guests acknowledged the error, but did nothing to remedy that. We had no option but to leave. We decided to seek comfort in our beloved Mocambo -- to say Bye Bye to Thai Soup, and to welcome sizzler for our lunch.

The cost of reasonable as per the food, they are like any other old Park Street restaurant, the taste is Indian Chinese. The cocktails are not so special and it seems like some Chinatown restaurant has been placed at Park Street. But their seating arrangement is really nice and have a good old Kolkata ambiance.

Food is ok. But the staff and specially the floor managers lack courtesy, are rude and very unaccomodating!!!! They will not let provide you a seat even if the whole restaurant is empty coz you need to sit according to their preference( would want 8 to sit uncomfortably on table for 6 even though the 12 seater lies empty... They would not do anything to make the arrangement, would not ask you to wait untill the tables get empty ...would just say if "you can adjust in this then its fine else mind your own business and go somewhere else".Brainless and illiterate and an uncivilised excuse for a joint at least in park street to give...So foodies watch out before you go to this place...as the very thought to enjoy food is ruined!!! If I had the option to rate it in negative I wouldn't have done that even as in my opinion this place stands unworthy of the same!! 
The very idea to waste time posting this review is for public at large to notice the degradation of human values , ethics and respect for others!!!

Come home to authentic Chinese cuisine. In a city with people crazy about Chinese food, this place stands tall and commands a look from the dragon lovers. Yes, right from the starters till the dessert, you'll love every bite. The soups served here are good particularly the chicken asparagus and chicken mushroom soup. You may then chew on 'Drums of heaven' along with a drink. The chilly fish and pepper prawn items are as good. Items are priced reasonable when compared to the amount the serve. Ask for a full portion if you are three people or a half portion will do for a couple. A little more prompt service will do this place a world of good.

This is one of top notch Chinese Restaurant in city.  Tung Fong is running by a Chinese family, also owner of Beijing and Kimling in Tangra. Apparently the menu is similar to that and recipes are centrally organized by their Master Chef to maintain uniform quality and taste. The ambiance is quite elegant and pretty large. You have a fair chance to get an empty table here during weekend peak hours. 

One of the very few restaurants in Park Street which has a daily lunch buffet in place and it is rather economic. However I always prefer a la carte over buffet. In starter Chilly Garlic Prawn (creamy silky prawns with a scent of Garlic and chopped green chilies), Pan Fried Chilly Fish (simple and with minimum ingredients), Red Chilly Chicken and Smoked Lamb (very succulent) are highly recommended. I have tried their Yang Chu Fried Rice, Mixed Hakka Chow and Chicken in Black Bean Sauce as main course and the taste was outstanding. The taste of food is quite different from other Chinese food joint; rather you feel a lime grass essence which is bit contradictory from cheap Chinese food with typical sauces available elsewhere. 

Drink is not overpriced (as per last month: Bacardi@ 165 + Tax/60ml,  which is rather similar to other standard Restrobar like Bar B Q, Amber or Barbeque Nation). Overall a great place for celebration, price is bit higher side but quite justified with the quality of the food and service they offer.

I heard that the owner of this place is the same one of Beijing in Chinatown. I'd say that this place is just OK. Standard food with no extra ordinary amount. Nothing very special about this place. Stuff is also OK. Being a place in Park St., I assume that they charge a bit more and would say that, with that much to spend you can find a better place. Not a must visit place, just ordinary.

There is no improvement that I can imagine for this place, which says a lot. Even when I am dragged to Park street by friends there is no where I'd rather go.The buffet is very good.The la carte better.There is hardly any chance of going wrong with anything you order. I boldly ordered a cocktail once and every subsequent time I've tried different ones and never regretted it.
But do not get carried away and order desserts.

The ambience and interiors of Tung Fong is EXCELLENT and even the price of the buffet is not too high. ighly recommended for all those who are BIG foodies like me. :P

Around 2001-02 Tung Fong launched there buffet spread. From the owners of Beijing, and Kim Ling (Tangra) Tung Fong proudly put this group on the Park Street Map. What immediately strikes you when you walk in is the ample space. Its open and boy is it big compared to the floor space one would generally expect from restaurants in this area. 
The buffet never disappoints and is sheer value for money. I'm not too show whether I'd order drinks here or go for the A la carte dining option though. Nevertheless you can't go too wrong with the food. Inspite of being a lion when it comes to Non Veg food, this is one of the few places I actually enjoy the Vegetarian dishes too!
