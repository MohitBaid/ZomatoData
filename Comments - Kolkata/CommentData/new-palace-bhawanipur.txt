My friends and I had gone there in a large group. It is usually not very crowded so good for sudden plans. Food is good, not outstanding but I've no complaints either. Prices are reasonable. Interiors are well furnished and maintained. Staff behavior is good. Overall, its a good restaurant and I do recommend it.

Visited this place with a lot of expectations for good food but yes BUT it disappointed us. Truly it did. Well we ordered a plate of chicken schezwan fried rice and a plate of chicken singapore meifoo thinking that we would get some really good food at a reasonable price, but we were wrong the meifoon was no less than deep fried noodles. Everything had such a flat taste. And then we added a bit of table vinegar to it and this is the place where the disaster happened, the vinegar was stale the authorities don't even keep a check on it regularly. It literally turned into acid and we nearly burnt our throat !! üò¢ The staffs were very rude who didn't even pay attention to our complaint...We just walked out paying our bill and took a vow not to visit this place again.

Our expectations were completely shattered !!

New palace in Bhawanipur is quite a huge space. It serves a variety of delicacies including veg and non vegetarian food. It also serves dishes of lamb. It has a bar in it and you can order drinks with your meal.
Now coming to the decor it's very impressive. It has a huge seating area with dim lights and good music.

The rates of the dishes are quite normal and affordable.

I had chicken Drums of Heaven which was worth its@ price including GST. There are a lot of choices in grades and rice. I suggest you all to go for chicken dishes and there are a number of drinks like mojito and mocktails.

Overall one must visit this place if you are in bhawanipore.

I ordered online from this restaurant, sorry to say, the mutton biryani didn't seem like it was biryani. But the food quality, packing, and overall taste was satisfactory. But it felt like something was missing. It's more of a pulao with a mutton piece, egg and potato in it. Overall not very much as I expected.

Honestly I have had one of my worst restaurant experiences here not because of the food but primarily because of service and the unwillingness of the management to host us.
It was pujo time but the restaurant was far from crowded in fact pretty empty for pujo standards.
We ordered chicken tandoori, some kebabs and cold drinks to go with them.
Our food arrived pretty late but that was okay.
We were halfway done with the food when I asked for the cold drinks we had ordered. The guy serving the nearby table didn't want to bother himself with it and said that we should wait for the person who served us to come over.
We were almost done with the food when I asked for the cold drinks again and they gave us drinks of their choice because the didn't have what we asked for.

Total disappointment.
Never felt this unwanted in a restaurant before.

It is located near bhowanipur petrol pump.one of my friend suggested to taste their food.so we went their on our festival (navami).The inner decoration was very good.but the staffs their are no well trained.They are very slow to move one place to another.so,after we take a glass of water we decided to eat some Indian food.we orderd  veg pulao,chicken reshmi butter masala and Shahi paneer.taste was neighter very good nor bad.but it was ok.chicken reshmi butter masala was far better than paneer.
But one thing I recommend that please check the menu card what they provide you,they mentioned that all charges and taxes are inclusive but they didn't follow this instructions.. we told them about it.but they didn't hear,they ignore it..very bad.please update your menu card and rewrite that taxes and charges are exclusive.

The place is spacious, with a wooden furnished interiors and beige coloured furnitures. Apart from that the foods are satisfying, if not the best, and there is less to no taxes for the time being. Certainly a good place to chill with friends.

Was looking for some good pocket friendly food till we bumped into this restaurant.. 
Situated next to Purna Cinema in Hazra, is this restaurant.
To be very honest, we were not expecting much from here. But we had a pretty good experience..
The restaurant is very well decorated, with comfortable seating arrangement and is quite spacious..
The place is well furnished with good staff members.
Now,coming to the food. 
We thought of having north indian cuisine. 
They have some amazing chinese food as well. 

So for food. We ordered
1) PEAS PULAO
2) MUTTON BIRIYANI AND
3) CHICKEN LABABDAR

Well, the food came pretty quick and the food quality was very good. 
The pulao was very tasty with ample amount of peas and proper spices. Really liked the quality of the dish. 
It came in a small hari and is sufficient for one people. 

I personally loved the biriyani. It came with one egg and a potato. The mutton piece was soft and juicy.. 
The biriyani was very well made and the quantity is huge. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! 
Now, the chicken lababdar complimented both the rice items pretty well. 
There was nothing special about it though, but the combination of biriyani with chicken lababdar was amazing. 

So, if u visit this restaurant, try to have the biriyani with the chicken lababdar if u r a biriyani lover like me. 

Now, coming to the service. 
The service was pretty good, we were served quite fast and the staff members were good as well. 
There is no additional tax which is great for college goers like us. 

Out bill was around 470 making it quite on the affordable side. 
Really liked the place and would highly recommend it.

Two days back I went to this place with my friends. It has like really cosy seating arrangements. We ordered tandoori roti, chicken bharta and mutton biryani. They gave complementary papad. The food was normal, neither too good nor too bad. The service was more or less good. But it's really cheap. Like really really cheap :3
The prices on the menu are inclusive of the taxes.
So, if are low on budget and have to go on a romantic date, do try this place. I don't think u will be disappointed. üëç

The fish was boneless (which is wow). The curry was rich and mouth watering. The quantity was more than enough. Considering and comparing the price with other leading restaurants of the city its head and shoulders above many. Only 1 thing I'd complain about-late delivery..please improve it.

Well have been there a number of times. I dont' why the rating is soo poor in zomato but I think this restaurant is a hidden gem. 
The ambiance is really nice specially if someone thinks about having a quiet romantic dinner.
I order mainly from the Chinese section and I think they need to work upon the North Indian section of food a bit more. One must try their Barbeque Chicken. It is really yum and also their Chicken reshmi kabab. The starter section is really good but they need to improve a bit their main course.

The staffs lack training. But otherwise helpful. The price is also reasonable.

Overall had satisfying experience here whenever I visited.

Been to New Palace a number of times, as it is just a few minutes' walk from my home. The quality of the food isn't consistent. It ranges from mediocre to great. Prefer Chinese dishes here than the Indian ones. Drums of Heaven and the sizzlers are very flavourful. Murgh Malai was another dish that I loved. Portions are generous. Had Darsaan for dessert, was good.

This is one of those underrated 'food joints' in Kolkata hidden amidst the closed cinema halls of Bhawanipore, and as such the place is ¬†never full. But ¬†for the price, the food quality is really good. I suggest try the Banjara Kebab for starter and stick to the North Indian menu. Yes, the ambience is simple, staff are friendly though not professional, but try the food for ¬†a surprise.

Want to know the worst place in Kolkata? This is the one. Had to come here, as was invited by a friend. The decor and the food are entirely different. The decor is the beauty and the food is the beast. Nothing tastes good here. The prices are high, which get higher thanks to the multiple taxes. The service is long enough to turn your hair grey. When the only thing good thing about a restaurant is the chairs, you know your in the wrong place. The staff don't know what they are doing most of the time. So if you want to do something better than throwing your hard earned money in the Hooghly, this is the place you should visit.

Like, Why did even god allowed this restaurant on the face of this planet! A bill of 1200 but as per the quality and quantity, we wasted our money. RUN! RUN AWAY AND AVOID HOLES IN YOUR POCKET AND LIVER!

Gorgeous Ambiance. Highly untrained staff, they don't serve you water until you place an order. While eating they will show up every 10 minutes to ask you, which is irritating. This place was not at all crowded and ‚ú©neither was there any rush‚ú©, that's why Zomato has this rating.

Heads:5x Rs 240(we are students)
Orders:
3x Chicken Biryani
1x Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala
1x Chicken Bharta
1x Salad

‚òÖChk Biryani(3/10): Just like the trolls on Lays(free chips with air) we were surprised they gave us a little bit of rice for free in addition to the potato,egg and chicken. I could surely eat 3 plates with sides with this quantity. Charging Rs 169 a plate, there are better restaurants to save your life. The quality was just average.

‚òÖChicken Reshmi Butter Masala(3/10):That moment when, you got customers but no ingredients for food, and you cook a dish called chicken reshmi butter masala which tastes like it's made by a chef who has an mbbs degree. 6 pieces, soft and well cooked, bland.

‚òÖChicken Bharta(6/10): I would have walked out on a wheelchair if this wasn't ordered. Almighty Lord blessed us something which had a taste. The chef might have made a mistake here, coz it didn't taste as bland as the reshmi.

‚óèSalad: The local bazaar deserves this point, though the quantity was still less around Rs 70.

‚òÖWater(10/10)‚òÖ: This dish is a must try and it's free after an order is placed. You won't be disappointed with the quantity since it's like an unlimited buffet. This was the best we had here to be honest. You would miss out a lot if you don't try this.

This review is highly sarcastic.

The food served here is really awesome. The restaurant is well decorated. Probably one of the best ambience in terms of a multi-cuisine restaurant in Bhowanipore. We ordered Chinese. The drums of heaven tasted really nice and I recommend others to try it. We also had Egg wrapped rice, Kung Pao Chicken, Hunan Fish and Pan Fried Noodles, it tasted at par with some of the well known Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. But one thing which left me awestruck is the footfall in the restaurant. On a Sunday evening there wasn't any customer apart from us. It was strange to find a well decorated restaurant serving very good food on a prime location in Bhowanipore going empty.

New Palace turned out to be a great find for me in Bhawanipur. Have seen a lot of times whenever I come this side but never had the urge of going to this place. Well, this means I was in the losing side. This place turned out to be a gem in disguise because I never expected this place to be so good. And when you have less expectation and you get more it gives you more happiness and this is what happened with me.
I visited this place with one of my friend during lunch hours. Was hungry and to fill my tummy as soon as possible. Searched in zomato and found this place in my budget. 
As I entered, I liked the place. The interior was simple but classy and was comfortable. The place is spacious and had some quality furniture. The golden sofas added charm to the place.
The staffs were really well behaved with a smile always. They were attentive and did their job really well. Mohammed Akhtar needs a special mention for his quality service.
I took few basic things which turned out to be really good.
Chicken Pepper Salt: The starter was bang on and was just a perfect start. The proportion of spices and its taste was really good. The quantity was another criteria which they fulfilled quite brilliantly.

Chicken Fried Rice: Well, this was another basic dishes but it was great. It was not oily, very light and of great taste. Nothing more to say on this.

Cantonese Chicken: Lots of veggies, soft juicy chicken, very light, and yes the taste was yet again a hit. 

Last Words:
A place to go for as you would get a wide variety of cuisine here. The pocket pinch is just good enough to make you happy. The quantity and quality is worth the money.

A very late review I'm giving, but I just had to! The food is beautiful. My family and I went one Sunday, and the Indian cuisine won our hearts. Next time, we have decided to try the Chinese menu, and I have a good feeling - that it will b e as good. People, you have to visit this place!

This place is nice. small, cozy, and friendly ambience. you should come here and try the indian dishes. whatever they serve, it is fresh and well cooked. staff is also very good and polite. family or friends, whoever you come with, food is enjoyable and ambience is really good.

Visited this multi-cuisine restaurant today for a pre-birthday luncheon of my friend . We loved the ambience , it is big and spacious and ideal for a group of friends and it gives your party a full privacy. After the cake cutting ceremony we ordered our food which as follows, 
Drums of heaven
Chicken hakka noodles
Chicken fried rice
Thai red chicken curry

The food is preety good quality and quantity wise !! 
They are really underrated in zomato and i would like to mention this place to everyone specially for their ambience. Happy eating :)

A restaurant where the ambience is pretty good but the food is not. Based on the prices of food, the standard and quality is too low. Ordered muttln biryani and couldn't even finish the mutton as it was not cooked up to the mark. Ambience is not bad though but price is waaaaay too high for its quality.

Though this place is few minutes from my home i never visited this place.... today we had plans to visit hatari... but the horrible crowd of deshopriya park made us change our plan... and we decided to go to this place..

Decor : Decor is quite good.. neither its funky nor boring.. sober decor with decent lighting...

Food : We ordered 2 Mutton biriyani, 1 Chicken Butter Tikka Masala, 2 Butter Tandoori Roti... the mutton biriyanis were extremely ordinary...and my sister was served a piece of boneless mutton..but my bad fortune that i was served with only a bone having no meat in it... talking about the chicken butter masala.... it was so so... taste was good..but there was nothing to get delighted... and the tandoori rotis they served were made of atta...¬†

Price : Price was average... it was almost same as other tandoori restaurant...

Service : The service was good ... the boys were decent and well behaved.....¬†

Overall : Not Happy with the food...

New Palace is our go to place for home delivery with reasonable price and good quality food.
The ambiance is great to for dining at the restaurant. The decor is well done among the lot that we have in our locality.
The Kebabs are really good. Even the Chinese dishes are very tasty. 
Although they are a little slow at their service I still highly recommend this restaurant especially for the locality people.

This is a new find and it has got itself a position where it will not take it too long to get noticed. Service is slow and the man sitting at the reception has lots of room for improvement, He could start simply with a smile. I had chicken reshmi kabab and found it pretty average.

This will not be my first choice for dining or luncheon. But the chinese food is considerably good here. Their specialty is the Mutton biryani(both quantity and quality wise) and the kebabs. Moreover, it is not crowded and a good atmosphere almost always prevails.

First the good news , i heard from the management that they are planning to set up a BAR in the same establishment .   Now about the restaurant . New palace is situated   in between Bhowanipore PS & purna more in bhowanipore . The place is not too big   at the same time not cramped either  . The decor is modern & elegant . The food prices are moderate , but service is a bit slow . but that can be a hidden advantage as well . if you are in the mood to gossip  & not  Rushed into gulping your food , this can be a ideal place . However on my  recent visit , on a june evening , i found the place half empty , which was  a bit of a letdown as nobody enjoys going into  a half empty restaurant , howsoever moderate the prices maybe .  coming to food , stick to indian cuisine in this joint till the time the BAR opens .  they serve above average indian fare  at  decent prices . i specially liked their mutton delicacies , along with naan . we also tried ¬†fish tikka masala . in mutton the mutton boti masala was exquisite & the fish was soft bhetki & ¬† NOT BASA . the bill for 4 ¬†came to around 1200 bucks which was a pleasant surprise . ¬†my only suggestion to the management ¬†would be to market this place well so that it is always crowded , otherwise very decent . ¬† Worth ¬† ¬†visiting more than once . overall 3.5 from ¬†my side .

hoping the bar opens soon ¬†!!!

Situated in bhawanipur, the decor is OK but they have a serious issue with the service and food. We were 7 people in total and we were all kind-of angry¬† . 

we ordered kebabs, nuns¬† and Amritsari chicken ... now the kebabs were fine .. but when the main course arrived it was like the Hiroshima and Nagasaki disaster .. we couldn't eat a single piece of the Amritsari chicken it was so damn bad .. to much sweet and a weird taste ... i ate the nuns without anything .. service was also sluggish , we ordered our meals at about 8:20 and got them on 9:42 nearly 80 min¬† late, asked the waiters many times but they only said that the food is coming¬† ... personally don't want to go back to this place and in my views if you want to waste money and time please feel free to visit this place .

REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE

I ordered food from this place and it was delivered perfectly on time packed nicely, ¬†the food quality was above average and the proportions are ample for two people considering the fact that i ordered for one only. The only qualm i had about this place was that the gravy was very oily.¬†

Overall it was a nice experience ordering food from this restaurant, and the biryani was excellent.

Since this place is close to my dwelling place...so we didn't feel like going to the restaurant....ordered online 1 Chicken Haradhania Kebab, 1 Chicken Bharta,1 Chicken Biryani, 1 Chicken Fried Rice, 1 Mutton Biryani, 1 Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, 1 Tawa Murg Kali Mirch, 1 Butter Chicken. The order arrived in time with good packaging. Chicken biryani was good...served hot even after half hour of delivery. Quantity of chichen bharta was enough for two...so if you are two...one would be enough.The liked both the Tawa Murg Kali Mirch and Chicken Butter Masala specially for the gravy tasted awesome. Hardly find any difference between Chichen Butter Masala Butter Chichen as only the later was a bit spicier than the former.Haradhania Chicken was a waste of money, so guys don't go for it..nothing more...if I get time will drfinitely review you about the restaurant interiors....this restaurant is new but trust me you can definitely give a try...

Location: Bhawanipore. 

Situated at S.P. Mukherjee road, a few minutes away from Bhawanipore Police Station while traveling towards Purna Cinema, it's a small restaurant with a seating capacity of around forty heads, serves an above-average quality of fooding which doesn't quite compliment it's location and ambiance. 
Yes, the interiors of this place are quite attractive and impressive enough.
Have visited it twice since it's opening and have tried¬†both the North Indian and Chinese cuisine. Having said that, talking about the quality, the North Indian preparations are good as compared to the Chinese ones. 

The service out here is a bit too slow and the staff here, without batting an eye lid can be categorized under the laid backs! 
Prices are quite reasonable as compared to the portions they serve (read: generous). 

Overall an above-average experience.

My Favorite place any time. Located just beside my House. Its a new restaurant, but the North Indian Preparations are awesome. We are regular visitor from the day it was opened. Nice Interior. We love the family corner. Waiters are little inexperienced and sometimes the service is slow. Over all the place and food is very good.

New Palace is a fairly new restaurant which has opened up near Purna crossing on S.P Mukherjee Road. This is where the National Studio was located previously where I used to go frequently when I was in Primary school to get passport size photos clicked and any other camera related work. I have seen the hotel being built right in front of me since it is pretty close to my house. 
On 11th October Saptami night (2nd day of Durga Pujo), I decided to try this place out. 
Ambiance: The reception is quite grand and brightly lit with a view of the kitchen separated by see through glass. There is a punjabi guy who was seated at the reception desk. I and my friend reached there pretty late, around 10.30 pm. We expected that we wont have to wait much since the restaurant is not that famous, but we were asked to wait for atleast 15 minutes. We were hungry so patiently waited. After 20-25 minutes we were asked to go to the restaurant which was on the 1st floor. 
Upon entering I found that it is a small yet cozy restaurant. There are around 10 tables which can accommodate 40-45 diners. The interiors look pretty upscale, a bit cramped maybe but better than other restaurants in the vicinity (there are hardly any proper restaurants nearby). The walls are mostly white with brown patches of woodwork and furnishing. The chairs were comfortable but created a lot of noise when dragged, something I did not like. 

Food: Before we could order any food, it took a great deal of time and effort to catch the attention of the waiters. I understand that the restaurant was full but I could see a couple of waiters chatting and not attending to our calls. Finally after 10 minutes one of them came to take the order. Our order was very simple, since it was late I decided to jump to the main course directly. 1 Chilli garlic chicken noodles, 1 Schezwan chicken, 1 Green Salad and 1 Fresh lime soda sweet. 
First the fresh lime soda was served which tasted nothing like what it should taste like. We asked to change it and they did. 
The main course arrived in another 15-20 minutes. The quantity is pretty good, especially the noodles. But the taste and the quality was very disappointing. The noodles tasted spicy but the quality of noodles used was at par with the roadside stalls found at various junctions. The chicken also tasted very average. Yet again it failed to impress. I agree that the pricing is quite affordable, but that should not hamper the quality and taste of the food. The noodles costed Rs 140, the Schezwan chicken Rs 160, the green salad Rs 45, the fresh lime soda Rs 35 (+taxes). We were ordering from a Special Pujo menu, so the items were limited and the prices inflated (thats the general trend during Pujo in Kolkata )

Service: Service is simply pathetic to put it honestly. I agree that I should not expect blazing fast service during Pujo days, but it took more than 10 minutes to take the order, another 20 minutes to serve and 15 minutes to get the bill printed ! 

Final Verdict: With the ambiance, the pricing and the location, New Palace could have been the next big thing had they kept their food quality and taste up to the mark. I have been thoroughly dissatisfied with the over all experience. But then again I would like to visit New Palace once more during a normal day and try out items from the indian section as Ive heard that they serve good Tandoori items. As for my present experience I cant rate New Palace more than 3

Situated very near to my residence,yesterday night I tried this place with my family.The location,the decoration is very good.We were really impressed by the interior design.
Coming to the food,the place offers Indian and Chinese food.We had ordered fish finger for starters and chowmein,shanghai chicken,kulcha and mixed veg.The fish finger was really nice.They offered complimentary prawn chips,which was nice gesture.The main course items were decent and nothing exceptional.
The service was good.The prices are also affordable.
overall,service,location and decor 4/5
and food 3/5.

A newly opened restaurant at S. P. Mukherjee Road. One can try very good quality Chinese food here with variety of dishes. Price for quantity is pretty reasonable.The Ambiance is very good, quality of crowd is also good. One plate of fried rice is enough for two average eaters. A must visit for all Indian-Chinese food-buffs although we did't try North Indian dishes.

But the main problem is their service which is very slow, otherwise its quite pocket friendly.
