Located in the lane opposite to town hall just opposite to arsalan at hatibagan! It's a two floor restaurant with dim ambience. 
The food is decent and symptous. The order was delivered on time . 
We had roasted chili pork. The pork was tender and tasty. Along with it we had mixed schezwan noodles and garlic hakka noddles. 
Overall nice experience with a decent pocket pinch

This place was previously known as Gazab and they also offered Indian dishes. They used to have a Ice-Cream parlour too.But now they only offer Chinese.
The ambience is good and the place has a decent decor too.

*Chicken Sweet Corn Soup
It was good.
*Chicken Manchow Soup
*Chicken Cantonese Noodles
It was good.
*Chilli Chicken
It was decent too.

Having competitors like Arsalan and Aminia near around, this place still stands tall with its amazing dish tastes, service, people and varieties.. And all these followed up by being GST-free.

Among a number of options in the lane we chose this restaurant as we were craving for Chinese cuisine. Our order for today was mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken. Overall good experience.

Location:- Right Infront of HatiBagan Arsalan.
Ambience:- It has got a typical 'Chinese' ambience, though the Lighting was not good. The chairs were comfy.
We went for Lunch after Pandal Hopping today.
Service was Good. A 8/10 for the Service.
Now coming to the food, we ordered:-
1. Kung Pao Chicken- Small chicken pieces (10 pcs) stir fried in bell peppers & cashew. A 9/10 for this dish. 
2. Chinese Style barbeque Fish- 8 fish fillets in a sweet tangy sauce.
3. Chilli Chicken- Was Not upto the mark as it was not 'chilli', spicy at all. (10pcs)
4. Hot Garlic Chicken- 10 pcs of chicken in a sweet chilli garlic sauce. 
5. Egg fried rice
6. Chicken Hakka Noodles- The chicken pcs in the Noodles were not cooked properly.

Cons: Prices are too high according the amount served. The chicken pcs served are too small. 
Pros: Well Behaved staffs & prices are inclusive of taxes.

Gazab Restaurant is on Shyampukur Street near Hatibagan & adjacent to Town School. It is a multicuisine restaurant & opposite to Sutanuti Junction Restaurant. It is moderate in rate & quality of food is good.

Now they makeover and only concentrate on Chinese cuisine. 

One of my favourite restaurants from childhood.

A sudden plan for outing in the north and while we were hungry zomato was the saviour suggesting this place.
We ordered chilli garlic noodles, kung pao chicken and mixed vegetable in pepper garlic sauce.
The service was a bit late but the food made up for it.
The noodles were spicy and soft with perfect blend of garlic. The chicken was soft enough and we're awesome. Even the mixed vegetable dish was awesome.
 To top it all, there was no extra tax.
Really recommended..

Previously, this restaurant served all types of cuisine and remained fairly crowded. However, after arsalan and aminia sprouted nearby, they have turned only to chinese dishes. We entered at about 3pm last Friday to find ourselves as the only occupants. The ambience is soothing and the waiters are a bit inattentive. The food is average in taste with sufficient quantity and fair pricing. Prices are inclusive of tax. Overall, it's a decent place .
