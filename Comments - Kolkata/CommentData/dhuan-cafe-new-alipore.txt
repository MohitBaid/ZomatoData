Worst hookah parlour i have been too. From mahabirtala, you have to take an auto and you have to get down at a building called gupta niketan. It is on the second floor and the ambience is nice. But then again, all that glitters are not gold!! Sheesha are worst, as i doubt the guys over there dont know how to prepare it properly. Musics are over loud and the tracks are eventually bad. Guys are not at all attentive, you always have to go out and fetch them and place order!! Crispy chilli baby corn and paneer pizza is okk but way costly. And also lemme remind you, they dont accept cards!!!! So make sure you carry plenty of cash as no atms nearby. Overall i had a worst experience and also wastage of money. Surely will not check in here again.

Visited : once (april 2015)
location: take auto from mahavirtala. A lane just after the south city garden. Ask the auto to drop u infront of gupta niketan. You will find directions written on the walls using spray can.. 
ambiance: The place is never crowdy. They have disco lights and a music system installed. All over the ambiance is average. 
sheesha: not at all good. We ordered pan, mint, and blue berry. Not satisfied with any of the flavours.
food: Average. Baby corns were rock hard. How ever, the prices are pretty low in comparison to other hookah parlours.
service: not good. U have to go out and call them for every service u need.
Overall experience : not satisfactory

I started Hookah From This Place, Dhuaaa. We Visited This Place Recently With Some of My Friend. The Hookah are Good, but Sometimes it's not upto the mark. But the service is good and the workers their are friendly

Visited this place recently in a group of 6 girls and absolutely loved the experience. 

To start, like Aditya has already noted, this place is called Dhuaaa Cafe (and not Dhuan). It's in a building called gupta niketan, on the straight road (b. l. saha rd) that connects mahabirtala and karunamoyee (about a minute away from south city gardens). It's not the best of locations (though you get direct autos to it from either side) but if you've been through that route before, you'd know that there isn't much place to open an eat out. The approach is scary initially but the experience was just too good post that.

We went there with groupon coupons for hookah, mocktails, snacks and javaai ki thalis. We called ahead and reserved. It's on the 2nd floor of an old-ish looking building (a lil scary again) but the walls have graffiti all over that leads you till the cafe. It's not a very big joint and we were the only ones there initially (and quite disappointed with the place frankly) though it did fill up quite a bit after that. But post that, everything went uphill and that too at a very fast pace!

Now for what we found inside, in no particular order..it has board games (a +), good music (a ++), very warm and friendly service (a +++), decent crowd (a ++++), comfortable seating (a +++++), very good hookah and mocktails (a ++++++), awesome finger-licking good food (a +++++++) and very reasonable prices (a ++++++++). It also has a TV and a private party area that can be reserved ahead.

All in all, it was a wonderful experience and in spite of the hassles of reaching the place, we are sure to visit again!

PS: a) Don't lose hope when you see the place..walk in and experience it and b) Don't order their Blue Lagoon mocktail (was the only thing that didn't match the very high standards they set for everything else they served).

First of all zomato has got the name wrong as now it is dhuaaa cafe .
Now coming to the cafe , its a wonderful place because not only do they serve hookah over here but also multi cuisine food which is a life saver because in this area there are not many restaurants . the quality of the hookah is impeccable .
 The food they serve is nice can be better but it is value for money , i along with my friends tried the pasta ,noodles and the sandwiches which were upto the mark but could have been better . the servers are really friendly and they take a effort in serving you  nice hookah and also you get a free coal change with any hookah. the ambience of the place could have been better and one of the things i like about this place is that they serve u normal water from a water purifier and they also give you the option of cold water whereas in other places they give you a 600ml bottle of water and charge 30 -35 bucks .
         I will definitely visit this place again as they serve nice hookahs at a affordable rate and they don't cheat money out of people .

Dhuan cafe - a hookah parlour cum veg eatery.
======
Location: head straight from mahabirtala towards south city gardens. After crossing that, inside a tiny lane u locate this cafe.
======
Intro: i had been looking around near my home for sheesha and somehow discovered it while roaming around with a friend. Situated on the first floor. When i entered it was quite dim with loud music on. The tables had a light plus this place had an inner vip room.
======
Food, hookah and beverage.

1) mix sauce pasta - it tasted good
2) 3 paan - first when i came the staff quoted me 350 which was too pricey. However, on asking him he said prices are subject to increase and is 250. Decent sheesha.
3) orange chef special mocktail: it was good too. 
=====
Summary: 

Ambience 2.6/5
Food 3.5/5
Value for money 3.5/5
=====
Conclusion: i would like to visit this cafe again and review on changes. I hope that they work on my suggestions towards music, ambience n food. :)

It's a good place to hangover with friends . But the food service is slow . Else it's up to the mark.
