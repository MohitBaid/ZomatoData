First of all full marks for delivering on time around midnight.The first order was good(veg pizza +veg pasta).The italian food was good and cheap(Just replace your pizza base with a hard crust base).But in  my second order (veg fried rice + Paneer Bhurji) i was very disappointed.The food quality was very bad.The fried rice was ok.But paneer bhurji is not prepared the way it was delivered.It was totally dry.I was just given scrambled paneer dry.Attached Pic.This was not worth even half of what you charged.Please make your chef learn how to prepare this dish.

It was my first order so I ordered schezwan rice and lemon chicken...  Both were cooked very well...  Hope to try other foods from the menu soon..
