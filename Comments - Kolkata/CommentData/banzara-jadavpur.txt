If it was 2 or 3 years back probably I would put 5 for them. But in recent times this restaurant is no more a big hit for foodis. Although they serve foods at a very low price this outlet has decreased their quality of food. I find hard chickens in gravy atleast three times. Still I would recommend their mixed rice if someone visit this place.

2. The menu needs to add more variety of dishes.

This is my 3rd /4th visit to this restaurant. Earlier I used to come regularly in my school days but after a long time I am here again.  The quantity is humongous I must say just like previous days because we were seriously starving after a long day and still couldn't finish one plate full.. Our menu was simple consisting of mixed fried rice and garlic chicken. I was very impressed with the quantity of chicken /egg /prawn as well as the pieces of chicken, although I wish for the white garlic chicken instead of the red one.  But what's the point of putting ice cream at such a cheap price (rs 40 only) if you don't have them in Stock in winter??? Overall the food, quality, quantity and even the ambience was nice and soothing was overall great only they need to really work on the service which I felt was indeed poor and that's the only reason of deducting one whole marks.

Tried out the Chicken Biriyani and Chicken Chaap. They were decent.

Our order;
- Mutton Biriyani (2)
- Chili Chicken
- Chicken Sweet Corn Soup
Review;
Biriyani:- In terms of price to quantity ratio it was more than justified. Though the quantity was quite satisfying but size of mutton piece was quite small. Biriyani tasted okish cause taste was not upto the mark. A side dish is necessary with this biriyani.

Chili Chicken:- this was really well made. Tasty. Chicken pieces were justified. Plenty of capsicum and onion were there.

Soup:- soup was good and tasty. Chicken, corn all were in sufficient quantity.

P.S:- it was a take away order. The staffs were very cordial and they accept order by phone.

Another of those average restaurants in Jadavpur serving pocket-friendly Chinese and North Indian food. I visited this place once. We were a group of 4 and it was a treat from a friend. We tried their Fried Prawn and Mixed Hakka noodles. The Fried Prawn was real value for money with 8 medium sized prawns within 200 Rs. It came with complementary salad and was crispy and tasty too! The Hakka noodles however was mediocre. I have had better elsewhere. 2 plates of noodles was enough for four of us. However, people with higher appetite may require more. Service was decent. Ambience was quite nice at this price range. Overall, an average experience..nothing extraordinary nor anything too disappointing.

They do serve some delicious Chinese cuisine.. located near 8b bus stand jadavpur.. take the lane beside bawarchi.. 

We ordered chicken manchurian and mixed fried rice 
.. The quantity was huge.. It was more than enough for 2.. With ample amount of prawns..chicken and egg.. It was hugely satisfying..

Coming to the manchurian.. 8 large pieces of boneless chicken in a spicy gravy.. The gravy was really tasty but the chicken pieces being large in size was not soft and the juiciness was lacking bcz the gravy didn't soften the chicken... 

The service is bit slow.. so if u r in hurry avoid this place.. otherwise it's a great place for having Chinese cuisine.. dimly lit.. good ambience.. quality food..

They charge 5% GST.. Our bill was 360 Inc tax..

This restaurant is very close to my heart as it was quite a regular joint for my school friends and me. It used to be really good during our school days. But the quality of food and service has degraded a lot for the past few years! 

The last time we visited the place, we ordered a number of dishes. For starters, we ordered Dry Chilli Fish. Then we ordered Butter Nun and Shredded Chicken along with a plate of green salad. We also ordered a Mixed Hakka Noodles. Each item was so badly cooked that we had to complain about the dishes. But they seemed to be indifferent. The only remaining thing good about them is their quantity of food. Each dish is sufficient for two-three people.

I badly wish that they improve their food quality and services and turn into that awesome place they used to be even a few years back! 

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

A small and nicely decorated restaurant with red colour theme and chinese lampshed hanging from ceiling. Though the staff members over here a bit late in understanding and doing things, it didnt create much problem to our visit. Anyway but the food was really nice. The Red pepper chicken which we ordered had enough gravy and had 8big pcs of chicken in it. The dish was nicely cooked in red gravy giving it a slight tangy and spicy taste. The mixed fried rice was served hot with ample amount of prawn in it. Though i could hardly find chicken in it, yet the amonut of prawn could compensate for chicken. I had a quite decent and lovable visit. I would give this place thumbs up!

Banzara: It is one of my favourite places to dine out. There was a time I used to frequently visit this place. My preferable appetizer of this restaurant is Crispy Chilly Chicken the name says it all about this dish and Chicken drumstick Crispy chilly baby corn taste good. I like their chilly garlic chicken and hot garlic chicken and mongolian chicken with any like Manchurian fried rice or Hong Kong fried rice or plain simple fried rice it goes well

I have been visiting this place quite frequently recently. It's one of my favorite now-and-then food joint. The best part about this place is the quantity they serve.
I have tried many dishes but Mongolian rice is one of my favorites over here.
Shanghai fish is a must try.
I like lemon chicken too. (This particular dish is not liked by many so won't be recommending this)
American chopsuey is not that great as the fried noodle they serve doesn't remain crispy since the gravy is served over the noodle. So , I would suggest them to improve on that.

So I went there with my group during pujas. We has to wait for around 30mins in a queue and then we finally went in. The ambience was nice. Sitting arrangements were quite appreciable and the lighting along with the back ground music added a feather to the cap. We ordered Chicken Reshmi Butter masala,butter nun, chicken Biriyani. 
No complains about the taste,the food quality but the quantity wasn't enough only in case of biriyani. 
 Quality: 4/5

Ordered Vegetable Fried Rice, Chicken Handi and Chicken Chilli Garlic.
Starting with the rice. It was just how fried rice should be and was just for ₹150/- 
The Chicken Handi which cost ₹220/- was rich and flavourful. The spices had blended well with the thick nutty gravy.
Chicken Chilli Garlic was all garlicy and cost us 180 bucks. 
Both the side dishes were on the less spicier side.
Overall we had a great time ordering food from Banzara. Cant wait to order again.

We ordered 3 mutton biriyani from this place on shoshti afternoon and they were delivered pretty fast . The packaging was nice too. But the biriyani tasted horrible. It was only plain rice , chicken and had one aloo in it. There was absolutely no masala in it , no flavour , no fragrance. It was totally bland. The price is less compared to other biriyani joints , but the taste was pathetic.

This place was once a pretty decent place to have a dine-out and was a personal choice for a frequent take-aways. but recently , it has gotten soooo bad, it hardly resembles the quality of food it once had. hakka noodles are still nice here, but none of the gravy items are good, I had to waste half the gravy items I ordered, which consisted of chili paneer and chicken bharta. the prices are just no-where the reflection of the quality of food it has. tandoori roti is 30 rupees. trust me, it's just terrible to eat. I am never going back to this place ever again if it's the last place on earth to serve me food.

This RESTAURANT is really hard to locate.But once you enter this hidden gem,you will feel the essence of a bunch of experience staffs enjoying their job.
I have visited them for almost 5 to 6times.And each and every time they have just amazed me.
My last visit was with my wife.
We two ordered-
Half Tandoori Chicken
Banzara Special Meifoon
Sanghai Prawn
The starter was average,but no flaws.
Meifoon was also heart warming,both in quality and huge quantity.
The Prawn made my day.Perfect crispyness,huge 8pcs of tiger prawn @180,awesome sauce.Mindblowing and a must try.
Thankyou Banzara for such a great meal at just 600 INR.

First of all i do like the food served over here but had an extremely bad experience today.

Ordered garlic meifoon without prawns over phone and told them will pick it up in 30 mins. When i got there, the food was ready but they had prepared it with prawns. Told them to remake the dish without prawns. They agreed to it. Handed over the food in like 15 mins.

It took me only first bite to understand that they had burnt the dish. The egg, the chicken dices all were burnt. Moreover, the meifoon was not tossed in the sauces properly. It lacked taste. Plus, there was hardly any garlic throught the dish. It was just BURNT CHICKEN MEIFOON.

The chef must have known, while preparing the dish that he had got it burnt. In such a case, he should have prepared it afresh. Since, it is a takeaway, you pass bad food onto the customer! Where are the ETHICS?

This is a place hidden is bylanes of Jadavpur. We visited during late lunch hours of Independence Day. It was packed. Had to wait for 10-15 minutes. The food was totally worth the wait. 
What we ordered:

Red Pepper Chilly Paneer- If you love spicy food , order this. 
Garlic Chicken- well cooked, a little on the sweeter side.
Veg Chilly Noodles- Spicy and a must have
Veg Fried Rice- Did not meet our expectations after the first three delights.

Ambience is not so impressive plus service is not good. Foods are kind of average.
 I am not suggesting this this place, you can get a better experience elsewhere in this budget range.

Today I have visited the place with my family. It has justified it's fame for it's Chinese cuisine. I have ordered Chicken sweet corn soup, Veg noodles soup, Prawn Garlic Chilly noodles, Egg fried rice, Chilly fish. The quantity of food is enough and quality also. Staffs are well behaved. The most importantly the place is very much pocket friendly for treat. I'll give it a 4 rating.

This is a place hidden is bylanes of Jadavpur. We visited during late lunch hours of Independence Day. It was packed. Had to wait for 10-15 minutes. The food was totally worth the wait. 
What we ordered:

Red Pepper Chilly Paneer- If you love spicy food , order this. 
Garlic Chicken- well cooked, a little on the sweeter side.
Veg Chilly Noodles- Spicy and a must have
Veg Fried Rice- Did not meet our expectations after the first three delights.

If your wallet is not too thick to sate your hunger and you are near jadavpur this place will be a better option than bawarchi .... situated in 8B this place is quite nice i loved the ambience and the behaviour of the men working there ... the food is quite good but not great... an ideal place for takeaway as well

I have been a customer of Banzara for over 20yrs, and still now their food account for over 50% of take-out/delivered food at my house. They may not be the best in all categories, but they offer a wide range, foods are tasty, quality and quantity are good, and the price is affordable. The only con is they have stopped the fish tandoor range.

One of the cheapest yet tasty chinese food available here. Been there 3-4 times, tried different chinese food. All the items were good or moderate. Biriyani is not. Very small restaurent. Have to wait a little if you visit on weekends. Overall value for money. Definitely you should try if you are a chinese lover.

Visited this place with 3 other friends. The place is situated inside a lane in 8b- the first turn before bawarchi. It's on the same lane as Ajooba I think. 
We ordered fried prawn starters which consisted of 8 pcs for ₹190! And 2 plates of mixed Hakka noodles @₹160 each. Prices are unbelievably low. And quality was so-so. You cant expect it to be like Mainland China or Hatari or even Cantonese but given the price it was really nice. The prawn starters was fine but the Hakka noodles could have been better. The prawns or chicken pcs in it wasn't up to the mark.
Ambience is quite well. The place was almost filled when we went there, in the evening. Yet service was quick and we didn't have to wait long. They also charged 18% gst.

The food here is awesome and never have I been disappointed. The only thing that has disappointed me is that whenever I have asked them to make a home delivery, the only reply I've got from them is that they cannot deliver. I wish this could change or else they should keep the "Home delivery" option unchecked from the Zomato app. Yet I would say that I'm happy with their behaviour and service.

The ambiance  is good for family dining
 However this time only two waiters were there even if there was a huge crowd right until the closing time. Hence service was slow.
Quality of food has become average. 
Quantity is still ok. 
Price is justifiable though 
Yet i think there has been definite degradation of standards.

The worst restaurant in south kolkata with the worst f&b service staff I've ever visited...

I found a cock roaches moving on my table while having my lunch. And when I called the waiter and told him, and he don't bother me and they don't even response .They just simply turned around and busy himself with chit-chat with another waiter . I leave my lunch half done, pay the bill and come out from the worst place. And i will suggest everyone to avoid this restaurant, which restaurant has this kind dirty and unhygienic guest service areas then what will be conditions of the kitchen where foods came from...

The food is good had mefun, chicken banzara spl(it could have been better, the taste didn't go with me), spl banzara rice(heard it was very good), and hot garlic chicken. For starters we had fried chicken and drumsticks. The food quality was good. But lets get to the main point the quantity. As one of my friend's exclaimed OMG!! this is the amount I would est for two days. The quantity is really huge and even I was struggling even after sharing. Kudos to the ambience and the friendly staff members.

Very reasonable price. Indian dishes r far better than the Chinese ones. Specifically biryani..... i loved it.... quantity is immense.....😋......I was very impressed with their service.....Don't follow this Zomato wala menu card...Coz they have introduced a new 1...... Increase of Rs10-20 in case of each item...... Go n check it out guys......

Visiting this place since last 7 or 8 years. Most pocket friendly place in Jadavpur. Their noodles and starters are best in that area. Food quality of other foods are also good. However, being a old restaurant of this area, now they must consider some variety in their menu, as for people like us, it becomes repetitive to order same food over and over. Else, 5star for them.

I have come to this restaurant often in my younger days. I have lots of fond memories. That's it. The food is sub-par at best. The TOILET is DIRTY. The whole atmosphere is dingy and the furnitures bring the whole ambience down. I had ordered paneer butter masala and chicken tikka masala. BOTH HAD THE SAME TEXTURE and more or less the same FLOURY and DULL CONSISTENCY on their gravy. The rice I ordered had a HUGE PIECE OF STONE IN IT, which makes feel extra assured that they are super hygienic back in the kitchen.

The food scene in Kolkata is highly competitive, yet they are sitting on their laurels. Disappointed, won't recommend to anyone.

This is a Dingy place within a narrow lane at Jadavpur. When I went there along with a friend I saw the waiters catering to the orders of other people not ours. The choice of dishes are very less. We ordered veg fried rice and shezwan chicken. I think shezwan chicken tastes spicy but there wasn't a bit of spice in what we had. The chicken was not cooked properly. After we completed eating the waiter didn't take a moment to present the bill before us. Given their service and the price of the food, I am highly disappointed.

This is one joint which is what i call value for money at its best.Located just beside the Lokenath paper house in jadavpur this place is always crowded during the evenings.I have been going to this place from my childhood days and still cannot get enough of it.They serve both north indian and chinese but I think its the chinese that their skills lie in. I will not mention what i ordered since I have tried almost everything on their menu. My top favourite --the chicken chilli garlic noodles with chilli chicken.I love spicy food and team Banzara does a great job in giving Kolkata what we term as Kolkata version of chinese. A bowl of noodles is enough for two ,so are the side dishes mostly coming with a decent 6 -8 pieces per plate. The decor is dimly lit and has a old chinese feel to it with a seating arrangement for 50.The servers are very warm and welcoming , my server even remembers my order by heart 😂.That is when a place becomes very close to your heart

Cant remember when i started to eat here, but it started with my parents and nowadays i go there with my friends also. Some times when my family members are too busy visit this place for pet puja, we order our food. Their main advantage is that they can offer you both Chinese and Indian food at the same place and at a reasonable price. From biriyani to fried rice or noodles, from chicken kasha to chilli chicken you will find everything here. And a must order food, the crispy chicken. Once a waiter told us to try this item when we couldn't decide what to eat as a starter. After that  day, every time we go there or order food from there crispy chicken is a must have dish in our order list. Food quality is still great. Its a bang for your bucks , place is large enough to eat with your family and even with your friends. Its a hidden treasure in jadavpur cz many people don't know about this place and those who know cant ignore banzara.

This restaurant is at jadavpur.  Not very convenient for first timers. Decor and ambiance is below average. However is restaurant is always crowded since it serves good food at a reasonable price. Tried out the chilly garlic fried rice with cantonese chicken for maincourse  and pepper chicken in my starters. I found both the chicken dishes very similar.  However quantity served is enough for two. One of my most favourite restaurant in the jadavpur area. A must visit for everyone budget friendly eater.

It was party time after the exam was finished. So we went Banzara for lunch, it was my first time to Banzara.
1st we ordered Hot & Sour Chicken Soup and a plate of Crispy Chicken as starter.
The soup was sooo delicious 😍 and the crispy chicken too. Crispy Chicken was tossed in a bit of gravy, i loved this concept. It was better than dry crispy Chicken!
Now in the main dish we ordered chicken fried rice and two bowl of Hong-kong chicken & Korean chicken! 
The gave 8 pieces of chicken in each item & all pieces were solid and big too,which was beyond my expectation!
The quantity, quality and the taste of food was impressive❤ 
Yesss i will be definitely going there again & again..

I have visited this place many times. The restaurant is always filled. Went for lunch with my friends. The portion size has still remained the same but some items have deteriorated. The mutton main course had too much salt and th pieces had a weird smell. The starter was filled with oil. But the biryani and naan were good.

Nice place. Its situated near 8b bus stand. I have tried chinese dishes. All the dishes were good except mixed fried rice cause prawns were not freshes. Otherwise its a good place to hangout with your chillar pocket.

I have visited more than 4 times here. Its located near 8b bus stand. Small restaurant but nice dim light decoration. Chinese foods better than moghlai. Must try chrispi chicken ....its yummy 😋. Reasonable price. Hong Kong chicken nd reshmi chicken butter masala are unique in taste.

I visited this place couple of times. This is one of the good and affordable restaurant in Jadavpur area. Although I didn't like their Chinese dishes ( because I'm very picky about Chinese restaurant), I very much enjoyed their indian and mughlai dishes. I would recommend that to their kababs and various mouth watering mughlai delicacies.

I was told that Banzara was one of the best restaurants in and around Jadavpur. Everyone I asked had a very high opinion of this outlet. Hence, decided to give this place a try.

The first impression was actually good. We had to wait for a few minutes outside the restaurant which generally means a packed house=highly popular=probably good food. Once inside, the ambience felt a little gloomy (Negligible lighting) and boisterous but that's tolerable. 

However, the food which could have been the saving grace was really not upto the mark which left me wondering why this restaurant was super popular. The crispy chicken was decent. A tad too sweet. The Murg Malai and Masala Kulcha were just below average. Very bland Kulcha and the chicken had a funny taste to it.

Quantity is above average and the prices are moderate. Quality wise, some more work is required.

I have visited this place 4-5 times. I still remember first time I went there was in 2012,last year of school life. We were searching for a good restaurant to hangout with friends with very little knowledge about Zomato searching and all that and suddenly one of my friend suggested this place. After that day, we almost went there once every year. This year  also, we went there and we were quite disappointed with the degraded quality of food. Few favourites of mine from this place is Hot garlic chicken, Szechwan Chicken, Banzara Spcl Rice. This time we order Hot garlic chicken and mixed fried rice and they didn't tasted like before. Hot garlic chicken has few big pieces of garlic and lots of peppercorns and their was no garlic flavour in the dish. Along with this service was also not up to the mark.

Came here yesterday for lunch and it was a dark dimly lit Restaurant. Smelly. The waiters are not at all courtesious and helpful. They dont know what's in the menu and what to say. Not properly trained. 

Coming to the Food we ordered Mediterranean Rice and Garlic Chicken. 

Quantity wise good but taste wise bland. 

Waste of money and I'm never coming back.

Banzara used to be one of my favorite chinese restaurants in Kolkata. But this time it was a complete let down. The quality of food has decreased alot. The ambiance was very mellow, very low lighting which was very annoying. The service was very slow, it took them more than 30 mins to serve our food.
 We had ordered, Prawn Pakora, the outer cover was crispy and the inside was overcooked and very tough; Chinese Chopsuey, the chopsuey served here used to be one of my favorites, but this time it was bland & flavorless; Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken in Garlic Sauce these 2 dishes were savior of our lunch, the quantity and quality both were nice. The chicken dish had good flavour in the sauce and had a good balance of sweet and sour that accompanied well with the fried rice.

Banzara is a small restaurant near jadavour ib bus stand . As i am local here i often go and try some dishes.. mainly my focus is on their mixed hakka noodles..  i think they serve one of the best hakka noodles in jadavpur and nearby. There is no complain about the quality and quantity. They give enough chickn prawn and egg in the noodles.. the crispy chicken is yummy but lil sweeter in taste.. i am just in love with the chillies in the vinegar..  overall a nice place for student and local though they have increase their rate

Every student from in and around Jadavpur who ever felt a longing for that inappropriately good fusion of flavours that is the infamous 'Bengali Chinese', should if they haven't already, visit Banzara. Voracious Biryani lovers are welcome too. Very well proportioned and easy on the pocket, this dimly lit room can host large groups of noisy people. In fact, it is ideal for them! All the regularly popular stuff like the kebabs, the manchurian and the hot garlic curry, the bharta etc. are worthy of recommendation. Vegetarian options, as is the case with most small places in Kolkata however, are not very many.

Moving a few steps down the lane beside Hindustan Sweets at Jadavpur 8B bus stand, and turning right at the first lane, you reach one of the favourite drop-in places of the nearby college goers - Banzara. From the handful of restaurants that thrive on the young people of the region, this place is one. Although the seating capacity is limited, and the place is somewhat dark, the location and easy-on-the-pockets attribute to the massive crowd it pulls. I have visited this outlet multiple times, and have ordered a fair share from their pretty extensive menu. The dishes aren't over the top, but the biryani is decent as also their different Chinese preparations. 

A few days back, I had visited the place with a couple of seniors, and we had ordered Thai soup. I hadn't tried it before, and no wonder why! Because the soup tasted anything but like Thai. It was a typical Chicken Broth with loads of vegetables, served hot with an unnecessary addition of pepper. No spicy taste or pungent feel, which are almost a typical characteristic of Thai soups. We had also ordered for Chicken drumsticks, which was a little chilly, and Finger Chicken in sea sauce, which surprisingly was pretty good. The tandoori section was closed, as we had visited it pretty early in the evening. So we mainly had the snacks and then hopped out for some desserts at Hindustan Sweets!

One of the best restaurant in Jadavpur. Tasty food. (Specially the Chinese) Value for money. I generally order soups Chicken Fried rice Manchurian Chicken - Sanghai Chicken (which taste sweet & they serve it with kaju & badam) . Fried rice & manchurian is much better than few other restaurants at this price level. (My favorite at this place)
But one of my friend had placed a bulk order for Fried Rice & Manchurian on her birthday the food that they delivered was just disaster. There was almost no Vegetables in Veg F.rice manchurian chicken was also not upto their mark. So please be careful if u wish to place a bulk order.
BUT for dine In & take away its very good.

Banzara is just behind 8B bus stand, Jadavpur. Spacious interior, a bit dark though. Ordered crispy chicken as starter, and was surprised to find it was sweet, though tasty. In main dish, we ordered two in one noodles, Banzara special rice, Picky chicken and red pepper chicken. Quantity was really good and the foods were also tasty, except the Red Pepper chicken which was completely bland, as the chef, as it seemed, forgot to add any salt to it. Over all impression, it was okayish, could have been better. Banzara is pocket friendly too.

Right place for students out there, if you have just little amount of pocket money it will suffice! The pricing of all the items are pocket friendly. Ambience is decent, service is good and when it comes to the food taste and quality, its ok nothing very special. I have tried banzara spl. meefoon,mixed noodles, red pepper chicken, Shanghai chicken and I would say its ok as per the price. The place is nice, but remains overcrowded during special occasions. 
There are many alternatives in the same area, but its ok if you wanna try the varieties of meefoons!

At a stone's throw distance from 8 B bus stand...Banzara is a small restaurant.
The ambience is nothing special.... rather shady..... improperly lit with tables that squeak and chairs that are bloody uncomfortable.
Coming to the food... we went for a myth Malay kabab which was just average. The egg coating was not fluffy enough and the pieces of chicken too chewy to suit my taste.
The tandoori roti could be well used as discus in the next Olympics..... so hard .... so charred.
The bharta was the only food item that made me stick to my table and have the food.
Had to take 4 glasses of water to wash down the horrible food that was served.
And then..... as if it wasn't enough.... the card swiping machine was not working properly... and hence had to do away with 5 notes of 100 bucks..... in this tough time of demonization.
Such a stupid place to have food!
Yuck!

*CHICKEN TIKKA KEBAB(1 Plate)- 6 pieces of chicken chunks were marinated with Indian spices but chicken was chewy i didn't like it too much or may be i was in a mood of Chinese .
*MIXED HAKKA NOODLES(1 Plate) - i just can't forget the taste it was too good with lots of prawns and chicken chunks and the quality of noodle was good.
*CHILLY GARLIC MIXED FRIED RICE(1 Plate)- it wasn't too "garlic-ky" the chillis were ear burning spicy and lots of prawns and chicken chunks were there and the quantity was too good.
*RED PEPPER CHICKEN (1 Plate)- it wasn't too spicy but the gravy was absolutely stunning with 8 pieces.
After having starters one plate of noodles and fried rice was enough of 5 of us :)

I have tried a lot of soups there and found them all very tasty, whether is Chicken Clear Soup or it is Sweet Corn Chicken Soup or even if it is simple Tomato soup.

As far as Mughlai Cuisine is concern, I'll not prefer Banzara probably. I have tried it once and the Biriyani was good but still I'll go with Chinese.

All the Noodles and Fried Rice items are very tasty and full of flavors. Common Chicken dishes like Chilli Chicken, Garlic Chicken are good and I tried Sanghai Chicken and found it nice too though it was little hot (:P do not know how does Sanghai Chicken tastes actually).

This restaurant was in my bookmark list from a couple of weeks and today finally got a chance to dine in there. This place could be simply found by using google maps and the landmark for this restaurant is Jadavpur 8B bus stand. As we entered the dining space the first impression was like it's good. The dimlight ambiance was just perfect for hanging out with friends. Today we preferred to taste their chinese sections first. So ordered mixed fried rice along with chilly garlic chicken. The food arrived within 15 minutes. After tasting the first bite of the chicken it seemed like super tasty. The gravy was neither too much spicy nor too much sweet. They served 8 big pieces of chicken with a tasty finger licking gravy. The chicken pieces were soft , tender as well as juicy. The mixed fried rice tasted equally good having ample amount of chickens and prawns. The quantity served was highly appreciable. It was more than enough for two of us. It was a perfect lunch with delicious dishes served before us. Very impressed by their service. Truly a hidden gem of Jadavpur area. The prices are really reasonable and all the prices in their menu are inclusive of taxes. So it can be called a paisa wasool lazabab khana. ☺ 😋

I Had visited the place many time. The quality of food is OK. The pricing is very reasonable also, but last when i visited with my friend they served the food OK but there was small cockroach running on the table where we were dinning. we asked the waiter about this kind of service. They simply did nothing, not even the person in charge there. we are  forced to leave the restaurant without completing our dinner. They told us to pay the money and instead they provided packed new food. If the dinning place is so unhygienic how hygienic is the process of making the food in the kitchen out there?

A must have place in Jadavpur. Located at an awkward place with not much fancy decor but still boasts such number of customers that can put new sophisticated restaurants to shame. The food is awesome. Love the prawn and chicken dishes.

I would say this is one of the hidden gem in the Jadavpur area near the 8B Bus Stand mainly student hangout. Visited this eatery on the occasion of bday celebration of one of my cousin on weekend. I workd recommend their best dish murg  musallam which will just melt in your mouth. Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

*Sasthi, Pujas 2017* 
Brilliant Service, brilliant food. 
Garlic Chicken was stupendous and so was chilli chicken! 
The Mixed rice was still the best! 

*11th October 2016*
It was an afternoon of Dashami when we, a group of 7 visited Calcutta Bistro which was overcrowded. Called up this restaurant(was in our list for lunch too) and they said there's no crowd. We reached and we were behind just 1 group and had to wait hardly 15mins. The rush was also less.
SERVICE:(6/10)
Below Average. They didn't collect the starter plates, we gathered, they carried away. On bringing the fresh plates for the mains, we had to place the plates in the respective position.

Orders: (rating in the reviews below, individual pricing not mentioned since it was Puja menu)
1x Chicken Drum Stick
2x Chicken Fried Rice
2x Mixed Fried Rice
1x Sanghai Chicken
1x Chicken Manchurian

Sharing the cost equally, it came down to Rs 175 a head for 7 ppl.

Chicken Drum Stick(7/10): This was a decent serve. 8 pieces, decently sized and tasted quite good but in a piece or two, it had a stale type smell.

Chicken Fried Rice(9/10): This was awesome. Even though quality degrades in Pujas, it was still brilliant in quantity and taste. Even though they did increase the price just for pujas, the food did make up for it.

Mixed Fried Rice(9.5/10): -0.5 for the smelly prawns. The only non-smelly prawns I've had was Mainland China. The rest, the quantity was huge, the taste was wondrous and better than the chicken version.

Sanghai Chicken(10/10): The best and the most costly side dish in the Puja menu. This wasn't much different than sweet and sour chicken but still, this was magnificent. All the 8 pieces were big and uniformly sized.

Manchurian Chicken(6.5/10): There were 8 big and uniform sized pieces. The quantity of gravy was also good but... the taste was completely bland. It tasted pretty much like the mixed veg knour soup with excess water :P.

DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT TASTES, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES. DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR A BETTER CONCLUSION. KEEP EATING

Food is very good, it comes with plenty of quantity. Went there on a busy nabami night for dinner and have wait for around one hour in the rain for our turn, but wait was absolutely worth, as the foods quality and quantity was excellent. It s a very nice place for dinning, will go back there for sure when i will feel hungry and have less money in my pocket. Best place for everyone...... 
Service was also very prompt and fast though the place was over crowded. Good work Banzara team, keep up the good work... 
Will visit you soon and will also give feedback to my friends.

This is one of the well known restaurant in jadavpur area.. It's another budget friendly family restaurant ..I visted this place 1yr ago .. Ordered basic Chinese dishes n they were pretty good.Bt in my recent visit I was very disappointed by the food that was being served.. The veg fried rice was half cooked so we were trying to call the waiter to help us out Bt none of them paid attention. At last one of them came n he took the bowl n later served better... Food is so so kind of BT the service is totaly not up to the mark.Hope they will improve this issue..

This is our college Joint........ me being a JU Grad. We visit this restaurant right from 2003 and have visited it countless number of times....... tasted both Indian and Chinese dishes....... Prices are very very easy on the pocket, quantities provided in the dishes are ample and the food is not at all oily. Taste of the food is delectable..... it is well hidden from the main road and hence many outsiders don't know about it. The staff is very polite and courteous...... all in all it provides value for your money.

One might happen to find this place hidden amongst the busy bylanes of Jadavpur. But the moment one steps in, its a different picture altogether! Well lit with chandeliers and a moderate homely feel, one can easily enjoy a quick meal without any hustle bustle, thanks to their quick service! 

Today I was returning from my dad's office when my ever hungry palette began grumbling again! So needless to say I was searching for a decent place to eat when to my surprise, I suddenly came across this eatery! So then decided to give it a try! 

For appetizers I ordered Chicken (Boneless) Pakodas which was yum! Crispy and at the same time succulent with tender chicken. The soup which I took later was equally appetizing too! One must try their chicken sweet corn soup. It's splendid! All's seemed well till now! 

Now comes the main course. I took Mixed Schzwan Fried Rice and for side dish ordered Thai Chicken (as recommend by the waiter). Which later turned out to be not so well after all! :( Anyway the rice was good. Both their quality and quantity deserves mention (except the Thai Chicken). 

Here I must mention this was the first time I dined alone in a restaurant. But the waiters were really cordial and helpful. Overall a decent experience! Not a highly recommended place but yes! If one is searching for any decent place in this area,then it's definitely worth a shot!

A fooding joint near jadavpur 8b bus stand. Moderate place tucked in a small lane. Quantity provided is hefty. Quality not so much. I personally found chinese dishes very very oily. So did not have the guts to order indian dishes. Ordered chicken hakka noodles, chilli chicken dey, hot and sour soup and chicken drumstick.Good place for a low budget dine. Would recomend for couples!

Although this restaurant has been in the Jadavpur area for many years now, catering to several customers every day, I am quite disappointed with the way I was duped intentionally or accidentally. I had opted for takeaway one day. I ordered the mix mafoon and chicken noodles, and I paid accordingly. But when I reached home, I opened the containers and found egg mafoon and egg noodles. Something like this is not expected from a restaurant of Banzara's calibre. Although the taste was good, I would have liked to had eaten what I had paid for. Disappointed really.

Starter: Chicken hot & sour soup, Chicken Manchow soup, Pepper Chicken for starter...soups were eatable...but Pepper Chicken?...what was it?...they served Chicken Pakora 😦😦😦...
Main course: Banzara special rice, Chilly Babycorn rice, Banzara special Chicken, Honkong Fish...Banzara special is nothing special...it only had lots & lots of mushrooms & babycorns...so don't feel anything special...Chilly Babycorn rice has loads of chilly & only 2 - 3 slices of babycorn were discovered by my dear friend madhu

Decor is average but the dim lights are really soothing.
The staff behavior is extremely good.
Now they serve both north Indian and Chinese the Chinese is much better than the Indian dishes.
Chicken Drumsticks are average.
The mixed Noodles are really good,with ample proportions  of chicken,prawn,egg etc.
The dry chili chicken is awesome, the gravy counterpart is also good.
Sweet and sour chicken was good.but i personally didn't liked the cucumbers in the gravy.
My experience with chicken tandoori was really bad. I would always opt for Chinese in future.

#This place is damn pocket friendly.Awesome for students.

Ordered Two Gosht Biriyani and one Murgh Musallam from them, delivered was one Biriyani and the Murg as they somehow mistakenly forgot to sent the second Parcel of Biriyani. First order was delivered after 45 minutes at 1 km distance and the forgotten Biriyani arrived after half an hour after the former. Now coming to the food and it's taste, at 190, they were giving a huge amount of Rice, two pieces of mutton with fair amount of meat and fat which also were cooked right, one each of an aloo and an egg. Sounds promising, right? Wrong. First of all, the rice doesn't has the aroma which is the trademark of Biriyani, secondly, despite the quantity is huge, we were pretty concerned about the quality of the rice just after having a few spoons! It surely did not taste like it typically does. Then we found that the aloo may not had been a Kashmiri either! It may sound a bit picky, but then we haven't ordered from a roadside stall either, and at a cost of 795 for two, isn't it justified enough to expect some basics when it comes to quality? The Murg Musallam was good at 415 and found to meet our expectations quite easily, in a devouring manner. We are typical Bengali people and been a connoisseur of the concerned dishes. I would not going to order any kind of Biriyani from them. Last but not the least, the delivery man when came again with the second Biriyani parcel used abusive languages loudly like "Suorer Bachcha" to address the fault of their own people has forgot to check and pack the complete order at once, which was also quite disgusting at that time. Bottom-line: Banzara you should teach some manner to your delivery people and improve the quality of the Biriyani Chawal and aloo!

Low in budget and need good food? Banzara is the right place to go.

This isn't a fancy restaurant with flamboyant decor or innovative foods. But it serves you tasty foods at affordable prices, and that's the USP of this place.

In numerous occasions I've tasted their Chinese and Indian offerings, and every time I've been really happy. The Indian dishes are usually better than the Chinese ones. I love their Chicken dishes; Chicken Butter Masala, Tikka Masala, Murg Makhani are to die for. The Chicken Biriyani is good too.

Banzara is my hungry soul's saviour, and I find it one of the best in Jadavpur.

This restaurant is located near 8B in Jadavpur. It's a complete family restaurant,with dim lighting inside and average decor. I had tried the manchow soup and my friend tried the mushroom soup . They both were well prepared and we were quite full after having it. The quantity is sufficient. The naan,chicken 65,and egg hakka chowmein were also good. Value for money place. You will be very much satisfied by both the quality and quantity.

A great, pocket-friendly place. Loved the food, which come in generous portions, given the amount they charge you. Banzara might be a bit difficult to locate if it's the first time you're heading there, but what works best is getting off at the Jadavpur 8B bus stand and just asking around for directions.
From the outside this place may not seem very impressive, but don't be deceived. Enter and you will be pleasantly surprised by the ambience - dim lights, nicely decorated, and air-conditioned.
However, the seating area is almost always full (which speaks of how popular this place is amongst those who know of this treasure trove), so you may need to wait for your table. On our first visit there, we were told that we would have to wait for 25 to 30 minutes. It seemed disappointing at first, because it was a little past 2:30pm and we were hungry. But luckily a table became available in under 10 minutes and we were ushered in, much to our delight.
We were served soon after we placed the orders - so you don't have to wait for a dreadfully long time for your food, at least during peak hours.

I don't see how our experience at Banzara doesn't deserve 5 stars. We got more than we expected, enjoyed this pleasant ambience, and gorged on absolutely delicious Chinese food, without worrying much about the pocket pinch. And when we finally got our bill, the amount payable turned out to be way less than our set budget, plus, they didn't levy any separate taxes.

 Had a great time here, and recommend this place to anyone with a low budget and a knack to explore the hidden treasures in the alleys of Jadavpur.

Among the hustling and bustling of the busy roads , this place stands out in a lane with a very small gate. But when we entered the place it was decorated beautifully in a dim light ambience.
Good food and at inexpensive prices. bang on! this is it. 
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup, shredded chicken as starters. Shredded chicken was a mix of sweet n soury n spicy taste. all together very nice.
Then we had a plate of meinfoon which had enormous amount of chicken and in huge quantity. If you are in a group of 4 and are too hungry then order two plates.We also ordered a plate of sanghai chicken which was garnished with cashew nuts. all the items were delicious in taste.
Hope to taste some more dishes there . 
I wish they served some soft drinks like sweet lime soda n all.

Visited here today, with a small budget this restaurant is small in shape and ambience is average, service is not good, it is a cheap restaurant crowd is always there, so you've to keep patience. We ordered chicken sweet corn soup, which was pretty good and above expectation. Then we ordered mixed fried rice and Hong Kong chicken. Fried rice was good, hong Kong chicken was really very good. You should definitely try it. The pieces were good compared to the price, but the quality of the fried rice should be better compared to the price. Overall a good decision to enter into this restaurant, good quality, quantity, and price is cost effective.

It's located exactly behind the 8B bus stand.You walk past the bus stand take the immediate left lane and walk into the left lane beside the Hindustan sweets shop. And u reach banzara afta walking for hardly 30secs.as far as the décor is concerned-there is practically no decor at all juz AC and extremely dim yellow lighting. One can also notice the cob webs at the sides of the ceiling. Food is decent... We ordered chicken drumsticks (6 pieces) ,crispy chilly baby corn and pepsi. the chicken drumsticks was good-nothing exceptional but as i already mentioned decent! The baby corn wasnt that great-most other restaurants serve better crispy chilly baby corn.It's extremely cheap especially if you are with a big group because the quantity served is huge.I had been there with a friend of mine but we couldn't finish the baby corn platter and ultimately had to waste it.Overall my take on it would be that it isn't an ideal place to go for dates but for a casual hangout or for treating a big group of people and yet spending as little money as possible-this place is where you should go!

What should you be ordering? Definitely the Chinese.

Do you have those dreams where you are endlessly munching on spicy, saucy Chinese platters and want to go on, without any one around to stop you? If yes, then you are my type of a person and if not, then I am sorry I put this image in your mind. Banzara is the ideal place to hog at if you are the former type of person. They most specifically serve "Indo-Chinese" and Indian cuisines. 

My preference has always been biased with the Chinese dishes. They are nice and spicy and will leave you smacking your lips for the rest of the journey home. You must order the chicken gravy noodles and the drums of heaven here. They are a killer combo. Almost all the Chinese dishes served here are loaded with chilli flakes, so if you do not mind the spice and picking chilli flakes from between your teeth afterward, you won't be disappointed. 

The place is extremely pocket friendly and is perfect for those end of the month food cravings, with little money in pocket to support them.

Visited the place for uncountable number of times.Chinese foods are much more better than Indian. They served kabab in a unique style with a candle in a tomato which is beautiful. One bowl fried rice or noodles is enough for two,  every side dish, drumstick and crispy chilly babycorn are simply awesome in taste... Nice place to hangout with family and friends.

Banzara is placed just near the Hindustan Sweets at Jadavpur. A small cozy place serving food just upto the mark. The best place about this restaurant is that the price is very reasonable. I have visited quite a few times here and I love the #TandooriChicken they prepare. It's absolutely mouth melting specially with the green chutni. Apart from that #TandooriRoti #MasalaKulcha #PunjabiChicken and #ChickenBharta was equally nice. 

In a nutshell, Banzara is filled with good food and good people.

Just 7 min walking distance from my house,  and am a regular customer of this restaurant from last 6 years,  so all the staff,  from waiter to owner,  know me very well,  let's come to the food,  ahhhhhhhhhh,  they have some signature dishes like 

Fish gold coin 
Chili chiken dry,  my most favorite dish 
Kashmiri polaw 
Mutton rezala 
And best among the best chiken handi masala,  
Service is excellent,  all staff are very helpful and jolly,  

But they had a negative point also,  if you go for takeway I mean parcel,  they will charge 14.5% vat and service charge. But many of other resturant not do the same thing,  but now it's change they include this tax on food,  

Overall good restaurant

This used to be one of my favourite places to have chinese when i was in school. Located inside the lane beside Hindusthan Sweets, the location is a bit tricky. The seating area is quite cramped to be honest with the tables being extremely close to each other. Nothing much to talk about the decor as it is just an AC operated simple seating area. The place remains really dark which is quite intentional from the management's end to give it a calm ambiance. 

I would definitely recommend their very detailed Chinese Cuisine. Over the years i have tried a lot of their items and all of them have satisfied me in terms of taste and quality. I would though recommend people to have their Sczhwan Fried Rice and the normal one also ahead of the noodles. One bright feature of this eatery is their quantity. The portions are very generous and can be shared by multiple persons depending on the item and apetite. The staff there is polite and would listen to your demands with a smiling face.

Banzara is located near jadavpur 8B. Not very hard to find if you are following Google maps. The place is nice but small. Ambience is not very much appealing. They have both moghlai and Chinese dishes. But I tried only the Chinese. Coming to food the quality is good but not hi-fi, food quantity is huge. One plate is enough to satisfy two hungry souls and also pocket friendly. So in my opinion if you want some good food in low budget you should definitely try this place.

Broke? No big deal. This place is the poor man's paradise. I remember coming here back when I had pocket money in amounts that could rival the number of centimetres on kareena kapoor's waist at the time, and still being able to afford a hearty meal. Recommendations? Order whatever you want, in as much quantities as you deem humanly possible for you to consume.

10 mins from my home. It is an old favorite of mine. Went there over 10 times. 
It still surprises me how they can hold on to the same taste of their dishes and never fail to satisfy me neither with quantity nor with quality. A place with a nice ambiance and a good taste of food. When having a tight pocket but yet need to have some delicious food this is the right place in Jadavpur .

I visited this restaurant with my friends last November. We had gone there for lunch.We ordered Singapore noodles and Hong Kong noodles.The flavour was good,as usual,though we couldn't identify which plate served which item. One of them had pieces of pineapples in them.Surprisingly, it tasted quite good.The waiters were very courteous... And the tax was included in the price which was an added bonus. On another occasion, we had ordered Schezwan Noodles and Manchurian Chicken and they are lip-smacking as well. The portions were quite handsome.

That apart the food is really good..

Good food with great quantity and pricing...

The place is darkly lit but tht doesnot become much.. of a hindrance..

I have tried a lot of dishes from here and was not dejected by any..

This joint is haunted by the young crowd mainly ..and is good for catching up with friends and having those nice chitchats..

Definitely worth a visit..

I have ordered something and sitting for a LONG TIME where some people were CAME AFTER ME but they have got their orders. When I trying to call any staff they just didn't RESPONSE it. Several times many staff's came and wanted their dish plate to took it where it was STILL NOT EMPTY. BAD EXPERINECE, BAD PLACE,never refer anyone to anyone VISIT THIS PLACE.

First of all, aside from the fact that it is popular around the place and people could direct us, Banzara is pretty hard to find! It is situated in a lane within another lane and we were a couple of confused souls searching for it! 

Anyway after we found it, with a sigh of relief, we entered. We expected the place to be packed (we went on a holiday, sort of), but to our surprise, it wasn't. I was empty, in fact. The place is pretty dark, the dim lighting wasn't helping the pictures. The seating arrangements are a bit cramped up, but it didn't bother us much since the restaurant was pretty much empty. 

We ordered a plate of Mixed Noodles and Szechwan Prawn. The quantity was enough for two people. The food tasted pretty good, we were impressed. Especially, the prawns were quite big, for the price. The noodles had oodles of shrimps, too (forgive the wordplay)! 

The pocket pinch was about Rs. 450 for two. Pretty reasonable, obviously. 

Overall, we were satisfied with the quality of the food in this price range. We'll go back for more. :)

Ohh I just forgot to drop a review!!!  Used to visit this place a lot about 2 years ago, suddenly a plan was fixed and thought of referring this place.. I was extremely disappointed for referring this place, because this place has changed a lot within a couple of years. I don't actually remember what we ordered but it was bout 2 rice dishes 2 sides and 2 starters. The chicken in the side dishes were not cooked at all the gravy was horrible. The shrimps in the rice were over cooked and burnt. We had to leave the place with empty stomach, and the plan was also ruined as well. If you are planning to visit this place then go alone, don't take anyone with you, you can get a punch right on your face from the people you'll take there along with you.

As a student of Jadavpur University, I should have visited this place while I was still studying there. I never did. But better late than never, right? My friend and I had gone to South City Mall to catch a movie and later we wanted a full lunch that wouldn't cost us a fortune. The Food Court was way too crowded as usual so she suggested I try Banzara. She had often been there but it was my first time and it served our purpose bang on! We wanted something simple and ordered their Chili Baby Corn Fried Rice and Reshmi Butter Masala. (Yeah I know, very weird combo!) The quality was fine (the rice was exceptionally good, the baby corn bits especially, giving it a very unique taste)  but I was astounded by the quantity! They served us so much Fried Rice that we couldn't finish even though both of us were super hungry. A small and normal restaurant, it's perfect for college students because this place is very pocket friendly!

You can make it one by two for those items which were pretty cool... Wish to go again..... Another thing I need to mention... Place were clean and service were really quick...

Whether my choice of order was not perfect or their heart was not into cooking that particular day I can't say but my experience here was pretty bad. the ambience was not so welcoming and I had to wait for a long time to place the order. The food that arrived did not appeal to my taste buds. The chicken tikka was half cooked. We had both Chinese and north Indian for the main course but the dishes were nothing extraordinary. It is pocket friendly though not gastronomically satisfying.

Very affordable and old school food. They are good at both Chinese and Indian. Its best to ask them for suggestions since all the items on the menu are not really good. The regular stuff like Hakka noodles and chilli chicken etc are pretty good. The USP of this place would be the low prices in comparison to the quantity of food and the fact that they don't charge any extra taxes. It used to be a popular hangout for me and my friend during my days at Jadavpur University and the last time I visited I still see a lot of students coming here when they are in the mood to spend a little extra.

Food quality and quantity both are very good and very reasonably priced. Only con would be that most of the Chinese dishes taste more or less same. :3

Starters are moderate. For the main course, we ordered three kinds of chicken side dishes : hong kong,thai and mongolian chicken. The thai one was good,the other two tasted the same. Nevertheless good.
Mughlai is okayish. The malai chicken which I heard was good,failed to impress me though.

Been here a lot of times.. It was our favourite joint to have great food without a big crack in the pocket.. Coming to the point now, the question why i am giving it 1/5..  I understand that its a famous place for the locals and there may be a queue for getting a table.. I also understand that it may take a while to get the table..  we were four, waiting outside the restaurant..  After waiting for about 20-25 mins we decided to ask how long will take to get our table.. Well,  asked twice, and the person maintaining the queue discipline simply looked at me , listened to me and said nothing, as if i was just looking at him and wasn't saying anything . He didn't bother to reply..  He came in front and called other visitors without saying a single word in response to my query.. I mean, come on!!! We are not beggars and you are not giving away foods for free..  i felt insulted..  I think any body will feel this if he/she asks something and the person simply doesn't answer..

situated in jadavpur, this restaurant is really difficult to locate if you are not familiar with that area. I've visited this restaurant many times in the last few months. the place is quite ordinary and doesn't really have a huge seating capacity. ambiance is pretty much just average, with dim lighting. Chinese food here isn't that good, if you are a chinese lover. biryani here is really tasty though. have tried quite a few dishes here. the good ones are, picky chicken, and chilli babycorn. the only bad thing about this place is their extremely slow service. bt the time they serve the food, half your hunger will simply disappear for sure. -_- must try their Hyderabadi biryani! :)

The ambience is so so. Traditional Chinese food available here. Though muglai is also available I tasted the lemon chicken and pineapple noodles and cheez balls as starter.  Taste was good. Zomato people going there can have a dinner here.

Went there this Tuesday. A warm, cozy place. Perfect for a date. The price of food is reasonable and perfect for college students. The place is a bit small but the quality of food was really good. We tried the chicken, mushroom soup... taste was good. For main course we had the Kashmiri pulao and chicken lababdar...the pulse was really tasty and its sweetness was well complemented by the spicy gravy of the chicken. All in all a nice experience

situated in jadavpur, this restaurant is really difficult to locate if you are not familiar with that area. I've visited this restaurant many times in the last few months. the place is quite ordinary and doesn't really have a huge seating capacity. ambiance is pretty much just average, with dim lighting. Chinese food here isn't that good, if you are a chinese lover. biryani here is really tasty though. have tried quite a few dishes here. the good ones are, picky chicken, and chilli babycorn. the only bad thing about this place is their extremely slow service. bt the time they serve the food, half your hunger will simply disappear for sure. -_- must try their Hyderabadi biryani! :)

Being a student of Jadavpur University, this restaurant is a very common place of my frequent dinners. The food especially the biriyani is top notch. Among other high points the cost is reasonable, and the ambience is really nice. But the major drawback is lack of space, especially the entrance. The behaviour of the staffs are also not friendly which is one of the crunch factors leading to the selection of a restaurant.

One of the hidden gems located just beside jadavpur bus terminus. Crispy chicken and chicken bharta are the two dishes that stand out. The only thing that destroys its ambience is that the people are generally way too loud among themselves.

Between Banzara and Bawarchi, we selected Banzara. We had been already to Bawarchi once and we do not appreciate food was highly there. 
Quality food at properly priced rates and a good ambience is what Banzara provides. We had ordered Chinese food which was pretty good enough for the prices. Most importantly the chicken was extremely well cooked. And the corn flour coating on them was thin, a thing desired often but not available mostly. And I must praise them for the amount of food served per plate. 
However, the service seemed a bit on the low side. 
 
Still, a thumb's up for you lot of Banzara management!

The cheapest restro in jadavpur serving quality food. Went there last month for dinner. It's very easy to locate and once you enter the dimly lit ambiance creates a mystique atmosphere with lamp shades hanging from the ceiling. We were terribly hungry and immediately ordered crispy chilli baby corn which sadly took 25 mins to arrive. But once it arrived we almost gobbled it up. Quantity wise very satisfactory and taste wise lip smacking. We had ordered the main courses at the time of ordering the starter. But after finishing our starter we had to wait another 10 mins for the main course which was very irritating. When you r hungry and have been already served with starter its an agony to be kept waiting after giving your tummy only two to 3 minutes of relief. Finally our main course came which consisted of one egg hakka noodles,one chicken fried rice and one red pepper chicken. Noodles was nice,fried rice was okay okay types and red pepper chicken was bad.yes bad.chicken pieces were juicy tasty and cooked but the gravy was tasteless. Lots of capsicum and onions and lack of chilli/chilli powder took the taste away. However the bill came to b as low as 625 Inc taxes. Would have given a 3.5 but .5 deducted for very very slow service.
PS one thing I would like to clarify is that the main course quantities are not huge as mentioned in many reviews. It's sufficient for 2 ppl if you eat less. I personally eat moderate amounts and felt it would be a bit less for two ppl to share one plate.

If you are looking for a dalda packed biryani made with poor quality chicken then Banzara is the place. Located in Jadavpur in a bylane, the place is existing for several years. The waiters are smelly and the decor is ordinary. There is a lack of professionalism all around which is evident from the number of spelling mistakes in the menu card.

A place which is good for mainly college goers and locals(as it is really pocket friendly)..
Food is average and service is okay,ambience is not that great,just like a decent eatery..
don't dare to order prawn cos they do no de-shell the prawns(and ofcourse they do not remove the intestinal tract too)...u may start enjoying ur prawn dish and then find out they haven't evn cared to remove the shells
Yes,the quantity ws really huge and the food tasted good(which is the only thing u may like),but if u r in a hurry,don't step inside,cs the food is served almst 30mins after you've placed the order..if u consider budget n quantity,this is a nice place

I went here with my friends for a late but light lunch. The interiors were well decorated but had extremely dim lightning (hence pardon the ugly photos I have uploaded). It looked cozy but it was too chilly thanks to the air condition being set at minimum temperature. We ordered Murg Biriyani, Gosht Biriyani and Hyderabadi Chicken Biriyani (because we were almost broke). We waited for around 40 minutes to be served and finally when the food came in, the Biriyani in general tasted good and the meat pieces were quite large. However, the mutton was unevenly cooked: it was soft at places and tough at others. The Chicken was pretty dry and fibrous. The Hyderabadi Biriyani was spicy and filled with an unnecessarily huge amount of chopped chilies. It was an average experience but not hard on the pocket.

But had to wait for quite some time in a queue outside the restaurant which is tiring but reminded me of my earlier visits with my friends.

We ordered Mixed fried rice, Mongolian Chicken & American Chopsuey.
Enjoyed the meal to the fullest...might visit again.

One of my favorite pocket friendly place to have lunch or dinner.  The ambience is very nice and dark.  food quality and service is also very nice.  The quantity they provide is huge! Generally one main course can be divided amongst 3 persons. I've tried both Indian and Chinese food from here.  I would definitely recommend chicken hot garlic noodles, sweet and sour fish and picky chicken.  one of the best small and pocket friendly restaurants in jadavpur

A sudden hang out with my friend brought us here. It was basically his birthday treat. It is located just behind 8b bus stand in a by lane and it's kind of hidden. We reached there at 2.25 pm and found it quite crowded. 
  A very small,congested joint with 6-7 tables with no such decoration except colorful small chandelier and large mirrors on side walls. The place is dimly lighted though air conditioned. 
  For starter, we ordered chicken drum stick. The waiter told us that it would be served within 5-6 minutes but they took almost 15 minutes to serve it. But the taste was pathetic.
  Next we ordered combination fried rice, hot garlic prawn and Hong Kong chicken. The rice was good in taste and chicken was good too. But prawn again disappointed me.
  Now the dessert disappointed and shocked me a lot. We ordered one chocolate and one kesar pista. And when it was served it was basically small cup of kwality ice cream in those flavours and those were charged more than the labelled price from us. 
 Only one positive thing is that the quantity is huge. Service was average. Price is pocket friendly.

Our trip to Banzara was out of a sudden decision. This is frequented mostly by people from JU. Two of my friends are only one of "that kind" who guided us into the narrow lane which houses this place. 
We had ordered chicken chilly garlic noodles, shanghai chicken, gosht biriyani and chicken bharta. The food was nothing out-of-the-world but tasty nevertheless. The quantity was more than enough for the four of us. There seemed to be very less waiters. Although it isn't much of an issue for us. Overall, it is a good-place which is student-friendly for its cheap rates. Surely a place I would like to frequent.

This place have always been very special to me. After being to Banzara for almost more than 200 times for the last 10 years, I can say that I have seen all phases of this restaurant.. from excellent to deteriorating to decent to again back to good.. :)

The slight dim,chilled ambiance has been always there at Banzara.. That what keeps pulling you there.. Food is good at a decent price.. it attracts all kinds of crowd, starting from family crowd, students, couples, school buddies...each and every kind.. Banzara is one of those kind of restaurants that offers you the two most popular cuisines in Calcutta --
Calcutta Chinese Calcutta Mughlai

What I always order over here is very common and not very fancy.. sweet corn chicken soup, chicken drumstick, Reshmi kebab etc. In main course, Manchurian Fried Rice has an appetizing smell and taste. Garlic chicken is prepared well over here.. You can also try out Biryani, which is pretty decent... But above all what makes you feel happy at your pocket, is the quantity they serve for that price.. sometimes a full course meal proves to be somewhat excess for two people...

Over all this place, makes both you happy at both your stomach and pocket... :)

A senior friend of mine wanted to give his birthday treat in jadavpur area & so i suggested banzara since i had never tried this place. So it was a warm & sultry monday evening when he hit this place. The place was partially filled up & was dimly lighted with a convenient layout. So after settling ourselves down we ordered the following items:-

1. Lung fong soup= This was taken by my friend although i didn't taste but the others said it was really good. Should be tried among the soup section.

2. Fish gold coin= Finely cut out 8 bhetki pieces wok tossed with capsicums & onions which was presented with cucumber pieces. This is almost like a pan fried dish but more crispy in nature & was simply outstanding. Must Try

3. Chicken chilli garlic friedrice= Wholesome quantity of fried rice was finely made with adequate pieces of chopped chicken,veggies,chillies & garlic which gave a great spicy joy. The quantity is more than enough for 2 people.

3. Red chilli chicken= This is a shredded & more spicier version of chilli chicken. This was an ok dish for me since i felt the gravy to be a bit dense.

4. Chicken Biriyani= Again very wholesome quantity of biriyani served with 2(or 1.5;cant remember properly) pieces of chicken. Nothing extra ordinary to say about the biriyani but could be tried.

5. Chicken reshmi butter masala= I didn't like it much to be honest but the chicken was tender & nicely cooked. The gravy felt very flat to me.

6. Full chicken tandoori= Excellently marinated with spices & cooked to perfection. The presentation of the dish was unique as well with a "pradeep" like tomato in the middle of the plate which really caught my eyes.

The overall bill came to around ~1400 INR which is very moderate for 4 people. The staff are very cordial & responsive. The food lives up to its hype as well considering pocket friendly options in jadavpur locality. Cheers!!!

Pathetic food condition compared to what they used to serve year ago.  Most Chinese dishes are extremely poor.  First had a moghlai chicken dish that have coating on chicken pieces.  All the chicken and paneer(or tofu, they know only) items were extremely hard.  Service too slow.  Only positive are the staffs.

5. Chicken reshmi butter masala= I didn't like it much to be honest but the chicken was tender & nicely cooked. The gravy felt very flat to me.

6. Full chicken tandoori= Excellently marinated with spices & cooked to perfection. The presentation of the dish was unique as well with a "pradeep" like tomato in the middle of the plate which really caught my eyes.

The overall bill came to around ~1400 INR which is very moderate for 4 people. The staff are very cordial & responsive. The food lives up to its hype as well considering pocket friendly options in jadavpur locality. Cheers!!!

Pathetic food condition compared to what they used to serve year ago.  Most Chinese dishes are extremely poor.  First had a moghlai chicken dish that have coating on chicken pieces.  All the chicken and paneer(or tofu, they know only) items were extremely hard.  Service too slow.  Only positive are the staffs.

If you tried all the good restaurants in jadavpur area then you can try this restaurant. I went their with my family, we were 9 in total. Wr ordered schezwan noodle, chicken & mushroom gravy, chicken manchurian, garlic fish, prwan noodle soup, hyderabadi biriyani, one mutton gravy item. Out of them only the noodle was above average and others are below average. In prwan soup it was hard to find prwan, chicken was not tasty in the gravy item, fish was over friied in the garlic fish etc.... you can try this restaurant if you want give a treat to sooooo many people. Haha... my first and last visit. Thank you.

If you want to go out with your family and have dinner at affordable prices and you have a big appetite then this is surely the place for you. Having been here more than a few times, I can tell from my own experience that food quality varies from bad to more than average. Other than this the dim lighting won't help to light up your dinner/lunch.

A hidden gem it is in the heart of Kolkata. It's located in the opposite lane of Jadavpur University. Not quite a trouble to locate it. 

The ambiance is at par, it doesn't have anything to special to complement on. 

The waiters are very good and polite and the quality of service received was pretty commendable. 

Had settled for crispy chicken, Hunan noodles and Cantonese chicken. The crispy chicken was very appetizing, the Hunan noodles did okay but the Cantonese chicken was mouth watering. I'd have had another plate if I had the appetite. The noodles come in a good quantity and is just enough for two.

It's a very pocket friendly restaurant as all the rates were kept very low and being a student I don't mind that. So you get quality and quantity and that too at such a low reasonable price. 

So this is the place you should head for as it serves very delightful food and it doesn't hurt the pocket much.

Clicked the pics very late in the course of the meal so that's the part I missed.

The keema rice is filled with mutton, prawn chicken and egg and the quantity of rice is enough for 2 person.. So I would suggest everyone to try that dish once..

If you want to revisit your school or early college days when anything not homecooked tasted great and one had to plan for days to go for a meal with friends and post-meal there would be a meticuluous calculation for each person's share, you can visit banzara. It kind of reminds you of all such places that we used to go to eight-ten years ago. It is a typical neighbourhood place, albeit a neighbourhood that boasts of a busy bazaar, a bus depot, a university, innumerable coaching classes and a railway station all within a kilometre or two. So it is quite a bustling place. Food is strictly ok-ok. Service is good. It is a small place, but the intelligent use of big mirrors, makes it look bigger. Can visit if you are within walking distance.

When I came at Jadavpur, my seniors introduced me this is our party area. Whenever we thought, today we will take food from outside, the 1st choice is Banzara. The Chinese dishes are so tasty and it's enough for two people. I forgot to remember how many times I go there, approx more than at least 50 times. My favorite plates are Mixed Rice Noodles, Dry Chili Chicken, Korean Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice, Schezwan chicken, Kashmiri Pulao etc. The only negative part is, after your order, it will take more than 20 - 30 minutes for serving. Early I tried Indian dishes which is not up to the mark mainly Biriyani. The atmosphere is very much dark which is common for Chinese restaurants.

Don't visit this place on ocassions.You are bound to stand in a queue.This resturant has been here for years now.But their quality has detoriated over time.Their Kashmiri pulao was not upto the mark...very sweet..stuffed with badams.The combination was not at all good.The Chinese food is just ok.
The service is very slow.They keep you waiting even once you placed your order.
The ambiance has not changed over years. 
It's not that easy to spot. Overall it's somewhere between average and below average.

Every time I've visited this place I had to stand in the queue outside the restaurant for a good 20mins even at 8pm in the night. 
P.S- please light up the place properly! its a request!

'A decent place for dining'. Located very near to 8B bus stand at Jadavpur, it's a good place to visit sometime. To state the cons, the area is small, there's no proper place for parking and the service could have been better. 

The mixed mayfoon is awsome and it's a must try if u visit this place. Chilli fish or dried chilli chicken is good too. Although I'm not satisfied with the starters. 

The prices are pocket friendly and the ambience is not bad.

The food price is too friendly and the quantity is huge for a single person. But as expected, the quality of the food was mere average. I ordered Mixed fried rice which was too simple and spiceless. We ordererd hongkong chicken and schezwan chicken but to our surprise both tasted the same !!!! 
Overall a place to comfort your wallet and compromosing your taste buds a bit ;)

If you are a student of Jadavpur University, you have grown up eating in Banzara.
So you go to Banzara when you:

(A)

1.  Are a JU student
2. On your first date with your JU girl/guy
3. Spend less and eat  A LOT
4. Love Chinese, Tandoor and darkness
5. Look for a nearby cozy eatery 
6. Are not a "I eat only in Peter Cat" person.

(B)

Decor: Cozy and nice
Space: Not much, but wont make you suffocated either.
Food: Super (Quality + Quantity)
Crowd: JU students majorly. So you know how they are.
Value for Money: Absolutely
Referable: Absolutely

(C)

Negative Points: Narrow Lane and no parking space if you take your vehicle
Positive Points: Refer to Section B

After a college event, the entire group decided to go for lunch at Banzara.
It serves huge portions of no-nonsense delicious food without causing a prick in your wallet.

★ LOCATION : Take the lane opposite Jadavpur CIT Market (i.e. lane beside Bazeegar) and take the first right turn. After a few steps, Banzara will be on your right.

★ AMBIANCE : The place is quite small but packs in a decent ambiance with dim, warm lights and a huge mirror on the farthest wall. The tables can accommodate a maximum of six people, and since the overall seating area can accommodate around 40 people, you may have to wait for a while during the peak hours.

★ FOOD & SERVICE : I've visited Banzara more than five times and they have delighted me with almost every dish ordered. 

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn : The pieces of corn were bigger than usual, and although the crispiness could have been slightly increased, the quantity and taste left no complaints.

Cantonese Fish : Although it looked dark (plus, the dim lighting), the pieces were soft and delicious. It went really well with noodles.

Schezuan Chicken and Hot Garlic Chicken : The soft (and big) chicken pieces had a lipsmacking gravy and the generous portions of these complemented the fried rice or noodles (which are usually taken with them).

Indian breads : The tandoori roti and lachha paratha are served quite fast and are soft - just the way I relish them.

Chicken Jhalfarezi : It was the first time I had the dish, and considering the strong flavour of capsicum throughout, I'll avoid it in future. 

Chicken Bharta : Loved it. Although the shredded chicken is in the form of quite big pieces, the generous quantity and strong flavor of the chicken is a appealing.

The food is usually on the table in less than 15 minutes. Service is appreciable.

★ PRICES : Banzara is one of the most inexpensive places in the area, and possibly the best among the lot. The cost for two should be around ₹400.

A must visit if you are on a tight budget and wish for really good food in an air conditioned restaurant. :)

This is a small place Jadavpur University. I went there with my mother. We ordered American Chopsuey and Murg Malai Kebab. The chopsuey sauce tasted good and was filled with shredded chicken and baby prawns. The kebab tasted good too. It is a pocket friendly place. But the crowd was a bit noisy. The place is a bit dingy.

Durga puja and Food is almost synonymous to Kolkata, I guess. It was during the Pujas, and we were hungry and all the Restaurants were crowded..and amidst the narrow lanes of Jadavpur..we found this place to eat. The interiors are ok, food was also ok, and trust me, during the pujas, if a restaurant is serving u 'ok' food..the place is worth a try. I did visit it, a couple of times later also, and I found the place good. The price is decent, and the quantity is more than enough for one. Both their Indian and Chinese are good. Service is ok, its a nice place for students and families as well.@

This restaurant is one place you can try out when you are low on budget yet do not want to compromise on the quality . The decor is like any other Chinese main stream restaurant with dim lighting. I have practically dined here twice every fortnight. You will never fall ill or have any problem with the food quality. Best item to order is their Biriyani because its quite light and the chicken portions are very filling. Chinese is good too! But stuck to the conventional dishes such as chilli chicken and fried rice. Too much of experimentation might not be upto your expectations. The take-away quantity is worth mentioning.

I visited this place around 2 to 3 times around one and a half years ago and they hadn't let me down. I had observed a consistency in their food quality - food tastes as good as it did the first day you had the dish. The ambience is very good - quiet and serene.

I would recommend this place to friends and family.

The quality of the chicken dishes wasn't up to the mark. Rice was good though. We wanted to order nan and kulchas but it wasn't available. And the disappointing part, there was a power cut only in that restaurant and they didn't had any power back up n candles were used.

Its at imbrahimpur road, jadavpur 8B market. I have visited this place many times. Max dishes are high in spice content. So spicy foodies you must try this eatery. However it has got some pros and cons.
Pros: good food, pocket friendly, good ambience, good proportion offered,both chinese and indian avaible and both contain delicious menu, some signature dishes offered by them.
Cons: very bad service, food served a long after the placement of order, merely they care about there customers, the lights must be more bright, sometimes the place becomes suffocating when fully crowded.
I have tried many dishes, among them the biriyni is good in taste. The american chopsuey i queit enjoyed. But one dish i will mention about is the picky chiken. It was something really differnt from regular chinese. So i will recomend this dish to evryone, because if you like it you have to visit again and again for it.

The eatery is manned by a maximum of two waiters at a time and a minimum of zero waiter at a time. The quality of food is not good. We ordered a shanghai soup which was like knor soup with shredded chicken and vegies. The peas pullao was better than the others yet not good enough to overcome the other short comings. The jhaal frazi was like normal chicken curry with gravy and shredded chicken.
The eatery is ftequented by families and friends. The waiters weren't cooperative.

This was the very first time that the Zomato ratings misled me. 3.7 which is given here was pretty much enough for me to drop in here. We ordered chicken drumstick, garlic meifoon,chicken rice and red pepper chicken. The drumsticks had no chicken. The red pepper thing tasted flat. The chicken fried rice had a peculiar smell. Maybe of the rice. The only thing that saved our meal was the meifoon,which was definitely very tasty.
The only two things good about this place is, the ambience-very cosy and the quantity of food.

If I do not review this place, it will be a disrespect to my college life  , best place in South if you are a college guy and you want to treat yourself and your friends from your pocket money. 2005-2010 I have been to this place many a times. And three months back I have visited Banzara again, and found it same. Very crowded, don’t expect a fine dine (remember the price), may be you have to wait outside in a queue sometimes, that is common in banzara. But overall a decent one. The food quality, the price, ambience, waiters everything is in sync. Don’t expect buying a TISSOT , in a china market , as simple as that.

Pretty decent restaurant.. Although the price has gone up in the last few years, still it is a good value for money restaurant. Excellent food. Chicken wings, mixed chow all were Delicious.. Very good ambience although the lights could have been brighter. But I am very satisfied with Banzara. Me and my girlfriend surely had an amazing time having lunch at banzara. 

Second visit and you couldn't have predicted a worse experience.. 2 words.. RUDE WAITOR!!

Banzara is one of the good retrorants on the heart of jadavpur.  Good ambience and behaviour of the waiters are friendly.  They provide quality food with good  quantity!  I tried out  Chinese and tandoor dishes..  They were quite impressive!  Dhania chicken was very good.. And I tried Hong Kong hakka noodles which my taste buds loved very much.  Banzara is a great poket friendly restrorant,  and I will totally recommend this place to my friends. :)

Lababdar was quite well prepared..I'm gonna try out a few more dishes next time I visit 8b..

It is a very tiny restaurant but you actually have to be in a queue to get a seat here during meal hours. Used to be our daily hangout place during college days. Well you get Chinese as well as typical north Indian dishes. The food is served in good quantity and tastes pretty good. Please don't go by the size of the place. They actually make quite tasty meals.

Yesterday, I visited banzara with my sister for a hearty Sunday brunch..we were very excited because zomato had given the place a good rating and reviews were also good. But our experience with banzara was highly disappointing.

1 ) waiters are SLOW and IRRITATED. We were served food nearly 45 minutes after we ordered by a glum looking waiter.

2 ) the lights were so dim that I was having difficulty seeing what was on my plate.

3) food was disastrous. First we had ordered chicken reshmi kabab which was so tough that it felt like chewing tyre. Then we ordered butter naan and chicken murg malai, there was no butter on the naan (although they charged us the price of buttered naan) and no masala had penetrated the tough chicken pieces of murg malai and it was just plain bland, next we had ordered hydrabadi chicken biryani and God knows what they brought because it was not biryani in any way; it was full of carrots and curry leaves and swimming in oil with a boiled piece of chicken without salt or masala, we could not eat it at all and it was a wastage of food and money.

3 ) They had completely forgotten that we had ordered cold drinks.

4 ) Further two vegetarians next table were served CHICKEN soup after a half an hour wait, which they realized after putting the stuff inside their mouth.

We were charged rs.780 for food not fit for human consumption. We have made a mental note to steer clear of this place. 

I am just sharing my experience, and readers of this review do not simply base your decision on my experience, feel free to try it out.

We had reshmi kebab, chicken butter masala and gosht biriyani, all of which turned out to be quite good. Infact I have become a fan of the chicken butter masala dish.
The restaurant is a little difficult to locate, especially if you are not familiar with the jadavpur locality . However the shopkeepers by the 8b bus stand were very helpful and it took me and my friend merely 5 mins to locate it.

Yes ! This relatively small restro deserves a 4.0 from me because of their fabulous variety and quality of dishes and their service. Situated in Ibrahimpur road, close to Jadavpur 8B this small dining place is one of the oldest and best restaurants in this area.
                        The place has indoor dining area as well as an outdoor area which is opened during the peak seasons like New Year or Durga Puja. They have given a dark ambiance to the place as the only source of light inside is the shades hanging over each table! Kind a retro in my opinion. Service is good but sometimes they do take an awful lot of time to serve!! The best part is the food! Almost all the items they provide maintains a decent class! Obviously not the best I would say but certainly better than most or all the restaurants in its vicinity. Some dishes worth mentioning is the Chilly Chicken Dry!! Beautiful mixture of heat and sweetness which will take your tastebuds into a roller coaster ride! The Murg Malai Kabab! Coated with a layer of egg this kabab is one of the best kababs I have ever tasted. The Fried Rice! They load it with lots( I mean a LOT!!!) of chicken, prawn or egg depending on the variety which you order! The chicken 65! An unique dish different from the chicken 65 they offer in south! Among the Indian dishes the Pulaos are really exquisite! Butter Masalas are also as they should be,but sometimes a bit over-oily! 
The best part is the value for money! The portions they serve is enough for 2 people. The experience here is bound to make you satisfied as the food is surely well worth for the money spent for it!

Food: 4.5 (budget wise) 
Ambiance: 3
Service: 3.5

Banazara is a comfort place in the alleyways  of jadavpur. A small, cozy dining joint that serves good food at dirt cheap prices. The place is too dimly lit for my liking, but to be honest you are not there for the ambiance. Food is where your priority lies and they won't disappoint you on that front. The quality served is more than enough. On a cold winter afternoon, we settled for the hotness in the hot garlic chicken, accompanied with two bowls of mixed and chicken hakka noodles. The walls have huge mirrors attached, but don't bother looking at yourself while you eat (I freaked myself out :P). The food arrived after a while, the generous portions getting us excited. The noodles were decent, a fair amount of chicken and prawn in it. The hot garlic chicken was hot alright, but the chef was too lenient with the use of red food color, making it look much more fiery than it tasted. But the good thing is, a bill of 430 bucks was able to satisfy four very hungry stomachs, not an easy task by any means. Food is not anything extraordinary, but given the price you'd sure leave the place full and happy.

Value for money is the phrase which suits this place. Fantastic food, the amount is more than sufficient. Tough to find an empty table after 8 pm even on weekdays. Hugely popular with the locals. Kebabs, fried rice, and prawn preparations are the crowd pullers. Mediumly priced tasty food in substantial quanitity is the USP.

Though Park Street and China Town are considered food heaven in Kolkata..Jadavpur for me will always beat the two. Banzara is surely the pride of Jadavpur. It is good food and extremely pocket friendly. The ambiance if fine. The place consists of two columns of dining table and chairs. Each table accommodating 4-6 people. The lights inside are dim. Somehow I felt its too dark!! It could be worked upon and made a bit more bright so that at least we can see the food properly. Our visit was a family one. Our order included drums of Heaven as starters. For main course Tandori roti, Alu matar, Mixed mefoon(rice noodles), Thai chicken. Well absolutely nothing but heavenly food!! The drums of heaven consisted of 6 pieces of chicken and it was crispy and fresh. The Thai Chicken consisted of eight pieces of chicken and the taste was sour and saucy,such that the chicken can be relished with both the tandori roti and the mefoon! What do I say about the mefoon! Absolutely incredible..thin fine goodies getting on your taste buds..Well once in Banzara you must taste the mefoon..its the greed of mefoon that brings me to Banzara time and again. The quantity is sufficient to feed two hungry mouth. The tandori roti was soft and nice. And all this within a budget of INR 650!

I am giving this 2.5 starts only for the Price and quantity. This is a very average restaurant in the Jadavpur locality. Yes it is very pocket friendly and so mostly flocked by students and young crowd. But specially in Chinese I find that the taste of all gravy item is the same. Biryani is okay. but other items are strictly below average for me.

Went to this restaurant with my partner and friends in this puja. Located opposite of the JU and just beside the 8B bus stand jadavpur. The restaurant is well maintained and the ambience was perfect. They serve Chinese and Indian both. We prefered Indian so we ordered chicken tikka, chicken tandoori, mutton biriyani, chicken bharta and tandoori roti. All their items were delicious and well prepared. Prices are also reasonable.

This is a great pocket friendly resaturant in jadavpur.

The service is great.

The quality & taste are good.

Also the food is served in good quantity.It'll definitely meet your hunger :p

I went once during the pujas. It was extremely crowded.

And we had to stand in the queue for an hour.

The price is normal.i.e a great low budget restaurant. :)

This place is a true "Value for Money" restaurant. I frequented this place all through my college life even though my college was a long way away from here.
The quality of food ia great. The quantity served in each dish is extremely high. 2 people can eat heartily by ordering 1 main dish and 1 side dish.
This is my GO TO place for the birthday treats. Since both Chinese and Mughlai are available, everyone is happy.
It may be dimly lit but it serves great food!

I was recently in Jadavpur visiting my friends and we all went to this food joint for an evening eat out. My friend had already located the place on one of her journey's before, so we didnt have to spend much time locating it. However, for people from outside Jadavpur it may be a little difficult to spot the place as it is located in the by lanes of the market near 8b.

Coming to the food, it was good; really good. We tried the spcl gravy noodles, the american chopsuey and chicken 65. The chicken 65 was really unique and I liked the gravy noodles... quite delicious and the portions were really great! And the price is quite pocket-friendly. We hardly reached the 500/- mark and all three of us were quite full.

The decor and the ambiance is acceptable though nothing very spcl. The light is dim but not dark. The waiters are friendly and the service is quite fast. 

Would really like another visit.

The restaurant is located in a congested area at Jadavpur. 
It will be troublesome to visit this place with large number of people in a group since seating arrangement is not sufficient for such. The ambiance of this restaurant is a "so-so" kind.
I went this place for evening snacks and ordered for veg sweet corn soup with chicken drumstick. The food quality was good and price was also reasonable.

Whosoever opens a restaurant in Jadavpur area makes money. Only mantra- being pocket friendly. Banzara is no exception. Tucked in some lanes of Jadavpur, you find no good reason to be here. Had been to this place may be a year or sp back, but hardly could highlight anything else than being pocket friendly. We found all the items taste similar and is served in similar gravy.

Frequented by JU students all the time, Food in this restaurant is very good. Prices are just a bit on the higher side, especially as the taxes are extra. However what really brought down a point for me is their very late service and small seating. ambiance was good, though. It is in fact difficult to get a table in the later parts of the evening.

Been there for two times and had awful experiences both the times. Had to wait for more than one hour for the food and found a hair in the soup that we ordered. When we complained about the situation the management was not ready to accept their mistake and continuously argued with us. Although the quality and taste of the food was good.

"POCKET FRIENDLY!!" Is what comes first to ur mind along woth banzara!!
Good food with humungous portions and but ofcourse in a very reasonable price is what this reataurant serves..
Its located a bit off beat in jadavpur, so u have to travel and walk through the lanes and get inside the 8b market to get over there!!
The entrance is not so huge and catchy, so, u might bypass the restaurant even.. but, dont underestimate it by its location and the looks!!
The ambience is ok, nothing great, though its beautifully decorated all the 365 days of a year!!, not properly lighten up.. but something that can suffice your vision.. in all, ordinary setup !!
Now coming to the food, we ordered a chicken meifoon and chicken in black bean sauce as a side dish.. inspite of being a bit crowdy, the food was served without delay.
The quantity was huge!! The meifoon was well cooked and was with generous serving of shredded chicken in it, and ao was the chicken in black bean sauce.. it was so much that a single plate of each served well for two of us.. and we were quite full after consumption..
In all, good place for days when ur short of cash.. 
Looking forward to visit again!!

This is a very convenient  restaurant for me as it always satisfies my taste buds and my poor pocket simultaneously and is very close to my University campus. :D

Its a small and cozy place with a dimly lit ambiance,thanks to the traditional Chinese chandeliers that hang from the ceiling. The waiters are generous and the service is swift enough. 

Coming to the food,the quantity served is usually amazing. The Paneer dishes like Paneer Butter masala or Shahi Paneer accompanied by Tandoori Roti or Butter Naan are lip-smacking. Chicken Fried rice is another good thing you can try here. A very disappointing dish is the Crispy Chicken. I don't find any justification of the pool of oil in which the chicken pieces garnished with cashew nuts float! 

Overall its a perfect place for lunch or dinner keeping your tummy and purse in a harmonious bond ;) :D

I have been there for my friend's birthday.. so, we get to taste quite a few dishes(all chinese). our order contains dishes like mixed fried rice, szechwan rice, szechwan chicken, chicken manchurian, hot garlic chicken. most of the dishes were value for money. the best combination is mixed fried rice with szechwan chicken, both of the dishes were delicious and lucrative, you cant stop praising it..hot garlic chicken was also good and chicken manchurian just stands well, nothing special. the let down was szechwn rice, they are charging more for it than mixed fried rice but nothing is better in it. avoiding it is the better option. the biggest advantage of this place is its price, it is cheap compared to other  established chinese restaurants but delivers quality with more than satisfying quantity.. if we dont be judgemental and not only go for brand value, this place is really one of the better options.
one drawback is that the seats are not that comfortable, lack of space is a problem. otherwise, for casual hangouts with friends or when your pocket seems not so strong, this should be in your radar..

Pocket-friendly restaurant beside Jadavpur University, a minute-walk from 8B Bus-stand, Banzara is a good spot for hungry souls. Had chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian and chicken biriyani, 1 plate each with three of my ever-broke friends. The quantity of food served is quite good compared to the price. Ambiance is good too but one tiny problem lies in the time they take to serve the food after ordering. It took over 20 minutes for them to serve the ordered dishes, and this happened every time I visited the place. Otherwise, it's a good place!

We didn't order any starter directly jumped into the main course.. Had the most common dish chicken fried rice and red pepper chicken.. The rice was fresh and tasty and the chicken was good.. The only bad thing was that the chicken was thickly covered which made it look bigger.. Otherwise everything was okay..

Of the umpteenth time i have visited banzara i remember ordering banzara special friedrice . Its like the best thing on earth . The fact that everytime i went there was because of it . The indian  food  items are good and worth trying . kebabs are good . so is the chinese spread . noodles , boneless chicken items everything . Just they have no  good desserts on the menu  which is dissappointing for people having a sweet tooth . Also the waiters need to be active with serving people

It is  one of the pocket friendly yet decent restaurant in the locality of Jadavpur. I used to visit this place with my family from a very long time, when there was no other restaurant in this locality which served quality chinese (my , my mothers and my sisters choice) and tandoori (my dad's choice) dishes together. so, banzara became our regular choice of eating out as no one had to compromise with their choices!! The place is medium sized and yet in most of the cases there is a big queue outside it, which helps to build up the hunger stronger! The food is excellently good. my sisters loved the way they serve the kababs with a nicely cut tomato lit from inside!! The murg malai kabab is just wow!! and so are the fish kababs. I first had szechwan chicken here, and i lloved it. Chicken cantonese is also good. The noodles are standard in taste. Amount wise, they are pretty good. One dish can be fairly shared by two. In an all, this place can give you a nice eating experience...so go for it!

Banzara was one of the firsts of the new good restaurants around Jadavpur when the area only had Blue Lagoon!  The quality of food has deteriorated over the years but this place serves average food in good quantity.

The quantity is HUGE!

I particularly dislike the cashewnut and capsicum fried rice. Other than that, the rest of the rice items are well cooked. I would try the Keema friend rice on my next visit though. I have tasted the Shanghai chicken and Hong Kong chicken but would like to experiment with tanpora and picky chicken next time. The pepper chicken is the best of the lot and they even provide 8 pieces. Chop suey is a little disappointing. But quantity wise, every item would fill your heart.

I have special complains about the ice cream. They would just bring you cups of Kwality walls when you order ice cream :O


Pretty affordable and nothing special about this place, but close to home be the only factor that takes me here. Oh try and avoid this place on holidays as it is small and becomes very crammed up.

I have visited the place a number of times. The place is near to my university so it was a de facto choice for birthday treat or job treat :). This is a quite place with romantic lights on. I specially recommend the crispy chicken everyone loves that here. Fish finger and the Chicken Tandoori is great. I  The chicken mushroom babycorn is one of my favourites here. I generally take the chinese food here which is pretty good here.  The place is very good in terms of value for money. Visit this place if you are at Jadavpur.

I visited this place on a hot summer afternoon. Now about the location the place is a bit difficult to find as it is in the insides of 8B bus stand. But those who are familiar with the directions given by the people of Jadavpur, it is not difficult to find. 
 The ambience is okay fit for a friendly get together and not for a romantic getaway. But it is good as the dim light provides enough appetiser. :D

We ordered for drums of heaven,  a normal dish of fried rice and Shanghai chicken. I must say the drums of heaven were edible but too spicy. The Rice was quite decent enough but the Shanghai Chicken was far from what it was supposed to be. The quantity was 'voluptuous' but it required soft drinks to calm the chillies.

The time between food serving was okay and the person waiting on us was quite  amiable. The price is reasonable and you do not have to pay taxes so it does not hurt your budget. 

A good try for people throwing a Birthday treat but Couples please try the chai stall near 8B. It would be better.

It's been long since I have wanted to write a review for this awesome restrau . Jadavpur is a regular place of 'adda' for me and my friends. I found out this hidden surprise when i was a college student and ever since then when it comes to 'which place to go for food at jadavpur?' the answer is always BANZARA for me ... the food quality, the staffs, the service ... each and everything is a reason for another visit.. their chinese items are praise-worthy.

A nice, economical place specially favourable for college students situated near 8b.. visited once and i am already a fan.. ordered chinese dishes. Chicken drumstick as snacks was good, and had 6 pieces. Then we had mixed fried rice and chicken sweet and sour.. the rice was huge in amount so much so that even two of us could hardly finish.. the chicken sweet and sour was good and had 8 pieces.. one plate was more than enough for two.. and lastly the bill.. was just 443 including vat and taxes.. what else can you expect.. want to visit again

This is a gem hidden away in a not-so-quiet lane in Jadavpur. In my university days, this, along with Grub Club, Dolly's and Denzong would form the mainstay of our eating-out options in the vicinity. The Indian cuisine that Banzara serves is pretty delectable- standard Indian oily stuff I agree, but delicious nonetheless. The prices are reasonable too,and the ambience isn't shady. Reasons enough for visiting the joint.

This is another of those gems hidden in the hustle and bustle of Jadavpur. No more than twice have I been to this eatery, but it still has managed to create a sizeable impression on my hard-to-impress psyche. It loses out on customers because of it's bunglesome location,  but apart from that, there's little you wouldn't like about the place. A lot of people have complained about the lighting here, but I found the lights to be pretty easy on the eye, which lend the place an enviable charm. It isn't huge by any stretch of imagination, but isn't too puny or cramped either. The fact that it has a loyal base of customers who keep coming back here is in itself self- explanatory: it thrives on it's hard- earned reputation.
And the reputation comes from the excellent food it serves to it's customers at very affordable rates. Order anything and the quantities would make you go WOW. And the food looks and tastes superbly scrumptious. There's this particular shredded chicken recipe they have in the Chinese section, which gives you a taste of heaven. Long, deep- fried strips of chicken in a saucy, tangy gravy is something to die for, specially when you have an equally great Hong Kong fried rice or chicken fried rice to go with it. Try out the Fish Golden coins too, as with large cubes of deep- fried fresh fish in a zany sauce, it works wonders.  I haven't yet tried the Indian section here, but there's no reason why I shouldn't, in the near future. 
I am heading back to this place as soon as I have that deep craving for shredded chicken, no questions raised! And there's no reason why you shouldn't give it a go...today itself!

From my 10+2 to college days I've gone there for the most number of times. I really like their Chinese dishes as these are very spicy and tasty. Also the quantity of dishes are more than enough for two people. The ambiance, quality, quantity and price everything is decent. Really a good experience.

Banzara is located in the alley of Ibrahimpur Road, near 8B Bus Stand, Jadavpur. it is not far from JU, that is why , it has become a famous hang out place among the youngsters. During Durga Puja Days, you will find a pretty long queue in front of this place. 
Now coming to the food. I have had Sanghai chicken, Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken and several other Chinese dishes. The Chinese section of this joint is decent enough. Indian section is also good, I had Chicken Tandoor once. This Restaurant is decent both in terms of quality and quantity. It will not burn a hole in your pocket. Ambiance is not bad. Some of my friends do not like its dim light decoration, but it suits me well.
 The keys of success of this restaurant are 1. affordable price 2. huge quantity 3. good position 
P.s- try to avoid this place during Puja days.

Good place for lunch/dinner. Good decor but bit small so seems over-crowded at times. Food tastes decent. Tried thai soup, shredded chicken, pepper chicken. Liked all three of them very much. The biriyani was good, not great. 
To mention, the mixed fried rice served there is very good and comes with a very good amount. If you are a small eater, it can easily serve two.  Mutton maharaja is again a good one to choose.
Overall a very good experience. :)

Out of nowhere I found myself in a diner, because this did grab our eyes while passing and my friends were having hunger-ache. So we pushed ourselves in a fully decorated restaurant. You don’t have to worry about the seating arrangement, there is enough space to fit you in. “Mirror, mirror on the wall”- this is the theme of the décor I guess, as I saw it. 


Food- 

As my eye always wonders for Chini food, I made no exception to that. I played safely and ordered Chilly Garlic Noodles and Sanghai Chicken. And we waited for long 30 thirty minutes to taste our cuisines, that delayed our appetite too. But the food was on an average level, the Chicken was licking good and robust with balanced spices, but chicken pieces were a bit too chewy, and on the other side the noodles were drab and no special things to divulge. 


On the terms of service, a couple of dishes come to your plates, that dishearten you some pointers. So I suggest them to work on their skills a little bit. But as far as they are putting up pleasurable food on your plates, they can be forgiven. Looking for a night out with friends, this is the place you put your hands on.

Banzara is a hidden treasure in the alleys of Jadavpur. Yes, it is difficult for newcomers like me to find but thanks to my friends, J and S.
I wasnt really expectant of Banzara. The place was packed with people that afternoon. We had to wait outside but we were called in almost immediately after a few people thankfully left. I was almost famished.
Once inside, I noticed that the place is actually nice. The only thing that is required is the light which seems very very bleak. They need to light up the place.
Seating : Cosy and comfortable
Menu : Mouthwatering
Staff : Helpful though inattentive at places.

We were an extremely hungry bunch of 3 who came to eat after a show of Dedh Ishqiya. I'll tell you where all the hunger came from. (They showed biryani and kebabs in the movie) *facepalm*

Yes, so we ordered :

Thai soup
Chicken fried rice
Pepper chicken

Trust me, I had not expected such good food at such a catchy price.
The food was absolutely delicious and I guess I felt even better because I was so hungry.
A thumbs up for the food. The bill came to a meagre 487/- which I felt was fine.

Definitely coming back for more.

Reading the reviews I went to the restaurant, but I am very much disappointed. The seating arrangement is crammed. The service is pathetic. The food is not worth its price, (very very spicy). The Chinese chicken preparation tasted same for all dishes. The most astonishing thing is that they charge VAT + Service Charge both. and another strange thing is the service charge is calculated on total bill, not on 40 % of the bill (which is the proper rule). The overall experience is very bad. So my request is to avoid this cheater restaurant.

I studied at JU and Banzara was a favorite haunt of ours. It is a great place to have food at low prices. Honestly, we devoured the food there in our college days but it is anything but fine dining. Yes the food is tasty but it is not mouthwatering stuff. The mongolian chicken in Banzara is quite good and so is the fried chilli chicken. I would not recommend the american chopsuey since I do not like things that are too sweet. All in all, I would give the place a 2.5 but emotions do rule sometimes and due to the long rapport with the place, I shall give it a 3.0.

This is one of the best multi cuisine restaurants in south kolkata, though it is famous for its chinese, oriental cuisine and most of the people prefer that but they prepare some lip-smacking north indian delicacy also, located in a very odd location and if people who are not from the vicinity try to find the restaurant then they may face some problem like me, parking is a big problem so its better not to go by own car and though the dining area is quite big but it remains full always so take away may be a good option, they serve food very fast so waiting time is insignificant.. we tried mixed fried rice, korean chicken and banzara special chicken.. the fried rice was huge in amount , had tremendous amount of chicken prawn eggs and mushrooms just like tangra restaurants, tastes wonderful, korean chicken had green gravy , very tasty, special chicken was the best, though very oily for chinese food but still extremely tasty and since all the chicken items contains 8 very big pieces of chicken so it becomes very very pocket friendly, 2 plates of rice and only one plate of chicken can be shared by 4 people easily..Ambiance was homely , waiters were helpful, serving time was minimal, no wonder why all the local people and university students flock there.. Dont get fooled by the odd location and dimly lit,narrow entrance, Its a winner in every possible way..

Let us talk about food first. Good taste and enough quantity to serve two visitors. Ambiance is ok and sitting is comfortable but the small inside space gives you less space for movement. Its location and price is giving this restaurant an upper hand as many student groups are visiting this place regularly :). Service time is satisfactory but servers are not. A long waiting queue for the food is disheartening as other restaurants like golden gate and chopsticks, which are nearby, serving food of similar taste and quantity at the matching prices.

Banzara well it quite known to people who lives in the area around 8b and Jadavpur area majorly known for its Chinese cuisine ...it was a good restaurant but not now.I visited no. of times and i got disappointed more and more. For me i had a incident i found that when i ordered Fried Rice with Chicken Manchurian they got it right but one thing was poorly wrong was its chicken they did not baked that properly and i could feel is rawness very much awkward moment, next time I ordered a Biriyani to take home later at home when i opened the pack it looked gr8 but when i tasted it kinda duhh...flavour with not spices and it cost me about 145 bucks incl taxes and manager is also sometimes rude to customers with me and sometime with other customers...really Banzara laid down.

Eat to your heart's content at Banzara!

Among the few things that can put you off about a restaurant, the most important is the price factor. When the cost of food is too high, you think twice before dining in a restaurant. Most important of all, you cannot drop in at any time with just a few hundred in your pocket. Again, most of the time you cannot afford to taste more than two to three items as ordering something extra means you burn a bigger hole in your pocket. Sometimes, you just cannot afford to eat in an overly expensive restaurant. But, when each item is reasonably priced and each preparation (veg or non-veg) tastes awesome, you are more likely to visit that restaurant again and again.

I must say that Banzara at 86, Ibrahimpur Road, Jadavpur, Kolkata, is one restaurant where you would die to eat again if you once taste their awesome Chinese and Indian food preparations. I have been there twice. Once I got to taste some of their authentic Chinese preparations, and the second time I gorged on some north Indian delicacies. Eating at Banzara was fun because both times I was accompanied by my close friends, who just loved the food here. 

Among its wide range Chinese delicacies, I particularly liked their chicken drumsticks and fried prawn in garlic lime sauce as starters. Banzara makes some lip-smacking soups. Try their chicken noodle soup and shanghai soup, I'm sure you'll love both the preparations. My main course menu consisted of chilli garlic fried rice, Cantonese noodles, Korean chicken and Thai chilly pomfret, which I found scrumptious and appetizing. 

On my second visit, I ordered some really delicious north Indian dishes. My three course meal consisted of kebabs ( hariali kebab, murg dhania kebab and boti kebab), Amritsari kulcha, murg biryani, chicken jhal frazie, murg massalam and palak cream. I am not embarrassed to confess that both times I licked my platter clean because the food was just awesome! Eat here once and decide for yourself.

went here twice with my friends was satisfied both times. i still remember the fist time we went there it was 2 or 3 years ago. the 4 of us always have soup when having chinese, which was ok i say that because i don't remember how it actually tasted. We ordered hakka & rice noodles with sanghai & mongolian chicken now if i remember correctly the sanghai chicken tasted like salty garlic chicken which tasted really good with our hakka noddle, there rice noodles was actual rice noodles or what is called mei fun noodles not like some other place that just serves hakka noodles as rice noodles, which we had with mongolian chicken, 2 of my friends were scared when the dish was served as the gravy was red they were afraid it was going to be too hot & spicey but me & anki saw the cashew nuts on top & decided it was a sweet dish  & it was sweet :) & with the rice noodles it was like eating a desert !

Banzara can be recommended for two reasons - it's cheap, and the quantities served are huge. Apart from that, there is little to set it aside from the hundreds of restaurants in Calcutta that serve both Chinese and Indian food.

The air-conditioned restaurant has two rows of tables that allow groups of six to sit in them. There is a second room opened up in case the restaurant gets too full (which it often does). Service is average, depending on the exoticism of the dish ordered.

Banzara is a place to order commonly known items. Ordering exotic dishes may lead to delays and almost certainly will lead to disaster. Standard noodle items, two or three different kinds of fried rice and an assortment of chicken items (on the Chinese food menu) have been what I have found to be best. I have occasionally had kebabs and found them good, but I cannot vouch for the excellence of the other Indian items.

This place is worth going to if you are very hungry, and preferably if you are in a group. Over the last decade or so, many students have found that it suits their pockets very well.

You know those days when you and your friends gang up and want to go out somewhere to eat lots of GOOD, familiar food without burning a hole in your pocket? That's when you go to banzara.
Of course, the first problem is to find it. It's nicely located in some twisty little lane with very little pointers: the trick is to keep an eye out for the prominent Hindusthan sweets at 8B bus-stand and take a left. Ask a local,its a stone's throw away once you're in the alley.
That done, this restro has that sort of decor that seems to have a '90s hangover. It's got this pseudo-egyptian feel, theres mood lighting,all that jazz! Its not very big, but if youre going in a big group, they have a separate room where dining is comfortable.

Now,the FOOD. Quantity is pretty good. The menu is varied. There's chinese and indian like any old indian restaurant, but the ingredients are fresh and not every chicken dish tastes the same, so you can go ahead and enjoy what you're eating. Don't expect something new or different: you'll get what you've always seen on menu cards, but be assured of the quality. Like any mid range Indian restaurant, their store of desserts is negligible.
Staff's friendly and the place is pocket friendly. In fact,a meal for two would cost less than 500,really.
Do give it a visit. :)

They have a starter, I do not remember the name of which, and it comes with a strangely cut tomato in between they hide a burning candle. The full serving dish glows with red hues.

Small budget restaurant near jadavpur and a good dining option if you dont want to travel far or prefer takeout. I personally used to love the chinese prawn and lamb dishes. The fried rice I found a little bland and without pork. Maybe they have improved it nowadays.The best dish that i tasted there was the Mutton Maharaja. It is a specialty of theirs and done with curd and cashews. Excellent with both roti based and rice dishes especially biriyani. The chinese apart from the prawn section is average.

The ambiance is average for the charges and the waiters  polite. However, food does take sometime to arrive.

When I had come to Banzara a few years back I didn't like the food but recently had heard a lot about it from my friends and thought of giving it a try. I was disappointed, yet again!
The restaurant is difficult to locate for a non localite. Because the place is small, we had to wait outside. 
Tried the Biryani. The quantity was good but the Mutton pieces were hard. Potato was soft but tasteless and boiled. 
Wanted to try the Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Hyderabadi Biryani but was unavailable. Since I wanted to eat something spicy the waiter suggested a side order which was horrible. Stale, undercooked and tasteless. 
The pricing is moderate and the waiters friendly.
For those not staying in the close vicinity, this place is not worth a visit..

The thing with Banzara is, you are at liberty to be a little messy and have a carnival of sorts if you are with your friends. Thankfully not one of those restaurants where you are greeted by loud blaring pulp-music every time you step in for a grub, the ambiance in Banzara is generally on the mellower side, with soft lights and down-tempo music. Service is extremely fast and prompt, and the attendants are patient as you scourge through the menu. Of course, they wouldn't usually forward any suggestions about the chef's specialty, they would at least forward necessary information about a particular item combination. Chinese staples like noodles and Rice are usually served in heaps, with two plates being enough for three non-ogre-sized people. The preparations are usually on the spicier side, especially the shredded Red Chili Chicken, and is suggested only for people who love their tang. The Chili Garlic noodles are excellent, and served in generous quantities. The rice-platters, however, leave more to be desired, but honestly, the fare is rather good for a price that is covered by a college-goer's pocketmoney. Suggested are the singapore noodles, and the chili garlic noodles for their balance of spices and a unique taste. The biriyani is also rather good, and served in king-sized proportions, and shall make for a feast when combined with their Reshmi butter masala, and the chicken butter masala. The paneer butter masala, however, is somewhat on the blander side. So, the final verdict out of Five is - 

food - 3.5/5
ambience - 3.25/5 
service - 3.5/5

happy piggin' !!
