Situated at the Axis Mall food court, the Family Chicken serves two types of food... Fast food and Korean food.
The fast food is great, you can expect it to be like any other junction serving burgers, fries and chicken pieces.
Whereas the Korean style of food has a lot of variety and has great presentation.
We ordered for Osam Bulgogi- that has squid, pork and vegetables in a thick brown gravy accompanied by white rice and a bowl of light soup which had egg whites and carrots.

The style was very good as the rice was served in a cute heart shape and the platter was neatly arranged. I would give a big thumbs up to this joint!

If this is how they serve food in Korea, I don't want to go! Seriously, after reading tons of great reviews, my boyfriend and I went to this place with a lot of high expectations. We ordered Kimchi Deopbap and Bokumbap. The taste was terrible. It was very sour. The cabbage wasn't well marinated and it was raw. It wasn't pickled. We were handed a bill that was close to 1K. And we left with a heavy heart. I'm pretty sure this is not how they serve authentic Koean food. I'm never visiting this place again. They made me hate Korean food.

This place claims to be a Korean outlet but also serves pizzas. We tried sausage pizza and we were disappointed. Generally flat base pizzas are delicious but this one was balant and tasteless. I haven't tried any Korean food here but I'm hoping that the next time I'm here, I'll definitely try something Korean and my perception will change.

One Word : Disgusting !!

Location : Food Court , Axis Mall

Food : Both Korean & American cuisines are there on the menu . Since i have a place close by & it was getting late , ordered a home delivery for a "Family meal" along with an extra Chicken Burger. Delivery time was acceptable , about twenty minutes . The food was the biggest disappointment . Firstly the Coke was dripping inside the polythene plastic bag . But the french fries was definitely the worst item ever !! It was half done , wasn't crunchy , soft and soggy , no taste at all !! I believe first timers in the kitchen could have belted out a better preparation of the simple potato fries . Next came the fried Chicken . The chicken seemed stale & extremely rubbery . The only thing somewhat right were the Chicken burgers although the patties were very slim in both .

Cost for 2 :  550/- plus

Final Conclusion : I've been into American cuisine since my college days. Be it KFC , Mcdonald's , Rooster Delights and numerous places in Deshapriya park & Kasba , i've visited them all but never have i had such a worse experience irrespective of the stature of the place . If someone can't prepare a proper plate of french fries , then it's time shut down business completely and to top it all they had the nerve to charge 120/-+ for the coke and fries ..  Stop serving American fast food dishes & fooling people you worthless piece of trash of a store ..

One of the only kiosk/restaurant in kolkata that serves authentic korean food. Being quite a big fan of the korean culture, naturally I like korean food as well. I remember this restaurant being there for more than 7 years but it has been on and off on its service. Finally its open. The owners are korean ( met them personally) and they are the nicest people ever. Coming back to the food, its situated in the food court of axis mall, rajarhat. We ordered for osam bulgogi, korean spicy chicken, haemul ramyun and kimbab. Kimchi was served as well. The food was delicious and worth every penny. They also served American food like burgers and all.

I visited axis mall yesterday for a movie and thus decided to give this outlet a try as I was hungry after the movie got over. Honestly there is nothing to be considered about the ambiance. The service was kinda okay. Had chicken deopbab as the person said it will have gravy, and its squid or pork variant will be dry and since it is accompanied by rice, I chose the chicken one. The presentation was good and they gave a bowl of egg soup too with it. The chicken was medium spicy and contained lots of sesame and the rice was sticky. The gravy contained ample amount of bell peppers too. It was filling and sufficient for 2 people, for snacking  only. It tasted okay, however, I am not sure if this is what authentic Korean food is.

It calls itself a korean food outlet. The burgers, pizza, chicken popcorn everything seemed too much overpriced considering both quantity and quality of food. We ordered Chicken sausage pizza comprising of 4 pieces. Too oily, small with no good amount of cheese and very thin crust. Nevermore shall I visit them.

I often go to this place in Axis Mall. I normally don't prefer food courts but this addition in Axis Mall has been a good experience. I like korean food here and i suggest that you try these items:

1. Chicken Deopbub or Jeayuk Deopbub ( In case you prefer pork)

2. Ramyun

3. Dakdoritang (Good quantity - 8 pieces of chicken)

They also do home delivery in and around newtown. 

Happy Dining !!!

I have been in love with Korean culture and all their TV shows for a long time. This small food court let me experience the Korean crusine for the first time without burning a hole in my pocket.

The fact that this is a food court with lots of crowd with zero ambience will actually have you concentrate on the food only. I had chicken Deopbap and kimbap which comes along with kimchi,soy and a special red sauce. My taste buds are super happy and I am going to have a try on the other items as well.. Staff is very nice. And the quantity of the food is enough for 2 people.

Kimbap looks like sushi roll and it had chicken, egg, carrots and cucumber stuffed inside with sticky rice and a seaweed binding outside. The soup with it is tasteless but maybe thats how it is supposed to be.

Chicken Deopbap: Now this dish looks like any other Chinese dish with capsicum and dark gravy but when you try this you will see its taste is quite different and tasty as well.

I don't know how authentic this Korean food court is but I am going to try out more Korean food.

Too bad for the location inside the food court of a mall which ruins any hope of ambience. Hoping they will move into an own space at some point. Other than that, it's nice to have a Korean option in rajarhat! Do not even think of not ordering the kimbap if you happen here! It's delish. I also loved the seafood ramyun and the kimchi. This place is always full of Koreans, must be a good sign ;)

This is not a famous eatery but I have a little fascination for this place because of the chicken salad. There are always something or the other in a food joint which you always wanna mention about so family chicken always reminds me the salad. Otherwise nothing great to talk about cause it is an average kinda restaurant & you can definitely give a try for lunch or a dinner or evening snacks maybe.

Very good restaurant. They are offering kfc type fried chicken from long time and I had been their countless times. They have some variations also in fried chicken like honey-soy, spicy fried . try honey soy fried. Regarding Korean food , I am not a big fan of Korean food . I tried all in the menu. Only kimbab is good to me. By the way, it is said that they serve authentic Korean food. Probably Korean food doesn't suit Bengali taste bud.

To this restaurant, we went some time back. This one is quite easily noticeable. The entire space that is located on the ground floor. The side that's overlooking the road is walled with glass displaying the inside to the passers by. Also it will let the customers enjoy the view outside while savouring their orders inside. I liked the concept. The place is cosy, large and neat with pop of red here and there.

The food prepared here are through and through variegated. You can find the regular and thinkable Chinese delicious delicacies here. But what is exclusive here are the Korean cuisines. Candidly speaking, I have never had the experience with Korean items, so this was my golden opportunity, and I didn't miss it. I for my part had ordered a certain Korean dish named Seafood Handmade Noodles Soup. 

This bowl was fraught with an assortment of seafood which individually I do not know the names of. The bowl was filled up to the brim, I tell you. I really enjoyed it. It tasted really well, rather better than my expectations.

The restroom was decent and well-maintained. I believe, the degree of cleanliness in toilets unravels the overall understanding and practice of hygiene standards in a restaurant.

Now of course the prices are a tad inclined towards the expensive. So there will be items that you could categorize as the not-so-inexpensive ones. But I really think once or twice for the sake of exploring new cuisines, you can avoid anxiety over the expenses incurred, once or twice just.

Been here for a birthday treat. The place is definitely not one of the better dining grounds of Salt Lake. The food was very average although the prices seemed to make you hope otherwise. The fried goods are somewhat like any of the fast food joints you find in  busy market places with funny names like "... Fried Chicken". The Chinese cuisine was comparatively on the better end of the spectrum. Not one place you must definitely visit. But then again they give free WiFi ;)

Visitng this place since when it only served fried chicken dishes, now its a korean/japanese food joint with fried chicken still on the menu. I and my friends always visit there for fried chicken dishes which is just out of the world specially the quality and quantity of chicken they serve. Its also way cheaper than KFC or a Rooster. Never tried the korean food but wish too. They also have sushie on the menu.

Probably one of the few Korean restaurants in Kolkata. It is located amidst the bunch of famous sweet shops in the sector-1. 
I entered the restaurant without any knowledge about the eatery served there. The interior was very conventional- clean enough. As I took a glance at the menu- I felt it a bit overpriced. To be very honest- most of the dish names were new to me. 
I ordered a chicken noodles gravy- they served it soon. 
As I took a quick slurp- it tasted to be awesome !! The quantity was sufficient. 
Though I am a foodie- but the thing that would drag me again towards it is its wifi. I downloaded the entire Temple Run 2, on my ICS phone in 45 secs !!! :-D
That adds an amazing essence to the food served in the restaurant !!!

Nothing can beat the Korean Cuisine here! My first ever taste of kimbab and kimchi, thanks to Family Chicken. I even ordered for an Osam Bulgogi which is basically squid and pork barbecued in Korean style. Growing up watching Korean movies and dramas I always wanted to have a taste of their wonderful cuisine. Although the space is quite small and congested. But altogether it was a wonderful experience.

Went just for the sake of my Korean obsession but was in for a surprise. They served actual Korean food there! The rice with barbecued squid and pork curry was a nice change to the mostly Indian and Chinese palate of mine. 
Just have to work a little bit on the ambience, music and decor and it would be a famous food joint in no time. Definitely going again. Those who want to try something other than just Chinese food can visit once. For the sake of experimentation.

An other nice place in the Swimming Pool area at Salt Lake. If you are in the area and looking for some Chinese or Korean food, you can get to Family Chicken. They offer nice preparations at decent price and the service is prompt too.

A must visit for all oriental food lovers especially if you want Korean food since this is one of the few places that offers it.Chicken deopbab and Kimbab were the two exquisite korean preparation that took us by delight. The soup served were of good quality and had something yum about it.However to my surprise the place was completely deserted on a Sunday afternoon and the two of us were the only customers. Staff behaviour was extremely polite considering we were their only customers for the day and it really put us into suspicions regarding our choice but we found the Korean food really nice and other than that everything as pretty ordinary.  There Card swiping machine was not working (not because of link failure but the guys there could not operate it). We had walk all the way to the ATM and hand over the cash to their staff. Also it is best to avoid any dessert they offer.

FC is pretty awesome when it comes to Korean food, especially being run by a Korean owner, and the only place so far in Kolkata that serves this cuisine. Been visiting them since the time they started in 2006, good comfort food, excellent for lunch breaks at work, their weekday brunches are good and reasonable too. My favorites though are the Korean curry rice combos (squid or pork with veggies) with loads of Gochujang (Korean chilly paste) and the bibimbap when too hungry. They could improve on the music though, try something Oriental to go with the food, instead of tacky hindi songs. Keep serving Korean food, expand your menu to include grills and Galbis and do what you do best guys!

Tired of the same chicken menus? Then you should visit this place. The name itself suggests that they satisfy the chicken lovers.
We had soya and honey chicken, chicken salad and french fries. The salad was very simple with finely shredded cabbage and carrot and good amount of fried crispy chicken, garnished with mayonnaise. Slurrrrp...
The soy and chicken is soft, tender and sweet.
The place looks very simple, with not much decoration. The tables are laid in homely manner. A reasonable place.
Parents, don't hesitate to take your little ones to taste the flavors of Korea.
A good news....besides parkstreet and esplanade, you would get wi-fi. Boys, must take your girlfriend to this place on the V'day. Both girl and world cup can be handled well ;)
Non-veggies, get up and move and try out the chicken. Worth going, paying and munching here.

Family Chicken looks spacious and big from the outside, but it doesn't seat many people. The stink hits you as soon as you open the door, and it's quite strong and stomach turning. The table cloth has dried food stuck on it. So if ambience is a criteria for a diner, then this place is an epic fail. 

Despite this, I resisted the urge to flee and decided to brave through the food as this is the only Korean joint in town and I wanted to see how the food is. Ordered an osam bulgogi to test what the food might be like before racking up a major bill. It was actually very tasty. Not spicy despite the colour. The pork and squid pieces were generous. This was served with an egg drop soup which I didn't have. The next thing I tried was the regular fried chicken. Despite being very greasy, this was was also very tasty. The last thing I tried was the handmade noodle seafood soup. This was a big letdown. The broth was completely clear and thin and had the taste similar to plain boiled water. The noodles weren't chewy unfortunately, and the seafood pieces were too meagre. All in all, not something I would order again. However the accompanied gochujang gave the broth some taste and kick and made it edible. These 3 items plus 1 soft drink cost 800 including taxes.

Their chicken skewers and egg drop soup (served with the rice and gravy dishes) are really good. I find their Korean gravies too spicy. They are full of red chilli but that is probably how Korean cuisine is. Other than than, the quantity is good and the food has a very distinct and nice test. As far as I can tell, the ingredients are very fresh. A must try.

Korean food might not look appealing like Chinese & Japanese food (like they feast for the eyes), but like Indian food it is appealing in taste buds. With Authentic Korean food like  닭도리탕 ( Dhak-dhori-thang), something a stew made for the princes in ancient and medieval Korea to take off their stress is something evergreen food that can be consumed to de-stress our day-to-day Indian modern stressed lives... Served with Authentic Korean Cabbage Kimchi known as Baechu Kimchi, it is simply yum... Although Ojingeo (Squid) dishes are also wonderful served with egg drop soup to wash off your spicy sauces, it also quite scrumptious. Since Korean food is very spicy like Indian food so it is easily palatable to Indian taste buds. However, for the sensitives ones to the heat of spices, on request the level of spice can be lowered, when placing the order.

Family Chicken offers great food at a reasonable price. I love the spice chicken and chicken noodles its too too good yaaa with the french fries and burger tastes good as well.I loved the squid stuff damn good food.

this time ordered Kimchi and Kimbap.
Kimchi is a traditional fermented Korean side dish made of vegetables consisting of napa cabbage, radish , scallion , cucumber.
Kimbap also known as seaweed rice. 
Made from steamed white rice and various other ingredients (shredded chicken , egg slice etc) rolled in sheets of laver seaweed. Kimbap was truly amazing.

I always wanted to visit this place ever since I heard its a restaurant run by a Korean family. In quest for authentic Korean food, I finally ended up there and I was pretty impressed by the food out there. The quality is decent, and for that price, the quantity is quite fulfilling. The only thing that probably needs attention is the overall cleanliness of the place.

I've had bibimbap, deopbap, dakdori tang, honeysoya chicken which is extremely sweet. the food is good but the kimchi is quite sour. i definitely want to have the spicy chicken.

I am so glad I found this place, and of course I highly recommend it to oriental food lovers. Now its a sad thing that they thought of positioning this uber cool Korean joint in the middle of salt lake CF block, which is a regular haunt of vegetarians, with spicy, oily, tangy palates (no offense here, it's just about the kind of food that they like). So as a result, this place is now neglected, dilapidated, gradually fading into oblivion...the decor says it all - it's tasteless and ill-maintained. The staff is courteous but look wan and bored (understandably so). There is no brisk business on an average week night. The table-mats are a tacky red green fruit print. If you look carefully you see old utensils and bric-a-brac piled in one corner.

Amidst all this, we settle down and browse the menu. It catches my interest instantly. I decide I want the Hamul Ramyum, the Kimbab, and some spicy chicken. We wait for quite sometime, the ramyum arrives first - piping hot and beautifully flavored, and loaded with squid, octopus, and shrimps...wow!
The Kimbab, I decide, is a cheaper form of Nori rolled sushi, served with sesame soy, you will miss the wasabi if you like japanese. LOL.I tell C that I will carry some in my pocket next time! The spicy chicken was crispy and sweetish, nicely done, a tad ketchupy but OK.
We finish with coffee, and discuss when we are coming next because I want to try everything that is on the menu :)
The price is a bit on the higher side, but you pay that much for the near-exotic experience in salt lake swimming pool area!
Cheers!

I Love this place!! I have been here numerous times and go for the Korean food (Ojingeo Deopbab, Osam Bulgogi, Jeayuk Deopbab, Kimbab, Ramyun & Kimchi Bokumbab) only and I must say it's Fantastic. If you like to try out new cuisines and have a thing for spicy food then Korean cuisine is a Must! The ambience of the restaurant is nice and quiet - perfect for a group of friends to sit, relax and chat over a bowl of hot steaming ramyun. Catchy Korean songs are usually played in the background. The food does take some time to prepare so be ready to wait a while (the dishes are worth the wait). My only suggestion to the restaurant is that they should put Kimchi as a side-dish on the menu.

We had been to Family Chicken (Saltlake) for more than 4-5 times now. It's an excellent spot for Korean dishes and fried chicken. Located very conveniently near Saltlake swimming pool, you can also easily park your vehicle right in front of the eatery on the main road. The place is Wifi enabled and generally on weekdays you will find this place very less crowded. The ambiance is okay along with some good hospitality. Most of the times, when we are here we go for 'Korean style barbecued with squid and pork','rice topped with stir fried squid and vegetables','Mixed Kimchi and rice','Fried Chicken','Spice Chicken'. If you are planning for an evening snacks party then just go for Fried Chicken and Spice Chicken, along with some Coke. According to me - Spice Chicken is an out-of-the-world yet kinda simple dish which you'll not find even in KFC, this dish is very much Korean from the core. The red sauce in which these chicken pieces are dipped is always rightly spiced, it has a beautiful aroma of garlic and it is mild sweet, the sweetness comes from the honey which is added while preparing this sauce. Just one suggestion - The chicken pieces should be hand-picked and it should be noted that every piece should have equal amount of substance in it. Apart from this, try out their Rice plates as mentioned above, along with squid, pork or chicken. Also to mention - the food here is very rightly-priced and very much affordable. I have been eating at this place for 4 years now and they have maintained their quality very well. Hence, a highly recommended spot for all chicken lovers and Korean food fanatics.

It was yesterday afternoon when me and my colleagues bumped into this place, hungry enough to grab few from what this place offers. We hoped in and ordered for Spice Chicken and Chicken Salad. Since spice chicken was unavailable, we ordered for honey chicken. And now we waited.

Food:
Pretty fine, tasty, freshly served and hot. The honey chicken is just another version of KFC's crispy chicken with honey poured on it giving it a sweet taste. They have this three range of crispy chicken - Fried, Spice and Honey. Spicy, masaleydar chicken lovers are highly recommended not at all to order honey chicken. But if flavor is the one to be question, then it is pretty nice with the juicy chicken preserved inside the crispy shell. The chicken salad was also pretty well made. It had the fried chicken mixed with salad veggies and with mayonnaise on it.  Nice food, good price.

Service:
Just okay. I must say, it wasn't that crowded and it took quite a time to prepare the food and come to the table. Also the service of the waiters were bit sloppy  giving a boring gloomy atmosphere despite of the bright daylight. 

Ambiance:
At first appearance it doesn't leave an impression of greatness but enough to enter and eat. Tables , chairs and the cutlery were clean. Properly ventilated and nice music at the background, this place does have few flaws like unnecessary cartoons, cutlery sets, unused desks kept here and there.

Overall, an average place with a slightly above average food that comes quite within the budget.

I wish i could give a lower rating than 1. I can't describe how horrible my experience there was. Reading all the amazing reviews here i went there with my family. I won't comment about the environment as i knew it was gonna be bad. The food was even worse. I ordered the spice chicken which was smelly and had a bad chicken smell. I thought maybe it was how it was supposed to be. So i went over to the next dish which was chicken deopab(i may be wrong with the spelling). It was a dish which can be easily made at home. A very normal dish and the soup was very plain. It had nothing new or different about it. Not up to the mark at all.
And finally I ordered chicken haka chowmein. It was so bad and stinky that we had to return it. They couldn't even give any explanation to why it was bad. They offered something other than noodles but by then we were too disgusted to order anything else.
Only good thing about the place was free wifi.

I haven't been able to bring myself to order from KFC since I've discovered Family Chicken. Their fried chicken is incredible, the best I've ever had. The pieces are smaller than what I was used to, but they're ever so tender and way crispier and more flavourful. Never having eaten Korean food before, I can't vouch for the authenticity of the Korean offerings here, but the pork and pork/squid curries are both excellent. I'm not big on curry-like things, but I could (and do) eat the Osam Bulgogi over and over again. I'm just really glad to have discovered Family Chicken, long may they prosper and never go downhill!

Certainly awesome.

Korean food is like home cooking to me, especially 김치찌개, 닭도리탕 &  오삼 불고기

 Cooked with warmth...when had too much spiced food cool it down with 냉면 (not available in the menu but they make it when you ask for it...this is a specialty in any Korean restaurant worldwide. This is awesome, the spirit of Korean food lives on.)

파이팅!

the ambience is good though it is a korean based restaurant but  we tried something on indian touch.... we ordered friedrice and hyderabadi chicken.. the rice tasted good with adequate moisture content and all the flavors were good n distinct... the hyderabadi chicken was also good but as per the name hyderabadi it was more of a a different touch not the basic india gravy.. the dish tastes good but does not sync with the name.. we both loved the place and its good and even goes easy on pocket..

This is the only place i know of other than Underground- The Hindustan Hotel- that serves authentic Korean Cuisine. The food is simply and unequivocally delicious!!! Unfortunately the service is lack-luster. Also to stay in business they have added a KFC like fast food menu and a basic Chinese menu but those sections serve sub-standard food. What this place needs is a little TLC (Tender Loving Care)- improved decor and place mats(Eesh!! the place-mats have tropical fruits photos ) and a good advertising planner. Rating based on only the Korean Cuisine.

This place is run by a Korean family who have settled in Salt Lake for a while now.They serve Fried chicken in various avatars and Korean food.
I have tried very little of the Korean part of it, only tried their soups and sushi. The latter came wrapped in seaweed, was adequately soft and tasty. The kimchee is really yum though.
Coming to the fried chicken, there are various types which are served. My favourite is the spiced chicken which is a little sticky gravy preparation. The normal fried chicken is similar to KFC, I personally find it to be better in taste and the chicken bits are moist and juicy. The honey chicken is strictly okay, can be tried for treating the taste buds to some variety. 
The ambience is nothing to write home about. It’s a very very homely set up. I like how their coke dispenser is kept in open view, brings a very wholesome American bistro feel. Apart from that, the cleanliness of the place is a bit questionable and I wish for the owners/management to wake up and take note of the discrepancies in this department. 
The staff are friendly enough, however not trained, and you need to ask for stuff like cutlery or sauce from time to time.
Food is good quality in comparison to the price. One would not feel a pocket pinch in this place at all, even though its located near the BF swimming pool, one of the more cooler places to hang out in Salt Lake. 
Not a place to take your date out to though, unless the relationship is stolid ;) Good place to hangout with friends over fried chicken and coke. Did I mention, this place does not have liquor license? Well, it doesn't and I don’t miss it much either. The wholesome food and company of friends have made up for it.

[Edit: I was under the impression this place does not home deliver, but apparently they don't deliver to all parts of Salt Lake. That's a bummer.]

A great place for Korean food. Now there are several very good things about this joint. Parking is a breeze. Moreover the staff are extremely friendly and if you happen to be Korean can speak smattering of your native language as well. 
Coming to the food the menu is an interesting mix of Korean, plain fast food and Chinese (how can a restaurant in Kolkata survive without that option? ). The Chinese I have tried is good but what takes the cake is their korean. The Hamul soup with seafood and handmade flat ramyun takes your breath away. The Osam bulgogi a barbecue dish of rice and pork with squid is sure to make a lasting impression. Their fried chicken section with all three varieties are all time favourites.

If your a KFC fan its the right place for you!!The quality ,quantity and taste is as par with KFC with much lesser pocket pinch.There is nothing great about the ambiance.I only wish that the tables were a bit more clean.
Coming to the food my order was spicy skewered chicken and boneless strips with french fries and coke which costed 295/-. Well pretty pocket friendly!!! The skewered chicken was crispy and spicy.Strips were equally good.

I have heard they serve authentic Korean food.Surely gonna revisit to taste the same.

I frequented the place quite a lot a few years back. We would keep ordering weekly from this place. The Korean Chicken  was amazing. It was fried and sauteed in red sauce and it was sweet as well as spicy. The combination was a marvel. This was back in the days when KFC had not started operations in Kolkata so this was like a monopoly. I really like this place although I haven't been to the place recently. The only thing I do not like is the skin on the chicken but then that is a personal choice. I must recommend this place because it is something that is a must-try.

I initially landed up at Family Chicken because I was a huge KFC fan and I have to admit I was quite nice. We were having a pot-luck evening at a friends place so I ordered both the Fried Chicken and the Spice Chicken and took then across as I had offered to get the non-veg starter. It goes great with a drink and was polished off. Both the regular fried version and the spicy one were tasty and I would grab a takeaway whenever I visited Salt Lake. 
It was thanks be to Zomato that I picked up on the Korean Food it also offers. I had not eaten too much of Korean food before so I decided to try out the Osam Bulgogi ( Korean Styled Barbecued Squid and Pork) . It was quite delicious and I really enjoyed it but spicy. Thereafter tried a couple of the other items like Hamul Ramyun ( Sea Food  ) and the Chicken Deopbab ( Stir Fried Chicken and Vegetables ) which were also quite nice though I found the food to be fairly spicy. My favorite is the Squid and Pork as I love that they have different .textures and makes for an interesting mix of  flavors. Where they fall short however is the hygiene and service .... hope they improve on this front soon as it would be nice to be able to eat in rather than always do a takeaway.

If you want your fill of Korean food in Calcutta at reasonable prices,this place  is a must-try.While it will not leave you satiated with the slightly Indianised preparations,it is quite good.
We tried the Chicken Deopbab, Osam Bulgogi and both of them were excellent.They come with a serving of Clear soup,so each dish is a complete meal by itself.The gravy for the dishes might be a bit spicy wrt chillies- for folks used to bland food,but teamed with the soup the flavors are balanced out. Omlet rice and skewered chicken comes with soup but without any sort of gravy,so you might need a side-dish;the rice is mixed with tomato ketchup and fried,thus it is a bit on the heavier side compared to the  previous two,the skewered chicken is top-notch-soft and juicy on the inside,crunchy outside.
Though we did not go for any other cuisine,we had french fries as a starter and it was better than KFC's as per me and the serving size is filling.All the dishes were consistently good.
There is no ambience to speak of,the background music should better be drowned in the conversational chatter,the place is not spotless clean,the tables are crammed up,the staff is hospitable but decent enough and the service is prompt;though at times it might take a few extra moments to get the staff's attention.
Good food,will revisit for trying out other items.

Excellent restaurant. One of the very few in Kolkata serving real good (maybe not 100% authentic, a little bit indianized) Korean. Tried their bibimbab (korean shushi roll), osam bulgogi (bbq squid and pork with hot sauce toped on rice), ojingeo deopab (stir fried squid and veg topped on rice), hamul ramyun (spicy seafood ramen noodle soup) and crispy fried chicken. Excellent taste in all these, specially the bbq pork and stir fried squid. Seaweed wrapped sushi roll was very good too. Very very friendly and smiling staff. Really worth trying. Highly recommended.

This place is really awesome because of its ambiance, food and price. Went last week for the first time and it was a worth visiting this place. They really have a large menu to choose chicken items ant Italian foods. I didn't find the Italian foods that much efficient but the chicken menu is really a great one. we had spiced chicken which was actually fried chicken tossed in sauce. the chicken pieces were really large and the taste was nothing less than KFC. we also took chicken salad and honey chicken with oyster sauce those items were equally mouthwatering and great value of money. The price is just ok and i can say its much more cheaper than KFC which the food quality is nothing less than KFC. The pocket pinch would not make u worry which is the most enjoyable part of this place even after having such mouthwatering chicken. service is quite ok. a little bit slow but its ok. Free WiFi connection is one more add one of this place. Will certainly visit this place again.

Though the restaurant is quite spacious its not really nice ti sit here and eat since i have found it a bit unclean-dried up curry/sauce on the table. Its fine for takeaways as its a cheaper and,more convenient alternative to KFC since parking is not a problem. Their burgers, chicken wings, fried chicken are almost replica's of KFC but why i often go back here is because of their spicy chicken. That is a must try for all foodies. Their honey chicken,isn't bad either. But i,find nothing really Korean about this place except the man behind the counter. Whenever i have asked for something Korean they say its over- is it a technique or is it really over when im in the mood? Well,that doesn't really matter for i don't expect Korean when i go,there, i expect chicken and i get it. When people come over the spicy chicken really impresses them. If you haven't yet tried it,do try.

i m a resident of Block Ia - I hv a serious complain asto take-out srvce sales persons. Is it ur mngmnt policy to discourage customes by sayg in da bgning of a ph cll that, dlvry cnt take plce if da order isnt over Rs500/ even it is early in da eveng n within SaltLake? To my surprise,a first food place such as urs is dictating that of a high amnt and top of that u also chage for delvry. All da other proper resturants like Abcos dont even dictate that much of minmum amount. Please look into da matter n ask ur personeles not to behve ruly ovr da ph. we all r smhow acuntble for our behavior. I always get food frm u -if i am in town...my family picks up food frm u ...they dnt like to sit inside..reasons r many...impolite staffs cud make a good plce go down.

I have been here quite a few times. It's hard to resist the delectable fast food menu for too long. I havn't tries the Korean here yet but I have heard it's really good. My favourites here are spicy fried chicken- the sauce is yum! and the chicken cheese burger. Boneless chicken strips and popcorn chicken are worth a try too. Very cozy ambiance and has the option of buffet for large parties, provided they are informed beforehand.

Yes the chicken is good, especially the fried chicken w magic sauce which is purportedly better than KFC. But I go there for the Korean. The kimchi soup is the best I've had outside Singapore. For me the trip to Salt Lake is worth it just for the kimchi soup and rice. While they don't have the hot stone bowls the bi bim bap is also interesting especially if you haven't had any in a while

I had pleasant experience with the food from CF-123 branch of Family chicken. Based on that impression, I tried the food from the DLF brach and was majorly dissapointed. To start with, at the DLF branch they do not provide the topping (nut crumbs) which actually was usp for the Spice Chicken. The Chicken quality is not good. The other day I took a Chick Burger Meal, where the burger was ok but the fried chicken was the worst I ever had in my life time so far. The crust was probably over cooked and was giving a burnt taste, also it was so hard, one could barely tear it, much less chew. Over all, it was a disaster.

Extremely Disappointed by the quality and service. We ordered from sector 5 and asked for extra plates/dish. They forget to get the plates/dish. The food was also horrible. Don't find any chicken in the Chicken Manchurian, tastes like Veg (though it is more costly 110/-). Also the Chili Chicken is filled with Soy sauce with no chili. Fried Rice is so so..Overall very disappointed.

Momos were terrible, with thick shells; worst I've ever had, including the frozen ones available in the US. The Chicken Lollipop was microscopic, more like toothpicks, and had (literally) no meat on them. I'm surprised this place is still in business. Extremely disappointed.
