Horrible place. Looks claustrophobic but I did not know their quality of food otherwise I would not have used this place even as a toilet. 
Their peanut masala had live cockroach enjoying itself more than I was enjoying my beer.
The owner (or may have been the manager ) was sitting at the bar. I brought it to his notice but never bothered to even apologise for the sorry state of affairs.
Avoid this place at all cost.

Food was rely bad but yes I liked the crispy chilli baby corn.

A hidden gem, a quaint little pub located in one of the nooks of City Centre 1.. Was looking for some newer alternative when Zomato came up with this suggestion.. However, the location given in Zomato is wrong and we have to call them up to locate the joint.. This place is not big, a few tables with soft couches and few bar stools sums up the place.. The biggest con is that they don’t have any personal washroom which is an essential in a pub and one has to visit the adjacent common washroom of the Mall.. They actually stock a pretty good bar with an interesting and varied array of Dishes ranging from North Indian to Pan Asian cuisine.. The catchy Posters on the wall and the TV screening live matches add to the delight.. Service is attentive and personalized and the server do concede to your personal choices of dishes.. Unfortunately Mojito was not available that day and hence we zeroed down to:

Pepper Fish: Nicely crisped and adequately spiced up.. Lots of peppery presence to complement the alcohol.. Only issue I felt was they topped a supposedly Chinese dish with coriander leaves which kind of makes the flavors confused to my palate..

French Fries: A bit soggy once it cooled down, could have been a little more crispier.. Loved the sauce served with it..

Nasi Goreng: Won’t vouch for the authenticity but the portion was generous and the toppings of sweet corns, fried onions and the poached egg added to the taste making it a delectable affair..

Malaysian Chicken Rendang: Ordered on the server’s recommendation and it truly blended perfectly with the Rice.. Chicken cooked in chilli paste and coconut milk, slight sweetness due to the coconut milk while adequate punch from the chilli.. Again the issue was the presence of coriander leaves..

Alongwith the food we ordered 2 large Royal Challenge, 1 small Absolut, 1 Orange Juice and 1 Sprite to wash down the food.. Had a nice and laid back time there with the soothing background tunes and the sport matches being screened.. One should visit this place to avoid the hustle and bustle of City Centre and enjoy the time in a silent corner but not recommended for family visits.. Our total cheque was Rs. 1559/- (all incl.) for 2 people..

Food: 3/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 3.5/5

Ambiance: 2.5/5

We landed out of nowhere here after searching for ages for Kaafila and well, on a hungry april afternoon, u do not generally regret. 

A couple of beers with vodkaNoodles and chili chicken, well, it was not a bad affair rather.Not may are aware of this location, but for a safe cheap option and that too at city centre, it really is a nice option

Wonderful starters, esp chili pork, chicken tengri(pan fried), mutton liver. Nice cosy place for hangout with friends in City Centre 1. You get most drinks at avery reasonable price and food is also reasonable given that the place is in City centre1.

This is a place I freequently visit nd love comng here evrytym. The liqour is same in which ever bar it is drunk but the speciality of this place is Thai food. The chicken drumstick, fried chicken,exotic chicken, tomium rice, narsegoreng and so on are lovely dishes to be tasted. The food is fresh hence waitng time is little high.

Went to city centre after 4 and since all other resturants were closed we were forced to have our lunch here. I had reservations about this place because of low rating but the food was really good in taste and ambience n decor was nice. But the only drawback was its late service even though the place was empty.

I and my sister were in city centre for some work and it took us so long that it was way past 3...and in the array of restaurants in city centre( most of which closes at 3), we were left with no choice other than this one. Hence we decided on trying this place out. Firstly, it is a very small restaurant and not a very popular one and moreover difficult to locate. The ambience is just about okayish, the place is dimly lit and there is nothing mentionworthy about the decor. The food served to us were just above average, but surprisingly the soup was very good. We started with a sweet corn chicken soup and it was very well prepared and we were quite impressed. For our main couse we opted for mexican fried rice and fish in oyster sauce but both tasted average. I did not enjoy the overindulgence of the garlic flavour in the fried rice, though my sister liked it. But the main shortcoming of the place is their service. We waited for 45 minutes for the soup only and 30 min more for the main courses. It seemed that they had completely forgotten about the order and frankly there were just 3 or 4 other people in the entire place.But one thing good about this place is the behaviour of the staff. Yes, they are a bit sloppy and have no clue regarding their own menu but they have a very warm and welcoming nature. It is for the staff that you do not get irritated with the wait of your food as they keep on apologizing for the delay and honestly you cannot do anything about it. The price of the food is in sync with its quality. In a nutshell, this place is nothing extraordinary and can be given easily a miss as there are much better places serving the same stuff at cheaper prices.

I have visited the DASH at City Centre 1, Salt Lake more than once. The chicken tikka cabab or drums of heaven are simply superb. The starters like crispy chilly baby corn or cpring roll add the spice to it. Above all, are the offers like buy one drink, get one drink free (t &c apply).
One can easily plan a beautiful small party over there for not less than 23-25 people at ease. The location is also nice.

Dash of This and Dash of That...
A small, dark restaurant at City Centre 1 is very suffocating actually. After entering one would want to leave the place as soon as possible coz of it's stingy smell & unwanted ambience. People mostly drops in there for alcoholic drinks I'm sure.
Our attendant Mr Jain, was an extremely polite, attentive & caring person. He took care of very small little needs of ours. I think his gestures really let people wait for the food in that place.
Well, ordered for mixed fried rice, pepper chilli fish, hot and sour soup & semi tossed chicken Manchurian. Soup was good, fish was great, but the rice had the most smelly, rotten prawns of the world. I was at the urge to vomit. Speaking to the manager & chef, who were honestly concerned, gave ear to the complain & cooked afresh. It was good. Overall the food is just about OK but the staff courtesy is something to remember.

Thank You
Anjum Parveen

Although the food is decent here, the experience was pretty average !!

The restaurant gives a desserted feel. Most of the items on menu were not available during my visit. The staff is not as polished though warm. The pricing is reasonable. 

Coming to food, I tried the crispy chilli babycorn which was nice , sweet corn soup that was good too but the hakka noodles were below average. The order was mainly driven by availability rather than choice. 

Overall the restaurant needs a fresh aggressive push in which case it could be a good option for Asian cuisine in city center salt lake. Till then I would rather avoid this place !!!

Last 2 times I went was closed. First I went during Pujas and it was closed (I mean who closes a restaurant during Pujas?????????) . 
Then I went on 28th November 2014 and the shutters were down. Though I couldn't see a notice of closure the shutters were closed.

Can somebody confirm - have I been just unlucky or these guys have shut down.

Its a small , always hustle free space amidst cc1 in the C block , 3rd floor . Good food , solitary corner , calm and quite , where u can seat at some  two seater corner table  and can talk , have foods and drinks . I prefer this place as it is always silent , never ever busy with crowds . Have been there lots of time over last four years and was never disappointed . Always try their teriaki chicken , sauted indonesian fish/chicken , prawn tempura , nasigoren rice , bangkok chicken with basil ,malaysian chicken rendung , singapore chicken with red chilli , thai green and red curries , singapore chili crab , tamarind mint sauted fish and thai spicy prawn with kaffir lime leaves accompanied with some white wine or rum . Each and every item is perfectly justified and ordering an appetizer and one main course is enough to serve two . U can relax and have talk over foods & liquors and no one is going to disturb you there . I highly recommend this place if you are in search of good food and a solitary corner to seat for long .
Costs approx 1600 to 2000 for two .

Last weekend I had pleasant surprise when I hopped into this small place tucked in a corner beside Copper Chimney. The chinese chicken noodles soup was heart warming. Simple flavours, right seasoning, just awesome soulfood. The drums of heaven were a little charred at the edges and a bit of a disappointment but they made it up with crispy chilli baby corns. Nice place to snack and have a small drink. 
The people were courteous but they should reduce their serving time for food and get better chimneys for their kitchen.

Very slow. Cannot timely execute order of a group of more than 4 persons. Waiter loves to lecture guests on how the delay in food being served is because of the way and manner in which the items have been ordered. Finally when food was served, it was of poor quality.

The restaurant needs to change their cook.. they pretend to sell Thai/Malaysian cuisine etc, but I am sure the food was fusion of Indian and Chinese... Eating at roadside vendor will be better option than going here....The people over here do not understand the meaning when you say "moderate to less spicy". The person taking our order was persistent on serving extra rice with the main course when we were looking for a rice+chicken platter dish. Had Thai Green Chicken curry and Malaysian Chicken Redang......both were full of chili paste and little else...will warn people not to risk coming here..
