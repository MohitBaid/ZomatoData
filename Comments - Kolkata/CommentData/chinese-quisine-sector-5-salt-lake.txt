Ordered from this place. Another treat :)
Anyways coming to the food, we ordered :

Chicken Fried Rice - The quantity and the quality was very good. The rice was very tasty and full of veggies.

Chicken with Chilli Oyster Sauce - A very tasty dish, full of shredded chicken pieces. Awesome to taste.

Mushroom Chicken - This was a bit disappointing, as I found this to be a bit bland as compared to the others. Nevertheless, it was full of mushrooms and was good. This also had shredded chicken pieces. 

Veg Manchurian - Surprisingly the star of the show!! The gravy was amazing, and the veg balls were well cooked and soft. 

All the dishes were good, but the special thing is that all were "ajinamoto" free, as a colleague of mine had allergies. So, the staff made all the dishes without ajinamoto. Very tasty food and pretty cheap too. Keep up the good work.

Small eatery located in Sector V. Tried it out during lunch once,  with friends. Had heard good things about it,  and the food lived up to its reputation. It's a very small joint,  with limited seating. We ordered Fried Chicken,  Mixed fried rice and Fish in black oyster sauce. Am pretty choosy about my Chinese,  but I quite liked them all. Would definitely be a favorite while working in Sector V.

I've been to this place many times as it's very near to my office. This is small and cozy space near RS Software.
Pros: Decent quality food, ample quantity  (1 plate easily serves 2, specially for rice dishes), value for money, good ambience, prompt and well behaved staff.
Cons: they don't accept cards, seating area is very small (max 20).

I was hungry and couldn't wait for online delivery. So, I walked down to this Chinese restaurant near my hotel. I ordered Veg fried rice and chicken chilli. The bill was around Rs.300. Both of them were bland. I need to put the pepper and salt multiple times to make it edible. The ambience is just like a typical running restaurant. 
Food- 2/5

So it was a rainy evening and I was enjoying the breezy weather with my family. Suddenly my uncle came up with an idea about a light but yummy dinner. We all were very excited and decided to visit our cozy nook, Chinese Quisine. Chinese Quisine are one of those food outlets where you can make memories and think about those moments after 10 years and instantly smile comes up on your face. It is a really very cozy n comfy chinese food restaurant where you can dine out as well as takeaway the food. It is just a few minutes walk from the Mira Towers. We have ordered gravy veg chowmein, fried chicken, chilly fish and lemongrass mixed soup. They also allows you to customize the dish according to your taste, which did help us to order the best dish for our lil one. The services are so good amd the waiters always put up a smile while serving the food. Overall it is actually a 10 on 10 place. I really like this place. Please do visit over here. üòäüòäüòä

This small little food joint at the heart of Sector V serves tasty chinese food. Their portion for main dishes like Noodles and Rice is amazing given the price. A plate is good for two. We were little disappointed at their service coz half of the items mentioned in the menu was not available. They can always improve upon it.

I barely have any reason to complain. Both the quality and quantity of food here is decent. The staff are courteous. Actually I'm thankful to them for not asking us to leave in spite of how loud we were. 
The price too is pocket friendly. 
We had the crispy chilly baby corn, Hong Kong rice, chicken fried rice, garlic fish and Kung pao chicken. Apart from the Hong Kong rice being perhaps a bit too fried (or maybe that's how it's supposed to be) everything tasted just fine. 
This place is FINE.

My sister and her friend used to work in sector 5 and they often dropped in for lunch at CQ. After having heard so much of that place, visited with them on a weekend. Being a holiday, the place was empty unlike other working days where there's a big queue.
Service was a bit slow inspite of us being the only customers. The staff should've put on the fan or at least, the light for us which he didn't.
I expected the place to be a bit bigger and better but nonetheless I was still excited to try their food.
Ordered a Hot & Sour Chicken Soup, a Mixed Hakka Noodles and Oyster Chicken.
The soup was really good. Full of shredded veggies and chicken.. bursting flavours.. perfectly balanced hot and sour.
The noodles were also good. Oyster Chicken was rightly suggested by my sister. Really good!
Overall, very happy with the food. Not with the service so much.
Definitely recommended! :)

This is the regular Friday lunch- "aaj Baire kothao khabo" place for us.. Its "parar restaurant" so apologies if I was too generous with the rating.. The place is pretty small if you want to go in a big group.. A group of 5/6 is best accommodated. I would still suggest you give them a ring beforehand if you want to go with a bigger party. With the recent renovations done to the look its carrying Kolkata's landmarks all over the walls and pretty clean to give you an idea. Now coming back to food, what is the must have here... They are specialists in the Indian-style Chinese food the Kolkata people simply adore. But.... Do and please do try their awesome fried chicken.. That's a must have.
Also, carry cash with you.. They don't have a swipe machine and they don't accept coupons either.

It's really a great place to visit for your lunch and dinner and also for casual dining. The ambience is not so cozy but quite neat and clean and well maintained. They serve real great Chinese and Thai foot at a very reasonable price. For 4 of us the cost was only 600 bucks and we all had our tummy full. A must try is the gravy noodles and Thai Chicken Rice. I simply loved it and the manager cum waiter cum cashier and all in all is a wonderful person, is always happy to assist. 
The day we went the restaurant was running quite busy and we waited for only 5 mins after we gave the order and it was all served on out table fresh and crisp.

Located at rs software more lane, just beside srijan building. This is a small eatery with very less covers (18 to 20 max). But service is very prompt and excellent hospitality.
We took veg fried rice, veg gravy noodles, chili chicken and fried fish.
Gravy noodles were perfectly cooked with crunchy veggies. Rice was light, with mostly green veggies and chili chicken was soft, flavorsome. Show stealer was fish, fried bhetki sauted in sauces with veggies. That was very fresh and good outstanding in taste. All of this at just rs 490! Seriously this eatery is a hidden gem amongst high tech buildings of sector v.
Ps- the owner is very friendly and hospitable! üòä

Well, I am not a great China food buff, but still, walked into this Chinese restaurant situated nearby the RS Software building @ Sector 5 Saltlake. Place is really small and cramped up ‚Äì with minimal space between 2 tables ‚Äì may be the entire restaurant can accommodate only 12-14 people. Since I was eating out alone, I did not have the luxury of ordering too many items ‚Äì and had to go only for their Hakka noodles (with gravy of course)!

In came a huge surprise for me, a few minutes later ‚Äì when I was served plain noodles topped with boiled vegetables in a China bowl! Those vegetables comprised yellow carrots, some capsicum, spring onions, guar beans and what not. I definitely did not expect such a dish ‚Äì but nevertheless, had to eat this only, to the extent possible. Neither could I eat more than half of what was served, nor, whatever I ate, was tasty!

Ambience of the place is pretty ordinary and service is fine. Prices are low and quantity served is decent. The shortage of staffs is quite evident, with the cashier doing so much of the attendant‚Äôs work!

This small Chinese joint is situated just beside my office. It is a pocket friendly option in the first place. As there are only 3-4 tables it is extremely difficult to get a place during lunch hours. You might even require to share table. Moreover as there are only 2 staffs ,service becomes a bit slow during rush hours.

On my first visit we ordered for chilli babycorn and sweet corn soup as my friend was having veg on that particular day. The combination was perfect which I honestly did not expect. Babycorn was mind blowing.

On the second visit we ordered for Chicken fried rice and Manchurian Chicken. But it was nothing great. So next time we stuck to our favourite baby corn. We even enquired the staff about the recipe of the dish. He was so moved to know about our love for the dish that he eagerly disclosed it without hesitation.

Fried Chicken is also equally tasty which I once got packed for home. Their main expertise is in preparing starters and dry items. Main course is just average.

Overall it is a not so fancy restaurant run by very simple and friendly staffs who are trying hard to give the best of food and service. It is actually a good place to come out from the boredom of office canteen food .Small loose ends here and there can be overlooked keeping in mind the low price that we are paying in return.

This is a small eatery located on the back side of IBM in salt lake sector 5. I have been there quite a few times as the place is cheap.
On one occasion the AC was not working but that wa only once.

Food is nice, certainly not the best but considering price to taste ratio, its pretty decent. One dish which stands out for me is their fried chicken, do try.
One dish that I absolutely dislike is their chili mushroom.

Well am reviewing sitting inside the restro, don't expect an ambience at this price of food. 
But in what I had, crispy chicken, too bad a preparation.(-1/5),yeah negative.
Noodles is like 2/5
Hot garlic chicken is like 3/5. 
Over all....needs to improve on food seriously, but on what they charge its more than fine. 
Advice: Increase the price, don't play with the quality of food(if you are running a restro)

Both rice and noodle is great. Oyster , hot garlic is awesome and in starters drumsticks and fish is really good
It's a must try for people working around salt lake for quality without pinching the pocket.

This place serves good Chinese food in reasonable prices. This is my favourite Chinese take away joints. My favourite from their menu is chicken drumstick, crispy chicken which is a lil more spicy then what some people will like and chicken in oyster sauce. They are generous in quantity. Worth the price you pay for.

Food is too good. A small place. But authentic chiense cuisine as the nane mentions. Grt for take away as less space for seating. Chicken fry is just mouth watering . Also ordered Chilli oyster chicken r singhpur chicken nd fried rice.
2nd review: chicken fry as usual good. Mixed fried rice and hot n sweet fish was a good combination though am nt a fish lover at all.

I stayed in Mahishbathan which is 10 mints away from this restaurant. Today on my mom's birthday I planned to order from this place. I opted for home delivery which they denied!! This is very shocking !! So I drop the idea and ordered from other restaurant.

Visited the place on Sunday in the first week of September. The Chinese they serve is quite good, especially the fried chicken. Though Vegetarian, didn't mind trying one piece and turned out to be real tasty. The quantity is heavy and you won't regret sharing a plate with two. The place is not very spacious. If you are looking for casual dining with friends,you can go for it.

Its ideal for a quick bite, but not worth a visit for a hearty meal. The decor is minimal, and the food average. On our visit we found the fried chicken to be extra spicy so we asked to make the other dishes less spicy. The chili chicken and black bean chicken were both "cholable" but nothing extraordinary. The reasonable rates are in favour, the negligent service not so.

Quality of food- 4.5/5
Communication- 2/5
Delivery- 2.5/5
Price- 2/5

After viewing the reviews in Zomato, me and my friends decided to go with Chinese Quisine on 28th Aug, 2015. We called them at 28th afternoon. The person picked up the phone very rudely said he is unable to talk as he was busy and we have to call after 4 pm. Fine, we called them after 4.30 and he said they can deliver by 1 pm and Zomato is showing higher prices but they won't take that much. He offered lower prices than Zomato shows. We booked the order and next day again we called them to confirm the order. At that time he said a different address of our delivery though we have clearly given him the route map to reach our office. We confirmed him the direction again.

After 1.15 pm I called them up and said we have not yet received the food. He said within 2 mins delivery man will be reached. Again I have call them up at 1.35 pm as he did not reach till then. Still they said by 2 mins you will get the food. After 1.50 pm finally it came with a bill of 542 INR.

I have verified and asked him regarding the increased price he said the menu card in Zomato is a older one and the price increased many days ago. We had to pay 70 INR more than the one the person said over the phone while taking order. It includes Rs. 10 as delivery charge for 2 mins walking distance. Though the quality of food was good still I will not recommend them as they lied. Sorry your service & communication was not at all average.

This was a delivery order this week, that I am rating them on.
We ordered mixed noodles and mixed fried rice.. alongwith chilly chicken and oyster chicken after reading some of the reviews here.
The price is very reasonable..and the food is just yumm!
They provide a good quantity for whatever they charge.
You will absolutely love the noodles. I preferred the oyster chicken ans I felt that the chilly chicken was a somewhat more spicy.
Overall - 3.5 ! 
Will be ordering again :)

Looking for a place to have tasty chinese food but low on budget?? Bang on!!.. Chinese Quisine is the place to be. For starters, fried chicken is the winner. For main course I always go for the conventional mixed noodles. Oyster chicken is a great match! The staff is courteuos and once you visit here you'll be a regular if your workplace is nearby. The quantity is more than enough and its hard to cross 500 bucks for two.

The taste of the food of this place provokes me to order again and again from this place. You can have a pleasing meal at a very reasonable price.

It is situated near RS Software building. Seating arrangement of this place is not so good, barely 20 people can sit but taste-wise very good. For takeaway or ordering Chinese food near my workplace, this place comes into my mind first.

I have tried Fried Chicken, Chicken Chow-min, Chicken Rice, Schezwan Chicken Noodles, Hot Garlic Chicken, Chilly Oyster Chicken. All of these items are good but Chilly Oyster Chicken is my favorite,a must try dish.

Being a "bekar", I am that kind of person who runs out of money through out whole month and if u are the same kind or a food lover who overlook the ambience and focused only on food then this is your place my friend . located near narayan rotary satllake. I order fried chicken. Manchurian chicken and one chicken chow mein  for two of us. All item are very delicious I must say . both quality and quantity are overwhelming . a much recommended eatery . 3 items  cost 400 and ofcours the best part they do not take extra taxes . a well deserving 4.5 from me. Try this place I am sure next time movie in RDB will not be completed without a meal from this small restaurant... Happy eating :)

Crispy chilli babycorn and chicken sweet corn soup is the great combo to start with.. Chicken Manchurian is very tasty and quantity is more than enough.. Hot garlic chicken is ok-ish.. Mix fried rice is good.. For a quick Chinese lunch, this place is perfect..

Some of the best dishes are fried chicken, chicken lollypop ,thai noodles , chicken in oyster sauce, hakka or gravy noodles, fried rice¬† or simply try dry chili chicken. Frankly the list is long!!

If there could be an option to give minus rating then I would have given it in minus. I had heard a lot about this small junction, but never knew there mentality is that much narrow. I was planning a Corporate dinner in my company at DLF2, so for a trial basis we planned to Order from here, but the person, who were taking the order is so unprofessional that literally he misbehaved with me, stating the minimum order details.¬†
I tried to make him understand that its a trial Lunch, which later on will be a Bulk Corporate dinner order, but he sounded adamant. He could have told me gracefully about the details.
One can not be a good entrepreneur until behavior is good. ¬†I would recommend a strict NO for this restaurant and will also discourage my friends.

The place is quite nice.. We had 10 ppls for a lunch treat. So we booked beforehand as they have limited seats. We had fried chicken, fried prawns, fried baby corns as starters. One special fried rice, some mixed fried rice and chow chow rice with some side dishes. So the special fried rice and the starters are too good. Side dishes are so so. So if you plan to arrange a party and have appetite for some great starters. Then this is the place to get it..

Located near Webel and Wipro's office, this place is difficult to find.
But once you reach there you won't have any complaints.

First of all the ambience..its preety good.

Then comes the quality and tastes of their dishes. They surely know how to make good continental dishes.
Try their Singapore Noodles and Chilly Wine chicken. Its their best along with Thai rice chicken noodles.

And the bliss is you are getting all this good continental dishes without paying any taxes for your food.
And the owner of the place is extremely friendly and if you are confused with what to order then he will be surely of much help.
Enjoy :)

One of favourite place for me, and I think for all IT people. Each and every dish is awesome, taste really good. For people of two, you can have one appetiser, one rice/noodles and one side dish, and that should do the job. Service is good, turnaround time is pretty less. Overall, if you are in sector 5, you should visit once. Note :  only 4 tables are there, so if you are going on Friday, expect a long queue.

This is probably the restuarant where i have paid max no. of visits considering my entire lifespan :) .... being within walking distance from my ofc, i pay it a visit once every week , and have been doing it for several months now .... 
Not very spacious inside .... though 18 heads max can be accomodated at a time but the space inside is a bit congested .... ambience slightly below par from that of a standard restuarant ... one AC is there but droplets of water spill out of it from time to time (though very rare) :) ...... but all these factors take a back seat when food quality and pricing come into the picture ..... quality is quite good .... my fav item is Fried Chicken .... chicken drumstick is also nice .... in main course i normally eat mixed fried rice ....mixed chilli garlic noodles ... and oyster chicken .... have tried other items as well like manchurian chicken , mixed noodles with gravy etc ..... 
Pricing is its another USP ....quantity is also very good .... two plates of rice would suffice three people on an avg ( though for big foodies like me, one plate is req :) ) ,.....
A decent option if u r looking for standard quality chinese food at an economical rate .... 
The chief person who manages everything , has no concern of zomato ratings :P ...he is not at all bothered or interested to talk about that ... acc to him he maintains a good professional relationship with his customers which contributes to lure them to visit the restuarant from time to time .... :)

My daughters and I have gone there twice. Once to dine in and the next time we did a take away. You can tell that I liked the food the first time hence I came back. They have a good menu and food was tasty. I would recommend the Chicken with Oyster Sauce and the Fried fish.¬†
When we dined in, the quantity was sufficient. The next time when I did a takeaway the quantity of Chowmein was really less. In fact to be frank, I have never seen any restaurant pack so little, it was barely enough for one. They also charged me for a foil pack but on returning home I found it to be a regular paper pack which was very badly packed. Luckily I live close by and the damage was not too bad.
I will probably go back as the food tasted great, but I will probably remind them of the quantity and packing.
Minor Points: They do not take credit cards. And the owner talks too loudly in the phone and for a small restaurant as that, that was really disturbing.

I ended up visiting this place with a few friends because everything else around was closed. Its a very small place, and very easy to miss. We didn't even expect the food to be average. But was very pleasantly surprised. The decor is very basic. The staff was helpful, and suggested what to order. We went with his suggestion. The food arrived real quick, within 15 mins. And the food was delicious. You can try their fried chicken for starter, really spicy and leaves one wanting for more. The fried rice was equally good. The food & service is awesome, more so because it is very very easy on the pocket. Would love to visit again.

We had been to this place couple of days back for a quick lunch. It has got a prime location at Sector 5, quite close to the RS Software building. The place is very cramped and you can better go for take-aways or home deliveries. It has got 4 tables placed very close together and has a total seating capacity for 18 people. 

The service time, reasonable price and food - all three are really good here and should bring you back to this place for more. Last time we had ordered for - 

a) Fried Chicken: One plate has got eight pieces, maybe the best appetizer you can get at this joint, the chicken pieces are well marinated, juicy and very well prepared. Really a great dish to try out.

b) Chicken in black bean sauce: This dish was unexpectedly delicious! Never thought this kind of flavour and aroma can be generated from such a regular Indianized chinese food joint. The dish has got sliced chicken pieces, very apt for sharing with couple of friends as a side dish. Again a must try.

c) Veg Singapore noodles & Veg Schezwan noodles: Both these hakka noodles were well prepared, the Singapore one being a bit more spicy. Has got freshly diced veggies and is served in very good quantity. One plate can serve two.

d) Chicken gravy noodles: Another amazing dish to be very true, maybe I've never tasted a better gravy noodles at any other such regular budget joints. Maybe the portion of cornflower can be bit optimized to make the gravy a bit more amazing! The veggies in there were rightly diced and were very fresh. A must try dish if you are here.

Now time to mention some areas of improvement - Apart from cramped seating the customer handling should be improved at this joint. The guy who is in-charge of this place tries to be over-friendly with people but basically lacks courtesy. He practices unpolished customer handling, which is surely a big let-down according to me, and might restrict me from visiting this place again atleast for having my food there, I might still opt for take-aways or home-delivery since the food is basically great and praise-worthy!   

Cheers!

Location:¬† A stone's throw from Wipro building; In the lane adjacent to RS Software Building.

Three hungry souls standing near the City Centre Mall, thinking of a place to visit but, far from the hustle & bustle of the city yet, tummy filling food and not the caf√©-type fare (as a result of a bad experience at a cafe a few minutes back). Suddenly, one out of them recalled an old recommendation and the three headed towards Chinese Quisine after which they thought of hitting to a nearby hookah parlor to chill for a couple of hours. This place was visited on a recommendation by a fellow colleague (of the friend who recommended us) who has been swearing by the quality of the non-vegetarian fare served here.
And, here the souls were standing in front of the restaurant famished out of hunger at 13:45 hours. The restaurant was quite a small one and as they entered, the AMBIANCE was found to be non-descriptive with just table-chairs as seating arrangements for twenty-five heads approximately.
Warmly welcomed and seated, the hungry souls looked through the menu and ORDERED the following:

- Hakka Noodles (Veg)
The perfectly boiled noodles wok-tossed in a street-style indianized manner along with fresh veggies, soy sauce and spot on seasoning. Tasted good.

- Veg. Manchurian [8 pieces]
The dumplings had a flavorful filling but, slightly low on salt, manageable. The Manchurian sauce was flavorful but, the vinegar level was slightly on the higher side giving it a slightly sour taste.
Tasted decent, can be improved in terms of flavor. 

‚Ä¢ A single portion could easily fill three tummies of medium appetite/two high appetite tummies.

The STAFF was friendly and the SERVICE was quick.
PRICES were found to be pocket-friendly.

‚Ä¢ The broken condiment containers are requested to be replaced by new ones; poses a health hazard to the customers.

Overall a decent experience.

This is located just next to our office and looking at the place, one can never imagine it can deliver such courteous staff, such amazing food. The staff gives that extra to make you feel comfortable and couple that with the tasty and delightful food, you end up thinking when again you are having lunch here. Considering it is a small place, you will have to wait for a place, but you will only mind it if it is your first time. Give it a try once and you will thank me. Would have given more rating, but comparing it with others they score on food and service but lose on ambience.

On reading good reviews decided to visit this place after college one day. We ordered a veg manchurian and I totally loved it. Then we called for a non veg thai rice which was very mediocre, I did not like the quality of the rice. For side dish we had a hot garlic chicken which was decent. It's a very small joint which needs to maintain hygiene.

My favoritest Sector 5 Chinese is this, and here's why:

1) Almost always open, I have been here at 11 in the morning, and 12 in the night.
2) Decent takeaway and dine in service (with AC).
3) Very awesome Indianised Chinese - every Bengali palate's dream chilly chicken and fried rice served here.
4) If you want variety, order exotic like Oyster Chicken or Chicken is Black Bean Sauce - yes they are awesome too!
5) Very filling, wholesome noodles, monster-sized helpings (please try mixed gravy chow).
6) You get coke, mineral water and lime-soda. What more?
7) Very pocket-friendly. Keep cash handy. Though they do accept cards...makes em awesome, right?
8) Accessibly located, right behind Millennium City, beside RS Software and TCS.
9) Good IT and College crowd
10) 'Nuff said. Go try! My verdict is Rank # 1 in Salt Lake :)

Small joint with a cosy atmosphere,as the name implies this place serves only chinese food. Well working air conditioner facilitated for customers during summer days. Most of their items are pretty good,and my personal favourite from here is the Szechwan chicken. Quality and quantity are remarkable considering the price you have to pay. Only one complaint i have regarding this place is the utmost indecent behaviour of the manager. May be they have two managers because the first day i visited this place during pujas the manager was really welcoming and hospitable to us. But the 2nd day here really made me mad. The manager was someone else again and he was so rude in his behaviour. I only have one suggestion for the manager,if you continue like this you would end up scaring away customers and it would finally and very quickly lead to the downfall of your business. If i don't take into consideration the behaviour,this place gets a 4.5 from me!

Visited last night when I was returning from a terrible competitive exam and I was very very hungry. This place caught my eye and I went there not knowing I was in for a surprise.
The place is small but let not that veil its great food quality. Yes , the food was great and it subdued my apetite . The guys served without wasting too much of my time. But be sure not to repeat my mistake ,that is : do bring in a partner as a single dish served here are enough to fill the stomach of two full grown persons.
I ordered crispy chilli baby corn,prawn fried rice, got garlic chicken. Every item tasted peachy. While returning,it wasn't the hunger that remained, it was desire,to come here again.
The only glitch remains though is that the place is very small.

Good chinese food and pocket friendly.One of the best chinese restaurant in Sec 5.

First of all,I must point out the minus points.One of them is it doesn't accept cards whether debit/credit,doesn't accept Sodexo,so only option to pay is cash.Second is the place is really small,in rush hour you have to wait outside of the restaurant which is not much comfortable.Last one is,most of the times some 'not so common' dishes remain unavailable.

Now,I should highlight the positive sides which are good food and the price.
I had visited this place couple of times and never been disappointed by their quality of foods.I had tried fried chicken as starter which was awesome,just awesome.In main course,I had tried chinese cuisine special fried rice,chicken chowmin,chilli chicken,chilli oyester chicken.Cuisine special rice was well cooked,well presented.Chowmin and chillli chicken is more than average.Chilli Oyester Chicken was not so good in taste.

Ambiance is very basic and staffs are ok.

Bottom Line:¬† must visit place for chinese lovers in Sec 5

It's one of my fav place as very near to my office. Food quality is amazing, very cheap. U can afford for your lunch or dinner in office. Chicken with oyster sauce and crispy chicken these 2 are my fav. Schezwan rice or noddles both are good for main course. They do deliver within Sector v which is more usefull while a busy day

I have heard a lot about this place from my colleagues, so today decided to visit there during lunch. take the road beside RS software, go straight and the restaurant should be on the left side. first of all, the place is very small and clumsy, gaps between the chairs is very less. there is nothing to say much about ambience, very normal. the added point is they have AC. the staffs are fine, mainly the manager, he actually interacts with every customer.

Now regarding food, i have tried fried chicken in starter along with chicken / prawn fried rice and schezwan chicken, chilli oyestar fish. out of them the fish and the fried chicken are very good. schezwan chicken was fine. for fried rice, they don't use the proper chawal, but it's ok to have.

the main negative points that i found are:
1. they do not accept cards.
2. you won't get all the items present in their menucard like we ordered for chilli wine fish, but they didn't prepare that.

considering above these points, the rating should not cross 3. but one point we should not forget that this place is not a typical chinese restaurant, so it cannot be compared with them. this is also a hangout for college students. hence, the price range is very pocket friendly. according to price their quality is worthy. so, i am increasing my rating 0.5 for that. i should recommend this place for at least one visit...

Good Chinese food...if ur looking for authentic Chinese then its not the place however if you want to have Indian Chinese it makes tasty food.
Must Try : Fried Chicken , Chicken Gravy Chowmein and Chicken with vegetables.

One downside they don't serve pork so if you are ordering for anything mixed you will not get pork but if u r lucky u might get prawn if they have stock.

Pocket Pinch : Rs800 for Lunch for 4 people with cold drinks

I nice little place where you can get a dash of Indo Chinese food when at work. This was my first visit to the restaurant though i heard about it couple of time from friends who work here. My friend is a regular so she took me here today. We ordered fried fish, egg hakka noodles and oyster chicken. the food was good compared to the ambience it has. Mr. Ashish¬† is the manager of this place and i must give him a thumbs up for his customer service. A very cordial person who is aware of his customers likes and dislikes. I really enjoyed the food here on a Friday afternoon. The rates are also pretty reasonable. You can also order for office delivery and trust me the place is small but nevertheless very clean and well maintained. Next time you want to try chinese food do step in here.

his is a very small restaurant without much footfall. There only one waiter who is also the cashier. The restaurant is not decorated at all instead it is shabby. It is an ac restaurant but the ac will be switched on only when there is a customer. In rainy days or in winters they don't switch on the ac. 
But the food served wins heart. Quantity and quality of food is very good. Taste is fabulous. Most importantly it is reasonable.
This place is not meant for a family dine in but for office goes to have their lunch or some snacks.

An impromptu decision led us to this small unnoticed place near offices of Wipro and TCS. At first when you enter the restaurant you will notice that it is very small and maybe not upto your expectations. However, please wait until you order as the food makes up for everything that is lacking. Best Chinese served and within your budget. After the first experience, it has now become a regular part in our addas and it continues to give good food.

This not so known restaurant (among non Sec V people) is a surprise package. The place may look unconvincing but it can easily make some big names run for their money. The quality n quantity of the servings r exceptional. I won't say the taste is as authentic as mainland China but it is high enough to make you an ardent devotee of Chinise Cuisine. This place will fall into the set of restaurants serving high quality but economical food. Last but not the least all the staffs here are simple but highly courteous with special mentioning of ever smiling ASHISH DA

My Picks: Chckn Clear/Hot n Sour Soup, Dry Chilli Mashroom/Chckn, Fried Chckn, Dry Chckn wid Vegtbles (my favrte), oyester chckn, chilli chckn gravy, Singapore noodles, fried prawn/fish
P.S: if not sure what to have just let Ashish Da know what U like to eat (fish/poultry/prawn) - be assured U would love it

Went after office for impressing my taste buds with one of my colleagues. The food we ordered were as follows:

1. Fried Chicken(dry Starter)- The person taking the order recommended this dish and it was really good. I must say it is recommended to taste when you come to this restaurant.

2. Mixed fried rice- The quantity of the rice was quite well. The taste of the chicken pieces in the rice was good but the shrimps were totally tasteless. It tasted like it was chewing gum. Overall it would have been better if I ordered for Chicken Fried Rice.

3. Hot Garlic Chicken- The dish was a bit spicy. It was quite ordinary but the spicyness was a quite good blend with the rice we ordered.

Overall i would give a 3/5 for food and 4/5 for service.

thank you zomato for introducing me to this lovely little place. not much in terms of space and obviously no marks for decor, the food steals away the show. awesome chinese cuisine at very afordable price, the quantity served is more than sufficient for two adults per plate of any dish. i loved their crispy chilli babycorn and fried chicken the most. many a good restaurants cannot make proper crispy chilli babycorn.they somewhat lack on the crispy.but this one was perfect. the hong kong rice was a bit dry but the yummy chicken in oyster sauce made up for it. they should start accepting cards soon. the place is easy to locate. it is just behind  wipro infront 
National research institute of ayurvedic drug development's building.

I was introduced to this place behind Wipro near Aajkaal office by a friend, M, who treated us to food way back in 2008. Although small and quaint, the food here is excellent and that is the primary reason for me to return. Since then, I have visited this place a few times, and always found the food to be tasty, and in big quantities. Recently, we packed food from here. Our menu was simple - chicken fried rice, chicken pakora, Mixed Szechwan Noodles hakka, Hot garlic chicken and chilly fish. The food was packed and ready to go in 20 minutes and we appreciated it a lot since we were in a hurry. Everything was packed well, and the taste was fantastic. Total value for money since our meal cost us somewhere in the vicinity of 600/- for a meal of four very happy and stuffed people. I want to get more starters the next time since the Chicken Pakora was absolutely divine.

This is a small restaurant tugged in one of the lanes of Sector V and not many people know about it. We went there for lunch today. There were 7 of us. 
The first impression you will get when you see the restaurant is that it is very small and the space is cramped. Interiors are very plain. At a time maximum of 18 people can fit in and dine. They have Air Conditioning facility though. You have to carry cash as they don't accept cards(that is what we gathered although here in zomato I see cards as accepted).

Since we were there for the first time, we had to scan through the menu and order. This took some time. The waiter seemed impatient and repeatedly told us to hurry up and decide. He also asked us to order starters and main course all at one go. As per him, if we separately ordered, it is going to take a lot of time. This immediately needs improvement.

We ordered the following:
Starters - 
1) Crispy Chilli Babycorn - Rs 95/-
2) Fried Fish - Rs 120/-
Main Course - 
1) Mixed Fried Rice - Rs 100/-
2) Mixed chowmein - Rs 100/-
3) Chilli Oyster Chicken - Rs 140/-
4) Sweet & Sour Chicken - Rs 120/-
5) Szechuan Chicken - Rs 120/-

The taste of the food was excellant. In fact, some of us commented that this was far more tasty than what is served at China Town and I tend to agree. The quantity was sufficient and the cost very reasonable.

So if you looking for really tasty chinese food at very reasonable price, this is the place to go. Not suitable for large groups.

Food is good but an over enthusiastic owner will ensure you hurry through your lunch!Place is really small and often other groups are asked to share a table which can be really uncomfotable.
Chicken sweet corn soup, kung pao chicken and fried rice are good.

The place is quite small.


Our order fried chicken,Thai mixed rice and chicken in Oyester sauce.

Fried chicken was spicy and tangy good to taste. .

Thai rice was quite good both quantity and taste wise.what i loved is chicken in oyester sauce.A dish which can really compete with the biggies in the town.

would love to re-visit for exploring the other items on the menu.
A place truly value for money.

Now this is a food joint I visit practically everyday for a mid day munch...it is a quiet and dim lit restaurant with a very reasonable price list and a very warm staff.. 

I love all the dishes here and have eaten quite a variety.. starting from chicken drumsticks, chilly chicken, chicken with mushroom, garlic chicken, hot and sweet chicken, fried chicken-- the dishes are prepared very very well..

 Also the place is so small that we sometimes go for office team outings there or maybe even order food from there as they deliver it to our office which is like just a few steps away..

Overall, its a superb place to eat in!!

One of the most under-hyped restaurants of the city.. and they can give several other famous chinese restaurants a run for thir money.. just by their quality of food, and value for money!

I have tried almost all the items in their chinese platter and was overwhelmed every time I must say!

I can go over this place on a daily basis for their Fried Fish/Chicken.. the dish is jus superb! awesomely spiced and amazingly portioned! My other favourites are - Chicken in Oyester sauce and Chicken in Wine Sauce! I actually get the best Chicken in Oyester sauce in town at this place..!

Their Chicken Chowmein hakka/gravy, Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Chopsuey everything is correctly portioned and super-tasty!

I have also tried their Chicken drumsticks and some other snacks also.. and never got disappointed!

Their service is superbly prompt.. they have delivered me the food at my place within 15-20 mins of ordering,each time! Even if having the food sitting there, they provide a very prompt as well as good service..  

I dnt know how they provide such quality food in such a low price... I always love the full-on-stomach-low-on-pocket feeling!! It has never exceeded 200/- per head even if I have eaten to this extent that I had to skip my next meal!

I have to mention about the owner of the joint.. Mr. Ashish.. he is the most energetic owner of a restaurant I have ever seen! I have even seen him serving food to the customer in case the other waiters are busy with some other customers..

They need to make the place bigger.. and they can be the best chinese food joint in the whole north kolkata i believe!

Thumbs up for their service and quality!
A full 5/5 for them!

This must be the most underrated restaurant in town. A small place, can hardly seat 15 people (at these prices one cannot really expect fancy interiors). But the quality of food is just awesome, on par with what its much fancier cousins at Mainland China or Tung Fong has to offer (of course at 1/3 or 1/4 the price). They will either use ingredients of the highest quality or won't serve the dish at all. I have been there dozens of times, tasted almost all the items on their menu and was NEVER disappointed. I strongly recommend Chicken in black bean sauce or wine sauce (when available). Conclusion: this restaurant offers a GREAT value for money.
