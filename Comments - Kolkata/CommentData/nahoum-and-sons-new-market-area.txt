Got an opportunity to try one of their items for ages finally got a chance when someone gave me a slice of pudding on first bite itself I could decipher that it is one of the best plum flavours I ever had in this city.Later enquired about it and came to know that it is their Plum Pudding,which tasted near about perfect,i.e how a plum pudding should be.Would definitely like to try more of their items in the near future

The iconic Nahoum’s is a bakery one must not miss when visiting Kolkata. Located in the heart of new market , this bakery is always full of people and their products are sold out pretty soon. We had their Black Forest cake , which was amazing as it oozes out a rich cherry syrup , the rum ball , which actually tasted like rum and was filling , and the chocolate glappe, which was sandwich pastry where two biscuits enclosed a peanut and chocolate mixture. 
They have a great variety of breads also, so much that the entire place smells of bread. They even sell crackers , cookies , peppermints and fudge. Their chocolate fudge is to die for. Their puffs and patties are good too.

Well I am a fan of their fruit cake.. For a change I tried brownie and cheese cake.. Brownie was superb.. Bt didnt like the sugar particles on the Cheese cake.. Otherwise the inside of the Cheese cake was so soft and flavoured too..

Nahoums needs no introduction to every Calcutta Lover and this place won't disappoint you. We had a Cheese Patties, Veg Pizza, Rum Ball & Chocolate Pastry.They all tasted amazing. Though their Garlic Bread is equally good but I missed out as we went out in the evening. Overall a nice experience!!!

Nahoums make an intrinsic part of a fulfilling Christmas experience in Kolkata. They are famous for their irresistible "rich fruit cakes and plum cakes " which over the decades have remained marvelous. The rich fruit cake is one of the best in town and they remain fresh even after several days if stored in air tight containers. Other delicious cakes are their signature heart cakes and the lemon puffs. I have been a fan of their non-cream food items mostly. The shop located at the heart of new market is age old with antique decor but the staff are very helpful. When in Kolkata, visit to Nahoum is a must!

Loved the rich fruit cake. It was gooey, yummy, delicious & over the top! Each bite was laden with fruit chunks, walnut & was so chocolatey. One should experience it's taste to know why it is regarded as an iconic dessert house of Calcutta.

It's not a review, it's an innocent expression of sheer happiness and joy which we evoke after pampering ourselves with the goodies, offered by this legendary bakery. 
Well, its more than just a bakery though. Nahoums has witnessed the sweet and bitter times of the city of joy, the transition from Calcutta to Kolkata, the revamp of New Market, the nearby flyovers, the city's sudden love for London and so on. So it is in our genes to have at least a slice of the rich fruit cake here. The madeira cake, the envious varieties of plum cakes, pineapple pudding - We have all grown with these culinary treasures!

Fruit cakes,new year weekend and nahoums can be a synonym for themselves. The place is situated inside the confusing lanes of Hogg market. It was filled with people trying to get a hand on their pastries and savouries. When we reached the savouries were exhausted,but we had chocolate strawberry pastry, jam tart cream rolls and heart cakes. Apart from cream roll, everything thing was pure,simple and fresh. The highlight was the heart shape cake,which leaves a longing taste in your mouth. All the items were priced @30 bucks each. The reason why they are so famous is because they keep things simple and easy. It's a must visit if someone wants geniune old school pastry and cakes.

Well Nahoum for me is nostalgia. And it runs in the blood. Our family has been Nahoum loyalist for ages and i am no different. This place truly is legendary. Specially the “Rich Fruit Cake” that they serve is, simply put, out of the world. Have never tasted a better cake than that. This place is a must visit, specially if you want to immerse yourself with the taste of the old colonnial setting.

One of the most oldest cake shops in Kolkata.Christmas is simply incomplete without Nahoum's.Don't judge them by their century old furniture or old style glass displays.Their famous offerings are Plum cake and Rich Dry Fruit cake.Also you must try their chicken mayonnaise patties,eclairs pastry,brownie,lemon tart,chicken puff,brownie etc. This is Kolkata's last Jewish Bakery.They are serving consistently since 1902.The shop later was moved to its present location in 1916.

Nahoums, one of the best plum and fruit cake  selling shops and very much eternal to kolkata. The food taste and quality is bang on. But what they are behind is customer service. The staff over their do not know how to talk to people. They show attitude as if they are doing a great thing by serving us. There is a lady who handles one of the counters she is so rude that one cannot even think of. The other persons who handle other section they do not have  coordination amongst themselves. It was very crowded, two staff almost collided with each other and by chance hurt a customer, none of them bothered to apologise with that person. The owners and the management team of nahoum must realise that the staff has to be trsined and be more friendly. Just because its one of the authentic cake shops that does not mean they will treat like this. I guess I am the 1st person to give such rave reviews about Nahoum because inspite of such behavious people stand in queue to buy cakes from Nahoums. But one must remember that polite behaviour is also very important. Your product can be good but if your service is trash. I can only say being a calcuttan I will discourage everyone to visit Nahoum. I would be really glad if Nahoum takes my review seriously and take actions to change itself. 

Thank You.

Hooray, first review! This was a most rewarding visit, my second one overall and the first one in a few years, and I will certainly keep going back there for the rest of my life. The magnetising aroma the store emanates is hard to erase even after one has passed the adjoining area that veritably reeks, and the memory of the store is an abidingly sweet one, much like the taste of the various treats on offer there. Locating the store, once inside New Market, is markedly straightforward. Anyone and everyone there will be able to direct you to it should you not be able to locate it yourself. I was there with my sister; I had a chocolate pastry, and it was quite a knockout. The sweetness was just right. My sister tried the same. I alone had a lemon puff within which was a gooey and lemony mixture of utter perfection, and we carried home a Special Fruit Cake, and that was also quite exquisite. The establishment is old world and charming and can get slightly crowded during peak hours or during the peak season, but it's worth it. All in all, it was nearly a five star experience, and one I would highly recommend to everyone with a sweet tooth and, indeed, teeth of any kind, and one I would definitely like to undergo numerous times in the years to come.

Heritage bakery of kolkata. New market and nahoum have always been synonymous. If you visit new market you got to step your foot in at nahoum,thats almost like a ritual. For me there have been days when i have visited new market with a strong mindset to not visit nahoum but once i pass by this shop and the smell of those hot bakes fill in my nerves,thats it i cant help myself anymore and end up eating something or the other.
I have tried quite a few of their patties,pastries as well as plum cake and the famous christmas fruit cake. The freshness of the fillings and the cream tells a lot. I have a special thing for their rum ball,eclair and chicken patties. Everytime i visit them i make sure that i atleast have one of these. Have also tried their cookies and brownie.
Bakeries may come and go...they may do whatever new and innovative they want...but calcuttans will always love their nahoum.

Nahoum's and Kolkata are synonymous. Period. The smell of cakes and biscuits with the old world charm transforms this particular alley inside SS Hogg Market to a whole new level. Their pastries are all amazing in taste, be it chocolate pineapple or strawberry. I personally am not a huge fan of their savouries, but trust the cake they make with your eyes closed. This is on the christmas go to place for few years, and the queues and the taste never comes down. Happy Caking!! 😁

Thank you Nahoum so much for making my boring tiffin tastier. Been a regular customer of this place since a long time back and I am quite satiated with their bakery products. 

Tasted too many items from this place and the list is really long - 

Chocolate Fudge, Chocolate Cake, Lemon Tarts, Baklava, Rich Fruit Cake, Chocolate Brownie,Pineapple Pudding, Walnut Cake, Chicken Patty, Chicken Puff. 

Compared to other joints like Kookie Jar, French Loaf, Cakes this place is way too old and has not been rejuvenated much in terms of decor. And Nahoum still bear that vintage look and is always filled with that wonderful aroma of cakes. Their products are always fresh and the best part is the taste is that same, hasn't changed a bit all through these years! 

And the items are really affordable. Service is awesome. Great job doing N&S!

This is a must go if you are in the City of Joy 😊. This is the city's last remaining of the Jewish Heritage which occured around 18 to mid 20's. Their speciality  fruit cakes , fudges, lemon tarts, eclair, handmade biscuits, breads, etc...are the same sugary treats passed down through family recipes😁. The Jewish Cheese Sambusak (commonly called Chase samosa by the locals is to be tried. I like their chicken parties the best👍.. the filling is awesome 💖.

Nahoum's has been my go to place for satisfying my sweet tooth whenever I'm in New Market. It is true that the bakery is shabby and hasn't upped it's game in terms of decor or aesthetic appeal . However they have also kept their prices at a moderate level , a big plus . Their cakes and bakes are freshly made and have an old world charm. The bakery is kept neat and tidy. Their USP is that their taste has never changed and that is what drags me back to them more . Their Christmas fruit cake , black forest cake , brownies, chocolate cake , and strawberry cake are heavily loaded with goodness and taste . One cannot compare it's taste with other bakeries. It is unique and will always remain so. Hope they continue serving hungry Kolkatans for decades to come. :)

Nahoum's doesn't need any intro, do they?
chocolate and Strawberry pastries are my all time favorite.
Buns and Breads are also ❤
This place is my favorite, I try to visit this place whenever I go to Newmarket :)

Being one of the oldest shops in Kolkata, this place is imbued with the smell of a very long history. It bakes exquisite pastry, cake, bread and biscuits. Lemon puff and lemon tart, almond tart, sweet bun, date biscuits are some of their best products. Nahoum is a name with which many of us has an emotional bonding since it brings back many childhood memories.

I've never really been a fan of the new market area mostly because of the crowd but would make a sacrifice just to visit this small and legendary bakery which is a paradise for cake and pastry lovers. And it's buzzing with people all throughout the year.

This place is difficult to locate for someone like me who's not a regular to this place, but anyone can give you the directions to this very popular shop if you don't have access to google maps.

Their chocolate and lemon tarts are nothing short of amazing. The rumballs are a bit too sweet but not complaining. The chicken puffs taste amazing too. 

Lastly, this place is super pocket friendly. So if you are out there shopping and need something to munch on, this place is definitely worth a visit :)

What could have  been a  better way to start your puja shopping with a Brakefast at Legendary Nahoum & Sons.
This place at the Heart of the city, Newmarket, is pure nostalgia.

We had
1.Tuna Sandwich
2.Chicken puff
3. Lemon puff.
4.Brownie


Tuna sandwich was awesome,bit spicy, I loved it.
Chicekn puff was flaky puff stuffed with chicken minced taste awesome.

But their Lemon puff and Brownies are just Devine.
You just have to take some time to embrace the awesomeness of these two.

Things you should also try in Nahoum
Chess puff, minced puff ( mince of dried fruits, nuts , raisins), chicken Singra, Run and rains cake

This is a very old traditional bakery shop of Calcutta ! Some 150 years old. Whenever I used to go shopping with my parents during the pujo,never missed a change to get in and have a bite. The prices of the pastries are very reasonable and product is of high quality! Pure vintage! You get all types of bakery products from pastries to biscuits !

Forget everything else. If you are in the neighborhood, run to grab the chocolate brownie sold here at the price of rupees 40. The brownie isn't goey. It is just the right amount dry with enough nuts to keep you engaged until the end and the texture of the brownie and it's taste is just too good.

This is nowhere near the amazing bakery that it's reputed to be. And I say with due respect to the lineage it follows. I feel it's that, and not the current produce it offers that makes it so highly spoken about and rated. 
As a test I tried all the delicious things that it is known for - the lemon tart, chicken patty, the cookies or biscuits, and it's revered Eclair. 
I have been exposed to old institutions like the German Bakery, Kayani's, Standard and Ellora's. I consider myself a good meter for breads, biscuits , English desserts and the like. 
Nahoum and Sons does not match up. They might be good. But they are not great.

Went to this place as a part of our monthly foodwalk. The items lined up were so many and so delicious looking, we could only taste few:
Chocolate Pastry - 4.5/5
Strawberry pastry - 4.5/5
Brownie - 5/5
Egg Chop - 5/5 
Fish pantras - 4.5/5

Will visit again to try other varieties since they are good and affordable group of confectioners.

Hola peeps!!
.
.
.
This hidden gem was on my bucket list for the longest period of time but now finally I am ticking it off. All thanks to my sweetheart and an impromptu trip to Puri.
.
.
Nahoums can be a little tricky to locate as it is inside Hogg market complex. But you can simply remember the store number and can ask anyone inside the complex. They will give you the exact location and directions of the store.
.
.
There are no seating arrangements inside the store. Being a very old place, this has ample place in it to stand and eat your food. You can even pack your food and pastries and leave which I feel is a better option. The staffs are actually really mechanical and just are doing their work. No smiling faces to greet you! :(
.
.
The place has one of the best bakery items in town. They have a huge collection of cakes and pastries with so many puffs and patties. Even different kinds of breads are there which you can take along and prepare your own creation.
.
.
We had Chicken Puff, lemon tart, jam tart, chocolate tart and black forest cake. The pictures got deleted but I will post them the next time I land there. Pakka!!
.
.
Chicken puff was the best among the lot. The amount of chicken filling was too good. I have tasted different bakeries in Kolkata but I found it among the best. Soft and melts into the mouth like a dream, what more to ask for?
.
.
Lemon tart was a little too sour for my preference and so I found it quite an average one.
.
.
Chocolate tart was for my friend who told that it is really yummy and he liked it a lot.
.
.
Jam treat was really a hit for me. Though I found it quite simple, it was tasty which was enough for me.
.
.
The Blackforest cake stole the show among the sweets as it was mouth watering yet was not full of cream like other stores offer. I hate that excessive creamy top layer over cakes and so this blackforest cake was like a breeze of relief for me. :)
.
.
A must visit place for all bakery lovers!! <3

This delightful little bakery is located in New Market, Esplanade. Nahoum and Sons is quite popular and is always buzzing with throngs of people. The bakery was founded by Nahoum Israel Mordecai, a Baghdadi Jew, in the year 1902 and it remains as one of the most prominent confectionery till date. One should definitely try their Black Forest Cake which has its own taste. The different biscuits and muffins and fudges are worth trying. If you are around the New Market area, and you want a quick bite of something sweet, then this is the place. It is very reasonably priced and it won't disappoint you at all.

Set up by a Baghdadi Jew Nahoum Israel Mordecai in 1902, this Jewish bakery continues to serve the people of our city with elan even today. Some of the best and freshest bakery stuff emanate from here and for me a visit to Hogg Market without a visit to Nahoum and Sons is unimaginable. The pastries, brownies, puffs, patties, tarts, marzipans, fruit cakes.... the list goes on and on. They have maintained the same taste and the same quality since times immemorial and that is what keeps them going, inspite of the stiff competition all around today. The Last of the Mohicans of the dwindling Jewish population in Kolkata, I wish them the best and I hope they keep pampering us, the same way they have been for all these years. A motivation for many upcoming bakeries and many established bakeries as well, in the city. Nahoum and Sons... Legend. Period.

This is one of the few places in Kolkata that can take you back in time. It is a must visit for foodies searching for nostalgic flavours of Kolkata. However, my first experience was not thoroughly great. I went for chicken puff and chicken mayonnaise patties, both of which were much dry and not worth the price. Chocolate pastries, lime tart and the sweet bun are must try. Overall its is recommended place for snacks and dessert.

I have been having things from here since i was born back in 90s. This is a heritage institution and anything good written about it would still be an understatement! Yes, it's that good! Come here on any 24th December and u'll get the proof. All u would find is a mile long queue of loyal and age-old customers waiting for their turn to fetch a pound of plain or plum cake for Christmas.
Have tried everything on their menu, from plain to plum cakes, brownies to rum balls and lemon tart to fudges. And the various puffs too. And they are all worth going back over and over again!
Try their black forest cake!!
Nothing much to write for people who already know this place. But for the newer generations, i would like to say that please try this place and maintain the cult of old calcutta!

The quality of pastries in Nahoums have gone down drastically over the years. Kathleen is way better . Chicken patties was undercooked, I could clearly see the sides raw dough, cheese samosa is the worst. It's shaped like a Momo with some kind of bread inside and hardly any cheese. The heart shaped cake was good. The cakes during Christmas time is good. I had requested the lady owner that I wanted take away and she didn't even bother to heat it in microwave. She assumed I had one at home. Anyways, I gave it a 1 star because the cakes during Christmas are good. I believe mio amore aka monginis and Kathleen are far superior in terms of quality.

Walk into New Market and you’ll have entered one of the most Amazing shopping centrals. Started by a Jewish family almost 115 years ago, Nahoum’s is the most well known bakeries in Calcutta, if not India. The warm aroma of plum cake during the winters (and the Lemon Puffs) have the power to lure you into the dungeons of New Market gullies.

I visit this place frequently during my New Market expeditions. On hot days when a roll seems too much or when my idiosyncratic brain cannot do away the craving for sweets and cakes, it's Nahoum's that I rely upon.

Their Rum Ball smells like Rum: it's absolutely the real deal. Lemon tarts and cheese puffs are again what I find myself nibbling at. They make various cookies, candied nuts, brownies, tarts, cakes, breads and much more. 

I have never had the patience to buy any of the plum cakes made special for Christmas because of the resilient crowd always present at that time. I hope I do better in the future.

When it comes to witnessing the old world charm thru' food in Kolkata, Nahoum definitely makes it to the top 5.. The ambience of this place surely takes you to the yester years but somehow i feel the recipes aren't connecting much, i find the cookies and pastries mediocre, they don't do justice with the tag they have of serving the best in kolkata, in a sentence they still exist for their name..

Legendary bakery located in the hog market is known for their cakes. If you go during Christmas you'll invariably find yourself in a queue behind many. On my last visit this is what I tried -
1. Lemon puff- perfectly mild sweet with the taste of lemon crème and soft baked cake! Pure bliss!
2. Chocolate éclair - crunchy from outside with soft chocolate cake from inside its a must try for chocolate lovers!
Both were for 30₹ each!
Do fry if you haven't!

This famous age old bakery situated inside the New Market is a heritage. This place is paradise for tart lovers. Their almond tart and jam tart are awesome and mouth melting. If you go there in the evening then fresh hot chicken patties will be there for you. A different kind of taste with a preparation made of minced meat with rich aroma and flavour. Finally you can have their chocolate brownie-very tasty and soft brownie which a brownie lover like me cant avoid. So next time if planning for shopping in the new market area then must visit this bakery.

If you are a true Calcuttan then there are a few specific places where you should know that you can find the city's heart . Such kind of a place is here which is a baker's and confectionery lover's delight . I came to know about this place from a friend of mine who told me that their brownies are the best however the pattiserie items are more mouth watering . We had chickem puff which was a bit on the drier side , needed more moisture but the cheese puff was excellently balanced . On the sweets side I and my mom had sweet buns which was beautifully engraved with a lot of dry fruits and tasted yum . I brought a few packets of macaroons ( though not like the pictures which google shows us :D ) , marzipans . My mother loves sweets and hence sweets are more on the list , will look forward to have the tarts the next time .

The quality is same as before! Rich fruit cakes, mouth watering pastries or delicious patties or the main attraction of this shop CHOCOLATE BROWNIE is my favourite! 
Here I am adding some pictures of some items! 

Every desert lover know this name, this brand! If anyone left, please visit once to observe, to taste the rich quality deserts

Huge variety of cakes, pastries, patties, biscuits, cookies and what not. Located inside Hogg Market in New Market, people still flog here every Christmas. Prices are reasonable. The interior is a bit dimly lit, filled with wooden furniture and all. Nice place if you like the taste.

Been to this place a while ago. Not too hard to find as it can be easily found in the new market area. You just have to follow the Zomato maps. 

I tried multiples items from their menu. First of all, this shop is too old and their taste remains still so good. I had one of their eclairs, cream roll and date sticks. Date sticks were nice and tasted very well. Eclairs was something different from the rest. It had a unique nostalgic flavor which I couldn't remembered well. And talking about the cream roll... It was awesome! 

Fell in love with this place. Unique german desserts at such affordable prices. I will definitely visit this place whenever I visit kolkata again for sure.

I guess places like these are important to preserve the way they are without any infringement because they embody the stark dichotomy of the new skyscraper-studded lustrous kolkata and the old world "laatshahebi" kolkata. Nahoum and sons has been at the heart of new market for a century now, the bakery which emanates a feeling of nostalgia to kolkatans inevitably. I went here for the first time after some shopping in new market. The place does not offer seating arrangements and it has a dingy feel with wooden cupboards where the pastries and snacks are kept for display. However, the moment you enter the place you are drawn by a luring smell of freshly baked cookies and biscuits which is enough to sweep you off your feet. I had crunchy brownies and black forest. Both of the items were wonderful. It was one of the best black forests I have ever tasted. Though it does not have the perfect glass covered display as we see in other pastry shops like cookie jar or just baked, it is a treat to be here as it has an aura of its own... Would love to visit again and have a go at their much talked about lemon tarts...☺

An entry to Nahoum's after a long time had literally given me a kick at my gastronomy. The aroma itself inside the old New Market shop ( they're​ a bit shabby) is just awesome to get you stuck to a wide variety of cakes and pastries. The quality remains the same as it was before and hence it can easily draw crowd not only from different parts of the city, but also across the country, even from abroad.
As usual, I'm hooked to the all time's great and my favourite Rich Fruit Cake I no time. It is still enticingly brown, rich with dry fruits including lots of almonds and walnuts. It's heavenly and so delicious. This cake is great for all ages and an equal treat to have by one and all irrespective of different age brackets. Do not miss it. Go and grab it. As far as the price, you may find it a little costlier. But if you taste the heaven, I'm sure, you won't mind taking the pocket pinch.

Best in class, there cakes and pastries were awesome . I can clearly recall my old days when i used to have these kind of small cakes. And after so many years again i found that type of cakes here. Its a gem no doubt about that but the price point is on a higher side but there quality is up to the mark. Very difficult to spot the place if your are not familiar with esplanade and hogg market.

It's more than a 100 years old and still they provide fresh items right from the bakery. You can choose from different types of breads to pastries to fruit cakes. This place also prepares a variety of other items during festive season like christmas and easter.  Nobody can be a true Kolkatan if they had not tasted Nahoum's cake

One of the oldest bakeries in the city. Located within the labyrinth of New Market this iconic bakery makes time stand still. Traditional decor, ambience and everything related to it will string you back to the colonial days. All the products are delicious and would satiate your craving. My personal favourite is the lemon tart. This place is a must visit for anyone who has a sweet tooth

This is one of the oldest rather the oldest bakery. Its located inside the new market which is difficult to locate. But it doesn't need an advertisement as it offers the best bakeries.  I have been eating over here since my school days. Brownie, choco fudge, strawberry cake, lemon cake are my favourites.  Must visit if u r visiting new market.

This is one of the oldest bakery shops in Kolkata, or maybe the oldest! I did not know about this place until one day when I literally discovered it while shopping in New Market.
Some of my favourites of Nahoum & Sons are, the brownie, chicken fudge, the mutton burger and also the macaroons. Worth a try to this shop from the British period. <3

Nahoum's is one place that I will definitely come back to whenever I am in Kolkata.Even though its located a bit on the interiors of new market, its not difficult to trace. 
               It maintains its authenticity & standard in terms of quality and never disappoints me no matter what I choose to eat from their classic range of cakes. The chocolate brownies and the chicken patties remain my favorite. Do try the Lemon tart.

It was a month back when me and my husband were about to visit my aunt's (maternal) place. Amongst the bengalese, we have a practise of takings sweets along with us whenever we visit someone's place. However this time we decided to skip the sweets and go for pastries. And guess who helped us in choosing the pastry shop...woohoo Mr. Google. And it was the very famous nahoum for us. This shop is more than 100 years old and sells some fresh baked pastries and patties. We bought the coconut ball, the lemon tart, the lemon pastry, the strawberry pastry, the chocolate pastry, the vegetable patty, the chocolate tart, the orange cookie, the date cookie and the cheese tart. Among them the vegetable patty, the lemon tart, the coconut ball and the orange cookie were out favourite. Each and every item was super fresh and super yummillicious. As they say old is gold, they proved it right being the best in the business till date.

It is an institution, though my parents and all the children of the 60s have told me that the quality has dropped but really for me it is a place where I go to when I am feeling blue... The imperfections of the place and the lack of flair is what is endearing and relatable... The place has not changed ever since its inception and the whiff of baked goods as you pass is alluring... The patties are stuffed with filling... Albeit a little dry, and the pastries are to die for.. especially the lemon puff and the black forest... The rum ball is legendary!!! And a Christmas must for me!!!
PS: Nahoum's was established in 1902 and honestly if I had the chance I would like to go back to the day it opened doors and started selling those awesome cakes and pastries and patties.... Time to bring out the timeturner

Although they had lot of crowd and they have grown much as a brand still all the staffs are really down to earth...When they saw me looking here and there for help within 2mins a person came and asked me what I am looking for and the ingredients of it and its shelf-life as well.....I mean no other brand as huge as them would take such pain to explain something like this who is not even shopping a lot..... Genueinly loved the service and I purchased a plum cake and two small almond tarts..... Definite visit...

A very small shop inside new market..its very difficult to locate if u dont know the exact shop number or the way. We were a little puzzled on where to search for it since new market in itself is very messy so we had to ask people multiple times till we got here. On reaching we saw the shop that the shop was overloaded with customers and most of the stock was almost over but we managed 4 brownies and 4 chicken patties for ourselves. The price point is fairly decent...neither the store nor the items they sell are well decorated or presented but the items tasted very good. They dont have any facility for warming up the brownies before selling since this shop is almost a wholesale shop. The brownies tasted very good and the chicken patties were fairly loaded with chicken pieces. They were fresh and very filling. The shop isn't very organized but they have kept their mark in their items and what they sell. Overall the place is worth a try.

Amazing cakes, pastries and brownies! I never miss to visit Nahoum if I'm at Esplanade. My favourite is the plain cake. It's a must in my house for Christmas. I have tried almost all the pastries available and every one of them taste the best I have ever had. Only problem is a newcomer may take some time to find the place in Hogg market, who has never been inside Hogg market before. Place needs no ambience when it gives you food that makes you close your eyes and get lost in the taste!

One such heritage bakeries that I know of in Kolkata! I am not fond of cream rolls in general but their custard pudding roll is to die for! The roll is as crisp and as tasty as a freshly baked cookie while the pudding used isn't as sweet as the cream in cream rolls! It's a must try! Their caramel coated cashews are my personal favourite!Black forest , chocolate truffle and pineapple pastries are found at their best here! Actually there isn't an item from this place that I don't like! Everything here I either love or like 😛
Inspite of being more inclined towards patisseries than confectioneries, I somehow prefer their confectionery items more than their patisseries! Not that they aren't good,but I like the former better! This shop isn't just a shop but an integral part of Kolkata! A visit to this place is a must for everyone! 😃

This probably stands among the oldest bakeries in town. Nahoum's was founded in 1902. We tried to enter using Google maps, but that was a miserable attempt. Finally the local shopkeepers came to our rescue and we located it within a minute. As far as the ambiance is concerned, it is not great, no seating arrangement, people eat there standing. The management has probably not tried to improve it and keep the charm of the Lost days intact. It was moderately crowded when we entered at around 4pm. We had rum ball, lemon tart, cheese samosa, black Forest cake, egg chop and parceled rum balls for my parents. The show stealer is the rum ball, the best I savoured till date. Cheese samosa is also tasty, quite differently done. Lemon tart and egg chop was okayish to taste. Black Forest cake was again quite appealing to my taste buds. Overall it was moderately priced, rather affordable (pricing depends on the target customers actually!). I would again visit this place for tasting other bakery items for sure.
Extremely sorry for the half eaten photos, we were damn hungry after our shopping session and could not wait to click the photos properly.

If you just take a look at the baking history of Kolkata you will find nahoums there, being recommended by one of my friend, and to check that history, rich culture and taste practically you have to be there, the very first thing that actually attract you is that great aroma of baking, you will find baked goods like breads biscuits scattered around you, and all are so fresh that you can feel that warmth of freshness without tasting,
 
Now coming to their pricing, everything priced very reasonably, though their black forest pastry seems to be a bit on the higher side compared to the product.

Talking about taste everything tastes heavenly to me, specially that chicken puff and chicken Mayo puff, that shredded texture was far different than what we get usually. And amongst all the desserts that lemon tart was the best, it feels so fresh that every word is less for that. 
So what are you waiting for just go there and experience the richest ever bakery culture from an authentic place.

The cream on the top was dense and very good. My friend tried the Black Forest Pastry and it was also excellent.

The name speaks for itself, the legend of Nahoum's confectioneries is not unknown to anyone from Kolkata. Sadly, though, it took me this long to actually visit the place. We had many things there - notably the lemon tarts (which are sharp, fresh and delectable to taste, definitely going back for these), the almond tarts (sweet, memorable for the iconic taste of childhood Christmas treats from school), strawberry pastry (perhaps the only average item I had), cheese puff (mild and subtle to taste) and the chicken mayonnaise puff (better than most of the things we eat at mainstream confectionary shops). I'll have to go back to try out the brownies and fudge.

All items range in between rs20-50 which makes it affordable for everyone. You can try whatever you want to but some of my personal favourites are rumballs, chocolate eclairs, lemon puff, lemon tart, cheese cake, fruit bun and pizza puff :) if you try any of these, I don't think you'll be ever disappointed :)

This place is reviewed so many times by so many people, they can actually publish a book of reviews. Nothing much to say other than the same old traditional superior taste of their cakes. But never got chance to taste their savouries/ baked items as there are so many other eating options in Esplanade, reach there tummy full. But nahoum is a brand in its own. Keep going and I would recommend few more generations to go there and have cakes & biscuits.

Nobody in this city needs an introduction to a much celebrated legendary bakery I.e the Nahoum . Those who are aware of its existence have been to the delightful cake store many a times and trust me these are the confectioneries sold here are far better than the ones we usually get from nearby usuals like mio amore . 

Apart from the plum cakes, sweet breads and cookies i personally like the following which I usually gorge upon whenever I make it a point to visit the place . I am not really a big fan of the snacks they provide like the chicken patties . Those are something you better skip and concentrate on the sweet items more .

1. Lemon tart :- Not exactly the original but a smaller version where the cake has a very soft layer with lemon cream sliced in between . It's an absolute delight and a must try .

2. Marzipan  :- This is an age old preparation where ground almonds , sugar and egg whites are used to provide an outer covering of a cake . This is once again a medium sized tart like biscuit where the outer covering is sweet and the inside is soft and tastes like almond . This is a personal favourite .

3. Rum balls :- The ultimate chocolate delight balls where an outer choco cream protects and inner Choco cake . I personally like the raisin inside the cake although many others do not. Although , this is a much eaten item from here and a must try .

The most negative thing about it is the location , the ever so stinky Hogg market . But , amidst all the bad smell lies some good stores and a legendary bakery . It is always crowded and you will have to hassle and tassle to order and eat your food but it's finally worth it . So, those who have not tried it yet do pay a visit and I am sure you won't get dissapointed .

Nahoum is a very well known confectioner located inside of the hogg in New Market. It is a very old and legendary cake house in kolkata. The chirstmas in our childhood was incomplete without the fruit cake from Nahoums and if you ask bongs for any cake shop in kolkata you will definitely heard this name. Their rich fruit cake is still the best in kolkata. Also the custard cream roll is heavenly and it literally melts in your mouth. The pastries are very good too. The prices are really affordable. They don't have any sitting arrangements, so either you have to stand and eat or take-away. Always a pleasant experience.

Childhood would have been incomplete without the brownies. I used to love the biscuits; there is a ginger variety, another had dates. I like the crackers (onion ones) as well.
Last but not at all the least; the heart shape cakes and the Rich Fruit Cake.

I had seen the store on national television channel lots of time (on Vicky and Mayur's Food Xpress programme). So I decided to visit the place. On 29th Dec. 2016 I had visited Nahoum and Sons for the first time for their famous light plam fruit cake which cost me 250 bucks. The cake was good but not as per my expectation. The fruit cake actually had no fruits at all, except lots of raisins and some cashew nuts on the top. If it costs between 150-180 then I'ld say that a good cake.
 We also had their chicken patties. They used minced chicken inside it. I think chicken chunks would be great instead of minced chicken.

Sweet buns was one item I used to have from Nahoums since I was a child. They are really good and equally overpriced. 
Other than that, I have tried their chicken patties which are good in taste too. Rich fruit cakes are something you must try there.

I think that it's really befitting that my 250th. review is that of Nahoum and Sons, a confectionery shop that has been a part of my life since my earliest memories. In my childhood days there weren't so many bakeries or confectioners around like today.For me the two that were close to my heart were Nahoums and Flurys. Birthday cakes , pastries etc. where generally ordered from either one of these places. Nahoums was a more regular haunt coz it was cheaper and secondly coz of its location. Being located inside the bustling New Market it was the go to place for pastries and cakes whenever we shopped here. Obviously I be been here countless times because those days this was the only shopping destination unlike today when there are so many new glitzy Malls.Its a big shop, with the old world cabinets  displaying their products. They have stuck to their traditional items and not really introduced too many new items. Their pastries and cakes are different from the other bakeries around because they are a Jewish bakery and that is their USP. That said I really missed those robust, jolly and ever smiling Jewish gentleman who sat behind a wooden desk and took the payments. I've seen one brother or the other being there from childhood ( earlier even two of them). Now they are sorely missed and once again I rue the passing away of an era.
The shop remains the same in a time warp but the people have changed.
I have some items from here that have become favourites over the years and they are the almond tart, cheese cake, strawberry slice, rum balls, choc slice, heart cakes, sweet buns, biscuits like water biscuits, marzipan, Christmas cakes, birthday cakes and also their peppermint sweets. 
Whenever I visit New Market I make it a point to buy from here but alas that is not too often for shopping at Newmarket has become a rarity.
This place has a special place in my heart and it pains me to see that it seems to be floundering somewhat in the new age
But is definitely recommended.

This legendary cake outlet in the heart of New Market has been my favorite since I was a little girl and I remember my parents taking me here after a morning of puja shopping.The tuna sandwiches, the cupcakes, and the rum balls were my favorite those days. The walnut brownies, the marzipans are the ones which I pick up from the store now.Not to forget, during Christmas I line up in front of the shop (well, the line stretches through the whole left span of the market)for their rich plum and fruit cakes which are a cake-lovers' delicacy.The 5 tier Wedding cakes are such a pretty sight, you will often be caught off guard staring and dreaming about them.In a nutshell, all cake and cookie lovers' paradise!

This place is confusing. Zomato lists a huge menu but you only get to see 10 - 15 items displayed and wonder how the rest would be available.

That said, their lemon puffs / tarts are perfect. Not obnoxiously sweet, the flavour of the shortcrust pastry is distinctly memorable.

And their garlic bread is one of the best I've ever had. They are peppery, buttery, garlicky goodness packed in a bread. After trying just 2 items, I do want to give this place another shot!

This is one legendary cake shop in Kolkata and is very, very popular during the winter for its plum cakes and fruitcakes. Christmas without a cake from nahoum's is almost incomplete for most of the families in Kolkata.
For a foodie, any visit to Kolkata would be incomplete without a visit to Nahoum's.

Christmas is incomplete without visiting this place. After standing in a queue when we get the chance to order for our share of fruit cake,it is the beginning of our christmas week. Chocolate pastry, almond tarts are some other delights.

Nice place with a touch of historical essence

Cake is nice but the pastries not that of a high class.

These people are legendary possibly one of the few jew families left in kolkata.

After the death of david nahoum this place is hoing good but i am expecting to see some good changes..

Nahoums is what legendary stuff is made of! I love the Kookie Jars and the like but it is always so nostalgic to go back to this place. Used to carry Nahoums brownies for my friends when I used to be in college at Bhubaneswar, this time took a friend from Bhubaneswar on a dessert fiesta and he absolutely loved it! The cheesecake is like nothing I've ever had. The heart cake has a lemon tinge to it my friend tells me, the minced fruit cake is missable he says, the almond tart is worth trying. There are times when you hope nothing changes, I feel the same for this place.

Probably the best Cakes that I have had. Being a follower of Subhas Chandra Bose, I came to know of this place during our research. He loved the Nahoum cakes, later on, Bhagwanji, whom we believe to be none other than him, used to ask his disciples to get him cakes from here for his birthday celebrations.

###"RAW EGGSHELL'S FOUND IN THE CAKE "#Below average cakes with very stubborn outlook by the shopkeepers was what I experienced when I visited the place at 24th of December 2016 .......nearly stood in the queue for 30 mins to enter the shop ...and when I finally entered the shopkeepers didn't pay any attention to its customers.....after asking several times they replied harshly they only have 2 kinds of cakes 1.fruit cake 2.plum cake prices:250/400gms, 600/1lb ....bought the fruit and nut cake and came home...                                                                           after returning home eagerly opened the box to experience the quality of a 114 years old cake shop.     1.after the third bite I remained awestruck after finding a big chunk of raw eggshell in the cake.                2. The cake was under baked and felt like it was a HALWA   my brother uploaded the picture of the cake with the pieces of eggshells but I don't know who removed it from zomato might be from the shop but re uploading it again.........the quality of their cakes  has deteriorated considerably after the death of David nahoum in 2012.

Legendary place indeed..tried their Plain Fruit Cake and Cashew Cookies for the first time this year. It truly is amazing, I cant say if it is as good as it used to be, but just to be a part of a legend I gave them a try and I am happy, that I did. Must try, just for the history, the old world charm and magic.

I have heard about this place a lot... I have heard this place is legendary..... But I am too disappointed with this place....Even monginis is better than this bakery...

Location : inside new market/hogg market..easier to find if u enter from side of Kolkata Corporation...

Decor : Old Bakery.... Very Old....

Food : We Ordered 1 light Fruit Cake and Few Chocolate Pastry.... Both were below average.... The chocolate Pastry tasted like one of those Old "jalojog chocolate pastry"... Very poor taste.... Fruit cake was most ordinary... for Rs 250/400 gms it was total disaster....

Cost : compared to the taste of food... its very costly....

Service : even stuffs (specially the old guy serving pastry) were very rude....... "Kiser eto gorom ke janey..."

Will never come back for sure...

Being one of the oldest bakery's in Kolkata you expect quality in there cakes.......But now it is not like the golden old days .....We visited the bakerery the day before Christmas and ordered a fruit cake and apart from the cake being undercooked we found pieces of raw egg shells in our cake  you can find the picture attached after this review no dought there are more places better than this in Kolkata. Apart from the cake we also ordred two types of Tart chocolate tart and almond tart but comparing the two types of tarts the almond tart was good and the Chocolate tart was not up to the mark because they must have used cheap quality chocolate in them. On my side there is a big no for visiting the shop again because the so called HERITAGE is long lost.

Had heard a lot about this place inside Hogg Market, so decided to give this place a visit. I didn't expect the amount of people that were inside the place but after some fighting I did manage to have a black forest pastry and a mud ball. Took a rich fruit cake home. Absolutely delicious! The pastry was soft and easily melts into your mouth. The fights and the struggles inside the shop because of the crowd was worth it!

You haven't seen the culture if you haven't been at Nahoums already. The legendary bakery of Kolkata that has been the reason for happiness for years now. 
Christmas brings along a huge queue waited outside this bakery just to buy their speciality cakes. 
Pastries are decent. Absolutely in love with the fruit cakes.

It's been here since ages.. even my father has childhood memories of this place. If you visit it at a time even remotely close to Christmas, you'll find it packed to the brim and it deserves to be. I have fond memories of going here with my dad to buy Plum cake and fruit cakes on Christmas eve and dad and I always had a rum ball or pastries to while away our time when our cakes were getting packed for take-away. Their cakes and pastries are always fresh and tasty and if you don't manage to be the early bird, there's always a chance of missing out. 

I'd give it a perfect score but I cannot because somehow the staff always finds a way to be rude to us- you see we aren't the types who come in and buy like 50 cakes and the staff goes all gaga over them. We're just a father-daughter duo who are looking to celebrate Christmas with a cake or two so I guess they feel it's okay to make us wait in a queue or sometimes not even respond to our questions and turn their face away. Sadly, we keep going back every year because we still haven't found a place which makes better stuff.

Being a frequent visitor to the New market area, it's quite difficult to miss out Nahoum's. The place is not just legendary but iconic I must say.
The savory, confectionery and the much famed cakes are such a treat to splurge on! The aroma of freshly baked items just lingers here and the taste is one of a kind...no wonder this is one of the city's old charm that still continues to cater, maintaining the same standard.
The only drawback is that this place accepts only cash for payment no other modes of payment options are available here.

This is my city and I wonder why I never visited this shop in person. We are used to the usual way of my father picking up the plum cake from this place every year. So this year, I broke the jinx and visited this place along with my parents in person. This is an Iconic shop in Stuart Hogg Market or commonly known as New Market , since 1902. Most of the employees have been working here for ages. 
My personal favourite here is the lemon tart and light plum cake. You can also buy biscuits, garlic bread, sweet bun, patries and toffees or chocolate fudge. 
When you pass by, you can spot this place easily by the aroma.
Only cautionary note , they still deal with CASH only , no Paytm or Credit Card accepted , hence pls be prepared.

Legendary confectioners of Kolkata, this place has been there for as long as I can remember. I have been visiting this place since I was a toddler. I like everything about here; the cheese puffs, the chicken patties, the rum ball (my favorite) ....the old 70s look and feel, the friendly shopkeepers, the owners readily starting a conversation with you while you are paying your bill....everything! And last but not the least, the rich fruit cake in December, during Christmas. I have been to a lot of places in India and abroad, but I am yet to taste cake remotely close to this in taste. If you haven't been to this place, you have not yet seen half of Kolkata.

Holding fort for one of the last Jewish bakeries in the city,this is not a high on design place. It is not pink , no French furniture or gilded mirrors here. Old fashioned glass fronted cabinets with baked goodies. Try the egg chop ( not available on Fridays ), or the savoury biscuits, the breads and even the fruit cakes. Birthday cakes here have lost its sheen though I remember my first 10 birthday cakes were from here.

I used to get them as a kid and till date I have never tasted anything better in this city. The pastries-a little sweet, but delightful. Nahoum is without a doubt one of the best bakeries in town.

One of the finest bakeries in Kolkata Nahoum and Sons has a place of it's own in the history of the city . I try to visit this place whenever I am in New Market region not only for cakes but also to witness the rich tradition of this place which is an institution in itself. There was a time when winter in Kolkata was synonymous with cakes of Nahoum's . With passage of time many bakeries have come up but Nahoum still holds its place in the mind of the people. The cakes are simply delicious & mind blowing. The chocolate brownie , heart shaped cake etc. are favourite of mine .Their cakes are a bit hard than the soft cakes made by the new age bakeries but that is their tradition & it has always been so. Visit this place to cherish a rich heritage of Kolkata .

114 years of heritage doesnt come easy and this place is evidence that hard work, commitment to your trade and sticking to your beliefs pays off handsomely. This place is so much more to me especially because its been a childhood haunt. As a child going shopping for mommy utilities was always a treat because of Nahoum's and even now after more than a decade this place is still the same... that i guess is the beauty of it. Its dependable,reliable and always there. This is a confectionary so dont expect seating its more of a check out, buy and go kind of place. Its been around for ages and a lot of the menu has been the same. Which is good because theyve mastered their art and hence their trade. When you go, i would recomend:

1. Lemmon Puff
2. Cheese puff
3. Chicken patty
4. Their special dry brownie (its unique!)
5. Croissant
6. Chocolate rumball
7. Chicken panteras

I could write so much about this place but it wouldnt be relevant so ill stop! However please do go and da word about the staff, they make you feel very at home!!

It is known as one of the legendary bakeries of kolkata and some items available here does live upto that name..i have tried the chocolate eclair here which is the right combo of crunchy and soft..the cheese tart could have been better though and the lemon cake remains as good as ever.The chocolate brownie of nahoums calls for no complaints as well.But with other bakeries fast gaining popularity in kolkata,Nahoums does need to improve themselves more if they wish to hold the same place in market.

There was a time when this place was a must -  visit. This place is a legend. This place is iconic. The irony is that now it is simply a place running on its historic value. Because it is Nahoum, people must visit it, especially the nostalgic older generation. 
Otherwise, there has been no quality up gradation. In fact, quality and finishing are disappointing. It has tough competition from other newer, motivated confectioners.

, do i need to say more? 
A Legendary Bakery in Kolkata, located opposite of Little Store inside Hogg Market in Esplanade.
Their Plum cakes and Brownies are my favorite! Christmas feels incomplete without their delicacies!
Only thing they lack is a place to sit and eat! But that's not much of a problem though.
You will experience long queues during Christmas! A must visit for everyone!

After hearing quite a bit from my food mentors, I decided to give this a try on my next visit to new market for the Puja shopping, visited on 30th Sept,2016 at 6pm.

The shop was decently crowded and the staff's behavior was just average. The ambiance was pretty much like a vintage movie with basic lighting with tubelights you find at home. 

Most of the fried stuff ran out of stock so we were disappointed and the only non veg item left was the Chicken Patties which we don't generally prefer. A shop with this reputation should have filled counters at 6 in the evening, that's a peak time. 

We took,
3 Chicken Patties
2 Chocolate Pastry
1 Coconut Ball ( Narcoal they called it) 

Patties(7/10): A fair and a decent serve it was. As per the price its alright, won't say it's value for money. It was heated to the right temperature and tasted well enough for a crowded evening.

Chocolate Pastry(10/10): Brilliant choice. The sweetness of each bite is accurate and even which will melt on your tastebuds. The cream is different than what you find in Mio Amore and other alternatives. The cake is thicker than any comparison but soft and very well made. The homemade claim is completely precise. 

Coconut Ball(6.5/10): This was also a decent item. Not too good nor too bad either. Many might not like the smell of coconut oil in this. They head this up as well. It was a crunchy outside and tender inside and its kind of a coconut bread.

This grandpa-bakery inside the Old Complex of Hog Market is (legendary, obviously) a darling ! 

The brownies at 35/- are gorgeous in their crispy crust and generous walnut sprinkles. 
The lemon puff. The sugar dusted cake has a such a great texture, fluffy, pillow-y soft with one hella awesome lemon filling. (Personal favourite)
They also make so many other endearing baked sweetmeats (always a pleasure to walk past the shop with all that aroma of freshly baked things) like sweet buns and puffs, etc. They have these chocolate and strawberry cakes with sugar glaze on top that I loved as a child but don't enjoy anymore because they're too sweet. 

Nahoum is your happy-nostalgic Jewish bakery with all the exquisite recipes and memories. 

Don't give it a miss !

Have been visiting this legendary bakery since childhood days with my mom. Love their rum ball cakes and the old style cream pastry. Among the savories - the patty and the cheese sticks are my all time favorites. Still can't miss to pop into this bakery everytime i visit New Market.

Although I have been well acquainted with this place since I was a kid, I really didn't get to explore the variety of bakes that they offer until lately. I was famished after a tiring day of shoppings In new market and needed to grab a quick bite. Luckily for me I located Nahoum and my eye caught the site of those delectable pastries kept on display.
I ordered a pineapple and a chocolate pastry and boy! The Pineapple pastry was the best I ever had!! Fresh, light and yummy! The chocolate was nothing less although the pineapple was clearly the winner !

It was my first visit to the age-old legendary confectionery and it just won my heart. I had one of their famous lemon-tart, one chocolate fudge, one chicken cheese patty and a heart cake.  Each of the items are mouth watering and have some old Kolkata charm in it.

Well I'm a crazy cake lover,love anything and everything about cakes! This is my 4th time in Nahoum's and I'm crazy about their Rich Fruit Cake.Their brownies are appealing too.
              The fruit cake is very ordinary, no point going for it.Instead try their hotseller,Rich Fruit Cake.It's stuffed with dry fruits,raisins and "petha". The brownies are amazing here,all studded with nuts.
              Only this time I found the cake a li'l bitter. Apart from this I'm totally satisfied with the cake.Instead of queuing up for hours during the Christmas eve it's worth trying their cakes on any other day throughout the year.This is more because during Christmas eve you can't choose what you buy as they produce only a single kind.

I could say that a visit to Nahoum takes me down memory lane each time. I was introduced to the chocolate fudge by Nahoum when I was about 5 years old by my tutor. It was the weekly reward for the best behaved child at my tution classes and how we would all put up our best front for it. 

That time I did not know where it was, but much later became a regular visitor to the heritage bakery.

On my last visit I tried
The lemon puff :  A flaky puff pastry with lemon curd . Being a lemon fan this was a must try for me and I quite like this one.

Rum ball: a pastry ball with a strong hint of rum, candied fruits and chocolate cake dipped in chocolate sauce. This one was really nice.

Chocolate fudge: This one is a must must try for all. Slightly on the sweeter side but it has a reasonable shelf life so I store it and eat it.

Brownies : They come individually wrapped in cellophane. The size is decent. And it is very chocolatey but just little too dry for my taste.

This place is full of customers on every visit. The taste is quite different from the usual bakeries. But down the years they have maintained the traditional taste extremely well. A visit every month is a must for me.

Nahoum is an institution in baking and confectioners which saw the evolution of 'kolkata' from 'Calcutta'.

During Christmas, people have to queue up for hours before they can lay their hands on Nahoum's cakes.

I absolutely love their pastries. My fave is the rumball! 
I haven't tried much savory here but I like their puff pastries.

It has an old school feel and you know that the people here mean serious business, as all of them were engrossed in doing there job 
We had lemon puff and pineapple pastry, both of which were absolutely amazing. The taste could tell that the recipe hasn't changed for the years Nahoum as been around, and I appreciate how the standard is still so high 
Will definitely visit the next time I'm in Kolkata!

I have been going to New market for as long as I can remember, for me going to New market also meant enjoying some dessert from Nahoums. It is rather unfortunate that over the years the quality of the products is steadily decreasing whereas the prices of things are increasing. None the less, I do buy things occasionally. If you are in the mood to indulge, do try out the jam tart and peppermints.

I don't mean to discourage anyone, the products I still very tasty and pretty affordable as opposed to Cookie Jar or Cakes. I just judge based on what the brand used to be and what it is now.

We all love Kolkata for it's old world charm. And one of the oldest bakery in Kolkata is Nahoums. Just go to Hogg market and ask anyone, they'll guide you to this legendary outlet. Sensational brownies. However, I can't say the same about the pastries. I love their cookies though. Just go there to get a feel of the oldest bakery in Kolkata. Added bonus is that you'll get to munch on some yummy stuffs.

One of Kolkata's oldest bakeries lies within the Hogg Market.....its the Nahoum's. I go to Nahoum's every time I go for shopping over there. Perfect for the times when you are shopping and want to fuel yourself with some snacks. But yeah.....the food has become really dry over here. Choices are less too and taste is nothing over the top. Its an okayish bakery now. But but but....that special mixed fruit cake they make during Christmas is out of the world. You literally have to pre-order it...!!!

Though Nahoum is a legendary name in Kolkata within the domain of bakeries embedded in the city, I am not much impressed by its confectioneries.
I did taste few pastries and the corn puff, cheese puff & the chicken puff. Pastries were 
not upto the mark where as the chicken puff was ok types. Corn puff and cheese puff tasted bland. 
So according to me, the legendary name doesn't serve the legendary taste anymore.

Its not bad. All I am saying is that it does not live upto its name.

One does not simply live in Kolkata and forget Nahoum. It's simply a jewel in the crown of Kolkata's culinary empire. It's nit only a confectionery but a legacy and a heritage of the city and a fine example of the city's Jewish  connection.

Every-time I think of a cakes and pastries, this is the first confectioneries shop that comes to my mind. May be because I soft cornet for this old shop, but undoubtedly this is shop which introduced me to various cakes, puffs, croissants, pastries, buns, fudges and breads. Sweet cheese bun is one my personal favorite, following fruit and nuts cakes. A must visit for me every time I am near New Market Area, some times deliberately.

When I was a kid, I have been to a dentist 's place to extract a bad tooth. The Dentist asked me the most common question in case, I eat too much cakes, pastries or chocolates ? My reply was simply 'Yes. I love Nahoum's cream cakes & pastries.' The Dr laughed out loud!

My review might be a bit biased towards this place as for me the definition of confectioners is Nahoum's.

My favourite :
Turnovers, Strawberry & Chocolate blocks, Lemon Tart, Cheese puffs , heart cakes

Try the very different Baklava, Marzipan, fruit bun, brownies.

I don't thing anyone can compare their rich plum cake.. 

These are just my favourites .. You need to go there & understand why a 100+ years old Confectionery shop still calls for a queue during Christmas which is longer than so called kolkata's favourite 'Kerosene teler line' lol 😍😍👍

The name is to swear by for any Kolkata resident! In the age of cakes and kookie jars, there's a reason people keep flocking to Nahoums. If you are unaware of that reason, I'd suggest you head over one day and have a taste of their chocolate pastry, lemon puff/tart, cheese puff, blackforest pastry(served right out of the freezer) or any other item on their menu, really. Still in doubt? Then hit the queue on Christmas eve for their oven fresh fruit cakes and you'll never regret the time spent waiting!! 😊

This is one of the confectionary which every traditional foodie in Kolkata has an emotional attachment with. I never miss out on an opportunity to grab a Walnut Brownie when I am around at the New Market, Esplanade. The plum cakes and the muffins are a big hit here. The plum cakes contains enough dry fruit chunks to satisfy a person with a sweet tooth ! Highly recommended from my side to try out at any season in the year, be it the Christmas or any other time. :)

I had heard a lot about this place from the locals and a few travel and food shows. So on a hot Saturday evening, my sister and I finally went to this legendary bakery. We reached there around 5 pm and most of their stuff was over. We had a black forest pastry, a brownie, a cheese samosa and a chicken patty. To our dismay there was nothing special about any of the items ordered. The chicken patty was too oily,the cheese samosa had anything but cheese, the black forest pastry was extremely dry and the only saviour was the brownie. On my way back I realised that this place has an emotional value for the locals here and that is why it's so famous because it's food was nothing but bad.

If you appreciate to sulk into the history of this city, if you happen to have a sweet tooth or if you happen to be a regular visitor at New Market, chances are high you haven't missed out on visiting this legendary bakery atleast once in your entire life. Famed and glorified due to their quality bakery products, the history of this store goes back to the year 1902, when this shop was first set up.

Set up by Mr. Nahoum Israel, who happened to be a Jewish and made his way from Baghdad, this place earned its hype very shortly and happened to be famous even among the British. It was then passed on to his son and then to his grandson, Mr. David Elias Nahoum who happened to pass away in the year 2013. It was during the time of Mr. David Elias Nahoum, that this cafe gathered most of the steam. Even after years of their establishment, the quality still remains the same and is top-notch. Try their lemon tarts, chicken patty, muffins, rum balls, brownie, chicken quiche... Well the list goes on an on!

It is often said, that Christmas is not a Christmas until and unless you have a rich fruit cake or a delicious plum cake from Nahoum and Sons. This shop still brings in the old charms of Kolkata and will rule the hearts of each and everyone of the people who love this city, and make sure that they fall in love with this legendary bakery shop as well!

Located in the heart of hogg market, inside new market; is one of those heritage bakeries that every kolkata-n has visited at least once in their lifetime. It is said that on Christmas Eve people from far and wide come to this store for their yearly does of Christmas Cakes.

I have visited this place on numerous occasions. And though their interiors are not fanciful and their staff irritable, Nahoum's bakery products are famous all across kolkata. I'm extremely found of their plum cakes, brownies and black forest cakes. Especially the brownies, are a must try if you are ever here.

Lot of fond memories of this shop. Brings back nostalgic moments when my parents used to order cakes for our birthdays. Indulging in fruit and nut cakes, lemon tarts   chicken patties & chicken puffs. Too crowded to sit and enjoy the food affair.

They remain evergreen. I wish I could go there more often but for the parking situation around new market. Sometimes I wonder how the authorities just let it happen. Coming back to Nahoum... Cheese straws, Christmas cakes, chicken patti, mutton patti.. Childhood love

Does the place need a review?? As every citizen of Kolkata, and even people residing other cities are well aware of this place. And my preference for this place is since my childhood, and even today, its a place which is appreciated by family for its awesome delights, it is serving since ages. Specially the "Black Forest" of this place is just amazing. And if you are visiting this place during Christmas, New Year or Easter, you may end up standing in a long queue, and may get disappointed to find your preferred item exhausted. That is the craze for their awesome delights. A must visit for all.

I had been eager to try Nahoum but I must say I was a bit let down. The food was just fine. The one thing I liked was their chicken patties. They were really delicious. Also the garlic bread is quite nice. I love garlic and hence love this bread too! Apart from that, the date tart was okay, lemon tart was fine and the pastries were quite average. I was left bitterly disappointed. But because of its popularity and good reviews, I'd like to believe that the place is a good one and for that reason I will visit again soon to get back on this review.

I've had their egg cups, chicken patties and rich fruit cake even though I do not much prefer a fruitcake. Only Nahoum can make me have one :p Every year during Christmas a throng of shoppers, foodies and dedicated customers flock to this age-old traditional Jewish bakery for delightful treats and snacks.People stand in line in long queus patiently for hours just to buy from this antique heritage shop. The reason is easily discernible why. Cuz the food is worth the wait.

Deconstructing such places for the purpose of rating them is rather difficult. 

Yet, Nahoum and sons continues its tradition with simple straightforward sweetness. It's the bold use of flavours and the classic recipes that brings out the best in what's behind the counter here. 

1. Though its located in the heart of the rather crowded and confusing New Market. You can literally sniff this place out and know that you will enjoy the food here. 
2. It was my first visit today, and we had lemon tarts and puffs, must say... The lemon cream was bold and the puff was perfectly soft, deft craftsmanship.
3. Even after that my sweet tooth wasn't satiated, so we tried a fruit cake slice- classic ingredients, brilliant texture & fresh.
4. Next up chocolate eclair... The cream had an interesting texture, but the biscuit hit the home run for me.

I usually use a criteria for rating the restaurant. This time however the food-gasm threw me off my game.

I was slightly disappointed though, it was 4 PM yet most of the shelves were empty. Then again, whatever was there was brilliant. So, I deduct 1 mark for the empty shelves and all those things I missed so early on in the evening that too.

USP: old world charm, non-fancy-classic recipes, sweet lovers paradise and surprisingly pocket friendly!

Expenditure: 200-250 for 2 persons.

Apparently I didn't like Nahoum as a child. Probably because I'm not a fan of plum cakes and fruit cakes but my family is. So for the longest time I stayed away from this place knowing I didn't like it (also because it's far from home). But then all this talk of lemon tarts and pastries finally brought me back and I'm glad it did.
We had tarts- chocolate and lemon and chicken puffs. All of them were pretty good. The lemon tarts are super light and don't leave an annoying aftertaste in the mouth which is great.
The good thing is that everything is so petite (and pocket friendly) that you can try out a lot of things and not feel full. Although I didn't want to stop eating lemon tarts.
The food and the walk through Kolkata's heritage market are definitely worth repeat visits.

There are places in Kolkata, which actually don't need a review. Because the name itself defines the position it belong to. Undoubtedly "Nahoum and Sons" is one such name, which the city of Kolkata is well aware of since ages. And so far, my emotional attachment with this place is concerned, I've been witnessing this place appreciated by my family since my childhood, for the awesome delights they are providing to treat our taste buds. So undoubtedly, I'm a big fan of their products anyday, and my love for "Nahoum and Sons" will remain intact forever, just the way they have maintained the taste and quality of their awesome delights, consistently, since ages.
A must & must visit for all the foodies out there. And if you are visiting during Easter, don't forget to taste their easter eggs.
Highly recommended.

This is one place that has been associated with the history of Kolkata’s confectionary scenario. For our family, this is the place which is associated with winter indulgences and Christmas celebrations. Their chocolates and plum cakes have made their way to our home for generations. However, the place is always too crowded for one to sit and enjoy their fare.

Well you know there r places which identify a city, Nahoum for me identifies Kolkata, slow to change, ageing, un assuming ,low on glamour quotient..at the same time full of quality, immensely powerful in its products and having a strong culture and following. The cakes as the pastries all of them ....just yummmm!!! People talk of the cakes, for me its the immensely tasteful patties, be it the fish, chicken , cheese or mutton. Every taste just unique and beautiful. For any newbies and calcutta peeps a must visit. ..take a bite of one of everything ;)

Heard and read much about the oldest jewish bakery. I hurriedly tried swimming across oceans full of shoppers in the new market area as I was expecting the bakery to be closed by 8. Finally reached the destination in time just to find out the old charm gilded in wooden furniture taking back you in time.
Surely the placements of their wares, display case, counter, floor, ceiling all represents the era around 100 years back.  I ordered Chicken Patties and trust me it was seriously quite heavily filled. Taste was OK. Additional tied innocent looking Jam Tart. Quality and taste both were great. Happily  left the counter with Rs 50/- for both the items with tummy full and sense of achievement that visited Kolkata's oldest heritage bakery.

One of my friends ordered her wedding cake from Nahoum & it was a total let down. Leaving that single instance apart, I have always liked their cakes & brownies. It is recommended that you visit this legendary age old Jewish bakery to try the cakes. During Christmas, be ready to wait in the absurdly long queue, but their Christmas fruit cakes are worth it!

This place abviously is a legend! The oldest surviving Jewish confectionary. I have heard the mince pie here is fantastic...and apparently it is so fantastic that every time I go and order for one, they seem to have run out of it. So, sadly never tasted one. I have tried the fruitcakes, lemon pop, cheese samosa. The items are unquestionably unique in themselves.

This place is legendary indeed! Very popular among us, sweet tooth-ed creatures of Zomato and Kolkata. Their mutton samosas are a delight, and those pink pastries are my favorite (excuse the ignorance, I have always dug into then without sparing a moment to read the tags). The cakes are delicious.
You need to experience it, to believe it.

It's a legendary place...enough said...
Located inside the new market old complex...this confectionery itself looks heritage...one of the oldest bakery of Calcutta....their pastries n puffs are very different from the normal one's and may be that's cuz of the Jewish influence...and I somehow like it alot.... Just love their strawberry pastry....they make really nice chicken/tuna/egg sandwiches and also mutton samosa's...but these samosa's n sandwiches are only available on Saturday.... And it gets over by 1-2 pm Max.... :( 
Try out their brownie.... heat it a bit before eating, u'l fall in love with it... :) and how can I forget their rich plum cake/Christmas special fruit cake...well, that's the best fruit cake I have ever eaten.... Non makes a fruit cake like that...I bet 1 can't eat a slice and not take a 2nd one...I've been Goin to nahoums since my childhood and i'v had almost everything over ther....not everything is nice over there....but certainly most of them are..
Their rich fruit cake is always on top of the list...i would say its one of those dish one shud eat before they day....and then they've got these marzipans, fudges etc...really like few of the items...the photos that i'v uploaded are all one of my favourite items from nahoums...

Well, what an experience. Heard about this place many times, mostly great reviews and crowd gathering during Xmas and year end.
This year I decided to check it out myself. On my sweet sweet mother's birthday I decided to give her a Nahoum treat. Visited early in the morning. Around 11 am. Crowded indeed. Normal new market style shop.

On asking at the counter, there were two main cakes available the fruit cake normal and the rich plum one. I decided to go with the latter for my mother loves these compared to cream cakes. Along side I also took cream roll, her favourite. 

Well, in the evening we had a small ceremony and then had my first Nahoum bite. It's deliciously yummy. I generally dislike fruit and plum cakes, more of a cream cake person. 
But this changed my perspective. Smooth creamy and the taste was just awesome. The cake had a nice smell. A flavour actually.
Cream roll was ok. A new kind I had, i must say. 
Awesome, definitely recommended.

Again I want to keep it really very very simple - my Christmas and New Year celebrations are of "no meaning", "useless" and "incomplete" without the rich plum cakes and rich fruit cakes from this legendary 113 years old Jewish bakery established in 1902 by Nahoum Israel, an emigrant from Baghdad. The legacy is still continuing the same way even after the death of owner David Elias Nahoum in 2013. Whatever the situation had been, or may be in future, I have queued up in front of Nahoum and Sons, and promise to queue up in future to buy the cakes every year.

Friends, do I need to say anything more?

A legendary restaurant is a common term associated with Nahom. A baker that has been feeding the city of Kolkata for many decades now completely engulfs the new market area with the aromatic goodness of its baked masterpieces. From cakes, pastries snacks and other innovative baked exhibits Nahom will always be my go to bakers and the best anywhere in eastern india.

This 113 years old Kolkata's iconic Swiss-style Jewish bakery was set up by Nahoum Israel, an emigrant from Baghdad. For more than a century this place still remains a holy spot for all the foodies craving for brownies, muffins, pastries, tarts, Christmas plum cake or fudge. After Nahoum Israel opened up this shop in the year 1902 it became an instant hit with the then British population and the Anglo-Indian community of old Calcutta. Then the local Bengali foodies also started warming up to these delicacies! After Israel, his son Elias took over and then David Nahoum took the reins. Recently David also passed away at the ripe age of 86 in March, 2013. But Nahoum's confectionery still remains the same, it is still synonymous to the old Calcutta. This Swiss patisserie inspired bakery never compromised with their quality and that is why it is still going strong after so many decades and through so many generations. The shop has got several famous customers in recent past as well, like Suchitra Sen, Manna De, Pearson Surita, Bob Wright, Aparna Sen, Usha Uthup, filmmaker Anjan Dutt, Geoffrey Fisher, etc. The place is one of the most visited spots of New Market, it is basically the place to do some 'tucking in' after or in-between shopping sessions at New Market area. 

LOCATION ----- The legendary bakery is located inside Hogg Market, while entering the Hogg Market just ask anyone about Nahoum's and you will definitely get the directions from him/her :)

AMBIANCE ----- Today also the place maintains that same vintage look and feel like it was then in 1902. The interiors and the overall ambiance have never changed and till today it is all the same. When you enter this place you are in a time warp and for me this enigmatic sense of time travelling is extremely thrilling apart from the fact that this place in itself is a gastronomical wonderland. The place still has got all those age old teak wood furnitures and structures, high ceilings and old ceiling fans. The place is not just an over the counter kind-of shop. It has got huge area inside and is quite spacious. The food products are placed at several locations inside the shop and you can walk upto them and pick them according to your preference. It has got one old-fashioned glass showcase where various delicacies are displayed that will attract the passerby. All these old world charms put together this place turns out to be an absolute gem of a bakery.

FOOD ----- The food is definitely the strongest point of this place, the reason why it is still going strong and why people come back to this place even today when so many new-age bakeries and fancy cake shops are mushrooming in every part of the city. Even today old loyalists of Nahoum’s swear by their brownies, fruit cakes, tarts, plum cakes, macaroons, fudge, etc. last week when I was again here at this place I tried out several products like:

a)	Brownies ---  The brownie available at Nahoum’s is very typical of this place, sort of a trademark product. It tastes amazing but it is bit dry and brittle in nature, prices are extremely reasonable and one should try this out for sure.

b)	Chocolate Fudge & Vanilla Fudge ---  On my special request a separate assorted packet of chocolate and vanilla fudge was prepared for me which I carried back home. It is small in size, one packet has got numerous fudges. I personally love the chocolate fudge over the vanilla fudge. Both are soft, smooth textured, extremely sweet and surely they do exude happiness and innocence. Loved by the kids.

c)	Heart Cake ---  One simple muffin that is shaped like a heart symbol. It is so unadulterated and heavenly that you just can’t have one! It is super soft and fluffy and with every bite you will feel like you are on cloud-nine. And it costs just INR 20/- per piece.

d)	Choc-o-Nut Biscuits --- Yes, you will get various kinds of hand made biscuits here at this bakery that will surely entice your tastebuds. I decided to carry back home one packet of Choc-o-Nut biscuits which are actually very different to taste than regular chocolate biscuits available elsewhere today. It tastes subtle, not overtly sweet, a bit dry but has a lasting sense of chocolaty bliss once you take a bite. It has got desiccated coconut powder, maybe that causes the dryness. The shapes are in general square but shape and size varies since they are cut manually. One packet of these biscuits will just cost you INR 35/-.  

SERVICE -----  I was really impressed by the enthusiasm of the people serving at this place, such legendary places rarely can boast of great service but this place is an exception. The person handling our order was patient, polite, helpful, well-informed and friendly. He seemed very dedicated to his job as well. The products were billed pretty swiftly and cash was accepted at the counter. 

OVERALL -----  Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 4/5

Food quality: 4.1/5

Value for money: 4.3/5

Ambiance: 4.5/5

Service: 4/5 

I seriously had an amazing experience each time I visited Nahoum’s. Apart from all these well known items, they have also got buns, breads, cookies, etc which taste way better that packaged buns, breads or cookies available at normal shops. Today after all these years the bakery is running in a much better way, it has been made more streamlined and efficient. So this vibrant place will spread more happiness and give us their signature bakery products for years to come. If you haven’t visited this place then please do pay a visit. And for tourists, a trip to Kolkata is still incomplete even today without one visit to Nahoum’s. Let the legend live long!

Cheers!
                                          ...

Once upon a time relishing lip smacking cakes and tarts with Nahoums was welcomed with open arms. But of late the quality has dipped to a disappointing level...i remembering the lemon puff cakes melting in my mouth after those typical after school trips to new market with dad and mom. However of late the cakes and tarts taste average...guess have lost their Midas Touch

A Pioneer in the confectionary world of Kolkata,'Nahoum's and sons',.Situated long ago(almost 113 years ago),this place still catering to satisfy kolkatan's taste buds.This is the last trail of the jewish people in kolkata!!This place has acquired a 'cult' status in the bakery world of kolkata!!
LOCATION:-Itz situated in the old new market,in an alley.Ask anyone in that area.and u'll b guided to this place in no time.Whenever i am near this during x-mas,u can be dragged by the aromas from this place.
SERVICE:-This place is always crowded,for their impeccable quality and value for money ,.U have to wait a bit for ur turn.Their servers are pretty fast though.
AMBIANCE:-Nothing to boast..this is aplace that resonates and sustains the old school charm.This place justifies the phrase"never judge a book by itz cover".
Now,they have a plethora of delectables,amongst which following are my staple and favourite:-
1)Fresh Plum Cake:-Yummy and heavenly!!Out of the world!!
2)Lemon tarts:-tasty!!
3)Strawberry Pastries:-Nahoum's is amongst those few places which i love in having strawberry pastries.
4)Chocolate fudge:-Prefectly chocolaty and gooey in taste..it is not overdone.
5)Blackforest pastry:-Very soft,fluffy and yummy!!
6)Chicken puff:-In the savouries,my staple is their chicken puff.
7)Baklava:-Tasty!!
Try anything from thius list and i bet,a foodie with a sweet tooth and those who are not,even they will be in love with this place!!!
A value for money and tickle to the tastebud..Nahoum's and Son's.

A recent visit to this ol' and oh -so-popular bakery..Nahoum brings back nostalgia and special childhood memory.. this age old shoppe in the new market has so many childhood memories attached to it..I can remember from my early years,when I was a kid ,used to go for pujo shopping with mah mom n dad and at the end we used to binge on those big choclaty rum balls.😈 Although my mom's favourite is the lemon tart..😁
This quaint lil shop tucked away in one corner of old new market I.e one of the many alleys of SS Hogg market...
May people have the question on their mind that what things drives people to Nahoums?? So...for them Nahoum is the part of Bengali Folklore and undoubtedly one of the brightest chapter in the history of Kolkata's food heritage run by a group of Jewish people gives the perfect aroma of freshly baked goods...
Its quality has impeccable for as long as I can remember..Though the shoppe has lost its shine but one can inevitably drawn to it due to the gastronomical memories attached to this place...I think the savoury snacks that they make are finger licking good ..🐱
In now days I try to grab a bite whenever I'm in that area..They serves fresh baked items -gold standard at a very reasonable price..😃

when it comes to cakes and fruit cakes and rum balls ....enters the name of the Giant .....they are the humble giants who have been ruling over the hearts of millions of Kolkatans over decades. there is hardly a person who has not tried something or the other here. and being the Only Jewish Confectionery  makes it much much more special.

Though competition is great yet it has retained its old world charm.. A visit to new market is incomplete for me if I don't visit this place.. I always pick up cashew cookies from here as my family is in love with them.. I personally like the chocolate and strawberry pastry.. Chicken patty is another speciality .. I have and will always have a soft spot for this place :)

What I can say bout this place one of the best cake shops in town. There are different variety of cakes , pastries , cookies. Spoilt for choices to be honest. Went for a new year's Chocolate Cake and an Almond Cake. Staff are a bit lazy and arrogant thats the only negative aspect orelse everything is wonderful.

Last year we went there to pick up a Christmas cake, the guy asked 'Dada order ache?', to which we replied NO, he gave us a look, 'then what are you doing here?'. But this year we managed to pick up few boxes, they are really awesome. No wonder people queue up here for Christmas cakes.

Well there are some places which doesn't require a review these places have been associated with Calcutta and now are associated with Kolkata since forever Nahoum & Sons is one such place.
Christmas or new year always mean cakes from nahoum I generally don't get through on Christmas eve so I always end up getting a nice plum or rich fruit for my new year .. I tend to start my new year on a sweeter note .

If it's Nahum then it has to be cakes an only cakes. They sell amazing and delicious cakes of various kinds. But at the same time they serve pathetic snacks. Being situation in the new market area, this place has its existence since the British era. I tried chicken patties there and unfortunately I had to throw it it's too bad and cannot be taken into. So never do the mistake of buying snacks from nahum if here, then go for cakes only.

Finally got the oppurtunity to visit this legendary bakery shop. Nahoum and Sons need to special description; the name has its own weight. Today visited this place with my family. On entering the shop,the smell of bakery items was so good. The aroma was itself like a nesha 😁 coming to the food, i took chicken patties,macaroons,chocolate pastries and brownies. The patties and macaroons were tasty. The quality of the chocolate pastries were good. Brownies were so good and yummmy. Just needed one scoop of ice cream on top of this brownie. If i come to Nahoums i will come for their brownies. Delicious. I loved their bakery stuffs. Hope to visit the place soon.

Regular at nahoum's whenever we visit new market area! This place was a bit tricky for me to locate when I first visited alone as it is situated among one of the numerous alleys of hogg market. The pink strawberry square cake with the black eye in the middle has my name on it every time I visit, whilst my mother takes the pineapple one, and my father and brother take the chocolate cakes. I've never had anything from nahoum apart from baked goods, so my review maybe a bit limited. Yes, we are also a nahoum's bread-hoarding family, I personally prefer their garlic bread over any other bakeries.

If its festive season then entire Kolkata goes to Nahoum. Christmas isn't complete without their Plum Cakes and Rich Fruit Cakes. In the modern era of pastry making art Nahoum is deep rooted with heritage and classic cake making. Its rustic and lacks glossy finishing or topping but the taste will rule over your heart. 
I liked their Plum Cake compared to Rich Fruit Cake. Along with that one can't afford to miss Rum Ball and Lemon Puff.
Cost will be cheaper compared to Cakes or Kookie Jar but remember it lacks cosmetic glossy finishing like recently formed pastry chains.
Ordering during rush hour is a bit challenge here. No bills were given or rather due to rush didn't get a chance to ask for the same.

Started by a Jewish family a long time back, Nahoum's has been keeping up with the tradition of serving the best cakes available in not just New Market area but the city too. Located inside new market, on one of the dingy lanes, this bakery is a treasure hunt. Try the Christmas cakes without a miss. Delicious when hot. Smells and tastes great. I tried the Chicken Puff and Chicken Patties too, they both tasted similar, with different shapes, as the minced chicken stuffing inside is the same, which they need to change. The prices are reasonable. One might have to wait in queue for some time to get what they need on special days. Overall, a great bakery!

Nahoums is a heritage in the field of bakery confectionery. Its cakes & pastries are mouth watering.
The must try is the Tuna Sandwich. It simply melts in the mouth. After finishing one, our minds ad taste buds always seeks for another; kind of a vicious circle.
The ambience is not good; located deep with in the labyrinths of New Market (aka Sir Stuart  Hogg Market - who designed the plans), this very old Jewish Bakery was founded in 1902 & moved into the New Market in 1916 and has remained the same ever since.
The interiors are though non appealing & predominantly a take away counter, it bakes some of the best cakes in town unparalleled in taste.

Still a regular here, it's a pity I missed the Christmas cakes this time. Oh yes, the biggest USP of  this place - the price and the amazing quality of the cakes you get for that price. :)

Firstly it is a sin that 23rd December, 15 was my first visit to this place. Around 5:30 I reached the F block of New Market and joined the queue. Quite shockingly I saw that at least 500 people were standing before me. Everyone was keeping their finger crossed whether they would win the trophy (i.e.the fruit cake) or not. After 1 hr finally I reached the counter and 2 no.s of Rich Fruit Cake (everyone was buying that only) which costs 250/-. Another variant i.e. light fruit cake was also available costing little less 220/- per 400gm piece.

People who love the smell of baked food and have a tooth for confectionary literally patronize this place .. serving calcutta and kolkata since 1902 this place doesn't need a review. People queue up to enter this bakery before christmas. Its the bakery for the mass ... nothing luxury as you see on lifestyle channels...nahoum's and sons ... baking happiness for a century...
PS if you happen to be in kolkata and really love that 'baked' flavour .. try their black forest and the tart.

Review is unnecessary for this confectioner. Christmas in Kolkata starts with Nahoum & Sons. 

My personal favourite is Rum ball. The chocolaty rum ball tastes heavenly. Just a bite and it melts in your mouth. 

Strawberry cake is another favourite. 

But for Christmas, Plum cake is a must. 

Nahoum & Sons has been established in 1902. Still now, they have managed to survive in glitzy world of cafes and bakeries. 

Same old taste and affordable pricing are the USP of this grand old confectioner in Kolkata.

Hopping through the lanes of New Market is a foodie’s delight to try everything right from Kolkata’s traditional food to its Jewish confectionaries. Nahoum and Sons, Kolkata’s famous Jewish Bakery in the New Market holds a special place in Kolkata confectionery. This place was established in early 1900s and is run today by the owner's grandson. However, finding this shop in the maze of other shops is quite a deal for a first timer like me. 

This is an excellent place in city’s New Market area with stacks of brownies, tarts and a wide spread variety of cakes, biscuits and pastries. It was indeed a delight to try their Jam tart and Plum Cakes. 
Nahoum and Sons still manages to stand the test of time with their classical offerings. Do try this place for a slice of history and confectionaries. You wouldn’t be disappointed.

This is my first visit to this place after hearing a lot from all round for years. I went on a weekday afternoon on the week before christmas. And we had a lot of difficulty finding this place amongst those small lanes of New market. First of all if u r going by a car be prepared to go around the place for good 15-20 minutes before u even find a parking space and even when u find a parking space; b prepared to shell out a whopping 50 bucks parking charge for each hour. Next wen we reached to this place it was a heavily crowded shop with no queues. People were jostling to reach the counter and finally wen we reached the counter after lot of "ElbowFights" ; people from behind started shouting "Aapnar holo" (R u done). We couldnt even ask what all was available and had to take whatever we could manage in those two minutes. To be very honest I saw the cake only after coming home, not before buying. 
So u can understand the kind of rush. 
But the kind of prices they charge is nothing less than other big cake shops and i would suggest u can visit this place if u want to bask in the nostalgic glory of the history of cakes of kolkata, else try other places, like Kookie jar or Cakes.

I absolutely adore their brownies. If I am in New Market, I always try to stop by and pick up a few of them. Apart from that, I love the fish pantras though you got to be really lucky to have them in stock. They are almost always over every time I visit. It's exquisite and packed with cheese. Apart from that the chicken puff is really nice. I also love their assortment of cookies like the raisin ones and the chocolate and orange ones. There was a point when I was working in Park Street where I used to walk over to Nahoum's every other day to buy their cookies and biscuits. It's very affordable and more than anything, each visit makes me tremendously nostalgic.

It's amazing to see how Kolkata's last Jewish confectionery Nahoum and Sons still holds its ground in this ever-changing world.Whenever I came into this place, it seemed that time had stopped.Located in Hogg market or more commonly known as New market, this shop is legendary in one word-and I don't know if it's for the choco-fudge or brownie that foodies still crave.It feels so nice to see that there are things in this city which even time doesn't dare to mingle.

It's a legendary bakery known to have it's existence for quite a long time. Located in New Market, the place is known for their pastries, tarts, cakes, biscuits, breads and other freshly baked items. The store attracts huge footfall as New Market shoppers stop-by for some of their delectable pastries.

Tried a couple of items from here, unfortunate all of those were fast food items. Since I live far from New Market, I would not want to take their pastries and mess them up halfway to my home while traveling. Anyways, when I visited them, I got myself some biscuits which were really nice and crisp. I enjoy them with my morning cup of coffee. Fast-food items include Chicken Patties, Chicken Puff and Fish Pantras. Chicken Patties and Puff both tasted same and were very compact in size. Fish Pantras was cheesy from inside, made up of fish crumbs. Overall, they make up very good evening snacks.

Pricing is very nominal, it's not the olden days pricing but will not hurt the pockets though. Ambiance wouldn't be the best if the store is crowded up to capacity.

In a nutshell, highly recommended. Would surely try their famous lemon tarts and rum balls someday :)

This should be declared as the dessert capital of india. The rum balls here are worth dying for. Also the cakes, pastries, buns, cookies, marzipan etc are far better than Flurry's. Set inside the crowded New Market with an old worldly charm this place houses the best patties, puffs and exceptional cheese samosas. Try their garlic bread, plum cakes and many other items. Packed some items for Delhi.

Nahoum is one of the oldest bekary in the town.first time i heard about the shop when in scl in an intervew of Mr. Anjan Dutta,so i hav quite an idea abt the historisity of the place. now starting wit the location u can say it s a hidden treasure as it s situated in the old newmarket.if u r a fresher jat go & ask anybody wil reach to the baked paradaise.well when i entered in the shop the stafs were really busy to pack some wedding cakes & it was my first time when i was perceiving a huge cake lik that.it was looking lik a beautiful goun for the bride.one word may b eligant.it s a very tiny place but as it s said big things come in small packages.i teasted their lagendary lemon tart according to the xprt advice.it was nice but what killed me was their chocolet fudge, chicken meo patti & almnd crm rol.i was so wishing if i can hav a slice from those magical wedding cakes😂😂. better to conclude being there is like being the part of the legasy.happy me😊😊

The first feeling when I walked into the shop....nostagia... An old English bakery, this place still continues to make cakes and bakes in the way it used to abt 15, 17 years ago. Well, that's only as far as my memory goes that is... I rember being a child n welcoming my father home to the smell of freshly baked heart cakes from Nahoums'. Good memories really... Having tried the confections 15 years later, I am still awstruck at the simplistic yet amazingly tasty treats they hav to offer. Great quality goods for such great prices!! N the variety! I only got to try the lemon tart, lemon puff, the almond pastry and the cheese cake there, but I'm definitely going back for more. Great shop. Great experience. Definitely worth a try.

The legendary confectionery shop located at the shopping centre of the city-Esplanade,is a nostalgic must visit for each and every Calcuttan. A wide variety of mouth watering pastries are available for all those with an extra sweet tooth. The lemon and chocolate tarts and Chocó éclairs are a must try amongst the other variables. Also it is fairly priced so overall it's a good destination to satiate that sugar rush. They have to however try a little harder to keep up with the contemporaries and not rely on nostalgia alone.

We tried , lemon puff, lemon tart, cheese puff and almond puff.
Loved all of them. The tart had a pastry base which is unlikely, and rest was typical British style baking.. Kind of my first.. 
This was a love at first sight.. 
Will go there again and again

It smells of old memories. Memories of Christmas cakes full of dry fruits, cookies (we called them biscuits at that time), fluffy pastries, birthday cakes......the very place reignites so many fond memories. Took one of my Keralian colleague to this place for making him taste a part of Kolkatas heritage. He was floored by the taste. If you are a true blue Kolkatan, you have visited this place at least once in your life.

Once I entered this place, thr smell took me to my childhood. The same smell of "cream cake" was all over the place and I got biased regarding this legendary cake shop.
Situated in the middle of  Hogg market, this place gives you a feeling of old days. Decor, wooden cash box all these things will remind you that you are in a 100 year old bakery. Only mosern thing I noticed was the refrigerator!
Now coming about food, we took pineaplle pastry ( I felt cake portion could have been more soft, cream was loaded with flavour), heart shaped plain cake ( With each bite, you can taste butter).
Nex time you are in New Market, please give it a try.

I have been visiting this outlet ever since I stepped in New Market. I love the sophisticated looks of the stall as well as the behaviour of the staff. I love rum balls here and time and again I have taken their bread sticks home to eat with soups. But my most favourite is their rich fruit cake. It is very difficult to procure one, because of its huge demand, but once you eat a piece of it, you will forget all other branded cakes and run for this one. This is one place where the service has not deteriorated as yet.

This place had been famous for its bakery in kolkata for decades. However I feel the quality of bakery has actually detoriated over the years . But still whenever I visit new market I alway have to visit this place. Today we tried out the famous pan cake which is basically the heart shaped cakes . Also the lemon tart which had a stink to it. The shopkeeper was kind enough not to take payment for the tart! We also tried out the sweet buns . They tasted very ordinary however I do have issues with their hygiene system. The cakes are all displayed in the open with flies everywhere! The pastries looked yummy but with flies all around them We didnot want to try them! This place needs to upgrade their hygiene standards. The chicken puff was fresh yet was too oily for me. We bought a pack of date sticks which tasted fine. The prices of this place as compared to the other baking shops in kolkata is much less and cheaper

Enter Hogg Market. Ask any shopkeeper for Nahoums and they will direct you!

The brownie is tasty.
The pastries have the right about of cream on it (Read: Not too much)

The winter plum cake is a must try!

I did not like the macaroons much!

It is pocket friendly and that is another reason to come back to Nahoums.

Now I will have Haters on Zomato for this review. I am going to be blunt, so I apologize to all Nahoum'ers out there. 
I am all for tradition and nostalgia but the Gourmand in me thinks otherwise. Nahoum has lost its steam. The pastries are bland and too one dimensional. The walnut brownie is lacking lustre in terms of the flavor. 
The macaroons have lost their sheen. The rum ball is obnoxious. That is what I felt about the food. However, as a Bangali, I will always be in love with Nahoum.

Puja shopping at new market is never really complete without stopping by nahoum n savoring the sticky moisty  black forest. I have had black forests from a lot of confectioners but nahoum still remains my favourite. Not to forget the rich fruit cakes in Christmas without which kolkata winters wouldn't be the same

The cakes served by this place is no doubt legendary, but the puff pastry I tried was way below expectations. The filling was in a semi-curry form, and the pastry too greasy. The overall experience just wasn't worth it.

This place stands for tradition. Christmas still means waiting with bated breath in the long queue outside Nahoum for its super delicious fruit cake. They also serve the best brownie in town. Besides these two, the rum ball and the garlic bread tastes quite nice. They used to offer masala bread which was equally scrumptious but sadly, it isn't available now. Highly recommended.

The puff pastries were really good at one time,but now the quality has degraded,the pastries are crumbly,the patties are dry,the fillings are of a poor quality, I used to love the cheese Patty but now it tastes more like  rock solid Patty and some sort of eraser textured cheese filled inside.On the whole I would prefer having biscuits that opting for Nahoum and Sons.

Christmas isn't complete without Nahoum's. It's just that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you enter their shop on the christmas eve. A fantastic cake shop for all your Christmas confectionery needs and a must for every Calcuttan during Christmas, it still has that vintage Calcutta feeling attached to it. You won't be finding many places around the city anymore which still have that nostalgia attached to them.

Nahoum's is a landmark. I've heard of mum and the singer, Anjan Dutta, lament the shutting down of D'Gama's. And I'd never want such an end for Nahoum's. Having said that, I must concede that nostalgia colours people's reviews. The quality of Nahoum's is not as good as it once was and I would know that because my birthday cakes without fail came from there every year - the cake would be in the shape of a huge number, corresponding to my age. This went on till I didn't want my neighbours to know what my age is! Today I would go back to Nahoum's perhaps only for their rum-balls and brownies. Those arguably are still the best in the city. And I'll go there every time I visit the city and can spare a couple of hours specially for New Market.

My visit to Nahoums was a much awaited one. I had been hearing glowing things about its confections. At the bakery, I had the lemon puff and cheese samosa, both of which were delicious. I would say that both were at must-try levels. The puff was warm, light, airy and aromatic with a lemon punch. That puff was everything! The samosa was a sinful indulgence. I took home their pineapple and strawberry pastries and chocolate log. The pastries were nothing to write home about. The log was marginally better but still chewy. Overall, underwhelming. My guess and hope is that the key was freshness. Until next time.

One of the oldest bakeries located in Kolkata. It is inside Hogg Market & if you ask anyone out there inside Hogg Market all of them will show you the direction to this old place. As we say "OLD IS GOLD" I would rather consider it to be a goldmine. They are special for their fruit cakes & if you go there during the christmas time, you will find that their stocks are over. Other than that, their Blackforest Cake is a must try. Their Lemon Tart & Chocolate Tart are gems of the menu. Keeping sweet on the side, if we talk about the savourey, their Chicken Patties is pretty good. You can also try their Cheese Samosa, Fish Roll & Cheese Puff. But my most favourite is the Sweet Bun & The Jam Bun. A must try for each & everyone.

Cheese pattice was crisp, almond tart was perfectly nutty, black forest cake was different from the common ones. Since this place dates back a hundred years almost it's a must visit place.

Serving for 111 years this is a legendary bakery shop of Kolkata. This is the best bakery shop and favourite of mine. Everything they offer is great. Price is unbelievably reasonable. The biscuits,cookies,patties,bread,choco fudge,snacks are of the old reciepe and satisfy our taste buds. All the items specially the garlic bread is very much in demand and is hardly available after noon. They offer the best brownies ever. On christmas eve you have to wait in a long que to avail the best cakes even if you go on 10 a.m. The decoration is very simple,everything is old school and traditional. The quality is unbeatable. They do not have any seating arrangement.

This place dates back to the history of Kolkata, when it was a British capital. The shop possess the old day charm and has hardly been renovated. 
The place is clean and have a aromatic feel of fresh baked cakes. 
Their palm and fruit cakes are famous. 
But yes the quality has deteriorated a bit
When I went last day I had one heart cake, one chocolate swiss roll, one chicken puff. 
The heart cake was awesome, buttery and soft. The chicken puff was also good but there was no chicken piece, it was all ground meat. The chocolate swiss roll was not that good, the cake was rubberish and the chocolate cream was not that great. 

The place gives a historical touch to your pallets but in recent times many other confectioners have opened up.

It's a name which is intrinsically related to a lot of Kolkatans' childhood memories, including mine. The place still manages to cash in on its old world charm and has not bogged down to the spurt of innumerable bakeries in the city. 
All their sweet products are a little overtly sweet and sugary. But I absolutely love their brownie. 
You could give their savouries a miss. But their biscuits and vanilla and chocolate fudges are worth trying.

The Jewish confectioner Nahoum's in the New Market holds an uncommon place in Kolkata (Situated in one of the numerous alleys of S.S Hogg market) confectionery. Established in 1902, Nahoum's moved to its present area in the New Market in 1916. It is run today by the first proprietor's grandson, David Nahoum. A Jewish wedding in Kolkata following a crevice of 50 years in the 1990s got a considerable measure of media consideration. After the foundation of Israel, numerous Kolkatan Jews left to live in Israel and the span of the Jewish group had an extreme decrease. Nahoum & Sons (estd. 1902) is genuinely notable, with its unique mahogany cabinetry and marble counters. For over a century, a great many clients have sworn by Nahoum's Rich Fruit cake, its brownies, marzipan, macaroons and a great deal more. Imperial Confectioners and D Gama compete for a close second and third place.

I love their fruit cake that they sell during the festive season. You can taste additionally with Plum cakes, treats and mince pies, tart and Chicken mayonnaise. Each time I'm in Kolkata, I always remember to visit this spot.

I was introduced to Nahoum's during my childhood days, which was like 20- 23 years ago, by father.
And today it's very disappointing to say that Nahoum's has totally lost that charm.
I think today we have plenty of other beautiful cake shops serving outstanding cakes and pastries and Nahoum's have lost this competition to them.

It would be really nice seeing Nahoum's spring back to life. Not only for me, but for plenty others as well.
It's a place filled with immense nostalgia for every Kolkatans.

Nahoum and Sons is old school. It reminded me of the old stores in Nainital. Don't they just smell wonderful? It takes you back in the memory lane to those sneaky glances and long lost laughter. It was an impromptu visit. We went to Esplanade in search of an outlet that had shut down, so to overcome the disappointment we went to Nahoum and Sons. Don't ask me for the names because I don't know any. The icing on the pastries was a little sweet but the cake sponge inside. Waaaaahh. It was amazing. So goood. Reminded me of my home. I ate the veg patty too. Yumm. Proper Boarding School stuff! 
Too much missing happened in this bakery. Definitely going back!!

Nahoum and Sons is undoubtedly one of the brightest chapter in the history of kolkata's food heritage..A true legend in all sense I don't thinks any comprehensive study of the culture and history of this City can be completed without a special mention of this century old Bakery..Situated in Hogg Market this place amidst all the fuss of globalisation is still run by the descendants of Jesus Christ,the original Jewish community of Kolkata..In fact if you want to visit the Magen David Synagogue at Ezra Street you need to get a written permission from this place only.. My association with this place has been for 4 generations and even before I developed my senses I have actually grown a taste bud for their cakes.. I haven't spend a single Christmas in last 20 years without their signature Rich Plum Cake..I also adore their Rich Fruit Cake..Other favourite items includes their Sandwiches,Minced fruit tarts and their in-house cookies..Even today if you visit Hogg Market surely the mesmerising and sinful smell of butter and fresh baked cakes will catch your nose and it will lead you to this shop even without knowing the path..Having said everything I guess their most important aspect lies in the fact they have actually never compromised with their raw materials and at the same time not incrasing the rates too much..I guess this has been the major factor behind their ever increasing popularity..

How does one describe a place that has been a part of your growing up years like your school or a playground? You can probably describe its physical dimensions but how will you put to word the feeling that the place invokes in you- the joy of running your tongue over the sticky chocolate fudge stuck between your teeth, the heartbreak of unwrapping a meticulously-wrapped easter hamper? Nahoums,a buzzing, glass walled island of brownies, tarts and fruit cakes in Kolkata’s iconic New Market, is a storehouse of many such feelings. The decor is bare minimum, in fact Nahoums is the sort of place where you are expected to wold down your lemon tart standing while the helpers pack your box of savouries. Aluminium trays full of fershly-made goodies are displayed on the shop window and you are expected to choose your pastry without the help of a menu and in met cases, name tags. The almond pastry looks puzzlingly similar to the cheese cake, but regulars aren't complaining. They swoop down, gobble up and leave with quaint white boxes full of Nahoum staples like brownies and rich fruit cakes.

One of the oldest bakery in the city and also one of my all time favorites. Great cakes and pastries with an unique taste. This is one of the places I visit every time I go to New Market. The shop is quite old but I really like the ambiance of it. The Queen's cake is something which I would personally suggest everyone to try. Its a simple heart shaped cake without any cream or icing but its really delicious and has got a nice fragrance to it. Every year at least one of my family members would get their birthday cake from here. The birthday cakes are excellent and they pack them really nicely with care so that you can carry them a long distance without worrying about getting it damaged on the way home.

My visit to the iconic SS Hogg Market isn't complete unless I peek into nahoum bakery. Although, the enterprise has lost its shine n glamour to a large extent, one is inevitably drawn to it due to the gastronomical memories attached to this place. In its hay days, the smell of freshly baked goods would waft through the alleys of New market, now it's just of  lingering melancholy n decadence.
Nahoum springs to life during Christmas n New year's,and is a favourite for patrons like me, since I love their ginger bread, cookies, rum balls, plum cakes,and lemon tarts.
I do hope that it finds its footing. New market is no fun when the nahoum shutter are down.

You can never go to new market but not go to Nahoum's! If you disagree, please visit Nahoum's when you are at new market the next time... and the trend will continue!

Nahoum's will hopefully never lose its old world charm along with those lovely bakery items.  The moment you enter their quaint and under illuminated shop in new market, the aroma hits your nostrils.  You can NEVER MISS the freshness of their items.

Mostly, it is their brownies, cookies, pan cakes and patties that hog the limelight.  And i have NEVER had to complain thus far.  While the aroma fills your senses, the delicious cookies and pastries will fill your belly before you know!!

The best thing about nahoum's is that they have not tried to modernize just to keep up with the latest fashion. Yet, the footf
all at their shop is still alive on any weekend.....just like any other modern eatery. They have maintained their USP - fresh and tasty bakeries and confectionery items...and that is all that i care about.

Nahoums is not a fancy and jazzy outlet...and it blends perfectly with new market and with that old calcutta charm!

If you are having a tiring day shopping, at new market this is the place to get an energy refill. Personally, being a chocolate person my favourite is the chocolate tart. Theres just something about the hint of orange in it that makes it soo yummy. The almond tart is definitely a must try. I'd recommend the rum ball and swiss roll too. Didnt like the savoury much however. Their famous plum cake is good too but be warned.. the line for that spirals upto to the entrance of new market during christmas time.

Ah Nahoum's. Deep in the heart of new market, this place has become a must every time I go to Esplanade. 
Just opposite Little Shop, the store welcomes you, urges you to try the delectables. 
The lemon puff and lemon tarts are impeccable. Slightly tangy yet sweet. Rum balls are yet another jewel in the nahoum's. Chocolate fudge is another thing to try. 
The staff are extremely nice. After a long day of shopping, you just want to keep on stuffing yourself with sweets all day long.

This age old bakery shop is located inside Hogg Saheb er bazaar popularly known as New Market! They are famous for their deliciously baked fresh muffins, they have them in different shapes too! During Christmas time their fruits cakes are something which everyone should try out. As the winter sets in, it's difficult to even enter this place, it's crowded like anything, people travel from different places from all over the town and even outside just to try them out! The pastries are literally sold like hot pancakes and there's not even a place to stand properly, lot of chaos lot of pushing and shoving! But it's fun to finally have super delicious goodies! It has become more of a tradition year after year since my childhood to have their freshly baked rum cakes every new year. It's an age old gem and Kolkata is lucky to have such a fine confectionary!

I have been eating Nahoum Cakes since my childhood days, and its been a tradition to have their fruit and plum cakes every Christmas.. But sadly, I don't find their other preparations to be quite as good nowadays, and with so many other options available today, we don't opt for Nahoum..Their famous lemon tart is average, there is nothing special about it, and so is their Rum Ball. Was thoroughly disappointed the other day when I had two of their most famous dishes and found them to be over-hyped.
The ones which I did like were their Jelly Tarts, their cakes and brownies. They make the best chocolate brownies and fudges I have ever tasted and that is the only thing for which I go back there.

This quaint bakery is tucked away in new market but can be found out easily.

The look of the shop is quite shabby.
The food items though are very very tasty.Very.The chocolate brownie.Their biscuits are also nice.
The price is just a tad little high,but the awesome quality you get is totally worth it.

Bakery which will remind you of your mother's kitchen . The succulent rum balls , the strawberry cubes and the pies are awesome . The vintage chicken / mutton patty , the cheese puffs , the quiche will make your taste buds secrete the gastronomic juices . I tasted the garlic bread which is probably the best with the dollops of butter melting along with pepper and Garlic in your mouth with each bite is divine ...... The spring onion crackers and cheese sticks can just be okay but they are good to be considered as stand by players ...........

Nahoum's as we all have heard of it is one of the most renowned bakeries in town. I think it was good once, during the early days of it. But now, I don't find anything special in it. Yes, they have a variety in their confectionery items but the quality they serve is almost equal to any local bakery. I have tried their fresh pineapple slices, black forest cake, macaroons and cookies. They are nothing extraordinary. These days, Kolkata is experiencing an exotic journey of new bakeries with very good quality of confection and needs no criticism. I think this might be the reason for me why Nahoum has fallen back in the race in my eyes, probably in the reality. Thank you.

Always brings an essence of nostalgia. To top it, the country and folk tunes playing right next to it, this bakery is a must for anyone who loves to eat (or not to). My personal favorite would always be the Chocolate Eclairs cake. Rich and stuffed, this cake brings ultimate foodgasm. As for the other stuff, each and every one of them is a gem. 
Nahoum and sons, you will always bring a smile to my face.

Nahoum is situated at new market, is one of the oldest bakery of Kolkata. Remember visting there with my grandma and eating pastries, cakes, puffs and etcetera. Stepping into it the odour of freshly baked breads and cakes will hit up your nostrils. And you will feel like staying here. The taste are good and something which is tasty is something I love.. So come and try out experimenting here too

I remember going thete with my parents when i was in dchool and now i take my son thete. That us the kind of connrct that this institution have to iuf lives. New Market has lost most of its charm for shopping in the eake of thd hawkers menace but we go back there ptimarily to buy stuff from Nahoum's. I do not want to say much about ghe cakes and pastries, the bisvuits and breads or the patties and crackers. I am heavily biased, not only for nostalgic value but also fir the sheer retention of quality, taste and affordability that Nshoum's has maintained for generations.

Even the patties and puffs are same as the first time I tasted 25 years back.

Situated within Sir Stuart Hogg Market, serving good quality bakery items since 1902. Cant compare its past and present but old charm is still there and its one of a kind in kolkata. 

Theres no sitting arrangements, its a take away shop with old israel decor. 

I have tried few of their items but not all. Out of those, i love their brownie, which is a perfect one.

Must visit, specially during christmas for their cakes.

Most people will argue that it is a over rated iconic shop now. But i will say you will get exactly what you paid for.

A must try if you are a pastry lover....

Nahoum&Sons.. few places are still left in Calcutta that maintains that vintage link with 60s 70s wala Calcutta and Nahoum and Sons are one of them.. Being a newcomer to Calcutta I heard many things about this place.. So in 2014 when I was old enough to have a little bit of cash with me I visited this place.. The moment u enter, the smells of all the goodies wafts around u.. The interiors was exactly as I imagined.. The family that runs that place are very friendly and makes u feel like u know them since long! I took two loafs of bread, one gooseberry Jam, Chocolate cake and the Lemon tarts.. And as expected!!! These were one of the best cakes and tarts I had ever tasted.. U could literally taste the honesty and love with which it is made.. Reason enough to keep bringing me here again and again

A wonderful place, I still feel (and behave) like a kid in a candy store every time I enter this shop. Old world ambience. Amazing rich fruit cakes and plum cakes... definitely the best in town, far better and much cheaper than the stuff sold by Kookie Jar, Flurys, Cakes and the like....and the cinnamon buns and the rum balls and, of course, the brownies, which are one of a kind. I must say, Nahoum is not just a dessert shop, its an experience.

Over-rated in my opinion. At least from what I have seen. Some of the items are still good, but sentimental value is to be found in greater amounts than quality when one sees people crowding the place. I really liked their brownie though and my friend is almost crazy about it. But even she did not dare to taste the gooey-looking pastries on display.

Nahoum's started in 1902 by Nahoum Israel and stands tall with all its glory at Sir Stuart Hogg Market. I believe the shop epitomises the old world charm like no other place in Kolkata. The archaic dark wooden cabinets and marble tops can surely bring you back to the days of yore. A visit to New market, even today, is incomplete without a quick stop at Nahoum's.  Rarely when I don't get time to pick up goodies, I make sure to just go past this shop, just to catch a glimpse and get the rich aroma. Such is the beauty of this Culinary Institution. 

Ambience: Needless to say I adore the historic setting. 

Food: I have tried a range of there products throught my life but there are somethings that you cannot miss if you are here for the first time.

Rum Ball: Perfect rum soaked balls of heaven on earth. The best rum ball that I've tasted so far. 

Brownie: Very soft with perfect sweetness and I love it warm with vanilla ice cream, if I save some for home.

Rich Fruit Cake: The massive queue just before christmas is a living example of how  LEGENDARY the product is. Hats off for maintaining the quality of the cake, truest to the original, even after more than a century, that can be easily vouched by many senior connoisseurs. I love it. 

Price: Its not at all heavy on pocket, as I consider institutions like these, in any city around the globe, as serving priceless piece of art worth cherishing for life.

A heritage bakery. Over rated. The idea of such an old bakery which is still active is the main attraction I think and its quite fun to be at Nahoum, always bustling. However the food is absolutely below average. Stick to the basics like plain butter cake or may be a plum cake if you really want to try something. Visit to experience Nahoum, the bakery but not the items.

There are very few true blue Kolkatans who has not tasted delicacies from Nahoum's..  Nahoum's is a must stop whenever I have visited New Market.. Its pastries have an altogether different feeling.. The taste, the smell is entirely unique to them and cannot be found in any of the newer bakeries that have come in the city.... If you are in Kolkata you have to  taste the goodies from the Nahoum's... My Personal Favorite the Swiss rolls... :)

Nahoms remains one of the iconic outlets of Cal. Its been around since.....Ever it seems.You cant visit new market and not stop over for some delectable Black Forest , Fruit cake or a really gooooey eclair.The flakey patties and soft fresh pastries,eclair rolls,and not to miss the yummy Green mints.Christmas time is when you just have to go and pickup some fruit cakes,plum pudding,mince pies patties,tarts and take them home for the family--its the done thing. Nahom takes you back to yesteryears--its aura and very aroma is different unlike the fancy new joints comeup in town.Strong advice--dont miss out on tasting the goodies at Nahoms.

I went there after reading reviews on zomato. Having a sweet tooth I really wanted to visit this place. Situated inside new market,  parking is a big problem. However, I managed to park the car at a distant just to try this out. It wasn't a disappointment. You'll like it if you want to try traditional bakery stuff. I liked the brownie and black forest. I got some for my family but nobody liked it. You'll like it if you like the kind of pastries available in flurrys!

Nahaum name is enough. I don't think anyone who has lived here in Calcutta have never heard of the name or ever ate here. I have been coming here since I don't know when. As a child the brownies n cakes of nahoum were my absolute favourites. The place has not changed at all from the decor to the shop but one thing thankfully that has not Changed is the amazing taste. I simply love nahoum at Christmas and when im away from home during Christmas nahoums plum cakes is what I miss the most.

This is one of the legendary places in Kolkata which is situated in the heart of the bustling New Market. It reeks of old world charm with some amazing bakery items, breads and pasteries that is set in a very old fashioned decor. We have been visiting this place ever since I can recall and my most favourite is the Cheese Straws that we would buy in huge quantities and take it in my school tiffin. Even now, whenever I am visiting New Market, I always get drawn to this place and end up buying something or the other to take back home. Its that nostalgia which keeps me coming back to this place over and over again. I highly recommend this place to everyone ...

It is truly legendary as this is supposed to be the place that entire Calcutta was looking forward to, each Christmas. That was, of course, 1950. 

Come 2015, Nahoums struggles for existence. Located in the same place at New Market, I wonder why they never considered moving out or creating outlets. New Market has long given away the most-visited-place position to either City Centre or South City. 

The usual picks here are the Christmas Cakes right before the Christmas date. You find cookies too, but nothing really catches the same craziness for a Nahoum' cake today.

Wanted to try this place for long. Finally went to this legendary place yesterday with a friend. The variety of items gave us a hard time choosing from them as each one of them looked really delicious and we wanted to try everything on the chart. But as ours was a post-lunch venture, we were already full and only managed to order Chocolate Eclairs and Chocolate Pastry. And yes I must say, we loved the taste and quality of what they serve from the very first bite. 
The interior is very simple without any unnecessary bit of decoration. Apparently, you won't get a break to notice those details as those mouth-watering delicacies will not allow you to move your eyes to anywhere else.
I found this place to be a tiiiiiiiny(very, very little) bit costly at first, but it was justified by the quality of what we got.

Before I start my review I would like to quote Isaac Nahoum, the brother of David Elias Nahoum boasting confidently to a lady at the counter who was confused of so many varieties available,
"My dear, they say this is the best cake shop in the city, pick whatever your heart says, you won't get disappointed."

That's Nahoum and Sons for you! After David passed away on March 2013, the family said that the legend will live on. His brother Isaac is carrying on the mantle.

For more than a century, Kolkata's Christmas has remained incomplete without Nahoum's crunchy brownies, delectable cheese muffins and delicious pastries. For thousands of their fans, Christmas is incomplete without their plum cakes and rich fruit cakes. Located right in the heart of New Market, it has been one of the most famous confectioneries of the region for half-a-century. A visit to New Market is by default a visit to Nahoums; this has been the routine for as long as I can remember. Their cakes and savouries retained their quality through the years. Though a bit pricey, but David and Isaac ensured that the Nahoum's brand was never tarnished.

This is a place full of nostalgia. Very busy during festive times. Very very reasonable cost of items. Excellent cakes, chicken and mutton pastries, puff pastries,  cream rolls, different tarts, éclairs, plum cake and many many more. Always has a standard taste. Ever dependable though not mind blowing . A bit dark and congested old school  arrangement inside the big room. No seating options. The old guard along with some new staffs are polite and full of suggestions and friendliness. A rock and a landmark in Kolkata culinary scene since ages. A must eat place among bakeries. I have been going there from 1982 with my father and mother- now almost  33 yrs and I am always happy. Highly recommended.

Probably the best time to go is right now ie the festive holiday season. My mother frequented this place in her childhood, but I have been here only a few times. They still have that old school goodness about them without compromising on price or quality. Just a tad too traditional maybe for today's desserts crowd.

There isnt a thing that hasnt been said about Nahoums and I wnt be the last one to say good things about it. Visiting Nahoums and savouring the goodies is like biting into a slice of history. I have had fruit and plum cakes from Nahoums since I can remember. 
After ages, I got to visit this historic bakery before Christmas this year to pick.up the lovely fruit cake. However, the lady(possibly one of the owners, since its a family run business) suggested that I opt for the special Christmas cake which is baked only during this time of the year. Its priced economically at INR 375 Ffor 400gms, much cheaper than tge offerings from most elite bakeries. It was awesome. My family finished it off before Christmas itself and I had to get a replacement for Christmas. 
I also had chicken patties, mince pie and lemon puff. The chicken patties was good. The lemon puff at INR 35 is one of the best in town. The showstealer however, was the mince pie. Its different from most other pies available with a generous dose of raisins, currants, nuts, etc. I believe they prepare these goodies till the year end and Im surely going again to gorge on the mince pie.

The shop is associated with the childhood memories of all the calcuttans.
May be the shop has not changed its look since ages, but that is the usp of the shop. you become a child when you enter.Rich plum cake and chicken patties are the best items along with rich fruit cake and lemon tarts.
The best part is the service.

Should visit this shop once. Antique. 

Run by a group of Jewish people (no racial attack intended) this antique shop in New Market gives the perfect essence of baked food. The main personae behind this shop are David, Norman and Solomon Nahoum. Nahoum's specialises in boulangerie and patisserie. With a history that dates back to a time very old, Nahoum's has been providing quality food. My mother and aunt has grown up tasting its products and so have I. Favourite ones are Chicken Patty, Chocolate Brownie, Lemon sponge, and Cheese cake. But I liked the taste more when I was small. About fifteen to twenty years back or even before that, a birthday cake from Nahoum's would be a huge thing.

A recent visit to this good ol' and oh-so-popular bakery was a bit of a dissatisfaction. The cakes no doubt as nice as ever. I specially loved the 'heart cake' but I tried one pineapple pastry which was not at all up-to the mark. Now coming to the patties, the chicken patties tastes and smells strange and totally not chicken-like and they put egg in vegetable patties!!!! Nahoum was frequented by my parents whom I accompanied as a child when we resided in Sealdah and now after so many years I had gone there with very high hopes, but returned with a bit of a disappointment.

Just in time for Christmas to write a review for them. :)
But this legendary pastry shop needs no review. They have curved out a name for themselves over decades. My first memory of Nahoum's is from my grand father who bought their very famous fruit cake for me every Christmas. 

The first time I went there was with friends though. After a never ending shopping exploration in New Market, we finally found this old-world charm of a pastry shop tucked inside Sir Stuart Hogg Market. Right from the moment we entered, it was love at first sight. The smell of fresh made bread and cookies. The goodies waiting on the glass shelf just waiting to be picked up by the hundreds of people gathered inside the shop. 

We decided for chocolate brownie , lemon tart and rumball. The lemon tart was vibrant with a perfect balance. The crust was soft and melted right away in your mouth. The rumball was decent. But, the winner was the chocolate brownie . It can still beat the choc brownies from all the famous cafes and delis mushroomed in every corner of the city. 

Christmas feels incomplete without their fruit cake or their rich plum cake. And, most importantly,  it reminds me of my grand father holding their cake and singing 'Merry Christmas' for me. :)

Over a period of time, the place has deteriorated. Also with so many competitors around the city they should work hard to bring back the standards and restore the glory of the place,as its famous not only in Kolkata,but across India.
The pastries are OK. Brownies are good. Lemon tarts are nice. Though none of the stuffs are best in the city.
Price is reasonable.

One of the most popular and legendary bakery of Kolkata located in the ever popular New market area is Nahoums and Sons known for their awesome bakery items. Among all the savouries they offer, my most favourite is the Chocolate brownie. Pricing is right. though i feel that they have deteoriarated  their quality a bit which they need to check.

OK first of all my review is based on just two items. Strawberry cake and cheesebun. Strawberry cake was aweful!!! Those typical dalda/vanaspati cream cakes we used to get those days at cheap bakeries at our very own gullies was what I was reminded of, yes my childhood!!! I would in fact give a 2.5 but the lovely perfect texture and yummy taste of the cheesebuns put up the score by 0.5!! Sorry folks! I find a lot of u all getting reminded of childhood, nostalgia n blah blah but my take is that Cakes or kookie jar are way better for a couple more bucks extra...at least u re not downing a dollop of vanaspati!
Ah yes! M adding some more of my comments regarding this sprung onion cookies/crisps. On the first day it did taste premium... Yet I insisted to my husband that this too had vegetable shortening/vanaspati aka dalda when he said there was no way nahoum would have such an unhealthy n dangerous ingredient. A couple days later I was proven right. The cookies started tasting dalda...with a thick white layer forming a layer/film on the insides of your upper jaws after just a bite!!!
Ewwww!
A bakery of such history could afford to use butter n bake! Anyway its us who pay for it... Why not give us healthier stuff ??!

This place was the only reason for me too beg my parent's to take me along with them for visits to new market.  Quietly undergo the torturous boredom of shopping and pushing crowd.  Because after the crowd and incessant shops for seemingly unending purchases, when I walled into the ancient and time ravaged establishment of nahoum's I knew that this was my reward for all the trials.  Soft and mouth watering patty's and pastries erased your exhaustion and boredom and put your mind at peace for another round of shopping spree.

Nahoum and Sons, sounds like childhood to me. My mother would always visit New Market for whatever reason and would bribe me and my sister to accompany her by promising us to visit this legendary Jewish bakery. It was that magical part of New Market that did not smell like meat or hair. Everything from the pastries to the Easter egg is wonderful, but the ones i distinctly remember lovinggg and still crave for were the chocolate and vanilla fudges, the brownie and the mint sweets. AMAZING. I haven't been able to find any fudge anywhere in the country that delicious. Im dying to visit Calcutta again, with only one intention - Nahoums.

I was introduced to this place by my mother, and since childhood i visit this place regularly. As a matter of fact my mom was first acquianted to this treasure by my grandfather when she was in school. So savouring their delights is a tradition to us. This place holds a very special emotional integrity in my heart. Christmas doesn't feels like christmas at all if we don't get to smell the aroma of nahoum's rich plum cake. Though this place is not at all visually attractive but it has got something which always keeps bringing you back. If by any reason i go nearby new market area i never fail to drop by to nahoum to grab their legendary "fish pantry"  "brownies" and "jam tarts". Though this place is over a century old which was founded by a Jewish person named Nahoum Israel from Baghdad and after his demise the reign was taken over by his son Elias and then David. I have got my personal experience of eating from here for more than 15 years and till date it always stood up to my expectations. They never compromised with the quality of their offerings and perhaps that is the reason why inspite of sticking to their vintage layout and interiors it never failed to satisfy anyone's desire. Those who had never been here please do drop by incan assure you one thing that you will keep coming back Nahoum is not just a name of confectioner but an integral part of kolkata's culture. Nahoum is a century old legacy.
It never comprimised in satisfying our palletes for ages. Nahoum is synonym to pride and nostalgia. 
#good lord writing this review just fostered my temptation to indulge into the mesmerising paradox of their brownies... Hell yeah i am grabbing a couple or two tomorrow for sure...

During all my visits to the ever favourite New Market, I have always made it a point to step into this visually unassuming shop, with subtle colonial features and the aroma of fresh baked cakes and brownies. Old people selling great stuff, with a homely feel and of course cheaper than all those fancy cafes. You save a few hundred bucks by compromising on secondary features like ambience and air conditioning, but you gain a permanent liking for original bakery tidbits. The chocolate brownies are a fast seller and they rock!

nahoums- the legendary nostalgia...this age-old shoppe in new market has so many childhood memories attached to it..no Christmas wud hv been complete without nahoum's rich fruit cake and rum balls...also whenever we visited new market, it was our duty to pay a visit to our favourite confectionery...their breads n black forest have also bn equally good...
however all my praise bears the PAST tense tag with it bcz in recent times there has bn some deterioration in their quality...the charm is somewhat missing...hope this is a temporary one and the original Nahoum will return in no time to revive my childhood fantasy...

My mother always brought these sweet treats anf made our days so wonderful. One day, about 5 - 6 yrs ago, I tried their Black Forest cake, I couldn't resist and bought all the cakes that day. The best Black Forest I have ever had. Even though I rated 5 ( I wish I could rate you more), but you are a part of my beautiful memories..... so you are beyond any rating!!!

Still basking in past glory!
I remeber this quaint lil shop tucked away in one corner of Old New Market from my early years, we used to go Pujo shopping and at the end tired exhausted we used to binge on those big choclaty 'rum balls'! What luxury!
Recently had a chance to go back again and all i saw was a dark dingy shop, those rum balls intact but i felt a tad stale, the 'black forest' not the same...with the cookie jars and cakes of the world i feel Nahoum's has been pushed aside as a mere HERITAGE! 
Time they should have a come back, not a good feeling to see my happy childhood memories disappear.

NAHOUM brings back nostalgia & special childhood memories. My memories of New Market is associated with this place. Dad would brings goodies from here while returning from his office when I was a kid. The pastries, biscuits, cookies, cakes & patties were incredible. Its the heart of New Market.

My favourites include the famous Rum-ball pastry cake, strawberry cake, chocolate cake and Chicken patties. Pineapple pastry  and Tarts are also good. 
There's good variety of cakes and pastries here.

Christmas time is the best here 'coz the variety of cakes and pastries increase and the crowd is too large to control then. 
But now I feel that the quality of food has degraded a lot. The butter in the pastries sticks to your teeth/tongue after eating. It seems that its Dalda. That's why I prefer eating the patties now, they give a large amount of tasty fish/chicken inside the patty.
A must visit for all people & kids out there. Bon Apetite!

Have been here a couple of times, with my mother. Pastries are too sugary and dreadfully dry. Not the jolliest of shop owners also. Nostalgia seems to be its sole bargaining chip, and yet, that is what keeps it from evolving to 21st century standards....needless to say, the dark and damp interior doesn't make things easier.

After a decade I was there at Nahum's. Why I say it as a decade is, I knew the name Nahum when my Grand father used to take me to the new market to buy a loaf at Nahum and it used to be on wednesday evening. And I loved that loaf more than anything in this world. It was almost 25 years back. And one fine day when I was there at the new market with my son I holded his hands and went to the Nahums. The place remains the same, the furnitures remain the same, the only thing which had changed are the people over the years. I asked for a french loaf to the person at the counter and the person replied " Sir kitney dino baad aa rahey ho?". I replied after 25 years, and he started smiling and said sir there is a lot which has changed over these years. They do not offer that special french loaf. So I decided to go with some brownies, some pastries and my favourite plum cake.

The pastries were OK, the plum cake was really rich and nice, both me and my son enjoyed a bit of all. Will miss out the special french loaf.

Did I miss something? Been there a couple of times. The freshly baked cake smelling of butter was good. But rest of the stuff - brownies, patties, tarts/pastries are quite ordinary. Being legendary, carrying loads of nostalgia etc. is all fine but a bakery (or for that matter any eatery) should be rated by the quality of the stuff they sell. I love simple yet delicious food but this bakery seems to have lost the script. I'm disappointed and won't be queuing up during Christmas for sure.

I simply visit this place for their Brownie's. And most of the time I have my sister bringing me two of these delicious packets to light up my mood. And guess what I have one of them lying beside me while I am writing this review. You spend 30 bucks (as of now) and end up thinking the calories are totally worth it. Well I guess I had the luck to taste their fruit cakes few times but not during the Christmas holidays. There is a huge queue during the winter holidays and honestly I never liked the idea of waiting in a queue to get my food served. Oh and by the way I always hated Rum balls, because of a very bad incident, but that day when my sister bought one, it was pretty good, flavour of orange peels seemed rather prominent but in a good way. But the place is rather stuffy, located in the old new market and that is another reason why I like to take away my brownies.

This has always been my favourite and I swear by their jam tarts and lemon tarts. But last time I just had two lemon tarts and as I did not have change I gave a 500 rupees note. The lady at the cash counter BEHAVED extremely rude with me. This kind of behaviour will put off the most ardent of patrons.

Never in my life did I ever imagine kolkata's oldest bakery will be ranking amongst the newbie bakeries. The decor , the ambience is nil as compared to that of au bon pain , but the freshness and goodness still remains intact . What drives people to nahoum?? The sheer nostalgia and the softness of the bread and cake base. The chocolate , strawberry pastries I can die for. The base simply melts in the mouth. The chocolate truffles, I love. What I find phenomenal is the custard crème roll. Its highly recommended. U heat it up a beat in the microwave and you will have the best ever feeling of your life. The choco tarts and sweet tarts are great in taste. The sweet buns and the garlic breads is the best in town. The Christmas plum cakes are tasty and soft and supple. I love the plums. I want that to be available throughout the year. The cheese patties also tastes equally awesome. I actually do not know of any item at nahoum that doesnt taste great. Its mystical that such a great eatery exists at a shabby corner of hogg market.

It reminded me of my childhood when i used to come with my parents holding their hands.. Whenever we visited new market, baba didn't forget ever to take me to this joint. Time has passed but this joint has remained the same as before. We ordered cheese roll, chocolate pastry and sweet tart. I loved them all as usual. The quality and taste were as great as before and made me realise nothing has changed.

The name is synonymous to Christmas cakes at our place. Since decades, we religiously fetch a cake from Nahoums during Christmas.  The quality control is indeed appreciable. The same taste, same flavor, same smell.... so distinct..... so typical..... so perfect...... Cakes from Nahoum is something to die for.  Kudos to team Nahoum for baking cakes to die for. No CAKES or SUGAR n SPICE can beat you.

Yes, the oldest bakery in town. It's always a treat to the buds to have brownies from this place. And, luckily it is close to my college. And, I drop in now and then for brownies. Don't go after the decors, and you will surely not be disappointed with their desserts. However, am yet to try out the others things that they sell. I am sure, I would like it as much as I liked their brownies.

NAHOUM AND SONS, a place which has a lot of history associated with itself and its food. Located in the deep corners of Hare Market this place is a delight for people who love pastries and cookies. Though the place dose not look appealing in the first visit but once you become aware about the history of this place you will start enjoying the desserts much more. Have been to this place during Christmas when the whole of New Market is alive with shoppers and trust me that experience was worth remembering.

I am a lover of pastries and i like fresh cream on my pastries,nothing else and the pastries have to be soft. I took a pineapple pastry here and didn't get the above two. Hard cake and dalda cream !
I tried one chicken patties and was not impressed as well.
So all in all I did not find this to be a very  apealling place and also the people here have to be told a hundred times what you want !

I remember going with my parents to New Market for shopping on one condition... that i want to eat at Nahoums :) The aroma of this place is bound to attract you once you are inside the complex. Best part of them is that the food quality has been consistent over so many decades. I love the rum ball cakes here and also the chicken patties and the chocolate pastries and the strawberry pastries and the pineapple... OMG the list will just go on and on :p If you are on a visit to the city please do visit here and make sure you pack a few items for your loved ones back home.

The variety of breads are a delight to bread lovers, the garlic bread being one of my favourites. The dry fruit cake is another tasty snack when accompanied with tea/coffee. Nahoum's still has the same antique decor. The chicken patties and pizza puff is a delight to your taste buds.

Every time I think of visiting a cake shop I first find out the brand value of that place.Maybe I'm a little fettish when it comes to brands but that's the way I go about it.
Next what I calculate is the availability of what I exactly want,simulatenously keeping the price value in mind.
If I had to calculate so many of these factors,my blood pressure would have shot up.
Nahoum's is one such place where I get all the things I want.It happens to be one of Calcutta's first and finest bakeries.
Located precisely in the city's Esplanade and forming an essential part of the Hogg Market, Nahoum's bakery is a must visit for every tourist who comes to Calcutta.
The antique smell still remains in every corner of the cake shop.
Generally if I'm hopping around this place I go for the chocolate pastries and Chicken patties for a quick grab. For the home I pick the Fruit Cakes which tastes really good when you have it with tea/coffee.
The Rich dry fruit cake is a speciality of this cake shop. But at times it tastes a little more sweet than the normal fruit cakes I have.
Fact is you get everything here everyday apart from the Christmas season. It's not that you won't get anything on Christmas, but the long queues will really spoil your mood for buying anything.
In Calcutta there are so many cake shops but believe me I never see serpentine queues outside any cake shop like Nahoum's.
Prices here are very reasonable and the bakery food is very fresh.
It is a real pleasure to see a cake shop maintaining its standards for ages.
And lastly...do dig in for the cream rolls of this place and the lemon tarts.I believe it will give you an unforgettable experience.
I'll leave it up to you to find out more interesting facts about this place,which I may not know.

As a budding baker, New Market is a heaven for all its reasonably priced baking tools and easy availability of ingredients that shops around the city (even the high-end ones) seem to have never heard of. But whether I am shopping for a carton of heavy cream or looking for faux leather goods, there is one stop I never fail to make whenever I am in the area- that is Nahoum and Sons.

My earliest memories of Nahoum's is that of really aromatic cakes in Christmas and delicious mince patties during shopping. I love their cakes, all of them, because they taste very homely to me. The plain cakes are really buttery and the slightly cracked tops remind me of my own cakes! I love their pastries and Swiss rolls and tarts as well. They are reasonably priced if you compare the taste and size with those you find at Monginis and Sugarr 'n' Spice and Kathleen. The lemon curd in tarts and puffs is simply divine and the chocolate glaze on Swiss rolls makes for a decadent taste in your mouth.

As for the savories, I am not usually a preacher of minced meat bakes, but if it tastes as good as Nahoum's, who needs chunky chicken? The minced meat patties and pies that are found in other bakeries taste like there is a lot of filler in the mince. Not Nahoum's though; it tastes very meaty, despite the crumbly, un-meatlike texture. I love fish panthras and can easily stuff myself full of them. 

Special mention: The egg chop is brilliant- I love the plain, baked potato filling with the half egg. It has a clean taste that I would take over the overly spicy fillings that are usually associated with this Bengali version of Scotch eggs.

One of the oldest cake shops in the country..the cakes are as good as you could possibly find anywhere in Kolkata, considering their prices. They seem to have kept the prices same over the years. Just that the shop has remained the same too, with the place badly in need of a makeover. Otherwise just love the food, especially the chocolate brownies.!!

This is the oldest bakery known to me :) its a must to pick up stuff from here whenever I visit new market. I like their pizza puff and chicken patties.... But the chicken patties is gone down now! Their plum cakes during Christmas are what I crave for... And thankfully this has not gone down! How I wish they could renovate it a little and keep it a lil clean.... :)

Of what’s left of Jewish community of Kolkata, Nahum’s Bakery is one of them. It is famous for its plum cakes, cheese muffins and delicious pastries. 
It is situated in New Market, Victorian Gothic market and Calcutta’s first municipal market. No visit to this iconic market is complete without a visit to Nahum’s. The confectioneries are good though slightly expensive though resonable.

One of the oldest bakery of Kolkata.. The legendary Nahoum and Sons is situated at New Market area..If the past recalls this place was the first choice for bakery in old Calcutta. 

I feel nostalgic while giving this review.. All my past memories have been recalled. 

My Christmas always meant Nahoum and Sons fruit cake..it was a ritual for me. 
As a kid.. I use to beg my parents to take me over there.

My dad or mom use to bring home all that wonderful Puffs,cookies, pastries,patties.. Specially the lemon Puffs which was a wish come true for me always... Till now its a personal favourite in Nahoum and Sons list. 

The experience of taking home a cake that is still hot and taken out from the oven something that has not grown old with me. 
The Nahoum and Sons is the place for old bakery charms,with the glimpse of old Calcutta ( kolkata ).

I never miss to visit this place when I am around the New Market Area. Usually I pack my favourites and sometimes have the most tempting ones out in there ! I guess I am not eligible to criticize this bakery in any way, it is legendary , all I can do is only praise ! All the pieces I have tried has always been super fresh and delicious. Among the must tries include the lemon tart or lemon puff, because its the best lemon flavoured bake I have ever had with the perfect sweet and sour flavour, most of the time its all sold out :( but when luckily I manage to find them in the racks, I get them all ! :D. Other items that I loved were almond tart (although its a bit too sweet), black forest cakes etc. 

Few days back I got to try their Garlic Bread and I can loudly declare that IT IS the best garlic bread I could have had. Its simple the best blend of garlic, butter and pepper possible, way way better than all those commercialized garlic breads of pizza joints! and guess what the price is just Rs 60 for 1 pound ! ! ! :O

Try their biscuits, feels like homemade and gives a relief of freshness that packaged biscuits never have !

Their prices are average, its quite pocket friendly ! Making my experience all the more pleasurable.

The only not-so-good thing is, they remain closed during the christmas time mostly, I understand that its hard to meet the pressure of the demanding customers but I really wish that all of us could get an opportunity of try your cakes when its the right time of have them. But I admit whatsoever might be the occasion they never ever compromise their quality !

In a rainy day after moving here & there finally I found this place inside Hogg Market.
Yes, you guessed it right, it was my first visit. The shop isn't a modern day fancy shop at all. I heard a lot about their special brownies, so bought some brownies and brought it back to my home.
Ummmm....after tasting one of those brownies, I can certainly feel the inner peace. My hard effort on a rainy day when streets are full of dirty, muddy water hasn't gone in vain. It was a great success.
It's a legendary shop, you can feel the essence as soon as you enter the shop.
I am eagerly waiting to try their fruit cakes, fish pantras, pastries and lots of other products. Expectations are high. A must visit place...

This place is within the new market building and an old and very famous bakery in the area.
Visited this place today and tried their chocolate pastry, some cookies and pizza puff.
Food was too good to excite the buds and a cheap one too I will say.
Put this in your list if you are coming to Kolkata. :-D

A Visit to new market is incomplete without visiting this legendary place. If you are a first time visitor the place might not impress you. There is nothing fancy about this shop and has maintained its simplicity and food quality for four generations. The confectionaries gonna bowl you ova for sure.

For people its might be the lemon tart or fish pantras or pan cakes or chicken samosas or rum balls but for me the place is a must visit for the cheese puffs and brownies.

During Christmas it has wide range of cakes to offer.
No wonder it made its place on "legendary" on zomatao.

While I do not like their patties much, the fruit cakes and palm cakes are definitely steals the show. The place is almost always overcrowded but the quick service pretty much makes up for it. Being a legendary Kolkata bakery, Nahoums is a synonym for nostalgia to many. I am yet to try their Mutton Samosas which is a legendary item and yet rarely available.

on the rare day i finally entered its doors, the sweet-tangy lemon pastry caught my attention and bowled over my heart.. 
kindly let me know when it is REALLY open as compared to the timings written above! As my office is really near to this shop and i like coming over now and then.. only to find its shutters down!

This place is a must-visit on my trip to the New Market. I am especially fond of their Jam Tarts, Lemon Puff, Rum Ball and Sweet Bun (served hot). However, their Chocolate Fudge was overly sweet. Make sure to carry back a bottle of their Gooseberry Jam. But the Orange Biscuits were hugely disappointing since there was nothing orange about it.

Nahoum's is almost synonymous with Kolkata. Cakes, pastries and savouries are their forte. Of course they have in a way lost ground to the newer places which are expensive, offer fancier looking items made with fancy ingredients. But it is really like comparing oranges and apples. Any Nahoum-lover will tell you that.

I am not one to really sing paeans over this outlet. It offers you basic, well made, good tasting stuff of a particular standard. Their brownies was what I had heard about them for, and I must say they are good. The patties, etc are fairly decent, and can hold their own. I used to be fond of their candies, the stick-jaws and the mint ones... a childhood phase no doubt.

To be fair there is a lot I have not had the fortune of trying... the mutton samosas for example.

Perhaps it lives on in its steep history, and may not have anything to cater to today's money-splashing, fancy-demanding youth, but those who can find solace and enjoyment from the simpler things will certainly find Nahoum's worth a visit.

A perfect place which defines the phrase that simplicity is the best policy . The decor and ambiance is not much to talk about . But the pastries and cakes wins our heart , our taste buds and our pockets . Reasonably priced with excellent quality specially the fruit cakes and brownies. They should consider opening a cafe which would be an instant hit..

Well this bakery is my favourite at a particular time of the year that is the christmas. Just cant keep my hands off their fruit cakes, plum cakes etc. You can have all,you can have many and you are going to love them. My next favourite is the garlic bread and to be frank I am not that of a great fan of their creamy pastry. If you are a first timer please do ask the locale for direction or you will keep going in rounds.

This is the bakery form where my first birthday cake was ordered, no wonder it occupies a special position in my life. Other than that, the unassuming bakery in the lanes of New Market might raise many eyebrows at first, doubting the quality of its products, but once your taste-buds have touched the Nahoum's recipes, you cannot deny that it is by far the best bakery in town. The puffs and chops, the pastries and brownies... my mouth starts watering even thinking of it, sitting 2000km away from home. If nothing, even the aroma from Nahoum as you pass by the shop will bring a smile to your face!

To start with, I don't have any childhood memories associated with Nahoum's. Being reared in the suburbs of South Kolkata and from a family which believes in the moto, "Eat for living and not for passion", I had very little scope to access the great old school eateries of Kolkata. However it was only yesterday when I was introduced to Nahoum's by one of my senior colleagues. Previously I have heard many a things about this place but when I first had the chance to test it myself, I must say that I was not disappointed at all. We had  Chicken Patties with walnut brownies. Being accustomed with the new school of patties, the old school patties did not attract me much ( I still think chunks of meat tastes better in a patties than minced meat). However the brownies were out of this world. The walnut was roasted just to the right extent, the crust of the brownie was a bit crisp (much to one's delight), but the inside was moist,soft and having just the right texture. It will not be an ovestatement if I say those were the best brownies that I have ever tasted. I also heard stories that these brownies are exclusively shipped to Sachin Tendulkar's house, which seemed not at all astonishing to me. I wonder if this is the deteriorated quality (like people say), then what could have been the real quality. 
I am planning to visit the place again soon and to taste each and every item they produce. 4 stars from me.

If are in town, want to indulge in tasting some cake, not the creamy pastry, but some classic Christmas style cake, this is the best place to get it. I have been to many shops in the city for cakes. But nothing beats the taste of the Rich Dry Fruit Cake or even simple fruit cake. The aroma of rum to your nose, butter in your finger and taste in your mouth.. trust me it is one of the most awesome experience.

The cake shop is very old and have been on my wishlist when ever I am in town. I don't give it a miss. And prices are very very reasonable compare to the quality they offer.

I won't recommend anything special for the pastries, not because they are not good. They are pretty good actually. But not exceptional that you can't get at any pastry shop. But the cake is simply something which is the best in the city.

So next time you are in town, make sure to visit the place and do some favor to your sweet tooth. If you are conscious about your diet, give your diet plan a miss for a day. Trust me, its that good. :)

Nahoum and Sons - Surely one of the best bakery joints in the city which provide perhaps the best brownies... 

Location - Placed at the end corners of Hogg Market .. Built a century ago , this place is quiet famous in that area and anybody would guide you through the narrow lanes of Hogg market...
A visit to new market area remains incomplete without the walnut brownies or the  mutton samosas at Nahoums. Accordingly i visited this place quiet a few number of times and had tasted some their fast food items as well as their baked pastries.. 

Staff - The place remains crowded mostly in the evening ..But the staffs still manages to help their customers in describing briefly about the various bakery items which even include crunchy biscuits..

Food - Some of the well recommended items are mutton samosas,chicken patties , fish pantheras ,chicken puff and almost all the pastries... And yeah obviously the walnut brownies... If u like to buy biscuits , go for the sweet ones viz. van-chok , orange-flavoured   and try to avoid the salty ones (like cheese crackers)because those are too salty...
Overall, a nice place to have snacks at a very affordable cost..
  
Pocket Pinch : Rs 200 for two (approx)..

Nahoum's needs no introduction. 

Located inside New Market, the bakery has successfully maintained the quaintness typical to old establishments. No garish lights, pompous display or decor like the newly sprung up establishments. Still they are able to maintain their loyal clientele. There has absolutely been no compromise to the quality.

One can step in for a helping of the best plum cakes and brownies in town. Lemon tarts too count among my personal favourites! I recommend brownies and plum cakes!

For more than a century, a visit to Kolkata has remained incomplete without the crunchy brownies, delectable cheese muffins and delicious pastries at Nahoum's at New Market. Christmas isn't complete without their plum cakes and rich fruit cakes. Nahoum's has been one of the most famous confectioneries of the region for half-a-century. 
Nahoum's was set up in 1902 by Nahoum Israel, a Jew who had come to Kolkata from Baghdad. Within a decade, it had turned into the city's most famous confectionary, famous with the British. 

Location - Even a blind man in New Market knows its location. 

Brief - Paid a visit to the Nahoum's today after a long time :D

Ambience - The same old Nahoum's ambience.

Things Ordered - I packed a few items. The servers were very helpful and cooperative and helped me click pics as well :D
I packed up chicken patties,brownies,cheese cupcakes(This one on my friend TB's suggestion). Unfortunately the chicken sandwich and samosas were not available :(

I reached home and almost burst on the food. Each of them tasted special. The patties were awesome, The brownies just wow and the Cheese Cupcakes were the best :D

Purse Check - The total bill was Rs.280/- !! Amazing :D

Overall - My experience was Insane. Superb food+superb pricing+nostalgia=Mindblown :P
Specially recommended :P

Brownie, brownie and more brownie's....the best brownies in town! Whenever someone goes to New Market, my standard instructions get me some brownie. They are not soft, cottony but a mix of hard and soft-with oodles of walnuts inside that make the chocolatey seem chocolatier... The same taste has been maintained since my Dadu's time and through out all generations we adore this! However if the chocolate gets you guilty have their very low cal, water biscuits which taste so subtle and nice that you wonder if its low cal at all or not, but it is. Their cheese samosa or cheese puff are delicacies...the spungy cheese is nothing you get here.  Other stuffs normal, old school, stuff i rather not eat but none the less, they are superb,

This is my first entry in Zomato with a perfect 5. And people who have been to Nahoum's, need no explanation for the same. It has been the most trusted, most famous and the unmatched bakeries of Kolkata. Foodies, including me, travel from various part of the cities to pick up cakes and brownies from Nahoum's.

Starting from the Plum cake, to the walnut brownies, to the patty and the biscuits; they have made us a fan of everything they have brought to us. Being in New market with its old world charm, Nahoum's is a cult bakery; which has been satisfying generations now. And the freshness of the products cannot be questioned, so is the price. It's too good to be true!!!

Enough said... just be here to taste a bit of heaven...

You just can't afford to miss it!!!

The other name for Nahoum's is nostalgia. Whenever I step in to this place I can feel myself being transported to my childhood when my brother and I would stand in the middle of the shop and wonder what we should ask our parents to buy for us. Even till this day I wonder what I should buy and keep looking around for a few minutes. A lot of people have said that it is no more that good and the quality of their cakes, pastries and other sweet treats have deteriorated over the years. I agree with them all. But is it not the phenomenon everywhere! Nahoum and Sons is no more as good as it used to be in its hay days or even during my childhood but it still can give newer places like Kookie Jar and Cakes and French Loaf a run for their money. How you may ask? Here is how.
I used to love their marzipans. I still do. One word to describe them would be amazing. They come in various shapes, sizes and colours, resembling vegetables and fruits. There are two variations as far as the marzipans are concerned. One is plain and the other is with walnuts. My next favourtie is the macaroon tart, with the sweet cherry perched atop it. It tastes as good as it looks. Then there is the small muffin wrapped in a savoury pastry with sugar sprinkled on top the name of which I fail to recall now. There are a few biscuits and cookies I absolutely love from here. Th rum ball is decent and not one of my favourites. Don't miss the fruitcake here. It is perhaps a bit too sweet but it has the ideal moistness and tastes simply wonderful with all the sugary and crunchy fruity bits. But in my opinion the rich plum cake takes the cake (pun intended).  Over the last few years it has become a bit more greasier but despite that it is one of the best available in town. The shop in itself is a bit run down and decrepit but don't let that deceive you. Not all the items are good but that is the story almost everywhere. This place should be declared a heritage site. Don't miss it.

Now coming to the true point...we took a lemon puff which was great.the filling was yummy and the coating of cake was soft and touching..we took another cake with rich(really very rich) cream....which was also good but killed our appetite..the store is pocket-friendly..much cheaper than other known shops..i dint take any non veg ..maybe i vl go for it someday...recommended-mutton samosha,lemon puff,cheese samosa....and after all...100 shopping malls cannot replace new market...going to nahoums means resurrecting the memories and pride(still exists)of new market

I had been to Nahoum and sons with one of my friend yesterday as we were discovering the eateries in new market. Believe me when i first saw this place for the first time i had a very nostalgic feeling that i had been here before also. Its located inside the Stuart Hogg market which is popularly known as new market now. They had a lot of pastries, cakes, puffs and patties to serve the people at very reasonable prices. 

When i went there first time, i was like such an old place and such a huge crowd ? what is it? Then i suddenly discovered that its NAHOUM AND SONS which is one of the best Cake shops in New market. 

I had ordered Chicken puff which costed me 20 bucks to taste and believe me it was different, old style and yumm. When i had the first byte i could feel like i am tasting something which is carried out from the old times. However, later i remember my dad used to get the very famous fruit cake from there. And believe me this place is a MUST VISIT. Some people may have an hygiene issue but its a good place to grab a byte. 

My friend even said me that the black forest cake out here is damn good.  :)

Old is gold goes the saying.How very true when i found out on a recent visit just before Christmas.The shop resembled a refugee relief camp :)The long que of cake buyers was chaotic,ill-disciplined as is the norm in Kolkata. I mean people fighting amongst themselves, asking inane questions to the staff and haggling over prices- yes you read it right. Since standing in a que for food of any kind is not my thing i made a move to come back later. Thankfully it was relatively empty later and i managed to buy my staple quota of plum cake and the rich fruit cake. They were priced at Rs 250 and Rs 375 respectively.Very reasonable when compared to star/snobbish bakeries.The quality was awesome to say the least.The rich variant was moist and full of dry fruits,nuts,raisins and had the aroma of rum and wine in it. Trust me folks this is undoubtedly as good as it gets. Nahoums has been the numero uno bakery in Kolkata for more than a century and still going strong.I intend to sample the savouries and pastries on offer in my next visit.
This patisserie has been rendering great service for the cake lovers of Calcutta for more than a century now. Situated at the  no brainer location of  Sir Stuart Hogg market( popularly known as New Market) in the heart of the city, this joint surely touches the heart of all foodies.Though its  Jewish owner David Nahoum  passed away couple of months back, the show goes on as it should be. I must admit that i have no childhood memories of this joint as i have spent most of my life outside Bengal. But i have had the pleasure of tasting most of the items on offer. Items like the rich fruit cake-rich indeed with plentiful soaked raisins and dry fruits, walnut marzipan candy- age old favourite, mutton samosas-if you are really lucky and an early bird, puffs,brownies and lemon tarts. The specialty of this joint is that most of the baked items are prepared the traditional way- hand made that is with lots of love , care and affection. 
Decor, ambiance etc - please do not bother.Hop in , take your pick of items and soak in the pleasure of savouring the best of confectionery in Calcutta.They prefer to keep the cake-shopping experience uncomplicated and simple- i like it.
Though i must admit that several new bakery chains have marched forward with modern techniques of baking, bigger spread of items, bigger space and better ambiance.But as they say old is gold.This joint still holds its own.

To be honest, unlike many local foodies, this bakery was not a part of my childhood or growing up days. Now and then I heard about it and it was a part of my wish list to someday visit it. This Christmas, again I came across a couple of nice food articles about this place and its enormous Christmas Cake sale. Finally, this time I did make my visit.

We tried veg chop, strawberry pastry, chocolate pastry and paneer patty. Undoubtedly, all the items were fresh and authentic. 

Being used to other ‘well decorated and with poised staff’ bakeries, this one seemed a little different and incomplete to me. But the kind of age old loyalty it enjoys amidst generations of people, I am sure that all of its wares are to the mark and people do enjoy and look forward to their visits here.

I've had their Rich Fruit Cake on Christmas Day for many years, almost as a ritual. As a kid, I would beg to be taken along, so that I could whine and plead my way to more goodies. The lemon puff is a delight, as are the puffs. My personal favorites also include the sweet buns and the cookies. The experience of taking home a cake that is still hot from the oven is something that has not grown old with time. Coupled with not-too-steep prices, Nahoum's is THE place for old world bakery charms!

Went there for the first time after planning for ages. Everything, from the chicken Patties to the fruit cake to the rum ball reminds you of the time Chowringhee was about sahebs and horse drawn carriages and weekly balls in star hotels and Dalhousie square and Christmas trees in every Anglo Indian household...simply the must awesome fruit cake you may ever have in a 5000km radius.

The plum cake was fantastic and would come here again for it.
If you are in the new market area, it's a good place to pickup bakery items.

Sadly, I didn't have any childhood memories of visiting this renowned Jewish bakery to reflect upon, when I finally decided to enter Nahoum's for the first time a few months after its iconic owner Mr. David Nahoum passed away. Until then, I'd had only passed a quick glance over the beautifully stacked showcases of cakes and pastries, maybe while pursuing my hunt for something or the other in the interlacing, vibrant lanes of Sir Stuart Hogg Market.
 
After catching a show at the recent film festival held in our city a month back, me and him got promoted to savourers from being mere peepers of the confectioneries. The moment we were inside, the smell of freshly baked pastries and cakes, the wood and glass furniture and the antique decor held an undeniable reflection of the old and classy cosmopolitan Calcutta in front of us. Yes, the place does have a charm of its own which leaves no one untouched.
 
A bit disappointed we were, for missing out on the mutton samosas. Nevertheless, being two super excited kids, we immediately packed away a few things like the Chicken Patty, Chicken Mayonnaise Puff, Chocolate pastry, Lemon Puff and Brownie.
Unfortunately, the filling of the somewhat tough patty was not exactly delicious and the chicken mayo puff had no trace of mayonnaise in it (though its filling was tastier). Then the chocolate pastry was a bit letdown too, as I've had much better pastries from other bakeries in Kolkata. However, the lemon puff was a true foodie's delight and we finally found something that could be relished. The base for the puff was soft, the filling was made of a tangy buttery lemon cream and the icing sugar on top made this one a dreamy package. 
The best treat was the brownie, easily. It was chocolaty, walnutty, a bit crumbly yet firm and very, very buttery. Now, what else would a cake lover need, to go bonkers all over?

 At the end, I may call this my first childhood memory of this 110 years young patisserie, many years down the line from now. Right now, I'm planning my next visit to grab hold of the Rich Fruit Cake as Christmas is just round the corner with all its bells set to jingle already. :)

On a Christmas eve shopping spree of cakes and brownies, I tried out the cheese pastry and it was quite a delight! There was an unexpected amount of a creamy cheese filling inside the sturdy pastry and the whole thing is quite filling.

Nahoum and Sons belongs the old school of baking. Though new sophiscated methods of baking has emerged, nahoums still keep it inthe old way. The place is hidden inide the new market. You can get varieties of baked cakes and confectionaries  here which are good enough. I have visited this place at the time of easter and i was delighted with theor easter eggs and also their old school cakes.

Recommended if you are in new market.

Just uttering a name can make you happy and "Nahoum and Sons" is one such name. Such are the strength of wonderful memories and associations with this establishment that it transports me instantly back to my childhood. Both sets of my grandparents lived near New Market so whenever I stayed with them we climbed onto a rickshaw and trundled off to New Market and naturally no visit to New Market was ever complete without a visit to this quaint wonderland of flavors. Its old world unpretentious charm and huge glass windows displaying the goodies are such a lovely sight to behold. I remember queuing up for my Christmas Cake every winter .... they still make a fantastic old school x-mas cake that is a must buy for me every Christmas. Their solid chocolate Easter Eggs with little cartoons stuck on them as well as the larger colorful ones filled with candy were our ultimate prize and the Easter Buns were legend. The individually wrapped brownies and plum cake available all year through are delicious and packed and carried for our relatives whenever we travel out of Kolkata till date. They also make some lovely home-style cookies and biscuits , chocolate and plain fudge , marzipan candy , delicious macaroons and super garlic bread ( the other rolls and breads are also delicious but I am obsessed with the garlic loaf). No party at home is complete without their delicious Cocktail Mutton Samosas available only every day around 11 am and sold out in a flash (Kindly pre-order as you will come away disappointed otherwise). The Pantheras and Patties are also nice but made old school style. Also if you want a traditional  wedding cake this is one of the best places to order it in the city. Truly its a  trip down nostalgia and a true legacy for any foodie of Kolkata.

A childhood favorite .... used to visit it with my grand parents and we still frequent it for the wonderful garlic bread , brownies , macaroons, fudge and x-mas cake .... they also make the most amazing cocktail mutton samosas which are sold out in an hour every morning without fail ! Three generations of my family have frequented it and its still a happy and nostalgic experience every time I go !

It is said that Kolkata was known to have some of the best restaurants when the rest of the country was learning to eat and if you ask of a traditional bakery, flury's was the name everybody knew. But how many knew that in the narrow pathways of the Hogg Market, somewhere in the middle of a flood of shops and shoppers there is a tradition long living for 111 yrs now. Started by David Nahoum, the roots of this Bakery dates back to 1902 and since then its has been a landmark in the vicinity if Hogg market to make one of the finest bakery items in the city. 

Lets now come out of nostalgia to some present day facts. First, the location - The location is prime yet sheepish, tucked somewhere in the Hogg Market. For first time visitors, it will be fun spending time and turning around again and again in the web of paths in Hogg market. For regulars, it will be a cakewalk. Just take the entry to the Hogg market just opposite to the Citi mart and walk straight. Just ask anybody on the way and they will show you the place. 

Its a medium sized bakery selling many kinds of stuff like brownies, cakes, puffs etc. alongwith many unconventional varieties like date biscuits. They are also quite well known for the wedding cakes they prepare. Many will even argue that they are the only bakery in the city who genuinely know how to make Wedding cakes, and to some extent, its true. 

Quality - Top notch. There are a few items in here which hold taste best above all. For this try the brownie, the plum cake and the date biscuits. Other products are also good like the pastries and chocolate biscuits. The taste of the items are very different from any other bakey mainly bcoz they still use some of the original recipes which started with this shop.

Service - This is not a eat-in bakery so no point of mentioning it. The people selling the items, on the other hand, are pretty well behaved and attentive. In that terms, service is pretty fine.

But there are some cons too about this place. First the location is pretty inside the Hogg Market and the surroundings just outside the bakery can sometime be pretty stingy. So just try to avoid those factors.

There may have no royal or classy touch to it but very inch of this bakey speaks history and tradition. It has stood tall among the rest for so many years now and rightfully can be admitted as one of ther face of the city's doors of history!!!

Nahoum and Sons is synonymous with bakery. In the ancient days, when there was no Kookie Jar, Cakes, Monginis, or even Kathleen, people would flock to this institution to sample some of the best baked goodies available in the city. Though this once famous shop faces stiff competition from others, it is still visited by the old faithful who swear by its delicacies. Me, personally, when I visit this place, do indulge myself in their Black Forest pastry, Chicken Patties, and of course their Apple Pie. These three items, along with their tarts, will instil in a taste that is hard to find elsewhere. 

With the advent of modern baking, there is a rush of fresh-cream cakes in the market. However, Nahoum does their icing the old school way, with icing sugar, water and food colouring. Hence, if you wish to avoid the layers of fat slathered on the cakes available today, this place is a must visit for you.

A few other items of theirs are a must to try out.In winters, a must buy is their cake rusk biscuits. Also available are biscuits with honey and raisins, which actually contain raisins. Or if you prefer a savoury taste, go for the cheese straws. They taste like nectar.

Do not go by the appearance of the shop, the bland appearance hides what is surely the most amazing food experience you can have!!

Nahoums has marked a distinct position in Kolkata's heritage. Not very old to the fine confectionery of Nahoums, I was mind-blown with the cream rolls, the various assorted chocolate pastries, the puffs and patties that I had been "given"... It was notches better than any other bakery around, notches better!!! 

However, when I personally visited the place, I saw something rather negative about it. It wasn't crowded, it was mobbing! It was dingy. Mosquitoes were swarming all over the place. The hygiene factor, in short, was pretty low here, and that's what stopped me from going back there!

If they could just see to that, it can be reach perfection!

This shop inside New Market at Esplanade is a landmark in the culinary map of Kolkata. Not only do they make lip smacking cakes and sweets, but they are also part of the city's historical legacy being a favorite of the erstwhile British during colonial times. It also holds the distinction of being a very well reputed authentic business belonging to the Jewish community. David Nahoum, the proprietor of the shop who recently passed away was a patriarch of his community. He was also a gentle, amiable man who used to often give free sweets to small kids who came in his shop. May he rest in peace.

Nahoum's is famous for their variety of patties and pastries. Lemon tarts, Rum Balls and Marzipans will make you go back repeatedly. The Pizza Puff , The Eclair, Chocolate Walnut Pastry are just some more options you can explore.
Although the confectionary and sweets section is the flagship part, the chicken and veg patties & cheese cocktail samosas are equally nice. The Tuna Sandwiches are one of a kind.
One thing we tend to look over nowadays is the bread but the garlic bread is strongly suggested. The prices overall are still less than most bakers and confectioners.

Chakraborty Tip : If you enter from the far end of the Simpark mall ; from the side of the fountain, go as follows :

First left - go straight ignoring the first right - take next right - take first left - and voila :)

Nahoum and Sons  . . I bet anybody who visits this place for first time will be as surprised as me  :P :)  Located inside the shabby New Market, this bakery is famous for its pastry and biscuits . .

I tasted Chicken patties, Rum balls, mutton samosa, brownies and just loved eating them :) The prices are also reasonable. 

I had actually travelled for more than a hour and took more than 30 mins to trace out this bakery :) It was worth the effort.

This place is one of the landmarks of Kolkata's heritage, and is definitely a must-visit place for everyone who visits Kolkata. Located deep within the maze of New Market, it boasts of one of the best plum cakes available in the city. The lemon tarts and rum balls are equally desirable. Although the quality has dropped over the years, this still is one of those places where good quality confectionery is available at a very reasonable price.

Nahoums - a legend in the new market area. My ask when someone is visiting from Kolkata is to bring the Nahoums fruit cake or plum cake.Consistency is the name of the game. Rich fruit cake is filled with fruits and has an air of freshness about it even after days.  The cake has remained constant in the era of "poriborton"  - love the place and aroma. 

My suggestion stick to basic and classic items - you will find bliss among the offerings.

One of my oldest childhood memories of Calcutta has been of gobbling down multi-coloured Marzipaans at Nahoums. This is the very reason why my trips to Calcutta are never complete without visiting the place at least once. The best part is, nothing has changed about it, which works wonders for people trying to re-live the past, the old wooden display shelves are still as attractive and dusty; the large marble topped bread counters still look like they will vaporize soon, and the old auntie at the counter still doesn't accept plastic money. 

Of course, don't expect to sit down and enjoy a meal in the comforts of air conditioning, you will just have to pick what you like and enjoy the treats at home. All said and done, everything still tastes like a dream, a dream from my childhood. On my most recent visit, I felt slightly as though the quality has gone down and this is quite possible since old uncle who sat with old auntie has recently passed away. The cakes didn't taste the same *wipes tear from eye*.

As far as recommendations go: Do not walk out of the shop without 2 packs of the Chocolate Fudge and 2 packs of the Onion Sesame Biscuits (or more of those if you don't have issues with fitting into clothes).

Nahoum and Sons has been an integral part of my childhood, and even today, if I am in the New Market Area, I drop in to pick up fudge, marzipan or brownies.

The shop's appearance is a far cry from the tiled, garish design that characterizes most confectionery outlets today. The old-fashioned frontage with products kept on glass shelves or stacked on tables gives the place a charm of its own. The staff are polite and friendly, and chat with regulars like old friends (which they usually become).

Since the Nahoums are no longer able to manage the shop personally due to old age (the last Nahoum living in Calcutta, David, died in March 2013), the shop is no longer able to produce the traditional Jewish items that made it stand out from the rest.

The cakes at Nahoum were very good. The chocolate used was very different from what was used in other major bakeries in the city, and the sponginess of the cake layers was a byword. I must have gone through the entire cake catalogue, and have also had the good fortune of trying out a number of things they were experimenting with. They also use locally produced cheese, which adds to the taste of the items 

Among the savoury items, the Panthras is unique - I don't think there's another bakery that makes a non-vegetarian version. Their Cheese Samosas and Cocktail Samosas are also quite good. Their Chicken Patties have the chicken very finely minced, instead of larger pieces, as is more common. There's also a Pizza Puff which has a very tasty core. They occasionally keep Tuna Sandwiches, which ought to be snapped up. Among the pastries, I've always preferred the Eclair and the Chocolate Walnut Pastry.

Their bread - be it plain, brown, sandwich or garlic - is excellent, and far better than the sawdust we get from the mass-produced bread here. They also have a very good range of savoury and sweet biscuits - their Macaroons used to be famous, but I like others, like the Cheese and Chives biscuits. Their fudge and marzipan is still quite good, and the brownies taste very different from those made by other bakers in the city - it has a hard crust and is quite crispy. Their Plum Tikki sells out within minutes of being made available - people wait for it to arrive in the shop in order to buy it.

It is true that quality has dipped somewhat. The trick is to avoid certain items. For example, their Black Forest Pastry is a new addition, and should be avoided. Therefore, with care, you should be able to find some really good food here.

Nahoum's is supposed to be a major part of a Kolkatan's heritage. I was virtually raised on the cakes from Nahoum's as every time my parents would go to New Market, they would buy cakes and patties from Nahoum's, and take home big bags of Marzipan, Fudge and biscuits. Years have gone by, but I am still in love with the incredibly tasty lemon puff, a light, fluffy, soft pillow of dough oozing perfectly made lemon curd, and the fabulous brownies, not to mention the cheese samosas, the recipe originally from Iran, as told proudly. Also, they have great sweet buns year round. Do not miss these hot rolls of dough studded with dry fruits and topped with plenty of sugar.

Surely one of the best bakery anyone will find in the city.....The shop has a huge heritage and is well know to people for its food.The rich-fruit cake and brownies are marvelous....The breads are different,and are always fresh.One can opt for the Garlic bread,Tutti frutti bread and more.The C.Pastry is very good and dose not have the usual filling...The pastries have a sugary topping,for which they don't attract me.Though the Tarts are nice.... The decor has a touch o heritage,which makes it out of the queue of modern bakery shops/joints. The place is a must visit for most Kolkatans while shopping at  New Market.  The place must be visited before Christmas,for the yummy Fruit cakes,Plum Cakes and brownies.The packed cookies and biscuits are quite good for later bites.

Anyone who has been brought up in Calcutta is familiar with this age old bakery famous for its Plum Cakes and Fruit Cakes and the popularity is ever so obvious during the time of Christmas when getting into the shop is almost impossible with a huge possibility of suffocation. For regulars like myself the Garlic bread with the perfect amount of garlic herbs and each slice buttered from within is a must have every week. You can have it with soups, make a sandwich or just eat it by itself. The biscuits, cookies, marzipans are all a treat for the taste buds. The pastries are not the usual cakes with icing it is proper pastry and the chocolate tart needs a special mention. The prices are affordable and the result is a happy stomach which equals to a happy you. Their Chocolate Biscuits are wonderfully chocolaty and with minimum sugar which makes it a treat for those who do not like their tea accompaniments or coffee accompaniments to be too sweet.

When I was a small kid my grandmother told me that the best bakery in town was nahoum's. She used to love the bakery from that shop. I was too young to understand then...but when I did understand, I realized how true it was. This shop placed in the heart of Kolkata (New market or Hogg Market as it was known). The shop is far away from the glitters and polishes of the south kolkata bakery shops like Kokie jar/upper crust etc, however the food is far superior. From the brownie to the garlic bread, from the cakes to the patties...all of these are just wonderful.
This place is not very heavy on the pocket either.
Definitely recommended for all pastry lovers.

This is one of those delightful places that have just become a part of the city's heritage. Their plum cake is literally world-famous and I never tire of trying it.
I've noticed that most people don't look beyond the staples at Nahoums. But my personal favourites are their cookies and crackers: there are always new flavours to try. In today's time, where every lane has a bakery, I find going to Nahoums totally worth it because I am a big fan of biscuits!
Also,I love their chocolate and vanilla fudges: if you like condensed milk,you'll love their fudge. :D I even use it for my own baking sometimes. 
Frankly,I like their savouries more than their pastries: they use royal icing, which doesn't really hold that much appeal for me. In fact, when I go to Nahoums,it's their packaged products that I look for first. 
Another time-tested suggestion: next time you have a kid's birthday party to attend,please take the time out to buy a pack of colourful macaroons from here. It just make their day,I've done it plenty of times. :)

This Jewish bakery is already a part of Calcutta's history and the ambiance will take you back to the beginning of the previous century. Love their garlic bread and tuna sandwiches (only made on weekends). Also the cheese samosas and patties are great. Not a big fan of their pastries, but love their Christmas rich fruit cakes and plum cakes. Another favourite is the brownie. A visit to New Market cannot be complete without Nahoum's.

A visit to New market is incomplete without a visit to our Gold Ol' Nahoums.. I guess a whole lot of Calcuttans have been brought up on these pastries and breads which they have been serving over the years from the same old quaint shop with hazy glass windows... Its part of the folklore of Kolkata now... with eyes wide open we used to wait to be taken to new market and some how i used to manage to lose my way through until you just approach the shops close by you would be drawn in by the whiff of the bakery... 
But those were the days.. now with an array of bakeries offering mind boggling variety of options Nahoums just seemed to have lost its glisten... but still my all time favourites are their bread buns as fresh as they arrive they vanish in no time.. their cheese sticks still retains the flavour well.. otherwise the cream on the pastries doesn't look that appetizing.... but for old times sake the cream rolls are worth a try... But what surprised me in a recent visit was the crumbed egg devils....a must try...
but over all Nahoums is all about nostalgia... i still visit it everytime i get to go to new market but alas their show windows are all empty half of the time...:(

I can remember going to Nahoum as long as I can remember my life. The good old heart cake, with its perfectly done batter, will never disappoint you. The brownies and the biscuits are highly recommended. You might also try their Round Chicken Pattice. The filling is quite different from the usual ones. More so, this place has a fair amount of history attached to it. Explore the shop more for their offerings. A bulk of their products are packed. A pre Christmas visit is a must.

Tip : The authorities are also the people who give you permission to visit the two synagogues off Brabourne Road.

Nahoum is more a part of the vintage charm of kolkata than anything else. old wooden shelves with glass panes, its like a time capsule in there. I dont like the pastries and cakes here, but they make the best breads. the garlic bread is simply awesome and so are the sweet buns.

they make delicious marzipan, fudge, and cookies too. the only place i know that makes bakhlava.. which alotho is very sweet, but i am addicted to it. soft mint candies, are a guilty pleasure.

among the savories, i dont like much but the fish pantaras is yummy.

the chirstmas plum cake is the best here..

over all ... a trip to kolkata is incomplete without nahoum..

His brother,Mr. David Nahoum,is also an expert in confectionery. Therfore, Nahoum & Sons. is prospering in every sense. May Jehova bless "Nahoum & Sons." for a long life.

The iconic Nahoum’s is a bakery one must not miss when visiting Kolkata. Located in the heart of new market , this bakery is always full of people and their products are sold out pretty soon. We had their Black Forest cake , which was amazing as it oozes out a rich cherry syrup , the rum ball , which actually tasted like rum and was filling , and the chocolate glappe, which was sandwich pastry where two biscuits enclosed a peanut and chocolate mixture. 
They have a great variety of breads also, so much that the entire place smells of bread. They even sell crackers , cookies , peppermints and fudge. Their chocolate fudge is to die for. Their puffs and patties are good too.

Well I am a fan of their fruit cake.. For a change I tried brownie and cheese cake.. Brownie was superb.. Bt didnt like the sugar particles on the Cheese cake.. Otherwise the inside of the Cheese cake was so soft and flavoured too..

Nahoums needs no introduction to every Calcutta Lover and this place won't disappoint you. We had a Cheese Patties, Veg Pizza, Rum Ball & Chocolate Pastry.They all tasted amazing. Though their Garlic Bread is equally good but I missed out as we went out in the evening. Overall a nice experience!!!

Nahoums make an intrinsic part of a fulfilling Christmas experience in Kolkata. They are famous for their irresistible "rich fruit cakes and plum cakes " which over the decades have remained marvelous. The rich fruit cake is one of the best in town and they remain fresh even after several days if stored in air tight containers. Other delicious cakes are their signature heart cakes and the lemon puffs. I have been a fan of their non-cream food items mostly. The shop located at the heart of new market is age old with antique decor but the staff are very helpful. When in Kolkata, visit to Nahoum is a must!

Loved the rich fruit cake. It was gooey, yummy, delicious & over the top! Each bite was laden with fruit chunks, walnut & was so chocolatey. One should experience it's taste to know why it is regarded as an iconic dessert house of Calcutta.

It's not a review, it's an innocent expression of sheer happiness and joy which we evoke after pampering ourselves with the goodies, offered by this legendary bakery. 
Well, its more than just a bakery though. Nahoums has witnessed the sweet and bitter times of the city of joy, the transition from Calcutta to Kolkata, the revamp of New Market, the nearby flyovers, the city's sudden love for London and so on. So it is in our genes to have at least a slice of the rich fruit cake here. The madeira cake, the envious varieties of plum cakes, pineapple pudding - We have all grown with these culinary treasures!

Fruit cakes,new year weekend and nahoums can be a synonym for themselves. The place is situated inside the confusing lanes of Hogg market. It was filled with people trying to get a hand on their pastries and savouries. When we reached the savouries were exhausted,but we had chocolate strawberry pastry, jam tart cream rolls and heart cakes. Apart from cream roll, everything thing was pure,simple and fresh. The highlight was the heart shape cake,which leaves a longing taste in your mouth. All the items were priced @30 bucks each. The reason why they are so famous is because they keep things simple and easy. It's a must visit if someone wants geniune old school pastry and cakes.

Well Nahoum for me is nostalgia. And it runs in the blood. Our family has been Nahoum loyalist for ages and i am no different. This place truly is legendary. Specially the “Rich Fruit Cake” that they serve is, simply put, out of the world. Have never tasted a better cake than that. This place is a must visit, specially if you want to immerse yourself with the taste of the old colonnial setting.

One of the most oldest cake shops in Kolkata.Christmas is simply incomplete without Nahoum's.Don't judge them by their century old furniture or old style glass displays.Their famous offerings are Plum cake and Rich Dry Fruit cake.Also you must try their chicken mayonnaise patties,eclairs pastry,brownie,lemon tart,chicken puff,brownie etc. This is Kolkata's last Jewish Bakery.They are serving consistently since 1902.The shop later was moved to its present location in 1916.

Nahoums, one of the best plum and fruit cake  selling shops and very much eternal to kolkata. The food taste and quality is bang on. But what they are behind is customer service. The staff over their do not know how to talk to people. They show attitude as if they are doing a great thing by serving us. There is a lady who handles one of the counters she is so rude that one cannot even think of. The other persons who handle other section they do not have  coordination amongst themselves. It was very crowded, two staff almost collided with each other and by chance hurt a customer, none of them bothered to apologise with that person. The owners and the management team of nahoum must realise that the staff has to be trsined and be more friendly. Just because its one of the authentic cake shops that does not mean they will treat like this. I guess I am the 1st person to give such rave reviews about Nahoum because inspite of such behavious people stand in queue to buy cakes from Nahoums. But one must remember that polite behaviour is also very important. Your product can be good but if your service is trash. I can only say being a calcuttan I will discourage everyone to visit Nahoum. I would be really glad if Nahoum takes my review seriously and take actions to change itself. 

Thank You.

Hooray, first review! This was a most rewarding visit, my second one overall and the first one in a few years, and I will certainly keep going back there for the rest of my life. The magnetising aroma the store emanates is hard to erase even after one has passed the adjoining area that veritably reeks, and the memory of the store is an abidingly sweet one, much like the taste of the various treats on offer there. Locating the store, once inside New Market, is markedly straightforward. Anyone and everyone there will be able to direct you to it should you not be able to locate it yourself. I was there with my sister; I had a chocolate pastry, and it was quite a knockout. The sweetness was just right. My sister tried the same. I alone had a lemon puff within which was a gooey and lemony mixture of utter perfection, and we carried home a Special Fruit Cake, and that was also quite exquisite. The establishment is old world and charming and can get slightly crowded during peak hours or during the peak season, but it's worth it. All in all, it was nearly a five star experience, and one I would highly recommend to everyone with a sweet tooth and, indeed, teeth of any kind, and one I would definitely like to undergo numerous times in the years to come.

Heritage bakery of kolkata. New market and nahoum have always been synonymous. If you visit new market you got to step your foot in at nahoum,thats almost like a ritual. For me there have been days when i have visited new market with a strong mindset to not visit nahoum but once i pass by this shop and the smell of those hot bakes fill in my nerves,thats it i cant help myself anymore and end up eating something or the other.
I have tried quite a few of their patties,pastries as well as plum cake and the famous christmas fruit cake. The freshness of the fillings and the cream tells a lot. I have a special thing for their rum ball,eclair and chicken patties. Everytime i visit them i make sure that i atleast have one of these. Have also tried their cookies and brownie.
Bakeries may come and go...they may do whatever new and innovative they want...but calcuttans will always love their nahoum.

Nahoum's and Kolkata are synonymous. Period. The smell of cakes and biscuits with the old world charm transforms this particular alley inside SS Hogg Market to a whole new level. Their pastries are all amazing in taste, be it chocolate pineapple or strawberry. I personally am not a huge fan of their savouries, but trust the cake they make with your eyes closed. This is on the christmas go to place for few years, and the queues and the taste never comes down. Happy Caking!! 😁

Thank you Nahoum so much for making my boring tiffin tastier. Been a regular customer of this place since a long time back and I am quite satiated with their bakery products. 

Tasted too many items from this place and the list is really long - 

Chocolate Fudge, Chocolate Cake, Lemon Tarts, Baklava, Rich Fruit Cake, Chocolate Brownie,Pineapple Pudding, Walnut Cake, Chicken Patty, Chicken Puff. 

Compared to other joints like Kookie Jar, French Loaf, Cakes this place is way too old and has not been rejuvenated much in terms of decor. And Nahoum still bear that vintage look and is always filled with that wonderful aroma of cakes. Their products are always fresh and the best part is the taste is that same, hasn't changed a bit all through these years! 

And the items are really affordable. Service is awesome. Great job doing N&S!

Their speciality  fruit cakes , fudges, lemon tarts, eclair, handmade biscuits, breads, etc...are the same sugary treats passed down through family recipes😁. The Jewish Cheese Sambusak (commonly called Chase samosa by the locals is to be tried. I like their chicken parties the best👍.. the filling is awesome 💖.

Nahoum's has been my go to place for satisfying my sweet tooth whenever I'm in New Market. It is true that the bakery is shabby and hasn't upped it's game in terms of decor or aesthetic appeal . However they have also kept their prices at a moderate level , a big plus . Their cakes and bakes are freshly made and have an old world charm. The bakery is kept neat and tidy. Their USP is that their taste has never changed and that is what drags me back to them more . Their Christmas fruit cake , black forest cake , brownies, chocolate cake , and strawberry cake are heavily loaded with goodness and taste . One cannot compare it's taste with other bakeries. It is unique and will always remain so. Hope they continue serving hungry Kolkatans for decades to come. :)

I've never really been a fan of the new market area mostly because of the crowd but would make a sacrifice just to visit this small and legendary bakery which is a paradise for cake and pastry lovers. And it's buzzing with people all throughout the year.

This place is difficult to locate for someone like me who's not a regular to this place, but anyone can give you the directions to this very popular shop if you don't have access to google maps.

Their chocolate and lemon tarts are nothing short of amazing. The rumballs are a bit too sweet but not complaining. The chicken puffs taste amazing too. 

Lastly, this place is super pocket friendly. So if you are out there shopping and need something to munch on, this place is definitely worth a visit :)

What could have  been a  better way to start your puja shopping with a Brakefast at Legendary Nahoum & Sons.
This place at the Heart of the city, Newmarket, is pure nostalgia.

We had
1.Tuna Sandwich
2.Chicken puff
3. Lemon puff.
4.Brownie


Tuna sandwich was awesome,bit spicy, I loved it.
Chicekn puff was flaky puff stuffed with chicken minced taste awesome.

But their Lemon puff and Brownies are just Devine.
You just have to take some time to embrace the awesomeness of these two.

Things you should also try in Nahoum
Chess puff, minced puff ( mince of dried fruits, nuts , raisins), chicken Singra, Run and rains cake

Forget everything else. If you are in the neighborhood, run to grab the chocolate brownie sold here at the price of rupees 40. The brownie isn't goey. It is just the right amount dry with enough nuts to keep you engaged until the end and the texture of the brownie and it's taste is just too good.

This is nowhere near the amazing bakery that it's reputed to be. And I say with due respect to the lineage it follows. I feel it's that, and not the current produce it offers that makes it so highly spoken about and rated. 
As a test I tried all the delicious things that it is known for - the lemon tart, chicken patty, the cookies or biscuits, and it's revered Eclair. 
I have been exposed to old institutions like the German Bakery, Kayani's, Standard and Ellora's. I consider myself a good meter for breads, biscuits , English desserts and the like. 
Nahoum and Sons does not match up. They might be good. But they are not great.

Went to this place as a part of our monthly foodwalk. The items lined up were so many and so delicious looking, we could only taste few:
Chocolate Pastry - 4.5/5
Strawberry pastry - 4.5/5
Brownie - 5/5
Egg Chop - 5/5 
Fish pantras - 4.5/5

Will visit again to try other varieties since they are good and affordable group of confectioners.

Hola peeps!!
.
.
.
This hidden gem was on my bucket list for the longest period of time but now finally I am ticking it off. All thanks to my sweetheart and an impromptu trip to Puri.
.
.
Nahoums can be a little tricky to locate as it is inside Hogg market complex. But you can simply remember the store number and can ask anyone inside the complex. They will give you the exact location and directions of the store.
.
.
There are no seating arrangements inside the store. Being a very old place, this has ample place in it to stand and eat your food. You can even pack your food and pastries and leave which I feel is a better option. The staffs are actually really mechanical and just are doing their work. No smiling faces to greet you! :(
.
.
The place has one of the best bakery items in town. They have a huge collection of cakes and pastries with so many puffs and patties. Even different kinds of breads are there which you can take along and prepare your own creation.
.
.
We had Chicken Puff, lemon tart, jam tart, chocolate tart and black forest cake. The pictures got deleted but I will post them the next time I land there. Pakka!!
.
.
Chicken puff was the best among the lot. The amount of chicken filling was too good. I have tasted different bakeries in Kolkata but I found it among the best. Soft and melts into the mouth like a dream, what more to ask for?
.
.
Lemon tart was a little too sour for my preference and so I found it quite an average one.
.
.
Chocolate tart was for my friend who told that it is really yummy and he liked it a lot.
.
.
Jam treat was really a hit for me. Though I found it quite simple, it was tasty which was enough for me.
.
.
The Blackforest cake stole the show among the sweets as it was mouth watering yet was not full of cream like other stores offer. I hate that excessive creamy top layer over cakes and so this blackforest cake was like a breeze of relief for me. :)
.
.
A must visit place for all bakery lovers!! <3
.

This delightful little bakery is located in New Market, Esplanade. Nahoum and Sons is quite popular and is always buzzing with throngs of people. The bakery was founded by Nahoum Israel Mordecai, a Baghdadi Jew, in the year 1902 and it remains as one of the most prominent confectionery till date. One should definitely try their Black Forest Cake which has its own taste. The different biscuits and muffins and fudges are worth trying. If you are around the New Market area, and you want a quick bite of something sweet, then this is the place. It is very reasonably priced and it won't disappoint you at all.

Set up by a Baghdadi Jew Nahoum Israel Mordecai in 1902, this Jewish bakery continues to serve the people of our city with elan even today. Some of the best and freshest bakery stuff emanate from here and for me a visit to Hogg Market without a visit to Nahoum and Sons is unimaginable. The pastries, brownies, puffs, patties, tarts, marzipans, fruit cakes.... the list goes on and on. They have maintained the same taste and the same quality since times immemorial and that is what keeps them going, inspite of the stiff competition all around today. The Last of the Mohicans of the dwindling Jewish population in Kolkata, I wish them the best and I hope they keep pampering us, the same way they have been for all these years. A motivation for many upcoming bakeries and many established bakeries as well, in the city. Nahoum and Sons... Legend. Period.

This is one of the few places in Kolkata that can take you back in time. It is a must visit for foodies searching for nostalgic flavours of Kolkata. However, my first experience was not thoroughly great. I went for chicken puff and chicken mayonnaise patties, both of which were much dry and not worth the price. Chocolate pastries, lime tart and the sweet bun are must try. Overall its is recommended place for snacks and dessert.

Great place to have some great great cake and pastries. 

1. Lemon puff- light sweet, but great taste 
2. Chocolate Eclair - taste like never before
3. Marzipan - a must have... 

Over all rating 4.5

I have been having things from here since i was born back in 90s. This is a heritage institution and anything good written about it would still be an understatement! Yes, it's that good! Come here on any 24th December and u'll get the proof. All u would find is a mile long queue of loyal and age-old customers waiting for their turn to fetch a pound of plain or plum cake for Christmas.
Have tried everything on their menu, from plain to plum cakes, brownies to rum balls and lemon tart to fudges. And the various puffs too. And they are all worth going back over and over again!
Try their black forest cake!!
Nothing much to write for people who already know this place. But for the newer generations, i would like to say that please try this place and maintain the cult of old calcutta!

The quality of pastries in Nahoums have gone down drastically over the years. Kathleen is way better . Chicken patties was undercooked, I could clearly see the sides raw dough, cheese samosa is the worst. It's shaped like a Momo with some kind of bread inside and hardly any cheese. The heart shaped cake was good. The cakes during Christmas time is good. I had requested the lady owner that I wanted take away and she didn't even bother to heat it in microwave. She assumed I had one at home. Anyways, I gave it a 1 star because the cakes during Christmas are good. I believe mio amore aka monginis and Kathleen are far superior in terms of quality.

Walk into New Market and you’ll have entered one of the most Amazing shopping centrals. Started by a Jewish family almost 115 years ago, Nahoum’s is the most well known bakeries in Calcutta, if not India. The warm aroma of plum cake during the winters (and the Lemon Puffs) have the power to lure you into the dungeons of New Market gullies.

I visit this place frequently during my New Market expeditions. On hot days when a roll seems too much or when my idiosyncratic brain cannot do away the craving for sweets and cakes, it's Nahoum's that I rely upon.

Their Rum Ball smells like Rum: it's absolutely the real deal. Lemon tarts and cheese puffs are again what I find myself nibbling at. They make various cookies, candied nuts, brownies, tarts, cakes, breads and much more. 

I have never had the patience to buy any of the plum cakes made special for Christmas because of the resilient crowd always present at that time. I hope I do better in the future.

When it comes to witnessing the old world charm thru' food in Kolkata, Nahoum definitely makes it to the top 5.. The ambience of this place surely takes you to the yester years but somehow i feel the recipes aren't connecting much, i find the cookies and pastries mediocre, they don't do justice with the tag they have of serving the best in kolkata, in a sentence they still exist for their name..

Nahoums and sons is a legendary outlet in the city of joy. Situated inside the hogg market in the new market area, it's not much to look at. But the food items they sell is just delicious. The cakes, for any of my school programs, is ordered from here. Other than that i have had their chicken patties, chocolate pastry and strawberry pastry. All were fresh and good.

Legendary bakery located in the hog market is known for their cakes. If you go during Christmas you'll invariably find yourself in a queue behind many. On my last visit this is what I tried -
1. Lemon puff- perfectly mild sweet with the taste of lemon crème and soft baked cake! Pure bliss!
2. Chocolate éclair - crunchy from outside with soft chocolate cake from inside its a must try for chocolate lovers!
Both were for 30₹ each!
Do fry if you haven't!

This famous age old bakery situated inside the New Market is a heritage. This place is paradise for tart lovers. Their almond tart and jam tart are awesome and mouth melting. If you go there in the evening then fresh hot chicken patties will be there for you. A different kind of taste with a preparation made of minced meat with rich aroma and flavour. Finally you can have their chocolate brownie-very tasty and soft brownie which a brownie lover like me cant avoid. So next time if planning for shopping in the new market area then must visit this bakery.

If you are a true Calcuttan then there are a few specific places where you should know that you can find the city's heart . Such kind of a place is here which is a baker's and confectionery lover's delight . I came to know about this place from a friend of mine who told me that their brownies are the best however the pattiserie items are more mouth watering . We had chickem puff which was a bit on the drier side , needed more moisture but the cheese puff was excellently balanced . On the sweets side I and my mom had sweet buns which was beautifully engraved with a lot of dry fruits and tasted yum . I brought a few packets of macaroons ( though not like the pictures which google shows us :D ) , marzipans . My mother loves sweets and hence sweets are more on the list , will look forward to have the tarts the next time .

The quality is same as before! Rich fruit cakes, mouth watering pastries or delicious patties or the main attraction of this shop CHOCOLATE BROWNIE is my favourite! 
Here I am adding some pictures of some items! 

Every desert lover know this name, this brand! If anyone left, please visit once to observe, to taste the rich quality deserts

Thank you!

Huge variety of cakes, pastries, patties, biscuits, cookies and what not. Located inside Hogg Market in New Market, people still flog here every Christmas. Prices are reasonable. The interior is a bit dimly lit, filled with wooden furniture and all. Nice place if you like the taste.

The taste is totally different than any other place. I bought some biscuits and soup sticks. Soup sticks are just beyond imagination. It is crispy but not hard and has nice aroma of butter.

Been to this place a while ago. Not too hard to find as it can be easily found in the new market area. You just have to follow the Zomato maps. 

I tried multiples items from their menu. First of all, this shop is too old and their taste remains still so good. I had one of their eclairs, cream roll and date sticks. Date sticks were nice and tasted very well. Eclairs was something different from the rest. It had a unique nostalgic flavor which I couldn't remembered well. And talking about the cream roll... It was awesome! 

Fell in love with this place. Unique german desserts at such affordable prices. I will definitely visit this place whenever I visit kolkata again for sure.

I guess places like these are important to preserve the way they are without any infringement because they embody the stark dichotomy of the new skyscraper-studded lustrous kolkata and the old world "laatshahebi" kolkata. Nahoum and sons has been at the heart of new market for a century now, the bakery which emanates a feeling of nostalgia to kolkatans inevitably. I went here for the first time after some shopping in new market. The place does not offer seating arrangements and it has a dingy feel with wooden cupboards where the pastries and snacks are kept for display. However, the moment you enter the place you are drawn by a luring smell of freshly baked cookies and biscuits which is enough to sweep you off your feet. I had crunchy brownies and black forest. Both of the items were wonderful. It was one of the best black forests I have ever tasted. Though it does not have the perfect glass covered display as we see in other pastry shops like cookie jar or just baked, it is a treat to be here as it has an aura of its own... Would love to visit again and have a go at their much talked about lemon tarts...☺

An entry to Nahoum's after a long time had literally given me a kick at my gastronomy. The aroma itself inside the old New Market shop ( they're​ a bit shabby) is just awesome to get you stuck to a wide variety of cakes and pastries. The quality remains the same as it was before and hence it can easily draw crowd not only from different parts of the city, but also across the country, even from abroad.
As usual, I'm hooked to the all time's great and my favourite Rich Fruit Cake I no time. It is still enticingly brown, rich with dry fruits including lots of almonds and walnuts. It's heavenly and so delicious. This cake is great for all ages and an equal treat to have by one and all irrespective of different age brackets. Do not miss it. Go and grab it. As far as the price, you may find it a little costlier. But if you taste the heaven, I'm sure, you won't mind taking the pocket pinch.

               It maintains its authenticity & standard in terms of quality and never disappoints me no matter what I choose to eat from their classic range of cakes. The chocolate brownies and the chicken patties remain my favorite. Do try the Lemon tart.

It was a month back when me and my husband were about to visit my aunt's (maternal) place. Amongst the bengalese, we have a practise of takings sweets along with us whenever we visit someone's place. However this time we decided to skip the sweets and go for pastries. And guess who helped us in choosing the pastry shop...woohoo Mr. Google. And it was the very famous nahoum for us. This shop is more than 100 years old and sells some fresh baked pastries and patties. We bought the coconut ball, the lemon tart, the lemon pastry, the strawberry pastry, the chocolate pastry, the vegetable patty, the chocolate tart, the orange cookie, the date cookie and the cheese tart. Among them the vegetable patty, the lemon tart, the coconut ball and the orange cookie were out favourite. Each and every item was super fresh and super yummillicious. As they say old is gold, they proved it right being the best in the business till date.

Located inside Hogg Market. Love the rum balls, lemon tart and Marzipans. If you have a sweet tooth you ought to be here. However their quality now is not as it was before. But their rum balls and lemon tarts bring me back here.

It is an institution, though my parents and all the children of the 60s have told me that the quality has dropped but really for me it is a place where I go to when I am feeling blue... The imperfections of the place and the lack of flair is what is endearing and relatable... The place has not changed ever since its inception and the whiff of baked goods as you pass is alluring... The patties are stuffed with filling... Albeit a little dry, and the pastries are to die for.. especially the lemon puff and the black forest... The rum ball is legendary!!! And a Christmas must for me!!!
PS: Nahoum's was established in 1902 and honestly if I had the chance I would like to go back to the day it opened doors and started selling those awesome cakes and pastries and patties.... Time to bring out the timeturner

Have the lemon tart and feel high for a few moments. The chicken patty is decent as well. The brownies are a bliss, especially if you are hungry.

I don't have the audacity to rate a legend but still have to as asked in zomato...This place is definitely a must to anyone goin anywhere nearby Esplanade or park Street ...The staffs are really friendly and helpful... Although they had lot of crowd and they have grown much as a brand still all the staffs are really down to earth...When they saw me looking here and there for help within 2mins a person came and asked me what I am looking for and the ingredients of it and its shelf-life as well.....I mean no other brand as huge as them would take such pain to explain something like this who is not even shopping a lot..... Genueinly loved the service and I purchased a plum cake and two small almond tarts..... Definite visit...

A very small shop inside new market..its very difficult to locate if u dont know the exact shop number or the way. We were a little puzzled on where to search for it since new market in itself is very messy so we had to ask people multiple times till we got here. On reaching we saw the shop that the shop was overloaded with customers and most of the stock was almost over but we managed 4 brownies and 4 chicken patties for ourselves. The price point is fairly decent...neither the store nor the items they sell are well decorated or presented but the items tasted very good. They dont have any facility for warming up the brownies before selling since this shop is almost a wholesale shop. The brownies tasted very good and the chicken patties were fairly loaded with chicken pieces. They were fresh and very filling. The shop isn't very organized but they have kept their mark in their items and what they sell. Overall the place is worth a try.

A must try is their black forest pastry..though priced a little on the higher side..bt totally worth it
No wonder how me n my friends look forward to visit this place whenever we r visiting Hogg market.

Amazing cakes, pastries and brownies! I never miss to visit Nahoum if I'm at Esplanade. My favourite is the plain cake. It's a must in my house for Christmas. I have tried almost all the pastries available and every one of them taste the best I have ever had. Only problem is a newcomer may take some time to find the place in Hogg market, who has never been inside Hogg market before. Place needs no ambience when it gives you food that makes you close your eyes and get lost in the taste!

One such heritage bakeries that I know of in Kolkata! I am not fond of cream rolls in general but their custard pudding roll is to die for! The roll is as crisp and as tasty as a freshly baked cookie while the pudding used isn't as sweet as the cream in cream rolls! It's a must try! Their caramel coated cashews are my personal favourite!Black forest , chocolate truffle and pineapple pastries are found at their best here! Actually there isn't an item from this place that I don't like! Everything here I either love or like 😛
Inspite of being more inclined towards patisseries than confectioneries, I somehow prefer their confectionery items more than their patisseries! Not that they aren't good,but I like the former better! This shop isn't just a shop but an integral part of Kolkata! A visit to this place is a must for everyone! 😃

This probably stands among the oldest bakeries in town. Nahoum's was founded in 1902. We tried to enter using Google maps, but that was a miserable attempt. Finally the local shopkeepers came to our rescue and we located it within a minute. As far as the ambiance is concerned, it is not great, no seating arrangement, people eat there standing. The management has probably not tried to improve it and keep the charm of the Lost days intact. It was moderately crowded when we entered at around 4pm. We had rum ball, lemon tart, cheese samosa, black Forest cake, egg chop and parceled rum balls for my parents. The show stealer is the rum ball, the best I savoured till date. Cheese samosa is also tasty, quite differently done. Lemon tart and egg chop was okayish to taste. Black Forest cake was again quite appealing to my taste buds. Overall it was moderately priced, rather affordable (pricing depends on the target customers actually!). I would again visit this place for tasting other bakery items for sure.
Extremely sorry for the half eaten photos, we were damn hungry after our shopping session and could not wait to click the photos properly.

If you just take a look at the baking history of Kolkata you will find nahoums there, being recommended by one of my friend, and to check that history, rich culture and taste practically you have to be there, the very first thing that actually attract you is that great aroma of baking, you will find baked goods like breads biscuits scattered around you, and all are so fresh that you can feel that warmth of freshness without tasting,
 
Now coming to their pricing, everything priced very reasonably, though their black forest pastry seems to be a bit on the higher side compared to the product.

Talking about taste everything tastes heavenly to me, specially that chicken puff and chicken Mayo puff, that shredded texture was far different than what we get usually. And amongst all the desserts that lemon tart was the best, it feels so fresh that every word is less for that. 
So what are you waiting for just go there and experience the richest ever bakery culture from an authentic place.

Located in the busy New Market. Bit hard to find. The store is huge. They have a good collection of Bakery items. I visited here and tried their Chocolate Pastry. It was really very good. The cream on the top was dense and very good. My friend tried the Black Forest Pastry and it was also excellent.
Prices : Each Pastry Rs.30 very very reasonable for a place like this.

The name speaks for itself, the legend of Nahoum's confectioneries is not unknown to anyone from Kolkata. Sadly, though, it took me this long to actually visit the place. We had many things there - notably the lemon tarts (which are sharp, fresh and delectable to taste, definitely going back for these), the almond tarts (sweet, memorable for the iconic taste of childhood Christmas treats from school), strawberry pastry (perhaps the only average item I had), cheese puff (mild and subtle to taste) and the chicken mayonnaise puff (better than most of the things we eat at mainstream confectionary shops). I'll have to go back to try out the brownies and fudge.

All items range in between rs20-50 which makes it affordable for everyone. You can try whatever you want to but some of my personal favourites are rumballs, chocolate eclairs, lemon puff, lemon tart, cheese cake, fruit bun and pizza puff :) if you try any of these, I don't think you'll be ever disappointed :)

This place is reviewed so many times by so many people, they can actually publish a book of reviews. Nothing much to say other than the same old traditional superior taste of their cakes. But never got chance to taste their savouries/ baked items as there are so many other eating options in Esplanade, reach there tummy full. But nahoum is a brand in its own. Keep going and I would recommend few more generations to go there and have cakes & biscuits.

Nobody in this city needs an introduction to a much celebrated legendary bakery I.e the Nahoum . Those who are aware of its existence have been to the delightful cake store many a times and trust me these are the confectioneries sold here are far better than the ones we usually get from nearby usuals like mio amore . 

Apart from the plum cakes, sweet breads and cookies i personally like the following which I usually gorge upon whenever I make it a point to visit the place . I am not really a big fan of the snacks they provide like the chicken patties . Those are something you better skip and concentrate on the sweet items more .

1. Lemon tart :- Not exactly the original but a smaller version where the cake has a very soft layer with lemon cream sliced in between . It's an absolute delight and a must try .

2. Marzipan  :- This is an age old preparation where ground almonds , sugar and egg whites are used to provide an outer covering of a cake . This is once again a medium sized tart like biscuit where the outer covering is sweet and the inside is soft and tastes like almond . This is a personal favourite .

3. Rum balls :- The ultimate chocolate delight balls where an outer choco cream protects and inner Choco cake . I personally like the raisin inside the cake although many others do not. Although , this is a much eaten item from here and a must try .

The most negative thing about it is the location , the ever so stinky Hogg market . But , amidst all the bad smell lies some good stores and a legendary bakery . It is always crowded and you will have to hassle and tassle to order and eat your food but it's finally worth it . So, those who have not tried it yet do pay a visit and I am sure you won't get dissapointed .

Nahoum is a very well known confectioner located inside of the hogg in New Market. It is a very old and legendary cake house in kolkata. The chirstmas in our childhood was incomplete without the fruit cake from Nahoums and if you ask bongs for any cake shop in kolkata you will definitely heard this name. Their rich fruit cake is still the best in kolkata. Also the custard cream roll is heavenly and it literally melts in your mouth. The pastries are very good too. The prices are really affordable. They don't have any sitting arrangements, so either you have to stand and eat or take-away. Always a pleasant experience.

I had seen the store on national television channel lots of time (on Vicky and Mayur's Food Xpress programme). So I decided to visit the place. On 29th Dec. 2016 I had visited Nahoum and Sons for the first time for their famous light plam fruit cake which cost me 250 bucks. The cake was good but not as per my expectation. The fruit cake actually had no fruits at all, except lots of raisins and some cashew nuts on the top. If it costs between 150-180 then I'ld say that a good cake.
 We also had their chicken patties. They used minced chicken inside it. I think chicken chunks would be great instead of minced chicken.

Other than that, I have tried their chicken patties which are good in taste too. Rich fruit cakes are something you must try there.

I think that it's really befitting that my 250th. review is that of Nahoum and Sons, a confectionery shop that has been a part of my life since my earliest memories. In my childhood days there weren't so many bakeries or confectioners around like today.For me the two that were close to my heart were Nahoums and Flurys. Birthday cakes , pastries etc. where generally ordered from either one of these places. Nahoums was a more regular haunt coz it was cheaper and secondly coz of its location. Being located inside the bustling New Market it was the go to place for pastries and cakes whenever we shopped here. Obviously I be been here countless times because those days this was the only shopping destination unlike today when there are so many new glitzy Malls.Its a big shop, with the old world cabinets  displaying their products. They have stuck to their traditional items and not really introduced too many new items. Their pastries and cakes are different from the other bakeries around because they are a Jewish bakery and that is their USP. That said I really missed those robust, jolly and ever smiling Jewish gentleman who sat behind a wooden desk and took the payments. I've seen one brother or the other being there from childhood ( earlier even two of them). Now they are sorely missed and once again I rue the passing away of an era.
The shop remains the same in a time warp but the people have changed.
I have some items from here that have become favourites over the years and they are the almond tart, cheese cake, strawberry slice, rum balls, choc slice, heart cakes, sweet buns, biscuits like water biscuits, marzipan, Christmas cakes, birthday cakes and also their peppermint sweets. 
Whenever I visit New Market I make it a point to buy from here but alas that is not too often for shopping at Newmarket has become a rarity.
This place has a special place in my heart and it pains me to see that it seems to be floundering somewhat in the new age
But is definitely recommended.

This legendary cake outlet in the heart of New Market has been my favorite since I was a little girl and I remember my parents taking me here after a morning of puja shopping.The tuna sandwiches, the cupcakes, and the rum balls were my favorite those days. The walnut brownies, the marzipans are the ones which I pick up from the store now.Not to forget, during Christmas I line up in front of the shop (well, the line stretches through the whole left span of the market)for their rich plum and fruit cakes which are a cake-lovers' delicacy.The 5 tier Wedding cakes are such a pretty sight, you will often be caught off guard staring and dreaming about them.In a nutshell, all cake and cookie lovers' paradise!

This place is confusing. Zomato lists a huge menu but you only get to see 10 - 15 items displayed and wonder how the rest would be available.

That said, their lemon puffs / tarts are perfect. Not obnoxiously sweet, the flavour of the shortcrust pastry is distinctly memorable.

And their garlic bread is one of the best I've ever had. They are peppery, buttery, garlicky goodness packed in a bread. After trying just 2 items, I do want to give this place another shot!

Nahoums is what legendary stuff is made of! I love the Kookie Jars and the like but it is always so nostalgic to go back to this place. Used to carry Nahoums brownies for my friends when I used to be in college at Bhubaneswar, this time took a friend from Bhubaneswar on a dessert fiesta and he absolutely loved it! The cheesecake is like nothing I've ever had. The heart cake has a lemon tinge to it my friend tells me, the minced fruit cake is missable he says, the almond tart is worth trying. There are times when you hope nothing changes, I feel the same for this place.

Probably the best Cakes that I have had. Being a follower of Subhas Chandra Bose, I came to know of this place during our research. He loved the Nahoum cakes, later on, Bhagwanji, whom we believe to be none other than him, used to ask his disciples to get him cakes from here for his birthday celebrations.

###"RAW EGGSHELL'S FOUND IN THE CAKE "#Below average cakes with very stubborn outlook by the shopkeepers was what I experienced when I visited the place at 24th of December 2016 .......nearly stood in the queue for 30 mins to enter the shop ...and when I finally entered the shopkeepers didn't pay any attention to its customers.....after asking several times they replied harshly they only have 2 kinds of cakes 1.fruit cake 2.plum cake prices:250/400gms, 600/1lb ....bought the fruit and nut cake and came home...                                                                           after returning home eagerly opened the box to experience the quality of a 114 years old cake shop.     1.after the third bite I remained awestruck after finding a big chunk of raw eggshell in the cake.                2. The cake was under baked and felt like it was a HALWA   my brother uploaded the picture of the cake with the pieces of eggshells but I don't know who removed it from zomato might be from the shop but re uploading it again.........the quality of their cakes  has deteriorated considerably after the death of David nahoum in 2012.

Food : We Ordered 1 light Fruit Cake and Few Chocolate Pastry.... Both were below average.... The chocolate Pastry tasted like one of those Old "jalojog chocolate pastry"... Very poor taste.... Fruit cake was most ordinary... for Rs 250/400 gms it was total disaster....

Cost : compared to the taste of food... its very costly....

Service : even stuffs (specially the old guy serving pastry) were very rude....... "Kiser eto gorom ke janey..."

Will never come back for sure...

Being one of the oldest bakery's in Kolkata you expect quality in there cakes.......But now it is not like the golden old days .....We visited the bakerery the day before Christmas and ordered a fruit cake and apart from the cake being undercooked we found pieces of raw egg shells in our cake  you can find the picture attached after this review no dought there are more places better than this in Kolkata. Apart from the cake we also ordred two types of Tart chocolate tart and almond tart but comparing the two types of tarts the almond tart was good and the Chocolate tart was not up to the mark because they must have used cheap quality chocolate in them. On my side there is a big no for visiting the shop again because the so called HERITAGE is long lost.

Crazy Christmas rush is on. Huge queues to just get their plum cakes and fruit cakes and with good reason! This place gives you the legendary feels.  All Calcuttans have tried their cakes here and is a must visit.

one of the favourite cake shops that i love visiting. the decor is just the good old classic style. i love their chocolate pastrys, strawberry pastrys, muffins, and even the egg devils. their creams taste a lot different than any other shop. i personally love their brownies also. the only con is i wish they had a sitting arrangement and they also do not have any branches. the price is extremely budget friendly.

Had heard a lot about this place inside Hogg Market, so decided to give this place a visit. I didn't expect the amount of people that were inside the place but after some fighting I did manage to have a black forest pastry and a mud ball. Took a rich fruit cake home. Absolutely delicious! The pastry was soft and easily melts into your mouth. The fights and the struggles inside the shop because of the crowd was worth it!

After a little shopping in hogg market and doing a little window shopping we saw Nahoum and Sons and decided to try something. My first time here. I tried the brownie. It wasn't bad however I did think it was a little dry. Next time will try something else. Suggestions on what's a must try here?

You haven't seen the culture if you haven't been at Nahoums already. The legendary bakery of Kolkata that has been the reason for happiness for years now. 
Christmas brings along a huge queue waited outside this bakery just to buy their speciality cakes. 
Pastries are decent. Absolutely in love with the fruit cakes.

It's been here since ages.. even my father has childhood memories of this place. If you visit it at a time even remotely close to Christmas, you'll find it packed to the brim and it deserves to be. I have fond memories of going here with my dad to buy Plum cake and fruit cakes on Christmas eve and dad and I always had a rum ball or pastries to while away our time when our cakes were getting packed for take-away. Their cakes and pastries are always fresh and tasty and if you don't manage to be the early bird, there's always a chance of missing out. 

I'd give it a perfect score but I cannot because somehow the staff always finds a way to be rude to us- you see we aren't the types who come in and buy like 50 cakes and the staff goes all gaga over them. We're just a father-daughter duo who are looking to celebrate Christmas with a cake or two so I guess they feel it's okay to make us wait in a queue or sometimes not even respond to our questions and turn their face away. Sadly, we keep going back every year because we still haven't found a place which makes better stuff.

Being a frequent visitor to the New market area, it's quite difficult to miss out Nahoum's. The place is not just legendary but iconic I must say.
The savory, confectionery and the much famed cakes are such a treat to splurge on! The aroma of freshly baked items just lingers here and the taste is one of a kind...no wonder this is one of the city's old charm that still continues to cater, maintaining the same standard.
The only drawback is that this place accepts only cash for payment no other modes of payment options are available here.

This is my city and I wonder why I never visited this shop in person. We are used to the usual way of my father picking up the plum cake from this place every year. So this year, I broke the jinx and visited this place along with my parents in person. This is an Iconic shop in Stuart Hogg Market or commonly known as New Market , since 1902. Most of the employees have been working here for ages. 
My personal favourite here is the lemon tart and light plum cake. You can also buy biscuits, garlic bread, sweet bun, patries and toffees or chocolate fudge. 
When you pass by, you can spot this place easily by the aroma.
Only cautionary note , they still deal with CASH only , no Paytm or Credit Card accepted , hence pls be prepared.

Legendary confectioners of Kolkata, this place has been there for as long as I can remember. I have been visiting this place since I was a toddler. I like everything about here; the cheese puffs, the chicken patties, the rum ball (my favorite) ....the old 70s look and feel, the friendly shopkeepers, the owners readily starting a conversation with you while you are paying your bill....everything! And last but not the least, the rich fruit cake in December, during Christmas. I have been to a lot of places in India and abroad, but I am yet to taste cake remotely close to this in taste. If you haven't been to this place, you have not yet seen half of Kolkata.

Holding fort for one of the last Jewish bakeries in the city,this is not a high on design place. It is not pink , no French furniture or gilded mirrors here. Old fashioned glass fronted cabinets with baked goodies. Try the egg chop ( not available on Fridays ), or the savoury biscuits, the breads and even the fruit cakes. Birthday cakes here have lost its sheen though I remember my first 10 birthday cakes were from here.

What can I say about Nahoum's that hasn't already been discussed extensively? Their scrumptious patties, their out of the world cheese puffs, their wonderful fruit cakes and pastries... My mouth starts watering as I write. I think they make the best cheese puffs I have ever tasted. Their rich fruit cake is a must have on Christmas day. Try their Easter eggs in season. I used to get them as a kid and till date I have never tasted anything better in this city. The pastries-a little sweet, but delightful. Nahoum is without a doubt one of the best bakeries in town. It is a legend.

One of the finest bakeries in Kolkata Nahoum and Sons has a place of it's own in the history of the city . I try to visit this place whenever I am in New Market region not only for cakes but also to witness the rich tradition of this place which is an institution in itself. There was a time when winter in Kolkata was synonymous with cakes of Nahoum's . With passage of time many bakeries have come up but Nahoum still holds its place in the mind of the people. The cakes are simply delicious & mind blowing. The chocolate brownie , heart shaped cake etc. are favourite of mine .Their cakes are a bit hard than the soft cakes made by the new age bakeries but that is their tradition & it has always been so. Visit this place to cherish a rich heritage of Kolkata .

114 years of heritage doesnt come easy and this place is evidence that hard work, commitment to your trade and sticking to your beliefs pays off handsomely. This place is so much more to me especially because its been a childhood haunt. As a child going shopping for mommy utilities was always a treat because of Nahoum's and even now after more than a decade this place is still the same... that i guess is the beauty of it. Its dependable,reliable and always there. This is a confectionary so dont expect seating its more of a check out, buy and go kind of place. Its been around for ages and a lot of the menu has been the same. Which is good because theyve mastered their art and hence their trade. When you go, i would recomend:

1. Lemmon Puff
2. Cheese puff
3. Chicken patty
4. Their special dry brownie (its unique!)
5. Croissant
6. Chocolate rumball
7. Chicken panteras

I could write so much about this place but it wouldnt be relevant so ill stop! However please do go and da word about the staff, they make you feel very at home!!

It is known as one of the legendary bakeries of kolkata and some items available here does live upto that name..i have tried the chocolate eclair here which is the right combo of crunchy and soft..the cheese tart could have been better though and the lemon cake remains as good as ever.The chocolate brownie of nahoums calls for no complaints as well.But with other bakeries fast gaining popularity in kolkata,Nahoums does need to improve themselves more if they wish to hold the same place in market.

There was a time when this place was a must -  visit. This place is a legend. This place is iconic. The irony is that now it is simply a place running on its historic value. Because it is Nahoum, people must visit it, especially the nostalgic older generation. 
Otherwise, there has been no quality up gradation. In fact, quality and finishing are disappointing. It has tough competition from other newer, motivated confectioners.

Their Plum cakes and Brownies are my favorite! Christmas feels incomplete without their delicacies!
Only thing they lack is a place to sit and eat! But that's not much of a problem though.

After hearing quite a bit from my food mentors, I decided to give this a try on my next visit to new market for the Puja shopping, visited on 30th Sept,2016 at 6pm.

The shop was decently crowded and the staff's behavior was just average. The ambiance was pretty much like a vintage movie with basic lighting with tubelights you find at home. 

Most of the fried stuff ran out of stock so we were disappointed and the only non veg item left was the Chicken Patties which we don't generally prefer. A shop with this reputation should have filled counters at 6 in the evening, that's a peak time. 

We took,
3 Chicken Patties
2 Chocolate Pastry
1 Coconut Ball ( Narcoal they called it) 

Patties(7/10): A fair and a decent serve it was. As per the price its alright, won't say it's value for money. It was heated to the right temperature and tasted well enough for a crowded evening.

Chocolate Pastry(10/10): Brilliant choice. The sweetness of each bite is accurate and even which will melt on your tastebuds. The cream is different than what you find in Mio Amore and other alternatives. The cake is thicker than any comparison but soft and very well made. The homemade claim is completely precise. 

Coconut Ball(6.5/10): This was also a decent item. Not too good nor too bad either. Many might not like the smell of coconut oil in this. They head this up as well. It was a crunchy outside and tender inside and its kind of a coconut bread.

This grandpa-bakery inside the Old Complex of Hog Market is (legendary, obviously) a darling ! 

The brownies at 35/- are gorgeous in their crispy crust and generous walnut sprinkles. 
The lemon puff. The sugar dusted cake has a such a great texture, fluffy, pillow-y soft with one hella awesome lemon filling. (Personal favourite)
They also make so many other endearing baked sweetmeats (always a pleasure to walk past the shop with all that aroma of freshly baked things) like sweet buns and puffs, etc. They have these chocolate and strawberry cakes with sugar glaze on top that I loved as a child but don't enjoy anymore because they're too sweet. 

Nahoum is your happy-nostalgic Jewish bakery with all the exquisite recipes and memories. 

Don't give it a miss !

Although I have been well acquainted with this place since I was a kid, I really didn't get to explore the variety of bakes that they offer until lately. I was famished after a tiring day of shoppings In new market and needed to grab a quick bite. Luckily for me I located Nahoum and my eye caught the site of those delectable pastries kept on display.
I ordered a pineapple and a chocolate pastry and boy! The Pineapple pastry was the best I ever had!! Fresh, light and yummy! The chocolate was nothing less although the pineapple was clearly the winner !

Well I'm a crazy cake lover,love anything and everything about cakes! This is my 4th time in Nahoum's and I'm crazy about their Rich Fruit Cake.Their brownies are appealing too.
              The fruit cake is very ordinary, no point going for it.Instead try their hotseller,Rich Fruit Cake.It's stuffed with dry fruits,raisins and "petha". The brownies are amazing here,all studded with nuts.
              Only this time I found the cake a li'l bitter. Apart from this I'm totally satisfied with the cake.Instead of queuing up for hours during the Christmas eve it's worth trying their cakes on any other day throughout the year.This is more because during Christmas eve you can't choose what you buy as they produce only a single kind.

I could say that a visit to Nahoum takes me down memory lane each time. I was introduced to the chocolate fudge by Nahoum when I was about 5 years old by my tutor. It was the weekly reward for the best behaved child at my tution classes and how we would all put up our best front for it. 

That time I did not know where it was, but much later became a regular visitor to the heritage bakery.

On my last visit I tried
The lemon puff :  A flaky puff pastry with lemon curd . Being a lemon fan this was a must try for me and I quite like this one.

Rum ball: a pastry ball with a strong hint of rum, candied fruits and chocolate cake dipped in chocolate sauce. This one was really nice.

Chocolate fudge: This one is a must must try for all. Slightly on the sweeter side but it has a reasonable shelf life so I store it and eat it.

Brownies : They come individually wrapped in cellophane. The size is decent. And it is very chocolatey but just little too dry for my taste.

This place is full of customers on every visit. The taste is quite different from the usual bakeries. But down the years they have maintained the traditional taste extremely well. A visit every month is a must for me.

Location: Inside new market. Just ask anybody!

Nahoum is an institution in baking and confectioners which saw the evolution of 'kolkata' from 'Calcutta'.

During Christmas, people have to queue up for hours before they can lay their hands on Nahoum's cakes.

I absolutely love their pastries. My fave is the rumball! 
I haven't tried much savory here but I like their puff pastries.

Coming to this outlet feels like you have stepped into a time machine and taken back to a vintage era of confectioners, the age old look somehow adds to the charm and coming to the food, well my fav is their almond tart! Simply yum! Tried a few other tarts and pastries, they are good!

We visited this bakery after hearing endless praise about it 
It has an old school feel and you know that the people here mean serious business, as all of them were engrossed in doing there job 
We had lemon puff and pineapple pastry, both of which were absolutely amazing. The taste could tell that the recipe hasn't changed for the years Nahoum as been around, and I appreciate how the standard is still so high 
Will definitely visit the next time I'm in Kolkata!

Nostalgia laden confectionery, one of the oldest bakeries. The cakes, pastries and the savoury food available here is glutton worthy. Situated right between the Old market, tracked down by the lingering smell of the freshly baked goods stark enough to hypnotise you. Please visit.

I have been going to New market for as long as I can remember, for me going to New market also meant enjoying some dessert from Nahoums. It is rather unfortunate that over the years the quality of the products is steadily decreasing whereas the prices of things are increasing. None the less, I do buy things occasionally. If you are in the mood to indulge, do try out the jam tart and peppermints.

I don't mean to discourage anyone, the products I still very tasty and pretty affordable as opposed to Cookie Jar or Cakes. I just judge based on what the brand used to be and what it is now.

It is one of the oldest bakery in kolkata and is still running in good conditions. Their desserts have a home made touch to it and are extremely sweet.

I had a rum ball and one strawberry pastry. Both of them were okay in taste.

We all love Kolkata for it's old world charm. And one of the oldest bakery in Kolkata is Nahoums. Just go to Hogg market and ask anyone, they'll guide you to this legendary outlet. Sensational brownies. However, I can't say the same about the pastries. I love their cookies though. Just go there to get a feel of the oldest bakery in Kolkata. Added bonus is that you'll get to munch on some yummy stuffs.

One of Kolkata's oldest bakeries lies within the Hogg Market.....its the Nahoum's. I go to Nahoum's every time I go for shopping over there. Perfect for the times when you are shopping and want to fuel yourself with some snacks. But yeah.....the food has become really dry over here. Choices are less too and taste is nothing over the top. Its an okayish bakery now. But but but....that special mixed fruit cake they make during Christmas is out of the world. You literally have to pre-order it...!!!

Nahoums and sons bakery is a legendary outlet for cakes,pastries and confectionaries .
Nowadays these shop doesn't keep varieties so I had one chocolate pastry but taste was not that good that I used to have when I was in my childhood days.. any way is should recommend the owner to keep more varieties so that this generation can enjoy..

I love heritage places that have managed to retain their quality and was super sad to know that it was planning to close maybe a year back.
Luckily it hasn't and I hope it never does.

Though Nahoum is a legendary name in Kolkata within the domain of bakeries embedded in the city, I am not much impressed by its confectioneries.
I did taste few pastries and the corn puff, cheese puff & the chicken puff. Pastries were 
not upto the mark where as the chicken puff was ok types. Corn puff and cheese puff tasted bland. 
So according to me, the legendary name doesn't serve the legendary taste anymore.

Its not bad. All I am saying is that it does not live upto its name.

One does not simply live in Kolkata and forget Nahoum. It's simply a jewel in the crown of Kolkata's culinary empire. It's nit only a confectionery but a legacy and a heritage of the city and a fine example of the city's Jewish  connection. I literally gorge on their brownies and rumballs all the time with gluttony.

Amazing , nah??
My father used to bring my birthday cakes from here when I was small n I still remember the taste .
The brownies, the plum cakes , the rumballs are my absolute favourites.

Every-time I think of a cakes and pastries, this is the first confectioneries shop that comes to my mind. May be because I soft cornet for this old shop, but undoubtedly this is shop which introduced me to various cakes, puffs, croissants, pastries, buns, fudges and breads. Sweet cheese bun is one my personal favorite, following fruit and nuts cakes. A must visit for me every time I am near New Market Area, some times deliberately.

When I was a kid, I have been to a dentist 's place to extract a bad tooth. The Dentist asked me the most common question in case, I eat too much cakes, pastries or chocolates ? My reply was simply 'Yes. I love Nahoum's cream cakes & pastries.' The Dr laughed out loud!

My review might be a bit biased towards this place as for me the definition of confectioners is Nahoum's.

My favourite :
Turnovers, Strawberry & Chocolate blocks, Lemon Tart, Cheese puffs , heart cakes

Try the very different Baklava, Marzipan, fruit bun, brownies.

I don't thing anyone can compare their rich plum cake.. 

These are just my favourites .. You need to go there & understand why a 100+ years old Confectionery shop still calls for a queue during Christmas which is longer than so called kolkata's favourite 'Kerosene teler line' lol 😍😍👍

The name is to swear by for any Kolkata resident! In the age of cakes and kookie jars, there's a reason people keep flocking to Nahoums. If you are unaware of that reason, I'd suggest you head over one day and have a taste of their chocolate pastry, lemon puff/tart, cheese puff, blackforest pastry(served right out of the freezer) or any other item on their menu, really. Still in doubt? Then hit the queue on Christmas eve for their oven fresh fruit cakes and you'll never regret the time spent waiting!! 😊

This is one of the confectionary which every traditional foodie in Kolkata has an emotional attachment with. I never miss out on an opportunity to grab a Walnut Brownie when I am around at the New Market, Esplanade. The plum cakes and the muffins are a big hit here. The plum cakes contains enough dry fruit chunks to satisfy a person with a sweet tooth ! Highly recommended from my side to try out at any season in the year, be it the Christmas or any other time. :)

I had heard a lot about this place from the locals and a few travel and food shows. So on a hot Saturday evening, my sister and I finally went to this legendary bakery. We reached there around 5 pm and most of their stuff was over. We had a black forest pastry, a brownie, a cheese samosa and a chicken patty. To our dismay there was nothing special about any of the items ordered. The chicken patty was too oily,the cheese samosa had anything but cheese, the black forest pastry was extremely dry and the only saviour was the brownie. On my way back I realised that this place has an emotional value for the locals here and that is why it's so famous because it's food was nothing but bad.

If you appreciate to sulk into the history of this city, if you happen to have a sweet tooth or if you happen to be a regular visitor at New Market, chances are high you haven't missed out on visiting this legendary bakery atleast once in your entire life. Famed and glorified due to their quality bakery products, the history of this store goes back to the year 1902, when this shop was first set up.

Set up by Mr. Nahoum Israel, who happened to be a Jewish and made his way from Baghdad, this place earned its hype very shortly and happened to be famous even among the British. It was then passed on to his son and then to his grandson, Mr. David Elias Nahoum who happened to pass away in the year 2013. It was during the time of Mr. David Elias Nahoum, that this cafe gathered most of the steam. Even after years of their establishment, the quality still remains the same and is top-notch. Try their lemon tarts, chicken patty, muffins, rum balls, brownie, chicken quiche... Well the list goes on an on!

It is often said, that Christmas is not a Christmas until and unless you have a rich fruit cake or a delicious plum cake from Nahoum and Sons. This shop still brings in the old charms of Kolkata and will rule the hearts of each and everyone of the people who love this city, and make sure that they fall in love with this legendary bakery shop as well!

Located in the heart of hogg market, inside new market; is one of those heritage bakeries that every kolkata-n has visited at least once in their lifetime. It is said that on Christmas Eve people from far and wide come to this store for their yearly does of Christmas Cakes.

I have visited this place on numerous occasions. And though their interiors are not fanciful and their staff irritable, Nahoum's bakery products are famous all across kolkata. I'm extremely found of their plum cakes, brownies and black forest cakes. Especially the brownies, are a must try if you are ever here.

Does the place need a review?? As every citizen of Kolkata, and even people residing other cities are well aware of this place. And my preference for this place is since my childhood, and even today, its a place which is appreciated by family for its awesome delights, it is serving since ages. Specially the "Black Forest" of this place is just amazing. And if you are visiting this place during Christmas, New Year or Easter, you may end up standing in a long queue, and may get disappointed to find your preferred item exhausted. That is the craze for their awesome delights. A must visit for all.

I had been eager to try Nahoum but I must say I was a bit let down. The food was just fine. The one thing I liked was their chicken patties. They were really delicious. Also the garlic bread is quite nice. I love garlic and hence love this bread too! Apart from that, the date tart was okay, lemon tart was fine and the pastries were quite average. I was left bitterly disappointed. But because of its popularity and good reviews, I'd like to believe that the place is a good one and for that reason I will visit again soon to get back on this review.

I've had their egg cups, chicken patties and rich fruit cake even though I do not much prefer a fruitcake. Only Nahoum can make me have one :p Every year during Christmas a throng of shoppers, foodies and dedicated customers flock to this age-old traditional Jewish bakery for delightful treats and snacks.People stand in line in long queus patiently for hours just to buy from this antique heritage shop. The reason is easily discernible why. Cuz the food is worth the wait.

Deconstructing such places for the purpose of rating them is rather difficult. 

Yet, Nahoum and sons continues its tradition with simple straightforward sweetness. It's the bold use of flavours and the classic recipes that brings out the best in what's behind the counter here. 

1. Though its located in the heart of the rather crowded and confusing New Market. You can literally sniff this place out and know that you will enjoy the food here. 
2. It was my first visit today, and we had lemon tarts and puffs, must say... The lemon cream was bold and the puff was perfectly soft, deft craftsmanship.
3. Even after that my sweet tooth wasn't satiated, so we tried a fruit cake slice- classic ingredients, brilliant texture & fresh.
4. Next up chocolate eclair... The cream had an interesting texture, but the biscuit hit the home run for me.

I usually use a criteria for rating the restaurant. This time however the food-gasm threw me off my game.

I was slightly disappointed though, it was 4 PM yet most of the shelves were empty. Then again, whatever was there was brilliant. So, I deduct 1 mark for the empty shelves and all those things I missed so early on in the evening that too.

USP: old world charm, non-fancy-classic recipes, sweet lovers paradise and surprisingly pocket friendly!

Expenditure: 200-250 for 2 persons.

Apparently I didn't like Nahoum as a child. Probably because I'm not a fan of plum cakes and fruit cakes but my family is. So for the longest time I stayed away from this place knowing I didn't like it (also because it's far from home). But then all this talk of lemon tarts and pastries finally brought me back and I'm glad it did.
We had tarts- chocolate and lemon and chicken puffs. All of them were pretty good. The lemon tarts are super light and don't leave an annoying aftertaste in the mouth which is great.
The good thing is that everything is so petite (and pocket friendly) that you can try out a lot of things and not feel full. Although I didn't want to stop eating lemon tarts.
The food and the walk through Kolkata's heritage market are definitely worth repeat visits.

There are places in Kolkata, which actually don't need a review. Because the name itself defines the position it belong to. Undoubtedly "Nahoum and Sons" is one such name, which the city of Kolkata is well aware of since ages. And so far, my emotional attachment with this place is concerned, I've been witnessing this place appreciated by my family since my childhood, for the awesome delights they are providing to treat our taste buds. So undoubtedly, I'm a big fan of their products anyday, and my love for "Nahoum and Sons" will remain intact forever, just the way they have maintained the taste and quality of their awesome delights, consistently, since ages.
A must & must visit for all the foodies out there. And if you are visiting during Easter, don't forget to taste their easter eggs.
Highly recommended.

This is one place that has been associated with the history of Kolkata’s confectionary scenario. For our family, this is the place which is associated with winter indulgences and Christmas celebrations. Their chocolates and plum cakes have made their way to our home for generations.

Well you know there r places which identify a city, Nahoum for me identifies Kolkata, slow to change, ageing, un assuming ,low on glamour quotient..at the same time full of quality, immensely powerful in its products and having a strong culture and following. The cakes as the pastries all of them ....just yummmm!!! People talk of the cakes, for me its the immensely tasteful patties, be it the fish, chicken , cheese or mutton. Every taste just unique and beautiful. For any newbies and calcutta peeps a must visit. ..take a bite of one of everything ;)

Heard and read much about the oldest jewish bakery. I hurriedly tried swimming across oceans full of shoppers in the new market area as I was expecting the bakery to be closed by 8. Finally reached the destination in time just to find out the old charm gilded in wooden furniture taking back you in time.
Surely the placements of their wares, display case, counter, floor, ceiling all represents the era around 100 years back.  I ordered Chicken Patties and trust me it was seriously quite heavily filled. Taste was OK. Additional tied innocent looking Jam Tart. Quality and taste both were great. Happily  left the counter with Rs 50/- for both the items with tummy full and sense of achievement that visited Kolkata's oldest heritage bakery.

VISITED THIS LEGENDARY SHOP IN THE ICONIC NEW MARKET (S.S. HOGG) IN THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER 2015. TASTED ARE THE CRUNCHY BROWNIES WHICH WERE WONDERFUL & GREAT. BOUGHT RUM BALL & SLICE BREAD FOR HOME. RUM BALL IS EXTRA ORDINARY AND DELICIOUS. I AM HOPING TO VISIT THE STORE SOON.

One of my friends ordered her wedding cake from Nahoum & it was a total let down. Leaving that single instance apart, I have always liked their cakes & brownies. It is recommended that you visit this legendary age old Jewish bakery to try the cakes. During Christmas, be ready to wait in the absurdly long queue, but their Christmas fruit cakes are worth it!

This place abviously is a legend! The oldest surviving Jewish confectionary. I have heard the mince pie here is fantastic...and apparently it is so fantastic that every time I go and order for one, they seem to have run out of it. So, sadly never tasted one. I have tried the fruitcakes, lemon pop, cheese samosa. The items are unquestionably unique in themselves.

This place is legendary indeed! Very popular among us, sweet tooth-ed creatures of Zomato and Kolkata. Their mutton samosas are a delight, and those pink pastries are my favorite (excuse the ignorance, I have always dug into then without sparing a moment to read the tags). The cakes are delicious.
You need to experience it, to believe it.

It's a legendary place...enough said...
Located inside the new market old complex...this confectionery itself looks heritage...one of the oldest bakery of Calcutta....their pastries n puffs are very different from the normal one's and may be that's cuz of the Jewish influence...and I somehow like it alot.... Just love their strawberry pastry....they make really nice chicken/tuna/egg sandwiches and also mutton samosa's...but these samosa's n sandwiches are only available on Saturday.... And it gets over by 1-2 pm Max.... :( 
Try out their brownie.... heat it a bit before eating, u'l fall in love with it... :) and how can I forget their rich plum cake/Christmas special fruit cake...well, that's the best fruit cake I have ever eaten.... Non makes a fruit cake like that...I bet 1 can't eat a slice and not take a 2nd one...I've been Goin to nahoums since my childhood and i'v had almost everything over ther....not everything is nice over there....but certainly most of them are..
Their rich fruit cake is always on top of the list...i would say its one of those dish one shud eat before they day....and then they've got these marzipans, fudges etc...really like few of the items...the photos that i'v uploaded are all one of my favourite items from nahoums...

Well, what an experience. Heard about this place many times, mostly great reviews and crowd gathering during Xmas and year end.
This year I decided to check it out myself. On my sweet sweet mother's birthday I decided to give her a Nahoum treat. Visited early in the morning. Around 11 am. Crowded indeed. Normal new market style shop.

On asking at the counter, there were two main cakes available the fruit cake normal and the rich plum one. I decided to go with the latter for my mother loves these compared to cream cakes. Along side I also took cream roll, her favourite. 

Well, in the evening we had a small ceremony and then had my first Nahoum bite. It's deliciously yummy. I generally dislike fruit and plum cakes, more of a cream cake person. 
But this changed my perspective. Smooth creamy and the taste was just awesome. The cake had a nice smell. A flavour actually.
Cream roll was ok. A new kind I had, i must say. 
Awesome, definitely recommended.

Again I want to keep it really very very simple - my Christmas and New Year celebrations are of "no meaning", "useless" and "incomplete" without the rich plum cakes and rich fruit cakes from this legendary 113 years old Jewish bakery established in 1902 by Nahoum Israel, an emigrant from Baghdad. The legacy is still continuing the same way even after the death of owner David Elias Nahoum in 2013. Whatever the situation had been, or may be in future, I have queued up in front of Nahoum and Sons, and promise to queue up in future to buy the cakes every year.

Friends, do I need to say anything more?

A legendary restaurant is a common term associated with Nahom. A baker that has been feeding the city of Kolkata for many decades now completely engulfs the new market area with the aromatic goodness of its baked masterpieces. From cakes, pastries snacks and other innovative baked exhibits Nahom will always be my go to bakers and the best anywhere in eastern india.

This 113 years old Kolkata's iconic Swiss-style Jewish bakery was set up by Nahoum Israel, an emigrant from Baghdad. For more than a century this place still remains a holy spot for all the foodies craving for brownies, muffins, pastries, tarts, Christmas plum cake or fudge. After Nahoum Israel opened up this shop in the year 1902 it became an instant hit with the then British population and the Anglo-Indian community of old Calcutta. Then the local Bengali foodies also started warming up to these delicacies! After Israel, his son Elias took over and then David Nahoum took the reins. Recently David also passed away at the ripe age of 86 in March, 2013. But Nahoum's confectionery still remains the same, it is still synonymous to the old Calcutta. This Swiss patisserie inspired bakery never compromised with their quality and that is why it is still going strong after so many decades and through so many generations. The shop has got several famous customers in recent past as well, like Suchitra Sen, Manna De, Pearson Surita, Bob Wright, Aparna Sen, Usha Uthup, filmmaker Anjan Dutt, Geoffrey Fisher, etc. The place is one of the most visited spots of New Market, it is basically the place to do some 'tucking in' after or in-between shopping sessions at New Market area. 

LOCATION ----- The legendary bakery is located inside Hogg Market, while entering the Hogg Market just ask anyone about Nahoum's and you will definitely get the directions from him/her :)

AMBIANCE ----- Today also the place maintains that same vintage look and feel like it was then in 1902. The interiors and the overall ambiance have never changed and till today it is all the same. When you enter this place you are in a time warp and for me this enigmatic sense of time travelling is extremely thrilling apart from the fact that this place in itself is a gastronomical wonderland. The place still has got all those age old teak wood furnitures and structures, high ceilings and old ceiling fans. The place is not just an over the counter kind-of shop. It has got huge area inside and is quite spacious. The food products are placed at several locations inside the shop and you can walk upto them and pick them according to your preference. It has got one old-fashioned glass showcase where various delicacies are displayed that will attract the passerby. All these old world charms put together this place turns out to be an absolute gem of a bakery.

FOOD ----- The food is definitely the strongest point of this place, the reason why it is still going strong and why people come back to this place even today when so many new-age bakeries and fancy cake shops are mushrooming in every part of the city. Even today old loyalists of Nahoum’s swear by their brownies, fruit cakes, tarts, plum cakes, macaroons, fudge, etc. last week when I was again here at this place I tried out several products like:

a)	Brownies ---  The brownie available at Nahoum’s is very typical of this place, sort of a trademark product. It tastes amazing but it is bit dry and brittle in nature, prices are extremely reasonable and one should try this out for sure.

b)	Chocolate Fudge & Vanilla Fudge ---  On my special request a separate assorted packet of chocolate and vanilla fudge was prepared for me which I carried back home. It is small in size, one packet has got numerous fudges. I personally love the chocolate fudge over the vanilla fudge. Both are soft, smooth textured, extremely sweet and surely they do exude happiness and innocence. Loved by the kids.

c)	Heart Cake ---  One simple muffin that is shaped like a heart symbol. It is so unadulterated and heavenly that you just can’t have one! It is super soft and fluffy and with every bite you will feel like you are on cloud-nine. And it costs just INR 20/- per piece.

d)	Choc-o-Nut Biscuits --- Yes, you will get various kinds of hand made biscuits here at this bakery that will surely entice your tastebuds. I decided to carry back home one packet of Choc-o-Nut biscuits which are actually very different to taste than regular chocolate biscuits available elsewhere today. It tastes subtle, not overtly sweet, a bit dry but has a lasting sense of chocolaty bliss once you take a bite. It has got desiccated coconut powder, maybe that causes the dryness. The shapes are in general square but shape and size varies since they are cut manually. One packet of these biscuits will just cost you INR 35/-.  

SERVICE -----  I was really impressed by the enthusiasm of the people serving at this place, such legendary places rarely can boast of great service but this place is an exception. The person handling our order was patient, polite, helpful, well-informed and friendly. He seemed very dedicated to his job as well. The products were billed pretty swiftly and cash was accepted at the counter. 

OVERALL -----  Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 4/5

Food quality: 4.1/5

Value for money: 4.3/5

Ambiance: 4.5/5

Service: 4/5 

I seriously had an amazing experience each time I visited Nahoum’s. Apart from all these well known items, they have also got buns, breads, cookies, etc which taste way better that packaged buns, breads or cookies available at normal shops. Today after all these years the bakery is running in a much better way, it has been made more streamlined and efficient. So this vibrant place will spread more happiness and give us their signature bakery products for years to come. If you haven’t visited this place then please do pay a visit. And for tourists, a trip to Kolkata is still incomplete even today without one visit to Nahoum’s. Let the legend live long!

Cheers!
                                          ...

Once upon a time relishing lip smacking cakes and tarts with Nahoums was welcomed with open arms. But of late the quality has dipped to a disappointing level...i remembering the lemon puff cakes melting in my mouth after those typical after school trips to new market with dad and mom. However of late the cakes and tarts taste average...guess have lost their Midas Touch

A Pioneer in the confectionary world of Kolkata,'Nahoum's and sons',.Situated long ago(almost 113 years ago),this place still catering to satisfy kolkatan's taste buds.This is the last trail of the jewish people in kolkata!!This place has acquired a 'cult' status in the bakery world of kolkata!!
LOCATION:-Itz situated in the old new market,in an alley.Ask anyone in that area.and u'll b guided to this place in no time.Whenever i am near this during x-mas,u can be dragged by the aromas from this place.
SERVICE:-This place is always crowded,for their impeccable quality and value for money ,.U have to wait a bit for ur turn.Their servers are pretty fast though.
AMBIANCE:-Nothing to boast..this is aplace that resonates and sustains the old school charm.This place justifies the phrase"never judge a book by itz cover".
Now,they have a plethora of delectables,amongst which following are my staple and favourite:-
1)Fresh Plum Cake:-Yummy and heavenly!!Out of the world!!
2)Lemon tarts:-tasty!!
3)Strawberry Pastries:-Nahoum's is amongst those few places which i love in having strawberry pastries.
4)Chocolate fudge:-Prefectly chocolaty and gooey in taste..it is not overdone.
5)Blackforest pastry:-Very soft,fluffy and yummy!!
6)Chicken puff:-In the savouries,my staple is their chicken puff.
7)Baklava:-Tasty!!
Try anything from thius list and i bet,a foodie with a sweet tooth and those who are not,even they will be in love with this place!!!
A value for money and tickle to the tastebud..Nahoum's and Son's.

A recent visit to this ol' and oh -so-popular bakery..Nahoum brings back nostalgia and special childhood memory.. this age old shoppe in the new market has so many childhood memories attached to it..I can remember from my early years,when I was a kid ,used to go for pujo shopping with mah mom n dad and at the end we used to binge on those big choclaty rum balls.😈 Although my mom's favourite is the lemon tart..😁
This quaint lil shop tucked away in one corner of old new market I.e one of the many alleys of SS Hogg market...
May people have the question on their mind that what things drives people to Nahoums?? So...for them Nahoum is the part of Bengali Folklore and undoubtedly one of the brightest chapter in the history of Kolkata's food heritage run by a group of Jewish people gives the perfect aroma of freshly baked goods...
Its quality has impeccable for as long as I can remember..Though the shoppe has lost its shine but one can inevitably drawn to it due to the gastronomical memories attached to this place...I think the savoury snacks that they make are finger licking good ..🐱
In now days I try to grab a bite whenever I'm in that area..They serves fresh baked items -gold standard at a very reasonable price..😃

If it's Nahum then it has to be cakes an only cakes. They sell amazing and delicious cakes of various kinds. But at the same time they serve pathetic snacks. Being situation in the new market area, this place has its existence since the British era. I tried chicken patties there and unfortunately I had to throw it it's too bad and cannot be taken into. So never do the mistake of buying snacks from nahum if here, then go for cakes only.

Finally got the oppurtunity to visit this legendary bakery shop. Nahoum and Sons need to special description; the name has its own weight. Today visited this place with my family. On entering the shop,the smell of bakery items was so good. The aroma was itself like a nesha 😁 coming to the food, i took chicken patties,macaroons,chocolate pastries and brownies. The patties and macaroons were tasty. The quality of the chocolate pastries were good. Brownies were so good and yummmy. Just needed one scoop of ice cream on top of this brownie. If i come to Nahoums i will come for their brownies. Delicious. I loved their bakery stuffs. Hope to visit the place soon.

Regular at nahoum's whenever we visit new market area! This place was a bit tricky for me to locate when I first visited alone as it is situated among one of the numerous alleys of hogg market. The pink strawberry square cake with the black eye in the middle has my name on it every time I visit, whilst my mother takes the pineapple one, and my father and brother take the chocolate cakes. I've never had anything from nahoum apart from baked goods, so my review maybe a bit limited. Yes, we are also a nahoum's bread-hoarding family, I personally prefer their garlic bread over any other bakeries.

If its festive season then entire Kolkata goes to Nahoum. Christmas isn't complete without their Plum Cakes and Rich Fruit Cakes. In the modern era of pastry making art Nahoum is deep rooted with heritage and classic cake making. Its rustic and lacks glossy finishing or topping but the taste will rule over your heart. 
I liked their Plum Cake compared to Rich Fruit Cake. Along with that one can't afford to miss Rum Ball and Lemon Puff.
Cost will be cheaper compared to Cakes or Kookie Jar but remember it lacks cosmetic glossy finishing like recently formed pastry chains.
Ordering during rush hour is a bit challenge here. No bills were given or rather due to rush didn't get a chance to ask for the same.

Started by a Jewish family a long time back, Nahoum's has been keeping up with the tradition of serving the best cakes available in not just New Market area but the city too. Located inside new market, on one of the dingy lanes, this bakery is a treasure hunt. Try the Christmas cakes without a miss. Delicious when hot. Smells and tastes great. I tried the Chicken Puff and Chicken Patties too, they both tasted similar, with different shapes, as the minced chicken stuffing inside is the same, which they need to change. The prices are reasonable. One might have to wait in queue for some time to get what they need on special days. Overall, a great bakery!

Nahoums is a heritage in the field of bakery confectionery. Its cakes & pastries are mouth watering.
The must try is the Tuna Sandwich. It simply melts in the mouth. After finishing one, our minds ad taste buds always seeks for another; kind of a vicious circle.
The ambience is not good; located deep with in the labyrinths of New Market (aka Sir Stuart  Hogg Market - who designed the plans), this very old Jewish Bakery was founded in 1902 & moved into the New Market in 1916 and has remained the same ever since.
The interiors are though non appealing & predominantly a take away counter, it bakes some of the best cakes in town unparalleled in taste.

Still a regular here, it's a pity I missed the Christmas cakes this time. Oh yes, the biggest USP of  this place - the price and the amazing quality of the cakes you get for that price. :)

Firstly it is a sin that 23rd December, 15 was my first visit to this place. Around 5:30 I reached the F block of New Market and joined the queue. Quite shockingly I saw that at least 500 people were standing before me. Everyone was keeping their finger crossed whether they would win the trophy (i.e.the fruit cake) or not. After 1 hr finally I reached the counter and 2 no.s of Rich Fruit Cake (everyone was buying that only) which costs 250/-. Another variant i.e. light fruit cake was also available costing little less 220/- per 400gm piece.

People who love the smell of baked food and have a tooth for confectionary literally patronize this place .. serving calcutta and kolkata since 1902 this place doesn't need a review. People queue up to enter this bakery before christmas. Its the bakery for the mass ... nothing luxury as you see on lifestyle channels...nahoum's and sons ... baking happiness for a century...
PS if you happen to be in kolkata and really love that 'baked' flavour .. try their black forest and the tart.

Nahoums' pastries are amazing in its own way. Original and consistent taste since so many years. They have not added much to their rack. But the chocolate pastry, strawberry cake, cheesecake, cheese puff are all amazing.

Review is unnecessary for this confectioner. Christmas in Kolkata starts with Nahoum & Sons. 

My personal favourite is Rum ball. The chocolaty rum ball tastes heavenly. Just a bite and it melts in your mouth. 

Strawberry cake is another favourite. 

But for Christmas, Plum cake is a must. 

Nahoum & Sons has been established in 1902. Still now, they have managed to survive in glitzy world of cafes and bakeries. 

Same old taste and affordable pricing are the USP of this grand old confectioner in Kolkata.

Hopping through the lanes of New Market is a foodie’s delight to try everything right from Kolkata’s traditional food to its Jewish confectionaries. Nahoum and Sons, Kolkata’s famous Jewish Bakery in the New Market holds a special place in Kolkata confectionery. This place was established in early 1900s and is run today by the owner's grandson. However, finding this shop in the maze of other shops is quite a deal for a first timer like me. 

This is an excellent place in city’s New Market area with stacks of brownies, tarts and a wide spread variety of cakes, biscuits and pastries. It was indeed a delight to try their Jam tart and Plum Cakes. 
Nahoum and Sons still manages to stand the test of time with their classical offerings. Do try this place for a slice of history and confectionaries. You wouldn’t be disappointed.

This is my first visit to this place after hearing a lot from all round for years. I went on a weekday afternoon on the week before christmas. And we had a lot of difficulty finding this place amongst those small lanes of New market. First of all if u r going by a car be prepared to go around the place for good 15-20 minutes before u even find a parking space and even when u find a parking space; b prepared to shell out a whopping 50 bucks parking charge for each hour. Next wen we reached to this place it was a heavily crowded shop with no queues. People were jostling to reach the counter and finally wen we reached the counter after lot of "ElbowFights" ; people from behind started shouting "Aapnar holo" (R u done). We couldnt even ask what all was available and had to take whatever we could manage in those two minutes. To be very honest I saw the cake only after coming home, not before buying. 
So u can understand the kind of rush. 
But the kind of prices they charge is nothing less than other big cake shops and i would suggest u can visit this place if u want to bask in the nostalgic glory of the history of cakes of kolkata, else try other places, like Kookie jar or Cakes.

I absolutely adore their brownies. If I am in New Market, I always try to stop by and pick up a few of them. Apart from that, I love the fish pantras though you got to be really lucky to have them in stock. They are almost always over every time I visit. It's exquisite and packed with cheese. Apart from that the chicken puff is really nice. I also love their assortment of cookies like the raisin ones and the chocolate and orange ones. There was a point when I was working in Park Street where I used to walk over to Nahoum's every other day to buy their cookies and biscuits. It's very affordable and more than anything, each visit makes me tremendously nostalgic.

It's amazing to see how Kolkata's last Jewish confectionery Nahoum and Sons still holds its ground in this ever-changing world.Whenever I came into this place, it seemed that time had stopped.Located in Hogg market or more commonly known as New market, this shop is legendary in one word-and I don't know if it's for the choco-fudge or brownie that foodies still crave.It feels so nice to see that there are things in this city which even time doesn't dare to mingle.

It's a legendary bakery known to have it's existence for quite a long time. Located in New Market, the place is known for their pastries, tarts, cakes, biscuits, breads and other freshly baked items. The store attracts huge footfall as New Market shoppers stop-by for some of their delectable pastries.

Tried a couple of items from here, unfortunate all of those were fast food items. Since I live far from New Market, I would not want to take their pastries and mess them up halfway to my home while traveling. Anyways, when I visited them, I got myself some biscuits which were really nice and crisp. I enjoy them with my morning cup of coffee. Fast-food items include Chicken Patties, Chicken Puff and Fish Pantras. Chicken Patties and Puff both tasted same and were very compact in size. Fish Pantras was cheesy from inside, made up of fish crumbs. Overall, they make up very good evening snacks.

Pricing is very nominal, it's not the olden days pricing but will not hurt the pockets though. Ambiance wouldn't be the best if the store is crowded up to capacity.

In a nutshell, highly recommended. Would surely try their famous lemon tarts and rum balls someday :)

This should be declared as the dessert capital of india. The rum balls here are worth dying for. Also the cakes, pastries, buns, cookies, marzipan etc are far better than Flurry's. Set inside the crowded New Market with an old worldly charm this place houses the best patties, puffs and exceptional cheese samosas. Try their garlic bread, plum cakes and many other items. Packed some items for Delhi.

Nahoum is one of the oldest bekary in the town.first time i heard about the shop when in scl in an intervew of Mr. Anjan Dutta,so i hav quite an idea abt the historisity of the place. now starting wit the location u can say it s a hidden treasure as it s situated in the old newmarket.if u r a fresher jat go & ask anybody wil reach to the baked paradaise.well when i entered in the shop the stafs were really busy to pack some wedding cakes & it was my first time when i was perceiving a huge cake lik that.it was looking lik a beautiful goun for the bride.one word may b eligant.it s a very tiny place but as it s said big things come in small packages.i teasted their lagendary lemon tart according to the xprt advice.it was nice but what killed me was their chocolet fudge, chicken meo patti & almnd crm rol.i was so wishing if i can hav a slice from those magical wedding cakes😂😂. better to conclude being there is like being the part of the legasy.happy me😊😊

The first feeling when I walked into the shop....nostagia... An old English bakery, this place still continues to make cakes and bakes in the way it used to abt 15, 17 years ago. Well, that's only as far as my memory goes that is... I rember being a child n welcoming my father home to the smell of freshly baked heart cakes from Nahoums'. Good memories really... Having tried the confections 15 years later, I am still awstruck at the simplistic yet amazingly tasty treats they hav to offer. Great quality goods for such great prices!! N the variety! I only got to try the lemon tart, lemon puff, the almond pastry and the cheese cake there, but I'm definitely going back for more. Great shop. Great experience. Definitely worth a try.

The legendary confectionery shop located at the shopping centre of the city-Esplanade,is a nostalgic must visit for each and every Calcuttan. A wide variety of mouth watering pastries are available for all those with an extra sweet tooth. The lemon and chocolate tarts and Chocó éclairs are a must try amongst the other variables. Also it is fairly priced so overall it's a good destination to satiate that sugar rush. They have to however try a little harder to keep up with the contemporaries and not rely on nostalgia alone.

Truly legendary!! I should be ashamed to say that this was the first time I went there. Well better late than never.. This oldy is surely overloaded with nostalgia and smell of fresh bakes. I was amazed by seeing baklava and other such assorted deserts for such less price. 
We tried , lemon puff, lemon tart, cheese puff and almond puff.
Loved all of them. The tart had a pastry base which is unlikely, and rest was typical British style baking.. Kind of my first.. 
This was a love at first sight.. 
Will go there again and again

It smells of old memories. Memories of Christmas cakes full of dry fruits, cookies (we called them biscuits at that time), fluffy pastries, birthday cakes......the very place reignites so many fond memories. Took one of my Keralian colleague to this place for making him taste a part of Kolkatas heritage. He was floored by the taste. If you are a true blue Kolkatan, you have visited this place at least once in your life.

Once I entered this place, thr smell took me to my childhood. The same smell of "cream cake" was all over the place and I got biased regarding this legendary cake shop.
Situated in the middle of  Hogg market, this place gives you a feeling of old days. Decor, wooden cash box all these things will remind you that you are in a 100 year old bakery. Only mosern thing I noticed was the refrigerator!
Now coming about food, we took pineaplle pastry ( I felt cake portion could have been more soft, cream was loaded with flavour), heart shaped plain cake ( With each bite, you can taste butter).
Nex time you are in New Market, please give it a try.

I have been visiting this outlet ever since I stepped in New Market. I love the sophisticated looks of the stall as well as the behaviour of the staff. I love rum balls here and time and again I have taken their bread sticks home to eat with soups. But my most favourite is their rich fruit cake. It is very difficult to procure one, because of its huge demand, but once you eat a piece of it, you will forget all other branded cakes and run for this one. This is one place where the service has not deteriorated as yet.

This place had been famous for its bakery in kolkata for decades. However I feel the quality of bakery has actually detoriated over the years . But still whenever I visit new market I alway have to visit this place. Today we tried out the famous pan cake which is basically the heart shaped cakes . Also the lemon tart which had a stink to it. The shopkeeper was kind enough not to take payment for the tart! We also tried out the sweet buns . They tasted very ordinary however I do have issues with their hygiene system. The cakes are all displayed in the open with flies everywhere! The pastries looked yummy but with flies all around them We didnot want to try them! This place needs to upgrade their hygiene standards. The chicken puff was fresh yet was too oily for me. We bought a pack of date sticks which tasted fine. The prices of this place as compared to the other baking shops in kolkata is much less and cheaper

Enter Hogg Market. Ask any shopkeeper for Nahoums and they will direct you!

The brownie is tasty.
The pastries have the right about of cream on it (Read: Not too much)

The winter plum cake is a must try!

I did not like the macaroons much!

It is pocket friendly and that is another reason to come back to Nahoums.

Now I will have Haters on Zomato for this review. I am going to be blunt, so I apologize to all Nahoum'ers out there. 
I am all for tradition and nostalgia but the Gourmand in me thinks otherwise. Nahoum has lost its steam. The pastries are bland and too one dimensional. The walnut brownie is lacking lustre in terms of the flavor. 
The macaroons have lost their sheen. The rum ball is obnoxious. That is what I felt about the food. However, as a Bangali, I will always be in love with Nahoum.

This place stands for tradition. Christmas still means waiting with bated breath in the long queue outside Nahoum for its super delicious fruit cake. They also serve the best brownie in town. Besides these two, the rum ball and the garlic bread tastes quite nice. They used to offer masala bread which was equally scrumptious but sadly, it isn't available now. Highly recommended.

Christmas isn't complete without Nahoum's. It's just that warm fuzzy feeling you get when you enter their shop on the christmas eve. A fantastic cake shop for all your Christmas confectionery needs and a must for every Calcuttan during Christmas, it still has that vintage Calcutta feeling attached to it. You won't be finding many places around the city anymore which still have that nostalgia attached to them.

Nahoum's is a landmark. I've heard of mum and the singer, Anjan Dutta, lament the shutting down of D'Gama's. And I'd never want such an end for Nahoum's. Having said that, I must concede that nostalgia colours people's reviews. The quality of Nahoum's is not as good as it once was and I would know that because my birthday cakes without fail came from there every year - the cake would be in the shape of a huge number, corresponding to my age. This went on till I didn't want my neighbours to know what my age is! Today I would go back to Nahoum's perhaps only for their rum-balls and brownies. Those arguably are still the best in the city. And I'll go there every time I visit the city and can spare a couple of hours specially for New Market.

My visit to Nahoums was a much awaited one. I had been hearing glowing things about its confections. At the bakery, I had the lemon puff and cheese samosa, both of which were delicious. I would say that both were at must-try levels. The puff was warm, light, airy and aromatic with a lemon punch. That puff was everything! The samosa was a sinful indulgence. I took home their pineapple and strawberry pastries and chocolate log. The pastries were nothing to write home about. The log was marginally better but still chewy. Overall, underwhelming. My guess and hope is that the key was freshness. Until next time.

One of the oldest bakeries located in Kolkata. It is inside Hogg Market & if you ask anyone out there inside Hogg Market all of them will show you the direction to this old place. As we say "OLD IS GOLD" I would rather consider it to be a goldmine. They are special for their fruit cakes & if you go there during the christmas time, you will find that their stocks are over. Other than that, their Blackforest Cake is a must try. Their Lemon Tart & Chocolate Tart are gems of the menu. Keeping sweet on the side, if we talk about the savourey, their Chicken Patties is pretty good. You can also try their Cheese Samosa, Fish Roll & Cheese Puff. But my most favourite is the Sweet Bun & The Jam Bun. A must try for each & everyone.

My mom watched a travel show which mentioned this place and so I went here early morning. We tried various items here,all of which were rightly priced. Cheese pattice was crisp, almond tart was perfectly nutty, black forest cake was different from the common ones. Since this place dates back a hundred years almost it's a must visit place.

Serving for 111 years this is a legendary bakery shop of Kolkata. This is the best bakery shop and favourite of mine. Everything they offer is great. Price is unbelievably reasonable. The biscuits,cookies,patties,bread,choco fudge,snacks are of the old reciepe and satisfy our taste buds. All the items specially the garlic bread is very much in demand and is hardly available after noon. They offer the best brownies ever. On christmas eve you have to wait in a long que to avail the best cakes even if you go on 10 a.m. The decoration is very simple,everything is old school and traditional. The quality is unbeatable. They do not have any seating arrangement.

This place dates back to the history of Kolkata, when it was a British capital. The shop possess the old day charm and has hardly been renovated. 
The place is clean and have a aromatic feel of fresh baked cakes. 
Their palm and fruit cakes are famous. 
But yes the quality has deteriorated a bit
When I went last day I had one heart cake, one chocolate swiss roll, one chicken puff. 
The heart cake was awesome, buttery and soft. The chicken puff was also good but there was no chicken piece, it was all ground meat. The chocolate swiss roll was not that good, the cake was rubberish and the chocolate cream was not that great. 

The place gives a historical touch to your pallets but in recent times many other confectioners have opened up.

It's a name which is intrinsically related to a lot of Kolkatans' childhood memories, including mine. The place still manages to cash in on its old world charm and has not bogged down to the spurt of innumerable bakeries in the city. 
All their sweet products are a little overtly sweet and sugary. But I absolutely love their brownie. 
You could give their savouries a miss. But their biscuits and vanilla and chocolate fudges are worth trying.

The Jewish confectioner Nahoum's in the New Market holds an uncommon place in Kolkata (Situated in one of the numerous alleys of S.S Hogg market) confectionery. Established in 1902, Nahoum's moved to its present area in the New Market in 1916. It is run today by the first proprietor's grandson, David Nahoum. A Jewish wedding in Kolkata following a crevice of 50 years in the 1990s got a considerable measure of media consideration. After the foundation of Israel, numerous Kolkatan Jews left to live in Israel and the span of the Jewish group had an extreme decrease. Nahoum & Sons (estd. 1902) is genuinely notable, with its unique mahogany cabinetry and marble counters. For over a century, a great many clients have sworn by Nahoum's Rich Fruit cake, its brownies, marzipan, macaroons and a great deal more. Imperial Confectioners and D Gama compete for a close second and third place.

I love their fruit cake that they sell during the festive season. You can taste additionally with Plum cakes, treats and mince pies, tart and Chicken mayonnaise. Each time I'm in Kolkata, I always remember to visit this spot.

I was introduced to Nahoum's during my childhood days, which was like 20- 23 years ago, by father.
And today it's very disappointing to say that Nahoum's has totally lost that charm.
I think today we have plenty of other beautiful cake shops serving outstanding cakes and pastries and Nahoum's have lost this competition to them.

It would be really nice seeing Nahoum's spring back to life. Not only for me, but for plenty others as well.
It's a place filled with immense nostalgia for every Kolkatans.

This is probably the best example of the original Calcutta bakery that we have heard or seen in the books.The brownie here will be the all time favourite sweet dish that is served out here.The plum cake especially that which is made during christmas is far better than any confectionary in Kolkata.

Nahoum is part of the Bengali folklore. If you love cakes and pastries and are a Kolkatan  and haven't visited Nahoum then you are seriously missing something in life. They have delightful cakes and pastries and have been the hub of Kolkatans during the Christmas. Visit it for its antique appeal and awesome cakes.

Nahoum and Sons is old school. It reminded me of the old stores in Nainital. Don't they just smell wonderful? It takes you back in the memory lane to those sneaky glances and long lost laughter. It was an impromptu visit. We went to Esplanade in search of an outlet that had shut down, so to overcome the disappointment we went to Nahoum and Sons. Don't ask me for the names because I don't know any. The icing on the pastries was a little sweet but the cake sponge inside. Waaaaahh. It was amazing. So goood. Reminded me of my home. I ate the veg patty too. Yumm. Proper Boarding School stuff! 
Too much missing happened in this bakery. Definitely going back!!

Located in one of the many alleys of S.S Hogg market, Nahoum and sons are one of the best bakers and confectioners I've come across.  The savory snacks that they make are finger licking good and their biscuits are heavenly too. Though the options for vegetarian are limited, I try to grab a bite whenever I'm in that area.

Nahoum and Sons is undoubtedly one of the brightest chapter in the history of kolkata's food heritage..A true legend in all sense I don't thinks any comprehensive study of the culture and history of this City can be completed without a special mention of this century old Bakery..Situated in Hogg Market this place amidst all the fuss of globalisation is still run by the descendants of Jesus Christ,the original Jewish community of Kolkata..In fact if you want to visit the Magen David Synagogue at Ezra Street you need to get a written permission from this place only.. My association with this place has been for 4 generations and even before I developed my senses I have actually grown a taste bud for their cakes.. I haven't spend a single Christmas in last 20 years without their signature Rich Plum Cake..I also adore their Rich Fruit Cake..Other favourite items includes their Sandwiches,Minced fruit tarts and their in-house cookies..Even today if you visit Hogg Market surely the mesmerising and sinful smell of butter and fresh baked cakes will catch your nose and it will lead you to this shop even without knowing the path..Having said everything I guess their most important aspect lies in the fact they have actually never compromised with their raw materials and at the same time not incrasing the rates too much..I guess this has been the major factor behind their ever increasing popularity..

How does one describe a place that has been a part of your growing up years like your school or a playground? You can probably describe its physical dimensions but how will you put to word the feeling that the place invokes in you- the joy of running your tongue over the sticky chocolate fudge stuck between your teeth, the heartbreak of unwrapping a meticulously-wrapped easter hamper? Nahoums,a buzzing, glass walled island of brownies, tarts and fruit cakes in Kolkata’s iconic New Market, is a storehouse of many such feelings. The decor is bare minimum, in fact Nahoums is the sort of place where you are expected to wold down your lemon tart standing while the helpers pack your box of savouries. Aluminium trays full of fershly-made goodies are displayed on the shop window and you are expected to choose your pastry without the help of a menu and in met cases, name tags. The almond pastry looks puzzlingly similar to the cheese cake, but regulars aren't complaining. They swoop down, gobble up and leave with quaint white boxes full of Nahoum staples like brownies and rich fruit cakes.

One of the oldest bakery in the city and also one of my all time favorites. Great cakes and pastries with an unique taste. This is one of the places I visit every time I go to New Market. The shop is quite old but I really like the ambiance of it. The Queen's cake is something which I would personally suggest everyone to try. Its a simple heart shaped cake without any cream or icing but its really delicious and has got a nice fragrance to it. Every year at least one of my family members would get their birthday cake from here. The birthday cakes are excellent and they pack them really nicely with care so that you can carry them a long distance without worrying about getting it damaged on the way home.

My visit to the iconic SS Hogg Market isn't complete unless I peek into nahoum bakery. Although, the enterprise has lost its shine n glamour to a large extent, one is inevitably drawn to it due to the gastronomical memories attached to this place. In its hay days, the smell of freshly baked goods would waft through the alleys of New market, now it's just of  lingering melancholy n decadence.
Nahoum springs to life during Christmas n New year's,and is a favourite for patrons like me, since I love their ginger bread, cookies, rum balls, plum cakes,and lemon tarts.
I do hope that it finds its footing. New market is no fun when the nahoum shutter are down.

You can never go to new market but not go to Nahoum's! If you disagree, please visit Nahoum's when you are at new market the next time... and the trend will continue!

Nahoum's will hopefully never lose its old world charm along with those lovely bakery items.  The moment you enter their quaint and under illuminated shop in new market, the aroma hits your nostrils.  You can NEVER MISS the freshness of their items.

Mostly, it is their brownies, cookies, pan cakes and patties that hog the limelight.  And i have NEVER had to complain thus far.  While the aroma fills your senses, the delicious cookies and pastries will fill your belly before you know!!

The best thing about nahoum's is that they have not tried to modernize just to keep up with the latest fashion. Yet, the footf
all at their shop is still alive on any weekend.....just like any other modern eatery. They have maintained their USP - fresh and tasty bakeries and confectionery items...and that is all that i care about.

Nahoums is not a fancy and jazzy outlet...and it blends perfectly with new market and with that old calcutta charm!

If you are having a tiring day shopping, at new market this is the place to get an energy refill. Personally, being a chocolate person my favourite is the chocolate tart. Theres just something about the hint of orange in it that makes it soo yummy. The almond tart is definitely a must try. I'd recommend the rum ball and swiss roll too. Didnt like the savoury much however. Their famous plum cake is good too but be warned.. the line for that spirals upto to the entrance of new market during christmas time.

Ah Nahoum's. Deep in the heart of new market, this place has become a must every time I go to Esplanade. 
Just opposite Little Shop, the store welcomes you, urges you to try the delectables. 
The lemon puff and lemon tarts are impeccable. Slightly tangy yet sweet. Rum balls are yet another jewel in the nahoum's. Chocolate fudge is another thing to try. 
The staff are extremely nice. After a long day of shopping, you just want to keep on stuffing yourself with sweets all day long.

This age old bakery shop is located inside Hogg Saheb er bazaar popularly known as New Market! They are famous for their deliciously baked fresh muffins, they have them in different shapes too! During Christmas time their fruits cakes are something which everyone should try out. As the winter sets in, it's difficult to even enter this place, it's crowded like anything, people travel from different places from all over the town and even outside just to try them out! The pastries are literally sold like hot pancakes and there's not even a place to stand properly, lot of chaos lot of pushing and shoving! But it's fun to finally have super delicious goodies! It has become more of a tradition year after year since my childhood to have their freshly baked rum cakes every new year. It's an age old gem and Kolkata is lucky to have such a fine confectionary!

I have been eating Nahoum Cakes since my childhood days, and its been a tradition to have their fruit and plum cakes every Christmas.. But sadly, I don't find their other preparations to be quite as good nowadays, and with so many other options available today, we don't opt for Nahoum..Their famous lemon tart is average, there is nothing special about it, and so is their Rum Ball. Was thoroughly disappointed the other day when I had two of their most famous dishes and found them to be over-hyped.
The ones which I did like were their Jelly Tarts, their cakes and brownies. They make the best chocolate brownies and fudges I have ever tasted and that is the only thing for which I go back there.

Bakery which will remind you of your mother's kitchen . The succulent rum balls , the strawberry cubes and the pies are awesome . The vintage chicken / mutton patty , the cheese puffs , the quiche will make your taste buds secrete the gastronomic juices . I tasted the garlic bread which is probably the best with the dollops of butter melting along with pepper and Garlic in your mouth with each bite is divine ...... The spring onion crackers and cheese sticks can just be okay but they are good to be considered as stand by players ...........

Nahoum's as we all have heard of it is one of the most renowned bakeries in town. I think it was good once, during the early days of it. But now, I don't find anything special in it. Yes, they have a variety in their confectionery items but the quality they serve is almost equal to any local bakery. I have tried their fresh pineapple slices, black forest cake, macaroons and cookies. They are nothing extraordinary. These days, Kolkata is experiencing an exotic journey of new bakeries with very good quality of confection and needs no criticism. I think this might be the reason for me why Nahoum has fallen back in the race in my eyes, probably in the reality. Thank you.

My personal favorite would always be the Chocolate Eclairs cake. Rich and stuffed, this cake brings ultimate foodgasm. As for the other stuff, each and every one of them is a gem.

New Market has lost most of its charm for shopping in the eake of thd hawkers menace but we go back there ptimarily to buy stuff from Nahoum's. I do not want to say much about ghe cakes and pastries, the bisvuits and breads or the patties and crackers. I am heavily biased, not only for nostalgic value but also fir the sheer retention of quality, taste and affordability that Nshoum's has maintained for generations.

Situated within Sir Stuart Hogg Market, serving good quality bakery items since 1902. Cant compare its past and present but old charm is still there and its one of a kind in kolkata. 

Theres no sitting arrangements, its a take away shop with old israel decor. 

I have tried few of their items but not all. Out of those, i love their brownie, which is a perfect one.

Must visit, specially during christmas for their cakes.

Most people will argue that it is a over rated iconic shop now. But i will say you will get exactly what you paid for.

A must try if you are a pastry lover....

Nahoum&Sons.. few places are still left in Calcutta that maintains that vintage link with 60s 70s wala Calcutta and Nahoum and Sons are one of them.. Being a newcomer to Calcutta I heard many things about this place.. So in 2014 when I was old enough to have a little bit of cash with me I visited this place.. The moment u enter, the smells of all the goodies wafts around u.. The interiors was exactly as I imagined.. The family that runs that place are very friendly and makes u feel like u know them since long! I took two loafs of bread, one gooseberry Jam, Chocolate cake and the Lemon tarts.. And as expected!!! These were one of the best cakes and tarts I had ever tasted.. U could literally taste the honesty and love with which it is made.. Reason enough to keep bringing me here again and again

A wonderful place, I still feel (and behave) like a kid in a candy store every time I enter this shop. Old world ambience. Amazing rich fruit cakes and plum cakes... definitely the best in town, far better and much cheaper than the stuff sold by Kookie Jar, Flurys, Cakes and the like....and the cinnamon buns and the rum balls and, of course, the brownies, which are one of a kind. I must say, Nahoum is not just a dessert shop, its an experience.

Over-rated in my opinion. At least from what I have seen. Some of the items are still good, but sentimental value is to be found in greater amounts than quality when one sees people crowding the place. I really liked their brownie though and my friend is almost crazy about it. But even she did not dare to taste the gooey-looking pastries on display.

Nahoum's started in 1902 by Nahoum Israel and stands tall with all its glory at Sir Stuart Hogg Market. I believe the shop epitomises the old world charm like no other place in Kolkata. The archaic dark wooden cabinets and marble tops can surely bring you back to the days of yore. A visit to New market, even today, is incomplete without a quick stop at Nahoum's.  Rarely when I don't get time to pick up goodies, I make sure to just go past this shop, just to catch a glimpse and get the rich aroma. Such is the beauty of this Culinary Institution. 

Ambience: Needless to say I adore the historic setting. 

Food: I have tried a range of there products throught my life but there are somethings that you cannot miss if you are here for the first time.

Rum Ball: Perfect rum soaked balls of heaven on earth. The best rum ball that I've tasted so far. 

Brownie: Very soft with perfect sweetness and I love it warm with vanilla ice cream, if I save some for home.

Rich Fruit Cake: The massive queue just before christmas is a living example of how  LEGENDARY the product is. Hats off for maintaining the quality of the cake, truest to the original, even after more than a century, that can be easily vouched by many senior connoisseurs. I love it. 

Price: Its not at all heavy on pocket, as I consider institutions like these, in any city around the globe, as serving priceless piece of art worth cherishing for life.

A heritage bakery. Over rated. The idea of such an old bakery which is still active is the main attraction I think and its quite fun to be at Nahoum, always bustling. However the food is absolutely below average. Stick to the basics like plain butter cake or may be a plum cake if you really want to try something. Visit to experience Nahoum, the bakery but not the items.

Christmas in kolkata without a Nahoum's Rich Plum cake is an impossible event in my life. I have been going to this place since he time of Digama. The jam rolls and brownies were very sought after during my growing years. Sadly they have stopped making the jam rolls. Still come every December, I cannot help but gorge on their rich plum cake.

There are very few true blue Kolkatans who has not tasted delicacies from Nahoum's..  Nahoum's is a must stop whenever I have visited New Market.. Its pastries have an altogether different feeling.. The taste, the smell is entirely unique to them and cannot be found in any of the newer bakeries that have come in the city.... If you are in Kolkata you have to  taste the goodies from the Nahoum's... My Personal Favorite the Swiss rolls... :)

Nahoms remains one of the iconic outlets of Cal. Its been around since.....Ever it seems.You cant visit new market and not stop over for some delectable Black Forest , Fruit cake or a really gooooey eclair.The flakey patties and soft fresh pastries,eclair rolls,and not to miss the yummy Green mints.Christmas time is when you just have to go and pickup some fruit cakes,plum pudding,mince pies patties,tarts and take them home for the family--its the done thing. Nahom takes you back to yesteryears--its aura and very aroma is different unlike the fancy new joints comeup in town.Strong advice--dont miss out on tasting the goodies at Nahoms.

I went there after reading reviews on zomato. Having a sweet tooth I really wanted to visit this place. Situated inside new market,  parking is a big problem. However, I managed to park the car at a distant just to try this out. It wasn't a disappointment. You'll like it if you want to try traditional bakery stuff. I liked the brownie and black forest. I got some for my family but nobody liked it. You'll like it if you like the kind of pastries available in flurrys!

Nahaum name is enough. I don't think anyone who has lived here in Calcutta have never heard of the name or ever ate here. I have been coming here since I don't know when. As a child the brownies n cakes of nahoum were my absolute favourites. The place has not changed at all from the decor to the shop but one thing thankfully that has not Changed is the amazing taste. I simply love nahoum at Christmas and when im away from home during Christmas nahoums plum cakes is what I miss the most.

This is one of the legendary places in Kolkata which is situated in the heart of the bustling New Market. It reeks of old world charm with some amazing bakery items, breads and pasteries that is set in a very old fashioned decor. We have been visiting this place ever since I can recall and my most favourite is the Cheese Straws that we would buy in huge quantities and take it in my school tiffin. Even now, whenever I am visiting New Market, I always get drawn to this place and end up buying something or the other to take back home. Its that nostalgia which keeps me coming back to this place over and over again. I highly recommend this place to everyone ...

It is truly legendary as this is supposed to be the place that entire Calcutta was looking forward to, each Christmas. That was, of course, 1950. 

Come 2015, Nahoums struggles for existence. Located in the same place at New Market, I wonder why they never considered moving out or creating outlets. New Market has long given away the most-visited-place position to either City Centre or South City. 

The usual picks here are the Christmas Cakes right before the Christmas date. You find cookies too, but nothing really catches the same craziness for a Nahoum' cake today.

Since I wasn't quite hungry..nd didn't carry much loose cash on me,I settled for the chocolate black forest..which was superb..and was only 30bucks..the negative point is that cards are not accepted..!!

Wanted to try this place for long. Finally went to this legendary place yesterday with a friend. The variety of items gave us a hard time choosing from them as each one of them looked really delicious and we wanted to try everything on the chart. But as ours was a post-lunch venture, we were already full and only managed to order Chocolate Eclairs and Chocolate Pastry. And yes I must say, we loved the taste and quality of what they serve from the very first bite. 
The interior is very simple without any unnecessary bit of decoration. Apparently, you won't get a break to notice those details as those mouth-watering delicacies will not allow you to move your eyes to anywhere else.
I found this place to be a tiiiiiiiny(very, very little) bit costly at first, but it was justified by the quality of what we got.

Before I start my review I would like to quote Isaac Nahoum, the brother of David Elias Nahoum boasting confidently to a lady at the counter who was confused of so many varieties available,
"My dear, they say this is the best cake shop in the city, pick whatever your heart says, you won't get disappointed."

That's Nahoum and Sons for you! After David passed away on March 2013, the family said that the legend will live on. His brother Isaac is carrying on the mantle.

For more than a century, Kolkata's Christmas has remained incomplete without Nahoum's crunchy brownies, delectable cheese muffins and delicious pastries. For thousands of their fans, Christmas is incomplete without their plum cakes and rich fruit cakes. Located right in the heart of New Market, it has been one of the most famous confectioneries of the region for half-a-century. A visit to New Market is by default a visit to Nahoums; this has been the routine for as long as I can remember. Their cakes and savouries retained their quality through the years. Though a bit pricey, but David and Isaac ensured that the Nahoum's brand was never tarnished.

This is a place full of nostalgia. Very busy during festive times. Very very reasonable cost of items. Excellent cakes, chicken and mutton pastries, puff pastries,  cream rolls, different tarts, éclairs, plum cake and many many more. Always has a standard taste. Ever dependable though not mind blowing . A bit dark and congested old school  arrangement inside the big room. No seating options. The old guard along with some new staffs are polite and full of suggestions and friendliness. A rock and a landmark in Kolkata culinary scene since ages. A must eat place among bakeries. I have been going there from 1982 with my father and mother- now almost  33 yrs and I am always happy. Highly recommended.

Probably the best time to go is right now ie the festive holiday season. My mother frequented this place in her childhood, but I have been here only a few times. They still have that old school goodness about them without compromising on price or quality. Just a tad too traditional maybe for today's desserts crowd.

There isnt a thing that hasnt been said about Nahoums and I wnt be the last one to say good things about it. Visiting Nahoums and savouring the goodies is like biting into a slice of history. I have had fruit and plum cakes from Nahoums since I can remember. 
After ages, I got to visit this historic bakery before Christmas this year to pick.up the lovely fruit cake. However, the lady(possibly one of the owners, since its a family run business) suggested that I opt for the special Christmas cake which is baked only during this time of the year. Its priced economically at INR 375 Ffor 400gms, much cheaper than tge offerings from most elite bakeries. It was awesome. My family finished it off before Christmas itself and I had to get a replacement for Christmas. 
I also had chicken patties, mince pie and lemon puff. The chicken patties was good. The lemon puff at INR 35 is one of the best in town. The showstealer however, was the mince pie. Its different from most other pies available with a generous dose of raisins, currants, nuts, etc. I believe they prepare these goodies till the year end and Im surely going again to gorge on the mince pie.

The shop is associated with the childhood memories of all the calcuttans.
May be the shop has not changed its look since ages, but that is the usp of the shop. you become a child when you enter.Rich plum cake and chicken patties are the best items along with rich fruit cake and lemon tarts.
The best part is the service.

Should visit this shop once. Antique. 

Run by a group of Jewish people (no racial attack intended) this antique shop in New Market gives the perfect essence of baked food. The main personae behind this shop are David, Norman and Solomon Nahoum. Nahoum's specialises in boulangerie and patisserie. With a history that dates back to a time very old, Nahoum's has been providing quality food. My mother and aunt has grown up tasting its products and so have I. Favourite ones are Chicken Patty, Chocolate Brownie, Lemon sponge, and Cheese cake. But I liked the taste more when I was small. About fifteen to twenty years back or even before that, a birthday cake from Nahoum's would be a huge thing.

A recent visit to this good ol' and oh-so-popular bakery was a bit of a dissatisfaction. The cakes no doubt as nice as ever. I specially loved the 'heart cake' but I tried one pineapple pastry which was not at all up-to the mark. Now coming to the patties, the chicken patties tastes and smells strange and totally not chicken-like and they put egg in vegetable patties!!!! Nahoum was frequented by my parents whom I accompanied as a child when we resided in Sealdah and now after so many years I had gone there with very high hopes, but returned with a bit of a disappointment.

Just in time for Christmas to write a review for them. :)
But this legendary pastry shop needs no review. They have curved out a name for themselves over decades. My first memory of Nahoum's is from my grand father who bought their very famous fruit cake for me every Christmas. 

The first time I went there was with friends though. After a never ending shopping exploration in New Market, we finally found this old-world charm of a pastry shop tucked inside Sir Stuart Hogg Market. Right from the moment we entered, it was love at first sight. The smell of fresh made bread and cookies. The goodies waiting on the glass shelf just waiting to be picked up by the hundreds of people gathered inside the shop. 

We decided for chocolate brownie , lemon tart and rumball. The lemon tart was vibrant with a perfect balance. The crust was soft and melted right away in your mouth. The rumball was decent. But, the winner was the chocolate brownie . It can still beat the choc brownies from all the famous cafes and delis mushroomed in every corner of the city. 

Christmas feels incomplete without their fruit cake or their rich plum cake. And, most importantly,  it reminds me of my grand father holding their cake and singing 'Merry Christmas' for me. :)

Over a period of time, the place has deteriorated. Also with so many competitors around the city they should work hard to bring back the standards and restore the glory of the place,as its famous not only in Kolkata,but across India.
The pastries are OK. Brownies are good. Lemon tarts are nice. Though none of the stuffs are best in the city.
Price is reasonable.

OK first of all my review is based on just two items. Strawberry cake and cheesebun. Strawberry cake was aweful!!! Those typical dalda/vanaspati cream cakes we used to get those days at cheap bakeries at our very own gullies was what I was reminded of, yes my childhood!!! I would in fact give a 2.5 but the lovely perfect texture and yummy taste of the cheesebuns put up the score by 0.5!! Sorry folks! I find a lot of u all getting reminded of childhood, nostalgia n blah blah but my take is that Cakes or kookie jar are way better for a couple more bucks extra...at least u re not downing a dollop of vanaspati!
Ah yes! M adding some more of my comments regarding this sprung onion cookies/crisps. On the first day it did taste premium... Yet I insisted to my husband that this too had vegetable shortening/vanaspati aka dalda when he said there was no way nahoum would have such an unhealthy n dangerous ingredient. A couple days later I was proven right. The cookies started tasting dalda...with a thick white layer forming a layer/film on the insides of your upper jaws after just a bite!!!
Ewwww!
A bakery of such history could afford to use butter n bake! Anyway its us who pay for it... Why not give us healthier stuff ??!

This place was the only reason for me too beg my parent's to take me along with them for visits to new market.  Quietly undergo the torturous boredom of shopping and pushing crowd.  Because after the crowd and incessant shops for seemingly unending purchases, when I walled into the ancient and time ravaged establishment of nahoum's I knew that this was my reward for all the trials.  Soft and mouth watering patty's and pastries erased your exhaustion and boredom and put your mind at peace for another round of shopping spree.

Nahoum and Sons, sounds like childhood to me. My mother would always visit New Market for whatever reason and would bribe me and my sister to accompany her by promising us to visit this legendary Jewish bakery. It was that magical part of New Market that did not smell like meat or hair. Everything from the pastries to the Easter egg is wonderful, but the ones i distinctly remember lovinggg and still crave for were the chocolate and vanilla fudges, the brownie and the mint sweets. AMAZING. I haven't been able to find any fudge anywhere in the country that delicious. Im dying to visit Calcutta again, with only one intention - Nahoums.

I was introduced to this place by my mother, and since childhood i visit this place regularly. As a matter of fact my mom was first acquianted to this treasure by my grandfather when she was in school. So savouring their delights is a tradition to us. This place holds a very special emotional integrity in my heart. Christmas doesn't feels like christmas at all if we don't get to smell the aroma of nahoum's rich plum cake. Though this place is not at all visually attractive but it has got something which always keeps bringing you back. If by any reason i go nearby new market area i never fail to drop by to nahoum to grab their legendary "fish pantry"  "brownies" and "jam tarts". Though this place is over a century old which was founded by a Jewish person named Nahoum Israel from Baghdad and after his demise the reign was taken over by his son Elias and then David. I have got my personal experience of eating from here for more than 15 years and till date it always stood up to my expectations. They never compromised with the quality of their offerings and perhaps that is the reason why inspite of sticking to their vintage layout and interiors it never failed to satisfy anyone's desire. Those who had never been here please do drop by incan assure you one thing that you will keep coming back Nahoum is not just a name of confectioner but an integral part of kolkata's culture. Nahoum is a century old legacy.
It never comprimised in satisfying our palletes for ages. Nahoum is synonym to pride and nostalgia. 
#good lord writing this review just fostered my temptation to indulge into the mesmerising paradox of their brownies... Hell yeah i am grabbing a couple or two tomorrow for sure...

During all my visits to the ever favourite New Market, I have always made it a point to step into this visually unassuming shop, with subtle colonial features and the aroma of fresh baked cakes and brownies. Old people selling great stuff, with a homely feel and of course cheaper than all those fancy cafes. You save a few hundred bucks by compromising on secondary features like ambience and air conditioning, but you gain a permanent liking for original bakery tidbits. The chocolate brownies are a fast seller and they rock!

however all my praise bears the PAST tense tag with it bcz in recent times there has bn some deterioration in their quality...the charm is somewhat missing...hope this is a temporary one and the original Nahoum will return in no time to revive my childhood fantasy...

My mother always brought these sweet treats anf made our days so wonderful. One day, about 5 - 6 yrs ago, I tried their Black Forest cake, I couldn't resist and bought all the cakes that day. The best Black Forest I have ever had. Even though I rated 5 ( I wish I could rate you more), but you are a part of my beautiful memories..... so you are beyond any rating!!!

Once my favourite confectionary in the city.  Now however the quality is going down. Nahoum isn't cheap but that was never an issue because of the fantastic quality and taste of its cakes. My last few visits to the place have disappointed me as the quality and taste is gone.

Well its a tradition in many families to have Nahoum's cake on x'mas...one of the best fruit cake you can find in Kolkata...a bit overpriced but once you have it you will come to know why they charge a premium...
The O/L is very old and you get a nostalgic feeling of yesteryears when you enter it...

No X'Mas is complete without Nahoum's cake

Still basking in past glory!
I remeber this quaint lil shop tucked away in one corner of Old New Market from my early years, we used to go Pujo shopping and at the end tired exhausted we used to binge on those big choclaty 'rum balls'! What luxury!
Recently had a chance to go back again and all i saw was a dark dingy shop, those rum balls intact but i felt a tad stale, the 'black forest' not the same...with the cookie jars and cakes of the world i feel Nahoum's has been pushed aside as a mere HERITAGE! 
Time they should have a come back, not a good feeling to see my happy childhood memories disappear.

NAHOUM brings back nostalgia & special childhood memories. My memories of New Market is associated with this place. Dad would brings goodies from here while returning from his office when I was a kid. The pastries, biscuits, cookies, cakes & patties were incredible. Its the heart of New Market.

My favourites include the famous Rum-ball pastry cake, strawberry cake, chocolate cake and Chicken patties. Pineapple pastry  and Tarts are also good. 
There's good variety of cakes and pastries here.

Christmas time is the best here 'coz the variety of cakes and pastries increase and the crowd is too large to control then. 
But now I feel that the quality of food has degraded a lot. The butter in the pastries sticks to your teeth/tongue after eating. It seems that its Dalda. That's why I prefer eating the patties now, they give a large amount of tasty fish/chicken inside the patty.
A must visit for all people & kids out there. Bon Apetite!

Have been here a couple of times, with my mother. Pastries are too sugary and dreadfully dry. Not the jolliest of shop owners also. Nostalgia seems to be its sole bargaining chip, and yet, that is what keeps it from evolving to 21st century standards....needless to say, the dark and damp interior doesn't make things easier.

After a decade I was there at Nahum's. Why I say it as a decade is, I knew the name Nahum when my Grand father used to take me to the new market to buy a loaf at Nahum and it used to be on wednesday evening. And I loved that loaf more than anything in this world. It was almost 25 years back. And one fine day when I was there at the new market with my son I holded his hands and went to the Nahums. The place remains the same, the furnitures remain the same, the only thing which had changed are the people over the years. I asked for a french loaf to the person at the counter and the person replied " Sir kitney dino baad aa rahey ho?". I replied after 25 years, and he started smiling and said sir there is a lot which has changed over these years. They do not offer that special french loaf. So I decided to go with some brownies, some pastries and my favourite plum cake.

The pastries were OK, the plum cake was really rich and nice, both me and my son enjoyed a bit of all. Will miss out the special french loaf.

Did I miss something? Been there a couple of times. The freshly baked cake smelling of butter was good. But rest of the stuff - brownies, patties, tarts/pastries are quite ordinary. Being legendary, carrying loads of nostalgia etc. is all fine but a bakery (or for that matter any eatery) should be rated by the quality of the stuff they sell. I love simple yet delicious food but this bakery seems to have lost the script. I'm disappointed and won't be queuing up during Christmas for sure.

I simply visit this place for their Brownie's. And most of the time I have my sister bringing me two of these delicious packets to light up my mood. And guess what I have one of them lying beside me while I am writing this review. You spend 30 bucks (as of now) and end up thinking the calories are totally worth it. Well I guess I had the luck to taste their fruit cakes few times but not during the Christmas holidays. There is a huge queue during the winter holidays and honestly I never liked the idea of waiting in a queue to get my food served. Oh and by the way I always hated Rum balls, because of a very bad incident, but that day when my sister bought one, it was pretty good, flavour of orange peels seemed rather prominent but in a good way. But the place is rather stuffy, located in the old new market and that is another reason why I like to take away my brownies.

This has always been my favourite and I swear by their jam tarts and lemon tarts. But last time I just had two lemon tarts and as I did not have change I gave a 500 rupees note. The lady at the cash counter BEHAVED extremely rude with me. This kind of behaviour will put off the most ardent of patrons.

Never in my life did I ever imagine kolkata's oldest bakery will be ranking amongst the newbie bakeries. The decor , the ambience is nil as compared to that of au bon pain , but the freshness and goodness still remains intact . What drives people to nahoum?? The sheer nostalgia and the softness of the bread and cake base. The chocolate , strawberry pastries I can die for. The base simply melts in the mouth. The chocolate truffles, I love. What I find phenomenal is the custard crème roll. Its highly recommended. U heat it up a beat in the microwave and you will have the best ever feeling of your life. The choco tarts and sweet tarts are great in taste. The sweet buns and the garlic breads is the best in town. The Christmas plum cakes are tasty and soft and supple. I love the plums. I want that to be available throughout the year. The cheese patties also tastes equally awesome. I actually do not know of any item at nahoum that doesnt taste great. Its mystical that such a great eatery exists at a shabby corner of hogg market.

I along with my friends went to shopping in new market and hit this old and famous bakery. It was such a nostalgic feeling. It reminded me of my childhood when i used to come with my parents holding their hands.. Whenever we visited new market, baba didn't forget ever to take me to this joint. Time has passed but this joint has remained the same as before. We ordered cheese roll, chocolate pastry and sweet tart. I loved them all as usual. The quality and taste were as great as before and made me realise nothing has changed.

NAHOUMS....
The name is synonymous to Christmas cakes at our place. Since decades, we religiously fetch a cake from Nahoums during Christmas.  The quality control is indeed appreciable. The same taste, same flavor, same smell.... so distinct..... so typical..... so perfect...... Cakes from Nahoum is something to die for.  Kudos to team Nahoum for baking cakes to die for. No CAKES or SUGAR n SPICE can beat you.
Highly Recommended

Since childhood every time I visited Sir Hogg's Market, visiting Nahoums was a regular fixture. Still relish their 'rum balls' and patties. They also make great cookies. You have to understand that this place is still there for a reason. A must visit if you want a taste of Kolkata. Do try out their rum balls and patties!!!

Yes, the oldest bakery in town. It's always a treat to the buds to have brownies from this place. And, luckily it is close to my college. And, I drop in now and then for brownies. Don't go after the decors, and you will surely not be disappointed with their desserts. However, am yet to try out the others things that they sell. I am sure, I would like it as much as I liked their brownies.

NAHOUM AND SONS, a place which has a lot of history associated with itself and its food. Located in the deep corners of Hare Market this place is a delight for people who love pastries and cookies. Though the place dose not look appealing in the first visit but once you become aware about the history of this place you will start enjoying the desserts much more. Have been to this place during Christmas when the whole of New Market is alive with shoppers and trust me that experience was worth remembering.

I have always seen people going on and on about this particular bakery. So when i was in new market i thought of trying this place out.
I am a lover of pastries and i like fresh cream on my pastries,nothing else and the pastries have to be soft. I took a pineapple pastry here and didn't get the above two. Hard cake and dalda cream !
I tried one chicken patties and was not impressed as well.
So all in all I did not find this to be a very  apealling place and also the people here have to be told a hundred times what you want !

I think this is the place where i learnt to eat various pastries and patties. Why only me??? Must be for any bengali my age when we did not have so many Bakery and Confectioneries across the roads. I remember going with my parents to New Market for shopping on one condition... that i want to eat at Nahoums :) The aroma of this place is bound to attract you once you are inside the complex. Best part of them is that the food quality has been consistent over so many decades. I love the rum ball cakes here and also the chicken patties and the chocolate pastries and the strawberry pastries and the pineapple... OMG the list will just go on and on :p If you are on a visit to the city please do visit here and make sure you pack a few items for your loved ones back home.

The variety of breads are a delight to bread lovers, the garlic bread being one of my favourites. The dry fruit cake is another tasty snack when accompanied with tea/coffee. Nahoum's still has the same antique decor. The chicken patties and pizza puff is a delight to your taste buds.

Every time I think of visiting a cake shop I first find out the brand value of that place.Maybe I'm a little fettish when it comes to brands but that's the way I go about it.
Next what I calculate is the availability of what I exactly want,simulatenously keeping the price value in mind.
If I had to calculate so many of these factors,my blood pressure would have shot up.
Nahoum's is one such place where I get all the things I want.It happens to be one of Calcutta's first and finest bakeries.
Located precisely in the city's Esplanade and forming an essential part of the Hogg Market, Nahoum's bakery is a must visit for every tourist who comes to Calcutta.
The antique smell still remains in every corner of the cake shop.
Generally if I'm hopping around this place I go for the chocolate pastries and Chicken patties for a quick grab. For the home I pick the Fruit Cakes which tastes really good when you have it with tea/coffee.
The Rich dry fruit cake is a speciality of this cake shop. But at times it tastes a little more sweet than the normal fruit cakes I have.
Fact is you get everything here everyday apart from the Christmas season. It's not that you won't get anything on Christmas, but the long queues will really spoil your mood for buying anything.
In Calcutta there are so many cake shops but believe me I never see serpentine queues outside any cake shop like Nahoum's.
Prices here are very reasonable and the bakery food is very fresh.
It is a real pleasure to see a cake shop maintaining its standards for ages.
And lastly...do dig in for the cream rolls of this place and the lemon tarts.I believe it will give you an unforgettable experience.
I'll leave it up to you to find out more interesting facts about this place,which I may not know.

As a budding baker, New Market is a heaven for all its reasonably priced baking tools and easy availability of ingredients that shops around the city (even the high-end ones) seem to have never heard of. But whether I am shopping for a carton of heavy cream or looking for faux leather goods, there is one stop I never fail to make whenever I am in the area- that is Nahoum and Sons.

My earliest memories of Nahoum's is that of really aromatic cakes in Christmas and delicious mince patties during shopping. I love their cakes, all of them, because they taste very homely to me. The plain cakes are really buttery and the slightly cracked tops remind me of my own cakes! I love their pastries and Swiss rolls and tarts as well. They are reasonably priced if you compare the taste and size with those you find at Monginis and Sugarr 'n' Spice and Kathleen. The lemon curd in tarts and puffs is simply divine and the chocolate glaze on Swiss rolls makes for a decadent taste in your mouth.

As for the savories, I am not usually a preacher of minced meat bakes, but if it tastes as good as Nahoum's, who needs chunky chicken? The minced meat patties and pies that are found in other bakeries taste like there is a lot of filler in the mince. Not Nahoum's though; it tastes very meaty, despite the crumbly, un-meatlike texture. I love fish panthras and can easily stuff myself full of them. 

Special mention: The egg chop is brilliant- I love the plain, baked potato filling with the half egg. It has a clean taste that I would take over the overly spicy fillings that are usually associated with this Bengali version of Scotch eggs.

One of the oldest cake shops in the country..the cakes are as good as you could possibly find anywhere in Kolkata, considering their prices. They seem to have kept the prices same over the years. Just that the shop has remained the same too, with the place badly in need of a makeover. Otherwise just love the food, especially the chocolate brownies.!!

Of what’s left of Jewish community of Kolkata, Nahum’s Bakery is one of them. It is famous for its plum cakes, cheese muffins and delicious pastries. 
It is situated in New Market, Victorian Gothic market and Calcutta’s first municipal market. No visit to this iconic market is complete without a visit to Nahum’s. The confectioneries are good though slightly expensive though resonable.

I feel nostalgic while giving this review.. All my past memories have been recalled. 

My Christmas always meant Nahoum and Sons fruit cake..it was a ritual for me. 
As a kid.. I use to beg my parents to take me over there.

My dad or mom use to bring home all that wonderful Puffs,cookies, pastries,patties.. Specially the lemon Puffs which was a wish come true for me always... Till now its a personal favourite in Nahoum and Sons list. 

The experience of taking home a cake that is still hot and taken out from the oven something that has not grown old with me. 
The Nahoum and Sons is the place for old bakery charms,with the glimpse of old Calcutta ( kolkata ).

I never miss to visit this place when I am around the New Market Area. Usually I pack my favourites and sometimes have the most tempting ones out in there ! I guess I am not eligible to criticize this bakery in any way, it is legendary , all I can do is only praise ! All the pieces I have tried has always been super fresh and delicious. Among the must tries include the lemon tart or lemon puff, because its the best lemon flavoured bake I have ever had with the perfect sweet and sour flavour, most of the time its all sold out :( but when luckily I manage to find them in the racks, I get them all ! :D. Other items that I loved were almond tart (although its a bit too sweet), black forest cakes etc. 

Few days back I got to try their Garlic Bread and I can loudly declare that IT IS the best garlic bread I could have had. Its simple the best blend of garlic, butter and pepper possible, way way better than all those commercialized garlic breads of pizza joints! and guess what the price is just Rs 60 for 1 pound ! ! ! :O

Try their biscuits, feels like homemade and gives a relief of freshness that packaged biscuits never have !

Their prices are average, its quite pocket friendly ! Making my experience all the more pleasurable.

The only not-so-good thing is, they remain closed during the christmas time mostly, I understand that its hard to meet the pressure of the demanding customers but I really wish that all of us could get an opportunity of try your cakes when its the right time of have them. But I admit whatsoever might be the occasion they never ever compromise their quality !

In a rainy day after moving here & there finally I found this place inside Hogg Market.
Yes, you guessed it right, it was my first visit. The shop isn't a modern day fancy shop at all. I heard a lot about their special brownies, so bought some brownies and brought it back to my home.
Ummmm....after tasting one of those brownies, I can certainly feel the inner peace. My hard effort on a rainy day when streets are full of dirty, muddy water hasn't gone in vain. It was a great success.
It's a legendary shop, you can feel the essence as soon as you enter the shop.
I am eagerly waiting to try their fruit cakes, fish pantras, pastries and lots of other products. Expectations are high. A must visit place...

A Visit to new market is incomplete without visiting this legendary place. If you are a first time visitor the place might not impress you. There is nothing fancy about this shop and has maintained its simplicity and food quality for four generations. The confectionaries gonna bowl you ova for sure.

For people its might be the lemon tart or fish pantras or pan cakes or chicken samosas or rum balls but for me the place is a must visit for the cheese puffs and brownies.

During Christmas it has wide range of cakes to offer.
No wonder it made its place on "legendary" on zomatao.

In a rainy day after moving here & there finally I found this place inside Hogg Market.
Yes, you guessed it right, it was my first visit. The shop isn't a modern day fancy shop at all. I heard a lot about their special brownies, so bought some brownies and brought it back to my home.
Ummmm....after tasting one of those brownies, I can certainly feel the inner peace. My hard effort on a rainy day when streets are full of dirty, muddy water hasn't gone in vain. It was a great success.
It's a legendary shop, you can feel the essence as soon as you enter the shop.
I am eagerly waiting to try their fruit cakes, fish pantras, pastries and lots of other products. Expectations are high. A must visit place...

This place is within the new market building and an old and very famous bakery in the area.
Visited this place today and tried their chocolate pastry, some cookies and pizza puff.
Food was too good to excite the buds and a cheap one too I will say.
Put this in your list if you are coming to Kolkata. :-D

A Visit to new market is incomplete without visiting this legendary place. If you are a first time visitor the place might not impress you. There is nothing fancy about this shop and has maintained its simplicity and food quality for four generations. The confectionaries gonna bowl you ova for sure.

For people its might be the lemon tart or fish pantras or pan cakes or chicken samosas or rum balls but for me the place is a must visit for the cheese puffs and brownies.

During Christmas it has wide range of cakes to offer.
No wonder it made its place on "legendary" on zomatao.

While I do not like their patties much, the fruit cakes and palm cakes are definitely steals the show. The place is almost always overcrowded but the quick service pretty much makes up for it. Being a legendary Kolkata bakery, Nahoums is a synonym for nostalgia to many. I am yet to try their Mutton Samosas which is a legendary item and yet rarely available.

On the many occassions i have tried to visit this shop, i have found it closed 4 out of 5. 
on the rare day i finally entered its doors, the sweet-tangy lemon pastry caught my attention and bowled over my heart.. 
kindly let me know when it is REALLY open as compared to the timings written above! As my office is really near to this shop and i like coming over now and then.. only to find its shutters down!

This place is a must-visit on my trip to the New Market. I am especially fond of their Jam Tarts, Lemon Puff, Rum Ball and Sweet Bun (served hot). However, their Chocolate Fudge was overly sweet. Make sure to carry back a bottle of their Gooseberry Jam. But the Orange Biscuits were hugely disappointing since there was nothing orange about it.

Nahoum's is almost synonymous with Kolkata. Cakes, pastries and savouries are their forte. Of course they have in a way lost ground to the newer places which are expensive, offer fancier looking items made with fancy ingredients. But it is really like comparing oranges and apples. Any Nahoum-lover will tell you that.

I am not one to really sing paeans over this outlet. It offers you basic, well made, good tasting stuff of a particular standard. Their brownies was what I had heard about them for, and I must say they are good. The patties, etc are fairly decent, and can hold their own. I used to be fond of their candies, the stick-jaws and the mint ones... a childhood phase no doubt.

To be fair there is a lot I have not had the fortune of trying... the mutton samosas for example.

Perhaps it lives on in its steep history, and may not have anything to cater to today's money-splashing, fancy-demanding youth, but those who can find solace and enjoyment from the simpler things will certainly find Nahoum's worth a visit.

A perfect place which defines the phrase that simplicity is the best policy . The decor and ambiance is not much to talk about . But the pastries and cakes wins our heart , our taste buds and our pockets . Reasonably priced with excellent quality specially the fruit cakes and brownies. They should consider opening a cafe which would be an instant hit..

Well this bakery is my favourite at a particular time of the year that is the christmas. Just cant keep my hands off their fruit cakes, plum cakes etc. You can have all,you can have many and you are going to love them. My next favourite is the garlic bread and to be frank I am not that of a great fan of their creamy pastry. If you are a first timer please do ask the locale for direction or you will keep going in rounds.

This is the bakery form where my first birthday cake was ordered, no wonder it occupies a special position in my life. Other than that, the unassuming bakery in the lanes of New Market might raise many eyebrows at first, doubting the quality of its products, but once your taste-buds have touched the Nahoum's recipes, you cannot deny that it is by far the best bakery in town. The puffs and chops, the pastries and brownies... my mouth starts watering even thinking of it, sitting 2000km away from home. If nothing, even the aroma from Nahoum as you pass by the shop will bring a smile to your face!

Sells a number of authentic bakery products which are very different from the usual Kathleen, Cakes, Monjinis, etc. Whenever i go New Market i bring home something or other from this place.. Its really good anf i bet you wnt be dissapoint by their products. So go ahead and try out sme of their stuffs. And their fruit cake is a special mention.

To start with, I don't have any childhood memories associated with Nahoum's. Being reared in the suburbs of South Kolkata and from a family which believes in the moto, "Eat for living and not for passion", I had very little scope to access the great old school eateries of Kolkata. However it was only yesterday when I was introduced to Nahoum's by one of my senior colleagues. Previously I have heard many a things about this place but when I first had the chance to test it myself, I must say that I was not disappointed at all. We had  Chicken Patties with walnut brownies. Being accustomed with the new school of patties, the old school patties did not attract me much ( I still think chunks of meat tastes better in a patties than minced meat). However the brownies were out of this world. The walnut was roasted just to the right extent, the crust of the brownie was a bit crisp (much to one's delight), but the inside was moist,soft and having just the right texture. It will not be an ovestatement if I say those were the best brownies that I have ever tasted. I also heard stories that these brownies are exclusively shipped to Sachin Tendulkar's house, which seemed not at all astonishing to me. I wonder if this is the deteriorated quality (like people say), then what could have been the real quality. 
I am planning to visit the place again soon and to taste each and every item they produce. 4 stars from me.

If are in town, want to indulge in tasting some cake, not the creamy pastry, but some classic Christmas style cake, this is the best place to get it. I have been to many shops in the city for cakes. But nothing beats the taste of the Rich Dry Fruit Cake or even simple fruit cake. The aroma of rum to your nose, butter in your finger and taste in your mouth.. trust me it is one of the most awesome experience.

The cake shop is very old and have been on my wishlist when ever I am in town. I don't give it a miss. And prices are very very reasonable compare to the quality they offer.

I won't recommend anything special for the pastries, not because they are not good. They are pretty good actually. But not exceptional that you can't get at any pastry shop. But the cake is simply something which is the best in the city.

So next time you are in town, make sure to visit the place and do some favor to your sweet tooth. If you are conscious about your diet, give your diet plan a miss for a day. Trust me, its that good. :)

Nahoum and Sons - Surely one of the best bakery joints in the city which provide perhaps the best brownies... 

Location - Placed at the end corners of Hogg Market .. Built a century ago , this place is quiet famous in that area and anybody would guide you through the narrow lanes of Hogg market...
A visit to new market area remains incomplete without the walnut brownies or the  mutton samosas at Nahoums. Accordingly i visited this place quiet a few number of times and had tasted some their fast food items as well as their baked pastries.. 

Staff - The place remains crowded mostly in the evening ..But the staffs still manages to help their customers in describing briefly about the various bakery items which even include crunchy biscuits..

Food - Some of the well recommended items are mutton samosas,chicken patties , fish pantheras ,chicken puff and almost all the pastries... And yeah obviously the walnut brownies... If u like to buy biscuits , go for the sweet ones viz. van-chok , orange-flavoured   and try to avoid the salty ones (like cheese crackers)because those are too salty...
Overall, a nice place to have snacks at a very affordable cost..
  
Pocket Pinch : Rs 200 for two (approx)..

Nahoum's needs no introduction. 

Located inside New Market, the bakery has successfully maintained the quaintness typical to old establishments. No garish lights, pompous display or decor like the newly sprung up establishments. Still they are able to maintain their loyal clientele. There has absolutely been no compromise to the quality.

One can step in for a helping of the best plum cakes and brownies in town. Lemon tarts too count among my personal favourites! I recommend brownies and plum cakes!

For more than a century, a visit to Kolkata has remained incomplete without the crunchy brownies, delectable cheese muffins and delicious pastries at Nahoum's at New Market. Christmas isn't complete without their plum cakes and rich fruit cakes. Nahoum's has been one of the most famous confectioneries of the region for half-a-century. 
Nahoum's was set up in 1902 by Nahoum Israel, a Jew who had come to Kolkata from Baghdad. Within a decade, it had turned into the city's most famous confectionary, famous with the British. 

Location - Even a blind man in New Market knows its location. 

Brief - Paid a visit to the Nahoum's today after a long time :D

Ambience - The same old Nahoum's ambience.

Things Ordered - I packed a few items. The servers were very helpful and cooperative and helped me click pics as well :D
I packed up chicken patties,brownies,cheese cupcakes(This one on my friend TB's suggestion). Unfortunately the chicken sandwich and samosas were not available :(

I reached home and almost burst on the food. Each of them tasted special. The patties were awesome, The brownies just wow and the Cheese Cupcakes were the best :D

Purse Check - The total bill was Rs.280/- !! Amazing :D

Overall - My experience was Insane. Superb food+superb pricing+nostalgia=Mindblown :P
Specially recommended :P

Brownie, brownie and more brownie's....the best brownies in town! Whenever someone goes to New Market, my standard instructions get me some brownie. They are not soft, cottony but a mix of hard and soft-with oodles of walnuts inside that make the chocolatey seem chocolatier... The same taste has been maintained since my Dadu's time and through out all generations we adore this! However if the chocolate gets you guilty have their very low cal, water biscuits which taste so subtle and nice that you wonder if its low cal at all or not, but it is. Their cheese samosa or cheese puff are delicacies...the spungy cheese is nothing you get here.  Other stuffs normal, old school, stuff i rather not eat but none the less, they are superb,

This is my first entry in Zomato with a perfect 5. And people who have been to Nahoum's, need no explanation for the same. It has been the most trusted, most famous and the unmatched bakeries of Kolkata. Foodies, including me, travel from various part of the cities to pick up cakes and brownies from Nahoum's.

Starting from the Plum cake, to the walnut brownies, to the patty and the biscuits; they have made us a fan of everything they have brought to us. Being in New market with its old world charm, Nahoum's is a cult bakery; which has been satisfying generations now. And the freshness of the products cannot be questioned, so is the price. It's too good to be true!!!

Enough said... just be here to taste a bit of heaven...

You just can't afford to miss it!!!

The other name for Nahoum's is nostalgia. Whenever I step in to this place I can feel myself being transported to my childhood when my brother and I would stand in the middle of the shop and wonder what we should ask our parents to buy for us. Even till this day I wonder what I should buy and keep looking around for a few minutes. A lot of people have said that it is no more that good and the quality of their cakes, pastries and other sweet treats have deteriorated over the years. I agree with them all. But is it not the phenomenon everywhere! Nahoum and Sons is no more as good as it used to be in its hay days or even during my childhood but it still can give newer places like Kookie Jar and Cakes and French Loaf a run for their money. How you may ask? Here is how.
I used to love their marzipans. I still do. One word to describe them would be amazing. They come in various shapes, sizes and colours, resembling vegetables and fruits. There are two variations as far as the marzipans are concerned. One is plain and the other is with walnuts. My next favourtie is the macaroon tart, with the sweet cherry perched atop it. It tastes as good as it looks. Then there is the small muffin wrapped in a savoury pastry with sugar sprinkled on top the name of which I fail to recall now. There are a few biscuits and cookies I absolutely love from here. Th rum ball is decent and not one of my favourites. Don't miss the fruitcake here. It is perhaps a bit too sweet but it has the ideal moistness and tastes simply wonderful with all the sugary and crunchy fruity bits. But in my opinion the rich plum cake takes the cake (pun intended).  Over the last few years it has become a bit more greasier but despite that it is one of the best available in town. The shop in itself is a bit run down and decrepit but don't let that deceive you. Not all the items are good but that is the story almost everywhere. This place should be declared a heritage site. Don't miss it.

Now coming to the true point...we took a lemon puff which was great.the filling was yummy and the coating of cake was soft and touching..we took another cake with rich(really very rich) cream....which was also good but killed our appetite..the store is pocket-friendly..much cheaper than other known shops..i dint take any non veg ..maybe i vl go for it someday...recommended-mutton samosha,lemon puff,cheese samosa....and after all...100 shopping malls cannot replace new market...going to nahoums means resurrecting the memories and pride(still exists)of new market

I had been to Nahoum and sons with one of my friend yesterday as we were discovering the eateries in new market. Believe me when i first saw this place for the first time i had a very nostalgic feeling that i had been here before also. Its located inside the Stuart Hogg market which is popularly known as new market now. They had a lot of pastries, cakes, puffs and patties to serve the people at very reasonable prices. 

When i went there first time, i was like such an old place and such a huge crowd ? what is it? Then i suddenly discovered that its NAHOUM AND SONS which is one of the best Cake shops in New market. 

I had ordered Chicken puff which costed me 20 bucks to taste and believe me it was different, old style and yumm. When i had the first byte i could feel like i am tasting something which is carried out from the old times. However, later i remember my dad used to get the very famous fruit cake from there. And believe me this place is a MUST VISIT. Some people may have an hygiene issue but its a good place to grab a byte. 

My friend even said me that the black forest cake out here is damn good.  :)

Old is gold goes the saying.How very true when i found out on a recent visit just before Christmas.The shop resembled a refugee relief camp :)The long que of cake buyers was chaotic,ill-disciplined as is the norm in Kolkata. I mean people fighting amongst themselves, asking inane questions to the staff and haggling over prices- yes you read it right. Since standing in a que for food of any kind is not my thing i made a move to come back later. Thankfully it was relatively empty later and i managed to buy my staple quota of plum cake and the rich fruit cake. They were priced at Rs 250 and Rs 375 respectively.Very reasonable when compared to star/snobbish bakeries.The quality was awesome to say the least.The rich variant was moist and full of dry fruits,nuts,raisins and had the aroma of rum and wine in it. Trust me folks this is undoubtedly as good as it gets. Nahoums has been the numero uno bakery in Kolkata for more than a century and still going strong.I intend to sample the savouries and pastries on offer in my next visit.
This patisserie has been rendering great service for the cake lovers of Calcutta for more than a century now. Situated at the  no brainer location of  Sir Stuart Hogg market( popularly known as New Market) in the heart of the city, this joint surely touches the heart of all foodies.Though its  Jewish owner David Nahoum  passed away couple of months back, the show goes on as it should be. I must admit that i have no childhood memories of this joint as i have spent most of my life outside Bengal. But i have had the pleasure of tasting most of the items on offer. Items like the rich fruit cake-rich indeed with plentiful soaked raisins and dry fruits, walnut marzipan candy- age old favourite, mutton samosas-if you are really lucky and an early bird, puffs,brownies and lemon tarts. The specialty of this joint is that most of the baked items are prepared the traditional way- hand made that is with lots of love , care and affection. 
Decor, ambiance etc - please do not bother.Hop in , take your pick of items and soak in the pleasure of savouring the best of confectionery in Calcutta.They prefer to keep the cake-shopping experience uncomplicated and simple- i like it.
Though i must admit that several new bakery chains have marched forward with modern techniques of baking, bigger spread of items, bigger space and better ambiance.But as they say old is gold.This joint still holds its own.

To be honest, unlike many local foodies, this bakery was not a part of my childhood or growing up days. Now and then I heard about it and it was a part of my wish list to someday visit it. This Christmas, again I came across a couple of nice food articles about this place and its enormous Christmas Cake sale. Finally, this time I did make my visit.

We tried veg chop, strawberry pastry, chocolate pastry and paneer patty. Undoubtedly, all the items were fresh and authentic. 

Being used to other ‘well decorated and with poised staff’ bakeries, this one seemed a little different and incomplete to me. But the kind of age old loyalty it enjoys amidst generations of people, I am sure that all of its wares are to the mark and people do enjoy and look forward to their visits here.

I've had their Rich Fruit Cake on Christmas Day for many years, almost as a ritual. As a kid, I would beg to be taken along, so that I could whine and plead my way to more goodies. The lemon puff is a delight, as are the puffs. My personal favorites also include the sweet buns and the cookies. The experience of taking home a cake that is still hot from the oven is something that has not grown old with time. Coupled with not-too-steep prices, Nahoum's is THE place for old world bakery charms!

Went there for the first time after planning for ages. Everything, from the chicken Patties to the fruit cake to the rum ball reminds you of the time Chowringhee was about sahebs and horse drawn carriages and weekly balls in star hotels and Dalhousie square and Christmas trees in every Anglo Indian household...simply the must awesome fruit cake you may ever have in a 5000km radius.

The plum cake was fantastic and would come here again for it.
If you are in the new market area, it's a good place to pickup bakery items.

Sadly, I didn't have any childhood memories of visiting this renowned Jewish bakery to reflect upon, when I finally decided to enter Nahoum's for the first time a few months after its iconic owner Mr. David Nahoum passed away. Until then, I'd had only passed a quick glance over the beautifully stacked showcases of cakes and pastries, maybe while pursuing my hunt for something or the other in the interlacing, vibrant lanes of Sir Stuart Hogg Market.
 
After catching a show at the recent film festival held in our city a month back, me and him got promoted to savourers from being mere peepers of the confectioneries. The moment we were inside, the smell of freshly baked pastries and cakes, the wood and glass furniture and the antique decor held an undeniable reflection of the old and classy cosmopolitan Calcutta in front of us. Yes, the place does have a charm of its own which leaves no one untouched.
 
A bit disappointed we were, for missing out on the mutton samosas. Nevertheless, being two super excited kids, we immediately packed away a few things like the Chicken Patty, Chicken Mayonnaise Puff, Chocolate pastry, Lemon Puff and Brownie.
Unfortunately, the filling of the somewhat tough patty was not exactly delicious and the chicken mayo puff had no trace of mayonnaise in it (though its filling was tastier). Then the chocolate pastry was a bit letdown too, as I've had much better pastries from other bakeries in Kolkata. However, the lemon puff was a true foodie's delight and we finally found something that could be relished. The base for the puff was soft, the filling was made of a tangy buttery lemon cream and the icing sugar on top made this one a dreamy package. 
The best treat was the brownie, easily. It was chocolaty, walnutty, a bit crumbly yet firm and very, very buttery. Now, what else would a cake lover need, to go bonkers all over?

 At the end, I may call this my first childhood memory of this 110 years young patisserie, many years down the line from now. Right now, I'm planning my next visit to grab hold of the Rich Fruit Cake as Christmas is just round the corner with all its bells set to jingle already. :)

On a Christmas eve shopping spree of cakes and brownies, I tried out the cheese pastry and it was quite a delight! There was an unexpected amount of a creamy cheese filling inside the sturdy pastry and the whole thing is quite filling.

Nahoum and Sons belongs the old school of baking. Though new sophiscated methods of baking has emerged, nahoums still keep it inthe old way. The place is hidden inide the new market. You can get varieties of baked cakes and confectionaries  here which are good enough. I have visited this place at the time of easter and i was delighted with theor easter eggs and also their old school cakes.

Recommended if you are in new market.

Just uttering a name can make you happy and "Nahoum and Sons" is one such name. Such are the strength of wonderful memories and associations with this establishment that it transports me instantly back to my childhood. Both sets of my grandparents lived near New Market so whenever I stayed with them we climbed onto a rickshaw and trundled off to New Market and naturally no visit to New Market was ever complete without a visit to this quaint wonderland of flavors. Its old world unpretentious charm and huge glass windows displaying the goodies are such a lovely sight to behold. I remember queuing up for my Christmas Cake every winter .... they still make a fantastic old school x-mas cake that is a must buy for me every Christmas. Their solid chocolate Easter Eggs with little cartoons stuck on them as well as the larger colorful ones filled with candy were our ultimate prize and the Easter Buns were legend. The individually wrapped brownies and plum cake available all year through are delicious and packed and carried for our relatives whenever we travel out of Kolkata till date. They also make some lovely home-style cookies and biscuits , chocolate and plain fudge , marzipan candy , delicious macaroons and super garlic bread ( the other rolls and breads are also delicious but I am obsessed with the garlic loaf). No party at home is complete without their delicious Cocktail Mutton Samosas available only every day around 11 am and sold out in a flash (Kindly pre-order as you will come away disappointed otherwise). The Pantheras and Patties are also nice but made old school style. Also if you want a traditional  wedding cake this is one of the best places to order it in the city. Truly its a  trip down nostalgia and a true legacy for any foodie of Kolkata.

A childhood favorite .... used to visit it with my grand parents and we still frequent it for the wonderful garlic bread , brownies , macaroons, fudge and x-mas cake .... they also make the most amazing cocktail mutton samosas which are sold out in an hour every morning without fail ! Three generations of my family have frequented it and its still a happy and nostalgic experience every time I go !

It is said that Kolkata was known to have some of the best restaurants when the rest of the country was learning to eat and if you ask of a traditional bakery, flury's was the name everybody knew. But how many knew that in the narrow pathways of the Hogg Market, somewhere in the middle of a flood of shops and shoppers there is a tradition long living for 111 yrs now. Started by David Nahoum, the roots of this Bakery dates back to 1902 and since then its has been a landmark in the vicinity if Hogg market to make one of the finest bakery items in the city. 

Lets now come out of nostalgia to some present day facts. First, the location - The location is prime yet sheepish, tucked somewhere in the Hogg Market. For first time visitors, it will be fun spending time and turning around again and again in the web of paths in Hogg market. For regulars, it will be a cakewalk. Just take the entry to the Hogg market just opposite to the Citi mart and walk straight. Just ask anybody on the way and they will show you the place. 

Its a medium sized bakery selling many kinds of stuff like brownies, cakes, puffs etc. alongwith many unconventional varieties like date biscuits. They are also quite well known for the wedding cakes they prepare. Many will even argue that they are the only bakery in the city who genuinely know how to make Wedding cakes, and to some extent, its true. 

Quality - Top notch. There are a few items in here which hold taste best above all. For this try the brownie, the plum cake and the date biscuits. Other products are also good like the pastries and chocolate biscuits. The taste of the items are very different from any other bakey mainly bcoz they still use some of the original recipes which started with this shop.

Service - This is not a eat-in bakery so no point of mentioning it. The people selling the items, on the other hand, are pretty well behaved and attentive. In that terms, service is pretty fine.

But there are some cons too about this place. First the location is pretty inside the Hogg Market and the surroundings just outside the bakery can sometime be pretty stingy. So just try to avoid those factors.

There may have no royal or classy touch to it but very inch of this bakey speaks history and tradition. It has stood tall among the rest for so many years now and rightfully can be admitted as one of ther face of the city's doors of history!!!

Nahoum and Sons is synonymous with bakery. In the ancient days, when there was no Kookie Jar, Cakes, Monginis, or even Kathleen, people would flock to this institution to sample some of the best baked goodies available in the city. Though this once famous shop faces stiff competition from others, it is still visited by the old faithful who swear by its delicacies. Me, personally, when I visit this place, do indulge myself in their Black Forest pastry, Chicken Patties, and of course their Apple Pie. These three items, along with their tarts, will instil in a taste that is hard to find elsewhere. 

With the advent of modern baking, there is a rush of fresh-cream cakes in the market. However, Nahoum does their icing the old school way, with icing sugar, water and food colouring. Hence, if you wish to avoid the layers of fat slathered on the cakes available today, this place is a must visit for you.

A few other items of theirs are a must to try out.In winters, a must buy is their cake rusk biscuits. Also available are biscuits with honey and raisins, which actually contain raisins. Or if you prefer a savoury taste, go for the cheese straws. They taste like nectar.

Do not go by the appearance of the shop, the bland appearance hides what is surely the most amazing food experience you can have!!

Cakes cookies, puffs and what not. Hall of fame. A very very long time favourite. Plum cake, pineapple tart, biscuits, date cookies so delicious and nobody but nobody can make such desserts in Kolkata. They bake wonderful breads too. A must try in old Hog market.

Nahoums has marked a distinct position in Kolkata's heritage. Not very old to the fine confectionery of Nahoums, I was mind-blown with the cream rolls, the various assorted chocolate pastries, the puffs and patties that I had been "given"... It was notches better than any other bakery around, notches better!!! 

However, when I personally visited the place, I saw something rather negative about it. It wasn't crowded, it was mobbing! It was dingy. Mosquitoes were swarming all over the place. The hygiene factor, in short, was pretty low here, and that's what stopped me from going back there!

If they could just see to that, it can be reach perfection!

This shop inside New Market at Esplanade is a landmark in the culinary map of Kolkata. Not only do they make lip smacking cakes and sweets, but they are also part of the city's historical legacy being a favorite of the erstwhile British during colonial times. It also holds the distinction of being a very well reputed authentic business belonging to the Jewish community. David Nahoum, the proprietor of the shop who recently passed away was a patriarch of his community. He was also a gentle, amiable man who used to often give free sweets to small kids who came in his shop. May he rest in peace.

Nahoum's is famous for their variety of patties and pastries. Lemon tarts, Rum Balls and Marzipans will make you go back repeatedly. The Pizza Puff , The Eclair, Chocolate Walnut Pastry are just some more options you can explore.
Although the confectionary and sweets section is the flagship part, the chicken and veg patties & cheese cocktail samosas are equally nice. The Tuna Sandwiches are one of a kind.
One thing we tend to look over nowadays is the bread but the garlic bread is strongly suggested. The prices overall are still less than most bakers and confectioners.

Chakraborty Tip : If you enter from the far end of the Simpark mall ; from the side of the fountain, go as follows :

First left - go straight ignoring the first right - take next right - take first left - and voila :)

Nahoum and Sons  . . I bet anybody who visits this place for first time will be as surprised as me  :P :)  Located inside the shabby New Market, this bakery is famous for its pastry and biscuits . .

I tasted Chicken patties, Rum balls, mutton samosa, brownies and just loved eating them :) The prices are also reasonable. 

I had actually travelled for more than a hour and took more than 30 mins to trace out this bakery :) It was worth the effort.

This place is one of the landmarks of Kolkata's heritage, and is definitely a must-visit place for everyone who visits Kolkata. Located deep within the maze of New Market, it boasts of one of the best plum cakes available in the city. The lemon tarts and rum balls are equally desirable. Although the quality has dropped over the years, this still is one of those places where good quality confectionery is available at a very reasonable price.

Nahoums - a legend in the new market area. My ask when someone is visiting from Kolkata is to bring the Nahoums fruit cake or plum cake.Consistency is the name of the game. Rich fruit cake is filled with fruits and has an air of freshness about it even after days.  The cake has remained constant in the era of "poriborton"  - love the place and aroma. 

My suggestion stick to basic and classic items - you will find bliss among the offerings.

One of my oldest childhood memories of Calcutta has been of gobbling down multi-coloured Marzipaans at Nahoums. This is the very reason why my trips to Calcutta are never complete without visiting the place at least once. The best part is, nothing has changed about it, which works wonders for people trying to re-live the past, the old wooden display shelves are still as attractive and dusty; the large marble topped bread counters still look like they will vaporize soon, and the old auntie at the counter still doesn't accept plastic money. 

Of course, don't expect to sit down and enjoy a meal in the comforts of air conditioning, you will just have to pick what you like and enjoy the treats at home. All said and done, everything still tastes like a dream, a dream from my childhood. On my most recent visit, I felt slightly as though the quality has gone down and this is quite possible since old uncle who sat with old auntie has recently passed away. The cakes didn't taste the same *wipes tear from eye*.

As far as recommendations go: Do not walk out of the shop without 2 packs of the Chocolate Fudge and 2 packs of the Onion Sesame Biscuits (or more of those if you don't have issues with fitting into clothes).

Nahoum and Sons has been an integral part of my childhood, and even today, if I am in the New Market Area, I drop in to pick up fudge, marzipan or brownies.

The shop's appearance is a far cry from the tiled, garish design that characterizes most confectionery outlets today. The old-fashioned frontage with products kept on glass shelves or stacked on tables gives the place a charm of its own. The staff are polite and friendly, and chat with regulars like old friends (which they usually become).

Since the Nahoums are no longer able to manage the shop personally due to old age (the last Nahoum living in Calcutta, David, died in March 2013), the shop is no longer able to produce the traditional Jewish items that made it stand out from the rest.

The cakes at Nahoum were very good. The chocolate used was very different from what was used in other major bakeries in the city, and the sponginess of the cake layers was a byword. I must have gone through the entire cake catalogue, and have also had the good fortune of trying out a number of things they were experimenting with. They also use locally produced cheese, which adds to the taste of the items 

Among the savoury items, the Panthras is unique - I don't think there's another bakery that makes a non-vegetarian version. Their Cheese Samosas and Cocktail Samosas are also quite good. Their Chicken Patties have the chicken very finely minced, instead of larger pieces, as is more common. There's also a Pizza Puff which has a very tasty core. They occasionally keep Tuna Sandwiches, which ought to be snapped up. Among the pastries, I've always preferred the Eclair and the Chocolate Walnut Pastry.

Their bread - be it plain, brown, sandwich or garlic - is excellent, and far better than the sawdust we get from the mass-produced bread here. They also have a very good range of savoury and sweet biscuits - their Macaroons used to be famous, but I like others, like the Cheese and Chives biscuits. Their fudge and marzipan is still quite good, and the brownies taste very different from those made by other bakers in the city - it has a hard crust and is quite crispy. Their Plum Tikki sells out within minutes of being made available - people wait for it to arrive in the shop in order to buy it.

It is true that quality has dipped somewhat. The trick is to avoid certain items. For example, their Black Forest Pastry is a new addition, and should be avoided. Therefore, with care, you should be able to find some really good food here.

Nahoum's is supposed to be a major part of a Kolkatan's heritage. I was virtually raised on the cakes from Nahoum's as every time my parents would go to New Market, they would buy cakes and patties from Nahoum's, and take home big bags of Marzipan, Fudge and biscuits. Years have gone by, but I am still in love with the incredibly tasty lemon puff, a light, fluffy, soft pillow of dough oozing perfectly made lemon curd, and the fabulous brownies, not to mention the cheese samosas, the recipe originally from Iran, as told proudly. Also, they have great sweet buns year round. Do not miss these hot rolls of dough studded with dry fruits and topped with plenty of sugar.

Surely one of the best bakery anyone will find in the city.....The shop has a huge heritage and is well know to people for its food.The rich-fruit cake and brownies are marvelous....The breads are different,and are always fresh.One can opt for the Garlic bread,Tutti frutti bread and more.The C.Pastry is very good and dose not have the usual filling...The pastries have a sugary topping,for which they don't attract me.Though the Tarts are nice.... The decor has a touch o heritage,which makes it out of the queue of modern bakery shops/joints. The place is a must visit for most Kolkatans while shopping at  New Market.  The place must be visited before Christmas,for the yummy Fruit cakes,Plum Cakes and brownies.The packed cookies and biscuits are quite good for later bites.
                            
           Though this place needs no description, here was a small one,:-).

Nahoum's makes cakes and pastries which are diffrent from others. What it lacks in glitz, it makes up in old world charm and quality. For me the their best is the Easter eggs. The chocolate is one of the best I have ever tasted (that includes Swiss Chocolates).

Anyone who has been brought up in Calcutta is familiar with this age old bakery famous for its Plum Cakes and Fruit Cakes and the popularity is ever so obvious during the time of Christmas when getting into the shop is almost impossible with a huge possibility of suffocation. For regulars like myself the Garlic bread with the perfect amount of garlic herbs and each slice buttered from within is a must have every week. You can have it with soups, make a sandwich or just eat it by itself. The biscuits, cookies, marzipans are all a treat for the taste buds. The pastries are not the usual cakes with icing it is proper pastry and the chocolate tart needs a special mention. The prices are affordable and the result is a happy stomach which equals to a happy you. Their Chocolate Biscuits are wonderfully chocolaty and with minimum sugar which makes it a treat for those who do not like their tea accompaniments or coffee accompaniments to be too sweet.

When I was a small kid my grandmother told me that the best bakery in town was nahoum's. She used to love the bakery from that shop. I was too young to understand then...but when I did understand, I realized how true it was. This shop placed in the heart of Kolkata (New market or Hogg Market as it was known). The shop is far away from the glitters and polishes of the south kolkata bakery shops like Kokie jar/upper crust etc, however the food is far superior. From the brownie to the garlic bread, from the cakes to the patties...all of these are just wonderful.
This place is not very heavy on the pocket either.
Definitely recommended for all pastry lovers.

This is one of those delightful places that have just become a part of the city's heritage. Their plum cake is literally world-famous and I never tire of trying it.
I've noticed that most people don't look beyond the staples at Nahoums. But my personal favourites are their cookies and crackers: there are always new flavours to try. In today's time, where every lane has a bakery, I find going to Nahoums totally worth it because I am a big fan of biscuits!
Also,I love their chocolate and vanilla fudges: if you like condensed milk,you'll love their fudge. :D I even use it for my own baking sometimes. 
Frankly,I like their savouries more than their pastries: they use royal icing, which doesn't really hold that much appeal for me. In fact, when I go to Nahoums,it's their packaged products that I look for first. 
Another time-tested suggestion: next time you have a kid's birthday party to attend,please take the time out to buy a pack of colourful macaroons from here. It just make their day,I've done it plenty of times. :)

This Jewish bakery is already a part of Calcutta's history and the ambiance will take you back to the beginning of the previous century. Love their garlic bread and tuna sandwiches (only made on weekends). Also the cheese samosas and patties are great. Not a big fan of their pastries, but love their Christmas rich fruit cakes and plum cakes. Another favourite is the brownie. A visit to New Market cannot be complete without Nahoum's.

A visit to New market is incomplete without a visit to our Gold Ol' Nahoums.. I guess a whole lot of Calcuttans have been brought up on these pastries and breads which they have been serving over the years from the same old quaint shop with hazy glass windows... Its part of the folklore of Kolkata now... with eyes wide open we used to wait to be taken to new market and some how i used to manage to lose my way through until you just approach the shops close by you would be drawn in by the whiff of the bakery... 
But those were the days.. now with an array of bakeries offering mind boggling variety of options Nahoums just seemed to have lost its glisten... but still my all time favourites are their bread buns as fresh as they arrive they vanish in no time.. their cheese sticks still retains the flavour well.. otherwise the cream on the pastries doesn't look that appetizing.... but for old times sake the cream rolls are worth a try... But what surprised me in a recent visit was the crumbed egg devils....a must try...
but over all Nahoums is all about nostalgia... i still visit it everytime i get to go to new market but alas their show windows are all empty half of the time...:(

I can remember going to Nahoum as long as I can remember my life. The good old heart cake, with its perfectly done batter, will never disappoint you. The brownies and the biscuits are highly recommended. You might also try their Round Chicken Pattice. The filling is quite different from the usual ones. More so, this place has a fair amount of history attached to it. Explore the shop more for their offerings. A bulk of their products are packed. A pre Christmas visit is a must.

Tip : The authorities are also the people who give you permission to visit the two synagogues off Brabourne Road.

Nahoum is more a part of the vintage charm of kolkata than anything else. old wooden shelves with glass panes, its like a time capsule in there. I dont like the pastries and cakes here, but they make the best breads. the garlic bread is simply awesome and so are the sweet buns.

they make delicious marzipan, fudge, and cookies too. the only place i know that makes bakhlava.. which alotho is very sweet, but i am addicted to it. soft mint candies, are a guilty pleasure.

among the savories, i dont like much but the fish pantaras is yummy.

the chirstmas plum cake is the best here..

over all ... a trip to kolkata is incomplete without nahoum..

His brother,Mr. David Nahoum,is also an expert in confectionery. Therfore, Nahoum & Sons. is prospering in every sense. May Jehova bless "Nahoum & Sons." for a long life.
