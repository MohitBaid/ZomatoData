সস্তায় এবং পুষ্টিকর ,
বাড়ির পাশে,
brekfast থেকে dinner সবই পাওয়া যায়।
কম খরচে বন্ধুদের সাথে খেতে চাইলেও best আবার পকেটের হাল খারাপ থাকলেও প্রেমিকার কাছে সম্মান বাঁচিয়ে দেবে এই resturent ।

This restaurant is located near Garia Station. You can spot this restaurant on the right hand side while heading towards Boalia.

I tried a few items from here of which Rumali roti seemed better than the other ones. I had tandoori roti as well. The taste was good but the size was considerably very small.

The most disappointing part was the biryani I had. I brought 2 packets for me and my sister as dinner. The amount for 1 plate was simply quite enough for 2 people which included a potato piece and an egg. 

The first thing that took me by surprise that I didn't get any so called biryani smell from it. But then when I had the rice it tasted so weird. I don't know why but it didn't seem like biryani. There wasn't any essence of it. The colour was also completely brown which isn't actually the colour of biryani. The saddest part was I coudn't eat all of it. 

I don't what they make now. Maybe someday they will improve!

It's a roadside stall at best. Not recommended at all. Have hardly had anything apart from rotis for takeaway and the odd egg roll. Try at your own luck.

A good hotel.... But the gravies tastes almost same... You should try the chicken roll and the kebabs.. Price is reasonable... Take away option is much better than dine in...
