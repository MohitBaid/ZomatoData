Best Kobiraji place in Kolkata. The Moghlai Porota is equally good. As well as the Chicken Cutlet. The shop opens around 5:30pm and everyday a huge crowd throng this eatery for its mouth watering snacks.

This is a legendary food joint continuing the legacy of North Calcutta for a long time now. Malancha is known for their Kabiraji. I had Kabiraji and Fish fry here. Both were superb and the quality of fish is so good. Please go and have Kabiraji here if you have not already.
