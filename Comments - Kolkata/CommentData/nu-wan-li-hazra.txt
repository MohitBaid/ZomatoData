Nu Wan Li is a hidden gem in every way of description. This joint serves finest quality of Oriental cuisine with a special focus in their pork items. The Chimney soup (small) serves 2 persons easily with good portion of meat balls and generous amount of pork . The pork ribs in black bean sauce is a revelation , tastes yum and never had such tender, juicy , succulent pork pieces before . The interior is nicely done. The service is very good. The pocket pinch is commensurate with the portion they serve.
Overall a big thumbs up and I am going back again for sure.

It was a sudden plan for a porky dinner earlier today and hence decided to drop in at this quiant Chinese Cafe near Hazra Law College for the first time.. 

Decor & service: Intricate & authentic Chinese decor - compliments the genre of food served perfectly.. Gives you a soothing yet mystic vibe right on entry.. Service is prompt and up to the mark..

Food: Well, let's come to the real deal now..

#CHIMNEYSOUP: This is thier speciality and indeed it was the star of the show. Quantity, quality, taste and variety of ingredients (generous portions of pork, chicken, prawn, lamb, mushroom and other veggies) - it's a thumbs up on every aspect.. Two of us were having a hard time finishing it since it was loaded with meat to the brim.. Mind you, we took the small one which was a steal at only 300 bucks.. (A large one is also available which caters to 5 people for only 600 bucks).. This is hands down the best chimney soup in town (keeping Eau Chew in mind as well where it costs almost double that amount)..

#PORKSPARERIBSINBLACKBEANSAUCE : This was yet another excellent dish we got to hog - the meat was extremely tender and the black bean sauce took the dish to an altogether different high.. 

Overall, this is a Pork haven and also a must visit for any Chinese foodlover.. Pocket pinch is unbelievably economical considering the quality of the food served..

Verdict: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED..

Journey of an #EpicureanCineTrotter continues..

Be it for take away purpose or for dine in, I would like to call Nu Wan Li a neighborhood restaurant or a restaurant next door.
In comparison with price, Nu Wan Li offers sufficient quantity, enough to feed 3 people in case of Main courses and 4 people when it comes to side dishes.
For example: A plate of chili pork comes at rs 250.
Situated beside Edudigm Education Services Pvt and opposite of Bank of Vadodara, Hazra, Kolkata,
Nu wali surely is a place for having delicious Pork dishes and other Chinese foods.

This place is located very near to Hazra law college and quite popular among students due to their pocket friendly prices.The restaurant is about 2minutes walk from hazra law college gate along hazra road.The place remain closed from 2pm-5pm and reopens after that. They do not charge extra tax on the bill which is a plus point.The chinese items here are worth a try...
Lemon chicken: This is for those who do not like spicy food. Very light subtle flavors of the gravy make this dish a good accompaniment with noodles and rice.
Schezwan chicken: Chicken pieces were really soft,well cooked and the sauce was spicy hot.Great for spicy food lovers.
Mixed chilly garlic noodles: Average in taste,tasted like regular hakka noodles.Nothing extraordinary. Flavors of garlic and chilly not dominant as it should have been.
Mixed Hakka noodles: Good in taste.Quantity enough for two people.

Stationed close to hazra law college this joint serves authentic chinese.
I being a intense pork lover had to visit this place,owing recomendations.
The ones that i digged into were:
Pork ribs in hot garlic sause, the dish was just so good and perfect. 
Kung pao chicken,which to my wonder was also tasted wow. 
The food here is worth a try. 
Shout-out for all the pork lovers you gotta visit this little place. 
The ambience and the decor is also good.
If you've got a bunch to enjoy pork over you shpuld be headed for this place.
There is a little thing that i would like to mention here.
The joint should change its timings, its just not correct. 
For the ones opting to visit this during afternoon its not available l. It opens post 5pm.
I hope the restaurant management spreads this word.
Never-the-less i was just so impressed by the good food i had here. 
The pocket pinch is also moderate.
This place gets a 'Must try' tag on an obvious note.

They have no f***ing clue how pan fried momo is made...
.
They took my order for "chicken pan fried momo in tomato garlic sauce" and brought me simple fried momo..
When i asked about it, they said thats how pan fried momo is made and looks like..
It tastes awful witha lot of salt in it.. the amount of salt they put kinda burnt my tongue .
The ac doesnt work.
Just look at the picture. Apparently thats how pan fried momo in tomato garlic sauce should looks like.

😆😋I'm Rating This Restaurant Nu Wan Li, Hazra 5.0 Because The Service Ambience And Decor Was Awesome With Their Food Quality And Quantity. Today On 5th September 2017 On Teacher's Day And On India's Consecutive Victories Over Sri Lanka In Tests And ODI's 3-0 And 5-0. And Tomorrow India Will Win Over Sri Lanka Again In 1T20 And West Indies Level Up The Test Series Against England 1-1 And Bangladesh Win Against Australia In 2 Test Series 1-0. That's The Only Reason I Visited This Place Nu Wan Li, Hazra. On My 1st Visit I Ordered 1 Plate Chicken Shrimps Hakka Chowmein For Rs. 150/- & Chilly Baby Corn (Gravy) For Rs. 150/- Within Rs. 300/- I Was Full And Satisfied With Their Quality And Quantity. Thank you Nu Wan Li For Making My Day Superb.😃😄

Situated near my University,this is the most pocket-friendly place to satisfy your sudden pork cravings. They serve some great chilli pork (both dry and gravy). The chicken dishes are equally good and delicious. I particularly remember having a lip-smacking crispy chicken. The noodles and rice are tasty as well. The quantity is huge and absolutely worth your money.The only downside is the place is a bit shabby, particularly the entrance and the dimly lit ambience is a bit creepy. However, the staff is nice. Do try their pork dishes and you will be so happy that they don't burn a hole in your pocket, yet taste so yum!

Took out my family (of seven) to dinner here last Sunday. I had already eaten their Chinese chopsuey before and so was sure this would be a safe bet.
Before taking about the food or ambience , I would like to talk about the best part of this restaurant - the hospitable service of the staff and their accommodating nature. There is one member in our family who is a sattvik vegetarian (no onion, garlic or spring onions), and her food had to be prepared in a completely unique way. When I let them know about this predicament, they made sure that they looked into the matter with utmost care and were very careful while preparing and serving the food for us.
Now, let us come to the ambience. Yes, it IS a little shabby, or rather it is not as swanky as most other Chinese restaurants in the city but I loved the simplicity and minimalism of the place.Also,it is the entrance which is shabbier, the interiors aren't that bad.
Now, coming to the most important part - the food. We had ordered a starter of Crispy Fried Chilly Baby Corn, Veg fried rice, sweet and sour veg, Prawn and chicken fried rice, chicken Manchurian and lemon chicken. Each of the dishes tasted pretty good. It goes without saying that since the veg dishes were not in their usual avatar, they did not taste as good as they would have otherwise done, but there is no place for me to complain. The fried rice was pretty good, they were quite generous with the prawn and chicken. The Manchurian was your good, old Indian Chinese with a spicy palate. The winner though was the lemon chicken. It tasted DIVINE. The perfect balance of the tartness of lemon and the sweetness of honey was commendable. It was just amazing.
The bill for 7 people came to a mere Rs. 1191, where we had to pack almost 1/3rd of the food for home as the quantity was overwhelming.

This restaurant is located in Hazra and can be called a hidden gem. It serves one of the best pork dishes at economical prices. I found this place and decided to visit with my friends.
The place is a little shady, it's an old restaurant with aged staff but the service is really good.
We ordered:
1. Pork fried rice- They give a good quantity of rice with minced pork pieces which are enough to serve 2-3 persons.
2. Pork ribs in black bean sauce- the pork ribs were so well cooked and together with the black bean sauce, tasted out of the world. I loved it so much I took an extra piece. The pork ribs were juicy and soft. 
3. Chili pork- this dish has pork fried in chili sauce and spices and is served dry. Taste is top notch.
The presentation is ordinary and everything about this place is homely and nice. The main attraction is the tasty food, especially the pork dishes which are available at economical prices. I am a pork lover and would keep going back to these place to try all the pork dishes. Must visit this restaurant if you are a pork lover.

This place is hard to notice because of its inconspicuous location in Hazra road, but it's one of the averagely priced Chinese places with good food.
Their chili pork and garlic pork  were tender and tasty. Pork with mushroom was a tad bland.
The noodles were regular like every other place..the hakka was a little oily and the Cantonese needed more salt. 
Drop by if you're having a pork craving.

This is an amazing, amazing place to have Chinese food. Having been visiting it for over 3 years, I find the service quick, the staff polite, the ambience quiet and welcoming and most importantly, the food DELICIOUS. The chicken here, especially, is not like anything you'd normally get in other Chinese restaurants, and then again, if quantity means a bit to you, this place has almost massive servings, with a bowl of noodles sufficient for two. The pricing is decent, and the only con is the space crunch, the restaurant being furnished with tables too small to sit four. Altogether, a 4.5/5 from me :)
Dishes to try out: Mixed hakka noodles, fish in Hunan sauce, chilly chicken in gravy, chilly pork.

Went there today with friends.After college we were extremely hungry, so just decided to hop in. We had seen this place before but tried it for the first time.
It's got a simple chinese decor and it's quite spacious, even got a table for 10.
Coming to the food, we ordered mixed chilly garlic chowmein and mixed hakka chowmein , along with chilly pork and wan-li special chilly chicken. The quantity was quite good,served hot. The chilly garlic chowmein and​ the chilly pork deserve a wow. The pork was well cooked and soft.
Service was quite prompt.
So it's a nearby "China Town wala" restaurant for me with the reasonable price (it's really cheap) and excellent quality as well as quantity.

It is a hidden gem in Kolkata as far as the indo-Chinese dishes are concerned. The chilli pork dry will get 10on10 any day. Normal Chilli chicken/fish/pork is equally good. Clay pot chicken, pork ribs in black bean sauce, honey chicken will get a close 9.5/10 ahead of the dry chilli pork. The soups and other starters are good as well. Infact all the dishes are well cooked. I have been a regular since 2012 and have never fallen sick eating their food. The interiors are modest and dimly lit. The owners/manager/staff are too well behaved to be true. I just love this place.

This is a very nice and pocket-friendly restaurant where you can hangout with friends and have a bite of delicious Chinese food. At first in starters we ordered Fried Spring Chicken, Crispy Chicken, Threaded Chicken. Fried Spring Chicken was the best one among these, I will order it every time I visit this place. Crispy Chicken and Threaded Chicken were okay. For main course we ordered Chilli Garlic Noodles, Sanghai Fried Rice, Chicken Sizzler and Pork Ribs in Black-Bean Sauce, and all the main courses were fantastic. I am actually a fan of Chinese starters only but the noodles and fried rice were just too amazing. The Pork ribs and sizzlers were also very delicious. If you visit this place I will recommend you to try Fried Spring Chicken, Chicken Sizzlers, Pork Ribs in Black-Bean Sauce and Sanghai Fried Rice.

During my varsity days, this was a place I used to go for having Chinese... Location can be tricky for first timers.
Calling of ambience and decor that's minimal here, although some pretty dragon lamps give the vibe of Chinese eatery. 
Well, I've tried lung fung soup which was made to perfection with enough egg froth and generous meat pieces. Mixed chow-mein was also delectable, but their signature dish is the dry chilli chicken... It totally worth all the penny.
To sum up in few words if you can omit some handful cons like the location, etiquettes, ambience then this place can totally live upto the expectations!

Chinese food will have me entering a bear cave, if that is where it is served. I had read some very nice reviews of Nu Wan Li and when in the neighboring area, decided upon a picking up a parcel or two for the dinner that would follow.
My order comprised of chicken drumsticks, prawn hakka noodles and chilli chicken with gravy. 

The food is decent and palatable. No complaints there with the noodles or the chilli chicken. The main disappointment lay with the drumsticks. They were flash fried in hot oil, leaving the exterior brown and crispy, while the insides lay slightly pink. Not something I wanted to bite into.

So I came across this place on zomato and decided to check it out with a friend. The place was a little difficult to find and once we did, it looked kinda shabby from outside. We entered and we were courteously welcomed by the manager and escorted to a our table. The décor wasn't great, it was dimly lit and didn't feel shabby from the inside. 
We ordered Pork Button Mushroom Veg and Pork Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce. The Pork Button Mushroom Veg was well cooked and tasty and proportions were large. The pieces were soft and juicy. The Pork Spare Ribs were not ribs but pork with bone but the preparation was delicious. It is one of the best pork dishes that I've had at a budget restaurant and it makes you crave for more. It's a must try for anyone visiting this place. 

Overall, if you love pork, and you are on a budget, you should definitely check this place out. The staff are pleasant and it earns them brownie points.

We were hungry, and we needed a place which serves Chinese at reasonable prices. We were near Ballygunge Phari, and suddenly the name Nu Wan Li cropped up in my mind. It's situated a little away from there on Hajra Road. Although it is on the main road, it's easy to miss it, so keep your eyes open.

The restaurant may look shabby from the outside, but the inside isn't so bad. It is air-conditioned, with decent lighting, and adorned with Chinese lamps, wall hangings, and other decorations. The ambience was quite calm and relieving.

We quickly decided our order, and the foods came in quite quickly.

1. Green Pepper Chicken: Nicely cooked tender pieces of chicken with loads of green capsicum and green chillies. It tasted amazing.

2. Egg Hakka Noodles: The first thing I noted was its huge quantity, I mean seriously huge, with generous amount of egg pieces. However the noodles was a bit oily, and prepared with cheap sauces.

3. Szechuan Chicken: Looked tempting, but failed to please me. It was a little too sweet for my taste, and the pieces of chicken were thickly coated.

Nevertheless, we were relieved of our hunger, and the foods were okay for the prices we paid. The bill amounted to Rs 460, which definitely made us happy. This place is ideal for students, and serves huge quantities of decent food at very reasonable prices. The staff who takes orders and serves, he's a really friendly man, and you can ask him to make the foods as per your liking.

This place is very close to my house and I have been there a number of times and even brought in home delivery at times. There is nothing fancy about this place, very basic decor but the food is really good.. The chilli garlic noodles and Manchurian chicken are just mouth watering.. Other dishes are also good but once I had tried their chicken sizzler which was too sweet for my liking.. I m not quite a pork meat lover, but my friends are and they surely do like it here.. Coming to the prices, they are very pocket friendly and they don't charge any taxes. Service is nice.

Visited this place on quite a few occasions. Love their Mixed Cantonese Noodles and Roast Chilly Pork. You can also try Chilly garlic noodles Rice Noodles Fried rice  and Chicken Side dishes. The quantity of food is enough for two people, The ambience is good. The prices are cheap and affordable if you compare with the other restaurants and they don't charge any VAT or services tax. Try this place, you won't be disappointed.

This place is one of the very few eating house left in kolkata ... its non decorative, very dim lights with all the usual stuff that you expect from such eating houses.... 

Service is excelent, thoug just two people managing the place ... 

Food is good with prices a bit towards heigher side with respect to the place it is  ( only the side dishes) , portions of rice and noodles are enough for 2 people ...

 Kolkata Chinese as usual  tests good with eye poping colours,  rice is a better option than noodes in here.. Most of the chicken items are good , prawn and fish itms are just ok and its expected ..

Its surely not a must go  .. but if you are near hazra road and need to refuel yourself or parcel food then its the place to be ....

By the way .. their spicy means very spicy .. so order accordingly  :)  Happy Fooding

Interior is air conditioned but the plastic sheets on the tables give it a very shabby look . Price is not reasonable for the food they serve and the atmosphere you eat in.
We expected to have some quality pork , but the SPARE RIBS IN HOT GARLIC SAUCE had a pathetic smell with the meat , which was very  chewy and mostly fat. We complained about the stink and dish was replaced by CLAYPOT CHIKCEN IN HOISIN SAUCE which was again some chicken cubes immersed in a pool of oil with some bland sauce. 
CHICKEN SHRIMP CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES was spicy and tasty but somehow it carried a weird smell too , i guess the qualiy of meat or poultry they use is not upto mark.
One thing more the noodles had some plastic strips in it , which clearly reflects the unhygienic conditions the food is cooked in.
Sad experience. Never going back for sure.

One of the best Chinese restaurants I have been to.
I L.O.V.E. their Chilli Pork! Their Chicken Sizzlers are mind blowingly yummy. So are their rice dishes and Pork Spare Ribs In Black Bean Sauce.
Ambience is nice.I have been there mostly during noon so its quite quiet during that time of the day.
Staffs are really friendly and nice even though the service is a bit slow. But trust me once the food arrives you will forget it all!

Being a student of Department Of Law, CU , Hazra Campus , Nu Wan Li is the treasury for us.
Being it a birthday treat, or a lunch or a simple hangout , we are always up fir it  .
My favourite dish is the Crispy chilly baby corn , chicken clear soup , Garlic Rice , Hot & sweet garlic chicken
The best part is they make their dish taste according to your want

I tried this place for the first time in 2009 and then i missed out a couple of years and then again decided to try out wanli and it was superb as usual. I and my fiance are a regular customer of this place and the delicacies served are just mouth-watering..the chinese dishes are authentic in taste. I rili like the ambience and the people working there are very generous. My favourite dishes in Nu-wanli is Chicken Sizzler people should rili try out this dish. Their mixed fried rice garlic chicken and Chilly pork are a treat to the foodies.

I have heard a lot about this place and its good food, so to taste that last week I ordered for Mixed Rice noodles (my personal favourite in noodles) and sweet and sour chicken for home delivery at my friends place, which is near to this place. I was really having a great expectation but somehow it was not met. The delivery was fast just within 10 minutes but food was not that good. The noodles quantity was pretty good, enough for 2 people but it was kind of dry and tasteless and quantity of chicken, egg and prawn in it was not that much. The gravy of the sweet and sour chicken was tasty but the chicken was again not that good. There were total 6 pieces of chicken but it was more of batter than solid piece of chicken. Just because I was hungry and it was lunch time, I had to have it, though couldn't finish it as I didn't like the taste at all and overall I was absolutely very disappointed. I was thinking to visit the restaurant and have some of their famous dishes after hearing and reading about this place, but after my last week's experience, I'll really think twice before stepping there anymore.

Had been here too many times during my college days. The food is really tasty, though some gravies might be a little heavy on salt. I particularly like their pan fried momos with the oily green chilli dip. They are not doused in an angry looking red sauce after being friend vigorously, rather they are lightly fried without any overpowering coating. Have to go there soon and have them again.

Nu Wan Li is a must visit for Chinese lovers. I started visiting this place five years back, and i have been visiting innumerable times ever since.
This place has a very nice decor with cordial staffs. The service is very good coz they take max 15 minutes to deliver the ordered dishes. Price is extremely reasonable. Food is great in terms of both quantity and quality. They provide some authentic Chinese flavors.
P.S: you don't even need to pay any taxes for all these...

Recommended dishes in Nu Wan Li:
Clay Pot Chicken in Hunan Sauce/ Hoi Sin Sauce
Chilli Pork
Chicken Red Wine
Any Rice Noodles
Honey Noodle

Nu Wan Li is our common take out joint when my mum sister or me feels too lethargic  to cook food...(and trust me that happens often)..... I have special Liking towards their Mixed Rice Noodles and what earns my extra brownie points is if asked they add extra amount of poke which is always a plus plus plus for me. The Joint itself is very small and cozy nothing write home about...then it's food is definitely something that grabs your attention. Their Garlic chicken in red sauce ranks top in my yummy list and I am a die hard fan of their chilli pork and chicken asparagus soup.... But recently the quality of the meat specially the poke has become a little chewy which earns them a negative marking in my accord,,,,Overall good chinese food....great service...but there is lot of room for improvement mainly in the quality of their meat.

This review is straight from the tummy. Rainy afternoon, hungry friends and empty house. Food from this place rocked the day. 

We located this place on Zomato and ordered only three items (since we weren't sure able the place) : pork chow, egg chow and chicken button mushroom gravy. 

Their home delivery is prompt, the quantity is HUGE and the food it AWESOME. 

Quantity : Each item can be easily shared by two or more people. 
Quality : out-of-the-world. Taste was perfect, well cooked meat and noodles. We had ordered for hakka noodles and one could have easily had it without ordering a side dish (yep! That YUMMY) 
Price : Affordable. Worth every penny.

If you love your Chinese, then this is the place to go to! I was introduced to it by a friend and haven't stopped coming here since 2012. Their Pork Spare Ribs in Hot Garlic Sauce and Chicken Sizzlers are great. The service is prompt and they do not turn you out, even if you make a lot of noise! It is a great place to go to with a limited budget. 

P.S. Don't miss the waiters pull out planks from the tables to make them bigger. Innovative, I say!

Located just opposite to my office.. Might be a little difficult to locate due to its little red small door at entrance that is almost camofloughed with the surrounding. But if you get inside you are up for a surprise,
Total chinese themed restuarant, clean, fast sevice, wonderful decor, filled with north indians..
Even the menu is made according to the theme. 
We ordered sanghai fried rice and chili chicken. Fried rice had both noodles and rice. It was really good and did easily fill two hungry stomachs.

I chanced upon it when I went there for repairing my car. Felt very hungry so was looking around, when it's sign caught my eye. After having assured by the owner of the auto shop where my car was being repaired, I went inside. The restaurant was tastefully decorated with Chinese decorating articles. Especially I love one picture of a Chinese boat quietly flowing down a river.
The staff know me by now so I get good treatments. I love their clay pot cuisine. They are simply out of this world. It is their specialty. The portions are also large and filling. Tastes great. But I suppose they don't want publicity, as they put up very little sign, so that you tend to miss it out if you are unaware.

The outer appearance is not an eye catching one,but when we entered,it was impressive as it was a tidy place,with dim lights,nice interior,creating an environment of peace. The food was really worth enjoying,the amount they provide can be easily shared by two persons, and much pocket friendly.

I'm lucky to have friends who find out such amazing places for me! A small restaurant, situated at a not-so-easily-to-be-found lanes of Hazra (near law college), offering dishes that are mouth watering and goes easy on your pocket as well. 
We ordered Crispy chicken in the starters and it sure will make your crave for more. A must have!
Then for main course, egg gravy noodles, mixed noodles, fried rice and chicken noodles. The gravy noodles here is the best I've had so far. For the side dishes, go for Hunan chicken. Again a best of all I had. The chicken pieces are so soft and tender. Precisely what foodgasm stands for! 
We had ordered 3 more chicken side dishes. And all it cost us was Rs. 1415 only for a group of 6! 
All in all, a must visit restaurant that will not burn a hole in your pocket and also fill your stomach with fabulous Chinese food!

Firstly as it is located in a very shady place its very tough to find this restaurant and also easy to miss as it hardly looks like a restaurant from outside. However once u hv found it and after the initial repulsion if u choose to enter it then you will find one of the best pocket friendly Chinese restaurant. The inside is dimly lit and its always less crowded and is a good place for hanging out. Coming to the food I hv tried their chicken rice noodles with schezwan chicken. The rice noodles was good but the side dish was amazing!! The Manchurian fish was a bit bland as I dint find it spicy enough but their claypot hunan fish or chicken is out of the world. The chef's special chicken dishes are on my wish list. Their simple veg fried rice is evn so tasty and do try their fish items..i promise it will totally blow off ur mind. I would love to try their whole fish in black bean sauce. Even their gravy noodles are perfect. Among the starters fried spring chicken is a very good one...will leave you craving for more. They also serve pork delicacies which are quite famous. They serve in such huge quantities that one main dish nd a side dish can suffice for two wel grown adults. Such a pocket friendly joint with tasty food makes me visit this restaurant whenever I hv Chinese cravings. Its a real saviour for people who have near empty wallets but love to have tasty Chinese fare.

I have been a regular at this outketvand have raved about their food to a lot of people . But unfortunately the last two visits have turned out to be really nasty . I had previously written a review full of praises for them but I am forced to change my opinion and have decided will never set foot in the place . 

They have served me a pork chimney soup when I categorically told them no pork . 1st time I didn't say anything . The next day the same mistake again . When told to replace , they gave me another soup which had pork bits at the end . And I think they just fished out the pork from my old soup and returned it . 

They served me a fish ( which they said is non oily ) was loaded in oil and non seasoned . The fish stank and when I refused to eat it .I was told not to pay for it . 

Pathetic . Serving pork to a non pork eater is a crime . And that too repeating the mistake and then acting smart about it . 

I always wondedred why this place is always empty . Now I know . 

Shame !

in 3 years of my life at Department of law, CU on almost special occassion the one and only name that stroke my mind and still strikes is Nu wang li. located on hazra road, this joint is a regular one for people of DOL and they never disappoint us serving the best authentic chinese in kolkata at such pocket friendly prices!
have tried their momos, almost every noodles, rice and chicken items. other than the momos all items are delicious. momos, i feel are not upto the mark. but the rice, noodles, chicken items are delicious.
since i love spicy, my favourite is the chicken chilly garlic noodles :D. mixed fried rice is good too.
the best part is the quantity. 1 bowl rice/noodles is more than enough for two bhukkars. they serve 8 big pieces chicken in a bowl.
only con is that soft drinks are overpriced. otherwise, friendly staffs, nice ambience, Nu wang li rocks!

I've been going to this place ever since I was a kid. Even now, when I come to Cal on a break, I make sure I go here at least once. The restaurant is perhaps one of the lesser known good Chinese restaurants in South Calcutta. If you keep the slightly-shady location aside, there is nothing bad that I can say about the place.

The food here is really great. Personal favourites are the chicken button mushroom soup and the garlic chicken.
Most of the dishes and soups are a real treat for the taste buds. The place serves quite a few pork delicacies too, if you have a thing for it.

The ambience is that of a simple quiet dimly lit Chinese restaurant. Nothing fancy though.

All in all, if you like good Chinese food and you don't mind if the restaurant is not in a prime location, you should definitely give it a try. Chances are you'd become a regular like me :)

If you can bear little pain of finding this restaurant which is very close to the Department of Law,CU yet hides from our view then a delightful surprise awaits you inside :)

Its a spacious restaurant and is very nicely decorated with traditional Chinese  paintings and showpieces. The lighting soothes the eyes. 

Coming to the food,we ordered Chicken noodle soup and Chicken sizzler. The service was swift. The soup was very bald and my taste buds did not appreciate it much. But wait...the sizzler was AMAZING with a capital A. The soft chunks of chicken melted in my mouth and the taste is to stay forever. 

The best part is how happy your pocket stays after a good lunch. ^_^

To start with, being located in the middle of the road connecting Ballygunge to Hazra, Nu Wan Li would have been really tough to locate without the GPS and Zomato.

Firstly, DO NOT go by the looks of the little entrance to this little place, for the dim interiors host some amazingly delicious and inexpensive food.
The Chicken Noodle Soup tasted slightly bland, but the Chicken Sizzler that followed it was the the real deal! 8 pieces of spicy chicken was heavenly.That made up my day.

To add to the bliss, the ambiance was satisfying, the service was swift and the bill was happiness for the wallet.

I am a fan of their dragon-shaped door handle as well. Check it out!

After reading Rishav's review and with him justly pointing out that my friend and fellow foodie Poorna had rated it a 4 I had decided to try out Nu Wan Li. Recently when the maid called in sick I decided to pick up a takeaway from here and give it a shot. My order comprised of Boneless Chilli Chicken , Garlic Chicken , Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles and Chicken Fried Rice. The food was ready in about 20 minutes and I carried it home. Rice was decent , Noodles were a tad spicy for me but then I don't eat too much spice so those who do would enjoy it. While both the Chilli and Garlic Chicken were good in terms of taste of the gravies/sauces I got a couple of slightly underdone Chicken Pieces in both the dishes and this put me off a bit as I am not into underdone proteins. However quantity and value for money are both very decent.

** Location = Hazra Road, 7-8 minutes walk from The Department Of Law, CU or Hazra Law College.

** Brief = A saviour of the hungry souls of the University for a long time. I have also not been any exception. I have been around 40 times in the last 4 years of my University life :D Be it a sad moment or a celebration Nu Wan Li is the solution :P

** Ambiance = The ambiance is decent, nothing special. Its Chinese in the decor as well. Though just outside the restaurant there are garages and all so its not a great place to look from outside. But who cares, they serve superb chinese , very quickly and at cheap rates.The servers are very polite and friendly to the core. If you visit,dont forget to wave them "BYE" :)

** Things tried = I dont like pork. So I have tried almost everything here except for the pork items.
The rices and the chowmiens are plenty to serve 2 people. They are nicley made and served hot. 
The side dishes are also pretty delicious, from the Chicken Manchurians, garlic chickens, fish in chili wine sauce, everything are just superb for my likings.

**Recommended = Chicken fried rice,mixed hakka chowmien, with fish in wine sauce, schezwan chicken are my personal favourites.

** Purse Check = They are very decently priced. Rs.400/- for 2 people will be more than enough.

** Overall = I have a special soft corner for this place and probably will continue having the same.
Cheers. Love u Nu Wan Li :)

I'll be honest and say that I'll be a bit biassed while writing this review. Being an ex-student of the Department of Law, CU, this place brings back a lot of memories of good old college days. First and foremost, I should mention that the behaviour of the staff is amazing. Each time you enter the place you'll be greeted with a lot of warmth and such great behaviour will continue till the time you leave. Coming to the food, I've tried a lot of dishes there but would specially recommend the sea food fried rice and the pork spare ribs in black bean sauce. The pan fried chicken momo was also a hot favourite for us. It would be a little foolish to expect something exotic and out of the world as the price is very reasonable. I just remember this one time when I'd found that the prawn in a particular dish was not very clean. On complaining though they had immediately replaced the dish.

So, if you're anywhere near Hazra road and are looking for some good Chinese food coupled with pocket friendliness, think no further. I wish Nu Wan Li all the best. Keep feeding the hungry law students with great food as always.

Not fond of the location as it somewhat reminds of tangra with dirty lanes leading to cheap bars cum restaurants (cheap people going for cheap drink and horrible food ) . 
Now the much talked about spare ribs. True to its name its few grams of meats (spared) clinging to ribs for their lives. 
Its more like LOCAL CHILLI CHICKEN WITH BONES.
Taste wise its good ( not like "china town" chinese food ) nice flavours also. 
Spare (the) ribs "chef's special " bit more pricey compared to other other items.
Good to see some chinese dessert items apart from darsan & icecream at every other place.
a tad dissapointed, otherwise recommended for so called E-gen foodies to take a try and boast about you find to your friendzzzzzzz

happy eating

This Saturday i took my partner to this new place ( new find on Zomato ). A little tricky to locate and easy to miss, i followed directions as given here in the reviews and was able to spot very easily.
The place had decent seating capacity, typical Chinese decor, not too crowded, which we liked.
The waiter was helpful and suggested a few things and we finally ordered our food, which came in minutes.
We had ordered one Chinese Sizzler first. I have never had a sizzler prepared in Chinese style and was excited. The quantity was good, very well prepared..bursting with flavor. Our second order was Pork Spare Ribs in Szechaun Sauce. The sauce was spicy,tasty and so flavorsome. But it was a bit too oily for us as we were not having any noodles/rice. Also,  though this dish is priced more than regular pork dishes, it had eight boney- pieces but barely any meat on them, which was such a shame for such a wonderful preparation. So, i deduct half-a-point for that. Otherwise, this is a nice place,good no-frill ambiance, pocket friendly.

Let’s cut to the chase, all the non vegetarians like me who are ardent followers and religiously worship chicken always love a good hearty meal loaded with oodles of chicken.
This small little joint also near my college :p ( MAKES you wonder why I took up admission in this college) ;) is not too famous as half the people I tell about it haven’t heard its name , but as they say “ THE MOST BRIGHTEST DIAMONDS LIE IN THE DEEP” or something like that , this place offers great Chinese food at pretty economical prices and its mouth watering , I have been there often just to be enthralled every time by the different preparations of chicken they have to offer, also special mention to the 2 dessert items they have at the end of the menu  - “HONEY FRIED APPLE  & FRIED BANANA WITH HONEY “ basically the purpose of my visit every time. The chicken sizzler is another favorite of mine as it is crispy till the last piece and fresh to the “H”, they also have a wide variety of Pork items and if you tell them they prepare it as per your wish like with “no fat” or “more fat”:p. the quantity in terms of one plate each of Fried Rice, a Plate of Noodles is more than sumptuous for one person to finish (MERI BAAT AUR HAI). The décor is pretty bland, but then I go to eat not to see and admire the serene beauty of the landscape (HA HA).
VERDICT – Pocket friendly, good food, very I mean very cordial staff and soft spoken. 
DIRECTIONS- Reach DEPT of law CALCUTTA UNIV HAZRA CAMPUS any way you can , start walking toward s hazra more keeping to your left , you may miss it so u have to be attentive , its not too far from the college.

Located in Hazra, New Wan Li is a small restaurant serving great Chinese food. The  place has typical Chinese decor with red lights, dragon motifs and Buddha statues. The quality as well as the quantity of the food is pretty good. The must tries are the chicken hot n sour soup, chicken pakora and the cantonese noodles. The staff here is extremely courteous and well-behaved. The price is reasonable as well. A meal for 4 costs around 800-1000 including soft drinks. New Wan Li gets a 4/5 from me.

One evening I was driving down Hazra road and happened to spot Nu Wan Li. I could not stop then so later on I looked it up on Zomato and sure enough it was there and that too with a review from one of my two favourite reviewers, Poorna Di, the other reviewer of course being Rukshana di.
Well if Poorna Banerjee rates it 4.0 it should definitely be worth trying. So last night I went to Nu Wan Li. It is not really a warm and inviting place so I decided to do a take away.
The service was decently quick and I had to wait for about 15-20 mins for my order to arrive. One mixed hakka noodles and one portion of pork spare ribs in hot garlic sauce. Both the hakka noodles and the spare ribs as I had expected after visiting the restaurant were way too oily, but the I definitely liked the sauce in which the ribs were cooked. The hot garlic sauce was sweet to start with finally culminating in to spicy and ending with a heat that makes you sweat. I like that. As per my request the fat was proportionately pretty less, but of course spare ribs are bound to have a bit of fat.
Overall I liked the food and the quantity served was very impressive. The food that I ordered sufficed for three people. But the quality of food served does not do justice to the prices charged. Only two items set me back by ₹ 325. Despite the huge quantities I think the prices could have been more justifiable. But I'll probably give the other items on the menu a try.

Don't judge a book by its cover, and a restaurant by its exterior. That's something you should bear in mind when you walk into Nu Wan Li. Alternatively, you can opt for the home delivery option - I've done so quite a few times over the past few months. 

Ultimately, the experience here can be broken down into three major segments -

Price - The food here is priced quite reasonably. In fact, I'd recommend it to college students with near-empty wallets. Not a place for first, second or even third dates, but definitely a place where you can hang out for some time with your friends. The portions are also large for their respective price tags, and the staff don't try to foist the pricier food on you by recommending their taste. Soups, noodles, fried rice and the usual fare are priced well, and if you think the side dishes cost a mite higher than they should, let me assure you that the portions more than make up for it.

Taste - The food here tastes good. Living in Kolkata, it's impossible to not have a couple of bad experiences with the ubiquitous Chinese food on the streets of the city. Nu Wan Li provides a welcome relief, by sticking to the tried and tested dishes of the Kolkata-Chinese heritage, while introducing a few different items that are usually not available in such restaurants. I, for one, am a fan of their Pork Fu- Mei Mein, which is a sweet and sticky dry noodle that delights my taste buds. For their prices, their food (and portions) earn them a rating of 4 from me. The Chilly Garlic Noodles (as mentioned below repeatedly), the different soups (the chimney soup here is really good), and a brilliant Chinese chop suey which I've enjoyed several times this past winter. 

Service - I can't really speak much about the service in-situ, because I'm yet to sit there and have a meal. The staff, however, are always polite and courteous, and eager to give you the best service they can offer. Home delivery is also prompt, and the food always arrives piping hot, and should be enjoyed as such.

Quick word of advice at the end of the review. Unless you want to shave a few minutes off the lifespan of your heart every time you eat here, ask them to use less fatty portions of pork.

I have always felt that Nu Wan Li belongs in Chinatown, Tangra, and not in such a nondescript place on Hazra Road. It is easy to miss even while you walk past it, and on entering will definitely not look very inviting. However, once you have tried the food here, you could possibly find a new favourite place to go to when you want Chinese. The service is extremely slow here, so I would not suggest going here for a quick bite, or when you are really hungry. Try this place when you have quite some time to spare, and I guess you will not be disappointed. I have been to this place a few times, both for take-away and for having lunch/dinner. Everytime, the food was very good. My absolute favorite dish is the Pork Spare-ribs. All the sauces are good, but the Black Bean sauce is exceptional. I had it parcelled, to be had at home almost 2 hours later, and it was still as good. The staff here are extremely patient and welcoming, so even if you spend hours chatting, I hardly think they are going to mind. In short, when you are in the mood for Chinese food like they make it in Chinatown, but don't want to travel all the way to Tangra, this place can a pretty good alternative.

Quite a decent Chinese restaurant. I have been here quite a number of times. The service is slow but sweet. I remember my friends spending almost 4 hours at this one place chitchatting or ordering one dish at a time till I arrived for lunch and finally the placed the order. No matter how embarrassing this story is, it tells a lot about the patience of the staff. 

Coming to food, it is pretty basic here. The sizzler that sizzles perfectly could be a tad too sweet at times. Avoid it and go for other chicken items. There are no specific starters or main course here so you can just select what to have as what and they would pile up all the food together on your table.

The pork hakka chowmein, garlic noodles are perfectly made always. There is very little choice in the veg section. A have only tried the vegetable spring roll from the veg section and it tasted better than what I expected. They have recently changed their menu and added whole fish, clay pot fish in their menu which I am yet to try.

Quantity wise this place is good. A plate of friend rice or noodles with a side dish easily serves 2 people. The friend chicken items, which you can order as starter would impress you. The lighting might seem too dim at times and they ac-s don't work properly most of the times.

The prices are pocket friendly and vat is not charged. Finding the place could be a little difficult but a must visit if one wants to taste good Chinese from here, there and everywhere :)

Nu Wan Li,a restaurant,whose location is to an extent repulsive,but once you are inside,their food will not only touch your tummy but also your soul, while sparing your pocket,surprisingly.Well,there is an idiom,don't judge a book by its cover,right?I,being a regular there,can happily recommend them to you,and will also suggest to try their Mix/Chicken Gravy Noodles,specially,once it hit your tongue flavors will explode in your mouth.They offer dishes all of which are quintessentially Chinese and blissfully lip-smacking,serve fast and with a smile.It is much better a take away than a dine-in though,food quantities are colossal and price unbelievably reasonable.

Reminds me of the old chinese family run establishments that did some solid cooking, had gigantic portions served with indulgence and service came with a polite smile. Food tastes to provide comfort to the soul. Maybe the non descript and unusual location is a blessing to keep the place as it is, providing the neo foodies reason to stay away. Good for take aways as well as a suddenly stolen eating out dinner urge. I'm all out for this place.

A great place to have lunch or dinner at tight budget. Whenever possible ask the waiters about the details of the specifications so you don't end having two dishes with similar preparation. Although the place is small the food is excellent and quality is well maintained with quantity. Happy fooding.

Nu wan li is another restaurant which appears uninviting on first sight. Once inside the decor is not highly oriental either. But when it comes to food, it serves exquisite chinese delicacies. We usually go for the rice noodles, although the fried rice is equally good. Manchurian chicken dry is probably my favourite here. Also the chicken in black bean sauce is a must try. All the dishes have a very original flavour which we relish very much. Servings are handsome and plentiful. The waiters are polite and service is prompt and decent. On all the occasions iv been here, iv thoroughly enjoyed the food. Looking forward to more merry munching at nu wan li.

Nu Wan Li, is one of those restaurants that can't be noticed from the outside, but once you are inside, you feel as if you not in kolkata anymore. From the paintings and the decor they have done their best to give you an authentic Chinese experience. The food quantity and quality is extremely good. If you visit this restaurant once you are liable to go back again. The staff are friendly and the ambience is nice. The only negative point is the cramped space inside.

From outside it look like an average chinese restaurant, but when me and my friend went there for the first time,  it was suprisingly above our expectation. the ambiance was great, a full feeling of china, decent place to come often. food quantites a huge because three of us friend digged into a plate of gravy noodles n a plate of momos and we were filled and quality is also nice, its a.c and keeping in mind of all these the price is reasonable.
So i suggest if anyone near hazra road feels of having chinese delicacies, do visit here.
p.s - i must say that i was little disapointed because i expected soup along with the momos.

Even though located right at Hazra Road, not many people know about Nu Wan Li. From outside, the place looks avoidable but the insides have a surprisingly good oriental decor. The ambiance could have been much better if they would care to look at the lighting and other aspects of it, but it's unfair to expect so much from a budget eatery like this.

Contrary to my fellow reviewer's experience, I found the service to be painfully slow and we always prefer the take away route. But food is what always draws us back again. I have had some great chop-suey and manchurian at this place and the chilly garlic noodle should be an absolute delight for anyone who is into extremely spicy food. The oil quantity is balanced and the servings are huge (1 plate of chow-mein plus 1 plate machurian should be enough for 2 young lads!). 

Prices are fair! The only thing that might stop me from revisiting after a few times is the limited veg. options.

A lot of people rate this place very highly for the food, but I would like to commend the owners and staff who always make our visits, whether to dine there or just to take-away food, just a little extra pleasant. 
Helpful suggestions on servings, attentive service - small things like covering a bowl of noodles so it doesn't get cold, and even an instance of a bespoke dish prepared for us make this our favourite Chinese restaurants.
If you judge this place by its looks, you are sure to be pleasantly surprised.

My personal favourites on the menu are the Oriental Chicken/Prawn Stick, Shanghai Fried Rice, and the Pork Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce.

Definitely try it out if you would like some really good Chinese food, with great service and at a fairly reasonable price.

Another good Chinese restaurant in South Kolkata. Not many people have heard about this place but this one is seriously a good place with reasonable pricing. All the popular Chinese dishes like babycorn, momo, hakka noodles, fried rice etc etc are all well prepared. 
The staff are a bit inexperienced but gradually I feel they'l improve as they attend more people, but yes they are cordial and that's really what matters. 
The pricing is very affordable and you won't mind paying and visiting this place very often. 
Overall I was satisfied and enjoyed my meal and shall rate it 4 without any hesitation.

Nu Wan Li is a good chinese outlet...once I had taken away food from here. Staff are well-behaved and ambience is okay kind of. The food is really very tasty and scrumptious. The hcicken Sweet Corn Soup and thai Soup are really very tasty, the ginger prawn and manchurian prawn are also very delectable. For dinner, mixed noodles nd chicken drumsticks can be good choices. Overall a good outlet for chinese food.
3.5 from me.

Nu Wan Li is more of a takeaway joint for me rather than a dine-in. What I have always been attracted to them for is the portion size versus price. A plate of chilli chicken, big enough to feed four people is just about 150/- and the prices were even lower a few days ago. Lately they have introduced a few new items, which are separate from their normal Kolkata Chinese fare, and albeit tasty, I personally have no reason to eat that twice.

There seem to be a misapprehension about a few dishes- well, tried the chicken sizzler once, and it was nice but nothing to write home about. In fact, quite avoidable in my books. 

For me, it is always going to be an order where I get the Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles (I love heat), Pork fried rice (okay, ask about the freshness of pork or availability and strictly tell them that you don't want too much fat, otherwise it will be swimming in fat). The pork button mushroom veg and garlic pork are well done, and tastes good. What I also order quite frequently is the Thai Soup and Chicken Button Mushroom Soup, avoiding the crab one as they have a tendency to overcook the crabmeat and sometimes the soup has bits of shell remaining in it.

Overall, I do like the place, but more so for a takeout, as I am not too happy with the hygiene or the service, which, albeit fast, can be quite rude.

LOOKS CAN BE DECEPTIVE FOR NU WAN LI!

The outside of the restaurant might drive away potential diners but the food will definitely win hearts. The moment you enter the place you are bound to undergo a change in your perception and attitude. With regards to the food quality, this is one of the very few places that offers authentic Tangra style Chinese food. They serve up good quality food at overwhelming amounts. So, it would be in your interest to order as much as you can eat. The service is always without delay. Every dish is at your table within ten to fifteen minutes of placing the order. Dining at the restaurant is always a pleasant surprise and depends on you venturing in with an open mind.

They have two kinds of menus; while one is the chefs special, the other is the normal menu. Some of their popular and well cooked dishes from the special menu are whole fish in black bean sauce, all their clay pot items (like  clay pot chicken in Hunan sauce,  double mushroom clay pot prawn in oyster sauce and chicken in hoi sin sauce), and last but not the least, their chicken sizzler. The taste of the Hunan chicken is one of tanginess and less of spiciness. The chicken sizzler is well seasoned and the vegetables that come with it are crunchy. Other items to be had are chicken shrimp fried rice, chicken shrimp chilli garlic noodle and chicken rice noodles. The quantity of noodle served per plate is overwhelming. The noodles are well made and full of flavor, and are enough for three people! All in all, the food is light not only on the tummy but also on the wallet as well. Nu Wan Li is definitely a good pocket friendly Chinese eatery in the south Kolkata area.

Service was very prompt. Every dish was served to us within 10 minutes of placing the order.
     The other food stuff that we ordered was Chicken Rice Noodles(Rs 95/- a plate), Hunan Chicken in Clay Pot( Rs 130/-) and a Chicken Sizzler(Rs 140/-). The quantity served per plate was quite a bit. The bowl of noodles sufficed for the three of us and the Noodles had a fine, non-sticky texture and it was well flavoured. The Hunan Chicken was not very spicy and and it had a sweet and sour flavour to it. The Chicken Sizzler was  well seasoned and the vegetables served with it were crunchy and. Amongst all this, we must add, even though everything tasted great, it had the same effect on the palate. It was a little monotonous, yet enjoyable.

Located on Hazra Road.... the outside of the Restaurant is slightly dingy.... but once you cross that barrier....the ambience inside is quite good (Chaltah Hai)....they have two menu's...one is chefs spcl and the normal one.....we tried many delicacies..out of that I loved the Chicken Sizzler very much and the clay pot in hunan sauce....!! Provides genuine chinese dishes...with good quality and quantity , taste and prompt service at cheap price....!! Loved the place... :))

I discovered Wan Li while browsing Zomato. From the reviews I saw I felt it necessary to try this place. Drove by the place once and realised it would be an error to dine in. So I decided to ordered Home Delivery. The delivery was very prompt. I ordered a Chicken & Shrimp Fried Rice, Chicken & Shrimp Chilli Garlic Noodles, Oriental Prawn Sticks, Double Mushroom Clay Pot Prawns in Oyster Sauce and Chicken in Hoisin Sauce. The quantities were overwhelming and the quality was good. The only two negatives I found were that the Oriental Prawn Sticks were too dry and a tad tasteless; and the Double Mushroom Clay Pot Prawns in Oyster Sauce, although delicious, lacked the predominant taste of Oyster Sauce. 

That apart, I enjoyed the food, which was great on the palate, easy on the tummy and extremely light on the wallet.

Placed contiguously to a grocery shop, a car repairing garage, and a not so clean radius, this restaurant will probably not be able to attract your attention. However, after the initial 'lets just skip this place' phase, if you do go in, I assure you, you wont be disappointed. 
After you go in, you will experience a sudden change in your attitude. It is because of the aberration between what you expected and what you get. The ambiance will not blow you off, but definitely much better than the outside suggests. 
Now for the Food part(quantity). The prices here are moderate. Not excessively high, but not very low either. But there's a catch to that. The amount of food served is equivalent to 1 and a half serving (or at times even 2), meaning 1 plate is enough for 1 and a half persons. 
Food part(quality): The quality of the food is very good, and it is one of the very very few places in Kolkata where you get semi-authentic chinese food at this price. If one has to draw a close resemblance, it would most probably be the Tangra food.
Service: On normal days, the service is pretty good, and you don't have to wait that much. They have only 3 waiters, with one being always busy with home delivery service that they offer. But on festival days (like Durga Puja), the service goes down a bit and so does the quality of the food. This is most probably related to the less number of staff. 
Personal recommendations: They have two menus, the normal menu and the chef special menu. The whole fish in black bean sauce is very very good. I havent had the chance to try out the whole of the chef special, but I'm guessing that most of them will be good. Also the chinese clay pots are really nice. Do not try the sizzlers simply because I find no point in going to a chinese restaurant and missing out on all the flavours that they have to offer, but that's a personal recommendation.
Foot note: It is not a very big place. A rather small place as compared to the length of this review. Go without expecting much, and you will be pleasantly surprised. Be wary of the quantity, because you end up ordering more than you can eat (that is what happened to us).
I remember a cold rainy night, me and my girlfriend were more or less drenched, and suddenly we decided to go in. The hot soup, the noodles and everything..
