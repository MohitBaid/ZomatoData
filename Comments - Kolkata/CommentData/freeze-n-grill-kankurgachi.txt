Just happened to stumble across this place and ordered the 'My Rio'. Must say the taste of the final product was pretty outstanding. Each bite was filled with the crunch of oreo, chocolate chips and chocolate sprinkle!
It's a must try.

Nice place near kankurgachi..

Food: Visited this place quite a few times. Tried few of their signature items including the Fondue, the green pasta and various mocktails. Even ice cream rolls are available, but they are so so, not as good as Frollz. But I must say that I have become a fan of their green pasta and the fondue. Both the items are well cooked and tastes great, In addition, the quantity is also enough. Tried their Brownie with ice cream also once and that was also pretty good in comparison to the price paid. Though it is a vegetarian cafe, but the quality of food and the cheap pricing makes up for the inavailability of chicken.

Ambience: They have a live ice cream counter at the very entrance. This eats up a lot of space. Inside their is seating capacity of 8 people maximum. More chairs are sorely needed. Minimalistic decor and clean interiors is their USP. 

Service: Service is a bit lagging, but that's just because they have opened very recently and still correcting the initial glitches of running a cafe in a competitive place like Kankurgachi. However, the owners repeatedly come and ask your opinion about the food and try to make every possible arrangement as needed. Cash is preferred over card. Taxes are still not added.

Overall: I am a regular at this place. Definitely worth trying.
