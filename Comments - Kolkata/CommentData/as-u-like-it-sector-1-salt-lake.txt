Honestly, a big surprise is incomplete without a desirable cake & *as u like it* totally justifies it's name. Thanks to the great understanding & service they gave. Truly one of the best cake makers in city from the point of taste to presentation. Glad 💯

Name says it all.as WE WANTED WE GOT...EXCELLENT WORK, TASTE AND SERVICE .10 ON 10...thanks alot as u like it.superb work u made our day. Cake was yummy.keep it up.
I VISITED all de cake shop most reputed and famous ones in Kolkata like upper crust, French loaf,Mia amore they all said me we won't be able to make as u want as they had their limits n criteria set.. I then went to zomato and came across as u like it. 
And they agreed to make de way I wanted. 
I was worried as I always bought cakes from the shops I mentioned above.. I kept my fingers crossed .. 
When the cake arrived I opened de box i was delighted.. I got wat exactly I wished for.. 
N it tasted awesome..
Hence I would conclude value for money. Superb taste .great work. Excellent service and light on the pocket

I had ordered Red-Velvet cupcakes for my friend, & they were absolutely lip-smacking! Not just in taste , they looked equally tempting thanks to the garnishing and decor. Thumbs Up to the team!!

I recently had an amazing experience with 'As u like it'. I ordered a cupcake set to surprise my sister for her anniversary.. the bride and groom on the cupcakes were so cute and my sister loved the amazing surprise... the chocolate cupcakes were too delicious and I am completely a fan of Tanusmita now...
She is so polite and well behaved.. and it was an amazing experience for me.. I was completely amazed when she agreed to deliver so late at night..
I would completely recommend all to surely give it a try and have a truly amazing experience with As U Like it...
Thank u so much Tanusmita....

Loved it! 
Flavours? Truly amazing! 
I could'nt resist a bite!
A bite can put up a storm of flavours in your mouth, and trust me when I say that!
The handmade chocolates were amazing! Specially when it gave a strawberry shot! 
How the chocolate melts in the mouth is something which amazed me! Will sure go for more!  Hoping for more extraordinary flavours they will put up with!
