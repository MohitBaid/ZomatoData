This small place is located just below lake mall beside gate no.1 of lake market. We went shopping today...so after being tired and hungry we decided to give it a try since it had been suggested by one my aunts. We ordered veg momo- 5 pieces not so big, filling was of cabbage and onion as usual.. tasted bland..soup was not very good...they charged 50 bucks for this kind of momo. My mom ordered kulfi. It's was "fine" at the best. Service was quick. No proper seating arrangement.

A quaint little joint just at the lane adjacent to lake mall. A place to have a quick bite in between shopping. It serves momos and ice creams. It sells kulfis at certain times as well. The food is just average nothing to mention in particular.

A rain soaked evening..stuck up at Lake mall...decided to nibble on some snacks to pass away time. The menu given in Zomato is not all..there are many other options of kebabs, tikias, etc. Just little more than a street food stall in a strategic location. Food quality pretty average...almost no seating...

A very ordinary place, located in Lake Mall beside the side exit of the Mall. It is a small place with no seating inside....They have a few chairs outside where customers can sit if they so desire. Had the veg momo here but it wasn't at all good. The outer covering became almost rubbery and hard and filling was too less. They also have a stock of cold drinks etc.

A small take away counter located at Lake Mall is mainly serving Indian and mughlai items in their offerings.

While being at my aunt's place nearby I went and grab some fish fry and rolls from here. Prices are decent and quality is standard. Rolls tasted average but the fish fry was really tasty with original bhetki in it.  Quite liked it their fast service as well.
