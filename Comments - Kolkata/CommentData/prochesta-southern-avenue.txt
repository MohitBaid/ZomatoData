a very good place indeed . opted for a home delivery of two combo meals . 1 veg rice with paneer combo which had a decent amount of gravy in it and three big sized paneer cubes . taste was good. rice was awesome at such a low price . the other thing was chicken rice with 4 very small pieces of chicken kebab and it was served with chilly chicken which was very delicious . another thing that was ordered was one plate of chicken steamed momo . 6 large sized momos came with a good amount of stuffing inside it , which was served with chicken soup and a very spicy sauce . momos were the most delicious of all. i would like to mention that the chicken soup which came as complimentary is not the thing which you get at roadside momo stalls. it was of a good quality and tasted yummy . pocket friendly shop . a must try.

Nice place anf cheap as well.  Situated in Lake avenue.  Run by a middle aged couple... All their dishes are too spicy i used to order for our house parties.  
Chicken lollipop is good and tasty as well. No proper sitting arrangement in the evening u can sit outside in plastic chairs

There was a time when food delivery apps were not there. There was a time when zomato online order was not there. There was a time when you have to get your own food, if you want to have it at home. There was a time, when you prefer to sit on a plastic chair by the roadside to have a roll or a plate of chowmein. Prochesta has been serving since then.
Located at the back side of the Southern Avenue, near Karma gym, this is a place that has been maintaining the quality and standard of food throughout. Your food is taken due care till it tickles your tastebuds. A small yet cosy place, some cordial stuff to get you the best food.
Prochesta has been moulding itself according to time. They have started roti rolls which has oil free but at the same time yummy and perfect for an evening snack. Very reasonably priced, the quantity of food is healthy. You also get combo meals to save your pocket. Chinese cuisine gets predominace here. They have a variety of snack items. But among all, I love the Club Sandwiches made by them and also Chicken Lollipops. You hardly wait for 10 - 15 mins before you get served with lip smacking food except at peak times. 
The best part of this place is they have not changed, neither their appearence nor their quality of food. The standard of food is the USP. The lady is very courteous and has a chsrming personality. You will come back again and again to this place.
This place has been my saviour for the last 2 years. So, apart from having food at restaurants where you may get a pocket pinch, plan one day, sit with your family or friends, get food from here and enjoy the rest...i promise you, you will not be dissapointed.

Very nice place. All the dishes i tried here are awsome. Be it momos, or mayo rolls, or fried rice chilli chikchen. Since this place is near my house, i love it even more when i can get great food after walking a few steps.

My replacement of home food. Procheshta has grown and improved with each passing year. Do try the spicy little gravy chicken drumsticks and pan fried momos. Totally worth the money.

A small home eatery in the sleepy neighborhood of Lake Avenue. Prochesta is run by a family and they serve decent chinese food. 

A major plus about the food here is that it is not tad too oily or spicy, hence is safe to eat when we are bored of dosas in office! 
I have had their paneer in manchurian sauce. paneer in chill soy. The fried rice is tasty too. Another favorite is chilli mushroom dry from here. 
The portions are huge and 1 main and 1 side can fill 2 people without need to order a starter. 
Prices are very reasonable 

Overall a nice place for indian-chinese

Prochesta was a nice surprise. Had momos and soup - home delivery option at a relative's place. Really nice food.

Also saw the outlet open late at night during puja time.

Pathetic service. I used to stay across the street ( less than 100m away ) and they refused to home deliver if the order was less than 500. Food is bad and probably stale . best avoided

I ordered from Prochesta today, chose chicken gravy chowmein and chicken schezwan. While the chowmein was not bad, the schezwan chicken was a big disappointment. Calling it schezwan will be a sacrilege. In fact, it closely resembled chilly chicken, in both look and feel! They are punctual with their delivery, the food is affordable but I had to discard my schezwan chicken. What a waste!

Awesome food, good, tasty food. Serving time is very less which i consider as the best thing associated with any joint as a foodie. They not only serve quality food but in excess quantity too. My choice  of food varies every time I visit Prochesta however there is a dish which always finds it's place in the order, mouth watering Chicken Drumsticks. Yum !!!

This is right opposite to my house. Have been eating here since they opened. Small and cozy place. Really good food and great service. Recently they opened a tandoori section. Hebbi! I hope someday they have their chain of restaurants.
