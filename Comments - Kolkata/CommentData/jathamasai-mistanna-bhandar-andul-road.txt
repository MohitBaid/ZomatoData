This is one of the oldest sweet shop in danesh sheik lane as well as Howrah. Whenever we often ate there. but they lost their quality as they become older..

This is one of the oldest sweetmeat shop in this locality and actually there's nothing much to say.... This is a regular shop for buying sweets and that's it....

One of the oldest Mishti shop of D. S. Lane- B. Garden area.
Serves various kinds of mishti, but with time it has lost it's charm. There are other outlets of Jathamasi in B. Garden too.
Nothing special to talk about them, just an average sweet shop with average service.
If I am not wrong, this still one of the best in that area.

Best 'misti doi'. 'kalakad' seemed to be made from yesterday's 'chena'. Gulab jamun and mango falvoured rasgullas are also good here. Recommended.

Even about 10 to 15 years ago it was a brand name.. located Opposite Danesh sk lane bus stop nd Penguin..it has lost most of its charm, taste..At present I would advice better u should try at least one or two sweets first then buy..
