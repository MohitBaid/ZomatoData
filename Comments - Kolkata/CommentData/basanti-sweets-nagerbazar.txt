Sweets are excellent. This is probably the best sweet shop in our locality. There best according to me is Doodh Puli. Awesome taste. There Kaju-pista sondesh and misti dahi are also good. Stuffs need to little more cordial.

Hair string within a sweet. Proves once again that how unhygienic the food items are ¬†whether it is bought from the most renowned shop even. This shop owners take everything for granted and do not care to abide by the minimum rules of hygiene and cleanliness while preparing an item like a sweet. It is really alarming.

Yes this place is nice and serves varieties of sweets but it is slightly overrated. The price is high and it is nothing extraordinary. 

The rosogollas are chewy. I find them tasteless. 

The Mango Doi is very nice. And so is the Shada Mishtir Doi (its not available all the time. One needs to order it beforehand). 

The Chocolate Sondesh is blah. It's more sondesh and less chocolate.

Many a times have their sweets whenever I visit a friend a who lives nearby. 
Their sweets have always been satisfactory enough for my palate and have been good choices for dessert after a Bengali meal, or whenever I felt like dropping by just for some sweetmeats to take back home.

This sweet shop is located at the Motijheel Bus Stop near Nager-bazar. Every time while visiting my uncle's place, I'd make sure to buy sweets from this shop. Although the price is on the higher side, the quality of their sweets is worth mentioning.

Quality sweets but lacks consistency. Sometimes it's excellent other times below par. But on average it is one of the nicest sweet shop in the locality. The other branch at Motijheel, Nagerbazar is slightly better than this one.

Not sure why, but this shop sells overly priced sweets. It's not that the quality of the sweets are that outstanding. I guess it's just a hype or they have got some brand name kind of thing.

This small sweet shop is located on dumdum road. One can easily locate this shop on his left side while traveling toward dumdum station. Packed some sandesh from this place few days back. They do not mention the names, but I really liked the taste. Will visit again.

The soft jaggery laced sweets - all typed of sandesh and naram paak is crazily good
They grew from strength to strength from a shop who ran their business to a shop who was the number one on dumdum rd. They have a good variety - kamala bhog one of the high end items. More sweet tooth !

This is one of the best sweet shops in Dum Dum.
I used to go for a tuition near Motijheel and often visited this place for rosogolla. They are really tasty.
They boast of their sour curd but it is not that good.

Basanti sweets has become a very renowned sweet shop in the last half decade. Almost all their sweets are top notch and they won an award for their rosogolla from times food too. Do try their rosogolla and misti doi.

First of all some information is given wrong on Zomato like timings. This place has  become heavenly good over the years. The rosogollas are one of the best. So is the rashmalai. The kachagolas are something I just adore. And their sandesh are also very good. Overall you want sweets in dum dum. This is the place to be. But then the tok doi is hardly tok. And their ghee is not up to the mark.
