a roadside eatery joint like any other place which every locality has, small and shabby having 2-3 tables, except that they serve good biryani at a low cost. chicken biryani is Rs. 70 and mutton Rs. 80. we normally take a parcel. quantity is also good.

The biryani they make..is really very light interms of having..I can assure the new eaters..that they will not suffer from indigetion lyk problems after having this briyani...I think Parivar Biryani must introduce variations in there side dishes..else..everything is gud..kp it up.! :)
