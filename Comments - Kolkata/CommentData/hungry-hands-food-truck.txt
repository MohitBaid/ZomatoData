Yet another food truck on one of the busiest roads of South Kolkata; this food truck parks near Lake Mall at Lake Market. The menu is fairly simple; clearly the owners weren't out to provide any exotic cuisine to the customers. That's not bad though. I sampled the chicken pasta in red sauce and carried out a packet of chicken noodles and chilli chicken. First, let's talk about the pasta. It was spicy, not to the extent of burning your lips, but actually spicier than options available at other joints serving pasta with red sauce. However, I'm not complaining, since it tasted quite nice. However, my gripe would be with the cheese used. They use cheese slices, so there's an un-even distribution of cheese and taste. Please sprinkle cheese and do not use slices. 
The noodles were normal, just like home cooked stuff. The chilli chicken was also decent. 
Hygiene can be an issue, since they are cooking out in the open and that part of the city will anyday register a higher pollution index than say a quiet locality. However, these guys try to be as clean and hygienic as possible. 
Btw...the owner is a young man and quite friendly:)

Hungry Hands is a food truck which can be seen in front of Lake Mall during the evening hours. They seve various kinds of dishes. I went there last month while coming back from Gariahat. We saw this food truck and decuded to give it a try. We ordered chicken chowmein and chilli chicken combo. There were two to three tools. We sat on them. The kitchen inside looked good to me. The owners was making food boxes and was applying zomato stickers on them. Our food arrived after ten minutes. The chowmein was delicious. It was properly made. The chilli chicken was also tasty. The meat balls were dainty, they were properly fried. We loved the meal. I wanted to visit again, but could not find the truck again.
