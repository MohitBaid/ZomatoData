If you r a school/college student and wish to take your girl/boy on a date in Barrackpore without hitting hard on your pocket then THIS IS IT.  Located on the 3rd floor this small cafe gives you a beautiful view and cool breezy atmosphere with romantic music playing in the background. My favourite has always been the pasta( red/white ) sauce whichever you prefer. The pasta is a must try when you are here.

Good place to spend time with friends or partner. Food quality is not bad. This is just opposite side of Barrackpore railway station, platform no. 1.

It is situated just near the barrackporeÂ railway station.i think it is the one and only cafeteria in barrackporeÂ where u can spend a lot of time with your friends with a single cup of coffee..the interior is good and well decorated..the food is a little bit expensive..and most of the foods of the menu card are not available.i ordered tea and fish batter fry.but i was told that no preparation of fish is available .and Â they took a lot of time to serve the food..whateverÂ the food was good in taste which made me pleaseÂ inspite of these disadvantages..

Visited this place with some friends for a birthday treat from one of my friend. Earlier visited here on the day of Saraswati pujo. The space is large with well sitting arrangements. Now they have renovated their menu including Chinese as well as snacks. The most interesting among them is the combo packs of various types of fried rice and chilli chicken along with coffee. They have been also offering happy hours special 10% discount between 12pm to 4pm. We ordered two combo packs of mixed rice and one Chicken drums of heaven. The combo pack was really value for money and tasted good also. I liked most the drums of heaven as it was simply yummy. Quality and quantity both was satisfactory. I am attaching their new menu below. Visiting again soon.! :)

Had the potential but when you serve sandwich 2hrs after a cold coffee ( both were ordered together ) you have fracked it up bad my friend .

The only cafe at Barrackpore...just in front of barrackpore station.Situated at 3rd floor and the top floor of the building,location wise the place is pretty good and it has full view of barrackpore station and consisting compound area.
Interior is very basic..though they claims of free wifi but it never connects.

Though it's an coffee shop but they serves very average coffee.
The only thing I like over there is their grilled cheese chicken sandwich and crispy chicken. 
And even the menus are very basic and needs improvement.Mostly they serve snacks but still it lacks in variety and innovativeness.

Though they have AC but they don't turn it on. (I am curious about it..why on earth they have  installed it anyway.. Lol)
Price is reasonable and service is rather slow.

Its just that Adda cafe is the only place to hangout at Barrackpore we opt their often. 
But still it needs to upgrade their interior and menu's.
Still I would say it's a good place to chill with friends until and unless we get a new one. ðŸ˜œ

Only coffee shop at barrackpore. Great location. So spacious too. Almost visited there every month till its opening. But I think it needs to upgrade its variety of snacks and coffee... After all the FOOD matters the most at any food shop... And also smoking zone should be initiated .
