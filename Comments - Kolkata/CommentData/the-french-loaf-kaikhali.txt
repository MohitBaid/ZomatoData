I like the way they treat their customer. More concern about accuracy and ensure they deliver quality product. Been to their store couple of time and everytime I was impressed with their staff. 
Also they are very prompt in delivering my orders well in time. 
Keep up the good job guys..

Worst experience ever. Took them "40min" to deliver a cake that was pre-ordered 24hrs before hand. Outlet is poorly under-staffed. DO NOT VISIT IN THE EVENINGS, specially on a saturday. I used to be found of their cakes, but after this incident i don't want to visit this outlet ever again.

Cool little place. Their packed muffins are my favourite. 
Situated right beside my college. Their pastries are really amazing! Do try the choco lava cake once. You'll be thrilled!
