We went there on friday...had fish finger, chicken tikka kebabs and booze,yeah it seems to be on a higher side for pricing, but the dishes are very delicious and the staffs are courteous. The only issue we faced was air conditioning , it was beyond acceptably warm inside. We had to rush due to this. Apart from this, everything was nice.

Elfin is an age old Bar located at Chandni Chowk just opposite to Sagar Restaurant on Meredith Street..This is one of those sleazy places which basically caters the need of middle aged obsessed and perverted individuals..A strict no for any family visit..This is a Dance bar where you will find some sleazy half-dressed girls dancing to masala hindi tunes and some real crappy people actually showering notes on this girls while they perform according to their requests..just horrible it is..Also the upstair has a Choir performing and making too loud a noise..Honestly speaking we felt so embarrased and uncanny around such dark crowd we left hurriedly without even finishing our beer properly..Coming to the food it is nice, serves decent starters and Indian spreads, however all the items are way too over-priced..A bottle of Budweiser will cost you around Rs.300/- here..such exorbitant pricing.. We ordered 2 Budweiser, 1 chicken pakoda, 1 fish tikka..Only for these our total cheque comes to Rs.1000/-!!! Way too high for a place like this.. also keep an eye on the servers, they are looking for a way to charge you extra once you are intoxicated ..On the whole don't visit this place unless you have some private desires..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 1/5
Service: 1/5
Ambiance: 1/5

I am going to Elfin since i was a child...In the early 80s till its end it was a decent place to visit with ur family..Now the crowd has totally changed..moreover they have started orchestra at their 1st floor...dont make any objection for smoking inside..
I loved the Gold Coin apple juice which i had always in my childhood days.. north indian food are tasty n reasonably cheap.

I went to elfin for the first time 4-5 years ago an from that day elfin is one of my favorite restaurants in kolkata. This is where you can drink and smoke simultaneously ! Yes, there is no objection for smoking :-) 
Now let us come to the menu. The alcohols are sold in reasonable price with a great free chaats. The snacks items specially tandoor and kabab items are very good over here. The ambiance is also nice and silent.
If you need a break from your daily busy schedule and you can afford two hours, come here, you will be refreshed. From my end, A THUMBS UP FOR ELFIN.
