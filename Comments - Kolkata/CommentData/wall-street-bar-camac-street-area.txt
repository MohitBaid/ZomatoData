Conveniently located,  this place is easy to find on Shakespeare Sarani near kelinworth Hotel. Food , Service & Music is decent. Price as well is not on much higher side. Good place to spend quality time with friends amidst the positive vibes here...

This place has dissapointed me to a great extent. Firstly as we entered there was no one at the reception, then we saw a lady, we proceeded towards the entry, lots of doors in the way with no markings, there was a smoking room which was being used like a store. On a Saturday night there was no Dj. The entire place was empty, with the only people loitering around were the chef, a guy in white shirt and sport shoes, and few casual mannered service boys.
We got ourself seated and the lady on the reception now enters the DJ booth and starts playing a few tracks from 2012s. I placed my order for a teacher's 50 and was inform by the service boy, " Ye nahin milega Highland milega" so I shifted towards beer, after a few denials on what's in stock and what's not I asked him only what all is available, He replied Budweiser hoga, Corona hoga Aur Bira hoga. And I managed to place an order for a Bud and a teen pan rose Hookah.
A can of Budweiser reached by table and just two minutes later the guy is white shirt came running and said sir this is for 500 rupees a can, do u want it. On any other day I wouldn't have bought a seriously overpriced can of Budweiser for 500 but as it had reached my table I said that it's OK!
Now one of the service boys I think was exceptionally happy seeing a customer decided to take charge of the DJ console, so he replaced the poor lady who was trying her best, yet failing and decided to turn the volume up by a good scale. This made me realise that though they do have around 2 pairs of mismatched active speakers the speakers at my back clearly overpowered the ones in front and created a very poor acoustic experience.
Though we had gone with the aim of ordering food, enjoying music and getting drunk I shortened my stay there due to the not so perfect environment.
In the meantime I also managed to spot a few spider webs on the wall where I was sitting, a service boy drinking water roaming on floor, the guy in white pushing the straw into one of the customers Liit before it was being picked up and tasting it on the floor.
We asked for the cheque and realised there is nothing this team can do perfectly as they added a random food item in my bill, on correcting they cut the amount with a pen and wrote the new amount.
Overall experience was not smooth therefore, there was a lot of casualness among the staff, there weren't bouncers on floor, drinks were expensive & the place lacked vibe.

It's highly disappointing place. The Menu shown on zomato and the menu available at the place are entirely different. The place is too shady and  unnecessarily expensive accompanied with poor service and horrible food to add to your disappointment. Don't waste your money on such pathetic places.

As per experience goes most expensive outlet. They force you to have higher and expensive drinks. When you are engrossed within your party mood they indulge you to take more drinks where you lose the count of the number of pegs ordered and land up paying higher. I will not recommend to party lovers.

Good ambience, polite staff and good selection of music.
The food could have been better because spicy chicken ball was like manchurian.
The pasta, they did not ask if one wants al dante or cooked they served al dante, the sizzler was dry it could use some sauce.
They did not have half the things from the non-veg appetizer menu.
On drinks, we ordered LIIT and whiskey.

The food could be better in comparison to will it costed and also the quantity served wasn't that great either
I wouldn't suggest this place for the food but would definitely suggest it for the drinks and to Have a nice time with friends.

The City of Joy has seen a lot of creativity and experimentation in the recent months in terms of Gastronomy. One of these places is the Wall Street Bar at Shakespeare Sarani. True to its name, derived from the famous Financial Street of New York, this new lounge has been hustling with people. Dimly lit, this space is the landmark of entertainment with the cuisines like Chinese, Continental, Italian, Burmese specializing in Italian and Burmese. 
Recommended dishes:
Thai Curry,
Khao Suey,
Momos,
Baked Wontons with Pocket Cheese,
Mexican Rice Sizzler in veg and Ginger
Chicken Strips,
Cranberry Barbeque Chicken Balls,
Mexican Grilled Chicken Tacos,¬†
Dahi Murg on Skewers,
Bhetki Cupcakes,
Rum BBQ Chicken,
Bhuna Masala Chicken Wigs served with burnt garlic rice

I particularly loved the Bhetki Cupcakes and the Chicken strips.

They also have some great options in their beverage menu. I would recommend the Five Tonic Tea, one of their in-house drinks, a lovely variation of the Long Island Iced Tea.

3. Value for money . 
4. Has a good Resident DJ over here, which will make you want to dance to the EDM's. 
5. Great Hookah being served here.

Recently visited Wall Street Bar during my short Kolkata trip. I must say the place is good for hanging out with a bunch of friends. However food is strictly mediocre with decent service time. The music was good enough, but if you don‚Äôt like loud music then this might not be the best place for you.

Been to this place a couple of times so thought of sharing my experience with you all. Guys this is one of the best place in theatre road infact my favourite.. This place is always up with  amazing music and plays for each category of its customers be it slowmo, english, nostalgic old music, remixes etc etc.

As per me this is something which makes it different from other places because u visit any time here in the evening n i bet you will be charged up with your mood..

Again not only the ambience and music but also they serve a good quality food with good staff service which allows you to enjoy the place and food on your table timely.
This place gives you the worth for your price paid towards their service.

WSB seems to be the new party spot in the town.Situated nearby AC market it's hard to miss the WSB neon logo. They offer valet parking too.
Tge pub is located on the first floor .
Low light, blazing music, full bar, bar stools ,a giant screen gives u the perfect ambience for a rocking party night.
The drinks price are a bit on the higher side.Hookah is the most common item with all tables almost having one.
We went on a group of 13 and it was a grand treat if some of our beloved seniors, so we had almost 30‚ÑÖ of all. The cocktails were super cool so were the foods items
Veg lasagna, non veg lasagna, Ginger chicken strips, Indian kabab platter, non veg kabab platter , Mexican grilled chicken tacos, Mexican rice sizzler, Marguerite pizza,,rum Bbq chicken were some of the many items we had.
The waiter was too courteous and friendly .

The only con which I felt they don't have a separate dance floor, yes we danced in the middle where there are a few chairs but a dance floor was totally needed to complete the feel.
Nevertheless an awesome super cool place to chill out.

This had been on my bucket list for quite sometime and when i actually landed up there I was a little disappointed. Firstly for drinks we had ordered, an Expresso Martini and a Classic Mojito. The former was a total disaster and was a waste because I couldn't finish it off. The hookah was really good...!!! The food on the other hand was okay-ish. But i will give this place a 4 for the kind of music that they have been playing..!! Kudos to that!

Really feel this is one of the underrated places, given the food they serve and the choice of songs they play, which totally get you in the mood to party and make your evening worthwhile. Since, the concept is that of a gastropub, its better to visit late evenings, as I had done so and was extremely taken aback with the party that happens there, which was way too happening. The garlic noodles are a must try.

This place is very easy to locate if we enter from the maidan side as it is situated near the Astor hotel. The ambience is the eye catcher with quirky quotes at the walls of the entrance. Its a great place to hangout and chill with your friends due to the convenient happy hours and i.e. from 5pm-8pm. A wide range of drinks are available. Though any chicken item was not available on our day of arrival. We had margarita pizza and fish and chills. The cocktails are the real treat to the taste buds. The waiters are very friendly and helpful too. A must go .

This bar is located in Camac Street. I went their with a school friend, who was in town , for lunch so we just went for drinks and nothing else. 

Decor : Coming to the place it's dimly lit and is very dark. It has large TV screens on walls which is why most people go there to watch matches and grab a few drinks. 

Ambience - Mostly consists of college goers and middle aged people. Though at times it can get a bit uncomfortable and over crowded. 

Food/ Drinks : We went their right after lunch so we were full to the brim. We ordered a Heiniken beer and a Cosmopolitan. Trust me this is the best Cosmopolitan I've ever tasted. My friend tried it too and loved it nonetheless. 

Pocket Pinch : It's definitely on the downside. I think it is the most reasonable bar in town. Our bill was just 600Rs with a huge bowl of complimentary cheese bites. 

PS - I would recommend them to just light up the place a bit and add some nice decor and expand the sitting area. It gets too congested at times. I would definitely visit this place again to try out their food menu. I highly recommend this place to one and all.

This place is located near AC market and is easily spotted by anyone passing through Shakespeare Sarani. The WSB logo stands out , so you can't miss this place . They offer valet parking service, and once you're inside, you have to take the lift to the pub. The interiors of this place are low lit ,warm, and have a perfect pub - appeal ! The walls have posters with interesting slogans that will keep you thinking long after you're drunk!!! They also have a giant screen where you can watch sports on a match day . The hookah seems to be a popular item on the menu , with almost everyone smoking shisha around you, including the DJ himself ! The music here is a tad loud for conversation, but if you're in to just chill and rock your body to some peppy numbers , then this is the place for you . The crowd here is nice . The service is impeccable, with every attention paid to whether you need a change of plates , an extra glass , or just tissue . They serve cocktails and liquor with equal promptness. The Caipirinha they serve was too sweet for my taste. So was the long island iced tea. The spicy fried calamari tasted good . The spicy pesto pizza tasted bland , but was served hot on  wooden pizza plate . They have a separate room for smoking which is very tiny , but smoking anything  inside other than hookah is prohibited. Overall, a nice place to spend your weekend evenings .

Normally this is a go-to-place, but somehow because today was Champions Trophy final, the quantity that is normally served, was not what it was today.
Cheese fondue was really not carrying the depth that it is known for. And garlic bread was really tasteless. 
Yet, being a favoured patron, the guys were co-operative, which is what you yearn for.

We took suggestions from them regarding hookah it was amazing and smooth and ordered 2 pint Carlsberg which was pretty chilled and they provided complementary cheeselets which were continuasly refilled by them..The ambience and list of songs played was pretty soothing and light..
Then we ordered Classic Cosmopolitan which was an amazing cocktail...1 of the best I had in Kolkata..
Could not try out the food as we were fool.. but would definitely love to try again..

Since I'd gone with my vegetarian friends, I didn't try out the non vegetarian stuff, but the vegetarians will be happy. I found the pizza okay tasting. I liked the drinks, they were refreshing. 
The place isn't cheap so bear that in mind. Overall, a good outing!

Good music, easily accessible location. A bit pricy though. Pocket pinch around 2.5k+ for 3 people.

Wall street is quite a happening place that can turn around an otherwise boring summer evening into a fun filled one.I landed up here last sunday evening with my friends.The entrance is kind of confusing but there were quite a few staff outside to guide us inside.As I entered the dimly lit corridor the bright logo behind the front desk is quite eye catching.We were attended to our table which was just beside the bar.The decor is nice with seating arrangements ranging from couches to high tables.The place is not very big but it gives a good vibe. The staff is polite and attentive keeping an eye on every table.We ordered a tower of beer, lit and a martini.They have some  offers going on during the weekend.The drinks were good having ample amount of alcohol in them but the second batch of mojito and martinis were a little on the lighter side. Being a hookah lover how could I miss the wide variety on offer.We decided to have a kiwi gum in ice base which has a light taste but strong enough to give you a high.Coming to the food our server suggested us  to order the non veg platter. The taste was good but the quantity is quite less compared to other pubs in town.We ordered non veg nachos and a rum bbq chicken pizza (this was the only chicken pizza available).The nachos were hot and crispy but lacked flavour in the kidney beans.I.have had better nachos so I would not suggest it.The rum bbq chicken pizza had 8pieces and was decent enough for a thin crust .The ambience is quite chilling but the DJ deserves a special mention.We were blown away with not only his playlist but his transition from one song to the other.Team Wall Street deserves kudos for their service and ambience.

PLEASE READ THE FULL REVIEW..
I was really excited to visit the place seeing the interior decoration and all..evn when I visited the place, I was extremely satisfied. But here's the answer to my bad ratings, we ordered 2 Ceasar Salad(extremely good) 1 Chicken Noodles , 1 chicken & 1 fish Starter, 1 calamari dish. 
The food was Good basically even the stuff was ok.. The main problem was when we saw a COCKROACH on our plate of Noodles üçú I completely freaked out. Then after multiple apology by the Server,  they changed our plate as well as table. Surprisingly, evn after that as well, we saw small cockroaches moving around the table corners. I went for my birthday lunch, with my closed ones, expecting a grt experience. That turned out to be the worst lunch possible. Hope to never visit again. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.

NOTE: The sad songs they were playing was extremely disturbing. Slow version of Agar tum saath ho- Female.

Visited this place a few days ago that too fairly based on posts, all our expectations came down as we entered the place, it was almost empty. Now coming to the decor; the place is nicely decorated though, having posters, a giant screen playing modern musical videos, the 3D walls displaying a night scene of a city, good many show pieces on shelfs. Coming to the food, we ordered Veg Nachos and Hakka noodles, beer and hookah. We ordered double apple flavoured hookah, which choked really bad, we later realised that they served us gum supari,looking at the bill. Did not enjoy the DJ much.
Overall experience was quite disappointing.

Easily located.. But the entrance is in the back side of the building. The stairs leading to the seating area are designed throughout with black and yellow themed quotes and there is a small walk in a nice narrow corridor which is mostly dark. The hookah was good enough. The food was also very nice. Drinks were reasonably priced. The behaviour of the staffs are good. Good place to hang out.

For those Saturday nights
Visited the place in a group of 10 for a farewell gala. Though easily located, the entry is kind of inconspicuous. Anyways, coming to the ambience..It is average and kind of cramped. They don't have a dedicated dance floor but being a weekday we found the place vacant enough to shake a leg.
The finger food is good, especially nachos. The thin crust pizza and the fish and chips were the best.
Being a teetotaler I stuck to mocktails and they were okay. Overall, not a bad experience. And it doesn't pinch the pocket too.

I went to Wall Street Bar without much expectations on a Monday evening to catch up with a friend, and was delighted by this place! Good food, music and ambiance - you'll love it too!

Yes the entrance the behind the building, and it took us a minute to figure that out. The stairs leading to this place are branded throughout with WSB and witty quotes in their black and yellow theme and there is a small walk in a nice narrow corridor before actually reach the seating area. The space is decently large and has high rise tables and chairs. The area is well lit and the decor is once again in line with the stairs - witty quotes' portraits and paintings. Liked the ambiance. The DJ did a great job with a mix if Hindi and English songs and make the evening even better.

We had Rum BBQ Chicken Pizza, Veg Nachos and Bruschetta and all the dishes were quite good! Quantity served is good too!
Nachos were good spicy and crisp - not too hard either. Came topped with beans, cheese and salsa sauce. I would have liked them to be more cheesy though.
Bruschetta was spectacular with finely chopped onion, tomato, olives mixed with cheese on top of a crisp tasty bread slice...topped with pesto sauce! The Pesto won it for me. This Bruschetta was different than what I've had at other places, and certainly one of the best! Must try this out! With 6 pieces the quantity is good too!
We had ordered the Rum BBQ pizza based on recommendations from many Zomato reviewers and it was by far the best dish of the evening. This one is a must try as well!

In drinks we had a beer, scotch, Mojito and tequila shots. The Mojito was disappointing - tasted sweet and hardly lemony. Also it was served in a Lime Soda(tall cylindrical with narrower mouth) glass instead of the typical Mojito glass (short, fat, inverted conical shape) which reduced the appeal of the drink. The drink was strong.

Overall, we had a great time here I would gladly recommend this place to anyone :-)

Pros:
15% off on food bill if it's a birthday treat.
Good food, with proper quantity for the price. Would recommend the spicy fried chicken balls, rum barbeque pizza and baked mushrooms.
Cons:
Found a strand of hair in the veg pesto pizza and got the dish replaced with a mixed pasta.
The bar menu says 1 litre for pitchers but the quantity of the drink is definitely less than that.
IMO, the music was way too loud to enjoy the ambience.

The place is dimly lit with dj playing by the side.
The ambience is too good. The staff was very cordial and humble. I tried
1.Hakka noodles- The noodles were well prepared but it was too blant for a spice lover like me.
2.Pizza with pesto sauce- It was a thin crust pizza with the right amount of cheese. Tasted perfect with chilli flakes.
We got a 10% discount because we checked in on facebook.
Over and all a must place to visit.
Definitely going back.

Dimly lit and inordinately decorated dainty pub with cool staff. This place was a so-so visit for me.
On the good side - they had happy hours(on very selected drinks viz IMFL and IL). Food was decent enough. Big screen tv. And definitely very good hookah at a cheap price. 
Speaking of cons, firstly the smoking room was outside and drinks are not allowed there and that's a shame. The place is bit hard to locate. And they should also play some good music. 
Maybe i hit the place at a time when the jive was not that high, but i guess this place is a good place to hang out if one goes on weekend or nights. 
Cheers!

Place / Ambience : The place is handsome and the ambience is awesome with the music and blocked up Capacity.
Food - The Food quality is fit for and is equally Tasty.
Coming to the price, they have particular happy hour offers and apart from that the place is not overpriced and is considerable.
This is one place you should surely visit searching for reasonable informal drinks.
Hookah is fancy and is little pricey.
Overall the place is one of the must visit in the area.

The seating area is also ok kind of...tried out couple of snacks thin crust pizza chicken & veg both and Mojito is quite good...The music is electric and location of this place is near the metro station near Maidan Area. Would like to visit over here again in future....The warmness & cordiality of the staff is very nice... Little expensive....

I had heard a lot about this place from my friends. So picked this place for a midweek sojourn. Just to clarify the name here does not pertain to the actual Wall Street. I was of the opinion the place would be similar to Bar Stock Exchange in Mumbai but on the contrary, it was a normal gastro-pub in fact a good one with that. It was very difficult to decipher the entrance of this place as there was hardly any attendant outside. Once you enter, it takes you a minute to go through the corridors to reach the actual landing which is the bar and the seating area of the place. The place is spacious and has different seating arrangements. We got ourselves corner sofa seats. The music ¬†they play is kind of peppy and sets the mood. Apart from us, the majority of the people there seem to be college going students who were in groups of 10+ and by their voices, sounded as if they were having a good time.¬†

To start off the proceedings, we decided to order Bira as it was on the menu but got to know that they cant serve the same as they have run out of stock. Infact on enquiry, we got to know there were many items both in the food and drinks menu which they were not serving that night. Maybe they did not expect people to turn on a Wednesday. Nonetheless, we go the following:

1. Chicken Dumplings - Very good. Propoerly steamed and served with a tangy chutney/sauce
2. Rum BBQ Chicken - Pizza has become a staple when I go to places like this. Overload of cheese, but that rum flavor makes it click
3. Chicken Lasagne - The serving was huge and more than enough for 2 people.¬†

The staff was attentive and helped with the menu. The service time was apt with 1 dish being served just a moment after the last meal was done. The place had a dim lighting but that could be done for the bar area and not all the places. ¬†Overall, the food and ambience was nice. SInce there were not many people, it was good to have a conversation. Though would love to see this place on a weekend.

We just went for a casual hangout but it turned out to be a great one.üòç
The location is a bit difficult to find but once you are in you will surely like it. The staffs are very good and responsive and came to attend us immediately. The decor is being made up with lot of nice informational equipments. We ordered for two cocktails namely Cosmopolitan and Rob Roy and also for few pints of beer.
The fruitalicious shisha was also good.
The best part was the Baked Mushroom Nibble. It was cooked to perfection topped & stuffed with ricotta cheese and garnished with parsley, it literally melted in our mouth.. 
After having all these for three of us the cheque was of 3000 rupees.
It's a must try.

My first visit and not that great. It was Saturday evening and place was relatively empty. We occupied sofa seat and to our despair rat was running on it. There by we were asked to change the place and the same table was offered to other group (God bless them). Now comes to food we ordered cheese fondue and potatao and corn croquettes. Fondue was average but croquettes were only tasting of mustard oil which was no where mentioned in menu. Staff cancelled and replaced it with nachos which was average again.  Not a very interesting visit.

A lovely place to be! Its just near bk market, this restropub has a huge area covered, but space utilisation is not done properly. They could really have a nice decor and theme, but the interiors are moderately decorated and seating arrangements include couches, high stools and normal chairs plus a bar where people can sit and have their drink. 
We went a bit late on Sunday, just before the happy hour ends(so couldn't utilize the offers much) and we ordered beers,cosmopolitan, whisky sour in drinks. Now for food we had ordered only baked mushrooms as we were not hungry much. We also ordered sheesha, the complementary cheeselings were so much that we couldn't finish! All the drinks were made nicely, the baked mushrooms were well presented and very delicious! Oozing cheese and nutty flavor with perfectly soft mushroom, it was just too good.
Service was moderate with well mannered servers, the dJ was playing some really good music just perfect enough too lift up the mood and ambiance!
Definitely going back for the amazing happy hours and food!

Hi all..
Was there today.. decor is good.. simple... minimalistic but the place is very small an can get overcrowded after 30-40 people... I was alone.. had couple of beers.. jaggerbomb.. and tried their Ginger chicken strips.. which was very fresh and the chicken was very soft.. with a crispy outer.. though service was a bit late due to Saturday night and was overcrowded.. crowd is mostly of guys and a few couples.. you can find very few gals gang... this place also serves hookah... I had taken a seat at the bar.. and the bartender was very polite who prepared the jaggerbomb as per my taste and also arranged for my starter and chair... overall a decent place to have a few drinks.. but dnt think of going for clubbing as this place has no Dance floor and being small the music feels too loud to your ears because of improper amplification of the speakers... the DJ played Decent numbers... peppy and groovy...

Over all a decent place to hangout for a couple of drinks and won't hit your pocket too hard...

The ambience is really good and awesome music is played there including desi Bollywood tracks which I liked. If you are looking for food then don't go there. They serve only a few though the menu is filled up with deliciously named servings. If you are a regular liquor person this bar is perfect for you. The quality of their shots and cocktails are really up to the mark. A bit costly but worth a visit.

Absolutely horrible experience. Went there on November 4th. They are up for looting customers... We were told the prices are different due to some event, that too a "now produced beer" costed us 600( but we were okay with it). But when asked for the receipt they said it can't be given.. Imagine ..for two drinks( another was 60ml of scotch) they charged us 2000 and denied to give receipts .. That was the story in short...

Add to it there were lot of paid or gathered crowd ( believe me those people did not at all looked like club goers).. 

So it fails in every aspect to be a good pub bar or disco .. The dance floor is small, decor is okay kind .. When the floor is cleared up for dancing you would barely have 10 seats in total (you have to be pretty good in musical chair I guess) to sit in case you want to rest or just to sit (although I was not there till the time dance floor is full, so this was just a guess)..

Avoid the place if you don't want to ruin your night...

The music was pretty loud with an in-house "DJ" for such a cramped place. The food was worth it at all.
Baked Mushrooms - better off as Mushy stale watery Mushrooms,dry Aglio E Olio, Lat Mai Kai was good, Cheese Fondue was Ok, Do not recommend the Nachos at all.

Located on the 1st floor of the Shagun Mall, theatre road. No doubt this lounge has an amazing ambience, cozy seating arrangements, dimmed light like the western style lounges¬† - but food is of average quality except the mocktail. Most of the items in the menu are not available. Ordered - gandharaj basil mojito - taste was good, but the flavour was too strong. In the appetizer, had Chicken Quesadilla - which tasted just like stuffed indian parathas. Service is very very slow, but rates are reasonable.

Located just beside BK market, and opposite to Nightingale Hospital this place is very easy to find. Has a big space for parking so easy for people coming by car. 
Dimly lit, some what big place, wooden interiors makes this place a good one. Happy hours allowed us a 1:1 on the drinks. 
Pros-

‚Ä¢ We opted for crispy babycorn and it was marvellous! Crispiest ever i have tasted.. 
‚Ä¢Martini with olives was good enough. 
‚Ä¢ Smoking room has seating arrangement with very cute ashtrays. 
‚Ä¢Hookah was good and lasted really long. 
‚Ä¢ Was not at all cramped(dunno about late nights or weekends) 

Cons-
‚Ä¢ The 1:1 on the drinks was available on a very short selection of drinks. Hardly the vodka and the indian whisky. 
‚Ä¢ The drinks are not allowed to be taken to the smoking room, so it was kinda bad to make to and fro trips to the smoking zone and back to finish your drink. 
‚Ä¢ Choice of songs really not good! Some old Bollywood remix tunes were playing, though later in the evening they switched to good ones. 
Price bit on high side, but was worth it. 
Cost for 2 including food drinks and hookah came around 2000.

I tried some of their starters made with American corn which was okish... Very salty... also opted for some mocktails and cocktails... both were good... didn't remember the name... and in main course tried their chicken and egg sizzler and it was very very disgusting... the hookah was very strong... I liked it... Pocket pinch was bit on the higher side...

Nice place to have a drink post work. The ambience is good. They have tried to put the skyline as a backdrop. The service is fast too. However, went for a lime margarita and that was not well made. Could have been better.

Located on the 1st floor of the Shagun Mall, theatre road. No doubt this lounge has an amazing ambience, cozy seating arrangements, dimmed light like the western style lounges¬† - but food is of average quality except the mocktail. Most of the items in the menu are not available. Ordered - gandharaj basil mojito - taste was good, but the flavour was too strong. In the appetizer, had Chicken Quesadilla - which tasted just like stuffed indian parathas. Service is very very slow, but rates are reasonable.

Located just beside BK market, and opposite to Nightingale Hospital this place is very easy to find. Has a big space for parking so easy for people coming by car. 
Dimly lit, some what big place, wooden interiors makes this place a good one. Happy hours allowed us a 1:1 on the drinks. 
Pros-

‚Ä¢ We opted for crispy babycorn and it was marvellous! Crispiest ever i have tasted.. 
‚Ä¢Martini with olives was good enough. 
‚Ä¢ Smoking room has seating arrangement with very cute ashtrays. 
‚Ä¢Hookah was good and lasted really long. 
‚Ä¢ Was not at all cramped(dunno about late nights or weekends) 

Cons-
‚Ä¢ The 1:1 on the drinks was available on a very short selection of drinks. Hardly the vodka and the indian whisky. 
‚Ä¢ The drinks are not allowed to be taken to the smoking room, so it was kinda bad to make to and fro trips to the smoking zone and back to finish your drink. 
‚Ä¢ Choice of songs really not good! Some old Bollywood remix tunes were playing, though later in the evening they switched to good ones. 
Price bit on high side, but was worth it. 
Cost for 2 including food drinks and hookah came around 2000.

I visited this place yesterday and they charged an extra item on my bill which i haden't had notice i pay the bill and went away after sometime when i check the bill there was an extra item written on bill i went back and told them they started refusing it and said that its my fault. What type of bitchiness was that if u have done a mistake then just agree and don't repeat it with your other customer.

AMAZING is the only thing you can say about this place, be it in terms of food, drinks, hookah, ambience or service. 
The music suits the mood the light is dim lit which creates the ambience. 
Their HAPPY HOURS (4-7PM) are a really attractive deal. One must try it. ( Validity is tentative please call before visiting) 

Coming to what I tried :

Lat-ma-kai chicken. ( Highly recommended.)

Rum bbq chicken cheese pizza. ( Must try for thin-crust pizza lovers.)

Teen Paan hookah.

Vodka and whiskey. 

Everything is perfectly balanced and great. Price is on the higher side but a must try place for all.

Red sauce pasta and garlic bread was orderd . The pasta was soft and the sauces were nicely blended . It had ample of vegetables.. The beers are also nicely prized. recommended

Be it a Tuesday or a Friday the temperature of this place always remains high be it in terms of ambience or atmosphere. The music is always played according to the ambience. A very convenient place on crossing of camac street and theater road.
When it comes to food, the items are really well cooked or served, be it grilled chicken tacos or pan pizza or nachos con polos.
Drinks are a bit on the expensive side but on weekdays if the crowd is less the attendants do offer complimentary drinks.
In our case the attendant Amit made sure that we are being continuously treated and served with food or drinks.
In all, an excellent experience.

Location-Theatre road,Shagun mall

Visited this place recently.Its a good place to hangout.The place is well decorated and recently it started serving nonveg dishes.They have a well stocked bar and has also added a few cocktail in their refurbished menu.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is calm and the place is well decorated with the dim lighting and quotes all around.A loud music is always tuned up by the Dj at this place which attracts the youngster to hangout at this place.

Service-Though the staff was very polite and friendly but the service was disappointing.The dishes brought were not served in our plates and we have to do it of our own.

Food-The food at this place is finger licking.And the presentation is also very good.But we find it quite expensive.We had few dishes-
1:Cottage cheese souvlaki
2:Mexican rice platter
3:Molten chocolate
4:Mixed sauce pasta.
 Among them "mexican rice platter" is a must try.

Food-4/5
Ambiance-4.5/5
Service-3/5

You can visit this place for a casual hangout with friends but its not a pocket friendly place to visit in.üòÑüòÑ

The food is above average here . The presentation is good. The prices are a bit on the expensive side considering the fact that it has loud music and has average seating and ambience. The service is pretty bad. The waiters need to be called atleast twice to get your attention and even when you order they do not seem to be interested in serving you. 
They did charge us wrongly in the bill which is a prof of their carelessness.
A special mention is the Thai chicken  green curry that we had which was authentic and lived up to its name. Other than that, nothing interesting in the cocktail end as well. Spicekraft does it really well these days and they should take a cue out of it.

On the higher side in terms of pricing.
The bar is almost impossible to locate if you are a first timer.
Service is not bad and the ambience is something new to say the least. Its a small place with no windows and tries whatever it can to make you feel at a sports bar.
Good enough for a one time visit but I surely didn't find much reasons to revisit this place over and over.

Going to this place was a great experience. I had this place on my wish list for quite some time now. However, since we were a bit low on cash, we couldn't order much. The beer was priced according to industry standards, their potato and cheese croquettes were really good. The staff was extremely friendly and supportive. The owner was a swell guy too. Loved the experience, will definitely go back for a revisit. They would have got a full five I'd the place was a bit larger and had a dance floor, since they have a inhouse DJ. Saved it for constructive criticism. Cheers !

Last week my friend and I decided to go to Wall Street Bar for lunch as we were shopping in the vicinity. Firstly ,when I reached the floor on which it was situated there were no directions,it looked like a maze to me. Secondly, whatever we ordered wasn't available. We had to change our order 4 times because most of it wasn't available. It was 2 pm and I don't understand if a place isn't prepared to serve it's customer then why do they even open it before time? If you guys open at 12pm and I have gone their at 2pm then shouldn't you be serving whatever is being ordered? Lastly, for an ambience like that,playing Hindi slow love songs becomes a big turn off.The food was okay. I wouldn't want to go there again.

Now the food: pizza wsb special- thin crust absolutely filling, kitkat shake - a must to be ordered with every meal, Pasta white sauce- rightly spiced and Mexican rice sizzlers - spicy. But ambience is what made the food really enjoyable. So do visit!!!

Disappointed with this place. Entering the place is like entering a maze. When we finally did and settled ourselves at a table, we were asked to move because apparently the portion had been reserved for a party. I don't mind that, but was left wondering why had the area not already been demarcated as reserved. The music was way too loud. I don't get what the point is of having such loud music for a place where you want people to sit and eat/drink. Anyway, the loud music was enough of a disincentive for me and my friend to quickly finish our drinks and starters and head elsewhere for a meal.

Visited Wall Street Bar on Sunday in happy hours. The entrance is like a maze. We reached at 7 and few people were there. Gradually it started to fill up. We got a seat so near to DJ's console that made difficult for us to talk to each other. We asked for the deal of happy hours and it was disappointing to know that only Smirnoff and 2 other brands were under deal and not even beer. We ordered one pitcher of Cosmopolitan and from starters ordered Ginger fried chicken and Chicken in Baked Wonton cups. Ginger chicken was extremely good. But none of us liked the taste of chicken in wonton cups. Too much use of basil, not suitable for our taste buds. Lastly we ordered Darsaan in dessets which was again a great hit. It was super yum. Overall a nice place for evening hangout with decent food and drink options.

Went there few days back for lunch with my colleagues. To begin with, the ambience is nice but it looks like a maze to me, long empty passage with no direction mentioned. We finally figured our way out and occupied a comfortable seat. After 5 mins, we managed to hunt for the waiter to take the order. Few things which will turn you off right away  - music is toooo loud (it is perfect if you go there in the evening to chill during happy hours but not fine when you take a lunch break during office hours) we were shouting out our lungs to call the waiter (-1). Then when we finally decided what to order( corn kabab and crispy potato) and placed the order around 1:15pm the manager came back after 5 mins saying kabab won't be available and suggested paneer Tikka. We went ahead with the suggestion. At 1:40pm while we were still waiting for the starters to come,  we reminded the waiter and he replied back saying it's JUST be 17 mins since you have placed the order (-1). So we understood that the service is slow so we decided to order the main course also just to save time. While we were picking our options we asked the waiter for his suggestion. Never seen a waiter so dumb. He knew absolutely nothing about the menu. We asked him about a dish and nodded his head. Then he took the menu from us and started reading the description. When we asked him the dressing for Greek salad he replied back saying it's a cabbage baked dish! That's how you train your staff? Seeing his zero knowledge we decided to NOT place the order for lunch and decided to only have starters. We had to ask him to serve us water as well. In the scorching heat the moment you enter the place water should be served right away but here we had to ask him to serve us water which came 45 mins after waiting. The starters were finally served at 2pm and our lunch break was over. So we barely had a bite or two and left.

Next Ginger chicken, after having it i felt like will order it next time for sure when i visit. The flop item of the menu is Chicken wanton cup , didn't like the taste and the smell of basil is strong . The darsaan desert was the best desert in my hit list. ¬†One should try that

Upon walking in, the music and crowd gets you into a good vibe. Maybe that's the reason that we said no to loose drinks and said yes to an entire bottle. And then another one. The waiters are very friendly, and as much as I liked them, I was left wondering if there was an element of hard-selling. But a rather good experience, so gets a thumbs up from me for sure.

This was the second time I visited WSB and I must congratulate them as this was a much better experience as compared to the first.! The hosts were friendly and accommodating! To start with it was crowded because of the IPL Finals but the usher got us seats really quickly! The Mexican Sizzler was Okay-ish, the hookah was amazing and u can't really do much when it comes to a Bud(weiser) but yes they were served chilled! The best part of the evening was the music.. It simply couldn't have been better! The house Dj played every genre under the sun, you simply couldn't tell what he's gonna play next... The transition of the music into the match commentary as and when the match resumed after the commercials was a neat touch! We couldn't have wished for a better experience to SRH's knock of 208. Thank you WSB! I am definitely coming back again! Kudos to the entire staff for making this visit worthwhile! Keep up the good work guys! üòáüëç

One of the new places to have opened in Kolkata. This one covers a huge area, and offers sitting at the bar or like the usual chair and table. This place also serves hookah, with Pan Masala being the preferred one for most of the visitors. It also offers good discounts and promotional offer on Liquor. Now coming to the food, all the 3 items we took, Wood Fired Pizza, Chicken Quesadillas, and Vegetable Saute was worth the money. It was very very tasty, with no space for complaints. 

Footnote: Please have that policy of chucking out revellers who come in, get drunk and then do all sort of nonsense. It happened with us, but if you guys don't chuck the indecent ones, then we might stop coming altogether.

I went there with my friends to celebrate my brother's birthday on 15th may. Had read a blog about it and was expecting something good. However my experience was just okay. The place looks good but the music is too loud. There is very little variety in food. And was shortage of plates and glasses too. They could work to enhance the menu and have a good play list... We had so limited options that we got out in an hour and decided to try some other restraunts.. It was my brother's birthday and I felt really bad for suggesting this place.

We know for a fact that Wall Street in New York is the world's largest financial sector. WSB in Kolkata brings to you, a glimpse of New York. The bar is located just next to B.K. Market in Shakespeare Sarani. You might have a little trouble which door exactly leads to the entrance. It's located on the first floor of Shagun Mall, a lit up staircase painted with inspirational quotes at every step. The big WSB hoarding welcomes you after which you turn right, and right again till you reach a corridor having shelves filled up with toys and showpieces on one side and a 3d horizontal poster of New York's skyscrapers at night, on the other side. Then you finally stand in front of the door to the bar. Definitely confusing for first timers. The place was empty, much to our surprise. The food was good, so were the drinks and hookah. Really liked the concept of the hookah stand painted with acrylic colors. The lighting is dim and the choice of music was much appreciated, keeping up with the trend. The service was excellent and the staff were way too polite. Standard pocket pinch for two would be about 900 rupees.

With the fall of the economy at the Wall Street, this place is also nothing but a downfall. 
The operational timing listed on Zomato says that it opens at 12, and after reaching at 12:20, we were informed that they will take another 20 minutes to open. 
We ordered for a drink which took 15 minutes to be served and tasted like sugar syrup. 
The khowsuey was the worst I've ever had. It was spicy, green in colour and was served with whole peanuts. At least serve the condiments right which don't even have to be cooked! 
We also ordered for a schezwan noodles sizzler and I could not have more than two bites of it because it was extremely extremely spicy. 
The water tasted funny. The server in the meanwhile got us a mock tail to make up for the bad service. 
Giving a drink does not make up for the terrible food being served! 
The place has terrible management. The servers have zero knowledge of what they are doing. 
Terrible terrible experience. Would never go back again!

Catchy signage sure catches your attention if you travel along theatre road. The decor inside is dark, but the use of leather gives ot a plush feel. Food is good. However, they run out of a variety of beers at times.

Located in Theater road this place is sure to grab your attention. We had to struggle to look for the entrance but once we got in the place was full of surprises. I loved the interior. The place is really cool for a couple of drink or a hangout. The sign outside the washrooms took my attention as well :D :D. Neatly decorated Bar, well behaved staff and bar tender and loud music. To be honest in the beginning the songs were really dull and boring but once requested the DJ did play some nice music. We were there to booze only so wont able to tell about the food. They had "cocktail pitchers" which i liked.

This place has got cool interiors and an awesome ambience with dim lights and good music collection. Food is great and service even greater. I heard that the place will soon be offering booze too. Judging by its location and all that this place can offer within the price tag this place would be on everyone's wish list. Would be visiting again soon.

Went on a Sunday evening, it was pretty crowded when we entered.
The drinks and shisha which we had ordered were pretty decent.¬†
Coming to food, Taco was mentioned in the non veg section, though it was a plain veg dish. Spicy fried calamari tasted great. In main course, we had Frutti de mare and Rum BBQ chicken pizza. Both were satisfying.¬†
Music was Bollywood peppy dance songs. Blended well with the ambiance.
They should improve their service, it was quite slow and unorganized to a great extent.

Visited this place on a saturday. The crowd was good. The service of this place is so slow that it could make a record. We actually had to remind the waiters 5 times that we had placed an order and they need to serve the dish. No order reached the table before 40 minutes. The ambience of the place is good but the waiters are extremely laid back in service. This kind of service on a Saturday is unacceptable as people visit places to relax and not for constant bickering. The food was good in taste and the portions were good too. Overall experience was average. Not visiting the place again unless I absolutely have to.

Boring and useless...just giving cool quotations on wall doesn't make something cool...overpriced overhyped I would say the place is...this is certainly a place that people choose if the other places are overcrowded or  closed. Waiters should be taught to suggest the foods and drinks that should be feasible for the customers requurement not to suggest the most expensive items in menu. I would suggest people to go any local bar but not this as this is not customer friendly and is certainly overpriced. ..no value for money...Try to improve on customer requirements not just fill up your pockets.

Have been here thrice but never had an opportunity to write about how lovely the place is..It never fails to disappoint me and that's the reason I drop in here with different group of friends ..The food ,the shisha,the drinks evrythns good..The best part of it,although it has recently started is the availability of non veg food..who wouldn't just prefer non veg with beer? The great thng is the 1:1 drink which however maintaining the marketing style doesn't fail to soothe us..
Again to drop here very soon for my bday celebration. .
This place just has it all..great work guys..kudos n cheersüëç

Three of best friends went there for a sunday evening. We had 1 on 1 free on that day. Price given in the menu was for 30ml so it was basically a marketing style. Food was really good. Stir fried chicken with bell pepper was grt. Lat me kai was avg. Chickn gonger strips was good. We also had hookah and JD in drinks. Ambience was good and also had the live screen for which we didnot miss the kkr match. Bill was 4000. In short nothing great but worth visiting on a lazy sunday evening with your friends.

I saw this place while crossing the street and thought of visiting it coz of its attractive logo..so me n my friend went there on Thursday night. The place has nothing to do with its name, I don't get why they gave "wall Street" name to this place. There's no ambience at all, DJ plays normal Bollywood no.s. Food tastes average but bit overly priced. Staffs were good. Service was good. Nothing great to mention. One can give it a pass.

The city is changing every day and with every passing day it keeps amazing us with its latest offerings. Last Saturday I was invited to a Bloggers Meet over Food Tasting session at Wall Street Bar, Shakespeare Sarani and I was so excited to be at the new Gastro-Pub which is now becoming a landmark for great beverages, food, hookah and entertainment. It is serving some amazing Chinese, Continental, Italian, and Burmese dishes and they claim to have specialization in Italian and Burmese, well I truly agree with that since my Khow Suey was really nice! :)

I would say in the summers this is one really cool place to chill out especially if you are close to Theatre Road area. As a matter of fact I have heard that this six months old joint used to dish out only vegetarian dishes couple of months back but recently they have introduced Non-veg items as well and infact we were there to sample these newly introduced non-veg items and few other newly introduced items in their refurbished menu. This place has got a well-stocked bar and they are gaining popularity in preparing some power-packed cocktails. 

LOCATION - - - - - The place is very easy to locate and it is there right on the main road, just try to locate the address 10A Shakespeare Sarani. It is there on the 1st floor of the Shagun Mall. You need to take the stairs and you will be guided to this place on the 1st floor. Since the place is quite dimly lit so if you are coming in straight from the sun, you will find it difficult to adjust your vision for a while. While you step inside the restaurant you will pass though an alley with nice colorful gift items displayed on the wall shelves.

AMBIANCE - - - - - This is one of the great features of this place. The ambiance is pretty chilled out with loud music and a DJ churning out some awesome stuff to keep you glued. As already said the place is pretty dimly lit, that sets the mood right and helps you unwind pretty fast. The seating arrangements are nicely planned and are quite spaced out. The lights over the bar counter are somehow lovely since you find the filaments have been placed in the Absolut vodka bottles which looks great! The wooden finish flooring makes the place looks classy and the comfy high chairs along the strategically illuminated bar counter (with glowing WSB logo on the wall) makes thing even more gorgeous! We were seated on the normal couches by the side of the bar counter and they were very comfortable and you have the television right there by your side where you can enjoy sports and the live telecasts, if any. The walls are adorned with catchy taglines neatly framed and there are couple of walls showing the New York skyline. Wall Street, historically is known as the center of New York's financial district and the WSB is themed on that. It is also surrounded with corporates in the heart of the city so you get to see office goers by the end of the day loosening up and chatting over few drinks. The 50 seater dining zone is spread across 2,000sq ft where people meet to dine and drink. The wooden d√©cor gives this pub the urbane feel along with the signature Harbour View on the walls. The DJ is placed at one of the corners with US flag in the background, and overall - the place is sure to attract the young generation and hope the d√©cor and ambiance stays like this over the years.  

FOOD - - - - - We tried several food items and we feel this place truly puts loads of stress on food although it is a pub, this is one such odd pub which also scores high when it comes to food ‚Äì maybe that‚Äôs why we call it a Gastropub since in a Gastropub you should expect great food items and meals besides pub grubs. But a gastropub is expected to serve high-end beer as well, which was not included in our list of beverages. Here you get great meals for your lunch or dinner besides lip smacking finger food. We tried a few snacks, some cocktails and couple of complete meals. Overall the food was really nice, they kept the flavors and aroma like the way it should be to maintain authenticity keeping in mind the use of fresh ingredients. We had in our menu ‚Äì Gondhoraj mojito, Grilled and baked mushrooms, Chicken ginger strips, Bekti Cupcakes, Khow Suey, Bhuna Masala chicken wings with burnt garlic rice, and Cheese Fondue. I loved the ‚Äì 

a)	Baked mushrooms ‚Äì They were extremely well prepared with a melt-in-your-mouth texture. These were well marinated mushrooms stuffed and baked with ricotta. And it is served with a three cheese medley.

b)	Ginger chicken strips ‚Äì This was served with tartar sauce and the chicken strips were perfectly crispy on the outside and well marinated and prepared inside. It‚Äôs worth a try. 

c)	Cheese Fondue ‚Äì The dish looked stunning with a flame keeping the thyme flavored cheese fondue warm, it was served with saut√©ed veggies and crunchy bread cubes. Overall the dish tasted good. 

d)	Bhuna Masala chicken wings with Burnt garlic rice ‚Äì I loved the burnt garlic rice served in this dish in quite a good quantity, the Bhuna masala chicken was served with some salad. The dish had a single piece of chicken wing which was very well prepared, was a bit tangy and bit spicy, it went good with the wok tossed rice, nice option to try out!

e)	Khow Suey ‚Äì This was the best dish that I tried at this place. It was soul satisfying and pretty filling. As we know it is a soup and noodle based Burmese dish and here it was pretty authentic, aromatic and very flavorful. The aroma of coconut milk and the squeeze of lemon spelled its magic and kept me glued to it till the last nibble! Add the rice noodles and condiments provided alongside and take the taste to the next level. This is one dish you should try if you are here at this place!

f)	The Rocket launcher ‚Äì It was an awesome cocktail with a mix of five spirits that can leave you tipsy! It was served in a big glass bottle and is surely for four or five to share! 

g)	Bellini ‚Äì It is one of the classic cocktails which is a bubble-peach flavored sparkling wine based drink and it was truly smooth and awesome!  

h)	Wall Street special ‚Äì This is the house special cocktail. This was served in a long glass with cranberry and orangey flavor and on my request the spirit levels were kept a bit low. It was served with thing apple slices and a cherry on top, perfect!

Besides the great food and beverages, WSB has designed special nights like ‚Äì 

a)	Karaoke Nights on Wednesdays, 

b)	Live Band on Thursdays, 

c)	Ladies night Out on Fridays, 

d)	Switch Night underground music on Saturdays, 

e)	Standup comedy nights on Sundays. 

The scenario is further enhanced with Bollywood, Hip Hop, House Music, Unplugged, and Deep House music. The eatery offers Happy Hours from Sunday to Friday from 3pm to 8pm.

SERVICE - - - - - After the great section about food we come to the not so great section where we discuss about the service. The servers/waiters are polite but they need to be trained a bit. I was not served couple of items which was disappointing; it was not served even after asked for. One such item was the Bhetki Cupcake that everyone had and they appreciated. After requesting for several times the Bar menu was then handed over to me! And after these, my Wall Street special cocktail was unintentionally pushed on me while serving another food item, but I am really very grateful to Mr. Aayush Karel, the co-owner of this place who immediately came over to me and helped me out to recover and took my phone to get it dried! 

Anyway, it was nice to meet the chef-in-charge Mr. Deepak Kr Majumdar. He came to us, took a seat and had a chat with us answering our queries, he is truly a very humble and soft-spoken person and we learnt that he had started his career with The Park and Flury‚Äôs in Kolkata before settling down at Mumbai.

SUMMARY - - - - - If I am asked to rate this place I will give it 3.8 out of 5 points. It could‚Äôve scored higher if the service would‚Äôve been a bit better. I really loved the food items which were served to me. The cocktails were amazing as well. I have already discussed about the ambiance and it is just right for a gastro-pub. Food is one of the major focus here and it clearly shows. WSB is best known for its well stocked bar and the house cocktails, its Burmese and continental food and also for its range of pub grubs. The Switch Saturdays which promote underground music with alternative DJs every week makes this place more attractive on the grounds of clubbing. 

Finally, Mr. Aayush, the co-owner is extremely polite, dynamic and friendly, we had wished him all the best and I would again like to wish him the very best for WSB and for all his future ventures. 

Cheers!
                                          ...

couldnt really understand the reason behind the name as the interiors are not made in that theme..according to me...
the food is pretty average...nothing outstanding....the staff is untrained and that shows clearly as they dont even know their own menu...
coming to menu....was utterly dissapointed with it...as its just print outs typed on ms word
the hookah lacked smoke and flavour and had to call for the staff again and again...
the place can be visited once or twice to take a break from other places..bt nt more than that

Just like the name, the place will attract you too. The place is easily accessible. The ambience will drift you away far from reality. The food will do justice to your taste buds along with the hookahs and hard drinks. You can even dance your heart out or simply sit in the bar with your beer or wine glass and have a look around. You must hang out with your friends once in a while.

We(me and my friends) were looking for a place which offered both drinks and hookah, and stumbled upon this place on zomato. We went with no expectations but this place surprised us, pleasantly of course. We ordered gold tequilas, rum and whiskey along with pan flavored (milk base) hookah. The food had baked mushrooms(single button mushrooms baked in timid spices garnished with a squeeze of mayo and topped with parsley), vegetable lasagna (loved the smoky flavors of tomato, zucchini and bell peppers underneath the creamy goodness) and cheese risotto(cooked to perfection). 
The hookah was strong and they did not charge for a refill. The attendants were extremely well mannered and courteous, which is quite rare to find nowadays in such a bustling environment. The music was perfect and so was the decor with indulgent yet witty one-liners on their walls. We entered within the happy hours and discovered that they have various other interesting and pocket saving options for everyday of the week. 
My only advise would be to increase the food portions as compared to the prices. Though the food is vegetarian but it is for sure tasty. 
I loved the place and would recommend it for everyone who likes to booze, to suck in some hookah, to sing out loud, enjoy yummy food and also save himself from drilling a hole in the pocket(don't forget the happy hour timings).

Wall Street Bar gives you an awesome first impression. It actually looked super cool even from the outside. The arrow made with beer cans draws special attention. We entered and the decor is really funky however its classy too. Coming to food, they had an offer going on like 4 beers with 1 classic margarita. Since budwiser wasn't available we ordered 4 bira blonde. Margarita was large enough to feed 2.  And it was quite a classic one. Thin crust, great toppings. Hands down. We ordered a strong seesha. When it came it was not strong at all. But they changed immediately and honestly great seesha. Cheesers were accompanied with beers which were obviously not good so like we kind of bound to order masala papad. I think in these pubs or lounges budwiser is a must have. And nothing more to add we'd pay another visit shortly.

Have been here multiple times. The food is vegetarian as of now (they're starting their non veg soon) and is of quality. The service is excellent and the owner looks into it personally. Appropriately priced, it has a pub-ish ambience and plays good music as well. 

Would definitely go back!

Visited the place on Christmas.. The place was full but thankfully we had a prior booking done.

The service was very quick, polite staff.
The Dj was amazing, he kept the floor busy with the taste of the crowd. And we danced our heart out!!
The place is spacious, and seating arrangements are decent, though it's a lil' shady kinda place!!
The hookah was great, flavor as well as the smoke.
We had ordered for four cheese risotto-it was so creamy soft and spicy..try it
Indian platter-was not good..it was not fresh and had some stench 
Aglio Olio was decent.. Can try
Nachos was good too..dips were good
Overall a great experience. For a new place in the city, it's gonna do great

Had been waiting for a long time for this place to get a liquor license. And they got it finally a couple of months back! Bang opposite my office on the Theatre Road (Shakespeare Saraini), Wall Street is a welcome addition to the veg-only (not anymore) places in Kolkata.

Nice, happy ambience for a post-work drink or two, though the music could have been a little less loud. The menu reads a little different with cuisines named after giant corporations and the appetizers are a delight. The non-nicotine hookah is pretty good as well. A must-visit place for getting a lot of things right.

Location : Ideally located, just a few metres from theatre ac market or in shagun mall.

Ambience : The place basically has two sections, one in the corridor from which you enter and the other is a hall with a bar, with comfortable sofa seating as well as typical bar like high raised chairs.
The volume of music played is too high and it doesn't allows you to to have a conversation even if you are sitting on the opposite ends of a table.
Lightining is soothing and suits well with the environment.
The moving colourful lights,storbes and lasers may seem irritating after sometime.
*Air flow is not managed well and if you are a hookah person, you maybe irritated by the same.*

Staff : Staff is polite and guides you in making a choice. But, they are not like the ones who always serves you with a smile. Period.

Hookah : They use gel based flavors for hookah which is "belived" to be nicotine free and is not so common in the city now.

Blueberry Gum : The flavor used was absolutely amazing and each puff was flavorful.
Teen paan rose : The flavors were mixed with great precision and the result was also absolutely genius!
But, the hookah was served to us without charging and we had to charge it!
Due to unmanaged air flow, you may not enjoy your sheesha as the rings break almost instantly and smoke also goes with the air!

Smoke is not very dense and the quantity of smoke is also very average.
The smoke quantity also degrades drastically within a very less time due to direct ac air which cools down the coal quickly!

Food : Nachoes was ordered and it was preety good and the cheese sprinkled was also generous. But, it was served without any dips and on asking for mayo and salsa dips, only salsa was served saying with a tinge of rudeness that mayo can't be served!

*A bottle of mineral water was ordered, which had a printed mrp of Rs.55/- but we were charged Rs.120/- for the same excluding taxes*
Note : They also serve normal water without any extra cost also.

They also have dj nights on weekends but they may not allow stag entry!

The place definitely deserves a visit.

This place is easy to locate , it is situated on main road. I happened to visit there with my friend we tasted kiwi frappe, blue lagoon, lasagna, rice balls with spicy dip. Food was average , service was OK . reason you should pay a visit to this place is it's interiors . ambience didn't impress me much , you can give it a visit.

Was there for the 31st early eve, they were very clear about their cover charge for the evening, and that they shall be removing the tables in due time. But did not disturb our dining experience, which gives them an extra point. The ambiance and the interiors are really interesting. Hookah was just GREAT. We ordered teen paan rasna wall street special. 
They don't have a printed menu for their cocktails, which is soo surprising for a cafe turned bar. Wall street Bar, and no menu for the drinks, is a mockery. I ordered for a pink lady, which was then unavailable, and i ended up with a cosmopolitan. The worst cosmopolitan i ever had. No punch.
For food, nachos was done well, but the aglio olio spaghetti pasta was undercooked. 
Overall a mediocre experience, but the hookah and music saved it all. 
Hope to see a better and more attentive service, where the waiters fo not forget to serve what they were asked to.
P.S. only the hookah can take me back to the place.

The most pathetic place on Earth.. Strictly advise not to go there... At the outset after making us seat, they said they will get the remove the tables and chairs, Den the most embarrassing thing was that they handed a pamphlet showing they only had five items on their menu.. & finally they gave cranberry juice as vodka shots.. They indirectly charged us 500 bucks for all items.. Pathetic... Simply pathetic

Visited this place on the 25th Dec, well to begin with, the ambience is pretty good with good seating arrangements, we ordered 2 hookahs, 4 cokes and pizza. Hookah was really good, food was good too. Dj played good music, and the place is good for clicking :p.

This place is just amazing! Be it the interiors, staff, food, hookah,location, this place is a perfect 10 on a scale of 10. The staff is really humble but their service slow. Like yeah. Slow.     The Vietnamese roll was something really good also the sizzler. A little spicy though but yum. The hookah. The three chillam and six pan hookah. Relishing enough. This place is must visit. Their prices are really low. With four people that too for my birthday treat we were happily done in just 1200 bucks with great food and hookah! I would love to visit this place again and again. Amazing it is.

Visited on friends birthday. One of my friend had designed the Wall Street. It was pretty good. Staffs were welcoming, courteous and cordial. They escorted us to the table. Lobby was there separate. Ambience was good enough, dim light was there, high chairs, sofa seating. Shisha, Continental cuisine, drinks everything was there. Service was fast. We had ordered shisha (teen pan, rose and teen pan, spring water), LIIT, redbull in beverages. Then starting up with starters we had global platter ( basically kebab),  crispy Chilli Babycorn, veitnamese roll (spring roll). Finally main course-- mix sauce penne pasta, Margarita pizza with veggies. They had served a complimentary desert to us as it was my friend birthday. 
Was worth visiting here, will visit soon.

Cheers!

We weren't in a mood to try something new, so simply ordered Babycorn which tasted fine, and noodles which was yummy. We also ordered Moussaka, good for people who prefer more of veggies and Paneer. The place is a bit expensive but as per the quantity of food they serve it's worth.

Location : Near AC Market.

Visited Wall Street on my friend‚Äôs birthday bash last month. Its located on the 1st floor of Shagun Mall with extensive hoardings and banner leading you right towards it. In comparison to other similar leading joints in the area, Wall Street falls a little behind in terms of floor area. The interior has been done to match that of casual dine-ins in the West. The lighting is on the dimmer side, making a selfie session difficult :-P

For the food we had ordered 3 platters‚ÄîYuan Renminbi Platter, Rupiya Platter and Rial Platter. Despite of having that many number of eateries at my disposal, I didn‚Äôt feel fully content. While some of the elements were truly exquisite, others failed to capture my imagination.
Even the shisha was pretty average and passable.

In an overview, the inaugural of Wall Street was a lil over hyped as it was the publicity itself that had lead us to this place. The staff are well behaved and polite and pay attention to the orders, even help in selection of dishes. The ambience is a boost though and the Dj might even play to your moods if the demand is raised.

Location: Shakespeare sarani on the first floor of Shagun wedding mall.

Ambiance: Decent bit dark, high chairs, sofa seatings.

Menu and food: Extremely confusing menu, serves little purpose.
I ordered for a spring water hookah and it was decent.
The penne pesto was presented well but lacked in taste! Pesto is a rustic sauce prepared with olive oil and basil. Personally don't prefer cream in the sauce, dampens the leafy flavor of basil.

Service: Was Ok, nothing to mention about.

Overall an average place.

The very first impression of the place you get is when you enter and there is a dumb head lady sitting outside at the reception who just does not know anything and is sitting there for no use! The very first impression of this place by that lady made me feel what stupid place is this with stupid staffs. But it dint come that way, the hookah and the food were not as bad as i expected! Only if the lady is changed or she is made to keep her mouth shut if she is unaware of anything then the place is just very nice to visit with friends and chill!

Description :
As we enter the restaurant, we were amazed by its decor. We were well greeted and shown our table. It was an occasion of bhaiduj. Coming to the food, tomota soup & khowsuey were good. All the starters were excellent. Spicy pesto pizza was not spicy though we were told hat it will be very spicy. Lasagna was good. Mexican rice & risotto were excellent. In mocktails, virgin colada was among the worst drink I ever tasted. Mix fruit mojito & kiwi frappe is a must try. We were also served a special starter platter of soya kabab marinated with pesto served in a satay sticks.
Overall good experience. One should go for its varieties of items they offer on menu. Highly recommended.

Hooka, drinks, starters are really good, ambience is attractive. You can throw a small party here & I am sure your guests will like it. I didnt have a proper meal or anything so wont comment on that, however I will share an update & change my review once I try other things on menu. I also liked the staff there, they make sure you do not have to wait for someone to take your order. Overall a good experience.

As we walked in to the pub , some narrow lanes took us inside the restaurant. Very loud music, huge screens, dark ambience, with no people almost. It's a pub, but they are yet to serve liquor, had no idea but it was a vegetarian place. Quite expensive but tried out their fondue. Very nice but very expensive. I found the ambience uncomfortable in one word.

In the food menu Mexican rice was yummy but the global platter was worthless and not at all tasty. Hospitality was also superb. Last and the best thing was the music which was being played by the owner himself.
I am deducting marks for the time which they took for serving the food..

I ordered a Black Forest shake as suggested by their staff which was made aptly and instantly lifted up my mood! 
We ordered a Risotto which was pretty nice too!
The penne pasta in a mixed sauce was also done quite well ! 
Pricing is decent too !
They could jus light up the place a lil bit coz currently with Dim lights the place looks a lil dull!

Opened as wall street bar (WSB), now changed to just wall street.. Funny.. The place is conveniently located at theatre road. I visited this place on its opening day, and its was a blunder, the servers did not have any idea about the dishes as the names were after the various stock exchanges round the globe.. This is an expensive place. A wrong place to go in big groups, coz the space is very limited. The interiors are good, the gender label outside the restrooms are the weirdest of all.. Should check out.. Hehe

Nice place, good food. Although the staff was very enthusiastic but inexperience showed clearly. Good to have valet parking but need people at the main entrance of the building to guide the patrons, rather than waiting deep inside the premises.

Had to catch up its a friend after office so chose this place. Very conveniently located. On entering I liked the way it was done up into different sections! Called for a female cheese mushroom pizza which was perfect :)  fresh lime soda which was well made and hookah which was very well made. The service is quick... Dimly lit, I liked the ambience also. Will visit again :) I guess this would be a real happening place once they get their liquor licence!

A new place in the city with fresh vibes. The service is good and the staff us very friendly. We tried their lasagne, which is the best lasagne i ever had. We also tried the dollar platter that serves bruschetta, croquette, quesadilla, all were good. We also ordered spaghetti in pesto sauce which was average. We tried the pizza which was pretty decent. The food was finely prepared and were served hot. I liked the overall experience. Would love to visit again. Highly recommended for a nice hangout.

Went there on a friends recommendation. Was shocked to see no alcohol and no non veg on the menu, had to suffice myself with veg food. Food was good, liked the pasta alot. It was perfectly cooked(which you rearly find in restaurants today, either its over cooked or undercooked). There sizzlers and crispy veg are worth trying. In all a good experience.

Dimly lit chic interiors with really loud R&B music are the first things that you notice about the place. The hookah was nice. We had the Khow Suey soup which was on the spicier side. The service was great. But they didn't serve any alcohol which is a deal breaker for me.

Try this place if you want the clubbing experience without the drinks.

1. Average food.
2. Late service.
3. Gives you an impression of a bar but doesn't serve alcohol.
4. They won't serve you regular water. You have to order mineral water. This is the first ever restaurant i have seen not serving regular water.
As a whole not at all worth visiting.

Well...heard about this place from one of my bestie ..so planned to visit the same with my group yesterday.


To start off with ambience...it was quite good with decorated walls and sayings seems to match with the name "WALLSTREET". Sitting was good with comfortabke chairs. But the music was not at all good which pertains that they have no choice for music.


Coming over to food and shisha, we ordered Rajnigandha flovour with graoe base but to my surprise it was worsely prepared. Even the flavour was not being noticed and we were bound to get it changed and replaced thrice but still the scenerio was same. Out of having no option, we had to take the same. After looking over the quality of hukaah we didnt even thought of ordering anything in mocktails or food which would have been likely to be of same grade as hukaah.


Coming over to service and quality, we experienced poor service with remarkably high time. We ordered shisha which took more than 25-30 mins to be served. Even changing and replacing it took more than 15 mins each and quality as said was below mark.


We had no option left to leave the place as early as possible after experiencing such a worst service ever. Would never refer anybody to this place nor would think to visit the same till the service, food, shisha and music comes upto the mark.

The mocktails, specially the dark caribbean, which is a mixed fruit based one was really great.
And lastly, just to add to the overwhelming experience, the hospitality of the waiters and the managers, and how everything was handled by them was just fabulous.

The experience was wonderful. The ambience was like wowüòçüòçüòç. As you go further the hospitality was one the best in kolkata. The chiefs were ploite and friendly. 

Coming to hookah. We ordered gum supari rose. The hoohak was one of the most smoothest hookah i ever had. The flavour was gud smoke was dense and it didn't choked at all during the 1.5 hours duration.

Food. We ordered cheese founge and it waas the best i had. The mox herbs flavour was awsome. It was served hot with a buring flame to keep the cheese hot the entire time and taste of herbs was why it was so gud. The bread pieces were perfect. 

Overall was a gud experience and wpuld be looking forward to visit again and regularly. Infact planning to take my friends for a treat there..

Came to wall street on 27th august at 11 30 pm. Had called up the place before coming. We were told that the last order time is at 12 and the place is open till the time we are there. On going to the place the waiter comes at 12 at tells us that we are closing. Had to call the manager after which he told us that you will have to pay your bill first and then you can stay. First time at wall street and probably the last time.

Coming the the hookah . Had ordered a coconut base with an apple chillam , flavour double apple. Hookah was just ok . Nothing exceptional. Nachos too just fine.

Ambience 4/5
Music 3/5
Hookah and food 2/5

I visited this place within a month of its opening. And we had a wonderful time. 

Usually when we visit a newly opened place, there are going to be certain let downs in terms of service or quality of food. But Wall Street is the only newly opened place I came across which did not disappoint me in my first visit. 

1. We ordered Pizza, Cheese Rice Balls, Chinese Platter. Each one of them were tasty, with perfect quantity and quality.

2. The staff was courteous, knowledgable and provided excellent service.

3. The ambience was really good, enough lights, good music.

Verryyy smooth.. Super dense smoke.. Food was good too.. The waiters were friendly..  They knew we were irritated with the slow service..  They kept apologising and made sure v din complain abt the quality..  So that was very nice.. 
Washroom ventilation was aweful.. It was full of smoke from the kitchen.. This needs to be taken care of.  
Overall i had fun :)

One of the newly opened joints in town this place is still awaiting its most important component- liquor!!

The place is located on Theatre road diagonally opposite to the air conditioned market. As you enter you realise that the people have given a lot of thought about the interiors and they are appealing to your eyes. The place is a bit smaller than what i had expected it to be.

Nonetheless the owner told us that liquor would be starting in a months time or so.

We ordered for our hookah which was really well made. The smoke the flavour all was perfectly acceptable.

In food we had the mushroom soup .. Which they call by some fancy name and we had what is called walt disney by them which was basically a spinach and pea kebab. I really liked both of them and specially the kebab which was quite different. Definitely worth a visit specially when they start serving alcohol.

The bill was around 1600 which is slightly in the higher side but definitely worth the ambiance.

Wall street Bar, the newest place in town. Very nicely made it gives you a good feel when u enter.
Nice ambience.
Superb food. 
Khowsuey is excellent. Bruschetta was amazing !! Will definitely want to try the other options here when i come in a bigger group !!
Only thing that needs improvement is the sheesha here. But am sure with time thats gonna improve as well !! üòä

It was my first visit to this cafe! The entrance is a bit eye catching and the food was good but the hookah was not up to the mark! I liked their music but the service was not so good and overall i think the place would've been more better!

newly opened place in kolkata. ambience is good. perfect music. hookah was just amazing. however they need to work on food. I didn't like their pasta, as pasta was local and pasta's size was big. use small size pasta please. they mix more with sauces. Would love to give you 4.5 if you change your pasta when i will visit again.

Restaurant is nice but ambiance is extraordinarily loud. Music volume should be kept to decent level. When enquired to reduce the volume a bit got negative feedback. Unable to talk to a person sitting right next to me. No need of such ambience where shouting is the only way to communicate.
Coming to food quality. Selection of items is nice but taste should improve manifold. Quantity is also very average. Main course dish is barely sufficient for 2 people. 
New variety of food and large selection is highly appreciated but not at the cost of average taste and poor service. Poor hookah can be excused but food quality needs to be Upton the mark. 

Management should improve the quality of food to a great extent.

Brilliant ambience and wonderful decor.
The staff was courteous and the hookah was good as well.Fruit bases and chillums both add to the variety.They haven't started with the alcohol till now but the mocktails,especially the black forest one was amazing.
A must visit
