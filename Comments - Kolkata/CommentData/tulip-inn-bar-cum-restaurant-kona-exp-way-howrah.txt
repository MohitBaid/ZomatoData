Nothing worth mentioning. Its over priced, the dishes were ok kind off, the decor was good as well as the service. Its situated over the highway, so its very easy to locate.

Ambience is good, but service is pathetic. They took almost 30 min to serve us veg & chicken soups. Also everything is overpriced. A pack of cigs costs 200 bucks over there which is available for 100 bucks at outside shops.

It is a bar cum restaurant at kona expressway area. Food is over priced and service is slow though the ambience is good. This place is good for dating purpose.

Place is a Bar Cum Restaurant... But still they maintain a moderate quality in terms of food here. Chicken items are better than average. Fish items are rathar good. Chinese items also we can have here. Must try kababs...

Roadside restaurant, situated on the way to santragachi . ambience is good. Service is little bit slower. Ordered mixed fried rice, chili garlic chicken, chicken varta. Fried rice and chicken varta is good in taste. I don't like their chili garlic chicken. Quantity is good .

Restaurant looks good from outside. But the service is not at all upto the mark. Quality of food is not so good. The worst experience I had was after ordering food it got delivered after 25 mins and how come a restaurant serve biryani only at evening and not in lunch?? Bad experience. Not worth the money..

Located on the Kona Expressway this joint is perhaps the better and more reputedÂ ones amongst the numerous bars dotting the highway. No wonder it is crowded most of the time with patrons visiting from Kolkata after crossing the Hooghly bridge and also by Howrah residents.The place is quite spacious with a garden area sitting and also air-conditioned interiors. The indoor dining area also has cubicles for families, thus offering a tad bit extra privacy.During a recent outing with an old friend to catch up on old times, we decided to try out a new joint beyond city limits. We ordered Tuborg strong beer-Rs 210/-,Peanut masala-Rs 55/- ,Chicken Â Banjara kebab-Rs 170/-,Fish Finger. Prices are no doubt reasonable. However the surprise element was the taste of the food. I mean I had entered the place with minimal expectations on food quality-given the remote highway location. But I was proved wrong. Chicken Banjara was the soft melt in your mouth stuff while the fish finger was prepared from fresh beckti. The rich flavour and aroma of the fish was proof enough of its freshness.Service is attentiveÂ  and staff behaviour is courteous. Do drop in if you want to cool your heels after a long drive.

Not a bad place for a fee friends getting together for a Addams with a few drinks. The choices in Howrah are pretty much limited and this one is one of the decent ones available. Good service ans stock of brands... however they could work on rhetoric starters and side dishes a bit. It seems they ate he'll bent on making every dish spicy and oils beyond normal expectations and palate. The best park of course Ian the location and ample parking space.

This wayside watering hole can get quite noisy on a busy day, not really meant for fine drinking & dining. There are cubicles for large groups. The food is quite alright and good value for money but the place is understaffed. Getting a seat can be difficult in the evening on weekends and holidays.

Tulip is a cool bar cum restaurant by the highway to the connector of kona express way and 2nd hoogly bridge. I love their garden, basically a grassy field, consisting few sitting arrabgements and where you will find some peace. This is far more better than the usual noisy environment of most other bars. Their tandoor items are really good. Chinese are not bad also. I did not yet try their restaurant section but still can say that they serve good foods as i tasted the appetizers. Tulip is a nice place to come with your friends.
