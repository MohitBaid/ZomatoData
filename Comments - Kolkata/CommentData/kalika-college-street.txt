A mouthwatering delight.. the snacks are incredibly tasty in a pocket friendly atmosphere. Fish fingers and fish fries are my favourites but other fries are delicious as well.. Its a must visit for me, everytime I go to college Street.

Though I had first visited this shop in my childhoods and since, umpteenth times it had helped me to revive my taste buds with superb '‡¶§‡ßá‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶æ's!!
Recently, I went there all alone (rare case) walking along Surya Sen Street and thought to take a quick bite!
Had Mutton chop and Mutton Cutlet.. Cutlet was OK but the Chop disappointed me! It was supposed to be a meat ball but was full of mashed potatoes with a little bit meat! üò¢

Location : This place is located near college Square in Surya Sen street.
Food Items Tasted :
- Fish Finger ( Taste was really amazing and the price is really reasonable. For 10 rupees you will get 1 fish finger but that one can make you think of having another.)
- Bhetki Macher Chop ( Less than Average in taste)
- Chicken Chop ( Average in taste)
- Dimer chop ( Taste was really good.)
I would recommend to try the fish finger.

Tried their fish finger, fish fry (bhetki), mutton cutlet and fish chop. The best by far was their fish fry, the masala didn't overpower the bhetki and the fish tasted fresh too. ¬†For me the spices were overpowering the mutton flavour in the mutton cutlet. The fish finger was decent enough and the fish chop contains aloo¬†and masala with just¬†a dash of fish. A must visit if you are craving for some fried delicacies at a reasonable price.

Age old place serving beautiful fried items to give a charm to a calcutta afternoon. A small joint near college street. A special mention about their product because of their thin crumb and full of stuffings unlike most of the places where its just the opposite. Mutton cutlet is worth of mention- tender mutton chunks inside. The winner is the fish chop- great blend of spices and fish. For vegetarians, mocha chop (plantain flower) a must try. In a nutshell, this place will make you come back again and again.

This age old shop has been a part of history. Kalika , located in between College Street  and College Square is a delight to everyone. This is a famous shop selling snacks at a much affordable prize. The list of the delicious snacks goes on like Mutton Chop, prawn chop , Bhetki Mach er fry , chicken cutlet, mutton cutlet  and many more at a very affordable prize. Though the place doesn't have sitting arrangements yet the taste is heavenly. 
This is very cheap. So next time when you r in College Street area , definitely try some delicacies from here.

The most importantly thing for me is that they use good quality oil. so, you'll never end up with any stomach issues like gas,acidity etc. 
And not only good quality oil, they also make very delicious chops and cutlets.

Yesterday evening I went to college Street with brother for buying some books. We had fish fries & alur chop from kalika.

Vetki fish fry: I love fish fris & it was a good one. At 50 rupees you can hardly get one of such quality in other places. 4/5

Alur chop: 3/5

It closes by 7pm at Saturday. We went by 7pm & 2 fish fries & 2 alur chop were all they had. But those were still hot and fresh. Loved the fish fry. Really a good place for having some fish fries and cutlets. Will come back for sure to have many of those.

Located near college square, kalika should have by now become our CMs chop ambassador. Jokes apart, they have been serving chops, telebhaja (fritters) for more than 50 years. They are famous for beguni, aloor chop, phuluri, peyaji, chingri chop, mutton chop, dim er devil, mach er chop, mango chop. You name it, they have it. When in North Kolkata, Kalika is your best bet for an evening snack (cha and telebhaja). Be there early, all of these sell out in a couple of minutes.

Yesterday evening I went to college Street with brother for buying some books. We had fish fries & alur chop from kalika.

Vetki fish fry: I love fish fris & it was a good one. At 50 rupees you can hardly get one of such quality in other places. 4/5

Alur chop: 3/5

It closes by 7pm at Saturday. We went by 7pm & 2 fish fries & 2 alur chop were all they had. But those were still hot and fresh. Loved the fish fry. Really a good place for having some fish fries and cutlets. Will come back for sure to have many of those.

Located near college square, kalika should have by now become our CMs chop ambassador. Jokes apart, they have been serving chops, telebhaja (fritters) for more than 50 years. They are famous for beguni, aloor chop, phuluri, peyaji, chingri chop, mutton chop, dim er devil, mach er chop, mango chop. You name it, they have it. When in North Kolkata, Kalika is your best bet for an evening snack (cha and telebhaja). Be there early, all of these sell out in a couple of minutes.

Quite a famous outlet for chops and cutlet. Had heard a lot about the place so decided to go give it a try. Had mutton cutlet and chingrir chop. I loved the cutlet, it was just perfect. Chingrir chop was ok. Did not find too many chingri though. Would like to give the other food items a try as well.

Yet another historical place for a foodie. It has crossed the golden jubilee. We were strolling on the street and happened to spot this and couldn't proceed leaving it behind. Three of us had ordered - Mochar chop, vegetable chop and fish fry. Price is very very economical and taste is exquisite. They serve it with cucumber and onion salad. The fish fry is crisp with an unique pudina coating. My suggestion: If you happen to pass by do make some place to take a bit into any of their fries on the menu.

One of the well known gem of kolkata which provides lovely Bengali evening snacks. 
Each and every item is tasty.

I had chicken chop and fish fry
I regreted not parcelling more of it. 
The fish fry tasted a bit differently great due to the use to pudina in the marination. 

Sheer love for the food here !!  üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

Ambience is ok, no sitting arrangements.

Staffs are friendly.

Tried mutton chop, chicken chop, Vetkir chop, prawn chop & Mochar chop. All were very tasty , crunchy outside, soft inside with good fillings and less oily .

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

Highly recommended for telebhaja lovers.

Kolkata is well-known for its love for fried snacks, be it 'alur chop' or 'chingrir chop', nothing can satisfy the heart of a Kolkatan than a piping hot 'telebhaja'. 

'Kalika 'is a legendary shop which has been selling fried snacks for 52 years. This place exudes the charm of old Calcutta. 

This shop is located in Surya Sen Street, just beside Nilmani Dutta Road. It is only two minutes from Gunjan Chinese Food. 

I went to Kalika on Monday at 3.15 pm, but the shop was not ready with all the items. I waited for 20 minutes and slowly the items came. They have an ingenious way of keeping the oil content constant in the frying bowl. A small pipe fitted with a tap is attached to a barrel of oil, and the cook controls the oil content by using the tap.

I went for the fish fry(bhetki) first. It was fried properly and was filled with bhetki fillet. It was delicious. Next, I went for the chicken cutlet. This too was a delicious item, it was filled with chicken and herbs and tasted really well with the mustard sauce and salad. Next, I went for the fish fingers. It was filled with fish and was delicious. The fish roll was not available that day, so I was a bit disappointed. Finally, I went for the 'Dimer Devil'. A whole boiled egg was fried in batter. This item was the best item. The exterior was crunchy and the egg tasted delicious with the filling inside. 

The staff was well-behaved and amiable. It was a great experience and I will visit again.

Went their for several occasions, whenever I was in a need to buy books from college street. It's a very popular take away counter for cutlets and Bengali Chops. Tried almost everything from Mochar chop to prawn chop, Fish finger, Vetkir chop, Mutton chop , chicken chop etc. They serve with salad and kasundi which adds fuel to the taste, it's very pocket friendly. One cons is that it's a small counter and one has to eat in a crowdy footpath.

Kolkata is well-known for its love for fried snacks, be it 'alur chop' or 'chingrir chop', nothing can satisfy the heart of a Kolkatan than a piping hot 'telebhaja'. 

'Kalika 'is a legendary shop which has been selling fried snacks for 52 years. This place exudes the charm of old Calcutta. 

This shop is located in Surya Sen Street, just beside Nilmani Dutta Road. It is only two minutes from Gunjan Chinese Food. 

I went to Kalika on Monday at 3.15 pm, but the shop was not ready with all the items. I waited for 20 minutes and slowly the items came. They have an ingenious way of keeping the oil content constant in the frying bowl. A small pipe fitted with a tap is attached to a barrel of oil, and the cook controls the oil content by using the tap.

I went for the fish fry(bhetki) first. It was fried properly and was filled with bhetki fillet. It was delicious. Next, I went for the chicken cutlet. This too was a delicious item, it was filled with chicken and herbs and tasted really well with the mustard sauce and salad. Next, I went for the fish fingers. It was filled with fish and was delicious. The fish roll was not available that day, so I was a bit disappointed. Finally, I went for the 'Dimer Devil'. A whole boiled egg was fried in batter. This item was the best item. The exterior was crunchy and the egg tasted delicious with the filling inside. 

The staff was well-behaved and amiable. It was a great experience and I will visit again.

I would like to say one thing - go try the fish roll. You will forget fine dining and will be lost in that moment in time. Stalwarts of the famed chop-cutlet of Bengal and successfully helping preserving the North-Calcuttan way of life - Chop cutlet muri in the evening. I never miss out on its fare if I am in the vicinity. If you are new to our city, definitely visit this place if you want to experience old fashioned bengali road side food.

Purely over hyped . The 'chops' ( oil cakes) they serve is of horrible quality and taste. It's near to my college and my father being a fan of heritage food joints, asked me to get him some chops from this place. I packed varieties of chops for home and none of them were edible. There are so many other chop sellers selling fresh and tasty chops in the streets of this area. So if you don't believe in Wasting money for bad foods go and explore other roadside chop sellers than visiting this over hyped place.

Kalika...after a long time...I found a shop where they serve authentic 'televaja'...not so call fried..that mean straight from freezers.. To hot oil...their shop is small..but enough variety to choose... Fish finger is yummy...with cucumber and onion salad and kasundi(Bengal mustard sauce)... One more thing.. It is only for 10 bucks...true...mangsho r chop and egg chop nice to eat...all r so pocket friendly... If ur gang is about 4/6 people then 150/ bucks r much enough for a good treat... So...hands down for packet food...hands up for fresh and pure..and also....yummy.........one more thing...egg devil....with full egg...try it....

Kalika is a heritage chop seller in College Street. This shop is standing here for ages. They still have a the same menu and serves the same quality food which made them so popular in Kolkata.
Their Chops are just brilliant. Each of them tastes good. Mochar chop to Chicken Chop or the Prawn Chop they are just fantastic.
Also you can try their Cutlet. It tastes very good.
A very small outlet. There is no place to seat. You have to stand on the road and have their Chops.
Prices are low. And there is full satisfaction in what they serves.

Might be more relevant if you are in the area, have memories associated with this place, or need a quick cheap bite.
To call it a hole in the wall might literally be quite accurate.

And although the food is cheap, and possibly fresh with no storage facilities being apparent and everything being processed right in front of you, it appeared to have only one taste of the salt added over everything after frying. And almost tasteless/flavourless when tried without the same.(or this appeared to be a different version or taste of these popular snack dishes.)¬†¬†

Also the fillings for the same appeared remote and miniscule compared to the coverage and coating on top. However, the shop seemed to be doing brisk business with customers at hand.¬†

This place happens to be quite close to the colleges near College street, college square, and that part of central Calcutta and down the road from Putiram, etc. (when coming from Calcutta University).

This place has been holding a number of memories along my childhood years. I remember the time when i used to cry to my father to buy fish cutlet from here. Gradually as i grew up the quality has gone down a bit but its still commendable and no doubt popular among the college goers and the old people. College street has some notable memories and Kalika is by far the best shop to try the cutlets and the famous 'aloo chop'.

College Street is incomplete without its "telebhaja" shop Kalika. Tried their capsicum and Kashmiri chop. The latter is on the sweeter side but delicious, and the capsicum chop's chillies are hot enough to burn your tongue and throat. Bit spicy - perhaps too spicy for those not accustomed to spicy fast food - but nonetheless Kalika's telebhaja or oil-fried snacks are worth trying at least once. Apart from the typical beguni, aloo chop if you fancy some zingy street food then pay a visit to Kalika.

Going to 'mamabari' ( maternal uncle's house) and not having its snacks is quite unbelievable for me as well for my mother.
Be it nothing or any occassion , one item of the snacks has to be from here.
It opens at 4pm and all the snacks dissapear by 7pm.It was a must for people back in 90's (as my mother says ) that every office goer,college goer stops by n have their chop and muri. And so is now. I cannot resist myself from buying atleast one of them.
I tried their alur chop, beguni, chicken cutlet, fish cutlet,fish finger, mochar chop, bhetki fish chop and almost everything.
Each every item is in good size, with perfect amount of filling mixed with perfect spices and perfect frying. 
If you haven't tried it, its a miss. Try it out!

This is the famous chop shop of college street / surya sen street. One needs super human strength to control the urge of having the fish fry everytime one passes. At least for me that is how it goes. Priced at 30 a piece it is one of the hot sellers out there. The shop starts around 4 pm and is sold out by 7 pm so you get how good they are. All the products are priced with a 0 in the end so that there is no hassle of giving any change. 
The fries are served with a mixed salad and kasundi. 
Must tries are the fish fry, chicken cutlets, mocha chop , chingri chop and beguni.

Visited this place today while i was hanging out with my friends. Since we were hungry so kalika was the pocket friendly destination we chose to gorge on. This is a street side stall with the fries being prepared in front of you.

I had the following items:-

1. Chicken cutlet- big,thick & crisp cutlet with lots of spicy stuffing. The taste was okayish & it was all minced chicken mainly instead of a fillet which was a bit disappointing.

2. Fish fry- This was the star for me. Generous fillet of fish marinated in spicy masala. The outer coating was just crisp & it wasn't overfried. Recommended.

This place offers lots of options to eat & the prices do make this place very popular among the passers by.

Street food lovers and mostly say the televaja lover should visit this shop. The price is little high for a "chop". The quality is now not so good(for those who used to be there since long). But you should taste it. It's good but not for daily snacks.

Kalika is one of the most old evergreen snacks counter of North Kolkata. Even it came on newspapers for few times. This on street chop shop opens for a short period of time at evening & the crowd of College Street jumps over them. They offer a number of chops & cutlets. I tried their Chicken Cutlet this time.

The Chicken Cutlet was big & thick respectability at its Rs. 30 price point. It was very well fried that made it little crispy from outside. Inside fillings were rich & dark. It was filled up with a lots of spices but that didn't made it taste very hot. However I didn't felt any chicken pieces in my mouth. Probably the chicken was mashed or there wasn't much. Provided onion salad & mustard sauce with it was fresh & rich. Overall the cutlet tasted average. Don't expect it to be exceptionally good going by their big name, but do expect good quality food. By the way if your stomach is not that powerful then you may feel acidity after eating their cutlets.

Being in College Street trying Kalika will probably not satisfy your taste bugs but it can give you mental satisfaction that you have tried one of the golden years snacks counter. However their quality is not up to the mark & this higher rating didn't justify in any way.

This is a place about which I heard a lot from dad before I came to college. It's an age old shop located on Surya Sen Street selling fries. The fish finger and fish fries are good but not upto the mark I guess. And earlier they used to sell all chops, from fish to chicken to prawns to vegetables for five bucks each. Now they have increased it to ten. But the quality has degraded for sure. It used to be a regular hangout for me earlier in between classes with my friends. Now a days, we don't go there.

Most of the Bengali love 'telebhaja' and kalika is one of the best place to have telebhaja. I had those so many times and kalika never disappointed me. The most important fact is that they are maintaining consistency. I like Fish fry, beguni,chingrir chop,mochar chop. Due to their popularity every day all of the items get sold. So every day their items are fresh and taste is awesome.

This is a hidden gem. One of the best street food sellers in North Kolkata. Hot, lip smacking "telebhaja" from Kalika is my all-time favourite. All of their items are just superb. Special mentions : Fish Fry, Chicken Cutlet, Fish Roll, Mochar Chop. You would not get better "telebhajas" than this at such a low price anywhere else. I think there's no bangali who would dare to dislike the chop, cutlets served by Kalika. You will get a vintage North Kolkata feeling while you eat those mouthwatering chop and cutlets at the footpath of Surya Sen Street. This is a paradise of traditional street food of Kolkata.

One of the hidden gems for sure. And a street food special. Love their "beguni" and the chops they serve, so many varieties of them and at such a low price. And it's not like the quality of the items are bad, in fact they are very good.

Situated at college street, had heard about this place so much, finally visited it yesterday. Kalika offers a huge variety of "telebhajas" (as we bengalis prefee to call it). 
If you aren't thinking about your calories and you're ready to gorge on some lip smacking snacks then this is the right place for you. 
As a beginner, I tried their signature mutton chop and chicken chop.  Both the chops reminded me of my grandma's recipes. They are very tasty and quite cheap in comparison to what we get in South Kolkata. 
On my next visit I'm definitely going to try the fish roll, fish fry, mochar chop, alu r chop and vegetable chop.

This place is associated with a lot of memories and while growing up this used to be one of the places I'd always ask my parents bring 'chop' from. One of the best in kolkata and although the quality and taste has somehow dropped,i would still rate this place high because even now it can provided a varied fare in 'chop' like no other.
Be it a simple vegetable chop,a moderate fish finger or those lovely chicken cutlet,try anything and you'd not be disheartened. 
And last but not the least the good old 'alur chop' and 'beguni',no one beats central kolkata in that.üò†üò†üò†

Located on the Surya Sen street, this place is open for only 2 to 3 hours.  But in these hours you will never find the footpath in front empty.  The mutton nd prawn chops are awesome Nd so is the fish fry.  And the price is reasonable as well. One can have a real good college square r evening adda with chops from this place;)

It was my first time yesterday and I was blown away by its mutton cutlet and chingri chop. Though I am not a huge fan of chop, but its taste is still lingering in my mouth. They don't have a place to sit, but still its pretty much crowded with people standing on the road and having their cutlets n fries. On the whole, this place gets a thumbs up from me, must visit if you are in college street area.

The bangalee's desire for Telebhaja or batter-fry has been there from time immemorial. And Kalika lives upto the standards of the North Calcutta Telebhaja. The shop is about 50 years old, this is a must visit both for a Kolkatan and the visitor to Kolkata.  But you must turn a blind eye to hygiene to experience this.

Telebhaja remains an average Bangali obsession , so I had to try this out ! Located close to the college street campus of Calcutta University and the commerce department , this chop shop (!) is a five minute walk away from Putiram , and exactly opposite Kalpana Sweets . The chops here are made around 4 pm and are put up on display inside a glass case like relics of an undying passion for street food in Kolkata . The 'chop' is fried in a huge kadai on the left of the shop that boasts its name in bold in Bangla font . The mochar chop here is a must try . The alur chop is larger than average but is a bit too oily for my taste . When I asked about the fish roll they said they've stopped making it due to escalating price of fish!! So I had to make do with the Fish Fry , about which I must say I've tasted better.  The chingrir chop tastes good . The bhetkir chop tasted like a regular fish chop and had nothing special about it . Overall if you're a fan of Telebhaja , this place is a must visit , even if it's only for the mochar chop .

I am a Vegetarian- recently (I am visiting back the place almost after 15 years!!!) had a head-on collision with "Kalika", and could not resist the cravings from bygone days and shedding all inhibitions, tried their Vegetable "chop" & Mochar "chop"...garnished with "Kasundi" (Mustard Sauce) & chopped onions-cucumber...

Didn't feel any digestive complications (whatsoever), I must admit...having the "telebhaja" from Kalika...

For non-vegetarians they have crunchy- fish fries/ Chingri-r chop/ dimer chop/ fish fingers...

Price point- perfectly pocket friendly with an assurance of not expecting any  "post-consumption Gastrointestinal complications" (usually which we always expect and pay no heed,as such, considering the "trauma" as an unwritten rider!!!).

So it's a must try for them who are yet to travel that side of nostalgic Kolkata- 

Long live "kalika"...

On the way from college street to Sealdah, a street side shop, heard a lot about it before. Tried Mangser chop, Chingrir chop and Fish fry. They serve it with salad & kasundi. The price was cheap, but the thing is I didn't find a single piece of meat in 'mangser chop' and no prawn in 'chingrir chop', for me it was like having veg chops in the name of Prawn/meat. The fish fry was good but not that extraordinary. Was expecting a lot from Kalika as I heard about it from various sources, but wasn't satisfied.

This is a well known place for the office goers & college student. They sale variety of chops & cutlets from many years. They claim their  chops & cutlets are unique as they have the brand name of kalika, which has various newly opened restaurants around the Kolkata in recent times, but  I didn't find any unique speciality or special taste into their menu items. Though All the items are of good in quality & matches the standards of other famous chop & cutlets outlets of Kolkata  & serves their various kind of chops  at affordable prices,it's a definitely visit if you are a regular on that locality.

It is located on the right-hand side if you head towards Sealdah from College Street. Being a fast-food lover, it was worth a visit to this place. The items placed in the tray simply made me drool. They were exceptionally big in terms of size. Money-wise, they provide more than enough! The taste made me feel heavenly. To all who visit College Street, I would recommend you to try at least once. You will love it for sure.

Yuppppiiiiiieeee my 100th review .. And that too about kalika, my favourite chop stop.

Uuff uuufff uuuffff what to say about this place's chops.. Out of this world.. I am salivating man!! Give me chops....

Location -- surya sen street..if u r going from college stret take putiram's footpath and walk further towards sealdah. Kalika will be there standing on that very side.

Ambience -- simple chop store divided into two parts. One part has the ready materials and a man is serving and taking the money. The other part is where the chops are deep fried. U will have to have chops standing on the road but who cares ?

Chops -- the best i had in my food journey. Onek sunechilam but when i personally had, it is a notch higher. Crispy, tasty, full of fillings and yummy.

Try it to believe it. Enough said.

This shop was right infront of my childhood friends house. I used to stay hours at his place playing computer games, gossiping, watching movies during school days. The small shop is a hidden gem. Heavily underrated. Locals though do know how great food they serve. They serve all kinds of fries, telebhaja, chop like no other food joints nearby. I'm not saying as being nostalgic about the place, they do have quality stuff here. Do drop by to check out if your nearby. Gosh I miss my highschool days.

New to kolkata, hardly have any grip on Bengali or their geography, so this review comes from the perspective of a newbie. We reached this place, a small stall amidst a crowded street, at 6:30. Most of their preparations were over. The tags for the items were written in Bengali and sensing our helplessness the owner did not care to explain us what's what even though there was hardly anyone else at the stall. We took a fish fry, the only piece left and two fish chop. Both the items were served piping hot with salad and mustard. The fish had a crisp coating with spiced mash potatoes, it was unique and I enjoyed it, but the fish chops weren't that good or else we were served something else on place of it because zomato reviewers have rated them quite highly, beats my understanding! I'd have rated this place higher had the owner been helpful overlooking the ambiance.

Every time I visit the place the mouth watering Egg Devil,Chicken Chop,Beguni,Chicken cutlet , Fish Fry, Meat chop, Fish Finger make me confused and I thought " kakea chere kakea Khabo".

And do carry a bottle of water because after eating one thing over there you will definitely want more.. So, apparently you will feel the thirst.. You can go to Paramount (which is a few minutes walk from there) after having the Telebhaja here...

If you want to have true street food of Calcutta, i.e., chops and fried delicacies then you ought to visit this place. Highly recommended. It's a chop bonanza with so many options and little price that you'll probably want to try their every variant of chops and fries in a visit, if you can stomach it all that is. 
Special mention for the fish fry and 'Beguni' (batter fried brinjal), both of which are simply fabulous for the taste buds but, yea not so good for your cholesterol. Cheers.

Calcutta Cuisine is incomplete without street food like - Maccher Chop. One of the oldest & finest shops to sell chop. Quite easy on the pocket too. A must visit if you are looking for a evening snack.

This shop selling chops is an absolute delight.

The prices are damn low and you can keep having them as much as you want,because they are good,but mostly because they are priced so low.

You can try out almost every item(which itself is a few) with Rs 100/-.

The chops are quite good,and you can have them hot because they sell out like hot cakes.

The name itself is enough! I had fish fry, Chicken cutlets here! I lived the policy here: No advance order! Wait till u get the fresh hot fries coming out of the Kadai! Sometimes u may have to stand in queues because of the popularity and the short interval for which they serve, but all said and done, you wont b disappointed!

We are bangali...so we do have a congenital affection for telebhaja...and so  kalika is there to quench our thirst for telebhaja...being a student of Hindu school and Mck I have visited this place numerous times...now review part
1.Ambience,Reception,Service-its a roadside telebhaja stall...so....
2.Food-best in its class
3.Price-no comments..
If you lives in Kolkata and specially you are a north Kolkata resident and you haven't have kalika s telebhaja dn sorry to say that you are not bangali..so to earn your bangali title go and have telebhaja of kalika...

Well if you are a kolkatan, a bong and you have'nt visited this place yet then please do.... for the love of telebhaja you inherited being a bong...
Visiting the place since my childhood...Even my mother loved this place from her college days...

So one can guess how old the place might be...

It's like the mecca for telebhaja lovers... everything they make is superb...
My personal favourites are Chicken cutlet, Fish Fry, Fish Finger, Chingry Chap, Bhetki Chap.....

I'm sure just one visit would make anyone a fan of this place....

Currently the most renowned shop for tele-bhaja or chops in kolkata, rather biggest also. i have tried all the items available here. i am visiting this place since i was in school. when i used to go college street for any purpose, kalika's chop was my always choice. even during the puja also, i did not miss this one. 

Regarding food, i would say all the items are quite good, but cutlet and fish chops can be counted among the best ones. but considering all these goods, i got few observations:
1. in the evening, there used to be a huge crowd in front of the shop, but their management is not so effective, may be due to less number of staffs.
2. please visit this place with exact amount or balances, else u may have to argue with the cashier. i am really not sure that they get enough balances everyday, but still they are reluctant to give it to the customers.
but still if you are a tele-bhaja lover, i would must suggest to visit kalika to feel the heritage kolkata...

Realised once agian - old is gold. Heard a lot abt this joint from my father who spent his childhood in clg street, but I consider myself unlucky that it took so long to have the first bite of their divine mutton cutlet. This place is on surya sent street, very near to paramount sherbet n Putiram Misti shop.
Now come to bizness - the cutlet was authentic n made me fell in love with the Old North Calcutta Cuisine for the umpteenth time. It was a true mutton cutlet, yes it was a mutton cutlet by heart n soul where the tiny minced muttons dominated, not some hybrid ones where potato was key n mutton plays guest appearances.
Lastly, I gave it 3.5 as I tasted only mutton cutlet n certain to re-rate it high soon.

P.S: if you like to taste the chops, fries, n cutlets visit early. I was there @7:30pm n they r left with only 5 cutlets.

I  had  tasted  Kalika'a  Fish  Fry  at  a  food  festival in  Salt  Lake  City  Center... I  had   heard  about  the  legacy of Kalika's fries  ,  cutlets and  chops  ,  but  have  to  say  was  quite disappointed  with  the  food  I  tasted  that  day! The  fist  fry   was  not   up to  the  mark... the  flavour  was  clearly  lacking  and  the  batter   was quite  hard! I  had  thought  probably  it  was  due  to  the  festival  rush  ,   but   a  few  days  later   my  dad  was  in  the  area  of   their  shop  and   he   tried  a  chop   and  was  equally  disappointed ! So they  definitely   need  to  improve  their  food ,  which  is  definitely  detoriating  nowadays  in  order  to  retain  their  goodwill and  customers!

Being a student of near-by college, I was a frequent goer of kalika. Man! talk about their cutlets. I've tried all chops and cutlets. Among those, chingri chop was best. Chicken cutlet was another good one. Vetki chop was also good. 

Want to go back again and again.

P.S : Go with well dressed girls. You will get advantage in the queue. Just joking, but literally it is a big deal to collect your portion from that highly demanded , over crowded 'televajar dokan'.

This is one of the famous north kolkata heritage point. Whenever relatives came to our house , for a quick evening snack we would have visited this shop.

These days also if I am visiting college square for any reason , this place is a must stop for me. Chop specially the veg ones are really very good. 

The only downside is the service is very slow as this place is always very crowded.

One of the best tele bhaja shops in Kolkata is ‚ÄòKalika‚Äô at Surya Sen Street. Yesterday evening me and my friend gave a visit after a long time. For entrees we had the Vetkir Chop and the Mutton Cutlet and both were excellent and came out HOT! The vetki was so smooth & soft no effort needed, just melt in our mouth and the mutton cutlet had loads of mutton in it! We also decided to have Chingrir Chop and it was excellent too! My friend going nuts over original nostalgic taste of tele bhaja that his grandma used to make. Feels like a winner, you will never be disappointed.

I've heard a lot about the legendary 'tele bhaja' establishments of North Kolkata. So getting to sample one of them directly was a long time coming. Located near College Street, it's on Surya Sen Street or in other words, a few houses down from the local Municipal Borough office. It's almost as old as the faded, crumbling buildings around it. And they just get better with age. :) 

They make a range of 'Chop's along with mutton, chicken and fish cutlet. The fish finger is extremely popular to say the least. The small menu coupled with the low prices gives you the chance to savor nearly all the items in maybe even a single visits.  We had the Chingrir Chop, Vetkir Chop, Egg Chop and Fish cutlet. The 'Chop's were all perfectly fried and the sizes were satisfactory. The Bhetki and Chingri pieces were properly pre cooked. There's one thing which hits you every time you put something in your mouth is the sheer taste. This is the way it's supposed to be made.

The shop is nothing but a large extended ledge on the ground floor of a building situated on the main road. Being an immensely popular establishment, there's always a crowd waiting and getting jostled by the pedestrians on the sidewalk. The wait time however, is only as long as it takes to put your order in a paper bag. The yummies are being made round the clock and served hot direct from the kadhai. I do wish there were at least one chair to sit. 

Chakraborty Tip : Although they hold impeccably high standards for the 'chop's they make, customer satisfaction or politeness is not their forte. Do not be put off by the two grumbling, scowling old men who man the counters and run the establishment. Accept them as part of the charm of the old city and remember to ALWAYS GIVE CHANGE !!

Kalika- as the name suggests it is a traditional, ordinary and pretty non-attraction-drawing shop on Surya Sen Street. However,  once one tastes the 'telebhaja' there, all ordinariness simply evaporates and a saliva laced tongue hangs out of sheer awe at the taste and punch of the various kinds of deep fried fare that is available. The Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet is just too good to resist but the Vegetable Chop, Mochar Chop and Mutton chop is a revelation. The shop sits a little higher than the pavement and the frying is done right in front of everyone. There is a wooden show case with a glass front and neat aluminium trays inside for the different fries. The food is served in ordinary newspaper "thongaa" with a generous sprinkling of salt. One has to stand in front squeezed between the shop front and the passers by on the narrow pavement and wait for the stuff to be served.   The shop is a great way to experience and unravel the old north Calcutta ambience and ethos.

Kalika is a part of me growing up and waiting in lines for them to start frying their famous mangsher chop or chingrir chop. The chingrir chop actually flies off the kadai, the moment they are dropped on the platter, a man works quickly to give it to the hungry hogs waiting outside. Besides these ones which are Kalika's specialty, the place also makes one of the best bhetkir chop and fish fry in that region, and I have been guilty of eating from them, savoring each bite with the cool salad of shredded cucumbers. Just make sure you get there by 5 to get most of the stuff on the menu, and be prepared to queue on the road and scream out your order.

Kolkata can be branded as the telebhaja capital of the world and this joint is no less than a landmark in the telebhaja world. My fathers is a regular here and it is through him that I was introduced to the marvel of the fish roll . Ooh the gingery fish roll with a super thin fillet wrapping the filling and just so light and not at all fishy to smell . 

Another brilliant thing here are the chingri / prawn chops which people actually queue up for. I also like the mutton chops and the mocha chops as well 

they are very generous with the cucumber salad they serve. although I would like some onions . the fish finger and the fry are brilliant too . I cant stop eating at one .

overall a place I have actually grown up over. Simply mind blowing

Another heritage from north calcutta, as with time most other so called godfathers of "telebhaja" joints are disappearing like their biggest rival "banik", and few oldies like netaji (laxmi narayan saw) and kalika are still twinkling, calcutta is probably changing its palate. Still, if you get a chance to visit kalika during evening, you may understand why they are called a heritage joint, and try their "mocha", "bhetki" and "chingri" r chop, you may also understand how foolish we bengali are, not to put these on global gourmet (like mumbai did their vada pav), but, simply shutting down our long enriched street snacks. BTW, look at their price, and sometime I feel, maybe, they are a non profit organization. A must try, with some street tea too.

Kalika is not just any other street food outlet but a legacy which is still continuing. Its way beyond the rest of its counterparts. It started during the early 19th century and is still going on. My grandfather and dad in their days used to have from this legendary place. They first had started with their traditional Bengali bhajias like beguni (brinjal chop) and aloo chop. Later on they had moved to non veg items and also they serve some veg items. Prawn, bhetki, mutton, chicken and vegetable chops and cutlets are available here. Not a single day you would find this place is not crowded during the evening time. In fact after 7 pm you would not find any stuff to have. Price is quite moderate considering the taste of the dishes they provide. My favorite is are the fish rolls, fish finger and the bhetki chop. Thumbs up Kalika looking forward to have more and more different hot shots from this place.

This shop has been here for ages and probably hasn't changed much for the last 40 odd years. A shop not for the health or calorie conscious,if you're looking for authentic bengali street food ,one should look no further. The sheer variety is mindboggling, from humble piyaji(batter fried onions) and beguni(batter fried brinjal slices), there are the now hard to find mochar chop. One might have to wait a bit for their favourite chops,considering that a fresh batch is sold of in minutes. One should surely try the chingri(though the prawns are getting harder to find,understandable at the prices), fish roll and chicken cutlet. The shop opens in the afternoon and most of it is sold out by 7-8pm, so one does have to plan their trip accordingly.

As for the taste,they are good,crispy,full of taste and piping hot. And yes for the chicken n the fish chops one does find good amount in them unlike a lot of other places. All in all ,a wonderful place if you love chops n cutlets.
