Ha ha .. i am amazed to have this on zomato.. this shop provides the best biryani in belghoria area .. i had been to this place many a times and had the biryani.. the chap is also good ..
If One wants to have a good quality biryani at a reasonable price then he /she must visit this place...

Sorry guys i recently visited this place .... Yhe biryani is dummed.,.. worst than ever, quality reduced to 0 for no reasons please visit some other place....

Small.. Dirty.. Tap water served for drinking purposes. Cheap like nothing. The rice they use is not biryani rice actually. Cooked at a very dirty place-I have seen it. Come to this place if you want to compromise on health.

Cheap biriyani. But not tasty. Sometimes i think how they named themselves xpert . Go only if you have no anyother option but you badly want biriyani. Just kolkata  foothpath quality biriyani you will get here.

This place is in Rathtala more near kamarhati municipality. We only had chicken/mutton biriyani here. And the quality is quite good for ₹ 70/-
