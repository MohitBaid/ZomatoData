I was disappointed vising this place. Nothing special in the menu. Normal cooking. It costs too much for its ambiance I think.
Only bengali foods available. They have ordinary menu and cooking with extraordinary price. In my life for first and last time I ate 'beguni' each cost rs 20. Can you imagine ?

Well will not suggest anyone ti go to this place for having bengali food , it better to go saptapadi opposite to this or tero parbon, rhe food is pathetic there is no difference between a polao and plain rice , only polao is bit yelowish thats all and have two three kaju, mutton kassa is cold not tender dry after delivering the order after 1 hour we placed the order, this rating is only for topsey fry , blackberry misti doi and the staffs

If you like stale food, pathetic service, little option for tasteless food during durga puja 2017... this is the place for you. Seating is comfortable... thats the only thing.

Nice ambience & the staff are also friendly. But the main problem is they lack adequate space as comapred to the other top rated Bengali Cuisine restaurants. Overall its good & the food pricing is also decent.

Worst Quality, Bad Quantity, I don't know who's the chef, he don't know how to cook Chicken Kasha, Prawns are not well cooked. Plastic is floating in Dal. Pictures are shown to us totally different. Chicken Pieces are too small. Rs. 190 for chicken meal & 230 for prawn meal + service tax & packing charge extra. Anyways bad experience. I just want to kill the chef & the management of this Restaurant. Indian Railways serve better combo than this Restaurant.

No good, ordered fish fry there was only crust and no fish, a total loot for the price they charge, plus delivery executive kept asking address details in spite of everything being given already, ilish bhapa too spicy and no good as well, first and last order here, if you want to waste your money then this is the place for you.

We had a lunch today at Jhale Jhole Ambole Bengali restaurant. It's been a tragic movie here. Knowing that renowned restaurants "Tero Parbon" and "Saptapodi" located at stone throw distance with this kind of pathetic food and service they can't survive.

Quantity : Poor
Quality : Horrible
Service : They don't know what it is.
Price : On higher side
Feedback : When I said it's not good experience being here The Manager said can't do anything bluntly.. ("‡¶ï‡¶ø‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶õ‡ßÅ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡ßá‡¶á".).

What we ordered
- ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶¶‡¶æ ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶§
- ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡ßÄ ‡¶™‡ßã‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶â

- ‡¶ï‡¶∑‡¶æ ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡¶ó‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶∏

- Sada bhat, Topse fry, aloo bhaja, beguni and kinley water are good there.

We thought to explore here but it exploded. If you want to spoil your day during lunch or ruin your evening during dinner please visit. Also if you want to take a revenge with someone please take him/her on Jhale Jhole Ambole.

Visited this place on shashti and I had expected a queue to be awaited oustide because that's generally what happens in that area.
However, we didn't even have to wait for a little while. Found our seats immediately. The ambience is very homely. And staff good too. 
Ordered basmati pulao, phool kopi r dalna and chicken kasha. We were 3 of us and we had to take 3 plates of pulao as the quantity was less. Phool kopi well made and chicken kasha was amazing, 3 pieces of chicken wasn't satisfactory as per the quantity. 
A good experience overall. They should do something about the quantity for that price.

With my family we went for dinner yesterday night.¬† Ambiance was optimal and bengali. Staff behavior was really nice. Music quality was good, moreover sound level was adequate.
We ordered kaju kismis pulao, peas pulao, doi chicken, chicken kasha and mutton kasha. Every item tasted good. All of us liked it. Surely try Dhaki luchi next time. Had a good dinner.

Was in a mood for some bengali food so decided to grow in on a rainy afternoon.  Had ordered a Bhekti paturi as well as a bhapa  chingri... 

The place was empty and is actually huge.  Split on two levels,  the decor is simple and the staff is well behaved.  

The paturi was made with a non grainy mustard and very sharp and pungent,  nothing like the average mellow paturi.  I quite loved the flavor.

The bhapa chungri,  the tate of yogurt was very prominent and  with a characteristic nutty flavor.  Prawns were fresh and sweet.  

Overall had a great time.  Since we were alone,  we got all the attention.  Staff was warm and food cane fast.  

Will visit again soon

If you are craving Bengali food, this place is a good choice. Their Gondhoraj Crispy Chicken and Aam Doi are simply to die for.I also liked their Basanti Pulao and the Ilish Bhapa. The portions served are also quite generous.

So it was the eve of Poila Baisakh (benagli new year) and my Honours exam too got over that day.,hopped in with dad to this place at Hindustan Park to treat our bengali cuisine cravings. Being an eggitarrian doesnt leave me with much options at places popular for authentic fish and chicken dishes . Nevertheless , I went for vegetarian ones . We ordered jeera rice, sonaar moong daal,aloo posto bhaja,dhokaar daalna and my dad on my much insistence ordered begun pabda for himself . The jeera rice although less in quantity was great in quality, the aloo posto bhaja was awesome and new to me since we dont eat posto in roasted form. Sonaar moong daal was perfect with jeera rice. But the dhokaar daalna bagged away my heart . It was delicious, just like how my grandma makes. My dad said the begun pabda was also fresh and beautifully prepared. Overall we both were very impressed by the decor,the hospitality, the service,the food. Do visit this uniquely named place Jhaley Jholey Ombole. They wont let you down. Perfect place for family get togethers on any occasion.

Welcome drink was served halfway through our meal.
Not recommended for dining on special occasions.  Staff are trained to manage roadside eateries , though not the high end ones.

off late i have been developing serious love for the bengali food and try to check out the places which is been unexplored. my quest for this unseen passion took me to this restaurant located at hindustan park the other day. and here i am sharing my experiences....

Location: From gariahaat, drive towards triangular park, take a left and immediate right. drive like 2-3 minutes and at your right side, just on the main road...

Food: Features mostly begali delicacies within the reasonable price range. also have few continental selection. we checked in at around 10.30 pm and told that continental is closed and only begali food they can serve. they were hardly occupied and we saw a group of people leaving after having their dinner. we ordered in hurry. Mutton kosha, steamed rice, green salad and basket of papad.

Service: Attentive staff, eager to help. not well in conversation but you will find that honesty in their effort. service was quick.

Ambience: They have a made a upper deck kind of thing within the dinning area. it add to the overall charm of the restaurant. there were paining across the wall and rabindro sangeet was playing. overall feel was quite impressive.

we were not disappointed. hope you wont either..

2. Basanti polau - bengali yellow polau consist with kaju,kissmiss n sweetness.good quality of basmati rice with every kind things whatever used in polau there.
 3. Mutton dakbanglow - very good kind of dish.parts of mutton inside of the dish,very thick gravy mutton cooked well n soft too.i love this dish speacially.
4. Chicken curry - this dish very bad chicken was very hard to eat the juicyness was gone.after bitting it.it's like nothing there.i was thinking this dish must be a good one disappoint me totally.
5. Coke - after keep on asking them several times later they served the drink.
====================================
[Service]
I went there with a huge expectations but very disappointed.pathetic service even for a glass of water keep on asking n asking.not only in our table others too complaining infront of us about their service.sometimes salt missing sometimes some other things.service is one of the main thing which need to be change.

We went there to celebrate bijaya with Bengali Cuisine, the staff were very very friendly we had kids with us so they helped us in every way to make them comfortable. We ordered pomfret fry, Basanti pulao, Bhapa Ilish, Kosha Mangsho and Chingri Malakai, all the foods were good. The place is little costly but will worth your money. 
Suggestion : They should seriously think about upgrading the interior design.

The ambience of the place screams of a lot of improvements to be done. The walls were damp and the whole place smelt a bit damp even though it was not rainy season. Anyhow, I ordered a lot of dishes on the menu. The menu itself is a bit short leaving out drinks and starters (except machh bhaja) completely. The food was good though. All items including hilsa, mutton, chicken and side dishes like postp bhaja and sukto was good as well. The restaurant is supposedly budget friendly as first glance. However the rice and daal quantity is one per plate strictly as we had to eventually order multiple rice plates later.
Must have item here: Aam doi which mango puree over standard aam doi. Its good.
Overall experience. Good food, however a lot of improvements are required.

Did anyone say bengali food? Here i am. Jhaaley Jholey Ombole has the capability to beat some costly bengali restaurants in town. Do avoid going there during poila baishak or durga puja, because they totally get confused about what to do next, i suggest this for every bengali restaurant. If you go there then do try bangali polao with chingri-r malaikari and mutton kosha.

My God, what a unprofessional place. Wailers to his boss have no knowledge how   the other bengali cuisine based restaurants are serving. We visited there out of compulsion on poila baisakh as the other restaurants on that road were overpouring. First of all half the items  on the menu card were unavailable. Secondly you have to wait for eternity. Thirdly when the food comes you will be suprised as how they have changed them on their own as some are again unavailable. Fourthly  cholar dal was mixed with some other left over dal as you can see the grains. Fifhly you will get small chicken pieces in mutton kasha if you order it. I think they cook chicken and mutton kasha together and serve them as per demand. Lemon and green chillies are not served on the table, maybe you will be charged if you ask for. The climax is there's no system of finger bowl on the table but you have to climb a wooden staircase and hunt for a toilet to wash your hands! Ahem.

Will start with a comment "its a curse to have Bengali food here". People normally go out for folding to enjoy but not to repent..its a place where service is awful... Food is equally awful...when u try to give a suggestion about the service quality and food to the owner....he comes with some arrogant answers...may be a typical attitude of not open for any feedback...
Guys don't waste your money here...or your precious time, if you a looking for a good time or food...
Simply to suggest....not very far away from closing down...Jhale Jhole Ombole...u r simply a nuisance.

Visited this place during the Durga Puja's in 2014. Good food, good quality and good quantity too. All this in a very good ambiance and at a very reasonable & competitive pricing.

A decent place to eat. Was here with my family, ordered some daal, shukto, aloo bhaja, beguni, pomfret fish and katla fish, and ofcourse rice. Can't say it was excellent, but fairly good and better than several other places which belong to the same price group. However, there is scope for improvement.

This was the only place in soith Kolkata which I haven't tried and hence decided to drop in. The initial surprise of lack of crowd was soon explained when the food was served. We were two of us and we ordered a fish, a mutton and a rice. The fish was stale and the mutton was neither soft nor of any taste. The food was definitely not woth the money, oe any money for that matter.

It was pleasant a surprise to find a restaurant which was NOT overcrowded during the durga puja saptami evening, that too, near Hindusthan Park.

Without a second thought my entire family stormed in and ordered Luchi, Cholar Dal and Mutton Kosha.
Very good food, though i wish the three mutton pieces given per plate were consistent - one was big while the other two were literally tiny. 

The washroom was pretty small and congested due to the huge crowd on their 'Pujo dinner'.
But I did like the simple ambiance and spread-out layout of the place. Planning to give the other dishes a try very soon.
Three and a half stars from me.
 :)

After finding too much rush in several other nearby eateries we went into this food joint on Purna Das road for a Puja special lunch which had a special (or rather customized for Puja) menu. Here we didn't have to wait, maybe we were at the right place at the right time! We got the table straightaway and after we placed the order the food came real fast. But let's quickly go through the ambiance first. To me it was strictly okay with maintenance necessary in couple of places, though I found the place is not cramped which is a good point surely. The puja-special menu did not carry a huge variety of options but I guess it was designed to¬†save these days in the best known way, list those items which you can serve. I guess those items in the menu were all available and were not just included in the menu to make it look nice and long. Our food was served maybe within 10 mins, which is really awesome. We had ordered for rice, alu bhaja, shona mug dal, bhetki paturi, chicken kosha. All the items tasted above-average with the chicken kosha really standing out, a must try, it reminded me of chicken dak banglo of Bhajohori, the dish had 3 chicken pieces which were very tender and well cooked. The bhetki paturi could have been tad better and softer, but still it was good. They served real quick and we were all done well within 30 mins, that's real quick. The waiters were all kinda well prepared for the Puja special stress testing. Nice place to try out. The prices are moderate during pujas, not as low as it is indicated in zomato, but not very high as well, the lunch for two came to nearly 1300/- (but it was w/o any dessert). Cheers!

This restaurant has been set up in the posh locality of purna das road, a road which boasts of numerous other restaurants including some noted bengali chains like Sholo Ana Bangali and Tero Parbon. Me and my family went to Jhale Jhole Ambole and found the interiors pretty with a warm staff. One item i would like to highlight was the Chingri Macher Malai Kari which was one of the best i have had in my life. The promfret fry also deserves a thumps up!! All in all you you can try this one out once and i dont think you would be disappointed
