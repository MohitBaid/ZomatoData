I went there with a bunch(read 12) friends and had mainly the combos.... So I will write the pros and cons of each.....
1. The biriyani/chaap/kabab combo : I guess it's one of their most ordered platter and I thought the biriyani was fine...the kababs we're succulent but that day the chaap tasted like onion paste without any other spices and tempering...
2. Fried rice combo was good....the fried rice was a bit bland...both the chicken dishes were fine but I didn't get the point of the vegetable thing...it's just boiled vegetables in a cornflour mixture with a bit of soya sauce...that tasted like a thick and bland soup....

Overall the ambience is nice, though the waiters are a bit blah but a really pocket friendly destination for students and everyone alike :(

This restaurant is famous from my school
and college days. Firstly the restaurant was located at southern avenue, was small and you have to wait for your turn and was famous for its pocket friendly combos mainly for school and college goers. I mostly had Chello Kebab combo and Chicken Biriyani Combo. The quantity is enough for one person at this price and also the quality is too good at this price. Apart form this two combo, you will get many other combos like North Indian combo, Chinese Combo and also al-a-carte menu. 

Now, the outlet has shifted to Lake Market, just behind Lake Mall at Parasar Road. This outlet is too big, but also could not accomodate the quests and please expect a waiting time of at least 45 mins when you are planning to have lunch or dinner at this restaurant.

Chello Kebab combo contains a good portion of rice with butter. Four Chicken Shami Kebab with veggies and two mutton sheek kebab, and an egg poach. Also salad is served with this. Enough for one person.

Chicken biriyani combo contains a good portion of biriyani rice along with one piece chicken, one egg and one potato. Along with this you will get two pieces of chicken tikka kebab and chicken chap one piece. Salad along with this.

You will just enjoy your food. Also, you can opt for take away. 

I will visit again.

Its our go to place from college.. Its recently changed its location.. Previously it was situated near southern avenue..
Location - Take the lane beside lake mall amd walk straight for 2-3 min and u can find it on ur right side.
Ambience - Too crowded always because of its cheap rate.. The behavior of the staffs are good but recently i saw some of the stuff who behavee little weirdly.. Decoration is good.. There are gramophone and books and little vintage feeling.. Over all good place to hang out with friends.
Food-
Biriyani Combo- A plate of biriyani with two chicken kababs and one plate of chicken chaap.. Biriyani quantity is less and taste is average. And i personally didn't like the chicken chap.. But ky friends liked it
Chicken Sizzler Combo- You can customize it.. U can have bread or rice with the chicken sizzler.. Its my fav dish of tandoor house and maybe i jave tried for 6-7 times still i love it.. They serve it with poached egg and veggies.. Soft chicken.
Pocket Pinch- the biriyani combo costs 120 and the sizzler costs 180..so its very very cheap but great in taste so u should go and try..

Today,we ordered a Kebab Combo...the kebabs were cold,broken and tasted almost same(disastrous). They were not even of a appropriate proportion!The plating or garnishing was disgusting!Next we ordered Badshahi pulao combo which was unavailable. So we had to order a chicken biryani combo. The chicken in the biryani was yuck...!!! If you are a biryani lover...Don't even think about Tandoor House!!!! Though the pocket-pinch is less, but it doesn't worth a single rupee!!! Very much disappointed!!!!

Tandoor House is a place to visit if you have a tiny pocket to deal with. The staff is really great. The ambience and the decor is something to keep your eyes on, some old is gold kinda feeling rushes in. Coming to the food, you will get a variety of options for combos, chelo kebab,  biryani, shahi pulav. Thought once when I tried out their kebabs, the amount of salt was too much in it, would definitely like to advice them to keep an eye on the amount of salt being given and be more careful.

Location - it was located just behind Lake mall.  It takes 10 mins by walk from the metro station. It was easy to identify. 
Ambiance -  a two storey building decorated with mirrors, posters &  old looking lightings.  We were seated on the 1st floor.  Seating arrangements are too congested. 
Food- we ordered special dum biriyani chicken, normal chicken biriyani &  chicken wings kabab. Biriyani was OK for me &  the quantity was enough for 2.  It contain 2 pieces of chicken and one egg at jst for 150. The chicken wings kebabs at just 70 was so tender &  cooked to perfection &  I loved it. 
Overall it was a good food day at a very pocket friendly price.  Loved it, total value for money and would definitely visit again

We've been going to this place for quite a long time.. but never faced such harassment before... went there on the 1st day of the year... and took Chicken Biriyani combo and Royal De Combo... the second one was good but the chap with Biriyani combo was not at all fresh... it was literally smelling... but when we asked to replace the dish they started to argue and kept on saying that chaps should taste like these... finally after a 10 mins of argument they replaced the chap... even the quantity of the biriyani was quite low comparing to the ones we have had before...
The stuff has always been very rude.. and doesn't look professional... though the food here is very cheap but they should do something about the stuff and the quality of the food...

This is the best low medium budget restaurant near to rasbehari- gariahat area.. prices are comparatively less than other restaurants. Quantity is okay..
But food quality should be increase a little.
But compare to its price it's good enough.
No other restaurants can give chicken biriyani combo ( biriyani, egg, chap, 2 Reshmi kebab) @120 only.

I ordered 1 chi biriyani combo, 1 rajshahi pulao combo, and 1 Reshmi kebab. The bill was only 389/ ..

Don't order so much foods If u r ordering biriyani combos. It's well enough for 1 person.
Nice hospitality and staffs behaviour polite.
Value for money. 400 for 2 people approx.
So, if u searching for a low medium budget restaurant I will recommend to this.

It was a long time back possibly in '14. We visited this place after a day long adda at Maddox. The three of us were hungry as hell and we craving for something meaty! My love for Mughlai Food goes way back to the 90's. Anyway, coming to the point, I didn't click much. Back in the day I wasn't so photo enthusiast neither was I a Zomato fanatic. So you see you'll have to be satisfied with just the bare minimum!¬†

This restaurant has 3 floors, you will generally have your food on the 1st floor. It's well decorated, both the dining area and the stairs. There are tables for 2, 4 and 8 people. There is a yellow LED bulb above each table. That adds on to the decor. The place is always filled up as it's very popular. The behavior of the waiters and staffs working here are decent too.

Now coming to the "real" deal, we took Chicken Biryani Combo , Chicken Pulao Combo & Naan with Chicken Reshmi BUutter Masala. These were enough to stuff our bellies! The quantity of biryani was sumptuous. Pulao was equally filling too! But coming to the quality, may be because of the relatively cheap price back then, it's not up to the mark. The chicken pieces as I remember (faintly) were good. The Naan was a disaster though! Lastly, chicken reshmi butter masala was a huge portion, one of us had to parcel it. I do wish to try their sizzler combo someday!¬†

This place would definitely be the first choice for college students who are on a budget and are bored with the regular canteen meal. The location is appropriate, the price is appropriate and the taste is definitely better than the canteen food!! :p

If a Restaurant improves its decor and location, does it needs to degrade the quality of the food it serves?

This was my second visit to this restaurant, and I was disappointed with the quality of food which it served. Previously the location was near the southern avenue swimming club, now it has shifted behind Lake Mall.¬†

The decor of this place has improved a lot, it gives an impression of modern dining restaurant with a bit of old Calcutta theme into it. The restaurant has a good strength of staff, and always ready to assist whenever required.¬†
This is probably the only restaurant in Kolkata which provide great combos at such a reasonable cost (rather cheap).¬†

Items Ordered: 1 Plate Chicken Wings Kebab & 3 Plates of Biriyani Chicken Combo (which includes 2pc of chicken seekh kebab, 1pc Chicken Chaap & the Biriyani includes 1pc Egg & 1pc Chicken & 1pc of Alu with some soaked vinegar onions)
Beverage: 3 Glass of coke
Pocket Pinch: Rs.578 (Including GST)

The Chicken wings were pretty good, as the chicken was very juicy and tender. While the Biriyani was not upto the mark at all, quantity was very less, it lagged the pure essence of the great subtle use of spices combined with ghee, and the biriyani alu (potato) was under-cooked, raw on the inside. Chicken chaap was alright, only the piece of chicken was pretty small.¬†

This restaurant served excellent combo dishes of great quality & quantity, previously when I visited it (1 year ago). But alas, a restaurant which provides such great combos at such a cheap rate, what more do you expect from it.¬†
Cost for two: Rs.350 approx (Including GST) if you are going for combo meals & Rs.600 approx (Including GST) if you are going for regular platters.

If this restaurant improves the quality of the food, which it had previously, it will indeed be a 'GEM' for budgeted foodies in Kolkata.

This time, it was the Lake market outlet.
We entered with a coupon which had a table no. marked on it. I couldn't really make out what was that till that time when we were pointed out to a specific table that didn't suit our choices. Now guess, whats coming next.
Obviously.
I went downstairs to switch our table no. and got to our intended seat.
So, this part of my party time is known as "freedom to question".
I ordered a "Badshahi Pulao combo" and my friend, a "Mutton Biryani Combo".
Coming to my dish, it constituted of :-
1) Chicken lasuni kebab 2) Chicken Reshmi masala 3) Chicken Tikka masala 4) Chicken Pulao
Each had their respective hints of taste. The pulao was awesome, the tikka masala was a perfectly cooked dish and the kebabs were also mouth-wateringüòõüòãüòã. Even the reshmi masala was good too. Just for the size of the pieces of chicken in the reshmi platter ....üòßüòßüòß(forced me for a 4-star review this time).
My friend had the mutton biryani combo. The pieces in his platter were also big and succulent.
Well, we exchenged a piece of our kebabs. The kebab in the mutton biryani combo also glided through my taste buds, through my joyful food pipe and then to my heart.
This part of our meal was "freedom to experience good food" üòÅüòÅüòÖüòÖ.
Just when it was all to end, my piece of kebab proved out to be undercooked at few (very few)places. (I showed it to their staff later).
Oi tuku chole, tai toh ?  Afterall,,,
........"To err is human"......
N.B____
The food stil lacked that "craving temperature". It wasn't complaining though. But still, if the manager is reading this part of my meal , which was "upset of service", then he should look into the matter ; coz its the second time we had the problem of the temperature of the food.
That's all. Maaan!! AAR KOTO LIKHBO !!!üòÄüòÄüòÑ
Hit a like, if you had enjoyed going through my experience.
(Sorry, for not having the photos. Actually, were lost out in the food.üòêüôäüôè)

Visited here this afternoon.

We ordered chicken biriyani combo and chicken reshmi cheese  kabab.

They served everything cold. When complained they said that we should ask them for doing it. Cheese in kabab was stale and some pieces in biriyani chaap too. Tandoori chicken in combo were under cooked. The staffs when complained about food argued with us instead of any apologize.

It was really bad experience and would never visit again. And not even recommending. Would like to rate it in negative.

This Eatery is located near lake mall. One can easily come to this restaurant as it is near to the metro station. 
Look and Feel - the interiors are quiet impressive . With brickwork, quirky paintings and aristocratic lighting
Food- I ordered for Special mutton biriyani , chicken tikka masala , salad . One full handi was enough to fill a person. Moreover the special mutton biriyani handi here has 2pieces of mutton and once piece of egg just  for 150 bucks . >Taste - the biriyani was dry .but the quantity was enough so it's completely value for money food . The chicken tikka masala was perfectly seasoned tender succulent meat . Overall the meal was good . Please do give it a visit.
Service - this place is  crowded all the time and I found only 2 people appointed for serving the customers which wasn't enough to look at 15-16 tables approx . They need to appoint more staffs to run the place smoothly.

Also had a badshahi pulao combo which had chicken pulao, chicken lasuni kebab, chicken tikka masala and chicken reshmi masala.

Both of the dishes really tasted good......and was also  pocket friendly..

The quantity of the Biryani has been raised.....but the quantity of the pulao should be improved..... otherwise it's good.........

Pretty renowned place with very pocket friendly offers! 
Biryani, and kebabs all for 120Rs. And I'm not kidding!
I had a chicken steak, which they serve with bread/rice, of which i opted for the rice. Taste wasn't splendid but the amount was pretty satisfactory! 
The biryani was tasty but was a tad too oily, a backdrop there. 
But they serve NO DESSERT! Being a sweets fan, this was really disappointing for me. 

Nevertheless, if you have a good apetite and are looking for a place with good food at low cost, this is your go to place.

This outlet located just behind Lake Mall is more spacious than the one in Golpark. The restaurant lives up to it‚Äôs reputation of serving pocket friendly good food. The thalis and the combos are a steal at the prices that they are in. The service can be elevated and the chelo kebab can taste better in the platter. Overall good for dining and great for treats in large groups. Enjoy !

Had Biriyani combo of this place . Though the price was very cheap but the  taste was not at all good . The combo comes with biryani,egg,  two kabab and one chicken chaap . Anyway since all these comes within a very less price so one can try once .

The most disastarous experience that I have made till date...On getting recommendation from my friend I visited today.Ordered mutton biriyani combo which have mutton biriyani,salads, chicken tikia and chicken kebab.. Their quality is below everything..The mutton pieces are not well cooked.The biriyani is nothing more than grass and the chicken chap is just not up to the mark... Thanks

Yesterday went there during lunchtime.It was crowded enough at that time.A two storey building decorated with mirrors,posters and old looking lightings.So we ordered for chicken biryani combo and badshahi pulao combo. Chicken biryani comes along with generous amount of rice, a piece a meat,egg and potato. And as side dish they offer chicken chap and chicken tikka kebab. Biryani was quite dry. But the side dishes were mouth watering. Then badshahi pulao combo comes with chicken pulao,chicken lahsuni kebab, chicken tikka masala and chicken reshmi masala. The pulao was loaded with small meat chunks. It tasted quite good. But the kebab here was dry and bland. The two side dishes were both delicious. Staffs were not that much well behaved. But over all experience was nice here.

i had really high hopes . But was disheartened. 
When i had gone to tandoor house i took the the biriyani combo. Because people talk about the biriyani combo a lot! so i had to try that! But i was really dissapointed the biriyani tasted still okay but the chaap which was included in the biriyani combo tasted really bad. 
Other than that tandoor house is a pocket friendly place. 
The service is good.

This outlet is situated behind the lake mall. Ambience is better than the previous outlet but it still doesn't have enough room for people. People have to wait outside for their number. Price of the foods are cheap. Combo offers are pretty good. Biryani is okay-ish. Don't even try steak or sizzler here.

I had never been served such wrost quality of food ever in any restaurant in Kolkata....
Me and my husband has oftenly visted in the different restaurants in kolkata to take lunch and dinners mostly in the weekends but today's experience is horrible, I had attached my bill for the ready reference. I request to everybody don't go in this restaurant to waste of time and money.
I had wasted my money on this restaurant....

It is located behined Lake Mall, approximately it takes 10 minutes by walk from the metro station.A good locatable place.

One of my friends gave her birthday treat here so I got a chance to visit this place . Since then I have been visiting here on a random basis.

As I have picture of only the food of my very first visit , so I'm sharing my experience of that day .
We ordered Reshmi IraniButter Masala ,Mixed Friedrice, Veg Chowmien. The quantity and quality is outstanding and at a very reasonable price . They provided us with chilled and purified water. The atmosphere is very calm , quite and cozy.

One thing dissapointed us is that we had to wait outside to get table for a long time. But after a certain period of time we were comfortably accomadated on one of the tables of second floor .

Overall , it's a highly recommended place to visit :)

Biryani was okayish but chaap was ridiculous , best are tandoors. I tried 3-4 types of tandoor . All were awesome. Cheap price get balanced by the quality and quantity of the food . Earlier the biryani combo was praiseworthy but during these few months the biryani and chaap have degraded severely. Ambience is fine.

It was a satrday afternoon when I had decided to visit tandoor house for lunch.I had heard a lot about this place during my college days.The place is just 5-10min walk from the metro station.I have no complaints.The food was yummy but the seating arrangement is very crowded.Now coming to the cons,the entire menu was not really available, only few items were available to be ordered from.Moreover the we had to wait for almost 45mins which is a really disappointing thing.
However if u are looking for a pocket friendly option near Lake mall, this must be your first choice.

The quantity of Biriyani was not adequate. The reshmi kebabs wer awesome. But the chicken chanp was whaaaaaaaak , someone had boiled spices in water........
Overall experience was goood.....
My opinion is only opt for mughlai don't turn the menu.......avoid i chiken chanp.......Water serving should be done better.

"Tandoor House" with wide variety of items on their menu and their unbelievably low prices did attract me and it had been on my wishlist since a long time.I was lucky enough that I didn't have to wait outside for a table.We were seated on the first floor..The ambience was good and the staff were also polite.
Now when it came to food, there was a small menu so my friend and I referred to zomato for menu.
We ordered Chicken Tandoori Wings, Coke, Biryani combo and Chicken Pulao combo.

The Tandoori Wings at just 70 was so tender and cooked to perfection and I loved it.I even packed a plate of tandoori chicken wings home and added a lil but of my flavor which turned out to be really good.üòõ

The Biryani was served with two kababs and Chicken chap.Biryani with an egg, a potato was good but I didn't like chicken chap.

Chicken pulao combo with 2 kababs and 2 side dishes were tasty especially the pulao and Chicken reshmi masala.

Overall it was a good food day at a very pocket friendly price.
Loved it, total value for money.
Would definitely visit again to try other dishes in their menu.üòä

*Tried their chicken hot and sour soup in this rainy winter day and it was too good..

It is situated just behind the Lake Mall. We were a group of nine and it didn't take long for us to get seats. We had 5 chicken steaks with rice, chicken maharaja with butter naan, paneer butter masala with naan and chicken tikka kabab. The steaks were well cooked, the meat was tender and juicy, and it was a whole meal for one person. The naans were warm  and soft. The chicken maharaja side dish and paneer butter masala was at par and great. The kababs however were dry n not served with chatni which was a disappointment. Overall it was a value for money place. The dishes didn't took long to prepare.

Sitting is very close to each other table...
About the service they don't respond early..
About food it's okk...quantity of biriyani is less kebabs are tasty but taste of chicken chap is not at all good . All can go here if u are feeling bhukkar type and want to slow down ur hungriness in cheap rate. It's very pocket friendly place.

In need to have something really Indian, we landed up here without any second thoughts.
We were the only customers there, and hence could choose a place we wished to sit at. The decor was okay, Interiors are modest, which can be expected for the price. However, the service was quick. .
I would just request the restaurant to maintain the quality of their food because we really cherish the food on their menu. All items are reasonably priced but I personally didn't like the taste of the items which I ordered but it's worth a try. Thanks!

When your pocket is hurting and still you crave for good food in a good restraunt... You have to visit Tandoor House. Its true that they dont serve great tasting food like other big restraunts but the price at which they serve their food and the combos they have and serve , their is no other restraunt in town which serve that good food at that cheap rate..  i mean can you believe having chicken biriyani, chicken chap, and chicken kababs at just Rs.130/- ? They serve many other combos like that which all are just too good .. and their behaviour is also good... And its the best place to give treats to your friends and to spend some good time with your love... For me its my favourite restraunt with minimum pocket pinch

Anyway, coming to the food now..the food was good as we were waiting for such a long time outside I failed to enjoy the food properly because I've lost my interest .. I ordered the mutton biryani combo and my friend ordered the special pulau combo..the kebabs were good but the mutton in the biryani failed to do the justice.. overall the ratings I am going to make are

Located beside the lane of Lake mall. This place is small and sitting arrangements are not so comfortable. It's good for one n only reason is you get the cheapest price. The biryani combo was nice.  pulao combo isn't available most of the time. Ambience is average. You can't take food relaxed manner. They tried their level best to decorate the interior. Though it could be better. Staffs are polite though their movements are slow. Anyway it's a good experience.

The last thing why I would go here again is the ice cream they serve with chocolate sauce

Visited this place a couple of weeks back with my friends by getting attracted to the eye grabbing combos and that too in very cheap prices! We were a group of four people and ordered 2 Biriyani combos and 2 Chinese meals. Being a Chinese food lover I wanted to try their Chinese thali. But alas!..the food left no stone unturned to disappointment me completely! The fried rice was so bad and not even fresh! Even the local food corners maintain a better quality than Tandoor House! The combo also had two tiny pieces of chilli chicken and two little pieces of manchurian chicken! It just ruined my taste buds! So whoever are planning to have a chinese combo from this place... A BIG NO for them.. Now the biriyani combo.. As I haven't tried that I'm really not the right person to review that but according to my friends it was a kind of "okay"! I just want to request the management please do care about the food quality and taste! We can spend a little more but quality should not be compromised for anything. I'm still giving a rating of 2.5 because of the decor and location. Thank you!

This place is located in the lane beside lake mall. It has decent seating area which is better than the one near golpark. Now coming to the food!
This place is pocket friendly but I didn't like the food.
My friends tried the biriyani combo and I tried butter naan with chicken reshmi butter masala.
The chicken reshmi butter masala was bland.
They really don't make proper butter naans. It was so disappointing!
The biriyani combo had inconsistency.
Two of my friends got a plate which which had tasteless chicken also the salt amount was high!
They've even reduced the quantity served in pulao combo.

Pocket friendly; the quantity of the food was really good but the taste was not up to the mark in any of the dishes especially the kebabs.

Ambience was good; well decorated; quite a big space for accommodation.

Our pandal hopping during puja left us completely famished. So, we came here for a quick lunch. We ordered a javab whose name i don't remember, chickenn dish and Biriyani. The taste was good as usual. The quantity was a bit less. The inside was nicely decorated. Too much queue in front of it. Still worth coming here once in a while just because if their cheap prices.

Brilliant ambience and food! We had Biriyani combo which had a chicken leg piece, a boiled egg, chicken chap and two pieces chicken tikka kabab! Just for 120 bucks! We also had Chellow kebab platter which had butter rice, mutton seekh kebab 2 pc. and 4 pc. chicken kebab with salads and an egg poach! It was for 150 bucks! The surroundings was great too! But the service was too poor. They don't even come to attend and each time you have to call them, even after meal we had to call him and ask for the bill! They weren't talking loudly, we couldn't hear what they said! Lol. Anyway, it was a nice experience!

Tandoor house is no doubt one of the most populated restaurant in Lake Market Area. 

" Yahan Itni Bhid Kyu Hoti Hai!"  was the first reason why I thought of exploring this place. 
Finally today I got that opportunity and discovered that the place offers good food in low price. 
The food is good and will help you with your hunger. 
You can try Chelo Kebab platter at Rs150, Dum Biriyani Special (Mutton) at Rs 200 and Butter Naan, Chicken Reshmi kabab Masala at an average of 250 for 2.

Food:
The price are way lower than others... In 140 rupees you will get Mutton biriyani with one egg and potato (the amount of rice is half of others), 2 pc chicken tikka kebab and 1 pc of chicken chap.  And that's enough for 1 person. But the Mutton pieces were not good... So I'll suggest to go for the chicken combo. 
Ambience :
Decoration is nice... But a little crowded 
Service :
Good 
Overall if you're low on budget... This is the perfect place for a complete meal.

So it was Durga Puja, Saptami, and lunch time. So after standing outside for around 35mins, our luck finally fortuned us and we went in. The interiors are very well decorated. The ambience was mesmerising with very well mannered staff. We were immediately served by water bottles and glasses. We ordered two chicken dum Biriyani, chicken butter masala, and one chicken roast (full). Biriyani was average, it lacked flavours compared to other well known places but the butter masala was really good. It had the buttery flavours intact with the right amount of spice to make it good. The chicken roast was the same, almost same as of the other Tandoor House branch. Nothing fancy, sweet and sour taste with the buttered rice which was overall good. The chicken tenders were a bit harder, burned at some spots but that'd be just nitpicking. We wanted to order the chicken Biriyani combo but they didn't have that during the Pujas. Overall a pleasant experience with good food and not giving a huge stress to your wallet.

Look and Feel - The interiors are quiet impressive...With brickwork, quirky paintings and aristocratic light...

Now coming to the food-

                        The combo packs are good...we took mutton and chicken biriyani combo and chicken pulao combo...

The Biryani was served with two kababs and Chicken chap.Biryani with an egg, a potato was good but I didn't like chicken chap...The chickens are not soft enough...

Chicken pulao combo with 2 kebabs and 2 side dishes were tasty especially the pulao and Chicken reshmi masala...

Overall it was a good food day at a very pocket friendly budget.

Just been here once this october. Located just beside the lake mall, this place offers a good quality of food. We hung out with a group of 8 friends. Ordered the biriyani combo. Honestly speaking the biriyani combo is unbelievably cheap. It provides the basic biryani ( with aloo and egg and mutton or chicken, as ordered) along with 3-4 pieces of chicken kabab and chicken tikka masala or chicken butter masala. The biriyani was just too good. The kabab pieces were soft and perfect. I loved the biriyani aloo. But the chicken side dish was not so up to the level. Didn't like the gravy and the chicken pieces were not so good. And also, the surrounding was also not too good. I felt it a bit too clumsy. Amidst all these, the food was good for a hungry stomach.

Located in the bylanes of Lake market mall. This place is always crowded . famous for their combos. Tried chicken biriyani combo and badshahi pulao combo.
Chicken biriyani combo - there served biriyani with chicken chaap and two pieces of chicken kebab . chicken pieces were chewy and utterly disgusting. Only the rice was good. The chaap was pathetic.
Badshahi pulao- this dish comprises pulao along with lahsooni kebab and chicken reshmi butter masala. Both side dish was okiesh . apart from that everything was too much salty.
Quality of food is worst that can be understandable by their price. Only visit this place if you are short on pocket.Worst experience ever

I visited this place three times till now and tasted their Dum Biriyani Special, Biriyani Combo, Chello Kebab Platter and Chicken Sizzler so far. All the dishes are very good in taste.
Also, the prices are very reasonable. This place is my personal favourite. I would love going back again and again. I would highly recommend it.

Tandoor House is located just behind lake mall and its closest metro station is kalighat.
From the first experience the place is always full and they dont allow you to sit until all of your members have arrived. 
Its serves both mughlai and chinese dishes.
We tried mughlai food there and ordered chicken biryani, Mutton Biryani, Chicken tikka kabab and chicken wings kabab.
The food was good and the chicken was tender but i found the biryani to be average. 
Overall it is a small space and serves food with prices which are not hard on your wallet. 
P.S- Great place to give birthday treats. üòõ

Earlier we had been visiting their branch on Southern Avenue but it has shifted from there to an old refurbished building behind the Lake Mall. 
The arrow signs starting from the Southern Avenue location took us on an adventure and guided us through the lanes of Lake Market to their new location.
Tandoor House has been known for their economical combos,especially the Biriyani Combos.

But last time we tried out their Continental menu,having ordered the Chicken Roast for takeaway.
Again we were left surprised by the quantity of Chicken that was served. One is left wondering how they are able to provide such quantity and quality at the given rates.The Chicken was accompanied with boiled vegetables and toast.
Service was smooth as usual.

I was surprised to heard about their prices. Biriyani combo is just 120 Rs. OMG! First time I tried this and got one piece chicken chap, potato, two piece chicken tikka. So think about that. Taste was not so high bt as per rate, it is delicious. Second time I went there for lunch with my mom, I tried chinese combo,raita and before that, we ordered chicken wings kebab( just 70 rs.). Taste was good. Quantity was also fine for both of that occassion. Staffs are good and ambience is plus point of this restro. Must try.

The biriyani portion is not enough for one person tho. Taste is ok and it's a bit oily . Service is good but a bit slow. Overall a pocket friendly restaurant to try . But if someone is too concious of food quality then please avoid the combo foods.

Went there with a few of my friends during the Durga puja. We had heard it's a really good place for biriyani. Surprisingly enough, it was a really bad experience. The tandoori roti we ordered were like rocks. It was burnt and hard with no taste. The biriyani was a disaster as well. So, pray you don't have to go here because it will ruin your day.

Went there with a few of my friends during the Durga puja. We had heard it's a really good place for biriyani. Surprisingly enough, it was a really bad experience. The tandoori roti we ordered were like rocks. It was burnt and hard with no taste. The biriyani was a disaster as well. So, pray you don't have to go here because it will ruin your day.

A pocket friendly joint. Their biriyani and Chinese combos are the main attractions. I ordered chelo kebab but it wasn't satisfying at all. May be okay for one visit or two. I didn't find the ambience good enough.

Nowadays tandoor house food quality becomes low quality. I bought Chicken Biriyani combo on 04/10/2017, Biriyani is low quality, taste is disgusting. Chicken's smell is rotten tasten and the curry also. Tandori Chicken balls also taste plain with no masala inside. And in salad, onion is mixed with vinegar and smell rotten, may be two days old onions salad. Food is totally worst.. Sorry tandoor house, one time you are top. But looks like as you had open your chains in two places, you have forgotten your recipes. And same will lost your all customers, who loves tandoor house will hates tandoor house. I have started. I loose faith on you @tandoor house.

We ordered chicken lasuni kabab, tandoori ruti and chicken resmi butter masala.

This is one of the famous foodstops i guess. I have been here many times & because of the popularity I had to wait in the queue everytime. The location has shifted just beside lake mall. Now coming to the food. I have had both the chinese and biriyani combos. Both are good, decent quantity, u can't complain. Tandoori chicken was also great. One of the must visit places if you are a foodie. Ambience was good too.

We ordered takeaway from this place. Service was prompt.

We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab, and Mutton Biriyani. The Biriyani portion is not enough for one person. They give you a big chunk of potato, an egg, and a piece of chicken/mutton. The problem with putting all of this in is that it ends up reducing the amount of rice you get. The kebabs tasted good but the pieces were highly uneven. Some pieces were big while some were extremely small.

Value for money. Will be back to eat at this restaurant again.

This outlet is located very near to Lake Mall and quite familiar to everyone, so this has got a convinient location. 

Ambience - This was my Second Visit to this place. On my first visit, I was so impressed about their food & service, so i had paid my Second visit there. But TRUST ME, they left no stone unturned to disappoint me. ‚ùé‚ùé 

Food - Ordered Chicken Biriyani, Naan, Chicken Bharta and Fried Rice.

üí†Chicken Biriyani was as pathetic as it could be. The chicken leg piece was so hard and it was so cold. The Biriyani rice was also cold. 
üí†Butter Naan - was crispy üòÇüòÇ Nothing more or less !
üí†Chicken Bharta was also cold.
üí†Chicken Fried Rice was somewhat okay !

So overall, it has a great DEGRADATION !! üåπ

Service - The staffs were completely reluctant, be it on taking orders or something. They served us real bad. And when we told the man sitting on the reception desk about our grievances, he was even more ignorant ! üòàüòà

So this is outlet is a Big NO for me !! ‚ùé‚ùé‚ùé‚ùé You have much better & cheaper places to go for.

P.S. - They have started charging taxes. So no more USPs. üí•

Learnt about the place from Facebook and was instantly impressed by the super cheap and attractive combos while browsing the menu on zomato. Visited the place in the afternoon on 16th September to have lunch with a friend. The place is easy to locate. It is situated on the 1st floor.
AMBIENCE- 3.5/5. Nice big place but it was almost full so was a bit crowded. Nice ambience, well decorated. Though the seats have little leg space and to me were uncomfortable.
STAFF- 2.5/5. The staff are incompetent and not well mannered. We asked for a table for two and were shown up by a well behaved man when we arrived but as we reached the 1st floor and went inside, a man told us that seats for 2 were not empty (though 2-3 tables were still vacant) and asked us to go & wait downstairs, like what! Then we said we were sent up saying table was empty so the man had no choice but to give us a table but he looked annoyed. We were given a table which was recently vacated and was not even cleared so it was full of dirty plates glasses and food. A waiter came to clear the mess only after 5 minutes. Apart from that service was prompt. Order was taken and food was served within 10 minutes.
FOOD- 2.5/5 We ordered two chicken biriyani combos which contained biriyani with a piece of potato, chicken, egg, two pieces of tikka kebab and a chicken chaap. Obviously the portions were small but the food was super average. The biriyani was not upto the mark. The chicken was chewy and hard. The kebabs were cold and hard. The chaap too was totally ordinary. Plus the onions in the salad provided had gone sour and were obviously not fresh and that was YucKk plus the cucumber was bitter!! I have no complaints with the quantity, as the combos were awesome and totally enough for one person but seriously if they are unable to provide quality food, they should either increase the prices or decrease the items offered in the combo and enhance the quality. (Plus, the water they served though faint had a certain taste which I did not like. Others might not get it like my friend didn't but I am a little sensitive to these things).
Quality- 1.5/5
Quantity- 3/5
PRICES- 4/5. Totally affordable. Superb combos. But I am so disappointed with the quality. I really liked the place inspite of all the negatives that I found. Wish they improve on their food quality. The place does have 18% GST but that is not gonna bother anyone given the super affordable prices.
Overall, I have mixed feelings about the place. Might visit again but that will not be anytime soon.
P.S.- I gave 0.5 extra just because I liked that they gave hand washing bowls at the end.

Had been a regular to the erstwhile Southern Avenue outlet, but have grown certain reservations against the Parasar Road Branch.
Dropped in a week ago to order Special Dum Biriyani but disappointedly received not-so-hot bowl of rice and chicken with shriveled and overcooked leg-pieces. Though the most conveniently priced Biriyani combo was a thing to look up to, I am now sceptic to order a plate.
Have a complaint or two on account of the Chicken Roast too. Though the meat is always rendered tender and full of the juices, it is recently been covered up with an excess of tomato-based sauce, mostly sweet to taste, which steals away the surprise. Indianisation of the Continental may be a dangerous proposition.
Chicken Kashmiri Boti Masala was a saving grace for us. That extra dash of pepper instead of Lal Mirch was innovative and worked out itself well.
The interiors deserve a mention for sure. Decked up with collector's item and similar memorabilia, it is reminiscent of the legacy of royal Awadhi cuisine in our own hometown. Only the food needs to match up with the decor.

We had to wait around 20-25 mins as it was pretty crowded even at around 4:30-5 pm. No problem with waiting. Being an eggitarian I ordered paneer butter masala and naan. The paneer butter masala was the worst I have ever had in my life. The naan was not naan but it was a quite thick wheat chapati,the butter naan my friends ordered was also the same with some butter on it.

Tandoor House is the best food space for every student any day. Being a pocket-friendly restro, the one thing that all of us look out for is the Chicken/Mutton Biriyani combo üòÑ‚ù§
Served with a good quantity, the kebabs, rice, chicken Chaap are enough to get your tummy a good meal. 
The ambience is pretty homely, which is very good. :)

The one thing that I feel is Tandoor House should open up a few more outlets. Sometimes, it takes way too time to get a table booked. :(

So let's have an honest review about this place which is supposed to be famous for it's food. No doubt it's a pocket friendly place but then you need to have the required flavour in the food to actually eat it. We were four of us who had gone for lunch at about 3pm, it was supposedly on waiting list we got token no. 19 but we got the table almost immediately after getting the token. When we headed to the dining area on the 2nd floor, more than half the seating section was empty with more that 20 people lurking down stairs waiting for their table. 
The menu was quite pocket friendly with attractive combo offers, we ordered 2 chelo kebabs, a plate of chicken tikka masala, keema matar with 5 tandoori roti. 
Chelo kebab was fine. Edible to say the least. The rice which should be warm and buttery was cold and choky since the chef chose to serve cold rice with a small scoop not even half an inch in length of butter on the side. The chicken kebab was good but the mutton kebab was hard to chew with a pathetic stink that was hard to dismiss. 
The tandoori roti was extremely thick it was As If we were chewing raw dough. 
Chicken tikka masala was ok. The chicken pieces wasn't tender, the gravy which is otherwise rich was thin and watery with pieces of chopped green chillies.
Keeping the worst for the last the Keema matar, when we hear keema we think of finely minced meat. I don't think the chef understood the meaning of keema. We were served pieces of meat instead of keema. The meat was more of thick fat than meat itself. And this too had the same peculiar stink of mutton. It wasn't even well cooked. 
The ambience and interiors is good but you need to keep the room fresh. It had a peculiar stale smell. The dining area wasn't airy. The a.c. wasn't cooling the entire place. The washroom smelled strongly with the garbage that was thrown close to it. 

I would strongly advise people not to visit this place, there are alot more places you could go to for lunch at a budget than this place. Never going back again.

Hearing a lost about this place from my friends we went in this place for trying the biriyani combo served here.The biriyani doesn't taste like a good biriyani at all though it tastes good,a lot of chicken items are served with the chicken biriyani combo which is quite unbelievable in that small amount of price.The ambience of this place is good enough.
For the ambience of this place I will give this place 4 out of 5, for the food I will give this place 3.5 out of 5 and for service I will give this place 3.5 out of 5.

Tandoor House, located near the Lake Mall, is one of those places which serves generous portions‚Äã of food at really reasonable rates. Although the place remains crowded on most days, particularly with a younger crowd, the food and the ambience is worth queueing for. We had ordered the Tandoor chicken and the Badshashi Polao combo, both of which were delicious. The kebabs in the Badshashi Polao combo were juicy and the rice was flavoursome. However, the Royal de combo wasn't up to the mark as the roast chicken tasted very sweet and was difficult to eat. We're looking forward to visiting again and trying the Chelo kebab which appears to be a popular ‚Äãchoice.

Last Sunday Evening visited this place along with 15 others to satiate our hungry souls. They were efficient enough to provide us the table in no time and we placed our order in no time as well. Our order consisted of 13 Chicken Biryani Combos , a Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and a Chelo Kebab ( ome of us chose to remain hungry! His bad )
I had the Chicken Biryani Combo and trust me one couldn't ask for more at this price. There were 2 pieces of kebabs which were succulent and flavoursome, Biryani along with potato,egg and chicken leg piece and a piece of Chicken Chaap which wasn't great but wasn't bad at all.
My friend who ordered the soup said it was very tasty and that she loved it. Same goes with the chelo kebab.
This is a gem of a place and I am going to visit again to try out other combos. Happy Fooding ‚ù§

This was much of a sudden plan..After shopping at Lake mall decided to have our dinner nearby.. so saw this place was the nearest.. its very close to lake mall.. just take the lane beside lake mall on the left side.. just walk few steps and this place is on your right side..

As it was busy sunday evening and we reached around 8 pm.. so was a packed house but to our utter surprise found a table for 7 people... 

Ambience :- I must say this place is really well decorated... quite a big space to accommodate people.. The ac was chilled..the wall paintings were also good..

Food :- first of all came the starter 

1) Chicken wings kebab :- (2.5/5) it was really a waste.. It was cold.. The chicken was hard.. and the taste was really bad..

2) Chicken biriyani combo :- (3/5) the quantity was huge.. With chicken biriyani.. one piece aloo..One piece chicken.. One egg.. accompanied by salad.. Two chicken kebabs.. and chicken chap.. The biryani was light.. but the kebabs were so bad literally I could not finish it.. The chicken  chap was more like chicken rezala with no spice.. really bad.. and it was cold too... not satisfied.. 120 rs only...

3) Mutton biriyani combo :- same as above.. nothing special.. 3 points just for the biriyani and the quantity of food at that price.. just 140rs.. that's really cheap....

4) Chicken tikka masala.. :- This dish was really well prepared.. 8 pieces of soft juicy chicken floating in a spice gravy.. really goes well with plain naan..

5) plain naan:- soft.. fluffy.. best dish of the evening... 

P:S :-Avoid those kebabs.. its really bad.. may be the combos were not upto the mark due to the excessive crowd.. wud definitely try some other day

Nice Ambience.
Food Quality is pretty worthwhile since it's easy on the pocket, but could do better. Visited today with my folks, among the items ordered, first helpings of Butter Naan wasn't buttery at all, and Chicken Chaap wasn't gravy - like; more like watery.
Overall it's nice.

I have been to this place 3 times,its just behind Lake mall,so it's a good option to visit after a shopping or a movie there..the place is almost always crowded, nice decors,the service is quite fast,the quantity and quality of the foods are really good,but the best thing is the pricing is very pocket friendly..a great option for students and all.
Now coming to the main thing,the food is the heart of any Restro..they have great combos,i tried the Chinese combo-honestly I have better Chinese in the small roadside food joints,its not good at all.but the Biriyani and polao combos are better than this,its not too good but quite good.we also tried the chicken Maharaj combo,its a whole chicken,huge quantity...taste nice.
My only request to the management is u got a huge,pocket-friendly,beautiful place.the quality and quantity is really good,but u really should improve ur food tastes.

Although the ambience of the place was very good the food didn't meet our expectations. The chicken reshmi Kabab was not as soft as expected. The chicken served with the rice pulao was stale and the rice was not served hot. The only thing that tasted a little better was the chicken biryani, though the chicken was neither washed nor cooked properly. The place is cheap as compared to other places though quality comes first in our platter.
Service is quite good although they didn't give a review book when we wanted one.
Not happy with the overall experience.

I am a huge fan of this place to be honest. It's easy to locate beside lake mall road. This is a perfect place for hangout who had a limited pocket money. 120/- bucks for Chicken Biriyani combo is not at all costly, when you're getting 2 kebabs, one egg, potato, good chicken piece in Biriyani and chicken chap. Rather than that chicken sizzler with butter rice/bread. The Biriyani is good, light. The kebabs are to die for & chap taste good as well. A must try for everyone. I love their decor as well, specially the books they had. These place remains almost full, so maybe you have to wait few mins for a table, or you can book in advance.

I have been there many times. Lost counting now üòâ. This place is so good. They provide great food in less money. My favorite one is the mutton biryani combo. I just love it. In the combo there are mutton biryani which comes with an egg, chicken kebab, salad and a chicken gravy. It's a well combined food. Other mutton and chicken dishes are awesome also. Another dish is whole roasted chicken which I loved a lot.
The place is also a pretty decent one. Nice ambience.  This place is just behind the Lake Mall. So you can chill a bit there after a meal in tandoor house. It's great.

Decent food at convenient location! Nothing exception but gets the job done. Their combos are low priced but tasty.. the chicken sizzler is my personal favourite.. The biriyani combo is nice too.. I visited this place twice or thrice.. Their chelo kebab platter is okayish. Their Chinese dishes aren't up to the mark.  
The plus point of this restaurant is sufficient quantity of food at pocket friendly price.

This cozy joint which has long been in my radar is very conveniently located behind the Lake Mall. Any guest will pleasantly stumble upon it's unique way of decorating the place which is bound to give an old school charm. The art work adorning the walls, the antique piece of radio set and other ancillary stuffs give a nostalgic charm.
Coming to food, it's just average. The menu shows quiet a variety of food is available at their disposal with a candy price but overall food quality fails to tickle the taste bud with a gourmand flavor. The lasauni kabab is tasty. The Chelo kabab platter though nice but comes to cropper to give an oomph factor! as the shami kebab is devoid of enough meat and been stuffed with plethora of lenticel fillers. The Mutton Biriyani is tad oily and the mutton pieces though nicely cooked but not succulent. Service is prompt and swift.
Nevertheless to mention that keeping in mind the price tag they offer, some of the loopholes may be shrugged off but the patrons should ensure a better food quality every time so as Tandoor House may keep up to it's reputation among the foodie fraternity for the time to come.........

The lane beside lake Mall is where you will find restraunt.With enough space, and taking a lot of time to serve food,this place does quiet well and the food is also not costly.They should improve way they cook chicken you will find the same texture of chicken in all the recipes ie,the chicken tastes the same in biriyani as well as in the side dish! They basically cook it differently and mix it everywhere that pulls down the impression completely.
The good things are,you get average food in a good quantity at a very cheap price.
Their Tandoor ie,80rs per plate and Mutton Special Biriyani is a must try!
Improvement should be done on service and cooking

The Southern Avenue outlet has now relocated to the lake market area,just behind lake market. This was my first visit after they relocated to this area and as the tradition of Tandoor House goes,one has to always wait before getting a seat. It was the same scenario this time around.

After a wait for about 10mins we finally got a place to sit. Now first impression about the new decor wasn't quite impressive because I found it really clumsy,all the tables had been put in the same room and there wasn't any scope of some privacy. It was a open area and this really made me miss their seating arrangement of the former outlet.

The food that was ordered was the biryani combo and a kabab platter.
The biryani combo comes with biryani,chicken chaap and 2 kababs.
The kabab platter had 10pieces of them.
I personally felt that the quality of the biryani could be improved also the chicken chaap was bland. 
But really satisfied with the kabab platter.

Would rate service 5/10. They have to improve on this part as the waiters aren't adequate.

Eventually a waiter arrived and very rudely asked us to shift to other table. When I protested eventually  we bad to leave the place. In hospitality industry this is something which should never happen. I was a regular when they were in southern avenue. They just lost a customer!

Location is good, just beside the lake mall. Price is on the lower side, a bit crowded place. Chicken chap was good with a spicy gravy. Dissappointed with the reshmi kabab, fat skin sticked to the chicken, not completely eatable. And the biriyani nothing better than from street vendor,only difference is that we have a decent place to sit on.

It's ok but not so good in that way... Kabab is not up to mark... Just like a normal taste not so good about it.have some main course in there for dinner or lunch.I think they will have to work in their foods quality. if a customer want to take any combo meal so they have to take the downstairs for order & also make the payment in there. This is not done guys. You should take care about the customer...

End of the month when you are running out of money if you want to give yourself a feast this place is a must visit palce.. This place is not tough to locate this is near to the kalighat metro station right beside the lane of lake mall..
Coming to the ambience decor the place is small and for it's awsome combo prices the place is little noisey. I heard that the place is so crowdy that people have to wait in que. But luckily we didn't have to wait. The paintings, lights, the old recorder, metal switch were giving the place quiet old classic vintage look.. The stuff are good enough..
We odered 2 mutton special biriyani and 1 special chicken biriyani and their special wings kebab.
The mutton biriyani contains two pieces of mutton one egg and one aloo. So as the chicken biriyani. The amount of rice is little lesser than other places. The biriyani is less oily which I like the aloo wasn't properly cooked. But the mutton and chicken were nicely cooked. The wings kebab was good. But some of them were burnt..
But all over the experince is good..
And all these food came in just Rs. 661/-
So if you are searching for a pocket friendly place go grab a bite there.

Location : this place is just 5 minutes walk from lake mall...one can easily locate it from the main road.
Ambience: it was nice...small place but well maintained... Decor was very nice the place is packed with so many pictures r quotes everywhere and the hanging lights gave it a cosy touch
Food : we ordered 2 chicken biriyani combo 1st...which contains one chicken biriyani with egg and potato,2pcs of chicken tikka and chicken chap...no complain with thd taste of biriyani, it was nicely cooked but the quantity was very little it was not sufficient for one person even....so we had to order one extra plate of pulao...which was sufficient in quantity and also tastes good...come to chicken chap...my plate consisted a well cooked tasty chap...but my friend said his one was not good and it was a little smelly too and we also took 2 glasses of cold drinks...so not at all a very good experience... Although the pocket pinch is extremely low they could have served better quality... It's extremely pocket friendly...all this cost below 500.
Experience: behavior of the staffs were okay... Sometimes we had to call them 3/4 times for anything...we had to wait for 5 minutes... This place is really busy and crowded one
Overall a so so experience so I'll go with 3 stars.

This place is always buzzing with people . During peak hours you will have to wait for some time before you are allotted a table . School and college gangs keep coming regularly .
This place is too small but the way they have designed the place is beautiful . A congested place has been made into an attractive diner with the interiors .

This place is famous for its different combos which are plenty in number but my pick would be the Mutton Biryani Combo , the Badshahi Pulao Combo , Chicken Sizzler and my favorite Chicken Maharaja . Most of the combos taste very good .

VFM : Very very good . You get a mutton biryani ( 3/4 of a regular plate ) , 2 pieces of kebab and 1 chaap at just 140 bucks . What more can you ask for .

Absolutely recommended :)

This used to be a small restaurant near southern avenue and then suddenly they shifted their restaurant to this place,near lake mall. Everytime we've gone to this place we've found it crowded. No wonder there must be some reason for this huge que, either good food or cheap food.
It has 3 floors and all of them remain crowded. The reason is mainly because of the price they charge for the food, which is quite cheap. The waiters may ask you to share tables or even make 4 or 3 people sit in a place for 2 people.
Now coming to the ambience, it's good if not outstanding.
The main attraction here are the combos which they serve, however, what I have felt is, they've compromised with quality while keeping the prices low. We ordered biriyani combo, and the chicken had a foul smell and was hard. Barbecue chicken, which comes at 4 pieces for 70/- is a must try and the best item probably. Also the shahi pulao combo is good.
The food served is good considering the price and all prices are exclusive of taxes. So if you're having a hole in your pocket but want to gorge onto something good, this is a place where u may go

Probably the worst resturant I have been to in Kolkata. The have some cheap combos all within Rs. 150. We took Biriyani combo for four. It included a plate of Biriyani, one chicken chaap and two chicken kebabs. The biriyani is more like the special mid day meal served once in every six months in government sponsored schools where the cook forgets to add salt and spices. Or more accurately, doesn't have the salt and spices. Quantity differed from one plate to another. The two kebabs were rubbery and looked like burnt latex. Only edible thing was the chaap where the chicken swimmed in ten days old (mostly) oil. The decor is pathetic. Seemed like those motels with thousands of hungry tribesmen gorging on cheap meals. The staffs are also not friendly. The water system in the resturant is pathetic. The whole comod was soiled. They should make the theme of the resturant as medivial age, with dirt and diseases everywhere. I'll never visit again. And will tell my friends and family not to.

The new Place for this Outlet of Tandoor House which was previously in the Southern Avenue is very spacious than the previous place. The restuarant is mostly famous for its combo offers of Chicken and Mutton Biryani, Pulao Combo, Chinese Combo, Indian thali. The combo offers come with side dishes and kebabs and the entire dish is perfect for a single adult. A perfect go to  place for college goers to grab a meal after college with friends and family at an affordable price. The ambience is quiet and sober with books and a light music. I would definately recommend this place to everyone and everyone should definately try out the chinese dishes and tge kebab platter.

Decent price , decent food. Tandoor House has definitely set a bench mark in providing cheap affordable tasty food. 
Biriyani combo is fabulous. This time for a office party we ordered their chinese combo. Fried rice or chowmine quality was very good, taste wise good too. Accompanied by mixed chinese veg, 2 pieces of chilli chicken , 2 pieces of chicken Manchurian. Chilli chicken was light, tasted good the chicken pieces were moderate in size and boneless. The chicken Manchurian was however white in color and looked like lemon chicken. Good place to have good food.

The first visit was just great!!!! We ordered the biriyani platter and it was quit sufficient to fill the tummy and the pocket punch was very low. Only 110‚Çπ. But i was a bit disappointed in the second visit. We ordered biriyani platters and chicken wings. Chicken wings were lovely but the biriyani was so oily and the quantity was not like the first time. Not a must try but if you are willing to have a plate of biriyani and other side dishes with a low pocket pinch, you can come to this place.

When you have to feed 12 friends on your birthday, satisfy their humongous appetite (including mine) that too with good quality food within a tight budget, this is The Place. The combos especially the biriyani combo is a must try. The whole affair cost me less than 1500 tax included. Not kidding. So if you are a college student near the hazra, bhowanipore area, then is the best place for throwing feasts for random celebration without worrying about budget.

I absolutely love every thing about this place. Their BIRIANI COMBO is the must have.Lisen to me and try PANEER KULCHA AND RESHMI CHICKEN MASALA.its totally yum.
After ordering 4biriani combos and 1kulcha,1reshmi chicken masala,5 soft drinks the bill was something like 750 (aprox) .yes you heard me right.its that pocket friendly.‚ù§
The only thing which was a bit upsetting is that they are sometimes slow at their services but WORTH IT ;)

Cozy and affordable. Perfect for an unplanned hangout or a random craving. The place might feel crammed at times due to lack of any open area . The popularity of this place can be best understood from the queue outside it even at 5pm. The quality of the food are not the best but rather food for its price. They have a number of combo offers that attract a lot of people. 
Tried the biriyani which were finely cooked in layers and the chicken chap faired so so . The irani kebab was also far from perfect due to its mismatch of variety of cheese on the kebab. Like i said good for  random cravings.

Da resturant is popular for its combo meal. Food quality nd quantity is very good n also pocket friendly.. they charge 1plate chicken biriyani with egg chicken chap n 2piece kabab just rs 120.  18%gst applicable bt still food was reasonable.  we ordered chicken biriyani combo n chicken sizzler with bread. Both r tasty.. anybody looking 4 a resturant with good food with less price then this place is ideal. I will visit this place next time 4 sure .

A very good food you can have inside in cheap rate. We have ordered Mutton Biryani, Mutton Biryani Combo, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Biryani Combo, Chinese Thali, Chelo Kabab Platter. A very good food with great taste in cheap. Everyone must try this place.

Ok I really don't know what makes people give this place such high ratings coz food is not at all upto the standards. Yeah its cheap may be that's the reason the quality is poor. We went there in a group of 19 and we weren't allowed to enter until all 19 heads arrived. We mainly ordered these two combos -
1. Badsahi polao combo- polao quantity was less. Kebab was tasty but the gravy of tikka m reshmi masala was bad.
2. Chicken biryani combo- biryani was light but cold which ruined the taste. Kebab again was good but chap was too sweet. 
They took almost 40mins to serve which was again a disappointing added to cold food. The bill was around 2300 plus 400 tax post gst.

I look at 3 things while visiting an eating place:-

1)Food-The food was ok,i had some biriyani combo,my favourite as it is. The food was warm,but the chaap provided had too much water in it!

2)Customer Service-HORRIFIC!I ordered a side dish and i had to call the serving person 3 times(some unknown lady thought i was mesmerized by her beauty and constantly looking at her but i was trying to call the serving person who was just behind me) for a very small side dish to be served(a small plate of raita. After the meal was over, the plates were not taken away immediately! I lost my peace and had to talk rudely because it was my birthday treat and did not want my guests to finish their meal and then eat the raita!!!

3)Ambiance/Environment- Very cramped up,the floor was not clean at all!There was hardly any space so i had to request a lady to get up and allow me to pass.¬†

Be ready to control your anger if you want budget food befitting your wallets/purses. Thank you!

Well if you are having a pinch in your pocket but still wish to fulfill your taste buds then this is the place for you and your family. This place is located behind the Lake Mall and the entrance is just beside the parking entrance of the mall. Before I had my chance to visit I did hear a lot about this place especially it's combos and in reality, they were pretty much satisfactory keeping in mind what they charge you for it.The ambiance is nothing to mention about and the seating is within very less space. This place remains crowded from afternoon till night and is mainly filled with college students & people visiting the mall and sometimes you may have to wait for around 30 mins to get a table. Finally, after being seated the waiter took our order within 10 mins and we received our food on the table after 20 mins of the order being placed. We ordered the mutton biryani combo, the Chelo kabab platter and chicken tandoori. The tandoori had 4 large pieces with enough salad and was evenly cooked and tasted fine, The mutton biryani combo contained the main biryani with a average sized piece of mutton and an egg and a half cut potato, 2 average pieces of chicken reshmi kabab and a medium piece of chicken chap. The Chelo kabab was below average with improperly boiled rice, and 2 pieces of useless extra spicy sheekh kabab containing very less meat. Chelo Kabab is not recommended. Tandoori and Biryani combo are value for money items only if you can compromise a bit on the quantity but the meat used in both the dishes were tender and fresh with no bad taste and the spice content was also good. Nevertheless, please don't compare this biryani with the one which is double in price than this (from the famous biryani houses). This has its own advantages especially for people who want fewer calories but the dish for dinner and for guys with limited pocket money this is heaven!!

The place is little hard to notice and has a little car parking problem. The ambiance was good and the service too but the place gets crowded after 1 pm. Like really crowded. We ordered a Hot and sour chicken soup and Reshmi Kebab as a starter. The soup was nice and the kebab¬†was lovely too but I feel that the food presentation is not that good, needs a lot of improvement. The plate of kebab has very very very little salad or you can say that it was just onions. The Kebab was a little dry not juicy at all. Then we ordered the Biryani combos. Let me tell you that the biryani has no "smell of biryani" and was very dry. Quality was "maybe" good but the taste surely wasn't. The combo had a plate of chaap too which was the worst tasting chicken chaap¬†I had in my entire life. Too watery and tasteless. The tikka kebab in the combo was also very dry and not at all tasty.Sorry to say but I would not recommend this place to any food lovers who want to have a good time.
Never coming back! (>.<)

But staffs do not interact
Neither they are well trained
They don't know the difference between am and pm as I called up for a booking
But if you wanna go with your friends who all are bhukkars and want cheap but good and quantity food..this is the place
Food quality and quantity should get 5*
But food service needs to get improved alot..would have provided 10 if service was good..and guest interaction was better but when we were jotting down points for writing the review after we have completed our food,they asked us if we can leave?as guest are waiting?common they have a separate floor and I being a regular here I know this but this is utter insult..not comparing with high class restaurants..but this place has the potential to become a good name and a brand through out but service has to be improved..they will get three and half just cz food is good and the taste can compete many star restaurant in the town..but again service is the worst over here

In this price the food that they deliever is quite awe-inspiring and most importantly the quality of the food that they offer is definitely great.

The place is not that big and very crowded at times, as the accommodation is on the lower side you may have to wait for some time to get your table. The decorations inside is very beautiful, posters from old various movies.

Prices are reasonable, if you take the combo then it is on the lower side. The quality of the biriani and chicken chap (that we took) were not good at all. The food was not even hot when it was served. Taste was also not that good.

Visited the place today. When we're reached this place full of crowed . Ordered their famous chicken biryani combo and chicken pahari kabab. They served the briyani was totally cold. Even the kebabs dish are also very cold and dry. Green chatny was totally sweet and taste was really bad. Biryani chicken was separate cooking and just mixed up with the biryani rice. The cheap wasn't taste in good. Very much watery.
Service was slow. The quality of food wasn't good.
But definitely value of money. Good for school and college students.

It is surprisingly cheap. It is so cheap that you question how do they profit. But the quality of food is not very good. I was served cold biriyani with even colder chap that too after waiting 30 minutes. You can vist this place only if you dont have enough money to go anywhere else...

Tandoor house is the most pocket friendly restaurant in Kolkata whereas the quality of food and servicing is awful. Yesterday I along with my 3 friends had visited and ordered 2 chicken biryani combo, butter nan, roti,paneer butter masala and a dish of chicken.The quantity of chicken biryani combo has been decreased, the rotis were uncooked,panner was too moist and to our tough luck we had to wait for at least 1 hour for our food to be served.

The restaurant though is a little underhanded and it was becoming hectic fornjust one staff member to manage so much. Had the sizzler with rice bas and it was yumm. Truthfully didn't expect it to be but nevertheless it was. Visit the place peeps and you won't regret it I swear.

To be honest, I would ask one thing, why do restaurants keep combo platters for its customers??? I guess for both maintaining business standards as well as attracting a trendy crowd for having some good food !!!
Directly I come to my point, ignore this outlet for combo platter,the biriyani combo to be exact; Why do you even serve combo(s) if you cannot maintain the food quality standards. The chicken biriyani combo has a handful of perfectly cooked biriyani (quantity less),the kebabs (better than the other parts of the combo) , the chicken chap(worst , the gravy tasted more tok doi than chap and the undercooked chicken) and the boiled egg !!!
Rating them high enough ,u may question me why??? I will be true to you all; the ambience , the decoration ,the nawabi darbaar entrance look alike along with the low light decor of the main dining , just fabulous, there is not a hint of complain in their service too considering a bit of wait for table booking; staffs were good, the receptionist was friendly and the menu reflected exactly what the HOUSE serves!!!

Anyways, much improvement required on the quality of food served in combo(s) ;PS: The previous outlet was better !!!

Went there today afternoon with my friends. Ordered mutton biryani and chicken biryani combo,chicken steak ,chello kebab,chicken Tikka masala and coldrinks. Now coming to the food yes they are pretty cheap. But thats it. The rice in chello kebab wasnt even warm and on top of that they served the chello kebab with Margarine instead of butter, that totally pissed me off, the mutton kebabs were tiny and tasteless. Coming to biriyani combo the mutton hardly had any flesh the chicken was chewy, the chicken kasa had a small piece of chicken with lil gravy. I dunno why do they provide lemon with biriyani . Coming to the chicken steak and Tikka butter masala, I found them better than the rest.

Tandoor House , An extremely cosy place located just behind Lake Mall offers you a variety of combo meals served between 12 p.m - 4 p.m.

If you ever visit this place go for the Biryani Combos !! Extremely cheap...but the quantity of rice may not satisfy some , yet its the "one stop Adda zone" for the college goers. The interior is well decorated Keeping the theme of Old Calcutta in mind 

You can also go for the dish named 'Chicken Maharaja'. Coming to the food for the Biryani combos you get a plate of biryani with a succulent piece of chicken/mutton,an egg,a potato, two pieces of kebab and a piece of chicken chap (onions and lemon complimentary) only for ‚Çπ120/‚Çπ140 +vat. They also serve polao combos...but then that's not available always. Beside it serves a variety of Indian and Chinese combos as well !! 

So if the shillings are making a noise in your pocket yet you're hungry you can easily drop down and treat yourself out here !!

Situated right behind lake mall. Its pretty crowded at all hours. Especially during lunch hours, one can always expect a queue.
Best known for its biryani combos. Needless to say thats the one i tried. One chicken biryani combo has a full plate of biryani with a chicken leg piece and a boiled egg and two pieces of chicken kebabs alongwith one piece of chiken chaap. Its filling and delicious.

P.s. - During Pujo combos are off menu but glad to say, was not disappointed with the quality or quantity of biryani just because it was pujo and there was a huge demand of biryani. It was delicious as usual

Tandoor House Is a familiar name when you are thinking to have a low budget tummy filled meal. Visited this particular outlet for the very first time yesterday for having lunch. This place can be very easily spotted just behind the Lake mall in Rashbihari avenue. We entered around 2.00 pm there and the entrance was crowded with a long waiting list to grab their table. We were given a token marked number 8 so we had to wait till our number came. After 10 to 15 minutes we finally got our chance but when we entered the dining area, we just remained shocked to see the place was fully empty. So what's the point of making the crowd at the entrance by giving waiting numbers when they had both the floors available? We seriously didn't get their point. A bad management I must say. 
Now coming to the foods we ordered a chicken biriyani combo and a non veg Indian lunch thali. The serving time was more than 20 minutes. The biriyani combo was good with sufficient amount to feed one person. Indian lunch thali was also adequate in quantity. Both the combos tasted good. The dining space was big and nicely decorated. Apart from that waiting experience, our food experience was decent. They must improve their service.

We visited this restaurant with a group of 11 people. Obviously there was some amount of noise. There was a couple of people who repeatedly kept on shouting at us to quieten down and went even to the point of calling us 'barbarians.' Noise to a certain amount is inevitable considering the size of our group. The manager instead of saying anything to them actually tried to police us. This is the first time we faced such behaviour and we're highly dissatisfied.

Absolutely disgusting. I would rate them zero if I could. Extreme negligence from the staff. I got served two pieces of raw chicken wings, when I mentioned it to the waiter, he casually picked it up and replaced it with  burnt wings. There was no remorse, no apology, not a hint of shame from their side. They probably don't know that serving raw chicken is a health hazard or maybe don't care.

Per box contained the choice of  noodles or rice. Two dishes of chicken consits 2 pieces in each dish and one sauce and salad.all these retails for only 110 ruppees. And the food quality was  good.rather great.so this place is good to visit. As for the food quality and pocket friendly nature.

I was a regular customer of their southern avenue branch. Now they have opened 2 more branches. 
This lake market branch is considerably larger than southern avenue branch. There is a take away counter at the ground floor and dine in options are there in 1st floor and 2nd floor. It's crowded with people all the time thus reflecting its popularity. We got a table at 2nd floor. This floor is decorated with different issues of Sondesh magazine with minimalistic decor. Service is prompt. Food quality is as before. You get what you pay for. There are such amazing combos. Indian, Chinese and Biriyani combos, which I think is the key point of this restaurant. Chicken biriyani combo was good but their newly introduced badsahi pulao combo needs improvement.

This place started in a very small restaurant beside Southern Avenue but now have grown big with two centres at Lake market and Golpark. I have had food here for years now and it is really amazing. What's more amazing is the cheap cost here. This is a paisa vasool place. You get amazing combo and special dishes at unimaginable price. Plus it has got a nice ambience in the new places which have added a class to them too. This is your perfect regular date-dinner place. Out to impress someone or want to treat friends and family but want to keep it light on your pocket, this is the place for you.
Must try: The brilliant biriyani combo which is as cheap as 110 bucks for a plate of biriyani with kebabs and chicken chap served with it.
The chelo kebab. Although it's no peter cat but considering the price it is pure gold.
The Maharaja Combo. Perfect dinner for you and your date. Share this easily among both you as you share your love for each other. Mutton kasha here is heavenly.
Fish sizzler. They serve pure Basa for 200 bucks! Reason enough for you to have it.
It's always great time coming here.

I am a huge fan of this palce to be honest. I just love this place. Its just near my school, often after school and tuitions we visit this place. This is a perfect place for teenagers like us who had a limited pocket money. 126 bucks for Chicken Biriyani combo is not at all costly, when you're getting 2 kebabs, one egg, potato, good chicken piece in Biriyani and chicken chaanp. One of my fellow foodie friend introduced me to this heavenly place and am thankful to him. The Biriyani is good, light. The kebabs are to die for & chaanp taste good as well. Their veg thali is also awesome. A must try for everyone. I love their decor as well, specially the books they had ‚ù§ These place remains almost full, so maybe you have to wait few mins for a table, or you can book in advance.

Found out this place through the recommendation of a friend so thought of paying a visit. It is just behind Lake Mall which was easy to find. Not a big place, has 2 floors which are full most of the time. Well being lucky we did not had to wait. We were offered a table on the 1st floor. The place really small in which the tables were stacked like playing cards. You can literally have a nice look at the food they are having as well as take part in their conversations of the adjacent table. Least privacy was provided which was really irritating. The place was decorated keeping in mind the late 18th century. Many old antiques were displayed like telephones,radios old clocks etc which was kind of nice.
Well now coming to the food. We ordered biriyani combos, vegetable polau and chicken tikka masala. The combos were really good and filling. They provide kebabs and chicken chap with biriyani that too in 150bucks was just awesome. The biriyani tasted real good and the quantity was alsi enough. Well the poalu was not that tasty. I've tasted better in other restaurants. The chicken tikka masala was okayish. The pieces were kebabs which were immersed in the gravy and served.
The service is quite slow. Had to call upon the waiter several times.
N.B - Good place to have meal by not burning a hole in the pocket. My suggestion is to go for biriyani combos. They too had chinese dishes but really cant review them as I have not tasted.

Tandoor House defines the term 'Pocket Friendly', providing those delicious Biriyani Combos. A bit crowdy most of the time but a good arrangement makes it convenient. Overall a nice place for a satisfaction of tastebuds and pocket both.

Tandoor house is located just behide lake mall..
Its a small and cozy restaurant wid limited sitting arrangements
Some maintainance works were going on..so we had to wait a bit to have our table..
They had a small menu card with a limited no.of dishes..maybe 10 or 12..
I heard they also serve chinese bt however we didnot have any such options..so we ordered biryani combo..which was pocket friendly and it had 2 kebabs, one leg piece..one potato..one egg..rice and 1 piece chicken curry..
I loved d combo..enough for one..and also very budget friendly..130 only..

Superb biriyani deal...loved the food at such a reasonable price. Ambience and the decor was pretty good. Waiters were cooperative but little delay in service owing to the overwhelming orders of the combo mutton biriyani. Nevertheless it offers great food at a great deal so its worth the wait,look forward to another visit soon!

Tandoor house is situatued at the backside of Lake Mall. This restaurant is famous for thier meals which come at a very cheap rate. Always crowded with students it has a nice ambience and decor which I did not expect. Service is very quick over here. Coming to the food I tried out the Chicken Pulao meal which cones for 110 bucks. It had chicken pulao, lasuni kebab, chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken tikka buyter masala. Pulao was very sweet and other items lacked the essence. Still remembering the price I admit that they are doing a good job.

So to start with the Ambience.. It was very nice with a vintage look.. But a bit crowdy.. The price was really really pocket friendly.. The must have dish there was the tandoori combo.. 5 different tandoori..each of them are very nice.. I have tried the biryani combo also.. It was also lip smacking.. Tandoor House

Tandoor House is mainly known for the meal combos at pocket friendly prices.
The quality of food is not excellent and not very bad at the same time.Tandoor House even fails to retain the quality of the food sometimes.
Thus,visiting Tandoor House seems to be a game of destiny.If an individual is fortunate enough he would definitely get the good quality food on that very particular day.On the other hand ambience would seem to be quite good.

Today on the occasion of Rabindra Jayanti, I visited this budget friendly restaurant for the 3rd time. The best thing I like about the place is that it's quite affordable and the quality and taste of this is quite good. This restaurant is quite popular among local residents as well as among people from different parts of Kolkata and is therefore always crowded. It is famous for its combo menus and the delicious chicken Sizzler.Menu: Check out the menu here.(The menu is of the Golpark Outlet, and the review is of the Lake Market Outlet. The menu is, however, the same in both the outlets)Location: It is located just behind Lake Mall in the Lake market area. It is recently shifted there from its previous location.Click here to get the location on Google Map.Coming to the review:¬†Ratings: 5/5 for location, 4/5 for staffs behavior, 4/5 for taste and quality, 4.5/5 for pricing, 4/5 for atmosphere and setup.Staffs Behavior: The behavior of the waiters and staffs working here are decent and good. They explain the dish properly and its friendly in nature. Giving tip completely depends on you and its not necessarily needed. VAT applicable on all items. Taste and Quality: The taste and quality of the food here is average. It's not very good or excellent but quite ok. But I can say the best in comparison to the other restaurant in the similar price range. The foodPricing: The price of the food items are normal and satisfactory Combos are superb. This place is extremely¬†pocket-friendly and one will not believe it until he/she hold the menu. Biriyani combos start at Rs.110. Best place for cheap and delicious biriyani. The quality is also ok in comparison to the price. VAT is applicable. Service¬†Tax is not applicable.

Visited this place almost after a year. It is located near lake mall. It is well decorated. Space is not sufficient..but it's ok to accommodate as their seating arrangement is nice. 
One must try their chicken wings kabab and biriyani combo (for biriyani lovers). It's very delicious. We ordered  chicken wings kebab and paratha combo. Parath combo was served with chicken rezala and 2 piece chicken hariwali kabab.

One of the most pathetic restaurants have ever come across. Waiters don't know how to behave with customers. Moreover we asked the manager to switch on the light and AC they refused directly and has the audacity to say to go out of the restaurant because they cannot switch on the ac and light. Such things if happen before ordering any food only.. Manager is really foul mouthed.. and moreover to show a fake crowd they are making customers wait in long ques inspite of the entire second floor remaining empty.. worst experience ever.

This place is pocket friendly,and good for students,this place is usually filled by youngsters. Everyone orders the biryani combo which comprises of a plate of biryani,2 pieces of chicken tikka kebab and chicken chaanp. The mutton combo was for 130. The biryani was okay,the tikka pieces were tough and the chaanp was bland,cold and tasteless. The pulao combo had two chicken preparations which were again ok. I mean what can you expect at such a cheap price!

Well,this is a very popular place among the college students mainly due to the combo offers. The combo prices are really really cheap. 110-130 plus extra taxes and you get a full meal. The new place near the lake mall is really spacious and the ambience isn't bad. But the quality of the food is not up to the mark. We tried the polao combo where we were given 2 separate dishes of chicken, and in both of them the size of the pieces were pathetic. Also the thing they called as polao is in no way polao. You can call it Chicken rice but not polao. 
The Biryani combo isn't bad though. Giving it 3 stars only for the cheap price.

I visited this place with my friends a few days back, it's easy to locate as it is behind lake mall, rashbehari. Tandoor house needs no description as this place serves some of the best combos in the city. We ordered the biryani combo but it was a bit too oily. Kebabs were nice. Chicken was fine. If you're running low on money this is definitely the place to step in. A good place for college students undoubtedly. The ambience is fine and staffs are good too. We didn't had to wait long for food. Overall this is good place to be in.

Located right behind Lake mall , this is a pretty decent outlet for feeding your hunger at a cheap price. 
We tried the biryani combo and then indian combo ... both for just 110/- . We also tried ice cream with chocolate sauce. The food is good and the quantity is marvelous. 
They need to work on their hygiene though... the glasses were not clean and the bottle they served us for water was dirty with something floating in it.

Easily the best place for a combo meal, perfectly "made for each other" - helpings and value for money. A chinese combo or a chicken biryani combo costs Rs. 110.00 (mutton biryani combo is Rs. 130.00) while a paratha-rezala-chicken hariyali kebab combo costs Rs. 120.00 which we ordered today and I could not finish the second paratha! The piece of chicken in the rezala is reasonably big (leg and thigh or breast), so are the two pieces of the kebab; while the parathas were non-greasy yet soft and fluffy and "loudly claim" that size does matter. No wonder the place is always crowded and has become a favorite across all age groups. Authenticity takes a back-seat though. They have shifted to a bigger place on Parashar Road, just behind Lake Market. The signature dish - the paratha-rezala combo.

Tandoor House is this really pocket-friendly place near Lake Mall. Its pretty small and the ambience is  dull but apart from that the food was pretty good for the price. We ordered Chicken Combo and Mutton Combo both of which was satisfactory at least as far as the price is considered. They definitely need to work on the kebabs. Also the service was not that great. Apart from that, its kinda good and pocket friendly.

Tandoor house is known for its biriyani combo. Being very frank, i didn't like the taste of biriyani at all. The chicken side dish along with the combo was the worst. The quality of the food is very poor. Only d chicken kababs along with the combo was a bit better than d rest. To offer food at low rates, it serves cheap quality food. Not at all recommendable.

The ambience is soothing with mild music playing in the back ground. Best place to hang out with friends because it feels comfortable and private. All in all the resto is good looking. Now talking about the food. One must try the sizzler's. It's delicious with reasonable price. Basically,tandoor house is famous for it's combo's. A lot of people is fond of their Biriyani combo's! Very much pocket friendly to have a super lunch or dinner with family. The combo's include - chicken/mutton biriyani,one boiled egg,two chicken tikka, chicken chaap @ only Rs110 for chicken and Rs120 for mutton. More than Enough to feed your tummy! I don't know what is their recent price because they have shifted to another location. There must be some change's..
You can also try their other dishes too.

Was looking for a cheap North Indian and found this one. They recently moved to a much bigger place than they used to. It's nice decor with comfortable seating arrangement . Now coming to the food we ordered Chicken tandoori and their Biriyani combo. They Tandoori was soft and tender but way too spicy and they didn't even served it with chutney, we had to ask for it. They biriyani was too oily same goes with the Chicken chap. Kabab was burnt. At first I was overwhelmed with the cheap prices here , but then after having the food, not so much . I will say this if its not the end of the month and thats not the last penny of your pocket don't visit here , it's not even worth that penny :p

This restaurant perfectly goes with youngster's pocket budget.one of the most frequented college hangout places of kolkata,Tandoor House has two outlets:one in Golpark nd other in southern Avenue.If you wanna go to date with your partner, this place with its modest decoration and dim yellow light will satisfy your taste buds as well as your pocket budget.

Well,apart these the most important thing which differs this restaurant from others is their SPECIAL COMBO offers.i tried all of their combos.first comes Chicken combo biriyani- chicken biriyani+3pieces kabab with chatni+chicken chap in just 100
Polao combo consisted same items with same price.
I tried also chello kabab platter which is 150 but not so good like their biriyani combo. U can also try Thali within almost same price of combo biriyani ,offers you as a best option when you are hungry but low in budget. staffs are good.

So,foodies u can try this place on your next hungry eveninh or noon and it will not dissatisfie your taste buds with its such cheap budget...Rakesh Saha

Go here if you wanna save your pocket. 
This place is so cheap that you'll be full in about 150- 200bucks. They have a superb Biriyani Platter that serves chicken/mutton biriyani, two chicken tikya Kebabs and Chicken chaap at merely 110/130 bucks as the case maybe. They serve 10 pieces of Chicken Kebab at just Rs.130. 

The only irritating thing about this place is that it keeps you waiting in a queue and that can take up to 30-40minutes at times. Also, it's very noisy and disturbing inside because the tables are very close.

Coming to the food. The food was very cheap and taste was quite average like one just can't expect better food at that price range. 
The sizzler was very decent not the best but very decent. 
The biriyani was good too along with the chicken chap and kebabs. 
Didn't  like roasted chicken it tasted too sweet and buttery and also the chicken was not fresh. 
The biriyani combo is a must try. I will definitely visit this place when I am on a tight budget.

I went there many times.I like their combo offer.
Birayni is just awesome yaar.
Chinese combo is also good.
Polao combo is okay types.
Butter Rice combo is average.
its really pocket friendly. Don't expect huge quantity.But its enough for one.
But definitely try two items:-
1) chicken sizzler(Huge chicken will be there with 1bowl of rice-which is enough for two)
2) chicken wings-just too good.
Must visit this restaurant. Pocket friendly and that too delicious.

A combo of Chicken Biryani with 2 chicken kebabs and Chicken Kasha for Rs.110, of decent taste, is kind of hard to find in Kolkata! Well, Tandoor House is the place! With a befitting ambience and subordinate accommodation, this place is mostly famous for student hangouts! Service is a bit slow. Recommended for tummy filling food at a cheap price!

Tandoor House is a famous student hangout located at southern avenue. The place is pretty congested and somewhat claustrophobic, difficult for tall people to move around. The ambiance is average, with very dim lighting.
I've had their famous biriyani combo which consisted of chicken biriyani, two pieces of kebab, chicken and kasha. The quality of food was very poor.
            Had their chciekn tangri kebab at an event recently, it was over spiced and hot to an extent which would make you feel sick afterwards.

Obviously one of the best places to eat dine in, in Kolkata!
Tandoor house is located in a small quite lane, and might be a little difficult to find for the new visitors. Being a regular, I'm quite fond of the food there. The food is filling, and moreover it's pocket-friendly. Although cheap, the taste and quantity of the food is at it's best always. I personally love the combos offered there, specially the Chicken biriyani combo and Shahi pulao combo. The chicken tikka kebab is equally tasty. It's probably the best place to hangout and dine-in with friends due to it's pocket-friendly cost and great ambience.
Being quite small, you may have to wait longer on weekends and holidays. Customers opting for parcel foods don't have proper sitting arrangements. They are made to wait outside the restaurant with a few scattered chairs. Their service is also unresponsive and delaying at times.
Overall, a nice place to dine-in, but go with ample of time if you go on holidays.

Standing tired in front of Menoka Cinema, we were busy surfing Zomato for a dining restaurant nearby. We were served with tasty Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Chanp and soft tandoori rotis... Inspite of being there in such a rush hour of Panchami night, the foods were prepared nicely and amount was good. Most important is the pocket pinch...which is low in comparison to the quality of food and position of the restaurant.

Tandoor House is best known for their Biriyani thali... and some other different thalis... In Biriyani thali you will get Biriyani with one leg piece of chicken and with one egg along with 2 piece of tikka kabab and one chicken chap..and all these costs only 110 excluding tax.. Quantity of the food will surely satisfy any hungry soul...but i must mention that the quality of the food is very ordinary. And the interior is ordinary too...Actually it is a pocket friendly restaurant...the only thing which is special about this restaurant is you are getting 4 or 5 items in thalis in such a low price...

Located on one of the many calm sidewalks in the city, Tandoor House stands out just enough to seem inviting on a hungry afternoon. It's a decent and small place with good decor and filling menu. We ordered  Chicken Biriyani Combo, Tandoori Chicken and Coke. The service was slow and unresponsive at times. The food didn't disappoint though. Was very filling and delicious. Their menu could have a better variety but I guess that's what makes this place a comfortable pocket-friendly place.

Tandoor House is located at southern Avenue opposite of Nava Nalanda School.This place serves both Chinese and Mughlai Dishes. Whenever you want to eat good food but you are low in cash then this the place you should visit. This place remains always full. Their combo thali's are the best option when you are low in budget.

We tried : Tandoori Chicken, Chelo Kebab platter(Don't expect quality like Peter Cat) and their Famous Chicken Biriyani Combo which came with Biryani rice, two pieces of Chicken Tikka Kebab and one plate of Chicken chaap. 

The quantity was sufficient for both of us. Staffs were decent and the service was good. I would recommend everyone to visit this place at least once........

The hunt for cheap restaurants offering good food led us to this place. This place is indeed small and can't hold a lot of people but the food they serve makes it all worth the wait. We ordered chicken biryani combo and chicken sizzler. The quantity of the biryani is enough for two people. The biryani tasted awesome. The kebab was well cooked as well. However, I didn't like the chicken chap. Felt that the chicken was a bit undercooked and didn't match the standard of the other two dishes in the combo. Coming to the chicken sizzler I think I can tell that it is the best thing I've had in a long while. The quantity of the food is enough for two people. The staff were courteous and I am quite impressed with their conduct. Eagerly waiting for their opening near lake mall.

This place is very economical to have biriyani. I went there with my friends and ordered the combo pack and I must say that comparing by price it was slightly over average. However, there is very limited seat and the restaurant is also not very spacious. Most of the time you can expect to wait in a queue before having your seat.

I have been to their golpark outlet earlier. They have limited seats here,so we had to wait outside for 15minutes. We ordered the biriyani combo and chelo kabab platter. The food was served soon. The biriyani combo worth rupees 110 contained biriyani having a big piece of chicken,egg and potato with chicken chap and two pieces of chicken tikka kabab. The amount of biriyani was good..taste was good. Better than the biriyani I had at their golpark outlet...the chap was yummy,so as the kababs. Perfectly cooked. The chelo kabab had two mutton seekh kababs,one chicken kabab..Butter rice and one sunnyside up egg..along with salads. Taste wise both the dishes were good..but lacking few flavours according to me. But this amount of food,at this price is really great. üòÉ So I wl be visiting this place soon for the biriyani combo. üòã

Location wise convenient. On southern avenue at a 5to7 mins walk from the kalighat metro station,this restaurant has a space issue. The restaurant has 2 floors but both are very small. The biriyani combo is a good choice whch serves you a moderate amount of biriyani,2 pieces of chicken kebab and one piece of chicken chanp at around 120 rs. But the day we went,we were served cold and stale food whch was a huge negative.

If you want to have a satisfying meal with a meagre amount in your pocket, this is the place for you. The place is best known for its biryani platter, which includes 2 pieces of kebabs, a full plate of biryani along with a side dish for around 120 bucks. The Chinese food isn't anything to write about, which should be expected considering it is named Tandoor House. The place is a little dingy and small, but the food is worth it.

I have been to this place for quite a number of times, and there was not a single time that I didn't have to wait for a seat. Anyway, food is average. The biryani combo is good but not that authentic Kolkata biryani, chicken sizzler was a disaster, and the fish steak was still alright. But the good thing is, it's easy on pockets. Mostly visited by college students.

Well! This place was quite a surprise for me. If you are a student or running out of money on your date this place can act as a saviour. They are popular for their combo meals @110 bucks. You need to stand in a queue any day you visit and the reason is quite obvious.
Biriyani combo consists of biriyani (chicken /mutton), two pieces of chicken sheekh kebab and chicken chanp. Tastewise they are good enough considering the price.
Chinese combo includes fried rice/Hakka noodles with Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Chilli and a Mixed Veg, tastewise they were @average but I won't complain just because of the pricing.
Now coming to the ambiance, the first floor is crampy but decorated tastefully. Ground floor has a very simple d√©cor but it is much more spacious. Overall the first floor is better.

RECOMMENDED: Biriyani combo.

Cons : 
1. Had to wait a little bit due to unavailability of seat.
2. Little small in height....Head was almost touching the ceiling.
3. Rice quantity was little low. ( what more one wishes to get in 130 üòã)

Visited the place yesterday. It is a small place but the interiors with the decor and the red lights make you feel cosy. We ordered the biriyani combo which included biriyani, two pieces of kebab and chicken chaap. The quantity was too much and the taste though not the best, was not bad either. Such a filling meal at just 100 something! Definitely the place to visit when you're low on budget but really hungry too!

You can also check out the combo meals !!
A nice experience with my friends cause the money we spent was worth it !!
If you are roaming around southern avenue and you are hungry then you can try this !!
Surely not a restro where you will go by making plans or something like that it's quite average !!

A very popular joint among youngsters, college goers and when you are in search of a place where the pocket pinch is really less. Situated in southern avenue  in opp to nava nslanda school this place sreves both mughlai and chinese variety. There is a biriyani combo which comes witha chicken chap and is one of the most popular dishes. They also serve chelo kabaab but don't expect Peter cat like quality. There chicken hakka chowmein and chilli chicken is tasty and so is the chicken hot and sour soup.

Tandoor house, is a place for non veg foodies to go to , and have gud without tearing a hole in the pocket. It is located in southern avenue, and is pretty difficult to miss. There are two floors, and due to the space constraint, I had to go to the first floor. Wasn't such a good experience since it is not built for ppl who are tall. I had to stoop to walk around the place.
The food was pretty decent, if not awesome. 
Pros:
1. Good food

When you are running short of money yet craving some really good tandoori food, this is your place to be. Situated at Southern Avenue this branch of the tandoor house chain is the mother to all other Outlets in the city. You can literally fill your tummies for nothing more than 150 bucks here, which other restaurant does that? 
Now coming to food, the low price  doesn't affect the quality and quantity of food here in any way. 
The place provides amazing combos and the taste is Just sp ot on. 
Apart from the tandoori chicken , chello kebabs, chaamp and biryani the continental additions to the menu are also delectable. I personally love rye sizzler they offer with a choice of bread and rice.

Month end???short in pocket???Tandoor house is the ultimate destination... Seriously nowhere in Kolkata you will find so much of food just @100 bucks...Price is the main factor for this restaurant in southern avenue which remains crowded with college students...P.S-Avoid during puja(it can be the worst mistake of your life)...

Went to this Outlet as a part of Zomato Survey Week for Eid Special Mughlai Cuisine.. Outlet is situated quite a far distance from Gariahat More and is near Golpark to be honest enough.. Looked good from outside though I would prefer other restaurants looked better from inside rather than this... Anyway ordered take away from their Small Menu with not such interesting options though atleast for Mughlai Cuisine Freaks like Me.. Still ordered Mutton Biryani Combo Meal , Butter Tandoori , Navaratan Korma , Chicken Garlic Kebab out of the Menu.. The Parcel was a huge one with decent packing.. Coming to the Taste.. The Kebab was honestly superb and splendid.. It was neither too spicy nor too lame and raw but perfectly cooked with a soothing flavour of Garlic.. The Tandoori Roti was good enough and was a delight with the Fantastic Navaratan Korma that tasted brilliant with decent quantity.. Out of the Biryani Combo Meal.. I got Two Pieces of Chicken Regular Kebab.. Chicken Chaap and Mutton Biryani itself.. What made me dissatisfied was the Taste of Biryani.. Nopes.. It was not at all upto the Mark with the essence of Biryani felt bitter as it was quite more than pinch in Quantity perhaps.. Rice was not good enough but the Aloo and the Mutton was Very Good.. Mutton was super tender that probably added a taste to eat the Biryani.. Chaap was fine though not that impressive honestly but the regular Kebabs was fantastic again.. I think they should concentrate more on their Kebab Menus rather than side dishes that they make because seriously they make one of the Best Kebabs in South Kolkata area.. Overall only giving a rating and a bit satisfied because of their Kebabs that they are usually famous for actually rather than Main Courses that were not that excellent but still preferable to eat..!! Do check it out Everyone personally.. You may or may not like it..!! Depends on you personally..!!

If you are really low on your budget and still can't help craving for some lip-smackingly delicious food, well, Tandoor House is waiting for you. It's a small, cramped place with dim lighting, and the ceiling on the second floor might touch your head if you happen to be a bit tall. But who cares when you get a chicken biriyani combo priced at 100! The platter consists of a generous amount of chicken biriyani with its usual accompaniments, two pieces of chicken tikka kebab, a chicken side dish and salad. The quantity served is sufficient for an average foodie and most importantly, it leaves you without a hole in your pocket!

This restaurant is known for combo meals.. Specially biriyani combo. Tired other combos as well but didn't like that much.. We tired chicken roast too. It was kinda sweet and I really didn't like it that much. It was okay. Indeed a pocket friendly place. Best place when you're broke üòÅ

Tandoor house is a place where you can get some amazingly cheap combo meals. Its a small place. Quite clumsy also. But its better if you skip the ambience and directly concentrate on food.
Coming to food; I tried chicken biriyani combo and Indian lunch thali. 
Biriyani combo consists of a good portion of biriyani, an egg, 2 pc chicken kebab, and chicken chaap. All the items were quite good. And according to the price its actually super good.
The Indian thali had a portion of rice ( I cant call it pulao), one nun, 2pc chicken kebab( flavourless), dal makhani (tasteless), and chicken curry. I solely disliked this combo.
Next time I would like to try their sizzler plater.

The luscious fruit salad with ice cream..

Three of my childhood friends and I were meeting up after a long time so at one of their suggestions we paid a visit to this restaurant in Southern Avenue, and weren't disappointed. ¬†We took the chicken biryani combo which came at a really cheap price than you can expect! For really easy-going healthy food at remarkably affordable prices, this place can be reckoned with.

Well I also had their Chelo Kebab platter once, and yeah it was pretty good, thinking it cost me about a fourth of the so-called-great one of Peter Cat. I hope they keep their cheap biriyani combos up for us forever...

Went in there with friends for mainly the biryani combo and I was surprised to see such good food in such a low price. I mean how?? 
The combo only was priced at Rs. 110 and what we go5 in it was a plate of chicken biryani, one chicken chaap and 2 pieces of tikka kebab.. 
It was quite amazing considering the price of it.
I and ol my friends was delighted with it and looking forward to my next visit..
That's all folks, until next time :)

One of the most pocket friendly proper food serving restaurants Kolkata has to offer! Located a bit interior away from the traffic jams and hustle bustle this place is quite a dream destination of food lovers and especially chicken lovers who wish to eat their stomach full with half the price. The combo offers are the reason which attracts huge crowd of students and of course "first date" crowds. The badshahi pulao was love! The taste was so perfect with the gravy chicken reshmi kebab. The tikka kebab was perfectly spicy with a hint of sourness. The dry kebab whose name I'm forgetting was tasty too. I have loved the good food. After a long walk tandoor house is worth the money and wait. The long que didn't upset me after the food was served. I had even tasted the biryani. Chicken biryani way too tasty. I never expected that a biryani worth ‚Çπ110 would taste this good! The chicken chaap was lovely tho it had a bit more extra oil. Never the less,the food was highly satisfying! Thanks for the lovely food. I'll revisit here for sure! I have already recommended tandoor house to several of my friends.

Tandoor House is a dreamland, to put it very simply. At wonderfully low prices you get such amazing food, that you are likely to return again and again.
I will review the combos, for which the place is known, because that's what my friends and I ordered when we went there for the first time last week.
The biriyani was perfectly spiced and flavoured. It seemed quite fresh, unlike a lot of biriyanis which have the taste but also come across as somewhat stale. The chicken in the chicken combo and the mutton in the mutton combo were succulent.
Both combos came with a side of chicken chap ( tender meat and delicious gravy) and two small pieces of chicken kebab. The kebab tasted good, but had been dipped in an unnecessary amount of red food colour.¬†
As for the ambiance, it's like a smaller, shallower version of Peter Cat, which is not at all bad. There is a space crunch, but they said that they are moving to a new premises soon, which can accommodate a larger number of people.
A must-visit place if you love biriyani at incredibly low prices.¬†
P.S. You'll be shocked by the quantity!

When you are poor, this is your heaven!! This eating joint has been the greatest destination during our college life in Kolkata. Pocket Friendly Combos, especially the Biriyani one is quite amusing. Yeah, it's true that the taste of the Biriyani is not that great, it's also a bit oily. The Chicken Chap is watery. But still, you are paying 110 bucks dude and can't expect Arsalan for sure. For me, it's truly a great place for eating out with your gang when you are low on moneyüòÉ

One of the cheapest restaurants in Kolkata. Or maybe the CHEAPEST restaurant in Kolkata. I mean you get a combo of a chicken biriyani, 2 pcs of kebabs and a piece of chicken chaap at just 110! YES! JUST 110!

There are varieties of combos here to choose from. Now coming to the food. I always have the chello kabab but it's nothing compared to Peter cat's. And you shouldn't expect much at just 150. The tandoori chicken could have been better. Not properly roasted. Biriyani was okay-ish. Never had the Chinese so can't really comment. 
Service was good. Ambience is the one thing that I hated. 

Lastly at such low rates no should get their hopes high. But trust me this is a must visit for all of you. Give it a try. 
Like if you like the review. For any queries drop in a comment. Thank you.

You will get a biriyani thali along with a chicken side dish and 2small pieces of kababs in 100 bucks. Food quality is not very good but nt bad as well... not so much suitable for family lunch or dinner. but overall a nice place for hang out with friends.

A good place for some adda baazi but not really for made for family business. The place is quite cheap and hence food quality is not that great. I am judging this place on its veg food only and Indian veg food to be specific. This is quite stupid as its tandoori and I had veg. Additionally their sizzlers are good.

This is the parent outlet, small and chic. The interiors are done tastefully with really good and cheap combo offers. For 120 one gets biryani, 2 pieces of kebabs and a chaanp. What else is needed? They taste good. The chili fish is a must try here. Sadly the Golpark outlet is nothing compared to this. I would like the management to look into the other outlet as well.

Cheap, pocket friendly and thus student friendly. Their biriyani combos are really good for the deal. I am an ardent mutton lover. But I'd ask you to opt for the chicken biriyani combo. The mutton piece they give is pretty dry. I'd suggest not to go for the chicken sizzler, or chicken roast. They put in too much salt to be endurable. Same with the mutton shami kebab of their chelo kabab platter. Service is not prompt. I would recommend the golpark branch. It's much better, both in terms of ambience and food quality.

To transcend the distractions of everyday mind,step in to tandoor house and treat yourself with some delectable flavours of tandoor.

It's not only about the food they serve but the "price" at which they serve their cuisine.

It's very pocket friendly and thus an extra point.

Cheers Tandoor house,keep bringing smiles to our tummies.

Biriyani lovers, you ought to try this one. The Biriyani Combo Meal is perfect to kill your hunger in the tastiest way. Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Kabab and Chicken Chaap...gorge on till you lick your fingers. And that too for just Rs. 110.
Coming to the meal, you need not at all worry about compromising with your taste buds as the Biriyani is cooked as it has to be and tastes like any normal Chicken Biriyani. The Chicken Chap, otherwise good, would taste much better if the gravy could be made a bit thicker. And as for the Kabab...no complaints; simply delicious.

I have visited their Golpark outlet before and I must say that both of them are just superb in terms of their combo platter. But in terms of the ambience I liked the southern avenue outlet more. Do try to grab the seats in the first floor. The dim light and the soft music are a perfect combo. Now coming to the food, I had the mutton biryani combo and chicken wings kebab. The biryani combo is always awesome here. But somehow I didn't quite like the wings kebab. 
Overall it was good. Just go for the biryani platters if you are here. :)

Mouth watering dishes priced so low on banner kept in front of the restaurant, the very nicely decorated entrance, Rs.400 for two person tag on Zomato that is also in a place like Southern Avenue, all this is enough to make you enter into Tandoor House.

Location : Its straight from Kalighat Metro towards Lake View Road just at Southern Avenue.

Decorations : Entrance of the restaurant looked very impressive. Where inside it is divided into two floors. Ground floor is simply decorated & the upper floor reminds the ambience of Peter Cat. On table focused warm lighting, dark atmosphere is very romantic & perfect for a special date. Golden years superstar's photo frames on wall tells another story about this place.

Staffs & Management : Where their decorations & ambience are perfect for a special date, their service is enough to make it worst. They are so fast at serving that probably your girl would leave the seat & found another guy to date with in that time. Don't ever go over their when you are hungry, go their with full filled tummy & when your order will come you will be hungry till that time. Icing on the cake was their staffs, they don't even know what they are serving but they always behaves very confident. They served us Garlic Chicken in place of Szechuan Chicken & after we asked they said no its Szechuan with such confidence.

Foods : We reached there in a gang, so we orders so many dishes. But unfortunately I didn't found their so sold Chelo Kebab at that time.

Chicken Reshmi Kebab : 8 pieces of Chicken Reshmi Kebabs were decently served on a banana tree leaf. The chicken pieces were extremely soft & very well cooked with lite spices. Just after the first bite I understood why its Tandoor House. They are very good at making Tandoor & Kebabs. Reshmi Kebabs tasted heavenly good & just perfect. It is definitely recommended if you visit this place. Just the green sauce provided with the kebab wasn't good & smelt like alcohol in it.

Mixed & Chicken Fried Rice : After a decent starter we jumped into their main Chinese dishes with lots of expectations. But unfortunately we got disappointed. The fried rice wasn't cooked well therefore it was very dry & hard. Very less vegitables & chicken pieces were found. But big prawn pieces were there in mixed rice. Although the quantity was pretty good still the taste of it wasn't good enough to impress.

Garlic Chicken : Our order was for Szechuan Chicken & they served us this. After tasting it we found it not so spicy little tangy & sweet on taste. It tasted like sweet & sour chicken instead of Szechuan or Garlic. There wasn't much onion or capsicum pieces found but green chilli & garlic pieces were easily found. Anyway chicken pieces were soft, well cooked & somehow below average on taste. After we gulped all that the waiter came & rectified, that was Garlic by mistake instead of Szechuan. Seeing all this mess it seemed that they are completely dumb at Chinese dishes.

Szechuan Chicken : Thank god this time they served us Szechuan in place of Szechuan. However once again this tasted like something else. The gravy was only hot & with no spicy taste of Szechuan. The taste of chicken gone completely hidden. It was not how the Szechuan chicken be like, not in authentic Chinese style not even in Indo Chinese style.

Chicken Manchurian : Another Chicken dish and it crossed the level of disappointment. It was less Manchurian more streamed cornflower soup. Very less vegitables & very less spicy it was. Chicken pieces were soft & of medium sized. Once again it is not how Manchurian should be. It tasted very bad & doesn't mixed up well with their fried rice or butter nan.

Butter Nan : White puffy buttery nun just looked fabulous. It was big too. However it wasn't that much soft. Butter fragrance was absolutely missing that overall doesn't made it tasty.

Chicken Sizzler : Suddenly a sound coming towards the dining attracts my attention. Oh yes, its was my Chicken Sizzler knocking me. The Chicken Sizzler was served in a wooden plate. It was very very big & a big egg bullseye on it made it look so delicious. Everything was going great until I put the fork into the Sizzler. The chicken piece weren't well cooked therefore it became hard to cut or chew. Vegetables were juicy but in a pathetic non tasty gravy. It tasted much tangy & saucy. Rice served with it felt very dry & hard. Even after mixing the rice with butter & vegetables it wasn't good enough. Overall it tasted very very bogus. It will be my recommendation that even if you visit this restaurant please don't order this unless you really want to mess your dinner.

Pricing : Our bill for all those above mentioned dishes were Rs.1866 inclusive of 14.5% vat for total of 6 people. It may seem very low for all those orders, but belive me you are paying less by compromising on the food quality.

Conclusion : Tandoori House offers excellent priced foods, especially compared with the place like Southern Avenue. Its great for students hangout because they provide enough food quantity for lesser price. But its not for die hard foodies who doesn't want to compromise on the quality.

It's a small place, divided into two floors...the ambience n decoration was good, different pictures of renown personalities were used to decorate the wall,and also with a shelf full of books,mainly the guitar which is hung on the wall stole my attraction. It's a clumsy place, with very limited place to move. I went there two times,the service experience was different both the times...1st time the service was slow even they were not that we'll behaved. But the 2nd time both the service n behaviour were satisfactory. Last time we took chicken biriyani combo and chicken curry for each n cold drinks. It was pocket friendly but the taste was average (not impressed)..

Food is undoubtedly very good. Bt their services require a polish. Seems d staffs r bit slow. Overall it's always a great time at Tandoor House. A very good choice for having delicious food at very reasonable price. Nevertheless, all their combos r mind blowing. Must try.

Went there with a bunch of friends with a lot of expectations after hearing so much about the biryani combo at such low price. But we were so badly disappointed. The biryani was so bad, the potato was undercooked. N the chicken chaap was just inedible. None of us were able to finish the entire platter. I don't know if something was wrong that day or the food is usually that bad always. A really bad experience it was.

The ambience and service was fair though. 2.5 stars for that only!

The speciality about this is place is that they offer the best combo. The biriyani along with chicken tandoori and chicken kebabs is the best one could ever had on that price.

Too much pocket friendly. I visited here 4 times.  3 times with friends and another one with my Mother,  every time there was a satisfied smile on my face when I leaved the place... The mutton biriyani combo consist of biriyani with egg and potato, two chicken kababs and a chap at Rs 120 is simply unbelievable in a word,  same goes for chicken biriyani combo at Rs 100... Chicken wings platter at just Rs 70 is also awesome....want to visit here again and again...

Went there many days back and overall, quite a decent place. Food was good and the ambience was pretty cool. Pretty affordable price tags and very much affordable for the students and others who have a tight pocket.
Staffs too was decent enough and the restaurant is also quite easy to locate at southern avenue.

Best for biriyani and chelo kebab at the price range they offer. The cheapest restaurant i have ever visited. Biriyani comes with a side dish of chicken and kebabs which is great in such a low price range. Chelo kebab was awesome too both in quantity and taste. Only the seekh kababs felt a bit less juicy. Its a small restaurant, with suitable seating area. It might feel congested if it is totally full. Overall a nice place with pocket friendly items.

To celebrate our win in a project competition, me and my buddies visited this small restaurant on a sweaty afternoon. Had to wait 5-10mins outside before we could get a seat. It was really nice inside. The walls were tastefully decorated with nice lamps. Overall it was an unique experience. Coming to the food, we can't really complain given the negligible amount of money they charged for every dish. We ordered Mutton Biriyani Combo, Chicken Biriyani Combo, Indian Lunch Thali and Badshahi Pulao Meal Combo. The amount of rice in all the dishes was handsome and there were quite a few pieces of meat in each dish. The biriyani was good, as usual. The aloo was a bit salty and the mutton piece could do with a bit more boiling. But the veg dish was delicious. Overall, our meal was very good and we went home with a happy stomach.
P. S. To reach this place, come to Rashbehari More and walk left towards tollygunje into a small lane towards Golpark. 
P.P.S No tax was charged.

This restuarant in southern avenue serves the best combo meals of biryani,at the same time the price being pocket friendly! The price being a huge attraction for students.. the quality of the food is great compared to the price. The biryani combo comes with 2 kebab pieces,chicken chaap, a piece of meat, an egg. I don't think any other restuarant serves this combo at such a low price! üòä

The restaurant is placed in an extremely strategic position to be visited by every Kolkata resident. 
Try the combos at first. Their Biryani combo and Pulao combo are awesome and are served at a minimal cost not to cut a hole in your pocket. Beware of the timing, some of the combos are made unavailable after 4PM. 
The ambience is nice. Food is served fast. The place is small, so be alert when you are visiting on a holiday or weekends.

I BET!!!! THE BEST COMBO @ REASONABLE PRICE....NO WHERE YOU FIND IN ALL OVER KOLKATA.

* Combo rating : 10 on 10
* Ambience rating : 7 on 10
* Food quality rating : 7 on 10
* Food quantity rating : 10 on 10

* Location : Just 5 mins walk from Southern Avenue mor.

* Ambience : This Southern Avenue area is not for office goers,all residential houses and it is an age old area. So Food quality and quantity is more important here to run the business than a beautiful royal show off. So,don't go for ambience,its average.
They have 2 spaces for customer accommodation -
1. just you enter the restaurant and
2. on the 1st floor.
upstairs is very popular I must say because everyone was standing outside to get a sit on the top, yet there were empty chairs downstairs. I couldn't realize the reason. All chairs were full upstairs, so couldn't see the reason of its popularity ( may be very private space they provide upstairs).

* Food : Food combos are amazing here.
1. You cant get Badshahi polao combo @rs 110 ( including 2 chicken kebab and 2 chicken korma)

2. Can you imagine Biriyani combo is just @rs 130!!!! ( including 2 chicken kebab, 1 chicken chap, a big piece of mutton and an egg.

3. Chicken biriyani combo is only rs 110.

4. Indian lunch thali @rs 110.

5. 3 big pieces of chicken wings @rs 70 only.

6. Chicken lunch thali @rs 110.

7. Chello kebab @rs 150.
Quantity wise its just really amazing to me and the quality of the food was not at all bad.

* Price : Nothing to say on the price tag. Its not only moderate,but I think cheapest as our famous Dalhousie area. ( rating 10 on 10)

* Management : They are aware enough that in that particular Southern Avenue area lots of good restaurants around and if the restaurant wants to be in competition, they have to find new ways to catch customers. I like their ways of promotion.... less profit in 1 plate,but attract lot and lot of people all through the day. You can't expect @ 2 o'clock in the scorching weekday afternoon about 10 people waiting outside to get in.
Here management actually worked successfully and really deserve 10 on 10.

* Why recommended : Best food in cheapest price. All restaurant hoppers and small restaurant owners should visit once and see how restaurant business could work out successfully.

Tandoor House has been a hot topic for every foodie friends I have. The first time I heard about this place and about the offers of this place, I was shocked, yeah literally shocked. I was said that I would get a combo of Biryani, with Kababs and Chicken Chap which will cost me 100 bucks. This is crazy, because at this price i wont get anything like this anywhere. The first experience to this place was really exciting, I had the combo with great delight and after that I was a fan of this place. Yeah, I can say the quality is not of highest quality but it was decent and I was happy with what I was getting in that price.

AMBIENCE:
A vintage look, with a retro decor. The place has a classic bollywood flavour where you can see posters of actors, singers of yesteryears. The place is small and has two sections. The furniture are quite ordinary but it gives a vintage feel. The lights are too dim and its dark. The space has been utilised well along with the walls. The wall hanging and posters are attractive and matches their theme as well.

SERVICE : 
The service has been good with not much complains. The foods are served quite fast even though the house is always packed. The staffs are polite and give proper explanation to whatever you ask.

FOOD:
This is the most interesting sections among all, and the most important too. This place is known for its eye catching, super attractive combos which brings people regularly. When you visit this place you should definitely go for combos.

¬∞¬∞¬∞ Chicken/Mutton Biryani Combo : One of the best combo of this place. They give Chiken/Mutton Biryani with egg along with two kababs and a plate of Chicken Chap. The tastes are quite good and its good enough to have again.

¬∞¬∞¬∞ Pulao Combo : Another Combo which makes you feel that you have just got the right deal. As u get an awesome combo of Pulao with 3 different types of Chicken Preparation. All the dishes are basic and cannot be called great but you will lick your fingers thinking about the price you are paying for it.

¬∞¬∞¬∞ Maharaja Combo : As the name suggests its the maharaja preparation where you get four large pieces of Chicken along with delicious gravy with salad, rice and curd. The price is higher than all other combos but its worth.

¬∞¬∞¬∞ Chicken Wings Kabab : Its another great dish which you are getting in an unbelievable price. Just have it once.

You can definitely try all other combos but these are the ones which you should try once

LAST WORDS: 
One of the most exciting place where you will get some awesome combos in just unbelievable price and this is what will pull u down to this place. Want some good food, and spent less; you have got your place and its Tandoor House

A 4/5 for this place only because of Value for Money

One Word- ‚ÄúDisappointed‚Äù.

The only things working for this place are fast service and cheap prices. This place is located in a prime location on Southen Avenue, which I feel has solely contributed to the foot falls. 

We entered Tandoor House one fine afternoon and made our way upstairs. We ordered three chello kebab platters. The food was served within matters of minutes. Hence, if you are very hungry, just out of office and looking for a fast and filling lunch, Tandoor House should be your destination. 

But we were thoroughly disappointed with the taste. The Chello kebabs were tough, the rice over done and our moods spoiled.

I'd been here recently after my friends couldn't stop talking about it and endorsing it. But after hearing such a great deal about this place, I found the food extremely ordinary. Firstly it is a very small place and we had to wait half an hour in the sun to get inside. And then the food disappointed me. I'd ordered the non-veg thali which boasts of great dishes like naan, pulao, chicken kabab, chicken butter masala and dal makhani, but tastes ¬†very okayish. The veg thali tasted equallly drab. But the chicken roast was the best among the 3 irems. The only thing good aout this place is the pocket pinch. You get loads of food at super cheap prices and that is probably the reason for the low quality of the food here.Nevertheless, it is a good place for college goers who are eternally short on cash and always starving.

We ordered 
1. chicken sizzler with butter rice : I was very much satisfied with the quality and quantity.. It tasted really good. It was a bit sweet gravy with the smoky flavor. It has sufficient amount of vegetables also. 4.5/5
2. American chopsuey: huge quantity with enough chicken, prawns and vegetables !!  though the sauce should be thicker. 4/5


#Staff: they are well behaved, but not at all trained. I asked the server about the veg sizzler..he failed to explain the dish.

Totally love the ambience inside with retro collections, wall hangings besides binging on delectable delights. The most important thing is if you are a homebody trying to indulge yourself in binge eating then you should go out with your friends and family sometimes to get a hang of this Bangaliyana inside while teasing your tastes buds. I can vouch its veracity. Nice Vibes overall.

This restaurant is located at southern avenue just in the opposite lane of tollygunge ps. The ambience they provide is good but it's always crowded to be honest. It's a pocket friendly restaurant which provides good combos. Though their food quality is very average. I didn't like their biryani which was quite taste less and not actually good. Though The kebab was good. If you want to spend some time in a pocket friendly restaurant and also want to suffice your hunger then you must try this out.

Few days back I went to have lunch with my family members at this place with lots to listen from my inmates.The restaurant was well sort of space,looked clumsy and filled with people.Internal decoration is good. We ordered half plate Ch Reshmi Butter Masala and full plate Ch Tikka Masala,Dal Makhani and Nan.The food reached us within a short span of time.And now here comes the comments on food :-
1)Ch Tikka Masala - Quite good and tasty but the size of the chicken were very small.
2)Ch Reshmi Butter Masala - Just horrible.Thank God we only ordered half plate.The waiter claimed it to be sweet and but it was nothing as such and the curry looked dull and simply bad in taste.However the size of ch was good.
3)Dal Makhani - They need a chef who knows how to make a good dal makhani.Totally not its worth.Tasted was again not up to¬† the mark.
4)Nan - Good but not fluffy enough.
Waiters were neither very polite nor friendly.
Overall, it wasn't a good experience but yes as to what I heard and saw was the combos are cheap and that's what many have also commented upon.But apart from the combos, please avoid.

The really unknown best biriyani place in Kolkata. Mostly no one knows about this amazing place. But the reality is, it  serves one of the best and cheapest biriyani in town. 
The biriyani is extremely light and doesn't cause any indigestion problem. Suggestion is to take the platter which serves a plate of chicken chaap, two pieces of sheekh kebab and the biriyani with an egg. The cost of the whole platter is only, Rs. 100. This is way more than most other street biriyanis.

Highly suggested to everyone.

This place is located near Lake Club. Well went there. The place is neither too small nor too large. I found the golpark branch beautifully decorated then this one.There are two ways- either you choose individual items or go for combos to treat your taste buds. Individual items are so good. Considering the price, the quantity and quality is appreciable. For 100bucks its way too much pocket friendly. Me and my boyfriend ordered 1plate chic.reshmi kebab and one badsahi pulao combo.
Chic.Reshmi Kebab- i would give it 10 out of 5. Delicious. They have improved i must say. The kebabs melted in my mouth.  My boyfriend became a fan of their kebabs. 

Badsahi Pulao Combo- it was good. I felt a bit pinch of salt and pepper would have made the pulao hold a good place. The others side were good too.

Must try: Chicken Reshmi Kebab. 

Overall its a wonderful place. Appropriate for college and school students. Guys if u need to give a treat to your bunch of pals in a decent resto then go for this restaurant. You wont be deceived.

I don't review a place unless and until I've been there several times. As with tandoor house, I've eaten at this particular outlet for more than 20-25 times. Every weekend I used to go to rabindra sarovar and then while returning a quick bite at tabdoor house was a must.
And after being there for so many times, I have to admit.. Their food is highly inconsistent in flavour. I can't make this clear enough how inconsistent they are. Especially with their biriyani and the chickn roast they serve.
My personal favorites are..
Chicken biriyani combo, chicken maharaja, tandoori chicken, chicken roast, chello kebab.
I tried their noodles and chilli chicken once and honestly Chinese here is not that great.
Definitely pocket friendly. Cheers!

Whenever v go over dere only for the biriyani combo. Which is value for money. Ya the biriyani is not like arsalan or top notch biriyani counters. But it's indulge your taste buds . And pocket friendly too.

OK so here was a special meal I had and this place thus scores a little bit more for me! 
Now coming to everything else I would say there is nothing very exciting about this place neither is there a reason to not go there.
The best part is that they serve extremely pocket friendly food which is also very tasty! 
For my first visit I stuck to simple biryani and a side dish and I loved all of what they served. 
Also it seems like one comfortable place to be at.. For good food and some good talking! 
Cheers!! :):):)

A great place to hangout with your friends over delicious mughlai and north indian cuisine. The prices are pocket friendly withcozy decor and soothing lighting.
-------
We had biryani, tandoori rotis, paneer butter masala, chicken reshmi butter masala, and pulao.

The quantity was good and so was the taste.

An excellent pocket friendly place located along Southern Avenue...You will get a plate full of yummy Chicken Biriyani along with Chicken Chap and two pieces of kebab at only Rs.100....Even at such a low price there is no compromise with the quality and taste of the food over there....So it's a must visit when u have less money in ur pocket but you want a sumptuous meal.

A plate full of delight @100 absolutely the best deal possible. Also, its a nicely decorated  cute joint-When you hear such cheap price tags, you will automatically think its a shabby place but that's not the case here. Most of the time its crowded and why wont it be? They didn't open before 1pm on weekdays for lunch, so after waiting a while we got seated. Service time was fairly fast. 
Coming to the food, biryani was average, but loved the kebabs and also the chaap. 
But the average biryani doesn't seem to be a problem when you see it served  with egg , potato and a piece of  chicken, also two kebabs and chicken chaap. 
Verdict : amazing place for students who love to eat and not dry up their pockets.

Been to this place quite a number of times.Their ambience is nice,specialy the upper floor.The decor is quite interesting. Their Chicken Biryani Combo is not at all upto the mark but the Tandoori Chicken makes up for it.Perfectly cooked the meat is quite juicy and yummy.
The service was slow.
Pocket-friendly.

In this weather of irregular rains we decided to try a new food joint and in no time we reached this place!we had to wait for 5mins or so-which was unexpected( actually it was a rainy afternoon on a weekday ). That shows its popularity!Ambience isn't bad-it has a wooden feel with dim yellow lights!the lampshade above our seat was torn!so that was a disappointment!We ordered the chicken biryani combo and the chicken wings platter-food was okay as far as taste is concerned but when I consider the price it seems out of the world!the rice of the biryani was good-its chicken was small and cooked(not in the usual way the biryanis have and also had a little amount of curry with it) but wasn't bad,the chicken chap was nothing like what a chicken chap should b like! It was an extremely light curry and the kebabs  were excellent although they were just 2 in number!! But in 100rs what more can one expect? The chicken wings were good but I have tasted better chicken wings!but again it was just for 70bucks exclusive of tax! The overall bill was of INR 195.What I disliked was the service!water was served after we had almost finished our meal. Plates were served without spoon/fork. Even the mouth freshener plate didn't have a spoon!hence had to skip taking it!If you are on a budget and want to taste okayish food given the budget; try this place!

Tandoor house is an absolute food delight. This small eatery located at Southern Avenue specializes in delectable North Indian delicacies. They have seating arrangements both upstairs and downstairs. Though there is space crunch you wont feel claustrophobic. They have seperate dishes as well as supercheap combos! Trust me when I say supercheap. Me and a friend ordered two combos- I ordered the chicken biriyani combo which came with enough biriyani to fill a modest belly along with 2 pieces of chicken kebab and a piece of chicken chaap. My friend ordered chicken pulao combo. Both of these cost us 120 each! Yes you saw right its this cheap. Coming to quality, tandoor house is a foodie's paradise! That explains all. The chicken were soft and well made as were the biriyani and pulao. Give this place a shot and see yourself.

The lane on which this joint was setup used to be an old adda place of mine during those high school days, nearly 7-8 years back...Another reason that left me feel nostalgic was my high school (K.D Institution) which is situated just three to four blocks beside this joint.
¬†Okay, now two weeks ago on a chilling Sunday afternoon which also happened to be the coldest day of the season, i was returning through the avenue after finishing some work nearby...It was already 3pm and I was craving for Lunch...On seeing this joint, decided to set forth in order to fulfill my appetite. Anyways on entering , to my surprise i saw it was full packed and the waiters said it was also full upstairs..Eventually, waited outside for a while and after 10min a waiter called me and gave a seat in a room located upstairs on the right hand side....

Yes, the place is a bit cozy...But it has a good ambiance with attractive dim lights..Now whats special over here is that, ¬†u can really find some great cheap combos...priced betwn Rs100-200....They provide their lunch combos upto 4pm...I ordered the chinese lunch combo of Rice, chicken manchurian and chilly chicken and veg soup..Food was served within another 10 min..Quant was good acc to price...The chicken manchurian was good and ¬†so was the chilly chicken..Rice was okayish..Combo meal was Rs 100 priced with taxes extra !! Overall a good experience bt definitely would love to come back and try out their other items next time round...'Good food at a cheap price' thats the way i sum up !!

By far one of most pocket friendly resturant that i have visited. Located just beside republic of chicken lake view road. This resturant is known for its pocket friendly combos a is a hit with teenager and college goers. Had the chelo kabab was good nothing like peter cat but for Rs150 I cant complain also my friendly had Indian pulaocombo for just Rs100.It had chicken pulao two piece chicken kabab,two other gravy dish with two pieces chicken each. Staff is also friendly and ambience is also good. But sometimes you have to wait outside as it packed even on weekdays. The only con is serving time is very long they served after half and hour of taking the order. Overall a value for money resturant

This food joint is located in Southern Avenue beside Republic of Chicken. Needless to say, the Rs. 100 biryani or polao combo makes one crave for it. So many items in such a less price. The eye-catching price of the kebabs and the sizzlers attracts foodies here. Quality and quantity is okayish. Service is not that great. Interiors are okay too. The food taste needs to be enhanced. Besides that quantity is great which goes without saying. A 3.5 stars overall from me. Hungry? The wings kebab and the biryani combo will absolutely serve your purpose!

Me and my friend went to this restaurant according to his request as he had gone to this restaurant several times and so he told me that I can order biryani combo meals with only 100 ruppees..So I went to this restaurant and I ordered mutton biryani combo and my friend ordered chicken biryani combo meal.Biryani is okay, nothing so great about it. Also the chicken tikka kebab and chicken chap which is served with it, also taste normal. But I liked the chicken chap most.
   
After our meal, we felt little bit hungry and therefore we ordered a starter,fish malai kabab and it taste delicious. Their main attraction is combo meals and tandoori dishes which we didn't taste it. 
Overall it was a good experience for me,hope I can return to this restaurant another time to try the tandoori dishes.

The place is decorated with dim lights and pictures creating a gloomy ambience. The staff is well behaved and quite cooperative. Now comes the food,the non veg Chinese combo tastes very good and so does the chelow kebab platter. The biriyani combo is good,especially the kebabs, and the chicken wings kebab tastes pretty good too! In short very nice food joint keeping in mind the low prices.

Food is good and reasonable that is all i have to say about this place. The place is shabby and there is nothing to talk about the ambience or decor. It is famous for the biriyani combo and the chicken tandoori. This place is good if one is extremely hungry and is short of money. The biriyani combo that comes for 100(chicken) and 120(mutton) is served with chicken kebabs and another chicken preparation with gravy. Quality of food is also good.

Oh no! mind blowing combos at rs 100!! yes they served biryani combo with one plate chicken Biryani, two pieces chicken tikka and chicken chaanp at 100. tge biriyani is a little dry but considering the cost, its super value for money. although i thought the chaanp can be made a little better. my choice is the badshahi pulav and for the badshahi pulav combo they serve badshahi pulav, chicken kebab, chicken tikka masala and chicken reshmi masala. its filling and tasted very good. although the chicken pieces are very tiny. besides, they serve chinese combo, chello kebab and sizzler combo at different price points. the decor is also nice and has nice psoters of singers and others which add to tge ambience. a good try if you are hungry and dont want to spend much for a reasonable lavish meal. 

N.B. the combo prices are excluding VAT.

First time and also my last time,tandoor house gave me a  very pathetic experience..quite a big place but congested,thats okk..then after a long time they took our order from their puja special menu..we ordered chicken reshmi butter masala,roasted chicken and tandoori roti.. bad Chicken quality..but the main thing was chicken roast..what was that? for confirmation ,we called them and they were sure about that dish.. Rubbish dish with good amount of water(called gravy),peas, green chilli etc etc..and most importantly the chicken,they served 4 pcs,every pcs are full of cornflower,tasteless dish cost was 250..they charged 18% tax with too much bad service..great experience for me to taste their chicken roast,kolkata's worst dish no 1. (4 Big size chicken consisting no chicken only cornflower and a bad haunting smell)..for them only size matters not quality..

To begin with, I randomly found this place while browsing on Zomato. located in Southern Avenue, a bit near Republic of Chicken, this place is famous for their really cheap combo meals. When me and my cousin went there at about 3pm, the place was pretty much empty. The ambiance was simple and sober, with lamps and dim lighting. we chose a table on the ground floor, nd ordered butter nan, chicken reshmi butter masala, and chilli paneer. the staff was quite efficient nd they served our order within 5-6 minutes. coming to the food, it didn't really appeal to my taste buds. like, you won't really even get to know if they understand the difference between a normal tandoori roti and a butter nan. paneer was overcooked and, the chicken tasted kind of funny. quantity in both the dishes was great, but you won't really feel like eating much if the taste isn't good enough.

Now what can I say about this place apart form budget friendly, good food , very good atmosphere. if you are shopping freak like me then obvious you go to gariahut every now and then. Its been the best place to eat for after shopping craving for me. I have tried many combos they offers like chikhen biriyani, mutton biriyani, veg thali and also the sizzler. The biriyani in 100 rs is really unexpected in now days but these guys made it that thing. I always go there whenever i make time.

Recommended by my brother, got the Mutton Biriyani combo takeaway.

The mutton pieces in the biriyani were really fatty and smelled funny. The kebab was good, and the chaap was decent too.

The food is not the best, but the price definitely is. The value is out of this world.

Go for it.
Also another thing i tasted was Naan and matar paneer. Good

Veg Thali is really awesome at that price. 

Otherwise the place is more suited for Non-Vegetarians.

If you are not so hungry- a combo platter can be comfortably shared by two people.

It's a worth trying place - specifically if you love meat & tandoor ...

The thalis they offer is great.. Combo of biriyani with such kababs nd chap at such a low cost of 100plus tax is awesome.
Their new entry chicken pulao combo with 6 pieces kababs(2 pc starters and 4 pc gravy in diff recipes'  is lip smacking..

Great place with awesome food and quite povket friendly too. As the name suggests, their speciality is the tandoori chicken, make sure you try it out.

Only downside is that it is very small and cramped. If you don't come early you might have to wait long as it is generally full.

I have been to this restaurant a couple of times but slowly slowly their standard is degrading. I went last week and ordered Chinese the prices of all the menu are absolutely pocket friendly but the quality was not up to the standard and how it used to he 3 years back.. The quantity of food is still wholesome but if the food quality is not up to the  mark then you don't feel like hogging much.. I also parcelled a plate of biryani for home and that was comparatively better in taste. So I would recommend who want to eat within a budget to visit this outlet but do not order Chinese..

My experience with this place was quite good. Me and my cousin panned for a lunch here. We had to wait for some time before we could enter. Our seats were arranged at the second floor. To our disappoint the the table was small and the hanging lamp was hanging in a way that we could not even see each other. But the food was really good, we ordered for biryani combo, and that offers so many things together within just rs. 100. The food was tasty, adequate in amount and the kebabs were just awesome ;-) anyway apart from that hanging lamp, I liked everything about this place :-)

It's a small restro located at Southern Avenue. It looks like a special big restro from outside but is very small insive having two floors in it. The ground floor is very bright decorated with full of lights where as the first floor is very dark with a single dim light placed on each table. Hence me and my friend opted for the first floor.
The ambience is nothing that special its on the average side.
We ordered the much hyped chicken biriyani combos which contains a good portion of chicken biriyani with a medium leg piece of chicjen. 2 tikka kebabs and a pice of chicken chap.
Coming to the quantity of food i must say it is enough for a single person.
Quality of the dishes are moderate can't expect much better at this price hence its accepted.
The biriyani contains a piece of egg and mine having two small pieces of potato. The biriyani is okk but lacked the aroma a bit still it is less spicy which i personally like.
Chicken piece of the chicken chap was very soft but the taste of the gravy is on the sweeter side.
Then coming to the kebabs one piece of it was very soft but the other one was a bit hard.
Now coming to their services it was prompt but it still has a lot of rooms for improvement...

Went to this place with a few of my friends. The combo meals were highly recommended so we ordered them. The things we were getting at such low prices made us a bit skeptical about the quality of food but the food won us over. Where else do you get biryani with kabab and a chicken dish for Rs.120? Although the kebabs were a little dry it was still a great dish overall. Great place to go with your friends although seating arrangement can be problematic for large groups.

It was raining outside and we took shelter inside this awesome North Indian restaurant. Heard a lot about this place and it was worth all the praise. Ambience and decor is average and may be that explains why they serve such amazing food at a minimal pocket pinch. Although the Malai kebabs were not that great we expect to try better kebebs next time. Their tandoori roti was too crispy and for some reason i disliked it. The good point is their Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was way to delicious and I am coming back for it. Biriyani was awesome as well and served in great portion. Overall this place will win hearts.

As per the quantity nan was ok but biriyani was really less in quantity. The quality of the food was not good at all except d butter nan. The mutton in d biriyani was good but the chicken was d worst being hard and some not clean being some red spot in it. But the ambience was ok and the behaviour was also good.

Another visit and would still keep my rating unchanged.
Service is still the same and quality intact. 

Food: 
Chicken Biryani Combo(8/10): No doubt this is one of the most filling items! Every part of it is tasty and flavorful! Pocket Friendly as usual

Chicken Bharta(4/10): This one cracked us up! Tasteless gravy and chicken! Completely bland. 3 points goes to the boiled egg split. Don't try this unless you're a fan of this! 

Naan(8/10) : Nothing bad here. Good and soft. This doesn't hold any taste of it's to speak about. Decently sized. 

Cold Drinks: Now this is what you call overcharging! Rs 40 for a 200ml glass of coke/sprite! Seriously? Even the street vendors give 300ml for 20 in Durga pujas! Rs 25 would have been alright but 40 is insane!   Drink water, it's free! 


**Older**

The festive seasons takes away the combo meals which are the most value for money..
Its was Durga Puja Saptami 2015. No difference in quality of food.
For pujas, they even reduced their menu.
Comparatively small restaurant, Nice Ambiance, dimmed lighting and well behaved staff too.
Heads:4
Orders:
1 Chicken and 1 Mutton Biriyani
2 Chicken Tikka Masala
1 Chicken Tandoori(Full)

Biriyani(7/10)
Well cooked and very good in taste but , the quantity is very less, when you are paying Rs 130 and Rs 140 for Chicken and Mutton Biriyani you should be able to share a plate with 2 but the quantity isn't up to the mark in non combo meals. Egg was given. I can finish 3 plates of their Biriyani by myself .

Chicken Tikka Butter Masala(8/10): Simply WoW. There was an absolute blend if spices, cooked properly in oil. The Chicken was just kebab pieces but it was palatable. 8 pcs were served in each and I would come back for more!!

Chicken Tandoori(8/10): 4 pcs in a plate, we got 1 each. Well roasted and tasted much better than many other restaurants and its one of the cheapest in town. The quantity is also value for money. Soft,moist and well cooked Chicken Tandoori is what just melts in your mouth, sprouting the flavours all over your taste buds. The sauce provided with The Tandoori is tasteless, don't even try it.
DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.

I should think that the festive season affects their quality. Because the Chicken Chaap we tried with our Tandori Roti was below par. And I've heard lot about Tandoor House. Seating was tight but again, festive season. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was a lot better. There were no taxes applicable on the bill. Service was OK. Should go back sometime later.

Things are cheap. But the quality isnt that good. But still okay for the price.
The Biriyani Served wasn't warm enough.
Even the chicken was hard. Well that may be due to the time we went. But I have also visited Tandoor House before when the food was fine.
The Chicken Combo biryani will make your day at just 100 bucks. I have also seen people ordering Chicken Sizzler a lot. I haven't had it yet.
But this is one of the cheapest and good place in Kolkata I must say.

visited this place on the occasion my friend's bday treat on his gf's reccomendation nd it turned out to be a hit!!
a welcoming place with dimly lit ambience nd decent decor.. it ws crowded wen we gt dere nd at 4 o clock such rush suggsts dat it ws quite a popular joint in that area.
Coming to the food..we had ordered a mixed hot and sour soup along with malai chickn kabab as starter.. for the main course..we ordered chicken biryani combo,mutton biryani combo,butter nan ,mixed kulcha,chicken bharta and chello kabab platter...
Soup was very good and the kabab was decent..
The combo meals are value for money meals with decent portion of biryani rice,small sized potato,chicken/mutton.2 pcs of chickn tikka nd chickn chaap..the biryani ws average nd the pieces of chicken/mutton are very small..chicken chaap is not upto the mark..
Next, surprisingly both naan and kulcha tasted really good.
Chickn bharta was okayishly good nd it had an entire egg on it..the taste cud hv bn smoother..
The chello kabab platter had everything a classic chello kabab shud hv..but the chello kabab itself ws disappointing nd very dry..generous butter with nice portion of rice nd few grilled veggies accomponied it with a sunny side up poached egg. The reshmi kabab dat came wid d platter tasted gud..
Over all a nice place to hangout..with good value for money food..pocket friendly joint with good food.. :)

You get the combos at 100 rs only. I have been here twice. I had their chicken combo, tandoori chicken, non veg chinese combo and veg thali. Chinese food is not up the mark. The quantity is quite good. The quality of the food has improved a lot...worth visiting.

The restaurant is very pocket friendly if you want to take a combo. A number of combos are available among which all are not very delicious. The biriyani combo is really very good,you would get tandoori and chap ( chicken or mutton depends on the type of biriyani you wood have ). But last time we had a pulao combo whose quality was below expectation level. Quality of food would surely satisfy you with respect to it's cost.

Recommended: The combo meals are value for money. My favourite is the Mutton Biryani combo and the shahi polau combo. It's great for ordering food for functions too.
Thumbs up : love their restaurant playlist and atmosphere in general.

The biryani combo is really good. In just rupees 100 one will get a plate full of biryani a large piece of chicken, two piece of chicken kebabs and a chicken chap. Really it is good.
But another combo i.e. pulao combo is not at all good, in this case also in just rupees 100 one will get 1 plate of pulao and 3 chicken items but the thing is only the chicken items are good that too comparing with the pulao.

I will say it is one of the best Restaurant to get dishes at a reasonable rate . You will probably get the Best Lunch Dishes here at a Pocket Pinch of Rs 100. 
The place is a bit small inside and so, you may need to wait Outside . But, overall atmosphere is quite good.

If you are low on budget and want to enjoy a good meal either it can lunch or dinner then this place is a must visit. The quantity is huge as compared to their price. If you go there for lunch they have happy hours that time from 12pm-4pm on several combos both veg and non-veg. We tried their chicken biriyani combo, chello kebab, chicken wings and crispy chili babycorn. Among all of these crispy chili babycorn was not up to the mark. The only downside of this restaurant is that it's not so spacious and most of the times you gotta wait for vacancy. It's an ideal restaurant for students.

In the afternoon it is filled with office goers who hop in there for lunch and there's a long queue. I had the Chinese combo as well as the Biriyani combo, both tasted good and are value for money!

Now I am writing about a restaurant which was in my list from my early college days....but if there is a will there's a way....first time I failed to find this place....first of I want to tell u the location...reach kalighat metro station then from there a five minutes walk towards tollygaunge.... At southern avenue...now conning to it's ambience ..pretty good comparing to other pocket friendly restaurants..has two floors....ground floor has no privacy but its decent ...good for bachelor's..and aged persons...the second floor is really nice....the waiters are well behaved...sitting arrangement is really good....good place to give treats as its really pocket friendly with the delicious combo meals....yeah ....we ordered one chello kebab platter,one mutton biriyani combo, one chicken tikka masala ,nun,green salad...
The chello kebab was average
Biriyani combo was awsm...a must try
Chicken tikka masala at 130 but it was really spicy gravy with soft tender tikka kabab pieces
Nun was huge in size ...one nun is enough for two

The waiters was well behaved... Service is good our food served in ten minutes...

I am giving it 4.5 ....that's it don't think about money just eat to your heart out...
Thank you

Another gem in Sadan Avenue. It is 'The place to have dinner' . If you like having cheap food at a place that seems expensive ,this is it ! Tag your friends along for a birthday treat ,your friends will have their stomachs full but your wallet won't be empty. They don't make such restaurants no more . 
Try out the combos for best value for money

Chelo kebab platter was also satisfying. Chicken cravers can easily check in for a heavy and tasty meal without being concerned about too much cost.

I gave it a 4.5 star rating simply because of its trippy ambience. The dimly lit joint enhanced with the red color of the lamps hanging above make it one of my favorite places to hang out with friends. This place is known for biryanis and mutton. Food is average. Pricing is also average. Would recommend to anyone fond of non veg on a lazy sunday afternoon.

If you are really hungry and have a minimum budget of 200 rupees in hand, you can just head towards this restaurant. Located in Southern Avenue, this place offers a platter of Mutton biriyani containing: Reshmi Kabab, Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Chaap for just Rs 120. You can also relish the chicken wings Kabab(4 pieces) for Rs. 70. There are a multiple of platters that you can actually gorge on. They are fully satisfying in amount and tastes decently good in regards to the prices.
Will definitely get back for the chicken roast soon. It is pocket friendly and an ideal lunch or dinner destination for college goers.

Tandoor house is in a word very pocket friendly place to have  a nice and casual dinner with frnds. If u r really out of money and still hungry u can try out this place. This place serves a variety of thalis but the most famous being the biriyani combo. 

Location -- it is located at the lane diagonally to the main road connecting rashbehari and mudiali. If u walk from lake market,  take the lane just beside lake mall and radhu babus. Cross the road and tandoor house is here. 

Ambience -- the resto looks quite decent from outside. Fairly lit up sign boards. From inside a small amd cozy environment with dim lights specially the upper place. Quite an intresting place to have ur dinner. 

Food -- i have had tasted combos from hanglatherium and according to me they were better..but considering their price difference and individual price i can bet this is all u can get at this rate. 
The biriyani was quite dry and oily. The rice was dry but soo much oil. The chicken piece was decent. 
The kebab was too small to see. And that was not two but a single piece broken into two. 
Chicken chap was moderate. It lacked the typical chap taste and so tasted more like normal chicken preparation. 

Overall fair enough at 100/- bucks. Can give it a try if u have a big hole in ur pocket.

If you are broke completely and looking for good food, this is place to be. This restaurant is located in the southern avenue connector from rashbehari. (This lane is that diagonal lane from the tollygaung police station). The interiors of this place is pretty nice. Somewhat retro themed. The food quality is good given the prices. I have had their mutton biriyani combo. Everything was good about it, except for the mutton; would have been better if the mutton piece was softer. 
Overall my experience was pretty amazing. Looking forward to visit this place again.

This little pocket friendly restaurant is a sheer winner when it comes to combos. Indian, Biryani and Chinese, all three are great in quantity and price. Its a sure satisfactory lunch with any one of these.¬†
Order and service are always on time.¬†
Other items in the menu are worth trying and are sure to please all taste buds.¬†
The interiors are neatly done and the seating (although less spacious) will make you feel comfortable.¬†

If you want to have good food and if you're low on cash,THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE.They serve a brilliant biriyani combo platter.Chicken biriyani(with a piece of potato+boiled egg),two pieces of chicken kebab(they keep varying from tikka to reshmi) along with Chicken chaap,and this whole platter comes for 100 bucks !! Their tandoori chicken tastes great as well.But never ever go for their sizzler platter.It's almost like chicken curry and they serve plain rice with it(with cold,yes COLD butter on top which does not even melt).

Located at southern avenue near kalighat metro station , this place gives your tummy exactly what you need without burning a hole in your pocket. They have this platter system which i personally favor where you get chinese or biriyani or sizzler.. anything you like. Sizzlers are accompanied by either "gobindo bhog " rice or roti . chicken sizzlers are very nice both taste wise and quantity wise . I like their biriyani platter which contains a full biriyani with chicken , egg and potato in, kebabs and chicken chap as sides only @100.
So just check out this place for a tasty lunch at such reasonable price.

I had been here few times and tasted their Mutton Biryani combo, Chelo kabab platter,and Sizzlers with bread..fast service and pleasing taste keeping in mind the price! The place is bit small but with good decoration and decent ambience!

Tandoor house,sounds expensive n snazzy specially considering its prime location at the southern avenue. But don't be fooled by it as this place is a heaven for food lovers specially on the end of the month. 
Ambience: Very simple,minimalistic n sober. Cozy place to eat out. The kitsch decor is pleasing and full points for the music they play which really sets the mood.
Food: Taste wise nothing extraordinary and the quantity is also not so much.
Service: Prompt and quick. I liked it.
Price: The usp of this place is the dirt cheap price of food. The biryani combo is a real winner with college kids Lk myself.

This is a quaint little place on Southern avenue which we found after browsing through zomato while in the area. The ambience inside is good but not great. And the place is a bit too cramped. The food although is quite excellent in fact. We had ordered for tandoor wings (which is a very popular and tasty offering of the place); navratan korma, chello kebab, chicken bharta, peas polao and butter naan. All of the items were up to the mark except the chello kebab which was a bit dry and tasteless. A special mention about the navratan korma. Its one of the finest in the locality if i am not wrong. The whole meal was ample, filling and did not burn a hole in our pockets. Bon apetit!

This was one of the worst experiences happened to me. Located at southern avenue, this place seems good frm outside nd i don't have any complaint with the ambience as well. 
But the worst part is food... As the menu suggests they serve "chelo kabab" or I must say a very very poor version of the legendary dish. The kebabs were literally burnt, the rice was under cooked nd I wanted to kill myself fr such horrible decision. My friends tried the combo meal nd they were equally horrible. I swear I wont ever keep my feet here. 
Though this place is friendly on ur pockets but I don't compromise with quality.

This place is in my favorites list because of the availability of Combos. The Biriyani Combo, the wings and the thalis, these combo dishes are best attraction of this place. And the added factor is their low prices. The Biriyani Combo is just ‚Çπ100 and it comes with 2 Kebabs, 1 chicken piece, egg and 1 chicken chap. Though the quality isn't that special but the low prices compensate that. When u've a low budget, u should visit this place..

Heard a lot about the biriyani combo so I went to try today. One word..'Overhyped'..
Yes yes the biriyani is cheap...yes I know where else can u get an egg,a Chicken Chaap,2 decent pieces of Kebab and all within 100. But it doesn't appeal to my taste buds...not one bit.
The chaap was awful..the rice was kind of bland. We had to take a Raita to go ease it down.
But full marks for decor and music...First timers...try the non veg indian thali.

Went there with my mom since it's her childhood restaurant (then known as Southern Cabin). They have renovated with a modern approach taking care of paintings, lamps, music and dim lighting which was good.
We tried the Biriyani combo, which consisted of biriyani, 1 pc Chicken/Mutton, 2 pc kebabs, 1pc Chicken/Mutton chap and an egg if its chicken Combo. (Yes it was more than enough at such a low price)
The taste was ok, biriyani was not soaked in oil, which I liked.
But the Chicken chap was served cold (not freezing cold, but not at all warm).
Also I found a strand of hair in the Biriyani which I I didn't expected.
May be it was my bad luck, but I will still give a 3.5 rating.

Near Southern Avenue, and you're both hungry and low on budget? Visit Tandoor House. They offer an astonishingly cheap Biriyani Combo Platter. A plate full of Biriyani, a piece of chicken, a potato, an egg, two pieces of Chicken Tikka Kebab, and accompanied with Chicken Chap. All these at just Rs. 100!!! Imagine that! Where else would you get such a combo, while also sitting inside an air conditioned restaurant.

But, note that the taste isn't great. The chicken piece or the biriyani and the chap are quite bland, and greasy, and tough. Only the chicken tikka Kebabs taste good. The rice of the biriyani is okay.¬†

I once had noodles, and again, it didn't taste good.

If you happen to visit the place, do try the Biriyani Combo.

Located on southern avenue, its a small eatery, almost obscure. It's value for money though. I have always had take out from this place. Their biriyani happens to be a hot selling item, since they always run out of it, whenever I've been there. Their chicken wings and roast chicken are pretty good, and very light on the pocket.

Located at southern avenue adjacent to republic of chicken this place is a small restaurant with somewhat old school interior set up.
I have visited this place a lot reminding me of my school life memories. This place is one of the unpredictable restaurants which at times satisfy you with service at times doesn't..

 Food quality is okay compared to cheap prices.  The highlight of this restaurant is its combo meal at a surprisingly low price very much affordable for school goers..

Service is prompt though the staff at times act a bit rude. 
.
It is worth a try if you are planning for a low budget dine in

As the name suggests, Tandoor House, you gonna get the best of Tandoors here. I tried here only once. I had Tandoori Chicken. They made it quite nice. I guess its their speciality dish. Inside decorum is more than average. Full of old school photos. I dont know whats the relation between the food and the decoration. may be thats a very personal choice. Overall, good for one time try :)

A great place to hang out and to have pocket friendly food. I liked the decore very much.. it gives feelings of ancient kolkata. Now about the food? Good quality,and quantity. We ordered roasted chicken which was served with bread toast. Tastes really very good but it was not so hot,that is the main complain. Also ordered mutton combo biryani, & more or less i liked it,though the kababs served with this is not soo tastey. Tutty frutty was good. After the meal i was too much full.. Nice experience. Hope to visit again.

So after lots of planning, our gang finally decided to hit this place. From the exterior, this seems like a regular place but with lots of advertisements of their super affordable rates, including even a framed newspaper cut out of their biriyani combo.. Accommodation is limited and 7 of us had to be split on 2 separate tables.. The main food focus was the Chicken Maharaja combo, accompanied by Biriyani combos.. The meal was delicious, filling, well prepared, with no excess oil running off the plates (happens in a hell lot of moghlai cuisine places) .. Service was quick, formal and well attentive.. The area was clean with the perfect temperature adjustments.. And the rates were super super cheap.. 
All in all, the perfect place to hog on moghal cuisine at the most affordable rates you can imagine..  A must hit for college or buddy gangs if you are looking for a sasta and tikao place to eat..

With hunger in our stomachs and a head full of expectations, my friend and I visited this small little place, situated in the lush green Southern Avenue. It was 3 pm, lunch time for late-eating Kolkatans like us.¬†
The place is really tiny, albeit it has a good decor which includes posters and paintings of icons, beautiful dim-yet-bright lamps. There are three tables on the ground floor and a lot more on the upper storey.
Climbing upstairs, we decided to gorge on the cheapest platter of biriyani combo, but to much of our disappointment the waiter replied that the dish was no longer available for the day. It was unexpected, not to have the desired lunch meal during lunch hours. Moving on from that, we settled for chelo kebab and my friend had a simple non-veg thali.¬†
The dish arrived after 20 long minutes, COLD. The AC was on, just like most other restaurants, but I don't think that was the "correct excuse" for bringing us cold food. ¬†
This was my first experience of chelo kebab and I don't wish to taste it ever again! The buttery rice was bland, the kebabs were horribly dry, leave alone cold.¬†
My friend's non-veg thali was bland as well. The naan was crispy, more than soft. The pulao SUCKED. I mean who likes dry rice with some dry fruits in it, that too cold and tasteless rice? The only good thing was the chicken curry, which was moist and tender (thank God!)
Hoping to never come back to this place, and also hoping I would never taste the bland and infamous 'chelo kebab' ever again anywhere, I seriously wish that they shut down soon.
It was a HO-O-O-RRIBLE experience, although cheap, exactly like their quality of food.

This was one of those places that I frequented with my college mates, when I was broke and still had the audacity to eat out- only because this place was where you could get a "chello" kebab platter for 150 bucks.¬†

This, originally the Iranian national dish, has many flaws here 
1. The rice is undercooked. Always. And too much, compared to the proportion of meat, veggies and the egg and the butter.¬†
2. The tandoor chicken pieces are also undercooked, hard and leave you with the feeling of leather in you mouth. And it's bland.¬†
3. The kebabs, which were originally called soltani, meaning 'for the sultan' are cold, textured in a thread like manner that leave a terrible after taste.¬†

They don't go wrong with the poached egg and do not forget the tomatoes. And most importantly, the butter. Lots of it.¬†

You can give them some points for their biriyani, which is okay but you really have to be lucky to get a good piece of meat with that. The Chinese is average and very oily.¬†

But hey, you don't care about all that when you're in college right?

Been to this place quite a few number of times because of its proximity to my house. It has two floors...the upper one is quite small and also the height of the upper floor is a bit less and for a tall person like me its quite difficult to move around. However,it has a nice and cosy feeling to it. The food here is decent enough and there are a lot of varieties on the menu ranging from chinese to north indian. The prices are manageable and if you are runnig short on money at any point of time, yet want a decent and wholesome lunch/dinner then this is the place to be..overall good value for money.

This place is infamous for the biryani combo meal it serves. I mean mutton/chicken biryani with two pieces of kebabs and chicken chap,all at a price of 130/100 is nothing less of a steal. Influenced heavily by my perpetually broke foodie peers I went to explore the place and no,I did not like it much.Place is too small,service is okay,food can be much better. Overall decent but ample scope for improvement.

Tandoor house had been my happy hang out place during the days my maid bunked...I relished this place during my southern avenue days...I used to stay at Lake avenue for long 8 years and in these years I have visited this place quite a few times. This is the cheapest place to lunch or dine at. Food quality is above average...the place is tiny but with good aesthetics...usually college goers swarm this place in the afternoon...place for 2 hearts to sit and chat and discuss all the issues over the world...
There are meals and also ala carte...you would be hardpressed to cross the billing amount of 1000 bucks (for 2people)...

This one is a really economic deal for the foodies! The best part about this place is the many number of combos available here, though sometimes the quantity is of concern with some! Its a very small restaurant very near to rashbehari mor with very little space inside so the ambience gets affected! But that is made up for with the cheap menu, standard food and neat arrangements!  They have a good array of dishes and also they can boast of many combos ranging from chinese to continental!  Specifically I can tell that the chello kabab platter is a mouthful, though the gullotti kababs were far below standard. The biryani combo with one plate biryani and a chaap (chicken or mutton) is tasty but again the quantity sometimes seems just not enough! The butter nun and mushroom paneer was indeed very well cooked. Overall its a nice place specially recommended for students with a tight budget and a number of mouths to treat!

Having visited Tandoor House on numerous occassions, I felt the need to put in a review which was long overdue. The restaurant or Southern Cabin as they call themselves is located on Southern Avenue near Southern Avenue Swimming Club and is a relatively small but comfortable place to enjoy Chinese and Indian cuisine at very economical rates. However, what stands out are their combo dishes like the Biriyani Combo which consists of a plate of chicken or mutton biriyani, a side dish which is usually chicken chaanp and two pieces of kabab - all this at Rs 100. This is quite unbelievable and they have definitely not compromised on the quality of any of the dishes. They serve a few continental dishes as well, like Roast Chicken, Chicken Steak/Sizzler and Chelo kababs which are above average and worth the effort. Overall they are a commendable restaurant, serving above average food at very competitive prices. I would never hesitate to take away food from Tandoor House and it is a good respite from some of the hyped restaurants that fail to deliver, consistently.

This small joint on Southern Avenue is a good alternative option if you are low on your pocket. They have tried their best to make the ambience classy with dim lights and the likes. The food here is absolute value for money. The combo meals comprise of biriyani and kebabs and then there is the chinese combo too. They come for only 100/120 Rs and the proportion is huge. It will fill you up till your neck. Don't expect top notch food here, but it aint bad either!
Service is okay. Drop in if you are in the neighbourhood and short on cash!

It's a small place in southern avenue just beside republic of chicken. Moderately nice decor with Bengali film poster n all but the most attractive thing about this place is they offer a biriyani combo meal (chicken/mutton) @ only ‚Çπ100/120. It's a really nice deal except they use a large quantities of zafran in their Biriyani. Also tried steak with bread. That's not up to the mark.

Went there today, for a quick lunch, which would be cheap.. Had their much talked about Chicken Biriyani Combo, Cello Kebab Platter and Sizzler with Bread and Butter..The biriyani was okay, had too much scent for my liking, which I though was artificial.. The alu and chicken piece was good though.. The Kebab was really very good, and well cooked.. The chicken chaap disappointed me once again.. The quantity of biriyani and chaap, combined is just enough for one person..The Cello Kebab platter came with rice and butter, and is very dry, be careful.. The keabas were good enough, but the overall dish was not that great..The sizzler was undoubtedly the best amoing them, good proportions, had lots of veggies, well cooked, a healthy chunk of meat and eggs.. The bread and butter could have been better, but I enjoyed it..Overall, this is a nice place if you are low on money and still want to hangout with friends.

One of my friend suggested this place for our hangout. I quite new to this place was not sure of the food quality. The confidence of my friend led me to this place. The restaurant looks quite small though, the interior is quite nice. The food too was amazing. We ordered chicken biryani combo and chicken tandoori kebab. I ate quite a few places, but the food here left me spellbound and I had to give credit to my friend. Chilly prawn was quite good , though I had just 2 pieces. The paintings hanging on the wall was good and gave an idea of Kolkata back in olden days. So our hangout ended with a number of selfies in the awesome place.The food is pocket friendly as well as tastes good. The waiters were quite good and we were overwhelmed by their hospitality. Overall it is a highly recommended hangout place, which serves good food and leaves one with great satisfaction.

I never knew this restaurant before one of my friends took me there.. At around 8.30 at night we ; a group of 20 friends were searching for a restaurant.. The hang out was planned just 15 mins before.. So we had no booking.. No restaurants could accommodate 20 odd persons at that time.. At last we got booking in tandoor park.. From outside it looks a very small one.. But when we got our entry we realised it is not so small.. Interior decoration is really good.... Reminds of Kolkata of 60s:, 70s, 80s... Standard of food is good.. We tried the kebeb platter and biriyani combo... Both were good... We had some snacks too fish tikka and tandoori chicken.. They were more or less good... The best thing about this restaurant is that it is so cheap.. I couldn't find this quality of food in such a low price in any other place of Kolkata.. I wish to visit it again...

No offense but it kind of looks like a very seedy restaurant where someone would visit for illegal smuggling. Very small and the upper part is a little scary. It is impossible to see the person sitting right opposite to you. But anyways, the food is oh so good and so darn cheap. The biriyani combo or the Chinese combo that you order has more than you can expect. And you can have a very hearty meal in just 100 bucks.

Definitely an average place. Prices are really not justified compared to the quality served... Long ago had their chicken biryani and found it to be ordinary compared to Kolkata standards. there is lot of scope for improvement. service is good enough. Havent tried their Chinese so cant comment on that.

The thing about an unknown locality is everything's a hit & trial. 
But, Zomato.
Hence, we knew this was a safe option considering other reviews I saw. 
The size & the pricing of this restaurant is very similar. Both small.
 We had Chinese Non-Veg platter & Indian Veg Platter. And boy, we were so full. With variety of choices in each, every item was well cooked, the chicken was tender, chowmein well cooked, soft bread (naan), big paneer chunks etc. 
This place is a feast to the stomach & pocket.

I never knew about this place till a friend took me there a few months back...  People flock to this place for decent very economically proceed food.... The combo meals and the Thalia are good options.. And I will also recommend the chicken wings.... I have never tried the Chinese so I cannot say how it is. 

The place is for economical rating... And not for fine dining...

been here a few times to try out each of their combo meals. the biriyani and Indian thali combos a quite nice. but the Chinese combo is very bland with the chicken having the the thickest coating ever.. they also serve decent sizzlers and roast chicken. overall its a cool option as its not heavy on the pocket.

Last week of friday went to this restaurant..from outside it looks like small but from inside it's not small.separated in two parts..you can sit either in ground floor or 1st floor.it's upto you but I choose ground floor.in ground floor 1 table with four chairs n other two one side sofa n other side chairs.next time I'll definetly try the 1st floor.
=======================================
1..They have lots of good items from kabab to main course..n they have some combo meals too..either you can go with chelo kabab platter or biriyani combo  or sizzlers combo.

2.service quick n most of the items available.

3.interior pictures hanging from the wall quite old n remind you old bengali times.

4.food quantity good..

5.it's a pocket friendly restaurant.

I had their chelo kabab platter..which is good.kababs very good in taste n soft and the vegetables too.everything perfect n cooked very well.i love to visit again n will try biriyani combo.

Hi all, it was a great surprise for us. 26th February, 2015 i came here with my girlfriend for her birthday treat. we both love Biryani , so we were looking for biryani in the menu card, and we were shocked. We went to many restaurants, but that type of combo offer we had never seen. 
One full plate Biryani (chicken/Mutton) with 2pcs reshmi kebab, 1 pc chicken chaap, 1 pc boiled egg only for 100/120 rs. 
There were other combo meals too, like Veg n Non-veg Thali, Chello Kebab Platter, Chicken Roast etc. for amazing prices. Food quality was very good. Superb ambience with pleasant music along with tasty food makes the place very apealing. 
I definitely believe that other items will be as good as Biryani. We dont get time to come frequently for work pressure but i am sure i will definitely love to come again and again. 
Address:- Tollygunge thana ( Rashbehari), go to the opposite way i.e. Southern Avenue, walk along right¬† side for just 5 mins. This is the shortest way to find out. Opposite of Nava Nalanda School.

I have heard a lot about Tandoor House and finally today we thought of giving it a try! Without much difficulty (thanks to google maps!) we found it out after getting down at Kalighat metro station..
Ambience: 2.5/5 okay sorts. We sat downstairs as there was loud music being played upstairs(which I hate). Some paintings and a nice cup shaped clock adorn the wall. They have books high on a rack fixed to the wall. I kept thinking how someone ever reaches that place..
Food: 3/5 We ordered the Chicken Biryani combo. The biryani served to us was hot and quite good an amount for one. The chicken in the biryani was nice too. The two small pieces of chicken tikka masala tasted good too. But the chicken chap was a disappointment. It was too plain amd watery. Still at 100 bucks(without VAT), a plate full of biryani with chicken is worth giving the shortcomings a miss! And don't go for the quality, you don't expect A1 quality biryani from them, do you?
Service: 0/5 There is a 'mukhbaeka' old waiter who attends everyone who sit downstairs. We gave our order as soon as we entered to him, but he seemed to turn deaf ears to it. And after 10-15 mins, when we asked for it, after that he gave the order to the cook inside. But wait, the zero they got in service is their hard-earned one! After we had finished eating, what did he give us? Guess guess! A single finger bowl for 2 ppl!!! And what did he ask after that as I gave him a mean look.."Should I give one more?" Do I need to say anything else? Tandoor House.. please! Teach your waiters to be sensible!
All in all, I don't think I will give this restaurant another try. Even if I do, I will get the food packed and taken away or maybe sit upstairs. No more 'mukhbaeka' waiters please!

Update:Jan'16
Sat upstairs,can get a bit claustrophobic.
We tried the chinese combo:very bad,not recommended. Taste of everything  from chowmein to chilli chicken is very bland.
They have added a new Chicken Polao combo to their kitty! Tasted quite good. 2 chicken dishes(2 pieces of chicken each),2 chicken lasuni kabab and chicken-loaded-polao‚ô• give it a try!

My friends suggested this place to try out located in an excellent place. The ambiance was pretty good , now coming to the food , we tried the chicken biriyani combo, chinese combo. They were pretty good considering the price, biriyani combo contained 2 tikka kebabs, 1 chicken chap and a full plate biriyani. Quality is compromised here but the quantity and the price nullifies it.
Verdict- Pocket friendly combos makes this restaurant a must visit.

Have only tried out the biriyani combo (chicken/mutton biriyani+chicken chaap+chicken kebab 2pcs) priced at 100 bucks for chicken and 120 bucks for mutton biriyani. There are sizzlers, chinese combos, indian combos, chelo kebabs too. This place is a must visit for people on a budget.

One afternoon when you're damn hungry and you come across a cheap (Biriyani) combo, you just bunk whatever you were doing and just land up in this awe-wait-for-it-some place.Directions: This is a little tricky. Walk towards Tollygunge from Rashbehari Metro Station and take the wide lane on you left that ends up in Sarobar. (Hope this makes sense)My Order: Biriyani Combo (obviously) that included a plate full of Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Kabab and Chicken Chap.Pocket Pinch: Hold your breath. Yes. 100 INR. Just.Pros: 1. Biriyani. Biriyani. Biriyani.¬†2. Chicken. Chicken. Chicken.3. Kabab. Kabab. Kabab.4. And, they all taste awesome.¬†5. Cheap. You don't have to shell out a large amount to have a full meal.Cons:¬†1. This place remains crowded. SO, you have to wait up a little before you can get a seat.2. The first floor seating arrangement is a little shabby but, thumbs up for the ambience.P.S. : Was too hungry to take pictures. Burp!

Such is my addiction to the chicken combo they serve.... i even gave a thought of making this my wedding menu????
Chicken/mutton biriyani neatly surounded by two succulent pieces of kabab.... and onion lemon salsa..... and a chunk of chicken sitting pretty in the lipsmacking gravy of chicken chap..... #simple satisfaction ?
and did i say that all dis comes at a 100bucks bill#ting!!! 
ok now their chicken maharaja is a steal deal at 200bucks served with yellow rice and yoghurt?
decorated beautifully with sliced eggs and cherries.... tastes best with your love by ur side.... so you get the maharani feeling?
The chicken sizzlers  at 180bucks served sizzling hot with bread n butter is a delicious experience ?
The chicken wings were cheap tasty bt a bit too much usage of food colour. 

?Pooja verdict - i guess its something all the students should try.... coz we feel the pocket crunch nd huger the most????

Yesterday I had the opportunity to dine with my friends at the tandoor house.From where I reside i.e. sealdah the place is quite distant and took quite a hassle to reach there.But the food was really worth everything. The butter rice was too delicious and the kababs were quite tasty.But the real hero of the day was the price of the thali which was a meagre Rs 150 and literally made our jaw drop. At last ,we have discovered a restaurant I Kolkata that is really really affordable. For people looking to gorge on many dishes for a minimal price recommendation is .......of course, tandoor house

My go-to place. Tandoor house has an old world charm that will appeal to most people dining there. 
Some may even find similarities in the decor with restaurants such as Mocambo and Peter Cat (read the low hung lights over the tables). 
Pleasant music and good food is what makes this place appealing. 
Even more attractive are the prices. 
Quality and taste of the food is out of this world. 
Personal favourites are the Roast Chicken and Maharaja Chicken. Other items are equally good. 
It's a little cramped upstairs but overall its a pleasant dining experience for people who don't want to burn a hole in their pockets. 
I definitely recommend it.

I had been looking for a budget friendly place to give a grand treat on the eve of my birthday & due to that this place popped up in front of me. Although I found this great place a tad late to my liking but "Der aye Durust Aye" :3.

So since then I have visited this place twice & i wasn't dissappointed at all ^_^.. It's situated near to the nava nalanda high school. In both of my trips I have had their:-

Sizzler with rice= 4/5
Chinese Combo=(3.5/5)
Chicken Wings(3.5/5)

Long story short --> A great & budget friendly place without compromising it's quality & you would surely want to visit this place again :)

Located in the synonymous residential area of southern avenue, this acclaimed restaurant is a few meters away from "Navanalanda school". It is a medium sized restaurant with multi floored sitting arrangement. The interiors are a bit on the shabbier side but still its quite soothing. It has been in business for quite a while and most of the times it stays packed by its loyal customers. Along with dine in services they receive take away orders in huge volume as well. Now coming to their offerings, as the name "tandoor house" suggests- it offers a wide variety of succumbing kababs, tikkas, tandoori, roasts, chello kababs etc; north Indian delicacies like pulao, naan, kulcha, reshmi masala, kadai chicken, mutton kasha; mughlai mights like-biriyani, chaaps etc; are also damn sumptuous. They also serve decent Chinese cuisines, but once you would gulp down their north Indian dishes, it will leave you craving for more. Though sometimes their reluctant serving style could hinder your experience but after considering their mouth watering preparations and its availability at rock bottom prices completely makes up for such minor flaws. Even after offering dishes at unbelievably cheap prices(Chicken tandoori{full}-Rs170; Chello kabab platter-Rs150;) the quality stays completely  uncompromised. 
Really "Tandoor House" is undoubtedly among one of those handful of restaurants which runs their business not for just profit maximizing motive but to satisfy our taste buds.

Same happened yesterday as I was passing through this place I just stepped in and was welcomed with an attractive ambience which I never expected out of this small place.
Biryani is always to crave for but we thought of having the chelo kebab. They were quick with their service and we were quicker in emptying the plates. :) 
I'll visit this place soon to try their biryani and the chicken roast.

It was a friend's birthday and we decided to come to this place for a treat after noticing the amazing combo meals they offer. The place is right opposite the swimming club in Southern Avenue, near my old school, Nava Nalanda. The decor is pretty eyecatching with a lot of pop arts and posters. Even though it is a tiny restaurant, they utilized the space quite well. One thing that I found a little odd was a bookshelf, nailed to the wall at such a height where noone can touch it without any support, filled with books. Why build a bookshelf if noone can read the books?
Anyway, we were a party of ten, and we settled down in the ground floor. We ordered 7 Chicken Biriyani combos, 2 Mutton Biriyani combos, 1 Mixed Fried Rice and 1 Garlic Chicken. The combos are amazing value for money! It comes with one plate of biriyani with an aloo and an egg, Chicken Chaap and two pieces of Chicken Tikka Kebab. The quantity is enough for one person. To be honest, I did not expect much tastewise, but the food was surprisingly good, if not something exceptional. And every plate came at just a hundred bucks. The Mutton Biriyani combo was just 120. Noticing that the name of the restaurant was so Mughlai-like, I was quite sure the Chinese wouldn't be that good. But the Garlic Chicken is really worth mentioning. The chicken pieces were quite succulent and the gravy had just the right amount of garlic.
Will definitely visit this place again just to try more of their combo meals.

I visited this place after reading a couple of reviews on zomato, which were more than specific as to the assesment of this joint, on a pleasant winter afternoon we decided to have lunch here and embarked on a journey to it, after a bit of losing the way , we arrived here , situated in southern avenue near the swimming pool.

We went inside and made our way upstairs,the ambience was akin to peter cat as they had tried to imbibe certain traits , we took our seats, the menu consisted of indian and chinese, but i had in mind the biryani combo and ordered HALF TANDOORI, CHK BRYANI COMBO , MUTTN BRYNI COMBO ,RESHMI BUTTER MASALA HALF, sounds okay for 2 foodies, well what followed was unexpected. The food came soon , servers were very polite chicken tandoori was a handful, juicy , huge pieces of succulent meat, the combos r mind blowing 2 pieces kebab, 1 piece biryani, 1piece kosha("yes that is right"). The bryni was a bit cold , perhaps coz we took too much time to finsh the tandoori, food was delicious, kebabs tender, mutton fresh, gravy light and creamy, the sheer magnitude of the food is a treat to the eyes. The decor is funky and a mix of TWILIGHT meets RD BURMAN. The food is very economical as the bill came fr just 458 bucks for the order. They serve a sizzler which looks delectable, must visit with friends and family alike.

My first visit. Me and my friend wanted to have a meal sumwhr and we decided go to Tandoor House after checking the reviews in zomato. But the moment i entered the place i thought that i made a mistake and i should gv this place a 3. We both ordered Chicken Biryani combo and planned to order chicken sizzler afterwards. When the biryani arrived, we were a bit puzzled coz in a 100rs plate u r getting Chckn biryani, 2 kebabs, 1 potato, 1 boiled egg and 1 extra chicken curry.. The quantity as i described was too much and the quality was good.. The only thing that we didnt like is that it wasn't served hot. Still it tasted yumm as it wasn't that cold either. After finishing, we refused to order anything else because we were full and pleased. :-)
.................................................

One of my friends wanted to visit this place and I accompanied with hesitating :3 again the same dish I had. This time they served the food the way it is supposed to be. Hot! Amazing food again and this time I'll give full marks (Y)
.................................................

My third visit. I wasn't in a mood to eat biryani again in this burning summer so me and my friend agreed to order tandoori chicken and we were again pleased with Tandoor House. It was just like any other normal tandoori chicken, nothing special but we got it for 180, quantity was@ good enough. Visiting again soon. ;)

Hats off to this place for serving such good food and providing nice ambience at such a low price. There combos are a great and surprisingly provide a good quantity and quality both. Biriyani combo and the chinese platter are a must try. The chelo kebab is not up to the mark but what can one xpct in 150rs. Chicken wings at 60 is unimaginable.

CHICKEN COMBOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Dis is wat we all end up ordering everytym once we try it!!isnt it???
Well it is certainly worth it!!!at just 100bucks!!!
We are ardent lovers of this place....this is the only place dat is pocket friendly. Serves good food.is to some extent apt for a romantic date with ur loved one...
We have tried their chicken maharaja....it was awesomely served with sliced up egg .curd.nd yellow rice.fingerlicking goodness!!!
Their chicken wings were good....but may be they used too much red food colour... It stayed on my fingers till d next day!!!!!
We also tried their chicken sizzler...it was served with bread n butter...more awesomeness!!
But their chinese combos are not upto the mark..
D staff is very well behaved...
Do visit this joint....u won't be disappointed. :)

One of the best budget restaurants of South Kolkata, this place serves quality food,while the ambience and service is really good. I went here with my fiancee for a quick lunch and we had Pan fried Chicken, Chicken fried rice, Munchurian chicken,green salad, cold drinks and fruit salad with ice cream all for only Rs.548 including VAT. I have been here many times and also recommend the Thalis.. A must visit for Foodies..

A very budget friendly place. Easy to reach from Rashbehari Avenue or Southern Avenue. The bestsellers of this eatery happens to be the Biriyani Combos, even the other combos like the Chinese one. Most people who turn out here opt for these, due to obvious reasons. Its cheap and quite tasty.The ambiance isn't bad, however the place is little cramped. Small place, not too many to seat. To put it very impolitely, fat people may find difficulty in climbing the stairs. Also, the tables which seat three, isn't spacious enough for three, specially while eating.Best visiting with your special one.They serve the food well though, strangely North Indian food on banana leaves.Worth a visit.

the best place to think of if you want loads of tasty food for less money... the menu first seemed unbelievable so thought of trying it. the ambiance is actually good. the food is awesome, considering that it costs unbelievably low... its a great place to hang out and enjoy with friends.
do try the biriyani platter (if it is available coz it gets over mostly by evening) which includes biriyani with the oh-so-necessary aloo and yes, an egg along with two kebab pieces and chicken chap, all for 115 bucks including tax!!! the maharaja platter will actually make you feel like a maharaja with the enormous amount of chicken, a little biriyani rice and raita! the roast chicken is tasty too. but i did not like the chello kabab platter here. the chello ¬†kababs were inedible. the reshmi kebab was good though.
surely visit this place if you are near Ravindra Sarovar lake or Southern Avenue Swimming Club..

Close to the Nava Nalanda School and the Southern Avenue Swimming Club, this eatery is surely a good one. Gave a visit today with my friend. Its a medium sized eatery with two floors of sitting space. The place is clean and fine decor.¬†

As for the food, we ordered two chicken biriyani combos and one chicken reshmi kebab. The kebab was okayish, The combo earned mixed feelings. The biriyani itself was just okayish but the tikka kebab and the chicken chap that is included in the combo is quite good.¬†

Portions are okay. Service is good. And the prices are too cheap. Just INR 100 for 1 combo biriyani(chicken). Surely will visit more often :)

It was my second visit to this place. I love the decor of this place. The walls are adorned with different kinds of frames starting from edward cullen to gupi gayen bhaga bayen posters. Well, coming to the food part. We had ordered two combo meals- chicken biryani and polao. The combo meals won't put pressure on your wallet but might on your taste buds. Chicken biryani was okayish with tiny tasty kebabs but the chicken chap served with it seemed undercooked whereas the chicken pulao platter was much better.
On my first visit i had the main dishes which was really good. So, order anything but not the combo meals. The prices are affordable.

well was there a few days ago in the evening around 7 pm, heard a lot about the food, but seemed that I was a bit out of luck, as their famed Biriyani combo what seemed to me had stale chicken pieces, chaap and the kebabs were good, biriyani rice was a bit undercooked, was actually very disappointed with the chicken pieces in the biriyani... seemed that the food was microwaved and warmed. I had the chello kebab platter in there, The quantity was good, albeit the kebabs had a lot of binder and the taste of the binder was actually coming through, I guess there was more binder than minced meat. Last but not the least ppl might argue that is what you get for the price that they charge, I guess if they raise the price a little more and concentrate on a revamp of quality no one would mind, however price cannot be an issue to be served stale chicken pieces .... rite !!!

I was a little bit anxious at first about the quality of food they serve after hearing about the prices, but was pleasantly amazed by the meal they served us. Our order consisted of a tandoori chicken and biriyani combo(chicken) and fresh lime soda. The tandoori was nice, biriyani was also quite nice and the tikka kebab that was served with the biriyani was good in taste, although i have tasted better chicken chap than that but then again for rs. 100 you can not complain only because of the sheer quantity of the food. Although the sitting area is a bit cramped but the interior decor and ambiance was very pleasing also. 
Would recommend this place if you are looking for a quick bite with friends or have to treat a large mass for some occasion!! :D
Will definitely visit again and again :D

Ambience is ok, a small decorated and tidy place. Coming to the food, they serve good dishes at a low cost. Their combo dishes are big hits. Chicken biriyani, 2 pcs chicken kebabs, chicken chap and salad... Can you guess its price??? Well you wont imagine it... Its for only 100 bucks... Its just an example... More combos are there... So next time you are there, dont miss it!!!!

I went on Navami and the place was jam-packed. People were sitting outside and waiting for the insiders to come out.

We just ordered Peas Pulav and Paneer Butter Masala for takeaway. And the delivery was quite swift.

Since it was late, the Pulav was giving off a musty sort of smell and was a bit clammy. The long-grained rice wasn't helpful either. The paneer should have been fried a lot more. I'm a huge paneer fan and even I felt that the chunks were kind of raw. The size was good and so was the gravy.

3 boxes of Pulav and 2 of Paneer cost us 550.

I really don't think that Puja is a good time to rate a restaurant, but this was the first time I physically went there, while till 2008 my memories consisted of the aromatic Biriyani brought home by my aunt.

Deducting 1 point completely of the space problem. We had to wait in line for half an hour because of the rush at peak hours on a day of Durga Puja. Still I must say, the behavior of the security person as well as the waiters were very polite and the service was prompt considering pressure of managing that huge crowd.

A small cozy place that brings back fond memories of its old name and menu ------ many people of the area grew up with Southern Cabin as it was then known as,¬† and its most famous item - the Mughlai Paratha. The place brings back nostalgia in true sense of the term.......
¬†
The Tandoor House is housed in the same place albeit in a new look and an all new menu - enjoyed "Chello Kebab" which has been immortalized by Peter Cat at a very affordable price and tried a few other items and liked all. A nice place to try any day, even for brief working day lunch pack which too is available at a very pocket friendly rate...... recommended......

Nice and cosy place to eat out with friends . Their combo meals offer a wide range if combinations at a pocket friendly price . Their Biryani is average and Tandoori Chicken us just about good . If your sitting right next to the A.C. on the upper floor, chances are that your food will get cold before you've finished chatting with friends or family! So try sitting away from the machine. Their service is good.

Two main reasons for me to be here is the ambience and second is the price. ¬†We always opt for the pocket friendly thalis :D . The taste is okay but provided the quantity they give it can be excused. Tandoor house needs to be walked to, to reach.. otherwise.. its a great place for a low budget eat out

I had visited this place numerous times, since 2012.Last week I visit there and found them, still serving tasty food at very affordable prices. Whenever I come here I never went for their combo offers. The service is slow but the staffs are polite. This is an ideal place for coming with a group of friends and enjoy foods. So to sum up I would like to say it's a place where we can visit more than once and the best part is that pocket pinch is almost nothing compared to the quality & quantity of the food.

The entrance n the decor is nicely done... Comfortable seating but not quite spacious... On the first floor they have quite a dark combination of lights n it will be great if they use proper air conditioning instead of using fans... As the fan was very much close to my head... sometimes i felt that the food may get blown off.... Coming to the food, since i was very hungry n my friend too so we ordered one Mutton Biriyani Combo for me..n one Non-Veg Indian Thali for my friend.... The food came quickly n we started eating.... Biriyani was okayish but the quality of mutton could have been much better... because for a minute i thought m i really mutton or some other flesh... It was served with an egg n a potato..accompanied by Chicken Chap n Chicken Tikka Kebab...Chap was nothing more than a flat Chicken Curry...Kebab was good.... now coming to the Thali... Butter Nan had very less amount of butter which was difficult to find... Veg Polao was so so... Dal Makhani was delicious... Reshmi kebab was also good... Masala Salad was fresh but Chicken Tikka Masala was a big NOOO..... I dunno d same kebab which was served to me was good but when it got mixed with some gravy n served to my friend, it was nothing more than a big blunder.... Definitely its a pocket friendly restro but one can never compromise with the quality.....

Have been here for a number of times. The location of this restro is good, it is located in Southern Avenue just opposite to the Nava Nalanda School. Decor is pretty good and its a pretty well maintained eatery. They have two floors of average area, most of the time we have food on the first floor whose ambiance is quite soothing as it has got a pretty nice light and dark combination. But the area is a bit less spacious and you will occasionally feel suffocating if one of the ACs is not working. Food here is quite good and the quantity is not bad considering the price. The quality of food is average. They have great combo offers - on both Chinese and Tandoor cuisines. The Tandoor one includes 1 portion of chicken/mutton biriyani, two chicken kebabs and one 1 platter of chicken/mutton chaap. The whole thing costs only 100 bucks - yes, it's just 100 rupees and you will get everything which I just mentioned. I even tried their Chinese combo which I feel is not that good as compared to the Tandoor one. If you go for chicken wings in the starters and some desserts or ice-creams there you will again be not disappointed, again it's not that great but in the price which they are proving the items in the menu is worth praising. The staffs there are courteous enough though sometime your food may take longer time to reach.

SO, TO SUM UP -

LOCATION - 3.5/5¬†
FOOD QUALITY - 3/5 , QUANTITY - 3/5
HOSPITALITY - 3/5
DECOR AND AMBIANCE - 3/5
HYGIENE - 2.5/5

Location: Southern Avenue. 

This is more like a small joint located a few minutes away from the Southern Avenue Swimming Club. 
Being just around a minute walk away from my residence, this place was on my list, plus this place served sizzlers (one of my weak points), thus had to be visited. 
On visiting found out that it just had one sizzler for the vegetarians! :( 

Nevertheless, gave it a try. I had ordered noodles as a side, the whole thing tasted good, the veggies were fresh and juicy, the noodles was perfectly boiled. 

Another thing that I noticed was it also had a limited number of options under the North Indian cuisine as well as Chinese cuisine for the Vegetarians. 

This place can be visited when a budget constraint dawns over the wallet! 
Good quality food at reasonable prices. 

The staff needs to buckle up, are quite laid back and thus the service lacks promptness. 

Overall an above average experience. 
-Would revisit soon to try out the North Indian and Chinese fare.

Good FOOD with worst Service, 
after few minute you will feel that servers are not happy with your presence, they are really arrogant, impolite and worst server I have ever seen in my life. 
You have to eat food within half an hour or they will shout on you to leave the table, ever most of them are vacant.
Management should look into this, otherwise food is really good and pocket-friendly....

Recently visited here. The place is no so much specious or decorative, but the ambiance is good. Light & dark combination is fine for couple dine out. Food is good in taste and definitely pocket friendly. You have to wait a little bit more if you go for Sizzler. Otherwise service is fine. If you go for lunch/dinner, & the condition of your pocket is not good, then you should go for Biriyani Combo, which is very much in budget.

The entrance of the restaurant is fascinating and gives you a good feeling (You can check the pictures)...
 Let me tell you the inside story....

You should not expect a decorative interior or a spacious sitting area.... The interior and sitting is average and one can sit comfortably.... In the menu, the Chelo kabab platter and the Sizzlers are worth waiting!
WAITING??? yes! the servers are too busy with work and aren't pleased with your presence.... so u don't expect a fast service or a quick assistance... 

Since, i have visited this place for lunch, i realized that many office goers come down to have their lunch..... The prices are moderate as compared to other restaurants...

Overall, it is an average restaurant with nothing to be pleased about.. my rating is 3.0..... :-/

Tandoor House is famous for it's Biriyani Combo & frankly speaking we went there to specially have it. It is a place best for quick lunch for school/college students who are on a tight budget. The place is a little congested specially upstairs. 

We took a Mutton Biryani combo & Sizzler with Rice. They are not special in any way & tastes quite ok. It is one of the best items in any restaurant in respect to VFM.

Can't comment about other dishes. Would like to visit the place again as it's quite close to my college & a budget friendly place with nice decor & food.

I love to dine and kebabs are my favorite . This place is just round my house and I visit them quite frequently. The menu here is good and the prices are super affordable. I love the reshmi butter masala,chicken Tikka masala, the ke ab platter. The biryani combos ate awesome and are value for money. One night we ordered a chicken fried rice along with chicken gonna masala and for desserts a cold coffee with ice cream and two scoops of chocolate ice cream and the bill was below 400 with tax. The taste is great here and the service quite nice they serve food quick and are affordable. Of you are looking for a place at the end of the month which will not burn your pocket this is a good bet. .

This Place is one of my friend's favorite, so I end up being there often. Its a small restaurant, having a seating capacity of 30-35 people. If you go upstairs for a seat, you might have a chance to bump your head, so watchout. I like being there because its located near my school. The prices are very much pocket friendly and food is also pretty decent. I usually prefer the Chinese items. Fired Rice, Pan Fried Noodles, Chicken and Prawn Items are good. They offer a few Thalis as well and those are pretty cheap (Although I never had one). Overall Its a good restaurant, worth a visit.

Strictly for the ones on a tight budget. Located on the southern avenue, its about 10 min walk from the kalighat metro. As we entered, we saw that the place is a little cramped with three tables lined up with chairs and wrought iron benches on either side. We chose to dine at the table close to the ac. The waiters served us cold water immediately n brought us the menu card. We were totally taken aback by the combos and their prices. Without anymore dilly-dallying we ordered a few plates of chicken biriyani combo and a non-veg Indian lunch thali. The food came within half an hour. The amount of each item was enough for two each of our group. But that might not be the case for someone with a bit higher appetite. So, I would rather say the food is okay for one person only. I was highly disappointed with the chicken chap that came with the biriyani. This was the worst chicken chap I ever tasted. Everything else was okay given the price. Felt in love with the Chicken Tikka Masala of the Indian Lunch Thali. It was too good. A lunch at any restaurant is never complete without tasting its special items. Hence, we decided to try its specialty- the chicken sizzler. It was just fabulously done with perfect blend of spices, oil, veggies and juicy chicken pieces. We opted for the rice as side and I must say the rice tasted a bit funny. Nothing to worry about. Often uncooked rice stored over a long time give such smell.

This small restaurant, located at the Southern Avenue crossing near Rashbehari Avenue, is one of the best places to visit if you are having a tight budget. The combo meals offered(both Chinese and Tandoor) are served in great quantity and only for the meagre amount of 120 bucks. The look and feel of the restaurant is extremely bohemian with portraits of Bob Marley , Hendrix and the likes all over its entrance and interiors. However it is excessively compact with a very low ceiling. For any one above the height of 5'6", be ready to bow your head. There aren't enough seats if you are visiting this place in large groups either.

Overtly stuffy and compact. Visit only in small groups and if you are having inadequate funds.

I generally order their lunch thali combos. Priced at only 100 bucks, they give good quality food, tastes decent. Portions are more than satisfactory for one person. The Indian Lunch thali comprises one soft nun, veg fried rice, 2 chicken kebabs, 2 chicken preps with 2 pieces chicken in each, salad and a papad. All this for just a measly 100 bucks. 
The Chinese Lunch Thali has  rice/noodles, 2 chicken preps, one mixed vegetable prep and salad. 

Very affordable, home Delivers at short distances and good yum food! :)

This place is in Southern Avenue just next to Kalidhan High School. We went to this restaurant when it was just new in the town and the price we saw outside the restaurant made us visit this! We were not sure about if the quality and quantity of food will be up to the mark, but then we had no idea what was coming!! 
                Tandoor House has two floors, we sat on the 1st floor . This place is dimly lit. The decor was more or less okay. We ordered butter nun, chicken bharta, Chicken Biriyani, Garlic Chicken and Chicken hakka chowmein. The orders were taken sincerely and served very fast. Now, as I have mentioned earlier , looking at the price we have no expectation its the time for us to get surprised! All the items tasted superb and was served with adequate quantity. This is called budget power pack lunch. I just love Tandoor House since then.

We went to have lunch here from Salt lake that too multiple times. That should tell you how much I favour this place.

The pocket pinch is nothing when you see you get chicken biriyani, chicken kabab, chicken chap at a price of 100. However I should warn you, its not that high class biriyani. Its a bit dry in fact. But yeah compared to the value for money I would say its awesome. 

The ambience is good as well considering the beautiful decorations on the walls. 

However they take a long long long time to serve. That is however the only drawback to this place.

Although I visited the place a couple of times, After visiting it on the 29th of march that is yesterday, I must say that the food quality has dropped to a so so quality. I and my girlfriend ordered for a Chello Kabab Platter and a Chicken biriyani combo and after having them. we found that the sheikh kabab in the chello kabab platter was mushy and yes unfortunately very blunt in taste instead of the smoky touch. and in the biriyani combo there was a bit of an issue with the quantity in the chicken chap, but now at the same time one must also keep in mind that the price is also cheap. the ambience is the same as posted by fellow zomato users. My suggestion to the authorities is to look after the quality of the food as I feel that it can be a bit better. Another option which people can try are the prawn dishes specially the Schezwan Prawn that also tastes good.



----- 30 Oct, 2013 -----

Hii, this restaurant is a moderate place to be in ( specially if you are searching for cheap food ). The food is not so much good but okay. The ambiance is a bit clumpsy and public transportation to get here is a problem ( other than a cab ) as it is near the Menoka Cinemas. The service is also fairly prompt. But there is a serious problem regarding the home delivery facility. I will insist people that if you are hungry and least bothered about the ambiance, the transportation, the service then definitely this is the place you should be in but not otherwise.

I was very surprised and pretty impressed by Tandoor House. We were in the mood to eat something light, and in the area, so with zero expectation decided to enter this place. The decor inside is nicely done - old fashioned posters and little knick knacks grace the wall. A book shelf is arranged on the top of the entrance, and its so far up that you can't touch it (which is a peeve - books are meant to be touched in my book). However, once seated we decided on ordering two starters and a cold drink. My friend wanted a Dry Chilli Chicken and a Fish Malai Kabab and a Thums Up. They gave us a liter bottle of water which I must say was perfectly chilled - not icy cold, yet not room temperature... but a comfortable level of it which I liked. 

Our server had warned us that the malai kabab will take time. We were not worried, so he got us the chilli chicken first - it was well-cooked, the meat was very soft with a generous amount of fried onions, garlic, red bell pepper and chillies and seasoned well. While not mind blowing, it was quite good. As we were finishing off the last bits of it, the malai kabab came in with a pudina chutney and a bit of onions. It was a revelation. Soft pieces of very good quality fish, moist and juicy, laden with a bit of creamy cheese and grilled - it hit all the right spots. With a squeeze of lime it was delicious, and although we weren't fans of the chutney that came with it, it was, again, decent. 

Our bill was 355/- for this and a Thums Up.

I had visited this place numerous times, since 2007. Back then it was a little restaurant mostly popular for takeaway and home delivery. Last week I visit there and found them, still serving tasty food at very affordable prices. I ordered Half Chicken Tandoor, Handi Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Thumbs Up. The chicken tandoori was marinated in the right amount of spices before they are cooked; it‚Äôs just awesome for starters. Handi Biryani and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala were very well cooked and really tasty. Whenever I come here I never went for their combo offers. The service is slow but the staffs are polite. This is an ideal place for coming with a group of friends and enjoy foods. So to sum up I would like to say it‚Äôs a place where we can visit more than once and the best part is that pocket pinch is almost nothing compared to the quality & quantity of the food.

Just a common very reasonable restaurant, more suitable for takeways, then dine-in. They do have a small room on the ground floor with a few tables and a cranky staircase leading upto the mezzanine. In my only visit to the place, I didnt risk the staircase and settled for a table at the end of the room. 

We ordered for some safe dishes, where it is a task to actually get it wrong.  Chicken fried rice, chill chicken dry, and a bit of indian veg - navratan korma , naans, dal. Food was just about tolerable, though one can't really expect them to dish out masterpieces at that price. Special mention: Navratan Korma gravy needs to be thicker in consistency, instead of the watery bland dish on offer.

I hate it when run down menu cards are placed on tables. Surely, every fnb outlet is expected to have presentable menu cards. How do I trust your food, if your menu card is such?

Anyway, can't seem to think of anything else worth writing of this place. As I said, take aways only or order ins, if you happen to live in the neighbourhood.

Strictly for the budget conscious.

I ordered home delivery a couple of times. Food is average but some of the Tandoori items are actually good. The quality can vary however. This budget place has an offering called Biriyani combo (priced at 100 for chicken and 120 for mutton) which is an absolute deal. It comes with biriyani containing an egg, a wholesome potato and a sizable leg piece that tastes great; a chicken chap on the side that could have been better and 2 pieces of really well done chicken tikka kebab! The rice in the biriyani suffers in both quantity and  quality but with so much chicken at this price, who is complaining!

I am a regular visitor at this place, the food is very good, they have some combo meals like Chinese Combo, Biriyani Combo etc which are very good at taste and they are very budget friendly. The place is nice and cosy. The place is filled with old pictures and books and music records & the back ground music played by the people their adds a bit more. But the main thing is the Service is very poor, food comes after a lot of time.

Just had dinner 10 minutes back with family at tandoor house. 
LOCATION-Can be easily located on the lake road .1block before nava nalanda/ng nursing home on the opposite foot of road.But a private transport is recommended.
AMBIENCE- Could have been better.But still it is good.Though the restaurant is not too big.
FOOD-This is what matters most. Food is awesome compared to the price. I just cant believe i had one full plate muttton biriyani with combo of chicken chap and two piece of chicken kabab for only Rs 100 (vat extra).
The quality of food is very good,fresh and not too spicy or oily.Quantity of food is satisfactory.1 dish  just sufficient for 1 person only.
PRICING-Very pocket friendly.I dont know in this market how they have kept the pricing so low and the food so good..Anyways..total satisfaction.
We had two Biriyani combo and two chelo kababs. Bill was - 607 only.
Conclusion- Taste bud friendly and pocket friendly at the same time.Hope to visit again. Definitely recommended to everyone !

You can't compare this place with Mainland China or Taj Bengal, The plus point is this they are giving you the best food at the most reasonable price without cheating you like using Brandname.  Food quality is good .

Living near Southern Avenue enables me to walk in here every now and then to grab some tasty food. I have been here for many occasions like birthdays, dinner during puja as well as just a quick bite. Every time I have had a pleasant experience. There are two options of sitting, the ground floor or the first floor. Personally I prefer  the first floor as it's a bit cozy and the lights are romantic. Mostly I have went with him so I prefer the seating upstairs. The waiters usually take orders pretty quick and the orders have never taken more than 15 minutes . The usual orders come quickly though we have had many unpopular dishes too. We love the Biryani combo there. The 100RS platter consists of a plate of Biryani (Mutton/chicken) with a piece of chicken from the biryani an egg and a large piece of potato. With the dish two pieces of kebab and a piece or Chicken in a gravy is provided. It's a great dish for the rice and we have on many occasions had it . The  sizzler there is popular though I've never tasted it . Chicken tikka Masala tastes wonderful teamed with Fried Rice. I've had roti too but I've liked rice and noodles better. the Szechuan rice is great too. The waiters are very attentive and I've loved how they always keep track whther we are feeling uncomfortable or need more water. You know when the service is good, you can feel generous to spend more. They have the option to pay through Cash and cards too(above 300) The Cold Coffee with ice cream is my favorite dessert here. The service, the ambiance and the food is good for the price and one plate of rice/ noodles will easily be good for two.

The food is tasty and no VAT is charged. 2 plates of Biriyani serve 3 people easily. The non veg side dishes are mouth watering. The staff is well behaved, sweet and polite. The only suggestion would be to include dessert in their menu.

Situated at Southern Avenue beside my school (Nava Nalanda),me and my friends have visited this place numerous times.I had first visited this place during pujo some 5-6 years back.Back then it was a small and simple restaurant serving tasty food at very affordable prices.we used to visit this place often and almost every year when we went out together during durga pujo.I have seen it change a lot over the years.Nowadays when we old friends meet up we sometimes visit this place just based on the sentiment we have for the place!
At present,the restaurant has a different,dimly lit ambience with posters of Bob Marley,Jim Morrison dawning the walls.The ambience will catch your attention when you enter the place.There is nice soft music playing in the background.The space is still very little.There are two sections one at the ground floor and one upstairs.Both the sections are very cramped and the height of the ceiling is too low for comfort specially upstairs.The toilet is something that is best avoided.The staff are friendly but the service is quite slow.
Coming to the food,the variety of food on offer in the menu has increased including a few combo meals.The prices are still quite reasonable.But I feel the quality of the food has gone down.I used to love their biryani but the last time I had it,I didnt like it at all.The few other items I had recently were decent specially considering the price.
Overall not a place I can recommend in all honesty,but a place for which I will always have a soft corner!

Seeing their posters of inexpensive food, a few friends and I decided to try out this place. It is quite cramped and the tables are small. The ambience is good with dim red lighting and a few paintings here and there. (There is a painting of Robert Pattinson as well!)
Being low on cash, we ordered the chicken biryani combo and the Chinese combo, each priced at Rs100. The former one consisted of a little biryani (with a piece of chicken, an egg and a chunk of potato), two tiny pieces of chicken tikka and a portion of chicken chap. Overall, it was ordinary. The potato was hard, and the chicken chap was simply tasteless.
I loved the vegetable gravy they gave in the Chinese combo, while the fried rice along with the prawn and chicken gravy were 'okay'.
Service was impressive, but I won't recommend this restaurant unless you are running really low on money.

Was planning to place a bulk order of the biriyani combo meal for our college freshers' program, so my friends and i decided to try it out. The first impression was that its quite cheap and valve for money as they were offering so much( biriyani, an egg, a half aloo, two pieces of kebab and a chicken curry side dish) for just 100 bucks (tax excluded). But when the food arrived and we started eating, we found that the piece of aloo was rock solid , under-cooked and the chicken curry also tasted funny. other than that the biriyani was okayish, but the kebabs were delicious. 
The ambience of this place was really good, a bit cramped at parts, bt they managed to use the little space they had quite efficiently. 
Neway, finally we decided not to place the order in here because undercooked aloo with biriyani tastes really bad. Next time i visit this place, i want to try the chelo kebab platter. (its 150 bucks only!)

I visited Tandoor House, as you can well guess, when my wallet was way too light to permit eating at a nice restaurant. The front was done kind of in a Tim Burton meets boi mela artists style- it was all black with the name flashing in almost fluorescent. Yes, it's odd and yes, I didn't get why there were amateurish water colour portraits of Jim Morrison and Bob Marley on the wall (also painted black) beside the restaurant. But props for trying to be original, although it was over the top.

I actually would not have entered if a short version of the menu was not stuck on the door proclaiming biriyani with kebabs and chap combo at Rs. 100! The first thing we noticed on entering is that the place is too small. There were hardly two proper tables on the ground floor and up we went along the cramped staircase, to the mezzanine which was almost as cramped. While the walls of the ground floor was done in a cheerful green and decorated with movie posters, the mezzanine was painted black and dim-lit too with lamps hanging over the tables.

Coming to the food, we ordered a Biriyani combo and the indian lunch thali. First off, the Biriyani platter had a bit more than half of the amount of Biriyani served at the likes of Arsalan and Zeeshan. On top of that, it smelled too strongly of keora and the rice was not even the long grained ones you usually have in Biriyanis. There were two skimpy pieces of kebab that looked violently red and there was very little char on it. The chicken chap piece was pretty small for the dish that's served in only one piece. The gravy tasted more like onion paste not cooked well enough instead of the proper yoghurt-y chap. On to the Indian lunch thali: the naan was papery and crisp, which is I suppose pardonable because it's Tandoori naan. The kebabs were too blond for my taste, barely any roast at all. The dal makhani had a kind of slimy texture, but the taste was good enough. The tikka butter masala was okay-ish. The vegetable pulao was nothing but plain rice with peas in it. Overall, the verdict on food was strictly average.

The service was good, the prices are tax inclusive, so no unpleasant surprises on the bill. But apart from that, there's nothing that will take me back to Tandoor House unless I go desperately broke again.

I like the cosy ambience there. food are quite good except biriyani n chello kebab platter, they were dry n bland. apart from that, I hv always tried their chicken roast which is really really good n of taste. it comes with breads so the amount is quite adequate for us. as we two never binge into foods dat way... overall it's a nice place, Atleast I like it because of it being pocket friendly n cosy dim ambience with light Arabian/Persian music... I like it. but they should work on their arrangements a little, bit slow.....

Tandoor house- located at southern avenue near the republic of chicken. I visited there a month ago as it looked pretty good from outside. It had dim lighting system. Basically comprises of an upper division and a lower one. The upper one's ceiling height isn't good. Coming to the pros and cons of this place. 

Pros:-
1) situated at a good location
2) lighting is dim 
3) soft music
4) staffs are polite
5) ambience is nice
6) food is delicious - okay types.

Cons:-
1) service is slow
2) food quality not good oily.
3) could improve a lot better

A 3 from me.

I had heard about this place from a friend who was praising their combo biriyani meal! It did sound interesting, so I visited for late lunch! It is located near the Nava Nalanda school, in southern avenue, almost impossible to miss for its bright display sign! They have tried to make the most of the little place, and I guess the decor was meant to be off beat! Nice effort I must say! Though lack of space ruins the ambiance,making it look clumsy! We sat upstairs, and without looking much, ordered for the Biriyani Combo meal! 
Being near brokes, and not very hungry we did not have much to complain about. However if I judge this from a foodie's point of view this place is nothing special. The biriyani was dry, the kababs were okay! I kind of liked the chaap that came with it. Taste-wise nothing good, quantity-wise too it is nothing great! 
But from a broke's point of view it was a sort of a pleasant surprise! The combo meal came for 100/- and it included decent piece chicken chaap, two pieces of kababs,one egg and a portion of chicken/mutton biriyani.
 I am sure the next month's end, when both my stomach and pockets are empty I would go lolling to this place for lunch! :D There are other combos available too. So please visit under the given circumstances :) Have Fun!

location-southern avenue..ambiance- pretty ordinary,in fact below average i would say..then you must guess that why am i reviewing this place..well only because of the food they serve..really tasty..and above all the pricing is simply to budget friendly..i was wondering how do they manage to serve such tasty dishes at such an astronomically low price!!! say for instance chello kebab is just Rs.150/- a plate..can you believe it??wow!!i strongly recommend this food joint to those who are a bit sensitive when it comes to spending,no pun intended...:)

Located in a peaceful area, this is one eatery my family and I visit quite frequently. They also have home delivery option for those living nearby.  We have almost tried everything they have on the menu (north indian, chinese, combo meals, thalis etc.) and have mostly been satisfied. If you are looking for high-end dinning experience, certainly this is not the place. But value for money is what this small restaurant is all about.

Purely Value for money, It really a nice cozy place, not so upmarket hi fi type, but one can enjoy the food both quantity and quality wise and also take parcel from there. Sometime depending on location of the place from where food being ordered, home delivery can also be arranged.
