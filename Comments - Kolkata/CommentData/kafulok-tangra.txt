Update of 01 Jan 2018. Wanted to order dinner, I found the restaurant not available on Swiggy for today. I called and the gentleman who answered said they are normally closed on Mondays. Said he will speak with Swiggy to enable delivery for today, but Swiggy did not help, and he actually called me back to inform me. No one bothers so big brownie points. I went to the restaurant and everyone, from the parking guy to the order-taker to the counter person were polite and friendly. Much more so than most places. It was a very pleasant experience. As far as the food is concerned, the Chopsuey was a tad sweeter than last time, but both the Chicken Fried Rice and the Chilli Chicken were better than other Tangra outlets.

Increasing rating because of today's experience.
----------------------------------------------------

I used to visit this restaurant many years back. I have recently ordered through Swiggy a couple of times. The second time, had a small simple order, of two Non-veg Chopsueys and a small portion of Chicken Sweet corn soup. The soup was not up to the mark. Did not have the fresh feeling I associate with sweet corn soups. I did leave it in its container over an hour before consuming, but I do not believe that was the reason for the not so great experience.

The Chopsuey on the other hand was better than what we have experienced at most other Tangra outlets. While the chicken was lacking in quantity, the noodles were crisp, and the sauce tangy without being over-sweet. A bit more of greens would have been nice.

Packaging was sufficient.

Had ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken, Mongolian chicken, lemon chicken, garlic sweet and sour chicken, mixed fried rice and hakka noodles. The food was okay kind off, nothing great. The quality of chicken was mixed, some hard and chewy and some soft.

A nice place to bring friends and family for some good Chinese food and drinks. There is space for parking outside and they have two floors with spacious seating capacity.

Horrible food. Horrible staff. China Town is no more a place good food. It is only for people who drink. 
The management specifically at Kafulok do not know how to behave with customers.

Went with a group of friends, on a Wednesday afternoon. We were the only customers in the whole place! Really terrible lighting but food, well, you get what you pay for. Good quantity, quality not so good. But it's pretty cheap too! We ordered pepper chicken as starters, then chicken fried rice along with Kung Pao Chicken and Lemon Chicken.
Starter
Pepper chicken: 20 big pieces of spicy chicken, goes well with their soups as well.
Main course
Rice: standard - in both quantity and quality.
Kung Pao: felt like pieces of chicken just tossed in plain hot sauce, also, NO PEANUTS. Though pretty hot, it left a bland after-taste.
Lemon chicken: was very good...something this place is known for! The crunchiness of the chicken will stay with you for a long time!
The staff: courteous
Concerns:
The lighting: very poor! They could really add a bit more of lighting!
The price: the place is pretty cheap for what is ofders. But the problem we had was that we followed them on Zomato and then went in. Zomato shows one menu/price while the restaurant has hiked the prices.
It was not a very big deal but a place like that, they should update their info in places like Zomato. It can be confusing for others!
Overall, not a very bad place but better enjoyed in the evening. Otherwise, as it happened with us, the staff will probably lurk around and give creepy looks! XD

Had my birthday dinner yesterday. It was worth visiting the place! We ordered for chicken drumsticks, chicken meifoon, chicken fried rice, Shezwan chicken, Kung pao chicken and orange juice. Lip smacking dishes indeed! 
Only Shezwan chicken was not up to the mark. It could have been a bit more spicy. Otherwise all other items were very satisfying. Would love to visit again üëç

Kafulok, Tangra, Kolkata: Tangra is a region in east Kolkata that traditionally housed a large number of tanneries owned by people of Hakka Chinese origin. "47 South Tangra Road", may be the most confusing postal address, as it used to cover the whole of Chinatown Tangra with over 350 tanneries. Most of the standing structures have been built, over many years, by the industrious Hakka Chinese, upon marshy and reclaimed low-lying land. Over the past several decades, it has served as the location of Calcutta's Chinatown. This is not a coincidence; the Hakka Chinese of Calcutta have gradually turned this part of the Kolkata into an important destination for sourcing finished and semi-finished leather. The Hakka Chinese specialized in the manufacture of leather and turned it into one of the major industries of West Bengal, providing employment to tens of thousands of local inhabitants.

Food from Tangra is a distinct variety of traditional Hakka Chinese cuisine adapted to Indian ingredients and the Bengali palate. This has spread to the rest of India, along with the recipes earlier unique to Tangra. Tangra is now the most popular destination for Chinese food. Chinese food sold in Tangra restaurants are now known all over the world as 'Hakka Style" Chinese food.

 The success of "Hakka style" Chinese food in the rest of India encouraged a migration of many Chinese families to other cities as the economic fortunes of Tangra decayed. Many landmark Chinese eateries, including Nanking, Waldorf, Peiping and Fat Mama have closed or changed hands and fortunes. The once prosperous Calcutta Chinese community is now clearly in decline. However, a boom in Tangra's unique Indian-Chinese food is attracting a lot of attention these days and the cuisine will probably live on in Kolkata and in the global Indian Diaspora.

Being a bong and visiting Kolkata once or even twice a year will end up eating and hogging the same fare as every mashi ma and pishi  ma will try to out beat each other in their delivery of typical Bangali khana and you end up, like me, NOT EVER visiting tangram that you so much get to hear. This time I made a resolve ‚Äì No more Nemontrono or Lunch/dinner invitation, this visit will be dedicated to sampling superb bong food in restaurants and Chinese in Tangra. Finally years of wait has come to  an end with my visit to Kufolok in Tangra.

Kufolok, owned by Mr Chen is the oldest restaurants in Tangra, Kolkata and this is why I specifically wished to dine out here.

After a deliberate search thru the by lanes of fortified Tangra, we locate the chimese restaurant Kufolok near the Chinese Kali Mandir. Once inside the glass doors you stop getting the acrid smell of Tanneries and your nasal buds are enchanted with the wonderful aroma of soya, stir fry and you can barely stop your mouth from watering.

The d√©cor was Spartan and grey with not a single customer about except us. We were greeted by 2 bong chaps who possibly served as waiter cum manager. Typical scenario of owner not around, either in a business errand, or migrated to Canada or Australia.

We were Hungry and impatient to sample everything and all things Hakka Chinese in the limited time we had in our hands. So we ordered : one plate Steamed Chicken Chinese Wantons at Rs 160/- per plate and the taste was excellent and certainly had an edge over the Mainlands that we are so used to, then we ordered one Fish in black bean sauce at Rs 285/- per plate and this was good too. Then we ordered the Chilli Pork at Rs 350/- per plate which was the best Pork chilli I ever sampled in my life. Gluttony got the better of us and we ordered 2 plates of Meifoon noodles at Rs. 180/- per plate and one Garlic Sweet and Sour Prawns at Rs 725/- per plate, one Chinese greens ( Pok Choi) stir fried at Rs.150/- per plate. The Garlic Sweet and Sour prawns was huge for its size, sweet and fresh and the Garlic sweet n sour sauce excellent , though dry and devoid of much vegetables and the Chinese greens pok choi has a raw, crisp and succulent taste in its stir fried avatar whilst the Meifoon was awesome.

Honestly I have never eaten such an excellent Chinese meal in my life from east coast to the weast.

Absolutely Happy, satisfied and  worried at the same time of the sustenance of the this lively joint. What with such less customers?

 Ambience & Decor: Very Spartan, grey, perhaps a tad bit depressing, clean though not exactly spic and span.

Timings: 12:00 noon till 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm to 11:00 pm

Taste : Excellent , Superb and exotically Chinese- Hakka, atlast!

Variety People & menu: Elaborate but the manager who takes the order hates to Listen and will convince you utter rubbish.

Value for Money: Absolutely Cheap and plentiful.

Service: Good

Verdict: Kolkata citizens please this place visit again and again just to keep it afloat! It would be a pity if it closed!

Now-a-days with so many top notch Chinese, Thai and Oriental place opening up in Kolkata, people hardli visit Tangra. However is you are planning to visit Tangra, I would suggest trying Kafulok for a change rather than the old well known other places.

The food here was quite food and compared to the prices - I would say a complete winner.
The chicken claer soup was one of the best I have tasted and obviously they had added a lot of genuine chicken stock. The gravy noodles was also rather good.¬†
The hakka noodles however was not balance properly and needed more salt.
They serve house special sweet cilli sauce which tasted great!

Visited kafulok after ages and it was a nostalgic trip down memory lane. The huge round tables reminded me of college days when we used to be regulars here. This time it was a school reunion and I was excited both for the food and the Adda. We ordered chilly garlic pepper chicken and fish. The taste was good but I found it very oily. Later we ordered chicken soup which had the typical China Town taste. The crispy noodles along with it enhanced the experience. The meinfoon noodles was very oily and I didn't enjoy it much. The lemon fish was excellent and the chicken gravy was kind of average. The prawn chips were equally oily. The service was good but I feel the food quality has degraded over the years. They need to improve to sustain repeat customers. The pricing is a bit less than a few other restaurants on the vicinity but the food quality really needs a check.

Avoid like plague. Bad food. Worst service. Third rate billing. Noodles tasted as bad as a roadside stall. Fried rice fared marginally better. Sides as normal chilli Chicken or Manchurian tasted as bad as possible with too much sauce be it chilli vinegar or soy. The Kafulok fried spring chicken had no salt and looked liked leftover from another table with broken pieces! Drunk crowd won't care much but we were not drunk , hence. The portion and cut of the meat of the side dish will shock you too. Best avoided.

Went there for an office dinner party. I would say this is located very deep inside and was pretty isolated. Inside it was totally empty and only one table was occupied. The food was okayish and the drinks were chilled but must say that the service was bad. I mean they are not even good with what they are doing and cant even remember our orders. I didnt expect that they would even courteously give us a glass of water before asking for the order but am glad they did. The food was up to the mark but i would suggest they work on their service. Like work very hard. REALLY hard!

The place offers the old world charm that Kolkata is known for. Little low on the ambience which it very well makes up for with its well meaning staff, brilliant chefs and the art of cooking a perfect fish that has been passed down the generations. Ironical though it may seem coming from me, given my history with chillies, but the Chilli Pepper Garlic Fish is to die for. Their Pepper Chicken is good too. The portion of rice served is nice as well. Extra star for making my first Kolkata trip a memorable one. :)

I am a regular customer of this eatary since 1990 . Yesterday our family consist of four including one kid, went there for lunch and first time felt to be cheated . We ordered one chilli garlic pepper chicken full , two small bowl thai soup , one kungpao fish full , two kafulok gravy chow , one mixed fried rice . Taste of the foods were good , but the quantity and main ingredients were ¬†much less in comparision to the other days . I was astonished after receiving the bill , it amounts INR 3123 with tax . In other days it's cost around INR 1700 . They hiked the price of all without any notice for 70 to 100 rupees per plate for Durga puja . It's just ridiculous , that this type of restaurent can overprice for Durga Puja . On inquiry it was found no other eatary at China Town overpriced during festive season . The management should stop cheating people like this . I am going to register a complain to appropriate authority against them .

One of the worst nightmareish experience one can have. Pricing of food and drinks are too expensive. Let me give you an idea, we bought a Bacardi white rum with an mrp of around 400 for around 1200 inclusive of taxes, the best part they don't provide even the complimentary snacks that even a road side dhaba provide with the drinks. Good Luck if u are still bent on visiting this place. :-)

Pluses - 
1. Doesn't put a hole in your pocket. 
2. One of the best soups you'll have. 
3. Upper floor reserved for families. 
4. Dedicated parking. 

Minuses - 
1. Parking is one way. You'd have to reverse all the way to exit the lane. 
2. I found the noodles low in salt. 
3. Garlic fish/chicken wasn't the one we saw in Zomato photos. Was very generic. 
4. Doesn't have sweet chilli sauce.

Lemon chicken and I would ditch Big Boss and Beijing for it. They make the best lemon chicken among all the other restaurants in China Town. 

On my recent visits to this place, I tried out the Chilli Chicken and Pepper Chicken. They were good but not close to their much famous Lemon Chicken. 

This place is much less crowded compared to Big Boss/Beijing. Decor is okayish. Portions are not large enough. So, order accordingly. 

Oh yes, I would definitely visit this place for its Lemon Chicken.

First time in kafulok for dinner with the folks. The place is refreshingly less crowded than golden joy and Beijing our usual haunts . Upstairs is pleasant and sparse without the tacky wall decorations and red walls ala China town. Service was a bit slow mostly because the serves took ages to come by and took incorrect orders as a result of which we missed out on the prawns. The Thai soup, and crispy chilly baby corn was all good. The main has really tiny portions so order wisely. The mixed fried rice was good but the gravy noodles was out of the world. Best I have had in China town . It's priced pretty reasonably as well .

Heard a lot about this place and thus paid a visit. ¬†We tried Pepper chicken in starters, Mixed Kafulok Chow ( both Hakka & Gravy) and Kung Pao chicken! Each and every dish was disappointing. The noodles were not properly boiled and were pretty ordinary in taste. The chicken side was extremely dry. And the starter was the worst of the lot. The pieces were tiny and it seemed they were not marinated properly. We hardly found pepper in it and had to add some! It was just a plate of improperly marinated chicken cubes deep fried in oil. I have never been as disappointed as I was this time around! and what made things worse was the price! It was a lot higher than ordinary Chinese restaurants serving much better quality food. I am never coming back here. People should avoid this place. An utter disgrace to the famous CHINA TOWN!!

It is a simple place unlike the commercial feel of other bigger restaurants in Tangra. It also has more authentic food. Its reasonable and has a biggish hall. each table seats quite a few guests so big groups can really get anough spcae to enjoy their meal.

This place did not live upto the expectations. Its nowhere near the standard of Beijing, Kim Ling or Big Boss. 

STARTERS: We had ordered thai soup and chicken drumsticks for starters. The soup was bland and watery. The thickness of the broth was surely missing. The drumsticks tasted ordinary, lacking the CHINA TOWN touch.

MAIN COURSE: For the main course there were mixed cantonese noodles, chicken hakka noodles, fried rice and garlic chicken. The chicken tasted too sweet(as if it was stirred with sweet tomato sauce only) with a slight hint of garlic.
Cantonese noodles was not good either. The only dish that was tolerable was the mixed friedrice. 

After such an experience, I am not at all interested to write about the interiors or the service because at the end of the day, its FOOD that matters.

Another favorite restaurant in Tangra with awesome delicacies. I have tried many restaurants in China town but no other can beat Kafulok on the following preparations:-
1. Dry Chilli Chicken
2. Chilli Mushroom
3. Chilli Babycorn
4. Cantonese Style Gravy Chow

Although I don't try veg dishes in China town, but I can't resist to have Chilli mushroom and babycorn in Kafulok. Even the mushroom haters ordered a second plate.
The gravy chow has very little gravy, unlike the other versions and is very tasty.
The waiters in Kafulok are very courteous as well. The location is little bit awkward but is near to the Chinese Kalibari.

Chinatown is famous for Chinese food and this place is my favourite amongst all. The best thing here is the dry chilli chicken. You just can not get enough of it.

Before leaving Kolkata for an extended period my heart craved for some Tangra special foods and since I have heard so much about this place, decided to give it a try.. The location might be a nightmare for non-regulars to China Town, still I guess locating Chinese kalibari won't be much of an issue and this place was located just close to it..
Coming to the decor, contrary to the popular beliefs most of the eateries in this area has actually revamped their decors and ambiance and you can't differentiate them from any posh eateries in Park Street..Same goes for kafulok is well.. Service was only to the point of being decent and apt..Coming to the food, we tasted:
Fried Chicken: It was as usual, crisp, deep fried chicken cubes, taste better only still hot..
Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish: Probably I never missed this dish in any of my visits to China Town..Tasted good here as well..but seasoning could have been better..
Chilli Prawn: Fresh, cooked tiger prawns, pan-fried in a tangy, spicy sauce.. tasted apt with drinks..
Mixed Hakka Noodles: A bit too oily, also the protein content was low..
Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce: Nicely done..balanced in flavours..tasted more like Basa fish..the gravy was a bit too thick..overall nothing extraordinary but not bad either..
On the whole I would say it was a decent enough venture but given my superlative experiences in places like KimLing or Golden Joy, I don't think I have a reason to go back to this place again.. Our total cheque comes to approx Rs. 3500(all incl) for 6 people..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 3/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

Located in the interiors of china town

A very basic and staple chinatown decor 

Once it was my favourite wen it made the best haka and cantonese noodles and the best dry chilli chicken in town 

Over the years the quality and quantity have gone down and the price has increased

The maintenance is poor and the ambience has also gone down

But surely it still serves good chinese

Okay so this chinese jpint is located a bit interior from the main road. Its one of the most popular places though. I have come to this place for the last 10 years now and food is awesome . Please try the chilli pepper garlic chicken, starter, its absolutely delicious and also the cantonese noodles is yummy.

Well, I would not waste much of urs neither my time to go thru a long review. Kafulok is a place inside china town area which is in a hell lot of interior position inside tangra, I believe its probably the most interior place inside china town with good food and ambience. Definitely its worth a place to try good chinese cuisines. However, few points I would like to highlight are -
1. Prawn papad shouldn't be such oily, u have to take care of the image mahnn...
2. Garlic pepper chicken is not that good, u should try to make it better
3. Chilli fish was truly awesome

Overall, A nice place to be inside china town within a manageable amount!!

Try their chicken starters whatever u want!!

Finding the place was a big issue as it is situated quite on the insides of tangra. The decor won't impress on much and you may be tired by the time you reach this place but the food here is good. If you say non spicy - they realise what you mean. Never judge a Book by its cover and don't judge this restaurant by the way your eyes perceive it. It's good. It can be much much better !

A nice decent place tucked away from the other diners in an alley off the corner of the Chinese Kali mandir.
There is nothing much to say about the ambience!! :(
But the food was quite good.
Ratings:
Food: 7.5/10
Value for money: 7.5/10

P.S: The noodles, meifoon & rice sections are quite average. But the starter & main course chicken section does make their score.

The kung pao chicken, honey chicken & ginger-garlic-chilly fry chicken is a must try.

And if you don't like spicy side dish, try the Cantonese chicken with the spicy halka chow.... A wonderful combi..

This restaurant is located at the fag end, deep down Chinatown,near the Chinatown Kalibari,it's better to ask around if u are visiting for the first time since it can b easily missed. This is one of the most popular restaurant of Chinatown with a dedicated following of its own who swear by their name.  The ambience here is great,though when we visited there was a Chinese party going on so it was a little loud.  We had Chicken Drumsticks, Masala Fried Chicken for starters.Both were nicely cooked and good in taste. Then we ordered mixed Fried rice,and Kung pao chicken from the main course section ( we were almost full from the starters itself!), the mixed rice was a little let down but the Kung pao chicken made up for it,with just the perfect blend of hot and sour gravy.  Overall it's a nice place,with reasonably  priced food. Recommended.

Its a little difficult to find this place as it is in a narrow lane in Tangra, but the food is good and the service was prompt. Not too many people on a Friday evening worked to our advantage. We ordered chicken drumsticks, gravy chow, mixed fried rice and Chili chicken. All the items tasted good and we really enjoyed our dinner.

Had wanted to visit china town since long but it didn't really turn up the way I had expected. Anyway that's my problem! :) coming to kafulok, the entrance wouldn't give you any idea whats inside. There is a big ground floor but there was no one. So went upstairs. There also was no one apart from the waiters. :D Odd timing maybe. The decor and ambiance is really impressive but the food didn't keep up with that well. The pepper chicken was a disappointment. It was some tiny pieces of fried chicken. The meifoon was better. Tried garlic wanton noodles. It was ok..very blunt taste. Drinks are cheap.

I visited this restaurant after 12 years on a weekday evening...Used to be a regular when I used to come here with my parents...However,I was a bit dissappointed...The restaurant was completely empty and there was another family seated in the restaurant apart from us...
We ordered Fried prawns,they were crispy and well cooked....they served it fast
But,the next dish we got after almost 40 mins...Spring chicken...
We had ordered both the dishes together...The spring chicken was basically Kafulok Fried Chicken which is a whole chicken cut up into pieces and batter fried...it was average...could do with a bit more seasoning...some parts were raw as well...
For drinks,since they didn't have the 375 ml bottle,they poured out that amount of ¬†the same liquor in decanter..

I wish they could raise their standards a bit...with competitions like Golden Joy,Big Boss,Beijing taking away half the crowd in Tangra!!!

Tangra is the Chinatown of the City of Joy and a very old and favored haunt. I have visited Tangra from my late teens .... over two decades back and have watched it grow and develop n leaps and bounds. My gang of friends loved the cheap booze and I loved the wonderful food they served up. Sadly the quality has dipped a bit but I still visit occasionally for old times sake. My recommendations Chicken Thai Soup , Crispy Chili Chicken ,Chili Garlic Prawns.

People might find it strange but nowadays there is very little difference between the Tangra eateries and say Restaurants in Park Street or any plush mall,in ambience,looks or menu.But since the four wheeled SUV traffic is increasing day by day to Tangra,Kolkata's Chinatown,it is important to have a little historical perspective of the place and the restaurant boom thereof.
Tangra was where the Calcutta Chinese set up their tanneries which served the Bentinck Street shoeshops as well as other industries which needed leather.This entire area was full of tanneries and other ancillary industries which attracted a lot of labour,mainly the menial ones.Now it's common sense that hard labour needs a hard lunch and hence some of the enterprising Chinese started serving meals from their home,where the living room seated customers and the lady of the house cooked and served plentiful,nutritious,no nonsense noodles or rice and chicken.Pork was not really encouraged.
Even when I started visiting Tangra initially there were drinks served by the bottle,with a half salad ( a green salad divided in two ) to allow lean pockets to have their fill of drinks and food on a budget.Almost all the restaurants had a separate seating area for family because a group of workers after a hard days work had the propensity to be noisy over drinks and thus started the allure of people from outside to participate in this veritable feast provided by different Chinese households at an unbelievable price.
As the tanneries started moving out on a court order to Bantala,the enterprising Chinese started converting their factories and workshops into gigantic eateries,with all the props like jazzy interiors,air conditioning,modern furnitures and a tie wearing steward and servers thus losing the charm Tangra once had and just became like other restaurants but having an old world charm because of the long drive involved and the exotic location.
Now Kafulok is the old school Tangra restaurant,not the converted type,hence a little difficult to find and now it's multi-storeyed and remains one of my three favourites in Tangra.

Chicken Hakka chow mien
Chicken and prawn chow mein
Mixed fried rice
Chilly chicken
Hot garlic chicken
Prawn manchurian
Golden fried prawn

All 4 out of 5
Very rarely have we deviated from the above in the many years that we have come here,maybe sometimes with the large soup which serves 6 people and never ever have we complained of taste,but maybe of indifferent service and hygiene at times.

I ordered for mixed fried rice and chicken black bean sauce.. Food was also very good.. But the most disappointed part is about their hygiene wich they dont maintain at all... I found bones of chicken in fried rice which could have been dangerous for me .. Live small cockroaches were found roaming here n there in the restaurant specially on the table where i was eating.. I complained the same to the waiter..he took that very casually.. Plz dnt visit this restaurant. Not at all recommended..

Long wait for monsoon came to an end and my heart craved for Tangra's Chinese dishes. We foodie just need reasons to celebrate. Kafulok, located at one corner of Chinatown, has decent ambiance for family crowd at first floor.

In starters had Crispy Chilli Chicken (half) and Chilli Garlic Pepper Prawn (full). Crispy Chilli Chicken tasted average with overpower flavour of tomato ketchup. Chilli Garlic Pepper Prawn full plate has 10 king size prawns with right amount of fried green chilli and garlic. Liked the taste of the same a lot.

In main course had Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce (half) and Kung Pao Chicken (half). Mixed rice had chicken, prawn and egg and tasted nothing extravagant. Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce neither had flavour of garlic or hotness. Kung Pao Chicken has too much gravy and no sign of cashew in the same. In fact both dishes same similar. However chicken pieces were succulent.

Heard a lot about Kafulok before visiting but I find taste in Kimfa is much much better and continued to be top in my list. Price was INR 1687 inclusive all. Service was prompt too.

kafulok  ......  well The place lives up to it's  reputation till date .... is how i would like to describe it . located near the chinese kalibari , deep inside  chinatown , this place is a bit difficult to find if you're going for the first time . but  it's still worth a  visit if you're looking to have a  good time with family at a reasonable budget . we went there yesterday  evening ,   to relax & wasn't disappointed . the ambiance upstairs is very decent & thronged  by upmarket crowd . cannot comment on the ground  floor because haven't been  there .  The A/C s were very cool   as it kept the large hall upstairs from being suffocated , because when we went , the place was nearly full @ 8.15 pm . The ambiance is nothing fancy , but works well for people who like to look past it & enjoy their food & gossip their time away .   coming to alcohol prices , certainly this place is   Not The Cheapest around in chinatown , but then again kafulok is one place where people go mainly to eat , with drinks  being  secondary on the priority  list .  

¬†Coming to our order , we had half plate (1/2 ) mongolian chicken ( rs 200 ) as starters .  Although the chicken were crispy   & succulent , but i felt the Quantity was less as it had DICED pieces of around 8 .  when paying 200 bucks for a chicken dish , i usually expect regular large pieces & not 8 small   Diced ones . In drinks we had  1 large peg (60 ml ) of mcdowell's celebration rum ( rs 90 )  & 1 small peg ( 30 ml ) of the same variety  ( rs 50) ,  accompanied by  2 bottles of thumbs up (  2 X 25 = rs 50 ) .   my friend  had  1 large 650 ml bottle of kingfisher lite ( rs 150 ) .  in the main course  we had   1 plate of mix kafulok chow gravy ( rs 160 ) , 1 plate of prawn kafulok chow gravy  ( rs 150 )  & half plate ( 1/2 ) of  kungpao chicken ( rs 195 ) . Both the gravy chow  dishes were outstanding , & i could make out that it were their signature dishes . the kungpao chicken was spicy & hot  taste wise , but again i felt the quantity was   a bit less .  we deliberately avoided  prawn & fish this time around , as we were on a  tight budget . Also i felt the prawn & fish  dishes were a bit costly compared to other places in tangra . the bill to our surprise came at only rs 1209 ( rs 1055 + VAT + service tax ) .   One thing i also  noted  , that  UNLIKE OTHER PLACES IN CHINATOWN , IN KAFULOK ALCOHOL FALLS UNDER THE AMBIT OF VAT & SERVICE TAX .   A point to be noted while budgeting .   

¬†Overall a  satisfying experience & would like to go back for prawns & fish items when on  a better budget .

My verdict :   Not the most economical joint but it's all   WORTH IT

Excellent food.

A highly recommended place for scrumptious Chinese delicacies..
Kafulok is worth a visit!

This is going to be a biased review probably. This place has got some strings attached about which I am extremely sensitive. This place is not located prominently at the heart of Tangra, rather probably many people do not even know about this place. I used to visit this place twice in every year, typically once during summer and once during winter. It is located in a small lane or gully which looks not very impressive at all. I used to visit just around noon when the lunch time begins. Usually, at pick dinner hours, they restrict bachelors in the ground floor only but during noon, they allow to go to the first floor liberally. The floor is quite big with good number of seats. Usually around 12 noon, I rarely saw any other customer there. We used to order huge number of starters along with white rum. They serve on time with proper courtesy. We keep on ordering until it is 3 or 4 in the afternoon which is their closure time for lunch. They serve typical Indian Chinese. I found each and every dish strikingly tasty with huge quantity and fine quality and no, it is not an alcohol influenced judgement. The dish I love the most is Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish - a perfectly proportional combination of green chillis, garlic and pepper with slices of dried fish - simple bus fantastic. Even now, if given a choice, I have to pickup one restaurant in the city for lunch on any given day, this is the one I would blindly opt for Ka Fu Lok - the place I fell in love with!

The food is okay. The service could be better though. There is room for improvement in case of the decor and the seating arrangement as well. The dining room upstairs tends to get stuffy if there are too many people.

How can Kafulok be a "favourite hide-out", I dont get it. This place has even been recommended by some expert reviewers.¬†
God knows what was wrong the day I went. This place is just so shady, dirty, oily plates, insipid food, weird waiters...and the less i say about the "galli" and the toilet the better!! hahaha.¬†
Please don't go here, folks, please.¬†
If you want cheaper options in Tangra, there are loads.¬†
Try Ming Garden, Evergreen, Lee Garden, Kim Fa and Hot Wok Village. All are thousand times better and safer than Ka-Fu-Lok. haha

One of the fartheat in Tangra but a teusted place for good chinese food with alcohol at comparatively less coat compared to other outlets in the area. We ordered for chicken meifoon, chicken fried rice, american chicken chopsuey along with chicken in hot garloc sauce and kung pao chicken. Thr staples were made with typical tangra style and appeared good for the taste buds...kungpao chicken...hot garlic cgicken was a little spicy but the flavour was good...the chicken was succulant...kung pao was damn good and wad star among all the dishes...one can not expect fancy decor but that can be compensated with good food and great prices...

The last restaurant in the Tangra area but one of the best. Dont expect a lavish ambience.. It is a place where you should only think about your drinks and food. The most favourite hide-out of my group.. We used to go there quite often. Our favourites in the Menu were
1. Kafulok fried chicken
2.Fried prawns
3.Crispy chili chicken
4.Red pepper chili garlic fish
5.Cantonese fried wantons
6. Chicken fried rice
7.Kung pao chicken
8.Schezwan Prawns
9.Prawn chips

I want to specially mention about their sauce.. its amazing.

Just go and have a great time with your friends over amazing food

I have been to Kafulok quite a few times and I am sad to say that it is an alright chinese place compared to the other marvels present in chinatown. You can enjoy the chicken sweet corn soup and the crispy chilly babycorn. 

I do not like the ambience here. As I said, it is just alright. However, the service is prompt and they have nice dips that come with your starters and that is always a plus point for me.


Price and quantity are as always nice in chinatown and you do not feel pocket-hurt in any manner. I would say it is among the lower ranks of the better restaurants in chinatown!

One of the top restaurants in Tangra. ( after Golden Joy of course).
The fried prawns are the best here. One should go here if you like fried food.
Their chilli sauce is also outstanding.

Other good dishes are Chilis Chicken Boneless and Steamed Wantons with Pakchoy.

Not a very upscale place but overall a good meal.

The ambience of the restaurant is average and the location is in one of the by lanes of Tangra.

If you are looking for a place to drink some alcohol and on a tight budget..... well, you are at the right place. They serve you the typical Tangra type Chinese food, hot and spicy and all the liquor you want. The food tastes good and particularly, the dry chilly chicken is really good. The rest is so-so.... not bad.... in fact pretty good at this prices.

Hmmmmmm......... Why do they still cater? Neither do they serve best food in class, nor they have good service or ambience, and ease of access or parking? Horrible. They'll make you cry. Still they run, as lots of people go there to drink. So, that is the main reason of china town restaurants to survive, they offer drinks at very nominal price (compared to any other bar in Kolkata), along with good starters (chats). Well, I'm not blaming exactly, but, not a place for fine dining any way. Oh, before I finish, I must mention they serve the best Chili crab claw in the town.

Location (Rating - 3):
The restaurant is located in the inner circle of China Town is what I like to say, but not very hard to find. It is quite famous and everybody seems to know about the place and is eager to point out the direction. Well I did not ask for the location and directions to Kafulok from the other restaurant staff cuz I was afraid of getting beat up...LOL

Ambiance (Rating - 4):
Kafulok has a moderate ambiance but it makes you feel like at home. The decor is more traditional and quite spacious. It feels a little crampy if the restaurant is full but once you get a table and smell the delicacies served in front of you...PAISA WASOOL...!!!

Service (Rating - 4):
The service was lovely. The waiters are very polite and more than eager to help you if you need anything.

Food (Rating - 5):
Not all restaurants in China Town serves you authentic chinese food that have the capacity to stir up your taste buds. Even the more famous and well known restaurants serve crap, but Kafulok is one of my favourites when it comes to authentic chinese food. Again 1 plate of anything is ample for 2 so don't go alone...invite me as well...LOL

Price (Rating - 5):
The price of the dishes are very nominal. I might as well call it quite cheap without compromising the quality.

Among all the Chinese restaurants in Tangra, this one has, I think, the worst location. We had quite a bit of trouble finding this place. And after we found it, we were really worried about our safety, as we had to park in a dimly lit area, and the whole place had a shady feel to it. 
Once we settled inside, we were surprised to find that there were only two other families, and it was the peak hour.
For starters, we ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken, and it tasted quite good. Crispy and delicious.
Then we moved on to the main course, and ordered Szechuan chicken and rice noodles. We were not even half as impressed with the main course, as we were with the starters. 
Overall, we had an average experience, and, not to forget, the horrible experience in finding Kafulok.

CHINESE FOOD "KAFULOK" STYLE

Like Chung, Kafulok is another very popular Chinese restaurant located deep inside Tangra. Its remote location makes it difficult to spot at first but it is worth all the trouble in the world. In terms of ambience and decor it is not a Beijing or a Big Boss. There is nothing special about the ambience and decor. The restaurant is plain looking and very simple. Most of the locals living there can be found dining at Kafulok.  It is a testament to their authentic Chinese food. They would rather dine out than cook food at home. 

At the restaurant, place your order for their Chicken Hot and Sour soup. It is the right dish to start your lunch or dinner here. The soup is mildly hot with good amount of mushroom, fungus, tofu and lily buds. Another soup recommendation for all the foodies is their Thai soup. It has the ability to transport you to Thailand. After having any one of the delicious soup, you can have their Chicken and Prawn Chow. You are sure to find an equal amount of chicken and prawn in there. Their Sweet and Sour Prawn is another brilliant dish. The gravy in which the prawns are covered is thick and the prawns themselves are succulent. It looks beautiful and rich in colour. The same can be said for their Honey Chicken that tastes heavenly. Their Chilli Garlic Pepper Prawn is one of the many fiery dishes at Kafulok. If your wallet permits even their Chilli Crab is also worth having. Along with the meat dishes, sample their Vegetables with Mushroom and Baby corn.  Equally tasty is their starter the fiery and crispy Chilli Baby corn. All in all the food is fresh, delicious and stomach filling. The food items are moderately priced and the service is prompt and efficient.

I generally opt for the Thai soup and a full plate of Spring Chicken (Kafulok Fried Chicken) when I am visiting Kafulok. On the days I have a strong sense of disenchantment with the world, I add on a large plate of Szechuan Fried Rice, Prawn Chips and Garlic Chicken. The world looks much better afterwards.

The good thing is, the service is fast and friendly, and you would inevitably get your drinks and starter almost immediately. The Prawn chips are perfectly fried most of the times. Only on one occasions did I find them slightly oily. The quantities are big, so you should ideally come here with  around 5-6 people to do full justice to the food.

This restaurant is located at Tangra so it is a big problem to find....they serve very delicious chinese food.Chicken corn soup and chicken drumstick is very tasty. Fried chicken and pepper chicken is nice too. Ambience is good and staff is well behaved. Prices are affordable. Prawn chips is a must try for starters. Here, the chilly chicken is well prepared too. I usually have the preparations of chicken here instead of prawn and crabs. CHicken Fried rice and chicken is hot garlic sauce is a good choice. I would rate 3.5 for KAFULOK.

.Dear Friend I went to this restaurant after seen the review. But I am totally disappointed first of all the ambience you can't compare with Beijing or that kind of restaurant. Secondly the food quality is horrible. Price wise they are almost at par with Beijing but quality wise worst. All the foods are very spicy and oily. I took the Kafulok Soup it was so bad that we can't finish also. Mix Chow is so so. I took honey chicken which is favorite of my son and Chilly chicken for us both are very bad. My overall experience is so bad that if they will offer me to eat free of cost then also I will not visit again. Beijing is far far better than this restaurant. I request you never west your money here. Basically it is like a small roadside restaurant.

Kafulok is my favourite among the restaurants in china town since last 5 years . The food are awesome specially golden fried prawns and and pepper chicken . I may sound biased but I havent found any items that I didnt like here .

Though it's bit tough to find the exact location for new comers , it is the best joint I would say .

Undoubtedly, they are the best among China Town restaurants. I make it compulsory to visit this place when I am tired of having Indian & Bengali Chinese. Anything on the gravy platter is relishing. Noodles are the ones to try out for. Though not crowded, but the service needs to improve. Still, a 4-star for the taste.

its difficult to find, being in one of the bye-lanes of tangra but once you have come out you should mark the territory. its a relatively small joint when compared to big boss, beijing or golden joy but the food here is very tasty and the waiters are there in smiling attendance. really low pricing and abundant portions make Kafulok my favourite family eating place. the food is so good that even my normally fussy eater 5 year old daughter finishes her small portion at the same time as we do ours. No frills, just plain simple good food.
I definitely recommend.

u have to be colombus to locate the place and getting taxi at n8 is problematic...drinks are cheap and the place is mostly empty and thus it rocks
