Looking for a new food outlet to gorge upon,my eyes fell on this one in swiggy. With the varieties being offered at decent prices,i couldn't resist myself to order food from this place via swiggy. I had the following:-

1. Chicken tikka kebab - 6pcs of juicy tender tikka kebabs with generous coating of tikka masala was provided along with chopped salad & spicy pudina chutney. The kebabs were super tasty & was fondly gorged upon. Recommended.

2. Butter nans - Ordered a single nan which had 2 large pieces of flaky roti bread. The nans were decent. A tad bit chewy though.

3. Chicken bharta - Good quantity of chicken bits in rich oily gravy along with cream and half boiled egg. I had a mixed feeling about this dish due to it being too sweet for my taste. The presence of tomato overpowered the rich taste of the gravy which was let down for me personally.

A pretty average place to try out some good food .
Nothing brilliant about this place .
Gives you a local feeeling wuth street type food ,nothing delectable except the roll which tastes a bit different ,apart from that a pretty obvious straight edge normal place for hanging out some normal food.

This Place is situated opposite of the Patuli police Station.Someone can easily reach there.This place is just one minute distance from Eastern Metropolitan Bypass Link Road and 2 minute distance from Thakurnagar Panchpota Road.

One of my favourite place.Someone can try any menu here,they won't disappoint you.

This place used to have seating arrangements :( I miss that now.They have a great number of customer,so it is usually a crowdy place.So the neighbours complained about some problems,thus they have to close the restaurant seating area and turned into a take away.

I have tasted their fast foods and mein courses.They have a good quality and quantity.

FAST FOOD

1.Paneer Roll (35.00) (4.5/5) : The roll has soft and fresh paneer pieces and salads.They use a good quantity of capcicum and carrot in it,thus they make it more tasty.

2.Chicken Momo (!00.00) (4/5) : They serve 6 big good quality momos.The good thing is it's always freshly made.Soft,perfectly steamed,tasty chicken inside.The soup is good and healthy.The soup is also made by that time only.I would more like it if they serve it with their self made chili chutney,but they serve it with tomato sauce.But,it doesn't compromise at the taste level.

3.Chicken Roll (40.00) (3.5/5) : It is good,full of chicken and with a veggie mix.Good in taste.

MAIN COURSE

4.Chicken Tandoori Full (300.00) (4.5/5) : They serve 4pcs of large Chicken Tandoori,which are insanely good in taste.The chicken is perfectly cooked.The decoration and salads will satisfy your mind.A must try here for a tandoori lover.

5.Mughal Azam-E-Biriyani (140.00) (5/5) : Aha!They got the taste of great biriyani,subtle use of spices combined with ghee,Basmati rice and chicken. The addition of potato and boiled egg also lends a different flavour to the dish.

6.Paneer Manchurian (150.00) (5/5) & 
   Butter Naan (30.00) (5/5) : 
   Paneer Manchurian is a must try here.This item is absolutely tasty with a sweet mild spicy  
   flavour.The gravy is yummy.Everyone can't balance the flavours when it comes to manchurian   
   preparation.You're going to get a perfect experience of Paneer Manchurian here.

   The Butter Naans are extremely delicious here.

It's a nearby place of my house so I am a regular customer here.I appreciate their good quality of food and good behaviour.They maintain the hygiene and serve fresh food.A good place to visit for always.

Good quality is really good. Especially fried rice. Reasonable price and excellent location of the restaurant. Home delivery available. Order them directly instead of using these apps, will cost you ₹20-₹30 less

Ordering food from this place over phone is a nightmare. Neither their phone works properly nor the person taking the orders can understand anything. 
Food is normal and nothing great. Chicken Shaslik kabab is yummy though!

Tried the pan fried chicken momos and they weren't that great. I've had momos at this place many times earlier and it used to be a lot better and they used to give some sort of soup with it. However today's experience was plain average at best. The dish was sweet and could be a lot better. I'd recommend the rolls though.

Been ordering since it was only a takeaway joint. I have tested only there Indian menu and its good with the exception being the biriyani, i had the Azzadi biriyani to be straight forward it's dry and bland. There chicken bharta, dal makhani, paneer butter masala are some of my favorite dishes. Good for only takeaway. Pocket pinch on the higher side when compared to other takeaway restaurants.

Good food at reasonable rates! I have ordered for home delivery many times and it was always timely delivered. Mughlai cuisine was good! I loved their mughlai parantha! Biriyani and chicken. Curries were also tasty! Good option for home delivery around patuli. They deliver it on time.

A stone's throw from my place..this isn't the kind of restaurant where you would want to dine out with your family on a special day.. Nor do I find the name "Hunk Hurry" too imaginative ( even God might not know what this name begs to imply)..
If delicious food is your only concern..you might as well give this outlet a shot..as their biryani and kababs are far from unpalatable.. And the modest prices add to the allure..
The food is best when packed and devoured at home, because I reiterate, this isn't the kind of restaurant you would want to dine out at too often..
To give the devil it's due...they have a hard-working staff in place and our local folks in the neighbourhood have taken quite a liking to this outlet..
So, give it a shot if you must..maybe on one of those lonely evenings when a plateful of biryani could make you feel infinitesimally better, without digging a hole into your pocket.. :-)

Had ordered food from this place during my visit to  a relative's place.Sampled the paneer butter masala and the mushroom baby corn in hunan sauce.Firstly the food.The paneer butter masala was quite well-made, comprised of a yellowish thick gravy with decent sized cubes of paneer.Neither too oily or spicy.The quantity was decent enough and adequate for at least 3 moderate eaters.The chinese mushroom baby corn combo was surprisingly well-made.Though the pieces of mushroom and baby corn was coated with too much of cornflour in my opinion.One good aspect was it was not too hot or spicy.Quantity was decent too.
My only grouse is people who receive the phone call for taking the order are not attentive and too chatty.If this their attitude towards customers then they will soon fade away into oblivion.Need to pull up your socks soon before it is too late.

If satan and hitler had a love child and he pooped in someone's mouth, it would taste like the food here at hunk hurry.
I don't think I can say much more.
Screw the ambience. Screw the service. The food is INEDIBLE.

This place is very near to my house. Have had their Chinese food more than once.  And every time feel the same. Food quality is good.  Though they take a lot of time to get it ready.  Good for takeaway.

Food was awesome.I generally order chicken tandoori from there. Also quality is very good and price is also very reasonable. They prepare the food moderately. They did not use so much oil in their food unnecessarily. I went there with my full family for dinner and every member of my family enjoyed a lot. They actually love their food. I wish to tell them all the best and carry on.

food was okay. the Fish Manchurian was stale. the main problem with the place is the person who takes order. he is extremely rude and is busy writing bills than actually taking an order. once he was so rude that I actually walked off and I have vowed to not to visit that place again. you cannot behave like this with customers and survive . I have made it a point to advice people not to buy from here. I simply walked out without telling him a word.

My review of 3/5 is entirely for the delicious food they serve. However the service is extremely pathetic. It took them one hour 30 mins just to prepare 2 starter dishes. Also to top that the receptionist taking delivery orders misbehaved and was extremely arrogant. I would say avoid deliveries. Go for take away. The authorities should keep some decent person to attend phone calls for deliveries.

I must say, this place being in my locality - was worth a visit. I would love to keep it in my top restaurant's list. Before I write about them I would whole-heartedly thank them for making me nostalgic. I got that old taste back again. Peas pulao - needless to say a lip-smacking beautifully prepared dish with loads of love. WOW!! - I mean it was the only word that came to my mouth after I had the pulao. The fragrance - the flavour - the fresh ingredients - the colour: were simply superb! I simply fell in love with that. And another dish - Paneer Butter Masala - I would say, so far the best Paneer dish I have tasted. The thick rich gravy - the consistency - the colour - the taste, I was literally drooling. Do visit to explore more out there!

A nice fast food joint started at Patuli.Foods are tasty.
Specially i liked the Y2K roll and Double egg chicken roll.
Unlike other fast food joint, they use tasty and buttery Lacha paratha to prepare the roll

Still wondering what made the owner register a shop by this name, Hunk Harry! Seriously! I do not find it even remotely related to food. It is as incoherent as naming Apple's next gadget as "biriyani". So to say naming a technology company "Apple" itself is quite out of place, but let me not deviate. The kebabs were stunningly beautiful. I had chicken reshmi kebab and chicken hariyali kebab. Cost is to quality is to quantity ratio was impressive at the least. The chicken tandoori was a bit chewy and attacked my poor gums, and I attack their evaluation for that :)

Hurry Hurry has newly introduced it's outlet at patuli in 2015. It is not even 5 minutes away from my place. I have been trying the dishes from it's menu and to my utter astonishment all the dishes satisfy the taste buds.

We had chicken roll and paneer roll from this place. Both tasted good. Coming to the Indian main course meals, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Reshmi Butter masala (6 pieces), Kadai paneer ( too many pieces)  are all I've tasted. Among these I would recommend their Biriyani and CHICKEN RESHMI BUTTER MASALA. Hunk hurry is enough to compete with any leading Biriyani bringing restaurants. For Biriyanis you get the option tp choose your set and price. For example: Biriyani with 1 piece chicken and potato is 125. But the same with egg added would cost you 130. You get more choices of adding meat or kabaab with increasing price. 

I have also tried the chinese here. I opted for Chicken noodles, Chicken chilly (8 pieces) and drum sticks dry ones (8 pieces). Chicken noodles was in great quantity but lacked the quantity of chicken in it, chilly chicken was well prepared and the lip smacking drum sticks were heavenly. 

It's a very pocket friendly outlet that doesn't include any tax. Hunk Hurry is a take away joint and undoubtedly serves the best. They do take catering orders as well.

Please visit. :)
