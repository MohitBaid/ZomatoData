Located near the college street this is a fine place for north indian foods. But there is nothing to say about ambience or service or cleanliness. Food is no doubt good but it is not a place for a dine-in. If you are thinking of visiting this place I suggest you should take-away the food and eat them at some other place .

A small and famous outlet near college street. Was famous earlier. Now it has got down a bit in quality and maintenance but still is a nice place for cheap food. The food tastes nice but don't expect some good sitting arrangements!

Not a place to dine in. A typical take away restaurant.
The egg tadka n rumali rooti r good here. They also serve the chinese cuisine. I had garlic chicken n mixed gravy chowmein here. They were below average in taste. But the hot n sour soup was awful. It z better if u try Indian or Punjabi, never dare to order chinese from here!!

The location is definitely not "Hatibagan" it's in "Bidhan Sarani". Punjabi hotel as the name suggests but they serve Chinese as well. My companion likes egg tarka I love the plain one. Chowmine in here is good. Quantity is enough. I'd suggest take away due to the place might be inadequate

Punjab National Dhaba located on Bidhan Sarani is a good North Indian restaurant. They also serves Chinese dishes. Went here once in noon, tried their Chicken Chowmine and Chicken do Piyaja and Malai Chicken. Food quality is decent here. Chicken dishes tasted fine.
Although there was nothing called ambiance and the place was quite dirty kind of, food served was good. Staffs bit lazy and took long to deliver the order. Prices were bit more then it should have been.

Good things first- They made good quality   Rolls,chilly chicken. That's it.nothing much good to say.Ambience is not even their concern.They don't even clean the whole place well. Go if u want to avoid getting wet in rain and u see no place except this one in front.

Pure north indian cuisine. Looks very good and tastes delicious. Both veg and non-veg cuisines were very delicious. Also tried their rools they're also fresh, spicy and tasty. Recommended to all north indian and specially punjabi cuisine lover.

This is right opposite to my house lane and I've been seeing and eating from here since childhood. Their Egg Tadka & Romali Roti if always a big attraction that's tasty at all times of the day!!

The egg curry is nice and so is the chilli chicken... And the pocket friendly mix veg is also appreciable. But overall the restaurant is on the okay category... Not preferable to sit and eat... Rather a parcel would do...

Food quality isn't good..since its on my way to college I bring home their food while returning..eating there is something I'd rather not try..i generally have their chow mein..which is pocket friendly..but I always instruct the cook acc to my tastes..coz oneday i didnt and it had tasted awful..:(..iv also tried their garlic chicken(Indian style)..they make thick rolls which have many takers among the college folks..ambience is nil..food is 2.5/5..

Food is ok . Your pocket will not get pinched . Small place . If you do not cooking any thing in your home you can go their . Not a place for grand celebration ofcource . But food is ok according to the price . I shall try to go their  again .
