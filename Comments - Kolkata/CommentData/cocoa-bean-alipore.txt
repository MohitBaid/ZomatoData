Amazing bakery!! My favorite in kolkata, had first tried it at a kids birthday party- they had a theme based cake, cookies, muffins, chocolates, stick candy all so pretty and super delicious. I love their stuff... Highly recommended!!! If you live in Kolkata and havnt tried them yet...you are certainty missing out on something :)

Looking for a quickie? Or may be a place to chill after shopping with your girlfriends? Probably you're at the right place. Their cute little cupcakes, the red velvet and the brownies I tried are delicious. I have also tried their blueberry cheese cake which are moist and tasty with the right pinch of salt.

Amazing deserts! The brownies were rich with just the right amount of sweet. The cold coffee was heavenly!
Will definitely come again. Perfect place for chilling with friends.

This cafe is heaven for everyone with a sweet tooth. I first tried their chocolates as a gift for a special someone and it surpassed all expectations. Been patronizing this place ever since. Have tried out their muffins,cupcakes,mousses and cakes as well and they are all freshly made and super delicious to taste. Tried lasagnia and falafel pita wrap on my last visit and even that was really good.

Loved this place..ordered chocolates for my friends in Mumbai.. The chocolates were finished sooner than I could realise.. Try out the pan flavoured chocolates - unique and so tasty.. I also had the opportunity to try out a muffin bouqet put together by them.. Excellent presentation and muffins.. This place cannot be missed!

Mouth watering deserts and chocolates. I had quite a bit of them packed for my office mates and friends. Just loved the flavours and filling... Thanks for the designer boxes and packing as well...

Love love love this lovely little cafe. Its quirky decor and simple yet yummy food makes me go back to it, every time. The crepes are to die for. My favourite are the muffins. Specially the hazelnut creme and the chocochip. So much better than the coffee shop chains. This cafe is the reason why i love the mid range, stand alone quirky cafes so much.
