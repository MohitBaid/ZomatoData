I had ordered from here, the food delivered was very cold, it was like it was made and kept for hours, the sandwich grilled had tured soggy, the same was with the fries. Please if you love hot food and on time delivery do not order from here. I had to wait 2 hours for the food to be delivered. 1 star extra is just for the packing.

Being used to the KFC this place came as a pleasant. The food was exceptionally good. Tasting the chicken popcorn ,French fries and crispy fried chicken was simply an out of the world experience. The cheese burger was a bit different to that served at other places. Sandwiches and pizza are so fresh over here. Now I have become a regular customer of foodiez. To all the foodies ...Do definitely try the crusher and thick shake here..

Had ordered 1 combo of chicken burger  + French fries + coke. The total amount was Rs 100 only.

Pros-
* cost is quiet economic & pocket friendly. 
* taste was really good.

Cons-
*delivery time is too much ( around 120 minutes).
