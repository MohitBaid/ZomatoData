This is one of the best roll joints in and around garia. The quality and  quantity is pretty good. A friend recommended me this place for having rolls.
Coming to the food the chicken and the egg rolls are amazing. The chinese delicacies namely drums of heaven and the chicken hakka noodles are delicious too. 
This place is a must visit for all roll lovers.

Been here a lot of times. Food quantity is great. Very reasonable price. Like most Chinese places, one rice/noodles is enough for two people. Coming to starters and appetizers, not that great. Ordered Chicken Satay once. They burnt the outer layer. This place is pocket friendly, so it's ideal for students. Stick to the known dishes and you will be all right.

Well..I love Chicken rolls and I might even go on to state that the rolls served here are pretty much my favorite in the town. I have had many different rolls from here like Chicken roll, Egg chicken roll, Double chicken roll etc and have pretty much loved them all. Quality and quantity, they seem to deliver in both these aspects.
                      I have also tried out their chinese and I must say that the quantity they offer per plate is quite amazing. We tried out Chicken hakka noodles, Chilli chicken, Chicken fried rice, Drums of Heaven. Food was really good and the Drums of Heaven was absolutely lip smacking.
                     The service was fine but the ambience and presentation here could have been so much better and that seems to be the only negative here.

FINAL VERDICT- A place I would surely recommend, but personally I prefer take home from here.

Please do try their crispy chilly baby corn. It's tasty, one plate is enough for two people and price is reasonable too. They have separate roll counter too. I often visit them because it's one of the nearby restaurants from my home. Only setbacks I can mention are that they don't sell any tandoor item and they have this om namah shivaay record that keeps on playing in the dining area which is a bit annoying. Other than that the place is cool

This is our go-to restaurant for home delivery as well as family outing. Their Mixed Fried rice is something I love and the quantity is quite huge. It is loaded with egg, chicken and prawn pieces and the subtle spicy aroma pleases the tastebuds. Another dish I love is their Pan Fried Chilli Fish... soft, succulent bekti fish pieces covered in a crispy coating and tossed in sweet and sour sauce... It tastes just heavenly. Shanghai Fried rice, Hunan Chicken and Mixed Chowmein in Gravy are some of their lovely dishes.

This one is just beside my college, Andrews college. I always used to go there. Everyday. In a month I used to go 20 to 25 days in college days. Most off the time me and my friends enjoy the roll. The best rolls of garia. And our friends gathering was too there. The food are very good in taste and in a big quantity too. Love to have their food everyday. Everytime. Always.

This is a small place that serves chinese and Indian dishes. The food is ordinary, nothing special.
The most beautiful aspect of the restaurant is the location, right in front of Kanungo Park, which is quite breezy during the hot summer days. So, in turn, eating here is bit relaxing too.

Pros: Reasonable price. One serve quantity enough for 2 heads. Friendly service person. 
Cons: Not much.just the small place. Opt takeaway if the ambience is hampering your hunger.
I have visited this place many times over last few years..now they have also changed their sitting area. Over the years have tried almost all of their menus.. Their Chinese preparations are worth trying. Nice option(probably single in min 1km radius) in Garia bus stand area for North Indian and Chinese cuisine.

I am a hungry soul, so i got two other such soul mates along with me and sat upstairs at this place and had their chicken biryani. This has got really tricky and narrow stairs that lead you into a seating place which is just a mezzanine floor and god bless if you are 6feet or above it. Their rolls are best, but biryani was not at all bad, they had given an egg as well in it. We tried their lemon corriander soup also, it was nice and fresh. You can visit this joint beside kanungo park for cheap, tasty meals.

Whenever i think about Shivam, the first thing i remember is their extremely delicious chicken roll. Shivam is a small restaurant near Dinabandhu Andrews College. It is famous as a take away counter. Their claim to fame is their Rolls. They also prepare it according to your taste and instructions. The quantity they provide is huge. The taste and quality are also very good. The chicken roll has a yummy   
"achari" taste which makes it unique and popular. It will be a sin if I don't mention about their veg roll. It's just awesome. I have tried their chowmein once. I won't say it was bad but it was nothing praiseworthy. If u are very hungry and in a mood to have an evening snack with yum fastfood then do visit Shivam.

The good: 
Masters of rolls, chicken roll, egg roll, paneer roll and everything. The rolls are BIG and they taste yummy. Typical chinese dishes are amazing - my standard pick is chicken fried rice + chili fish and steamed Momo. Quantity is actually great, more than enough for a couple who can eat average volumes. They deliver to your door steps within a radius of 2-3 KM for small orders also.

The Bad:
They have a huge menu, but they are not as good as they are for chicken fried rice + chili fish. I would rather suggest to avoid Indian dishes by them, they don't know what they are cooking. They have a very limited dine-in capacity. The home delivery typically takes 1 to 2 hours to deliver, so plan accordingly. Also please be prepared to remind them about the delivery couple of times. Remains closed without notice.

Verdict:
Super value for money if you do takeaway and stick to conventional Chinese menu and rolls. They are masters of rolls. Super volume and home delivery options available. Great Chinese food at this price range.

Living in Kolkata we get plenty of options to taste great food.. but is Shivam a worthy candidate for a look in? Well ya, it is. Their starters are mostly unavailable n soups are not worth a look in but go for Pan fried fish n dry chili chicken. They get a thumbs up! Their chicken bharta is awesome and if u have it with a paratha, you would have little space in your tummy. They serve their chinese the best with plenty of chicken chunks. Their content is more than satisfactory going by the easy price. Their rolls are humungous n go for double egg double chicken roll. The ambience they provide is not worthy of a dine in restaurant n the waiters have no clue of whats going on. So overall, if you ever get to Garia region you can surely give it  a try provided you have managed to climb to the first floor..

Rolls are good and filling.The size offered here is probably the biggest in garia region.However,I would not rate it high on taste.It is good,but nothing extraordinary. 

Their veg roll is a bit expensive (priced much higher than the egg roll),but is staffed with many things,ranging from paneer to cashew to chowmein to what not!)

Haven't tasted their restaurant menu.SO can't comment on that aspect.But there is severe space shortage,and its like climbing a mountain to reach the restaurant located on the first floor (mazenine floor,with false ceiling).

So I do recommend it for rolls,and only rolls I feel.

A very pathetic experience. First time in my life I got served stale food from any restaurant. We visited Shivam yesterday on the day of Mahanavami(22.10.2015) and ordered Chinese food. As starter we ordered dry chilicken. Out of 10 pieces 5/6 pieces were having a stale smell. I highlighted this to the service guy and asked him to ensure proper food items are served in the main course. In the main course same thing happened with every chicken dish we ordered. I called up the service guy and complained...The lame excuse that he gave that he is a service person and don't have any control over the kitchen. We returned the chicken dish from the main course. The only thing that they did was not to include one of the chicken item's in our bill...Will never visit this Shivam Restaurant in my life.

The rolls here are humongous with generous amount of filling,  making for a perfect snack option. They make great kebabs as well. However,  they should use a better quality of oil for all the cooking. Couple of times I have fallen sick after having THE SHIVAM ROLL.

The place is really small enough but it surely does provide good food to satisfy your appetite. Do order Chinese since they are good in making it & for once taste the chicken roll that they make, the best roll I have ever had till date & cost is quite reasonable. It is just opposite to the playground of Dinabandhu Andrews College, Garia. Happy fooding & keep zomatoing...!!! Cheers...!!! ☺

Easy to find, but the ambience is a very big turn-off. Very limited space and seating capacity. I've had Mixed Gravy Chow, Chicken & Egg Fried Rice, Pan Fried Chicken Momo, Chilli Chicken & Dry Chilli Fish. Everything was great! More than sufficient quantity for this price range. If you are very very hungry and want to have a good filling meal this is definitely the place to be!

For what looks like a takeaway joint from outside, the quality of food is really commendable. If this place could expand into a proper dining place it could work wonders! Definitely going back here again!

This is my go to place whenever i crave for rolls. This place is a hit among people and specially college students due to the mouth watering rolls which they serve. An egg chicken roll will cost you around rs 40 and it's filled with lots of chicken and the sauce is also in proportion along with the veggies. You can also try out their Chinese dishes such as the drums of heaven. Crispy chicken, etc. The seating place is abit clustered so that's the only drawback!.

Food is really good.both quality and quantity is more than someone will expect.rolls are lip smacking.your inner soul will urge you to come here for those rolls.chinese cuisine is more preferable than indian.

This my go to place for rolls after my tutions get over. Although one can say its space is small it is true but its not a factor for me as I get pocket friendly snacks which really satisfies me plus its services are quite fast and friendly too... So one can give it a try especially college and school going students for a nice snack time

Ok the first thing that i would say is that the place is very small...people having claustrophobia should never come to this place...even the ambience is not good...all packed up...have to wait for hours to get a seat....the food here presented is a kind of average type!

Well I bumped into this restaurant last week. It's an well affordable restaurant for students like me. I went in there with a friend. The ambience was good but it's a very tiny place. One would find it difficult to get to the 1st floor. The ambience was okay. My friend had ordered Biriyani and I settled for chicken steamed momo's! Well the Biriyani tasted okay it was at par but the momo's tasted delicious. The stuffing inside the momo's was done very well. If you are short on money and hungry well this is a place to get in for some delicious food at affordable rates.

It's one of the nice place to have food. Starters, especially egg rolls are very popular and pocket friendly for college students. They serve larger quantity of food. I prefer to have home delivery from this place because I found the seating arrangement is less comfortable.

I have only had their rolls and I love it! Located near Dinabandhu Andrew's College in Garia, it is the hang out place of college students. Being cheap and pocket friendly is the added advantage! The rolls are larger than the normal rolls you get elsewhere.. 
Give it a try!

Shivam is located just beside kanungo park. I'm a frequent visitor of kanungo park since it's an adda spot for us & i'm sure for many more around garia :3.

I've only had their rolls & we found them really juicy & succulent. They also come in big size than an average roll. But I've never had chinese unfortunately. Price is reasonable like any other place

It was yesterday that I, along with two others were very hungry and being at Garia thought of giving this restro a try.
The look of the restro from outside was not that appealing to me but once I get to climb up the small steep staircases to their first floor sitting area, it was a feel good factor that worked due to their neat and clean interior.
We ordered chilli chicken and chicken fried rice. The rice was tasty and with big chunks of chicken, the surprising factor is their quantity I have never been to any restrau till date that serves so much in quantity. One plate is enough for two giants to satisfy their hunger. The chilli chicken was not bad however it could have been a bit more tender, they were not soft enough and we found a bit of difficulty in chewing and tearing them with our teeth.
The commendable point of 4.5 is only due to their (i) neat and clean sitting area as cleanliness is very necessary in a restrau in order to provide freshness and hassle free eating; and (ii) the amount/ quantity of food.

Being located at walking distance from my home back in Kolkata, I have been here umpteen number of times, just never got the chance to review it. Located just beside the playground of Dinabandhu Andrews College, it's pretty easy to locate. A small outlet, but carefully architected to make a second storey for a dine in place of about 15 odd people, I just love to visit this place once in a while and whenever am in town for the quality of foods they offer. What I have tasted from here are
1. Chicken/Mixed fried rice - Very good in terms of both quality and quantity. One plate suffices two adults, and it's full of chunks of chicken and scrambled eggs and crunchy vegetables. The mixed rice comes with shrimps mixed as well.
2. Noodles - Thick egg noodles mixed with the usual fillers, according to the variant you are ordering. Again thumbs up for both quality and quantity. 
If I start writing about all the side dishes I had,I would be too long a review, but you can trust me and have their Chicken sweet and sour, Chilli Chicken, Schezwan Chicken, Chilli Garlic Pepper Fish..all of them are quite descent and justifies with the price.
Some extra information.. If you are from Kolkata, you should know..and if you are not, then you may know..they offer biriyani, don't try that..that is certainly not their forte. (try at Aminia which is at walking distance from there) They make excellent Chinese dishes and not to forget.. The best rolls in the locality. Must try their Shivam Special Roll. It's an exquisite one with a big crunchy laccha paratha on the outside and fillings of chicken, bell peppers, fried onions, boiled eggs, cashew nuts and raisins in the inside. One roll can make ur heart crave for more but your tummy will surrender.. It's a funny feeling, trust me. ;-) 
During rush hours waiting time can go upto 25-30 mins, otherwise fast.
Final verdict - if you are in garia, try this place..a very underrated yet very good family restaurant. Cheers!

I have never been to the restaurant and I have never even seen the restaurant. Why the hell am I reviewing this place then? That is because I have ate the food from this place. Once, I had a night stay at my friend's place and she stays at Garia. So, her mother and my beloved aunty recommended this place for dinner at night. She ordered the food and it was delivered at home. So home delivery.
Now the food, The food was quite delicious. I didn't expect a small joint to make good food. Well, I should have expected. Small joints are more familial. Anyway, the hakka noodles were quite tasty and the chicken pieces in the noodles were big and mouthful. The side dish was Shivam special chicken that contained different kind of be peppers and cashew nuts. The gravy tasted similar to a chili chicken gravy but the condiments in the gravy enhanced the taste. The chicken pieces were fresh and quite big, again! The food was though, quite oily. The hakka noodles are supposed to be oily, I know, but not super oily. 
Positives: The food is good, the pieces of proteins are big.
Negative: Super oily food. 

I would not be eager to visit this joint someday because I am not that blown away by their food but if I am at Garia sometime, at a friend's place or maybe by compulsion and I need food, Shivam would be in my mind.

Located near Garia dinabandhu andrews college, small store with dine in and take away counter, Rolls served here is best in this locality, price is ok for its size and quality. There dine in counter is very little in space and short in height also with AC. Fod quality is fine specially Chinese dishes.

The rolls served here are the best!!!! The size is huge and the price is cheap. I used to have a bite of the chicken rolls everyday after my swimming classes there. The option of customising the roll is commendable- oil free paratha, no sauce, no chillies, lots of spice and plenty of lemon juice. .. I travel all the way from Jadavpur to have its rolls....... yummy yummm.
Of late I have noticed that their behaviour is cold. They bother you a lot for change in spite of having loads of change in the drawer. Sometimes they even turn you off without any food if you don't have change. Such type of arrogance doesn't work and I regret for having been their regular patron. Their arrogance doesn't make the chicken rolls taste any good anymore.

Small sitting arrangment with great food quality and quantity along with monetary satisfaction.
Pan fried chicken momo is a must try,its spicy,saucy and yum..mouth watering.
Other dishes are also very nice hunan chicken canton chicken paneer butter masala chiken butter masala are worth giving a try.
Try their's biriyani and chicken 65 (south indian flavoured chicken) at your own risk..Thats the only negetive point..

It was founded in 15th August 2010 with a fast food corner.. Now it's well know restaurant at Garia as well as a landmark of Garia.

As per my concern ,if you want to have a quality food with your regenable pocket panch then i will suggest you to go with "SHIVAM FAMILY RESTRO" .One of the specialty of this   Resto  is that ,it provide tasty food with huge  quantity,Two Adult  person can share a plate (main course ) easily .Rollsssssssssss  is one of great attraction of this Restro .Different  types of Fish and Prawn items are specially favorite of mine.Because as per my taste  i fill they provide a good quality of Fish and Prawn.

This are one of my Favourite dish that i frequently order ."PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH " with "SHIVAM SPECIAL FRIED RICE (NON0VEG)".!!!!!!!!!! Ammmmmmmm Loving it

Well the location is bad for a restaurant. Its inside a lane in a residential area. This small restaurant serves many dishes and most of them are pretty average except for the biriyani which is just too bad. I live very close to this place and hence when I can't drag myself to somewhere else for outside food I resort to this place. The Chinese items are okayish. The rolls are however quite good. Especially their veg roll which is more expensive than the chicken roll is worth the buck. Overall this is a standard para restaurant deserving a 3.
