I have ordered from them.... chicken tikka was awesome, it was marinated well & soft too. quality was good & size of chicken pieces were also standard. brownie was in my cart which was delicious but quantity was very less according to price. brownie should be more big if or you shold decrease the price of brownie. otherwise no issue. it was a good experience.

I have given 4 rating but when I order for 2nd time on 14 january, 2018. complementary desert which is brownie was half of the portion which they had given last time. fooling people is very wrong & this attitude of restaurant will damage their reputation, their ffod is good but I will never order from here because of this kind of mentality of fooling people, still I am not reducing rating under 2.5 coz the chicken pakoda which I ordered was good.

I am giving pic, that people can understand that what happend wrong.
the 2nd pic is brownie of 1st order & 3rd pic is brownie of today's order. anyone can see that the quanticy has reduced to half, I mean quantity hasn't reduced, they sent me thinking it's my 1st order & I will no understand that they are fooling me.

Overhyped and overpriced. The portions are quite less. Although the ambience is décor is nice, I would certainly not give more than 3 points.

This is a cafe bang opposite City Centre 1 and it lives up to it’s reputation. It’s a cozy cafe which serves hookah along with sumptuous food. The Chicken salad was the best ! Do drop in and enjoy !

Another awesome cafe located just opposite City Centre 1. Well I met my better half in this place after almost 8 months and though we have been to most of the cafes in and around salt lake, this was my first visit to this place. It was ashtami and we had a reunion lunch plan with our friends group but we had some catching up to do and coffee seemed a good option. I opted for the kit kat shake and she opted for the choco cookie shake which both were fabulous and for food we ordered crispy chicken with BBQ sauce. A clear winner and dish which I cherish specially when I am out of town, it was perfectly made specially the dips. The food is 5/5 .
Coming to the ambiance I guess for a joint like this once again this place has that classy feel which many of their compatriots lack and here also it scores high with comfortable seating arrangements and again it is 5/5. 
Lastly the staff is more than courteous and one of them was more than polite when we repeatedly made him take pictures. So again full marks 5/5.
So if you want to spend some quality time with your better half or just have a good conversation with a buddy think no further, this is the best place with good food, decor and friendly staff.

Located opposite to City Center1, this is a nicely decorated cafe that has 2 sections. The front area is more like a cafe decorated with cute show pieces representing beverage theme. The inside area is the hookah bar with live sports screen. The ambience is too darkish. Though no one was available in the front area, i grabbed seat inside the hookah area ordered mix of coffee, chocolate milk shake which tasted very good. Price is also reasonable. Somehow i was not satisfied with their fingerfoods in the menu. Its more of regular Chinese dishes.

Located opposite to city center 1 , salt lake , I came here with my colleagues for coffee and evening snacks . Ordered paneer tikka sandwich and veg cheese crepe and capuccino . Both the dishes tasted amazing. The cafe has three sections , the innermost section being generally for hookah lovers. The paneer tikka sandwich in particular was everything i had always wanted to be in a veg sandwich .the fillings were cooked properly , was spicy and paneers were properly minced  and were of good quality . Overall a good experience ☺

The restaurant is very easy to locate as it is situated at just the opposite of the city center 1. The seating arrangement is divided into two segments, one at the entrance and one at inside. It is preferable to seat inside if you're willing to order a hookah. There's live sports screening is going on at the restaurant.

Coming to food , we ordered-----

° Veg Hawaiian pizza - A thin crust pizza with unusual topping of paneer (cottage cheese) and pineapple. This fusion really went out very well and it was one of the best pizza I've ever had for sure.

°Kitkat shake - A really good KitKat shake, how a KitKat shake should be. A really dense and rich in taste milkshake.

°Kiwi flavoured hookah - The hookah was preety good. The flavour was intense and they provide several filters too.

This is a pretty good restaurant for hangout with friends. Not really so expensive restaurant yet not so pocket friendly too, everything is reasonably priced. A good experience.

The food doesn't taste bad actually. BUT, the staff really need a training on customer handling. They literally told us to leave on the day of Eid because we had a little app deal, when we pointed out that it was nowhere mentioned that food won't be served on festival days, and informed little app about it. They served us with a grumpy face.  Now today I again took a risk to order from this place. They called after 40 minutes saying that my place is 9kms away while it's only 4 kms away 😑

This review is for the non hookah zone.
First point to be noted: there is no staff available here when you enter the place, which leaves you clueless. The security seated outside went in and brought a server.
Ambience: needs a desperate facelift, the Buddha statue is filled with dust, the books on display are all rooten from inside
Staff: they don't smile at all, don't welcome you and no personal attention is given. Once my meal was over, only saving grace was that head chef came to take feedback.
They have Bell system, which doesn't work apparently, so you are essentially stuck there with no servers and a defective Bell service.
Food: pretty average. I ordered hot and sour soup which was very very spicy but okay.
I also ordered chicken drumsticks which were again too spicy and overly saucy.
Next I ordered Cantonese noodle which was okay.however it came after ages of waiting time whch regards totally ruined our appetite.
I also took chocolate crepe which had tons of chocolate
Final version: please don't bother to visit if you are not there for hookah, I'm unsure how the hookah area is, but staff is definitely uninterested to serve people sitting outside in the café.ambience wise also, its rather dusty and old.

The cafe was good. But the audacity and weird attitude of the staffs were a turn off. Nothing very great about the cafe. The food wasn't appreciable. The plating was disgusting. The staffs assumed we were there for hookah and took us to the hookah zone. And, then the constant stares. The cafe needs to work on his staffs. They need real time training.

The cafe is located in a proper place just opposite City Centre 1. Bang on location. The cafe is pretty big. They even have a non hookah zone which looks very pretty. I preferred sitting inside. The ambience is cozy and comfortable.

I ordered Mint Mojito Hookah. As I wanted a mild hookah so the person taking our order suggested the flavour. The hookah was good. It was mild like we wanted and it lasted long. Coming to food, I opt for Chicken Salami Pizza and Crispy Chilli Mushroom. The pizza was also suggested to us and it was scrumptious. I don't like Mushroom but they made the Mushroom dish very tasty.

It's a decent place which is pocket friendly with prompt service.

The service takes time. 
But the food is pretty good. 
Ordered Mexican nachos and shisha. 
The nachos was yum. You should try it at least once. Worth the money. 
The shisha was okay.

Food was average, to be specific I personally didn't like the Thai fried rice balls.
Service was below average, staff were not welcoming not even attending us properly, they seemed more interested in serving on hookah zone and not on the other side.

Opposite City Center 1 there is this small cafe that serves hookah too..  Me and my friend just dropped in there to have hookah and something to nibble..  So we got their special hookah which is a must try..  In addition we ordered the mushroom bruchetta and the baked chicken lasagna..  The bruchetta was a bit salty but didn't harm the taste much.. The lasagna was a tasty one but not an extraordinary taste to mention about.   Overall a pretty cool place to hangout for the youngsters..

Today went there with my bestie. Ordered Salt n pepper chicken, Chicken cheese blast pasta, cafe latte, orio shake and Lime mojito. Food was very testy. Coffee was just too good. Stuff was very prompt and well mannered.
This was my third visit. 
Subho Bijoya- Since 2016 to today, AC of the entrance is still out of service. We went there on Astami evening for 6th time and the AC was still out. Puja times, don't stop kidding with your customers! When I asked if they have any empty seats inside, we can also wait. The Stuffs were irritated and said there is no seat inside, we have to seat without AC. The were also confused about there new puja menu. 
Where is your owner? Is he/she ever around? Does he/she have any idea about your work here? 
Hopeless!!!!

As u enter the area is cafe, the other door leads to shisha area. We opted for cafe section as we had to grab a quick tea and some snacks. Ordered ginger tea, which was great. Then as per recommendation we ordered chicken pakodas. Taste was good and the quantity was decent. Prompt service and friendly staffs. Will definitely visit again to try other dishes.

We didn't order much food except Cheese Garlic French Fries and surprisingly they were good too. The cost is not high like most other cafes in Salt Lake. All in all a good place to hangout.

The interiors are not too much stressed and the decor is moderate.

This place gets 2 only for its ambiance and music. The food was the worst i had had. This place overall has an average review and rating but my experience was unfortunately not good. We ordered a cafe mochachilo and a chocolate shake which was unavailable so we settled with cold coffee and a strawberry shake. Both milk products seemed to be watery. The starter order was veg shami kebab which was very dry and laden with chillies. In main course we ordered pasta in mix sauce which was the only item we ate properly. Lastly in desert we wanted a mud pie which was also unavailable and we got a brownie in exchange which seemed to be rather old and was too dry.
Not much recommended by my experience.

My friend suggested me this place and we had gone there a few months back.
Very easy to locate and the cafe is situated opposite to City Centre, Salt Lake.
We ordered Drums of Heaven, Veg Schezwan Noodles and a glass of Blue Lagoon.

•Drums of Heaven- I liked this dish the most,as the chicken was tender. The dish was not dry as in most cases, it was topped with a sauce made of bell peppers which was spicy with a tinge of sweetness.

•Schezwan Noodles- This dish was okayish not too extraordinary. Spicy with veggies,served with a salad.

Blue Lagoon- It was simple yet refreshing though not presented too well.

Keeping in mind the price the quantity was sufficient.
The decor was simple and nice.
Though service was a bit on the slower side.
Overall the experience was satisfactory.

I had ordered Cheese Blast Pasta online. It was delivered in time accompanied with a garlic buttered toast and a small pastry (I am not sure if that really was pastry). The pastry tasted weird and could note  even proceed after a single bite. Now the most disgraceful part! I ordered a VEG item (cheese blast pasta) as recommended by the reviews in zomato. I found two pieces of chicken inside it. Even though I am a non-veg and paid for the veg item only it is highly comtemptuous as one orders something veg item and ends up tasting chicken in it. Otherwise, the taste was good although not overwhelming.

The best thing about this cafe is that it has a separate cabin that you can access if you are not comfortable in the regular sitting area because of the hookah smoke. The yum yum mozzarella sticks and crispy chicken in BBQ sauce is a must try. They also have free WiFi in case you need it. I just love this place. Totally recommended. :)

A highly shady and pathetic place, I found the food to be nothing more than bad.
There is no parking available for this place.
The shakes smelt foul, I believe the milk used wasn't good. The food is bad.

A very average place located near City Centre one.
The service was way below par and the music horrible creating a bad ambience.
We went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and ordered Nachos and American Spicy Pepper Corn to begin with. The Corn was good and tasty but the Nachos were stale as were the sauces.
The lime soda was a good one as was the blue lagoon, but the chocolate shake tasted exactly like milk with Cadbary Chocolate powder and nothing more. 
The Pizza was again good enough but nothing great, while the pasta was sweet.
The highlight was the mud pie. Best by far and with amazing taste. Definitely would recommend the mud pie but the overall experience was a huge disappointment.

Had Double Apple mint Hookah & Fish & chips.
Blissful ambience, perfect for a shisha joint.
Fish & Chips was good, could have been better.
Later I ordered a plate of Risotto Polo, was simply delightful. The fried mushrooms on the side, made it more delicious.
4 for the food and +1 for ambience.

This outlet us located in the foot opposite to C3, CC1. The place looks small from outside, but move inside, they actually have two more rooms. Mainly known for quick moving food items and hookah. 
The mocktails are recommended. The chef is nice guy, and he will sit with you to explain the dishes. They recently launched a more Italian inclined menu, and it was worth a try! For loyal customers, they even have a membership card that offers discounts.

I really loved my experience at Le Coffee Creme. We had ordered the Chicken Russian Salad, Drums of Heaven, Barbeque Chicken Pizza, Cola Float and Choco Lava Evasion. The salad and starters were lipsmacking. The pizza base was a bit too doughy and floury. It had a bad aftertaste. But the toppings were tasty. The Choco Lava Evasion was the showstopper. The hot chocolate lava oozing out of the cake along with the cold vanilla ice cream melting over it is sure to give you extreme ecstasy!

A small secret house for the hookah lovers.The place is just opposite of CC1 fountain gate.We will be greeted Hartley by the gaurd at the gates.inside it's bit loud with the music going on,with the night shades.The Hookah section is just beside the bar.it is decorated by some comfortable sofas,the wall is decored by some guitars.so for ambience a 4 out of 5.coming to the service it was really bad as we asked for some water it came around Atleast 15 min late.we ordered a blue lagoon based Hookah and two lime mojitos .The mojito were awesome.So both for service and food a joint 3.5 of 5.over all if you are in a mood to spend the time with your friends with some hookah the place is a ok.

But the food wasn't good. There was a cockroach in a drink that we had ordered and a fly in the shake that we had ordered.

The call bell is of no use, even though you ring the bell no one attends you instead it's switched off by one of the staff at the counter.

Located near City Centre 1 so it's very easy to find. Basically it's a hookah parlor and cafe. The good quality is good and prices are low but a very bad service. Food is served very late. Even if you tab the button to call the waiter they usually don't arrive on time

Takes a lot of time to attend to guests who are sitting outside, even if the calling bell is rung. Takes a lot of time to cook. The food, though, is great. The chicken fondue & the Picata platters are my favorite. They are mind blowing. The price is reasonable too.

We ordered two chicken lasagne which cost us around 660 bucks, with the VAT and container charges. But to the sheer disappointment of a cheese-lover, the lasagne had NO cheese. And by NO i mean None at all. Just the lasangne strips and chicken. The taste too is nothing that great. But who likes lasagne without cheese?

Visited this place few weeks back, this is just opposite to cc1 in salt lake. They have two sitting areas, unfortunately they were not serving hookah the day I went but we had a heavy lunch out there which was satisfactory. I ordered for a crispy chicken for starters, in main course one burnt ginger rice and chili mushroom to accompany. I also got one virgin mojito and we asked for another special red bull mojito. Taste was very good and quantity was perfect for two. Presentation could have been better, the service was very slow of food. It took ages for them to prepare. 
Overall if you have lot of time to spend then this place would be good to visit.

Le Coffee Creme is easy to spot, located bang opposite to City Center 1. 

It is a cafe with hookah options and the semi dark interior is done quite thoughtfully with pictures on the wall and lampshades hanging from the ceiling. 

The service is little slow but the staff is courteous. 

You need to order the food wisely. We had ordered a number of dishes. Listing down some of their best offerings - 

Crispy Prawn, Baked Fish, Special Tangri Pizza, Spinach Fritatta, Chicken Spahetti Bolognese.

Price :  Reasonable.

This place .. Opposite to city centre salt lake..  an ideal place to hang out with frnds!
They've many sections with a separate hookah section!
Loud music, dark ambience, spacious!

Their food is amazing.. with beautiful presentation and good in quantity! On my Sunday visit to this place I tried some of their items..

1. Special Tangri Pizza🍕 being a pizza person.. I can say that was amazing crispy and the toppings were so good!

2. Crispy Prawn- this was good.. a prawn starter !

3. Baked Fish- this was little salty .. but cooked well and had it's softness and texture!

4. Spinach Fritatta- this was a brilliant presentation!

5. Chicken Spahetti Bolognese- I love spicy food and this was so apt for me.. loved this ! One of their most recommended items!

6. Chocolate Rim- this had the concept of brownie with vanilla ice cream.. good to try 

6. Chocolate Souffle- must try liquid chocolate Flavoured very beautiful to eat!

For drinks we tried Apricot which was so refreshing
Miami was nice..
And Italian smooch .. chilled and refreshing!

Overall the experience was beautiful with good courteous staffs who were ready to help!
Do visit this place.. for the best times!

Located bang opposite City Center 1, this one is hard to miss. It has two sections inside, one for non-hookah people, other for hookah lovers. We sat in the former as we didn't want to have sheesha.

Here's all the things we ordered:

1. Sausage Salad: Tastes okay, and would be perfect for the health freak in you.

2. Palotla Fungi: The texture was smooth as ever, and ought not to be missed.

3. Baked Fish: A little different from the usual Baked Fish, and different for good reasons. The generous layer of cheese on top did no harm, and the taste left yearning for more.

4. Spinach Fritata: Tasted okay, the taste of spinach was heavy so the leafy lovers would definitely enjoy this.

5. Crispy Prawn: There is a toothpick inside so you need to be careful while gorging on this. It is fried to perfection, and the smell is really enticing.

6. Bolognese: On the spicier side, and since I am not too fond of spicy dishes, this didn't appeal to me.

7. Special Tangri Pizza: This was the best of lot, and dont miss this. It is thin crust, so it adds to the awesomeness.

8. Brownie Shake: One of the better shakes, I have had in recent times. Don't miss this.

9. Apricot: Great for summers.

10. Miami: Really refreshing, will make you feel energised.

11. Chocolate Soufflé: For the chocolate fanatics, this one is for you. Just go and have it, and you are sure gonna be a repeat offender of this place.

12. Choco Rim: Generous amounts of chocolate indulgence.

This place is located just opposite to city centre. Cool ambience, bigger space with loud music. A great place to hangout with friends. We had some amazing drinks like brownie shake, miami, Italian smooch followed by sausage salad. They have some good starters like crispy prawn with lots of crunch outside and juicy flesh inside, Baked fish. 
In the main course we had chicken spaghetti Bolognese, special Tangri Pizza. Pizza was awesome. At last chocolate Rim and chocolate souffle makes the magic. Service was good as well as the food. If you will go with my words try their Pizza.

Bang opposite of Çity Center 1, is situated this massive restaurant Le Coffee Creme. It has 4 sections, with the middle one having huge TV for screening sports. Loud music rocks the entire area.
Coming to the food and beverage.
We ordered for a number if drinks, and each of them were fantastic. Brownie Milkshake, Miami and Appricot Mix deserves mention.
Then for starters we ordered Baked Fish and Crispy Prawn both were very good.
In Mains we ordered Chicken Spaghetti Bolognese and Special Tangri Pizza. These two were yummy.
Service was okay.
Prices bit on the higher end.

This cafe is located bang opposite to City Centre 1. It looks small from the outside but it actually has here separate seating areas which are quite spacious. The outside room is a cafe while the other two rooms inside are more like lounges with sprawling sofas and loud music. Came in here with a few friends for an early dinner. We ordered these items:
Sausage salad
Crispy Prawn
Polo Ala Funghi
Baked Fish
Spinach Fritatta
Chicken Spaghetti Bolognese
Gnocchi Arabiatta
Special Tangri Pizza
Chocolate Rim
Chocolate Souffle
Mocktails- Miami, Apricot Mix, Italian Smooch,Brownie Shake.
All the items were quite good. My recommendation would be to go with the starters and the pizza. The gnocchi and souffle was something different that I tried. Overall, good place to hang out over some good Adda and good food :-)

Food is quite acceptable but the service is atrocious . With the loud music and non functional call bells at tables you need to be really loud and patient to place an order. The waiters mostly crowd together at the computer console playing songs they seem to want to listen to. I went on a Sunday afternoon and despite repeated requests the music stayed loud and made conversation impossible. Well the ambience kind of mimics a pub, which is strange for a coffee place .

A silent lookimg cafe opposite cc1 and known foe its hookah. Apart from hookah the cafe became very popular once it opened and i too loved it. However they are unable to live upto their expectations.
Recently the place was full of mosquitoes.
We were sitted outside in the first section where they have pressed calling bells to call the server. However keep pressing. No one comes. Then we go inside call them. Then service is slow. Items are bad.
#brownie shake- too thick. Tasteless
#cold coffee- nothing good about it
#chicken lasagne-tasty. No doubt
#tortillas-they took ages to serve so got it packed. Decent enough.

Ambience is good. Overall nothing so great about it.

I am not much of a hookah person because the smoke kind of chokes me reason I avoid going to outlets serving hookah. But I visited le coffee Creme recently on work for a photoshoot and I was quite impressed by their layout. They have different sections for hookah and cafe.
The first section that you come across while you enter is a beautifully decorated and well lighted cafe area. The next sections include the dim lighted hookah parlors.
The head chef Mr.Tanmay was generous enough to treat me with a few of their best dishes and Boy was I impressed ?!

The chef special chilli chicken swooped me off the floor. And the spaghetti pasta in pesto was heaven in my mouth.
The star of the meal was the dessert however.
The brownie was sooo gooey I got a sugar rush..

I had ordered fresh lime sweet which tastes good and fresh .
The shezwan noodles was amazing and the manchurian with gravy was yum too .
But the show stealer was their mud pie . It's like a mud pie on a tart with vanilla ice cream and warm chocolate sauce .
Definitely worth a visit 🤓

If you are looking for a peaceful place then let me warn you, THIS IS NOT THE ONE. 😂 Loud music, dark ambience, rocking, stunning lights, a dark red guitar, group of boys talking, singing at the top of lungs. It's for YOUNGSTERS who sit with hookahs and make funny smoke rings. A cool place to hangout with FRIENDS. If one wants to come here on a date then can try the inner room. It's cozy and gives you privacy.
Food is good. Quantity little less. Coffee (cold or hot) is must as the name suggest. Service is slow in days when it's crowded. Not to deny, they are cooperating since I love to play with tissues and they provided me ample of them to Continue my madness. Lol.

Situated opposite to cc1, this cafe is a nice place to hangout with friends with a cup of coffee or a hookah. The food is also good there just that you have to call them several times for a single order.

Situation exactly opposite to the city centre 1, it does attract a lot of the young crowd for it serving hookah. I did travel up there on valentines day last year and this is supposed to be a very late review. the interiors are pretty dark and it did take me a lot of time to get used  to it

we ordered for the pan salsa hookah and added an oreo shake and kitkat shake to quench our thirst. Overall, it was one nice experience for me personally with my girl out there

One of my favorite place to hangout, Love the ambience of the parlor, quality of hookah and food is also top-notch. Everything was excellent until that day when we bought a coupon from Little to visit the place and that was the last time I went there. Though LCC will always be my favorite hookah parlor😉

Have been here 3-4 times. It's an average place to be. Not bad.  Bang opp. City Center 1.

The food is good. Not bad at all. The hookah is good too. Have had - 

Nachos
Noodles
Green Tea
Darjeeling Tea
Assam Tea
Cold Coffee
Kit Kat Shake

Everything was nice.

The ambience should be worked upon. SHould be more lively. Not saying bright. Dim is okay and nice. But it should be lively. The music here is too loud. Too loud. Plus they ALWAYS play hindi depressing songs.
 I like cozying up in the inner rooms which are WAY WAY better than the outer areas.

Word of Advice - Try making the place more lively and do experiment with the genres of music. And please improve your branding.

This place is good both as a cafe and a hookah lounge. If you just want to grab coffee you could sit in the outside area away from the hookah lounge inside. The food or pretty good so is the music. The service could be better at the cafe. There is barely anyone in the cafe area to take orders. Also most of the times a lot of items on the menu aren't available

Had gone there for my birthday party last year. The place is good and serves a wide array of dishes from different cuisines. The price is moderate, and the service is quite fast. The staff are helpful, and there is a nice, secluded place from the place where they serve hookah which is a big plus point(because I don't smoke or drink). However, I would recommend terminal 11 over Le Coffee Creme.

Tried out my first hookah here!
Just to be safe,  tried out the Paan flavour with ice base. I cant compare it to anything as I've never had that experience before, but it didn't choke me :)
Coming to the food - we ordered chilli baby corn and dry chilli chicken. The baby corn was good. The chicken however, was a tad too dry. I tried out the Evening Sun amongst the mocktails and it tasted like the orange lozenge I've had in my childhood day! Haha!
Liked the ambience though and the staff is very polite - they repeatedly came for feedback after I told them this was my first time trying out hookah!

A groovy and happening cafe situated just opposite to city centre 1 at EC block,salt lake.
Interior design was based on abstract decoration.
Service was average but behaviour of the staffs were humble and courteous.
The food and taste of mocktail was good.
*cheese tortilla non-veg - a preparation of chicken with ketchup and cheese was sandwiched between two tortilla sheets. It was cut into eight pieces. More or less it taste's like pizza
*Limo mojito- an awesome refreshing lime cooler. With mint leaf and pieces of lime.
* darjeeling tea.

First thing abt d place that I did not understand was that why did the word le have an accent aigu (é). Isn't it supposed to b le if it is French? I wud like to know if the word lé exists in any odr language. I came here with some of my cousins on ashtami nd they had a special Durga Puja menu. We tried the hookah, chilli baby corn, fried rice, American chopsey, and corn cheese balls. None of the items I cud say was Grt although hookah was pretty good. We celebrated d birthday of a relative as well nd for Tht we ordered a Choco lava cake..nd it was undoubtedly one of the best. The ambience nd music was also good. I had a great tym with cousins nd d staff did cooperate a lot as I cud see. I hope they cn just improve on d food a little.

Food quality is good with wide range of variety. Ambiance will cheer your mood. The only worst thing is the horrible service..... Which will make you utmost irritated. Looking for some good services in future from much more well mannered trained people. Beside the crew member tip included in the final billing doesn't justify the money.at all.

The staff is very efficient and polite. This place remains crowded for hookah most of the time. Food was served in good quantity rather more than required. Overall nice experience. Do pay a visit.

Visited for the first time. Different seating arrangements for smoking (hookah) and non-smoking is a good option.

Though the outer (cafe styled) seating place was empty, our table was not cleaned after the previous customers left. Another nearby table was in the same condition.

The decor in the cafe is pretty decent. With one side of the room fully covered with posters and the other with mason jars and coffee mugs. Service was polite. Not heavy on the pocket.

Then we enquired about some offfer (like what is included in this offer what we will be getting in starters and drinks) and a guy there named Samsol (or so, that is what he said when I asked his name) answered each of our question in such a wrong way as if he is paying for our food, I wish I could give below 1 rating just for his rude behaviour. We immediately left that place. Ambience "seems" good but this is what we experienced. A big NO for the next time.

Awesome experience. Didn't expect the place to be that good judging from outside. Very cozy, comfortable. They have a projector, nice music light ambience. 
Coming down to food. We ordered a brain freezer Shisha. One mushroom brushetta, chilli mushroom. Green apple and lemon ice tea.
Brushetta was the best thing in the entire meal. Chilli mushrooms were tossed in spice nicely. Properly coated, good amount of stuff inside.
Mushroom brushetta was something I'd wanna have again and again. It was well marinated nicely coated with cheese and proper herbs. Lemon ice tea was very soothing however the green apple was too sweet. Bill was also around 1k. Very convenient and great place to be in.

The café has separate chambers for hookah and non-hookah smokers, with the hookah rooms being larger in size than the non-hookah section. As the hookah provided here is good, it is a chief attraction for youngsters looking for strong hookah and finger food.

Beautiful decor. Disgusting food. Been only to the cafe section, which is almost always deserted (which, in retrospect, should've been a sign). Coffee was a bit overpriced and it didn't deliver on the quality at all. However, since the place was empty, we spent a good 3 hours on a single cup of coffee. Made a second visit to this place recently, since I'm a fan of nicely decorated cafes. But once again the food was equally disappointing. Not going back to this place ever again.

Note : I've only been to the cafe section and not the restaurant or hookah joint. Therefore my review is based only on my experiences at the cafe. The hookah and restaurant section was pretty crowded so quality might be better over there, but the cafe is grossly neglected.

Located opposite city centre1.. A small cafe come hookah parlour. I have been to this place number of times for small meet ups with friends. Honestly didnt like the food much. But today i went there particularly to have chicken cheese fondue after seeing a post on instagram. Along with that i ordered crispy chilli babycorn which again was not upto the mark. Coming to fondue it was really tasty. I mean probably the only dish 1 should order there. The molten cheese along with bread crams and chicken pieces can melt anyone's heart. My ratting would probably be based on this particular item. Coming to service, its good and they indeed serve orders quite fast .

Visited with a few friends on a fine evening. Located opposite to city centre on the main road. Not difficult to find. The customer service is very good, that's what the ratings are up for. The food is average, not as good as expected from such a place. It didn't had the right flavors. The mocktail were lacking flavors too. Maybe they were out of ingredients or something. Hookah was okay... not very great. At your own risk.

The decor was okk. The place looks small when u enter but it has separate rooms so it ain't small.
The service is good.
The quantity served is good and quality is good too. 
The ice tea was served in a glass that seemed larger than a lassi glass and it tasted good too. The garlic bread was well made and best thing you didn't have to ask for small necessary stuff like oregano and stuff. They were served with the food. 
Its a late review so can't explain exactly but I do remember having a good experience so.

Hookah is also okay. Loud music. Prompt service. I expected a bit more cheese in cheese omlet. Sandwich was good. Mocha was normal can be better. Got some egg shell in the omlet which was the disgusting part but they changed the omlet and didn't even charged for the omlet. The behavior of the staffs are very good.

The Chocolate Ultra is something I will surely recommend. Cafe Mocha was not as good as a person with full knowledge about coffees would like to have. Chocolate Crepe was the best of all and one should go for it surely, no second thoughts. 
Coming to the muffins, Black Filter Muffin is basically a coffee muffin with really low sugar. If you're looking for a sweet muffin, this isn't for you at all. 
Mocha Muffin, yes. Go for it.

I dropped by this cafe end of last week. This was my first visit. Located opposite City Centre 1, it was quite easy to locate.

The interiors have been tastefully done with the cafe being divided into sections. I specifically was impressed with Buddha statue and wallpaper with liquor bottle print of the middle section.

We ordered
Fresh lime soda
Crispy chilli babycorn
Pasta Mama Rosa ( mixed sauce)
Chilli paneer gravy
Schezwan Rice
Ice scoops with a sprinkle of nuts

We were a big group and the cafe was quite full initially so we did have an issue with service. But once we communicated this to them the way they made up was amazing. We were attended very well.

Coming to the food we ordered quite many plates of each dish. The taste and quality were superbly maintained.

Full marks to all the main course dishes including the pasta, chilli paneer and schezwan rice. I kept having the pasta till I could eat no more. It was beautifully flavoured.

I would definitely revisit for the tasty food.

Le Coffee Creme is a perfect combination of good food and music. They have a huge Hookah area inside and a small non-hookah area just as you enter where you can't listen to the awesome music playing inside. They serve the best cheese fondue. The only suggestion I have is that if they could expand the non-hookah area and play music there as well.

I heard that they are well knwn for having a good ambience. Am sorry to say i did not find it good. Ita clumpsy and claustrophobic. As the place is claustrophobic we had better ordered for food instead of shisha. 
The pasta pesto tastes good. Though served in less quantity it was filly.
The double cheese sandwich was nothing special. This place must only be called for its position just opposite Cc1

Won't add too much on the interiors as its pretty decent. What I would like to mention about is its service and the Music. Great taste of music. The collection of Music was so exquisite that we didn't feel like getting up from that place. 
Its a cool place to hang out with pals and catch up for hours and so.
Food was pretty okayish.
 Ordered Schezwan Noodles and Chilli Paneer. Really like the noodles but Paneer was just average. Was not spicy at all.
Next was Cheese Tortilla and I really liked the way they had prepared it. The stuffings was spicy and tangy and tasted good.
Would definitely drop visit for their amazing collection of Music.

Well a very popular cafe in saltlake sector one as its bang opposite to the city centre saltlake,     and serves a variety of food,being just a cafe which generally means a variety of coffee,smoothies,muffins and ice creams etc...the cafe is divided into parts for customers who would prefer hookah and those who won't,also may be because the inside is quite darker,with black painted walls,like a different world from the outside to make it apt for shisha...
While from the outside it looks petite as the part other than serving hookah,where one can order food or coffee is a bit congested I feel.

Well the service was fast,we ordered chicken and cheese balls with cheesy dip,as an appetiser as we were there to eat only after a tiring exam,and inspite of being a cafe as it serves variety of continental dishes we gave it a try,so the chicken and cheese ball was just fine I would say as the crispness outside was good,but there was no as such distinctive taste inside,as I had better chicken and cheese balls before,and then we had a chicken tetrazinni baked,which very good,succulent,filled with cheese,perfectly baked spaghetti and tge chicken with melting delicious cheese,the ambience I would say was just okay as the staffs talk.very loudly which is very much audible from where we were sitting and we could here them talking informally with each and placing every orders to the kitchen,so my lower rating is for that only as it was kinda disturbing!!!!

Went near City centre 1 with some official work. Having it done, i wanted to satisfy my apetite with some mouth-watering stuffs. Opened zomato and shortlisted this place. 

Le Coffee Creme  is located just opposite to city centre 1 beside idea store. From outside it may look like a small and just another cafe but inside it has 3 more compartments. So all in all it has 4 sections in total- the outer one is for non smokers and the inner 3 have arrangements for hookah. The middle part is the biggest having a big screen displaying ten sports and with loud music (bit too loud). 

The waiters were extremely decent and cordial. I was asking one of them about the sections and he took me to show each one of the sections and explained everything very nicely which i described in the  para above.

Now the most important part, the food, we ordered a plate of crispy chicken, italian smooch and litchee chili. Crispy chicken had a nice crispy coating with soft tender nicely marinated chicken inside. It was served with an in house dip which tasted superb. Presentation was also appreciable. Among the mocktails italian smooch was much better than litchee chili, which lacked sweetness  and was rather dissapointing. Italian smooch was great. It was one of the best mocktails i ever had. 

Price is pretty high. Bt during the happy hours it would be pocket friendly for sure. 

To conclude i would suggest my foodie friends if u are near city centre 1 u can definitely try this place at least for once.

Nice place to hangout with Frens. Located bang opposite City Centre 1 and hence very easy to locate. Service was good and so was the coffee and the mud pie! Ambience - well this depends on where you are seated. The seating area is divided into 3 different sections. The one on the inside has the most comfortable seating and is the best. This one is for the hookah and could be filled with smoke depending on the time you visit. The one on the outside is for the non hookah smokers and is a little sad. Visit during the happy hours and the discount will ensure that there is no pocket pinch either. Overall - Not bad for some coffee and chit chat!

Went to this place yesterday after a long time, and all I'll say is a really good place to visit to and one would really be satisfied to come here.
Fooding and ambience is really good.
All I'll say is they just need to improve their service a bit otherwise I'd surely give this place a 5/5.
Overall, will definitely be coming back here. Just in love with it's food.👌👍

I love the place.
The food and the ambience, both are equally amazing.
The price of the food items are reasonable and the service is decent as well.
If you love cheese, you must try the chicken cheese fondue. Otherwise, the crispy baby corn and the shakes are pretty awesome too. I have been to almost all the cafés in Kolkata and this one is the best.Anyday.

If you are one of those that have written off Le Coffee Creme as just another little hookah joint or cake shop located opposite City Center 1, I would’nt blame you one bit. Its very easy to undermine the beauty of this place. It looks pretty simple and small from outside, but inside it had 3 other compartments, each very distinctively designed to serve varied purpose.
                                                                ...

Just opposite City Centre 1, this roadside cafe would perhaps entice foodies with its name itself initially with its elegant and funky touch of quaintness. I recently had their mud pie, which is a chocolatey, muddy tart-like pie accompanied with ice cream ; the latter can be eaten separately with or drizzled on top of the pie-tart. As for taste I had expected something encompassing a deep richness of smooth chocolate, but was fairly disappointed as it did not meet my expectations.

Located bang opposite to the kund area of city centre one, this cafe is eggatarian that is it serves veg and eggs and no chicken/fish/meat. We ordered corn salt and pepper and chilly mushroom. The corn was good but the mushroom lacked taste. It was rather smelly. The service was slow. Every time we had to press the call button placed on our table to summon the server.they don't serve you water  and only packaged drinking water is available. Isn't there a law that every restaurant needs to serve water? The decor is good. Since i was meeting an old friend after a long time, all these didn't bother us at that point of time.but won't recommend the place.the prices are standard

"Look! look! The spring is come; O feel the gentle air,
That wanders through the boughs to burst
The thick buds everywhere"
-Robert Bridges.

Yes, you must be wondering what is the clue of making a quote from a poetry in a review of a cafe!!! Well, breaking the conch shell barrier of the stereotyped cafe culture of the modern day cityscape, this is one of those cafe which turned out to be an exception just the way, Bridges differentiated the gentle breeze of the "First Spring Morning" from the prolonged boredom of winter in his country.
Initially it may appear to be a small cramped up 'me too' kind of cafe, until you walk in to take back your words. The psychedelic vibe, the quirky interior and the charming ambience altogether is sure to soothe your soul and let you indulge in to some quite hookah and mocktail drinks while you make your decision to order your food.
The hookah segment is quite enough while the other lounge is a bit loud, playing Hindi songs, which personally I will prefer not to choose.
So far the presentation is concerned, it is genuinely great with good sense of aesthetics. And coming to taste, each and every dish tasted finger licking delicious. To name a few, I must mention the showstopper mocktail 'Italian Smooch', which was FATAFATI. The Caesar salad, the fried chicken, the drumsticks, the special baked fish rice, the mind blowing desserts and all the others, everything tasted fantastic. Hats off to chef Mr. Tanmay for his miraculously good skill of crafting such wonderful dishes.
A fantastic place to spend an evening worth remembering. And worth visiting again and again.
Wishing team "Le coffee cream" all the success in future.

Thanks to

Is it a cafe? Is it a hookah parlor? Is it a European fine dining? Or is it a quirky eatery with bizarre looking rooms? Le Coffee Creme is all, but none exclusively. Its shear diversity took me by surprise! I was expecting a run-of the-mill café, but it had so many more dimensions to offer. From décor, to food completely bowled by their creativity.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:

We have such good as well as fantastic cafes all over the city with all those delicious food, drinks and hookahs. And among them Le Coffee Creme i guess has been one of the topper. Located Opposite to CityCenter 1 at Salt Lake Sector 1, Looks so empty from outside but when you step in you got to see some good crowd of youngsters as well as the elder aged ones who drops down here looking for the best of Le Coffee Creme. Went there for a food tasting session with my friends but didn't expect this place to be so surprising.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:

As said above when you look the place from outside its quite silent and quite but when you step in the front view gives you some great ideas of what you gonna see inside. The decor has been done nicely with all the matching wood work and dim light effects. Sitting arrangement has been in two sections, one is the common one where sofas has been places in a row with table in the front. There's a big Screen on which you can see the IPL matches an extra for your entertainment. Another one is one the cosy side i guess basically for the couples where they can sit have the food and spend some private time with the food and 

hookahs. 
Staffs here are quite friendly and attentive, Service was quite prompt.

FOODS AND BEVERAGES: 

1. Italian Smooch - The Italian smooch really smooched it on my lips. Contained the flavour of Ginger and pudina as well.

2. Brownie Shake - This drink disappointed a little. The name somewhere didn't resembled the drink.

3. Lime Mojito - The flavour of lime was certainly present and can be felt with the soda.

4. Blue Ligand - This was a nice one but melting of the ice couldnt save the fizz till the last sip.

--FOOD--

1. Non-Veg Platter - this platter had everything on the plate. With Prawn Pepper Salt, crispy Chicken and Dums of Heaven. Prawn pepper salt was very good, prawn was tasty enough. Crispy chicken was quite crispy and juicy. Drums of heaven really stole the show on the platter, perfectly marinated and soft.

2. Chicken Lasagne - Chicken Lasagne was brilliant on the other hand, two layers with two different sauces. In between the pasta sheets were cooked and placed nicely. Presentation was also very eye catchy.

3. Chicken BBQ Pizza - The look and presentation was pretty good, but overall an average one. The crust was a bit hard.

4. Special Fish Baked Rice - It was excellent in the first place. The presentation of the dish was very attractive. The flavours and blends were spot on and spicy too.

--DESSERTS--

1. Choco Mud Pie - This looked quite delicious With biscuit been suffed with chocolate and vanilla ice cream been plated on the top. It ended the things with a smile.

2. Choco Wraps - It was a chocolate paradise for the chocolate lover, as i am a chocolate lover so i liked it very much. Chocolate brownie wrapped in between the chocolate with some classy decoration.

With all the dishes were very nice made and equally tasty, i simply liked the chef Mr. Tanmoy's innovative thoughts on the following dishes. Would also like to thanks Tanmoy for having us and giving us such wonderful dishes to try. I wish Le Coffee creme Team all the best and will look ahead to come back again.

Located bang opposite Citi Centre 1, this cafe is a staple for college students.
Predominantly being a hookah place, this cafe still manages to attract non-smokers like me with their cool ambience and delicious food.

I have come here with a group of my smoker friends quite a few times.

The places is really very far with dim lights and loud music. It is divided into three rooms. It remains more or less crowded from noon onwards.

The hookah here is great, my friends say.

I say the mud-pie here is AWESOME.
Basically a chocolate pie served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream with choco sauce drizzled on top. Yum!

Also,do try out their sandwiches and pastas.

P.S.-they serve soft drinks in these really cute jars which is adorable.

Le coffee creme is one of the popular cafe in saltlake area which serves real good food. Trust my words even I was a bit surprised on a my recent visit to this place got to know and taste some lip smacking dishes.

It was an invitation by the Chef Mr. Tanmoy Das for a food tasting event on a Monday evening.

**Location**
Located just near the to city centre 1 Saltlake this shop is bang opposite to the Bikharam shop at the island nearby the mall.

**Ambiance & Decor**
This place has been divided in two parts which is I feel has been done smartly. One is the outer area where there is wooden Decor with cute little chairs and tables as a part of interior where people can enjoy their coffee or food if they don't like the smell or may be darkness which hookah parlours generally has. The other part is a bit dark and low light with an ambiance to enjoy hookah as well as food too. Clever move :)

**Food**
Being a foodie by nature I wasn't expecting so much of variety in their menu which had impressed me on the first place. I had an impression of this being an usual coffee shop with hookah parlour.
My inhibition totally got changed when I started with their mocktails and moved on to their food.
1. Chicken pasta salad:
Wow.. This one is just just a perfect one to start with.. Very well decorated and well made.. MUST TRY

2. Non veg plater : A grand Platter of starters consisted with
i) crispy chicken ii) prawn pepper salt iii) drums of heaven
Was indeed a treat to every taste buds.
Recommended

3. Chicken cheese foundu :
Cutely presented in a ship like crockery with the dish is a treat to your eyes and mouth watering as well.... Cheesy enigma with bread and chicken . Nomnom.... Wow... MUST TRY

4. Chicken Lasagna
Perfect cheesy Lasagna prepared so well that I had to literally asked for some more..RECOMMENDED
5. Pizza chicken BBQ:
Pizza was well made with thin crust base with the generous help of meat and toppings.

6. Special Fish baked rice:
This one was like the knock out punch... Simply amazing..spicy rice with cheese fish is made brilliantly and presented even better. Hats off to Chef..u deserve a clap!!

Desserts:
1. Choco wraps: It's heaven for chocolate lovers brownie wrapped with chocolate sauce is delicious for the sweet tooth.

2. Chocolate Mud pie:
Me being a non chocolate lover like it for the less sweetness even if it had Chocolate into a biscotti with vanilla ice cream on the top.

Both are a MUST TRY ones...

Mocktails
.1.Italian smooch : Best one according to me..
COLA with ginger and lemon with pudina added to it enhanced the level of this.

2 Blue Ligand: Refreshing and cool

3. Lime Mojito : Perfect blend of lime and soda was making it very much energetic.

4.Brownie shake: Heaven for the choco shake lovers. :)

**Service**
Well trained servers made this event a perfect route of satisfaction and happiness. Loved their hospitality and service. Well trained...
Also to mention about their calling gadget which is on of their USP kept in every table for calling for service. Very innovative..

Lastly I would like to thank Mr. Tanmoy for having us with him for the evening and indulge us through such a wonderful food journey. All the best and lots of best wishes !!!
Keep it up :)

Went there yesterday for a food tasting session, and honestly, initially I wasn't expecting much from a café. This happens to be located right in front of City Centre 1, and was very easy to locate for even me, who has zero knowledge of Salt Lake roads. 

Divided into compartments, this place provides hookah but also offers a non hookah area for people who are not too fond of the hookah smell. We tried out quite a few of their mocktails, and the sugar-free version of the Italian Smooch was my favorite. 

The Chicken Pasta Salad was one of the best pasta salads I have had in the city, with generous amounts of dressing. And the Chicken Cheese Fondue was no less. It had skewers of grilled chicken, bell pepper and croutons to be dipped in a white, hot, cheese sauce, and was an instant but amongst all of us.

Next in line was the Non-vegetarian platter with Crispy Fried Chicken, Drums of Heaven and Prawn Pepper Salt. Lot of these three components of the platter, the fried chicken was my favorite, but would have liked the prawns to have been a little more juicy and tender (the size of the prawns were decent, though).

The Chicken Lasagne was amazing, with two layers of meat in two different sauces. The pasta sheets were cooked perfectly, and this was my favorite for the evening. The pizza however, was ordinary. 

Chef Tanmoy had also made his special Fish Baked Rice for us, and it was like a risotto in a pie, and was again, really good.

 The meal ended with two desserts, Chocolate Crepes and Chocolate Mud Pie, and the latter, complete with a dollop of cold ice cream over the warm, gooey pie, tasted as good as it looked. 

 Le Crème Coffee impressed me suitably and scored well above most cafes around. They also have a loyalty card, so I am looking forward to my subsequent visits to this place.

INTRODUCTION
========================================
Le Coffee Creme actually stunned me with its creation of dishes which comes along with exquisite and delicious taste. I can still feel the taste when I am thinking and writing this particular review. From the food to its decor everything seemed perfect. And if someone thinks it to be just a regular cafe, he/she will surely be rectified when they have the food at this place. The quality seemed to be really amazing and better than many proper restaurants in the town. So without wasting much time I just wanna go to the point.

This was an invitation for a food tasting session hosted by the head chef Mr. Tanmay. He had already planned something very special for us with the selection of menu and we came to know that after each and every dish which came before us. Every dish seemed to be something new and special. The magic of cooking had already bamboozled us with every bite we had.

DECOR
========================================
As I entered the place I saw a big Buddha statue with a wall on the left which had some lovely show pieces, books, bottles etc. On one corner there was a gramophone and another wall had some nice photographs all over. It was nice way of decorating. They also have three other sections. The other sections give you a feel of past where the light is dim and a perfect ambience to smoke hookah. The ambience proved to be stunner.

THE BEST PART
=======================================
Yeah, the best part for a foodie will always be food. We were lucky to have some delicious food and drinks. So without much delay here they are:

Mocktails & Shakes
---------------------------------
#Blue Lagoon : The presentation and the colour impressed first and then the taste took all the credit away. The blue lagoon gave a nice start.

#Summer Sip : A mango flavoured drink which was nice but not as good as the first one. I couldn't say much because the first one took the level of expectation to another height.

#Watermelon Mojito : This was another drink we all wanted some more. A real energiser in this summer.

#Peach Iced Tea: The peach flavoured ice tea was good as well but somewhere I could not say "Wow" for this drink.

#Ginger Lime Mojito : One of my favourite drink of the afternoon. The taste of ginger and lime was just complimenting each other superbly. This drink was just "WOW".

#Choclolate Shake: Thick chocolaty shake with the perfect amount of sweetness which will make you fall for this. The chocolate shake was a hit.

#Italian Smooch : The Italian Smooch took my heart away. I couldn't find what exactly they had used to make the drink, but it was pure magic.

Salad
----------
#Chicken Roasted Salad: With the mocktails being amazing the expectations were already high and it lived up to its expectation. It was made with Chicken and Mushrooms and veggies served with nachos. The presentation
and garnishing was as good as its taste.

#Main Coarse
-----------------------
#The Combo: This platter had a combo of three things:
*** Crispy Chicken : Crispy outside, tender and juicy inside. This was good in taste but a little more dry.

*** Fish & Chips : The fish fry was once again really good served with French fries. I loved it.

***Crispy Chilli Babycorn: The Babycorn failed to impressed as it was just the basic babycorn which we regularly have. Nothing special in it.

The presentation was once again great.

#Pasta Alfredo : The Alfredo Pasta rocked me again with its taste. The taste was great with the chef's special touch in it making it much more delicious.

#Chicken Steak : This had rice with veggies, smashed potato, steaked chicken, salad and an awesome steak sauce. Absolutely great.

#Chef's Special Baked Rice : When this came I just thought for a while if all other dishes were so good what could be the chef's special taste like. And when I had my first bite I got my answer.
I just can't describe this recipe much. Just try it once and you wont regret I bet. A truly special one from Tanmay.

Desserts
--------------
#Choco Mudpie : This came in a tart base with chocolate layer all over it and served with ice cream. The desserts were the final touch to the wonderful food fest.

#Special chocolate Crape: As it is said the best is served at last. This turned out to be one of the best dessert i have had. The end of the food fest was great with this.

LAST WORDS
========================================
I could hardly find any flaw even after thinking about it twice as i had to write. Mr. Tanmay did a great job with his team. Their signature dishes need some time and if you really wanna taste something unique and great its worth your time. This place is a definite recommendation from my side.

4.5/5 is what they deserve

A great time spent with

Bang opposite to CC1, this place has great ambience and is very very cosy. A lovely place to cool down. If you are two guys, choose the outermost room and chill. If you are with gang of gals or guys or want to enjoy hukaah lonely, choose the 2nd part. Cosy sofas with loud music and projection screen perfect for halla bol . If you are with your bf or gf choose the innermost room. Low volumed music extremely cosy sitting..enough to chill your dil. Talking about munching, we went for their recommendations Crispy Chicken with BBQ Sauce...finger licking good it was. Peach and watermelon flavored Iced tea was something very very sweet...was not like lightly flavored regular ice tea. I didn't like it too much. If it was less sweetened, it could have been great.
There it was written that happy hours gives you 20% discount. Though we finished well before 4, they delayed the bill to get it passed just 4 pm. Thus avoided the discount. Tackled them very rationally as the card punching machine showed 3:54 pm...and bagged a 15% discount. I care a hang about Rs.60, but had to play a bit as they were in mood to play a lil game.

Located just opposite city centre, salt lake on the side where the metro flyover work is going on. We went there today early at 11 a.m. while returning from college for a quick bite.The cafe had just pulled its shutter up. Though it is a hookah bar, I was actually searching for a place where crepes were available in reasonable prices. This place was one. The service took a little time,maybe because it had just opened for the day but we were offered seats on comfortable sofas so it was not a bother. Also it was nicely air conditioned and well decorated with antiques. Coming to the food, we ordered one honey butter crepe and one cheese mushroom crepe- contrasting tastes! They were quite delicious. While I ended up liking the mushroom cheese more, my friend preferred the honey butter one. They are also offering a discount of 15 or 20 percent from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. till 31st may, which basically means they r not charging the tax during that time. Overall,a nice ambience with reasonable price.

A pack of 5stars for Le Coffee Créme. Zomato has not yet been updated with their recent Non-Veg items menu. For some out-of-the-world and really-something-fishy reasons, they don't tend to show their non veg menu willingly. You are provided with one, only if you ask for it. 
We had a stunning experience at this little joint. Apparently it seems to be a regular cafe, but once you step in... they have lot more to offer. Their hookahs are satisfactory and comes with decent varieties of flavours. The food is brilliant! They have a starter combo pack where one can order 3 different types of starters ( 2 chicken and 1 fish) of one's own choice at just 440/- ... We went for 2 rounds of starter combos, and hence if roughly sketched, we almost had 2 dishes for free!!!!
Sounds absurd? Yeah.. that's how it is. Absurdly wonderful. The portions were perfect for 2 heavy eaters. Cooked well... served decorously. Very pleased with everything. Must visit for all. :-) Even if you don't like loud music and hookah, the place is two-faced and can give you a decent cafe ambience too!!
Special Recommendations : Fish and Chips, Chicken and Cheese Balls, Classic Fish Fingers and Cola Float. Their tartar and cheese dips taste beautiful!

I go to this place occasionally with friends.  Good place to hang out with frnds.  Perhaps the best ambience among all other hookah places.  They have separate place for hookah and coffee although u could order anything from the hookah lounge .  Much better than aqua java.  Pricing is also reasonable

Me and my friend spotted this place on our visit to CC1. It's right opposite to the mall. Since Afra Deli was crowded so we thought of sipping in some coffee at this place. I wasn't aware that this place served hukka as well. 
The moment you enter this place you will get a strong smell of the hukka flavours. Though the management has made two separate places on the same floor. The hukka lounge is behind and the cafe sort of thing is outside. But this place is very noisy. The moment the waiters open the door to get into the hukka lounge the cafe gets filled with noise. It's a place full of teenagers, for the reason the music is very loud. 
These people have a electronic bell sort of thing fixed on each of the tables. Once you are ready with order you can press the button and then the waiter arrives and takes down your order. This system seemed quite advanced and time saving.
The ambience was average and the service was good.
The quality of food was average. Nothing was out of the way. The plating seemed quite poor.
We had ordered for the below items:
•Cold Coffee - The cold coffee was really amazing. The blend and the flavours were just perfect. Must try.
•Lemonade with a twist - This was nothing but masala cold drink. A lot of jaljeera was added to coke with a dash of lime in it. This drink was refreshing but nothing that great.
* Cheese Fondu - This dish had nachos and baguette served with a cheese dip. Wasn't that amazing though. The dish was very dry to the mouth.

Overall this place is average. One can go for a cup of coffee. But this place is a bit loud. For the reason I won't prefer it next time.

This was my first time for a dine-in here, although I have ordered for take-away's once or twice before. This particular cafe has earned a lot of fame and reputation and manages to attract a fair share of the young crowd, considering the fact that Salt Lake has recently seen a number of similar upstarts catering to cafe which serves Hookkah!

Located bang opposite to City Center-I, Salt Lake, almost opposite to the entrance point of 2 wheeler and 4 wheeler vehicles into the City Center Parking Lot, the outside of this cafe isn't much overwhelming. It pretty much looks like a standard outlet. However, as soon as you pay attention and enter the cafe, you realise how wonderful the decor and ambiance is. Right in front of you would be a statue of Buddha in a meditating state. The walls are beautifully filled up with photo frames, almost as if they are kept abruptly and stacked beside one another. There are also horizontal racks upon which books and empty bottles of champagne/wine are kept. On one portion, there is a beautifully vertical arrangement of stacks, which houses cups kept upon a plate, with one just beneath/above one abother! The sitting arrangement is decent comprising of wooden chairs and tables.

There is a separate section inside which caters to people who wants to smoke Hookkah! As you pull open the door, and enter the Hookkah section, right in front of you would be a big hall, almost like the sitting and dining area of the 1st floor of a building. There is a wonderful and large LCD/LED TV stuck to the wall, which people can enjoy themselves! There are also 2 small rooms to the left. The sitting area inside is more comfortable comprising of soft sofas. These are very comfortable to sit upon and gives you utmost pleasure and relaxations!

Coming to the food, I ordered for Chicken and Cheese Balls with Cheese Sauce and a Vanilla Thandai (Holi Special). The C&C Balls were nothing extraordinary. 7-8 medium sized balls similar to that of Chicken popcorn. The chicken was rather stiff and not exactly melting inside the mouth. The salt sprinkled was a tad bit more, but the dish wasn't exactly discomforting. Accompanying this, I ordered for a Vanilla Thandai. Initially, I wanted to order a Butterscotch one, but the person attending me suggested Vanilla. The thandai was wonderfully refreshing. Light, yet not exactly watery, it went very well with the C&C Balls. The quantity was more than sufficient, probably around 300-350 ml. It took me some time to finish that off! 

Coming to the cons, I would have prefered a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream inside the thandai, so that it could thicken up the consistency and also maintain it with time. The Cheesy Sauce was watery and made a mockery of the entire dish. If anyone is listening, kindly replace it with proper Cheese Dip. Apart from these, I had earlier ordered for BBQ Chicken Pizza which I found to be extremely tasty and delicious. The sauce was just perfect complimented well the thin crust. 

The C&C Balls were probably priced at Rs. 180-190/-, similar to Crepes. Considering the size of the balls, it was surely overpriced. The Thandai was priced at Rs. 170/-. The total bill, including taxes came to 490/-, which means overall tax of 36%, which again sounds a bit extravagant!

Considering the ambiance, comfort, and food quality, this probably deserves 1-2 times visit in a month! But, if they truly want to settle down and attract more people, they surely needs to cut down on their prices!

There are so many options for cafe nowadays in our city of foodies . But there comes the option of variety . If a cafe gives you an option of grabbing a quick snack or go for a whole hearted meal or go in with a group and enjoy hookah with loud music you gotta admire their efforts . Le Coffee Creme is a " big shot " joint these days with already so many options available . Located opposite city centre 1 this joint has an advantage of location . If you are with your dear one and looking for a quick bite this should be within your top 3 choices . We were looking for the same and Le Coffee Creme was the first thing in our mind .

Ambience is not bad for couple seating . The cafe portion is located first followed by a door to the hookah section . The seating is cosy but the loud music from the hookah section will tend to bother you a little .

Now speaking about the food, we were more than satisfied . we ordered : -

1. Spanish omelete ( 3 / 5 )
2. Pasta chicken arrabiata ( 4 / 5 )
3. Mud pie ( 4.5 / 5 )

This place has good pastas . Although the. Spanish omelete was very ordinary, the pasta light us up . The pasta had a rich spicy sauce which went excellent with the chicken pieces and corn. The quantity was good .

The mud pie is a must try . The inside is spoiled with hot chocolate cake and topper with ice cream , this delightful piece of delicacy is sure to end your feast on a high note .

My best wishes to the team and will visit again surely when we are around .

We had about three quarters of an hour left with us for a neerja show, when we decided to check out this cafe bang opposite to city centre. The interior space is sectioned in 2-3 parts, out of which the outer area was non hookah zone with table chair seatings in cafe style , while the hookah zones  had couches and loud music but lacked proper illumination.

The servers greeted us warmly ,took down our orderlist and as promised delivered the entire array in such short time. Therefore full marks on time efficiency.

We had
Mojito
Lemon ice tea
Cream of chicken soup
Crispy chilli babycorn
Drums of heaven
Chicken Penne alfredo
Spaghetti aglio olio
Chicken ala king
Mudpie.

Their chef is doing a wonderful job, the food was near perfect, bursting with individual flavours and quality ingredients , just that the soup was runny in consistency. I loved the mojito, the other drink was good enough too.

My best wishes for Le Coffee Creme :)

It is hard to describe how bad our experience was. We had a Nearbuy voucher and visited them today at lunch time. The place was more or less empty. The hookah free place had a faulty AC and it was rather warm.
I wish there was one good dish I could recommend.

The nachos looked extremely unappetizing, as if they had run out of cheese and had to simply sprinkle a little cheese sauce on it.

Then came the Fried Chicken, if one can call it that. Couldn't eat more than one. I'll attach a picture, judge for yourself. It is basically chicken coated in burnt cornflakes.

Then came the Chicken Pasta, too much salt and plain weird. Chicken a La King was basically an extension of the Pasta. Exact same sauce, and just not good. We had ordered Herb Rice too and it was a life saver; it needed very little cooking. It didn't have much flavour, but at that point I would've preferred plain steamed rice without any sides just to get rid of the taste of everything else.

Dessert was Mud Pie. There was a layer of oil floating above the chocolate. I gave up at that point. I can't even continue writing anymore.

Never going back. Actually taking a break from eating out for a few days, need to recover.

Though i have always liked the food here the service has never been upto the mark. So much so that i had gone with the Groupon vouchers once and they refused to honor the deal stating that i had not made prior reservations for the same even when the whole cafe was empty. Even before it has always taken them alot of time to serve the food though the hookah comes pretty fast. They deserve just a '1' and the extra '.5' is solely for the food. The staff has always tried denying any offer in any way they can by putting some pre-requisites and conditions. This is not the way to go. The manager is always really polite and courteous. Thumbs up for that but never there when needed.

The place was too good, well decorated, and the lighting was dim which made the atmosphere best to have hookah :)
Music played was also good..
Food: ordered Chinese fried chicken, hakka  noodles and chilly babycorn and taste of all the dishes were great.
The guys were really very good but the  service time can be improved a little so that customer should not wait for anything for a longer time.
price is also not much.
Overall experience at this place was really good :)

Location : Bang opposite City Centre I.

This café has grown pretty much popular now in the Salt Lake area. With no better rivalry around, it has flourished and attracts teenagers who come at the mall for a shopping spree. The frontier of the outlet is an entirety out of glass. So the first section has been curated to resemble a complacent café, where you can sip on coffee whilst enjoying the city landscape. The rest of the place is divided into other 3 sections, all of which are shisha dens. Overall the crowd is good and the ambience is okayish.

The food here is delectable. And can beat any café in its terms.
★    Man Chow Soup : This was really spicy and that’s a good thing as it is meant to be. The element of sour and spice balance in Chinese cuisines is immensely relevant, which was precisely maintained.

★    Crispy Chilli Babycorn : Little can go wrong with this dish, only if certain points are kept in mind. Here they covered all the major areas except that it lacked a little tang. Might be because of over cooking.

★    Penne Pasta : We had ordered both White and Mixed sauce pastas. Both of these were excellent to taste with nice assorted vegetables added to each. The quantities were also sufficient.

★    Dumpling Manchurian & Chilli Garlic Noodles : Tremendously soft vegetable dumpling in classic Manchurian sauce were literally too good. Having them with chilli garlic noodles yet again resulted in a brilliant combination.

★    Mud Pie & Brownie : It was just awesome. Probably the best dessert I have had in recent times. Soft pie immersed in chocolate sauce was above everything else. The brownie too was pretty nice but somewhat stiff. Could have been softer had it been a little warmer.

★    Iced Tea : It had nothing to detail about. Pretty much normal. Would not recommend it.

★    Shisha : We ordered Hariyana Mix and Paanch Paan. The hookahs were prepared alright with the flavours coming outright.  The smoke was a little low on density. The duration was also a bit less.

All in all a great experience. The service is quick. Pocket pinch is low, specially if you visit in between 11am-4pm when they offer a discount of 15%.

Very nice interiors,good ambience,nice music and courteous staffs. We took a sisha the haryanvi mix i think the name was and along with it fried chicken in bbq sauce and shredded chilli chicken. The bbq chicken was amazing..crunchy and juice all at the same time but the shredded chicken was bit too spicy for my liking.
The price came around 1000/-. Overall nice place to hangout with a group of likeminded people .

I have visited this place three times and have not been unsatisfied. They offer a nice selection of beverages and their food is good. I would recommend ordering the stuffed mushroom and cheese fondue for starters. I have tried their version of chicken tetrazzini and risotto and they were good as well. What stood out was their chicken and cheese crepe. It was just amazing. Chicken and cheese balls are also very good to taste. I did not like the pizza that much though. Overall this is one of those restaurants which I would love to visit again and again and not get bored.

The first thing to be said about this place is the decor. Folks, from outside, you'll feel it's the smallest place in the world, but, it has three stages inside it and only the first stage is visible from the outside. Three stages has three types of decor and ambiance and light. Looks very expensive and premium. Nice and classy place to hang out with friends. The food is nice but the waiters attended quite late

*Ferero rocher shake - well, with that name do u think anything can go wrong? Haha... Ferero shakes are always good everywhere and its safe if ur not on for experimenting...
Food:
*Corn cheese balls - pretty good
*Crispy baby corn - its OK.. Not great nor bad...
*Cheezee blast pizza - it was OK too...
*Cheese fondue - probably the worst I ever had...it was bad

Now comes to the decor...its prety well made..they've got 3 sections which was prety nice in itself...like the way all 3 sections are divided.. Cozy nice place to hangout with frnds or with ur partner...

All the items are not available all the time, thats an issue i'v faced all the time...hope they keep the food and drinks well stocked...

Nice place both for hookah and food.. The Hookah was nice.. And for the food we ordered dry chilli chicken, chicken shezwan noodles and chicken hakka noodles.. Each and every dish was perfectly made and was delicious.. Specially the dry chilli chicken is a must try the chickens were too soft and was yummilicious..

Went in the joint for a relaxing evening. Had heard a lot about the hookah, so ordered one along with chicken nachos.
The chicken nacho was very well prepared with good quantity of salsa dip but the hookah was too strong making me cough up with every puff. The ambience was great with good choice of music rolling out. The staff was humble and the service quick. Would return again but for the food not hookah.

I have never come across a food joint/cafe which charges a donation amount on the bill. The donation is mentioned 'Crew Donation Amt.'. When asked, they said it is for orphan children support. Imagine for doing a donation they charge it from the customer for serving food. The AC in the cafe dont work & an easy reply comes that 'its not working'. The cold coffee served are average & the container look like jars with lid open. The only good thing about the cafe is it is situated in a wonderful location opposite City Center, Salt Lake.

On my last visit I tried the chicken nachos. Service is good and the staff is very courteous.

Been on my wishlist for some time now, having exhausted all options in salt lake area which serves good shisha along with decent food and ambience we decided to pay this place a visit.

INTERIORS AND AMBIENCE : The café has two areas, one serves hookah and the other non hookah. Comfy, sofas and cushions accomodate the hookah area with plastic decorations on the wall. Plastic chairs adorn the non hookah area. The ambience takes you by the ease and makes you instantly comfortable. AC cooled to the perfect rook temperature.           
                                                      
FOOD : We ordered royal pan masala in shisha and make your own pizza. Both were excellent. The hookah was a bit on the stronger side though. You'll enjoy it after a while. The pizza deserves a special mention. One of the finest pizzas That is served in hookah cum food parlours. 

Service : Decent. Staff were courteous. No complaints. 

MUSIC : They have a really really good collection of music and it'll get you grooving within minutes. 

Pocket pinch : 650 for two. Doesn't leave a hole in the pocket. 

Worth a visit.

A very beautifully decorated place, has the perfect ambience to chat for hours while satisfying your taste buds. Since they have two separate places for hookah and non hookah people, it makes a perfect go-to zone for those who aren't fancy of hookah. Love the food, amazing service as well and not very heavy on the pocket as well !

The service is overall good but little delay in serving the food. I had been here with my friends. We ordered pasta, sandwiches and baby corn with hookah and fresh lime soda. Food quality is amazing and food was super yummy. 😘

This place is located just opposite salt lake city centre. It doesn't look like a hookah parlour by any means from outside. But one u get in u'll find a door on the right and once in there its totally a different place! There are three to four rooms altogether i fo not remember how many. U may sit in a room with low temperature or high(which doesn't have a ac only the door is opened which makes the room fairly cool bt nt too much). The waiters are very well behaved. Food is excellent too. And last but not the least , radr the most important point, hookah served here beats all. Thats all i could say. :)

At this place, who cares about your choice? What you want?
Screw it sir! Im telling you the other one is better and I'll order that for you, the one you're telling, even though you've tried it will be awful -_-
They charge 80 for a glass of coke.
Service sucks.
Average hookah.
Adda for waiters, who cares about proper service?!

Water had to be asked more than twice and there was no re-fuelling of water on their own. Beverages were served after finishing the food. Pizza base was uncooked.

The outlet is located opposite CC saltlake and I had been noticing it for a year now but never managed to get in. Last week however i finally took the plunge. It has 3 sections, first the non smoking/hookah area then a open theatre like area with smoking and one more room tiny closed room inside again open to hookah. We were seated in the last room. The outlet plays decently loud music which makes conversation difficult so everyone keeps talking loudly but then at intervals the music suddenly stops creating one of the many awkard moments where u suddenly realise u r screaming! To call the waiters the table had a wireless bell (kinda like airplanes) which was a smart thing to do given that the music is always loud. All hookah places tend to thrive on dark dingy settings and this outlet is no different. I was pleasantly surprised by the food though. Had the crispy chilly babycorn which was delicious. It was both saucy and crispy a combination rarely found. We also had the crispy chicken which was served with a dip. It was again very good and the quantity was also wow. The only ket down was the corn cheese balls which barely had cheese and had a filling of mashed corn served with coconut chutney (why on earth would they do that!). A better dip/sauce could have still saved the dish. For drinks we ordered the lime ginger mojito, watermelon mojito and oreo shake . All tasted really good with the watermelon mojito standing out as the winner. Overall a good place which could do a lil better with slightly better ambience and space ( the room we were seated in was very very cramped). I will visit again soon for trying other interesting menu options soon.

Location: Opposite City Centre 1.

Le Coffee Creme is a fairly spaced out café which is divided into a couple of sections including a non-smoking one and can easily accommodate up to forty heads in total. About the AMBIANCE, one would like the first look of the place thanks to the wood paneling work with picture frames hung along the walls. It speaks calmness in a polite manner. On entering the smoking section, the dim lighting invites to a more chilled out environment where one could unwind to the nice selection of music and projected visuals. People looking out for a silent undisturbed chat could move further and settle themselves in the other section which is also dimly lit but, has no music (speakers located in the room are connected to the already playing music only on request).

Talking about the FOOD, this place has a wide variety to offer and the quality is commendable. The following has been sampled until date:

- Mexican Nachos
Herbed tortilla chips (Brand: Cornitos; Flavor; Jalapeno & Herbs) served along with a cheese dip and tangy salsa dip. Tasted good.

- Pasta Mama Rosa (Mixed Sauce Pasta)
Perfectly boiled pasta (penne) tossed in a balanced mix of arrabiata (red) & bechamel (white) sauce along with fresh sautéed veggies. Served with a slice of garlic bread on the side. The pasta tasted delicious and the bread had a subtle garlic flavor. Wish it was served with a topping of grated cheese, would have added as a plus.

- Corn Cheese Crepe
Nicely done all-purpose-flour rounds (roti) stuffed with steamed kernels of american sweet corn mixed with cheesy sauce and served with a generous topping of melted cheese and crushed pieces of nachos/tortilla chips. Tortilla Chips on the side crunchily complimented the soft bites of the crepe. Oh so cheesy it was. Delicious it was.

- Chilli Garlic Noodles
Perfectly boiled noodles unevenly tossed along with fresh veggies, sautéed garlic pods and spot-on seasoning. Tasted good but, was slightly oily.

- Chilli Garlic Paneer (Dry)
Fried Cottage Cheese cubes tossed along with freshly diced onion & capsicum in shezwan sauce. The sauce was slightly sweet in nature along with an underlying spice flavor. Served with a sprinkle of chopped spring onion. Did taste nice. Has scope of improvement.

• The SHEESHA was found to be smoky and long lasting on all visits.

The SERVICE was found to be quick by the polite and well-informed STAFF.
PRICES were found to be inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall has been a good experience.

I loved the wraps , crepes , the chilli garlic noodles and the chicken manchurian. Even the brownies and muffins were splendid and perfectly baked and of course my caramel latte.Only dampner is the time taken to serve the food , that leaves some room to improvement.

Nice place to go and have a quick chat with friends. Also, among a few places in Kolkata where you can get Hukka. The interiors is nicely decorated. Mostly a couple place. Dark and cozy adds to the couple charm as well. Decently priced, not too expensive, or too cheap. An ideal evening would cost 600 - 700 bucks. Recommended place to visit. Cheers !!

Its a wonderful place near City Center One... It is just opposite to "Bikharam", so one can easily find it out.. Great ambiance.. Moreover it is beautified by its lovely décor.. Crafted wall Lamps, cozyyyy sofa, guiter, London Wall clock etc add a magic to this place along with good music.. Let's come to the Sheesha and food.. Pan rasna was good enough.. Served well.. Tried their Mushroom Pizza with cheese toppings... That was soooo delicious, solo mouthwatering... Thin crust base, on the top lots of tender mushrooms, olives, onions... Tastes solo good... I should strongly recommend all to try this... Wonderful place.. The only negative point is that, they still use bill book, not e-bill... So it is a bit doubtful about the service tax or vat, they charge..so confirm before leaving..

A French name, a cafe bang opposite the most popular City Centre Salt Lake and if it's French its romance hence the existence of Le Coffee Creme.

I love this place for the wonderful memories it has given me. I met the love of my life for the first time here and ironically our last happy moment was at Le Coffee Creme as well.

Barring the melodrama, what brings me back here apart from the stone throw distance from my place is their hookah, green tea and crispy chilli baby corn. 

I was pleasantly surprised on seeing an additional non vegetarian menu, however the miniscule size of their sandwiches need major rework. Also might I suggest them serving an additional mayo/ cheese dip for those ordering just french fries. Ketchup and Mustard dips aren't good enough for the price charged. 

My friends have also complained about their fish and chips. Apparently the fish has a stink despite being beer batter fried and a tangy after effect.

Another heads up. The credit/debit card swipe machines may not detect your transaction many a time since airtel servers are weak inside the cafe and you may have to run to the nearest ATM. So always keep your Wad fat at all times.

We ordered Cafe Mocha and Cappuchino..the waiter disappeared after taking our order..after sometime we were served the coffee..they were tasteless..the waiter told us he can give us some more coffee powder or sugar if we wanted.

The outlet is an expensive one with no experience at making coffee..visit at your own risk.

Nice but limited.. Need to upgrade themselves with better menu card.. Second time was just for hookah and it was OK.. You have to use the premium locational advantage and add more value to it.. Otherwise, for small eats it is found to  be a little more OK than other !!

Le Coffee Creme is bang opposite City Centre and will always have a special place in my heart, for I chanced upon this place on a first date. It serves hookah in a separate area and the outer sitting area is a regular cafe, done up tastefully with wood panel walls, a Buddha waterfall
, a gramophone, colorful posters and candles. 

The restaurant serves Asian, Mexican, Italian and Continental fare, and I must say that I was rather surprised by the quality of food. The service used to be a tad slow in the outer area because the servers used to be inside, but they've installed a ringer on every table. :)

I absolutely LOVE the Jalapeno Cheese Poppers, the Cheese Triangles, the Spaghetti Aglio Olio, Penne in Pesto Sauce, the Crostini and the Chocolate Crepe here. I've definitely tried more than half of their menu, on my numerous visits, but I've listed my absolute favorites. The Nachos, Cheese Poppers and Cheese Triangles are amazingly cheesy and the latter two are served with a cheese dip. They use fresh ingredients and are selective about  it-- for instance, when it comes to cheese, they use Mozzarella in Cheese Triangles and Cheddar in the Poppers, each adding a unique flavor. 

The pastas are all delicious and a special mention to the Chocolate Crepe, which has crumbled brownie inside, chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. I'm not very fond of their chocolate shakes and its variants- they are good, nothing extraordinary. 

I was really craving Banana Milkshake one day, and it wasn't on their menu and I expressed my wish to the server, who, within 15 minutes, bought bananas from the fruit vendor and blended me a shake as per my preference. Speaks volumes about the service!! :)

I would say that the portion sizes are neither big, nor too small, but the quality is amazing and the staff is extremely courteous, well mannered and helpful! A big shout out to you guys! 
  
So, the ratings for Le Coffee Creme would be as follows: 

AMBIENCE: 4/5

FOOD: 4.5/5 (+ 0.5 for presentation!) 

SERVICE: 4.75/5

VALUE FOR MONEY: 4.25/5

PS- I also LOVE the Chocolate Mud Pie.

Opposite to city centre, this place serves quality hookah, food and drinks and also a chilled out ambiance for youngsters. the interiors are well done and there is a lot of space inside which might not seem so from outside. We had crispy chicken in bbq sauce, cold coffee, jalapeno poppers and hawaiin pizza. Everything was well done and it didn't take much time to serve. For people who do not like hookah, well the place becomes quite smoky owing to its hookah customers and if you don't like it , you might not like the place. For hookah lovers, my friends said they serve good hookah and the people know how to blend it! I like to visit for their good food!

Located just beside city centre1, lé coffee créme offers not only great interiors but also delicious food! The entire place is divided into 3 zones, cool decor, great music, screening of sports, hookah and awesome food. Had tried their lemon ice tea, veg cheese crepe, pesto chicken pizza and chicken lasagne, and all of them were absolutely spot on!

If you are not a hookah fan, and you are just looking to have food and beverages, then this is not the place to be. The staff does not care about the people outside the hookah zone. They have some sort of "press the button" system to call the staff, and they won't come unless you've pressed it over 4-5 times. I was craving for Lasagna and i looked this place up. Idk if lasagna is that bad to taste but it tasted absolutely rubbish. The coffee we ordered was not upto the mark either and the shakes had huge amount of sugar mixed in them. Bad first experience. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

My first visit & was very satisfied. Bang Opposite to City Centre 1,perfect location to meet up with friends or spend a spontaneous evening with your loved one while avoiding the rush at CC1. The Hookah lounge is inside while there is cafeteria like sitting on the outside giving one the option of choosing. The Hookah lounge has bit of loud music, so if are up for a conversation or adda its better to choose the outside sitting.
We ordered cream of chicken soup & manchow soup. The cream of chicken soup deserves special mention. It was perfect for the drenched evening. The manchow soup was average. 
In starters we had Cheese triangle & crispy chicken. If one has slightest liking for chesse,please do try the cheese triangles. With perfect crispy batter & melt in mouth cheese filling,it tasted heaven for a cheese lover like mine!! For the crispy chicken,the chicken was very soft & well-cooked but the batter was pretty bland & tasteless,would not recommend.
We went ahead to order pasta aglio & chili garlic chicken noodles with chilli chicken. The pasta aglio had a bit too much of garlic. Though this was my first tasting of pasta aglio,thus cannot comment if it is made that way or the chef got overzealous!! The noodles was average. The Chilli chicken was very good!! The gravy itself tasted so good alongwith the chicken which had the perfect softness. No overdose of batter,not too heavy gravy...just perfect!!

The star of the evening revealed itself in the last part in the form mudpie!! We ordered mudpie & chocholate sundae. The sundae was good. The mudpie was awesome. I ended up having 2!! It was perfect melt-in-mouth heaven for people with a sweet tooth like me!! 

The service was a bit on the slower side.Though service was very organised & we didnt have to wait too much between. Liked the well lit decor.

Continuing on my home-alone streak, I decided on this place for filling myself up in the afternoon. It was my second visit here. It's located opposite the City Centre kund area on Salt Lake 3rd avenue and is pretty easy to find.

I love the outer room of this place. It is well lit. I believe there is a lot of place on the inside as well, but then the lighting is mellow there and it is preferable if you wish to indulge in hookah. Also, the inner rooms have loud upbeat music, so if you wish to converse, it is better to choose the outer room. Coming back to the outer room, its USPs are an entire wall full of frames from around the world. Frames of cafes and hang-out places. It infuses life into the room. And then there is this statue of Buddha that is there. It gives a calm feel to the room. The ceiling has nice hanging lamp shades and there is a gramaphone replica placed on the reception counter. Also they have these novel (for me) tissue paper holders that have a call button to call for the stewards.

Now coming to the food. They have a large spread on offer, for all day dining. There are pizzas, sandwiches, various kinds of hot and cold drinks and dishes to fill you up as well. The menu spread over two books, is not properly organised and is haphazard with various similar dishes placed far apart. The last time I was here, they had only vegetarian dishes to offer, now there are non-veg dishes too. I settled for the Pasta Tetrazzini as the filler and home made chocolate brownie as the sweet after-taste.

The pasta was a spaghetti dish baked with bell peppers and carrot in a cheese sauce with parsley. It was served really hot, flavoured nicely and tasted good, with the cheese being just perfect. It was served with a hard toasted garlic bread and chilly flakes and oregano for seasoning. The garlic bread (if it was that) was a put off. It was hard and not crispy and seemed as if a usual toast was warmed with some flavoured butter. Coming to the dessert, it was served with ice cream atop the hot walnut brownie and chocolate sauce. It was presented well. The sweetness of the brownie was just perfect, but I would have preferred it being a bit coarser, it was very fine textured. The ice cream was a bit watery rather than being creamy. The food was good, but the portion size of the pasta was small, it just filled me up.

Coming to the service, it was not up to the mark. The stewards were inattentive. The water served was unclear and needed replacement. Food was served at a moderate pace. The menu presented was in tattered condition and was a put off. They have such a beautiful decor but it needs to be maintained. The air-conditioning in the outer room was leaking, and incidentally it had been so the last time (which is almost a year back) as well. The lamp shades are beautiful, but then they need to glow to add to the beauty. The management does need to look into these matters.

Overall it was a moderate experience. The prices are moderate, higher if you consider the overall experience. I go for the median rating. The decor and food may beckon me again to this place but they do need to pull up their socks on many counts.

Happy eating!!

Left Coffee Creme is located opposite to City Center 1 facing Chowrasia to be precise. Most won't be able to imagine how beautiful it is from the exteriors but once you enter, you'll get to see the vibrant décor. A great place to catch up with up friends anytime of the day.

It's reasonably priced and serves good quality items. The menu has lots of options to chose from and has something for everyone.

How do you give negative points here?
A friend and I dropped by for coffee. While she ordered a masala chai, I went for a caramel latte. 
Big mistakes. 
The friend began having stomach cramps almost immediately after she'd had the tea-bag-in-milk concoction. 
I was, however, luckier. I had time till I got back home for the cramps to begin. 
The service was poor (had to spell things out before the order was understood), though the decor was nice. 
But seriously, how do you give negative points here?

This place gave one of the best experiences I've had so far. I had a non-veg Groupon, and redeemed it last week to great satisfaction. For me, it ticked all the right boxes. 

☆Ambience- It's quite good. We sat in the hookah section with blue lights. Even their dining area is quite cosy and classy. Next time, I'll try their inner rooms which have yellow lighting. Music was quite pleasant; they don't repeat songs and it wasn't too loud. 

☆Service- Absolutely top-notch. They were very attentive to our needs and served everything just when we wanted them. They cancelled the soup on request, after we places the order. Not only were they polite, but also quite friendly. They threw in a bit of coal for free to keep our hookah going, and even enquired about our
meal at the end. Definitely more than one expects from a cafe! Would say this was their usp, had it not been for the amazing food.              

☆Food- We had a Groupon, but we decided to go without the soup and that turned out to be a great decision. We also ordered a Kiwi-gum combo hookah which was quite good.
1. Crispy chilli baby corn - a humble dish, done very well. They used different coloured peppers which added different flavours. The crunch remained even though we took our time with the starters. 
2. Crispy fried chicken - better than KFC, that's all I've got to say. Before you scoff at the idea, you should try it yourself. The crust was thin and crispy. Chicken was perfectly cooked, unlike most places.
3. Chicken Arabiatta pasta - again, perfectly cooked chicken; I mean melt-in-your-mouth perfect. The pasta was spicy, nicely boiled and really tasty. It had heaps of meat too.
4. Herb rice with Chicken a la King - buttery, thin grained rice and soft pieces of chicken, in a creamy white sauce. I loved the preparation. After the light spicyness of the pasta, this rich creaminess was a really good contrast. There were four pieces of chicken in the curry with rather too much sauce (but it's so delicious, you won't be complaining).
5. Ice cream Sunday - it was an okay dish. A scoop of vanilla, a scoop of chocolate, served with raspberry syrup. We had to order it as the Mud Pie wasn't available. Nothing to write home about.
6. Brownie with Ice cream - we should have ordered two of this one! The portion of brownie was a tad less (two thin wedges), but the taste... Ohmygod. It is creamy and fudgy and will stick to your teeth and your heart. Not too sweet, a perfect combination with the ice cream.
7. Cool Blue and Ice Tea - both delicious and refreshing, but nowhere near as impressive as the rest of the meal. The ice tea was better, AQJ makes a better blue drink but that's a rather lame complaint.

So. You should definitely visit this place. Groupon or no Groupon. I saw them serving the rest of the tables, and their portion of French Fries is awesome. Their nachos with some kind of a topping would have made me salivate, had I not been so full. Can't wait to go back and try their jalapeño poppers, along with a bunch of other stuff. After all, how often do you come across a hookah joint that serves good non-veg food?

Went with my wife and infant, so couldn't go to the inner cafe; outer area had a decent decor, I liked the wooden finish, the buddha statue, and the frames on the walls. Service was prompt and staff were courteous. They have a call waiter button on the napkin stand, which makes things so much better!
On to the food...
Crispy Chicken - Good taste but a little too oily.
Crispy Chilli Babycorn - PERFECT.
Manchow Soup - Too much salt and soya sauce!
Pasta Aglio-e-Olio - Great, but could use a bit more salt.
Chicken Garlic Noodles - Awesome; seemed it was custom-made to my liking!
Brownie with Ice Cream - Great; some chocolate sauce wouldn't hurt, though!
Overall a great experience!

And finally decided to meet over with my student after ages. And where else could it be but city centre as it is at a pretty convenient distance from our place. So it was dinner timer and we were deciding to hit kix, when my student suggested this place to me. It is just situated opposite cc1 , opposite balle balle dhaba. And finally took a move. I was initially reluctant because I pretty much thought there might be a space crunch considering the apparent outlook. I was amazed to see the buddha statue and the amazing café like decor. The staffs guided us inside to the hookah section and further inside which had comfortable couches, dimly lit. I was taken aback by the wall textures and the amazing lamp shades they had put in. The guitar though felt out of place. I love the cosy couches which were perfect for couples. We decided on hookah, wanted the pan rasna flavour. It was ages later that I was trying this . And the hookah was amazing as never. Just as strong as you would love it to be. We decided to start off with the minestrone soup. And the soup arrived in spoon shaped bowls and the soup was amazing. I would definitely recommend this for the soup lovers. Then we decided to order for a crispy chilli babycorn , which was average indeed. The corn pizza that we had order was completely thrash. It had overtly been done and it was more of a biscuit than a pizza. The pasta creme with mushroom was quite well done. So this can be quite suggestive.the fresh lime soda was good. But the ice tea definitely needs to be worked upon. Portions were a bit on the smaller end. But the amazing and phenomenal was the brownie with choco sauce. It was just too perfect. It was soft and the hot chocolate sauce poured over the brownie just made it taste better than never. The bill was quite easy on the pocket. The staffs are quite happy-to-help types in comparison to the staffs of other hookah parlours.  I am definitely going back for their minestrone soup and brownie.

This café cum hookah bar is located just oppsite city centre 1 saltlake . The interior is divided into a hookah lounge inside and a no-hookah portion outside . I got myself seated in the no-hookah zone and found the décor quite impressive. Their coffee and food were good as well . Prices are moderate. The onl downside for me was they suddenly opened the glassdoor between the two sections which completely filled in the space with the smoke which was just not very pleasant …. I am sure they can improve on that . Overall a good place to hang out and have a casual sip and bite .

I go to this place every saturday,  and i and my friends lovingly call this place as Mclaren's  (How I Met Your Mother Fans anyone?) 

A great and  fun place to chill out and relax with your friends on a weekend evening.  

-  best hookah in salt lake city area. 
-  the menu is surprisingly well,  for a café,  and the food is really really good.
- ambiance is good for relaxing but the place is a bit dark.
- furniture is clean and comfy and the place is very artful with nice decorations along the walls with a striking retro look. 
-the service is quite fast,  and the crew is very friendly and helpful.   
- unique  thing about this place is that they often hold  live screenings of events,  and themed events based on special days.  

- food is really good,  compared to other cafés, (did i mention that earlier?)  ?

- price is reasonable enough,  you get your money's worth.

[ACCORDING TO RECENT VISIT]
Recently we tasted some more dishes like - Roasted chicken salad, chicken cacatori with herb rice, Shanghai chicken (dry) and took mocktails like - pink lady and virgin pinacolada. Each and every dish was awesome. Waiting time and promptness in service has improved than my previous visit. This time we choose to sit at inside section. This section is decorated with cosy sofas, dimmed light and no one will hamper your privacy. Again it's highly recommended..

[ACCORDING TO FIRST TWO VISITS]
We went there twice this week (both on weekdays at 2.00 pm), but didn't know about their happy hour offer... they didn't inform us too about this... i think if their is any offer introduced to woo the customers, they should also be informed... because everyone is not always checks through zomato before going to eat..   if they would inform us about the happy hours, it will add to our likeliness for going again..  
as per food it was tasty, but  ambiance was just OK.. and one strange thing is that, they always charge a crew donation of 10/-rs on every bill.. and they always take a lot of time to serve food.. though it is a nice place for having a lunch or snacks.. certainly recommended.

This review has been long over due and a long time coming. The ambience, food and service is fantastic. Last but not the least, the hookahs are the highlight. The hookahs last long and they have innovate flavour options. This is the only place in calcutta which serves the 'bong hookah'. So all you hookah lovers of calcutta, its a must try. I have been a regular at LCC for a while, and i would highly recomend a visit as it is one of the best places in salt lake to sit, chill and have a great time. Kudos to the management. You guys are doing a great job. Keep it up.

My husband's and my favourite place for a coffee n some spanish omlette and pasta on any lazy weekend whenever we feel like going somewhere close to our residence. The peach iced tea, pasta mammarosa and the spanish omelette  are so so yum! Ambience is cosy and they have a hookah place inside too which we try and avoid :P

Visited after reading in zomato. ..it was easy to find out, situated just opposite to cc1, only alibaba.
It's nice and spacious, interesting interiors. Appropriate for adda with friends. Even one can celebrate b'day or other occasions as they have separate rooms with limited number of seats. In this world cup season, if u want to watch matches with friends, their lounge is perfect.
About the food, the pizza was tasty, no need to ask for extra topping or cheese. Crispy chicken was nice. Plenty amount is served. 

Overall I am satisfied with this place.

I want zomato to update the menu. The price has increased.

Went there today in a group. First of all the ambience is good and place nicely decorated. Whatever we ordered - veg food, mocktails, hookah, dessert all were good. Music was really good. Have been to other places like Ground Zero and 360 degree but overall this place is much better. Only few minor flaws needs to be checked - music needs to be bit loud and washroom must be kept cleaner. Barring these this place deserves many visits.....certainly recommend.

Nice Place to chill out.We had taken Hookah with paan-masala and gum flavour.The hookah was great.But special mention can be claimed by the Berbeque chicken Pizza which was "awesome" redefined.But the spaghetti wasn't up to the mark.

The place needs to rethink about its ambience and specially the latrine which in my opinion is seriously below par.

Went to just chill out and spend some time with my bestie and had a pretty good time.
-nice place to chill out
-reasonable rates
-neat and we'll kept
-comfortable furniture
-hookah cost is pretty cheap (compared to others)
-really good food (atleast what I ordered!)
-good service
-really baad choice of music
-lighting makes it a bit dark and sad

What I tried and what I suggest is the Chilli fried Mushroom / Babycorn in tomato sauce (not sure if the name is right or not, but I guess you'll find it on the menu)

I had been craving for some good quality coffee for quite a while now, and after a bit of research and recommendation by Zomato in the form of a feature in the "Great Coffee" category, I decided to give Le Coffee Creme a try.
The cafe/restaurant has a pleasant ambience, although I felt that they could expand their cafe section, as it feels more like a 'waiting area' to the main place with hardly any servers and staff around.I didn't take any chances and ordered the classic cappucciono to start off with. I inquired about the kinds of coffee they serve and they seemed to know what they were doing. However, when my coffee arrived, I was in for a rude shock as it tasted like a really strong, bitter version of the kind of coffee you get in train stations. I asked them to change it, as I thought there might be a glitch. Which was a mistake, as they added more of that ghastly coffee powder/ espresso into the same cup. Either they use instant coffee or make espresso out of extremely low quality coffee beans. Either way, that does not make it anywehere close to 'value-for-money' at 90 INR (including taxes).

I cannot comment about their food or the hookah parlour they run at the back, but considering that the name of this place has the keyword "coffee" in it, I assumed it would be their forte. But sadly, they presented to me what I'd call a magestic disappointment.

This place is good for hookah aficionados! Had gone there with a couple of hookah fanatics. Ordered a double apple and paan hookah. Friends weren't very pleased with it, though. We ordered light snacks, a cheesy jalapeño sandwich, and cheesy garlic bread. Both tasted yummy, with lots of goody gooey cheese. Prices seemed okayish. The ambience is good, the place is pretty big, so there's a lot of choice to choose a place to sit. Music was trippy, sorry, not a fan of loud music. Okay service, overall a nice experience!

This is probably the only joint in salt lake which serves very decent coffee. They have quite an impressive menu to start with. Not being a fan of hooka bars, my comments are restricted only to their food and beverages. There is decent isolation from the booming hooka bar room. The cafe portion is small, cosy and aesthetically pleasing. The service is prompt and friendly. Quality of food is very impressive for it's price. All in all, it's a very nice cafe in Salt Lake which is rather underrated. Must try.

Stuff I loved:
Cafe Mocha/ Hot chocolate/ Cafe Latte
Crepes
Lemon Iced Tea
Bruchettas

Ambience wise the place is impressive. Brilliantly located. But they could do so much more with the decor and the music selection. The food we ordered was not very impressive. We had the crispy cheese balls and the quantity served was less. The hookah was very dismal as the brainfreezer mint combo was the least strong flavor wise. Even coal wasn't properly started off. Maybe a bad day to visit, but definitely not recommended by me.

A nice cosy place to chill out in this part of the city. The ambiance is quite impressive with a Buddha Statue at the entrance which gives you a feeling of Trance. The wall is decorated with several photo frames which make it very quirky and colourful. Inside there are big black sofas with tables and a giant projector screen which is best to watch matches with your gang of friends. Inside is a small little place where you can organise parties and also enjoy if you are in a large group. I loved the music being played in this restaurant... The Hookah flavour got enhanced with the trance music played here. Food served here is Veg :( (But its okay once in a while). The music compensates the food part :P We tried a combo hookah which was good enough. The lemon tea was also good and very refreshing. Though the place closed down by 1115 PM yet i would like to visit it again and stay for a longer time.

Almost every item on the menu is good like the pasta is really delicious and plateful. Other items like Lasagne, panfried noodles, mochachillo were really fantastic. The place has a great location still reasonably priced.

Well, visiting this place, opposite to hangout exit of CC1 saltlake,  u can get a new genre of decorated foods n interior design.it has got two parts,  one just cafe and another is a hookah bar. If u sit in the normal cafe arena, u can enjoy the food with reading books on photography, sociology, etc,.i.e, u can get a new experience of a modern design of ambience n food here.  But the only con is that u can run out of pockets here. Its a bit overpriced. So atlast, If u hv got a bit heavy duty pocket u cud surely come here.  Just a #TRyOut label from me.  \cheers/

Situated right opposite city centre salt lake, a cafe cum hookah bar, it is one of the worst cafe I have ever been to. Decor was insipid, service was just not upto the mark, the waiters seemed to have a lot of problem in serving and taking the order, their body was not moving to work. Bad music, and the most importantly the food.... I ordered Mexican nachos, chee zee pizza, strawberry ice tea and Oreo Shake. The things that was edible was the nachos and the Oreo Shake. And after trying out the pizza out there I don't think i can ever dare to order pizza anywhere. The strawberry ice tea was nothing but roohafza. I suggest  you all whoever is reading this, that please don't waste your money and spoil your mood by going to such a dead place.

A Recent visit to le coffee creme left me astonished, a hookah cafe which serves such good non veg food. The interiors are done up thoughtfully, different sections are dressed up differently. Chef Tanmoy being his usual self guided us through out the entire evening and present us his best creations. We were served an array of moctails... The Virgin mojito and a brownie shake were my absolute favourites! We started with the food one after the another... A Tangy saucy chicken pasta salad was bought to us at first,tasted great. Chicken cheese fondue was next and it was totally gorgeous,licked of every bit of the dish! A colourful non-veg platter was next which consisted of my some yummy crunchy chicken, saucy drums of heaven and prawn pepper salt! A pesto flavoured chicken lasagne was the star fish, I'm going back soon for it. A chicken bbq pizza which tasted decent was in between. We ended our main course with a yummy baked cheesy fish rice, it was indeed delicious! The chocolate mud pie which came next was my favourite among the desserts! The Nutella crepe was too good as well. An amazing meal :) thank you for hosting us!

So we ordered a cheese tortilla.. Portion was amazingly small for the price we were paying.. And had a lil  too much salt in it..  We asked for peach iced teas.. Unavailable.. Watermelon.. Unavailable.. We settled on a lemon iced tea(wch was nestea btw) and lime soda.. The menu was so disorganised.. Its Very difficult to order from that kinda menu.. Hookah was good (apple martini flavour).. In short.. Not at all a value for money kinda place.. Sad

It is very easy to locate this coffee shop, it is bang opposite City Center 1. It is swanky and spacious, well decorated, with a big projector now to cover the FIFA...not too bad. The seating arrangement is very comfy and the staff very non-interfering and friendly. They also help you out with the order. There is an adjacent shisha bar, and the hookah is reasonably good. Crowd is mainly young college / office goers. Now about the food. The menu had a choice of quick bites, pizzas, sandwiches, pastries, mocktails, tea, coffee with an assortment of Italian, Chinese, Continental plus last but not the least choice of omlettes and frittatas. Well, you are not hard pressed for choice. 
The beverages are good and one cannot complain. The quick bites are good too. The platters are mainly ready-made, sauce-based, quickly tossed hybridized cafe items. Like I said, you cannot really complain, but there is no subtlety or authenticity. But the pocket pinch is not too large, about 200 per person. So it surely has all the potential high-points that make up a modern-day upmarket urbane adda zone.

Le Coffee Creme is located opposite to City Center 1.
The place is awesome .
One wall is filled with abstract posters .
There is a Buddha statue.
The place is quite and calm.
On the counter theres a gramophone.
Which interest me.
And on another wall there was funky and coloured mugs for decoration and a self full of books which would interest many people.
As I am into photography , I found two books about photography.
One about portraits and one about close up.
There were many literature books too.
I knew I could not finish reading them all within an hour or so.
We ordered Chinese .
As we were hungry and it was a vegetarian resturant.
We ordered hakka chowmein with egg toppings and cripsy chilli mushroom.
Believe it tasted awesome and they gave  at a large quantity.
Inside was hookah bar.
The food was so tasty that we didn't leave a bit on the plate .
But the problem was when we got our bill.
It completely shocked us as we have calculated something around 500 it would cost us ,but in the bill it was 700.
But whatever it is we enjoyed and loved it.

Le Coffee Creme - A 75 Seater Cafe, Situated just Opp. City Center, Salt Lake. 
Has Segregated Its Sections into 4 Parts.
Sec. A - The Non-Smoking Sections, decorated with a variety of abstract portraits on a wall, with an actual functioning Gramophone, with assorted tables of 2,3,4 shuffled up to depict a nice coffee shop.
Sec B - The Entertainment Section (as i would call it), has a projector that allows amazing match experience, has a dark ambiance, with limited lighting and comfortable seating.
Sec C - Can be more of a PDR/Private section for the less social ones.
Sec D - was comfy sofa's, and a brighter effect.
No, as for the USP, The Food, one will not go hungry in this place, with a large menu with over a 100 items to choose from one can select the food of their taste's.
Desserts, are a fab affair here, with the In-House Chocolate Brownie, The Chocolate Crepe, The Mousse Or the TiraMisu, One Can not be disappointed
Shisha's are also an elaborate affair, with some in house innovations, Be It The Banarasi Pan Or The Smoking Mojito, Its worth the Buck.
All In All A Good Experience For Sure.

Le coffee creme is located very close to city center1.The interiors are pretty good and the most striking feature of this place is the warm hospitality,whether it is the server or the chef himself. I have had their cheese crepe and it was average.We also had chinese which included hakka noodles and a portion of chilli garlic paneer.The chinese was just about okay. 
Prices are okay.
And i was very impressed by the hospitality.The chef took careful notes of our suggestions and visited our table twice to check on our food. 

Presently le coffee creme needs to work up on their food a little more and that being done,the place can be an absolute hit.

had gone with friends for breakfast at 8amand found that the place was not ready though they claim that they operate from 7.30am. thats point no 1.  point no2 the menu states something but they seem to have no clue about it like we had ordered egg bruchetta with cheese the egg on garlic bread came but the cheese still had not arrived till the time we finished!!  very disappointing experience indeed . would not recommend the place at all.

Le coffee creme - a place with a good ambience and a bad taste of music.

I had been to Le coffee creme on recommendation of my friend. We were three of us and when we first entered the place, the ambience was perfectly done up with wallpapers and potraits hanging on the wall. However, the music disappointed me. The bollywood music was not perfectly complimenting the ambience. 

The second thing which disappointed me was the menu card. They had not perfectly holded the menu card with the aligner. The aligner should have been in the middle and it was not looking designish at all to align it on the top side. 

We had ordered chaman bahar hookah which was not very great. It was choking. We also had ordered pizza bar b q which had mozarella cheese, paneer and olives. Trust me, the pizza tasted like a home made pizza. I did not really like the paneer too. It was bland and just like the usual out of fridge paneer which is just hot without much masalas in it. As per the hygiene issue, it was very hygienic but the taste lacked badly. 

The staffs were very polite and service was prompt. However, the affair is pocket pinching. Costed us somewhat like INR 800-900

Suggestions:
1) Keep it soft music or somewhat instrumental. 
2) Enhance your food by experimenting more on what a customer would like to have.

Checked out the place yesterday. At first glance found the place a bit depressing and was about to cancel my order thinking that we made a wrong choice, when the chef Tanmay intervened and asked us to stay (yes he had over heard us). And so we did. Here is the food experience:

Cold coffee and cafe mocha were good and hot. Specially liked the mocha. A generous helping of chocolate, just the way I like it.

The pineapple was disappointing and tasteless, which tanmay promptly replaced with a Special black forest shake creation, which I will surely recommend. try it without fail.

The mixed veg grill sandwich was good, but the corn chilli toast was excellent.

I was also informed that they will be starting breakfast services soon with pancakes, bakes and the works. Honestly looking forward for the next visit and would recommend you give it a shot too. 

Special word for the Chef: Tanmay is a sporting fellow and challenged us with his food.  And a talent he is...keep up the good work.

Okay so this hookah lounge is very loud on the ears, extremely steep on the pocket and make bad sheesha too!

Went there today evening with friends and had a bad, bad experience.
Though, the cheese balls were okay. I did not like the nachos.
They were very bland. And the hookah didnt taste like the "kiwi" flavour too.
And the bill came to 800 bucks !

I am really annoyed and dissapointed and wudnt suggest this place to anybody. A big NO.
Guys, please avoid if you dont want to spoil your time and money.

The only decent part was the cheese balls thats all. Nothing else seemed pleasing. The music was just too loud and I felt like someone was hammering me on the head. 
Ambience isnt good either and might not give you a good vibe.
I am not going in there again, Sorry!

Awesome. Great ambience and good shisha with delicious food, the environment is to take most of the credits. 

The café has improved a ver the time with mutliple sections. 

The Food Chef Tanmoy for Continental kept the spark alive, he is super good. 

Shisha's goes side by side with great good drinks and decent music 

The management is responsive and staff very courteos and to my surprise the prices are reasonable compared to most of the café in nearby.. 

events are frequent for today they have world cup war 2014 scheduled and café will be up and running all the time during the match with special menu and offers. Tang ting awesome ding.

This place is nice for hangout with friends. Location is great. Shisha and food is good. I think for people living in salt lake this could be one of the hanging joints, however the price is a bit high given the ambiance and small space.

What a Ripper!

Had gone to this place with very high expectations which came crashing down as soon as we entered the place.

As we were the only ones, we had literally the entire floor to occupy. The interior is done in decent manner.

After some look around, one waiter "greeted us" and we had to ask for water even. Our 1st order was Nachos - To our disappointment, we were served ready made Cornitos topped with scanty toppings of baked beans & salsa. when we asked for Cheese Sauces (as mentioned in the menu card), we were answered that It was wrongly printed. WHOA!

Next order of Potato Roesti - A straight out of Mc cain frozen Roesti rounds & tasteless. The elaborative description in the menu card has better taste than the one which was actually served. 

The server had no idea of what he was serving and their was no manager/supervisor around. 

Much to the agony, the owner lady (which the server told us) was sitting diagonally opposite to us, was not interested in the chaos happening with us and was busy chatting away with someone.

A very very awful & harrowing experience. NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED!

This place should not be advertising it as a place that has wifi. The wifi here is 10kbps or something. A single google result took 20 seconds to load. No exaggeration, literally 20 seconds. 

Secondly, they played the same song on repeat 8 times and changed it 15 mins after we asked them to do so. Imagine walking into a place, and listening to the same song for 40 mins!

The place is cool to afraa with friends, good choice of food and nice variety as well found here, i like it very much specially when it comes to continental food. One of the best hookahs i had here, awesum taste. I keep coming here often but its never enough for me......



----- 23 Apr, 2013 -----

Overall quite an impressive experience I must say. To start with the atmosphere here is very chilled out and refreshing and the ambience is very well done. I feel the lighting of the place too is very suitable and adds on to its positivity. The choice of menu and its taste needs to be appreciated. The continental section is really nice and so is its section. The mocktails are also well made.

My boyfriend found this place on zomato and decided to bring me here on Valentine's Day. We had very little time to spend together after office. It was a big risk given the nature of the day but his gamble worked! The ambiance was edgy and trance-like!  As soon as we settled in one of the plush sofas, a scented candle was lighted for us! Then came a complimentary plate of strawberries dipped in chocolate sauce! Anybody is bound to feel good at such a warm welcome!

We went for a mint hookah (this was the first time i was trying out hookah!) and ordered nachos with cheese dip. The hookah was nice for me!! Although i wouldn't really know if it wasn't coz i was feeling brazen just trying it out...and so i didn't really care if about analysing it!! The nachos were a disaster really!! 

We were not in the mood for food and its a veg place and the menu is really very boring so we decided not to order further. But before we left, they made our evening even more memorable by clicking a photograph of ours, printing it and presenting it to us in a beautiful cardboard frame! 
I really want to thank them for making the evning so memorable. But as far as the food goes, i see no reason why i would want to return. Sad.

Visited this place the other day.... it has good interiors and a good ambiance. The staff is also good with their service. The food isn't that great, not worth the rates. The coffee is just like a normal regular coffee, that can be made at home. i only liked the baby corn, the sad part is i found a strand of hair in the dish. the menu doesn't have anything interesting. The menu is a jumble. The music is so lame. And they charge you for change of coal which is a rip off.  On the whole i wont be going to this place again. Just a one time try out place.

One of the finest cafes in Kolkata. Few days ago my girlfriend planned my birthday party in this cafe. They reserved our table n decorated the place very beautifully. Complete with candles and roses. The staffs were very amicable and cooperating. The food was great and the ambiance was fabulous and romantic... coupled with complementary mocktail.
 This, i found, is the best place to plan for special occasions.

I went to this place very recently and was amazed to found the wide variety of food, hookah, and drink menu in a hookah lounge. The food is awesome for which one would get tempt for and will visit again and again. I had seen a post on the facebook page and went to see the new republic week celebration. Really impressed with the range of combo menu's

As soon as I sat with my friends, the staff offered us complimentary mock tails which was the part of the theme running in the cafe. The mocktail was pretty good which was completely inspired by our Indian flag colors and was also named as "The Tiranga Mocktail".

The staff are really nice and helps you in suggesting the best deal offered. The interiors are pretty impressive. One gets a choice to enjoy at a lounge with loud music and screen, sit with some for a serious discussion in the fine dining area and also a separate coffee shop for non smokers.

The herbal hookah was really nice which lasted for almost an hour without any complain of choking. Overall it was a wonder full experience. For me its a 100% thumbs up.

Le Coffee : Situated In The Heart Of Salt Lake City, Le Coffee Provides A Great place to Hangout  & Dine-In.
*Prices Are On "The Higher Side" compared to other 'Hookah Parlours" In Kolkata, which one would not expect.
That Being Said, The Food is Extraordinary for a Hookah Parlour In Salt Lake.
The Staff Is Very Cordial And Helpful, providing a great class of service.
Amazing Ambiance and Great Lounge Music, With Projectors making watching Matches a Great Fun. (No Sound Of TV Making you not able to listen to Commentary and stuff which is a downer though)
Hookah is great and served instantly after order which is great.
"The Manager In-Charge" Is always present to carter and solve any grievances of guests instantly, which is very good.
All In All A Good Thumbs Up!!

i went to this cafe/restaurant recently on a snapdeal offer,basically wanted to check out the place and thought it would be nice to try it out on a deal.
the good part: food is good,definitely one can get tempted to dine in again...... the amount is a little disappointing given the price tag but good to go overall.loved the food.

the bad part: the floor manager (or as he seemed) was a very ruthless guy,(so goes for his waiters) and dimwits as well..they first blatantly denied us using the deal which was still very much valid on that day..(and afterwards as well) and tried to shift us to some ongoing offer we were not even interested in.so a confusion arose and after i asked them to talk it over with the snapdeal guys they let us have a seat!!(yeah till then no one offered a seat).menu didnt have  the items we chose first(dont know if it was deliberate,specially after the not so warm welcome nd the war of words).i could hear slangs flying around,waiters and others chattering their way away and was too loud to be picked up by any1.space was small,crowded layout of dining tables and chairs,frankly the ambience was nothing great.lastly when they presented the bill there was a huge confusion as they again didnt go by the deal and made a bill of their choice.and i found out both the waiter and the floor manager were both morons having not understood a simple thing.their behaviour was awfully bad as if they were feeding us for free cos we bought a deal(forgetting the part that deals dont come for free).
lastly it is an all vegetarian restaurant/cafe(if i am not mistaken). for me i will never go back again cos of the bad and unprofessional behaviour meted out to me and my friends.
the food is good but i have had better at this price.
p.s they should learn and understand the deals and offers temselves before putting up on the net.
