Average Bengali Sweet Shop. The regular Bengali delicacies are available. Based on the Mishtis and Doi I had from here, they are average in taste compared to the price charged.

One of the worst sweet shops in Kolkata. Don't waste your time and money by visiting this one. The sweets are also overpriced. They have another branch near Lokenath mandir.

The Description: Right at the crossing of Chinar Park,new town.

The Ambience: Store is quite big as for sweet shop... 

The Food: Whats good: Sweets and Misti Doe
The Conclusion: The most annoying moment comes when Â One single person running the shop and always asking for change here.It also has a main branch just 5 mints away near the Lokenath Baba Mandir.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.
