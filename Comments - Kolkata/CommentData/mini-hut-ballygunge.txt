It's our favorite take out Chinese place in Ballygunge. It has very good delivery service. Food is good with big portions. Must try is - Fish in mustard sauce, drums of heaven, pepper chicken and the hakka noodles.

Located near ekdalia this is a nice little restaurant serving decent Chinese. Being very close to my school I used to frequent this place a lot. Visited here recently a few weeks back and it was heartening to see they have maintained their standards. Decent quantity at a pocket friendly price is the usp of this place.

As the name imply, Mini Hut is indeed 'mini'. But we should not judge a book by its cover. This place offers lip smacking chinese at pocket friendly prices. Nothing much to talk about the interior. Service is cordial. Value for money. Good please to visit in a small group.

This is a small place located on Cornfield Road. The kitchen is on the ground floor while the sitting area is on the 1st floor. The ambience is average though the food is good enough. The place very small and the seats are too closely placed. We faced a shortage to space there though the waiter tried his best to make as comfy as possible. There is still room for improvement on the food and quality of service.

Had to have veg. Meal for a day (mom's orders).. So tried Exotic veg. in thai green curry with steam rice. N My god.. It was next to heaven. I had something similar in thailand as well but that was non veg. So no comparison. The flavours were amazing.. Lemon grass.. Broccoli.. and veggies in curry.. Ahh.. Mouth watering. If you are a veggie and wanna try something new.. Your search ends here.. Try this

Want good Chinese food at a small price?? Well Mini Hut is the perfect place for you. It's a 20seater restaurant with a nice decor on the first floor. Every time I visited the place it has never disappointed me. The quality of food they serve at such a low price is just phenomenal. Since I'm a momo lover I'm very very critical about its taste. Mini Hut serves one of the best momo I have ever tried. The outer layer is not very thick, the chicken is perfectly cooked and seasoned well and most importantly the inside is not dry, it's very juicy. Actually if you cut the momo into two halves you can actually see the rich broth coming out of it.
Other starters that I would like to recommend are
1.Kongee Crispy Chicken- It is basically shredded chicken fried in a batter that makes it very crispy and it's tossed in a savoury sauce. This comes at a pocket pinch of ₹190
2.Crispy Chilli Baby Corn- Comes at a pocket pinch of ₹170 it's perfectly crispy on the outside, soft in the inside and tossed in a sauce similar to that of Kongee Crispy Chicken. It's more like a vegetarian version of the above mentioned dish.
3. Red and Green Pepper Chicken or Pepper Garlic Chicken- Both comes at a pocket pinch of ₹190 each. Both of them are worth a try.
For main course one should try Chicken burnt garlic fried rice, Chilli Mustard Fish, Chicken in Hong Kong style and Kungpao Chicken. They are just mouth watering. Those who prefer noodles over rice can try out Chilli Garlic Noodles or Butter Garlic Noodles.
Over the years Mini Hut has become a popular spot for mainly home delivery and students from school located near the restaurant area often visits the place.
I wish them all the very best for their bright future ahead.

A small chinese restaurant with an open kitchen on the ground floor and seating arrangement (A.C.) on the first floor.
The interiors are pretty good compared to it's humble outlook.
We ordered-

STARTER
° Red and Green Pepper Chicken (soft and succulent boneless pieces of chicken with diced bell pepper and onion coated in a spicy sauce mixture)

MAINCOURSE
°Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice (not so spicy but tasty fried rice with chicken pieces and hint of pepper)

°Chicken Ginger Capsium Rice ( flavourful rice topped with sufficient capsicum, corn and chicken with a mild taste of ginger)

°Prawn in Devil's Sauce (well cooked succulent prawns coated with batter in a mildly spiced flavourful gravy)

The bill was approximately 900 INR (Vat and Tip included). The food quality was great and the service was fast.

This small hole in the wall eatery has always successfully stirred up my inquisitiveness regarding the quality and taste of the Chinese (Read : Chindian) food they make. 
So one fine day, I decided to put an end to my curiosity and headed to Mini Hut for lunch with 3 other friends of mine.
Its a 12 seater minikin eatery having the kitchen in the ground floor and the air conditioned seating area on the first floor. Nothing to boast about the ambience but It's pretty neat and tidy with a functional AC.

Coming to what we ate and how we felt. 
[P.S. I apologise in advance for not being able to provide you all with the exact price of each dish because I have lost the bill. So the value stated below will be more or less an approximated amount.]

1) Thai Tom Yum Soup (Prawn) @Rs.130.00 (3.5/5) : The flavour of the soup was good with more or less correct amount of red thai curry paste and ginger. Lemon leaves were used as a substitute for lemon grass hence, that kick and aroma of lemon grass was missing. The prawns were fresh and okayish in quantity. I would have personally preferred a bit thicker consistency than the diluted soup we were served with.

2)Crispy Chilli Babycorn @Rs.170.00 (4.25/5) : Aah! Crispy batter fried babycorn tossed in a luscious concoction of sweet-sour-spicy-salty sauce, garlic, spring onions and green chillies! Bang on flavours! Loved it.😀😍

3)Mixed Shanghai Friedrice @Rs.170.00 (3.25/5) : Just another indian counterpart and spicy take on friedrice with dried red chillies, garlic and other prominent vegetables, prawns, scrambled eggs and chicken bits. Wasn't very spicy though. The flavours were good but not overwhelming.

4) Hunan Chicken @Rs.190.00 (2/5) : This dish came with 8 pieces of chicken in a watery gravy. The whole dish had an eggy smell to it. This may have happened due to the fact that the chicken pieces weren't deep fried after dipping them into egg batter. Definitely did not enjoy this Hunan Chicken at all. The rating is solely because the chicken was of good quality and was very soft.

●Final conclusions : 
Food Taste : 3.25/5
Staff Behaviour : 3.5/5
Quantity : 3.5/5.
Value for money : 3.85/5
Total : 3.5/5

Per person cost is approximately about Rs.230.00 (inclusive additional charges) with fairly good food. 
So this place deserves a visit. 
Recommended.✌🏻
Happy eating. 😀❤

The service was fast. We ordered a Chef's special fried rice and a hot garlic chicken. The fried rice was indeed special. It had tossed vegetables, deep fried paneer and nuts. It was moderately spicy and tasted delicious. The hot garlic chicken was equally delicious.

A small place located near Ballygunj, the food here is simply awesome, especially the Chicken manchurian and chilly garlic noodles. The service is quick and the price is a bit on the higher side. But the taste makes up for all the shortcomings of this place. If you are in a small group (max 6) , and want to have good chinese, this is the place to be !

Insanely tasty and economically viable menu, our almost daily lunch/evening eatery. Quantity is pretty filling, a solo serving of fried rice should be just enough for two people.

Must Have: The Chef's Special Fried rice - it is so tasty by itself, you will not even need a side dish!!

Food is awsome
Pocket pinch moderate
Quantity is gud
One Hakka chowmin is enough for 2 hungry soul. Though gravy chowmin is not enough for 2 ppl.

Located at gariahat ekdalia zone..Mini hut is a small eatery serving delicious Chinese dishes at reasonable prices. A friend took me there for a quick snack after pandal hopping. We didn't get a table as the place was crowded, so we decided to take away. We took hakka noodles then. Tasted delicious!! So I went back the next day after pandal hopping in that area and ordered chicken fried rice and hot garlic chicken .. Those dishes were delicious too.good portion size.

A zomato search for a reasonable chinese eatery led me and mom to Mini hut today for lunch , located conveniently near gariahat ekdalia zone and aptly named 'mini' giving an idea of the space inside.The ground floor is the kitchen and take away counter and the small clean simplistic and decently decorated restaurant is on the first floor , with just 2 tables for four and 3 tables for six. The rates are very affordable , quantity of each dish is good for two adults with average appetite. we ordered CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP , MIXED HAKKA NOODLES , FISH IN SANGHAI SAUCE and got a plate of MIXED FRIED RICE packed . The cooking suits our indo chinese palate that most of us are fond of , do not expect something exquisitely tasty , but all the dishes were upto our expectation taste and quality wise. Do visit if nearby.

The restaurant is located inside the alley by the Ballygunge bridge.It is a small joint and consists of 4-5 tables only.I love the ambience of this joint.It was neat and clean and nicely decorated.

Food Ordered : Drums of heaven, Chicken fried rice and Mini-Hut Chicken (chef special).

They provide good quality foods with sufficient quantity.
The portion they served was enough for us and also the bill wasn't too high.
A good place to visit as it's worth it......

A quick visit to this cute little eatery only 5 mins away from South Point High School left me satisfied and wanting for more one evening. We had ordered Chilli Chicken Home style, which had 10 chicken pieces. It was too much for the two of us, but we literally inhaled it because the taste was quite good. Coupled with veg fried rice and some fresh lime soda, it was a wonderful meal. Thank you for your service.

Ordered home delivery yesterday from this outlet. Chicken Gravy Chowmein and Chilli Chicken. As usual, Mini Hut does not disappoint in the taste and quantity department. Had some for dinner, and the rest for lunch today. Truly, the quantity is truly impressive. 9 on 10 for taste. Thank you for your continued service.

Located on the Cornfield road, this small eatery is quiet a great one, you get to eat quality chinese(Indianised off course) the sitting area is located on the first floor and service is good, I generally take packed food from this place since it is near my home.

The restaurant is located inside the alley by the Ballygunge bridge.It is a small joint and consists of 4-5 tables only.I love the ambience of this joint.It was neat and clean and nicely decorated.

Food Ordered : Drums of heaven, Chicken fried rice and Mini-Hut Chicken (chef special).

They provide good quality foods with sufficient quantity.
The portion they served was enough for us and also the bill wasn't too high.
A good place to visit as it's worth it......

A quick visit to this cute little eatery only 5 mins away from South Point High School left me satisfied and wanting for more one evening. We had ordered Chilli Chicken Home style, which had 10 chicken pieces. It was too much for the two of us, but we literally inhaled it because the taste was quite good. Coupled with veg fried rice and some fresh lime soda, it was a wonderful meal. Thank you for your service.

It was one of the most important day of our life cause our 5 years college life ends on that day.. So before we start our upcoming new journey of life we decided to celebrate.. I went there with my besties.. They have their sitting arrangements at 1st floor.. It is a small joint and consists of 4 tables ( 2 tables with 4 chairs and 2 tables with 6 chairs ).. They also have their take away counter at ground floor.. We ordered 1. STARTER : Red and green pepper chicken, 2. MAIN COURSE : a) Hakka noodles veg, b) Burnt garlic rice, c) Mini hut chef's special chicken.. They quickly served all of those.. I like the taste of those foods.. I love the ambience of this joint.. It was well decorated.. It was neat and clean,which I like the most.. They provide good quality foods with sufficient quantity.. Perfect pocket friendly place for all and also for sudden plans.. Totally recommend..

It was the last day of our college and we decided to have lunch together... Mini hut is a small place but the interior is tastefully decorated... We went in and ordered Red and green pepper chicken, veg Hakka noodles, chicken burnt garlic rice and hot garlic chicken.. The food didn't take much time to arrive and it was tasty as well... The portion they served was enough for us and also the bill wasn't too high...Basically the perfect place for students and the ones who do not want to give their pockets a lot of trouble..@.

Cute little place,tucked inside the alley by the ballygunge bridge. It serves good quality food and is a hit with the south point crowd. The restaurant is on the second floor,over the take over counter below. Decked up nice but needs a revision with the prices. It's much too expensive for a tiny glorified Chinese joint. Service is good, portions are pretentious but delicious.

Me and a friend of mine were in the area for some work, and after having completed with our work, we were super hungry. I took to Zomato to search for a Chinese restaurant as my friend wanted to have something Chinese. Mini Hut popped up in the search engine, and we followed the navigation to reach to the place.
Its a small, very small place. The welcome was not so good. We went upstairs, and the ac was switched on as soon as we took a table. Minimal decor. Wooden furniture. White walls, false ceiling, few glass showpieces, and nothing much to be mentioned in the decor. As it was afternoon, there were no lights switched on, well lit with sunlight.
Most of the dishes from the menu which we wanted to have were unavailable. So as such we had to choose from a minimum menu as told by the waiter. We ordered one plate of Chicken Noodles. The quantity was as such it was suffice for two persons. I ordered a glass of soft drinks along with it. The noodles was not so good, an okay-ish dish. We did not like the taste much. 
So we thought of not to order any more dish from here.
Coming to the behaviour of the staff, it was horrible! The person who was dealing with us was not at all hospitable. God knows how come he is working in a restaurant where he has to deal with customers, with such an inhospitable and uncooperative cold behaviour. I recommend the owners of the place to change this person's behaviour by training or terminate him if you guys want customers to come to your place. Also improve the food quality and focus on the menu so that the food availability is suffice.

It is a very clumsy place even AC was off, when we visited. We ordered soup quantity was less and quality is average. Starters was nothing worth mentioning. Mini hut special fried rice in main course was pretty bad rice was not cooked properly, mixed fried rice didn't had a single chicken strip. Hot garlic chicken was very bad in taste and quantity is less. Would have given less than 1 rating.

Seating arrangements and interiors are quite decent. I wish they just change their menu card. It looks so bad compared to the restaurant. The best thing about the place is you pay what you see.

From Gariahat, if you walk towards Kasba, there's a way beside named cornfield road. It is where exactly Mini Hut is located.

It's a small, cozy, 25 seater AC restaurant that actually gives good food. The portion may not be large but it's not bad either. 

The best part is that they serve food really fast and don't make you wait for ages. I personally like places that don't charge me vat. This is one of such places. You pay what you see.

I opted for some Chicken mini hut noodles and hot garlic chicken during the eve and both were good.

A good place to visit as it's worth it.

Located near cornfield road and half a kilometer away from my former school this place provides one of the most affordable Chinese foods. The location is very convenient, but the space is too small. Barely 15 people can be accommodated in the test at and people suffering from claustrophobic might not find this place very much amusing.

The seating arrangements were good for 25 peoples, place was clean and serving time was too fast, order received within 12 mins of placing. 
Hong Kong chicken has 10 large sized chicken pcs with nearly zero coating. Corn and chicken fried rice was also good. Quantity were sufficient for two people. Will definitely visit again and try some other dishes.

This small decent eatery near the Ballygunge bridge is quite a popular place for office employees and college students. You will be directed to the seating area which is at the first floor, a small yet comfortable place with peaceful ambience. The quantity is enormous and absolutely value for money. Do try the vegetable schezwan noodles and chilly paneer. The crispy chilly babycorn is also delicious as an appetizer. All in all, a decent place to eat in , when you are tight in budget and want to savour delicious Chinese fast food.

Some points I would like to share about this place....

1) It's called mini but itz sweet...

2) Food quantity and quality is very good. 

3) Food servicing is quick. 

4) F & B people should know how to talk and keep their words...

"Customers satisfaction will lead to ur success"

5) For the side dishes, the amount of gravy is given very less...Simply could not make out the difference between dry and gravy...

6) Environment was good...and selection of songs can be made better...

Me n my brother were waiting for some friends so looked for a restaurant on zomato. And this little gem came up. It's a cute neatly done place with simplistic but clean interiors. We ordered sweet corn soup, hot n sour soup n red green chicken, the waiters recommendation. The sweet corn was below average no chick stock. The hot n sour was just hot n no flavor except coriander. Chicken was average, loved the juicy bell peppers though. As a Chinese restaurant always should be on the table soy sauce vinegar chili sauce etc. Here was nothing which was kinda sad. I cudnt customize my soup😉 it costed me 400 bucks which is ok not cheap by Chinese standards.

Mini hut is actually a mini low ceiling restaurant with max capacity to seat around 20 people at a time. It is located in the cornfield road, just opposite of the Nnoni showroom of gariahat. The ambience is good and cozy... But it would be better if you avoid to go to this restaurant on a hot and humid day,  it can be a bit suffocating or claustrophobic. 
Coming to the food its really good,  but the quantity is small. We ordered crispy chicken in chilly honey, Burnt garlic rice and shanghai chicken with hot basil sauce. 
Ps- they serve u cool drinking water which is a plus point.  ☺

A nice and wallet friendly place to hangout with your friends, got an invitation from my buddy for his birthday. The seating arrangement is small, at the most they can fit 20 people. The furnishing is good & the main thing the food, rates are very reasonable and the quality is nice too. They excel is chicken preparations and the mushroom did not meet up to my expectations, their "burnt rice" dish is also worth a try and the chowmein dishes are just like any other Chinese restaurants. Order delivery is more or less quick and the servicing is proper.
Bottom line, you can take your pals to dinner and you don't have to worry about getting a hole in your wallet lol.

Yet another major find near gariahat.  And this time an amazing little chinese joint. Rightly named "mini hut". This one is near cornfield road. 
Exact location: if you are heading towards kasba from gariahat, get down at the beginning of the kasba flyover. Take a left turn walk for a few minutes and on the left foot, bang on, there stands Mini hut.

On entering,  all that you get to see are the nepali cooks and their steaming woks and the waitera fighting to get their respective orders ready. The smell is so rich that you will get the initial feel as to how the food is going to be. 

The joint is real "mini" in true sense. A 25 seater hardly. It is difficult to get a seat on weekends.  Lucky we bagged one.

I was a bit late. So my friend had already ordered a soup for us.
Chicken manchow soup it was. So perfectly made. So well served. Steaming hot. Properly garnished that it made me thoroughly fall in love with manchow and made me break the clichéd order of chicken sweet corn soup whenever I wanted chinese.

Next up was a starter..
Green chilli chicken...this was suggested by the staff. It was the find of its kind. Chicken which was done to perfection with the correct amount of spices, the chilli paste created a rich flavour and the chicken was so very soft, that it literally melted in the mouth

The mains were:
Burnt garlic fried rice.. again this one is a sheer recommendation. Very few places in the city can prepare the burnt garlic rice in such splendid proportions. The right amount of garlic, it was definitely not overdone and it tasted heavenly. 

The tsing hoi chicken along with the chicken just complimented far too well. 

Well the bill was quite decent. And definitely did not create a huge hole in the pocket. 

However I feel the space crunch has to be dealt with, as such a crampled place would not be a preference for me the next time I opt out for dining out. However the food is just too heavenly.

Located on Cornfield Road , Mini-Hut , is a small chinese restaurant . 

Its a bit small & cozy , as it goes with its name .

Mini Hut - A really mini place serving good quality food.
=====
Location: 8/12 Cornfield Road. If you don't know where it is, head straight from Gariahat towards Kasba, Just before the Flyover to Kasba Take a left turn (not the whole V Turn.) On the left hand side leaving a few buildings you will locate this small eatery.
=====
Intro: Mini Hut is a small eatery whereby the entrance comprises of the workers cooking the meal and thereby when you enter and walk a few stairs, you reach there. I felt it is made just below someones residence. The place is a lot small and hardly have 5-6 tables and that also stuffed together. For the ambience, it's very simple with fans and a cooler on. 

I was waiting for a friend to order the food but they were hurrying it up unnecessarily to get the table as there was a next booking whereby people had not arrived. It was a bit rude of the management to continuously come and ask and could not just wait for 10 minutes so that i could have my meal. I was a bit disgusted so i went on ordering the food. They did not have any mocktails which they used to bloat their menu and were just serving soft drinks. It's just Chinese here. 
=====
Food & Beverages ordered:

1) Chicken Manchow Soup - I just ordered this and was waiting for my friend but they kept insisting on ordering more which is totally not justified. It was very rude and that's where i will cut your points. Nevertheless, the soup was good. The noodles served on top were crisp complementing the soup. #musttry

2) Green Chilli Chicken - It was superb. The chicken pieces were very tender, spiced up and mouth melting. #musttry

3) Tsing Hoi Chicken - It was delicious. A little spicy but complimented the rice very much. #musttry

4) Garlic Burnt Chicken Fried Rice - It was perfectly cooked and yummy. The garlic was burnt to the perfection and was crisp too. The chicken pieces were added without any second thought. #musttry 
=====
Pros:

1) Delicious Food. 

2) Reasonably priced.

3) Service is prompt. 

Cons:

1) Hospitality requires improvement. 

2) The menu had a little bit problems. Please check it and make the suitable corrections with the spellings. 

3) Cramped seating arrangement. 

=====
Expert Suggestions:

1) The menu can be improved. 
2) Add mocktails on the menu. 
3) Don't cramp up the place.

A small but comfortable place to eat out. They offer delicious dishes at pocket friendly prices which is the best thing about this restaurant. I have been there many times and never had the chance to complain about anything. The service is good and so is their behaviour. A must try out is the Lemon Chicken.

Mini Hut - A really mini place serving good quality food.
=====
Location: 8/12 Cornfield Road. If you don't know where it is, head straight from Gariahat towards Kasba, Just before the Flyover to Kasba Take a left turn (not the whole V Turn.) On the left hand side leaving a few buildings you will locate this small eatery.

I visited this place two times and every time I went it never fails to amaze me with the food quality.  A very small place where 25 people can hardly accommodate at a time.For the first time we ordered lemon chicken (as suggested by my friend) and a mixed fried rice. Trust me I did not had such soft buttery lemon chicken ever.The mixed fried was perfectly cooked with ample mushrooms, prawns, chicken and what not. Next time I went with my lab-mates and we went for a more elaborate cuisines. We started off with a chicken clear soup , a fish tandoor , lemon chicken ( which became a must now ) and a garlic chicken. The food was absolutely a pure bliss. Last but not the least I was astonished by the warmth of the restro. If you haven't visited it yet , give it a try I can assure that you will not be dissapointed.

This little place is located near Gariahat-Ballygunge Crossing towards Ballygunge Place. It's a small Chinese restaurant in the area but very less people know that they make really good food and often underestimate the place on the basis of looks of the the restaurant.

I ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles, Dry Chilli Chicken and Shredded Chicken in Black Bean Sauce. The Hakka Noodles was very good in terms of quantity. It had large pieces of Chicken and big chunks of onion and egg in it. The Dry Chilli Chicken was 'not so dry' but still good to taste and they give you big ten pieces of chicken, so can't ask anymore. Shredded Chicken in Black Bean Sauce was awesome, the black bean sauce was really good and I drank all the gravy.

Pricing is quite cheap considering their good quantity and the pleasant taste of the food. Home delivery is a problem as they refuse to deliver if the location is a bit far say 3-4km. Also they have some problems with their opening timings as they do not pick up the phone anytime before 12:30AM. Anyways, the food is prepared quickly with minimal waiting time. Packing is also good, so less chances of spillage.

Outside ambiance could have been better. Considering it's not a very old restaurant, they could have decorated it a bit more. The mini-kitchen which is faced towards the road (maybe for takeaway orders) looks extremely shabby. Can't tell about interiors though.

So, overall a very good spot for quick grab 'n' go if you want some tasty and tummy filling Chinese at cheap rate.

This is a really decent restaurant.  If you are a bit short on cash but still want to go to a place where you can have decent food, then this is it.  I have been to this restaurant a number of times and they have never let me down. The quantity and quality of the food served here is good.  The space crunch is a problem though.  There are only  4 tables.  So it's a bit of a problem.  For take away purpose it is pretty nice.  They Also have home delivery service if you live somewhere in the vicinity.  The crispy chilli fish is their best item...  However I personally don't like the chopsey here..  I am not saying its bad..  But at the same time it's not upto the standards set by other big restaurants in the town...

I know that chilli chicken and chowmin is the commonest of all foods we have tasted, but trust me the chicken chilli garlic noodles with chilli chicken home style in mini hut is a must try for all. The quality of meat and the unique taste of noodles i am sure many of us haven't tasted before and both the quantity and quality is just awesome  and the price is quite pocket friendly!!

It is a very small restaurant.. Kind of a hide out. The interiors of this place is nothing great but it definitely is neat and tidy. 

Coming to the food... A friend if mine and I had ordered red and green pepper chicken and mini hut special fried rice. 
The chicken pieces were very soft but the taste wasnt up to the mark. 
The speciality of the mini hut special rice was this that...it had cashew nuts and cittsge cheese pieces added to it. I think, even without these above mentioned ingridients the rice wouldhave tasted the same. 

Service was okay-ish. The waiters were courteous...took around half n hour to prepare these two items.

Not only do they serve delicious food but that also at Pocket friendly rates. To add to that, the service was pretty decent. The waiting room is a bit on the smaller side, but no complaints once you get your table. The air conditioned dining space with its interiors and glass paned windows is the place to be, specially on a rainy day like this. Would surely come back for more.

MINI HUT
GARIAHAT

This small eatery takes well after its name “MINI”, it is indeed a small cozy place, the restaurant is directly above the kitchen and if you are a tad tall there is a good chance that your head might be touching the ceiling. 

The food is nice, not indianised Chinese but it feels authentic, and one thing that irks me is that many of the Chinese joints don’t serve pork, this being another addition to the list, neways we ordered Schezwan fried rice and Sliced chicken in Devil’s sauce, service was prompt although the server did not ask to serve the food which was a strike for them, the schezwan rice was spicy full of chicken and frankly enough for two person where as the sliced chicken was okay , maybe because I am more of a diced chicken guy. The bill came at 315 bucks which looking at the food and taste was very reasonable. 
This place is a nice hangout for students and fresher’s alike, good food cozy atmosphere and I am pretty sure for 4-5 guys it wouldn’t be more than a 1000 bucks which in today’s Kolkata is pretty steep. The only problem maybe is finding the place as you have to keep your eyes peeled as it is tucked in a small lane.

Many such small nice, delectable eateries are hidden in every nook and cranny in Kolkata, serving up some of the most delicious grub in town. We just have to dig deep coz good food knows no limit.

recently they have started taking VAT 14.5% .i think its too much to offer in a para fast food centre.but the food quality and quantity is ver good.its just awsome.but if the bill rises to 1400 from 1200 because of tax..its just not bearable.I they they should include the taxes and make the brekups in the base amounts.Nearby GRUB CLUB has been much clever to have included the tax.viz: chicken fried rice 90.break up. 82.5 +7.5.thats wat we need.lol. arsalan dont charge any tax we u sit in the basement n have u biriyani.its more or less the same as park street bar-b-q pocket pinch. but quality n quantity is veey good.i think to make bussiness they should not take the VAT for home delivery atleast as i doubt the bussiness will surely fall.as there is a lot of competition in that area.food rating 5/5.

Located near our school ,this is generally the place we have most of our after school birthday treats especially since mini hut is extremely pocket friendly.As the name suggests this place is indeed very small.The restaurant is situated directly above the kitchen and if your around 6ft tall its highly likely that your head might touch the ceiling.Coming to the food,iv been eating here with my friend's for the last few years and this place really serves up some amazing chinese food and is very economical for students like us.Some of our favourites which we order almost everytime inculde d chilly garlic noodles,the oyster mushroom chicken,and the pan fried chilly fish.Generally a meal for 4 -5 costs about 1100.

Well, like a true Bengali, we love trying out new joints offering Chinese Cuisine and this has been another one of our successful & worthwhile discoveries. Having tried out most of the Chinese joints in our locality and vicinity, we were desperately looking for some new place to eat out and not too far from our place at Dhakuria. Again our resort was Zomato and this time we came up trumps again with Mini Hut.

The place is not too lavishly made up - it's a small joint about 50 meters on Cornfield Road from RB Connector with an open kitchen which allows you to view exactly what's happening there. The staff is very cordial and the owner himself is available during the restaurant operation hours. The Sitting space is not too big - it accommodates about 20 people at a time (2 * 6 seaters & 2 * 4 seaters). However, since this joint is majorly used as a Take Away joint, we've had to wait only once for our table in our 6 visits till date (the reason I'm writing my review after my 6th visit is just to make sure that the Quality is consistent).

The soups are delicious - we've tried Chicken Sweet Corn, Chicken Corn and Coriander, Chicken Manchow, Chicken Tom Yum. All of them were as good as I've ever had them.

The starters were disappointing on our first visit - the crispy fried chicken had sesame on it and also it was pretty stiff by the time we consumed it. Apart from this ONE instance, our experience with the food has been fantastic. The customer service is also right up where it should be. We had once ordered for a Pan Fried Chicken Noodles and while eating, found that the Soy Sauce was a bit on the higher side. As we liked the dish, we ordered for another plate and this time specifying that the amount of Soy Sauce needs to be less. However, when the Noodles arrived, we found the amount of Soy Sauce as much as the previous one and on complaining, they immediately prepared a fresh plate of Pan Fried Noodles for us. Great Job!

The Pan Fried Chilli Fish and the Drums of Heaven were simply Outstanding. The Pan Fried Noodles is something that you DEFINITELY need to try - simply awesome; almost oil-free and non-greasy; sufficient quantity of chicken & vegetables.

The only disappointment (if I may call it so) is that the quality of rice they use for the fried rice could be better. They use the long grained rice, whereas, I personally feel that the aromatic small grained rice works better when preparing Fried Rice. That's the only blip if I may be prudent enough to say so.

Overall it's a 4.0/5.0 from me.

The worst thing about this restaurant is that you have to go through the kitchen to get inside the restaurant, and smell those raw ingredients before you enter.

Untrained staff, bad food and too "mini" in size.

You can skip this Mini Hut.

Termed as 'The Essential' by our group of friends, this place deserves a thums-up. Good Food, Reasonably priced and decent quantity. Owner is very down to earth, delivery is considerably on time and the food stays hot even when had half an hour after the delivery being done.
The only two negatives (rather small ones) are:
1) No toilet if you intend to dine in.
2) Very slow service of food 
Otherwise this is a very nicely managed place with excellent taste and super friendly prices. Must visit for someone within close proximity to this place.

Good old Chinese food!
3 out of 5

Mini Hut, in the ever busy Gariahat area, is definitely one of those places where you get tasty and delicious Chinese food. The place is very popular among diners of all kinds. The small and ordinary looking restaurant serves some highly affordable Chinese dishes. Though it is not spacious, the warm and cosy ambience makes up for this deficiency. The servers were friendly and very prompt with their service. The food does not take very long to arrive on your table and all the items mentioned in the menu were available. They serve food in generous quantity as well. 

Among their soup offerings, hot and sour soup and Thai soup were good. The broth was not only light but had a good amount of meat and vegetables in it. The non veg starters we tried (drums of heaven, lat Mei kai and lemon honey chicken) were mouth watering! The meat pieces were succulent and tender. 

Their chicken side dishes for the main course were equally well prepared and delicious. We tried dishes like shanghai chicken, kung pao chicken, and Hunan chicken. Their seafood side dishes are also good though we did not try any. One can try dishes like hot garlic fish, burnt garlic fish, chilli wine prawns, chilli prawn and prawns in lemon coriander sauce.

Their rice and noodles were light and non greasy which is great for those who like to eat healthy. The noodles were soft and are served with generous amount of meat in them. Their fried rice dish was scrumptious and not dry either. The food quality of this place is not a cause for concern at all, as the food served is fresh, fast and healthy. 

The convenient location and the excellent food make Mini Hut a good stopover for all who come to Gariahat for shopping.

Went there a few days ago....Pretty cramped place...although very good chinese food...the chilli garlic noodles tasted awesome...the burnt garlic rice is also sumthing to taste here....although a big dissapointment for me was that when i entered there was a dead fly in one of the empty glasses....when i asked the waiter to remove it...he just dropped it put the glass back on my table without even cleaning it...when i again told him he changed the glass for me but put the glass on the next table...This was a BIG DISSAPOINTMENT for me...the waiters are pathetic and totally inexpirienced....but all this gets accepted to an extent in comparision to the food...
