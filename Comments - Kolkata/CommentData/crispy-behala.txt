It's a small takeaway joint located on Brahma Samaj road next to SBI ATM @Unique Park. Its a must try if you are a local. I've mostly tried their Chinese main course dishes and the Chicken Bharta. The quantity of the rice and chowmein is good and price is extremely pocket friendly. It's been a saviour many a times when Swiggy and Food Panda failed me. The owners are sweet and friendly. Hope they maintain the quality and keep the price low. :)

This one is just beside my house.  Had their food quite a number of times. Superb Chinese, especially their momos are worth a mention. And for the biriyani, well you don't get this quality at this price. Highly recommended :)

They make great momos. The fried chicken momos here are really tasty and considerably bigger in size. Other dishes like crispy Chilli baby corn and chow meins are good too. Sitting arrangements are serious problem. It's more like street side joint.

Small food joint which was earlier located near manton, D.H road. But now it has relocated near Arya Vidya Mandir. I am an ardent fan of their steamed momos. I gorged on their chicken steamed momos numerous times . The momos are soft,properly cooked. Special mention goes to the soup accompanying it! Very delicious. 
Tried their egg chowmein today. One plate was more than enough for 2 people if you are planning to have it as an evening snack. It was light, tasty! A good option  to have it as an evening snack. Looking forward to try their other dishes as well.

A nice Restaurant in remote are ( far away from D.H.Road ) . Manage,ent behaviour is very sweet , Food quality suits with their behaviour . Quality and Quantity are good comparing to their price . Open kitchen helped me to see the cooking materials . Oil is high quality , Sauces are mostly imported . I would suggest others to try with Biryani and Chinese food .

A takeaway restaurant near Arya Vidyamandir. It caters to a great variety of food items . I had ordered Chicken Biriyani and Chaap . Both of which were excellent at truly a cheap price . The Biriyani was THE BEST in the local area . I hope that they maintain their quality of food.

They have many outlets in Behala . I ordered Biryani , Mixed Fried ice , Chicken Gravy Chowmien , Different preparation of chicken . In one word to me all are awasome . Price is very reasonable but both quantity and quality are high . I LOVE TO TAKE FOOD FROM THERE . I would ask the management to maintain this standard , surely they will grow very fast .

Ordered pan fried momo and Szechuan momo on two occasions from here. It's better than your average local fast food counter. Both the dishes were well done, and the Szechuan momo was aptly spicy which was great. They do not compromise on the filling. And the gravy was delicious. 
The delivery took a long time that they had mentioned that.
My only complaint is the packaging it came in. It leaked and there was gravy and oil in the packet. That's not acceptable.

A take away joint near Manton Guest house, though an eatery has opened up in Brahmosamaj Road. Food is reasonably priced. They provide huge quantities of noodles and rice which is a big plus considering the price tag. Taste is good too. I am a frequent buyer as it is very near to my home :)

A kiosk which opened recently just before Durga Puja this year. Basically a fast food joint.
Location: This place is located in Brahma Samaj Raod, Behala. Not a tough place to find.
To be honest, I was not at all happy with the quality and taste of their food. There are other places which provides better food in the same budget.
I had a Egg Chicken Roll which was far from the word "good", it was just edible. 
They should definitely work on their food to survive in the cut throat competitive market of Behala
