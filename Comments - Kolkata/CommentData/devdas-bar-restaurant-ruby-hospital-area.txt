This place is on the bypass, but only for having fun with friends not at all with family, the atmosphere is not good. Even the food quality is on an average.

Devdas is strictly not a place for foodies at all. Located on the bypass side lanes once you cross science city. Purely and dedicatedly for drinking purpose with very shabby and not so good ambiance.

Very bad place for a foody like me. U wont get good food to eat. Options available here are just worthless. To please drinkers this place offers alcohol at cheap rates.
