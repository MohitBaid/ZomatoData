The sizzler was really nice to taste and the garlic bread was even good.Keep up the same quality :) 
Presentation of sizzler could be a bit better and a bit of thick gravy along with sizzler to be increased with the cottage cheese.

An average place I would say. Food is pretty good. This restaurant offers nice Chinese cuisine. 
Veg Manchurian is pretty good . I also tried Hakka noodles and crispy chilly baby corn for starters  which were decent. North Indian food here is average.

First impressions of the place was that it looked like a proper decent place in Howrah to sit down and eat. The quality of restaurants in Howrah is not the best and not the most hygienic, but for a change the place was good. The food was good, decent by Kolkata standards and great by Howrah standards. Plus points for being available on both Zomato order and Swiggy. I would recommend for any one who wants to find a good place to eat in Howrah.

I used to take a lot of parcels but now i think i should stop visiting this place. Wednesday night they made me wait for 25 mins for panner do pyaza and on sunday evening, yestarday, i was made to wait for 40 mins for crispy chilly baby corn. The guy sitting at the counter told me it takes 30 mins to prepare a baby corn. If this is true Khana Khazana then close your resturant.

We had ordered online from zomato at 8.45. order was to be delivered by 9.30. Our home is max five minutes from the restaurant. At 9.25 we received the message that food is out for delivery. We received the food at 10. The order was incomplete. We had ordered three masala kulchas but they delivered only one naan.
So after waiting for almost 1.5 hours we received the wrong order.
We had to cancel it.

Location: On Maulana Abul Kalam Azad Road.(Dobson Road) Pretty Famous. To the left.--------------------- Ambience- Very Family like. Not at all cozy and quiet. You will always find little kids banging and crying. Not  recommended if you are looking for a peaceful chat with friends or boyfriend.--------------- FOOD- I ordered Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Veg Hakka Chowmein, Veg Gravy Manchurian. Chowmein was really good. Disappointed with Manchurian and Baby Corn. The Manchurian was Hard and not tasty. Baby corn on the other hand was too oilyand sweet. Not at all spicy. Not happy with the Manchurian and Crispy Chilli baby corn. I would not recommend this unless it's too urgent . Skylark is Better. Overall- 2.6/5

Quiet a good family restaurant in howrah since times immemorial.
Been here an infinite number of times nd would say they never disappoint you.
They offer a wide range of products at a much affordable Price.The service is above par,the space doesn't remain concern anymore after the addition of family section,Ambience needs some work though.
Food is delicious and apetising and the best part of this restaurant.Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Cheese onion dosa are must try,North Indian is Decent.

The way most attention is given to the quality of the food sends out a clear message that they are here for business and would stay here for long.

My Ratings-
Food: 4.5/5
Service:3.5/5
Ambience:2.5/5
Overall: 3.5/5

Talking about food it is decent. The ambience is good for family and friends. The worst part of the place is the that they don't have parking.

Well one place where u can go in howrah where u get almost everything on d menu card.. Good food, pocket friendly though the service provided isn't satisfactory.. My personal favourite is the cheese onion masala dosa.. If u r hungry and have 150 bucks in your pocket get in and u ll be satisfied.. The North Indian food tastes average.. Initially the babycorn  served tasted better.. The place is too small and always over-crowded.. The seriously need a renovation and should increase their seating capacity

Horrible place... Horrible service... waiters don't know how to serve... They drop water on the phone and argue that it's not our fault if u keep ur phone on the table....

Dosas are yummy. Do try rava butter plain dosa. The sambar is also very tasty. The place is a bit small and has less seating capacity. But the food is very good. I wonder if they do home delivery then will definitely give a try. 

Will try their indian once I come here again.
