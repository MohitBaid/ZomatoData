We ordered the cake online and got it delivered. It tasted awesome, even the fondant was yummy. We ordered a two tier cake with red velvet and chocolate truffle. Look wise it could be better. The owner was very courteous, polite and professional. But she does not delivers to all locations, comes maximum till park street with a delivery charge. Price is competitive.
Overall a good experience.

I came to know of about this place from Zomato when i looked for personalized cake options in Kolkata. A very common concept in Mumbai but i had doubts if someone in Kolkata, esp towards Rajarhat will be doing it. The pics posted by customer with thr reviews is what made me try this home bake service.

I wanted a new concept of a 'Roullet Table' cake for a casino lover friend, a unique design which was not done by Urvashi before. We had couple of rounds of discussion on the look and design of the cake. I was a lil concerned about the flavour. Being a die hard Red Velvet fan i have never found a good flavoured red velvet cake in Kolkata. Most places make it with regular cream instead of cream cheese, which is the main ingredient giving red velvet its amazing taste. However i took a leap of faith and ordered the cake in red velvet. 

Urvashi did complete justice to the design. The pictures of the cake i have uploaded are a testimony to her art. The original red velvet flavour however was amiss. The cake tasted good but didn't have  the authentic taste of cream cheese. I am not a chocolate lover but i may be i should have stuck to another classic flavour.

I am happy to recommend her to all people who need a unique personalised cake for thr loved ones. Those who enjoy chocolate will love these cakes.

everyone was happy and kids loved those cupcakes . Not only did the owner help me decide on the choices but also customised it to perfection!

Great going !

When it comes to the customized cake, I always prefer to go with the home made bakery rather than the big names.
Now had a friend birthday, so wanted to present a customized cake, there are quite a few options available around Rajarhat and Saltlake. And after going by the reviews and photos decided to go for Sweet Surrender.
And yes the decision was absolutely bang on. The cake was the just reflection of the design I thought of. And the taste was that owssum.
We opted for a mix of a cake with cup cakes. Cake was owsum and special mention of the cup cakes. One of d best cup cakes I have ever had for sure.

And I must say when you see the cake and taste it- it is just value for money.

They used to deliver in some specific places. I took it in Rajarhat, so no delivery charges was there.

Summarize the experience: one of the very promising and superb home made bakery in town.

A big thanks to Urvashi for the lovely cake and made the day so special. Keep going :)

Stumbled upon sweet surrender while looking out for a new home baker who would create something unique for my anniversary. So glad i chose Urvashi. The design was ditto as per my given image and taste was absolutely delicious. I ordered for 9 psc red velvet customised cupcakes and they were super cute and super moist. The cream cheese was wow. I usually dont like cream but this definitely did not give me the sweet overdose feeling. Very balanced and well executed. My family & my husband loved them. 

Price wasnt too steep as per quality and design. It costed me rs. 940. Moreover i asked her to add extra cupcakes on the same day and she delivered without hesitation. Thank you. Will order soon!

I found "A Sweet Surrender" through Zomato, as I was looking for a home based baked cake(which is very popular & a common trend in other cities), because I found the taste of the popular confectioners in Kolkata very monotonous. I ordered A Chocolate Cake with orange tinge for my brother's birthday. It was very much what I was looking for- different in taste, rich dark chocolate, the orange flavor coming through in every bite, & light on the belly! Good work...Keep it Upüëçüèºüëçüèº

We first came across A Sweet Surrrender at the Park Street Christmas Carnival. They were selling cupcakes and cookies and we loved their Red Velvet cupcake with Cream Cheese topping. The cookies were also great. Sadly, when we came back later to pack some for home, they were sold out. We found them on Zomato later and decided to order for a birthday cake and some cupcakes. They are based in Rajarhat and delivers around that area and Salt Lake. We picked our order from City Centre.

We had order a red velvet cheese cake (5 lb) and some cup cakes for our daughter's birthday in June '16. The cake looked a million bucks. The taste was good too. We had couple of rounds of discussion with Urvashi on the look of the cake as my wife was particular about the princess theme. ¬†We were skeptical about the outcome as this was the first time we had ventured outside of tried and tested cookie jar and I am so happy that we gave Urvashi a try. The cake was fabulous and was the showstopper for the b'day evening. The detailing on the cake was spectacular. Without doubt the best baker in Kolkata

I was visiting home during new year and thought of bringing something different than regular sweets, I ended up ordering 6 red velvet cupcakes from A sweet Surrender and bam! They were the best red velvet cupcakes I(&my mom) ever had. The cream cheese frosting was too good & mouth watering, after finishing one, you will crave for more!
My second order was a custom chocolate birthday cake of Clash of Clan theme for my bf & the cake came out more than perfect I could ever imagine. I cannot even start on the taste. A rich three layer chocolate cake with bae's addiction as fondant, what more could you want!!! Made a perfect birthday  celebration. looking forward to new occasions for ordering such delicious demons againüòÇüòÇ

Divine. This applies to this bakery. My first red velvet cupcake was from their bakery. It was last year during christmas eve they had put up a stall at park street. On seeing their red velvet i couldnt resist myself from having them. After theirs i had tried red velvet in various bakery shops but none was as good as A Sweet Surrrender. Coming to red velvet cupcake, what can i say- divine or heavenly i dont know which word suits the most. They were soft and yummilicious. The creme cheese frosting complimenting it finely. Good job guys. Would love to visit your outlet and try the other bakery stuffs.

I've tried chocolate chunk pound loaf and coffee with mocha ganache from this place. And Urvashi never disappointed me! I ordered the coffee with mocha ganache recently and this was the only time I received the order myself, surprisingly, in a country where people are least bothered about being on time, I got my delivery at the exact time as she had earlier specified. She was friendly and warm. Wish her all the best and hope her venture makes it real big!

Was a bit hesitant to try out at first but A sweet Surrrender didn't disappoint. The cupcakes were so pretty and very moist and yum! The flavors were also very nice! Although the designs were suggested by me but you guys delivered and on time.

The Sweet Surrender.

Urvashi Shivnani , i love you . Yes.
My occasions are never without her cakes.

My first order form her was a set of themed cupcakes for my brother's birthday.
They were amazingly done.
* Look at the display of sweet surrender *
Yes those cakes. Yay.

My second order was a themed coffee chocolate cake for my boyfriend's birthday and that was something so nicely made and equally tasty.

My boyfriend gifted me with a grand cake on my 18th and as usual urvashi made it amazing.
It was a theme cake with a minion as base and my favourite thing on cupcakes.
The base cake was amazing that had wasted chocolate flavour.
The cupcakes were nice too but as it was of various flavours, the mint cream was not edible. I personally didn't like it . 
I wish she works on that.
But,
All my occasions will be hers.
The best home baker in town.
xoxo

First things first. This is not a shop where you can sit and eat, one has to order 2 days ahead and deliveries are given in Ballygunge, Park Circus and Rajarhat I guess. Secondly the chef is simply the lady with baking superpower. The best baker in the town and I believe, after consuming a few of her masterpieces, she particularly is very careful about the quality of the product. Simply amazing and yes, a sweet surrender indeed.

Finally..... I had the sinful experience  of Sweet Surrender. We went crazy looking at the pictures and reviews at Zomato and ultimately couldn't help ordering few of our favourites.
Our order included, Jam Rings, Super Oreo Cupcakes, Chocolate Cupcakes and my favourite Rainbow Cupcakes. The cakes were lovingly delivered on time by the owner herself !!!
So, there came our 2 boxes of cupcakes nicely ribboned like a gift and a little transparent box of Jam rings. 
The Jam Rings were 12 in a box, looked gorgeous. I was clean bowled by the presentation and I could feel the care and love with which the owner makes the stuff. Now to describe them one by one,

We started off with the Jam Rings, freshly baked, not too sweet, smelled of butter and were crisp, with a strawberry Jam in between peeking through the lil heart shaped gap on top. The Jam was not spread much, giving the rings a mixture salty and sweet impression. 
The next was the Super Oreo, Now this one looked seriously awesome, with a semi oreo standing within the creamy oreo top, which was resting on the delicious plain cupcake and which was again resting on another oreo. I completely loved the concept and the relished it every bit.
The next was the rainbow cake, these had white creamy top, when sliced open these looked the most beautiful thing I have seen. But I really expected the different layers of colors, would taste of different flavours. But Alas! they were just colors, undoubtedly great though, but I feel, not the best among the lot..
Finally I had a sample of the Choclate Cupcake (Coz I was so full after having all the above), they looked so cute with little hearts on choclate creamed muffin top, I just hated disecting it apart. 
Concluding, I would strongly recommend everybody to come and experience complete delight at Sweet Surrender.

Now the few things that you should remember before going for it, One, these cupcakes come in a pack of six, if you like to have one of each type making upto six, you cannot, you have to order six of the same type. Secondly, these are pretty wholesome, not in quantity but because of its sweetness, if you are not an extreme sweet freak like me, more than one of these cupcakes would be a pain. Thirdly, the lady bakes the stuffs all by herself (Surprised !), hence the orders must be placed 2-3 days beforehand. As there is no commercial shop you need to call and give you preferences and she would lovingly prepare them and send them. 

Well,to cut long story short. dear sweet toothed foodie, these new amazing bakery is your one stop destination to completely indulge in the most fresh and beautiful cakes, come and experience a complete diet destroying foodgasm here!

Indeed an extremely sweet surrender to Ms. Urvashi Shivnani whose brainchild is this amazing bakery.
First things first, this is particularly not a shop. One has to order two days before he wants the cupcakes delivered.
Delivery is made in the following areas :

Rajarhat
Park Street
Elgin Road
Ballygunge

Now, the owner is a beautiful woman with superpowers of baking and in my opinion, is the BEST baker in town. Hands down.
Her cupcakes are just too good. You will also get customized on as per prior orders.
The cupcakes are generally priced at INR 300/- for 6
A pretty good deal to crack. This was the first time I had ordered from Urvashi and she totally lived up to my expectation. The cupcakes were delicious. The vanilla cream frosting is the best in town and she also adds little details and is very specific about the quality of the cake sponge.

I had once seen heart and owl cupcakes in the website and so ordered the same. My order had : 3 vanilla and 3 chocolate.
Both the cake sponges were delicious and the vanilla cream frosting on top was delicious.
And here comes the cutest part :
 It had on top, three cute owls and three pink hearts. They were so adorable.
I absolutely enjoyed having them and have almost made up my mind to order from here every single time.

By the way, Urvashi is extremely patient with the queries because I am a very picky person and she very patiently handled all my melodrama about the cupcakes.

So, what are you waiting for?
Hurry up and order.

Cheers! :D

Urvashi has never let me down, and considering my rather eclectic tastes [from rainbow cakes to multi-tier wedding cakes with black fondant work, to pink girly cakes for a night out] that basically indicates towards her attention to detail, extreme patience, and a superior level of professionalism that is seen in very few entrepreneurs in Kolkata... this woman is young, intelligent, and brimming with ideas and lip-smacking sweet treats, all of which deserve a taste or two/three/four.. 

I would highly recommend A Sweet Surrender for their ability to fulfill custom-design cake and dessert orders.. prices are reasonable and it is wonderful that they home deliver. 

For those who would like to order bite sized treats, go for the cake pops and delicious alcohol-infused cupcakes! 

It has been a pleasure doing business with Urvashi, and I hope that she will start a line of savoury treats as well :)

Sweet Surrender is my go to baker for all my sweet cravings. Its an advantage that the owner of Sweet Surrender is  also my neighbour so basically I just need to hop across the road to get my share of goodies. That being said Sweet Surrender would always be ready to cater to my whims be it making a last minute fathers day cake , mighty raju cupcakes for my 5 year old or the fabulous birthday cake she baked for my rock music fanatic husband! Not to mention the lovebirds anniversary cake she baked for our 10th wedding anniversary. Sweet Surrender is full of fresh ideas and is always doing something new with her cakes.

I really,really love sweet surrender. Cupcakes and fancy decorated cakes might be the flavour of the season but no one has more innovative ideas or better taste than this one!

There's an insane variety of decorative ideas to choose from and a huge array of other products like some really yummy cupcakes and cookies. Thing is,you can bring any kind of vision here and expect to see it before your eyes,tastier than you could ever imagine. No matter how picky you are,Urvashi Shivnani is very patient with all your questions,which I really liked. And she makes it a point to remember even the littlest details. Punctual and proper,there arent any letdowns. When you're ordering cakes for emotional occasions like birthdays and weddings,it's a big responsibility making a cake because its the highlight of the day. But I'd trust her blindly to do it well. Plus,once you start indulging on this stuff,its hard to stop.

There's some minor drawbacks-there's no store where you can go and grab a bite,as far as I know. I'd really love to just invade such a place and try a little of everything. As for now,everything's made to order:either one collects or pays some extra money for home delivery. I'm really fond of Cakes and Afraa too and they tend to be cheaper than here. But its not just quality but presentation that you're paying for here,so I've always thought its justified.

Urvashi is pure genius when it comes to her baking especially for me since I am very fussy and I am also allergic to egg. I have been ordering my birthday cakes Christmas cakes etc from her for about 3 years now and trust me they are to die for. 
And what makes it even better she actually tries to make all of her products eggless on request :) :D which she has done for me!
Personal favourite RED VELVET cake it is divine and she makes the most amazing cream cheese frosting. I wish she sold those in tubs haha. 
I love her other stuff too. I'm a fan! 
Keep spreading cupcake love!

Absolutely out of the world cupcakes made by Urvashi Shivnani. They are the best cupcakes I have ever tasted from anywhere in town. Eating every piece of cupcake is like heaven melting in your mouth. I am not exaggerating when I say I actually live on them. They are delightful to the eyes and blissfully satisfying. I also love the fact that she can customize the cupcakes according to your choice. And what makes these sinfully delicious cupcakes even more special is her attention to every minute detail. You can comfortably make out that she puts in her heart into baking these small wonders. Love that about her. If one hasn't tried cupcakes from A Sweet Surrender, one is certainly missing something. Must MUST try!!!!

And yes, the birthday cake she made for my daughter on her first birthday, made the occasion even more special. No one could have baked a better cake.

I have been ordering from a Sweet Surrrender since they opened about 2 years ago - be it desserts, cupcakes or celebration cakes. I love that they can customise any design to their cakes and cupcakes according to whatever you require. The items are consistent and have the same quality and taste every time. One can see the attention to detail given to every cupcake/cake. My favourite thing about them is I can order and have it delivered to me in the comfort of my own home! For all you dessert fans out there - this is worth a try!

A Sweet Surrender is exactly as the name implies - the process of letting oneself indulge in the sinfully delicious baked goods of chef/owner Urvashi Shivnani. I have tried her marble cake, vanilla cupcakes, Mocha green tea cupcakes, cake pops and chocolate truffle cake and they are all delectable. What sets her apart from the rest is that she never compromises on her ingredients (hence, the sinfulness!) and the care that she puts into everything she makes. Essentially, you are eating a hand-crafted dedication of foodie love. I am held back from giving a Sweet Surrender a rating of 5 as I hope that Urvashi Shivnani is inspired to open her own bakery very soon. When she does, you will find me there on most days indulging in her baked goods (she does great baked goods for breakfast too!) So whether you're vanilla or slightly more eccentric, A Sweet Surrender has everything for you (and if she doesn't, she'll personalize her goods to fit your needs!)
