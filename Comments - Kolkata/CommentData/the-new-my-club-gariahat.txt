Located at the crowdy streets of gariahat ....this place is a great place for shoppers...service is good and the staffs are cordial... ambience is not bad...going by food quantity and quality prices are somewhat reasonable...snacks are good ...my favourites are it's rolls and moghlai paratha....their cutlets and ksbirajis are also worth trying.

The decor is old school, small and comfortable sofas, the food is quite tasty considering the genre, the old Mughlai-Bengali fusion with it's own line of indo-chinese.

Now if you aren't feeling very critical about food and in the mood for some casual snacking or some old school kobiraji dinner, this is the place for you.

Visited this place during puja as most of the other places were over crowded. We ordered tandoori chicken and Biriyani. Tandoori chicken was average but the Biriyani was awful. Rice was not perfectly cooked and please avoid eating with bare hand (sometime spoons and forks are not that much helpful) else your hand will be coloured yellowish orange after washing your it several times!!!

This is the first time i have entered this restaurant nestled in between lots of busy shops in gariahat. Wanted to have some snacks after office. Ordered an AMERICAN CHICKEN CHOPSUEY.
WORST!!!! i have ever had.
They have presented the dish in the most disgusting manner. The very look of the dish will be enough to give you a throw up feeling.
Icing on the cake!!!! They garnish this disgusting dish with raw egg..
I will never visit this restaurant ever.. i wish they learn how to cook!!

This was my 2nd visit to this place, thought they would improve bcz the last time I visited this place,I didn't even finish my food properly.This time I visited them this Durga puja thinking that they would improve but I was so wrong. I ordered chicken bharta,romali roti and mutton masala(which was specially recommended by them) and it was a total disaster, rubbish,awful experience 😖, trust me,the mutton masala was so salty and blunt in taste,the chicken bharta was even worse, I guess the only good food we had were the romali roti's fortunately.
I am certainly never ever ever visiting them.
Thank you.

It seems that it has become a tradition for me to visit this place annually during Durga Pujo :p

Moghlai Paratha and Kosha Mangsho is a part of my checklist of food items that I want to have during the Pujo days and The New My Club ensures that they've been checked off from that list.

When moving towards Deshapriya Park from Gariahat crossing,one will find this place on their leftside near Hindustan Park.
The Chicken Kasha is a good comrade to the Moghlai Paratha and the accompanying Aloo.
They are known for their Moghlai cuisine and they maintain standards even during rush hours.
The Rolls are good too. Can't say anything about the interiors of this place that well as I've always ordered takeaway here.

This place is located near gariahat. Ambience is dull. Ordered chicken biriyani, butter naan and chicken korma. They offer you only leg pieces in chicken biriyani. Biriyani tasted so-so but the chicken was not cleaned properly. The naan and korma tasted better compared to the biriyani. Staffs are efficient and service is fast. No recommendations.

This place is near to Kimbadanti Gariahat; not much easy to locate as its not much open to space
Ambience:- Not much decorated 
Food ordered:- Chicken Biryani Butter Naan Chicken korma
Service:- Its quick and the staffs are courteous and cooperative
Food quality:- Biryani tasted okayish. They will only provide you leg piece of chicken and chicken was not cleaned properly.....butter naan tasted well and chicken korma too way better than biryani.....
No recommendation......

I had been to My Club Restaurant quite a number of times as this used to be our snack destination after the "Gariahat shopping spree". The place is located amongst the hustle and bustle of Rashbehari Avenue (2-3 minutes walk from Gariahat More) on the left hand side if you travel from Gariahat More to the Kalighat metro station. 
The interior is a bit shabby and dimly lit. Coming to food, we had Mughlai Paratha and Mutton Kasa quite a number of times, both of which tasted above average. We specifically mention the attendant that the Mughlai Paratha should have less masala and more eggs (at least 2). However, I feel that the quantity of meat in mutton should be more generous.
Nevertheless, the pocket pinch is quite low and going by the bill, the portions and the quality they provide is justified. All in all, still a lot to introspect and act upon !

And Had Lots Of Fun Together.

Me and my friends ordered some chicken dish n tandoori roti but the waiter said tandoori roti was noy available. But then a police officer came with his family n asked for the same he was also served what he wanted. Now I don't know what that implied. It the food were not cheap i would have really given only 1 star. Neways this was not fair

For a first timer in the city, I was surprised at how many people were recommending this place - especially because the interiors were very unlike Delhi eating joints. 
But once the food arrived at the table (very quickly too!)  and we took the first bite ... yumm!!The mutton biryani, mutton kassa, chicken egg kathi roll and melt-in-mouth mutton seekh with roomali ... all were delicious!!!
Location - 5 on 5 (Gariahat is a busy and popular market)
Food - 4 on 5 (mutton kassa was a little tough)
Service - 4 on 5
Cleanliness - 3 on 5 (the rains gave the place a stink)

After Delhi if there is any city where it is hard to have a bad meal it's Calcutta! 
Even smallest roadside eateries have awesome food!

This restaurant in Gariahat opposite Basanti Devi College/Spencers is one of a kind... Very old restaurant... have lots of childhood memories with this place...as my father used to take me here frequently 'Cause  it is nearby our shop and the owner is my father's friend as well.

I tried many things from this place since my childhood... Like rolls... Biryanis... Fish fingers... Noodles... Few Chinese starter items... Soups... Etc as well.

Fish fingers used to tastes awesome here (Dunno about the current scenario though)... every Sunday it was like a routine for me and brother with our parents to pay a visit to this place during our childhood days.

Both Quantity and quality of Biryani are good and well enough... Tastes nice as well.

Recently I tried Double Egg Roll... chicken sticks and crispy chicken from this place...

Rolls were perfectly cooked... And both the Chinese starters tastes good here.

Staffs are very sober and cooperative... Service is prompt.

Good number of sitting arrangements are there.

Ambience is good.

Pocket friendly place.

Recommendable ❤

We ordered 7 packets of biriyani. Although it was a bulk order, they delivered on time.
They even provide an egg with a plate of chicken/mutton biriyani which many of the eateries have stopped serving unless you pay extra!
That was a bonus adding to the flavoursome steaming hot biriyani!
Definitely worth your money.

Staying near to gariahat, I never visited this place thinking it to be a small eatery. But my perception changed after I visited this place with my mother after puja shopping. From starters to main course I don't think anything is left to even order. I really like their service & staffs are quite friendly, guides you well on what to order.

So i have a special corner in my heart for this restaurant. Every year I visit Kolkata and eat at my club twice or thrice.I've been going there since childhood and can't love any other restaurant more than it.The food is incredible whether it's mughlai,fish fry or Chinese fried rice, everything​ is delicious! It's a bit small and peaceful and many people might not know about this restaurant as it gets lost somewhere in the streets and crowds of gariahat.But I bet it's one of the best restaurants in Kolkata and truly deserves a 5/5 rating! I can't wait for the next time i visit Kolkata again to have food at my club! ^_^

I love this place.
Have had Chinese take-away dinners from here a couple of times. Also, remember coming here as a kid with my parents after the results were out for a fish finger and coffee treat (Yes, I was a Kindergarten Connoisseur ;) )
Haven't been here for two years. Went here last on my 1st anniversary with my partner.
We were low on cash, but My Club made sure we got a filling dinner within 300 bucks only.
We ordered 4 laccha paraNthas, one fish Afghani and one Paneer Shahi Korma.
Loved each and every item.
But, my suggestion would be to pair such rich food with a lighter bread like roomali roti, tandoori roti or plain naan. The oily lachha paraNtha was an overwhelming accompaniment to all this rich food.
The dim lighting and peaceful ambience is perfect for broke couples like us. The 'not so broke' ones can come here too :)

A friend brought food from this place, for a Sunday house party. Crispy chilli chicken which we had for the house party was good in taste, though the chicken seemed to be a little stiff. That maybe also due to the fact that we had the food quite a few hours after bringing the food. The quantity given for each plate was enough for a hungry tummy. Will try out other dishes! 😊

On 7th October during Durga Puja, me and my friend went to this diner. We are both 14 years old so we didnt bear much money and had an average budget. We order one butter naan and Chicken Butter masala, both were of average quality and didnt truely hit our taste buds. The AC restruarent itself is not much pleasant environment with different smell and a gloomy place. Though most of the others were ordering Biriyani, maybe I guess I'll try their Biriyani once because it looked quite tasty. My bill was Rs215 for (One) butter naan and (One) Chicken butter masala (it had 2 pcs.)

My club holds a special place in my heart for making a Moglai steeped in the nostalgia oil. We had this absolutely fantastic Moglai joint in Barrackpore where I grew up and it was a regular go-to place for me. Somehow it vanished and I came to Kolkata to study. And then my club happened. It's one of those restaurants that serve almost everything and you never really check the menu to order food.  If I go away from this city, I'll miss that Moglai of my club among many more things. On an afterthought, I would like to shoot a restaurant scene there someday. It has that slightly shabby, slightly shady but mostly melancholic aura about it. I have also had Chinese from here occasionally and I won't complain having it again when budget doesn't allow you to visit a joint proper. So, that's that!

Appearance is deceitful, it says. Well, to a certain extent, yes. The entrance of My Club for example, would make it seem like a small, dingy joint, but wait till you go inside. The dim red interiors give a nostalgic air to the place, like some 90's movie restaurant. There's a different section reserved for family dining (now who would have made that out initially!). Take it from someone who seldom finds herself going beyond fried rice and chilli chicken, a plate each is sufficient to feed two hungry stomachs. However, the place does provide a wide variety of other dishes at amazingly affordable prices, thereby coming to your rescue when you're broke. Would like to conclude by saying that My Club is a place I'll be going back to, again and again, for it has become home now. :-)

If you are in gariahat and low on cash but you want to have tasty food this is the place..! Located opposite Basanti Devi college they serve good Indian and Chinese food. On my last visit to this place I ordered veg fried rice, chicken noodles, special paratha and chicken Manchurian. Here's what I felt -
1. Veg fried rice- its tasty but its a bit oily
2. Chicken noodles- its very tasty with large chunks of chicken
3. Special paratha- its crunchy
4. Manchurian - its was the only dish I was disappointed with. It didn't at all taste like Manchurian

Overall a nice experience! Pocket pinch is low (though zomato needs to update its menu, the price has increased) and food is tasty.

PS- if you're going for the first time do try pepper chicken in garlic chilly. It is the tastiest of the lot!! :)

♠ LOCATION :
Very easy to locate, just opposite of Basanti Devi college.
♠ AMBIENCE :
Well, there's not much of interior decor but sitting arrangements are comfortable enough with comfy sofas. Plus point is it's air conditioned as well.
♠ FOOD : 
This restaurant isn't a fancy one, but surely they offer some scrumptious, luscious food within very cheap prices!
Portions are huge. Tried both of their Hakka and Gravy chowmein, highly impressed by the portions they offer, and they are equally tasty.
♠ VFM & SERVICE :
Staffs are prompt and very amiable.
Well this is one of the finest example for value for money places! 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 🎩

The New My Club is located just opposite to Basanti Devi College and you wont struggle much to find this place. The place is one of the older restaurants in Gariahat. I had heard a lot about this place and I decided to visit this place. The restaurant has two sections the A.C. and a non A.C. The place is very dark and does not have proper lighting. The staffs are well behaved and did their work pretty well. Coming to the food, we ordered a Chinese Choupsey and a Dragon Chicken. The quantity was sufficient for two. The taste was decent but it lacked Chicken Chunks. I could hardly find any. The Dragon Chicken was not up to the mark, it had some problem with the sauce. The proportion of spices didn't go well.
Didnt like the place. One positive which I found is that they don't take taxes.

3/5 for this place.

Being really hungry and a little tight on our budget, we found this place on zomato and went there. Crossing the non AC section at the entrance, we went inside to the AC section. it looked old and was very dimly lit, but was clean enough.. Without any delay we ordered two moghlai parathas which were absolutely huge..Taste wise it was good, not too oily.. We liked the food and the service too... :)

This restaurant is situated just opposite the Basanti Devi college. It has got both ac and non-ac seating arrangements. Ambience is okayish. Nothing fancy. I've been to this place quite a number of times. The food I've tried are :-
1. Chicken lung fung soup - Pretty good in taste. Had sufficient amount of chicken and vegetables. Quantity could have been a little more. Will gladly give this dish a 4/5.
2. Thai chicken soup - Nicely done. Quantity is just satisfactory. Nothing extravagant. Will give this a 3.5/5.
3. Bhetki fried rice - Being a fish lover, I loved this particular dish here. Great quantity. You'll not find this in a lot of restros. Highly recommended. This deserves a 4.5/5 for the taste and quantity.
4. Chicken gravy chowmien - very well prepared. It's an absolute value for money. Definitely recommended. Deserves a 4/5.
5. Chilli chicken (dry) - The taste of this particular dish was very nice though the quality of the chicken was not upto my liking. The pieces were not tender and most of the pieces were quite fibrous. Just for the taste though I'll give this dish a 3.5/5.

The prices in the menu is inclusive of all taxes. The waiters are polite enough. Recommended.

I have passed from this restaurant multiple times but always underestimated it . But this time my friend took me there for a quick tea and i figured out oh they have a pretty decent restaurant inside. As we went for a tea had some tea and paneer pakoda both were decently prepared and very reasonably priced. They had multiple options in chinese and indian food to opt from and the service was pretty good .

A small family joint for only food but no hard drinks. Food is good in quantity and somewhat quality compared to it's common prices. Must go early in the evening because cooks are very professional w.r.t time, after 9:30pm no more orders.

This is a place where you will get amazing food for peanuts! Yes, it is that cheap. This joint is conveniently located at gariahat, exactly opposite basanti devi college. Perfect for snacking, I've visited this place around 10-15 times just to have their egg roll. The egg roll has a stuffing of potato which makes it extremely filling. The moghlai paratha that they serve here is very good too. However today I was a bit more hungry and we ordered 3 lachha parathas (20 bucks each! Can you believe that?!) and zafrani chicken kosha. The lachha parathas were soft and not in the least bit oily. Perfect! And they gave 2 chunks of chicken in the kosha which delighted me. The essence of zafran in the chicken made it even more palatable. Bill - 220 bucks! This is my definition of comfort food. Most importantly, the waiters are very friendly and helpful. Coming back again and again.

Well this is just opposite Basanti Devi College.The entrance is quite narrow..so you may pass it without noticing it.
The interiors are dimly lit.nothing great.nothing bad either.
Food is quite good here.Try the mixed chowmein.Chicken Pepper with garlic chili.The momos are nice..big in size and the soup is nice too.The sauce of the pan fried momo is delicious
Then you also have Indian dishes
The Chicken cutlet..Chicken Kabiraji and Mughlai Paratha is really tasty
Prices are Ok..quite pocket friendly
Overall..nice.

EGG CHICKEN ROLL - 4/5
MOGHLAI PARATHA - 3/5

These two dishes are filling and palatable enough to satiate the hunger for Dinner.
Roll was good, squeezing little lemon over it before every bite makes it all the more delicious. 

Service - 4/5
Ambience - 3.5/5

Very disappointed by the quality of food served here, the poor hospitality of the staff and the not -value- for -money prices of the food. The taste of the vegetable Manchurian was really bad, the stuffings was not palatable at all. The vegetable chowmin was good . The chicken 65 was not chicken 65 at the first place! I do not consider the interiors of a restaurant necessary to rate it, but the insipid food makes me give it this rating. :-\

This place should be under the hidden gems collection. It is almost possible to miss this place as u have to go through a narrow lane to enter the restaurant.. Dnt look at the ambience n judge the place. It is in a dilapidated state but the food is amazing. I'm not fond of fish but ever since I've had the fish fry and the fish butter fry here I've got the taste of it lingering in my mouth still.. The prawn pakoras are so amazing, it consists of 6 big pieces of prawn n so fresh, no smell! I usually get a lot of smell coming out of sea food but this place serves its fare fresh so there is no chance of getting the smell. The mughlai paratha is very good too.. Would visit this place again and again..

When time is premium and food is necessary, The New My Club near Gariahat can be a savior. It is a dine-in restaurant with AC and Non AC sections. The interior is quite spacious with large sitting capacity. The decor is ordinary and the staff very slow to approach and take the order. I have tried a variety of dishes here starting with Moghlai, Chicken Cutlet, Noodles, Fried Rice, Biriyani, Chopsuey and various chicken dishes. The taste of the dishes are quite okay and the price reasonable. The service is very quick as well and the restaurant is definitely worth repeat visits.

When u desire an economic bite, Kolkata street food is numero uno in the list. Heard ravings of their fish fry, so the proof of the pudding lies in its taste.Ordered 4 fish fries. Again my saviour Zomato Order App. To confirm called the restaurant 3 times. The first two times they hung up on me without speaking.Third time an irritated man received the call , when I finished speaking he said "message check kore dekhcchi" and hung up on me with style. Baffled with such awkward reaction I just waited patiently for the food.  Now what arrived ....4 Jumbo fish fries accompanied with 2 pieces of french fry each per plate and salad. The Fish Fry was priced at 70....the size gave me an eerie feeling of what's it made up of? Coz if they buy a raw bhetki fillet of that stature it would somersault their selling cost by 1 n 1/2 times. Whatever,  very sceptical I took the first bite. The relieving factor was it was not thattttt fatal. The fish inside the crumbs and layers of marinade was nearly translucent. I could not finish a whole fry...after a point in time the coating gets overbearing. I have not tried anything else from there so cannot comment  (read thankfully ). The idea of 2 pc's of french fry was such a comic relief. ..they should have skipped that for my order n saved some resource 😉😉😉. Never mind things backfire but giving up is worse. So soon updating my foodie friends on fresh culinary exploration.  Cheers!!

This place is very much easy to locate while walking towards Gariahat from Rashbihari. From outside it seemed to be a small narrow restaurant but after going in we finally found out they have quite well sitting arrangements. We preferred the AC section and took our seats. To our disappointment for the first 10 minutes no one served us a glass of water as all the waiters were sleeping. Finally one staff came and we ordered Veg fried rice along with Hong kong chicken. The food was quickly served and we started eating. At first taste, it tasted good but as we were ending up we were highly disgusted to find out an insect in our chicken gravy. I mean how could they served us such awful unhygienic food? When I called one of the staff he was making lame excuses. Moreover he was trying to hide their mistake by giving us discount on our bill. Simply it was a horrible experience. It would be far better to eat the street foods  in spite of going to restaurant and face such disgusting situation when you already have had that food and after that discovering a dead insect from your dish. Yaak..!

A quintessential favourite place of mine since school days and it still remains that . Had every kind of food it has to offer ..from rolls ,pakoras ,cutlets to biriyanis,mughlai cuisine ,Chinese cuisine and it never disappoints .Pocket pinch is less and the superb location makes it a favourite among school-college goers to shoppers in and around gariahat.Overall an excellent place to dine ,to lunch or just to have snacks .

Since 2006 I have been visiting this place.. yesterday while returning home thought of going there again. .
As we were not much hungry we ordered chicken sweet corn soup and chicken 65.
Soup was good in taste. Quantity was good to suffice two people.
Now coming to chicken 65 ,it was not upto my expectations. Its a gravy sort of dish. Not a regular dry spicy type. Its taste was far away from regular chicken 65. Hubby liked it somehow but I didn't. .

Tried out this place yesterday during our pandal hopping for dinner as this was the only place which wasn't full. This place offers both ac & non ac dining. The ac dining is charged 10-20 extra from the non ac part. The place offers adequate sitting area.

Now coming to the food, we had the following items:-

1. Roomali roti - 2 pieces were ordered

2. Tandoori roti- 2 pieces were ordered

3. Chicken bharta - small chicken pieces served with gravy which went well with the rotis. We had 1 plate of it

4. Chicken friedrice- normal fried rice made with less oil & spring onions but the chicken pieces were simply served on top of it by sprinkling it which was odd

5. Chicken chow - it wasn't up to the mark to be honest. Very average chow like those found in any roadside stall. We had 3 plates of it

6. Chilli chicken - it had 6 pieces & was cooked well with ample amount of light gravy which went well with the chow & friedrice.

7. Plain mughlai- normal sized mughlai but a tad thin in shape which was served with a smashed boiled potato & some diced salad

All the items in the menu are tax inclusive & remarkably the bill came up to only rs840 shared by 5 people. Another thing to notice about was their efficient & fast service which was very smooth during the crowd rush. So all in all it was a very satisfactory experience

Has an ac an non ac section..They served freshly cooked food quite fast ..We had a non veg fried rice and a paneer rice and it tasted well and completely filled us..

Next time will try their fast food section..rolls and mughlai paratha etc

Cost is quite amicable

I had first visited My Club with my grandpa when I was young. Again visited The New My Club. I had a fish fry parcelled. It was good. They had included 2 pieces of finger chips even!

I landed up here when one of my cousins who studies at Basanti Devi College asked me to meet her over there. The entrance is a little clumsy with a  takeaway order counter located right near the door. This place has two dinning halls ...one Ac and the other non Ac. We settled down in the Ac section which had a much better ambience than the other one. Mughlai and chicken lollipop were the dishes we ordered. We washed them down with cold drinks.The former was nice and crisp. Lollipops were piping hot and succulent. Our bill was around 300 bucks. Overall food was enjoyable and it was quite pocket friendly.

I have loved this place for as long as I remember. Great ambiance, good food and ample quantity are its trademark. Located opposite to Spencer's in Gariahat, don't let the almost shabby entrance turn you off. Once you step inside, its cozy atmosphere and comfy leatherette sofas is sure to leave a mark.

The server recommended the Pepper Chicken with Garlic Chilli to accompany our Bhetki Chowmein and Fried Rice.

Eight thick, flat strips of chicken in a deliciously smoky-flavored sweet and spicy gravy that just zests up your tongue. The chicken pieces, coupled with the main course, was more than enough. The gravy was beautifully done with pieces of capsicum and grilled onions, and no extra veggies. The quantity of rice was huge, and in case you're a small eater, ask the server to divide one into two. The noodles was "Awesome" according to my fish-loving friends, but I found it a little more than pungent. The bhetki strips were merely batter-fried and added to the noodles.

There is also a family room, and even though this dimly-lit place is very charming, I couldn't help but notice the old and decrepit condition of the interiors and the other little things apparently used to complement it.

Service was quick and the bill for 3 came to 580 including taxes.

Another visit in less than 3 days and I was a wee bit disappointed. This time I dropped in on a muggy evening, and we sat in the family room. The leatherette seats are a bit shorter than outside, and this place kinda smells musty. We ordered Bhetki Chowmein, Egg Noodles and Fish Fry, none of which was a disappointment. The quantity was huge, as always, and the Fish Fingers were simply delicious with the fragrance of spices and a solid bhetki core. There was a refreshingly beautiful aroma of coriander and I think fennel, which simply enhanced the flavors. It was wonderful.

It ia an old cafe at the heart of south kolkata and still has a name 'new my club'! But no doubt its dishes are superb. Ranging from their mughlai  to their awesome chinese, its a good overall experience. A bit low on the ambience but still manages to keep up with the good food. Their mughlai parathas and momos are worth trying.

My Club was a favourite of lovers.Of couples at a time when there were no malls,no cafes like barista or CCD,when being in love entailed going to the lakes,Victoria memorial or serreptitiously going for a movie with your better or worse half,as the case may have been.Another reason was the presence of the Archie's gallery alongside which came handy to buy impromptu gifts and cards for your loved one.The secret was the small cabins with curtains which were kept closed on substantial orders and the promise of a hefty tip.
Chicken kabiraji,mutton kassa,chicken cutlet......all above par,a mean mustard,rice and curry if one was hungry,a brilliant tea,under the benevolent eyes of two brothers,who were the owners I think,entering through a long tunnel which widens to accommodate the abovementioned cabins and an open seating,the name is apt.It had a way of making you adopt the place.

North indian has hardly any spicy in it and when asked to make spicy they spicy add green chillies to the dish instead some masala which one would expect.

My food venture started with this restaurant.  Located at gariahat opposite to basanti devi college and beside kritanjali where there was  archies gallery previously.   If you look at the entrance, you might get a shabby feeling but the foods and the staffs makes you forget the looks.  Two sections one ac and one non ac.  Sittings arrangements are good and also they have private areas for family and couples hangout. Both chinese and indian available.  Staffs are friendly and the best thing is you can sit for an hour by only having a cup of coffee..  They will ask you.  Must try momo because they serve a special chutney with it exclusively made by them,  chicken cutlet, kobiraji, biryani, lemon chicken,  mixed fried rice,  paneer butter masala and for thali you need to go before 2 pm.  Foods tastes good and also budget friendly.  I hop in there whenever i go to gariahat. :)

Though the name states The New My Club it's actually a very old joint.Been visiting it since childhood.Always famous for their rolls few of my friends knew about their awesome fish kabiraji. Finally while shopping at Gariahat we decided to visit the my club for some light snacks but end up having their fish kabiraji, chicken fry and also got their biriyani packed for dinner.While the fish kabiraji was at it's best I found the chicken fry which were actually fried chicken wings very bland and the coating was also too thick for my liking.The biriyani was pleasantly seasoned but the smell of rose water used was too strong and sort of act as a deterrent rather than enhancing my appetite.
The quality as well as quantity of all the dishes when compared to the price charged was remarkable.
P.S. The cheerful and always eager to help staff needs a special mention.

My first experience dated back  to nine or ten years ago and my first dish here was bhetki fried rice. And till now it remained my favourite . In my college days i made regular trips to this place with my friends for lunch as it's located near my college as well as my house. Other than the bhetki fried rice some other special signature dishes are fish kabiraji, mughlai paratha, egg roll and chicken roll. Biriyanis are also good here. One must  try out this place. It is pocket friendly and will completely satisfy your tastebuds.

This is a very old joint situated next to kritanjali store which used to be Archie's gallery. Their menu card have everything and anything from snacks to main course but the quality of food is really gone down over the years. Only thing which is kinda radicle is their chicken cutlet and egg roll. Everything else is kinda greasy and not tasty.

It's  just opposite of Basanti Devi college. The entrance looks like one of old food cabins in north Kolkata ....but the inside of the restaurant isn't so bad at all. We ordered fried chicken,mixed gravy chow,and Hong Kong chicken. The quality of food is quite good and its pocket friendly also. Staffs are good,there is an old staff who calls youngsters as "Baba" 😋 and I like it. So overall...for tight budget people who wants to taste good food ....this is one for them.

You will miss the entrance if you are not careful. They have a roll center outside which is visible from the road. If you spot that you will spot the outdoor seating available. If you let your eyes wander farther you will finally reach the AC seating area. With Calcutta being Calcutta (in May), we were very happy to find the AC area and collapse. 
 As soon as we entered, we could smell something very familiar. Small old eateries in Calcutta that serve up good food, all have that smell. The smell that gets your belly rumbling because your nose approves. 
 We ordered fish fries and a moglai paratha. The fish fry was brilliant, reminded me on countless tasty fries I have tasted in many a marriage functions. Moglai paratha iIhad after 10 years I think. All in all, a very pocket friendly place with good food. I am sure to revisit. Cheers.

I went there with my gf for the first time yesterday.. I checked this place out the day before in zomato and since my gf wanted to have kabiraji we decided to try out this joint. On top we had limited amount of cash. Once there we found the ambience to be quite nice. The waiter was well behaved and served the food within 5 mins of ordering. We ordered Mutton Biriyani, Mughlai Paratha and Chicken Afgani (insted of Kabiraji).. The quantity of the biriyani was quite good enough for 2 of us. The mughlai Paratha was brilliant but the star of the show was the Chicken Afgani. We fell in love with it.. the gravy, the cashews topped on the chicken and veggies that were added along with the huge chicken lying beneath really made us dig into it within seconds of serving and the quantity was as I have said before was quite good.. infact it was more than what we needed...Overall a good experience..looking forward to visit the place again

Visiting this place after every boring shopping spree with my family that I have to endure, is sheer bliss. Shabby decor, minimal lighting and almost fully crowded may seem a negative about this place, but the food they serve pretty much makes up for it. I love their chicken roll n fish fingers. Have been enjoying the same since my school days when after tuition I would spend my pocket money on the roll. The chicken Afghani is gr8. Surprisingly the chicken momo served here is awesome, juicy meat filled. Good for light snacks and heavy food likewise, this place define the age old charm of gariahat, value for money.

After a recent shopping spree in Gariahat area, we came across this restaurant and decided to stop there for a late lunch. As the look of the place and that of the waiters did not inspire much confidence in me, we decided to settle for the good old Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. The quantity was sufficient for the two of us, and the chicken was perfectly tasty. Not that one can go really astray with Chilli Chicken. However, the rice was really oily, and the first thing that came to my mind was wishing that I could use a tissue paper to soak up the whole lot of it. However, hungry as I was, I devoured my share in no time at all, and my tummy felt strangely satisfied at the end of it. The place is very good value for money, and the bill, with a soft drink thrown in, came to only around Rs. 250 or so. Overall, a good meal.

Located amidst the busy streets of Gariahat, I never knew this place had a seating arrangement also. So, on a winter afternoon, with tired shopping legs, I went to do some light lunch to this place. 
We ordered butter naan, Paneer butter masala, Moghlai. Quality of food was good. But the service is too poor. They served the paneer, and roti came 5 mins later! The spoons and fork given were not washed. Yuk was my feeling. The water glass refill process is also an awaiting one.  
So, had it not been the reasonable price and proper food quality, I would have landed a 1.0 rating to this joint.

Located in the busy streets of gariahat, this place provides us a good meal at pocket friendly prices. Went here a month back. They do a really good job of providing a good seating arrangement in the small space available. They do an excellent job of maintaining their quality in both Chinese and tandoori dishes. They do an excellent chicken tandoori and a brilliant pepper chicken and tempura chicken. The fried rice was standard. The service was relatively prompt considering the rush of the festive season. Would visit this place again.

This joint is located just opposite to basanti devi college. Even though it has got a shabby entrance it stays quite cluttered mosy of the time considering as it is situated at the heart of kolkata's shopping paradise. And as we all know festivities keeps coming all around the year so does the shopping. So most of the times this restaurant is occupied by the hectic shoppers. I have been to this place quite a few times with my mom. They have two sitting arrangements(non-A/C and A/C). The exterior part which is just at the entrance doesnt have as such of any fancy and cozy decors. The air conditioned part is decently decorated and the ambience is quite soothing. They serve multi cuisine dishes ranging from north indian, mughlai and chinese. I have tried out almost every genre over here. But their mughlai paratha is the best thing among all other dishes they offer, thus the cravings for mughlai paratha finds justice at this joint.  Though 80% of  the dishes printed in their menu doesn't stays available most of the times. ButTheir chinese offerings are quite descent . Specially to name a few like pepper chicken, mixed fried rice, fish manchrian etc; are among their best chinese dishes. If you are in search of a moderate and descent restaurant to erradicate your hunger after a hectic day of shopping without making a hole in your pockect and nothing fancy or extravagance is in your mind, then this is an ideal place to drop by.

Today i had sweet corn chicken soup and fish fingers and also chiken chow(gravy). I dont know something happened to my taste or not but i didnt like any of the dish here. I have been here before but nevr had this kind of experience. The gravy chow was not good. and the sweet corn soup didnt have the pleasant smell. I was kind of like more of arraroot. Last time i gave  but for this time i will give 3.5.

1st time :

Went for dinner here.This place needs no intro..people near gariahat had atleats been here. Actually i was a bit early for dinner...so took coffee and fish finger...fish fingers were good , there were 5 peices and coffee was really good.. 

then after sometime we ordered dinner.we were 2 people. ordered mixed hakka noodles along with chicken dragon as suggested by the waiter. the noodles were good and was enough for two people and the gragon chicken was really good but was not as spicy as the waiter claimed.The waiter was very helpful and total we had to give 605/- because we took a plate of hakka chow home. very good place in terms of food. Love to visit again..often i come here but this time i m writing riview...good value for money....

Value for money,good food,easy on the pocket..to sum up-Its a good ol'favourite place visited and revisited very frequently..Mostly visited by shoppers and college goers.The entrance is little,squeezed among the other shops around,but it is cozy and comfortable inside.Service is good,waiters are ready to help but sometimes a bit late.Food is good here,be it the fried rice and and other chinese main courses.Their noodles taste good,though i have had only their gravy noodles. The chicken items are good too.You can check out their chicken wings,it tastes great..Among the North Indian dishes the special Mughlai paratha tastes good as well as the regular ones. But haven't tasted the rest of their Indian spread,though i expect them to be good as well,because the quality of food is quite good..Good for an evening's sip n bite as well as for lunch or dinners.You can always expect to get a place easily here unlike the other places nearby.Overall a good place :)

This place came recommended to me by quite a few friends so I decided to give it a try. It has an extensive menu and if you look carefully you will find some old time favourites hidden in their Menu.

We ordered a mixed bag of items from there today. Veg Hakka Noodles, Chilli Paneer (Dry), Boneless Chilli Chicken, Spl. Mughlai Paratha and Chicken Kabiraji Cutlet.

The Chinese items were mostly average, except the noodles which was very well prepared.

The Mughlai Paratha transformed me back to my childhood days in Calcutta. It came with a side dish of sookha potatoes, it was fluffy and eggy (though the version I remember from my childhood also used to have keema stuffed in it). But no complaints. The Paratha was excellent.

The Chicken Kabiraji Cutlet was huge! It was also equally delicious and not very greasy. 

The Mughlai Paratha and the Kabiraji Cutlet have all but disappeared from Menus of South Calcutta eateries, so it was delightful to find them on their menu, and even more rewarding to find they tasted so good.

The only reason I give them 3.5 is because the Chinese fare disappointed me. I wish to try more of their items and shall keep the readers here posted.

My club is a rare place where u end up getting all the core cuisines of kolkata . Be it the mouth watering fish fries , moghlai paratha  along with North Indian cuisines and also the traditional indianised Chinese .. So basically when you are in a mood to eat everything .. Head here straightaway ... I quite like the dishes they prepare they are not excellent but quite good specially the chilli prawns , chilly baby corn ,fish fries and moghlai paratha . Ambiance is not great but decent enough . A good place when you are low on pocket ..

If your in the mood for a Cutler , a Kabiraj or a Moghlai Paratha and your in and around Rash Behari area don't think twice just hear to The New My Club. I have tried the rolls on rare occasions and they are quite nice though a tad oily. Never tried the Chinese so my review excludes that portion of the menu. The Fish Fry is also not bad but my personal favorites are Chicken Cutlet and Moghlai Paratha. The Cutlet is nicely made with a good chunk of chicken and has great flavor. The Moglai Paratha is sinfully delicious .... served with a tasty alu subzi and fresh onion and cucumber salad its just heavenly. Most of the dishes are  priced between Rs.60 to 110 /= and portions are generous which makes it great bang for the buck. Don't forget to order a chilled Cola to wash it all down with. Eating here will make both your pocket and your tummy walk away smiling !

I was not in the best of moods when I hit The New My Club with IDG and S today. Also, I had just walked all the way from Golpark to Kalighat, and then back to Basanti Debi College, so I figured that I deserved to compensate for that energy loss, at least. So, enter me inside a portal where I was greeted like the prodigal daughter by a grinning old waiter. Our order was simple - Moghlai Paratha, Chicken Kabiraji, Aloo Paratha. 

S had ordered Aloo Paratha and the waiter asked if she wanted any side dish with it. When she said no, he proceeded to give her a generous portion of the dry spicy potato sabzi that came with the Moghlai Paratha on the side, so she could enjoy the aloo paratha with it. S loved the attention of course. So did we. 

The Kabiraji was HUGE, and yes, thankfully I had decided to split it with IDG so we were quite full by the time we finished it. Crisp eggs covered a generous portion of chicken battered and deep fried. Of course, its an oil extravaganza, but then again, KABIRAJI is all about whisked eggs deep fried in oil to me. The Moghlai was cut into small manageable pieces and was served with the quintessential duo - a dry potato dish which is served at room temperature and a generous helping of salad. 

After the meal, we needed to have some tea and coffee, so ordered them. The tea was a Strong, Sweet Assam, and perfection in a cup. And well, the damage, you ask? 310/- for the meal. 

Yes, I love the food.

Located right beside Ujjal Sir's coaching class, this place is a popular snack corner with students. Sir used to source the rolls from here for our annual Pujo treat. Once, my friends and I had to join another batch to catch up with a missed class and ended up getting treated by Sir twice in the same year. The rolls are quite good actually. Memories from schooldays!

A place I was introduced to by my father and my grandfather, this outlet opposite Basanti Devi College near Gariahat has no frills. Very popular with the college crowd, it is know for its cutlets, chops and rolls. Due to competition in the neighbourhood, they did up the place and made a portion of the restaurant Air conditioned although I must admit I haven't been inside the AC section ever! 

This place has been my pit stop every time I wanted hot egg chicken rolls on my way back from work. The paratha is well fried and crisp and is served with nice tender pieces of chicken, onions and lime and if you want it spicy ask the guy to put some chopped green chilies. The roll is heavenly and perhaps a few rupees more than its counterparts but is worth every bit of it. I have had their fish fry which is pretty normal but the fish butter fry does deserve a special mention. If I could give a 'roll award' to a restaurant this place would definitely deserve a mention.

My Club has always been the roll/kabiraji/cutlet/moglai paratha haven for my parents and me. During Bengali New Year and Pujos when we go around Gariahat for shopping, we invariably end up eating here. The place used to be dingy before with no AC, and has undergone a marked improvement in the last seven/eight years. The place is cozy and the seating/cleanlines/hygiene is better than most other restaurants of such a scale. There are three divisions to the seating - one without AC where prices are lesser, and the other two with AC, one being casual and the other for family.

The place has four to five waiters at max and you cannot miss the old one who adds a personal touch and smile while serving the hot chops and cutlets. My familiarity with the place helps me being greeted with a smile always. Service is quite efficient too. Though the menu here is quite varied comprising North Indian, Chinese, Kolkata street food, it is the third category that wins hands down. The special moglai paratha is thick but not chewy and mud like, filled generously with meat. The potato curry by the side also tastes good and does not not absymally taste of turmeric like most other places. The salad is cut fresh which adds on to the whole crispiness of the moglai paratha. Call me insane but I loved having their munchurian chicken with the paratha. It tasted brilliant. I believe the revamped My Club caters only chilli chicken, something I haven't tried there yet. The kobirajis and cutlets may seem a little exorbitant at first but when you see the size, you know why. The pieces are huge, thick, meaty and perfectly done. I have even lost count of the number of times I have hogged and gorged on the crispy fries of various kinds at this place. Yet I DO NOT like their other chinese dishes and biryani, so AVOID would be my suggestion on that note.

Also, they make really good rolls. I don't like the chicken inside my roll cooked in a curry but prefer the kebab sorts. The roll bread is not super thick but one that is chewable and crispy keeping the whole meat, assortments and dough taste in congruence. I have had their rolls after almost three to four hours, plain cold at home, and even then it tasted really good.

Basically visit the place in dry winters and wet monsoons when the Bangali heart craves for bhajabhujis and you will NOT go back disappointed! Also, NEVER FORGET to buy the thums up while eating here, after all only burps can help make way for more awesomeness. :P :)

For the last couple of weeks, I have a taken a fancy to Kolkata style chop, cutlet and rolls. The thing is that although there are many chop, cutlet and rolls corner in South Kolkata, they are just that, corners. Saying that there are too many restaurants in South Kolkata is definetely an understatement, but the deal is that there are too few restaurants where you can seat and enjoy the aforementioned chop,cultlet and rolls.

My Clubb opposite Basanti Devi college in Gariahat is one such restaurant, where me and my friend ended up on Monday It is a tiny little space with chairs huddled in close proximity. But it has a.c. The service is fast and friendly. 

Now coming to the food. We ordered the Fish Butter Fry, Fish Fry and Chicken Kabiraji. The Fish Butter Fry and the Chicken Kabiraji were both well prepared. The very famous "Tenida" would definetely have sang praises about them. The Fish Fry was a bit overfriend and could have been better. I noticed this place also serves basic Chinese dishes which I think are better to avoid. Our bill came to about 350 which was okay. Overall it was quite a satisfying meal.

A very average restaurant near garia haat opposite to basanti devi college. We sat in the inside air conditioned area but it was not very different from external sitting. The ambiance is descent, spacious and it has a capacity of 40-50 people at a time which is good. We were hungry and ordered fried rice and chilli chicken which came very fast, within 10 minutes. So this is what i liked about them. The quality was average. They cooked kolkata style chinese, lots of spices and gravy in the chilli chicken. The price is a little bit higher than reasonable.

One of the few restaurants along Rashbehari avenue which will not make your pocket bleed, My Club located opposite Basanti Devi Girls College has been around for a long time. Even though most of the items are overpriced, they are still a tad bit less costlier than the various boutique restaurants that dot the neighboring areas.The bengali dishes are a bit taxing on the wallet but are absolutely delectable. Top suggestions would be the Chitol Peti and the Tangra Meal. Steer clear of the Snacks section along with the eggs and the paneer dishes. The veg menu is a revelation and if you are not in a position to enjoy a good bengali meal at home, everyday dishes like the Echor, Foolkapi Kasha, Dhokar Dalna and Begun Basanti will make you smile. Seating is comfortable in the back AC section and ambience is minimum. 

Chakraborty Tip : The food takes long to arrive and the servers do not like to be hurried. Sometimes it's good to wait :)

This outlet is famous for its fish fry and i love their fish fries.... Ambience is okay and there is sitting arrangement. Fish Finger is also fine. I did not like their gravy prawn preparations...they also prepare crispy baby corn which is not that bad. The thai soup is also tasty.
Prices are quite reasonable and staff are friendly.
I would rate 3.5 for My Club.

I went to this restro because Hatari was closed on Nobomi during Durga puja.
This place looks like small but there are so many seats.
I ordered Chicken biriyani,Spicy Pepper Chiken, Fish Fry.
Chicken Biriyani was very bad. Did'nt like it.
Pepper Chicken was good. And Fish fry was really good.
Ambiance is just average.
Service is quick. Staffs are okay.
Price is reasonable.
Don't expect too much from this restro.
