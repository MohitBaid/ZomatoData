Orderd thali of 99 from office.expected good spicy thali.but it's so so simple I felt like I'm a hospitalised patient.dal was good,chicken was not fresh..the vegetable which was given was not having any taste at all..in a price of 99 you can get better food in Dada boudis Bengali hotel anywhere in Kolkata..Not recommend..

Yesterday we ordered lunch from here. I ordered 7 non veg regular thali of rs 95 and ask to deliver at 12.45 they were punctual but got confuse for the no of packets and delivered only 5. When I said I ordered 7 thali, the delivery guy said okay mam give me 10 min and after 10 min delivered rest 2. Staff needs some training how to take order on phone.
Now for food, this thali contains 2 pcs roti, rice, alu dam, chicken, salad, rayta and 1 sweet dish. Roti was like homemade, rice was also of good quality, alu dam and chicken preparation was not upto the mark, salad was fresh and rayta was awesome, sweet was not good, I didn't like it. Overall good experience at this reasonable price.

The rice quality, roti, raita and dal was good. The salad was okay. But the aludam was way too spicy and not good of taste. The chicken was hard and the taste was too light. The sweet was too sweet. In total good for once in this summer.

Look at the sealed packing! Amazing job team! Got tired of everyday cooking and decided to try the diet box. Neat portion, amazing homely taste, proper use of spices. Its sad that they close at 7pm. Ordering dinner would not be possible. But lunch was too good. The raita was surprisingly good! I am loving it!

Eating from Diet Box is a great experience. They serve food of high quality. I have ordered twice from this place and both the times they have lived up to the expectation. 

It is not only their food, the delivery service is also very good. They deliver within given time. 

The delivery guy however needs some updating. The first day I ordered the lunch box of Rs 95. After bringing the order, the delivery guy kept insisting that Diet Box does not have anything costing Rs 95. He insisted that I should pay Rs 125 for the food. 

I don't whether it had been a misunderstanding or a deliberate attempt of getting more money.

This is a wonderful concept of diet food, loved it and will strongly recommend to people who would like to have a good healthy diet. the service was good and it was not at all expensive costly roughly 130 bucks.
