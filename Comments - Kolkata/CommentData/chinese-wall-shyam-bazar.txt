Yes, the sitting arrangement can be better, but hey, I am not complaining. The prices are quite pocket-friendly. So anyone, including students can have a nice time here. The quality and quantity both are great. They even offer 'half-plate' option on most dishes. The owner (I think) serves himself and is very genial. His behaviour alone asks for 1 star.

Pocket Friendly, Tasty chinese food, well behavior. Thats all are catching point of Chinese wall. Their Chicken momo, Fried rice can easily beat few big so called big restro. Nothing about their decoration, bcz it is basically based in local area. But if u want to enjoy nice chinese food, then u must pay a visit there. U can take parcel also if u have any problem with their two side open ambience or non-AC floor. Must try.

It's a low-profile neighbourhood eatery. It's open in two sides and has a few tables with plastic chairs. It's a place for cheap Chinese food.

I went on Shasthi during Puja 2017 for my dinner after pandal-hopping. They had a one-page festive menu comprising of 4-5 items in noodles, fried rice, chicken, fish and paneer (Chinese) apart from biryani.

I ordered half Chicken Fried Rice and half Chilli Fish (4 pc). Service time was just 12 minutes. They served on thermocol plate and bowl with plastic spoon and no fork. I struggled to handle the fish.

The rice was below average. Though loaded with tender chicken pieces, it lacked seasoning. The Chilli Fish was a complete disaster! The fish wasn't fresh, it did not seem to be even basa and awfully lacked in taste and Chinese flavour. It appeared from the words of the man in charge (probably the owner) that they were struggling to maintain quality for some reasons.

I would like to give it another shot as it is inexpensive and offers half portions in sides (4 pieces) that suits a single diner, considering it was festive time.

A cozy open resturant. Seating arrangement of maximum 10 to 12. 
Located at Fariapuku, Shyambazar. 
The resturant serves mainy chinese dishes and rolls.
The quality and quantity of the foods served are kind of okay but that good. Only some of the items are good enough and can be taken as a home delivery.

Nowadays they take home delivery orders through Swiggy.

Very good food and price is really reasonable. In North Calcutta lots of Chinese food shops are there but this place doesn't compromise on quality. Quantity is also good and most specially the location is very good.

The food is really good and affordable. It's speciality being the Chicken Schezwan Chowmin. It's no doubt very tasty and will leave a long lasting impression on the person endeavouring it. Me and my friends have been as of now regular customers at this joint. It is small but the quantity and quality of the food is very good. Other dishes are also mouth watering.

This is a small eatery serving huge amount of food at affordable prices. If you want a heavy Chinese meal after shopping at Hatibagan at a cheap rate, this is the best place. Ordered half a plate of Mixed Schezwan Hakka Noodles, and struggled to finish it alone. The noodles tasted quite average, but was full of prawns, chicken pieces and egg. The prawn and chicken tasted well too. Also they have two options for all sides - 4 and pieces. This is a good option too. I struggle to finish sides serving 8 pieces most of the time. Tried the chilli chicken. It was decent.

Food is the positive point of course. But price has gone way beyond expectations. I m not saying they are out of reach, but for an eatery that has no proper seating arrangements , one cannot expect that hike on a sudden . This used to be my casual eatery, but I will think now.  Even the price tag is updated !  Kindly  check !

A very small eatery almost with no decor except some lighting. The good way to have food from here is take away.
The food is very good. We ordered a plate of momo, half plate hot chicken garlic , one plate of noodles and half plate of chicken fried rice.
What I felt apart from the good taste of the food , the quantity was huge. 
The best of all the items is steamed momo which just costs rs 45/- but it really gives a competition to the good chinese restros located in that area.
It was definitely worth a try and will visit the place soon for the other dishes.

Not so good food. Ideal for once in a while. I would reccomend not to go there with high expectations. The food is only okayish.  I will say not to go there for any kind of dining. It is best for snacks.

There are some restaurants which are so plain in attire that they don't draw much attention. But in spite of its plain jane look, Chinese Wall can surprise you. I have been a customer of this restaurant for last 10 years and till now this is probably the best Chinese take away in this area.

Quality and quantity of the food is fantastic and its hygienic too. With its varied menu options, pocket friendly items and cordial behavior of the restro owner (Goutam), Chinese Wall is highly recommended.

Minus decor, minus service, minus ambience. Talk food and there stands the chinese wall just beside fariapukur striker. I am mad after the preparation of this restro. whenever I am low or guests arriving in less than half an hour, the chinese wall is all ready to serve me. The must try item? The chicken lollypop. Correctly spiced and the sauté is amazing. The crisp chicken to team with it does all the spell. The gravy chowmein or the schezwan or@ the chilli garlic noodles is equally recommended. I love the garlic chicken they preapare and the dry chilli fish. People stating in and around shyambazar chinese wall is a must try.
