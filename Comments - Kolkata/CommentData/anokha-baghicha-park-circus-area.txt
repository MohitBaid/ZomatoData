We had ordered chicken handi biriyani..nd yes the order was delivered just on time nd it was as if it had just been brought out of the kitchen and served.the biriyani was one of the best ..it wasn't too dry nd the kabab type chikcken we're also soft and tasty.it came wid a raaita which was average.but I recommend all d biriyani monsters like me to try this awadi biriyani.definitely a try many more times .the amount is enough for two of them .nd it has 4 pieces of chicken.

Worst experience ever!! Never expected this type of bad quality... we used to order  chicken fried rice on a regular basis from tandoori delights (now name changed to anokha bagicha)  so today we ordered for one rice and it tasted so horrible that we could not serve our guests properly...everybody had their food half stomach... and I am dissapointed by the fact that my guests were not satisfied by the food that we ordered from here..so I have decided not to order anymore from here..bye anokha bagicha you have lost one customer..bad luck..
