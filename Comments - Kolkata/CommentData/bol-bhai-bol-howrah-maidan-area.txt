Food is good but the place is very small as well as not maintained to eat there ..prices are also good but they are backed by maintenance...

Just a road side dhaba. Just near howrah maidaan area. my workplace used to be there. And while returning back home all tired after a hetic school, me and a few of my colleagues would stop for a quick bite.Though I hate vegetarian food, its one of my favourite. Its such a crowd puller during the evening, but there are no proper seating arrangements. So that way it poses difficulty. It is excellent if one could just parcel it. Another issue is that if you are a hygiene freak, I would suggest you to stay off this place. But if and only if good food is a matter of concern and if you are really concerned about your pocket, then nothig better than this.the panir masala n panir pyaja is to die for. So highly recommended.
