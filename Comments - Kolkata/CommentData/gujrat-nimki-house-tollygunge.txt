কলকাতায় বসে গুজরাটি স্নেক্স এর স্বাদ পেতে হলে আদর্শ স্থান । নিরামিষাশী দের জন্য খুব ভালো একটি পছন্দের জায়গা হতে পারে । এক  নিরামিষাশী বন্ধুর তাড়নায় প্রথম যাওয়া ।  নিরামিষাশী না হলে বা নিরামিষ বেশ ভালো না বাসলেও এখানে যাওয়ার পর ধারনা বদলেছে ।

Gujrat is famous for their snacks and this place is one of the popular outlets which serves some interesting and known Gujrati snacks. Their thaplas are very nice to try which I tried for the first time here also the popular dhokla is quite a good option to go for. Also you get lot of varieties in munching snacks as well for keeping it back home to have it over tea coffee in the evening snacks.

A popular option for the vegetarian lovers, this place mostly deals in Gujrati Snacks. Their Khakkras and Dhoklas are two items, which really impressed me here. The service is quick and prompt, and being just a takeaway outlet, has earned a lot of reputation and fame for themselves.

Food-4/5
Ambience- NA
Service- 4/5 (Super quick. The person makes sure he serves quick but asks for preference of customer if needed)
Price-4.5/5 (Compared to the quality of food, the pricing is good)
Hygiene-3/5 ( Not best of the lot)

This is located very near to Malancha cinema hall which encounters a flurry of people after especially the evening show. The owner is fast and prompt. He would ask you your preference of heating kachori/ singara. The singara here has a different masala than the traditional Bengali type. Its different and close to been called a Gujarati samosa which is even blander and sweeter. Kachori masala is not the best but tastes good. Bhajiya, Khakra, Achar, Khatta Mitha Goli, this store has whole lot of stuff. Especially I like the garlic chutney which they provide.

Good value for money. Consider this to be street food with a little downside on hygiene.

Some sweets are lovable, some are not. 
Quality needs to be improved. 
You will get varieties of gujrati sweets. But it's average. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all.
