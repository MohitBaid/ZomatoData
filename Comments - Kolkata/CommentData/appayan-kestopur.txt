great taste.... specially DOSA and ALOO VADA tastes yummy. service is good.. though a small restaurant.. but hav six chairs to sit outside... and so quick in giving. For a good economical breakfast Â i recommend this resto... but one thing if u r taking away the food u have to come with poly bag or plastic.. as it gives the food in paper pack

Cleanliness is not great. Cook looks very dirty, unhygienic, wearing very dirty clothes & shop attached with public toiletðŸ˜·. But taste of dishes are fair. Not satisfied with Swachhta.

Why do I give this humble roadside joint 5/5? Because it does not disappoint. Appayan is a tiny roadside south-indian joint in Keshtopur. Ask anyone for Kalamandir wedding house, and this is right opposite to it. They open at 9 in the morning and close at 10 at night, every day of the week. Slow or no service in late afternoon.
So I am assuming you want to visit this place, and if you live in or near Keshtopur, this is a great place to relish some clean and simple flavours. I am not a big fan of south-indian food, but I have tried all their dosas. They are delicious and reasonably priced. But my favourite now is their Uttapam, a pizza like dish crisp on both sides and chewy in the centre. The cook is an expert, and a delight to watch. 40 bucks for a Masala Uttapam, 30 bucks for a Masala Dosa. Spicy sambar, plenty of coconut in the filling, lots of experience behind the grill.
Don't miss it when the opportunity presents itself.

The place will spark minimum expectations with its ambience and stature. One might as well overlook the place as a mere snack/fast food shop, but the food quality will blow your mind away the moment you dig in your first bite. The quality & quantity given at the price may only be challenged inside the parliament's subsidized canteen! Undoubtedly the best South Indian food joint in Kolkata. I would concede glory to the person who would prove me wrong!

The only place in keshtopur where I could find reasonably good idly, vada and dosa. Tastes good. Cost is worth the food served. No place to sit and eat except for few chairs put in front of the shop. Good for take away.
