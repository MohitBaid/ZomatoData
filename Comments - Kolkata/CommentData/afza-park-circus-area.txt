Nice food for the price offered, good place for authentic food, be it indian or chinese. We ordered online for chinese and it was delivered in 45 mnts . Massive quantity served for the portions ordered. Clear soup was perfect blend with veggies and flavor. Side dish of chilli fish was sumptous. Great experience. Thanks Guys
