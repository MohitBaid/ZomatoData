It falls on way to my elder brother's home and thus it became our favourite takeaway restaurant. From weekend get together to birthday parties, we bring food from them. Their north Indian dishes are just delicious. You should try their biryani.. it has low oil but the taste is intact. You would love their kebabs which are perfectly cooked with right spices. Give it a try.
