First of all the prices mentioned in Zomato are outdated. The prices have increased. 
The food is good and service is quick.
We had Chinese Bhel , Paneer kohliwada, Butter Naan and garlic naan. Do visit this place if you love indian food üëçüëç

If you are looking for vegetarian places to enjoy a meal with your family, this is it. This is thatvone place I always prefer to head with my family when we want to eat simple yet delicious vegetarian food. Recently that have renovated the place and it looks so amazing. The food has always been my favourite, no doubt and the staffs are quite helpful. The service is a bit late, maybe because it's always crowded. Overall a good place to have a good and hearty meal.

This is probably the best restaurant and price - to - taste ratio considering the location in which it is in.
However I would like to say that the menu displayed in Zomato is an older one and needs to change as the prices have increased now.

The quantity of the sabzi was also great. The food is very tasty and I would recommend all of you to have a bite here.
If you have complete dinner here (Tandoori roti and 2 sabzis) your bill shall not exceed Rs. 850 if a family of four is having.

Walked into this all time favourite vegetarian restaurant @Park Street. Some of my recommendations:
1. Chinese Bhel - Slightly sweet Slightly sour.. this favourite delicacy which is adored by all
2. Cheese Garlic Bread - You will be surprised to have this in a North Indian restaurant
3. Masala Pav - A brilliant variant of Pav Bhaji
And do not forget to end your dinner with Bombay Shiv Sagar special. An all time favourite...medley of ice creams and the music is phenomenal

Amongst all the happening places opening up in Kolkata, Bombay Shiv Sagar is a refresher. A simple decent vegetarian restaurant serving delicious food. This is not a place you would visit with your date or friends, but with family instead. Ambiance does not earn too many points, but the sheer taste and value for money is enough to bring you back. I do not have any complaints against any of the dishes here, noteworthy however are the pav bhaji, paper dosa, channa bhatura and Schezwan noodles.

Fooding is just amazing specially the babycorn,manchurian,chowmein and fried rice. Just try these out whenever you come here. Its a must visit if you really want to taste amazing foods. Normally a busy place as it is located in the office area and so its always full. Its worth an experience. A must visit for all!!

Though now this place is under renovation but food of this particular place is really awesome. A complete veg restaurant but mouth watering dishes. If veg items would be this much delicious then I won't mind to become a vegetarian. Pau bhaji was awesome. The bhaji  was just like mutton keema. And that giant cheese Dosa was also good. Love to visit this place once again after renovation.

Being a hardcore non-vegetarian, the very idea of visiting a pure vegetarian restaurant sounded extremely lame to me till I visited this place. It changed the way I looked at vegetarian food forever and have visited at least 10 times since. The interior is like any ordinary restaurant with huge sitting capacity, BUT the food here is nothing short of BRILLIANT and the service is top notch.
I brought my parents here for their 25th Wedding Anniversary dinner a couple of years ago and my mother wants to come back here every 2-3 months, such is the impact BSS has had on me and my family.
The Chinese Bhel served here is one of it's kind and most of the dishes are finger licking good and talking about a few of them will not do justice to the others!!
I'll keep coming to this place till it is there and I am sure, it is always here to stay!! üôÇ

Bombay Shiv Sagar is one of the legendary outlets that has stood the test of time. Its been there for more than a decade now and is one stop for all Chaats, junk food cravings. Visited this outlet recently and it looked like a dilapidated store which requires some immediate renovation. The building was also undergoing some construction which meant we couldnt eat in peace! There was a lot of sound of drills and the place was almost half broken. 

Well somehow we managed to sit on a not-so-busy saturday afternoon! And ordered the Cheese Pav Bhaji along with Veg fried Rice and Veg Manchurian. The Pav Bhaji took almost 15-20mins to arrive and by then we were drooling for food. But when it comes to taste the Cheese Pav Bhaji was excellent. Topped with generous amount of melted cheese the combo was fantastic.

Next the Veg Fried Rice and the Manchurian arrived. Both were not that great in taste. The Manchurian could have been much much better. The gravy was almost sour and bright red in color while the veg balls were chewy!

Overall, the place needs some serious attention in terms of ambiance and service. The chaats have kept the place going!

The Verdict:
Food/Taste ‚Äì 6/10
Service/Hospitality ‚Äì 5/10
Value for Money ‚Äì 6/10
Ambiance ‚Äì 5/10
Quantity/Quality ‚Äì 6/10
¬†
Needs some immediate attention else this store will go down in history!

Have been here many a times but today was a little disappointing!
The cheese pizza had sauce between the bread and the cheese, so it tasted not at all great! Had to squeeze out the sauce to have bites of the pizza. I recommend them to change their style of making pizza.
Chinese bhel was no doubt as good as always.

Sweet corn soup was a little too sweet towards the last few sips. Could see sugar in the bowl too.

I've not been a fan of this place. On my recent shopping trip in Kolkata, visited it because my son insisted on eating only Paav Bhaji. Well, he wasn't disappointed.  I didn't like the bhaji and found it sourish, but the others in our group liked it. Their ladi paav is very different from what I've ever eaten anywhere even in Pune, and this paav is the key to their signature paav bhaji becoming a hit. 
I ordered a mix veg soup which was wholesome.  Even their Paneer Tikka was good. Paneer used was soft and rightly tandoored.

Amidst all the noise , Bombay Shiv Sagar is known for its lip smacking food . A place where every individual be it a child or adult or an elder , enjoys the food that they order . I ordered a pasta in cheese sauce which was just perfect , paneer and chilly babycorn which was pretty fine just the baby corn being a little extra crispy . Garlic bread was tasty but the oregano had no taste at all .. and the fruit punch was an awesome cooler but the excess faluda in it made it difficult to sip it with a straw . Over all the food satisfied our taste buds ‚ò∫

Bombay Shiv Sagar is one of the most pocket friendly places. Starting with the food. It is just yum. Finger licking. And m sure whatever u order, u wont be dissatisfied. .. 
   One advice would be if u order chole bhatura then pls dnt be judgemental nd order an extra bhatura because the one served is too big and cant be eaten by a single person. 

 Being a family restaurant there are lots of kids coming in which does not leave this place quiet. Highly satisfied.

Pure Veg food ü•ò !! It's a hub of chaats, Deserts, NorthIndia food etc.. Chinese bhel is the famous item over here, who ever comes order that for sure.. Pocket friendly place! Worth the money spent on food..!! Service is fast also.

Bombay shiv sagar is one of those safe places where you can go and never regret. A pure vegetarian family restaurant which serves food that tastes good and is easy on the pocket too. Try the chole bhature here but hang on...do not go overboard and order extra stuff coz they are going to give u a super sized bhatura which one man cannot finish single handedly. Being a family restaurant you probably cannot expect peace over here...families pouring in with children! 
Try what you want over here and these people wont let you down. Half a point less for the overcrowding and fish market like ambience.

Went for second time but this time for eating biryani especially as my tasting buds were popping for the biryani from last week. But I was disappointed with the biryani I was served it was not at all biryani in any way lack of taste and magic of biryani, it was a pulao with mix vegetables and it was dam soggy,
Panner tika served with green chutney was decent 
Good place for a family dinner filled wid marwari crowd who are vegetarian. Place is overcrowded but in spite of crowd service is fast & prompt prices are little high as per quantity ‚Ä¶.

It's located just being Pantaloons, camac street on the 1st floor. A big sitting area. Not much decorated but kept simple. Mostly crowded my school or college students and office workers dropping by for lunch or snacks. The staffs are friendly and the best part, if you take some extra time to order food, they won't disturb you. So take all the time you need clear out all the doubts and only then order. First as starters we ordered crispy chilly baby corn. It was moderately spicy and crispy. In the main course we ordered malai kofta, veg au-gratin and tandoori roti. The gratin was extremely cheesey and quite heavy with vegetables. The malai kofta was sweet and tasty. Overall a good experience and looking forward for my next visit to try out some more veg dishes on offer.

A nice vegetarian family restaurant which serves yummilious dishes.
I went there with my family and ordered Pav Bhaji,Chola Bhatura and idli.
The quantity was good.
They do not offer beverages on M.R.P which I feel is unfair.

Bombay shiv sagar.
I have been visiting this eatery since my school days.
A very pocket friendly family restuarant where you will find all age groups from school students to senior citizens.
BSS serves only vegetarian food.
Mainly known for it's Chinese bhel,North& South Indian food.
The food served here is average if we compare it with north indian food that is served in the Dhabas throughout city.
They really need to work on their desserts specially the fruit cream which has less of fruits and more of nuts and jellies.
All together it is an average restuarant.
Dishes tried by me during my last visit were : masala dosa, crispy chilli mushroom,dal makhani,garlic naan, masala kulcha & chinese bhel.

Went to this place last week with my friend. It is situated on the 1st floor of the Pantaloons-Westside building which is very easy to locate. This place is quite spacious. We ordered Pav bhaji, chola bhatura. The Pav bhaji was really delicious, served with a lot of butter. The chola bhatura was ok. In dessert we ordered Fruit Custard with jelly and Ice cream and kulfi falooda. Those were mouth watering. The staffs were polite and active.

Onion Uttapam was seriously tasteless.. only thing great as an experience wAs the ambience and chocolate shake..! 
In order to maintain customer I would suggest them to maintain their taste

This place is certainly not the best place in terms of ambiance and comfort but the place offers huge seating capacity and is quite spacious. Been to this place many a times as it is very much pocket friendly and have tasted many of their delicacies. Almost every item in their menu tastes nice! Paneer dishes and the desserts are finger-licking... but their masala papad is not just worth it! The waiters here are quite cordial and the best thing about this place is the serving time post ordering is very less!¬†
Altogether, this place is an apt one for family dinners and parties, but if you r looking for a dinner date or a catchy place, don't consider this as an option.!!!
P.S: due to their large sitting capacity, the place tends to get noisy at times!!!

BSS  is one of my favourite family restaurant. 
From the wide variety it has in its menu to the extra large space that it has. 
The staff is very cooperating and prompt. 
In food - everything is good. 
Chinese bhel, Crispy chilli babycorn, fruit custard with ice cream,  spring dosa, pizza, etc. Everything is excellent. 
The main course for north Indians is also a good option.
Price wise- not at all highly priced.
A good blend of food and ambience.
Location is also apt.
Overall highly recommended.

This place is almost 18 years old and is famous for serving pure veg food. Top 3 dishes here according to me is Dhosa, Chola bratura and Chinese bhel. We have had these many times after college. People usually visit here after shopping in vardaan and pantaloons. Visited here again on v-day and it was decorated with red balloons. However there was nothing v day special menu like other Resturants. 
We ordered naan, mixy roti and aloo da pyaza. Everything was disappointing. Mixi roti tasted like naan only and was nothing different. Aloo da pyaza  was not up to the standard and the pyaaz was not finely chopped and lacked gravy. 
The only good thing was fruit custard with jelly and icecream which was loaded with cashews and other fruits and tasted delicious. 
Our bill came around 350 but the tax and vat made it 420 which was again disappointing.

The chow was great with a twist of taste. Paneer chilly was crunchy from outside and soft from inside. Overall taste of both the item was worth the price. The presentation of both the items were decent. The ambience of the restaurant is nice(nothing very unique).

Good place for a family dinner filled wid marwari crowd who are mostly vegetarian.
We ordered the masala pav,schezwan noodles,babycorn manchurian,masala kulcha and dal makhni.
The masala paw ws really tasty.It is a must try..highly recommended.
Bt the babycorn in manchurian was half fried and awful in taste.The staff changed it though and bought veg manchurian,which was also not good to taste.
Also,its speciality chinese bhel which I had tried the previous time I visited this place is also a must try.
Overall it was a good experience.
A must visit place if u are a vegetarian or on veg diet.

Being a vegetarian in Kolkata, this place is a part of my growing up, can't even count the number of visits made to this place. The North Indian is good here so as south Indian. But what I love here the most same as other people dining here: Crispy chilli baby corn and Chinese bhel, haven't tasty more juicy and better Chinese bhel else where. 

Moreover the icecream menu is too good, toti fruity, rocco brocco, pinapple and cream are the one's to try first.

If you are looking for tranquil dining experience to explore a particular cuisine....naaaah this is not the place.. This is a boisterous eatery that caters to a wide variety of taste seekers with its extensive menu.
Must haves- Paw Bhaji(Smooth And Buttery)
Chinese Bhel
Faloodas 
Crispy Chili Babycorn 
Cheesy Pasta(new arrival,cheeeesy)
BSS carries a very positive and inviting atmosphere and the service is quick.Prices are reasonable and do not hurt the pocket.
Above everything it excels at probably every cuisine it offers from Fast Food to South Indian to Chinese.

Being a hardcore non vegetarian.. I love this place for its veg food.. 
My best frnd being a jain.. I have also tried jain food there.. it was so delicious that it didn't feel that I'm having food without onion garlic..
It's located on the 1st floor of the block where pantaloons is located..
Staff service is quite prompt..
I love their signature item.. that ive been eating since the year they opened .. thats Chinese bhel
I have tried most of their north indian sabzi and naan!
Spring dosa.. Chinese noodles .. baby corn .. pizza are some of my must have items on my every visit!
Their rates are nominal.. quantity is much more for 3ppl.. 
One of the most favourite is their faluda Kulfi.. it's just wow!
Their deserts are also amazing .. good service ..
For vegetarians this restaurant is a one stop solution to get everything so delicious!

Chinese Bhel, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Malai Kofta are among the best dishes served here. Located at the famous Camac Square, this restaurant is sure giving many Legendary restaurants of Calcutta a run for their money.

The ones to introduce the Chinese bhel .. this place is all time favourite for snacks and main course. Anytime full specially the weekends . One can always wait for their turn . The Chinese starters are delicious try the Paneer69 and the manchurians .. the American choupsey dosa is also worth trying . The North Indian food is also good 
Anytime and always recommended

Have been visiting Shiv Sagar since childhood.. The location is very good.. Though it has a long waiting on weekends.. Love this!

Chinese bhel is the personality of the place and it has to be ordered always.. Almost everything from the menu is very tasty.. Punjabi food to pizza to Chinese starters.. And also happy staff..

The dessert menu is mattering much.. I always try the triple sundae ice cream and american nuts sundae.. 

A must visit!

One of the best family restaurants in the town. The service is quite slow but the starters are very tasty. 
Well known for its chinese bhel and maramari shake but it lacks in the indian dishes.

This place is very old located above Pantaloons in Camac Street Area. I came here long back when I was too small and was very rigid about my non vegetarian dietary needs. Still I remember liking this place. Came with my mom and tried the Papri Chaat along with Fried Aloo Chaat. All of them were pretty good. Never gave a second thought of visiting this place because it was strictly vegetarian. Hence.

I had this mouthwatering, devilishly buttery and absolutely delicious pav bhaji and chole bhature in a long, long time. Definitely the best I've had till date. 
We came here on a sunday evening and it was so crowded that we had to wait in line for 1 and half hours for our turn. At first, it was a little exasperating. But the food more than made up for it. 
Pav bhaji, chhole bhature, noodles and badam kulfi were the dishes we ordered for and each one of them were almost perfectly made. 
This place definitely deserves more ratings than it has now.

Good things first, great variety, quick service and clean and tolerable ambiance. 
Not as good as some of the outlets located in other cities. Pav bhaji was very average. Shakes were not that great either. Raj kachori was decent and so we're the south Indian items. Since this place should be having hygienic kitchens its a good place to have fresh juices. Can get very crowded at times. Highly recommend for a quick lunch

The other version of Haldirams to sum it up. They serve nearly the same thing, south indian and chaats mainly in focus along with other varieties too. 
Service is so slow that itself is a turn off. None the less is very helpful when you're low on pocket. Do try the sweet dishes, they're good.

Have been going to this establishment since two years now, the space features a massive sitting area, broken into categories of two seaters, four seaters, and group tables, the management and the staff members are quick and good, Coming to the food price is reasonable the quantity and quality ratio here is a fair one!

Have ordering their Chowpatty Chaats- my fav is Dahi Puchka, my other favorites are Cheese Paper Masala Dosa, Chole Bhature, their much talked Chinese Bhel, Fruit Custard with Ice cream, Strawberry King is heavenly, their Kulfi Falooda range.

It's on a much higher note compared to Haldiram's

Been to this place twice to have pure veg food...They have an extensive menu of North & South Indian items and also Chinese and continental.I find their South Indian food better. The sandwiches are ok. The pizza is made from store-bought pizza dough which I hate. I haven't tried the north indian menu which I have heard is good.
Overall I find the food is not worth it's price tag. It's good for pure vegetarians who prefer "only veg" restaurants.

Good place to have a quick bite at a reasonable price.   The kind of place where you shouldn't look for ambience but can be assured of a satisfying serving of a variety of good food. I have tried their dosas, sandwiches, chaats, kulchas and curries, pav bhaji, fresh juices.. Everything has been up to the mark.
Main thing to note is that it's a vegetarian place.

My favourite veggie stop for grabbing a quick grub. Dosa and dahi-wada are the first things one should try here. And the grilled cheese sandwich for breakfast is oh-so-yum! BSS serves everything from breakfast (the restaurant opens after 11 am), lunch, all snacks and street food and dinner. You also get amazing fruit juices and milkshakes. It is pure vegetarian heaven. Cosy ambience too. Nice place for outing with family and friends.

Quality veg food!
My veggie friend's tried and tested restaurant for a good meal, doubles up as a snack parlour during the evenings while shopping in the nearby markets. Though a tad expensive than the nearby stalls, you get the comforts of a.c., prompt service and a peaceful ambiance.

I am a regular in this area and although I don't prefer veg outlets my veggie friend drags me here usually. I have tried the Pav Bhaji(really nice), Chinese Bhel(huge quantity and tasty), Dosas(average), Crispy chilli babycorn(good) and various ice cream sundaes. My pick of the lot is Schezuan Fried Rice. I can have the one from here without any side dish. No proper meals for me from here, although my veggie friend approves of it. I'll go with him.
They also organise small parties and gatherings of around 50-60 ppl in a hall inside. A plus point.
It surely needs some signage on the roads as it is hidden from the view of people outside.

Another vegetarian paradise. Their menu card is quite extensive, so might eat up some of your precious time. Had heard a lot of praises about this place, but was mostly disappointed with the quality of the food. Had ordered for a Chola Batura, but the Chole tasted mostly bland. Lacked spices and could not excite the tastebuds. May be I will drop by again for a revisit, but until then, can only rate this place 3.0

I never thought I would get Mumbai style Pav Bhaji in Kolkata, but I was totally amazed when I had Pav Bhaji here. Simply amazing and totally worth the money. I also tried Chole Bhature here, taste of chole was lil different than usual chole, but it was tasty and bhatura is really huge, we couldnt finish it. Service is very good and quite commendable. So whenever I am in Kolkata, I make sure I visit this place to eat Pav Bhaji. I also tried Chinese bhel as per reviews but didn't find it that great...

The location and the extensive menu for vegetarians are the only 2 reasons this place works for me. Happened to be here on quite a few occasions and can safely conclude their service is going from bad to worse. Too many waiters standing idle but none will attend to you. Price is a little on the higher side considering the quantity. Taste is good in terms of flavours most of the times but it can get a little oily sometimes.

Will be a regular if they work on improving their service level

I have been here manier times and quite liked their food although they serve veg food but that's tasty. Me being a hardcore non vegetarian have a liking to their food specially the South Indian dishes are very famous here also to mention their Chinese bhel which is one of the popular dishes here. Service is very good and quite commendable. Nice one :)

Bombay shiv sagar is a classic tale of how things change over a period of time.
Visited on 25th June for lunch. And was pretty disappointed by the service and the quality of food. 
For starters we ordered Chinese bhel. The quality of the food was the same. However there was a significant change in the portion size, and the bhel was somewhat soggy and not crisp as it should be. 
The dosa didn't have its traditional "red paste" applied on it and was somewhat just average. The sambhar and chutney were decent enough for my liking. 
The waiter completely "forgot" the Cholla Bhatura. And I now regret "re ordering" it. The Chollas had lost their taste. They were pretty bland and had an off beat color to it. I was expecting the dark brown Chollas which they used to serve. Even the onions in the accompaniments platter had just normal onions rather than the pickled vinegar ones. 
The portion size of the Chollas, too were reduced.  
If my memory serves me right, they used to have 2 Bhaturas per plate. We were served one. We ordered an extra Bhatura. 
The Bhaturas were tough and had dripping oil (yes, I very well know Bhaturas are deep fried.) 
This place was one of the few veg restaurants I used to eat out at, pretty disappointed because this place had great potential.

One of the most popular local restaurants and my favourite too. They have maintained the quality till date which is really praiseworthy. Its spacious and is definitely suited for all type of crowds. Despite the cacophony, you're gonna love the ambience and gonna enjoy the food. Service is prompt and waiters are obsequious.
One weird thing about this place is that even non-vegetarians never say NO to this place considering its pure vegetarian. 
Considering the food,all cuisines are equally good and delectable.
Chinese bhel being my fav on the menu.
South Indian is amazing.
Italian is like just average. I dont like it much but my friends love it.
Chinese is decent. U won't get authentic Chinese flavours but they prepare it really well and it tastes real good. 
North Indian is a must try. 
Would Definitely keep visiting this place from time to time to cherish all my childhood memories and to relish my fav dishes on the menu.

Its purely vegetarian restaurant.Each and every starters were really worthy.The pastas were tasty too. The main course was hardly tasty. Makai roti specially i didn't like it. The dal makhani and baby corn dishes are not upto the mark. The worst part is the dessert - custard with jelly.. Though total experience is good.

Bombay Shiv sagar is among the oldest vegetarian restaurant around in Kolkata. The quality and price have been maintained very well. Situated in a prime location like Camac street , it is one of the top vegetarian restaurants around.

Food

Talking about the menu , the restaurant serves Indian, Chinese,italian and fast food. If you want to try dishes here go for

Hyderabadi Biryani - served in a typical handi, would get your stomach groaning the minute it is served. Served with raita which is typically sweet and with onions and pickle.

Navratan korma- Is typically sweet on the palatte, is a beautiful mix of vegetables and fruits in a white gravy.

Chinese bhel- one of the best dishes and the reason why this particular place git famous in Kolkata.

Chola bhatura- A big plate sized bhatura and chola which has a different taste. Total treat.

Hakka noodles - if you have no idea what to order ,fret not ,go for the noodles, light on stomach and tasty.

They have also added pasta in their menu just recently, you'd not really want to go for the added dish.

You can also try the Mexican pizza and the stuffed kulcha with kadhai Peshawar.

Food-3.5/5
Ambience-3/5

It's a classic family place. The place still stays housefull during weekends. The last time I went there it was because I was craving for Chinese Bhel. Unfortunately I went there when the place was pretty much vacant. So I had to face the so-many waiters staring at me for absolutely no reason. I might have taken their livers I thought. Still the food there never disappoints me.

Best place to go specially with family.. Huge dining area still during weekend have to wait in a long que... Vegetarians n those who have no onion no garlic food has one stop restaurant option.. Huge varieties from chat, South Indian, North Indian, Chinese, etc.. Few dishes one must try here are Chinese bhel, paneer Tikka, paw bhaji, Chola bhatura n biryani.. N desserts are all delicious spcly Faluda n fruit custard.. Even all sundaes are yummy... It's Gadbad (Tutty Fruity) is really yumm... Definitely a Must try place..

So this one is a huge restaurant with an ample seating space. Not very sophisticated but extraordinarily famous with all vegetarians and Jains. Has been there so many times. The food is good and has been the same since years. Special mention to Chinese bhel and tutti frutti ice cream. Service sometimes becomes delayed but the crowd that this restaurant pulls on Sundays and holidays is worth mentioning. Go to this place only for good veg/ jain food at reasonable price.

A friend from school invited us over lunch. The outlet is vegetarian.
their specialty in addition to other dishes was Chinese Bhel.
The Chinese Bhel was a good starter, followed by gravy dishes.

Yes I'm rating this place 1.5 because of what I experienced the other day. Went there on a week day . The place as usual was a little crowded . We ordered for veg grilled sandwich , dahi Wada , paneer pav bhaaji and tea . They first served Dahi wada which was unusually served in a very small dessert bowl , and to my surprise wasn't even sufficient for one person even. Then came paneer pav bhaaji, the most shocking thing was the Pav bhaaji was served with one pao ( 1 piece of bread) divided into two whereas in various popular places they serve two pavs divided into two . For this they charged 110 for a plate of pao bhaaji. I've personally been to so many vegetarian food joints but never seen pao bhaaji being served with one pao . Then we asked for tea which was mentioned in the menu ,for this they said tea isn't available .Nonetheless the staffs were courteous . The place should improve the quantity of the portion they serve. We don't mind paying , but the food and quantity should be worth it.

Satisfying a non vegetarian in a vegetarian restaurant is tough job ;) and Bombay Shiv Sagar stands well. We ordered  butter naan, dal makhani, paneer butter masala, jeera rice and kofte. All were tasty and quantity is also good.

You say vegetarians don't have options when it comes to food , just flip through the pages and you'll know that there are people who can work wonders with vegetarian recipes and with equal precision. Prompt service and a cheerful ambiance. Will always be at the top of my list of eateries. :)

When you have not reserved anywhere and you probably have no options left, then this place can be tried. I have been here with friends. Among the starters 'chinese bhel' is good but 'babycorns' aren't. Overall fooding experience can be rated average. The restaurant doesn't provide option to pack your leftover foods, so if you ordered extra it's going to be a waste. The restaurant remains busy throughout its operation. It's location is good. Interior set up and decoration is average. There is need for improving quality of food & service provided here. We generally believe that restaurants which serves faster are providing good service but this isn't totally true. Visit any of the 5-star hotel restaurant, then you will understand the difference.

This is one of those places which you may have been to a hundred times but still it wont fail to satisfy you with food that is drool worthy. One of the safest bets in the city be it lunch, dinner or evening snacks. The quality of their food is just top notch and the taste second to none. Add to that the fact that it purely vegetarian and yet so economical. I cannot really specify anything in particular for this restaurant. Be it north Indian, south Indian or Chinese everything is just perfect. Over the years BSS has become a brand and reached a level where you can't even think of getting a table here on Sunday without having to wait. Do give this place a visit - with family, friends or colleagues. And in case you have a sweet tooth, do not forget to try strawberry with cream. It is just delicious.:)!

The food is really good and wonderful. I cannot really complain about the food of this place. But I hold grudges with the ambience. At times, this place looks like a fish market. People are clamouring and shouting from every corner of their tables. Occasionally, you would find little kids getting hit by your knee since they keep running around. This place has become famous for creating loud noises. I think they should provide complimentary noise cancellation headphones for peace loving people. I was invited here on a farewell of my colleague who himself is famous for being a loud, boisterous and exaggerator. So you see this place is popular with hooligans like him. To cut it short, If u love authentic food amidst pandemonium and barbarianism, This is the RIGHT place to be.

Chrispy chilly babycorn, dahi puchka, dosa of all varities, chinese bhel, manchurian are all my regulars!
But what outstands is the strawberry king. King not just by name, even by the very taste!!!
Since they have more staff than usual, the service is very speedy and convinent.

Being a non-vegetarian, I rarely keep a track of restaurants serving pure veg food. Had been there on my friend's birthday.
The seating arrangement is good and the ambience is nice. However the place is very noisy and that is the only thing that must be looked after. (I think !)

Food quality is good. I loved the Onion rava Dhosa and Masala Chaat.

Basically a joint for vegetarians. Ofcourse a delight for them and Jain people so thumbs up on that. Decor is alright. Neat and clean, nothing special.
Now coming to food, since i have tasting these non bengali snacks and main courses coz i was brought up in West India like Gujarat and Mumbai so coming from there the food lacked that taste, still good though. Authenticity is somewat missing otherwise a good place to have that kinda food. 
Chinese Bhel seems a speciality here

A proper veg joint with a good ambience in Camac Street. The grilled cheese sandwich is a bang for the bucks because they put quite a lot of cheese into which makes it all the more yummy. The veg pizza was just about okay. But they serve real quick which is a total plus point. Overall a place you should try out once atleast because of their yumilicious menu at the most reasonable price.

Sasta sundar and tikau. If you haven't visited BSS, please do yourself a favour and go! Cafes will come and go but this joint is evergreen. It's buzzing with college goers and families at ALL TIMES of the day.
Panner tikka, Chinese Bhel and the babycorn are like ISO certified :P taste is so consistent! And yummy. No matter how many times you go, there are still so many items left to try. Don't miss the desert menu. The On the rocks section is very interesting.
Every time I think I should be bored of this place but I end up enjoying the meal anyway.

Perhaps one of the finest budget places in the city. I've seen restaurants sideline service and quality as they gain popularity, but Bombay Shiv Sagar is, thankfully, different.

Good variety, great taste, decent quantity, and fantastic service! No matter how crowded the place is, there's someone to attend to you to ensure your plates and glasses are full.¬†

I love their Indian food. Nan is thin and crisp (unlike the thick Maida'ish" feeling you get in most places). I've had atleast four types each of the paneer and aloo sabzis they offer, and I never had a complain. Dals are good too! Their Chinese is equally good. And of course, the evergreen Chinese Bhel that you don't get elsewhere.¬†

Been a regular for years now, and I'll keep visiting it. The place is too noisy, but of course, the people running Bombay Shiv Sagar can't do anything if diners have high volumes! Keep up the quality and service, and you'll remain one if Kolkata's favorites.

If you like fast food and the ambiance of a nice restaurant, this is the place. The menu offers a wide variety of street food across India starting from chaats to pav baaji. The menu is pretty good for a vegetarian restaurant. Located in camac street, this place is usually crowded most of the times. The ambiance and service is okay. The pricing is moderate. Visit this place for your love for the Indian food!

Unfortunately, Zomato doesn‚Äôt provide facility to give negative ratings so I have to settle down with a 1.0.

In a posh locality of Camac Street, BSS represents a sheer disgrace in the face of its food and its utter non-sense service. It displayed its greediness in taking in more people than it can serve and then provide them with service as if they are beggars and have come for free food.

Though it was a high time, my order consisted of the most simplest item that can be ordered in a restaurant: Plain Dosa. It was served after a total of 25 mins and to add insult to injury it was served cold.¬† On inquiring with the head waiter, he arrogantly replies that ‚Äúlook at the number of people here, ofcourse it will take time.‚Äù

I will definitely not visit this place again and would not recommend it to anyone.

Having visited to many restaurants, this place is one of my favourite because of many reasons:
1. Family Fast Food Veg restaurant so I go with my family when each of us want to eat different varieties of food and that too not at home
2. Parking and location
3. Food taste is very good
4. When u are not in the mood to go to a classier or quiet place, this place fits the bill
5. Friendly staff
But again, the crowd, genre, is very Marwari. So please visit only if u like such places.

Located on the first floor of block B of the commonly known Pantaloons building on Camac Street, Bombay Shivsagar, is one of those places always teeming with college kids and families. Have been visiting this place for the last three years for the delicious chinese bhel, pao bhaji, pani puri, dahi puri and the likes and have never been disappointed.

Expect service to be on the slower side but then they are consistent with it, they aren't lousy. Its noisy, too. But the yummy street food with the hygiene of Shivsagar is worth visiting again and again.

Tip: try out the cola float. There's nothing different. Just a scoop of vanilla ice cream on coke. Goes well with the food here.

Loved their Szechuan fried rice, it was medium spicy... Had it with chilli paneer which tasted good too
Topped it off with COLA float
I'm not into vegetarian food at all.. But yes it was good in here

Being a staunch nin vegetarian it was somewhat difficult to adjust at first in a pure Veg Restaurant.
It is located in the 1st floor of the Pantaloons mall,the seating area is huge and with a lot of crowd.If u go there in large groups it is reccomended to reserve a table first.
Among the starters we ordered Crispy chill baby corn,Hariyali paneer tikka and Chinese Bhel. The Bhel was just too good.
Coming to main course,we ordered Garlic naan, cheese naan, and kashmiri naan of which the Kashmiri naan was a disaster.The sidee dishes included kashmiri kofta,paneer butter masala and dal makhani.All food tasted so so,nothing too exceptional.
In the desserts we went for falooda kulfi,double scoop chocolate and chocolate with nuts.

The only negativity which we felt were it was too loud and the services were not prompt,for example we had to wait almost 20mins for the dessert.

Was at Bombay Shiv Sagar with friends and enjoyed the food. The Chinese Bhel was very tasty as was the papri chaat. Also paneer tikka was good,the flavours were awesome and the pudina dip was great. We had Mysore dosa and I really liked it. They were considerate enough to cut it in pieces and seve making it very easy to eat.We finished off our meal in royal style with falooda which was just yummy.üòã

Visited BSS again but this time not for lunch. The fact that this restaurant starts and serves breakfast,lunch,snacks, street food and dinner is a big bonus and advantageous to those shopping in the area...they get to eat street food in hygienic conditions and in AC ambience. The food is very tasty and this time too we were not disappointed at all. The snack items that we had were all tasty and delicious. The Chinese bhel here is renowned and lives up to its reputation. Too good. The dahi vada too was excellent, with soft vadas and lots of dahi.  The aalu chaat was somewhat different, spicy and tasty. Loved it. The idlis too were good. The fruit juices were excellent. Loved all the snacks.

A weekday lunch and we ended up at bombay shivsagar. It is located in the pantaloons building in camac street on the first floor. A pure veg restaurant with quick service and good food.

We ordered for sev puri, Mysore masala dosa and paneer tikka. The best out of the lot was the dosa which was really yummy. The paneer tikka should have been a little more spicy and the sev puri was just not upto the mark. 

The staff was courteous and service was quick and efficient. The ambiance is not much to talk about.

Overall you can go grab a quick bite here and without feeling too much of a pocket pinch. Our total bill was about 450 which is very reasonable.

I have tried their pizza, south Indian dishes, Sandwiches...culfi..custard, chana bhatura etc.... even though I don't visit complete veg restaurant quite often but its one of my favourites ... The place is quite big...with hindi songs playing ...the moment you enter someone will always be there to attend you...even after ordering your food you don't have to wait too long for your service...I really like their butter idli, Uttapam and ice cream custard ..... If you are in Kolkata and looking for some veg restaurant now you know where to go :)

We had to wait for 20 mins to enter this restaurant as there were people already waiting in line. This restaurant is one of famous vegetarian restaurant. The price is reasonable and the quantity was good. We ordered pav bhaji which was not that great as there was a lot of butter which took away the taste of pav bhaji masala and then we ordered Chole bhature the chola subzi was amazing so much better than what I have tasted in dubai the bhaturas were good but very oily. Then for dessert we ordered kulifi falooda, it looked very appealing and tasted good. if you are a vegetarian and are looking for a restaurant that meets your need, do try this restaurant.

I have visited this place many times and would have to say the food there is pretty good if not excellent
Talking about the staff they are friendly and helpful too. The problem is the ambience-the restaurant is a bit over crowded and remains noisy during peak hours. The problem lies in the seating arrangement as the tables are just too close to each other compared to other similar restaurants.
Coming back to food that's a winning point there as the food is of good quality and taste and the price is also on the friendly side
Talking about price-the right side of the menu has increased constantly in recent visits but I wouldn't say anything negative about that
The only reason I don't choose this place is because of the crowd which makes it a noisy marketplace rather than a proper fine dining restaurant.
Other than that its a good place for your regular visit and the food just makes it better

I love the food in this outlet. Cannot comment for the other outlets. Being a hard core non vegetarian I love their food. My all time favourite is the Chinese bhel. Although we didn't order it this time because it stuffs the tummy and I can't have the other dishes ordered. This time we ordered crispy chili baby corn, masala kulcha and a aloo preparation. The baby corn was deep fried more than necessary but the taste was good. Tue kulcha and the aloo was yum. :-)
P.s the only complain is the dishes are a bit too steeply priced..

One big problem,  the constant noise of the the cutleries. The service desk is in the centre of the restaurant which constantly keeps disturbing.

This place has been dishing out vegetarian marvels since I was a kid, sadly though the state of affairs are on a downward spiral. 
Visited the place a few days back and to my utter disappointment the best thing among all that i had ordered was the juice. 
The following were on my table:
‚Ä¢ Masala dosa - It was as good as it should be at restaurant of its stature, but then again when you're paying a premium you expect the food to be equally good as the ambience. The premium is not just for the place, right?
‚Ä¢ Idly - The idly wasn't steamed enough, had a very grainy texture- almost raw floury taste.
‚Ä¢ Veg cheese sandwich - decent but not great. Simply edible. The overall taste of the sandwich did seem to lack coherence. 
‚Ä¢ Maara-Maari Juice - this was, by far and large, the best out of all that we'd ordered. A combination of pineapple and mosambhi juice. Good stuff! 

Overall a decent place for a decent vegetarian fair- massive room for improvement both in the ambience and food. Perhaps if you like chinese bhel, go here! That's apparently their USP. 
cheers!

Was at Bombay Shiv Sagar yesterday for a late lunch. It was nice to be back there after a while. Their masala paw and pizza was amazing. I actually prefer such pizzas over the American kinds. The cheese is perfectly grilled. The staff was polite and courteous to us but amongst themselves they were loud and rude. In fact they were even talking about what they would eat for their own lunch! :P 

Only the falooda was a complete disappointment which was sad because this place was very popular for their falooda in Calcutta. It was extra sweet even though I'd stirred it well and the other ingredients seemed a little weird too!

This place is always on our list every Saturday for lunch. The ever present crowd is a sure indicator of their quality of food+service.
Have almost tried all of their South Indian fare including offbeat dosas such as Chopsuey Dosa (amazing flavour) and Palak Masala Dosa (generous spiced-spinach puree with usual masala). All the dosas taste amazing and are quite filling.
The most popular item on their menu seems to be the Chinese bhel which tastes great. The proportions are huge and can be easily split between 2-3 people.
Their beverages are good too, nothing extraordinary.
Their desserts are good too with a special counter dedicated to it!
The pocket pinch is decent when compared to the quantity.
Overall a great joint, albeit vegetarian, to eat at when shopping near Camac/Park Street.
Really want to try their Indian/Chinese fare as well!

go there only if u are a veggie... expect queues as if its the only restaurant serving veg.. chinese bhel is a speciality .. but everything else is average and its over rated since day one. not very expensive. ¬† ¬†my wife is a big fan (veggie) and i avoid it as much as i can . oily food (mostly)

This place used to be one of my favourites about a decade back but has changed quite a bit now. I used to regularly visit here for the Chinese Bhel, the Veg Biriyanis and Paneer Lasuni. But although they still get the crowd in, I don't find myself enjoying their food as much as I used to. They haven't brought in anything new to the menu and somehow even the taste of the my old favourites seem to have deteriorated. The staff isn't gracious and you have to literally screech at them to get their attention. The food takes an eternity to arrive which makes you highly irritated. Nevertheless I give it three stars for still having some quality left. Hopefully, they will improve in the coming days but that is highly doubtful given that they still get in good numbers; primarily because of their location advantage.

A very good place to go with family or friends. The place is well lit, the decor is pretty nice and the staff is good & courteous. I always went there with a group of friends. And today we ordered tomato soup, crispy chilli baby corn, chinese bhel, hakka noodles and chocolate milkshake. The bill was not much and quite reasonable.  The food was tasty and the experience was good.

Desert Section is also good enough with variety of custard , sundaes , jelly & fruit cream to choose from. Overall its easy on pocket and on stomach too.

One item that you have to try here is their strawberry cream. It will simply blow you away. Other than that, their pao bhaji is simply awesome. Chinese here is highly indianized ofcourse, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a family restaurant. Have always had a good time here.

I have been visiting this place since a very long time. The food tastes good. Crispy chilly babycorn and American choupsey is a must try starter. Being a pure veg. Restaurant, it attracts a lot of jain crowd. For desserts, wedding special and strawberry with cream is a must try.
I would not recommend this place if one is very hungry and in a haste. Standing in long queues especially on sundays are very tiresome and irritating. Once, I had to wait for around 2 hours in the queue.
Else, this place is good.

I went to this place once a couple years ago and didn't quite like it. The ambience is the only thing good about this particular restaurant. The food is very ordinary and there is nothing very new and lip-smacking about it. Slightly overrated restaurant. I had South Indian : Idli with chutney, which tasted stale and Dosa which tasted like one from any roadside dosa vendor. Nothing special about it. If you're a vegetarian, try Gangaur in Park Street, which is leagues ahead of BSS.

I would not recommend this place to anyone.

A mecca for vegetarians if there is any in kolkata.  This place has a huge variety of dishes and almost everything is very good. The pav bhaji is amazing and the chinese bhel here is seen ordered on all the tables. The north indian fare is also very good. Tge only thing that I don't like much in this place are the dosas. Somehow I feel that there are much better dosas available elsewhere. That said it is a great place for a family outing or friends looking to eat something.  I absolutely love this place.

I love vegetarian food! Period. 
And Bombay Shiv Sagar is a pure bliss for vegetarian food lovers. Located in 22 Camac street area on the first floor, during weekends it's super difficult to even get a table and one has to wait for more than 15-30 minutes, such is their popularity. 
The food & drinks they serve is top notch and brilliant. 
I love their baby dosa platter, their cheese dosa and their chole bature from the snack section ! Even for lunch and dinner they have extensive every imaginable vegetarian choices and I love their breads ranging from super greasy buttery nuns to kulchas they make them all! The drinks mostly the fresh lime soda or some freshly squeezed juices are a must try, but I think the sweet line juice is definitely the best. 
Bombay Shiv Sagar has efficient staffs who is super attentive, takes orders swiftly and serves you food very quickly! This is one place which doesn't need to change because more or less it's perfect. I would really like to see them opening another outlet especially in the Ballygunge area!

Neat and clean , nice ambience, right in the Pantaloons building @Camac Street, a very good vegeterian restaurant. I am a big fan of their South Indian delicacies - sambhar vada, idly and dosas. Love their candid serving of the sambhar and chutney. Very good filter coffee too. But this is not even a specialized South Indian restaurant , mainly all things Indian. Try their Dahi vadas and crispy noodles.

Went on a hot sultry weekday afternoon with an old friend during lunch hours. The place was packed to the brim to my surprise. Interiors are cosy and the seating is comfortable. But only grouse was that the place was too noisy.The menu is quite exhaustive and the usual staple North and South Indian traditional fare. We ordered the Veg Zhal frezie, Paneer Dopiyaza, Tandoori roti and mausambi juice. All the items were well prepared, food presentation was decent too. Amongst all the items the Paneer Dopiyaza stood out and took the honours hands down. It was yum to say the least.Since we were catching up after ages it was almost 4.Since it was tea-time we ordered coffee as well .It was also well-made though nowhere close to The Madras Filter coffee that I freak out on.Prices are moderate, service is attentive, staff are courteous-my friend being a regular also¬†helped. :

Have been here several times with both family and friends. The food is so good that even my usually non veg loving friends don't mind eating out here.

I love both the North Indian and South Indian dishes here, though crispy chilly baby corn is my all time favourite! I personally wouldn't recommend Chinese and Chaats (except, ironically, the Chinese Bhel! ) unless someone is very particular about going to a veg-only place. Keep an eye out for the chocolate sundae, it is heavenly. All in all a great place for a quick bite.

Its probably quite old and don't look like maintainance fall in their primary importance. Very affordable and wide range of food. I tried the cheese plain dosa and onion uttpam with starters as chilli paneer. Of course they are not to be blamed for the below average chilli paneer which was quite chewy as well. After all they are a south Indian based restaurant. The cheese dosa was not completely satisfactory but can't complain. But the onion uttapam certainly matched the expectation. Good place for a fast and filling bite. If maintainance had been better, the experience would be a little different... Cheers..

Located in camac street this place serves one of the best babycorn in town..
Their babycorn are tossed with paneer and have a balanced flavor..
Their chinese bhel is also worth a try...
It has a perfect family enviroment..
You can also arrange for small parties and get together here..
Their hall can accommodate 50-60 people comfortably...
I happened to attend a get together there and kudos to them for managing it efficiently..
Food served was delicious and hot...
But the standard of food was not at par to what they serve in their restaurant....

Bombay Shiv Sagar on 22 Camac street has a demographic advantage. Easy to reach, economic and value for money, this is a place to go if you are craving for Indian Cuisine.

Went to Shiv Sagar when I had been in Kolkata for a couple of days. I totally loved the ambience, service and the food. I completely gorged on Jeera rice and gobi manchurian. On other occasions Pav Bhaji, smoothies and other chats¬†

Good place to be in with friends and family

The only place where they serve crispy chilli baby corn that is actually crispy and chilly.
The chocolate milkshake is exceptional, one of the best that I ever had. It was so delicious that I alone drank two.

We ( me and my friends ) did not order roti paneer and dal, instead we tried different things from different cuisines.
The Chinese bhel was insanely good. 
The noodles were ok, nothing that great. I would recommend you to refrain from ordering mushroom manchurian and a hot dog, they were one of the worst things that I have eaten in my life.

The staff weren't that courteous, some were busy talking amongst themselves while others simply didn't care. I would recommend you to order everything you need at once.

The cost was about 500 per person.

I wasn't able to try their chaats and chola bhatura, would try them on my next visit.

If you do go, definitely order the Chinese bhel, baby corn and the chocolate milkshake.

Cheers! :)

The main course consisted of paneer butter masala,malai kofta,dal makhni,butter nan and masala kulcha..(however,kofta not recommended)the dessert was a combination of falooda kulfi and fruit custard..:)

I'm not that much fond of vegetarian food when it comes to eating out. But Bombay Shiv Sagar changed my perception. Yes, vegetarian food can be really yummieeee :P :P The crispy baby corn, mixed fried rice, mushroom manchurian and daal makhani were extremely tasty.. Special mention of the pineapple raita.. It was woooow.. I wanted to try Chinese Bhel, but my stomach was overfilled for it.. ¬†¬†
Moreover the lunch there was awesome and I will surely visit that place over and over again :) :)

This place mostly remains crowded whenever i have gone here. Being a veg restaurant it manages to serve all kinds of cuisine under one roof. Starting from tandoori to south indian to chinese to italian pizzas. They serve really good ice creams and drinks as well. The taste of food is really commendable. The location of this restaurant makes lot of college and office goers come to this place. A good veg restaurant overall. The service is also very quick and its quite reasonable as well.

Location: Camac Street. 

Located above the Pantaloons and West side building, this place has got quite a great level of food to offer and the quantity is generous as well. 
You'll find it always crowded and you might need to wait a bit until you're seated. 
The ambiance isn't anything to be excited about, is simple. 

Went for a family dinner, being eight in number, ordered the following: 

- Bhel Chaat (do not remember the exact name, sorry)
The chaat was nicely prepared and had the right balance of spice and sweet. was a mixture of peanuts, split gram, chana, puffed rice, papdi and sev. Tasted decent.

- Crispy Paneer and Babycorn:
Prepared just like Crispy Chilli Babycorn; the fried cubes of succulent paneer, well marinated babycorn and capsicum were tossed in sichuan sauce. Tasted decent.

- Chinese Bhel 
Crispy Noodles tossed with spices and veggies in Indian style.¬† 
Loved it. 

- Schezuan Rice 
Was a slightly sweet. :-\ It was supposed to be spicy. Sad. The spice level was quite low. 

-¬† Idli
Melt-in-the-mouth type idlis. Tasted good.

- Crispy Schezuan Dosa 
Thought of ordering this after reading a review by a fellow foodie. :-) And trust me, it was absolutely delicious!! 
Highly recommended. I would simply say, try it rather than explaining what exactly it is. 
One my favourites now.

- Set Dosa
Thick and Sweet, crisp at some portions and soft on others. Nicely prepared. Tasted decent.

- Paneer Tikka 
The Paneer cubes were soft and succulent along with the right amount of spice mix, tandoored to perfection. 

- Dal makhani 
Absolutely delectable. Black lentils cooked overnight, and mixed with the right proportion of spices. 
Recommended. 

- Paneer Butter Masala 
Utterly Butterly Delicious. Melt-in-the-mouth Paneer cubes tossed into the gravy which tastes absolutely delicious. Tastes great. 

- Garlic Naan 
Perfecto!! Right amount of garlic topped on the bread, soft and brushed with butter. 

- Butter Naan 
Soft and perfectly baked, served with a generous brush of butter.

- Soda Sikanji
Had the right balance of sweet and salt. Tasted good and was refreshing.

The service was quick.¬† 
Pocket friendly prices. 

Overall a decent experience. 
- A revisit remains due in order to get concrete on my review and try the remaining fare on offer.

This place is the first choice for all vegetarians in kolkata. This is the most reasonable restaurant in camac street area. The dishes are tasty. The restaurant is well decorated with decent ambiance. 
Snacks are like Chinese bhel, pav bhaji and dosa, koolfi and baby corn are the best items in the menu.

Have visited this place several times & found the food & ambience quite decent.The North Indain dishes are good but some of the Chinese dishes are not up to the mark.
We had ordered Mongolian.....not too sure of the full name (chinese) & fried rice.The Mongolian dish could have been much better since the gravy was ok but the balls were tasteless....in terms that the gravy was not mixed well with balls.Watermelon juice is an all time favourite here.

The only disappointment and a major one happened during this visit.We asked for the bill & the same was presented.I chose to pay with my credit card.The waiter saw that the same was a chip & pin card & asked me to share the pin.I was really shocked by this demand & refused to share the same.

The management of BSS sould really rethink on the same & should instruct their staff not to indulge in seeking pins from the customers.

Wouls also request zomato to update the menu & prices for BSS since this is an old one.

Very nice,snug restaurant on Camac street. In my opinion their USP is their price-quality relationship. The only complaint I have is that service maybe a little slow and the bearers do not oblige to all your requests. All in all a good experience for decent veg food. Oh yes for all the foodies out there, try the cheese bhaji with cheese dosa, its mind blowing.

Visited BSS yesterday for lunch. We had to wait for a long time before we got a seat. The service wasn't upto the mark and the staff weren't entertaining the guests properly. However, due to the huge rush, they were kept busy. Had ordered the legendary Chinese Bhel which lived up to it's expectations. The lassi was thick and sweet, heavenly for the people who have a sweet tooth. The malai kofta was average and the paneer tikka masala was really tasty. However, the restaurant isn't cheap. The dishes are over priced.
In Kolkata, there are very few, good pure vegetarian restaurants and this is one of them. If money isn't a problem, definitely give it a try.

Last evening , my partner took me here for the day's surprise..
Situated in the Pantaloons-Westside building on Camac St, this is easy to spot. On entering, this is a huge place..ample sitting arrangement and bursting with people talking loudly all over the place and the staff busy trying to keep up with the service. We settled down and browsed through the menu.. they have got a great number of items to offer.. from street food to Chineese to North Indian to South Indian. We wanted to try South Indian so we ordered one Tava Idly and Dhania Masala Dosa, along with Kaju Anjeer Shake and Fruit Custard with Ice Cream.
The Tava idly was very different from what we usually get.. it is like a pav bhaji, idly stir fried with the pav bhaji masala. Tasted nice.spicy tangy. We liked it.
The dosa was also good. a spread of dhania paste on the inner side of the dosa and the masala was much better than what we get in most places. The sambar was thick and spicy, chutney very average.
The shake was very thick and very heavy.Tasted yummy.
And the fruit custard.. it was a very basic homemade type with lots of fresh and dry fruits. I really liked the taste.
By the time we finished,  we were too full. The bill came at  Rs 364, quite decent for the amount they serve.
Very satisfied with this new discovery of my partner. The variety of items on the menu is fetching an extra "half-point" from me :P 
Going back soon.

for me and my family which are a bunch of vegetarians this place is the best for some kind of snacky dinner plans that we have... located in the middle of 22 camac street this place is ideal for people who are coming to chill at not a expensive price... 

from the bombay shiv sagar fame this place does not let us down with the Paw Bhaji and the sandwiches.... for me calling for the chinese bhel is a must as i have been doing for all these years.... it is a tangy fried noodles with the local masalas put into various chaat... sort of a fusion which is like really good here and fresh....

the other items like south indian and north indian is good but not that great and there are place better than this to have from.... but for chaat and a chilling time this place is pretty good and no food here is bad.... so that is an upper...

there is a dessert here which is served only is summer from Alphonso mangoes which is a must try for all mango lovers...

as for decor this place could do more but the comic wall is really good a sight and fun to see.... more so the place is really big and the chit chat noise is on the higher side... 

given the size of this place the waiters a re a little tough to catch and they some times skip on you totally... if you are lucky the owner might be there which is a normal sight and he makes sure that the whole place runs like an well oiled machine...

all in all the paw bhaji wont disappoint you and this place is a sure shot winner when it comes to a casual dinner or lunch setup...

Bombay Shiv Sagar is a heaven for all Vegetarians. It's always flooded with people starving to eat good vegetarian food. The best thing about BSS is their huge menu and the variety of options available. The Chinese Bhel is one of my favourites. Chowmein and Manchurian are enough to satisfy a persons taste buds. I love the North Indian that they serve especially the Garlic Naan and the Cheese Naan. I have no complains with BSS except for the ambiance and the noise in the place. Otherwise, I am highly satisfied by the service and the food.

Bombay shiv sagar located at the convenient location of 22 camac street is a vegan's place to be. I have been visiting this place since a long time now.This place has a tradition of having a long waiting if u go at the dinner time be it any day of the week. The ambience is good except for the loud noises of chit chats u normally get in a vegetarian restaurant. The starters are awesome especially the chinese bhel,snacks like chole bhature and pav bhaji are also worth a mention. Now coming to the main course unfortunately every sabji here is extremely sweet in taste but the dal makhani is good. The desserts are good especially shiv sagar's patent faluda. A good place to visit once in a while. 3.5 stars from me.

This is a perfect place for vegetarians or for people who are in a vegetarian mood. The place is mostly crowded on weekends and you would be greeted by a long waiting queue if you do not reach early .On weekdays you would mostly find yourself amongst a kitty party group. The ambiance is pretty decent. The service is quick. I have visited this place ample number of times all thanks to my vegetarian friends. I almost like most of their dishes though my our order mostly consists of pav bhaji,chinese bhel, chole bhature, plain sada dosa, crispy chilly babycorn and koolfi falooda(which is the best).
The prices I feel is moderate considering its just a vegetarian joint. A nice place for a change but nothing exceptional.

Yet another visit today to bombay shivsagar.We ordered for chinese bhel,crispy chilli babycorn,chilli potato dry,paneer tikka,crispy schezwan dosa,stuffed tomatoes,dal makhni,garlic nans,butter nans and tandoori roti. Everything ordered was amazing minus the stuffed tomato,which had just one tomato and i couldnt find any stuffing in it,also the gravy was far too sweet for my liking.The stuffed tomatoes were very disappointing!
Otherwise a good experience .Our total billwas 1227 after tax.Decent prices. 
Uploading images for the items i personally tasted. :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bombay shivsagar is an all vegetarian family restaurant located on the 1st floor,block D of the 22camac street property.
The place is very big and is ideal for parties.Another special feature is the banquet hall for functions,which is booked almost always.The restaurant is no less,always full,brimming with high energies.Yes,sometimes this place gets loud,but the food comforts you always.
My first order here has to to be their famous,chinese bhel-crispy fried noodles in tangy sauce with bits of tomatoes,onions and spring onions.
I am also in love with their crispy schezwan dosa,which is an absolute favourite.
Their pav bhaji is okay but i love their chola bhatura.The cholle are made in a yellow gravy unlike anywhere else.It is just wonderful and the bhaturas are big .
For indian i prefer dal makhani, paneer pasinda,nargese kofta,chana masala,kadai paneer,veg hariyali.The breads here are just wonderful and my favourites are the pudina paratha and garlic nan. Also their dum handi biriyani is amazing,sealed to perfection,spicy yet excellent,served with curd.
Everything on the menu is amazing and vegetarians are spoilt for choice here.
For desserts they have a good menu of icecream based desserts and i have tried their tutifruiti and it comes close to the ones i love the kwality(park street).
The shakes and juices here are also just wonderful and my favourites are strawberry shake,chikoo shake and orange juice.The juices are prepared fresh :)

I love Bombay shivsagar and would definitely recommend this place.

Bombay shiv sagar had been a place where the entire family used to land up on almost every occasion. The main highlight of the place was that it was the "100% pure vegetarian" place. 
However, as I grew up, our visits lessened and eventually it stopped totally. 
So few days back I decided to go back to this place and check it out again. 

The place was exactly the same as I remembered. The tables and chairs were the same old and so were the plastic plates. Nothing changed. 

The place serves amazing Chinese bhel, paneer tikka, baby corn, paw bhaji, n the usual Chinese staples. 

This time we ordered paneer tikka, baby corn, cheese paw bhaji and mango milkshake. 
Had to give the Chinese bhel a miss since we were just 2 and the portion is pretty huge. 

The paneer tikka was absolutely amazing. Properly marinated cubes of paneer served on a bed of salad. We both loved it and were looking forward to the rest of the things ordered when the baby corn was served. It tasted BAD. I don't have any other way to put it in. 
The baby corn wasn't crispy and it was a little too oily for my liking. 
The cheese paw bhaji was okay at it's best but the mango milk shake was amazing with pieces of mangoes in it. 
The bill came to 600 bucks for this and I think, minus the baby corn it was worth it.

The location of the restaurant is good, although the food and the ambience is average. Chinese bhel and baby corn chilli is good among the dishes served. The place is too chaotic and noisy. Overall an average vegetarian restaurant which could be better.

This place is average at best. I would not come here for the dosas or idlis. Neither would I visit for the shakes and so on. If I wanted chat or shakes I would step out of this place and walk over to my favourite Agarwal's Pav Bhaji or Shubuji's. I won't be seated in an air conditioned room on fairly comfortable chairs but so what. When it comes to chats the fun is on the streets. The service and value for money here are not exceptional so if I wanted good dosa or something I'd go to Banana Leaf or some such place. I have been here a couple of times and my experience was okay. I was hungry and I stepped in for a quick bite (which wasn't as quick as I would have liked.) I won't be going back unless I really have to.

Decent place nestled at block b 22 camac street. Maybe a tad difficult for someone to find it the first time. Or maybe even the second time.

Standard vegetarian fare. Tasted fine but I think prices could be a bit lower. For me it is the quickest option if I miss lunch at office nearby.

Arguably, one of the best low cost vegetarian joints in Kolkata. The Chinese bhel, paneer tikka, lassi and many other dishes are amazing. It's one of my personal favourites. Though it might not classify as fine dining, it's still a great place to eat in. Highly recommended if you are looking for a low cost vegetarian meal.

A nice vegetarian place where even meat lovers (including me) can gladly go and enjoy the good food on offer. Simple decor, comfortable seating and really efficient service here. Thisis a place where you can really experiment with the menu and yet be guaranteed a good meal. Watch out for the Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Chhole Bhature, Pav Bhaji and their special brand of Lassi. The North Indian fare is spot on too, and a visit to BSS is incomplete without tasting their brilliant Chinese Bhel which has converted many a skeptic into a fan.

All those who know me are aware that I am happily and completely non-vegetarian. A meatless dining experience is not something I particularly relish. BSS, however, is a restaurant I would gladly patronise every day, every meal all my life if I weren't worried about my cholesterol levels. Introduced to it at a birthday party, I have never ever stopped loving it.
As a school kid I would come here quite often for their pav bhaji with extra pav. It's easily the best I've ever had - unlike most versions, their pav is soft and buttery, with an even more buttery bhaji. What's not to love! It's still my favourite item there. Apart from that, the chola bhatura is absolutely top-notch, and I ADORE the Chinese bhel. 
After serveral visits, I decided to try their North Indian fare, and ordered naan, chola and paneer butter masala with a friend. And surprise! It was excellent! As good as I've ever had! 
Every single item here, basically, is delicious and totslly worth the bill (which doesn't add up to that much either!). I'd gladly become a vegetarian, if I could eat here guilt-free the rest of my life.

I have so many memories with this place. Being an eight year old kid going to bombarded shiv sagar and relish the Pav bhaji, so very crispy Chinese bhel which is my favorite! South Indian is also very good. The good fact about BSS is that none of the dish would disappoint you. Everything is good. Chilli baby corn is another great fish they offer. They also have a party hall for huge gatherings. Whenever I am in kol, I make sure I be here once!

A good place to hang out with for veggie lovers. It's a pocket friendly place but if one does care about ambience than its just not the place for you. Neelkamal chairs is what BOMBAY SHIA SAGAR have to offer you. The food is good especially the north Indian delicacies.  Don't miss the Chinese bhel which you will find on every second table around.

first thing to order here is chinese bhel. then crispy chilly baby corn and paneer tikka.. we never have problem in ordering variety .. coz of the no. of people..
after starters on thing that we always order in sabzis is malai kofta .. and to go with it there masala kulcha ..
the geat variety of ice creams and shakes are perfect for dessert.. cant suggest anything special in desserts coz we always order a different one...but its a perfect place for family gatherings

I am not not a big chaat lover, nor do i love the ambience this place provides but what what drives me not only to this place but also to rate it a point higher is the strawberry/ pineapple king dessert which is one of my all time favorite !!

Bombay Shiv sagar made a mark from the very day of its inception with a public perception, atleast in my vicinity, that it provides chaats in a very much bombay style. Though i would never agree to that perception after eating here but ultimately what it offers is pretty edible for not so chaat fanatics like me and very good for people who want to enjoy their chaats in an air conditioned room on some seats, with a tussle only at the entrance.

The place is big and decently spaced but is always crowded. The seats are those wrought iron ones which do not comfort me at all. The decor is minimal and ambience is average. The speed of service and politeness of the waiters has not been consistent with me and i have had both good and bad experiences in this context. 

The menu is vast and extensive starting from the chaats and then leading to north indian, chinese cuisine and a great variety of desserts. The paw bhaji is pretty good amongst the chaats. The north indian dishes are tasty with generous servings at prices a bit higher than i would expect from this place but decent enough for a takeaway. Chinese and south indian preparations are pretty okayish. Their crispy chilli babycorn and chinese bhel sell like frenzy though i dont like them much.

My favorite part of this place is the strawberry/ pineapple king which i have had as a starter as well. Just thinking about them brings waters to my mouth !!!

A nice place when it comes to grabbing the pao bhaji, aloo paratha and the grilled cheese sandwich. However, the place does get very crowded, and if you dont like being in the vicinity of a lot of screaming kids, better not come here on Sundays. I personally do not like their South Indian food, but they do make nice Kulfis and rose milk shake. The last time I went here I was really annoyed to see how the waiters were not too polite and we had to ask twice for water before it was given to us. Although it was a Sunday, it still did not justify the rudeness.

Bombay Shiv Sagar is a great place for tasty north Indian lunch or chaat sitting a cool enviroment. You are spoilt for choices as the menu is large. 

Avoid the place on weekends or at peak hours during dinner though. The place is fairly priced and thus draws huge crowds. During peak hours, it is nauseating and not a great experience. 

Be wise on when to go - like lunch on a weekday or chaat in the evening and you will love the place. The black dal, dahi puchka and chinese bhel are my favorites.

My 'Good Enough' 3.5 rating is primarily because of the chaos atmosphere in this place because of its central location and mainly young crowd. Bombay Shiv Sagar offers too much under one roof spoiling customers with too many options. From Sandwiches to Pizzas, Chinese, South Indian, North Indian, Shakes, Chats...Burp!!! 
Seating is casual with well lit space. Service is quite quick and whenever I go there, I end up filling myself with just the starters and snacks and missing out on Main Course. Maybe that's the reason for its popularity with young crowd who want it light on their pockets at the same time stomach filling.
Some must haves include Chinese Bhel, Pav Bhaji, Paneer starters, Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Dhania Dosa, Mushroom Manchurian, Fresh Juices and Kulfi Falooda.
Price for 4 people = 700-900/= (Incl of Taxes)

If you are looking for a good vegetarian restaurant, Bombay Shivsagar is definitely not the best of your choices. Being in such a nice location, the standards of the food doesnot match. The quality of food is not too good even. 

We had Veg Kolhapuri, Malai Kofta Which weren't really tasty. In breads we had Kashmiri Naan, Laccha Paratha, Butter Nan which were fine. The quantity was less and the prices were reasonable. The ambiance have lost its charm over time. The service was slow and the staff was busy gossiping among themselves rather than taking orders. As the restaurant is quite spacious, its quite noisy and not the perfect place if you want privacy or peace.

I would not recommend BSS as you will find far better options.

Visited this place for the first time within recent memory. Having heard a lot about it, I cannot say I was thrilled with their offerings. But to be really fair to them, I perhaps would have been more amenable to them if I was actually hungry :)

Water was served without asking them to, a definite plus. But then again they gave us only one menu between my wife and and me. I like my own menu card thank you :)

We ordered a dahi wada, chana chaat and chinese bhel. The dahi wada was actually good, the wadas soft, but a bit too sweet. Also no imli chutney. In my opinion, you cannot have dahi wada without chutney. Period. Also, it was served in a round bowl, and the dahi kept dripping out. I hope they can change it to the standard flat serving bowls used elsewhere. The chana chaat I did not care for. Made me feel like I was having crumbs. The much talked about chinese bhel tasted better, though perhaps a bit too sweet again. This too would have gone down better if I was hungrier. I also asked for a fresh lime soda. It just didn't taste great. I am not sure what. It was fresh, lemony and aerated enough!

Service was reasonably quick. The place seemed a tad crowded.

Food wasn't particularly inexpensive, with the above four totalling to almost Rs 350. If only Blue Poppy was open at that hour.

Every Gujrati/Marwari's favourite restaurant to go to for any occasion to celebrate and even when there is no occasion! Son's graduated.. lets go to the bss... want to fix daughter's marriage.. lets go out bss.. dont feel like cooking at home on sunday.. lets go to bss! Over the years.. the decor of the place may have lost some of its shine but its popularity still has not, the proof being the HUGE lines outside the restaurant on Sundays with waiting going into 100s at times! Anyone who goes their cannot possibly not order Chinese Bhel which I personally hate.. I feel its bland and tastes like sawdust and have a hard time getting it down my throat.. but oh well.. it is the single most best selling item on their menu!
The dal makhani, veg kohlapuri and nargisi kofta are other items i would recommend. In my latest visit I risked to try out an item I had not tried before.. veg spring rolls but they were yuck.. highly regret my decision! The place resembles a fish market when packed to capacity and would be very noisy if there is a party in the adjoining banquet! but overall decent food at decent prices.. I guess that is what makes it tick with the business class which constitutes a sizable portion of its clientele!

With time, i have started disliking this place for many reasons:

First: The quality of food.. The food is not so good now it is just an average food (In case one being vegetarian, there are much better options available than Bombay Shiv Sagar)

Second: The service: Its getting slow and slow... 

Ambiance: Its now becoming a social trend of dinning get togethers @ Bombay Shiv Sagar.. The moment one enter the decible gets the best music... 

Someone like me would spend extra for a food at a peaceful place rather than over and above noisy and clustered place... 

Its a complete no no for me for this place only in the case this is the last vegetarian restaurant in Kolkata...

Location: Bombay shiv sagar - as per what I have been to, there are two chains one is in south city Spencer's and another (this one) in camac street area, 5 mins from vardhan market. 
 
Discussing the pros and cons
1) a pure veg restaurant
2) serves delicious and quality food
3) service is moderate
4) place is hygienic  and clean
5) decent seating capacity
6) ambience- okay not bad

Cons
1) service slow a bit
2) sometimes there is waiting- they should try to accommodate more and more people 

Overall, a decent restaurant.

Must try: Chinese bhel , crispy baby corn, mango icecream :-)

I am a regular visitor to the restaurant and love the foods there. Being the veggie ,the food quality is good wit the variety to choose from. But today,it was a disaster when the Hyderabadi biryani turns to non veg as I found a big ant in the. Biryani and it turns into the ANT biryani" I have not expected this from this kitchen. The. In charge was not even courteous to replace the dish instead he was eager to finish the discussion with me so that other visitors should not come to know about the incident. Moreover, they have taken the full amount of the dish in the bill. This may be an accident but the management should keep an eye on the kitchen to maintain the quality also instead on the number of increasing visitors.

Last week on the day of Saraswati Puja, I along with my two other friends went to Bombay Shiv Sagar to have a typical vegetarian dinner on this auspicious day. According to me, Bombay Shiv Sagar is the right place to have authentic as well as delicious vegetarian meal at reasonable rate. So I suggested them this name and finally we ended up by reaching there around 7.30PM. Located in the eastern part of India at 22, Camac Street, 1st Floor, Block D (Pantaloons Building), this restaurant is ready to serve everything from the Himalayas to Kanyakumari  starting from Chinese, typical North Indian, South Indian, fast food to road side chats. 

We started our dinner with Sweet Corn Mushroom Soup and Baby Corn Mushroom Chilly. Hot and spicy, the Baby Corn Mushroom Chilly made a perfect combination with the sweet tasting soup. The starters were followed by Chana Masala, Aloo Paratha and Handi Dum Biriyani and Szechwan Fried Rice. Aloo Paratha was heavily stuffed with mashed potato preparation and therefore tasted too yummy. Even I did not need Chana Masala for having added taste to have it, because the taste was too good to have it separately. Chana Masala was good, nothing special about it. However, I felt Handi Dum Biriyani was more like Vegetable Fried Rice rather than Biriyani. The taste was almost similar to Fried Rice. But there is nothing to complain about the taste. Taste was really good. The Szechwan Fried Rice was really amazing. Perfect taste and perfect amount of Szechwan spices made this cuisine really lip smacking. I really enjoyed the dinner here as this place never burns a hole in our pocket after giving us a great opportunity to savor mouth watering preparations. At the end of the dinner for three, the total bill amounted to about Rs. 700/- only.

Food taste is average. Rotis are good. Vegetable Biryani and Pav Bhaji are average. Surprisingly there is no Thali type meal. Restaurant is air conditioned.  It is very noisy because it covers two huge halls. Suitable for medium sized parties. Good place to feel Bombay crowd in Kolkata. It is one of Bombay type of restaurant yet it is not known to many people.

If you like to keep purchase small and you are fine with eating only veg, then you should definitely try Bombay Shiv Sagar. 
  I have gone there multiple times whenever i felt i need to have pure veg food. Afterall, veg foods are supposed to be nutritious, isnt it? but is it always tasty? for this sole reason, i choose to go here. The first time, I had gone with my mother and elder sisters. I ordered kashmiri polao. It had no harmful coloured chemicals in it and there were a lot fresh looking vegetables. then i tried singapore rice and a type of gravy paneer. I decided to break my diet for one time. Service is not very fast. But the restaurant is very spacious and atmosphere is quiet lovely in the evening with the lights on. the water melon juice was very natural. So if you are not looking for any super quality overpriced food, and are happily vegertarian or veg lover, you should try Bombay Shiv Sagar atleast once in your lifetime.

Honestly when this place opened in Kolkata I was quite happy as I love going to the orignal in Mumbai .... however please don't expect too much from this place. The Pav Bhaji and Chinese Bhel are decent .... nothing too get too excited about. Chats are average as is the South Indian. Bad service and a noisy atmosphere can be tolerated by me if the food is great but if its just average then its certainly not acceptable.

Bombay Shiv Sagar.. Have been here a couple of times & I am glad to say that I have never really been disappointed with their food or service. A place where one can go with family, friends, or anyone for that matter. Their menu is quite elaborate.. But their most hyped item has to be their Chinese Bhel which is nice but not as much as it is hyped. This place is always full given that it is located in the Camac Street-Park Street Area.. Be prepared to wait for your table sometimes even for an hour! Easy on the pocket it is.. Two and a Half stars from me.
