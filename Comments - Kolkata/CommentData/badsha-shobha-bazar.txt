Food isn't that good. Very plain.  I don't have words. The bharta contains hard shredded chicken. I literally had problem chewing it. Chow has become tasteless.. a big thumbs down.

A small eatery. When you want a cheap and pocket friendly eat out. Can consider this restaurant. An average restaurant. Basically when I feel very lazy a quickie one is to order there. Not so bad.

I don't know why badsha has such a low rating.  I stay close by and order from this place all the time. It literally is a savior for me.  Though you really need to know what to order and what not. They make pretty decent fried rice and Cantonese noodles.  The kulcha and tandoori roti are awesome.  The kebabs are good.  The Indian chicken dishes that I've tried are all pretty good with a special shout out to the chicken do Piyaza. They deliver quickly and they also are quite reasonable on the pricing. 

Now, on what not to order.  I literally hate their sweet garlic chicken and their biryanis..  So,  I generally avoid these.

It's a small restaurant ,which is better as a takeaway joint ... It has few tables on the first floor , food is good ..
Service is average !! 
Ambience was the one thing I didn't liked at all !!!!
If you're alone and hungry ,you can try this place ..

The quality of food has fallen down.The management of the restaurant has changed the cooks are not at all good enough. They are serving biryani to that of footpath quality which we never expected from badsha. Even the Chinese food has gone down too.

I visited this place on a weekday with my mom. I tried ordering for kebabs but I was informed that no north Indian cuisine would be available. We had to order only from the Chinese section. Then we tried ordering for fresh lime soda but we were told no mocktail or soft drink would be available. Just water. 
We were extremely hungry. We ordered a mixed hakka chowmein and hot garlic fish. They served it within a decent time. Food was quite okay considering the price. This is by far the only good thing we can say about this restaurant.

Though it is a very small food joint. But the food they serve is really tasty and fresh. I love their Chicken Tandoori. I order in for home delivery almost 6-8 times in a month. Good service. Good staff.

Dis tiny restaurant is located at sovabazar more(opp mio amore)..dis restaurant provides both Chinese and mughlai dishes. Seating facilities are available but its nt spacious and u may feel cramped up fr space and d interiors are not quite clean as well..but d  food is quite good especially d Chinese dishes but d showstopper is d chicken tandoori as it is full of flavour and I wud highly recommend others to try d tandoori frm Badsha..dey provide free home delivery service as well which is quite fast and reliabe..overall d food is good but not d interiors so I wud recommend dis restaurant only fr parcels and take aways..

I am at a loss of...ways of expression...on this one. To make one thing clear primarily, if you consider 3 to be a 'high' rating, know it's for the food served here. If you consider 3 to be a 'low' rating, then that would be for the ambience in this place. We went here on sashthi, finding no better suggestions on zomato in the area for lunch. 1stly it looked like they did not have eat-in facilities but that idea soon proved wrong when they showed us "the steepest staircase made by man with the narrowest steps" to the 1st floor. After our hike to upper eating area (climbing down was even more perilous), we found the place was not too large (read: really cramped) and was a bit dark and shabby. However we still found a table (there were 3 of us) so that was definitely a plus. They did not have any cold water or soft drinks (I know that's outrageous and if I was reading this review before going here, I would've never gone). We ordered chinese and when it arrived, we took our 1st bite with apprehension and baited breath--- only to find that it was extremely and uncharacteristically tasty!! I had never ever expected such lovely food from this place and it was like the most pleasant surprise I got during the whole pujas. It was the sauce. I don't know how to describe it except wonderful. I'm actually considering taking a parcel from this place in the near future as I am writing this review. So I guess I can sum it up with, "if you're ordering a takeout, double thumbs up".

We couldn't find any other standard restaurant on zomato and so went there.
The ambience left us a bit unsure about the food quality but we were completely wrong. We ordered mixed hakka noodles and chicken manchurian which was very good..we didn't expect such delicious food from there..so I would like to taste their Indian dishes next time..

This place is in my home locality. I used to take away food at dinner. The food and quantity used to be good.

I visited the place last time during puja days. The dine in have zero ambiance, and extremely crostofobic. Though they have installed a ancient a.c the sitting area is directly above kitchen and quite hot and thus uncomfortable to sit.

The food was okay. Not at all top notch. We ordered for mutton biriyani and tandoori chicken. The service was horrible. Food was cold. No dips with tandoori, no extra salad, which is very common to such local cheap food joints. When we tried to draw their attention they completely misbehaved. This was not a isolated case, this thing was happening with every other customers. The waiters was arrogant, ill behaved and short tempered. 

I'm not going back to dine in even if the food is decent.

Badsha is one of the finest local and casual food outlet in the city. I have been a regular customer at Badsha and I specifically like their mixed fried rice and chilli chicken. It doesn't have any special delicacy as such but is suitable for a more casual foodie who will prefer quality over variety. Although I have never gone inside the restaurant to sit and have food yet the ambience is not very bad. It is a favourite with locals like me.

First the location. This place is near Sovabazar Sutanuti Metro Station / Sovabazar crossing and not E M Bypass. 

This is a small local eatery and is not worth traveling for. But if you are nearby you can try their kebabs which were really soft and juicy. The Kulcha and Rotis were good. Soft and tasty. The Mutton Biryani quantity was huge. The Mutton piece was again soft and juicy. But they use too much Kewra water and that killed the taste. The chicken pieces of Reshmi Butter Masala were great but the gravy was just OK. 

Among Chinese the Sweet and Sour Chicken was excellent. The Mixed Fried Rice and Mixed Gravy Chowmin were good too. Don't expect something similar to what you get in the Old China Town but they were decent in a more Indianized way. 

Service was good and the ambiance just OK. All in all a decent place for people who stay nearby.
