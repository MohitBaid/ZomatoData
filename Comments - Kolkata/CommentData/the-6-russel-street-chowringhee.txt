Decent place for fast food. There are no seating arrangement, so mostly people get their food parceled or eat standing outside the shop. The quality of food is variable. Sometimes it's extremely fresh and tasty and sometimes the taste is nowhere close to edible. But mostly they serve fresh food. My favourites are the moghlai paratha, crispy chilli corn, chicken egg roll.

A very good place for rolls. I specially like the egg cheese roll of this place. Well, I would suggest not to go for the sandwiches. They are not that good rather very plain.

Don't know the exact place. Because I ordered online.
I ordered the chiken momo. Which is quite average. There was very less chicken in the stuffing and the soup was horrible. I think that the soup was only some hot boiled water with some coriander leaves completely tasteless..
Quality was below average than the price tag of 90 ruppees.

The name and address of this place are exactly same. It z a typical roadside food kiosk with a few chairs to sit. So take away is a better option. Whenever I pass by, I always find a bunch of people around it. So I decided to give it a try. In fact I was curious to know why this small eatery is so popular!
Coming to the food,I ordered for a double chicken cheese roll & a grilled mayonnaise egg chicken sandwich. The chicken roll was so tasty. The stuffings was good in quantity. The chicken pieces were perfectly cooked n the melted cheese added a heavenly feeling to it. The sandwich was one of the best, I ve tried till date in a road side joint. It was served hot with potato chips. I just loved the stuffing( pieces of chicken n boiled eggs tossed with mayonnaise n spices). The only drawback of it, is lack of proper sitting accommodation. It z truly a heaven for the cheese n mayonnaise lovers!!

The 6 Russel Street is a five decade old hole in the wall eatery serving scrumptious food for Kolkata foodies.

Food
The place serves Chinese, sandwiches and rolls but Chinese is it's strength with chicken momos, fried rice and chilli Chicken being the best dishes. Do not eat the rolls here as those are very average.

Ambience and service
There is not much of a restaurant ambience here but a few stools on which one can sit while eating. Service is quick and you get your order in good time.

Cost
INR 200 per person.

Verdict

Recommend for a quick filling meal.

An average food joint which is just enough to satisfy an empty stomach and nothing more than that. Being a vegan I wouldnt be able to comment on the non-veg stuff on offer but the veg roll, veg roti roll and the paneer roll that I have had are not upto the mark. They would either make it totally dry or fill it with tons of ketchup. The veg mix that goes into the roll is bad and there is nothing appealing in the food.
Better find another place my vegan guys than to try eating here.

Its a take away joint. So kitchen is pretty visible.
Now let me share my horrible experiences. Have you ever seen anywhere someone having food and same time rapping the roll? To be mentioned he hasn't wash his hands and same time doing both work together!!! If you are lucky enough you can see it here. Even when I brought it in the notice of the owner (the aged gentleman) he didn't even care to bother it. I had to repeat it twice, then he left his place to intervene in kitchen. Also would like to mention their is a young gentleman whose behavior is really good, but this aged one behaves as if you are asking for free food. The same aged man behaves nicely when the order value is high. Happy eating.

The address is also the name of the restaurant...no maybe it's a bit too much to call it a restaurant,its slightly better than a roadside kiosk. So nothing much by way of ambience. There are a couple of plastic chairs arranged on the pavement and a few patrons can occupy those and sit and eat. The rest can either take away or eat standing. But this is a good place for office goers, students and those on a budget. You get quite a variety at  very reasonable rates. Their rolls and Sandwiches are quite ok. This place is good for those looking for a filling meal at budget prices.

Just bring a bunch of buddies and sit back on the plastic chairs on the pavement with cheese chicken rolls in your hand, and you can miss out on the dal-bhaat at home with ease.

The cheese chicken roll here happens to be very popular among my friends, so that's what we had there. Personally I didn't find it extremely good, although it's quite filling, and Park Street is expensive so anything under a hundred rupees goes.

You'll see this place crowded, mostly. It has no seating arrangement. All that you can do is fix yourself in those small few tools (that they provide).
Tried the Double Chicken Roll & Mixed Chowmin. 
Chowmin was fine. Double Chicken Roll was too small compared to that of the other Roll corners. Thus, the price might seem pocket friendly but not justified !

Service needs to gear up, as they take a lot of time. Counters might be increased.

Overall, for Office goers or other people there it's recommendable. But then if you have better options, why not opt for them ! 
Choice is all yours ! :)

Momos are served with an equally amazing clear soup. Veg momos can be skipped. Fried Fish should also be tried once. All in all, a great place to have rolls and a few other things. Cherry on the cake - it won't burn your pockets. Truly deserves 4/5

One of the numerous options on Russel Street,located at a strategic corner on the road from Maidan metro towards St.Xavier's College,this was on my list for quite a long time. After hearing a lot of good reviews about the CHICKEN CHEESE ROLL, We finally decided to give it a try today.

Ambience: it's a kiosk with some stools to sit,outdoor. Nothing spectacular. U almost get the feeling of sitting on the road while eating.
 Service:quite slow. We waited for around 10-15mins for the roll.

But,I was hugely disappointed. This? This is their famous Chicken Cheese Roll??â†’_â†’
Size is utterly disappointing(read,tiny)for the price(â‚¹55) And I expected that there would be grated cheese but to my horror, cheese spread was used which added to the bland taste of the roll. The chicken pieces were few too. 
All in all,I will definitely give this place a miss. 
P.S Someone who has eaten Garia's Shivam's rolls, will actually cry at the size of the rolls here.(T_T)

I simply love their rolls. They are huge and very filling. The chicken they serve inside the roll is tender, soft, juicy and delicious in flavour. Their double chicken cheese roll is a must try. Prices are moderate but no complaints since the roll they make is bigger and juicier and tastier than any roll i have ever had.

The quantity is enough to fill your after-college tummy. Apart from that, their rolls are pretty decent too. What most roll joints fail to master, and what 6 Russel Street does perfectly, is striking the right balance of tanginess amidst all those flavours.

Had only one thing from here. Chicken cheese roll. I have never tasted any roll better than this. So juicy cheesy and filling! Rich chicken in every bite! That's the way it should be!

This place pops up while returning from college and is a place we students frequent way too often. They make really good rolls and personally their chicken cheese roll is my favorite. And best of all, it is oil free. They make prawn and vetki rolls which turned out really tasty. They also make good sandwiches. The chicken mayo sandwich was a delight. It's a good place to get a quick snack after college.

Been here many a times. The food quality is too good. The chinese dishes are well prepared and served hot. The guys and the owners is well behaved. New addition to this is Moghlai Paratha and Kassa Manso. I plate Moghlai paratha is good enough for office lunch for 2 person. The cooking medium is very good. Must visit for everyone.

Was walking towards metro plaza when I found this little food joint at the corner of what I believe must be Russel Street. It's an office area and since I visited during Pujo it was deserted and we were the only customers. So I checked it's reviews on Zomato and decided I must try it out. Ordered some steamed and fried chicken Momos and they were delicious. The guys at this place were really friendly and courteous which made it better. I wish I was hungrier to try out more things from their awesome looking menu! Next time maybe :)

N of course the authentic hakka chicken chowmein n chilli chicken.

Dropped by at The 6 Russel Street and ordered a chicken roll, veg cheese roll, veg roll and fried chicken momos..

Firstly, let me tell u all the rolls were oil free..which is a positive point as very few places use such minimal amount of oil...the chicken roll is quite nice and filling..the veg cheese roll is good..I personally did not like the veg roll..sauce was missing in it..the chicken momos were very oil..overall the place is good..

On my second visit to this place I happened to see betki fish roll in the menu..being a fish lover, I tried it..it was a delight having the roll. I recommend all fish lovers and people wanting to try something different to try it.

A bit overrated 6 Russel Street failed to meet the expectations i had. Right on the corner of russel street this small store is always having customers standing and waiting for their orders. I had tried the momos before and this time went to try the cheesy prawn wrap. The food is nice with a lot of flavor, i loved the prawn roll but i did not like the service and the presentation. When there are so many roll shops around you would want to have something which differant. The 6 russel street may be just the other roll place around.

Because of my delayed Evening Flight last night, I had to go around the city, late at night, trying to fetch something to eat. Of course, it was half past 10, so most restaurants near my hotel had already been called off. 

While on my hunt for Food, I suddenly bumped into a fast food place in Russel Street. The sign board read, "The 6 Russel Street", and, trust me, judging by the size of the restaurant, I barely expected "Good Quality food". But, with no other options left in hand, I ordered a Veg Fried Rice and half a plate of Chilli Chicken. 

They took about 5-10mins to deliver my order. Though I had not expected much from "The 6 Russel Street", the quality of food seemed to surprise me. The meal, though originally Chinese, had an interesting Indian feel to it. I'd love to taste the Chilli Chicken again. 

Here's the best part, though. The person at the reception handed over a bill charging Rs.140. So, if you're on a tight budget and if you're trying to get the best out of your buck, "The 6 Russel Street" is the place to go!

Overall, the Food Quality is a little below excellent. "Value for Money" is absolutely a plus point! The ambience, of course, is a bummer. The person at the counter seemed quite rude and the place was crowded with people trying to munch in 10 Egg Rolls EACH (Or maybe I'm just exaggerating, lol) . But, despite that, I'd love to give this place another visit and probably save a buck or two.

Just opposite of my office, we frequently go there for egg chicken cheese roll.. Awesome :)
I have also tried mix chowmin which is of good quality and quantity as well.  But it is too small in size, attenders some time behave rudely.

I have been here recently after hearing about their chicken cheese roll which I wanted to try. Went there and ordered the above said roll and they served it to me within 5-7 minutes. The taste of the roll was good with the liquid cheese adding the extra zing although I would have liked a bit more chese in it for the price I paid. So apart from the feeling that the roll is a bit overpriced, the experience was good enough and who knows I might return there someday to have that roll again.

Every time I pass by this place there would be a bunch of people hanging around which is what prompted my curiosity to try it out. Pocket wise its great bang for buck which explains its popularity with the students and office crowd. Food-wise I thought it was just average. I tried the Chilly Chicken which was decent and the Chicken Roll which was average. Flavours did not excite me much truly would much rather stroll down to Kusum and have a yummy roll there.

being an x-student of St. Xavier's College, I was a frequent visitor of this place on my way home from college mainly. Their chicken roll was my fav. The roti of the roll is very very soft unlike other roll joints. The filling of chicken kabab is equaly delicious. They don't put any kind of sauce which i like the most (they put sauce if you tell them only), the rolls contain a perfect amount of lemon juice and smells lemony (another reason of my liking). Now even whenever i happen to go there for shopping in vardan market or camac street westside, pantaloons I definitely visit there to have their chicken roll (or egg-chicken/egg/double egg/paneer roll). The staffs there are friendly and well-behaved. They don't take much time to serve. Have 3-4 seats outside their shop on the pavement. The rolls are on a moderate price. Last evening i went there too. Chicken roll costed me Rs.35, Egg roll Rs.22 and Double egg roll Rs.30.

6 Russel Street is clearly no friend of 6 Ballygunge place, apart from the similarity in name. Primarily a roll joint, this place has not endeared itself to me much, and according to me, a glorified roll joint. The rolls that they make are average - compared to Hot Kati Roll on the other side of Russel Street, this falls short. However the filling is decent, and they modify according to taste, listening to the requests made. Otherwise, not much to recommend. I have never seen people try out anything apart from the rolls here, or actually sit.

I have tried their double chicken cheese roll wrapped in a roti and chicken drumsticks.. The roti roll is outstanding... Very different from the usual rolls which you get in Kolkata... Extremely filling and the cheese just adds to the taste... Very friendly people catering to the large number of office and college goers... All in all, a wonderful place for a quick snack...

It is an very average outlet at Russel Street. The dhosas are not that good. The crispy chilly baby corn was okay and drumsticks were not that good. 
Chilly chicken and mixed noodles were still tasty. Chicken sweet corn soup and chiicken manchurian soup(something new) were still fine. Ambience is okay and staff should be well trained.

Located at 6 Russel Street, Kolkata near Maidan Metro Station, The 6 Russel Street is one of my favorite destinations to get my tummy filled with some of the mouth watering veg eateries at pocket friendly rate. I often visit this place as it is on my way to home from office. So my evening hunger is frequently satisfied by this small take-away restaurant. Situated at a prime location, at the junction of two streets, The 6 Russel Street is almost like a road side restaurant serving authentic South Indian preparations and street foods. No seating arrangement for dine-in service but still this vegetarian eating hub remains crowded throughout the day.

Specialist in South Indian preparations, I think the cheese masala dosa is one of the best cuisines it serves. So yummy and so tasty that you will love to relish the cheesy flavor on and on. Also the wide range of chats is simply mouth watering. Chat-pata and tasty! The mixed chat and dahi vada are the two of my favorites in the chats list. Aloo tikka is also a delicious item here. I have tried paw baji once or twice but to be frank, I don't like this preparation here. The curry for the paw is not so good. Not a spacious and high grade restaurant but The 6 Russel Street is surely one of the favorite hang outs for college students and working people. I have often come across a gathering of St. Xavier's College students there, chatting and enjoying the spicy and yummy preparations of this eating hub. At such a reasonable rate, they offer sufficient quantity to satisfy the taste buds with mouth watering flavors and the tummy with enough quantity. Next time if you are somewhere near this place, try the chats of this place to give a spicy treat to your taste buds.

The 6 Russel street has come up recently, and you will always find this place crowded with students and office goers! They were initially a vegetarian place, but later became a non-vegetarian fast food joint! There are certain good things about this place and certain bad things! I'll list both :-
Cons first : Their rolls are inconsistent, at times almost tasteless. Their dosas have watery sambar, they have no place to sit (not taking three red chairs into account), and no shade to stand under. And above all they take a while to give you your food.

Pros : Really cheap place, the people are friendly, and they have really nice Vada Pao! Also They have got more or less nice sandwiches! 
A place for all broke college students who are extremely hungry ;) try it!

Too awesome! hygienic, tasty as well as affordable. The double egg/double chicken roll is a must have if you are looking for a non-vegetarian snack. The menu is decent for a fast food joint. You will get a wide variety from rolls to dosas, but the flavour of Kolkata is preserved in every bite of them. Enjoy the place every time I visit.
