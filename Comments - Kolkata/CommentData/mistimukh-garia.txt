it is located beside amrambagh outlet just few meter away from the Palki restaurant.
 I tasted few sweets which includes Langcha and rosogulla on my away and did not expect much from them but it turned out be nice enough.Since you don't hav much option between Patuli and 45 Bus Stand any sweet option. It is a good option for people staying near Palki restaurant and in and around Patuli.

Mistimukh is a one of the sweet shop which immediately dragged my attention while I was traveling to Garia from Patuli Bypass and it comes on the left side lane. Just beside the amrambagh outlet there beside the oldest Palki restaurant.
Got chanar jilipi and Soft sandesh from here for home. I was not very sure about their taste and quality but those turned out to be good which we enjoyed at home after a homely dinner. Good place for sweets as you get good variety of bengali sweets.

Quality of sweets is appreciated respect to their pricing. I would recommend 'MOTICHUR LADDU'. This laddu is made with ghee and so delicate to bite, just loved it.

I would say that the quality of this shop is much better than the other sweet shops located at Garia or nearby. But the sweets are just extremely sweet instead of this I must say that they maintain their quality very well.

This is my newly opened "para'r dokan" which was a much needed relief for us due to the lack of sweet shops in this area.
Location and ambience: Near 45 bus stop, beside Palki restaurant and Arambagh chicken. The shop is very clean (a fact which we often give a miss when it comes to sweet shops).

Food: They have quite a collection of sweets with an average price of ₹10. We decided to zero in on Rasmalai. Expectations weren't very high and I wasn't disappointed. The Rasmalai is not OTT tasty but at ₹10 it was more than what one can demand for.
Would definitely like to taste the other sweets.
P.S They sell namkeens(samosas, patties,etc)too.
Their location is such that they don't have any immediate competition nearby and if they keep their standard consistent, this shop will definitely stay in the long run :)

Tried the samosas,they are nice but their consistency in size is not okay! One was so small and the other one was okayish! Look into the size folks! *size matters*

I am so happy find that a place has finally been established for people with sweet tooth. After having your lunch or dinner from places around, you can simply hop into "Mistimukh" without giving a second thought. The place is small but will leave you satisfied with the variety of sweet items present. Most importantly, all the sweet items seemed really unique to me. You won't feel monotonous unlike others. I found few fried items which were made in a really new design which was really a plus point! Thumbs up for this sweet corner. Do visit and please your taste buds!
