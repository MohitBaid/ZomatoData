I am quite a regular at this place especially lunch as its near my office.
Food (Veg)- Food is good to taste and presented well too. Sushis also i tried here but they are not nice at all. I like the chinese and indian spread here. They are good in taste.
Hookah- Hookah is good. 
Ambience - ambience is good here. But once i went on a Wednesday evening. It was a sufi night and i must say i swore i will never visit this place on a wednesday evening. The live music was really really bad. 
Service- Service is bad. Staff are courteous but the service is bad. Everytime we go we have faces this issue - we were served first the main course then the starter even after specifying them the order. And then later they give both of them together even if there are just two people to eat. The staff i feel needs to be trained well. The manager however was nice and courteous and she took care of the complain and did it right later.

Wow.
Checking in now: Sunday night. January 2018
They charge 500/- bucks for a peg of whiskey but don't provide nibbles/small bite snacks.
Hookah for ₹400/₹500/₹600 !?!?!
What the fraak?
Although I love the vibe and music of this joint, the prices are not justified for some things that they are currently charging?
2nd edit for today: they serve drinks but don't bother asking for add-ons like soda/water etc. 
3rd edit: I asked for chilli sauce/mustard sauce but instead got a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup?? 
4th edit : they don't serve drinking water until you ask them to... !!??

Raize The Bar was a choosen place for my Birthday celebration back in September 2016.It was a newly open restro-bar & lounge with its own brew.The ambience is good.Because we were a big group we got a corner which was sperated from the crowd.So it   helped us maintaining our privacy.
The service was good and the staff were pro-active. The food was equally good.We ordered quiet a few veg & non-veg delicacies from their menu and the food was liked by all.What i liked was they serve a platter which is perfect meal balanced well both in quantity and quality.
Overall it was a good experience & I can surely recommend this place to others :)

There was a offer which was running recently,499 + taxes for lunch buffet.The most inviting offer was unlimited craft beer.Everything is almost good about this place.I have been here previously also.Specially the food quality and presentation.But this time what I saw have left me in doubt.The Glass in the high beer was served had lipstick mark in it. When I asked to changed they smiled,I didn’t know how to react to this type of service.

Raize The Bar occupies a sprawling 5000 sq. feet area on the ground floor of the Godrej Waterside IT Park, Sector 5, Salt Lake. The interiors have a plush feeling to them which adds to the ambience of the place. The staff are very efficient and prompt in their service. The presentation of the dishes is also very nicely done. But there are 3 downsides of this place which cannot be ignored. The music is a bit too loud. The dance floor is not very spacious. Lastly but not the least, the washroom is a tad bit too small when compared to the area of the whole place. Overall a good experience.

Spread over a very huge area...this brewhouse pub runs that extra mile on the decor and the way it looks from outside.Once you step inside it gives a very plush and ambient feeling which kindq blows you out..very nicely made sitting arrangements amd the bar is perfectly built juat beside the dance floor,everything is very well planned inside.The wooden finish furnitures gives it a very subtle touch of modernity as well makes it look organic.Coming to the food the food was pretty good too the chicken platter tasted really nice and also the fish tasted heavenly.The sheesha was well made as well.A very unique pub in the city cant wait to go back again

Finally a brewery in this locality with a refined ambiance is here. Raize The Bar has everything to its advantage now.The food is mouth-watering, the beer is perfectly prepared and the music sets the mood just right. If you are looking for places to carouse with your gang on a Friday night or after a tired at work, this place should definitely be on your bucket list! Although they are short-staffed which affects the service , overall the experience is a good one.

This is a very well decorated pub. We went there for a corporate dinner party, a separate area was allocated for us. 
For starters, we had Chicken Tikka Kebab and Pan fried chilli fish. Both were equally good and goes well along with drinks. 

Had Jeera Pulao, Fish Labrador, Chicken Kasha in main course, Ice cream with brownie in dessert. All the foods were good in taste and served hot. 

Well behaved staff, smoking area and a small dancing area is available.

If someone is looking for a place to eat delicious food with a glass of beer, Raize The Bar is the perfect place to hop in. 

Ordered:-
•Chicken Teriyaki 
•Grilled Chicken Breast with BBQ sauce
•Ami Kolkata (Chelo Kabab)
•Belgian Moon (sweet and tangy)


Teriyaki chicken was the best of all. 
About the Belgian Moon, if someone is looking for a taste of sweetness in beer, so this is the best one! 

Loved all the food 😍
A must visit for all big foodies out here, really happy with the food and drink.

We visited this place during lunch time and we noticed that lunch buffet was going on,so we immediately opted for that(*wink face*). The buffet service was excellent from food to salad everything was just on point. As for the drinks the beer was too good(since they produce there own) and virgin mojito is best around the town. The place is really beautiful and provides ample of space for their customer. Really looking forward to visit this place soon!!!
P.S: one thing I didn't get was why they charged us extra 8% for service tax after charging 5% GST! Other than this everything was quite good

I went on a Thursday night with a colleague of mine. If you are a fan of crafted beer then this is the place for you. It's a microbrewery with 4 varieties of their craft beer. We had a taster and selected Belgian and German varieties. The Belgian one was stronger. Taste was good. In Food we had ordered green chili chicken,  tengra style chili chicken, a dish which comprised of mushroom which absolutely tasted amazing, Chicken lassagna which was also very good. The music is very very loud which is a great place for all hard music lovers. The staff was attentive and courteous. 
Overall an amazing experience. I would definitely like to visit again.

To day I visited with my family to take buffet lunch the place was overcrowded but we get the table the chairs were uncomfortable once we decided to leave the place but it was 2 P.M.and we were hungry so having no option we started buffet lunch surprisingly some of the containers were empty and others have last small quantity food which was either cold or not fit for consumption. I draw the attention of waiters who were standing but of no use we have taken soup which was cold and small quantity of certain food and completed our lunch any way.The food was cold and tasteless.I advice one should refrain himself going such type of place.We waste our money.interestingly without any service they add 8%service charges which I refused to pay.

It's located at the ground floor of my office building. Been there couple of times but the best experience was when I visited there for my boss's birthday bash. The food quantity was less but the taste makes up to it. And the cocktails are equally chilled and lip smacking! I had a pitcher of beer which was enough for at least 3 people!! The staff are courteous and made the celebration more enjoyable by suggesting different good items which are too delicious. It's a little expensive but the music by dj and dance floor lightings are superb! We danced too much and were totally exhausted at the end... enjoyed a lot.

I went there this Friday after office with friends from office. The place is nice but found the music a bit loud.

They let you taste few freshly brewed beers as per their that days menu and accordingly you can order.

We ordered a hookah which was too good in taste, - sorry i dont remember the name but it was something rose paan or some flavour.

Sarson Mahi Tikka (mustard and yogurt marinated fish morsels served with mint chutni)- The bhetki was perfectly cooked and very soft and melted in the mouth.
Green Chilli Chicken (diced chicken tossed in coriander and lemon grass) - This was okay in taste. Just if you want to try new dishes go for it otherwise you can give it a miss.
Lonely Planet - I tried this non-alcoholic drink, which was very refreshing.

Went there last night around 10:30pm. Being a Saturday night it was crowded and had to wait for ten minutes. But the host was awesome and lived up to his promise to provide us a good place. Service was beyond expectations and despite being crowded, prataap the person in charge ensured service level was its peak. Food was awesome and so was the ambience and music.

it hurts to write a negative review but sometimes you need to. i had reserved a table ,with three guest,through dine out and the confirmation came at 3.30 for a visit which was scheduled at 8.30 pm. when we reached , a table for 2 was offered us. the table was not sufficient for 2 people also and it was very apparent that  a makeshift arrangement has been done to accommodate more guest on a small passageway.  few tables were vacant and when we asked them to provide us with one of those, they said it is reserved. i wonder if there are different class of reservations in restaurant too. the staff seemed to be least bothered to make any effort to make us comfortable and seeing their attitude, or the lack of it, we had no other option but to leave the place . They certainly need to Raize their level of hospitality, which is a must if they need to survive here. and yes, the music was just too loud . as someone rightly said " thotha chana baaje ghana. "

So finally RTB gets the license to do the brew.

I have already visited the place thrice and each time the experience has been great. They have 4 different beers – American Lager, English Stout, German Wheat and Belgian Witbiere -  and the taste of each imparts a feeling of quality. Though, I always consume all four flavours being a beer aficianado, my personal favourites are the lager and the stout. The stout has a delicious creamy coffee-chocolatey mouthfeel with that bold bitterness that good stouts are known for, to top it up with the creamy head.

The interiors exude class and it appears a lot of thought went into it. There are ample seating arrangements for everyone. The food too appears to be of good quality from what I have tried so far – fish n’ chips, green chilli chicken, grilled veg platter and veg teriyaki.

The staff too is friendly and you feel welcome right from the moment you come at the gate, whether you are in twos, threes, fours or even solitary.  I must mention one particular service staff – Shubhojit (bearded lad), very prompt with the requirements placed, and always eager to serve and help. 

All in all, a good, swank, upper crested, posh establishment with good beer, good food, good crowd and ofcourse, the good people who are making it all happen. Shall always visit. 

Cheers!

Food is the primary need of any human being. And eating out one always wants a blend of good food and warmth of people who give that service. Today was my first day at "Raize the Bar" and I had a real nice experience. The first dish that was served I felt the food was not as hot as it should be so I spoke to the waiter who listened to my issue and called the concerned person - Shivangi Khandelwal to have a word with me. She listened to my concern, requested me if she can check the food and later returned with the chef. The chef took full responsibility of what I was looking for and got me another dish. I was delighted. Not only this all the waiters, Ms Khandelwal and the chef gave me a great experience and extremely polite. People who accompanied me were also happy with the service. In the recent times for a person like me who eats out in most of the prime restaurant this restaurant is a BIG THUMBS UP.

Awesome ambience with quick prompt and polite waiters, this new upscale place in sector 5 took us off our heels. Music was techno and commercial house. As soon as I entered couple of my all time favourite ones by David Guerra and Avicii were played by the DJ.

It's a microbrewery with 4 varieties of their craft beer. We had a taster and selected Belgian and German varieties. The Belgian one was stronger. Taste was good. Details were provided regarding the contents, benefits, bitterness, and few more factors.

I would rate their food and presentation as really unique. We ordered green chilli chicken, chilli chicken tangra style and oregano seasoned chicken tikka. Their varieties were a fusion of Indian and foreign cuisines.

Green chilly chicken and the tangra style chilli chicken were super good. Succulent well cooked pieces of chicken. Tikka with oregano was not the best though.

The waiters are quick and take good attention. Hooka is being served. Rates are nominal for a place like this. The warmth of Bengali hospitality coupled with innovative and creative ideas make this place one of the best in sector 5.

I really like the food as well as the drinks! I’ve had a few shots and absinthe and a variety of cocktails! All were up to the mark! 
I could go on and on about the food! Starting from the Mediterranean burger, one of my favourites! The pink sauce pasta, Mexican rice, the vegetarian kebab platter, Melting mushroom, the Margarita pizza are yum! 
I’m looking forward to the advancement of the brewery! 
Hookah is good too! 

Ambiance: 4/5 
I really like the vibe of the place,the music,the seating and the view! It is a must visit!

Recently visited RTB for a dinner and the craft beer tasting session..the Belgian wheat was amazing. We tried the green chili chicken,thin crust pizza,fish tikka and a prawn delicacy...the fish was succulent and not over powering with spices..chili chicken was perfect with the fresh green chili paste hint and nicely done (keeping the right juiciness of the protein)..the pizza was in a different shape in rectangular and the place was buzzing..We enjoyed to the core and was a lovely experience.undoubtedly the best in the Sector-v area which has a great fan following from the other part of the city as well.,.

So this place in salt lake was long in my checklist. And Finally visited here
Visited mainly for their new offerings russian hookah and craft beer.
The Russian hookah was the smoothest hookah I have ever had. The flavour was savvy and the smoke sense.
They provided testers for the craft beers. I liked all of them. Especially the espresso beer was awesome.
In food melting mushroom -one of the finest mushroom dish I have ever had and the serving style was too 👌👌
Ambience is good. I was seating by the bar and the bar tenders were extremely courteous to our requests and enquiries. Dj a bit loud and dance floor a bit small. Overall a good experience will definitely visit again.

Visited this place for lunch on Saptami. The place was quite empty and still service was a bit sluggish. We started with their special melting mushroom and it was something to die for, we even repeated the order. After that we tasted chicken spaghetti , pan fried chilli fish and fish and chips - all items were great but for the drink menu many of the items were missing though. However overall a nice experience!

Visited this place few days back. It's on the Waterside building(Saltlake). Booked via dineout & got 20% discount on total bill amount. Now coming to food I've seen reviews on Zomato before that people love their Chello Kabab, so tried it & it was really awesome in taste. The rice in chello kabab was so tasty & kabab was too good. I can definitely say it is better than Peter Cat's chello kabab. Now in dessert I've tried their popular Fried Ice-cream & it was out of the world, the taste was sooo good. I just fell in love with it. Really good. Everyone should try this one. But they need to improve their service little bit. Otherwise it's a nice pub to eat&drink.😊😋

If you want to party and drink till your wallet can't take it anymore, this is the place to be. If you want a quiet conversation and cheap booze, find another joint.

Raize the Bar is at an oddly situated place on the ground floor of Godrej Waterside off the Sec V Ring Rd. They do check id's so make sure you're carrying one. The staff were courteous and it's a spacious bar with high chairs and small-ish tables. Anyway, the beer is fairly expensive here, unfortunately their craft beer system isn't functional yet, will be trying that once it's up and running. We ordered some starters, Chicken Wings and Teriyaki Chicken. The wings were strictly so-so, ranking with the also-rans in the Best Wings competition, if any. Unique presentation though, 5/5 for creativity. The Teriyaki chicken is good, with a hint of overdosing on the Soy sauce. But it's a cheap dish with enough to go around for 4 people in bite sized pieces.

The music unfortunately is loud, very loud. Makes for a difficult place to have a conversation. It's the one thing I remember most about the place and that, is a pity.

I'm sorry, if the picture is grainy and undiscernable. My camera isn't the best in dim light. 😂

Dj is not proffesional at all. They used to refuse your request. It was Friday night and the dj was playing english songs, when I asked for bollywood songs he justified that Bollywood songs only on Saturday and I have accepted it happily. Someone given him money and requested for same then only he accepted it. Then I have asked him why you are playing it right now, it's not Saturday then he told it's up to me. We are totally unsatisfied with there services and behaviour. At the time of leaving we showed him **** off, dj started using slang languages over it, rushing out me and tried to hit me and the manager started defending him with no apologies of wrong behaviour made by their dj. Bounceres started to push us after spending 10k bucks. This place is not good at all and not safe. These guys are totally unprofessional, they don't know how to serve their customer. They don't have any proffesional behaviour. This is totally rediculos.  This happened last night only. This is worst experience I ever had.

Being a regular customer here, I really like their Hookah and their Indian Platter Starter and the Chinese Platter starter. They did have a problem of 'too loud music for human ears' sometime back but they seem to have worked on it. They could work on their drinks though, specially availability of beers.

Ambience - Nicely decorated with good seating arrangements.

Food - Food is very tasty and well decorated. We ordered some chicken wings which were best amongst all we did order. The drinks were also well served. 

Value for money - Not so over priced compared to its ambience and quality. Overall nice.

Overall nice evening and good hangout place for friends. 
P.S - You shouldn't hit this place if you hate loud music.

I have tasted the chicken lasagna from here, it's good too.
Fish and chips tasted awesome, pure bhetki it was.
The classic mojito is a must try.
Serving style is classy. Food quality is great. Ambience, music is trendy. The waiters are well behaved.

Mahasasthi evening experience at Raize the Bar was a complete showstopper! Fairly easy to locate with their big yellow hoarding on the Godrej Waterside, me and my school friends were in for a fun night and it served us just right. Moderately spacious, RDB has everything from hookah to a dedicated bar, brewery and seating area. The food, the alcohol and the service everything was better than what I expected out of it and the ratings do justice for what they offer. In the drinks their Watermelon Mojito and LIT were the best, though we also had their Cosmo, Red Wine Sangria and Mandarine Margarita. The bartender did a good job with each of them except the Cosmo had too much cranberry juice in it which just made it plain sweet. In the appetizers their popular Melting Mushrooms are absolutely worth the hype, buttery soft mushroom shots served with a sweet and sour red sauce. Steller stuff. Chilly chicken tangra style tasted nice but was more of a dry chilly chicken thing with no striking difference. Our meal followed with a terrific Lasagna, their popular Meaty Pizza and a Pan fried chilly fish. The pan fried chilly fish was okaish, a tad on the over fried side for my liking. The meaty thin crust square pizzas were all filled with chicken sausages and grilled chicken chunks was decent enough but I have had better. What stole the show was clearly their Lasagna, it's hands down one of the bests in the city. A fried icecream in the end was the cherry on top. The staff here are courteous, attentive and efficient. Our bill amounted to 6048 and it was totally worth the food and the service. Raise the Bar is clearly a winner among the new & budding pubs at sector v and I would love to come back soon.

A place to rejuvenate yourself after a long day at office. Also since it is Puja season now and if you want time-out from the crowd, try out this Sector V pub. The ambience is awesome and the interiors are classified nicely into three dictinct sections.
Wine-barrel seating arrangements, long bar counter, loud music, classy decor, DJs, good food and the variety of Cocktails are the X factors of this place. Basket of assorted fries, Nachos and Paneer Platter were our favorites along with Haakiwi, Margarita and Long Island Ice Tea. 
A thumbs up from my side and a place I can depend upon to overcome my office blues.

The only thing i did not like there much was the playlist, which was quite boring for a Friday night. Even all my friends did not like it too.

I went for birthday party, had a pint of bira, lots of other starters like chili chicken tyangra style, garlic prawn, paneer tikka platter, non veg platter, green chili chicken as starter.

I specially want to mention about chili chicken tyangra style and non veg platter, they are really the best in taste. rest of them are okayish but less in quantity.

Crowded friday night, usually take lots of time to serve any order, which is very much irritating.

Helpful staffs with nice hospitality but waiting time for food is more than expected.

Pan flavoured hukka is smooth and nice.

Nice pub atmosphere, but little annoying karaoke event, with the pathetic voice and tempo of people.

But the DJ was good to groove the people, and make them dance on the dance floor.

Definitely I want to try again this place for music, food and atmosphere, with a hope of a better experience.

They might come up with new micro brewery, I am eagerly waiting for that.

Quick confirmation over Zomato. Food is good, especially the fish and chips. The pizza was not that great though.  Thank god you get Bira here. 
The only thing i did not like there much was the playlist, which was quite boring for a Friday night. Even all my friends did not like it too.

I went for birthday party, had a pint of bira, lots of other starters like chili chicken tyangra style, garlic prawn, paneer tikka platter, non veg platter, green chili chicken as starter.

I specially want to mention about chili chicken tyangra style and non veg platter, they are really the best in taste. rest of them are okayish but less in quantity.

Crowded friday night, usually take lots of time to serve any order, which is very much irritating.

Helpful staffs with nice hospitality but waiting time for food is more than expected.

Pan flavoured hukka is smooth and nice.

Located near godrej waterside near to ring road college more stretch in sector v , this is quite a nice pubstyle resturant .
Seating arrangements are divided in some sofas ,chairs , liquor barrel stand circular tables ,bar stools and all . Those circular tables also give a view of busy sector ring road and canal outside . But the sofa's are more cozy I feel .
The foods and choice of cocktails are good . Food tatsted good such as chili chicken dry,butter garlic prawns,fish and chips (decoration of the item was also good and straight out of some british eateries that we have seen) . Mojito was good as well and it was nice to find the barman coming to inform about choices as one of ingredients was not available for the ordered item .
All in all good food and drinks ,very good environment and moderately good service (need some improvement in serving) makes this one of good joint out of many in sector -v area . Go and enjoy in raize the bar ,you won't be disappointed .Aditi Sengupta

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. This place feels like home. I felt as if I was in Mumbai. Amazing ambiance, live dj, great sheesha, super polite and well mannered staff. My favourite place in Kolkata has to be raize the bar.
What we had-
∆ Veg kebab platter- this was basically our chakna.
∆ Sheesha- perfectly made. They use magic coal n we got a complimentary coal change so that was nice.
∆ strawberry mocktail- beautifully made my little sister loved it, so good we ordered another one. (Underage ppl are allowed but they can't hv drinks obviously)
∆ few shots, pints and dancing all the time.
Perfect girls night out. Definitely coming back whenever I am in Kolkata.
P.s- girls night out scored us complimentary shots which was really sweet.

Price is a bit high, they will make it higher by taking all kind of extra charges possible, like sitting charge restroom use charge etc etc lol 😂 They took 8% service charge on my bill after taking 18% of @GST. For what guys? U dont have money to pay your staffs? Explain.

Alas! Another place added to the list of Structural Only Micro Brewery in Kolkata.

Raize the bar, your bar is so much under that no matter how much u raise it, u ll barely be able to reach the ground.

Ambience - 2.5
Decor - 2
Music - God only knows coz it was so loud that even they would be getting disturbed
Hospitality - Gone to hospital
Food - 3.5 (the only saving grace)

Common it was a Saturday nite and I expect the DJ to do some justice to the name. The guy was thoroughly confused and was playing everything from Punjabi to Katy Perry. And there were people trying to do some robotic dance steps which was not even funny. I understand that the restaurant wouldn't have any control over the dance but for me it left a bad taste.

We had barely ordered few appetizers, and a main course as well, which we later realized that the guy taking the order has forgot to punch in the system. And the place was not even crowded.

-Cheese chilly toast was good, could have been a little less oily though.
- Melting mushroom is a must try not for the taste but for its presentation. The taste was not bad either.
- The nachos seemed to follow the DJs footstep and the preparation seemed to be Lil confused and overloaded with salt

If u r alone and want to grab a beer listening to some deafening music and u happen to be in sector 5, then this place can feature is your must try list

Well a very classy pub in the sector 5 area. The food was too notch based on price, quality and quantity. I had been very satisfied. It's a sports bar and you can enjoy a match with good quality food and drinks. Service had been quite good as well. Although the waiter forgot a drinks order and had to be reminded, overall it was quite amicable and swift. What I did not like was the DJ. Music was too loud and not very engrossing. It was difficult communicating. I also did not like the sitting arrangement. The tables are short and the sitting was not at all comfortable. But overall a good pub for a short hangout in a very convenient location.

Being made to wait for the so called driving officer from 10.30 am to 5 pm was tiring and irritating ... and finally with a month or so training the wife passed her driving test with flying colors... Hungry and tired #RAIZETHEBAR was the perfect place for relaxation, good music and amazing food.

The staffs were great... I liked the part where a staff  accepted his fault for not placing an order for Lasagna con pollo and instead he placed an order for Pizza Stracetti and came to apologize us and asked if we would take the pizza instead and we accepted it, after all we humans do make mistakes ..  And such a nice gesture shown by the staff he gave my wife a mock tail free of cost...  Much Appreciated ...   
Also not to forget finally i could enjoy Hoegaarden .. I was looking for this beer for over a year now in Kol ....  Last i guess i had it in Delhi...   
Anyways over all its an amazing place, amazing food and crazy music .. Will surely visit again...

Hoping to have a quite dinner with drinks I landed up at Raize The Bar with a bunch of friends.The restaurant has a sprawling space with two different section which gives it an added advantage over othr places in sector 5.Entering through the main door one faces the bar counter where the men are busy at their creations.The bar counter adjoining area has seating arrangements divided between high chairs and tables of 4.On the extreme left is a separate area for hosting private parties for different occasions.We seated ourselves in a table of 4.The server immediately showed up with what i would call quite a fat menu.The brewery is not yet functional but the cocktail menu is quite impressive.My friends ordered for a couple of beers given a bad throat while I ordered for a hookah which arrived in a jiffy.The hookah had a strong flavour of apple ...well​ made.Our food choices included the bbq chicken wings and grilled chicken breast in mushroom sauce served with mashed potatoes .The bbq sauce was too tangy as per my taste but my friends loved it.The mushroom sauce on the other hand was light ,flavourful with the perfect balance of salt and made a perfect combination for the grilled chicken.The mashed potato could be more creamier...well who complains with more cheese.The only issue was for a thursday the music was too loud.If you want to have a chilled out time head towards this place.

The ambience of this pub is amazing. The staffs are very courteous and attentive. For starters we took fish n chips and chilly chicken tangra style. Fish item was good but chilly chicken could have been better though that was suggested by the staff there. They serve some amazing platters for the main course and also in good quantities. We opted for Ami kolkata and Cilantro rice mix bowl and both were awesome. Ami kolkata was again suggested by a staff there who claimed that the chelo kabab would be better than Peter Cat even. Though I would not compare but definitely the one in raize the bar was one of the best chelo kebab i had. Would recommend this place specially for the food.

Ans. Like Raize the Bar.
 Raize the bar stood above my expectations. From the decor to  the ambience, from the food to the smoke, from the hospitality to the classiness, Raize the bar contents everything. Reader's should not think about the place much. Quickly grab your party shoes and hop in!

Definitely, One of the best places I have been to,in Kolkata. Located in Godrej Waterside building, Sector V Salt lake, I used to regularly cross the building, but never entered it, but I am glad, I finally did. Dont let the silent and deserted outside fool you, once you enter the place you will feel the energy inside the place.

Service: Too good.
We were warmly greeted at the entrance and guided to the table. The order was taken in a very professional way, and the whole experience right till the end was smooth.

Food: Quite good.
We had BBQ chicken wings which was really yum.
Then we had a Pizza. The crust was great though could have been better.
Finally we had the Fried ice cream which was mind blowing, both in taste as well as presentation.

Ambience: Excellent
The place has beautiful decor, thus we got a chance to click a lot of selfies. ;) The groovy music adds to the energy of the place.

Overall it was a great experience. Will certainly be visiting this place again.

This place is very close to my heart as I spend some of the most beautiful time of last few days of my college life with my friends here. 
The decor and the ambiance of this place is simply exquisite... The bar looks extremely beautiful during the evening (because of the lighting) and a prefect spot  to take pictures 😉. 
This place is huge with some interesting and comfortable seating arrangements. 
The price of the alcoholic beverages are bit higher than the usual price . 
The price of the food items are again on the higher side but it's totally worth it when it comes to the quality and taste.
The staff is super friendly and helpful and the service was super fast.

Visited RTB with friends on a Saturday night and came back absolutely satisfied! It's difficult to say what was more impressive - food, drinks, ambience, or service! This place was impressive on all the counts. We started with sangria, which was good - not great. Perhaps the weakest link in our tale as the bar kept raising with each subsequent order. Chilli cheese toast, stuffed mushrooms (ufff! To die for!!), the Bellini, loaded nachos - all well done! And the music - one of those evenings when the DJ just rules.. special mention of the DJ - it was a girl at the helm of it and she totally rocked the party! Kudos and more power!

Wonderful interiors. It's not very spacious, but whatever space they have, it's used pretty cleverly.
The wooden theme works well.

Good food. The chicken wings are so good, so's the chilli chicken. They didn't have calamari, which we wanted to order. Too bad. Slightly overpriced. The music is all remixes, sometimes of Adele's songs. Please don't do that. Take tips from The Grid and Monkey Bar.

For drinks, we just kept ordering pints of BIRA and Budweiser.
The smoking room is pretty cool. Skeleton-themed ashtrays and the ceiling is painted as a view from inside a grave.

Also, they take forever to bring a hookah to the table. So much so, that we cancelled ours after waiting for almost half an hour.

Overall, recommended. They've got very good food. Book a table through Zomato/Dineout to avoid waiting.

Been here. Amazing place to begin with. Dont let the deserted weekend surroundings fool you, the place is alive. The staff is friendly. And food is good. Drinks are a tad costly.

Special mention smoking room in a grave.

It's a lound pub. Music is too high to talk with friends, however the ambiance, food and service is too good. specifically liked the fish and chips, chicken steak, butter garlic prawn and kebabs :)

In the heart of It area, little relaxing time can be spend over here with friends and colleagues. :)

Visited this place on the occasion of office party. The starters and mocktails were good. Main course was not deliciously good but satisfactory to some extent. Amritsari fish and Rasmalai for dessert was really good. The ambience comprising of the dim lights and wooden decors was quite relaxing. Overall a decent place offering all the indulgences that one may choose from to relax.

Located at the ground floor of the opulent Godrej Waterside complex it is very easy to spot. The ambiance is very good and on a rainy day like today the view from the inside is very scenic. We went there on an impromptu lunch out plan. We tried the fish and chips and the Barbequed chicken wings as starters. The surprise of the day came in the form of melting mushrooms, the spicy and tangy taste of dish fused soo well together that it was just perfect. In the main course both Kungpao chicken and Tangra Kitchen was pretty good as combos. The fried ice cream was the perfect ending this outing deserved.
Would love to revisit, anytime.

I recently tried the buffet they have recently started. 499+taxes. However, they add the service tax as well in the bill which is optional. The menu was pretty good with a lot of variety- Chicken tikka, chili fish, veg spring rolls and some chilli paneer for starters.
Tom yum soup which was amazing. GI shots , ceasar salad, some more 3 varities of salads, papad, n mini buns. Then for main course- mutton lucknow style biriyani, chicken methi, Mexican noodles, fish in red wine, pindi chana, steam rice, some daal and don't remember the veg options much. For drinks there were 3 types of draught beer and mocktails. For deserts - mango ice cream with darsan and baked rasgulla which was the only disappointment.

Well, I visited RTB on a Monday and what a vibe. I'm in love with this place especially because of the food. As usual I forgot the name is my platter. 
All I can tell you is, this place is worth all your dime. 
"Take my money and make me happy." This place also serves hookah (which I'm not fond of).
Also, Shivangi is the PRO of this place and is a very humble person. I loved how she interacted with us after our bill was served :) 
GO VISIT :) 
Thank you

I didn't like the food or the drink as such. Pizza was good. But everything in the platter tasted the same. The ambience is okay. Waiters were friendly but that doesn't help if the food is not good enough.

Have heard many good things about this place and after visiting here a few weeks ago, I second that opinion. Raize The Bar is easily located at Sector 5 and is spacious pub and restaurant. The interiors are nicely done. The bar area looks great. Me and my friends ordered a Gumsupari Hookah and we're happily puffing away. In Food we had the:-
Pizza Provencal- Topped with olives and peppers. Was quite cheesy.
Chicken Lasagne- Awesome taste 💓💓
Kappa Makizushi Sushi- A form of vegetarian sushi. This was my first time trying sushi and I hated it completely.
The service was good. Staff was attentive and polite. Great place to come and have a good time. Cheers!

Before going to office had a little booze and good food at this brewery . The X factor about this place is that you get to be surrounded by big cylinders of beer and can witness beer making in the background . However having no dance floor to shake your leg makes it quite unreliable as the DJ plays good songs . The food was good and it had nice dips to complement your chicken . I went with one of my friend and had 3 pints of beer , one shot of smirnoff on the rocks ( less booze since office was calling at night 😛 ) , one chicken barbeque wings and a platter of chicken tikka kabab coated with oregano whose side dip was just yummy and in the dessert had an amazing dessert however the name seemed too big to be remembered 😁 Overall nice place however would not feel like going again as I did not get that vibe like other places .

Went to this place for lunch on a Sunday. Since they had a sizzler festival going on, we ordered the Singaporean Sizzler which was average. Really liked the melting mushrooms and RTB Pizza. Both of them are a must try and kudos to them for the innovative presentation of the melting mushrooms. The mocktails and dessert which we tried were good but nothing great.

Went to this place after hearing alot of good reviews from people.  So decided to check on it myself.. but.. the experience was faaaar from being great or even good. Ordered the veg kebab platter, had plans on ordering other stuffs but after having the platter cancelled the thought of ordering anything further. I think that's the drawback of bars, you DONT get good VEGETARIAN  food. 😐

Went to this place in the middle of a thunderstorm & rain last night with a friend. Was eyeing this place for a really really long time & finally decided to go for a couple of drinks & some food there. What can I say.. Starting from the amazing decor.. mood setting music.. to the drinks.. the food. After a round of our signature scotch whiskeys, the man who was serving us drinks suggested we go for The Group Shot since we craved for some Tequila & with all the 4 different flavours of it it was so good!! We also ordered a Kahlua & a Bailey's Irish cream.. the former being near to perfection, amazing blend of flavours. The latter could have been slightly better, but good nevertheless.
 For food we started of with a Chilli Chicken in Tangra style.. and then went on to order Chicken Teriyaki, a meaty pizza & another fish dish. Hungry as we were.. we just couldn't stop eating as soon as the food was being served :P Also since it was a post birthday celebration, the resto manager Shivangi was so kind & helpful in arranging a Brownie cake for my friend with a mini birthday song in the backdrop. It was so sweet of her to give us a gift card which we could avail a discount from the next time we visit. Thank you Ms Shivangi for the wonderful evening. Loved the place. Loved the food. The service. Staff behaviour. I can't wait to go back there once again. <3

Amazing view from the bar, loved that for starters. 

This can be located right from the main road. The interior is more or less like a brewery with beer tanks and barrels. 
High stools and spacious seating. 
We went there for a small span of time so, chilled with 2 points of beer and classic chicken tikka, as per their suggestion. 
It was really tasty. Succulent pieces of chicken tikka and cooked perfectly with the spices. Served with onions and pudina chutney in shot glasses. 

Good presentation and courteous staff. 
Would love to go visit again 💯

Decent place in sector 5 to hangout with friends or office buddies. Went to this place after office with some friends, though it was quite late but the ambience and the hospitality were really good.  

Tried to go for some beer,.but most of the good brands were unavailable. Same happened with other liquors also, so went for the drinks that were available at that moment. Also tried pizza and chilli baby corn to go with that. Food wa quite decent and the service was worth an appreciation. 
Would have given a better rating, but giving 3.5 due to the availability of drinks which was really disappointing.

One of the best place to hangout in sector 5. I loved it's ambience. A place apt even to go with family ❤
Food is delicious and the service makes it better! 
I heard a lot about it's Melting mushrooms and it is no doubt the best starter there.  We also had a tandoori kebab platter, two sizzlers and a Lebanese platter. I didn't think sizzler was upto the mark as compared to other main course platters which we had.  I had had a much better Lebanese platter than that served here. (Quantity was also not according to the standard Mezze platter) 
I loved the "Samui Stir fried greens"(rice based dish with gravy) and  "Veg terayaki platter"(Noodles with veggies). 
Must try for vegetarians💯

The music was so good that i ordered one more dish to be there . I loved the music and i going to come again . The only thing i didn't find good was it's Nacho's. I have never had such poor taste of it. It was pain to eat. Please improve that. That's why 4 star only.

I went to this place during a sizzler fiesta. Tried two veg sizzlers, one with cottage cheese, sour cream and rice. Another one with noodles and paneer Momo. Tried two non veg sizzlers, one Tandoori platter that came with chicken kebabs, dal makhani and kulcha. Another one with bhetki fish fry. All four items were great and had very unique taste. But I give 4 rating majorly because of the ambience of the place. The music, the decor and the amazing service will surely lift up your mood.

Now here is a pub where the food beats all else hands down! 

Nice little place located at Godrej Waterside. Feels like the right place to hang out as you walk in the doors. The decor is warm and you feel at ease soon enough. The only gripe I have is the lack of space to move around but that is entirely acceptable given the rest.

Food is where they outshine peers. If you find it tough to decide what to go for, you may always ask for the platters which are a selection of fine kebabs - fish, chicken, prawns and mutton sheekh. Kudos to the house chefs who certainly do justice to their trade. What I liked even more was that although the service was quick the dishes looked pretty and well presented.

The beer tasted very fresh and had that zing which is often missing from the bottled ones. The Sheesha was enjoyable as well. 

Music was good and set the right mood for the evening. 

Altogether a wonderful and relaxing experience I will certainly love to revisit.

Went after my exam and one time after that. 

Hookah is average. Service quality and reassurance of quality is great. Pizza is good. Quantity of pasta is very less, quality is decent.

Rest other food items were okayish. Like paneer tikka was okayish and another platter i ordered which comes with fried rice - the gravy was very bad. 


Ambience: Ambience is great. It has live music by a dj which is decent. Has got a dance floor. And the overall environment is very sexy.

Staff and the managers are very very well behaved.

If you're going for drinks make sure it doesnt create a hole in your pocket as you can book a table from dineout app and get 20-30% off on total bill. 

This place is amazing to go with friends or even family.

This place has got young crowd. Like 20-30 years old crowd. 

Only thing which they should improve on is overall re engineering of food by altering the tastes and including more options.

Variety is less ..a little bit more compared to pour house but doesnt match 10 downing street even a bit. 

Also to be noted that they dont keep beer cans which I think they do it purposely bcz they earn more on pints which is very bad. 

Sometimes you dont get few brands of whisky available. But thats quite normal.

Food was mouthwatering
Drinks were super awesome..
And hatsoff to all the servers who managed to deliver each and everything on table at time..
Since the pub was full packed I thought I may get slow service but I was wrong..

Highly impressed with their top class service and management !

I am a regular visitor of this restaurant and always it has proven a great place to chill out. Managers and chefs are very proactive to the services. Large menu with various options and chefs are always ready to customize your palate where I can rediscover my choice. Thanks to city of joy and the place.

This popular pub comes with a big reputation. After having been turned away the last time due to my partner being in shorts, I had to come back because I was excited to see how it is. It turned out to be quite a muted experience, ironically.

The sangria was overloaded with fruit, especially orange bitters. It made the drink nearly inedible. The mezze platter, I felt could have featured better variety. There were a couple of cheese cigar roll-like elements. I did not understand them and wouldn't have minded if they tasted good. The core hummus element was a failure. It had a funky taste. Not great, sadly. The vegetarian nigiri sushi fared better. The portion size was miniscule though. 

The biggest irritant was the decibel. Maybe I am an old crone but it was insanely loud that night. We and a couple of other tables repeatedly asked for the volume to be turned down. But no luck. We finally left with partially full stomachs and bleeding eardrums. Beyond me why they chose to keep blasting the music despite complaints.

I don't know how it is on other days but the day i went to the music was terrible, really bad bollywood scum music. The smoking zone was overcrowded at all times. The food was really bad. They charged us more for a drink which was cheaper on the menu saying it's a different brand. It was a terrible experience and if it's always like this i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone

Raize The Bar is a good place, they have not yet started microbrewery, ambience is no doubt superb... Music is good, food is amazing and drinks are mindblowing !!

I ordered for cigar rolls, Margherita pizza.. both tasted really good.. and for drinks I ordered Sangria white and Liberian Peninsula.. both were nice..
Presentation of the drinks and food is superb.
Hookah here is good..
I had good experience at this place.
Happy with their service, would give this place 5 on 5..
And would strongly recommend this place to my friends !

Overall ambience was good. Most of the staff's behavior was decent, excluding one who falsely claimed that the table of our choice was reserved which was not the case. Food quality was good too. Had a few pint of beer followed by a cocktail.

Normally, the cocktails in other pubs mostly taste good as they are generally a mixture of 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks with some smooth non-alcoholic flavours. But this specific cocktail, named Moscow Mule, was of horrible taste. It did not have any flavour in it. Just a mixture of Vodka n Beer with some Slices of Ginger in it. The way it was served was also weird which made it difficult to enjoy it even more.

Do try the Melting Mushroom and the Chicken Teriyaki. Both were delicious. And though the pasta preparations on the menu are all made of red sauce, they did make a yummy white sauce penne pasta on our request.

This review was Long overdue. Nonetheless, better late than never!!! So let's go pointwise:
1. Ambience: Really well made. Decor was quite interesting, especially the ashtrays in the smoking zone. Pretty impressive
2. Service: Very hospitable and courteous staff. What impressed me the most was that the Chef actually came to help suggest dishes that would suit me. Even the servers were very jolly, friendly and helpful.
3. Food and Drinks: For food, opted for a Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce going with the Chef's suggestion and throughly enjoyed the same. Drinks, had a Jacobs Creek and a Liberian Peninsula as mocktail. Again, very well made.

Overall, awesome place, awesome ambience, awesome food, awesome people. Coming back for sure!!!

I got a complementary deal from little and it's was completely worth. Thank you Team Little. I got 2 pint beer 🍺 in starter I preferred Crispy chilly baby corn followed by Pasta. Beer was chilled and perfect. Baby corn was perfect in taste and a very rare thing to be noticed they were all in same size. Pasta was just mind blowing I think I stopped talking after pasta was served. It had parmesan cheese cheery tomatoes drizzle of olive oil. Dear chef you made my day.

This is just a overhyped destination with nothing good. Soggy atmos and very cold reception. The food ordered was cheesy mushroom and veg kebab platter and both were horrible for taste buds. I really feel to have wasted 2 grands for this ridiculous place. 

Edit- 
They called us multiple times to visit and we took out time on their request. 
This time this was from the end of management and the Executive chef. We were served good food rather delicious one and the service was immaculate and the food was on the house. To be true they " Raized the Bar". Will visit again

Salt lake. The place where there are numerous offices and myriad young crowd waiting for a Friday night to come so they can get away from their job lives and enjoy a good evening. And when you have such a place in the midst of them, you know you have struck gold. 

Raize The Bar is a good place. The ambiance is very @pleasing and the mood of the place is perfect. The options in the menu are many and obviously drinks!!

We were a group of three people and for the first time in Kolkata with me, all the three vegetarians. Yay!! Finally some company. We ordered CRISPY CHILLY STYLE where we got paneer, potato and babycorn on one plate. The dish was good; nothing to complain about. The second dish was Pizza RTB and it had goat cheese and garlic chips at the top. The taste was completely different as the sauce base was not only tomatoes but a pesto style sauce. Overall a good experience in food department. 

Drinks : LIIT and Kiwi Margarita. Quite good. Appropriate alcohol content and the flavours were coming out nicely. 

Definitely worth a visit here. The entrance looks like an office building but then on the inside a perfect party place.

One of the most happening place in Sector5. This was my second visit to this place and I am as satisfied as the first day. We ordered chicken teriyaki for starters and a colourful mocktail called Lonely planet. Chicken was yumm. Then main coarse was another surprise for us, as it named A trip to Phuket. Pad thai noodle with basil chicken, both was super delicious. Dessert was my all time favourite Fried Ice cream. Apart from food the music was great.

Food quality is too good.Had 4 dishes ....Fish and chips , Chicken Tikka with Oregano , Lasagne with melted chicken and mushroom and the dessert (brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce)...Overall my experience was really good would recommend anybody anytime if someone needs music combined with some good food.

On a casual weekday, we decided to visit this place for lunch from office. When we entered the place, all of us loved the ambience and feel of the place. We ordered for a mocktail - Haakiwi which was quite nice and fresh lime soda which was so average. The sheesha we ordered KIwi Gum Supari - it was nice, nothing too good about it though. For starters we ordered a crispy chill platter kind of thing which had cottage cheese, baby corn and potatoes. It looked like all these are cooked in the same sauce, somehow not so satisfying but it was fine. The spinach cheese cigar rolls which we ordered were very tasty and we totally relished it. For main course we order for a asaparagus risotto and we specified we want vegetables as well, four topping pizza and a spaghetti aglio olio. The risotto was such a disappointment, it seemed like an asparagus khichi, absolutely not herbed. We request the staff to please herb it slightly but they refused to do it on the basis that now that u guys have added oregano and chilli flakes we can't do anything. The pizza and spaghetti we quite good but the portions were baby size in terms of the prize they charged. I was really excited to visit this place and the overall  experience is so disappointing,

Had gone there for my Office Party . The drinks and mocktails were pretty good . We had asked for unlimited alcohol and mocktails and they rightly delivered on that point .The starters that they had provided with the drinks were delicious. The non veg starters were pan fried fish and chicken kabab . The veg starters wrre chilli baby corn and paneer. The main course that they served were not at all up to the mark . I guess this was their way of cutting down on cost since we had booked a package for our office party. Every component served on the main course was awful and none of us enjoyed it. For dessert they served soupy vanilla icecream and dry chocolate mudcake. Overall , i would like to try their foods and see the quality when it's not a package deal and would suggest others to do the same. Otherwise , this place is good for drinks and finger foods. And yes there is one added bonus which is Dance floor.

This place has a micro brewery but its not open yet, still need to wait for that. And they have a very little collection of beers, almost no option. Food is awesome, my pick of the day were chiken wings in bbq sauce and teriyaki chicken.

One of my worst experiences..Half of the beers in the menu were not available. We ordered melting mushroom as our appetizer and the sauce served with it tasted very bad.For the main course we ordered the white sauce pasta which tasted fine but the chocolate sauce with it was absolutely inappropriate and tasted bad. The only good thing was the sheesha. Would never visit again nor would recommend it to anyone. Highly disappointing!!

Visited this place many times...😚
Situated at sec 5,college more...just beside the Godrej waterside..🙂

Nice ambiance,great food and chilled beer..what more u need for a great evening...🤗 They have a drinks counter set up in the middle of the bar, that will attract ur eyes fr sure..U can sit there and enjoy ur drink also..😇

My favorite food list here...

1. MELTING MUSHROOM : b=Beautifully served,on top of small bikars.. 6 pieces in total. With the cheese melting over the mushrooms and with a super tasty sauce,.. everytime I visit this place I order this one for sure. The mushrooms really just melts,and tastes a lot different from the other mushrooms dishes I had earlier..and the orange sauce with a zingy taste,gives a flavor blast in your mouth..😇

2. CHICKEN TERIYAKI : Shredded chicken with teriyaki sauce,cooked to perfection..goes well with beer and drinks.😄

3. NONVEG PLATTER : Two kinds of chicken kababs, one sik kabab..one fish kabab and prawn kabab...total 15 pieces..served with one sweet cream and green chutney. Each and every kabab tastes really good..😍.

4. PANEER TIKKA PLATTER : Six paneer pieces with three kind of varieties,,...colorful and tasty.👌

5. LASAGNA : One of the best lasagnas I ever had in town...the pastas r just cooked to perfection..with good amount of cheese and minced chicken layer and a tomato gravy..😍 If u are not ok with too much of cheese ..then don't go for it..else u will just love it 🤗

6. GRILLED CHICKEN BREST : They ask u to choose in which sauce u would like to have ur dish, I had chosen barbq sauce...and the result was great.🤗
Two big chicken breasts,grilled...and served with lots of veggies and mashed potato. 😄😃

The stuffs are really courteous..they suggest u what to order.😊 The hukkah and drinks are amazing too. 🤗
So a great place overall..with this amazing foods,drinks...classy ambiance and music at the background...🤘

Great food, great ambience, slightly pricey but totally worth it.
Chicken teriyaki , Chinese rice and chicken combo, chicken pizza (well portioned) and brownie with ice cream. Each item was different than the other and it was awesomeness defined as far as the brownie was concerned!! 
I was there for lunch but I am sure that the dinner would be a better deal considering the decor and music.

A recipe of a perfect evening with friends is cozy place accompanied with chilled beer,  refreshing sisha and sumptuous food. To set the mood thumping music by a DJ is like icing on the cake. Raize The Bar has scored full marks in all these departments. An impromptu decision to hit RTB has paid off with a memorable evening. 
In food we ordered Chilly Chicken in Tangra Style,  Fish and Chips,  Chicken Teriyaki. Also had Sushi Flavors of Tokyo and Meaty Pizza in the mains. Being a night sponsored by Budweiser we unfortunately had no other options for beer.  The best part is they will check with you to ensure the beer served is as per your likeness of temperature. Very rarely seen this gesture in pubs specially during peak hours. 
Music and speakers are one of the best I have witnessed recently. Crowd quality is very up market too. It's now the best pub in the area. Staffs are not only courteous but also smart chaps. There will be impact to your wallet but quality comes with a cost.

The definition of nightlife is changing in Kolkata and Raize The Bar is indeed one of the powerful catalysts steering the change.. Located conveniently in the Godrej Waterside, a 5 mins walk from College More.. The place is huge to give the ultimate feel to party animals and quite elegantly and carefully designed to impart the modern looks to this place.. This place houses the first micro-brewery in the locality and they specializes in innovative cocktails and specially crafted fusion foods to go well with your drinks..
Visited this place last month on Valentines weekend since they were one of the few places not to have any cover charge.. The place was delightfully decorated for the occasion and the vibes of this place will get you readily into the groove.. The vibrant music will set the tune for a memorable evening and the ambience will allow you to relax and enjoy your drinks and tidbits or even dance to the pop numbers.. You will encounter a huge bar as soon as you enter, the lanterns, the glass pane and the wooden decors add further to the grandeur.. Since the place was choc-a-bloc we were given high bar stools adjacent to the bar, though a bit inconvenient but still manageable.. The only issue I felt was the small dance floor and as the night got young, people gathered on the floor blocking the way out of the restaurant.. Service was quite professional and even on a mostly busy night they never failed to attend our call.. The menu is quite extensive with an interesting selection of dishes, and based on server’s advice we ordered:
Manhattan: One of the most celebrated and popular cocktails globally made from whiskey, angostura bitters and vermouth.. The blend was apt and the drink was strong enough to my likings..
Orange Juice: Fresh and chilled, nothing more to add..
Green Chilly Chicken: This dish caught my attention as soon as I read the menu.. Server claimed it to be their specialty and boy this is some serious flavor.. Loved the punch and twist with Calcuttan’s favorite dish, the lemongrass and coriander paste added a new dimension to the dish and a respite from the usual starters..
Calamari Fritto: Served with French Fries, loved the presentation in a set of conical apparatus.. The accompanied sweetened tamarind chutney perfectly complemented the crunchy squid rings.. A perfect companion for some serious booze..
A Trip To Phuket: A delectable combo platter with a catchy name.. Pad Thai Noodles and Basil Chicken accompanied with Kimchi salad.. Loved the tangy, nutty flat noodles with a slightly sweetish touch.. The heat and tanginess of the basil chicken complemented perfectly the subtle flavors of the pad thai..
We were too full by this time and sadly most of the deserts were not available that night.. Still I will appreciate them for the minimal serving time and the aesthetic plating of the dishes.. This place truly gives a feel of modern global cuisine and hospitality to the people of Kolkata.. Overall our total cheque was Rs.1909/- (all incl.) for 2 people and even though the prices are steeper compared to the portions of dishes served, the environment and experience will compensate for the same..
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 4/5

'Raize The Bar' is located at Godrej Waterside, Near College More, Sector 5, Salt Lake.Yesterday I've been there with my friends for dinner.First of all ambience is good,low light & loud music with Dj,there is also dance floor.Staffs are friendly,they offered us Ghol for holi special.Atfirst we ordered 'Chicken Teriyaki' as starter.It is little sweet,japanese preparation.We also ordered here some alchohlic drinks like Gin with Tonic water,Long Island Iced Tea & mocktail like 'Liberian Peninsula'- it is mind blowing,fully mixed with orange,lemon grass,palm sugar & chilli..Then we tasted here 'Chilly Chicken Tangra Style','Soy Braised Drums of Heaven' & 'Green Chilly Chicken' as starters.All starters are delicious.'Soy Braised Drums of Heaven' is extremely delicious,fully chicken marinated with sauce & spice.Then we ordered main course like platter.The platters are  'A trip to Phuket (Basil Chicken with pad thai noodles and pickled vegetables)',Pad Thai noodles is very tasty but basil chicken is not up to mark.Other platter is 'Tangra Kitchen Platter (Chilly Chicken with Burnt Garlic Fried Rice),rice & chicken both are tasty.Atlast we ordered here  'Fried Ice-cream with caramel & Cointreau Sauce' & 'Brownie with vanilla ice-cream served with chocolate sauce' as desserts.Both are tasty.All over very good experience.Price is reasonable.They also charged 8% service charge.

I am not a party person but this place got me grooving. The decor is catchy  and the sitting arrangements quite cheerful. The food was high on the taste quotient and the mocktails were a heavenly affair.  I had  quite a number of beverages and calling a favorite would be hard. They have really mastered the art of mixing drinks alcoholic or non alcoholic.

Went to this pub last week, which literally Raized the bar for me, awsm decor, good music and very frndly staff. Being a hardcore non vegetarian I generally opt for non veg, but this place proved that even vegetarian food can be good. Melting Mushroom was mouth watering, barbq chicken wings, meaty pizza, chicken teriyaki was best I had so far. To quench our thirst we ordered normal beers, Hawaiian sundowner, Breakfast Martini. It was a very satisfying experience. Great job guys..

Finally a great pub in Kolkata. Quite huge place with live music, breweries all around, nice decor, good crowd and last but not the least, excellent food and beverages. Ambience is good although a bit slow service. Visited this particular place couple of months back and we have tried Dahi ke kebab, meaty pizza, melting mushrooms. sangria, ginger martinis, classic margarita, kahlua flavoured mascarpone and a sheesha. Food decoration is eye catching although a little over price. But the quality of food and beverages are absolutely mind blowing. Service should be little better as I felt!

This place definitely makes it to one of my favourite places in the city. It would have been so much more popular if it was located in Park Street or somewhere down south,I bet but it's pretty popular in Sector V owing to its convenient location and car parking facility. I loved their cocktails menu.  We tried the Caprioska, Ginger Martini, beer and a few mocktails like the Haakiwi etc. Coming to the food, we had the paneer tikka platter and the chilli cheese toast. Their servings are decent and the chilly cheese toast is highly recommended. 
The ambience is amazing with the bar at the centre, one side of the joint having loud music and hookah and the other side is relatively calmer with beautiful curtains and lighting. 
Staff is decent and the place is a must for a hangout with friends. Add it to your wishlist if you haven't.

We ordered a bottle of beer and Chicken lasagne. 
The food was too tasty. The thing which was shocking was that, the waiters didn't even serve us a glass of water. Though we were the only customers there apart from a group of three guys. That was really disappointing as the service tax was around Rs.200 yet they failed to serve us a glass of water. We asked for water after we had our food. And the staff didn't even apologise for the inconvenience. Food was good bt service was really very disappointing.

Definitely the mini kathi rolls, tangra style chill chicken and calamari risotto for appetizers.
And you'll know why it's "Raize  the Bar."
For main course, the sea food platter, grilled bhetki and grilled chicken breast.
And if you're are a group of 5-6 people, this is more than enough food for you all and it's worth every penny!

We ordered chilly chicken tagra style(too salty),a trip to phuket(it was also too salty, wasted a lot),vegetarian kebab platter(too sweet and not a single kebab was edible),wasabi touched nigiri(good) and Haakiwi(best thing we ordered).Ambiance was good but music was too loud.It was too difficult to communicate.

They need to be better when it comes to more variety. Food was amazing. The dj was good enough. He kept the mood on all along. All I hope is that next time when I visit the place, they have their microbrewery up and working. 
You did "raize" the bar indeed.

I visited this place on 2nd Jan'17. The ambiance was very satisfying and was the restaurants was very well maintained. But when the bill arrived,  I see they have charged Rs 25 for a bottle of water which had MRP Rs 10. I questioned them as to why they are violating the "law of charging packaged water and soft drinks strictly on MRP". They argued that "you have to pay full amount. We cannot do anything".

Again, they charged Service Charge of Rs 54. But as per law passed on 2nd Jan'17, customers have the right not to pay any Service Charge. All total, I was charged extra Rs 69 unnecessarily.

I do not understand why restaurants of such high repute do not follow the law and still continue to increase profits the unethical way. Even the government is not seen to be taking bold measures to implement a law created many many days ago. This particular incident of overcharging customers totally ruined our experience. I have also written about this to the Consumer Court.

Location is perfect for after office parties and drinks. Situated in Salt Lake Sector 5 area and surrounded by corporate offices, this place attracts plenty of people from close by offices to party and enjoy.

The food and the ambiance is too good. The service is worth recommending and the music is over the top. 

The only thing i found that these guys can improve upon is that all varieties of beers are not available even though listed in their menu and this thing turns of people. On my visit, only 2 kinds of beers were available and that is something that should not be happening at such a place.

Overall, a nice experience and one can always drop by to have fun and relax with your friends and colleagues.

If you haven't tried out Raize the Bar yet, please do. It has raised the effin' bar. Food, beverage, service, ambience, everything simply spot on.

Situated at Godrej Waterside building, this place is very easy to locate. The ambience is nice. The decor is decent with wooden furnitures and old school lanterns. The barrels of the beer are visible right outside the glass walls of the restaurant. The waiters are all well trained, very polite, and helpful. They are prompt in taking orders and serving. 

Absolutely no complaint about the food or the beverages. We begun with sangria, ginger martini, and classic margarita. For food we had dahi kebab, melting mushrooms, meaty pizza and Kahula flavoured mascarpone. The dahi kebab was delicious. The saffron yogurt dip gave it a fantastic punch. The melting mushrooms was a simple dish but was very appetizing. Loved the dip made by sweet chili sauce and garlic. The pizza was good (if not extraordinary). The Kahula flavoured mascarpone was out of the world. Perfectly balanced. No extra sweetness. The bitterness of the coffee did go perfectly with the cheese.

P.S. please keep the option for the hot beverages (tea or coffee) available, it's winter and people badly need these often.

This is by far the best restaurant cum bar in sector five, even better than opium. Ambiance, service, food, drink everything top notch. Seven of us went there for a small office party and we enjoyed thoroughly. Though the wooden chairs are little uncomfortable but rest are excellent. Service is excellent, you just raise your hand and someone will come to you. They are taking 8% service charge so good service is quite natural I guess! Waiters are polite and knowledgeable. We ordered some alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks along with many veg and non veg starters, didn't take any main course. Drinks were good and food excellent. Ordered pan fried chili fish, soy braised drumsticks, jhinga nisha, pasandeeda paneer, barbeq chicken wings, sarson mahi tikka, dahi ke kabab. All of them were absolutely delightful, special mention goes to dahi kabab, too good. Would have given 5 stars but deducting 0.5 marks as they don't serve any mutton item and taxes are really high, otherwise had a great time there..

A really spacious and cool pub located in sector 5. I liked the interiors a lot, low lights, wooden seating with lanterns and ropes for decoration. I wish it was a microbrewery by now as Calcutta desperately needs one by now. The alcohol rates are decent and the food quality is really good for the prices. I had the chili cheese toast and BBQ chicken wings and loved both. The mezze platter looked interesting too. 
I wish the service was more swift and the music a little toned down, the high volume makes it difficult to have conversations and is disturbing sometimes.

A new and a happening place in town for youngsters, i tried the fish & chips and tangra style chilli chicken for the starters. Fish & chips were good but could have been better, chilli chicken was pretty regular. For the main course i tried grilled bhetki and it was good.A trip to Phuket' was also good and recommended. I also tried 'Ami kolkata' which was chelo kebab and it was amazing, very very well cooked and presented. Very much recommended. The cilantro rice with chicken was good. Quantity was sufficient, quality was upto the mark. Overall a good experience. '

Newly opend pub at Salt Lake sector v near college more. Its a micro brewery pub . They have got the liquor licence but still waiting for the micro brewery licence. The place has already made a big name in kolkata.  The food which they serve is up to the standard of any other 5 star hotel. Service wise they are the best in the city. Staffs are very polite  .smart. quick with full of positive attitude . Music is just out standing. Ambience is like a county side pub. Interior is excellent . I strongly recommend this place all kolkata people .

This place is supposed to be a microbrewery, but it isn't, which is really a big disappointment. They serve liquor on Friday and weekends only, as they haven't got the license yet!!
But the food is upto the mark. We had ordered a chicken lasagne and cheesy mushroom. The garnishing and the presentation of the cheesy mushroom was eye catchy and tasty too!! 
Melting mushrooms topped with creamy cheese served on a beaker with tangy chili sauce.
We had also ordered a chocolate shake, a drink name lonely planet, and a hookah. The drink was very refreshing.
Would like to come here again for the hookah and the lovely cheesy mushroom 😍

I might agree with all the other positive feedback that other users have given , but if the bar really has so much preference towards the private parties organised in their premises, they must keep a separate sound proof section for such gatherings (where the party has the freedom to play any list of  songs in any language around the globe, BUT THESE SONGS CANNOT BE FOR THE ENTIRE GENTRY OF THE CLUB WHEN ITS NOT SPECIFIED AS SUCH A NIGHT ). Very biased and preferential environment 

Otherwise food was good but the music spoiled the entire time !

And I'm gonna say this too ! "Raize the Bar, you have for sure Raised the effin Bar !" Great going ! First ever Micro Brewery In Kolkata !

I'd like to keep my review short, so, here it goes.

Ambience - Full on 10 !
Staff - 10 !
Food Taste - An 8 ! The Biryani was bad. Really bad.
Food Presentation - Ten !
Music - Not Sure.

Must Try - Na Real and Lebanese Platter.

Word of Advice - Why Edm and Hindi Dance Songs all the time when you have the Legend in the background ? Should keep different genres on specific days. Biryani should definitely be improved upon.

The food is really bad and the rating is sky high and too exaggerated for a place with such average quality of food and dishes with comparatively such high price.
The ambience is really nice though and the brewery is a welcome change in the city and certainly the high point to brag about for the owners.
Seemed like a nice place to hangout with friends but definitely a disastrous place for lunch.
The service is also very bad and the waiters are lazy to say the least. So overall not a must visit type of place and certainly does not leave much good impressions.
Altgough the menu boasts of lobster and salmon but considering the fact that the normal dishes are so bad I wouldn't waste money and take any chances with the expensive ones. 
Would prefer Chilli's or other places of this sort.

We have been to this restaurant for lunch hearing very good reviews about the restaurant. But we were extremely disappointed with the food and service. It took almost more than 1hr 30 m to get the food and that too we did not get the complete order. After such a long wait and hoping that the food will be good, but the platter and other dishes were not at all good comparing the price that they are charging. There are much better options. The quantity they serve for a dish is not even sufficient for one person. We even had to ask for spoons and forks multiple times. And moreover they do not even give finger bowls. They should at least improve their service if not the food quality. We had order Seafood platter, meat platter, non-veg platter, grilled chicken with cilantro rice and some chinese combo. Horrible experience. I will not recommend it at all.

Raize the bar is a good sized pub located in salt lake. We reached there at around 9Pm on a Friday night and it was full to the brim but we somehow managed to get a table here. 

We ordered for a variety of things such as: 
Stuffed Mushrooms - even though this may sound mundane, the presentation was key in this case as the mushrooms were kept atop a flask which had Thai sweet chilli sauce in it to accompany the mushroom, it was cheesy and the sauce gave it the kick and balance that it needed, a great dish overall.
Cigar Rolls - We ordered the cigar rolls which were cheesy and even had cottage cheese in it as well, it was accompanied by a cheesy sauce as well which made it absolutely great, another great dish.
RTB pizza - This was, hands down, one of the better pizzas I've had in the city, it had sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, garlic chips and sour cream. It was so tasty, we ended up ordering 2 of the same pizzas.

Overall a great experience with no complaints from service or quality of food. There are huge expectations from this place after seeing that they plan to open a full scale brewery down there. Cannot wait for that to open up.

location- indus tower ground floor. Parking facility available inside the complex. 
type of cuisine- cafe, hookah
serves alcoholic beverages. No happy hours. 

Pros- ambience, music, service

we ordered vegetarian kabab platter and french fries. The kabab platter was good containing aloo kabab, baby corn, brocolli, paneer tikka, two kabab seekh (all in quantity of 3-4) with two types of sauces; enough for 2 people. 

Good place to hangout with your gang. Loud volume, mostly played hindi tracks. Have a big screen so we didn't miss out on our Ind vs NZ ODI match. Service is good.

Another new pub in the Sector 5 of Kolkata, this place is quite refreshing among all of them. Already been here thrice in last 1 month and the loved each outing. Situated near Clge more, the signboard outside is quite eye catching.
About the food, almost all of them are delicious. The Chello kebab platter stands out of them. Other dishes like Fish Orly, Chicken Drumsticks, Mixed Meat Platter, Fish n Chips are also pretty good. Shisha can be availed while Drinks have been started recently.
However despite being a Microbrewery, they still have not started dishing out fresh Beer which is a shame (We all so very want it badly). Hope they can start it soon and will be looking forward to it.
The ambience and the service is nice, but the Music is sometimes too loud to have a normal conversation with friends!
Hope they keep it up and I will be back here soon :)

Came to this particular place late night around 8 pm with some of my friends. Have been hearing the name of this place from quite a long time. Located at Salt Lake Sector 5 area in a very cool and calm location where you don't listen a sound but when you get in to this place its all Loud music. 
Ambiance looks pretty dark but it has been interiored really well. They also have alive band facility if i am not mistaken. You find some decent crowd here having drinks and Hukkahs.
Mostly famous for their Cocktails, Mocktails as well as Hukkah. As a non drinker i tried their Mocktails first in forms of Lonely Planet and Antiquity Blue. Both the drinks were very decent and refreshing. Served in the huge glasses. Both the drinks tasted extremely well and same till the last drop.
Then we ordered some of their Starters in forms of Pan Fried Chilli, Fish Orly and Basket of Desi. Pan fried chilli was spot on with the taste, it contained the flvours really well with the semi gravy. Fish Orly was nt too behind with the divine flavour. Bucket of desi was another good pick that everybody liked on the table. 
The sudden visit was really successful enough and i had a good time listening the loud music with the crowd keep coming in.

The best place to party in & around salt lake. Marvellous ambience & fantastic decor. The staff are very cordial, the wooden tables are nice and add to the sheer beauty of the place. The bar is well designed and the televisions are well placed as well.

We ordered the expresso Martini, the lemon mojito & a cranberry breezer, a non veg kebab platter consisting of four types of kebabs in quantity of three and the melting mushrooms. The kebab platter had Sarson Mahi tikka, tandoori prawns, chicken Reshmi kebab and Shashi lamb kebab. The fish was the best I have tasted till now, followed by the lamb and the prawn and chicken. The melting mushrooms was over-hyped IMO but tested fine.

The price is definitely on the steeper side and would wait for their in-house beers once they begin serving. Would definitely recommend a friend.

Review: Raize The Bar
A short section by section review, focusing on major aspects.

Location - 3.5/5
At Sector 5 Saltlake, near College more, though not very "reachable" from all parts of Kolkata, unless you have your own car, but at a quite neighborhood it is not so difficult to find.

Facilities - 3.5/5
We couldn't find any dedicated parking facility, but not too difficult to find one beyond office hours in that part of Saltlake. Can be a problem during office hours situated close to College more area (one of the busiest area of Sector 5) No entry fees, like most other pubs.

Ambiance - 3.5/5
In case of a bar/ pub it matters the most in my opinion. You well be welcomed by the huge entry with big glowing name by its side, difficult to miss even when one drives by the place. Entering the gate, at the end of stairs you will be attended by a small team, and will be allowed to enter the main area after providing them your details like most standard places. Lighting and interior is good, including many type of sitting arrangements to suit romantic couples to a group of friends, from sports & loud music lovers to the people who wants to have a conversation. Music is a little to loud for a place with no dedicated dance floor. Dedicated smoking zone and good washroom is a plus. Nothing exceptionally good in this front.

Drinks & Food - 3/5
Very standard, though not exactly feels very value for money as per the quantity-vs-price ratio. That said, it is really not a place for "food" at itself, though for having with drinks & hookah those are good. Taste & freshness of the food leaves nothing to complain about. If you are thinking of a quite evening with some friends, and a chat over a few drinks with some eatables, a budget of 1.5k+ per head is advised, unless you limit yourself only to a few beers.

Service - 4/5
The attendants are courteous and ready to help. But in busy hours, they take more time for serving/ repeating drinks than you would like.

Overall - 3.5/5
Standard pub with foods that are targeted mostly for having with the drinks and the hookah, the place will be liked by most of the young people with a good amount to spend, but strictly not for those who will like to end the evening with a proper dinner & some drinks for a reasonable amount of money.

Woah! Someplace has raised the bar for the standard eating joints in Kolkata. 
The collection of cocktails and mocktails is classic. A bit over priced though.
For the food. Hats off to the chef and the team who have worked wonders in the kitchen. The main course is absolutely wonderful, be it teriyaki platter or pasta or khou suey. Same goes for the starters. I didn't like the lebanese platter though. It was bland and not tasty. Crispy corns were perfect in taste. So was the pasta. 
The ambience and the decor is wonderful. A must place to visit. 
P.S. I thoroughly enjoyed the burnt garlic fried rice.

As per its name, this opening has certainly raised the bar for night life in the IT area of the town. The reception is okay but could be warmer.

Food and cocktails are good as well. The ambiance is uber cool as well. 

All in all, another fine place to groove and spend some time with the ones who matter. 🙃

Keep munching.

New block in the town. More precisely in sector 5. I was searching for good cafe/ restaurant around sector 5. And I suddenly got this raize the bar. So, it was my wishlist from then.

Location:
___________________
it is near college more of sector 5. On the ground floor of godrez water side building.

Ambience and decor: 
__________________________
we visited this place on the lunch time. So we felt the ambience is pretty decent.
And the décor is just superb. The whole bar having a wodden touch with haricane type light. Just amazing.
We pretend that it would be lovely to give a visit at night. But yes they have loud dj and total buzy dance floor at night.

So, if u just want to give adda, spent good time and date good food. Do visit in day time.

Now coming to the main segment food
__________________________________________

Starters:
-----------------
1. Sarsoo mahi tikka: one of the best fish tikka I have ever had. Amazing in taste. Bhetki fish marinated in mustard and yogurt sauce. And they served it with mint chutney. Just owssum.

2. Chicken teriyaki: another owsum. Grilled chicken in teriyaki sauce.

3. Calamari fritoo: air fried squid. This is just amazing. They served it with a sauce and French fries. Owssumm.

Main course:
-------------------------
1. Cilantro rice fresh mix bowl : grilled chicken served with corn, bean , veggies and cilantro rice. Good in taste. 

2. Grilled Kolkata bhetki: grilled 4 pieces of bhetki with tomato and almond chutney and vegetables. Owssum. 

3. Tangra kitchen platter: nothing special about this dish. Chili chicken with rice and vegetables. But the taste and food quality is just superb.

4. Crips skin Atlantic salmon: this is the 1st time I have tasted salmon. And it's very good in taste.
And the orange punch with the fish is just just amazing. 

Beverages:
--------------------------

The have quiet a good option in their mocktail also.

1. Calm down: it is a mix of oolong tea, cucumber and lime. Very flat. Did not like it.

2. Lonely planet: owssumm one. mix of guava, lime grass, reps berry. Amazing in taste.

3. Sangria red: made of red wine and small pieces of fruit. In one one out of the world. Just have it. Its superb.


An amazing experience with good service and owssum and tastey food. Great quantity and quality.

Yes, price is in higher side. Cost 4500 INR for 5.

To the management: keep it up. I was wondering what make the bar having such a amazing rating in zomato. I got my answer. Just maintain the taste , quality and price. :) Cheers....

This place has a nice ambiance and courteous staff. The food is good though not exceptional. However ,the prices for both food and drinks are steeper than other similar lounge bars in the same locality. Hookah prices seemed normal. Another disappointment is that the brewery is yet to be functional. So if you're a fan of those giant draught beer towers, boots and pitchers, be warned..those are yet to roll out. You may try out their cocktail pitchers though.I believe once the brewery starts brewing, this place will start drawing in the thirsty crowds by the dozens.

One of the most spacious pubs/lounges in Saltlake vicinity, located on the ground floor of Godrej Waterside. The interior will remind you of a micro brewery or a pub of Bangalore or Pune. Perfectly illuminated, widespread bar counter, high rise wooden chairs, loud music, young and vibrant crowd; altogether have created a perfect ambience to hang out with your friends and have a relaxing time over a bottle of beer. The food is outstanding here. Generally, pubs don't focus much on the presentation aspect of dishes but this place is an exception.
We had ordered :
#Melting Mushroom - button mushroom stuffed with cheese, served with a tangy dip. The presentation was quite unique, they served it on narrow-neck flasks, mostly found in a chemistry lab.
#BBQ chicken wings - the confluence of the smell of charcoal and BBQ sauce had created a mouth-watering effect.
#Lamb Shish Taouk - basically a falafel kind of dish, made out of minced lamb.
#Chciken Teriyaki - not the traditional kind of teriyaki. Tastes tangy... pieces of chickens are very succulent. A Must try here.
#Green chilly chicken - another highly recommended dish here.
#Chilly cheese toast
#Captain Morgan rum flavoured melting chocolate - must try in dessert
#Fried ice-cream with Caramel and Cointreau sauce - a coating of caramel and cointreau sauce on the scoops of vanilla ice-cream. A delight for ice-cream lover.
The pricing is little bit on the higher side. We, four guys, ate food worth of INR. 5600 but after levying tax, it came up to around INR 7200, which is bit creepy :p .
The restro staffs are very courteous here. Another striking feature of this place is that the serving-dishes are quite unique. They have got their own beer brewing machines which are going to be operative soon.

Well, they indeed have “raised the bar” in terms of food, ambience as well as service in the food business – and that also – quite significantly. I became quite amazed with the ambience once I entered this place – a micro-brewery which serves great food also. I don’t quite often enter pubs, since I don’t have cocktails, no sheesha, no funny business – no nothing……….

You get to see quite a lot of beer being promoted by way of posters and fancy idioms - beer being branded as “healthy”, beer keeping you happy, beer rhyming with cheers! – and what not. And why not so, as they produce their own beer! Mind it, this café based in the Godrej Waterside building, Sector 5, Saltlake could be the next hangout place for beer and hookah freaks.

They do have a small dedicated dance floor – but sadly, this did not find many takers. They provide majorly wooden seating but sofas are also available.

We kick-started with some tasty virgin-mojito brimming with ice cubes – some cold coffee also available, which I did not taste. Man …… they did make the mojito appear sexy – pudina and lemon pieces floating on top and a stylish straw drowned in it. Thereafter, starters started as follows:-

Babycorn – nice and crispy

French fries – okayish (I do not enjoy French fries too much – was tasty nevertheless)

Seekh kabab- very nice, but too spicy

Corn kebab – fine

Aloo kebab – A mediocre 

Phool gobhi kebab – good one!

Chilly paneer – tasty – mind the chilly pieces therein though

Pan pizza – nice to see a “RECTANGLE” (yes you read that right) pizza – topped with jalapenos, capsicum and mozzarella – but a very promising looking item definitely falling way below expectations!

Paneer tikka – Great (mind the huge size)

Mint chutney served along was pretty mediocre – owing to the bits and pieces of uncrushed coriander.

This was followed with some soft drink (Coke served in the name of Thumbs up). It is remarkable that I enjoyed fodder while watching the Olympics on the LCD atop a wall!

Moving to the mains, we started off with Tomato Shorba – crotons included as well as cream atop! Thereafter, Butter roti as well as tandoori and naans were served. Black daal was fascinating and paneer butter masala – sublime, especially when Raita was available. A decent salad range and condiments (cucumber, tomato, onions, yellow carrots, green chilly, lemons) as well as kachumer and papads were served. Corn palak was fine, so was kofta! I did not taste their Chinese items – Chowmein as well as paneer! 

Hyderabadi dum biryani was fine – though not as good as it appeared – had a balanced vegetable content. 

Once filled to the brim, we moved on to the desserts, rasmalai was fine – with great pista, kesar and malai content, but sadly I could have just a single piece of it. I had some chocolate cakes and then ….. dhan te nan …… MONTE CARLO – a simple path to heaven. Had a total 3 servings thereof …… mmmmmmmmmmmm. Who does not love a happy ending?

We finally concluded with some superb mouth freshners.

Service is exceptional and the staff try to satisfy all consumer needs – prices charged being on the higher side. I tag this place as a must visit and highly recommended. 

P.S.:- The hefty parking fees hurt me a lot (120 bucks), but I don’t really blame them as I understand that this is a rental/ leased property.

I also apologize to fellow Zomans that pics are dim owing to dearth of light at the café!

I m really unable to understand who has given them.to run a lounge or restaurant as they are unable to give water to their guest.
They are simply charging Rs 55/- for a 500ml bottle, when asked to give filter water they have a simple reply sir " pani ka taste kharab hae " 
If this is so why they don't supply mineral water free and above all what for the authorities or the so called food inspectors waiting for.

Went to this place late evening to meet an old friend. Very near to the hustle bustle of sector 5 area of salt lake, this place is frequented by office goers.

The brewery for serving fresh draught beer catches the eyes as you enter, but you soon get to know it is still not open. Anyway had the regular fare of Sheesha  and Chilly Paneer Starter. Sheesha was definitely very smooth and starter was fine.

Service was a little slow even though a handful of tables were empty on a Friday night.

Overall a nice addition to the city night life. Would love the Brewery to open soon.

This place is an addition to the few pubs that exist in Calcutta presently. Had been there on a Sunday. It was not much crowded thankfully. Maybe because people still are not much aware of its existence or maybe because commuting from there becomes difficult if you do not have your own vehicle especially at night. 

My friend and I had ordered one beer-a pint of Budweiser and chicken in some spicy sauce( I do not remember the name, was probably some sort of kebab)and a hookah. The chicken was very tasty. The beer was priced like any other expensive pub in Calcutta. The hookah was their special hookah but i did not find any unique  speciality in the hookah. Tasted like a normal 'paanch paan' served in average hookah parlours. 
The ambience was okay. But music was too loud. They are going to start their brewery very soon. So waiting for it. Once a visit is worthwhile.

L & T employees working in the same building get a 10% discount on the food bill.

Had been there last evening to grab a drink after what was a rather hectic 6day week at work. Though this place is there for quite a long time, I mean my last visit here was in April but they weren't yet functional then.
Yesterday my fiance was very happy and eager to try out this place and we were not disappointed. Its a very pumped up place to say the least, good music, great interiors and decor, brilliant food with an equally great service.

Being a Saturday, had to stick to veg, though was wishing was here on any other day after seeing what the menu has in store for all non veg lovers. A pleasure to the taste buds and a plethora of delicacies in Indian, Continental and World cuisine, this place is the place to be if you are looking for great food in sector 5.

Located in the Ground floor of the Godrej Waterside Building, the nearest landmark is college more in Sector 5.
My fiance and I ordered the Tangra Style Chilli Paneer for starters along with a Sangria for the lady and a cool beer for myself. The chilli paneer was really good in quantity and tasted great.

For mains, we ordered the Veg Spaghetti Aglio Olio and The Veg Khaosuey with Japanese Udon Noodles. Once again the food was simply awesome. One of the cities finest Aglio Olio according to Sananya and I believe her coz she has had the dish in almost every place that serves it. The Khaosuey was a visual treat as well as a treat to the tastebuds.

The food was so good that we absolutely had no issues with eating veg 😊😊😊.

The service was fantastic. All in all an experience that makes a mark. Coming back next weekend.

The bars have really been raised with this wonderful offering at salt lake!! The extra delicious food along with the music is a warm welcome to the tired souls! Though the beer hasn't start brewing yet but once it starts there's no looking back. Very creative interiors instantly uplifts your mood and gets you into the mood. They serve alcohol on the weekends so no better place to party now!! A must visit for all if u don't want to miss a too perfect place!!

Another excellent place! Food is delicious. Hookah is of different class altogether! We have our specials made every time we visit  this place. :)Music is super awesome and the ambience is great too! Deducting 0.5 because of the seats. After 2 continuous hours of hookah, we do not really need those high seats to sit up straight. A cozy seating arrangement would be most welcome.To summarize:
Food - 4.5/5Music - 4.5/5Ambience - 4/5 (do not really appreciate that minors are allowed in too even if there is a separate hookah and alcohol free zone)Staff - 5/5 (always happy to help and quiet friendly)Overall strongly recommended :)

Please please please bring alcohol. It will take out all competition in the whole of Sector 5. Brilliant, classy and elegant interiors. Music is of the right volume. And oh the FOOD. It was beautiful. We had non veg platter, pasta, pizza and hookah. All were perfect. Their non veg platter is the best I have had in a really long time. But please bring alcohol. I wouldn't even think of going anywhere else. Please keep up the good food. And oh yes the space is hugeeeeee inside. Still a little bit unused. Prices are reasonable. The bill did not give us a shock and yes the parking is a big problem there. Otherwise enjoyed a lot. :)

Located near the ring road in Sector V, Raize the Bar is a nice looking newest kid pub joining the the already overcrowded pub cum restaurant bandwagon. Catering primarily to office goers who drop in to celebrate happy occasions, to the henpecked employees badmouthing the bosses after a hard day at work or employees fuming over some bad co-workers this place provides the ideal foil of good food and drinks at standard pub rates. The food is real good quality which sets this place apart from the other competitors operating in the area. 

Cons- No valet parking available. Parking at Godrej Waterside @ INR 35 per hour burns a hole in the pocket.

The music blares at too loud a pitch thereby being a deterrent to have conversations while you sip and eat.

The place and ambience is quite good and sporty. Although drinks couldn't be served because of some license problem of theirs. I ordered 'moroccan cigar rolls' in the appetiser and 'Cilantro rice with fresh mix bowl' in the main course with 'Chicken Teriyaki'. In the desert had fried ice-cream with caramel crust and cointreau sauce. Enjoyed the meal to the fullest but didn't quite like 'Chicken Teriyaki' dish as it was too much toasted with the Japanese sauce.

I liked this place on my first visit. This place has a brewing facility but seems it doesn't operate. A very casual set up. Decent music too. I have tried hookah, appetiser and mocktails, and all were pretty interesting.
The only thing i don't appreciate, this place allows minors too... Small kids with adults.. This should not happen when a restaurant does not have a non-hookah sitting arrangements.

Just loved this new addition in sector 5.This place covers a large space  and has a seating capicity of around 70-80 people.As you open the wooden gate you would be awestruck by the interiors of this cafe .Along with great interiors this cafe has a very calm ambiance.The service they provide is also excellent.Though there was a little delay in serving the dish but the staff was very friendly.And the way they serve the food will force you to fall in love with their dishes.Now coming to the food,We had several items but the best was-
1.Palak aur Anardana tikki
2.Fried icecream with caramel
3.Lebanese platter

Food-4.5/5

So one evening after fighting a horrendous traffic me and a friend reached this place. The entry and the seating arrangement is impressive. The ambience was really good and the usherer had a smile on her face. 

Since it's a micro-brewery we expected to be treated to some tasters before we zeroed in on our drinks. After a twenty mins wait the manager comes to us and informs us that they don't yet have the licence in place for the micro-brewery!!! He further added we could try out the other liquor and food...It's like visiting a hospital only to be told that they don't have any doctors yet, however; we could try our their canteen instead! 

A simple warning notice at the entrance should suffice to inform the patrons in advance. What a shame. My request to the management is to take care of this, though they might not pay heed...

I just loved this new addition in Sector v area.  The wooden door opens up to a spacious lounge area. The well lit bar counter has a peppy feeling to it. The sad part being that the counter is decorated with mock tail bottles instead of alcohol. The wooden work decor adds to the look of the place. As you enter there is this round table with colourful chairs which I heart so much.  Then there is the other area which gives you a cabana type of feeling... Apt for trying sheesha with friends. The dj console and the large speakers are a wow factor. The Bob Marley image on the wall is a high in itself. The microbrewery part looks so dead as of now...  I so wish they start it at the earliest. We tried assorted vegetables fry and kalamari fry along with French fries.  I liked the way both the items were presented.  We were also offered three different types of mock tails... All of them were very refreshing for the thirsty souls.  The tiramisu at the end was an icing on the cake.  The staff is well behaved and had knowledge about each and every item on the menu. Would love to go to this place often. The pricing is reasonable as of now so if you are a foodie and an aficionado of hookah please visit and experience Raize the Bar.

They really need to raise their bar. We ordered a chicken terriyaki, tandoori pomfret, chicken kebab, hyderabadi platter, kolkata biryani. Though everything served was delicious, but the quantity was very less. The parathas were smaller then the size of a poori. We had consulted the waiters if this much was enough for five people. But unfornunately they could not suggest us properly.

After reading such good reviews, was really disappointed with the ambience. There was a dj in the house but still the music was like some ordinary background songs. Nobody dancing. Thought it to be fun place to hangout, but it turned out to be just a place for dinner. Hoping to have a better experience there the next time i visit the place.

The place is excellent to throw parties and to hangout with friends. Spacious and perfctly designed , it gives you a feeling of a proper pub (though they have'nt got the bar licence which is expected to be cleared soon). I was at the place with my friends, food is quite remarkble in taste specially gellati kebabs with kesari dahi amd chilly paneer , though quantity is'nt that food but fairly okay. Do not miss their OREO Choclate Shake ,its a pure delicacy.

"Raize the Bar" is Kolkata's newest offering. The place is spread across a huge space. They have their own brewery which will start operating in the next two months. The interior is beautiful, a lot of thought has gone into it. The place was quite full for a weekday lunch. They are famous for their square pizzas. The pizza was quite filling for the price they charged. Their another best item to order would be their fried ice-cream. Where a lot of big brands fail, these guys excel on this! Waiting for the brewery to start, will come back for more!! :)

I went there yesterday and I have to say that it is a brilliant place. The music was a little too loud for anyone who wants to sit and talk. We had to raise our voice to hear each other but the ambiance is electrifying. 
The food in particular was delectable and the service couldn't have been any more better. This place has been nicely done and was packed. We sat towards the interior which was vacant and had a romantic aura to it. 
Would definitely be visiting again.

Recently opened brew pub surprised me totally with its classy and catchy ambience. 
Interiors is nicely done and management is extremely good. Not all sections are operative yet but I liked their concept overall. 
Loads of items are there on the menu worth ordering. 
Tried Melting Mushroom which I liked to the core. A lil pricey considering the quantity. However,the presentation and method of preparing it compensated the cost. Along with the mushroom was a syrup which went really well with it and a bit of veggies. 
Next we ordered was Asparagus and Cheese Risotto and it was simply heaven. I still can't get over with the taste. Got it customized by asking them to add mushrooms which intensified the taste all the more.
Would like to try more of its dishes as I was really happy with the food. Coming back soon.

Visited a week back with office colleagues on a working Saturday. The place was pretty crowded considering it was a Saturday .  The interiors are awesome ,the music was a bit too loud for my liking ,but a lot of people might like it. Overall ambience was good. Some of the seats do not have a back-support so might be a problem for some like me,who prefer back support in their chairs.

Overall Ambience :4/5

Now coming to food and drinks ,it was a mixed experience. The presentation of all the food and drinks items 
Chicken Teriyaki : Was very good.The chicken was tender and the preparation was yummy
Watermelon and Feta Cheese: Was disappointed terribly with this, It was basically a few balls of watermelon. The cheese was barely present and was very disappointed  with this.
Mocktails : The place is yet to get its alcohol license. The mock-tails that we ordered  were 
Na Real Pani: As the name suggests was just coconut water presented in a container shaped like a coconut.
Lonely Planet: Loved this drink. Would definitely recommend to others

Food and Drinks: 3/5
 
  Would recommend fellow foodies to give it a try

After getting awesome reviews from so many people, I thought, I should visit this place and so, we planned a team lunch together in this place on a rainy Friday. My experience was beyond awesome. Food, ambiance, Service - everything was perfect. Location of this joint is inside Godrej Waterside Complex, walkable distance from  College More. After entering into the place, what I first saw is, numerous mini breweries are standing side by side. Unfortunately they didn't get licence for liquor yet, so for that, we have a wait a bit. Sitting arrangements are on the right side. It was bit dark inside,but enough to see menu cards. 
We were six people and we order 2 plates of non veg platter as starter and  Ami Kolkata, Kungpao Chicken Platter and A Trip to Phuket - one plate each as main course. Portion of each plate is quite good. Enough for 2 people. The best order was desert. We ordered 2 plates of Fried Ice Cream and believe me, it was just awesome. Each and every dish was delicious and the waiters eagerly helped us in selecting menus. Though our orders were not served very quickly, but it was  worthy to wait for those tasty mouth watering dishes. Bill was on around 4000. So price wise, it is bit in higher side, but again, you won't regret in spending money here.
Overall, it was an amazing experience for me as well as, for my colleagues. I would highly recommend this place to those foodies, who what to taste different types of foods. This place is worth a visit.

Date of Visit : 13/06/2016

Location : Located in sector v, saltlake inside the Godrej Waterside complex.

Ambiance : Ambiance is good. As you enter the place you see a big bar. Though it is yet to get the bar licence. On the right is seating arrangement. On left there is a place for private party. Wooden long chairs and tables gives you a different experience. Though the music was very loud but loved the music too.

Service : Service was prompt. They also helped in choosing the best dishes of the menu according to our taste.

Foods Ordered & Description :

Soup---->
Cream of Broccoli - The soup tasted group. Few chunks of broccoli enhanced the taste. It was served with garlic bread.

Starters---->
Melting Mushroom - Heard very good reviews about this. So ordered this on the first go. It came resting on chemical flasks which had tangy and sweet chilli sauce.  It tasted average to me. I have had better mushrooms items than this.
Vegetarian Kebab Platter - The platter contains Paneer Tikka, Bharwan aloo, hara bhara kebab & assorted tandoor vegetables like mushroom & babycorn accomplained with mint chutney, sour cream, papad and onions. Loved the platter. Bharwan aloo was the star. It was yummy.

Main Course---->
Desi Khana 2 - This combo contains dal makhani, malai kofta, chana masala and masala kulcha with papad, achaar and salad. This is good combo to try for those who are wiling to try Indian foods there. I dnt like chana masala that much but other items were good.
Wall of China - This combo contains chilly garlic noodles with stir fried vegetables and paneer sichuan. This combo is a must at this place. Awesome taste and varieties in the combo.
Veg Teriyaki Platter - Burnt Garlic Coriander Fried Rice with Green Asparagus, sesame teriyaki potatoes, babycorn, onion and tofu. This is a deadly combo. Yummicious items. A must try for those want to try something different.

Mocktails---->
Oreo Oatmeal Shake , Lonely Planet & Vir-Gin-Sing - All the 3 drinks tasted awesome and refreshing. Standing out was Vir-Gin-Sing. never had such lovely mocktails ever.

Overall, an amazing experience. It a must try place for the varieties they offer. Presentation is also excellent. You cnt be disappointed coming to this place. Highly recommended.

Seen a lot of reviews about this place on Zomato so decided to night out last Friday. We were in a group. The place is located in Godrej Waterside and can be easily reached. Once inside the ambiance is differently good with nice seating arrangement, albeit not crowded. We were given complimentary mocktails which was provided in really small glasses. Better glass size should have been there. The other ordered mocktails were provided in descent size glasses and were amazing. The hookah was well made, smooth. The starters cigar roll, mushroom were nicely served but the quantity was bit less. However the presentation madeup for the quantity. Coming to the main course items like Spaghetti, Risotto & North Indian - they were nicely prepared and tasted well but were again a tad low on quantity. Soft drinks were not served despite order until we completed our dinner and asked for serving them. Overall a good experience, except the fact that the quantity did not commensurate the price so this place is on the expensive side. They might get better once they get their brewery rolling. Most importantly DJ plays generation old English songs when latest ongoing hits/remixes ought to be played.

This place is totally fantastic. Except for the place hasnt got the license for what they actually are made for. And that is brewed beer. The machines are all made. Except for that they dont serve alchohol inside. But no doubt the food quality is awesome.

Nice posh place at the Godrej water side of sector 5.Easy to locate. A huge sitting area  Specialised in continental food menus.Neglible North Indian cuisines available.
Order- special meat platter,which came with a very delicious look.They claim that its sufficient for 2 people but i personally dint feel so.American Salmon was tasty but the fish itself had come in very small piece.
Value for money is.less.Taxes are as high as 25 percent.
Service- very good They will invite you cordially and the food is served pretty fast.
They also have a large microbrewery ready but are not able to start as they have no liquor license yet.They promised that they will start it soon within a month.
Decor is so-so

Came to meet a friend at sector 5-planned on boozing  found this great looking microbrewery ,was disappointed to know they dint have licence  for liquor yet. 
So we just had our dinner the Pad thai and basil chicken was nice, hukka was good.
I am not a dessert person my buddy told the pannacotta was too good.
not for boozing right now but a great ambiance and decor for partying once the place have licence.
meanwhile its good food at good price place.

Amazing experience at Raize the bar! It is one of the most upcoming and coolest places to be at. From a mind boggling ambience, to the explicitly luxurious and large variety of their global cuisine, to the aptly romantic dim lights,this place is absolutely worth it all.We were taken aback at the very grand gigantic entrance of this supercool bar cum brewery which is all set to blow your minds away. Not to forget the qwerky,personalised interiors and ofcourse the warmth and genuine hospitality of the staff will force you to revisit this place again and again and again! I genuinely recommend this place to everyone who wants to experience nothing but THE best coz I bet you oughtta fall in love with the place which has taken my expectations from other places to a complete next level. No complaints at all! I'm coming back very soon.♡

Loved it! Oh God, how badly I wish the bar to open soon. Visited this joint for a team lunch on a Thursday… and it was a fantastic experience.

Every dish was mouth-watering… with clear winners being Oregano Crusted Chicken, Mixed Meat Platter and Fried Icecream. The ambience of the place also added to the extravaganza.

The only downside (and the reason for deducting 0.5 points) happened when they forgot to give the squid and the bok choy rice along with the Mixed Seafood platter. We had to ask for it in order to be served separately (but by that time, we had already finished the platter).

Hopefully, this place will receive a lot o limelight once the bar opens next month. And once that happens, I'll be one of the firsts to revisit and have a blast.

Raize the bar is a pub located in sector V in Godrej waterside. Place is a micro brewery but they haven't got their license yet. Ambience is good with loud music and LCDs for sports lovers. Though I am not a Hookah fan but they do have Have a great selection to choose from. We ordered garlic bread, pasta, pizza and some non-alcoholic drinks. Garlic bread is good but pasta and pizza are both very ordinary. Service is quick. Portions are quite small and place is quite pricey. Lack of alcohol makes the place less preferred.

A newly opened food joint comes with good food with all new brewing pub concept. We used to get an average food in almost all kind of great pub but believe me the food they served is awesome in taste.
Ambience wise it j's very simple and eye catching but only prob is that they played the music in very high volume but it may be liked by others.
They decorate the place with very simple manner but full of positive vibes.
Now lets come into the main show...the food...yeah taste awesome and the service e time from KOT placing to serve on plate time is also good.
We have ordered Green chilli chicken.. Yes taste very good as well as presentation.. Chicken are well cooked but again they didn't lose the juicy flavour inside...ordered bar-b-q chicken wings with perfect combination of bar-b-q sauce ans taste yumyyyyyyyyyy...I would also like the non veg platter... Overall a great ambience with with great experience... Little bit costly in side but no matter if you are 
getting a good food with quality service and awesone ambience...I hope management has already started more promo as the location is not in the middle of sec v...great effort will like to visit soon..

Located at Godrej waterside building.

 This new pub style themed place is a class-apart .

 The decor is pretty simple yet touching.  

 The food has really raised the bar with its variety and taste. 

You could start up with the melting mushrooms or the oregano chicken tikka or the Morrocan cigar roll, I must say a lot of emphasis has been made on the presentation and quality of food.

The Lobster thermidor is simply out of the world.

Desserts and drinks(though only non-alcoholic, as they haven’t got the license yet) are worth the try. Molten Chocolate Cake an overall favourite. 

 The staff is courteous, well trained and polite, will guide you through the menu well. 

 Pros - Location, ambience, Food Quality and Quantity, Courteous staff, Quick service. 

 Cons – On weekends reservation must otherwise you may not get a seat

A great place in the making! Sadly they are unable to start the brewery as they don't have the liquor license yet. Hookah lovers can try this place as well. I can review regarding the food only. It was quite promising with good quantity and palatable as well.The starters barbeque chicken,lime soda were up to the mark. The meal was quite sumptuous with the kukkad sukkad as well.The dal makhani and chicken dish were exquisite.I wish to visit this place soon. I am quite confident that they will snatch a rating of 5 from me next time when they are at full bloom with the microbrewery open.
@raizethebar Start it soon folks!

This newly opened and one of the coolest pub cum brewing station at sector 5 , impressed us on its first look itself.. occupying a gigantic space on the first floor of godrej waterside building with masculine wooden finishing and a glass pane giving a view outside , peppy numbers and shisha ( for now they donot have the liquor license) along with brilliantly cooked food.
I ordered for four dishes and genuinely recommend them all..
THE MELTING MUSHROOMS is an usp starter of this place coming with cheesy mushrooms on top of a small conical beaker with a red tangy dip.. which makes an outburst of flavours when taken together. Just that for 6 small single bite sized mushroom priced at 225++ is tad too high.
the OREGANO CRUSTED CHICKEN TIKKA was so juicy and moist tasted similar to malai kebabs ,could find no oregano gel flavour though , however it tasted amazing with the green chutney.
CHICKEN SALTEMBOCCA had three roundish breaded chicken stuffed with cheese and veggies probably , on an bed of potato mash , sided by satueed vegetables and topped with cream sauce.. good for people who avoid spices and oily food.
And the lastly the MEATY PIZZA was the showstopper of all.. perfectly baked thin crust rectangular pizza topped with minced meat, chicken sausages and great amount mozarella couldnot stop us gulping those 8 pieces within minutes. I am really satisfied with the staff service and the food as described was ridiculously overwhelming .
Hope to sit with beer mugs soon!

Amidst the hustle bustle of the IT City, this new microbrewery attracted my eyes quite a few times as it near my office and has a surprisingly refreshing ambience.

Though it was disappointing to know that they don’t have alcohol license yet, we were in a group of 6 and were sad about it, but hat’s off to the great service, mock-tails and superb food with courteous management team we felt as if at home .There was live screening of IPL match going on and the music was great. Late evening after change of light the place became mesmerizing.

We really enjoyed the gig and waiting eagerly to go there next week again. A big thumps up!! For Raize The Bar

The exterior looks so fab that you would love to have food out here. The taste and the price of food items goes hand in hand. The ambience too is excellent. We had ordred the kolkata chello kabab - that although doesn't taste as good as the one at Peter Cat but the preparation is quite good. The ambience was good and the behaviour of the staff was amiable. The only reason of me giving it 4 points is that the size of its tables - it is not at par to the normal table size. If you have kept your plate out there and a dish comes there's hardly any place to keep the same.

Was meaning to try out this place for a long time. Went there last night. Impressive Décor. I was really excited by the wide array in the menu. The RTB pizza is a must have and so is the Cheese Garlic Bread. The adventurous foodies can try the Khao Suey. Hookah too was pretty good. The Cold Coffee however was a little too sweet for the liking.

The best part was that the staff was extremely cooperative and friendly. They even made a shout out to my friend whose birthday we were celebrating. All in all a pretty good experience.

After an awful expereience, I drove to Raize the bar on another Sunday. Luckily they did not disappoint me this time. Mr.Suman the chef there took care of us making it a good experience. We had a melting mushrooms which was good, served very well and tasted tum too. The green chilly chicken was too good, the chicken was soft, the coating was perfect and tasted too good. The hookah we called for was decent too, not one of the best I've had though. The service was quick. The servers kept an eye on all tables always which was a pretty good thing :) best of luck Raize the bar :)

Location is nice 
The first thing you see when you reach there is the big glow sign boards and huge staircase and glimpse of the micro-brewery !
It's very Royal and sophisticated entry set up.
Once you're inside the lounge, the ambience is very very good !
Lot of space to walk around and looks comfortable and cozy.
Theme is nice, music, lighting and seating all are good, lot of segregated areas too.
There's also a no smoke/Sheesha cozy lounge comprising of comfortable dining space.
Music is really good, no Bollywood numbers as of now :(
Staff is courteous and service is prompt.
Sheesha is decent.
FOOD !! Now this is highlight !
Food is brilliant !
More than that the presentation is just very nice !
Lebanese, Italian, Chinese, Indian all four are equally good !
And mocktails are nice.

Not serving Alchohol as of now, soon they claim to start.

Highly recommended !

Located in sector - v, inside the newly build Godrej waterside complex. Extravagant place, amazing decor, excellent service. Parking is a problem. It's still a restaurant only as the liquor license had not been obtained yet. Food was very innovative, and the presentation was very creative. Quantity for starters were less. Quality of the food was hygiene. Divided in three sections, there is also a private party section. We had ordered Melting Mushrooms, Morroccan cigar roll, Makai malai soya ki champ in starters. And calm down in mocktail.

Quantity of the food can be improved.. Regards Indian food lovers they might be disappointed with the Indian platter as thou the taste fine but it's not even sufficient for a single person n def not worth the amt they charging for it.. Rest def one can try this place as it's a happening addition to the city..

A really extravagant place near Collage More. As soon as you enter you'll find the place quite welcoming. 
We ordered the Veg Manchow and Mushroom Cappuccino. Both were really quite good. The mushroom soup was really creamy. 
We then ordered Veg kebab platter, pizza rtb and another pizza. The Pizzas were great. Perfect thin crust pizza with very nice amount of cheese with pesto and goat cheese. I found it amazing.
We also ordered Risotto and nachos. Both were quite good. 
Overall everything we ordered was quite good. And I found the place really nice. Though I would suggest they should have a non smoking area.
It is a little on the pricey side. Though their pizza is worth it.

Ok. So finally made it to this place..to start with they dont have parking in the building (atleast thats what the building security told me)
So parked my car in the no parking zone :)

Place looks great...shud do gr8 once the liquor licence comes in.

Swanky items in the menu. loads of choices..but then how much can one eat ? ;)

Music was loud..in the afternoon (especially for the 2 occupied tables) had to request management to lower the volume,which they did ,promptly :)
Ordered the "cilantro  mix bowl"..it was refreshingly nice and ofcourse healthy :)
Overall good place..
Good service
Lovely ambience
Great location

Will do well..:)

I'm sure you must have noticed the pleasant changes and developments in terms of food and experience in our city. Food trucks, kiosks, gastronomical pubs, innovative desserts and more. What was missing was a microbrewery, brewing up local beer crafted fresh!

LOCATION & AMBIANCE-
Located in sec v inside the newly build Godrej Waterside complex, Raize the bar is a complete eye pleasing place.
Divided between four sections namely the seating area overlooking the brew machines, DJ console area and a dining section and a sprawling bar, this place feels complete.
Though here is the disappointment part. They are still figuring out the liquor license bit, but assured me it will be done in the first week of june.
The ambiance is amazing, love the cartboxes on the ceiling, the barrels that work as tables, the Bob Marley poster, the pop of colors with metal chairs and stools.

FOOD-
We went for appetizers, mocktails and main course. Here goes my experience!
• Basket of assorted fries- it came with French fries, onion rings, veg nuggets and potato wedges with a delicious garlicky dip. The fries were seasoned well and had the perfect crunch and flavour.
• Lebanese Platter which was presented well and was absolutely a wonderful dish to order #recommeded. Standouts were the cheese raraq which was gooey and stringy, the saffron dip which was killer ans the muhmurra which was tangy and garlicy.
• Melting Mushrooms were one of their recommendations and I am glad I ordered them. One of the best mushrooms I have had in a long time! They came resting on chemical flasks which housed their house made tangy and sweet chilli sauce. An absolute delight in the mouth, this one #recommended
• Na Real which came in a dried coconut. It had flavoura of coconut, coriander and jeera. Tasted amazing #recommended
• Virgin Madras which had a madras twist with curry Patra to the usual tropical flavour
• Bannofee which was a blend of toffee and banana flavour. It was just about okay
• For main course we tried their Biriyani which was prepared in dum style. It was served with curd and tasted very good.

SERVICE-
Was indeed very good and I was impressed with their attention to detail.

PRICING-
Considering the wonderful experience in terms of ambiance, food and service, the prices are justified and we paid a total of 1750 for our afternoon .

My best wishes to the entire team and I am definitely visiting again once the booze is on!
Cheers!

It's still a restaurant only as the liquor license hasn't been obtained, although the ambience is spot on of a typical brew pub
The garlic Chilli chicken appetizer was as juicy as it gets. The mains however was a mixed reaction. We ordered chicken saltembocca, grilled bhetki and lobster Thermidor. While the chicken had nothing more to wish for, the bhetki was ok ish and Thermidor was way too salty. .overall the food is better than most pubs but leaves a lot of room for desire as a restaurant

Raize the bar has raised the standard of the sector 5 itself! I bet, the moment you enter this place, it will get a smile on your face. Amazing decor. And to be mentioned specially, waiters are not dumb. They get things at once. Good food. We had ordered for a veg platter. It was sufficient for two people. Combos are pocket friendly. Sisha is nice. And and and, they ll get there alchohol license shortly,so the place has its own breweryy tooo!!! In short the place is must a visit.

Raize the bar- Kolkata’s new jewel- A microbrewery yet to brew it's beer

Food- A wonderful gastronomic experience which satisfies all the senses... Raize the bar has kept its menu very simple and has stuck to the original recipies,even the dishes in which they have innovated the flavours are quiet strong and there is no clash of the same,  and a unique dining experience.

Service-The service is great and the ambience suffices.

Will visit soon to try out the rest of the menu.waiting for the brewed beer eagerly.

Amazing and cool place
to hang out. Out of all the dishes ordered by us, (3 occasions
already) all were made differently and a must try. I especially would recommend
the Rangoon noodles for all Thai food lovers and the Melting mushrooms
which amazingly also impressed the non-mushroom eaters too....The staff was
courteous and there was no issues with service as such. Hookah was good too.

With the brewery on, I’m
sure this place is alwazzz gonna stay packed.

Unlike its name and the visible brewery, the place has still not acquired it's license so no alcohol is available which is very disappointing and shocking. I went there with a friend and when asked for a table for two the female attendant initially took us to a seat that was squeezed between 2 with large loud groups. We asked them for an alternative to which she reluctantly took us to a seat for 5 and even said she'll ask us to sit at the bar stools once the crowd starts coming. This is honestly very bad service specially considering there were hardly any people then. Our displeasure was fairly evident since thereafter 2 much more amicable attendants attended to us.
We ordered as below:
Bull Berry-this could easily pass as strawberry shake
Foamed Green Apple Iced Team-the foam was unavailable
Moroccan Cigar Rolls- Highly recommended
Vegetable Platter-Pretty average

The Moroccan Cigar Rolls were amazing and it along with the male attendants are the sole factors behind the 3.5 rating. Otherwise this place had disappointed us abit
Hope you guys take note and grow better

Saw a lot of buzz about this place. Unfortunately for us the bar had not started yet. They will get the liquor license next month. So the huge brewed beer tanks stare at you from the glass door.
Located at College More Waterside building. A big bar with with a huge offering on the menu, food wise. Did not try any mocktails so won't be able to comment on them. 
The plating is done beautifully and pricing is good. 
We ordered a paan flavoured hookah which gave a bitter aftertaste plus I am not a hookah lover. 
First came the calamari Fritto. It was served with a kafir lime sauce and French fries on the side. The calamaris were fried with a poppy seed covering. The covering lacked seasoning but it went well with the dip. 
The oregano crusted chicken kebab was very soft and juicy. Definitely recommended but it had no oregano flavour whatsoever. It was more of reshmi kebab. The meaty pizza was rectangular in shape with cheese loaded on top. But the chicken and meat was very less. It looked as if it was sprinkled on top or given just for the sake of it. Naming a dish meaty pizza and giving so less doesn't justify it. The taste was good.

Raize the bar has definitely raised the party standards of kolkata....i was visiting Kolkata after 8 months and RTB was a pleasant surprise...the gastronomical pleasure of Melting Mushrooms, Na Real and the Chinese box were all too good for my taste buds...even the indian platters are must try...what i was truly impressed was the awesome decor...the place is divided in 3 sections and all 3 have a different feel which surprisingly gel well with each other....The decent mix of EDM,rock and bollywood pumps you up for a great evening....overall its a place to visit not just once....great experience...all this when their USP is not even operational...eagerly waiting for the brewery to get my spirits higher...

A grin took over my face the moment we stepped in..Spellbinding, hypnotic and mesmerised!! The ambiance is extremely mellow.. We settled in, and prepared ourselves for some exquisite gastronomical venture.. We ordered melty mushroom with chef's special tangy sauce- the presentation was resplendent .. The button mushrooms stuffed with cheese and when dipped in that sweet tangy spicy sauce it is indeed a beautiful experience.. 
We were recommended oreo oatmeat shake- and it is one of the best oreo shakes i ever had.. The texture was so right, not too sweet and heavy.. But light with that beautiful hint of oreo.. 
Then we had AMI KOLKATA- that is chelo kebab.. Well honestly we were not disappointed, it is definitely better than peter cat's.. The quantity was sumptuous!! Only one recommendation maybe they can ask before serving the sunny side up, because I personally prefer my eggs well done!! 
Rtb pizza- the pizza base was pesto sauce.. I am an ardent lover of thin crust pizza!! And i did enjoy binging.. 
The experience wouldn't have been so great without the staff.. Extremely affable..😊
Overall, it was a repleting experience visiting the place.. Raize the bar has undoubtedly raised the gourmet experience of foodies residing in city of joy..

Superb food. Each and every item is lip smacking. The indian platter named kukkar sukkar is amazing...the amount of rice is extremely less bt the dal makhani is best in town, and chicken tikka masala is too good. Only the quantity of rice they serve is very very less compared to other dishes. I have tried all items and all taste equally good. The chelo kabab, Indonesian gem is too good. The Chinese platter with chili chicken a d rice is awesome. Only the biriyani I disliked...it has dalda and the rice becomes sticky before completing. Anyhow the 95% dishes are superb. The taste is best in this sector v area..the interior and decorations are superb..the staffs are polite and well behaved. A must visit and regular visit for the sector v techies..
Update: Trip to phuket is a wonderful item with flat noodle and chicken. Very tasty. The Cilantro rice is an awesome preparation. The main disappointment was that Lately I had the kukkad sukkad..the quantity of rice they increased sufficiently, but the taste was horrible. In fact the chicken was smelling bad and the dal makhani was Blant with no taste. I am really disappointed as last time it was 5/5 and this time 1/5. I hope they maintain the previous quality and taste as it was. The fresh lime soda is too bad. I am reducing 0.5 rating for the not so good food I had in the last visit.

Raize the bar has a class of its own. Beautiful interiors, lovely food and courteous staffs. 
This place has its own brewery which will be operational in a couple of weeks, and then it's gonna surely create a buzz of its own. 
Looking forward for the brewery to be operational soon so that we Calcuttans get some taste of variety of beer!

Visited on 13th May!

This place was bookmarked since a long time, for two reasons, namely, the ambience and the fact that, it is amongst the few Microbreweries in Kolkata. (although they aren't serving liquor right now)

Location : In sector 5. In the lane next to The Institute of Engineering and Management. Right opposite to the PWC building. The name of the place is distinctly visible as you pass by, which gives you a feeling that it's a big, very expensive place!

Interiors and Service : Mind blowing wooden interiors. Very airy and spacious, the place. Plus one!
The staff is attentive and cordial, but slow.

Food and Hookah : I had ordered for Melting Mushrooms. They were amazingly tasty. It is a must try.
Hookah was well made.

Pocket pinch : It is decently charged. Neither too much nor too less.

The only wait is for the beer brewing to start. This place has the potential of becoming the next big thing in the Salt Lake area.
Visit this place and let your bars be raised! Cheers.

Mushrooms. The one strong reason to visit Raize The Bar, pre-liquor licence, is definitely for its Chinese mushroom preparation in the black pepper sauce and for the mushroom risotto. The guys have done a great job hiring good chefs for the food and the shisha is beyond par. Great work with the ambiance, but those quotes on the walls in the private area - well, whenever you undergo refurbishment, please do let me know for replacements of those images. Quick service, friendly staff, good food and shisha - well, what else does anybody want! Personally, if you stick to two cuisines at the most and experiment within those two, instead of stuffing in what is popular, I guess it'll be much better branding for you guys. Anyhow, great work. And get the liquor license fast!!!

A classic bar with such huge space in that official hub area of Sector V is a very surprising but amazing fact. The décor took my heart away. I have seen very rare places in Kolkata with such décor. The food was nice but what was better was the simplicity of the waiters working there. We ordered a pizza. It took time more than expected time. The waiter came to us and informed us that the chef did some mistake with the order and we can either wait for the new pizza or we can cancel the order. KUDOS to this attitude! I am visiting this place again :)

Nice place with good ambience of a pub . .  
Food was good.

only thing which struck me was the coal change charges "Rs 50 + taxes", Rs 300 + taxes is a pretty dearer charge for hookah and above that a single coal change coming at such a cost is a bit too much. I think they can check on that part. :-)

looking forward to the brewery.

Its a pretty huge cafe with nice and unique ambiance . Menu items were pretty innovative and presentation of there food too is awesome.
Ordered Hazelnut Latte and somehow I was not impressed by its look but the taste was good. Apart from this ordered Lebanese Platter which was too good. Good place to hangout with your friends or on Date.

When you walk into raize the bar it's a like an old countryside pub which definitely has the old world charm.
The microbrewery actually grabs your attention and will be serving six different beers. (Surely a first for the city)
Chicken tikka kabab is something you shouldn't miss here and when a punjabi foodie says that you got to believe it.
A fitting name! :)
This place has literally raised all standards.

Raize the bar- it lives up to its name.
An amazing place to hang out. The decor has been well thought of. From ceiling to the bar, from smoking room to the beer barrel for the bill, all goes well with the theme. 
We ordered melting mushrooms and chilli paneer tangra style, loved the mushrooms and the presentation. 
Good food, good service. Would love to go again.

If you are looking for a brewpub in Salt Lake or rather Kolkata, this is the place to be! The first thing that strikes you as soon as you enter the place is the ambience. The plush wooden interiors with dim dangling lights make the experience unique and you won't feel like leaving the place at all. 

Coming to the food, we started with Melting Mushrooms and Green Chilli Chicken. The mushrooms were served in classy test-tubes and tasted well. The chilli chicken was juicy and I would recommend everyone to try this dish. For main-course, we tried their Indian dishes and all of them had been cooked to perfection. We ended our perfect meal with their rum flavoured melting chocolate which according to me is a must-have. The staff was courteous and helped us in placing the order, recommending their best dishes. All in all, we had a great time all thanks to Raise the Bar!

A very nice concept in Kolkata. Probably one of a kind. I really enjoyed the food here. The Mushrooms were really fresh and almost melted in mouth. Food served was as hot as it should be. Presentation of all items that we ordered was innovative and interesting. Ami Kolkata Chelo kababs were quite a treat. The Chicken in main course was soft, tender and very well cooked.

I am just waiting for those big steel canisters to start their magic...bar license awaiting.

We went to this new restaurant on 30th March, the day it was opened to public and as a matter of fact we were, the very first customers of the restaurant!
The shiny metal beer brewing tanks attracted my attention for a while and I was really excited to get a microbrewery in Sector V. While having a food tour in Bangalore last year, I visited a microbrewery called Big Brewski. The place was so so awesome that I started missing it after I returned to Calcutta.
Raize the Bar is the third (or fourth?) microbrewery in Calcutta, after Beer Republic and Country Roads. While the first two had managed to get their liquor license already, Raize the Bar couldn't. So, when we visited this place, it was only a restaurant, not a microbrewery in true sense.
Being the first customer had its own advantages! Executive Chef Suman offered us free cocktails and also free desserts (Sahi Tukda).
Food: We ordered many dishes ranging from Indian to Chinese and from Conti to Desi. Some of the dishes were really outstanding and some pretty average.
For example, Oregano stuffed chicken tikka which was soft, juicy and very tasty. But the similar chicken kabab in the Chelo Kabab platter was hard, dry and anything but tasty.
On the Chinese side, the green chilly chicken was so awesome that we kept on ordering it one after another, but the Kung Pao chicken in the Chinese platter was no better than any street-side cheap Chinese restaurant.
Their plating and food presentation were quite unique - most of the starters served reminded us of the Chemistry lab. Like the melting mushrooms were served on top of small glass flasks with the the sauce inside. It was nice indeed, more from the visual perspective than taste.
The cocktail was quite refreshing in the summer and the Sahi Tukda was just ok.

Service: All staffs were very cordial and helping but they clearly lacked the professional experience. Then had no clear idea of what's there in the menu, nor they could explain the differences between two similar dishes. Chef Suman had to jump in to save their day. Also, the staffs, who were probably more in number than us, messed up the orders. We were served (and charged for) a dish that we didn't order at all!

Ambiance: Nice and cozy. Good for spending the Friday evening with friends. They have a separate room which you can reserve for private parties for 30-40 people. The retro style light bulbs, the wooden floor and the view of the beer tanks created the mood. But the music they played were at least a decade old. I would recommend an immediate update of their music collection.

Price: Most of the dishes were expensive considering the amount of food served and the category of the restaurant. We had a group of 10 and the total bill was around 6,000. But keep in mind the free cocktail and desserts. If we had to buy those then the bill would have crossed 10k. And the amount of food was not too much or unlimited. So 1k+ per person (excluding any alcoholic beverages) for moderate amount of food in a non-fine-dining restaurant in Sector V was definitely on the costlier side.

Final words: Visit the restaurant for the ambiance, food presentation and some specific dishes. My advice would be, wait until they get their liquor license. Only then you will be able to enjoy the real microbrewery experience, without which Raize the Bar is just another average but expensive restaurant.

Food taste - 3.5/5
Service - 3/5
Price/Value for Money - 3/5
Ambiance and Décor - 4/5

Spent a match evening there. Enjoyed the place far more than the match to be honest. Their bar is not serving alcohol yet but their other concoctions do not fail you. 

Loved their mushrooms and the virgin mojito. The view from one end of the place overlooks a long stretch of road in the IT hub of our city and can actually make you start thinking about the City of Joy. 

There's a graffiti wall on the other end and the beer comics are rather witty. 

Yummy food, brilliant pub ambiance and commendable service !

If you're looking for places where you can relieve stress, have fun, and chill with friends, look no further! Newly opened Raize the Bar – Kolkata's premier micro-brewery is an unassuming hidden gem in Godrej Waterside, Sector 5, Salt Lake. With an enthralling bar which soothes the eye as you enter, the place is set to resonate an Irish pub-like feel. While the brewers are aligned on one side, a warm seating arrangement adorns the other end of the place – with the bar connecting them. The view from near the brewers can make you pensive about the City of Joy and then there are the whimsy wall posters which are sure to make you chuckle as you read on the quirks about all things alcohol.

Step into Raize the Bar and you will see how much emphasis they place on aesthetics. In an ambience reminiscent of the rustic charm of dining in the extreme comfort, it's everything you need after a long week, with its rough-hewn trestle tables and wooden stools, Raize the Bar brings you a molecular gastronomical menu of delicacies cooked by veteran chef Suman Chakraborty.

The menu is a carefully crafted selection of dishes which are best accompanied with beer and cocktails. Their twists and innovative plating of age-old finger food is sure to furnish every foodie's Instagram account and the hospitality is warm, to say the least. While it’s known as a good chill out spot, it is the pure decadence of the dinner menu that makes it perfect for a "Treat Yourself" night. Gather few friends, and expect to get your hands greasy. Be wise and order their amazing dishes to share.

I got invited for an intensive food tasting session which was also a part of ThinkQuisitive campaign. The menu was very selective and they are delicate pick of Executive Chef Suman Chakraborty. In appetizer they dole out Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup and as thirst quenchers they serve Na Real and Virgin Madras mocktails. Starters were; Melting Mushrooms, Chingri Chop, Green Chilly Chicken and Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka. Main course were also amazing, Pizza RTB, Spaghetti Aglioe Olio e Pepperoncino, Strawberry and Mint Risotto and Crisp skin Atlantic salmon. For sweet finale there was Assorted Dessert Platter.

We began with Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup, it was exciting and startling in both texture and flavour combination. It had just the right amount of spice and savour; rich & flavourful crab meat soup with a unique blend of aromatic herbs and cubes of mushroom, you might find yourself gulping it all up before you even realise. Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup was an excellent appetiser of thinly-sliced crab meat, with flavours amplified by mushroom and special herbs.

This place flows with creative juices, both literally and figuratively, as their seasoned mixologists stand ever-ready to cater to every aspect of your mocktail / cocktail needs by customising your drink. In a completely interactive environment, drinks are personalised and crafted according to your mood and current preferences. As these mixologists are so attentive, the whole process leaves you feeling like royalty.

Tired? Try the Na Real mocktail, it’s a simple fresh coconut water mocktail mixed with a shot of shahi jeera and coriander. It's believed to keep you energised for much longer than regular coconut water. The Na Real here scores full marks in flavour and wasn’t overly sweet.

Virgin Madras - a combination of fruit punch with a touch of south India. It will make your thirsty heart thrilled with every sip. Unquestionably try their Virgin Madras for a unique and refreshing thirst-quencher!

A meal here demands that you order the unbelievably fluffy Melting Mushrooms, with chef’s special tangy sauce as your choice of dipping. The crunch of roasted cheesy mushrooms brings this dish to textural perfection, leaving you on a high. For starters, definitely order the Melting Mushrooms with tangy dip — infused with a generous amount of cheese, mushroom lovers will love tucking into this!

The Asparagus, Tofu and Shitake Spring Rolls — long sticks of crispy fried spring rolls cut in half, shaped like nail protectors — was unique (and Instagrammable) but a tad too gimmicky.Nice surprise and it was unbelievably funny. After the first bite, the whole thing just vanished in my mouth.

Be sure to order the Chingri Chop! These bite-sized soft minced shrimp with spices were fried to a perfect crisp — you won't be able to stop popping them into your mouth! Bring a date and start the night by sharing the Chingri Chop with the creamy dips. It was really just endless, so soft yet crunchy and even better being warm.

The Green Chilly Chicken was excellent as well: cooked flawlessly, sliced chicken tossed in coriander & lemon grass and served hot. It was spicy to the nth degree and perfectly toothsome, chicken pieces were juicy and tender. If you love tongue twisting taste, don't miss their Green Chilly Chicken — it's so darn satisfying.

The Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka was a true flavour bomb, a gourmet specialty in which western flavor of oregano gels with the succulent Indian marinade.The Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka was a very well executed piece of charcoal-grilled tikka – charred to perfection, wonderfully tender and packs a punch of flavour along with the accompanying pudina curd dips.

I always search for crusts that seemingly envelope the toppings, the pizzas here were all about that thick, airy, chewy crust. Yet somehow, its center was thin and topped with fresh, high quality ingredients and if you like unique toppings, you're at the right place. Go with a hearty appetite because you won't want to miss the Pizza RTB, umami-rich goat cheese and herby base, garlic chips and pesto, with sun-dried tomato to cut through the richness — perfect for vegetarians. The crust here was moderately thin, charred in all the right spots, and chewier than you'd expect — but not in a bad way.

The Spaghetti was just fantastic — seemingly pastoral, yet elegant in execution. Go for the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio E Pepperoncino, an exceptionally done prawn spaghetti with a light tomato, garlic, olive oil, chili flakes, rocket leaves and seafood stock base that imparts a ton of flavour without being heavy. The Spaghetti Aglio was another must-order you should share, prawn spaghetti packed with prawn that will bring you right to the ocean. The Spaghetti here will leave you begging for more.

Dig through the strawberry to find a bed of Strawberry and Mint Risotto, creamy with cheese and peppered with sweet and sour pieces of strawberry and fresh mint leaves. Strawberry and Mint Risotto - combines the exotic flavour of fresh mint leaves with the familiar texture and sweetness of strawberry, could easily draw crowds of Risotto lovers. It was as comforting as it is pretty, but as it tends to get a bit rich, you might want to share this with a friend.

Now, dig in to the final main course — Crisp Skin Atlantic Salmon served with orange panache. Indulgent, rich, and slightly creamy from the uni, the flavours of the Atlantic Ocean will explode in your mouth. The crisp skin Atlantic salmon was definitely not to be missed– think perfectly cooked fish filet with olive oil and topped salt flakes, served with potatoes and salad leaves. If you feel like something light for lunch, try out their crisp skin Atlantic salmon, a gorgeous version of a slow cooked salmon that makes you feel like a queen/king.

Leave stomach space for their Legendary Assorted Dessert Platter, which was worth every calorie. First, try the Kahlua Flavoured Mascarpone Cheese Cake— the unconventional pairing works because of the natural sweetness of the Mascarpone Cheese. The Citrus Panna Cotta with Mixed Berry Coulis, served with freshly squeezed lemon juice and raspberry-orange sauce, makes an excellent dessert, especially when paired with a glass of the Na Real. The coconut water cuts through the mix berry's acidity while adding a hint of natural sweetness. For sweet finale, go for the Captain Morgan Rum flavoured Melting Chocolate; prepared tableside, the sweet, buttery, citrusy and slightly boozy treat was guaranteed to tickle your taste buds!

The food speaks for itself, and it’s no surprise with acclaimed celebrity Chef Suman Chakraborty heading the culinary team.

There’s no better place to bring your favourite client or that special someone who loves delicious food. While the dishes may look it, they are actually rather placid on the spice, which means you don’t have to rule out this place even if you’re dining with little kids or the elderly — just as long as they can stomach some heat. This is the kinda place for those who want to have fun with their food, certainly not for biryani lovers! Come for a fun date or a night out with picky friends.

An amazing place to visit with friends... The ambience is kick-ass, location is convenient and above all they have a huge variety of mocktails which breaks the boundaries of the stereotypical lounge. Must mention the kind of music played, it just sets the mood... Also the add on benefit is the live streaming of cricket matches on big screen.

I am quite a regular at this place especially lunch as its near my office.
Food (Veg)- Food is good to taste and presented well too. Sushis also i tried here but they are not nice at all. I like the chinese and indian spread here. They are good in taste.
Hookah- Hookah is good. 
Ambience - ambience is good here. But once i went on a Wednesday evening. It was a sufi night and i must say i swore i will never visit this place on a wednesday evening. The live music was really really bad. 
Service- Service is bad. Staff are courteous but the service is bad. Everytime we go we have faces this issue - we were served first the main course then the starter even after specifying them the order. And then later they give both of them together even if there are just two people to eat. The staff i feel needs to be trained well. The manager however was nice and courteous and she took care of the complain and did it right later.

Wow.
Checking in now: Sunday night. January 2018
They charge 500/- bucks for a peg of whiskey but don't provide nibbles/small bite snacks.
Hookah for ₹400/₹500/₹600 !?!?!
What the fraak?
Although I love the vibe and music of this joint, the prices are not justified for some things that they are currently charging?
2nd edit for today: they serve drinks but don't bother asking for add-ons like soda/water etc. 
3rd edit: I asked for chilli sauce/mustard sauce but instead got a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup?? 
4th edit : they don't serve drinking water until you ask them to... !!??

Raize The Bar was a choosen place for my Birthday celebration back in September 2016.It was a newly open restro-bar & lounge with its own brew.The ambience is good.Because we were a big group we got a corner which was sperated from the crowd.So it   helped us maintaining our privacy.
The service was good and the staff were pro-active. The food was equally good.We ordered quiet a few veg & non-veg delicacies from their menu and the food was liked by all.What i liked was they serve a platter which is perfect meal balanced well both in quantity and quality.
Overall it was a good experience & I can surely recommend this place to others :)

There was a offer which was running recently,499 + taxes for lunch buffet.The most inviting offer was unlimited craft beer.Everything is almost good about this place.I have been here previously also.Specially the food quality and presentation.But this time what I saw have left me in doubt.The Glass in the high beer was served had lipstick mark in it. When I asked to changed they smiled,I didn’t know how to react to this type of service.

Raize The Bar occupies a sprawling 5000 sq. feet area on the ground floor of the Godrej Waterside IT Park, Sector 5, Salt Lake. The interiors have a plush feeling to them which adds to the ambience of the place. The staff are very efficient and prompt in their service. The presentation of the dishes is also very nicely done. But there are 3 downsides of this place which cannot be ignored. The music is a bit too loud. The dance floor is not very spacious. Lastly but not the least, the washroom is a tad bit too small when compared to the area of the whole place. Overall a good experience.

Spread over a very huge area...this brewhouse pub runs that extra mile on the decor and the way it looks from outside.Once you step inside it gives a very plush and ambient feeling which kindq blows you out..very nicely made sitting arrangements amd the bar is perfectly built juat beside the dance floor,everything is very well planned inside.The wooden finish furnitures gives it a very subtle touch of modernity as well makes it look organic.Coming to the food the food was pretty good too the chicken platter tasted really nice and also the fish tasted heavenly.The sheesha was well made as well.A very unique pub in the city cant wait to go back again

Finally a brewery in this locality with a refined ambiance is here. Raize The Bar has everything to its advantage now.The food is mouth-watering, the beer is perfectly prepared and the music sets the mood just right. If you are looking for places to carouse with your gang on a Friday night or after a tired at work, this place should definitely be on your bucket list! Although they are short-staffed which affects the service , overall the experience is a good one.

Pocket pinch: 1100 for 2

This is a very well decorated pub. We went there for a corporate dinner party, a separate area was allocated for us. 
For starters, we had Chicken Tikka Kebab and Pan fried chilli fish. Both were equally good and goes well along with drinks. 

Had Jeera Pulao, Fish Labrador, Chicken Kasha in main course, Ice cream with brownie in dessert. All the foods were good in taste and served hot. 

Well behaved staff, smoking area and a small dancing area is available.

Do try the pan fry fish. 
They produce draught beer of which the Belgium beer is the best one.

If someone is looking for a place to eat delicious food with a glass of beer, Raize The Bar is the perfect place to hop in. 

Ordered:-
•Chicken Teriyaki 
•Grilled Chicken Breast with BBQ sauce
•Ami Kolkata (Chelo Kabab)
•Belgian Moon (sweet and tangy)


Teriyaki chicken was the best of all. 
About the Belgian Moon, if someone is looking for a taste of sweetness in beer, so this is the best one! 

Loved all the food 😍
A must visit for all big foodies out here, really happy with the food and drink.

We visited this place during lunch time and we noticed that lunch buffet was going on,so we immediately opted for that(*wink face*). The buffet service was excellent from food to salad everything was just on point. As for the drinks the beer was too good(since they produce there own) and virgin mojito is best around the town. The place is really beautiful and provides ample of space for their customer. Really looking forward to visit this place soon!!!
P.S: one thing I didn't get was why they charged us extra 8% for service tax after charging 5% GST! Other than this everything was quite good

I went on a Thursday night with a colleague of mine. If you are a fan of crafted beer then this is the place for you. It's a microbrewery with 4 varieties of their craft beer. We had a taster and selected Belgian and German varieties. The Belgian one was stronger. Taste was good. In Food we had ordered green chili chicken,  tengra style chili chicken, a dish which comprised of mushroom which absolutely tasted amazing, Chicken lassagna which was also very good. The music is very very loud which is a great place for all hard music lovers. The staff was attentive and courteous. 
Overall an amazing experience. I would definitely like to visit again.

To day I visited with my family to take buffet lunch the place was overcrowded but we get the table the chairs were uncomfortable once we decided to leave the place but it was 2 P.M.and we were hungry so having no option we started buffet lunch surprisingly some of the containers were empty and others have last small quantity food which was either cold or not fit for consumption. I draw the attention of waiters who were standing but of no use we have taken soup which was cold and small quantity of certain food and completed our lunch any way.The food was cold and tasteless.I advice one should refrain himself going such type of place.We waste our money.interestingly without any service they add 8%service charges which I refused to pay.

It's located at the ground floor of my office building. Been there couple of times but the best experience was when I visited there for my boss's birthday bash. The food quantity was less but the taste makes up to it. And the cocktails are equally chilled and lip smacking! I had a pitcher of beer which was enough for at least 3 people!! The staff are courteous and made the celebration more enjoyable by suggesting different good items which are too delicious. It's a little expensive but the music by dj and dance floor lightings are superb! We danced too much and were totally exhausted at the end... enjoyed a lot.

I went there this Friday after office with friends from office. The place is nice but found the music a bit loud.

They let you taste few freshly brewed beers as per their that days menu and accordingly you can order.

We ordered a hookah which was too good in taste, - sorry i dont remember the name but it was something rose paan or some flavour.

Sarson Mahi Tikka (mustard and yogurt marinated fish morsels served with mint chutni)- The bhetki was perfectly cooked and very soft and melted in the mouth.
Green Chilli Chicken (diced chicken tossed in coriander and lemon grass) - This was okay in taste. Just if you want to try new dishes go for it otherwise you can give it a miss.
Lonely Planet - I tried this non-alcoholic drink, which was very refreshing.

Went there last night around 10:30pm. Being a Saturday night it was crowded and had to wait for ten minutes. But the host was awesome and lived up to his promise to provide us a good place. Service was beyond expectations and despite being crowded, prataap the person in charge ensured service level was its peak. Food was awesome and so was the ambience and music.

They certainly need to Raize their level of hospitality, which is a must if they need to survive here. and yes, the music was just too loud . as someone rightly said " thotha chana baaje ghana. "

So finally RTB gets the license to do the brew.

I have already visited the place thrice and each time the experience has been great. They have 4 different beers – American Lager, English Stout, German Wheat and Belgian Witbiere -  and the taste of each imparts a feeling of quality. Though, I always consume all four flavours being a beer aficianado, my personal favourites are the lager and the stout. The stout has a delicious creamy coffee-chocolatey mouthfeel with that bold bitterness that good stouts are known for, to top it up with the creamy head.

The interiors exude class and it appears a lot of thought went into it. There are ample seating arrangements for everyone. The food too appears to be of good quality from what I have tried so far – fish n’ chips, green chilli chicken, grilled veg platter and veg teriyaki.

The staff too is friendly and you feel welcome right from the moment you come at the gate, whether you are in twos, threes, fours or even solitary.  I must mention one particular service staff – Shubhojit (bearded lad), very prompt with the requirements placed, and always eager to serve and help. 

All in all, a good, swank, upper crested, posh establishment with good beer, good food, good crowd and ofcourse, the good people who are making it all happen. Shall always visit. 

Cheers!

Food is the primary need of any human being. And eating out one always wants a blend of good food and warmth of people who give that service. Today was my first day at "Raize the Bar" and I had a real nice experience. The first dish that was served I felt the food was not as hot as it should be so I spoke to the waiter who listened to my issue and called the concerned person - Shivangi Khandelwal to have a word with me. She listened to my concern, requested me if she can check the food and later returned with the chef. The chef took full responsibility of what I was looking for and got me another dish. I was delighted. Not only this all the waiters, Ms Khandelwal and the chef gave me a great experience and extremely polite. People who accompanied me were also happy with the service. In the recent times for a person like me who eats out in most of the prime restaurant this restaurant is a BIG THUMBS UP.

Food is the primary need of any human being. And eating out one always wants a blend of good food and warmth of people who give that service. Today was my first day at "Raize the Bar" and I had a real nice experience. The first dish that was served I felt the food was not as hot as it should be so I spoke to the waiter who listened to my issue and called the concerned person - Shivangi Khandelwal to have a word with me. She listened to my concern, requested me if she can check the food and later returned with the chef. The chef took full responsibility of what I was looking for and got me another dish. I was delighted. Not only this all the waiters, Ms Khandelwal and the chef gave me a great experience and extremely polite. People who accompanied me were also happy with the service. In the recent times for a person like me who eats out in most of the prime restaurant this restaurant is a BIG THUMBS UP.

Good place. Good Ambience. Good music. 
Food is decent. Dance floor could be bigger.(not rightly placed; near the entrance). 
Hospitality at its best.
P.S. This is for the lady manager who was professional and helpful. Keep up the good work. Much appreciated ma'am.

Awesome ambience with quick prompt and polite waiters, this new upscale place in sector 5 took us off our heels. Music was techno and commercial house. As soon as I entered couple of my all time favourite ones by David Guerra and Avicii were played by the DJ.

It's a microbrewery with 4 varieties of their craft beer. We had a taster and selected Belgian and German varieties. The Belgian one was stronger. Taste was good. Details were provided regarding the contents, benefits, bitterness, and few more factors.

I would rate their food and presentation as really unique. We ordered green chilli chicken, chilli chicken tangra style and oregano seasoned chicken tikka. Their varieties were a fusion of Indian and foreign cuisines.

Green chilly chicken and the tangra style chilli chicken were super good. Succulent well cooked pieces of chicken. Tikka with oregano was not the best though.

The waiters are quick and take good attention. Hooka is being served. Rates are nominal for a place like this. The warmth of Bengali hospitality coupled with innovative and creative ideas make this place one of the best in sector 5.

Nice lil place..although a brewpub but they dont brew beers yet. Looking at the installations I feel it will happen soon enough! But overall a decent place..nice music..fast serving staff! Bit higher on pricing..but quantity of food and its taste makes up for it! Overall a good experience. The brewery takes away the 1.5 stars✌

I like the service, you wouldn’t have to wait a long time! They are very courteous and keen on serving their customers! 
 
Food : 4.5/5 
I really like the food as well as the drinks! I’ve had a few shots and absinthe and a variety of cocktails! All were up to the mark! 
I could go on and on about the food! Starting from the Mediterranean burger, one of my favourites! The pink sauce pasta, Mexican rice, the vegetarian kebab platter, Melting mushroom, the Margarita pizza are yum! 
I’m looking forward to the advancement of the brewery! 
Hookah is good too! 

Ambiance: 4/5 
I really like the vibe of the place,the music,the seating and the view! It is a must visit!

Recently visited RTB for a dinner and the craft beer tasting session..the Belgian wheat was amazing. We tried the green chili chicken,thin crust pizza,fish tikka and a prawn delicacy...the fish was succulent and not over powering with spices..chili chicken was perfect with the fresh green chili paste hint and nicely done (keeping the right juiciness of the protein)..the pizza was in a different shape in rectangular and the place was buzzing..We enjoyed to the core and was a lovely experience.undoubtedly the best in the Sector-v area which has a great fan following from the other part of the city as well.,.

So this place in salt lake was long in my checklist. And Finally visited here
Visited mainly for their new offerings russian hookah and craft beer.
The Russian hookah was the smoothest hookah I have ever had. The flavour was savvy and the smoke sense.
They provided testers for the craft beers. I liked all of them. Especially the espresso beer was awesome.
In food melting mushroom -one of the finest mushroom dish I have ever had and the serving style was too 👌👌
Ambience is good. I was seating by the bar and the bar tenders were extremely courteous to our requests and enquiries. Dj a bit loud and dance floor a bit small. Overall a good experience will definitely visit again.

Nice place, loud music & not the great food. The fish finger wasn't that great, the mutton was only full of bones and almost no meat and rest of the food was so so. I am talking about a buffet dinner though. One time visit is all it takes to know this place. Yes, last but the not the least tiniest smoking room ever.

Visited this place for lunch on Saptami. The place was quite empty and still service was a bit sluggish. We started with their special melting mushroom and it was something to die for, we even repeated the order. After that we tasted chicken spaghetti , pan fried chilli fish and fish and chips - all items were great but for the drink menu many of the items were missing though. However overall a nice experience!

Visited this place few days back. It's on the Waterside building(Saltlake). Booked via dineout & got 20% discount on total bill amount. Now coming to food I've seen reviews on Zomato before that people love their Chello Kabab, so tried it & it was really awesome in taste. The rice in chello kabab was so tasty & kabab was too good. I can definitely say it is better than Peter Cat's chello kabab. Now in dessert I've tried their popular Fried Ice-cream & it was out of the world, the taste was sooo good. I just fell in love with it. Really good. Everyone should try this one. But they need to improve their service little bit. Otherwise it's a nice pub to eat&drink.😊😋

If you want to party and drink till your wallet can't take it anymore, this is the place to be. If you want a quiet conversation and cheap booze, find another joint.

Raize the Bar is at an oddly situated place on the ground floor of Godrej Waterside off the Sec V Ring Rd. They do check id's so make sure you're carrying one. The staff were courteous and it's a spacious bar with high chairs and small-ish tables. Anyway, the beer is fairly expensive here, unfortunately their craft beer system isn't functional yet, will be trying that once it's up and running. We ordered some starters, Chicken Wings and Teriyaki Chicken. The wings were strictly so-so, ranking with the also-rans in the Best Wings competition, if any. Unique presentation though, 5/5 for creativity. The Teriyaki chicken is good, with a hint of overdosing on the Soy sauce. But it's a cheap dish with enough to go around for 4 people in bite sized pieces.

The music unfortunately is loud, very loud. Makes for a difficult place to have a conversation. It's the one thing I remember most about the place and that, is a pity.

I'm sorry, if the picture is grainy and undiscernable. My camera isn't the best in dim light. 😂

Dj is not proffesional at all. They used to refuse your request. It was Friday night and the dj was playing english songs, when I asked for bollywood songs he justified that Bollywood songs only on Saturday and I have accepted it happily. Someone given him money and requested for same then only he accepted it. Then I have asked him why you are playing it right now, it's not Saturday then he told it's up to me. We are totally unsatisfied with there services and behaviour. At the time of leaving we showed him **** off, dj started using slang languages over it, rushing out me and tried to hit me and the manager started defending him with no apologies of wrong behaviour made by their dj. Bounceres started to push us after spending 10k bucks. This place is not good at all and not safe. These guys are totally unprofessional, they don't know how to serve their customer. They don't have any proffesional behaviour. This is totally rediculos.  This happened last night only. This is worst experience I ever had.

Being a regular customer here, I really like their Hookah and their Indian Platter Starter and the Chinese Platter starter. They did have a problem of 'too loud music for human ears' sometime back but they seem to have worked on it. They could work on their drinks though, specially availability of beers.

Value for money - Not so over priced compared to its ambience and quality. Overall nice.

Overall nice evening and good hangout place for friends.

I have tasted the chicken lasagna from here, it's good too.
Fish and chips tasted awesome, pure bhetki it was.

Serving style is classy. Food quality is great. Ambience, music is trendy. The waiters are well behaved.

Mahasasthi evening experience at Raize the Bar was a complete showstopper! Fairly easy to locate with their big yellow hoarding on the Godrej Waterside, me and my school friends were in for a fun night and it served us just right. Moderately spacious, RDB has everything from hookah to a dedicated bar, brewery and seating area. The food, the alcohol and the service everything was better than what I expected out of it and the ratings do justice for what they offer. In the drinks their Watermelon Mojito and LIT were the best, though we also had their Cosmo, Red Wine Sangria and Mandarine Margarita. The bartender did a good job with each of them except the Cosmo had too much cranberry juice in it which just made it plain sweet. In the appetizers their popular Melting Mushrooms are absolutely worth the hype, buttery soft mushroom shots served with a sweet and sour red sauce. Steller stuff. Chilly chicken tangra style tasted nice but was more of a dry chilly chicken thing with no striking difference. Our meal followed with a terrific Lasagna, their popular Meaty Pizza and a Pan fried chilly fish. The pan fried chilly fish was okaish, a tad on the over fried side for my liking. The meaty thin crust square pizzas were all filled with chicken sausages and grilled chicken chunks was decent enough but I have had better. What stole the show was clearly their Lasagna, it's hands down one of the bests in the city. A fried icecream in the end was the cherry on top. The staff here are courteous, attentive and efficient. Our bill amounted to 6048 and it was totally worth the food and the service. Raise the Bar is clearly a winner among the new & budding pubs at sector v and I would love to come back soon.

A place to rejuvenate yourself after a long day at office. Also since it is Puja season now and if you want time-out from the crowd, try out this Sector V pub. The ambience is awesome and the interiors are classified nicely into three dictinct sections.
Wine-barrel seating arrangements, long bar counter, loud music, classy decor, DJs, good food and the variety of Cocktails are the X factors of this place. Basket of assorted fries, Nachos and Paneer Platter were our favorites along with Haakiwi, Margarita and Long Island Ice Tea. 
A thumbs up from my side and a place I can depend upon to overcome my office blues.

I went for birthday party, had a pint of bira, lots of other starters like chili chicken tyangra style, garlic prawn, paneer tikka platter, non veg platter, green chili chicken as starter.

I specially want to mention about chili chicken tyangra style and non veg platter, they are really the best in taste. rest of them are okayish but less in quantity.

Crowded friday night, usually take lots of time to serve any order, which is very much irritating.

Helpful staffs with nice hospitality but waiting time for food is more than expected.

Pan flavoured hukka is smooth and nice.

Nice pub atmosphere, but little annoying karaoke event, with the pathetic voice and tempo of people.

But the DJ was good to groove the people, and make them dance on the dance floor.

Definitely I want to try again this place for music, food and atmosphere, with a hope of a better experience.

They might come up with new micro brewery, I am eagerly waiting for that.

Located near godrej waterside near to ring road college more stretch in sector v , this is quite a nice pubstyle resturant .
Seating arrangements are divided in some sofas ,chairs , liquor barrel stand circular tables ,bar stools and all . Those circular tables also give a view of busy sector ring road and canal outside . But the sofa's are more cozy I feel .
The foods and choice of cocktails are good . Food tatsted good such as chili chicken dry,butter garlic prawns,fish and chips (decoration of the item was also good and straight out of some british eateries that we have seen) . Mojito was good as well and it was nice to find the barman coming to inform about choices as one of ingredients was not available for the ordered item .
All in all good food and drinks ,very good environment and moderately good service (need some improvement in serving) makes this one of good joint out of many in sector -v area . Go and enjoy in raize the bar ,you won't be disappointed .Aditi Sengupta

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. This place feels like home. I felt as if I was in Mumbai. Amazing ambiance, live dj, great sheesha, super polite and well mannered staff. My favourite place in Kolkata has to be raize the bar.
What we had-
∆ Veg kebab platter- this was basically our chakna.
∆ Sheesha- perfectly made. They use magic coal n we got a complimentary coal change so that was nice.
∆ strawberry mocktail- beautifully made my little sister loved it, so good we ordered another one. (Underage ppl are allowed but they can't hv drinks obviously)
∆ few shots, pints and dancing all the time.
Perfect girls night out. Definitely coming back whenever I am in Kolkata.
P.s- girls night out scored us complimentary shots which was really sweet.

Place & Food is good only, they don't serve all liquor brands mentioned on menu. Price is a bit high, they will make it higher by taking all kind of extra charges possible, like sitting charge restroom use charge etc etc lol 😂 They took 8% service charge on my bill after taking 18% of @GST. For what guys? U dont have money to pay your staffs? Explain.

Alas! Another place added to the list of Structural Only Micro Brewery in Kolkata.

Raize the bar, your bar is so much under that no matter how much u raise it, u ll barely be able to reach the ground.

Ambience - 2.5
Decor - 2
Music - God only knows coz it was so loud that even they would be getting disturbed
Hospitality - Gone to hospital
Food - 3.5 (the only saving grace)

Common it was a Saturday nite and I expect the DJ to do some justice to the name. The guy was thoroughly confused and was playing everything from Punjabi to Katy Perry. And there were people trying to do some robotic dance steps which was not even funny. I understand that the restaurant wouldn't have any control over the dance but for me it left a bad taste.

We had barely ordered few appetizers, and a main course as well, which we later realized that the guy taking the order has forgot to punch in the system. And the place was not even crowded.

-Cheese chilly toast was good, could have been a little less oily though.
- Melting mushroom is a must try not for the taste but for its presentation. The taste was not bad either.
- The nachos seemed to follow the DJs footstep and the preparation seemed to be Lil confused and overloaded with salt

If u r alone and want to grab a beer listening to some deafening music and u happen to be in sector 5, then this place can feature is your must try list

Our food experience was not good. The food was nothing great. They did not have the wines we wanted to have and had to chose from the ones they suggested. The music was decent. The hookah was flavourless. If u just want to drink and listen to Bollywood remixes then a decent place to go to.

Well a very classy pub in the sector 5 area. The food was too notch based on price, quality and quantity. I had been very satisfied. It's a sports bar and you can enjoy a match with good quality food and drinks. Service had been quite good as well. Although the waiter forgot a drinks order and had to be reminded, overall it was quite amicable and swift. What I did not like was the DJ. Music was too loud and not very engrossing. It was difficult communicating. I also did not like the sitting arrangement. The tables are short and the sitting was not at all comfortable. But overall a good pub for a short hangout in a very convenient location.

Being made to wait for the so called driving officer from 10.30 am to 5 pm was tiring and irritating ... and finally with a month or so training the wife passed her driving test with flying colors... Hungry and tired #RAIZETHEBAR was the perfect place for relaxation, good music and amazing food.

The staffs were great... I liked the part where a staff  accepted his fault for not placing an order for Lasagna con pollo and instead he placed an order for Pizza Stracetti and came to apologize us and asked if we would take the pizza instead and we accepted it, after all we humans do make mistakes ..  And such a nice gesture shown by the staff he gave my wife a mock tail free of cost...  Much Appreciated ...   
Also not to forget finally i could enjoy Hoegaarden .. I was looking for this beer for over a year now in Kol ....  Last i guess i had it in Delhi...   
Anyways over all its an amazing place, amazing food and crazy music .. Will surely visit again...

Hoping to have a quite dinner with drinks I landed up at Raize The Bar with a bunch of friends.The restaurant has a sprawling space with two different section which gives it an added advantage over othr places in sector 5.Entering through the main door one faces the bar counter where the men are busy at their creations.The bar counter adjoining area has seating arrangements divided between high chairs and tables of 4.On the extreme left is a separate area for hosting private parties for different occasions.We seated ourselves in a table of 4.The server immediately showed up with what i would call quite a fat menu.The brewery is not yet functional but the cocktail menu is quite impressive.My friends ordered for a couple of beers given a bad throat while I ordered for a hookah which arrived in a jiffy.The hookah had a strong flavour of apple ...well​ made.Our food choices included the bbq chicken wings and grilled chicken breast in mushroom sauce served with mashed potatoes .The bbq sauce was too tangy as per my taste but my friends loved it.The mushroom sauce on the other hand was light ,flavourful with the perfect balance of salt and made a perfect combination for the grilled chicken.The mashed potato could be more creamier...well who complains with more cheese.The only issue was for a thursday the music was too loud.If you want to have a chilled out time head towards this place.

The ambience of this pub is amazing. The staffs are very courteous and attentive. For starters we took fish n chips and chilly chicken tangra style. Fish item was good but chilly chicken could have been better though that was suggested by the staff there. They serve some amazing platters for the main course and also in good quantities. We opted for Ami kolkata and Cilantro rice mix bowl and both were awesome. Ami kolkata was again suggested by a staff there who claimed that the chelo kabab would be better than Peter Cat even. Though I would not compare but definitely the one in raize the bar was one of the best chelo kebab i had. Would recommend this place specially for the food.

 Raize the bar stood above my expectations. From the decor to  the ambience, from the food to the smoke, from the hospitality to the classiness, Raize the bar contents everything. Reader's should not think about the place much. Quickly grab your party shoes and hop in!

Definitely, One of the best places I have been to,in Kolkata. Located in Godrej Waterside building, Sector V Salt lake, I used to regularly cross the building, but never entered it, but I am glad, I finally did. Dont let the silent and deserted outside fool you, once you enter the place you will feel the energy inside the place.

Service: Too good.
We were warmly greeted at the entrance and guided to the table. The order was taken in a very professional way, and the whole experience right till the end was smooth.

Food: Quite good.
We had BBQ chicken wings which was really yum.
Then we had a Pizza. The crust was great though could have been better.
Finally we had the Fried ice cream which was mind blowing, both in taste as well as presentation.

Ambience: Excellent
The place has beautiful decor, thus we got a chance to click a lot of selfies. ;) The groovy music adds to the energy of the place.

Overall it was a great experience. Will certainly be visiting this place again.

The decor and the ambiance of this place is simply exquisite... The bar looks extremely beautiful during the evening (because of the lighting) and a prefect spot  to take pictures 😉. 
This place is huge with some interesting and comfortable seating arrangements. 
The price of the alcoholic beverages are bit higher than the usual price . 
The price of the food items are again on the higher side but it's totally worth it when it comes to the quality and taste.

Visited RTB with friends on a Saturday night and came back absolutely satisfied! It's difficult to say what was more impressive - food, drinks, ambience, or service! This place was impressive on all the counts. We started with sangria, which was good - not great. Perhaps the weakest link in our tale as the bar kept raising with each subsequent order. Chilli cheese toast, stuffed mushrooms (ufff! To die for!!), the Bellini, loaded nachos - all well done! And the music - one of those evenings when the DJ just rules.. special mention of the DJ - it was a girl at the helm of it and she totally rocked the party! Kudos and more power! Well done team RTB.. we are coming back for more mushrooms and more cocktails :)

Wonderful interiors. It's not very spacious, but whatever space they have, it's used pretty cleverly.
The wooden theme works well.

Good food. The chicken wings are so good, so's the chilli chicken. They didn't have calamari, which we wanted to order. Too bad. Slightly overpriced. The music is all remixes, sometimes of Adele's songs. Please don't do that. Take tips from The Grid and Monkey Bar.

For drinks, we just kept ordering pints of BIRA and Budweiser.
The smoking room is pretty cool. Skeleton-themed ashtrays and the ceiling is painted as a view from inside a grave.

Also, they take forever to bring a hookah to the table. So much so, that we cancelled ours after waiting for almost half an hour.

Overall, recommended. They've got very good food. Book a table through Zomato/Dineout to avoid waiting.

Located at the ground floor of the opulent Godrej Waterside complex it is very easy to spot. The ambiance is very good and on a rainy day like today the view from the inside is very scenic. We went there on an impromptu lunch out plan. We tried the fish and chips and the Barbequed chicken wings as starters. The surprise of the day came in the form of melting mushrooms, the spicy and tangy taste of dish fused soo well together that it was just perfect. In the main course both Kungpao chicken and Tangra Kitchen was pretty good as combos. The fried ice cream was the perfect ending this outing deserved.
Would love to revisit, anytime.

I recently tried the buffet they have recently started. 499+taxes. However, they add the service tax as well in the bill which is optional. The menu was pretty good with a lot of variety- Chicken tikka, chili fish, veg spring rolls and some chilli paneer for starters.
Tom yum soup which was amazing. GI shots , ceasar salad, some more 3 varities of salads, papad, n mini buns. Then for main course- mutton lucknow style biriyani, chicken methi, Mexican noodles, fish in red wine, pindi chana, steam rice, some daal and don't remember the veg options much. For drinks there were 3 types of draught beer and mocktails. For deserts - mango ice cream with darsan and baked rasgulla which was the only disappointment.

Well, I visited RTB on a Monday and what a vibe. I'm in love with this place especially because of the food. As usual I forgot the name is my platter. 
All I can tell you is, this place is worth all your dime. 
"Take my money and make me happy." This place also serves hookah (which I'm not fond of).
Also, Shivangi is the PRO of this place and is a very humble person. I loved how she interacted with us after our bill was served :) 
GO VISIT :)

Have heard many good things about this place and after visiting here a few weeks ago, I second that opinion. Raize The Bar is easily located at Sector 5 and is spacious pub and restaurant. The interiors are nicely done. The bar area looks great. Me and my friends ordered a Gumsupari Hookah and we're happily puffing away. In Food we had the:-
Pizza Provencal- Topped with olives and peppers. Was quite cheesy.
Chicken Lasagne- Awesome taste 💓💓
Kappa Makizushi Sushi- A form of vegetarian sushi. This was my first time trying sushi and I hated it completely.
The service was good. Staff was attentive and polite. Great place to come and have a good time. Cheers!

Before going to office had a little booze and good food at this brewery . The X factor about this place is that you get to be surrounded by big cylinders of beer and can witness beer making in the background . However having no dance floor to shake your leg makes it quite unreliable as the DJ plays good songs . The food was good and it had nice dips to complement your chicken . I went with one of my friend and had 3 pints of beer , one shot of smirnoff on the rocks ( less booze since office was calling at night 😛 ) , one chicken barbeque wings and a platter of chicken tikka kabab coated with oregano whose side dip was just yummy and in the dessert had an amazing dessert however the name seemed too big to be remembered 😁 Overall nice place however would not feel like going again as I did not get that vibe like other places .

Went to this place in the middle of a thunderstorm & rain last night with a friend. Was eyeing this place for a really really long time & finally decided to go for a couple of drinks & some food there. What can I say.. Starting from the amazing decor.. mood setting music.. to the drinks.. the food. After a round of our signature scotch whiskeys, the man who was serving us drinks suggested we go for The Group Shot since we craved for some Tequila & with all the 4 different flavours of it it was so good!! We also ordered a Kahlua & a Bailey's Irish cream.. the former being near to perfection, amazing blend of flavours. The latter could have been slightly better, but good nevertheless.
 For food we started of with a Chilli Chicken in Tangra style.. and then went on to order Chicken Teriyaki, a meaty pizza & another fish dish. Hungry as we were.. we just couldn't stop eating as soon as the food was being served :P Also since it was a post birthday celebration, the resto manager Shivangi was so kind & helpful in arranging a Brownie cake for my friend with a mini birthday song in the backdrop. It was so sweet of her to give us a gift card which we could avail a discount from the next time we visit. Thank you Ms Shivangi for the wonderful evening. Loved the place. Loved the food. The service. Staff behaviour. I can't wait to go back there once again. <3

Amazing view from the bar, loved that for starters. 

This can be located right from the main road. The interior is more or less like a brewery with beer tanks and barrels. 
High stools and spacious seating. 
We went there for a small span of time so, chilled with 2 points of beer and classic chicken tikka, as per their suggestion. 
It was really tasty. Succulent pieces of chicken tikka and cooked perfectly with the spices. Served with onions and pudina chutney in shot glasses. 

Good presentation and courteous staff. 
Would love to go visit again 💯

Decent place in sector 5 to hangout with friends or office buddies. Went to this place after office with some friends, though it was quite late but the ambience and the hospitality were really good.  

Tried to go for some beer,.but most of the good brands were unavailable. Same happened with other liquors also, so went for the drinks that were available at that moment. Also tried pizza and chilli baby corn to go with that. Food wa quite decent and the service was worth an appreciation. 
Would have given a better rating, but giving 3.5 due to the availability of drinks which was really disappointing.

One of the best place to hangout in sector 5. I loved it's ambience. A place apt even to go with family ❤
Food is delicious and the service makes it better! 
I heard a lot about it's Melting mushrooms and it is no doubt the best starter there.  We also had a tandoori kebab platter, two sizzlers and a Lebanese platter. I didn't think sizzler was upto the mark as compared to other main course platters which we had.  I had had a much better Lebanese platter than that served here. (Quantity was also not according to the standard Mezze platter) 
I loved the "Samui Stir fried greens"(rice based dish with gravy) and  "Veg terayaki platter"(Noodles with veggies). 
Must try for vegetarians💯

I visited this place on my bdy with my friend. Very good ambience & nice interiors. The taste of food was amazing. The executive and service guys are very well mannered. The music was so good that i ordered one more dish to be there . I loved the music and i going to come again . The only thing i didn't find good was it's Nacho's. I have never had such poor taste of it. It was pain to eat. Please improve that. That's why 4 star only.

I went to this place during a sizzler fiesta. Tried two veg sizzlers, one with cottage cheese, sour cream and rice. Another one with noodles and paneer Momo. Tried two non veg sizzlers, one Tandoori platter that came with chicken kebabs, dal makhani and kulcha. Another one with bhetki fish fry. All four items were great and had very unique taste. But I give 4 rating majorly because of the ambience of the place. The music, the decor and the amazing service will surely lift up your mood.

Now here is a pub where the food beats all else hands down! 

Nice little place located at Godrej Waterside. Feels like the right place to hang out as you walk in the doors. The decor is warm and you feel at ease soon enough. The only gripe I have is the lack of space to move around but that is entirely acceptable given the rest.

Food is where they outshine peers. If you find it tough to decide what to go for, you may always ask for the platters which are a selection of fine kebabs - fish, chicken, prawns and mutton sheekh. Kudos to the house chefs who certainly do justice to their trade. What I liked even more was that although the service was quick the dishes looked pretty and well presented.

The beer tasted very fresh and had that zing which is often missing from the bottled ones. The Sheesha was enjoyable as well. 

Music was good and set the right mood for the evening. 

Altogether a wonderful and relaxing experience I will certainly love to revisit.

Went after my exam and one time after that. 

Hookah is average. Service quality and reassurance of quality is great. Pizza is good. Quantity of pasta is very less, quality is decent.

Rest other food items were okayish. Like paneer tikka was okayish and another platter i ordered which comes with fried rice - the gravy was very bad. 


Ambience: Ambience is great. It has live music by a dj which is decent. Has got a dance floor. And the overall environment is very sexy.

Staff and the managers are very very well behaved.

If you're going for drinks make sure it doesnt create a hole in your pocket as you can book a table from dineout app and get 20-30% off on total bill. 

This place is amazing to go with friends or even family.

This place has got young crowd. Like 20-30 years old crowd. 

Only thing which they should improve on is overall re engineering of food by altering the tastes and including more options.

Variety is less ..a little bit more compared to pour house but doesnt match 10 downing street even a bit. 

Also to be noted that they dont keep beer cans which I think they do it purposely bcz they earn more on pints which is very bad. 

Sometimes you dont get few brands of whisky available. But thats quite normal.

Visited this place on 20th May at their mindblowing event "Saturday Night Mayhem" 
No doubt DJ Harish Rocked the pub that night.. The pub looked full packed..
Dim light and super awesome ambience..

Now coming to food, drinks and service..
Food was mouthwatering
Drinks were super awesome..
And hatsoff to all the servers who managed to deliver each and everything on table at time..
Since the pub was full packed I thought I may get slow service but I was wrong..

Highly impressed with their top class service and management !
Would recommend my friends to visit the place.
Looking forward for more upcoming DJ nights and other events at this highly reputed pub..
Please..Start the brewery soon...! ☺

Sumptuous food is best part to treat your guests. Wide collection of new world wine and of course chilled beer satisfied my thirst. I am a regular visitor of this restaurant and always it has proven a great place to chill out. Managers and chefs are very proactive to the services. Large menu with various options and chefs are always ready to customize your palate where I can rediscover my choice. Thanks to city of joy and the place.

This popular pub comes with a big reputation. After having been turned away the last time due to my partner being in shorts, I had to come back because I was excited to see how it is. It turned out to be quite a muted experience, ironically.

The sangria was overloaded with fruit, especially orange bitters. It made the drink nearly inedible. The mezze platter, I felt could have featured better variety. There were a couple of cheese cigar roll-like elements. I did not understand them and wouldn't have minded if they tasted good. The core hummus element was a failure. It had a funky taste. Not great, sadly. The vegetarian nigiri sushi fared better. The portion size was miniscule though. 

The biggest irritant was the decibel. Maybe I am an old crone but it was insanely loud that night. We and a couple of other tables repeatedly asked for the volume to be turned down. But no luck. We finally left with partially full stomachs and bleeding eardrums. Beyond me why they chose to keep blasting the music despite complaints.

Overall ambience was good. Most of the staff's behavior was decent, excluding one who falsely claimed that the table of our choice was reserved which was not the case. Food quality was good too. Had a few pint of beer followed by a cocktail.

Normally, the cocktails in other pubs mostly taste good as they are generally a mixture of 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks with some smooth non-alcoholic flavours. But this specific cocktail, named Moscow Mule, was of horrible taste. It did not have any flavour in it. Just a mixture of Vodka n Beer with some Slices of Ginger in it. The way it was served was also weird which made it difficult to enjoy it even more.

Do try the Melting Mushroom and the Chicken Teriyaki. Both were delicious. And though the pasta preparations on the menu are all made of red sauce, they did make a yummy white sauce penne pasta on our request.

This review was Long overdue. Nonetheless, better late than never!!! So let's go pointwise:
1. Ambience: Really well made. Decor was quite interesting, especially the ashtrays in the smoking zone. Pretty impressive
2. Service: Very hospitable and courteous staff. What impressed me the most was that the Chef actually came to help suggest dishes that would suit me. Even the servers were very jolly, friendly and helpful.
3. Food and Drinks: For food, opted for a Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce going with the Chef's suggestion and throughly enjoyed the same. Drinks, had a Jacobs Creek and a Liberian Peninsula as mocktail. Again, very well made.

Overall, awesome place, awesome ambience, awesome food, awesome people. Coming back for sure!!!

I got a complementary deal from little and it's was completely worth. Thank you Team Little. I got 2 pint beer 🍺 in starter I preferred Crispy chilly baby corn followed by Pasta. Beer was chilled and perfect. Baby corn was perfect in taste and a very rare thing to be noticed they were all in same size. Pasta was just mind blowing I think I stopped talking after pasta was served. It had parmesan cheese cheery tomatoes drizzle of olive oil. Dear chef you made my day.

This review was Long overdue. Nonetheless, better late than never!!! So let's go pointwise:
1. Ambience: Really well made. Decor was quite interesting, especially the ashtrays in the smoking zone. Pretty impressive
2. Service: Very hospitable and courteous staff. What impressed me the most was that the Chef actually came to help suggest dishes that would suit me. Even the servers were very jolly, friendly and helpful.
3. Food and Drinks: For food, opted for a Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce going with the Chef's suggestion and throughly enjoyed the same. Drinks, had a Jacobs Creek and a Liberian Peninsula as mocktail. Again, very well made.

Overall, awesome place, awesome ambience, awesome food, awesome people. Coming back for sure!!!

This is just a overhyped destination with nothing good. Soggy atmos and very cold reception. The food ordered was cheesy mushroom and veg kebab platter and both were horrible for taste buds. I really feel to have wasted 2 grands for this ridiculous place. 

Edit- 
They called us multiple times to visit and we took out time on their request. 
This time this was from the end of management and the Executive chef. We were served good food rather delicious one and the service was immaculate and the food was on the house. To be true they " Raized the Bar". Will visit again

Visited this place on Valentine's weekend since they were one of the few places not to have any cover charge. The music and the ambience was too good. This place has the coolest music, the Dj plays unique remixes . Food was tasty and the cocktails were really really good. But Their service is very slow and not upto the mark.

Salt lake. The place where there are numerous offices and myriad young crowd waiting for a Friday night to come so they can get away from their job lives and enjoy a good evening. And when you have such a place in the midst of them, you know you have struck gold. 

Raize The Bar is a good place. The ambiance is very @pleasing and the mood of the place is perfect. The options in the menu are many and obviously drinks!!

We were a group of three people and for the first time in Kolkata with me, all the three vegetarians. Yay!! Finally some company. We ordered CRISPY CHILLY STYLE where we got paneer, potato and babycorn on one plate. The dish was good; nothing to complain about. The second dish was Pizza RTB and it had goat cheese and garlic chips at the top. The taste was completely different as the sauce base was not only tomatoes but a pesto style sauce. Overall a good experience in food department. 

Drinks : LIIT and Kiwi Margarita. Quite good. Appropriate alcohol content and the flavours were coming out nicely. 

Definitely worth a visit here. The entrance looks like an office building but then on the inside a perfect party place.

One of the most happening place in Sector5. This was my second visit to this place and I am as satisfied as the first day. We ordered chicken teriyaki for starters and a colourful mocktail called Lonely planet. Chicken was yumm. Then main coarse was another surprise for us, as it named A trip to Phuket. Pad thai noodle with basil chicken, both was super delicious. Dessert was my all time favourite Fried Ice cream. Apart from food the music was great.

Food quality is too good.Had 4 dishes ....Fish and chips , Chicken Tikka with Oregano , Lasagne with melted chicken and mushroom and the dessert (brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce)...Overall my experience was really good would recommend anybody anytime if someone needs music combined with some good food.

On a casual weekday, we decided to visit this place for lunch from office. When we entered the place, all of us loved the ambience and feel of the place. We ordered for a mocktail - Haakiwi which was quite nice and fresh lime soda which was so average. The sheesha we ordered KIwi Gum Supari - it was nice, nothing too good about it though. For starters we ordered a crispy chill platter kind of thing which had cottage cheese, baby corn and potatoes. It looked like all these are cooked in the same sauce, somehow not so satisfying but it was fine. The spinach cheese cigar rolls which we ordered were very tasty and we totally relished it. For main course we order for a asaparagus risotto and we specified we want vegetables as well, four topping pizza and a spaghetti aglio olio. The risotto was such a disappointment, it seemed like an asparagus khichi, absolutely not herbed. We request the staff to please herb it slightly but they refused to do it on the basis that now that u guys have added oregano and chilli flakes we can't do anything. The pizza and spaghetti we quite good but the portions were baby size in terms of the prize they charged. I was really excited to visit this place and the overall  experience is so disappointing,

Had gone there for my Office Party . The drinks and mocktails were pretty good . We had asked for unlimited alcohol and mocktails and they rightly delivered on that point .The starters that they had provided with the drinks were delicious. The non veg starters were pan fried fish and chicken kabab . The veg starters wrre chilli baby corn and paneer. The main course that they served were not at all up to the mark . I guess this was their way of cutting down on cost since we had booked a package for our office party. Every component served on the main course was awful and none of us enjoyed it. For dessert they served soupy vanilla icecream and dry chocolate mudcake. Overall , i would like to try their foods and see the quality when it's not a package deal and would suggest others to do the same. Otherwise , this place is good for drinks and finger foods. And yes there is one added bonus which is Dance floor.

The environment was chilling and was the good place to stay. Though costly but a good place to chill. Crowd comes there is good and though the dance floor was so small that a bunch of people can hardly move or dance. The main attraction of the place is the crowd they pull.

An awesome place to be present in the friday evening, this has the energy u just require. Music is a bit loud but, u will njoy it. This place has a micro brewery but its not open yet, still need to wait for that. And they have a very little collection of beers, almost no option. Food is awesome, my pick of the day were chiken wings in bbq sauce and teriyaki chicken.

One of my worst experiences..Half of the beers in the menu were not available. We ordered melting mushroom as our appetizer and the sauce served with it tasted very bad.For the main course we ordered the white sauce pasta which tasted fine but the chocolate sauce with it was absolutely inappropriate and tasted bad. The only good thing was the sheesha. Would never visit again nor would recommend it to anyone. Highly disappointing!!

Visited this place many times...😚
Situated at sec 5,college more...just beside the Godrej waterside..🙂

Nice ambiance,great food and chilled beer..what more u need for a great evening...🤗 They have a drinks counter set up in the middle of the bar, that will attract ur eyes fr sure..U can sit there and enjoy ur drink also..😇

My favorite food list here...

1. MELTING MUSHROOM : b=Beautifully served,on top of small bikars.. 6 pieces in total. With the cheese melting over the mushrooms and with a super tasty sauce,.. everytime I visit this place I order this one for sure. The mushrooms really just melts,and tastes a lot different from the other mushrooms dishes I had earlier..and the orange sauce with a zingy taste,gives a flavor blast in your mouth..😇

2. CHICKEN TERIYAKI : Shredded chicken with teriyaki sauce,cooked to perfection..goes well with beer and drinks.😄

3. NONVEG PLATTER : Two kinds of chicken kababs, one sik kabab..one fish kabab and prawn kabab...total 15 pieces..served with one sweet cream and green chutney. Each and every kabab tastes really good..😍.

4. PANEER TIKKA PLATTER : Six paneer pieces with three kind of varieties,,...colorful and tasty.👌

5. LASAGNA : One of the best lasagnas I ever had in town...the pastas r just cooked to perfection..with good amount of cheese and minced chicken layer and a tomato gravy..😍 If u are not ok with too much of cheese ..then don't go for it..else u will just love it 🤗

6. GRILLED CHICKEN BREST : They ask u to choose in which sauce u would like to have ur dish, I had chosen barbq sauce...and the result was great.🤗
Two big chicken breasts,grilled...and served with lots of veggies and mashed potato. 😄😃

The stuffs are really courteous..they suggest u what to order.😊 The hukkah and drinks are amazing too. 🤗
So a great place overall..with this amazing foods,drinks...classy ambiance and music at the background...🤘

Great food, great ambience, slightly pricey but totally worth it.
Chicken teriyaki , Chinese rice and chicken combo, chicken pizza (well portioned) and brownie with ice cream. Each item was different than the other and it was awesomeness defined as far as the brownie was concerned!! 
I was there for lunch but I am sure that the dinner would be a better deal considering the decor and music.

A recipe of a perfect evening with friends is cozy place accompanied with chilled beer,  refreshing sisha and sumptuous food. To set the mood thumping music by a DJ is like icing on the cake. Raize The Bar has scored full marks in all these departments. An impromptu decision to hit RTB has paid off with a memorable evening. 
In food we ordered Chilly Chicken in Tangra Style,  Fish and Chips,  Chicken Teriyaki. Also had Sushi Flavors of Tokyo and Meaty Pizza in the mains. Being a night sponsored by Budweiser we unfortunately had no other options for beer.  The best part is they will check with you to ensure the beer served is as per your likeness of temperature. Very rarely seen this gesture in pubs specially during peak hours. 
Music and speakers are one of the best I have witnessed recently. Crowd quality is very up market too. It's now the best pub in the area. Staffs are not only courteous but also smart chaps. There will be impact to your wallet but quality comes with a cost.

The definition of nightlife is changing in Kolkata and Raize The Bar is indeed one of the powerful catalysts steering the change.. Located conveniently in the Godrej Waterside, a 5 mins walk from College More.. The place is huge to give the ultimate feel to party animals and quite elegantly and carefully designed to impart the modern looks to this place.. This place houses the first micro-brewery in the locality and they specializes in innovative cocktails and specially crafted fusion foods to go well with your drinks..
Visited this place last month on Valentines weekend since they were one of the few places not to have any cover charge.. The place was delightfully decorated for the occasion and the vibes of this place will get you readily into the groove.. The vibrant music will set the tune for a memorable evening and the ambience will allow you to relax and enjoy your drinks and tidbits or even dance to the pop numbers.. You will encounter a huge bar as soon as you enter, the lanterns, the glass pane and the wooden decors add further to the grandeur.. Since the place was choc-a-bloc we were given high bar stools adjacent to the bar, though a bit inconvenient but still manageable.. The only issue I felt was the small dance floor and as the night got young, people gathered on the floor blocking the way out of the restaurant.. Service was quite professional and even on a mostly busy night they never failed to attend our call.. The menu is quite extensive with an interesting selection of dishes, and based on server’s advice we ordered:
Manhattan: One of the most celebrated and popular cocktails globally made from whiskey, angostura bitters and vermouth.. The blend was apt and the drink was strong enough to my likings..
Orange Juice: Fresh and chilled, nothing more to add..
Green Chilly Chicken: This dish caught my attention as soon as I read the menu.. Server claimed it to be their specialty and boy this is some serious flavor.. Loved the punch and twist with Calcuttan’s favorite dish, the lemongrass and coriander paste added a new dimension to the dish and a respite from the usual starters..
Calamari Fritto: Served with French Fries, loved the presentation in a set of conical apparatus.. The accompanied sweetened tamarind chutney perfectly complemented the crunchy squid rings.. A perfect companion for some serious booze..
A Trip To Phuket: A delectable combo platter with a catchy name.. Pad Thai Noodles and Basil Chicken accompanied with Kimchi salad.. Loved the tangy, nutty flat noodles with a slightly sweetish touch.. The heat and tanginess of the basil chicken complemented perfectly the subtle flavors of the pad thai..
We were too full by this time and sadly most of the deserts were not available that night.. Still I will appreciate them for the minimal serving time and the aesthetic plating of the dishes.. This place truly gives a feel of modern global cuisine and hospitality to the people of Kolkata.. Overall our total cheque was Rs.1909/- (all incl.) for 2 people and even though the prices are steeper compared to the portions of dishes served, the environment and experience will compensate for the same..

Pricing: 3/5

'Raize The Bar' is located at Godrej Waterside, Near College More, Sector 5, Salt Lake.Yesterday I've been there with my friends for dinner.First of all ambience is good,low light & loud music with Dj,there is also dance floor.Staffs are friendly,they offered us Ghol for holi special.Atfirst we ordered 'Chicken Teriyaki' as starter.It is little sweet,japanese preparation.We also ordered here some alchohlic drinks like Gin with Tonic water,Long Island Iced Tea & mocktail like 'Liberian Peninsula'- it is mind blowing,fully mixed with orange,lemon grass,palm sugar & chilli..Then we tasted here 'Chilly Chicken Tangra Style','Soy Braised Drums of Heaven' & 'Green Chilly Chicken' as starters.All starters are delicious.'Soy Braised Drums of Heaven' is extremely delicious,fully chicken marinated with sauce & spice.Then we ordered main course like platter.The platters are  'A trip to Phuket (Basil Chicken with pad thai noodles and pickled vegetables)',Pad Thai noodles is very tasty but basil chicken is not up to mark.Other platter is 'Tangra Kitchen Platter (Chilly Chicken with Burnt Garlic Fried Rice),rice & chicken both are tasty.Atlast we ordered here  'Fried Ice-cream with caramel & Cointreau Sauce' & 'Brownie with vanilla ice-cream served with chocolate sauce' as desserts.Both are tasty.All over very good experience.Price is reasonable.They also charged 8% service charge.

The food was high on the taste quotient and the mocktails were a heavenly affair.  I had  quite a number of beverages and calling a favorite would be hard. They have really mastered the art of mixing drinks alcoholic or non alcoholic.

Went to this pub last week, which literally Raized the bar for me, awsm decor, good music and very frndly staff. Being a hardcore non vegetarian I generally opt for non veg, but this place proved that even vegetarian food can be good. Melting Mushroom was mouth watering, barbq chicken wings, meaty pizza, chicken teriyaki was best I had so far. To quench our thirst we ordered normal beers, Hawaiian sundowner, Breakfast Martini. It was a very satisfying experience. Great job guys..

Finally a great pub in Kolkata. Quite huge place with live music, breweries all around, nice decor, good crowd and last but not the least, excellent food and beverages. Ambience is good although a bit slow service. Visited this particular place couple of months back and we have tried Dahi ke kebab, meaty pizza, melting mushrooms. sangria, ginger martinis, classic margarita, kahlua flavoured mascarpone and a sheesha. Food decoration is eye catching although a little over price. But the quality of food and beverages are absolutely mind blowing. Service should be little better as I felt!

This place definitely makes it to one of my favourite places in the city. It would have been so much more popular if it was located in Park Street or somewhere down south,I bet but it's pretty popular in Sector V owing to its convenient location and car parking facility. I loved their cocktails menu.  We tried the Caprioska, Ginger Martini, beer and a few mocktails like the Haakiwi etc. Coming to the food, we had the paneer tikka platter and the chilli cheese toast. Their servings are decent and the chilly cheese toast is highly recommended. 
The ambience is amazing with the bar at the centre, one side of the joint having loud music and hookah and the other side is relatively calmer with beautiful curtains and lighting. 
Staff is decent and the place is a must for a hangout with friends. Add it to your wishlist if you haven't. 
Raise the bar, people!

We ordered a bottle of beer and Chicken lasagne. 
The food was too tasty. The thing which was shocking was that, the waiters didn't even serve us a glass of water. Though we were the only customers there apart from a group of three guys. That was really disappointing as the service tax was around Rs.200 yet they failed to serve us a glass of water. We asked for water after we had our food. And the staff didn't even apologise for the inconvenience. Food was good bt service was really very disappointing.

What to try?
Definitely the mini kathi rolls, tangra style chill chicken and calamari risotto for appetizers.
And you'll know why it's "Raize  the Bar."
For main course, the sea food platter, grilled bhetki and grilled chicken breast.
And if you're are a group of 5-6 people, this is more than enough food for you all and it's worth every penny!

Place is too overrated.Went after reading few reviews and good rating.But the food was not up to the mark.

We ordered chilly chicken tagra style(too salty),a trip to phuket(it was also too salty, wasted a lot),vegetarian kebab platter(too sweet and not a single kebab was edible),wasabi touched nigiri(good) and Haakiwi(best thing we ordered).Ambiance was good but music was too loud.It was too difficult to communicate.

Food was disappointing .Presentation of food and ambiance was descent.

Not often a place amuses you like this place did. Went to grab some drinks and snacks on a weekday. And what a place it turned out to be. Cozy ambience and a nice crowd. The drinks menu is okayish. They need to be better when it comes to more variety. Food was amazing. The dj was good enough. He kept the mood on all along. All I hope is that next time when I visit the place, they have their microbrewery up and working. 
You did "raize" the bar indeed.

I visited this place on 2nd Jan'17. The ambiance was very satisfying and was the restaurants was very well maintained. But when the bill arrived,  I see they have charged Rs 25 for a bottle of water which had MRP Rs 10. I questioned them as to why they are violating the "law of charging packaged water and soft drinks strictly on MRP". They argued that "you have to pay full amount. We cannot do anything".

Again, they charged Service Charge of Rs 54. But as per law passed on 2nd Jan'17, customers have the right not to pay any Service Charge. All total, I was charged extra Rs 69 unnecessarily.

I do not understand why restaurants of such high repute do not follow the law and still continue to increase profits the unethical way. Even the government is not seen to be taking bold measures to implement a law created many many days ago. This particular incident of overcharging customers totally ruined our experience. I have also written about this to the Consumer Court.

Visited this place yesterday (Monday, 2nd January) with my office colleagues. Though it looked promising initially, the overall take away from the place was highly disappointing as it turned out to be extremely over-priced.
Music was too loud and they refused to turn it down.
Though the food quality was good, service was lagged.

Location is perfect for after office parties and drinks. Situated in Salt Lake Sector 5 area and surrounded by corporate offices, this place attracts plenty of people from close by offices to party and enjoy.

The food and the ambiance is too good. The service is worth recommending and the music is over the top. 

The only thing i found that these guys can improve upon is that all varieties of beers are not available even though listed in their menu and this thing turns of people. On my visit, only 2 kinds of beers were available and that is something that should not be happening at such a place.

Overall, a nice experience and one can always drop by to have fun and relax with your friends and colleagues.

If you haven't tried out Raize the Bar yet, please do. It has raised the effin' bar. Food, beverage, service, ambience, everything simply spot on.

Situated at Godrej Waterside building, this place is very easy to locate. The ambience is nice. The decor is decent with wooden furnitures and old school lanterns. The barrels of the beer are visible right outside the glass walls of the restaurant. The waiters are all well trained, very polite, and helpful. They are prompt in taking orders and serving. 

Absolutely no complaint about the food or the beverages. We begun with sangria, ginger martini, and classic margarita. For food we had dahi kebab, melting mushrooms, meaty pizza and Kahula flavoured mascarpone. The dahi kebab was delicious. The saffron yogurt dip gave it a fantastic punch. The melting mushrooms was a simple dish but was very appetizing. Loved the dip made by sweet chili sauce and garlic. The pizza was good (if not extraordinary). The Kahula flavoured mascarpone was out of the world. Perfectly balanced. No extra sweetness. The bitterness of the coffee did go perfectly with the cheese.

P.S. please keep the option for the hot beverages (tea or coffee) available, it's winter and people badly need these often.

This is by far the best restaurant cum bar in sector five, even better than opium. Ambiance, service, food, drink everything top notch. Seven of us went there for a small office party and we enjoyed thoroughly. Though the wooden chairs are little uncomfortable but rest are excellent. Service is excellent, you just raise your hand and someone will come to you. They are taking 8% service charge so good service is quite natural I guess! Waiters are polite and knowledgeable. We ordered some alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks along with many veg and non veg starters, didn't take any main course. Drinks were good and food excellent. Ordered pan fried chili fish, soy braised drumsticks, jhinga nisha, pasandeeda paneer, barbeq chicken wings, sarson mahi tikka, dahi ke kabab. All of them were absolutely delightful, special mention goes to dahi kabab, too good. Would have given 5 stars but deducting 0.5 marks as they don't serve any mutton item and taxes are really high, otherwise had a great time there..

A really spacious and cool pub located in sector 5. I liked the interiors a lot, low lights, wooden seating with lanterns and ropes for decoration. I wish it was a microbrewery by now as Calcutta desperately needs one by now. The alcohol rates are decent and the food quality is really good for the prices. I had the chili cheese toast and BBQ chicken wings and loved both. The mezze platter looked interesting too. 
I wish the service was more swift and the music a little toned down, the high volume makes it difficult to have conversations and is disturbing sometimes.

Fish & chips were good but could have been better, chilli chicken was pretty regular. For the main course i tried grilled bhetki and it was good.A trip to Phuket' was also good and recommended. I also tried 'Ami kolkata' which was chelo kebab and it was amazing, very very well cooked and presented. Very much recommended. The cilantro rice with chicken was good. Quantity was sufficient, quality was upto the mark. Overall a good experience. '

Newly opend pub at Salt Lake sector v near college more. Its a micro brewery pub . They have got the liquor licence but still waiting for the micro brewery licence. The place has already made a big name in kolkata.  The food which they serve is up to the standard of any other 5 star hotel. Service wise they are the best in the city. Staffs are very polite  .smart. quick with full of positive attitude . Music is just out standing. Ambience is like a county side pub. Interior is excellent . I strongly recommend this place all kolkata people .

This place is supposed to be a microbrewery, but it isn't, which is really a big disappointment. They serve liquor on Friday and weekends only, as they haven't got the license yet!!
But the food is upto the mark. We had ordered a chicken lasagne and cheesy mushroom. The garnishing and the presentation of the cheesy mushroom was eye catchy and tasty too!! 
Melting mushrooms topped with creamy cheese served on a beaker with tangy chili sauce.
We had also ordered a chocolate shake, a drink name lonely planet, and a hookah. The drink was very refreshing.
Would like to come here again for the hookah and the lovely cheesy mushroom 😍

I might agree with all the other positive feedback that other users have given , but if the bar really has so much preference towards the private parties organised in their premises, they must keep a separate sound proof section for such gatherings (where the party has the freedom to play any list of  songs in any language around the globe, BUT THESE SONGS CANNOT BE FOR THE ENTIRE GENTRY OF THE CLUB WHEN ITS NOT SPECIFIED AS SUCH A NIGHT ). Very biased and preferential environment 

Otherwise food was good but the music spoiled the entire time !

And I'm gonna say this too ! "Raize the Bar, you have for sure Raised the effin Bar !" Great going ! First ever Micro Brewery In Kolkata !

I'd like to keep my review short, so, here it goes.

Ambience - Full on 10 !
Staff - 10 !
Food Taste - An 8 ! The Biryani was bad. Really bad.
Food Presentation - Ten !
Music - Not Sure.

Must Try - Na Real and Lebanese Platter.

Word of Advice - Why Edm and Hindi Dance Songs all the time when you have the Legend in the background ? Should keep different genres on specific days. Biryani should definitely be improved upon.

The food is really bad and the rating is sky high and too exaggerated for a place with such average quality of food and dishes with comparatively such high price.
The ambience is really nice though and the brewery is a welcome change in the city and certainly the high point to brag about for the owners.
Seemed like a nice place to hangout with friends but definitely a disastrous place for lunch.
The service is also very bad and the waiters are lazy to say the least. So overall not a must visit type of place and certainly does not leave much good impressions.
Altgough the menu boasts of lobster and salmon but considering the fact that the normal dishes are so bad I wouldn't waste money and take any chances with the expensive ones. 
Would prefer Chilli's or other places of this sort.

We have been to this restaurant for lunch hearing very good reviews about the restaurant. But we were extremely disappointed with the food and service. It took almost more than 1hr 30 m to get the food and that too we did not get the complete order. After such a long wait and hoping that the food will be good, but the platter and other dishes were not at all good comparing the price that they are charging. There are much better options. The quantity they serve for a dish is not even sufficient for one person. We even had to ask for spoons and forks multiple times. And moreover they do not even give finger bowls. They should at least improve their service if not the food quality. We had order Seafood platter, meat platter, non-veg platter, grilled chicken with cilantro rice and some chinese combo. Horrible experience. I will not recommend it at all.

Raize the bar is a good sized pub located in salt lake. We reached there at around 9Pm on a Friday night and it was full to the brim but we somehow managed to get a table here. 

We ordered for a variety of things such as: 
Stuffed Mushrooms - even though this may sound mundane, the presentation was key in this case as the mushrooms were kept atop a flask which had Thai sweet chilli sauce in it to accompany the mushroom, it was cheesy and the sauce gave it the kick and balance that it needed, a great dish overall.
Cigar Rolls - We ordered the cigar rolls which were cheesy and even had cottage cheese in it as well, it was accompanied by a cheesy sauce as well which made it absolutely great, another great dish.
RTB pizza - This was, hands down, one of the better pizzas I've had in the city, it had sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, garlic chips and sour cream. It was so tasty, we ended up ordering 2 of the same pizzas.

Overall a great experience with no complaints from service or quality of food. There are huge expectations from this place after seeing that they plan to open a full scale brewery down there. Cannot wait for that to open up.

Pros- ambience, music, service

we ordered vegetarian kabab platter and french fries. The kabab platter was good containing aloo kabab, baby corn, brocolli, paneer tikka, two kabab seekh (all in quantity of 3-4) with two types of sauces; enough for 2 people. 

Good place to hangout with your gang. Loud volume, mostly played hindi tracks. Have a big screen so we didn't miss out on our Ind vs NZ ODI match. Service is good.

Another new pub in the Sector 5 of Kolkata, this place is quite refreshing among all of them. Already been here thrice in last 1 month and the loved each outing. Situated near Clge more, the signboard outside is quite eye catching.
About the food, almost all of them are delicious. The Chello kebab platter stands out of them. Other dishes like Fish Orly, Chicken Drumsticks, Mixed Meat Platter, Fish n Chips are also pretty good. Shisha can be availed while Drinks have been started recently.
However despite being a Microbrewery, they still have not started dishing out fresh Beer which is a shame (We all so very want it badly). Hope they can start it soon and will be looking forward to it.
The ambience and the service is nice, but the Music is sometimes too loud to have a normal conversation with friends!
Hope they keep it up and I will be back here soon :)

Came to this particular place late night around 8 pm with some of my friends. Have been hearing the name of this place from quite a long time. Located at Salt Lake Sector 5 area in a very cool and calm location where you don't listen a sound but when you get in to this place its all Loud music. 
Ambiance looks pretty dark but it has been interiored really well. They also have alive band facility if i am not mistaken. You find some decent crowd here having drinks and Hukkahs.
Mostly famous for their Cocktails, Mocktails as well as Hukkah. As a non drinker i tried their Mocktails first in forms of Lonely Planet and Antiquity Blue. Both the drinks were very decent and refreshing. Served in the huge glasses. Both the drinks tasted extremely well and same till the last drop.
Then we ordered some of their Starters in forms of Pan Fried Chilli, Fish Orly and Basket of Desi. Pan fried chilli was spot on with the taste, it contained the flvours really well with the semi gravy. Fish Orly was nt too behind with the divine flavour. Bucket of desi was another good pick that everybody liked on the table. 
The sudden visit was really successful enough and i had a good time listening the loud music with the crowd keep coming in.

The best place to party in & around salt lake. Marvellous ambience & fantastic decor. The staff are very cordial, the wooden tables are nice and add to the sheer beauty of the place. The bar is well designed and the televisions are well placed as well.

We ordered the expresso Martini, the lemon mojito & a cranberry breezer, a non veg kebab platter consisting of four types of kebabs in quantity of three and the melting mushrooms. The kebab platter had Sarson Mahi tikka, tandoori prawns, chicken Reshmi kebab and Shashi lamb kebab. The fish was the best I have tasted till now, followed by the lamb and the prawn and chicken. The melting mushrooms was over-hyped IMO but tested fine.

The price is definitely on the steeper side and would wait for their in-house beers once they begin serving. Would definitely recommend a friend.

Another newbie in sector 5. Wonderful ambience. Music was fine. Food was really very good. I had this rice bowl with grilled chicken and pan fried fish. I was surprised since it was in the middle of the pujo. Waiters are so courteous and friendly.
Overall a very nice day I spent there.

Review: Raize The Bar
A short section by section review, focusing on major aspects.

Location - 3.5/5
At Sector 5 Saltlake, near College more, though not very "reachable" from all parts of Kolkata, unless you have your own car, but at a quite neighborhood it is not so difficult to find.

Facilities - 3.5/5
We couldn't find any dedicated parking facility, but not too difficult to find one beyond office hours in that part of Saltlake. Can be a problem during office hours situated close to College more area (one of the busiest area of Sector 5) No entry fees, like most other pubs.

Ambiance - 3.5/5
In case of a bar/ pub it matters the most in my opinion. You well be welcomed by the huge entry with big glowing name by its side, difficult to miss even when one drives by the place. Entering the gate, at the end of stairs you will be attended by a small team, and will be allowed to enter the main area after providing them your details like most standard places. Lighting and interior is good, including many type of sitting arrangements to suit romantic couples to a group of friends, from sports & loud music lovers to the people who wants to have a conversation. Music is a little to loud for a place with no dedicated dance floor. Dedicated smoking zone and good washroom is a plus. Nothing exceptionally good in this front.

Drinks & Food - 3/5
Very standard, though not exactly feels very value for money as per the quantity-vs-price ratio. That said, it is really not a place for "food" at itself, though for having with drinks & hookah those are good. Taste & freshness of the food leaves nothing to complain about. If you are thinking of a quite evening with some friends, and a chat over a few drinks with some eatables, a budget of 1.5k+ per head is advised, unless you limit yourself only to a few beers.

Service - 4/5
The attendants are courteous and ready to help. But in busy hours, they take more time for serving/ repeating drinks than you would like.

Overall - 3.5/5
Standard pub with foods that are targeted mostly for having with the drinks and the hookah, the place will be liked by most of the young people with a good amount to spend, but strictly not for those who will like to end the evening with a proper dinner & some drinks for a reasonable amount of money.

Woah! Someplace has raised the bar for the standard eating joints in Kolkata. 
The collection of cocktails and mocktails is classic. A bit over priced though.
For the food. Hats off to the chef and the team who have worked wonders in the kitchen. The main course is absolutely wonderful, be it teriyaki platter or pasta or khou suey. Same goes for the starters. I didn't like the lebanese platter though. It was bland and not tasty. Crispy corns were perfect in taste. So was the pasta. 
The ambience and the decor is wonderful. A must place to visit. 
P.S. I thoroughly enjoyed the burnt garlic fried rice.

As per its name, this opening has certainly raised the bar for night life in the IT area of the town. The reception is okay but could be warmer.

Food and cocktails are good as well. The ambiance is uber cool as well. 

All in all, another fine place to groove and spend some time with the ones who matter. 🙃

Keep munching.

Ciao! 🍷

New block in the town. More precisely in sector 5. I was searching for good cafe/ restaurant around sector 5. And I suddenly got this raize the bar. So, it was my wishlist from then.

Location:
___________________
it is near college more of sector 5. On the ground floor of godrez water side building.

Ambience and decor: 
__________________________
we visited this place on the lunch time. So we felt the ambience is pretty decent.
And the décor is just superb. The whole bar having a wodden touch with haricane type light. Just amazing.
We pretend that it would be lovely to give a visit at night. But yes they have loud dj and total buzy dance floor at night.

So, if u just want to give adda, spent good time and date good food. Do visit in day time.

Now coming to the main segment food
__________________________________________

Starters:
-----------------
1. Sarsoo mahi tikka: one of the best fish tikka I have ever had. Amazing in taste. Bhetki fish marinated in mustard and yogurt sauce. And they served it with mint chutney. Just owssum.

2. Chicken teriyaki: another owsum. Grilled chicken in teriyaki sauce.

3. Calamari fritoo: air fried squid. This is just amazing. They served it with a sauce and French fries. Owssumm.

Main course:
-------------------------
1. Cilantro rice fresh mix bowl : grilled chicken served with corn, bean , veggies and cilantro rice. Good in taste. 

2. Grilled Kolkata bhetki: grilled 4 pieces of bhetki with tomato and almond chutney and vegetables. Owssum. 

3. Tangra kitchen platter: nothing special about this dish. Chili chicken with rice and vegetables. But the taste and food quality is just superb.

4. Crips skin Atlantic salmon: this is the 1st time I have tasted salmon. And it's very good in taste.
And the orange punch with the fish is just just amazing. 

Beverages:
--------------------------

The have quiet a good option in their mocktail also.

1. Calm down: it is a mix of oolong tea, cucumber and lime. Very flat. Did not like it.

2. Lonely planet: owssumm one. mix of guava, lime grass, reps berry. Amazing in taste.

3. Sangria red: made of red wine and small pieces of fruit. In one one out of the world. Just have it. Its superb.


An amazing experience with good service and owssum and tastey food. Great quantity and quality.

Yes, price is in higher side. Cost 4500 INR for 5.

To the management: keep it up. I was wondering what make the bar having such a amazing rating in zomato. I got my answer. Just maintain the taste , quality and price. :) Cheers....

This place has a nice ambiance and courteous staff. The food is good though not exceptional. However ,the prices for both food and drinks are steeper than other similar lounge bars in the same locality. Hookah prices seemed normal. Another disappointment is that the brewery is yet to be functional. So if you're a fan of those giant draught beer towers, boots and pitchers, be warned..those are yet to roll out. You may try out their cocktail pitchers though.I believe once the brewery starts brewing, this place will start drawing in the thirsty crowds by the dozens.

One of the most spacious pubs/lounges in Saltlake vicinity, located on the ground floor of Godrej Waterside. The interior will remind you of a micro brewery or a pub of Bangalore or Pune. Perfectly illuminated, widespread bar counter, high rise wooden chairs, loud music, young and vibrant crowd; altogether have created a perfect ambience to hang out with your friends and have a relaxing time over a bottle of beer. The food is outstanding here. Generally, pubs don't focus much on the presentation aspect of dishes but this place is an exception.
We had ordered :
#Melting Mushroom - button mushroom stuffed with cheese, served with a tangy dip. The presentation was quite unique, they served it on narrow-neck flasks, mostly found in a chemistry lab.
#BBQ chicken wings - the confluence of the smell of charcoal and BBQ sauce had created a mouth-watering effect.
#Lamb Shish Taouk - basically a falafel kind of dish, made out of minced lamb.
#Chciken Teriyaki - not the traditional kind of teriyaki. Tastes tangy... pieces of chickens are very succulent. A Must try here.
#Green chilly chicken - another highly recommended dish here.
#Chilly cheese toast
#Captain Morgan rum flavoured melting chocolate - must try in dessert
#Fried ice-cream with Caramel and Cointreau sauce - a coating of caramel and cointreau sauce on the scoops of vanilla ice-cream. A delight for ice-cream lover.
The pricing is little bit on the higher side. We, four guys, ate food worth of INR. 5600 but after levying tax, it came up to around INR 7200, which is bit creepy :p .
The restro staffs are very courteous here. Another striking feature of this place is that the serving-dishes are quite unique. They have got their own beer brewing machines which are going to be operative soon.

Well, they indeed have “raised the bar” in terms of food, ambience as well as service in the food business – and that also – quite significantly. I became quite amazed with the ambience once I entered this place – a micro-brewery which serves great food also. I don’t quite often enter pubs, since I don’t have cocktails, no sheesha, no funny business – no nothing……….

You get to see quite a lot of beer being promoted by way of posters and fancy idioms - beer being branded as “healthy”, beer keeping you happy, beer rhyming with cheers! – and what not. And why not so, as they produce their own beer! Mind it, this café based in the Godrej Waterside building, Sector 5, Saltlake could be the next hangout place for beer and hookah freaks.

They do have a small dedicated dance floor – but sadly, this did not find many takers. They provide majorly wooden seating but sofas are also available.

We kick-started with some tasty virgin-mojito brimming with ice cubes – some cold coffee also available, which I did not taste. Man …… they did make the mojito appear sexy – pudina and lemon pieces floating on top and a stylish straw drowned in it. Thereafter, starters started as follows:-

Babycorn – nice and crispy

French fries – okayish (I do not enjoy French fries too much – was tasty nevertheless)

Seekh kabab- very nice, but too spicy

Corn kebab – fine

Aloo kebab – A mediocre 

Phool gobhi kebab – good one!

Chilly paneer – tasty – mind the chilly pieces therein though

Pan pizza – nice to see a “RECTANGLE” (yes you read that right) pizza – topped with jalapenos, capsicum and mozzarella – but a very promising looking item definitely falling way below expectations!

Paneer tikka – Great (mind the huge size)

Mint chutney served along was pretty mediocre – owing to the bits and pieces of uncrushed coriander.

This was followed with some soft drink (Coke served in the name of Thumbs up). It is remarkable that I enjoyed fodder while watching the Olympics on the LCD atop a wall!

Moving to the mains, we started off with Tomato Shorba – crotons included as well as cream atop! Thereafter, Butter roti as well as tandoori and naans were served. Black daal was fascinating and paneer butter masala – sublime, especially when Raita was available. A decent salad range and condiments (cucumber, tomato, onions, yellow carrots, green chilly, lemons) as well as kachumer and papads were served. Corn palak was fine, so was kofta! I did not taste their Chinese items – Chowmein as well as paneer! 

Hyderabadi dum biryani was fine – though not as good as it appeared – had a balanced vegetable content. 

Once filled to the brim, we moved on to the desserts, rasmalai was fine – with great pista, kesar and malai content, but sadly I could have just a single piece of it. I had some chocolate cakes and then ….. dhan te nan …… MONTE CARLO – a simple path to heaven. Had a total 3 servings thereof …… mmmmmmmmmmmm. Who does not love a happy ending?

We finally concluded with some superb mouth freshners.

Service is exceptional and the staff try to satisfy all consumer needs – prices charged being on the higher side. I tag this place as a must visit and highly recommended. 

P.S.:- The hefty parking fees hurt me a lot (120 bucks), but I don’t really blame them as I understand that this is a rental/ leased property.

I also apologize to fellow Zomans that pics are dim owing to dearth of light at the café!

I m really unable to understand who has given them.to run a lounge or restaurant as they are unable to give water to their guest.
They are simply charging Rs 55/- for a 500ml bottle, when asked to give filter water they have a simple reply sir " pani ka taste kharab hae " 
If this is so why they don't supply mineral water free and above all what for the authorities or the so called food inspectors waiting for.

Went to this place late evening to meet an old friend. Very near to the hustle bustle of sector 5 area of salt lake, this place is frequented by office goers.

The brewery for serving fresh draught beer catches the eyes as you enter, but you soon get to know it is still not open. Anyway had the regular fare of Sheesha  and Chilly Paneer Starter. Sheesha was definitely very smooth and starter was fine.

Service was a little slow even though a handful of tables were empty on a Friday night.

Overall a nice addition to the city night life. Would love the Brewery to open soon.

This place is an addition to the few pubs that exist in Calcutta presently. Had been there on a Sunday. It was not much crowded thankfully. Maybe because people still are not much aware of its existence or maybe because commuting from there becomes difficult if you do not have your own vehicle especially at night. 

My friend and I had ordered one beer-a pint of Budweiser and chicken in some spicy sauce( I do not remember the name, was probably some sort of kebab)and a hookah. The chicken was very tasty. The beer was priced like any other expensive pub in Calcutta. The hookah was their special hookah but i did not find any unique  speciality in the hookah. Tasted like a normal 'paanch paan' served in average hookah parlours. 
The ambience was okay. But music was too loud. They are going to start their brewery very soon. So waiting for it. Once a visit is worthwhile.

L & T employees working in the same building get a 10% discount on the food bill.

Had been there last evening to grab a drink after what was a rather hectic 6day week at work. Though this place is there for quite a long time, I mean my last visit here was in April but they weren't yet functional then.
Yesterday my fiance was very happy and eager to try out this place and we were not disappointed. Its a very pumped up place to say the least, good music, great interiors and decor, brilliant food with an equally great service.

Being a Saturday, had to stick to veg, though was wishing was here on any other day after seeing what the menu has in store for all non veg lovers. A pleasure to the taste buds and a plethora of delicacies in Indian, Continental and World cuisine, this place is the place to be if you are looking for great food in sector 5.

Located in the Ground floor of the Godrej Waterside Building, the nearest landmark is college more in Sector 5.
My fiance and I ordered the Tangra Style Chilli Paneer for starters along with a Sangria for the lady and a cool beer for myself. The chilli paneer was really good in quantity and tasted great.

For mains, we ordered the Veg Spaghetti Aglio Olio and The Veg Khaosuey with Japanese Udon Noodles. Once again the food was simply awesome. One of the cities finest Aglio Olio according to Sananya and I believe her coz she has had the dish in almost every place that serves it. The Khaosuey was a visual treat as well as a treat to the tastebuds.

The food was so good that we absolutely had no issues with eating veg 😊😊😊.

The service was fantastic. All in all an experience that makes a mark. Coming back next weekend.

Though the beer hasn't start brewing yet but once it starts there's no looking back. Very creative interiors instantly uplifts your mood and gets you into the mood. They serve alcohol on the weekends so no better place to party now!! A must visit for all if u don't want to miss a too perfect place!!

Another excellent place! Food is delicious. Hookah is of different class altogether! We have our specials made every time we visit  this place. :)Music is super awesome and the ambience is great too! Deducting 0.5 because of the seats. After 2 continuous hours of hookah, we do not really need those high seats to sit up straight. A cozy seating arrangement would be most welcome.To summarize:
Food - 4.5/5Music - 4.5/5Ambience - 4/5 (do not really appreciate that minors are allowed in too even if there is a separate hookah and alcohol free zone)Staff - 5/5 (always happy to help and quiet friendly)Overall strongly recommended :)

I wouldn't even think of going anywhere else. Please keep up the good food. And oh yes the space is hugeeeeee inside. Still a little bit unused. Prices are reasonable. The bill did not give us a shock and yes the parking is a big problem there. Otherwise enjoyed a lot. :)

Located near the ring road in Sector V, Raize the Bar is a nice looking newest kid pub joining the the already overcrowded pub cum restaurant bandwagon. Catering primarily to office goers who drop in to celebrate happy occasions, to the henpecked employees badmouthing the bosses after a hard day at work or employees fuming over some bad co-workers this place provides the ideal foil of good food and drinks at standard pub rates. The food is real good quality which sets this place apart from the other competitors operating in the area. 

Cons- No valet parking available. Parking at Godrej Waterside @ INR 35 per hour burns a hole in the pocket.

The music blares at too loud a pitch thereby being a deterrent to have conversations while you sip and eat.

The place and ambience is quite good and sporty. Although drinks couldn't be served because of some license problem of theirs. I ordered 'moroccan cigar rolls' in the appetiser and 'Cilantro rice with fresh mix bowl' in the main course with 'Chicken Teriyaki'. In the desert had fried ice-cream with caramel crust and cointreau sauce. Enjoyed the meal to the fullest but didn't quite like 'Chicken Teriyaki' dish as it was too much toasted with the Japanese sauce.

The only thing i don't appreciate, this place allows minors too... Small kids with adults.. This should not happen when a restaurant does not have a non-hookah sitting arrangements.

Just loved this new addition in sector 5.This place covers a large space  and has a seating capicity of around 70-80 people.As you open the wooden gate you would be awestruck by the interiors of this cafe .Along with great interiors this cafe has a very calm ambiance.The service they provide is also excellent.Though there was a little delay in serving the dish but the staff was very friendly.And the way they serve the food will force you to fall in love with their dishes.Now coming to the food,We had several items but the best was-
1.Palak aur Anardana tikki
2.Fried icecream with caramel
3.Lebanese platter

So one evening after fighting a horrendous traffic me and a friend reached this place. The entry and the seating arrangement is impressive. The ambience was really good and the usherer had a smile on her face. 

Since it's a micro-brewery we expected to be treated to some tasters before we zeroed in on our drinks. After a twenty mins wait the manager comes to us and informs us that they don't yet have the licence in place for the micro-brewery!!! He further added we could try out the other liquor and food...It's like visiting a hospital only to be told that they don't have any doctors yet, however; we could try our their canteen instead! 

A simple warning notice at the entrance should suffice to inform the patrons in advance. What a shame. My request to the management is to take care of this, though they might not pay heed...

Wow what a place!!! Theme is awesome too good ambience. Music was good.. Everything is spectacular about this place. The mocktails are just too good. Food was absolutely delicious. Hookah was perfect with good and smooth smoke. Enjoyed a lot over there. Food presentation was spectacular. Only let down is alcohol hasn't started yet. I hope they bring it soon. Looking forward to visit as soon as possible after the bar gets opened.

Just loved the place. I was there on frndship day so the place was full n they were giving as frndship band as we enterd. Good ambiance amzaing music n we all dance liked anything. Good hookah. Food is really amazing. We orderd asparagus n cheese rissoto n pizza. Both were amzing. The prices are bit on higher side but a place worth going with frnds to chill out. A very nice n good new place in sector 5 which is  gaining popularity. A must visit.

I just loved this new addition in Sector v area.  The wooden door opens up to a spacious lounge area. The well lit bar counter has a peppy feeling to it. The sad part being that the counter is decorated with mock tail bottles instead of alcohol. The wooden work decor adds to the look of the place. As you enter there is this round table with colourful chairs which I heart so much.  Then there is the other area which gives you a cabana type of feeling... Apt for trying sheesha with friends. The dj console and the large speakers are a wow factor. The Bob Marley image on the wall is a high in itself. The microbrewery part looks so dead as of now...  I so wish they start it at the earliest. We tried assorted vegetables fry and kalamari fry along with French fries.  I liked the way both the items were presented.  We were also offered three different types of mock tails... All of them were very refreshing for the thirsty souls.  The tiramisu at the end was an icing on the cake.  The staff is well behaved and had knowledge about each and every item on the menu. Would love to go to this place often. The pricing is reasonable as of now so if you are a foodie and an aficionado of hookah please visit and experience Raize the Bar.

They really need to raise their bar. We ordered a chicken terriyaki, tandoori pomfret, chicken kebab, hyderabadi platter, kolkata biryani. Though everything served was delicious, but the quantity was very less. The parathas were smaller then the size of a poori. We had consulted the waiters if this much was enough for five people. But unfornunately they could not suggest us properly.

After reading such good reviews, was really disappointed with the ambience. There was a dj in the house but still the music was like some ordinary background songs. Nobody dancing. Thought it to be fun place to hangout, but it turned out to be just a place for dinner. Hoping to have a better experience there the next time i visit the place.

The place is excellent to throw parties and to hangout with friends. Spacious and perfctly designed , it gives you a feeling of a proper pub (though they have'nt got the bar licence which is expected to be cleared soon). I was at the place with my friends, food is quite remarkble in taste specially gellati kebabs with kesari dahi amd chilly paneer , though quantity is'nt that food but fairly okay. Do not miss their OREO Choclate Shake ,its a pure delicacy.

"Raize the Bar" is Kolkata's newest offering. The place is spread across a huge space. They have their own brewery which will start operating in the next two months. The interior is beautiful, a lot of thought has gone into it. The place was quite full for a weekday lunch. They are famous for their square pizzas. The pizza was quite filling for the price they charged. Their another best item to order would be their fried ice-cream. Where a lot of big brands fail, these guys excel on this! Waiting for the brewery to start, will come back for more!! :)

I went there yesterday and I have to say that it is a brilliant place. The music was a little too loud for anyone who wants to sit and talk. We had to raise our voice to hear each other but the ambiance is electrifying. 
The food in particular was delectable and the service couldn't have been any more better. This place has been nicely done and was packed. We sat towards the interior which was vacant and had a romantic aura to it. 
Would definitely be visiting again.

Its a nice one. The woody interiors are great. Ain't got the liquor license yet, so the microbrewery is still virgin. They do nice hookahs. Pinch in pocket is 3.5 on scale of 5. And they don't add service charge on your final bill. Attentive staff. Food tastes good. Could have increased the portions of cocktails. Nice thin crust pizzas. Nice hangout place for techies.

Recently opened brew pub surprised me totally with its classy and catchy ambience. 
Interiors is nicely done and management is extremely good. Not all sections are operative yet but I liked their concept overall. 
Loads of items are there on the menu worth ordering. 
Tried Melting Mushroom which I liked to the core. A lil pricey considering the quantity. However,the presentation and method of preparing it compensated the cost. Along with the mushroom was a syrup which went really well with it and a bit of veggies. 
Next we ordered was Asparagus and Cheese Risotto and it was simply heaven. I still can't get over with the taste. Got it customized by asking them to add mushrooms which intensified the taste all the more.
Would like to try more of its dishes as I was really happy with the food. Coming back soon.

Visited a week back with office colleagues on a working Saturday. The place was pretty crowded considering it was a Saturday .  The interiors are awesome ,the music was a bit too loud for my liking ,but a lot of people might like it. Overall ambience was good. Some of the seats do not have a back-support so might be a problem for some like me,who prefer back support in their chairs.

Overall Ambience :4/5

Now coming to food and drinks ,it was a mixed experience. The presentation of all the food and drinks items 
Chicken Teriyaki : Was very good.The chicken was tender and the preparation was yummy
Watermelon and Feta Cheese: Was disappointed terribly with this, It was basically a few balls of watermelon. The cheese was barely present and was very disappointed  with this.
Mocktails : The place is yet to get its alcohol license. The mock-tails that we ordered  were 
Na Real Pani: As the name suggests was just coconut water presented in a container shaped like a coconut.
Lonely Planet: Loved this drink. Would definitely recommend to others

Food and Drinks: 3/5
 
  Would recommend fellow foodies to give it a try

After getting awesome reviews from so many people, I thought, I should visit this place and so, we planned a team lunch together in this place on a rainy Friday. My experience was beyond awesome. Food, ambiance, Service - everything was perfect. Location of this joint is inside Godrej Waterside Complex, walkable distance from  College More. After entering into the place, what I first saw is, numerous mini breweries are standing side by side. Unfortunately they didn't get licence for liquor yet, so for that, we have a wait a bit. Sitting arrangements are on the right side. It was bit dark inside,but enough to see menu cards. 
We were six people and we order 2 plates of non veg platter as starter and  Ami Kolkata, Kungpao Chicken Platter and A Trip to Phuket - one plate each as main course. Portion of each plate is quite good. Enough for 2 people. The best order was desert. We ordered 2 plates of Fried Ice Cream and believe me, it was just awesome. Each and every dish was delicious and the waiters eagerly helped us in selecting menus. Though our orders were not served very quickly, but it was  worthy to wait for those tasty mouth watering dishes. Bill was on around 4000. So price wise, it is bit in higher side, but again, you won't regret in spending money here.
Overall, it was an amazing experience for me as well as, for my colleagues. I would highly recommend this place to those foodies, who what to taste different types of foods. This place is worth a visit.

Date of Visit : 13/06/2016

Location : Located in sector v, saltlake inside the Godrej Waterside complex.

Ambiance : Ambiance is good. As you enter the place you see a big bar. Though it is yet to get the bar licence. On the right is seating arrangement. On left there is a place for private party. Wooden long chairs and tables gives you a different experience. Though the music was very loud but loved the music too.

Service : Service was prompt. They also helped in choosing the best dishes of the menu according to our taste.

Foods Ordered & Description :

Soup---->
Cream of Broccoli - The soup tasted group. Few chunks of broccoli enhanced the taste. It was served with garlic bread.

Starters---->
Melting Mushroom - Heard very good reviews about this. So ordered this on the first go. It came resting on chemical flasks which had tangy and sweet chilli sauce.  It tasted average to me. I have had better mushrooms items than this.
Vegetarian Kebab Platter - The platter contains Paneer Tikka, Bharwan aloo, hara bhara kebab & assorted tandoor vegetables like mushroom & babycorn accomplained with mint chutney, sour cream, papad and onions. Loved the platter. Bharwan aloo was the star. It was yummy.

Main Course---->
Desi Khana 2 - This combo contains dal makhani, malai kofta, chana masala and masala kulcha with papad, achaar and salad. This is good combo to try for those who are wiling to try Indian foods there. I dnt like chana masala that much but other items were good.
Wall of China - This combo contains chilly garlic noodles with stir fried vegetables and paneer sichuan. This combo is a must at this place. Awesome taste and varieties in the combo.
Veg Teriyaki Platter - Burnt Garlic Coriander Fried Rice with Green Asparagus, sesame teriyaki potatoes, babycorn, onion and tofu. This is a deadly combo. Yummicious items. A must try for those want to try something different.

Mocktails---->
Oreo Oatmeal Shake , Lonely Planet & Vir-Gin-Sing - All the 3 drinks tasted awesome and refreshing. Standing out was Vir-Gin-Sing. never had such lovely mocktails ever.

Overall, an amazing experience. It a must try place for the varieties they offer. Presentation is also excellent. You cnt be disappointed coming to this place. Highly recommended.

Seen a lot of reviews about this place on Zomato so decided to night out last Friday. We were in a group. The place is located in Godrej Waterside and can be easily reached. Once inside the ambiance is differently good with nice seating arrangement, albeit not crowded. We were given complimentary mocktails which was provided in really small glasses. Better glass size should have been there. The other ordered mocktails were provided in descent size glasses and were amazing. The hookah was well made, smooth. The starters cigar roll, mushroom were nicely served but the quantity was bit less. However the presentation madeup for the quantity. Coming to the main course items like Spaghetti, Risotto & North Indian - they were nicely prepared and tasted well but were again a tad low on quantity. Soft drinks were not served despite order until we completed our dinner and asked for serving them. Overall a good experience, except the fact that the quantity did not commensurate the price so this place is on the expensive side. They might get better once they get their brewery rolling. Most importantly DJ plays generation old English songs when latest ongoing hits/remixes ought to be played.

Nice posh place at the Godrej water side of sector 5.Easy to locate. A huge sitting area  Specialised in continental food menus.Neglible North Indian cuisines available.
Order- special meat platter,which came with a very delicious look.They claim that its sufficient for 2 people but i personally dint feel so.American Salmon was tasty but the fish itself had come in very small piece.
Value for money is.less.Taxes are as high as 25 percent.
Service- very good They will invite you cordially and the food is served pretty fast.
They also have a large microbrewery ready but are not able to start as they have no liquor license yet.They promised that they will start it soon within a month.
Decor is so-so

So we just had our dinner the Pad thai and basil chicken was nice, hukka was good.
I am not a dessert person my buddy told the pannacotta was too good.
not for boozing right now but a great ambiance and decor for partying once the place have licence.
meanwhile its good food at good price place.

Amazing experience at Raize the bar! It is one of the most upcoming and coolest places to be at. From a mind boggling ambience, to the explicitly luxurious and large variety of their global cuisine, to the aptly romantic dim lights,this place is absolutely worth it all.We were taken aback at the very grand gigantic entrance of this supercool bar cum brewery which is all set to blow your minds away. Not to forget the qwerky,personalised interiors and ofcourse the warmth and genuine hospitality of the staff will force you to revisit this place again and again and again! I genuinely recommend this place to everyone who wants to experience nothing but THE best coz I bet you oughtta fall in love with the place which has taken my expectations from other places to a complete next level.

Loved it! Oh God, how badly I wish the bar to open soon. Visited this joint for a team lunch on a Thursday… and it was a fantastic experience.

Every dish was mouth-watering… with clear winners being Oregano Crusted Chicken, Mixed Meat Platter and Fried Icecream. The ambience of the place also added to the extravaganza.

The only downside (and the reason for deducting 0.5 points) happened when they forgot to give the squid and the bok choy rice along with the Mixed Seafood platter. We had to ask for it in order to be served separately (but by that time, we had already finished the platter).

Hopefully, this place will receive a lot o limelight once the bar opens next month. And once that happens, I'll be one of the firsts to revisit and have a blast.

Raize the bar is a pub located in sector V in Godrej waterside. Place is a micro brewery but they haven't got their license yet. Ambience is good with loud music and LCDs for sports lovers. Though I am not a Hookah fan but they do have Have a great selection to choose from. We ordered garlic bread, pasta, pizza and some non-alcoholic drinks. Garlic bread is good but pasta and pizza are both very ordinary. Service is quick. Portions are quite small and place is quite pricey. Lack of alcohol makes the place less preferred.

A newly opened food joint comes with good food with all new brewing pub concept. We used to get an average food in almost all kind of great pub but believe me the food they served is awesome in taste.
Ambience wise it j's very simple and eye catching but only prob is that they played the music in very high volume but it may be liked by others.
They decorate the place with very simple manner but full of positive vibes.
Now lets come into the main show...the food...yeah taste awesome and the service e time from KOT placing to serve on plate time is also good.
We have ordered Green chilli chicken.. Yes taste very good as well as presentation.. Chicken are well cooked but again they didn't lose the juicy flavour inside...ordered bar-b-q chicken wings with perfect combination of bar-b-q sauce ans taste yumyyyyyyyyyy...I would also like the non veg platter... Overall a great ambience with with great experience... Little bit costly in side but no matter if you are 
getting a good food with quality service and awesone ambience...I hope management has already started more promo as the location is not in the middle of sec v...great effort will like to visit soon..

Located at Godrej waterside building.

 This new pub style themed place is a class-apart .

 The decor is pretty simple yet touching.  

 The food has really raised the bar with its variety and taste. 

You could start up with the melting mushrooms or the oregano chicken tikka or the Morrocan cigar roll, I must say a lot of emphasis has been made on the presentation and quality of food.

The Lobster thermidor is simply out of the world.

Desserts and drinks(though only non-alcoholic, as they haven’t got the license yet) are worth the try. Molten Chocolate Cake an overall favourite. 

 The staff is courteous, well trained and polite, will guide you through the menu well. 

 Pros - Location, ambience, Food Quality and Quantity, Courteous staff, Quick service. 

 Cons – On weekends reservation must otherwise you may not get a seat

A great place in the making! Sadly they are unable to start the brewery as they don't have the liquor license yet. Hookah lovers can try this place as well. I can review regarding the food only. It was quite promising with good quantity and palatable as well.The starters barbeque chicken,lime soda were up to the mark. The meal was quite sumptuous with the kukkad sukkad as well.The dal makhani and chicken dish were exquisite.I wish to visit this place soon. I am quite confident that they will snatch a rating of 5 from me next time when they are at full bloom with the microbrewery open.
@raizethebar Start it soon folks!

This newly opened and one of the coolest pub cum brewing station at sector 5 , impressed us on its first look itself.. occupying a gigantic space on the first floor of godrej waterside building with masculine wooden finishing and a glass pane giving a view outside , peppy numbers and shisha ( for now they donot have the liquor license) along with brilliantly cooked food.
I ordered for four dishes and genuinely recommend them all..
THE MELTING MUSHROOMS is an usp starter of this place coming with cheesy mushrooms on top of a small conical beaker with a red tangy dip.. which makes an outburst of flavours when taken together. Just that for 6 small single bite sized mushroom priced at 225++ is tad too high.
the OREGANO CRUSTED CHICKEN TIKKA was so juicy and moist tasted similar to malai kebabs ,could find no oregano gel flavour though , however it tasted amazing with the green chutney.
CHICKEN SALTEMBOCCA had three roundish breaded chicken stuffed with cheese and veggies probably , on an bed of potato mash , sided by satueed vegetables and topped with cream sauce.. good for people who avoid spices and oily food.
And the lastly the MEATY PIZZA was the showstopper of all.. perfectly baked thin crust rectangular pizza topped with minced meat, chicken sausages and great amount mozarella couldnot stop us gulping those 8 pieces within minutes. I am really satisfied with the staff service and the food as described was ridiculously overwhelming .
Hope to sit with beer mugs soon!

Amidst the hustle bustle of the IT City, this new microbrewery attracted my eyes quite a few times as it near my office and has a surprisingly refreshing ambience.

Though it was disappointing to know that they don’t have alcohol license yet, we were in a group of 6 and were sad about it, but hat’s off to the great service, mock-tails and superb food with courteous management team we felt as if at home .There was live screening of IPL match going on and the music was great. Late evening after change of light the place became mesmerizing.

We really enjoyed the gig and waiting eagerly to go there next week again. A big thumps up!! For Raize The Bar

The exterior looks so fab that you would love to have food out here. The taste and the price of food items goes hand in hand. The ambience too is excellent. We had ordred the kolkata chello kabab - that although doesn't taste as good as the one at Peter Cat but the preparation is quite good. The ambience was good and the behaviour of the staff was amiable. The only reason of me giving it 4 points is that the size of its tables - it is not at par to the normal table size. If you have kept your plate out there and a dish comes there's hardly any place to keep the same.

Was meaning to try out this place for a long time. Went there last night. Impressive Décor. I was really excited by the wide array in the menu. The RTB pizza is a must have and so is the Cheese Garlic Bread. The adventurous foodies can try the Khao Suey. Hookah too was pretty good. The Cold Coffee however was a little too sweet for the liking.

The best part was that the staff was extremely cooperative and friendly. They even made a shout out to my friend whose birthday we were celebrating. All in all a pretty good experience.

After an awful expereience, I drove to Raize the bar on another Sunday. Luckily they did not disappoint me this time. Mr.Suman the chef there took care of us making it a good experience. We had a melting mushrooms which was good, served very well and tasted tum too. The green chilly chicken was too good, the chicken was soft, the coating was perfect and tasted too good. The hookah we called for was decent too, not one of the best I've had though. The service was quick. The servers kept an eye on all tables always which was a pretty good thing :) best of luck Raize the bar :)

Location is nice 
The first thing you see when you reach there is the big glow sign boards and huge staircase and glimpse of the micro-brewery !
It's very Royal and sophisticated entry set up.
Once you're inside the lounge, the ambience is very very good !
Lot of space to walk around and looks comfortable and cozy.
Theme is nice, music, lighting and seating all are good, lot of segregated areas too.
There's also a no smoke/Sheesha cozy lounge comprising of comfortable dining space.
Music is really good, no Bollywood numbers as of now :(
Staff is courteous and service is prompt.
Sheesha is decent.
FOOD !! Now this is highlight !
Food is brilliant !
More than that the presentation is just very nice !
Lebanese, Italian, Chinese, Indian all four are equally good !
And mocktails are nice.

Not serving Alchohol as of now, soon they claim to start.

Highly recommended !

Located in sector - v, inside the newly build Godrej waterside complex. Extravagant place, amazing decor, excellent service. Parking is a problem. It's still a restaurant only as the liquor license had not been obtained yet. Food was very innovative, and the presentation was very creative. Quantity for starters were less. Quality of the food was hygiene. Divided in three sections, there is also a private party section. We had ordered Melting Mushrooms, Morroccan cigar roll, Makai malai soya ki champ in starters. And calm down in mocktail.

Parking can be a problem as the road outside is a no parking zone. Ask for availing discounts with your company's id card. Green chilli chicken was nice in particular. As of now they don't have license to sell liquor.

Another pub added to Sector 5 Area.. The only n in fact the main n huge difference is that its own Micro Brewery which is it's USP.. Regards the cuisine, Cigars rolls are a must try.. Quantity of the food can be improved.. Regards Indian food lovers they might be disappointed with the Indian platter as thou the taste fine but it's not even sufficient for a single person n def not worth the amt they charging for it.. Rest def one can try this place as it's a happening addition to the city..

A really extravagant place near Collage More. As soon as you enter you'll find the place quite welcoming. 
We ordered the Veg Manchow and Mushroom Cappuccino. Both were really quite good. The mushroom soup was really creamy. 
We then ordered Veg kebab platter, pizza rtb and another pizza. The Pizzas were great. Perfect thin crust pizza with very nice amount of cheese with pesto and goat cheese. I found it amazing.
We also ordered Risotto and nachos. Both were quite good. 
Overall everything we ordered was quite good. And I found the place really nice. Though I would suggest they should have a non smoking area.
It is a little on the pricey side. Though their pizza is worth it.

Ok. So finally made it to this place..to start with they dont have parking in the building (atleast thats what the building security told me)
So parked my car in the no parking zone :)

Place looks great...shud do gr8 once the liquor licence comes in.

Swanky items in the menu. loads of choices..but then how much can one eat ? ;)

Music was loud..in the afternoon (especially for the 2 occupied tables) had to request management to lower the volume,which they did ,promptly :)
Ordered the "cilantro  mix bowl"..it was refreshingly nice and ofcourse healthy :)
Overall good place..
Good service
Lovely ambience
Great location

Will do well..:)

I'm sure you must have noticed the pleasant changes and developments in terms of food and experience in our city. Food trucks, kiosks, gastronomical pubs, innovative desserts and more. What was missing was a microbrewery, brewing up local beer crafted fresh!

LOCATION & AMBIANCE-
Located in sec v inside the newly build Godrej Waterside complex, Raize the bar is a complete eye pleasing place.
Divided between four sections namely the seating area overlooking the brew machines, DJ console area and a dining section and a sprawling bar, this place feels complete.
Though here is the disappointment part. They are still figuring out the liquor license bit, but assured me it will be done in the first week of june.
The ambiance is amazing, love the cartboxes on the ceiling, the barrels that work as tables, the Bob Marley poster, the pop of colors with metal chairs and stools.

FOOD-
We went for appetizers, mocktails and main course. Here goes my experience!
• Basket of assorted fries- it came with French fries, onion rings, veg nuggets and potato wedges with a delicious garlicky dip. The fries were seasoned well and had the perfect crunch and flavour.
• Lebanese Platter which was presented well and was absolutely a wonderful dish to order #recommeded. Standouts were the cheese raraq which was gooey and stringy, the saffron dip which was killer ans the muhmurra which was tangy and garlicy.
• Melting Mushrooms were one of their recommendations and I am glad I ordered them. One of the best mushrooms I have had in a long time! They came resting on chemical flasks which housed their house made tangy and sweet chilli sauce. An absolute delight in the mouth, this one #recommended
• Na Real which came in a dried coconut. It had flavoura of coconut, coriander and jeera. Tasted amazing #recommended
• Virgin Madras which had a madras twist with curry Patra to the usual tropical flavour
• Bannofee which was a blend of toffee and banana flavour. It was just about okay
• For main course we tried their Biriyani which was prepared in dum style. It was served with curd and tasted very good.

SERVICE-
Was indeed very good and I was impressed with their attention to detail.

PRICING-
Considering the wonderful experience in terms of ambiance, food and service, the prices are justified and we paid a total of 1750 for our afternoon .

My best wishes to the entire team and I am definitely visiting again once the booze is on!
Cheers!

It's still a restaurant only as the liquor license hasn't been obtained, although the ambience is spot on of a typical brew pub
The garlic Chilli chicken appetizer was as juicy as it gets. The mains however was a mixed reaction. We ordered chicken saltembocca, grilled bhetki and lobster Thermidor. While the chicken had nothing more to wish for, the bhetki was ok ish and Thermidor was way too salty. .overall the food is better than most pubs but leaves a lot of room for desire as a restaurant

Raize the bar has raised the standard of the sector 5 itself! I bet, the moment you enter this place, it will get a smile on your face. Amazing decor. And to be mentioned specially, waiters are not dumb. They get things at once. Good food. We had ordered for a veg platter. It was sufficient for two people. Combos are pocket friendly. Sisha is nice. And and and, they ll get there alchohol license shortly,so the place has its own breweryy tooo!!! In short the place is must a visit.

Raize the bar- Kolkata’s new jewel- A microbrewery yet to brew it's beer

Food- A wonderful gastronomic experience which satisfies all the senses... Raize the bar has kept its menu very simple and has stuck to the original recipies,even the dishes in which they have innovated the flavours are quiet strong and there is no clash of the same,  and a unique dining experience.

Service-The service is great and the ambience suffices.

Will visit soon to try out the rest of the menu.waiting for the brewed beer eagerly.

Amazing and cool place
to hang out. Out of all the dishes ordered by us, (3 occasions
already) all were made differently and a must try. I especially would recommend
the Rangoon noodles for all Thai food lovers and the Melting mushrooms
which amazingly also impressed the non-mushroom eaters too....The staff was
courteous and there was no issues with service as such. Hookah was good too.

With the brewery on, I’m
sure this place is alwazzz gonna stay packed.

This place is located pretty close to Sector 5 College More. Unlike its name and the visible brewery, the place has still not acquired it's license so no alcohol is available which is very disappointing and shocking. I went there with a friend and when asked for a table for two the female attendant initially took us to a seat that was squeezed between 2 with large loud groups. We asked them for an alternative to which she reluctantly took us to a seat for 5 and even said she'll ask us to sit at the bar stools once the crowd starts coming. This is honestly very bad service specially considering there were hardly any people then. Our displeasure was fairly evident since thereafter 2 much more amicable attendants attended to us.
We ordered as below:
Bull Berry-this could easily pass as strawberry shake
Foamed Green Apple Iced Team-the foam was unavailable
Moroccan Cigar Rolls- Highly recommended
Vegetable Platter-Pretty average

The Moroccan Cigar Rolls were amazing and it along with the male attendants are the sole factors behind the 3.5 rating. Otherwise this place had disappointed us abit
Hope you guys take note and grow better

Saw a lot of buzz about this place. Unfortunately for us the bar had not started yet. They will get the liquor license next month. So the huge brewed beer tanks stare at you from the glass door.
Located at College More Waterside building. A big bar with with a huge offering on the menu, food wise. Did not try any mocktails so won't be able to comment on them. 
The plating is done beautifully and pricing is good. 
We ordered a paan flavoured hookah which gave a bitter aftertaste plus I am not a hookah lover. 
First came the calamari Fritto. It was served with a kafir lime sauce and French fries on the side. The calamaris were fried with a poppy seed covering. The covering lacked seasoning but it went well with the dip. 
The oregano crusted chicken kebab was very soft and juicy. Definitely recommended but it had no oregano flavour whatsoever. It was more of reshmi kebab. The meaty pizza was rectangular in shape with cheese loaded on top. But the chicken and meat was very less. It looked as if it was sprinkled on top or given just for the sake of it. Naming a dish meaty pizza and giving so less doesn't justify it. The taste was good.

Raize the bar has definitely raised the party standards of kolkata....i was visiting Kolkata after 8 months and RTB was a pleasant surprise...the gastronomical pleasure of Melting Mushrooms, Na Real and the Chinese box were all too good for my taste buds...even the indian platters are must try...what i was truly impressed was the awesome decor...the place is divided in 3 sections and all 3 have a different feel which surprisingly gel well with each other....The decent mix of EDM,rock and bollywood pumps you up for a great evening....overall its a place to visit not just once....great experience...all this when their USP is not even operational...eagerly waiting for the brewery to get my spirits higher...

A grin took over my face the moment we stepped in..Spellbinding, hypnotic and mesmerised!! The ambiance is extremely mellow.. We settled in, and prepared ourselves for some exquisite gastronomical venture.. We ordered melty mushroom with chef's special tangy sauce- the presentation was resplendent .. The button mushrooms stuffed with cheese and when dipped in that sweet tangy spicy sauce it is indeed a beautiful experience.. 
We were recommended oreo oatmeat shake- and it is one of the best oreo shakes i ever had.. The texture was so right, not too sweet and heavy.. But light with that beautiful hint of oreo.. 
Then we had AMI KOLKATA- that is chelo kebab.. Well honestly we were not disappointed, it is definitely better than peter cat's.. The quantity was sumptuous!! Only one recommendation maybe they can ask before serving the sunny side up, because I personally prefer my eggs well done!! 
Rtb pizza- the pizza base was pesto sauce.. I am an ardent lover of thin crust pizza!! And i did enjoy binging.. 
The experience wouldn't have been so great without the staff.. Extremely affable..😊
Overall, it was a repleting experience visiting the place.. Raize the bar has undoubtedly raised the gourmet experience of foodies residing in city of joy..

Superb food. Each and every item is lip smacking. The indian platter named kukkar sukkar is amazing...the amount of rice is extremely less bt the dal makhani is best in town, and chicken tikka masala is too good. Only the quantity of rice they serve is very very less compared to other dishes. I have tried all items and all taste equally good. The chelo kabab, Indonesian gem is too good. The Chinese platter with chili chicken a d rice is awesome. Only the biriyani I disliked...it has dalda and the rice becomes sticky before completing. Anyhow the 95% dishes are superb. The taste is best in this sector v area..the interior and decorations are superb..the staffs are polite and well behaved. A must visit and regular visit for the sector v techies..
Update: Trip to phuket is a wonderful item with flat noodle and chicken. Very tasty. The Cilantro rice is an awesome preparation. The main disappointment was that Lately I had the kukkad sukkad..the quantity of rice they increased sufficiently, but the taste was horrible. In fact the chicken was smelling bad and the dal makhani was Blant with no taste. I am really disappointed as last time it was 5/5 and this time 1/5. I hope they maintain the previous quality and taste as it was. The fresh lime soda is too bad. I am reducing 0.5 rating for the not so good food I had in the last visit.

Visited on 13th May!

This place was bookmarked since a long time, for two reasons, namely, the ambience and the fact that, it is amongst the few Microbreweries in Kolkata. (although they aren't serving liquor right now)

Location : In sector 5. In the lane next to The Institute of Engineering and Management. Right opposite to the PWC building. The name of the place is distinctly visible as you pass by, which gives you a feeling that it's a big, very expensive place!

Interiors and Service : Mind blowing wooden interiors. Very airy and spacious, the place. Plus one!
The staff is attentive and cordial, but slow.

Food and Hookah : I had ordered for Melting Mushrooms. They were amazingly tasty. It is a must try.
Hookah was well made.

Pocket pinch : It is decently charged. Neither too much nor too less.

The only wait is for the beer brewing to start. This place has the potential of becoming the next big thing in the Salt Lake area.
Visit this place and let your bars be raised! Cheers.

Mushrooms. The one strong reason to visit Raize The Bar, pre-liquor licence, is definitely for its Chinese mushroom preparation in the black pepper sauce and for the mushroom risotto. The guys have done a great job hiring good chefs for the food and the shisha is beyond par. Great work with the ambiance, but those quotes on the walls in the private area - well, whenever you undergo refurbishment, please do let me know for replacements of those images. Quick service, friendly staff, good food and shisha - well, what else does anybody want! Personally, if you stick to two cuisines at the most and experiment within those two, instead of stuffing in what is popular, I guess it'll be much better branding for you guys. Anyhow, great work. And get the liquor license fast!!!

A classic bar with such huge space in that official hub area of Sector V is a very surprising but amazing fact. The décor took my heart away. I have seen very rare places in Kolkata with such décor. The food was nice but what was better was the simplicity of the waiters working there. We ordered a pizza. It took time more than expected time. The waiter came to us and informed us that the chef did some mistake with the order and we can either wait for the new pizza or we can cancel the order. KUDOS to this attitude! I am visiting this place again :)

Nice place with good ambience of a pub . .  
Food was good.

only thing which struck me was the coal change charges "Rs 50 + taxes", Rs 300 + taxes is a pretty dearer charge for hookah and above that a single coal change coming at such a cost is a bit too much. I think they can check on that part. :-)

looking forward to the brewery.

Its a pretty huge cafe with nice and unique ambiance . Menu items were pretty innovative and presentation of there food too is awesome.
Ordered Hazelnut Latte and somehow I was not impressed by its look but the taste was good. Apart from this ordered Lebanese Platter which was too good. Good place to hangout with your friends or on Date.

When you walk into raize the bar it's a like an old countryside pub which definitely has the old world charm.
The microbrewery actually grabs your attention and will be serving six different beers. (Surely a first for the city)
Chicken tikka kabab is something you shouldn't miss here and when a punjabi foodie says that you got to believe it.
A fitting name! :)
This place has literally raised all standards.

Raize the bar- it lives up to its name.
An amazing place to hang out. The decor has been well thought of. From ceiling to the bar, from smoking room to the beer barrel for the bill, all goes well with the theme. 
We ordered melting mushrooms and chilli paneer tangra style, loved the mushrooms and the presentation. 
Good food, good service. Would love to go again.

If you are looking for a brewpub in Salt Lake or rather Kolkata, this is the place to be! The first thing that strikes you as soon as you enter the place is the ambience. The plush wooden interiors with dim dangling lights make the experience unique and you won't feel like leaving the place at all. 

Coming to the food, we started with Melting Mushrooms and Green Chilli Chicken. The mushrooms were served in classy test-tubes and tasted well. The chilli chicken was juicy and I would recommend everyone to try this dish. For main-course, we tried their Indian dishes and all of them had been cooked to perfection. We ended our perfect meal with their rum flavoured melting chocolate which according to me is a must-have. The staff was courteous and helped us in placing the order, recommending their best dishes. All in all, we had a great time all thanks to Raise the Bar!

A very nice concept in Kolkata. Probably one of a kind. I really enjoyed the food here. The Mushrooms were really fresh and almost melted in mouth. Food served was as hot as it should be. Presentation of all items that we ordered was innovative and interesting. Ami Kolkata Chelo kababs were quite a treat. The Chicken in main course was soft, tender and very well cooked.

I am just waiting for those big steel canisters to start their magic...bar license awaiting.

We went to this new restaurant on 30th March, the day it was opened to public and as a matter of fact we were, the very first customers of the restaurant!
The shiny metal beer brewing tanks attracted my attention for a while and I was really excited to get a microbrewery in Sector V. While having a food tour in Bangalore last year, I visited a microbrewery called Big Brewski. The place was so so awesome that I started missing it after I returned to Calcutta.
Raize the Bar is the third (or fourth?) microbrewery in Calcutta, after Beer Republic and Country Roads. While the first two had managed to get their liquor license already, Raize the Bar couldn't. So, when we visited this place, it was only a restaurant, not a microbrewery in true sense.
Being the first customer had its own advantages! Executive Chef Suman offered us free cocktails and also free desserts (Sahi Tukda).
Food: We ordered many dishes ranging from Indian to Chinese and from Conti to Desi. Some of the dishes were really outstanding and some pretty average.
For example, Oregano stuffed chicken tikka which was soft, juicy and very tasty. But the similar chicken kabab in the Chelo Kabab platter was hard, dry and anything but tasty.
On the Chinese side, the green chilly chicken was so awesome that we kept on ordering it one after another, but the Kung Pao chicken in the Chinese platter was no better than any street-side cheap Chinese restaurant.
Their plating and food presentation were quite unique - most of the starters served reminded us of the Chemistry lab. Like the melting mushrooms were served on top of small glass flasks with the the sauce inside. It was nice indeed, more from the visual perspective than taste.
The cocktail was quite refreshing in the summer and the Sahi Tukda was just ok.

Service: All staffs were very cordial and helping but they clearly lacked the professional experience. Then had no clear idea of what's there in the menu, nor they could explain the differences between two similar dishes. Chef Suman had to jump in to save their day. Also, the staffs, who were probably more in number than us, messed up the orders. We were served (and charged for) a dish that we didn't order at all!

Ambiance: Nice and cozy. Good for spending the Friday evening with friends. They have a separate room which you can reserve for private parties for 30-40 people. The retro style light bulbs, the wooden floor and the view of the beer tanks created the mood. But the music they played were at least a decade old. I would recommend an immediate update of their music collection.

Price: Most of the dishes were expensive considering the amount of food served and the category of the restaurant. We had a group of 10 and the total bill was around 6,000. But keep in mind the free cocktail and desserts. If we had to buy those then the bill would have crossed 10k. And the amount of food was not too much or unlimited. So 1k+ per person (excluding any alcoholic beverages) for moderate amount of food in a non-fine-dining restaurant in Sector V was definitely on the costlier side.

Final words: Visit the restaurant for the ambiance, food presentation and some specific dishes. My advice would be, wait until they get their liquor license. Only then you will be able to enjoy the real microbrewery experience, without which Raize the Bar is just another average but expensive restaurant.

Food taste - 3.5/5
Service - 3/5
Price/Value for Money - 3/5
Ambiance and Décor - 4/5

Spent a match evening there. Enjoyed the place far more than the match to be honest. Their bar is not serving alcohol yet but their other concoctions do not fail you. 

Loved their mushrooms and the virgin mojito. The view from one end of the place overlooks a long stretch of road in the IT hub of our city and can actually make you start thinking about the City of Joy. 

There's a graffiti wall on the other end and the beer comics are rather witty. 

Yummy food, brilliant pub ambiance and commendable service !

If you're looking for places where you can relieve stress, have fun, and chill with friends, look no further! Newly opened Raize the Bar – Kolkata's premier micro-brewery is an unassuming hidden gem in Godrej Waterside, Sector 5, Salt Lake. With an enthralling bar which soothes the eye as you enter, the place is set to resonate an Irish pub-like feel. While the brewers are aligned on one side, a warm seating arrangement adorns the other end of the place – with the bar connecting them. The view from near the brewers can make you pensive about the City of Joy and then there are the whimsy wall posters which are sure to make you chuckle as you read on the quirks about all things alcohol.

Step into Raize the Bar and you will see how much emphasis they place on aesthetics. In an ambience reminiscent of the rustic charm of dining in the extreme comfort, it's everything you need after a long week, with its rough-hewn trestle tables and wooden stools, Raize the Bar brings you a molecular gastronomical menu of delicacies cooked by veteran chef Suman Chakraborty.

The menu is a carefully crafted selection of dishes which are best accompanied with beer and cocktails. Their twists and innovative plating of age-old finger food is sure to furnish every foodie's Instagram account and the hospitality is warm, to say the least. While it’s known as a good chill out spot, it is the pure decadence of the dinner menu that makes it perfect for a "Treat Yourself" night. Gather few friends, and expect to get your hands greasy. Be wise and order their amazing dishes to share.

I got invited for an intensive food tasting session which was also a part of ThinkQuisitive campaign. The menu was very selective and they are delicate pick of Executive Chef Suman Chakraborty. In appetizer they dole out Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup and as thirst quenchers they serve Na Real and Virgin Madras mocktails. Starters were; Melting Mushrooms, Chingri Chop, Green Chilly Chicken and Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka. Main course were also amazing, Pizza RTB, Spaghetti Aglioe Olio e Pepperoncino, Strawberry and Mint Risotto and Crisp skin Atlantic salmon. For sweet finale there was Assorted Dessert Platter.

We began with Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup, it was exciting and startling in both texture and flavour combination. It had just the right amount of spice and savour; rich & flavourful crab meat soup with a unique blend of aromatic herbs and cubes of mushroom, you might find yourself gulping it all up before you even realise. Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup was an excellent appetiser of thinly-sliced crab meat, with flavours amplified by mushroom and special herbs.

This place flows with creative juices, both literally and figuratively, as their seasoned mixologists stand ever-ready to cater to every aspect of your mocktail / cocktail needs by customising your drink. In a completely interactive environment, drinks are personalised and crafted according to your mood and current preferences. As these mixologists are so attentive, the whole process leaves you feeling like royalty.

Tired? Try the Na Real mocktail, it’s a simple fresh coconut water mocktail mixed with a shot of shahi jeera and coriander. It's believed to keep you energised for much longer than regular coconut water. The Na Real here scores full marks in flavour and wasn’t overly sweet.

Virgin Madras - a combination of fruit punch with a touch of south India. It will make your thirsty heart thrilled with every sip. Unquestionably try their Virgin Madras for a unique and refreshing thirst-quencher!

A meal here demands that you order the unbelievably fluffy Melting Mushrooms, with chef’s special tangy sauce as your choice of dipping. The crunch of roasted cheesy mushrooms brings this dish to textural perfection, leaving you on a high. For starters, definitely order the Melting Mushrooms with tangy dip — infused with a generous amount of cheese, mushroom lovers will love tucking into this!

The Asparagus, Tofu and Shitake Spring Rolls — long sticks of crispy fried spring rolls cut in half, shaped like nail protectors — was unique (and Instagrammable) but a tad too gimmicky.Nice surprise and it was unbelievably funny. After the first bite, the whole thing just vanished in my mouth.

Be sure to order the Chingri Chop! These bite-sized soft minced shrimp with spices were fried to a perfect crisp — you won't be able to stop popping them into your mouth! Bring a date and start the night by sharing the Chingri Chop with the creamy dips. It was really just endless, so soft yet crunchy and even better being warm.

The Green Chilly Chicken was excellent as well: cooked flawlessly, sliced chicken tossed in coriander & lemon grass and served hot. It was spicy to the nth degree and perfectly toothsome, chicken pieces were juicy and tender. If you love tongue twisting taste, don't miss their Green Chilly Chicken — it's so darn satisfying.

The Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka was a true flavour bomb, a gourmet specialty in which western flavor of oregano gels with the succulent Indian marinade.The Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka was a very well executed piece of charcoal-grilled tikka – charred to perfection, wonderfully tender and packs a punch of flavour along with the accompanying pudina curd dips.

I always search for crusts that seemingly envelope the toppings, the pizzas here were all about that thick, airy, chewy crust. Yet somehow, its center was thin and topped with fresh, high quality ingredients and if you like unique toppings, you're at the right place. Go with a hearty appetite because you won't want to miss the Pizza RTB, umami-rich goat cheese and herby base, garlic chips and pesto, with sun-dried tomato to cut through the richness — perfect for vegetarians. The crust here was moderately thin, charred in all the right spots, and chewier than you'd expect — but not in a bad way.

The Spaghetti was just fantastic — seemingly pastoral, yet elegant in execution. Go for the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio E Pepperoncino, an exceptionally done prawn spaghetti with a light tomato, garlic, olive oil, chili flakes, rocket leaves and seafood stock base that imparts a ton of flavour without being heavy. The Spaghetti Aglio was another must-order you should share, prawn spaghetti packed with prawn that will bring you right to the ocean. The Spaghetti here will leave you begging for more.

Dig through the strawberry to find a bed of Strawberry and Mint Risotto, creamy with cheese and peppered with sweet and sour pieces of strawberry and fresh mint leaves. Strawberry and Mint Risotto - combines the exotic flavour of fresh mint leaves with the familiar texture and sweetness of strawberry, could easily draw crowds of Risotto lovers. It was as comforting as it is pretty, but as it tends to get a bit rich, you might want to share this with a friend.

Now, dig in to the final main course — Crisp Skin Atlantic Salmon served with orange panache. Indulgent, rich, and slightly creamy from the uni, the flavours of the Atlantic Ocean will explode in your mouth. The crisp skin Atlantic salmon was definitely not to be missed– think perfectly cooked fish filet with olive oil and topped salt flakes, served with potatoes and salad leaves. If you feel like something light for lunch, try out their crisp skin Atlantic salmon, a gorgeous version of a slow cooked salmon that makes you feel like a queen/king.

Leave stomach space for their Legendary Assorted Dessert Platter, which was worth every calorie. First, try the Kahlua Flavoured Mascarpone Cheese Cake— the unconventional pairing works because of the natural sweetness of the Mascarpone Cheese. The Citrus Panna Cotta with Mixed Berry Coulis, served with freshly squeezed lemon juice and raspberry-orange sauce, makes an excellent dessert, especially when paired with a glass of the Na Real. The coconut water cuts through the mix berry's acidity while adding a hint of natural sweetness. For sweet finale, go for the Captain Morgan Rum flavoured Melting Chocolate; prepared tableside, the sweet, buttery, citrusy and slightly boozy treat was guaranteed to tickle your taste buds!

The food speaks for itself, and it’s no surprise with acclaimed celebrity Chef Suman Chakraborty heading the culinary team.

There’s no better place to bring your favourite client or that special someone who loves delicious food. While the dishes may look it, they are actually rather placid on the spice, which means you don’t have to rule out this place even if you’re dining with little kids or the elderly — just as long as they can stomach some heat. This is the kinda place for those who want to have fun with their food, certainly not for biryani lovers! Come for a fun date or a night out with picky friends.

I am quite a regular at this place especially lunch as its near my office.
Food (Veg)- Food is good to taste and presented well too. Sushis also i tried here but they are not nice at all. I like the chinese and indian spread here. They are good in taste.
Hookah- Hookah is good. 
Ambience - ambience is good here. But once i went on a Wednesday evening. It was a sufi night and i must say i swore i will never visit this place on a wednesday evening. The live music was really really bad. 
Service- Service is bad. Staff are courteous but the service is bad. Everytime we go we have faces this issue - we were served first the main course then the starter even after specifying them the order. And then later they give both of them together even if there are just two people to eat. The staff i feel needs to be trained well. The manager however was nice and courteous and she took care of the complain and did it right later.

Wow.
Checking in now: Sunday night. January 2018
They charge 500/- bucks for a peg of whiskey but don't provide nibbles/small bite snacks.
Hookah for ₹400/₹500/₹600 !?!?!
What the fraak?
Although I love the vibe and music of this joint, the prices are not justified for some things that they are currently charging?
2nd edit for today: they serve drinks but don't bother asking for add-ons like soda/water etc. 
3rd edit: I asked for chilli sauce/mustard sauce but instead got a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup?? 
4th edit : they don't serve drinking water until you ask them to... !!??

Raize The Bar was a choosen place for my Birthday celebration back in September 2016.It was a newly open restro-bar & lounge with its own brew.The ambience is good.Because we were a big group we got a corner which was sperated from the crowd.So it   helped us maintaining our privacy.
The service was good and the staff were pro-active. The food was equally good.We ordered quiet a few veg & non-veg delicacies from their menu and the food was liked by all.What i liked was they serve a platter which is perfect meal balanced well both in quantity and quality.
Overall it was a good experience & I can surely recommend this place to others :)

Raize The Bar occupies a sprawling 5000 sq. feet area on the ground floor of the Godrej Waterside IT Park, Sector 5, Salt Lake. The interiors have a plush feeling to them which adds to the ambience of the place. The staff are very efficient and prompt in their service. The presentation of the dishes is also very nicely done. But there are 3 downsides of this place which cannot be ignored. The music is a bit too loud. The dance floor is not very spacious. Lastly but not the least, the washroom is a tad bit too small when compared to the area of the whole place. Overall a good experience.

Finally a brewery in this locality with a refined ambiance is here. Raize The Bar has everything to its advantage now.The food is mouth-watering, the beer is perfectly prepared and the music sets the mood just right. If you are looking for places to carouse with your gang on a Friday night or after a tired at work, this place should definitely be on your bucket list! Although they are short-staffed which affects the service , overall the experience is a good one.

Pocket pinch: 1100 for 2

For starters, we had Chicken Tikka Kebab and Pan fried chilli fish. Both were equally good and goes well along with drinks. 

Had Jeera Pulao, Fish Labrador, Chicken Kasha in main course, Ice cream with brownie in dessert. All the foods were good in taste and served hot.

If someone is looking for a place to eat delicious food with a glass of beer, Raize The Bar is the perfect place to hop in. 

Ordered:-
•Chicken Teriyaki 
•Grilled Chicken Breast with BBQ sauce
•Ami Kolkata (Chelo Kabab)
•Belgian Moon (sweet and tangy)


Teriyaki chicken was the best of all. 
About the Belgian Moon, if someone is looking for a taste of sweetness in beer, so this is the best one! 

Loved all the food 😍
A must visit for all big foodies out here, really happy with the food and drink.

The buffet service was excellent from food to salad everything was just on point. As for the drinks the beer was too good(since they produce there own) and virgin mojito is best around the town. The place is really beautiful and provides ample of space for their customer. Really looking forward to visit this place soon!!!
P.S: one thing I didn't get was why they charged us extra 8% for service tax after charging 5% GST! Other than this everything was quite good

I went on a Thursday night with a colleague of mine. If you are a fan of crafted beer then this is the place for you. It's a microbrewery with 4 varieties of their craft beer. We had a taster and selected Belgian and German varieties. The Belgian one was stronger. Taste was good. In Food we had ordered green chili chicken,  tengra style chili chicken, a dish which comprised of mushroom which absolutely tasted amazing, Chicken lassagna which was also very good. The music is very very loud which is a great place for all hard music lovers. The staff was attentive and courteous. 
Overall an amazing experience. I would definitely like to visit again.

To day I visited with my family to take buffet lunch the place was overcrowded but we get the table the chairs were uncomfortable once we decided to leave the place but it was 2 P.M.and we were hungry so having no option we started buffet lunch surprisingly some of the containers were empty and others have last small quantity food which was either cold or not fit for consumption. I draw the attention of waiters who were standing but of no use we have taken soup which was cold and small quantity of certain food and completed our lunch any way.The food was cold and tasteless.I advice one should refrain himself going such type of place.We waste our money.interestingly without any service they add 8%service charges which I refused to pay.

It's located at the ground floor of my office building. Been there couple of times but the best experience was when I visited there for my boss's birthday bash. The food quantity was less but the taste makes up to it. And the cocktails are equally chilled and lip smacking! I had a pitcher of beer which was enough for at least 3 people!! The staff are courteous and made the celebration more enjoyable by suggesting different good items which are too delicious. It's a little expensive but the music by dj and dance floor lightings are superb! We danced too much and were totally exhausted at the end... enjoyed a lot.

I went there this Friday after office with friends from office. The place is nice but found the music a bit loud.

They let you taste few freshly brewed beers as per their that days menu and accordingly you can order.

We ordered a hookah which was too good in taste, - sorry i dont remember the name but it was something rose paan or some flavour.

Sarson Mahi Tikka (mustard and yogurt marinated fish morsels served with mint chutni)- The bhetki was perfectly cooked and very soft and melted in the mouth.
Green Chilli Chicken (diced chicken tossed in coriander and lemon grass) - This was okay in taste. Just if you want to try new dishes go for it otherwise you can give it a miss.
Lonely Planet - I tried this non-alcoholic drink, which was very refreshing.

Went there last night around 10:30pm. Being a Saturday night it was crowded and had to wait for ten minutes. But the host was awesome and lived up to his promise to provide us a good place. Service was beyond expectations and despite being crowded, prataap the person in charge ensured service level was its peak. Food was awesome and so was the ambience and music.

it hurts to write a negative review but sometimes you need to. i had reserved a table ,with three guest,through dine out and the confirmation came at 3.30 for a visit which was scheduled at 8.30 pm. when we reached , a table for 2 was offered us. the table was not sufficient for 2 people also and it was very apparent that  a makeshift arrangement has been done to accommodate more guest on a small passageway.  few tables were vacant and when we asked them to provide us with one of those, they said it is reserved. i wonder if there are different class of reservations in restaurant too. the staff seemed to be least bothered to make any effort to make us comfortable and seeing their attitude, or the lack of it, we had no other option but to leave the place . They certainly need to Raize their level of hospitality, which is a must if they need to survive here. and yes, the music was just too loud . as someone rightly said " thotha chana baaje ghana. "

So finally RTB gets the license to do the brew.

I have already visited the place thrice and each time the experience has been great. They have 4 different beers – American Lager, English Stout, German Wheat and Belgian Witbiere -  and the taste of each imparts a feeling of quality. Though, I always consume all four flavours being a beer aficianado, my personal favourites are the lager and the stout. The stout has a delicious creamy coffee-chocolatey mouthfeel with that bold bitterness that good stouts are known for, to top it up with the creamy head.

The interiors exude class and it appears a lot of thought went into it. There are ample seating arrangements for everyone. The food too appears to be of good quality from what I have tried so far – fish n’ chips, green chilli chicken, grilled veg platter and veg teriyaki.

The staff too is friendly and you feel welcome right from the moment you come at the gate, whether you are in twos, threes, fours or even solitary.  I must mention one particular service staff – Shubhojit (bearded lad), very prompt with the requirements placed, and always eager to serve and help. 

All in all, a good, swank, upper crested, posh establishment with good beer, good food, good crowd and ofcourse, the good people who are making it all happen. Shall always visit. 

Cheers!

Food is the primary need of any human being. And eating out one always wants a blend of good food and warmth of people who give that service. Today was my first day at "Raize the Bar" and I had a real nice experience. The first dish that was served I felt the food was not as hot as it should be so I spoke to the waiter who listened to my issue and called the concerned person - Shivangi Khandelwal to have a word with me. She listened to my concern, requested me if she can check the food and later returned with the chef. The chef took full responsibility of what I was looking for and got me another dish. I was delighted. Not only this all the waiters, Ms Khandelwal and the chef gave me a great experience and extremely polite. People who accompanied me were also happy with the service. In the recent times for a person like me who eats out in most of the prime restaurant this restaurant is a BIG THUMBS UP.

Awesome ambience with quick prompt and polite waiters, this new upscale place in sector 5 took us off our heels. Music was techno and commercial house. As soon as I entered couple of my all time favourite ones by David Guerra and Avicii were played by the DJ.

It's a microbrewery with 4 varieties of their craft beer. We had a taster and selected Belgian and German varieties. The Belgian one was stronger. Taste was good. Details were provided regarding the contents, benefits, bitterness, and few more factors.

I would rate their food and presentation as really unique. We ordered green chilli chicken, chilli chicken tangra style and oregano seasoned chicken tikka. Their varieties were a fusion of Indian and foreign cuisines.

Green chilly chicken and the tangra style chilli chicken were super good. Succulent well cooked pieces of chicken. Tikka with oregano was not the best though.

The waiters are quick and take good attention. Hooka is being served. Rates are nominal for a place like this. The warmth of Bengali hospitality coupled with innovative and creative ideas make this place one of the best in sector 5.

Recently visited RTB for a dinner and the craft beer tasting session..the Belgian wheat was amazing. We tried the green chili chicken,thin crust pizza,fish tikka and a prawn delicacy...the fish was succulent and not over powering with spices..chili chicken was perfect with the fresh green chili paste hint and nicely done (keeping the right juiciness of the protein)..the pizza was in a different shape in rectangular and the place was buzzing..We enjoyed to the core and was a lovely experience.undoubtedly the best in the Sector-v area which has a great fan following from the other part of the city as well.,.

So this place in salt lake was long in my checklist. And Finally visited here
Visited mainly for their new offerings russian hookah and craft beer.
The Russian hookah was the smoothest hookah I have ever had. The flavour was savvy and the smoke sense.
They provided testers for the craft beers. I liked all of them. Especially the espresso beer was awesome.
In food melting mushroom -one of the finest mushroom dish I have ever had and the serving style was too 👌👌
Ambience is good. I was seating by the bar and the bar tenders were extremely courteous to our requests and enquiries. Dj a bit loud and dance floor a bit small. Overall a good experience will definitely visit again.

Visited this place for lunch on Saptami. The place was quite empty and still service was a bit sluggish. We started with their special melting mushroom and it was something to die for, we even repeated the order. After that we tasted chicken spaghetti , pan fried chilli fish and fish and chips - all items were great but for the drink menu many of the items were missing though. However overall a nice experience!

Visited this place few days back. It's on the Waterside building(Saltlake). Booked via dineout & got 20% discount on total bill amount. Now coming to food I've seen reviews on Zomato before that people love their Chello Kabab, so tried it & it was really awesome in taste. The rice in chello kabab was so tasty & kabab was too good. I can definitely say it is better than Peter Cat's chello kabab. Now in dessert I've tried their popular Fried Ice-cream & it was out of the world, the taste was sooo good. I just fell in love with it. Really good. Everyone should try this one. But they need to improve their service little bit. Otherwise it's a nice pub to eat&drink.😊😋

If you want to party and drink till your wallet can't take it anymore, this is the place to be. If you want a quiet conversation and cheap booze, find another joint.

Raize the Bar is at an oddly situated place on the ground floor of Godrej Waterside off the Sec V Ring Rd. They do check id's so make sure you're carrying one. The staff were courteous and it's a spacious bar with high chairs and small-ish tables. Anyway, the beer is fairly expensive here, unfortunately their craft beer system isn't functional yet, will be trying that once it's up and running. We ordered some starters, Chicken Wings and Teriyaki Chicken. The wings were strictly so-so, ranking with the also-rans in the Best Wings competition, if any. Unique presentation though, 5/5 for creativity. The Teriyaki chicken is good, with a hint of overdosing on the Soy sauce. But it's a cheap dish with enough to go around for 4 people in bite sized pieces.

The music unfortunately is loud, very loud. Makes for a difficult place to have a conversation. It's the one thing I remember most about the place and that, is a pity.

I'm sorry, if the picture is grainy and undiscernable. My camera isn't the best in dim light. 😂

Dj is not proffesional at all. They used to refuse your request. It was Friday night and the dj was playing english songs, when I asked for bollywood songs he justified that Bollywood songs only on Saturday and I have accepted it happily. Someone given him money and requested for same then only he accepted it. Then I have asked him why you are playing it right now, it's not Saturday then he told it's up to me. We are totally unsatisfied with there services and behaviour. At the time of leaving we showed him **** off, dj started using slang languages over it, rushing out me and tried to hit me and the manager started defending him with no apologies of wrong behaviour made by their dj. Bounceres started to push us after spending 10k bucks. This place is not good at all and not safe. These guys are totally unprofessional, they don't know how to serve their customer. They don't have any proffesional behaviour. This is totally rediculos.  This happened last night only. This is worst experience I ever had.

Mahasasthi evening experience at Raize the Bar was a complete showstopper! Fairly easy to locate with their big yellow hoarding on the Godrej Waterside, me and my school friends were in for a fun night and it served us just right. Moderately spacious, RDB has everything from hookah to a dedicated bar, brewery and seating area. The food, the alcohol and the service everything was better than what I expected out of it and the ratings do justice for what they offer. In the drinks their Watermelon Mojito and LIT were the best, though we also had their Cosmo, Red Wine Sangria and Mandarine Margarita. The bartender did a good job with each of them except the Cosmo had too much cranberry juice in it which just made it plain sweet. In the appetizers their popular Melting Mushrooms are absolutely worth the hype, buttery soft mushroom shots served with a sweet and sour red sauce. Steller stuff. Chilly chicken tangra style tasted nice but was more of a dry chilly chicken thing with no striking difference. Our meal followed with a terrific Lasagna, their popular Meaty Pizza and a Pan fried chilly fish. The pan fried chilly fish was okaish, a tad on the over fried side for my liking. The meaty thin crust square pizzas were all filled with chicken sausages and grilled chicken chunks was decent enough but I have had better. What stole the show was clearly their Lasagna, it's hands down one of the bests in the city. A fried icecream in the end was the cherry on top. The staff here are courteous, attentive and efficient. Our bill amounted to 6048 and it was totally worth the food and the service. Raise the Bar is clearly a winner among the new & budding pubs at sector v and I would love to come back soon.

A place to rejuvenate yourself after a long day at office. Also since it is Puja season now and if you want time-out from the crowd, try out this Sector V pub. The ambience is awesome and the interiors are classified nicely into three dictinct sections.
Wine-barrel seating arrangements, long bar counter, loud music, classy decor, DJs, good food and the variety of Cocktails are the X factors of this place. Basket of assorted fries, Nachos and Paneer Platter were our favorites along with Haakiwi, Margarita and Long Island Ice Tea. 
A thumbs up from my side and a place I can depend upon to overcome my office blues.

I went for birthday party, had a pint of bira, lots of other starters like chili chicken tyangra style, garlic prawn, paneer tikka platter, non veg platter, green chili chicken as starter.

I specially want to mention about chili chicken tyangra style and non veg platter, they are really the best in taste. rest of them are okayish but less in quantity.

Crowded friday night, usually take lots of time to serve any order, which is very much irritating.

Helpful staffs with nice hospitality but waiting time for food is more than expected.

Pan flavoured hukka is smooth and nice.

Nice pub atmosphere, but little annoying karaoke event, with the pathetic voice and tempo of people.

But the DJ was good to groove the people, and make them dance on the dance floor.

Definitely I want to try again this place for music, food and atmosphere, with a hope of a better experience.

They might come up with new micro brewery, I am eagerly waiting for that.

Located near godrej waterside near to ring road college more stretch in sector v , this is quite a nice pubstyle resturant .
Seating arrangements are divided in some sofas ,chairs , liquor barrel stand circular tables ,bar stools and all . Those circular tables also give a view of busy sector ring road and canal outside . But the sofa's are more cozy I feel .
The foods and choice of cocktails are good . Food tatsted good such as chili chicken dry,butter garlic prawns,fish and chips (decoration of the item was also good and straight out of some british eateries that we have seen) . Mojito was good as well and it was nice to find the barman coming to inform about choices as one of ingredients was not available for the ordered item .
All in all good food and drinks ,very good environment and moderately good service (need some improvement in serving) makes this one of good joint out of many in sector -v area . Go and enjoy in raize the bar ,you won't be disappointed .Aditi Sengupta

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. This place feels like home. I felt as if I was in Mumbai. Amazing ambiance, live dj, great sheesha, super polite and well mannered staff. My favourite place in Kolkata has to be raize the bar.
What we had-
∆ Veg kebab platter- this was basically our chakna.
∆ Sheesha- perfectly made. They use magic coal n we got a complimentary coal change so that was nice.
∆ strawberry mocktail- beautifully made my little sister loved it, so good we ordered another one. (Underage ppl are allowed but they can't hv drinks obviously)
∆ few shots, pints and dancing all the time.
Perfect girls night out. Definitely coming back whenever I am in Kolkata.
P.s- girls night out scored us complimentary shots which was really sweet.

Place & Food is good only, they don't serve all liquor brands mentioned on menu. Price is a bit high, they will make it higher by taking all kind of extra charges possible, like sitting charge restroom use charge etc etc lol 😂 They took 8% service charge on my bill after taking 18% of @GST. For what guys? U dont have money to pay your staffs? Explain.

Alas! Another place added to the list of Structural Only Micro Brewery in Kolkata.

Raize the bar, your bar is so much under that no matter how much u raise it, u ll barely be able to reach the ground.

Ambience - 2.5
Decor - 2
Music - God only knows coz it was so loud that even they would be getting disturbed
Hospitality - Gone to hospital
Food - 3.5 (the only saving grace)

Common it was a Saturday nite and I expect the DJ to do some justice to the name. The guy was thoroughly confused and was playing everything from Punjabi to Katy Perry. And there were people trying to do some robotic dance steps which was not even funny. I understand that the restaurant wouldn't have any control over the dance but for me it left a bad taste.

We had barely ordered few appetizers, and a main course as well, which we later realized that the guy taking the order has forgot to punch in the system. And the place was not even crowded.

-Cheese chilly toast was good, could have been a little less oily though.
- Melting mushroom is a must try not for the taste but for its presentation. The taste was not bad either.
- The nachos seemed to follow the DJs footstep and the preparation seemed to be Lil confused and overloaded with salt

If u r alone and want to grab a beer listening to some deafening music and u happen to be in sector 5, then this place can feature is your must try list

Our food experience was not good. The food was nothing great. They did not have the wines we wanted to have and had to chose from the ones they suggested. The music was decent. The hookah was flavourless. If u just want to drink and listen to Bollywood remixes then a decent place to go to.

Well a very classy pub in the sector 5 area. The food was too notch based on price, quality and quantity. I had been very satisfied. It's a sports bar and you can enjoy a match with good quality food and drinks. Service had been quite good as well. Although the waiter forgot a drinks order and had to be reminded, overall it was quite amicable and swift. What I did not like was the DJ. Music was too loud and not very engrossing. It was difficult communicating. I also did not like the sitting arrangement. The tables are short and the sitting was not at all comfortable. But overall a good pub for a short hangout in a very convenient location.

Being made to wait for the so called driving officer from 10.30 am to 5 pm was tiring and irritating ... and finally with a month or so training the wife passed her driving test with flying colors... Hungry and tired #RAIZETHEBAR was the perfect place for relaxation, good music and amazing food.

The staffs were great... I liked the part where a staff  accepted his fault for not placing an order for Lasagna con pollo and instead he placed an order for Pizza Stracetti and came to apologize us and asked if we would take the pizza instead and we accepted it, after all we humans do make mistakes ..  And such a nice gesture shown by the staff he gave my wife a mock tail free of cost...  Much Appreciated ...   
Also not to forget finally i could enjoy Hoegaarden .. I was looking for this beer for over a year now in Kol ....  Last i guess i had it in Delhi...   
Anyways over all its an amazing place, amazing food and crazy music .. Will surely visit again...

Hoping to have a quite dinner with drinks I landed up at Raize The Bar with a bunch of friends.The restaurant has a sprawling space with two different section which gives it an added advantage over othr places in sector 5.Entering through the main door one faces the bar counter where the men are busy at their creations.The bar counter adjoining area has seating arrangements divided between high chairs and tables of 4.On the extreme left is a separate area for hosting private parties for different occasions.We seated ourselves in a table of 4.The server immediately showed up with what i would call quite a fat menu.The brewery is not yet functional but the cocktail menu is quite impressive.My friends ordered for a couple of beers given a bad throat while I ordered for a hookah which arrived in a jiffy.The hookah had a strong flavour of apple ...well​ made.Our food choices included the bbq chicken wings and grilled chicken breast in mushroom sauce served with mashed potatoes .The bbq sauce was too tangy as per my taste but my friends loved it.The mushroom sauce on the other hand was light ,flavourful with the perfect balance of salt and made a perfect combination for the grilled chicken.The mashed potato could be more creamier...well who complains with more cheese.The only issue was for a thursday the music was too loud.If you want to have a chilled out time head towards this place.

The ambience of this pub is amazing. The staffs are very courteous and attentive. For starters we took fish n chips and chilly chicken tangra style. Fish item was good but chilly chicken could have been better though that was suggested by the staff there. They serve some amazing platters for the main course and also in good quantities. We opted for Ami kolkata and Cilantro rice mix bowl and both were awesome. Ami kolkata was again suggested by a staff there who claimed that the chelo kabab would be better than Peter Cat even. Though I would not compare but definitely the one in raize the bar was one of the best chelo kebab i had. Would recommend this place specially for the food.

 Raize the bar stood above my expectations. From the decor to  the ambience, from the food to the smoke, from the hospitality to the classiness, Raize the bar contents everything. Reader's should not think about the place much. Quickly grab your party shoes and hop in!

Definitely, One of the best places I have been to,in Kolkata. Located in Godrej Waterside building, Sector V Salt lake, I used to regularly cross the building, but never entered it, but I am glad, I finally did. Dont let the silent and deserted outside fool you, once you enter the place you will feel the energy inside the place.

Service: Too good.
We were warmly greeted at the entrance and guided to the table. The order was taken in a very professional way, and the whole experience right till the end was smooth.

Food: Quite good.
We had BBQ chicken wings which was really yum.
Then we had a Pizza. The crust was great though could have been better.
Finally we had the Fried ice cream which was mind blowing, both in taste as well as presentation.

Ambience: Excellent
The place has beautiful decor, thus we got a chance to click a lot of selfies. ;) The groovy music adds to the energy of the place.

Overall it was a great experience. Will certainly be visiting this place again.

The decor and the ambiance of this place is simply exquisite... The bar looks extremely beautiful during the evening (because of the lighting) and a prefect spot  to take pictures 😉. 
This place is huge with some interesting and comfortable seating arrangements. 
The price of the alcoholic beverages are bit higher than the usual price . 
The price of the food items are again on the higher side but it's totally worth it when it comes to the quality and taste.
The staff is super friendly and helpful and the service was super fast.

Visited RTB with friends on a Saturday night and came back absolutely satisfied! It's difficult to say what was more impressive - food, drinks, ambience, or service! This place was impressive on all the counts. We started with sangria, which was good - not great. Perhaps the weakest link in our tale as the bar kept raising with each subsequent order. Chilli cheese toast, stuffed mushrooms (ufff! To die for!!), the Bellini, loaded nachos - all well done! And the music - one of those evenings when the DJ just rules.. special mention of the DJ - it was a girl at the helm of it and she totally rocked the party! Kudos and more power! Well done team RTB.. we are coming back for more mushrooms and more cocktails :)

Wonderful interiors. It's not very spacious, but whatever space they have, it's used pretty cleverly.
The wooden theme works well.

Good food. The chicken wings are so good, so's the chilli chicken. They didn't have calamari, which we wanted to order. Too bad. Slightly overpriced. The music is all remixes, sometimes of Adele's songs. Please don't do that. Take tips from The Grid and Monkey Bar.

For drinks, we just kept ordering pints of BIRA and Budweiser.
The smoking room is pretty cool. Skeleton-themed ashtrays and the ceiling is painted as a view from inside a grave.

Also, they take forever to bring a hookah to the table. So much so, that we cancelled ours after waiting for almost half an hour.

Overall, recommended. They've got very good food. Book a table through Zomato/Dineout to avoid waiting.

Located at the ground floor of the opulent Godrej Waterside complex it is very easy to spot. The ambiance is very good and on a rainy day like today the view from the inside is very scenic. We went there on an impromptu lunch out plan. We tried the fish and chips and the Barbequed chicken wings as starters. The surprise of the day came in the form of melting mushrooms, the spicy and tangy taste of dish fused soo well together that it was just perfect. In the main course both Kungpao chicken and Tangra Kitchen was pretty good as combos. The fried ice cream was the perfect ending this outing deserved.
Would love to revisit, anytime.

I recently tried the buffet they have recently started. 499+taxes. However, they add the service tax as well in the bill which is optional. The menu was pretty good with a lot of variety- Chicken tikka, chili fish, veg spring rolls and some chilli paneer for starters.
Tom yum soup which was amazing. GI shots , ceasar salad, some more 3 varities of salads, papad, n mini buns. Then for main course- mutton lucknow style biriyani, chicken methi, Mexican noodles, fish in red wine, pindi chana, steam rice, some daal and don't remember the veg options much. For drinks there were 3 types of draught beer and mocktails. For deserts - mango ice cream with darsan and baked rasgulla which was the only disappointment.

Well, I visited RTB on a Monday and what a vibe. I'm in love with this place especially because of the food. As usual I forgot the name is my platter. 
All I can tell you is, this place is worth all your dime. 
"Take my money and make me happy." This place also serves hookah (which I'm not fond of).
Also, Shivangi is the PRO of this place and is a very humble person. I loved how she interacted with us after our bill was served :)

Have heard many good things about this place and after visiting here a few weeks ago, I second that opinion. Raize The Bar is easily located at Sector 5 and is spacious pub and restaurant. The interiors are nicely done. The bar area looks great. Me and my friends ordered a Gumsupari Hookah and we're happily puffing away. In Food we had the:-
Pizza Provencal- Topped with olives and peppers. Was quite cheesy.
Chicken Lasagne- Awesome taste 💓💓
Kappa Makizushi Sushi- A form of vegetarian sushi. This was my first time trying sushi and I hated it completely.
The service was good. Staff was attentive and polite. Great place to come and have a good time. Cheers!

Before going to office had a little booze and good food at this brewery . The X factor about this place is that you get to be surrounded by big cylinders of beer and can witness beer making in the background . However having no dance floor to shake your leg makes it quite unreliable as the DJ plays good songs . The food was good and it had nice dips to complement your chicken . I went with one of my friend and had 3 pints of beer , one shot of smirnoff on the rocks ( less booze since office was calling at night 😛 ) , one chicken barbeque wings and a platter of chicken tikka kabab coated with oregano whose side dip was just yummy and in the dessert had an amazing dessert however the name seemed too big to be remembered 😁 Overall nice place however would not feel like going again as I did not get that vibe like other places .

Ordered the veg kebab platter, had plans on ordering other stuffs but after having the platter cancelled the thought of ordering anything further. I think that's the drawback of bars, you DONT get good VEGETARIAN  food. 😐

Went to this place in the middle of a thunderstorm & rain last night with a friend. Was eyeing this place for a really really long time & finally decided to go for a couple of drinks & some food there. What can I say.. Starting from the amazing decor.. mood setting music.. to the drinks.. the food. After a round of our signature scotch whiskeys, the man who was serving us drinks suggested we go for The Group Shot since we craved for some Tequila & with all the 4 different flavours of it it was so good!! We also ordered a Kahlua & a Bailey's Irish cream.. the former being near to perfection, amazing blend of flavours. The latter could have been slightly better, but good nevertheless.
 For food we started of with a Chilli Chicken in Tangra style.. and then went on to order Chicken Teriyaki, a meaty pizza & another fish dish. Hungry as we were.. we just couldn't stop eating as soon as the food was being served :P Also since it was a post birthday celebration, the resto manager Shivangi was so kind & helpful in arranging a Brownie cake for my friend with a mini birthday song in the backdrop. It was so sweet of her to give us a gift card which we could avail a discount from the next time we visit. Thank you Ms Shivangi for the wonderful evening. Loved the place. Loved the food. The service. Staff behaviour. I can't wait to go back there once again. <3

Amazing view from the bar, loved that for starters. 

This can be located right from the main road. The interior is more or less like a brewery with beer tanks and barrels. 
High stools and spacious seating. 
We went there for a small span of time so, chilled with 2 points of beer and classic chicken tikka, as per their suggestion. 
It was really tasty. Succulent pieces of chicken tikka and cooked perfectly with the spices. Served with onions and pudina chutney in shot glasses. 

Good presentation and courteous staff. 
Would love to go visit again 💯

Decent place in sector 5 to hangout with friends or office buddies. Went to this place after office with some friends, though it was quite late but the ambience and the hospitality were really good.  

Tried to go for some beer,.but most of the good brands were unavailable. Same happened with other liquors also, so went for the drinks that were available at that moment. Also tried pizza and chilli baby corn to go with that. Food wa quite decent and the service was worth an appreciation. 
Would have given a better rating, but giving 3.5 due to the availability of drinks which was really disappointing.

One of the best place to hangout in sector 5. I loved it's ambience. A place apt even to go with family ❤
Food is delicious and the service makes it better! 
I heard a lot about it's Melting mushrooms and it is no doubt the best starter there.  We also had a tandoori kebab platter, two sizzlers and a Lebanese platter. I didn't think sizzler was upto the mark as compared to other main course platters which we had.  I had had a much better Lebanese platter than that served here. (Quantity was also not according to the standard Mezze platter) 
I loved the "Samui Stir fried greens"(rice based dish with gravy) and  "Veg terayaki platter"(Noodles with veggies). 
Must try for vegetarians💯

I visited this place on my bdy with my friend. Very good ambience & nice interiors. The taste of food was amazing. The executive and service guys are very well mannered. The music was so good that i ordered one more dish to be there . I loved the music and i going to come again . The only thing i didn't find good was it's Nacho's. I have never had such poor taste of it. It was pain to eat. Please improve that. That's why 4 star only.

I had lunch here on a Sunday. Interiors and nice. The staff is good, but the food is good without being anything​ memorable. The RTB pizza was excellent. The cheesy mushrooms can be tried. The mocktails are interesting. Overall, can go if you want to hang out with friends.

I went to this place during a sizzler fiesta. Tried two veg sizzlers, one with cottage cheese, sour cream and rice. Another one with noodles and paneer Momo. Tried two non veg sizzlers, one Tandoori platter that came with chicken kebabs, dal makhani and kulcha. Another one with bhetki fish fry. All four items were great and had very unique taste. But I give 4 rating majorly because of the ambience of the place. The music, the decor and the amazing service will surely lift up your mood.

Now here is a pub where the food beats all else hands down! 

Nice little place located at Godrej Waterside. Feels like the right place to hang out as you walk in the doors. The decor is warm and you feel at ease soon enough. The only gripe I have is the lack of space to move around but that is entirely acceptable given the rest.

Food is where they outshine peers. If you find it tough to decide what to go for, you may always ask for the platters which are a selection of fine kebabs - fish, chicken, prawns and mutton sheekh. Kudos to the house chefs who certainly do justice to their trade. What I liked even more was that although the service was quick the dishes looked pretty and well presented.

The beer tasted very fresh and had that zing which is often missing from the bottled ones. The Sheesha was enjoyable as well. 

Music was good and set the right mood for the evening. 

Altogether a wonderful and relaxing experience I will certainly love to revisit.

Loud music, Good decor and plenty in food menu.. enough to rate this high when compared with rest of the pubs in kolkata.

I would still complain a little, about the space available on floor. At least when compared with rest of the pubs we have.

Went after my exam and one time after that. 

Hookah is average. Service quality and reassurance of quality is great. Pizza is good. Quantity of pasta is very less, quality is decent.

Rest other food items were okayish. Like paneer tikka was okayish and another platter i ordered which comes with fried rice - the gravy was very bad. 


Ambience: Ambience is great. It has live music by a dj which is decent. Has got a dance floor. And the overall environment is very sexy.

Staff and the managers are very very well behaved.

If you're going for drinks make sure it doesnt create a hole in your pocket as you can book a table from dineout app and get 20-30% off on total bill. 

This place is amazing to go with friends or even family.

This place has got young crowd. Like 20-30 years old crowd. 

Only thing which they should improve on is overall re engineering of food by altering the tastes and including more options.

Variety is less ..a little bit more compared to pour house but doesnt match 10 downing street even a bit. 

Also to be noted that they dont keep beer cans which I think they do it purposely bcz they earn more on pints which is very bad. 

Sometimes you dont get few brands of whisky available. But thats quite normal.

Visited this place on 20th May at their mindblowing event "Saturday Night Mayhem" 
No doubt DJ Harish Rocked the pub that night.. The pub looked full packed..
Dim light and super awesome ambience..

Now coming to food, drinks and service..
Food was mouthwatering
Drinks were super awesome..
And hatsoff to all the servers who managed to deliver each and everything on table at time..
Since the pub was full packed I thought I may get slow service but I was wrong..

Highly impressed with their top class service and management !
Would recommend my friends to visit the place.
Looking forward for more upcoming DJ nights and other events at this highly reputed pub..
Please..Start the brewery soon...! ☺

A nice place to be... I liked it's ambiance and it's drinks. Food is good especially I liked the green chilli chicken. It one of a kind and have never tasted one before so I really liked it. But I wish it's brewery was open. I am waiting for its brewery to open. And I wish they have different varieties of beer in their brewery which we can select after tasting them...

We went to Raize The Bar in sector 5 on a Friday evening and ended up being insanely surprised! Their selection of wines and menu was diverse. Special mentions to the Frontera, refreshing cocktails and amazingly curated dishes such as the Sake & Sushi and smoked pasta which were the highlights. Great place to go out post work and a fun time with friends!!

I am a gourmet and travel a lot, found Raize The Bar a great dine out. Ambience and look is perfect to my needs, I am touched by service and food. Hostage is cheer up by her smile and helpfulness. Sumptuous food is best part to treat your guests. Wide collection of new world wine and of course chilled beer satisfied my thirst. I am a regular visitor of this restaurant and always it has proven a great place to chill out. Managers and chefs are very proactive to the services. Large menu with various options and chefs are always ready to customize your palate where I can rediscover my choice. Thanks to city of joy and the place.

I so overwhelmed with the greetings rendered to us. We were offered mouth watering cigar roll, nachos with salsa and dips. Amus bouche specially prepared by chef which was beyond my imagination. Thanks to the service team and the place is a great treasure for foodies.

This popular pub comes with a big reputation. After having been turned away the last time due to my partner being in shorts, I had to come back because I was excited to see how it is. It turned out to be quite a muted experience, ironically.

The sangria was overloaded with fruit, especially orange bitters. It made the drink nearly inedible. The mezze platter, I felt could have featured better variety. There were a couple of cheese cigar roll-like elements. I did not understand them and wouldn't have minded if they tasted good. The core hummus element was a failure. It had a funky taste. Not great, sadly. The vegetarian nigiri sushi fared better. The portion size was miniscule though. 

The biggest irritant was the decibel. Maybe I am an old crone but it was insanely loud that night. We and a couple of other tables repeatedly asked for the volume to be turned down. But no luck. We finally left with partially full stomachs and bleeding eardrums. Beyond me why they chose to keep blasting the music despite complaints.

I don't know how it is on other days but the day i went to the music was terrible, really bad bollywood scum music. The smoking zone was overcrowded at all times. The food was really bad. They charged us more for a drink which was cheaper on the menu saying it's a different brand. It was a terrible experience and if it's always like this i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone

Overall ambience was good. Most of the staff's behavior was decent, excluding one who falsely claimed that the table of our choice was reserved which was not the case. Food quality was good too. Had a few pint of beer followed by a cocktail.

Normally, the cocktails in other pubs mostly taste good as they are generally a mixture of 1 or 2 alcoholic drinks with some smooth non-alcoholic flavours. But this specific cocktail, named Moscow Mule, was of horrible taste. It did not have any flavour in it. Just a mixture of Vodka n Beer with some Slices of Ginger in it. The way it was served was also weird which made it difficult to enjoy it even more.

Do try the Melting Mushroom and the Chicken Teriyaki. Both were delicious. And though the pasta preparations on the menu are all made of red sauce, they did make a yummy white sauce penne pasta on our request.

This place always maintain cleanliness and hygiene, be it in the kitchen, at the Bar or the seating area. Washrooms are always found neat and clean, either on weekends or on weekdays..
A place with a huge parking area, rocking music, amazing food and drinks and most importantly great service.
This place is one of my favorites in Kolkata.

2. Service: Very hospitable and courteous staff. What impressed me the most was that the Chef actually came to help suggest dishes that would suit me. Even the servers were very jolly, friendly and helpful.
3. Food and Drinks: For food, opted for a Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce going with the Chef's suggestion and throughly enjoyed the same. Drinks, had a Jacobs Creek and a Liberian Peninsula as mocktail. Again, very well made.

Overall, awesome place, awesome ambience, awesome food, awesome people. Coming back for sure!!!

I got a complementary deal from little and it's was completely worth. Thank you Team Little. I got 2 pint beer 🍺 in starter I preferred Crispy chilly baby corn followed by Pasta. Beer was chilled and perfect. Baby corn was perfect in taste and a very rare thing to be noticed they were all in same size. Pasta was just mind blowing I think I stopped talking after pasta was served. It had parmesan cheese cheery tomatoes drizzle of olive oil. Dear chef you made my day.

Cool place to hangout. Awesome interior decoration. Wooden barrel tables, wine bottles chandelier to the ceiling which is made of old beer crates. First microbrewery in salt lake area. Music was so so.. Hookah was not so good. But the service was excellent. Overall the ambience was good.

This is just a overhyped destination with nothing good. Soggy atmos and very cold reception. The food ordered was cheesy mushroom and veg kebab platter and both were horrible for taste buds. I really feel to have wasted 2 grands for this ridiculous place. 

Edit- 
They called us multiple times to visit and we took out time on their request. 
This time this was from the end of management and the Executive chef. We were served good food rather delicious one and the service was immaculate and the food was on the house. To be true they " Raized the Bar". Will visit again

Visited this place on Valentine's weekend since they were one of the few places not to have any cover charge. The music and the ambience was too good. This place has the coolest music, the Dj plays unique remixes . Food was tasty and the cocktails were really really good. But Their service is very slow and not upto the mark.

Salt lake. The place where there are numerous offices and myriad young crowd waiting for a Friday night to come so they can get away from their job lives and enjoy a good evening. And when you have such a place in the midst of them, you know you have struck gold. 

Raize The Bar is a good place. The ambiance is very @pleasing and the mood of the place is perfect. The options in the menu are many and obviously drinks!!

We were a group of three people and for the first time in Kolkata with me, all the three vegetarians. Yay!! Finally some company. We ordered CRISPY CHILLY STYLE where we got paneer, potato and babycorn on one plate. The dish was good; nothing to complain about. The second dish was Pizza RTB and it had goat cheese and garlic chips at the top. The taste was completely different as the sauce base was not only tomatoes but a pesto style sauce. Overall a good experience in food department. 

Drinks : LIIT and Kiwi Margarita. Quite good. Appropriate alcohol content and the flavours were coming out nicely. 

Definitely worth a visit here. The entrance looks like an office building but then on the inside a perfect party place.

One of the most happening place in Sector5. This was my second visit to this place and I am as satisfied as the first day. We ordered chicken teriyaki for starters and a colourful mocktail called Lonely planet. Chicken was yumm. Then main coarse was another surprise for us, as it named A trip to Phuket. Pad thai noodle with basil chicken, both was super delicious. Dessert was my all time favourite Fried Ice cream. Apart from food the music was great.

Visited this bar cum restaurant on Poila Boisakh 2017 and its the best thing that I have visited in quite a few some time.Ambience is outstanding makes you feel in a new dimension.Music played by their DJ made me cherish my taste of Trance world that I have been following for long time.
Food quality is too good.Had 4 dishes ....Fish and chips , Chicken Tikka with Oregano , Lasagne with melted chicken and mushroom and the dessert (brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce)...Overall my experience was really good would recommend anybody anytime if someone needs music combined with some good food.

The place stands tall amidst a silent salt Lake street..lively to the power infinity. .ambience is something to be boasted about..
The most cool thing I liked about Raize the bar was seeing the staffs wearing suspenders attached to their pants..cool and nice thought..overall a great place to spend an evening or a night..

On a casual weekday, we decided to visit this place for lunch from office. When we entered the place, all of us loved the ambience and feel of the place. We ordered for a mocktail - Haakiwi which was quite nice and fresh lime soda which was so average. The sheesha we ordered KIwi Gum Supari - it was nice, nothing too good about it though. For starters we ordered a crispy chill platter kind of thing which had cottage cheese, baby corn and potatoes. It looked like all these are cooked in the same sauce, somehow not so satisfying but it was fine. The spinach cheese cigar rolls which we ordered were very tasty and we totally relished it. For main course we order for a asaparagus risotto and we specified we want vegetables as well, four topping pizza and a spaghetti aglio olio. The risotto was such a disappointment, it seemed like an asparagus khichi, absolutely not herbed. We request the staff to please herb it slightly but they refused to do it on the basis that now that u guys have added oregano and chilli flakes we can't do anything. The pizza and spaghetti we quite good but the portions were baby size in terms of the prize they charged. I was really excited to visit this place and the overall  experience is so disappointing,

Had gone there for my Office Party . The drinks and mocktails were pretty good . We had asked for unlimited alcohol and mocktails and they rightly delivered on that point .The starters that they had provided with the drinks were delicious. The non veg starters were pan fried fish and chicken kabab . The veg starters wrre chilli baby corn and paneer. The main course that they served were not at all up to the mark . I guess this was their way of cutting down on cost since we had booked a package for our office party. Every component served on the main course was awful and none of us enjoyed it. For dessert they served soupy vanilla icecream and dry chocolate mudcake. Overall , i would like to try their foods and see the quality when it's not a package deal and would suggest others to do the same. Otherwise , this place is good for drinks and finger foods. And yes there is one added bonus which is Dance floor.

The environment was chilling and was the good place to stay. Though costly but a good place to chill. Crowd comes there is good and though the dance floor was so small that a bunch of people can hardly move or dance. The main attraction of the place is the crowd they pull.

An awesome place to be present in the friday evening, this has the energy u just require. Music is a bit loud but, u will njoy it. This place has a micro brewery but its not open yet, still need to wait for that. And they have a very little collection of beers, almost no option. Food is awesome, my pick of the day were chiken wings in bbq sauce and teriyaki chicken.

One of my worst experiences..Half of the beers in the menu were not available. We ordered melting mushroom as our appetizer and the sauce served with it tasted very bad.For the main course we ordered the white sauce pasta which tasted fine but the chocolate sauce with it was absolutely inappropriate and tasted bad. The only good thing was the sheesha. Would never visit again nor would recommend it to anyone. Highly disappointing!!

Visited this place many times...😚
Situated at sec 5,college more...just beside the Godrej waterside..🙂

Nice ambiance,great food and chilled beer..what more u need for a great evening...🤗 They have a drinks counter set up in the middle of the bar, that will attract ur eyes fr sure..U can sit there and enjoy ur drink also..😇

My favorite food list here...

1. MELTING MUSHROOM : b=Beautifully served,on top of small bikars.. 6 pieces in total. With the cheese melting over the mushrooms and with a super tasty sauce,.. everytime I visit this place I order this one for sure. The mushrooms really just melts,and tastes a lot different from the other mushrooms dishes I had earlier..and the orange sauce with a zingy taste,gives a flavor blast in your mouth..😇

2. CHICKEN TERIYAKI : Shredded chicken with teriyaki sauce,cooked to perfection..goes well with beer and drinks.😄

3. NONVEG PLATTER : Two kinds of chicken kababs, one sik kabab..one fish kabab and prawn kabab...total 15 pieces..served with one sweet cream and green chutney. Each and every kabab tastes really good..😍.

4. PANEER TIKKA PLATTER : Six paneer pieces with three kind of varieties,,...colorful and tasty.👌

5. LASAGNA : One of the best lasagnas I ever had in town...the pastas r just cooked to perfection..with good amount of cheese and minced chicken layer and a tomato gravy..😍 If u are not ok with too much of cheese ..then don't go for it..else u will just love it 🤗

6. GRILLED CHICKEN BREST : They ask u to choose in which sauce u would like to have ur dish, I had chosen barbq sauce...and the result was great.🤗
Two big chicken breasts,grilled...and served with lots of veggies and mashed potato. 😄😃

The stuffs are really courteous..they suggest u what to order.😊 The hukkah and drinks are amazing too. 🤗
So a great place overall..with this amazing foods,drinks...classy ambiance and music at the background...🤘

Great food, great ambience, slightly pricey but totally worth it.
Chicken teriyaki , Chinese rice and chicken combo, chicken pizza (well portioned) and brownie with ice cream. Each item was different than the other and it was awesomeness defined as far as the brownie was concerned!! 
I was there for lunch but I am sure that the dinner would be a better deal considering the decor and music.

A recipe of a perfect evening with friends is cozy place accompanied with chilled beer,  refreshing sisha and sumptuous food. To set the mood thumping music by a DJ is like icing on the cake. Raize The Bar has scored full marks in all these departments. An impromptu decision to hit RTB has paid off with a memorable evening. 
In food we ordered Chilly Chicken in Tangra Style,  Fish and Chips,  Chicken Teriyaki. Also had Sushi Flavors of Tokyo and Meaty Pizza in the mains. Being a night sponsored by Budweiser we unfortunately had no other options for beer.  The best part is they will check with you to ensure the beer served is as per your likeness of temperature. Very rarely seen this gesture in pubs specially during peak hours. 
Music and speakers are one of the best I have witnessed recently. Crowd quality is very up market too. It's now the best pub in the area. Staffs are not only courteous but also smart chaps. There will be impact to your wallet but quality comes with a cost.

The definition of nightlife is changing in Kolkata and Raize The Bar is indeed one of the powerful catalysts steering the change.. Located conveniently in the Godrej Waterside, a 5 mins walk from College More.. The place is huge to give the ultimate feel to party animals and quite elegantly and carefully designed to impart the modern looks to this place.. This place houses the first micro-brewery in the locality and they specializes in innovative cocktails and specially crafted fusion foods to go well with your drinks..
Visited this place last month on Valentines weekend since they were one of the few places not to have any cover charge.. The place was delightfully decorated for the occasion and the vibes of this place will get you readily into the groove.. The vibrant music will set the tune for a memorable evening and the ambience will allow you to relax and enjoy your drinks and tidbits or even dance to the pop numbers.. You will encounter a huge bar as soon as you enter, the lanterns, the glass pane and the wooden decors add further to the grandeur.. Since the place was choc-a-bloc we were given high bar stools adjacent to the bar, though a bit inconvenient but still manageable.. The only issue I felt was the small dance floor and as the night got young, people gathered on the floor blocking the way out of the restaurant.. Service was quite professional and even on a mostly busy night they never failed to attend our call.. The menu is quite extensive with an interesting selection of dishes, and based on server’s advice we ordered:
Manhattan: One of the most celebrated and popular cocktails globally made from whiskey, angostura bitters and vermouth.. The blend was apt and the drink was strong enough to my likings..
Orange Juice: Fresh and chilled, nothing more to add..
Green Chilly Chicken: This dish caught my attention as soon as I read the menu.. Server claimed it to be their specialty and boy this is some serious flavor.. Loved the punch and twist with Calcuttan’s favorite dish, the lemongrass and coriander paste added a new dimension to the dish and a respite from the usual starters..
Calamari Fritto: Served with French Fries, loved the presentation in a set of conical apparatus.. The accompanied sweetened tamarind chutney perfectly complemented the crunchy squid rings.. A perfect companion for some serious booze..
A Trip To Phuket: A delectable combo platter with a catchy name.. Pad Thai Noodles and Basil Chicken accompanied with Kimchi salad.. Loved the tangy, nutty flat noodles with a slightly sweetish touch.. The heat and tanginess of the basil chicken complemented perfectly the subtle flavors of the pad thai..
We were too full by this time and sadly most of the deserts were not available that night.. Still I will appreciate them for the minimal serving time and the aesthetic plating of the dishes.. This place truly gives a feel of modern global cuisine and hospitality to the people of Kolkata.. Overall our total cheque was Rs.1909/- (all incl.) for 2 people and even though the prices are steeper compared to the portions of dishes served, the environment and experience will compensate for the same..

'Raize The Bar' is located at Godrej Waterside, Near College More, Sector 5, Salt Lake.Yesterday I've been there with my friends for dinner.First of all ambience is good,low light & loud music with Dj,there is also dance floor.Staffs are friendly,they offered us Ghol for holi special.Atfirst we ordered 'Chicken Teriyaki' as starter.It is little sweet,japanese preparation.We also ordered here some alchohlic drinks like Gin with Tonic water,Long Island Iced Tea & mocktail like 'Liberian Peninsula'- it is mind blowing,fully mixed with orange,lemon grass,palm sugar & chilli..Then we tasted here 'Chilly Chicken Tangra Style','Soy Braised Drums of Heaven' & 'Green Chilly Chicken' as starters.All starters are delicious.'Soy Braised Drums of Heaven' is extremely delicious,fully chicken marinated with sauce & spice.Then we ordered main course like platter.The platters are  'A trip to Phuket (Basil Chicken with pad thai noodles and pickled vegetables)',Pad Thai noodles is very tasty but basil chicken is not up to mark.Other platter is 'Tangra Kitchen Platter (Chilly Chicken with Burnt Garlic Fried Rice),rice & chicken both are tasty.Atlast we ordered here  'Fried Ice-cream with caramel & Cointreau Sauce' & 'Brownie with vanilla ice-cream served with chocolate sauce' as desserts.Both are tasty.All over very good experience.Price is reasonable.They also charged 8% service charge.

While the ambience is great and the restaurant has a sprawling floor area, the food is just about average. The service was prompt. One of the items that stood out was the chicken soup. But that's not why anyone's headed to this bar.

I am not a party person but this place got me grooving. The decor is catchy  and the sitting arrangements quite cheerful. The food was high on the taste quotient and the mocktails were a heavenly affair.  I had  quite a number of beverages and calling a favorite would be hard. They have really mastered the art of mixing drinks alcoholic or non alcoholic.

The place has a good aumbince and interiors, but the service is well below average and the time taken to serve the order is way too long. Even the price range didn't match with what Zomato displays. overall the experience wasn't great.

Went to this pub last week, which literally Raized the bar for me, awsm decor, good music and very frndly staff. Being a hardcore non vegetarian I generally opt for non veg, but this place proved that even vegetarian food can be good. Melting Mushroom was mouth watering, barbq chicken wings, meaty pizza, chicken teriyaki was best I had so far. To quench our thirst we ordered normal beers, Hawaiian sundowner, Breakfast Martini. It was a very satisfying experience. Great job guys..

Finally a great pub in Kolkata. Quite huge place with live music, breweries all around, nice decor, good crowd and last but not the least, excellent food and beverages. Ambience is good although a bit slow service. Visited this particular place couple of months back and we have tried Dahi ke kebab, meaty pizza, melting mushrooms. sangria, ginger martinis, classic margarita, kahlua flavoured mascarpone and a sheesha. Food decoration is eye catching although a little over price. But the quality of food and beverages are absolutely mind blowing. Service should be little better as I felt!

This place definitely makes it to one of my favourite places in the city. It would have been so much more popular if it was located in Park Street or somewhere down south,I bet but it's pretty popular in Sector V owing to its convenient location and car parking facility. I loved their cocktails menu.  We tried the Caprioska, Ginger Martini, beer and a few mocktails like the Haakiwi etc. Coming to the food, we had the paneer tikka platter and the chilli cheese toast. Their servings are decent and the chilly cheese toast is highly recommended. 
The ambience is amazing with the bar at the centre, one side of the joint having loud music and hookah and the other side is relatively calmer with beautiful curtains and lighting. 
Staff is decent and the place is a must for a hangout with friends. Add it to your wishlist if you haven't. 
Raise the bar, people!

We ordered a bottle of beer and Chicken lasagne. 
The food was too tasty. The thing which was shocking was that, the waiters didn't even serve us a glass of water. Though we were the only customers there apart from a group of three guys. That was really disappointing as the service tax was around Rs.200 yet they failed to serve us a glass of water. We asked for water after we had our food. And the staff didn't even apologise for the inconvenience. Food was good bt service was really very disappointing.

Definitely the mini kathi rolls, tangra style chill chicken and calamari risotto for appetizers.
And you'll know why it's "Raize  the Bar."
For main course, the sea food platter, grilled bhetki and grilled chicken breast.
And if you're are a group of 5-6 people, this is more than enough food for you all and it's worth every penny!

Place is too overrated.Went after reading few reviews and good rating.But the food was not up to the mark.

We ordered chilly chicken tagra style(too salty),a trip to phuket(it was also too salty, wasted a lot),vegetarian kebab platter(too sweet and not a single kebab was edible),wasabi touched nigiri(good) and Haakiwi(best thing we ordered).Ambiance was good but music was too loud.It was too difficult to communicate.

Food was disappointing .Presentation of food and ambiance was descent.

Not often a place amuses you like this place did. Went to grab some drinks and snacks on a weekday. And what a place it turned out to be. Cozy ambience and a nice crowd. The drinks menu is okayish. They need to be better when it comes to more variety. Food was amazing. The dj was good enough. He kept the mood on all along. All I hope is that next time when I visit the place, they have their microbrewery up and working. 
You did "raize" the bar indeed.

I visited this place on 2nd Jan'17. The ambiance was very satisfying and was the restaurants was very well maintained. But when the bill arrived,  I see they have charged Rs 25 for a bottle of water which had MRP Rs 10. I questioned them as to why they are violating the "law of charging packaged water and soft drinks strictly on MRP". They argued that "you have to pay full amount. We cannot do anything".

Again, they charged Service Charge of Rs 54. But as per law passed on 2nd Jan'17, customers have the right not to pay any Service Charge. All total, I was charged extra Rs 69 unnecessarily.

I do not understand why restaurants of such high repute do not follow the law and still continue to increase profits the unethical way. Even the government is not seen to be taking bold measures to implement a law created many many days ago. This particular incident of overcharging customers totally ruined our experience. I have also written about this to the Consumer Court.

Music was too loud and they refused to turn it down.

Location is perfect for after office parties and drinks. Situated in Salt Lake Sector 5 area and surrounded by corporate offices, this place attracts plenty of people from close by offices to party and enjoy.

The food and the ambiance is too good. The service is worth recommending and the music is over the top. 

The only thing i found that these guys can improve upon is that all varieties of beers are not available even though listed in their menu and this thing turns of people. On my visit, only 2 kinds of beers were available and that is something that should not be happening at such a place.

Overall, a nice experience and one can always drop by to have fun and relax with your friends and colleagues.

If you haven't tried out Raize the Bar yet, please do. It has raised the effin' bar. Food, beverage, service, ambience, everything simply spot on.

Situated at Godrej Waterside building, this place is very easy to locate. The ambience is nice. The decor is decent with wooden furnitures and old school lanterns. The barrels of the beer are visible right outside the glass walls of the restaurant. The waiters are all well trained, very polite, and helpful. They are prompt in taking orders and serving. 

Absolutely no complaint about the food or the beverages. We begun with sangria, ginger martini, and classic margarita. For food we had dahi kebab, melting mushrooms, meaty pizza and Kahula flavoured mascarpone. The dahi kebab was delicious. The saffron yogurt dip gave it a fantastic punch. The melting mushrooms was a simple dish but was very appetizing. Loved the dip made by sweet chili sauce and garlic. The pizza was good (if not extraordinary). The Kahula flavoured mascarpone was out of the world. Perfectly balanced. No extra sweetness. The bitterness of the coffee did go perfectly with the cheese.

P.S. please keep the option for the hot beverages (tea or coffee) available, it's winter and people badly need these often.

This is by far the best restaurant cum bar in sector five, even better than opium. Ambiance, service, food, drink everything top notch. Seven of us went there for a small office party and we enjoyed thoroughly. Though the wooden chairs are little uncomfortable but rest are excellent. Service is excellent, you just raise your hand and someone will come to you. They are taking 8% service charge so good service is quite natural I guess! Waiters are polite and knowledgeable. We ordered some alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks along with many veg and non veg starters, didn't take any main course. Drinks were good and food excellent. Ordered pan fried chili fish, soy braised drumsticks, jhinga nisha, pasandeeda paneer, barbeq chicken wings, sarson mahi tikka, dahi ke kabab. All of them were absolutely delightful, special mention goes to dahi kabab, too good. Would have given 5 stars but deducting 0.5 marks as they don't serve any mutton item and taxes are really high, otherwise had a great time there..

A really spacious and cool pub located in sector 5. I liked the interiors a lot, low lights, wooden seating with lanterns and ropes for decoration. I wish it was a microbrewery by now as Calcutta desperately needs one by now. The alcohol rates are decent and the food quality is really good for the prices. I had the chili cheese toast and BBQ chicken wings and loved both. The mezze platter looked interesting too. 
I wish the service was more swift and the music a little toned down, the high volume makes it difficult to have conversations and is disturbing sometimes.

The place has already made a big name in kolkata.  The food which they serve is up to the standard of any other 5 star hotel. Service wise they are the best in the city. Staffs are very polite  .smart. quick with full of positive attitude . Music is just out standing. Ambience is like a county side pub. Interior is excellent .

This place is supposed to be a microbrewery, but it isn't, which is really a big disappointment. They serve liquor on Friday and weekends only, as they haven't got the license yet!!
But the food is upto the mark. We had ordered a chicken lasagne and cheesy mushroom. The garnishing and the presentation of the cheesy mushroom was eye catchy and tasty too!! 
Melting mushrooms topped with creamy cheese served on a beaker with tangy chili sauce.
We had also ordered a chocolate shake, a drink name lonely planet, and a hookah. The drink was very refreshing.
Would like to come here again for the hookah and the lovely cheesy mushroom 😍

I might agree with all the other positive feedback that other users have given , but if the bar really has so much preference towards the private parties organised in their premises, they must keep a separate sound proof section for such gatherings (where the party has the freedom to play any list of  songs in any language around the globe, BUT THESE SONGS CANNOT BE FOR THE ENTIRE GENTRY OF THE CLUB WHEN ITS NOT SPECIFIED AS SUCH A NIGHT ). Very biased and preferential environment 

Otherwise food was good but the music spoiled the entire time !

And I'm gonna say this too ! "Raize the Bar, you have for sure Raised the effin Bar !" Great going ! First ever Micro Brewery In Kolkata !

I'd like to keep my review short, so, here it goes.

Ambience - Full on 10 !
Staff - 10 !
Food Taste - An 8 ! The Biryani was bad. Really bad.
Food Presentation - Ten !
Music - Not Sure.

Must Try - Na Real and Lebanese Platter.

Word of Advice - Why Edm and Hindi Dance Songs all the time when you have the Legend in the background ? Should keep different genres on specific days. Biryani should definitely be improved upon.

The food is really bad and the rating is sky high and too exaggerated for a place with such average quality of food and dishes with comparatively such high price.
The ambience is really nice though and the brewery is a welcome change in the city and certainly the high point to brag about for the owners.
Seemed like a nice place to hangout with friends but definitely a disastrous place for lunch.
The service is also very bad and the waiters are lazy to say the least. So overall not a must visit type of place and certainly does not leave much good impressions.
Altgough the menu boasts of lobster and salmon but considering the fact that the normal dishes are so bad I wouldn't waste money and take any chances with the expensive ones. 
Would prefer Chilli's or other places of this sort.

We have been to this restaurant for lunch hearing very good reviews about the restaurant. But we were extremely disappointed with the food and service. It took almost more than 1hr 30 m to get the food and that too we did not get the complete order. After such a long wait and hoping that the food will be good, but the platter and other dishes were not at all good comparing the price that they are charging. There are much better options. The quantity they serve for a dish is not even sufficient for one person. We even had to ask for spoons and forks multiple times. And moreover they do not even give finger bowls. They should at least improve their service if not the food quality. We had order Seafood platter, meat platter, non-veg platter, grilled chicken with cilantro rice and some chinese combo. Horrible experience. I will not recommend it at all.

Raize the bar is a good sized pub located in salt lake. We reached there at around 9Pm on a Friday night and it was full to the brim but we somehow managed to get a table here. 

We ordered for a variety of things such as: 
Stuffed Mushrooms - even though this may sound mundane, the presentation was key in this case as the mushrooms were kept atop a flask which had Thai sweet chilli sauce in it to accompany the mushroom, it was cheesy and the sauce gave it the kick and balance that it needed, a great dish overall.
Cigar Rolls - We ordered the cigar rolls which were cheesy and even had cottage cheese in it as well, it was accompanied by a cheesy sauce as well which made it absolutely great, another great dish.
RTB pizza - This was, hands down, one of the better pizzas I've had in the city, it had sun dried tomatoes, goat cheese, garlic chips and sour cream. It was so tasty, we ended up ordering 2 of the same pizzas.

Overall a great experience with no complaints from service or quality of food. There are huge expectations from this place after seeing that they plan to open a full scale brewery down there. Cannot wait for that to open up.

location- indus tower ground floor. Parking facility available inside the complex. 
type of cuisine- cafe, hookah
serves alcoholic beverages. No happy hours. 

Pros- ambience, music, service

we ordered vegetarian kabab platter and french fries. The kabab platter was good containing aloo kabab, baby corn, brocolli, paneer tikka, two kabab seekh (all in quantity of 3-4) with two types of sauces; enough for 2 people. 

Good place to hangout with your gang. Loud volume, mostly played hindi tracks. Have a big screen so we didn't miss out on our Ind vs NZ ODI match. Service is good. 

food- 3.5/5

Another new pub in the Sector 5 of Kolkata, this place is quite refreshing among all of them. Already been here thrice in last 1 month and the loved each outing. Situated near Clge more, the signboard outside is quite eye catching.
About the food, almost all of them are delicious. The Chello kebab platter stands out of them. Other dishes like Fish Orly, Chicken Drumsticks, Mixed Meat Platter, Fish n Chips are also pretty good. Shisha can be availed while Drinks have been started recently.
However despite being a Microbrewery, they still have not started dishing out fresh Beer which is a shame (We all so very want it badly). Hope they can start it soon and will be looking forward to it.
The ambience and the service is nice, but the Music is sometimes too loud to have a normal conversation with friends!
Hope they keep it up and I will be back here soon :)

Great ambience, good food and great service!! 
We organised a get together here and it turned out to be a great experience.
The mud pie, falafel with pita and hummus, Chinese vegetables in hot Garlic sauce, cigar rolls, veg kebab platter are to die for!!  Pizza , crispy chilly baby corn, biryani, and other Indian food was also good if not great. Prices are a little on the higher side. But a must visit!!

Came to this particular place late night around 8 pm with some of my friends. Have been hearing the name of this place from quite a long time. Located at Salt Lake Sector 5 area in a very cool and calm location where you don't listen a sound but when you get in to this place its all Loud music. 
Ambiance looks pretty dark but it has been interiored really well. They also have alive band facility if i am not mistaken. You find some decent crowd here having drinks and Hukkahs.
Mostly famous for their Cocktails, Mocktails as well as Hukkah. As a non drinker i tried their Mocktails first in forms of Lonely Planet and Antiquity Blue. Both the drinks were very decent and refreshing. Served in the huge glasses. Both the drinks tasted extremely well and same till the last drop.
Then we ordered some of their Starters in forms of Pan Fried Chilli, Fish Orly and Basket of Desi. Pan fried chilli was spot on with the taste, it contained the flvours really well with the semi gravy. Fish Orly was nt too behind with the divine flavour. Bucket of desi was another good pick that everybody liked on the table. 
The sudden visit was really successful enough and i had a good time listening the loud music with the crowd keep coming in.

The best place to party in & around salt lake. Marvellous ambience & fantastic decor. The staff are very cordial, the wooden tables are nice and add to the sheer beauty of the place. The bar is well designed and the televisions are well placed as well.

We ordered the expresso Martini, the lemon mojito & a cranberry breezer, a non veg kebab platter consisting of four types of kebabs in quantity of three and the melting mushrooms. The kebab platter had Sarson Mahi tikka, tandoori prawns, chicken Reshmi kebab and Shashi lamb kebab. The fish was the best I have tasted till now, followed by the lamb and the prawn and chicken. The melting mushrooms was over-hyped IMO but tested fine.

The price is definitely on the steeper side and would wait for their in-house beers once they begin serving. Would definitely recommend a friend.

Review: Raize The Bar
A short section by section review, focusing on major aspects.

Location - 3.5/5
At Sector 5 Saltlake, near College more, though not very "reachable" from all parts of Kolkata, unless you have your own car, but at a quite neighborhood it is not so difficult to find.

Facilities - 3.5/5
We couldn't find any dedicated parking facility, but not too difficult to find one beyond office hours in that part of Saltlake. Can be a problem during office hours situated close to College more area (one of the busiest area of Sector 5) No entry fees, like most other pubs.

Ambiance - 3.5/5
In case of a bar/ pub it matters the most in my opinion. You well be welcomed by the huge entry with big glowing name by its side, difficult to miss even when one drives by the place. Entering the gate, at the end of stairs you will be attended by a small team, and will be allowed to enter the main area after providing them your details like most standard places. Lighting and interior is good, including many type of sitting arrangements to suit romantic couples to a group of friends, from sports & loud music lovers to the people who wants to have a conversation. Music is a little to loud for a place with no dedicated dance floor. Dedicated smoking zone and good washroom is a plus. Nothing exceptionally good in this front.

Drinks & Food - 3/5
Very standard, though not exactly feels very value for money as per the quantity-vs-price ratio. That said, it is really not a place for "food" at itself, though for having with drinks & hookah those are good. Taste & freshness of the food leaves nothing to complain about. If you are thinking of a quite evening with some friends, and a chat over a few drinks with some eatables, a budget of 1.5k+ per head is advised, unless you limit yourself only to a few beers.

Service - 4/5
The attendants are courteous and ready to help. But in busy hours, they take more time for serving/ repeating drinks than you would like.

Overall - 3.5/5
Standard pub with foods that are targeted mostly for having with the drinks and the hookah, the place will be liked by most of the young people with a good amount to spend, but strictly not for those who will like to end the evening with a proper dinner & some drinks for a reasonable amount of money.

Woah! Someplace has raised the bar for the standard eating joints in Kolkata. 
The collection of cocktails and mocktails is classic. A bit over priced though.
For the food. Hats off to the chef and the team who have worked wonders in the kitchen. The main course is absolutely wonderful, be it teriyaki platter or pasta or khou suey. Same goes for the starters. I didn't like the lebanese platter though. It was bland and not tasty. Crispy corns were perfect in taste. So was the pasta. 
The ambience and the decor is wonderful. A must place to visit. 
P.S. I thoroughly enjoyed the burnt garlic fried rice.

As per its name, this opening has certainly raised the bar for night life in the IT area of the town. The reception is okay but could be warmer.

Food and cocktails are good as well. The ambiance is uber cool as well. 

All in all, another fine place to groove and spend some time with the ones who matter. 🙃

Keep munching.

Ciao! 🍷

New block in the town. More precisely in sector 5. I was searching for good cafe/ restaurant around sector 5. And I suddenly got this raize the bar. So, it was my wishlist from then.

Location:
___________________
it is near college more of sector 5. On the ground floor of godrez water side building.

Ambience and decor: 
__________________________
we visited this place on the lunch time. So we felt the ambience is pretty decent.
And the décor is just superb. The whole bar having a wodden touch with haricane type light. Just amazing.
We pretend that it would be lovely to give a visit at night. But yes they have loud dj and total buzy dance floor at night.

So, if u just want to give adda, spent good time and date good food. Do visit in day time.

Now coming to the main segment food
__________________________________________

Starters:
-----------------
1. Sarsoo mahi tikka: one of the best fish tikka I have ever had. Amazing in taste. Bhetki fish marinated in mustard and yogurt sauce. And they served it with mint chutney. Just owssum.

2. Chicken teriyaki: another owsum. Grilled chicken in teriyaki sauce.

3. Calamari fritoo: air fried squid. This is just amazing. They served it with a sauce and French fries. Owssumm.

Main course:
-------------------------
1. Cilantro rice fresh mix bowl : grilled chicken served with corn, bean , veggies and cilantro rice. Good in taste. 

2. Grilled Kolkata bhetki: grilled 4 pieces of bhetki with tomato and almond chutney and vegetables. Owssum. 

3. Tangra kitchen platter: nothing special about this dish. Chili chicken with rice and vegetables. But the taste and food quality is just superb.

4. Crips skin Atlantic salmon: this is the 1st time I have tasted salmon. And it's very good in taste.
And the orange punch with the fish is just just amazing. 

Beverages:
--------------------------

The have quiet a good option in their mocktail also.

1. Calm down: it is a mix of oolong tea, cucumber and lime. Very flat. Did not like it.

2. Lonely planet: owssumm one. mix of guava, lime grass, reps berry. Amazing in taste.

3. Sangria red: made of red wine and small pieces of fruit. In one one out of the world. Just have it. Its superb.


An amazing experience with good service and owssum and tastey food. Great quantity and quality.

Yes, price is in higher side. Cost 4500 INR for 5.

To the management: keep it up. I was wondering what make the bar having such a amazing rating in zomato. I got my answer. Just maintain the taste , quality and price. :) Cheers....

This place has a nice ambiance and courteous staff. The food is good though not exceptional. However ,the prices for both food and drinks are steeper than other similar lounge bars in the same locality. Hookah prices seemed normal. Another disappointment is that the brewery is yet to be functional. So if you're a fan of those giant draught beer towers, boots and pitchers, be warned..those are yet to roll out. You may try out their cocktail pitchers though.I believe once the brewery starts brewing, this place will start drawing in the thirsty crowds by the dozens.

One of the most spacious pubs/lounges in Saltlake vicinity, located on the ground floor of Godrej Waterside. The interior will remind you of a micro brewery or a pub of Bangalore or Pune. Perfectly illuminated, widespread bar counter, high rise wooden chairs, loud music, young and vibrant crowd; altogether have created a perfect ambience to hang out with your friends and have a relaxing time over a bottle of beer. The food is outstanding here. Generally, pubs don't focus much on the presentation aspect of dishes but this place is an exception.
We had ordered :
#Melting Mushroom - button mushroom stuffed with cheese, served with a tangy dip. The presentation was quite unique, they served it on narrow-neck flasks, mostly found in a chemistry lab.
#BBQ chicken wings - the confluence of the smell of charcoal and BBQ sauce had created a mouth-watering effect.
#Lamb Shish Taouk - basically a falafel kind of dish, made out of minced lamb.
#Chciken Teriyaki - not the traditional kind of teriyaki. Tastes tangy... pieces of chickens are very succulent. A Must try here.
#Green chilly chicken - another highly recommended dish here.
#Chilly cheese toast
#Captain Morgan rum flavoured melting chocolate - must try in dessert
#Fried ice-cream with Caramel and Cointreau sauce - a coating of caramel and cointreau sauce on the scoops of vanilla ice-cream. A delight for ice-cream lover.
The pricing is little bit on the higher side. We, four guys, ate food worth of INR. 5600 but after levying tax, it came up to around INR 7200, which is bit creepy :p .
The restro staffs are very courteous here. Another striking feature of this place is that the serving-dishes are quite unique. They have got their own beer brewing machines which are going to be operative soon.

Well, they indeed have “raised the bar” in terms of food, ambience as well as service in the food business – and that also – quite significantly. I became quite amazed with the ambience once I entered this place – a micro-brewery which serves great food also. I don’t quite often enter pubs, since I don’t have cocktails, no sheesha, no funny business – no nothing……….

You get to see quite a lot of beer being promoted by way of posters and fancy idioms - beer being branded as “healthy”, beer keeping you happy, beer rhyming with cheers! – and what not. And why not so, as they produce their own beer! Mind it, this café based in the Godrej Waterside building, Sector 5, Saltlake could be the next hangout place for beer and hookah freaks.

They do have a small dedicated dance floor – but sadly, this did not find many takers. They provide majorly wooden seating but sofas are also available.

We kick-started with some tasty virgin-mojito brimming with ice cubes – some cold coffee also available, which I did not taste. Man …… they did make the mojito appear sexy – pudina and lemon pieces floating on top and a stylish straw drowned in it. Thereafter, starters started as follows:-

Babycorn – nice and crispy

French fries – okayish (I do not enjoy French fries too much – was tasty nevertheless)

Seekh kabab- very nice, but too spicy

Corn kebab – fine

Aloo kebab – A mediocre 

Phool gobhi kebab – good one!

Chilly paneer – tasty – mind the chilly pieces therein though

Pan pizza – nice to see a “RECTANGLE” (yes you read that right) pizza – topped with jalapenos, capsicum and mozzarella – but a very promising looking item definitely falling way below expectations!

Paneer tikka – Great (mind the huge size)

Mint chutney served along was pretty mediocre – owing to the bits and pieces of uncrushed coriander.

This was followed with some soft drink (Coke served in the name of Thumbs up). It is remarkable that I enjoyed fodder while watching the Olympics on the LCD atop a wall!

Moving to the mains, we started off with Tomato Shorba – crotons included as well as cream atop! Thereafter, Butter roti as well as tandoori and naans were served. Black daal was fascinating and paneer butter masala – sublime, especially when Raita was available. A decent salad range and condiments (cucumber, tomato, onions, yellow carrots, green chilly, lemons) as well as kachumer and papads were served. Corn palak was fine, so was kofta! I did not taste their Chinese items – Chowmein as well as paneer! 

Hyderabadi dum biryani was fine – though not as good as it appeared – had a balanced vegetable content. 

Once filled to the brim, we moved on to the desserts, rasmalai was fine – with great pista, kesar and malai content, but sadly I could have just a single piece of it. I had some chocolate cakes and then ….. dhan te nan …… MONTE CARLO – a simple path to heaven. Had a total 3 servings thereof …… mmmmmmmmmmmm. Who does not love a happy ending?

We finally concluded with some superb mouth freshners.

Service is exceptional and the staff try to satisfy all consumer needs – prices charged being on the higher side. I tag this place as a must visit and highly recommended. 

P.S.:- The hefty parking fees hurt me a lot (120 bucks), but I don’t really blame them as I understand that this is a rental/ leased property.

I also apologize to fellow Zomans that pics are dim owing to dearth of light at the café!

I m really unable to understand who has given them.to run a lounge or restaurant as they are unable to give water to their guest.
They are simply charging Rs 55/- for a 500ml bottle, when asked to give filter water they have a simple reply sir " pani ka taste kharab hae " 
If this is so why they don't supply mineral water free and above all what for the authorities or the so called food inspectors waiting for.

Went to this place late evening to meet an old friend. Very near to the hustle bustle of sector 5 area of salt lake, this place is frequented by office goers.

The brewery for serving fresh draught beer catches the eyes as you enter, but you soon get to know it is still not open. Anyway had the regular fare of Sheesha  and Chilly Paneer Starter. Sheesha was definitely very smooth and starter was fine.

Service was a little slow even though a handful of tables were empty on a Friday night.

Overall a nice addition to the city night life. Would love the Brewery to open soon.

This place is an addition to the few pubs that exist in Calcutta presently. Had been there on a Sunday. It was not much crowded thankfully. Maybe because people still are not much aware of its existence or maybe because commuting from there becomes difficult if you do not have your own vehicle especially at night. 

My friend and I had ordered one beer-a pint of Budweiser and chicken in some spicy sauce( I do not remember the name, was probably some sort of kebab)and a hookah. The chicken was very tasty. The beer was priced like any other expensive pub in Calcutta. The hookah was their special hookah but i did not find any unique  speciality in the hookah. Tasted like a normal 'paanch paan' served in average hookah parlours. 
The ambience was okay. But music was too loud. They are going to start their brewery very soon. So waiting for it. Once a visit is worthwhile.

L & T employees working in the same building get a 10% discount on the food bill.

Had been there last evening to grab a drink after what was a rather hectic 6day week at work. Though this place is there for quite a long time, I mean my last visit here was in April but they weren't yet functional then.
Yesterday my fiance was very happy and eager to try out this place and we were not disappointed. Its a very pumped up place to say the least, good music, great interiors and decor, brilliant food with an equally great service.

Being a Saturday, had to stick to veg, though was wishing was here on any other day after seeing what the menu has in store for all non veg lovers. A pleasure to the taste buds and a plethora of delicacies in Indian, Continental and World cuisine, this place is the place to be if you are looking for great food in sector 5.

Located in the Ground floor of the Godrej Waterside Building, the nearest landmark is college more in Sector 5.
My fiance and I ordered the Tangra Style Chilli Paneer for starters along with a Sangria for the lady and a cool beer for myself. The chilli paneer was really good in quantity and tasted great.

For mains, we ordered the Veg Spaghetti Aglio Olio and The Veg Khaosuey with Japanese Udon Noodles. Once again the food was simply awesome. One of the cities finest Aglio Olio according to Sananya and I believe her coz she has had the dish in almost every place that serves it. The Khaosuey was a visual treat as well as a treat to the tastebuds.

The food was so good that we absolutely had no issues with eating veg 😊😊😊.

The service was fantastic. All in all an experience that makes a mark. Coming back next weekend.

Though the beer hasn't start brewing yet but once it starts there's no looking back. Very creative interiors instantly uplifts your mood and gets you into the mood. They serve alcohol on the weekends so no better place to party now!! A must visit for all if u don't want to miss a too perfect place!!

Another excellent place! Food is delicious. Hookah is of different class altogether! We have our specials made every time we visit  this place. :)Music is super awesome and the ambience is great too! Deducting 0.5 because of the seats. After 2 continuous hours of hookah, we do not really need those high seats to sit up straight. A cozy seating arrangement would be most welcome.To summarize:
Food - 4.5/5Music - 4.5/5Ambience - 4/5 (do not really appreciate that minors are allowed in too even if there is a separate hookah and alcohol free zone)Staff - 5/5 (always happy to help and quiet friendly)Overall strongly recommended :)

Please please please bring alcohol. It will take out all competition in the whole of Sector 5. Brilliant, classy and elegant interiors. Music is of the right volume. And oh the FOOD. It was beautiful. We had non veg platter, pasta, pizza and hookah. All were perfect. Their non veg platter is the best I have had in a really long time. But please bring alcohol. I wouldn't even think of going anywhere else. Please keep up the good food. And oh yes the space is hugeeeeee inside. Still a little bit unused. Prices are reasonable. The bill did not give us a shock and yes the parking is a big problem there. Otherwise enjoyed a lot. :)

Located near the ring road in Sector V, Raize the Bar is a nice looking newest kid pub joining the the already overcrowded pub cum restaurant bandwagon. Catering primarily to office goers who drop in to celebrate happy occasions, to the henpecked employees badmouthing the bosses after a hard day at work or employees fuming over some bad co-workers this place provides the ideal foil of good food and drinks at standard pub rates. The food is real good quality which sets this place apart from the other competitors operating in the area. 

Cons- No valet parking available. Parking at Godrej Waterside @ INR 35 per hour burns a hole in the pocket.

The music blares at too loud a pitch thereby being a deterrent to have conversations while you sip and eat.

I have to say that sector-5 has heart winning places. This place is so amazing and the ambience again is so good. The food taste was fabulous and the melting mushroom, i m in love with that dish. They have lovely drinks and the taste is superb. The songs they played are just the ambience type and it did not bored us at all. A must visit place. Waiting for their brew's to be working.

Excellent place to have drinks & snacks. The music & ambiance sets up the mood. The Butter Garlic Prawn , the Pan fried Fish is to die for.... Even the chelo kebab was good enough to compete with any top restaurants out there.

This place is ideal for hanging out with friends... The microbrewery is yet to operate but the food is great. Even their mocktail menu surprised me quite pleasantly.... It's one of the best even in comparison to speciality restaurants... Music is good decor is nice. But I will advise you to visit for the food....it's one of the best I had recently ..

The place and ambience is quite good and sporty. Although drinks couldn't be served because of some license problem of theirs. I ordered 'moroccan cigar rolls' in the appetiser and 'Cilantro rice with fresh mix bowl' in the main course with 'Chicken Teriyaki'. In the desert had fried ice-cream with caramel crust and cointreau sauce. Enjoyed the meal to the fullest but didn't quite like 'Chicken Teriyaki' dish as it was too much toasted with the Japanese sauce.

I liked this place on my first visit. This place has a brewing facility but seems it doesn't operate. A very casual set up. Decent music too. I have tried hookah, appetiser and mocktails, and all were pretty interesting.
The only thing i don't appreciate, this place allows minors too... Small kids with adults.. This should not happen when a restaurant does not have a non-hookah sitting arrangements.

The food is good , decor is good . 
Good food , good music , good service - what else do you need ! 
Only downside there is not so much variety for a vegetarian. 
But ready to visit again !

Location-salt lake,sector-5

Just loved this new addition in sector 5.This place covers a large space  and has a seating capicity of around 70-80 people.As you open the wooden gate you would be awestruck by the interiors of this cafe .Along with great interiors this cafe has a very calm ambiance.The service they provide is also excellent.Though there was a little delay in serving the dish but the staff was very friendly.And the way they serve the food will force you to fall in love with their dishes.Now coming to the food,We had several items but the best was-
1.Palak aur Anardana tikki
2.Fried icecream with caramel
3.Lebanese platter

Food-4.5/5
Service-4/5

So one evening after fighting a horrendous traffic me and a friend reached this place. The entry and the seating arrangement is impressive. The ambience was really good and the usherer had a smile on her face. 

Since it's a micro-brewery we expected to be treated to some tasters before we zeroed in on our drinks. After a twenty mins wait the manager comes to us and informs us that they don't yet have the licence in place for the micro-brewery!!! He further added we could try out the other liquor and food...It's like visiting a hospital only to be told that they don't have any doctors yet, however; we could try our their canteen instead! 

A simple warning notice at the entrance should suffice to inform the patrons in advance. What a shame. My request to the management is to take care of this, though they might not pay heed...

Hookah was perfect with good and smooth smoke. Enjoyed a lot over there. Food presentation was spectacular. Only let down is alcohol hasn't started yet. I hope they bring it soon.

I just loved this new addition in Sector v area.  The wooden door opens up to a spacious lounge area. The well lit bar counter has a peppy feeling to it. The sad part being that the counter is decorated with mock tail bottles instead of alcohol. The wooden work decor adds to the look of the place. As you enter there is this round table with colourful chairs which I heart so much.  Then there is the other area which gives you a cabana type of feeling... Apt for trying sheesha with friends. The dj console and the large speakers are a wow factor. The Bob Marley image on the wall is a high in itself. The microbrewery part looks so dead as of now...  I so wish they start it at the earliest. We tried assorted vegetables fry and kalamari fry along with French fries.  I liked the way both the items were presented.  We were also offered three different types of mock tails... All of them were very refreshing for the thirsty souls.  The tiramisu at the end was an icing on the cake.  The staff is well behaved and had knowledge about each and every item on the menu. Would love to go to this place often. The pricing is reasonable as of now so if you are a foodie and an aficionado of hookah please visit and experience Raize the Bar.

They really need to raise their bar. We ordered a chicken terriyaki, tandoori pomfret, chicken kebab, hyderabadi platter, kolkata biryani. Though everything served was delicious, but the quantity was very less. The parathas were smaller then the size of a poori. We had consulted the waiters if this much was enough for five people. But unfornunately they could not suggest us properly.

After reading such good reviews, was really disappointed with the ambience. There was a dj in the house but still the music was like some ordinary background songs. Nobody dancing. Thought it to be fun place to hangout, but it turned out to be just a place for dinner. Hoping to have a better experience there the next time i visit the place.

The place is excellent to throw parties and to hangout with friends. Spacious and perfctly designed , it gives you a feeling of a proper pub (though they have'nt got the bar licence which is expected to be cleared soon). I was at the place with my friends, food is quite remarkble in taste specially gellati kebabs with kesari dahi amd chilly paneer , though quantity is'nt that food but fairly okay. Do not miss their OREO Choclate Shake ,its a pure delicacy.

"Raize the Bar" is Kolkata's newest offering. The place is spread across a huge space. They have their own brewery which will start operating in the next two months. The interior is beautiful, a lot of thought has gone into it. The place was quite full for a weekday lunch. They are famous for their square pizzas. The pizza was quite filling for the price they charged. Their another best item to order would be their fried ice-cream. Where a lot of big brands fail, these guys excel on this! Waiting for the brewery to start, will come back for more!! :)

I went there yesterday and I have to say that it is a brilliant place. The music was a little too loud for anyone who wants to sit and talk. We had to raise our voice to hear each other but the ambiance is electrifying. 
The food in particular was delectable and the service couldn't have been any more better. This place has been nicely done and was packed. We sat towards the interior which was vacant and had a romantic aura to it. 
Would definitely be visiting again.

Its a nice one. The woody interiors are great. Ain't got the liquor license yet, so the microbrewery is still virgin. They do nice hookahs. Pinch in pocket is 3.5 on scale of 5. And they don't add service charge on your final bill. Attentive staff. Food tastes good. Could have increased the portions of cocktails. Nice thin crust pizzas. Nice hangout place for techies.

Recently opened brew pub surprised me totally with its classy and catchy ambience. 
Interiors is nicely done and management is extremely good. Not all sections are operative yet but I liked their concept overall. 
Loads of items are there on the menu worth ordering. 
Tried Melting Mushroom which I liked to the core. A lil pricey considering the quantity. However,the presentation and method of preparing it compensated the cost. Along with the mushroom was a syrup which went really well with it and a bit of veggies. 
Next we ordered was Asparagus and Cheese Risotto and it was simply heaven. I still can't get over with the taste. Got it customized by asking them to add mushrooms which intensified the taste all the more.
Would like to try more of its dishes as I was really happy with the food. Coming back soon.

Visited a week back with office colleagues on a working Saturday. The place was pretty crowded considering it was a Saturday .  The interiors are awesome ,the music was a bit too loud for my liking ,but a lot of people might like it. Overall ambience was good. Some of the seats do not have a back-support so might be a problem for some like me,who prefer back support in their chairs.

Overall Ambience :4/5

Now coming to food and drinks ,it was a mixed experience. The presentation of all the food and drinks items 
Chicken Teriyaki : Was very good.The chicken was tender and the preparation was yummy
Watermelon and Feta Cheese: Was disappointed terribly with this, It was basically a few balls of watermelon. The cheese was barely present and was very disappointed  with this.
Mocktails : The place is yet to get its alcohol license. The mock-tails that we ordered  were 
Na Real Pani: As the name suggests was just coconut water presented in a container shaped like a coconut.
Lonely Planet: Loved this drink. Would definitely recommend to others

Food and Drinks: 3/5
 
  Would recommend fellow foodies to give it a try

After getting awesome reviews from so many people, I thought, I should visit this place and so, we planned a team lunch together in this place on a rainy Friday. My experience was beyond awesome. Food, ambiance, Service - everything was perfect. Location of this joint is inside Godrej Waterside Complex, walkable distance from  College More. After entering into the place, what I first saw is, numerous mini breweries are standing side by side. Unfortunately they didn't get licence for liquor yet, so for that, we have a wait a bit. Sitting arrangements are on the right side. It was bit dark inside,but enough to see menu cards. 
We were six people and we order 2 plates of non veg platter as starter and  Ami Kolkata, Kungpao Chicken Platter and A Trip to Phuket - one plate each as main course. Portion of each plate is quite good. Enough for 2 people. The best order was desert. We ordered 2 plates of Fried Ice Cream and believe me, it was just awesome. Each and every dish was delicious and the waiters eagerly helped us in selecting menus. Though our orders were not served very quickly, but it was  worthy to wait for those tasty mouth watering dishes. Bill was on around 4000. So price wise, it is bit in higher side, but again, you won't regret in spending money here.
Overall, it was an amazing experience for me as well as, for my colleagues. I would highly recommend this place to those foodies, who what to taste different types of foods. This place is worth a visit.

Date of Visit : 13/06/2016

Location : Located in sector v, saltlake inside the Godrej Waterside complex.

Ambiance : Ambiance is good. As you enter the place you see a big bar. Though it is yet to get the bar licence. On the right is seating arrangement. On left there is a place for private party. Wooden long chairs and tables gives you a different experience. Though the music was very loud but loved the music too.

Service : Service was prompt. They also helped in choosing the best dishes of the menu according to our taste.

Foods Ordered & Description :

Soup---->
Cream of Broccoli - The soup tasted group. Few chunks of broccoli enhanced the taste. It was served with garlic bread.

Starters---->
Melting Mushroom - Heard very good reviews about this. So ordered this on the first go. It came resting on chemical flasks which had tangy and sweet chilli sauce.  It tasted average to me. I have had better mushrooms items than this.
Vegetarian Kebab Platter - The platter contains Paneer Tikka, Bharwan aloo, hara bhara kebab & assorted tandoor vegetables like mushroom & babycorn accomplained with mint chutney, sour cream, papad and onions. Loved the platter. Bharwan aloo was the star. It was yummy.

Main Course---->
Desi Khana 2 - This combo contains dal makhani, malai kofta, chana masala and masala kulcha with papad, achaar and salad. This is good combo to try for those who are wiling to try Indian foods there. I dnt like chana masala that much but other items were good.
Wall of China - This combo contains chilly garlic noodles with stir fried vegetables and paneer sichuan. This combo is a must at this place. Awesome taste and varieties in the combo.
Veg Teriyaki Platter - Burnt Garlic Coriander Fried Rice with Green Asparagus, sesame teriyaki potatoes, babycorn, onion and tofu. This is a deadly combo. Yummicious items. A must try for those want to try something different.

Mocktails---->
Oreo Oatmeal Shake , Lonely Planet & Vir-Gin-Sing - All the 3 drinks tasted awesome and refreshing. Standing out was Vir-Gin-Sing. never had such lovely mocktails ever.

Overall, an amazing experience. It a must try place for the varieties they offer. Presentation is also excellent. You cnt be disappointed coming to this place. Highly recommended.

Seen a lot of reviews about this place on Zomato so decided to night out last Friday. We were in a group. The place is located in Godrej Waterside and can be easily reached. Once inside the ambiance is differently good with nice seating arrangement, albeit not crowded. We were given complimentary mocktails which was provided in really small glasses. Better glass size should have been there. The other ordered mocktails were provided in descent size glasses and were amazing. The hookah was well made, smooth. The starters cigar roll, mushroom were nicely served but the quantity was bit less. However the presentation madeup for the quantity. Coming to the main course items like Spaghetti, Risotto & North Indian - they were nicely prepared and tasted well but were again a tad low on quantity. Soft drinks were not served despite order until we completed our dinner and asked for serving them. Overall a good experience, except the fact that the quantity did not commensurate the price so this place is on the expensive side. They might get better once they get their brewery rolling. Most importantly DJ plays generation old English songs when latest ongoing hits/remixes ought to be played.

Nice posh place at the Godrej water side of sector 5.Easy to locate. A huge sitting area  Specialised in continental food menus.Neglible North Indian cuisines available.
Order- special meat platter,which came with a very delicious look.They claim that its sufficient for 2 people but i personally dint feel so.American Salmon was tasty but the fish itself had come in very small piece.
Value for money is.less.Taxes are as high as 25 percent.
Service- very good They will invite you cordially and the food is served pretty fast.
They also have a large microbrewery ready but are not able to start as they have no liquor license yet.They promised that they will start it soon within a month.
Decor is so-so

Came to meet a friend at sector 5-planned on boozing  found this great looking microbrewery ,was disappointed to know they dint have licence  for liquor yet. 
So we just had our dinner the Pad thai and basil chicken was nice, hukka was good.
I am not a dessert person my buddy told the pannacotta was too good.
not for boozing right now but a great ambiance and decor for partying once the place have licence.
meanwhile its good food at good price place.

Amazing experience at Raize the bar! It is one of the most upcoming and coolest places to be at. From a mind boggling ambience, to the explicitly luxurious and large variety of their global cuisine, to the aptly romantic dim lights,this place is absolutely worth it all.We were taken aback at the very grand gigantic entrance of this supercool bar cum brewery which is all set to blow your minds away. Not to forget the qwerky,personalised interiors and ofcourse the warmth and genuine hospitality of the staff will force you to revisit this place again and again and again! I genuinely recommend this place to everyone who wants to experience nothing but THE best coz I bet you oughtta fall in love with the place which has taken my expectations from other places to a complete next level.

Loved it! Oh God, how badly I wish the bar to open soon. Visited this joint for a team lunch on a Thursday… and it was a fantastic experience.

Every dish was mouth-watering… with clear winners being Oregano Crusted Chicken, Mixed Meat Platter and Fried Icecream. The ambience of the place also added to the extravaganza.

The only downside (and the reason for deducting 0.5 points) happened when they forgot to give the squid and the bok choy rice along with the Mixed Seafood platter. We had to ask for it in order to be served separately (but by that time, we had already finished the platter).

Hopefully, this place will receive a lot o limelight once the bar opens next month. And once that happens, I'll be one of the firsts to revisit and have a blast.

Raize the bar is a pub located in sector V in Godrej waterside. Place is a micro brewery but they haven't got their license yet. Ambience is good with loud music and LCDs for sports lovers. Though I am not a Hookah fan but they do have Have a great selection to choose from. We ordered garlic bread, pasta, pizza and some non-alcoholic drinks. Garlic bread is good but pasta and pizza are both very ordinary. Service is quick. Portions are quite small and place is quite pricey. Lack of alcohol makes the place less preferred.

A newly opened food joint comes with good food with all new brewing pub concept. We used to get an average food in almost all kind of great pub but believe me the food they served is awesome in taste.
Ambience wise it j's very simple and eye catching but only prob is that they played the music in very high volume but it may be liked by others.
They decorate the place with very simple manner but full of positive vibes.
Now lets come into the main show...the food...yeah taste awesome and the service e time from KOT placing to serve on plate time is also good.
We have ordered Green chilli chicken.. Yes taste very good as well as presentation.. Chicken are well cooked but again they didn't lose the juicy flavour inside...ordered bar-b-q chicken wings with perfect combination of bar-b-q sauce ans taste yumyyyyyyyyyy...I would also like the non veg platter... Overall a great ambience with with great experience... Little bit costly in side but no matter if you are 
getting a good food with quality service and awesone ambience...I hope management has already started more promo as the location is not in the middle of sec v...great effort will like to visit soon..

Located at Godrej waterside building.

 This new pub style themed place is a class-apart .

 The decor is pretty simple yet touching.  

 The food has really raised the bar with its variety and taste. 

You could start up with the melting mushrooms or the oregano chicken tikka or the Morrocan cigar roll, I must say a lot of emphasis has been made on the presentation and quality of food.

The Lobster thermidor is simply out of the world.

Desserts and drinks(though only non-alcoholic, as they haven’t got the license yet) are worth the try. Molten Chocolate Cake an overall favourite. 

 The staff is courteous, well trained and polite, will guide you through the menu well. 

 Pros - Location, ambience, Food Quality and Quantity, Courteous staff, Quick service. 

 Cons – On weekends reservation must otherwise you may not get a seat

A great place in the making! Sadly they are unable to start the brewery as they don't have the liquor license yet. Hookah lovers can try this place as well. I can review regarding the food only. It was quite promising with good quantity and palatable as well.The starters barbeque chicken,lime soda were up to the mark. The meal was quite sumptuous with the kukkad sukkad as well.The dal makhani and chicken dish were exquisite.I wish to visit this place soon. I am quite confident that they will snatch a rating of 5 from me next time when they are at full bloom with the microbrewery open.
@raizethebar Start it soon folks!

This newly opened and one of the coolest pub cum brewing station at sector 5 , impressed us on its first look itself.. occupying a gigantic space on the first floor of godrej waterside building with masculine wooden finishing and a glass pane giving a view outside , peppy numbers and shisha ( for now they donot have the liquor license) along with brilliantly cooked food.
I ordered for four dishes and genuinely recommend them all..
THE MELTING MUSHROOMS is an usp starter of this place coming with cheesy mushrooms on top of a small conical beaker with a red tangy dip.. which makes an outburst of flavours when taken together. Just that for 6 small single bite sized mushroom priced at 225++ is tad too high.
the OREGANO CRUSTED CHICKEN TIKKA was so juicy and moist tasted similar to malai kebabs ,could find no oregano gel flavour though , however it tasted amazing with the green chutney.
CHICKEN SALTEMBOCCA had three roundish breaded chicken stuffed with cheese and veggies probably , on an bed of potato mash , sided by satueed vegetables and topped with cream sauce.. good for people who avoid spices and oily food.
And the lastly the MEATY PIZZA was the showstopper of all.. perfectly baked thin crust rectangular pizza topped with minced meat, chicken sausages and great amount mozarella couldnot stop us gulping those 8 pieces within minutes. I am really satisfied with the staff service and the food as described was ridiculously overwhelming .
Hope to sit with beer mugs soon!

Amidst the hustle bustle of the IT City, this new microbrewery attracted my eyes quite a few times as it near my office and has a surprisingly refreshing ambience.

Though it was disappointing to know that they don’t have alcohol license yet, we were in a group of 6 and were sad about it, but hat’s off to the great service, mock-tails and superb food with courteous management team we felt as if at home .There was live screening of IPL match going on and the music was great. Late evening after change of light the place became mesmerizing.

We really enjoyed the gig and waiting eagerly to go there next week again. A big thumps up!! For Raize The Bar

The exterior looks so fab that you would love to have food out here. The taste and the price of food items goes hand in hand. The ambience too is excellent. We had ordred the kolkata chello kabab - that although doesn't taste as good as the one at Peter Cat but the preparation is quite good. The ambience was good and the behaviour of the staff was amiable. The only reason of me giving it 4 points is that the size of its tables - it is not at par to the normal table size. If you have kept your plate out there and a dish comes there's hardly any place to keep the same.

Was meaning to try out this place for a long time. Went there last night. Impressive Décor. I was really excited by the wide array in the menu. The RTB pizza is a must have and so is the Cheese Garlic Bread. The adventurous foodies can try the Khao Suey. Hookah too was pretty good. The Cold Coffee however was a little too sweet for the liking.

The best part was that the staff was extremely cooperative and friendly. They even made a shout out to my friend whose birthday we were celebrating. All in all a pretty good experience.

After an awful expereience, I drove to Raize the bar on another Sunday. Luckily they did not disappoint me this time. Mr.Suman the chef there took care of us making it a good experience. We had a melting mushrooms which was good, served very well and tasted tum too. The green chilly chicken was too good, the chicken was soft, the coating was perfect and tasted too good. The hookah we called for was decent too, not one of the best I've had though. The service was quick. The servers kept an eye on all tables always which was a pretty good thing :) best of luck Raize the bar :)

Location is nice 
The first thing you see when you reach there is the big glow sign boards and huge staircase and glimpse of the micro-brewery !
It's very Royal and sophisticated entry set up.
Once you're inside the lounge, the ambience is very very good !
Lot of space to walk around and looks comfortable and cozy.
Theme is nice, music, lighting and seating all are good, lot of segregated areas too.
There's also a no smoke/Sheesha cozy lounge comprising of comfortable dining space.
Music is really good, no Bollywood numbers as of now :(
Staff is courteous and service is prompt.
Sheesha is decent.
FOOD !! Now this is highlight !
Food is brilliant !
More than that the presentation is just very nice !
Lebanese, Italian, Chinese, Indian all four are equally good !
And mocktails are nice.

Not serving Alchohol as of now, soon they claim to start.

Highly recommended !

Located in sector - v, inside the newly build Godrej waterside complex. Extravagant place, amazing decor, excellent service. Parking is a problem. It's still a restaurant only as the liquor license had not been obtained yet. Food was very innovative, and the presentation was very creative. Quantity for starters were less. Quality of the food was hygiene. Divided in three sections, there is also a private party section. We had ordered Melting Mushrooms, Morroccan cigar roll, Makai malai soya ki champ in starters. And calm down in mocktail.

Parking can be a problem as the road outside is a no parking zone. Ask for availing discounts with your company's id card. Green chilli chicken was nice in particular. As of now they don't have license to sell liquor.

Quantity of the food can be improved.. Regards Indian food lovers they might be disappointed with the Indian platter as thou the taste fine but it's not even sufficient for a single person n def not worth the amt they charging for it.. Rest def one can try this place as it's a happening addition to the city..

A really extravagant place near Collage More. As soon as you enter you'll find the place quite welcoming. 
We ordered the Veg Manchow and Mushroom Cappuccino. Both were really quite good. The mushroom soup was really creamy. 
We then ordered Veg kebab platter, pizza rtb and another pizza. The Pizzas were great. Perfect thin crust pizza with very nice amount of cheese with pesto and goat cheese. I found it amazing.
We also ordered Risotto and nachos. Both were quite good. 
Overall everything we ordered was quite good. And I found the place really nice. Though I would suggest they should have a non smoking area.
It is a little on the pricey side. Though their pizza is worth it.

Ok. So finally made it to this place..to start with they dont have parking in the building (atleast thats what the building security told me)
So parked my car in the no parking zone :)

Place looks great...shud do gr8 once the liquor licence comes in.

Swanky items in the menu. loads of choices..but then how much can one eat ? ;)

Music was loud..in the afternoon (especially for the 2 occupied tables) had to request management to lower the volume,which they did ,promptly :)
Ordered the "cilantro  mix bowl"..it was refreshingly nice and ofcourse healthy :)
Overall good place..
Good service
Lovely ambience
Great location

Will do well..:)

I'm sure you must have noticed the pleasant changes and developments in terms of food and experience in our city. Food trucks, kiosks, gastronomical pubs, innovative desserts and more. What was missing was a microbrewery, brewing up local beer crafted fresh!

LOCATION & AMBIANCE-
Located in sec v inside the newly build Godrej Waterside complex, Raize the bar is a complete eye pleasing place.
Divided between four sections namely the seating area overlooking the brew machines, DJ console area and a dining section and a sprawling bar, this place feels complete.
Though here is the disappointment part. They are still figuring out the liquor license bit, but assured me it will be done in the first week of june.
The ambiance is amazing, love the cartboxes on the ceiling, the barrels that work as tables, the Bob Marley poster, the pop of colors with metal chairs and stools.

FOOD-
We went for appetizers, mocktails and main course. Here goes my experience!
• Basket of assorted fries- it came with French fries, onion rings, veg nuggets and potato wedges with a delicious garlicky dip. The fries were seasoned well and had the perfect crunch and flavour.
• Lebanese Platter which was presented well and was absolutely a wonderful dish to order #recommeded. Standouts were the cheese raraq which was gooey and stringy, the saffron dip which was killer ans the muhmurra which was tangy and garlicy.
• Melting Mushrooms were one of their recommendations and I am glad I ordered them. One of the best mushrooms I have had in a long time! They came resting on chemical flasks which housed their house made tangy and sweet chilli sauce. An absolute delight in the mouth, this one #recommended
• Na Real which came in a dried coconut. It had flavoura of coconut, coriander and jeera. Tasted amazing #recommended
• Virgin Madras which had a madras twist with curry Patra to the usual tropical flavour
• Bannofee which was a blend of toffee and banana flavour. It was just about okay
• For main course we tried their Biriyani which was prepared in dum style. It was served with curd and tasted very good.

SERVICE-
Was indeed very good and I was impressed with their attention to detail.

PRICING-
Considering the wonderful experience in terms of ambiance, food and service, the prices are justified and we paid a total of 1750 for our afternoon .

My best wishes to the entire team and I am definitely visiting again once the booze is on!
Cheers!

It's still a restaurant only as the liquor license hasn't been obtained, although the ambience is spot on of a typical brew pub
The garlic Chilli chicken appetizer was as juicy as it gets. The mains however was a mixed reaction. We ordered chicken saltembocca, grilled bhetki and lobster Thermidor. While the chicken had nothing more to wish for, the bhetki was ok ish and Thermidor was way too salty. .overall the food is better than most pubs but leaves a lot of room for desire as a restaurant

Raize the bar has raised the standard of the sector 5 itself! I bet, the moment you enter this place, it will get a smile on your face. Amazing decor. And to be mentioned specially, waiters are not dumb. They get things at once. Good food. We had ordered for a veg platter. It was sufficient for two people. Combos are pocket friendly. Sisha is nice. And and and, they ll get there alchohol license shortly,so the place has its own breweryy tooo!!! In short the place is must a visit.

Raize the bar- Kolkata’s new jewel- A microbrewery yet to brew it's beer

Food- A wonderful gastronomic experience which satisfies all the senses... Raize the bar has kept its menu very simple and has stuck to the original recipies,even the dishes in which they have innovated the flavours are quiet strong and there is no clash of the same,  and a unique dining experience.

Service-The service is great and the ambience suffices.

Will visit soon to try out the rest of the menu.waiting for the brewed beer eagerly.

to hang out. Out of all the dishes ordered by us, (3 occasions
already) all were made differently and a must try. I especially would recommend
the Rangoon noodles for all Thai food lovers and the Melting mushrooms
which amazingly also impressed the non-mushroom eaters too....The staff was
courteous and there was no issues with service as such. Hookah was good too.

With the brewery on, I’m
sure this place is alwazzz gonna stay packed.

This place is located pretty close to Sector 5 College More. Unlike its name and the visible brewery, the place has still not acquired it's license so no alcohol is available which is very disappointing and shocking. I went there with a friend and when asked for a table for two the female attendant initially took us to a seat that was squeezed between 2 with large loud groups. We asked them for an alternative to which she reluctantly took us to a seat for 5 and even said she'll ask us to sit at the bar stools once the crowd starts coming. This is honestly very bad service specially considering there were hardly any people then. Our displeasure was fairly evident since thereafter 2 much more amicable attendants attended to us.
We ordered as below:
Bull Berry-this could easily pass as strawberry shake
Foamed Green Apple Iced Team-the foam was unavailable
Moroccan Cigar Rolls- Highly recommended
Vegetable Platter-Pretty average

The Moroccan Cigar Rolls were amazing and it along with the male attendants are the sole factors behind the 3.5 rating. Otherwise this place had disappointed us abit
Hope you guys take note and grow better

Saw a lot of buzz about this place. Unfortunately for us the bar had not started yet. They will get the liquor license next month. So the huge brewed beer tanks stare at you from the glass door.
Located at College More Waterside building. A big bar with with a huge offering on the menu, food wise. Did not try any mocktails so won't be able to comment on them. 
The plating is done beautifully and pricing is good. 
We ordered a paan flavoured hookah which gave a bitter aftertaste plus I am not a hookah lover. 
First came the calamari Fritto. It was served with a kafir lime sauce and French fries on the side. The calamaris were fried with a poppy seed covering. The covering lacked seasoning but it went well with the dip. 
The oregano crusted chicken kebab was very soft and juicy. Definitely recommended but it had no oregano flavour whatsoever. It was more of reshmi kebab. The meaty pizza was rectangular in shape with cheese loaded on top. But the chicken and meat was very less. It looked as if it was sprinkled on top or given just for the sake of it. Naming a dish meaty pizza and giving so less doesn't justify it. The taste was good.

Raize the bar has definitely raised the party standards of kolkata....i was visiting Kolkata after 8 months and RTB was a pleasant surprise...the gastronomical pleasure of Melting Mushrooms, Na Real and the Chinese box were all too good for my taste buds...even the indian platters are must try...what i was truly impressed was the awesome decor...the place is divided in 3 sections and all 3 have a different feel which surprisingly gel well with each other....The decent mix of EDM,rock and bollywood pumps you up for a great evening....overall its a place to visit not just once....great experience...all this when their USP is not even operational...eagerly waiting for the brewery to get my spirits higher...

A grin took over my face the moment we stepped in..Spellbinding, hypnotic and mesmerised!! The ambiance is extremely mellow.. We settled in, and prepared ourselves for some exquisite gastronomical venture.. We ordered melty mushroom with chef's special tangy sauce- the presentation was resplendent .. The button mushrooms stuffed with cheese and when dipped in that sweet tangy spicy sauce it is indeed a beautiful experience.. 
We were recommended oreo oatmeat shake- and it is one of the best oreo shakes i ever had.. The texture was so right, not too sweet and heavy.. But light with that beautiful hint of oreo.. 
Then we had AMI KOLKATA- that is chelo kebab.. Well honestly we were not disappointed, it is definitely better than peter cat's.. The quantity was sumptuous!! Only one recommendation maybe they can ask before serving the sunny side up, because I personally prefer my eggs well done!! 
Rtb pizza- the pizza base was pesto sauce.. I am an ardent lover of thin crust pizza!! And i did enjoy binging.. 
The experience wouldn't have been so great without the staff.. Extremely affable..😊
Overall, it was a repleting experience visiting the place.. Raize the bar has undoubtedly raised the gourmet experience of foodies residing in city of joy..

Superb food. Each and every item is lip smacking. The indian platter named kukkar sukkar is amazing...the amount of rice is extremely less bt the dal makhani is best in town, and chicken tikka masala is too good. Only the quantity of rice they serve is very very less compared to other dishes. I have tried all items and all taste equally good. The chelo kabab, Indonesian gem is too good. The Chinese platter with chili chicken a d rice is awesome. Only the biriyani I disliked...it has dalda and the rice becomes sticky before completing. Anyhow the 95% dishes are superb. The taste is best in this sector v area..the interior and decorations are superb..the staffs are polite and well behaved. A must visit and regular visit for the sector v techies..
Update: Trip to phuket is a wonderful item with flat noodle and chicken. Very tasty. The Cilantro rice is an awesome preparation. The main disappointment was that Lately I had the kukkad sukkad..the quantity of rice they increased sufficiently, but the taste was horrible. In fact the chicken was smelling bad and the dal makhani was Blant with no taste. I am really disappointed as last time it was 5/5 and this time 1/5. I hope they maintain the previous quality and taste as it was. The fresh lime soda is too bad. I am reducing 0.5 rating for the not so good food I had in the last visit.

This place has its own brewery which will be operational in a couple of weeks, and then it's gonna surely create a buzz of its own. 
Looking forward for the brewery to be operational soon so that we Calcuttans get some taste of variety of beer!

This place was bookmarked since a long time, for two reasons, namely, the ambience and the fact that, it is amongst the few Microbreweries in Kolkata. (although they aren't serving liquor right now)

Location : In sector 5. In the lane next to The Institute of Engineering and Management. Right opposite to the PWC building. The name of the place is distinctly visible as you pass by, which gives you a feeling that it's a big, very expensive place!

Interiors and Service : Mind blowing wooden interiors. Very airy and spacious, the place. Plus one!
The staff is attentive and cordial, but slow.

Food and Hookah : I had ordered for Melting Mushrooms. They were amazingly tasty. It is a must try.
Hookah was well made.

Pocket pinch : It is decently charged. Neither too much nor too less.

The only wait is for the beer brewing to start. This place has the potential of becoming the next big thing in the Salt Lake area.
Visit this place and let your bars be raised! Cheers.

Mushrooms. The one strong reason to visit Raize The Bar, pre-liquor licence, is definitely for its Chinese mushroom preparation in the black pepper sauce and for the mushroom risotto. The guys have done a great job hiring good chefs for the food and the shisha is beyond par. Great work with the ambiance, but those quotes on the walls in the private area - well, whenever you undergo refurbishment, please do let me know for replacements of those images. Quick service, friendly staff, good food and shisha - well, what else does anybody want! Personally, if you stick to two cuisines at the most and experiment within those two, instead of stuffing in what is popular, I guess it'll be much better branding for you guys. Anyhow, great work. And get the liquor license fast!!!

A classic bar with such huge space in that official hub area of Sector V is a very surprising but amazing fact. The décor took my heart away. I have seen very rare places in Kolkata with such décor. The food was nice but what was better was the simplicity of the waiters working there. We ordered a pizza. It took time more than expected time. The waiter came to us and informed us that the chef did some mistake with the order and we can either wait for the new pizza or we can cancel the order. KUDOS to this attitude! I am visiting this place again :)

Nice place with good ambience of a pub . .  
Food was good.

only thing which struck me was the coal change charges "Rs 50 + taxes", Rs 300 + taxes is a pretty dearer charge for hookah and above that a single coal change coming at such a cost is a bit too much. I think they can check on that part. :-)

looking forward to the brewery.

In Zomato this is under newly opened cafe in Salt Lake so Planned to to make a visit to this cafe. Located 2 minutes walk from College More opposite to PWC building.
Its a pretty huge cafe with nice and unique ambiance . Menu items were pretty innovative and presentation of there food too is awesome.
Ordered Hazelnut Latte and somehow I was not impressed by its look but the taste was good. Apart from this ordered Lebanese Platter which was too good. Good place to hangout with your friends or on Date.

When you walk into raize the bar it's a like an old countryside pub which definitely has the old world charm.
The microbrewery actually grabs your attention and will be serving six different beers. (Surely a first for the city)
Chicken tikka kabab is something you shouldn't miss here and when a punjabi foodie says that you got to believe it.
A fitting name! :)
This place has literally raised all standards.

Raize the bar- it lives up to its name.
An amazing place to hang out. The decor has been well thought of. From ceiling to the bar, from smoking room to the beer barrel for the bill, all goes well with the theme. 
We ordered melting mushrooms and chilli paneer tangra style, loved the mushrooms and the presentation. 
Good food, good service. Would love to go again.

If you are looking for a brewpub in Salt Lake or rather Kolkata, this is the place to be! The first thing that strikes you as soon as you enter the place is the ambience. The plush wooden interiors with dim dangling lights make the experience unique and you won't feel like leaving the place at all. 

Coming to the food, we started with Melting Mushrooms and Green Chilli Chicken. The mushrooms were served in classy test-tubes and tasted well. The chilli chicken was juicy and I would recommend everyone to try this dish. For main-course, we tried their Indian dishes and all of them had been cooked to perfection. We ended our perfect meal with their rum flavoured melting chocolate which according to me is a must-have. The staff was courteous and helped us in placing the order, recommending their best dishes. All in all, we had a great time all thanks to Raise the Bar!

A very nice concept in Kolkata. Probably one of a kind. I really enjoyed the food here. The Mushrooms were really fresh and almost melted in mouth. Food served was as hot as it should be. Presentation of all items that we ordered was innovative and interesting. Ami Kolkata Chelo kababs were quite a treat. The Chicken in main course was soft, tender and very well cooked.

I am just waiting for those big steel canisters to start their magic...bar license awaiting.

We went to this new restaurant on 30th March, the day it was opened to public and as a matter of fact we were, the very first customers of the restaurant!
The shiny metal beer brewing tanks attracted my attention for a while and I was really excited to get a microbrewery in Sector V. While having a food tour in Bangalore last year, I visited a microbrewery called Big Brewski. The place was so so awesome that I started missing it after I returned to Calcutta.
Raize the Bar is the third (or fourth?) microbrewery in Calcutta, after Beer Republic and Country Roads. While the first two had managed to get their liquor license already, Raize the Bar couldn't. So, when we visited this place, it was only a restaurant, not a microbrewery in true sense.
Being the first customer had its own advantages! Executive Chef Suman offered us free cocktails and also free desserts (Sahi Tukda).
Food: We ordered many dishes ranging from Indian to Chinese and from Conti to Desi. Some of the dishes were really outstanding and some pretty average.
For example, Oregano stuffed chicken tikka which was soft, juicy and very tasty. But the similar chicken kabab in the Chelo Kabab platter was hard, dry and anything but tasty.
On the Chinese side, the green chilly chicken was so awesome that we kept on ordering it one after another, but the Kung Pao chicken in the Chinese platter was no better than any street-side cheap Chinese restaurant.
Their plating and food presentation were quite unique - most of the starters served reminded us of the Chemistry lab. Like the melting mushrooms were served on top of small glass flasks with the the sauce inside. It was nice indeed, more from the visual perspective than taste.
The cocktail was quite refreshing in the summer and the Sahi Tukda was just ok.

Service: All staffs were very cordial and helping but they clearly lacked the professional experience. Then had no clear idea of what's there in the menu, nor they could explain the differences between two similar dishes. Chef Suman had to jump in to save their day. Also, the staffs, who were probably more in number than us, messed up the orders. We were served (and charged for) a dish that we didn't order at all!

Ambiance: Nice and cozy. Good for spending the Friday evening with friends. They have a separate room which you can reserve for private parties for 30-40 people. The retro style light bulbs, the wooden floor and the view of the beer tanks created the mood. But the music they played were at least a decade old. I would recommend an immediate update of their music collection.

Price: Most of the dishes were expensive considering the amount of food served and the category of the restaurant. We had a group of 10 and the total bill was around 6,000. But keep in mind the free cocktail and desserts. If we had to buy those then the bill would have crossed 10k. And the amount of food was not too much or unlimited. So 1k+ per person (excluding any alcoholic beverages) for moderate amount of food in a non-fine-dining restaurant in Sector V was definitely on the costlier side.

Final words: Visit the restaurant for the ambiance, food presentation and some specific dishes. My advice would be, wait until they get their liquor license. Only then you will be able to enjoy the real microbrewery experience, without which Raize the Bar is just another average but expensive restaurant.

Food taste - 3.5/5
Service - 3/5
Price/Value for Money - 3/5
Ambiance and Décor - 4/5

Spent a match evening there. Enjoyed the place far more than the match to be honest. Their bar is not serving alcohol yet but their other concoctions do not fail you. 

Loved their mushrooms and the virgin mojito. The view from one end of the place overlooks a long stretch of road in the IT hub of our city and can actually make you start thinking about the City of Joy. 

There's a graffiti wall on the other end and the beer comics are rather witty. 

Yummy food, brilliant pub ambiance and commendable service !

If you're looking for places where you can relieve stress, have fun, and chill with friends, look no further! Newly opened Raize the Bar – Kolkata's premier micro-brewery is an unassuming hidden gem in Godrej Waterside, Sector 5, Salt Lake. With an enthralling bar which soothes the eye as you enter, the place is set to resonate an Irish pub-like feel. While the brewers are aligned on one side, a warm seating arrangement adorns the other end of the place – with the bar connecting them. The view from near the brewers can make you pensive about the City of Joy and then there are the whimsy wall posters which are sure to make you chuckle as you read on the quirks about all things alcohol.

Step into Raize the Bar and you will see how much emphasis they place on aesthetics. In an ambience reminiscent of the rustic charm of dining in the extreme comfort, it's everything you need after a long week, with its rough-hewn trestle tables and wooden stools, Raize the Bar brings you a molecular gastronomical menu of delicacies cooked by veteran chef Suman Chakraborty.

The menu is a carefully crafted selection of dishes which are best accompanied with beer and cocktails. Their twists and innovative plating of age-old finger food is sure to furnish every foodie's Instagram account and the hospitality is warm, to say the least. While it’s known as a good chill out spot, it is the pure decadence of the dinner menu that makes it perfect for a "Treat Yourself" night. Gather few friends, and expect to get your hands greasy. Be wise and order their amazing dishes to share.

I got invited for an intensive food tasting session which was also a part of ThinkQuisitive campaign. The menu was very selective and they are delicate pick of Executive Chef Suman Chakraborty. In appetizer they dole out Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup and as thirst quenchers they serve Na Real and Virgin Madras mocktails. Starters were; Melting Mushrooms, Chingri Chop, Green Chilly Chicken and Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka. Main course were also amazing, Pizza RTB, Spaghetti Aglioe Olio e Pepperoncino, Strawberry and Mint Risotto and Crisp skin Atlantic salmon. For sweet finale there was Assorted Dessert Platter.

We began with Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup, it was exciting and startling in both texture and flavour combination. It had just the right amount of spice and savour; rich & flavourful crab meat soup with a unique blend of aromatic herbs and cubes of mushroom, you might find yourself gulping it all up before you even realise. Shangshi Crab Meat and Mushroom Soup was an excellent appetiser of thinly-sliced crab meat, with flavours amplified by mushroom and special herbs.

This place flows with creative juices, both literally and figuratively, as their seasoned mixologists stand ever-ready to cater to every aspect of your mocktail / cocktail needs by customising your drink. In a completely interactive environment, drinks are personalised and crafted according to your mood and current preferences. As these mixologists are so attentive, the whole process leaves you feeling like royalty.

Tired? Try the Na Real mocktail, it’s a simple fresh coconut water mocktail mixed with a shot of shahi jeera and coriander. It's believed to keep you energised for much longer than regular coconut water. The Na Real here scores full marks in flavour and wasn’t overly sweet.

Virgin Madras - a combination of fruit punch with a touch of south India. It will make your thirsty heart thrilled with every sip. Unquestionably try their Virgin Madras for a unique and refreshing thirst-quencher!

A meal here demands that you order the unbelievably fluffy Melting Mushrooms, with chef’s special tangy sauce as your choice of dipping. The crunch of roasted cheesy mushrooms brings this dish to textural perfection, leaving you on a high. For starters, definitely order the Melting Mushrooms with tangy dip — infused with a generous amount of cheese, mushroom lovers will love tucking into this!

The Asparagus, Tofu and Shitake Spring Rolls — long sticks of crispy fried spring rolls cut in half, shaped like nail protectors — was unique (and Instagrammable) but a tad too gimmicky.Nice surprise and it was unbelievably funny. After the first bite, the whole thing just vanished in my mouth.

Be sure to order the Chingri Chop! These bite-sized soft minced shrimp with spices were fried to a perfect crisp — you won't be able to stop popping them into your mouth! Bring a date and start the night by sharing the Chingri Chop with the creamy dips. It was really just endless, so soft yet crunchy and even better being warm.

The Green Chilly Chicken was excellent as well: cooked flawlessly, sliced chicken tossed in coriander & lemon grass and served hot. It was spicy to the nth degree and perfectly toothsome, chicken pieces were juicy and tender. If you love tongue twisting taste, don't miss their Green Chilly Chicken — it's so darn satisfying.

The Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka was a true flavour bomb, a gourmet specialty in which western flavor of oregano gels with the succulent Indian marinade.The Oregano Crusted Chicken Tikka was a very well executed piece of charcoal-grilled tikka – charred to perfection, wonderfully tender and packs a punch of flavour along with the accompanying pudina curd dips.

I always search for crusts that seemingly envelope the toppings, the pizzas here were all about that thick, airy, chewy crust. Yet somehow, its center was thin and topped with fresh, high quality ingredients and if you like unique toppings, you're at the right place. Go with a hearty appetite because you won't want to miss the Pizza RTB, umami-rich goat cheese and herby base, garlic chips and pesto, with sun-dried tomato to cut through the richness — perfect for vegetarians. The crust here was moderately thin, charred in all the right spots, and chewier than you'd expect — but not in a bad way.

The Spaghetti was just fantastic — seemingly pastoral, yet elegant in execution. Go for the Spaghetti Aglio E Olio E Pepperoncino, an exceptionally done prawn spaghetti with a light tomato, garlic, olive oil, chili flakes, rocket leaves and seafood stock base that imparts a ton of flavour without being heavy. The Spaghetti Aglio was another must-order you should share, prawn spaghetti packed with prawn that will bring you right to the ocean. The Spaghetti here will leave you begging for more.

Dig through the strawberry to find a bed of Strawberry and Mint Risotto, creamy with cheese and peppered with sweet and sour pieces of strawberry and fresh mint leaves. Strawberry and Mint Risotto - combines the exotic flavour of fresh mint leaves with the familiar texture and sweetness of strawberry, could easily draw crowds of Risotto lovers. It was as comforting as it is pretty, but as it tends to get a bit rich, you might want to share this with a friend.

Now, dig in to the final main course — Crisp Skin Atlantic Salmon served with orange panache. Indulgent, rich, and slightly creamy from the uni, the flavours of the Atlantic Ocean will explode in your mouth. The crisp skin Atlantic salmon was definitely not to be missed– think perfectly cooked fish filet with olive oil and topped salt flakes, served with potatoes and salad leaves. If you feel like something light for lunch, try out their crisp skin Atlantic salmon, a gorgeous version of a slow cooked salmon that makes you feel like a queen/king.

Leave stomach space for their Legendary Assorted Dessert Platter, which was worth every calorie. First, try the Kahlua Flavoured Mascarpone Cheese Cake— the unconventional pairing works because of the natural sweetness of the Mascarpone Cheese. The Citrus Panna Cotta with Mixed Berry Coulis, served with freshly squeezed lemon juice and raspberry-orange sauce, makes an excellent dessert, especially when paired with a glass of the Na Real. The coconut water cuts through the mix berry's acidity while adding a hint of natural sweetness. For sweet finale, go for the Captain Morgan Rum flavoured Melting Chocolate; prepared tableside, the sweet, buttery, citrusy and slightly boozy treat was guaranteed to tickle your taste buds!

The food speaks for itself, and it’s no surprise with acclaimed celebrity Chef Suman Chakraborty heading the culinary team.

There’s no better place to bring your favourite client or that special someone who loves delicious food. While the dishes may look it, they are actually rather placid on the spice, which means you don’t have to rule out this place even if you’re dining with little kids or the elderly — just as long as they can stomach some heat. This is the kinda place for those who want to have fun with their food, certainly not for biryani lovers! Come for a fun date or a night out with picky friends.

An amazing place to visit with friends... The ambience is kick-ass, location is convenient and above all they have a huge variety of mocktails which breaks the boundaries of the stereotypical lounge. Must mention the kind of music played, it just sets the mood... Also the add on benefit is the live streaming of cricket matches on big screen.
