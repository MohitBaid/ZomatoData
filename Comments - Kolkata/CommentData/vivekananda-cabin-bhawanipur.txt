We four took fish kobirajis and mixed noodles and chicken moglai.. 
Mixed noodles was good with good amounts of topping.. 
Fish kobirajis had good quality fish but were very oily.. And the chicken moglai had shredded chicken inside which was also very oily and very tasty... Prices are very much on the lower side.. Ambience is ok and place was a bit cramped.. A good experience nevertheless :-)

Vivekananda Cabin is possibly the most crampiest place to eat in the zone... very small... basically a roadside eatery with seating facility... you get what you pay for... so...its okay

According to the food price I should say the food is good. Chilli chicken  dry is awesome. Rice preparation is good. Cheap and good food. In lansdowne market.

These people are pure liers. In zomato it is given that they provide home delivery but in reality whenever you call them they say there is no home delivery. If they cannot provide home delivery why the hell did they gave zomato that they deliver the food to home? Food is also pathetic. I suggest you to go to a neighbouring place beside this idiotic place which is bangasree restaurant.  Bangasree is atleast better than this place .

It's one of those subtle, unnoticed joints of Calcutta! Superb Chinese food (Indian style). You can also try the fish fingers and fish kabirazi etc. It's super cheap when it comes to the pocket pinch. I would suggest take away, as the place looks a little shabby and low maintenance.

At times you may find yourself being satisfied with the most finest of the restaurants which may fulfil your hunger. But sometimes even a roadside snack or tea will Linger your tastebuds to the max. This small cabin is that small address. You can eat your heart out. Even though you have to share your table with someone else, the food is over the top. Sometimes happiness comes in small packets. I love the food here. The veg soup and egg fried rice are personal favourites.

The food of this place is not up to the mark. Once i had chicken biryani here and it was like having bhat and mangsho. Where did the biryani go? Most of the dishes are poor in taste. The only good dish here is the chicken masala which is undoubtedly delicious.

As a food blogger we often have these petty inhibitions about small road side stalls. But that is totaly unjustified...food has no boundary or class.....food is either good or bad...and i was amazed at the quality and quantity of food which is garnered at this Joint. A small shady Road side joint. But for a small price it offers good quality and quantity of food and that mesmerised me. I had ordered a Mixed Chowmein one divided into half and a full garlic chicken. The chowmein was huge in quantity the chow itself was of impeccable quality with chicken egg prawn and veggies cooked to perfection and it tasted good. The Garlic chicken to my surprise was given a smoky flavour and the chicken was actually good chunks. With a cold drink which they got from outside on our request the bill came to 170 bucks....and we couldn't finish our chow and chicken which was again packed. Customer service was at par with any five star.Over all...I WAS SURPRISED AND HAPPY!!!

I used to come to this place with my parents when i used to be a kid...some 25 yrs ago...my parents told me that this was one of the very few place that sold quality chinese those days, mixed fried rice was INR 18 and chilly chcken boneless was INR 22 then. So i went there yesterday to get some take away and was amazed o see the price...INR 50 only for mixed fried rice and chilly chicken each....extremely reasonable...so got them for dinner and must say that the CCkhn was excellent...8 big boneless pieces...was a little dissapointed with the rice..the quality of rice used was perfect but just lacked seasoning and flavors....may be they need a better cook but i will surely get the CCkhns next time....worth as a snack with drinks or a chilled beer...

I have tried food from this place because its really next to my house and yes very cheap. Of course this not a proper restaurant, hence the 'cabin' in d name, so u can't be expecting waiters in uniforms and well decorated infrastructure. This is a very average place bt produces good local food. I love d chilli chicken and chicken pakoras which r made in very local style, the kind you want to eat at home wid a group a friends. I wud advice to bring d food at home and eat though. Overall its not unhygeinic or anything so u can give it a try. Also dnt go very innovative on d menu. Try the basic stuff like I mentioned above.

This is a wonderful place for eating out for people who love to have value for money. Ideal for college students and couples who do not want to spend much but enjoy the time and food.

I agree the ambience is bad... Basically a low class eating place.. But considering the price and quality and quantity of food... I am very satisfied... Last but not the least.. Superfast service... Rs 100 is enough for 2 persons..

I once took away food from here,,,,food quality is very average and nothing special...ambience is very ordinary... Prices are affordable. The biriyani was not good. the chinese dishes like chowmein and chilly chicken was most ordinary.
Only the good one was  fish fry. Service is slightly slow. It is located beside Monginis near Lansdown Market. 
The Chicken Pakora was okay...quantity is appropriate for 2 people. 2 from my side.

Well this one has nothing in it......no good food, horrible staff, bad ambience, ordinary quantity etc etc. Honestly I knew this place is bad but I still went for 10 mins so that I could write a review on Zomato. This one is located almost next to Landsdown Market on Landsdown main road. Looking from outside only you will know that this place has absolutely nothing to offer. Firstly, the place is very very dirty and there are hardly 4 tables. The food taste is ordinary which you can cook yourselves. The quantity is ok but yes the prices are very low. 
Overall I rate it 1.5, I feel though this place is damn cheap you cannot come here for a meal. So don't even think of coming here and trying their food.

"Vivekananda Cabin" the name resonate a chord in my inner psyche like a happy and fond reminiscence of my childhood. My brother and I, whenever, till date (we both are closing in on our half centuries on mother earth) get lost in the nostalgic memories of our days as children in the then Calcutta without fail, eminently remember Vivekanda Cabin. We as children were given 50 paise per day as bus fare to & fro for school. Both us brothers used to go walking one way to school and save the 50 paise once in a while till we would accumulate Rs.5/-, the price of one plate of Chicken Chowmin in the early 80's. This plate was cherished by both of us by splitting the same into two equal shares (equal shares??? That's another story to tell, hehehe). I still very vividly remember telling the waiter/cook, "Dada ektoo beshy chicken deben, amra dui jon aachi" and sometimes we were rewarded indeed. After those days, both us, brothers have traveled to many a countries, including China (where this dish is supposed to have originated from) and eaten Chicken Chowmin (otherwise called chicken noodles elsewhere) but no restaurant has been able to replicate the taste of Chicken Chowmin on our taste buds like the taste that we used to take pleasure in at the Vivekanada Cabin. This Cabin has been there, probably, for over a fifty years and we wish them many more successful years.

I have not eaten in this restaurant but again got it home delivered.since I m not a guy from calcuta I need to depend on these restaurants atleast once a week to ward off my cooking skills  :). their food is good.loved chilli chicken though they cook it completely desi style or may be u can say completely their own style.even roomali rotis and tandoor rotis are good.never tried other items but recomend chilli chicken in desi flavour!
