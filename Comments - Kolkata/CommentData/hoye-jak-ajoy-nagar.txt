This place has opened recently. The menu is quite different. They are trying to give you the best of food from across Kolkata. 
Rating the place based on the home delivery that was done yesterday. The service was prompt and staff was friendly. Order the macher (fish) chop. Good stuffing and the fish didnt smell at all. Looking forward to trying out the rest of their menu in the coming days

Simply awesome! Definite place for foodies! 
You should definitely try the chicken cocktail, crispy chilly babycorn and fish items (chop, fry etc)
You wont regret it!!!
