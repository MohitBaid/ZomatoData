A place well suggested to avoid and should be considered only if you are left with no other choice. Still, I'll suggest ordering from outside and have it at home. One of the worst creepy places you'd find in town and this would suit the frustrated guys looking for a way out. In practical language, this is a desi dance bar and the service and the food sucks. The prices doesn't suffice for a place this bad.

I'd not at all recommend this to anyone.

Stuffy, over priced and one certain place to avoid..parking is a pain...even though food price is high but the quantity is too less to satisfy stomach...

Again if you are a frustu  only then  go there . VAT-69  which  costs   rs 200 / 60 ml peg elsewhere  costs here rs  400/60ml peg . this is a dance bar with girls dancing & taking money from  clients . food is also costly a fish item here would cost you anywhere between rs 180 - rs 250  per  plate depending upon your choice . overall my verdict a certain AVOID unless if you have never seen girls dancing in front of you . extravagant  alcoholic prices coupled with  VAT & service  tax makes this place too costly in my opinion . if you are from the locality better go to AR han thai near bentinck street in esplanade . you will get your money's worth .
