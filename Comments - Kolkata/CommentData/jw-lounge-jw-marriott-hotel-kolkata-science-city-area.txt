Visited the JW Lounge today and absolutely loved the experience. The olive & Mezze and malai paneer kebab we my choices for refreshments, both of which turned out to be really good in taste and served hot and fresh along with a cappuccino and green tea by the very friendly staff Zeeshan and Mahesh.

We ordered the Mezze Platter, their cottage cheese kababs and cappuccino. Everything met our expectations.
We asked Mahesh for an extra chocolate cookie, and he got us four more. Their cookies are really tasty.
Their service is good and the ambience is very serene. Must try!

JW Lounge is my favourite place to hang out in Kolkata. Love the salads they serve and the tea options they have in the menu. The staff is very warm and make you feel at home; my interactions with Roshni, Krishan and Zeeshan have been really pleasant. Whether you love to have a glass of wine or a cup of tea, all by yourself or share it over a conversation, you would feel very much at home.

Visited the JW lounge twice recently. The snacks here are not too bad and they make a decent hot chocolate, provided you tell them to make it strong. The cookies which they serve are amazing and hazelnut cake is a treat to the mouth. However the best part of the entire experience was the courteousness of the staff. We were served by Zeeshan who did a tremendous job. Really nice experience.

I always order Kathi roll and Cold Coffee with Vanilla Icecream in most lounges I go to. But the Kolkata Kathi roll is one of the best that I have ever had so far... Juicy, succulent, not too spicy but tangy enough... With the pungent taste of mustard oil... Eating it was a little messy if you‚Äôre out on business, but absolutely worth the effort... The world class JW service (Mahesh and Team) and the luxury ambience adds to the impact... Whether for business or for pleasure, do visit the JW lounge and do try the Kolkata Kathi roll... Add a bottle of Himalayan mineral water or Kelzai Vulcanic water for impact... If you like it, bless me, if you hate it, troll me on Twitter...

First off, beautiful decor and ambiance. Seating is elegant but also comfortable. The food at the lounge has always exceeded expectations (favorites being the Punjabi Murgh Bhatti and the Molten Chocolate Cake - which is to DIE for), and the drink selection is quality.  My favorite element however has to be the kind and attentive staff - as they go above and beyond to establish personal connections with the guests and make your experience enjoyable! Mahesh, Roshni, Ipsita and crew have taken continuous care of myself and my colleagues during our extended stay at JW and we have enjoyed every minute! Cheers to the staff and management!

I have spent 3 months at JW Marriott and many, many evenings at the JW lounge.  The staff is top notch - fantastic service and amazing drinks.  Mahesh makes an incredible dirty martini, and has so many other great personal creations.  The food is good too - the murgh bhatti chicken is phenomenal and so is the chocolate cake and mishti doi.  The best thing is definitely the staff though -- when I return to the US I will absolutely miss the company of Mahesh, Rahul, Roshni, Pooja, and Sukdeb.

Located to the right,of the entrance to marriots this lounge is a perfect place to chill with friends over a bottle of beer or a large peg of single malt whiskey on the rocks. 
Visited this place by default as vintage asia was sold out for the day but this actually turned out to be a better bet.
Ordered a glenlivet 15yrs old on the rocks and glenfidditch 12yrs old on the rocks. 
For food ordered
Chicken caesar salad- they forgot to add baby tomatoes to the salad and we had to ask for the balsamic vinegar and cold pressed extra virgin olive oil.
Punabi murgh tikka- this set the right tone for the evening, the tikka was tender juicy lightly spiced and very tasty.
The cost is reasonable for a 5star lounge.

Imagine a rainy evening when you are having steam hot Tea along with Pakora and other munchies. Then there are people (or may be a single person) whom you like to give you tea company! Now Imagine, you are actually frying the Pakora or Samosa or¬†Ghoogni or any damn thing or may be you are responsible for making the tea! Do you really want that kind of Mansoon tea that too just for 499++ per person at JW Lounge!

Flavored Tea & Assorted Monsoon Centric Munches @ JW Lounge - JW Marriott, Kolkata ‚ò∫

Food Event: Monsoon Chai Evenings

Venue: JW Lounge at JW Marriott, Kolkata

Duration & Timing: 1 Aug - 31 Aug, 4 pm - 6 pm

JW Lounge is the 100 seater open seating area, that covers a vast expanse of JW Marriott's ground floor based lobby area, designed on the lines of glitz and glamour, as well as, space and serenity.

Monsoon in Kolkata is synonymous with hot cups and kulhars (disposable clay cups) of tea accompanied with assorted pakoras, bhajias and roasted bhuttas, doubly enjoyed by people who consume the same, sitting in their covered verandahs or in the shade of roadside tea stalls, amidst the musical pitter-patter of the ongoing rainfall.

Since JW Lounge's outer enclosure (towards the roadside) is not made of cement and concrete, but glass, which is covered with a sheath of metallic mesh, the lounge offers a lovely panoramic view of the city outside, as well as rainfall, whenever it pours!

Keeping this specific architectural feature of JW Lounge in mind and the monsoon nostalgia that it is bound to bring to the city foodies, the culinary team at JW Lounge has launched their ongoing food event, Monsoon Chai Evenings, by curating two reasonably priced Monsoon Chai Platters.

Each Monsoon Chai Platter entitles you to get - 1 flavored hot tea, 5 savouries and 1 sweet. One of the savouries in each platter is available in both veg and non veg options.

The selection of flavored hot teas comprises of - ginger, cardamom, cinnamon or bishop‚Äôs weed.

I opted for Bishop's Weed aka Ajwain flavor, which got me a rectangular metallic tray, neatly laden with - a white bone china kettle, a bone china sugar sachet holder and a ceramic kulhar.

The tea was piping hot, but I could not make out the head or tail of ajwain flavor in it. Perhaps, I should have remained loyal to my ginger flavor. The tea tasted OK.

Sweet and savouries of Monsoon Chai Platter 1 comprise of - Vegetable Vindaloo In Portuguese Bun (also available in non veg version), Brie Aur Mirch Ki Potli, Inspired Vada Pav With Lassan Chutney, Ghughni On Beetroot Masala Tart, Jar Wali Papdi Chaat and Soan Papdi.

The hero of the aforesaid platter was 'Jar Wali Papdi Chat'. Served in a cute lidded glass jar, the Papdi Chat was crisp, apt in portion and a fine balance of sweet and tangy chutneys. Boiled potatoes were cubed and not mashed. Overall, the dish tasted excellent.

The bun in 'Vegetable Vindaloo In Portuguese Bun' was mini hot dog shaped, but quite different in taste than the usual buns. Upon enquiring, I got to know that it's dough is refrigerated overnight! The filling herein was expectantly nice and spicy. The bun tasted good and seemed a little addictive to me.

Other dishes also tasted nice.

Sweet and savouries of Monsoon Chai Platter 2 comprise of - Subz Samosa With Masala Mayo (also available in non veg version), Makai Masala With Pudina Chutney, Nimki With Tamatar Chutney, Macadamia Aur Kaju Pakora, Parippu Vada With Carrot Manga Koshambri and Pista Mawa Barfi.

'Nimki With Tamatar Chutney' was the hero of this platter. The Nimkis were Lavash shaped and oven baked. Hued in a shade of yellow-orange, the Nimkis were crisp and relatively healthy. They came topped with a thick serving of Tamatar Chutney, which tasted delicious. It was one of the finest tomato chutneys that I have come across till date. If anyday, the establishment decides to package and sell some, I would be one of their first bulk buyers!

'Makai Masala With Pudina Chutney' was a cute adaptation of the usual roasted Bhutta. Herein, the full sized corn cobs were replaced with grilled and seasoned babycorns. They tasted nice and healthy. The accompanying Pudina Chutney was also nice.

'Macadamia and Kaju Pakoras' were bite sized, crispy and crunchy. We are quite used to Kaju aka Cashew Pakoras, but pakoras out of Macademia Nuts seemed a novice attempt, which fared well with the taste buds. Both the Pakoras tasted good.

Other dishes also tasted nice.

So, next time you see 'tip tip barsa paani', get hold of your 'raja or rani' and head off to enjoy flavored tea and assorted monsoon centric munches at JW Lounge. Just ensure that the clock reads between 4 pm - 6 pm.

Price Per Platter: Rs. 499/- (all inclusive)

Went in for a Casual Evening Coffee At JW  Lounge ,
Well We Ordered  Cappuccino And Chocolate Cookies !
Cappuccino was good , 
But the cookies were too very sweet , didn't like it much !
The Worst Part Was The Service,
Had to call the waiter several times and then he responded.. not expected from a 5 star category brand..
Ambience Was Good and Comfortable.. !

Came to this place post a wonderful dinner at Vintage Asia and oh goodness, I was so so so disappointed! This is the worst place at J W Marriott Kolkata. Be it in terms of service and food. I am a teetotallers for which I came here to try out the desserts on hearing rave reviews about them. I have never been so disappointed with them at a five star property. 
Firstly, the service. It was pathetic. We had to find our seats ourselves and nobody came for assistance. On settling down, we literally had to call upon the waiters to take the order. There was a guy, whose name was most probably Sujit (with goatie beard and spiked hair), he was very rude and arrogant and tried acting really oversmart. Didn't quite like his attitude. 
For desserts, we had ordered a Berry Classico planning to order more. But the taste of it discouraged us pretty much not to risk other desserts as well. The smell of gelatin overpowered the taste of the dessert. Strawberry ice cream served with it tasted like the ones available at local shops. 
This place is not at all recommended. I am never going to come here again. I would suggest not to come here again for trying even once as that will be a total waste of money - quite a lot of money! 
That's it!

Frankly, I love this place. With full of natural sunlight pouring in and tea/ coffee and finger licking snacks at a pocket-friendly price, it's a sure hit. We were invited for a tasting session of their all day tea-snacks menu which is there till 31st August. At 499/- all inclusive, this deal is quite a stealer. It includes choice of tea/ coffee (coffee is served with a dash of soda separately as palate cleanser, which is nice) and a platter full of goodies (veg/ non-veg variety). The papri chat is seriously good and so was the twisted vada-pav (pav bread slices are put inside the vada). Samosas were okay-ish, wherein the kaju pakoras were great.¬†

Nimki with that hoime-style tomato chutney is highly recommended and should not be missed. From the tea variety, I've tasted the Ajwaini tea and Cappucino, both of which were good.

Amazing place with perfect combination of ambience, food and service. We went for a sunday brunch at J W kitchen..but the place was full. But the staffs were courteous enough and offered us table at lounge with the service and and menu of J W kitchen. The girl Rupali (hope I am mentioning the name correctly) at the Lounge was helpful enough to make my parents comfortable and made our experience a good one.

Stepped in the JW Lounge after a swim, for a coffee and a small bite. Obviously, being one of the latest 'stars' in town, it was very glitzy and daunting at first, though once in, the ambience was warm and embracing.

Nothing can be said against the location (9/10) as it is extremely well-situated. The minor point-loss is due to the rather ugly and convoluted entry, though it was probably not Marriott's fault (some road construction work was going on). Ambience and decor get a 9/10, as a quality hotel of this standard should. Only point is that the decor, though extremely modern and international, completely lacks a Kolkata or Bengal touch. Without sounding parochial, does the local offer nothing to showcase internationally?

The service (10/10) was warm, embracing, friendly, and prompt. I should not rate the food now, as I had only a quick coffee and a salad. But I must mention that the cookie with the coffee was really heavenly (oh, why don't they give two at least! *smile*) and the 'soda' for cleansing the palate after the coffee was a great touch, and I had not seen it before in my travels. It works, too! The salad was very generous and 'healthy'.

I agree with another reviewer who raised the greenhouse effect of the glass, and hence, a little poor airconditioning. True. There were few here at the time, and definitely it could have been much better. Don't really know what happens if there were, say, 250 people in there at the time. Actually, due to the openness, the Lounge temperature is slightly lower than even the Lobby. However, one generally spends far less time in the Lobby than in the Lounge. Plus, when one eats, one tends to feel warmer.

Forgot to take any pics of the coffee or salad. The pics enclosed are of the swimming pool (before and after sunset), and the other of the entrance to the Lounge at the Lobby.

The overall rating for the JW Lounge is taking its "star-rating" in consideration. I hope to revisit soon, especially for some of their "15-year" and "18-year" selections :)

JW Lounge is the cafe lounge of the well-known luxury 5 star hotel JW Marriott that opened its doors to Kolkatans not long ago.

It's easy to spot for once you enter it spreads wide just on the right of the lush spacious lobby.
It has a soothing, tranquil ambiance, blending contemoprary decor with elegance and plush sophistication, perfect for executive meetings or for just chilling out with dear ones with refreshing snacks and beverages.

We visited it in the morning, and ended up having an appetising breakfast.

We'd ordered the Jasmine Pearl tea, Masala Chai, Cappuccino and Fried Chicken Burger. However the chef kindly informed us that they would not be able to serve the burger due to some issues regarding the quality of the chicken, and instead suggested if they could bring us some breakfast item, like dosa.

The Jasmine Pearl tea was nice; the server poured it neatly into the teacup from a dainty blue Chinese-looking teapot. The tea set consisted of a little bottle of Triptee Essex English blossom honey, a homemade melt-in-the mouth soft, rich, dark chocolate chip cookie along with the green tea.

The Masala tea too had its own set of sugar sachets. It came in sufficient quantity for two.

The coffee was however nothing extraordinary.

The complimentary plates of Masala Dosa were neatly presented; the dosas were fresh and crisp with yummy vegetable fillings; the white chutney was superb as was the spicy sambar.

Service is prompt, and hospitality is par excellence. They were warm, welcoming and made us feel comfortable.
Looking forward to come back again!

I love the design of the place but the architect forgot about the greenhouse effect glass walls can create, or did not tell the air conditioning engineer about his design so during the day the longe remains a bit hot. Coming to the food .. 2 visits were only coffee .. very good quality and comes with a yummy cookie with a soft inside. I also had a grilled sandwich on one occasion . .. good bread with a  lovely slab of cheese ...full marks

We tried out three appetizers and they were all lip-smacking to our heart's content. From the inception we were assisted by Reshmi who helped us find the correct veg combination, since I am pure veg then Shubronil helped us throughout and he served the items meticulously, not only that he made sure if the food was fine. Rahul guided us regarding the main menu for another visit with guests in the coming days. All n all a pleasant dining experience with amiable staff. Now coming to the food:
1. Samosa with green peas- apt Indian starter.
2. Mezze platter- authentic Lebanese. A must try.
3. Toastie- by far the best I've had.
4. Cappuccino- just the way I like my steaming foam cuppa.
4. Maracuya with rose blended smoothie- flavourful sip.

And the food.... I can see everything from almost all known corners of the world!
Huge platter!
I myself, preferred to go continental.. with wine and good collection of cheese, cold salad, mushrooms, salmon, baked chicken, pasta, pizza and flavored watermelon.

Special thanks to Apoorv!!!

In the absence of an executive lounge, this is used as a lounge for Marriott members and I frequented this on a couple of occasions. Nice comfortable seating with space between the tables allowing for some privacy though nothing special either as it looks like any other lobby lounge in any star hotel. Given that they are relatively new, there are two issues - no liquor license yet and the service is a bit patchy. Some servers will go out of their way to suggest options to eat while others are hard to get attention from. And it takes a long long time to get food on the table. Perhaps will improve with time and experience.
