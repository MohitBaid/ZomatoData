Not as good as it used to be a few years back . :'(
Once upon a time they used to make brilliant Butter Masala dishes
However , now the preparations are pretty ordinary.

A very nice place which serves familiar but delicious Mughlai dishes with polite customer service. Kebab in butter masala and shahi tukra are a must try dishes !

Whenever I come to kidderpore to visit my friends , my friends take me here .
We went for Chicken Biryani , Chicken Cheese Kebab , Chicken Kasa and Butter Naan.
All the items were good but a bit oily. Service was quick.

It's been one of the constants of Karl Marx sarani since long. Although it hasn't expanded much, the quality of food has improved a lot,since there's hefty competition from its neighbouring mughlai joints.  Biriyani,mutton tikia and the chaanp are some of their best dishes. would suggest a take out since seating space is limited. Hope it doesn't lose out to bigger players in the market, since this place has a definitely unique

Located on main road, sometimes,this is a small restaurant which,  though has a limited seating capacity, offers good service. Ordered a paneer roll, a chicken biryani and tandoori roti and chicken recall. Requested to make rezala a bit spicy, to my surprise,  it was done. Service is good, u can tell them how you want your food and they will make it the same way. Reasonable prices, good service.

Just next to fancy market with its competitor to its right, this is another place which gives you value for money. Biryani is good and the service is quick. Again a must try. 
P.S. - there is a bigger divide between the Sheesh mahal faithfuls and the India restaurant faithfuls than between East Bengal and mohun bagan.
