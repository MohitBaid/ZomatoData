Very spacious, well decorated restaurant. Though a star hotel & restaurant, but the stars failed to impress me. Location-wise it's very good as it is located just nearer to the shopping paradise of residents of South Kolkata, Gariahat. Though the quantity of the food was quite good, but the quality of the food was not up to the mark. We ordered a preparation of fish which was stinky. The service of the waiter was too slow & casual. A simple order of 2 glasses of fresh lime soda took almost 30 minutes to reach our table. The food too was very basic.
Not much recommended.

Went there on a puja day. The restaurant was all empty. We ordered food as per their suggestion. Garluc fish which was supposed to be bland turned out to be spicy. Chiili fish was served cold. All other main couse items almost tasted the same. Highly overpriced average quality food

Nyonyang being the only Chinese cuisine restaurant in Park Plaza Hotel, Gariahat, didn’t fail to serve good Chinese food. Had decided to dine-in here for dinner. The hotel being a reputed hotel in Kolkata had a great ambience and beautiful decors. The restaurant is situated on the 1st Floor, which is not exactly on the first floor but in between the ground floor and the first floor. A very small space, with compact seating arrangements. 
Now coming to the food, we had ordered for-
1.	Steamed Spinach and Sweet Corn Dumpling: These dumplings were for our starters, which took almost 45 mins to come. Had never expected that dumplings could actually take so much of time to be prepared. The food quality was good and so was the taste. The only major drawback of this dish was that they do not serve any separate momo sauce. In spite of being an authentic Chinese restaurant, they did not seem to have the basic accompaniments of the Chinese cuisine. 
2.	Har Gow: This dish consisted of Cantonese prawn dumplings. Even though there was nothing unique about this dish, yet we did savour every bit of the dumplings. 
3.	Vegetable Singaporean Rice Noodles: The rice noodles were nicely prepared and had many veggies in it, which generally restaurants fail to add. 
4.	Prawn in Hot Garlic Sauce: The prawns were nice and juicy. Well prepared and a perfect match for our Singaporean Noodles. 
The food quality and quantity were good, but very poor and laid-back service. Every order takes around 30 mins to come, in spite of the restaurant being empty. It will be good if the management could consider this issue and work on the improvement of the service. Hoping for fewer disappointments on our next visit. Good luck to the team!

Went to this place on the 14th of Feb and was utterly disappointed  with the food and most importantly the service. Being a star hotel, there a a few basic things that you should expect.
1. We were a group of 5 and as soon as we climbed up the hallway as asked for a table to the restaurant the serving manager as indifferent as he was said that we had to wait. There were a few tables empty and unreserved. On asking if we can get one of those tables, he reluctantly arranged for the table in a very shoddy fashion. No handkerchiefs given, no water served, I felt we were highly unwelcome

2. After asking around 3 times for water and the menu finally a server came up and served the 4 of us water with the menu and it wasn't around 20 mins (no exaggeration)until we got to see the waiter again and water to the 5th member of our group.

3. We ordered standard chinese , fried rice, wanton soups , starters and chilli chicken and already I was hearing people from other tables highly dissatisfied with some half baked food and the time they were taking to bring food. Noticing that , we had asked our servers to get us everything together and he obliged, but did not follow that. 

It was a 2 hour slog  waiting  at table after which we received our food. By then a lot of the customers had already left and highly unhappy. 

Like us a few of them were staying at the hotel also and I guess they had also complained about the same.

Coming to the food: tasteless, bland and not cooked properly.

In short , the worst experience I had ever had since time immemorial.

A suggestion, Please do not keep the restuarnt open on days when your staff is half of what it should be.

Good place , amazing good, horrible service!!!!!

It's difficult to say how the place is if amazing food Somesh with horrible service !! Then one thinks would you like to come again? And for this place answer is a big no

Booked a table for 8 one day prior. The following day got a re confirmation call for the booking. On Ativan was told they don't have a table for 8 when the restaurant was empty and we would have to sit on separate tables. Once the manager was called they joined two tables. 

After placing the order main course took almost 45 mins. Once asked y is it taking so long we got an answer that the kitchen is bizzi.

I fail to understand when 2-3 tables out of 16-18 table is occupied how can the kitchen be bizzi. 

Food was great 

Would never want to visit this place again

We started with Gyoza(Chicken Dumplings),the moved on to Siap Base Kalas ( Balinese chicken dish) and Thai Steamed Jasmine Rice.

Left the restaurant with our taste buds satisfied and enhanced.

Came for the saptami lunch with nearbuy vouchers. Had an amazing time. For 599 per head the food was simply fantastic. This is situated at the park plaza hotel in gariahat. A mezzanine floor converted into a restaurant. A huge TDH menu was there. Tried so many dishes. No complaint in any thing except for the date pancakes with ice cream which was not like a pancake but more like a dough stuffed with dates inside. 
Apart from that loved each and every item. The service is impeccable. The redeeming of the voucher was done smoothly. 
Recommended for everyone who want to try some delicious Chinese food this puja or even after puja!!

A great asian restaurant in the heart of the city. Situated in the well made park plaza hotel, its a small restaurant on the mezzanine floor. I found the ambience to be a bit lacking as the restaurant itself is open to the lobby which becomes disturbing for the guests with the sound of the phone constantly ringing and people bustling in the lobby area. It a fine dining restaurant, so thats a minus.

But the restaurant scores with its food and service. We called for tom yum soup, asian barbequed chicken, vegetables in hunan sauce, egg fried rice, hakka noodles and darsaan with ice cream. All the food served was good save and except the darsaan which was over fried. Although it was still decent, it didnt compare to the rest of the food. Service was good with a special thanks to Abhijeet for serving us very well. Will go back soon. Recommended !!

Today was my second visit, and the quality remains consistent. Lovely decor, comfortable seating and very friendly staff. The food is superlative. We ordered chicken lemon coriander soup, and it was served with steamed buns, kimchi and pickled vegetables. For mains we had roast lamb in black bean sauce and hot garlic prawns with chicken fried rice and Cantonese rice noodles. For dessert I chose the batter fried banana with honey and sesame seeds, with green coconut ice cream. The banana fritters could be better, although the ice cream was very enjoyable. The prices are on the higher side, but my father being a member we enjoyed heavy discounts and ended my birthday celebration with a bottle of red. My highest recommendation for those
who wish for a taste of Chinese food with a difference.
P.s. ok, once again for my dad's birthday! Moonfan fried rice  and stir fried seafood with celery would be a must try. Also, I would highly recommend the date pancake with orange glaze. Fried ice cream was nice too!!!

Park plaza is located near the Gariahat Pantaloons. The interior is very well decorated. Nyonyang is located in the first floor of the hotel. I got the groupon offer for this restaurant- the 4 course meal offer. We had non veg lemon soup, a coconut based mild spicy chicken soup, both were pretty good. For starters we had crispy chilli baby corn, which I felt was a bit overcooked.. And chilli pepper fish. Chicken was presented in 2 different sauces.. One was white sauce and another in red sauce. The red sauce was spicy and the white on a bit mild were the main course accompanied with veg garlic noodles and fried rice. And as dessert, we had fried ice cream. It is one of the better desserts I have had.

The place is located above lobby and had very nice sitting. If you are alone you can't feel bored as you can see lots hustle around you . The place had good choice of menu . I had ordered Soup,starter , a noodle and kungpao chicken,/ Over all the quality and quantity of the food were great to have for three person. So we need to order very smart . The soup was once of the best i had tried in last few oriental restaurant. Fried rice was with perfect choice of fresh veggies and well tossed. 

The service person was very humble and told me that we are ordering more and if we have a plan for a parcel. On my next visit , its a definite try.

I ordered a normal chinese meal with some side dishes one veg food was ok but not as the rates suggest it is a bit costly.
Improvements in food are needed.
Quantity is decend.
Al in all is worth to try it out.

Recently tried this Pan Asian restaurant located in Park Plaza hotel, and though the food was lovely, my overall experience was a big let down.

Located inside a 5 star property, i felt the pricing was very reasonable. The decor is nice, seating reasonably comfortable.. There were some issues with air conditioning but that might occur at any place. There was a shortage of staff with a couple of people managing the whole restaurant, right from taking orders to serving and what not. They were polite and humble but eventually service was not at all brisk. the serving time was freaky with starters taking an hour to be served, same goes for main course. I am actually cool with this as long as the food is awesome but others were not too comfy with it.

Coming to food, starters were pretty good. Crackling spinach was nice but an overdose of corn in it was avoidable. The wok tossed veggies were nice. Soups tasted pretty good. Indonesian buns served complimentary were amazing, buttery and sweetish. Fried rice was average honestly and the serving was on lesser side. Stir fried pak choi and greens in black bean sauce was really well made.

Overall i felt the food was very value for money but not without various glitches here and there.

"An experience steeped in novelty" is what the menu promised! The shocks came slowly, one by one and novelty began to slowly look like a distant speck of cloud in the horizon!  

When I had first tasted Nasi Goreng during my trip to Bali, it was at a beach shack in Bali and the heat, humidity and the crowd were added accompaniments!  At Nyongyan, the crowd was missing but the heat and humidity were present, albeit in a slightly lesser measure! I was told by the lone waiter that there was some problem with the airconditioning and so one had to bear with it!  So much for my desire to taste novelty, I thought!  

The dish itself was a bit of a letdown in terms of the fact that it was a little cold and one got the feeling that we had been served "ready-to-eat" stuff that had been warmed before serving. There were lumps of salt accumulated in specific part of the dish, as if it had not been mixed properly. Even the spiciness was a little less compared to the original, I felt. The garnish though looked pleasing to the eye. 
The other stuffs that we ordered were good though with special mention that needs to be made about chicken in coconut sauce-another Indonesian dish. The sui mai was also quite good. 

The restaurant, overall needs to evolve in terms of the ambience and the offerings if it wishes to fulfil it's desire to serve novelty!  The service is very slow and we had another group of women who walked out in disgust while we were there.  The decor is food and the open restaurant concept is praiseworthy. However many of the dishes that the menu announces, are not available and that to my mind is not "Novelty" for a Restaurant!

Recently I had my company's annual conference at Park Plaza followed by a cocktail dinner. The spread, although Indian, impressed me quite a bit and I ventured around the hotel a bit to look up their restaurants. Nyonyang was difficult to miss owing to its proximity to the reception and lobby area. The menu looked interesting enough so I decided to try it out this last Friday. It was to be a toss up between MLC Gurusaday Road and Nyonyang. MLC is tried and tested and a fantastic restaurant but since I had been there many times and I was in the mood to experiment Nyonyang got the nod. Litlle did I know then, the disaster I was heading for.
If I had to summarise this place in two words, I think I would say, UTTERLY RIDICULOUS. Firstly the seating was not to comfortable. One has to sit at the edge of the sofas in order to reach the table and eat with relative ease. So relaxation goes right out of the window there. There was just one waiter who was courteous. I ordered the crisp spare pork ribs in barbeque sauce. (See photo attached). MAJOR faux pas. I was served crispy fried bacon, believe you me. It tasted as salty as bacon and the texture was exactly like bacon. When it was being brought to the table I began doubting and when I bit in to one I was absolutely sure that it was bacon and not spare ribs. The rib bones were missing and there was not a semblance of the barbeque sauce. I inquired from the waiter whether I was served bacon instead of spare ribs and he explained that since I had ordered for crispy spare ribs the meat had been sliced off the bone and served. I just was not ready to accept that bull****. He called his manager and I realized that they had the perfectly rehearsed alibi. He too came up with the same story and was proceeding to call the chef. I stopped him and requested him to stop playing 'passing the blame' game. I told him clearly that I was a lover of bacon and would know bacon even if I was fed it in a state of sleepiness. Moving on, I found the udon noodles to be average.  The Nyonya style cooked pork had good flavours but the pork was grossly undercooked. The minced duck in banana leaf was really quite good. And to down all this I had ordered a lemongrass mojito which was very refreshing. 
The dessert that had been ordered was the candied walnuts. The sugar reduction was very unappealing to look at and the walnuts tasted off and musty. Since I don't like wasting food I just managed somehow to gulp it down. I paid the bill and handed the valet my parking ticket and was just about to drive off when the waiter came running and claimed to have missed presenting the alcohol bill. I cross-checked and found it to be true. I cleared the dues and cleared off. A harrowing experience. I would not recommend this place but if you are in an adventerous mood as I was then, feel free to take the plunge.

A pan-Asian cuisine serving restaurant in Park Plaza, a comparatively new 3-star property. 

Minimalistic interiors done with an Asian feel to it. Ambience: Family dining or couples - great for both. 

Serves non veg and liquor. Has a good variety of dishes from all corners of Asia - Cantonese, Chinese, Thai, Malay and more


The complimentary amuse-bouche is not your regular Kim-chi. It's an Asian bun, with this slight natural sweetness. Though I'm not sure as to which region of Asia it belongs to, I loved it. We ordered a sweet chilli dip to have with it. Tasted amazing.

What we ordered: Crispy chilli baby corn & mushroom, jing's chicken with soya and chilli, veg pan friend noodles, Veg Chilli & basil fried rice, Veg in munchurian sauce, Chilli chicken, Lemongrass Mojito, Tokyo Sunrise.

We loved everything. Amazing food and beverages.


What we strongly recommend:

 Crispy Chilly's baby corn & mushroom - a little different from the regular variant
 
Veg Pan fried noodles - the classic taste, but one of the best in town

Veg chilli & basil fried rice - again a play with original variant makes it different, tastes amazing.

Lemongrass Mojito - After long, did I have a very well blended and great tasting cocktail in an Asian cuisine restaurant. Exquisite I'd say.

The other dishes were great and to the standard. These were mentioned because they were above the standard.

Couldn't try their desserts. That will be coming up shortly. Bon Apetit!

Its important for a place to live up to its own standards and I was slightly disappointed by the meal I had at Nyonyang a few days back. Its not a huge restaurant with about ten odd tables and usually I have always seen a couple of waiters present along with a Manager but that day there was only one waiter and it was a struggle for him to manage all the occupied tables. Our meal was a mixed bag ..... we were seated and served with a flat-bread that was similar to a pizza base .... it was to be paired with a sweet chilly sauce that was very nice. One of my friends ordered a mocktail called Asian Twist that was very nice. We ordered Quick Fried Corn and Spinach Pepper Salt , Jing's Chicken and Lemon Coriander Soup to start our meal off .... all were excellent.The main course that followed was not as good .... the Moon Fan Rice and Veg Hakka Noodles were nice enough , the Honey Glazed Chicken was good but the  Dragon's Choice Vegetable's were quite strange .... filled with lettuce, carrot and zucchini in a rather watery gravy where we had specifically requested it prepared with Potato, Bell Pepper, Baby Corn, American Corn and to avoid Tofu,Broccoli and Mushroom was a let down. Also when we complained they said they will add the vegetables we have requested but bought it back a couple of minutes later with only corn added and none of the other veggies . The Manager did take our feedback very politely and the poor harried waiter was trying to juggle all the tables at the same time as best he could but the service was nowhere near what it should have been simply because it was too much for one person to manage not that he did not put in full effort. Overall a decent meal but I have had better meals here in the past. Hope the Management resolves these issues sooner rather than later.

Nyonyang is the Pan Asian Restaurant at the Park Plaza and serves up pretty good oriental food. The decor is great love the reds and golds and it has a mezzanine location that overlooks the lobby of the hotel. Service perfectly complements the ambiance though it would be top-notch if the waiters knew a little bit more about the menu options. To be honest I have always ordered pretty much regular stuff but whenever I have visited the food has been good and given me no cause of complaint. My personal recommendations - for starters  Quick Fried Spinach with Corn , Golden Fried Prawns and Honey Glazed Lemon Chicken are delicious. Crab Meat Wanton Soup was lovely and subtle and if you like crabs a must try but please note that those who are into very spicy food may find it bland  ... as for me I loved its delicate flavors. The Prawn Hargao and the Chicken Siumai are both very nice if you like dimsums but I have not tried the veg options yet. For mains choose between Wok Tossed Prawns in Hot Garlic Sauce , Kung Pao Chicken and the Braised Pork Nyon ya Style all of which are super .... pair that up with rice or noodles and your set for a lovely meal , Hokkien Noodles and Moon fan Rice are both very good as are the usual fried rice and hakka noodle variants. I never end up eating dessert as I love the flavors and want them to linger on my taste buds so will await dessert feedback from fellow foodies.

I was craving for a nice Thai dinner and finally zeroed in on  NYONYANG - The Pan Asian restaurant at the Park Plaza Hotel. The place is pretty close to my residence and once I got there the staff was extremely courteous to my family and escorted us to the restaurant on the first floor. Since we had made a prior booking we got a table almost immediately. 

Moving in, I loved the bright colours used to decor the restaurant especially the big sofas which were comfortable! The lights were soothing and added to the ambience. Some of us wanted to have a drink or two and ordered the same. Had to wait a good fifteen mintues before the drinks were served. In fact, had to request the waiter twice to look into the situation as he kept on saying the drinks were being fetched from the bar! Now where else would drinks come from otherwise!! Anyway during this ardous wait, we decided to order soups and starters. So grub we ordered - crispy chilli babycorn and mushrooms, two portions of spicy hunan prawns and two portions of mandarin pan fried dumplings. We wanted pork but that wasn't available sadly and so we decided to settle for chicken. For soup we ordered a mix of lemon coriander soup and tom yum koong with prawn. We enjoyed the starters with drinks and I thought the prawns were fresh and very well cooked, also the dumplings and babycorn which was very fried to perfection. In came the soup for the non drinkers and I was told it was slightly cold than normal - not much to complain though.

Moderately filled with soup and starters it was time for the main course. We ordered two portions of mixed pan fried noodles and chilli basil fried rice each. The pan fried noodles was very well done and everyone enjoyed it. The rice was pretty good too. The side dishes that we ordered along were a portion of drunken chicken in shaoshing wine, kung pao chicken and roast lamb in devil sauce. I must recommend the drunken chicken in shaoshing sauce as it is not as chilly as it sounds and the mix of chilly, oyster sauce and splash of shaosing wine is excellent. The kung pao chicken is okay and at par with other leading restaurants. What disappointed me slightly was the roast lamb schezwan sauce - thought the lamb was slightly less fried and tasted like the traditional bengali mutton curry! Full to the brim - we had no place and decided to give the desert a skip. 

All said and done I must say that the food is great and the portions good. We ate till we dropped, infact we could not polish off the rice. The portions served were of good quantity and I thought the pricing was extremely reasonable since the Park Plaza is a five star hotel. The waiter assigned to our table was very courteous and had asked us twice if we were enjoying the meal. The only thing which I could complain perhaps is that there were only two waiters manning the entire restaurant and they had tough time attenting all tables. We had to reach out to the poor waiter serving at the adjacent table for the bill. Over all a very nice experience where the food wins hands down inspite of the slightly slow service!

Nyonyang Pan Asian Restaurant..  It is a swanky restaurant in Park Plaza - The Newest Five-Star Property in Town.. It is located in Garchha Lane, Ballygunge in the same lane as Mirch Masala.

The interiors, predominantly done in white and red with a splash of yellow, along with the dim lights and oriental theme, is strikingly good. The seating is very comfortable, too. I've been wanting to try it, ever since I heard that it opened, and hence there I was yesternight for dinner with my friends.

Coming to the food,

Soups : All were good.. of which Burmese Khao Suey was the best,
Followed by Lemon Coriander, Laksa Lemak, and Sweet Corn Soups.

Starters : Crispy Fried Chili Garlic Potatoes was good.
Whereas Quick Fried Spinach with Corn Salt & Pepper Style,
and Asparagus, Shitake Mushrooms & Tofu Spring Rolls were okay.

Main Course : In order of preference..
Mandarin Dumplings in Manchurian Sauce,
Singaporean Rice Noodles,
Balinese Jukut Urab, 
Kaeng Kheiw Waan (Thai Green Curry),
Exotic Vegetables Braised in Ginger Wine Sauce,
Pan Fried Noodles
Japanese Udon Noodles,
Tofu Hunan Style,
Chili & Basil Fried Rice
Thai Jasmine Rice

Mocktails :
Japanese Sunrise was the best.
Followed by Virgin Mojito and Iced Tea.

Desserts :
Dessert Assiette (Apple Pie, Passion Fruit, Mocha & Blueberry Petit Fours) was the best.
Deep-Fried Ice Cream with Chocolate Drizzle & Roasted Cashews was great, Date Pancake with Orange Dip  was good.
Honey & Sesame Seed Batter Fried Banana with Tender Coconut IceCream was okay

The service was awesome and the presentation of the food was good too.

Considering that it is a five-star restaurant, the pricing is quite moderate.
It would set you back for about Rs. 1200 per person.

Overall, it was a nice experience!
But given a choice, I would choose K19, a floor above, over this any day.

Four stars from me :)

Visited this place by chance, was actually planning a dinner with family at K-19, another restaurant in the same hotel (Park Plaza Ballygunge). While entering we came to know that this new restaurant has started its operations. To start with, the positioning is just perfect, very close to the entrance, and yet very secluded and peaceful due to an elevated positioning. I ordered Chicken Dumplings for my daughter, Nasi Goreng for the two of us, along with Kung Pao Chicken. Portions were reasonable, and the taste was very good indeed. The ambiance is very serene and perfect for a family dinner where you can peacefully have dinner and also talk to your beloveds. I found the price to be okay, considering the fact that this is a restaurant that sits inside a 5 Star Hotel. Recommended for quiet family outings or romantic dates.

the ambience is nice and the food is of international standard. Prices are high but it's worth. The service is average and considering the types of cuisines it serves I will recommend this place once in 2-3 months for people who dine out on week ends and in 5-6 month for occasional visitors- Umesh
