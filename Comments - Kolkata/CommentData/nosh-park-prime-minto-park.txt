We stayed at this hotel and decided to have a coffee one of the days we didn't venture out. Pathetic service. Servers not even ready for any kind of orders. Chairs and tables not cleaned on a regular basis and mostly wearing a deserted look. The coffee was decent though it didn't have any of the flair with designs that most cafes would serve for a cup of latte. That too was a tad disappointing.

Cheers,

Nosh - is the 24*7 coffee shop on the ground floor of Park Prime hotel located on AJC Bose Road near Minto Park while going towards BeckaBagan. The coffee shop has an excellent ambience but a little shabby with no one around and improper maintenance. Food is excellent. Ordered zest cooler and The Stephani - chicken creppe both of them tasted very good.Â  Service was instant and rates are reasonable.

Nosh - The 24 hrs coffee shop of The Park Prime Hotel, was a real turn off. We stepped in at around 11pm. The service was the most lousy ones I've come across till date. We ordered a Cappuccino, a Cafe Latte (Froth missing from both the coffees), a Cold Chocolate (which wasn't cold at all), French Fries were served cold (which were supposed to be served hot), a Thin Crust Pizza (surprisingly a good one). Ketchup sachets were served which doesn't suit the standards of a 4* Hotel (they claim so, as the service was of a No * Hotel). There was only 1 person available for order taking/coffee & food preparing/water serving etc. Above all he was a trainee, so you can imagine what service was given. At the end, when I requested for a Feedback form or a Suggestion Book, the Front Desk guy happily hands over a plain piece of paper. Really???? My first and last visit to Nosh. Thanks for a nice Pizza at least.

This one is a late review. We went to Nosh last October during Puja. It was a lunch buffet with all Bengali spreads. Ambience is really good though the carpet area is little less. Staffs are very friendly and the food quality is also good.

This seems to be a nice place to hang out with friends or family.

Nosh.. It is located on the ground floor just in front of the enrtance of the Chrome Hotel in AJC Bose Road.
The interiors are good enough with a great height. Getting a reservation here was really a head ache and more so when you find out that the restaurant was fully vacant and still they don't give reservation saying that there is a private party going on, it was real turn off. This is not the first time this has happened to me, I had faced the same problem while booking for Khanasutra and I knew how the staff is, and that is why I decided to go and check and I wasn't surprised at all. We were a group of eight and went on a Saturday afternoon and we were the only people present in the restaurant. Coming to what we ordered..
Soups : All were good of which Minestrone was the best followed by  Bhunne Makai ka Shorba, Tamatar ka Shorba and Cream of Tomato.
Main Course : The pizzas - Margharita and Contadino were good and so were the Pastas - Arrabiata and Alfredo.
Desserts: Chocolate Crepe was awesome and Crepe Suzette was ordinary.
Mocktails : Both the Kiwi Blush and Iced Tea were nice.

Expect to shell out 600 per head for a three course meal.

BUT in spite of the food being good I have rated it 2 stars and the only reason being the service was SOOO SLOW  that you could take a good nap in between courses. Expect at least half an hour gap between each course to arrive. When inquired about the longg delay in service the reply was that the kitchen is on the first floor and it takes time for the food to be transported. Wow!

Never going again if the service time is not improved.
