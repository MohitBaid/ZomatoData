My Ratings of 4.5 because of consistently good quality! 
A4 Foods by Anirudh Maheshwari is creating a buzz in baking world. I have had several cakes from them and I must honestly convey that the quality was top notch! Especially the chocolate cakes, simply worth drooling! 
From chocolates to choco bouquets to cakes to snacks, there quality is every worth its penny and  consistent too! 
Just ordered a Cricket themed chocolate birthday cake for my son and it turned out so well! Kids were amazed to see the creativity! And at a reasonable price too!

Best in terms of taste and delivery,no wonder. I ordered many flavour cakes from here including the mint,coffee,etc. Out of which,coffee cake was the perfect combination of everything i could ever imagine in a cake. Thankyou for being the finest homemakers.

The first thing I had from this place was a coffee cake, and it was one of the best cakes I've ever had. The ones from kookie jar, upper crust, cakes, etc. didn't even come close, now let me tell you why. The first thing about cakes, is their softness, and this one was perfectly soft. It was optimally sweet, not too much sugar that would spoil the coffee flavour and not too much of coffee too make it sour. The d√©cor on the cake was also very standard, when compared to what we get in the market. Usually the fate of birthday cakes is that they end up being 'used' as facial cream, but this one was so delicious it was actually savoured by my guests. Now for cakes, I don't look anywhere else, but Mr. Maheshwary at A4 Foods.

Their cakes, in my personal opinion, are amazingly delicious. The first time I had a cake in here, I had made my choice right then.
The quality of the cream is just fabulous always.
Really nice response on each and every order till date, each time.
My suggestions on their cakes: The coffee flavored cake and The white chocolate mint cream cake. The best ones anyone will ever have. üòç

Have tried almost all flavours of A4 cakes. The amazing strawberry cake. The scintillating coffee cake. The mouth-watering chocolate cake. The cute rainbow Cake. But my current favourite is their new launch- the choco mint cake. The rich chocolate with the amazing softness. And the mint sauce is like a cherry on top. It's freshness can blow away one's mind and taste buds.

Thank you A4 foods for coming up with such amazing cakes. üíû
