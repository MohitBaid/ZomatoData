The food is really good. I eat a lot in Mallika and I have never found their food bad. They maintain a good quality consistently. The gravey chow and sweet and sour chicken is my favourite combination. The chicken roll is also good for snacks.Â 
The quantity is great and it is also pocket friendly

They serve really good Chinese savours. 
Sumptuous quantity with standard quality at a very budget range.
Service is prompt and the atmosphere is homely.
As they have a very limited seating capacity, takeaway is the best option. Although the restaurant is not much full even during busy lunch hours.
Been there quite a few times, tried their chinese section only.

A small eatery a little way from Karunamoye, its AC but has very little sitting place. However, it was pretty much empty at the rush lunch hour as phone per phone came for home delivery, I figured its a popular place for home delivery. Ordered chicken chow and lemon chicken. Quantity was a lot, food was standard. Nothing extraordinary, but verging mostly on the homely roadside stall versions.

Recently ordered some Chinese food from this place, considering the total delivery time I would say the service is pretty fast.I ordered some Prawn hakka noodles,dry chilli fish,crispy chilli babycorn and chicken with mushrooms.
The noodles had ample amount of tiny prawn pieces and the flavour of Chinese hakka noodles(any Indian Chinese lover will know what I am trying to say) was very much present.
The crispy chilli babycorn and dry chilli fish was basically the same dish one with babycorn and the other with chunks of basa.For the babycorn most of them were old fibrous babycorn hence resulting in not being boiled properly and there was no crispy factor to the dish.On the other hand in the fish dish,the batter to fish ratio was highly variable from piece to piece.
The chicken dish was the best of the lot for me because after a long time I had this light white chinese gravy.There were lots of mushroom and the dish had a very strong garlicky taste which I loved.The chicken pieces though were a little tough but this was the best complimenting dish for the noodles with some chilli sauce.

This restaurant is located near Karunamoyee bus stop. Nothing special about its ambience. The food is good enough for its cheap price. We mainly tried the chinese section . The egg schezwan chowmein was good indeed . The hot garlic chicken was ordered as a concomitant with chowmein which was good as well. The food is pocket friendly and tastes well too. The place has just three tables so can maximum accommodate twelve people at a time. If you don't care much about ambience then you could give this place a try.
P.S - the quantity is ample per plate.

Compared to the reviews i saw Mallika dosnt dissapoint much. Quality of food is good and the quantity is a lotttt. Momos are good but the covering is too thick. Chilli chicken gravy contains too much of corn flour.A plate of chowmein is enough for three person. In the end it is worth a try.

We are almost regular customer. We took home delivery. They maintain good service for home delivery. Food quality is below average, quantity is decent. Last time we tried Chicken Pakoda & Fish Fry which is not up to the mark. Chicken was too dry & over cooked, pakoda looks big due to the dough. Fish fillet was too thin. Both the food wasn't hot at the time of delivery. Also it took longer than general to deliver food.

The quantity is a LOT. 1 dish can easily be divided between 2 and the taste is good as well.. people in Salt Lake should definitely try. Don't go by names.

This is one of the small food joints you have in Sector 3 near the karunamoyee Housing Estate. It has Nargis on its one side and Hit wicket and oye Valle balle dhaba in a half a min walk distance.
 For a place so small they serve the best soups ever. The ambience is nothing great and is a bit better than the road side joins but the food they serve is yummy. The portions easily serve 2. And the service is really prompt. Sitting capacity will be around 10 - 12 people. Did I forget to mention it's very pocket friendly. A 4 from me just for the food.

Mallika is a place where you get decent food, their Indian Chinese food is tasty and their quantity is adequate. Prices are reasonable and service is pleasant. Their delivery service is fairly efficient. All in all its a good place to grab a bite, fill that belly on the go or order in when you're just not feeling like cooking.

It is one of the outlets nearby karunamoyee that has been there since quite a few years..well it is primarily a chinese food outlet...

Pros :- very very economic in addition to more than sufficient quantity per dish...good service and staffs..

Cons :- very limited seating area....food is low on quality....

I have had chicken chowmein over there long time back during one of the durga pujas..the quantity was enough for 2 and tasted fine enough...however today i had chicken talomen soup over there and i was pretty unhappy with it...the soup with noodles and chicken+mushroom pieces in it was very thin...and had substantial oil floating on the surface..the taste was mediocre at best...wud have rated them 3 given the pros i mentioned, but was really disappointed with the quality of the soup today...waiting time after ordering is not too less but bearable...would recommend this if u r nearby, r hungry and have a small budget..

This is a very small, sandwiched restaurant located adjacent to Nargis. On our first visit to Nsrgis, we couldn't get a table and hence settled in here. The dining space is very small. It only had two or I guess three tables. The washbasin was located just beside the table where we were seating. The food came quickly though. We didn't have to wait too long. The quality however was just average. The prices are not high but there's no such decor either. Really can't recommend this place to people. The nearby Nargis is much better.

The food was good and the portion served was enough for two. Prices were also reasonable and the service was fast too.

This is one cheap Chinese eatery in Salt Lake! Unbelievably cheap rates across the menu card. Its a small place with a seating capacity of a little less than a score. I had their lung fung soup, and it was deliciously made with loads of chicken,  vegetables and egg drops. I even had the crispy chicken which had a tangy twist while retaining the crunchiness outside. The restaurant serves humongous amount in their main dishes. 
If you are looking out for ambience, style, presentation then it would be intelligent to avoid this place. If you are looking for cheap, moderately fair quality food in large quantities then avoiding this place would be stupidity.

First time ordered through Swiggy. Very good experience. Delivery person was polite.

Rating For Food:

Chicken Singapore: 4/5  (chicken was soft but was a bit small. 8 pieces given. so good quantity, cooking was decent)

Chicken Shanghai: 5/5 (best shanghai i had so far. pieces were soft and spicy. lots of cashew given , went well with vodka.)

Chicken Schezwan fried Rice: 3/5 ( a bit too spicy. the chicken was a bit tough but overall quite okay)

Rating for Price:

1. Decent pricing. (about 450 for us 3 people. but we are small petite people so i may be wrong. )

2. Good quantity for pricing. 

Nitpicks:

Reduce the thickness of coating on singapore chicken and increase size of chicken. I am ready to pay 30/- extra for it. But i want less coating. It mars the experience of an otherwise great dish.

An age old restaurant here, serving pocket-friendly Chinese food since long! This is located nearby Nargis and is very close to Bidhannagar Municipality School. This is basically a small eatery with few tables and chairs placed. The menu isn't anything fancy although it pretty much covers basic Chinese dishes.Â 

I have been ordering from here for quite a long time now. Although the last one of them has been quite a while back, this hasn't suppressed my love for Mallika. Their soups are pretty decent. However, my most favorite item here has always been Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken or Manchurian. I remember, back in the days, the owner used to offer 10% concessions on Take-away's and Home Delivery.

Can't say, if it is still applicable. If you are looking for a quick meal at economical prices, do drop in here! :-)

The mixed fried rice from this place definitely is the pick of the lot and as mentioned before quantity is extremely good with 2 portions being large enough to satisfy three hungry souls! Pricing is also reasonable..overall as far as home deliveries are concerned this place can definitely be tried.

It's a very small restaurant one might not like dinning there  but people in sector 2 & 3 can go for home delivery I really liked their Chinese preparation. They make decent Chinese dishes with good quality ingredients. I tried a lot of stuff few mentioned here which I like most mixed Hakka noodles, chicken coriander soup, chicken hot&sour soup, dry chilli chicken. Also there indian style chicken pakoras are very good compliments for any alcoholic drinks.

My favorite para Chinese (in Salt Lake) Rank # 5.

Here' why:

1) Very prominently located, bang opposite Central Park (they have a board which is a red shade of the longest wavelength possible, you have to be blind to miss it).

2) Elaborate menu, with choice of egg, chicken, prawn, fish, or all of those together. You can pick from an array of red and brown curries and gravies under the indo-chinese spectrum - chilly, garlic, chilly-garlic, schezuan and 'singapuri', honey and black 'paper' - you name it, they have it. Try any, you will not be disappointed.

3) The quality of ingredients used is standard, so even if the grease factor is a bit high, the taste is always good. Do not expect mild, flavorful Chinese, this is oil-spice-overloaded-heavenly-para-chinese-of-kolkata.

4) They are innovative! Do not make the mistake of judging them by their spellings - go deeper! You will be amazed at the sheer ingenuity of the place. 'Steamed Motor' is not a boat! It is a concoction of boiled peas (with egg, chicken or whatever you choose) - nothing chinese about it, but a healthy, light option for leisurely munching. 'Paper' chicken has no paper in it....just tasty, sinful fried chicken with loads of pepper.

5) The crowd is almost always interesting...mostly lovers (of all ages, sizes, and shapes) - tired, sun-baked, blissful and hungry after bouts of quick daytime romance - you will not be able to take your eyes off them. Actually they are bound to boost your appetite!

6) Service is quick and helpful (ask what is good), AC works, portion sizes are huge (for him and her perhaps), soft drinks are served, and price is reasonable. Nothing to complain about, really!

7) There's a roll and fast food counter that operates in the evening. Home delivery is available. So go try!

I would rather visit Nargis, just beside Mallika, which is a letter option, m sure!

We were around Saltlake Korunamoyee and decided to look for a place to grab a quick lunch. We found out Mallika near Koshe Kosha (sector-3) and decided to hop in. We found the place actually had no ambiance, very less seating capacity and the tables were also bit closely placed. But when we went in, it was just empty; so we decided to take our seats. We ordered - Chilli garlic Chicken hakka noodles, Chilli garlic Chicken gravy noodles and Thai Chicken. I should say some of the dishes can be tried out here, like Chilli garlic Chicken hakka noodles, it was actually good, very garlicky and filled with red chilli flakes and chicken pieces, just the way I like it. Quantity served for Chilli garlic Chicken hakka noodles was actually humongous. One plate easily serves two. The prices are comparatively cheap, and the quality is somewhat in accordance to that. Though apart from this, I did not like the other two dishes, better not to delve deep into those details. Though the location is pretty good with easy road-side free parking but still you can avail home-delivery from this place. 

Now coming to some of the cons. Actually there are many, here you go - The dishes have got very poor presentation - often it will be a total turn-off and you might not wish to continue having the food, like the gravy noodles or the Thai chicken. Also strangely the gravy of Thai chicken tasted almost similar to the gravy of the Cantonese noodles!!!! We also realized that quality of ingredients can be improved a lot, and actually it should be. Now coming to the most serious issue - Quantity served for Chilli garlic Chicken hakka noodles was actually huge. One plate should serve two and this fact should be communicated while the guests are placing their orders since they don't have a clear idea if it is their first time. But the waiter did not mention about this and we unnecessarily ordered extra food which we shouldn't have. This is a huge negative and it was clearly done just to increase the bill amount and customer care was completely ignored.Â 

It might be a budget dining joint, but the food should have that zing and flavour that will make people come back for more, I guess that is somewhat missing here. Overall - Not sure about coming back to this place for couple of their 'better' dishes. But still if you are short of options and money or maybe very hungry you can drop in and play safe. Only order those few 'better' dishes and peace out.

Cheers!

This place is one of the few places that serves good haka chow ! And their quantity is quite good. Don't look into a menu and order something that you have never heard of. Instead ask them which side dish would be good and you'll get the tasteful one !

Its a tiny restaurant with just two tables with four chairs each. Ambience is quiet and cool most of the time, thoigh the severe shortage of space does bother a bit. Staffs are very helpful though they do appear a bit absent minded at times!!! Food is good and taste is pretty decent. Options are many if your choice doesn't range longer. Quantity is served in each serving is good as well. Pricing of the food is pretty attractive and that makes it very economical. Its take away and home delivery is an icing on the cake for their part of service, its quick and efficient. Overall a good restaurant. Could have given a 5 on 5 but the lack of space and seating and sense of stuffiness in the restaurant prevented me from doing so.

Its a small and tiny food place at FE block, Saltlake, sector iii. This place serves good food both in terms of quality and quantity and the Schezwan items,  be it chicken or fish, of this joint are in my favourite lists. Sitting arrangement is bit small but this joint is value for money. This place is not so far from my Institute, that is why It is quite accessible  for me.

An Interesting place... 
I avoided going to this place simply because i always heard very contrasting reviews of Mallika . Some swear by it and  some hate it . BUT .... if u like Indian style Chinese food and thick Cantonese noodles . This place  is SPOT ON ! The brilliant . Mallika special noodles  were to die for as were the chili garlic chicken egg noodles. The brilliant  try chili  chicken and the gravy Manchurian chicken both were awesome . They also make a very delicious chopsuey. 

The interiors of the place are very ordinary but the portions sizes are good value for money and fresh food.... not even sightly authentic. 

p.s. what i got a kick from .....  is the red food color on the chicken gives a total street chinese feel ... ( just like the chinese shack beside my college )

Mallika is a simple yet cosy little Chinese food joint in Salt Lake and I have been there quite a few times. What I love about this place is that the service is quite prompt and the food quality is good! Every time I go there, I can make out that the food being served on my table is freshly made and this simply enhances the tastes of all the dishes. Starting from the Chicken Thai soup, to the mixed fried rice, chicken hakka noodles, hong kong chicken (gravy), chili baby corn and chilli garlic chow, I have loved all the dishes which I have tasted here. Whenever I am in Salt Lake and in no mood of visiting a crowded place to eat, Mallika tops my wishlist! I just hope they consider to make this place a bit spacious in the near future!

Chinese dishes are good.If you are low on budget,Mallika is the place where you wanna be with your friends.You donot have any sort of tax.The only thing I don't like about this resturant is it's size.Way Too Small.Only 4 tables.But you don't have to wait in a queue to get hold of a table because not many visit this resturantc,apart from the festive days.In one word about Mallika: Good. :)

Mallika is a tiny joint we used to visit a lot a couple of years back when there wasnt a decent joint for Thukpa and Momos in Salt Lake. They did make a fairly good rendition of both, but then I lost interest when better places cropped up. Nowadays, I generally go there for the general Chinese fare - the Mallika Special Fried Rice, pan fried momos, red chilly pepper chicken, Steamed rice with veg and chicken and Chilli garlic chow are all quite tasty and I personally like the chicken with mushrooms and sweet and sour chicken. The prices are reasonable, but the quality dips and lifts according to the mood of the chef.

I went Mallika on 9th june. I odered  Veg Soup, Chicken Chopsway and Garlic Fish..Soup was average. The taste of Garlic Fish was excellent. The quantity was also sufficient. The Chopsway was good but it could have been better.
