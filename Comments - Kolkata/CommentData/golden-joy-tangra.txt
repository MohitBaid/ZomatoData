The restaurant is a good one and serves really tasty food. Though a bit overpriced i highly recommend it. We had ordered chicken lollipop, chicken chowmein and garlic chicken, all were of good standard. The food was not too oily. Only the drawback of this restaurant is their service is very slow.

Visited during the last week of 2017 with my family members and cousins. Even though there wasn't much crowd, what really struck me was their extreme slow service. The staff was courteous but they were confused enough to stay at the sidetracks. The food was good but nothing much to write about.

Not a favourable moment as such.

Golden joy dated on 3rd Jan 2018 had a worst experience in my life ever.Its been too long we are coming to this so called famous Tangra restaurants and never faced such an embarrassment ever.We placed an order and after 45mins on not receiving the order thought of cancelling it rather no one came to enquire about it. It's such a shameful act that golden joy one of the renowned is not paying attention to their customers rather we are giving our card to pay no body is even bothered to collect it.We would request not to busy this restaurant ever coz they don't value their customers who are quiet old ones visiting their restaurant. Shameful and disgusted with the service and though we are paying such taxes for service whereas nothing in return is expected.

Among most of the pioneer restaurants of Tangra... this one is way better when it comes to the quality of food (at least nowadays ). Had been to most of the restaurants in the vicinity since childhood and I surely love the aroma of chinese sauce and this one is no different. Service is never a delightful experience in china town and the only exception is if you know the owner personally. Seating comfort is average, lighting is also not very good but food is mostly delicious and yes alcohol is cheap. Try and stick to common dishes like mixed noodles, fried rice, chilli prawn and dont be too experimental. Another idea is ask the waiter after explaining your tastebuds. Dont miss the prawn papad as a starter.

Had heard so much about this place in China town of Kolkata. Finally got to visit this place after a long time. We were 8 and got seated immediately. We ordered some veg starters such as crispy chilli baby corn and thread paneer and some non veg starters such as Singapore Dry chicken and chilli chicken. All the starters were absolutely delicious as usual and quickly served. For main course we were quite full so decided to only order veg manchurian, Singapore gravy chicken, veg fried rice and Hakka noodles. Golden joy is a perfect place for pocket friendly amazingly delicious Chinese food. Must visit.

Well this was our eighth visit to this restaurant and obviously the last as the behavior of the staff was extremely bad.
1. First let me talk about a very basic thing : Water... yes drinking water which even a roadside hotel will provide you first. Here even waiting for 20 mins we had to request your staff for it ,then it was given to us.
2. We ordered for the starters which came pretty late and plates were literally banged on our table and no body even bothered or asked us of serving it.
3.We ordered for main course one chicken item and another was fish .
However the fish which we ordered didn't reach us as it was converted to a chicken platter too.
After eating the same when we told the person who took our order ,he said " I told them about fish but if they prepare chicken what do I do? "...what an answer.
The second staff who came to remove remaining starter plates heard the conversation and said " a mistake is a mistake ,nothing can be done ".
Wow management what staff you guys are hiring ...a big clap and kudos to you for this.
Instead of saying a sorry for a mistake they are validating their points.
Pathetic...I score your place - 1 for this .
Kindly pay heed to what customers are saying because people come here to enjoy their time and not go through these kinds of nonsense.
I have been visiting other restaurants at China Town but no one behaves likes this ,in fact they replace the dish ...eg BigBoss restaurant has done that.
A mistake might happen but you should learn to ammend it and obviously teach your staff to say SORRY when they are wrong.
The bill that came to us was as per the dishes served but we had to correct that too ...already we suffered why too same on the bill right?
So this was our tarnished experience at GOLDEN JOY.

We have been going to Golden Joy for the last 15years. The owner Robert Liao being a close friend this chinese joint has always been our personal favourite.  They have maintained the standard of food from the time I have been visiting. The ambiance, decor and service has only gotten better with time. Its a perfect place to hang around with friends, throw a party or simply enjoy lip smacking Chinese delicacies with your family.

Visiting Golden Joy was a sheer bliss!!
The food here were really good and worth a mention however I would say the Golden Fried Prawns were really yummilicous.
Moving ahead even red pepperchilli garlic fish tasted great but the fried rice and the noodles and kungpao chicken was ordinary, not that special.
However the place and the ambience would invoke for another visit to try the other array of starters.

I have been to Golden Joy before as well but the memory was not vivid enough to give a review.
Got a 2nd chance when 40 of us from office went for a team dinner last night.
We had a private area booked for us which was so much better ambiancewise than the last time I visited this place.
Its not possible to list down the menu when 40 people go together for a dinner.. considering the variety. But we had some really good pork & chicken starters & the well known golden fried prawn of Golden Joy!
Drinks are the same everywhere.. nothing to talk about it. I had a blue lagoon vodka which was kind of nice.
The one thing I am always excited about is the dessert.. brownie with vanilla ice cream was my pick which soon became everyone else's pick as well once they tasted it.
Service was good..fast! 
Someone named Naval was in charge of our table - he was prompt, witty & we were pleased with his service.
Only setback was - There was no seperate washroom for men & women on our side, I don't know if there is on the other side.
That was highly disappointing!
Summing up.. my view on Golden Joy improved this time that I visited the place. I found the place a bit shady the last time I went there.

Happy eating 😊

So it was our first marriage anniversary and I convinced my wife after a debate of 3 hours to have our lunch at Golden Joy - China Town. Place is easy to locate in Tangra. If you are new to the city then Google maps can give you the perfect direction.

We finally reached the place super hungry and to speed up the process they even had valet parking. We initially sat at one of the center tables as it was weekend and the place was over crowded. After giving the initial order for a Haka Chili Mushroom and a Hot and sour Chicken soup we finally were shifted to a better seating place but the lack of privacy still is very annoying.

Coming down to food, soup was exactly what I have come to expect since childhood going to China town with my parents to experience authentic Chinese food. Quantity was never an issue as we ordered one medium soup and split into 2 still struggled to finish. Since it was a celebration a little alcohol is a must. The alcohol prices are quite reasonable and so is the food. Once the soup was done and dusted we found ourselves stumbling upon the Haka Chili Mushroom which was really light and refreshing and the finely chopped chilies were just perfect as a starter. P.S. My wife still thinks I eat a little too much chilies. So anyways we were almost down to the last piece of mushroom on the plate and the main course arrived just in time. Mixed Thai Fried rice and Chicken in Oyster sauce, just the perfect main course to fill our hungry tummies. The rice was well cooked with enough prawns , shredded chicken and egg. The chicken was simple and tender and the oyster sauce which was a little runny but mixed well with the rice, giving us the foodgasm we came looking for.

To sum it up a great lunch which was reasonable and refreshing.

....went there after 10 long years to celebrate son's birthday....was sceptical regarding service as the reviews in Zomato were negative to some extent..
13 people, among them were 3 upto 12 years or so. I ordered french fries 2, prawn papad2, sui mai2, shredded chicken 2, golden fried chicken 2, chilli pork½, duck roast1 for starter. Then gravy chowmein 3½, garlic pepper chicken 2 for main course and finally caramel castard9 and 3 vanilla with chocolate sauce..
To accompany, we took Blenders pride 750 ml(1800/-) and 2 Budweiser beer, mozito, blue lagoon -1 each.
Total bill costed 11370/-.
Evaluation:
1. Damn cheap @ sumptuous food. Freshness and light cooking is the key.... First impression.
2. Basic minimalist ambience, some extra leg space is required. Especially for us who were of 6 ft plus height or a bit over weight:(
3. Wonderful taste, you hardly get better gravy chowmein anywhere in Kolkata.
4. Best pork dish, please go for it without any hesitation.
5. Best fatty duck flesh, I never tasted such juicy duck before... basically they would be served very stiff at most other places.
6. Superior service, never expected such chivalrous behaviour from waiters, especially from here... The man took charge of our table was Mr. Dipak Kumar Nayek. He was pretty smart, handsome and perfectly tuned to his job. He guided regarding dish portions, assured me about anything I demanded...shall definitely say him hello, at the next visit :)
Thanks Golden Joy. Only two requests: 1. please arrange some cakes for birthday or anniversary together with the ceremonial songs as an added service. 2. Please arrange dimsum and it's variety regularly as I didn't get it today,... people nowadays love to nibble on these tasty titbits .....HIGHLY Recommended :)

Before this time I've been to China Town only once, that too almost a decade back. It's a coveted place in any foodie's gourmet map.
Golden Joy is one of the well known restaurants of China Town. The location is a bit tricky but Google map will help you out.
The restaurant is surprisingly spacious. From the outlook of it you won't be able to gauge the vastness of it. Ground floor is for men only and 1st floor is family zone. In first floor there are 2 full sized rooms packed up with people and there is another smaller sized room, which too remains packed up in weekends. There is valet parking and smoking zone.
Now about the food. The food quality is quite good. But quantity will trump any other restaurant. In any non veg item there are 14 pieces in one plate!!! The fish items are exceptionally tasty. The desserts are equally good. I do understand now why foodies prefer China Town over anything.

From the entrance I thought it is a small restaurant, was not very convinced even after entering was not very happy, but when I went to the second floor and saw all the tables and the amount of area the restaurant has I was super happy. They have segregated their sitting areas. The ground floor is for Men only, the first floor has separate halls for family groups and friends group, so that people can enjoy in their comfort. 

The food was very tasty. Being the biggest fan of Chinese, I loved all the dishes. Below is the list of items ordered:

*Sweet Corn Chicken Soup
*Tempura Prawn
*Golden Fried Fish
*Chilli Chicken Balls
*Roast Duck 
*Prawn Waffers
*Mix Fried Rice
*Mix Gravy Noodles
*Mix Mei Foon
*American Choupsey
*Kungpao Chicken
*Hot garlic Fish

We were 13 people and this was more than enough for us, the quantity of each dish is amazing.  Aslso you get alcohol here, you can buy the entire bottle and serve it yourself, it is much cheaper than a normal Pub or Bar. 

The Must try Items are: Roast Duck & Mei Foon

I won't go anywhere else in Tangra to have chinese cuisine except Golden Joy, Beijing, Kim ling and Big Boss...
Last November for the first time I visited this place.
I must say what a food quality!!
I liked their each and every food items.
And they are cheaper as well.

My favourites:
Mushroom and baby corn lut-me - medium spicy
Shrimp cake - highly spicy
Tofu - non spicy
Gobi Manchurian -medium
Mixed Hakka noodles
Golden Joy Special Chicken - non spicy

I have visited this place for 5 times in this November.

Loved it.

Golden joy is a joy of a place to be at! If you are there do order their bestseller- thread chicken (which you need to have with a dip so order one with it!), Prawn wafers (who doesn't like these??!!) And Golden fried prawns!!!
It's a cheap and comfortable place to dine at when you are craving some tangra Chinese dishes!!
Though pork is not printed on their handout menu you can ask them to customise and add pork to any dish you want!
We ordered prawn wafers, pork in mapow sauce (sweeter), pork in oyster sauce (saltier) and thread chicken. The place offers alcohol too so we ordered some royal stag.... The bottles were intact and they also have a smoking zone inside if you ask them for it. Do visit this place cause I guarantee great service with minimal pocket pinch.

Visited this restaurant on Wednesday (22.11.17) for lunch and was totally disappointed by the behaviour of the staff. Food as well as menu card was served quite late. I had to go up to the counter to pay the bill as there was no one to come up to my table with the bill; I was made to wait for around 20 minutes for the bill. Apart from the delay and sluggish nature of the waiters, the food was really good..Its a nice place to hang out on a day when one has a lot of time.

So I went there for the second time most probably with my family. It was nearly at 4pm. Honestly enough the staff were pathetic. We came first but they gave our seat to somebody else. Anyway. 
Now next the environment and the sitting arrangements. That sucked in a different level. The sofa wasn't comfortable at all. The service was poor. The waiters were unenthusiastic and were quite disgusted. Now the Food. So we ordered 
Golden joy special soup
Chilli pork
Tangy crispi chicken
Mixed hakka chow
Pan fried noodles. And these took ages to come and the waiters didn't even serve us properly. 
So anyway. Food. 
Golden joy special soup: Soup was tasty and was served in a small bowl. The chicken,mushroom co-ordination was highly appreciated by us. But the quantity wasn't enough. Anyhow 3.5 out of 5 for this. 
Chilli pork: The waiter told us that it would be crispy. Well it wasn't. Quantity was fine. And was tasty. But if it would have been tasty it would have scored a perfection.
Tangy crispi chicken: Now this was awesome. Highly recommended to have this and only this. Just plenty of this. The taste was awesome. Looked mouth watering and felt like heaven. 😍
Mixed hakka chow: This was also great. Perfect ingredients yet tasted average to us. 
Pan fried noodles: Too much sloppy and saltless. 
Overall the food was fine but the hospitality was worse. Unexpected behavior from staff. So very dissatisfied and disappointed.

First 10 minutes: 
Food = Good! 

After that:
Food = Pathetic
Service = Even more pathetic

The only good thing about the whole luncheon was the 2 items we ordered first - Golden Fried Prawns and Chicken Drumsticks (pictures attached).
Everything, from thereon was abysmal!
We kept waiting for 6 glasses, which never arrived.
A 'Golden Fried Fish' took an hour to arrive - leaving us livid! At one point, we had decided to just walk out. 
Most of the waiters seemed clueless about what tables they were supposed to serve.
Long story short, a forgettable lunch - on my birthday!

Good place for food lovers! It won't make a whole in your pocket. The quantity of food served is very good. Astonished that a medium Wanton soup could serve 3 people very well. Food quality is good, I wouldn't say exceptional. Ambience - OMG The crowd..
Verdict: A must visit place for Chinese lovers!

Golden Joy is fab to me & my friend circle due to the ambience and the food quality. It's 4th time in a year for a birthday treat.
Bombay Chilli chicken, Hunan,  Duck Roast , Prawn Wantons were superb af. 
The things to be noticed ---
1. Delayed Service. It was not too crowdy on Chaat Puja day, still the Wantons took 40 minutes to arrive.
2. No GST on beverages. But those price are raised , not same as per the zomato menu given here.

Today my colleagues and I went to Golden Joy for our team lunch. We had quite some expectations from this place as it had a good rating compared to most other places in China Town. We didn't want to go to Big Boss or Beijing as we had been there a number of times and wanted to try some place new. So we chose Golden Joy.

First of all the service was simply horrible. The waiter assigned for our table had a weird tone and literally an appalling attitude. We were a group of 10 and it is obvious that some confusion might crop up while ordering for so many people. We were discussing whether to order 1 plate or 2 plates of a certain thing which hardly took 10-20 seconds, when he suddenly said that we should decide our order first and then call him. This kind of attitude is simply unacceptable.

Coming to the food, I have to say that it was pretty average. We ordered the Golden Joy special soup which was anything but bland. For starters, we had Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Fish, Chicken Drumsticks and Crispy Fried Red Pepper Fish which were okayish. For main course, we had Kung Pao Chicken, Sweet and Sour Prawn, Mixed Meifoon and Hakka Noodles. The side dishes were good but the staples were below average.

Overall, we were very disappointed with our experience!!

Ask it in separate... Its not in the menu but they have it all the time) *Golden fried prawns *... The ambience is average.... On weekdays it gets little clumbsy... Rest overall is good.

Been here to the place sometime back with my partner. Well it was past lunch time and we were really hungry. Chinatown could have been our only savior. We drived into the place and the best thing about the place is that it has valet parking. Our car was being parked and we went in. The family space was upstairs so we headed there. But what disappointed us was the service. We kept on waiting for quite sometime. Beer was served before startes, Red Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken. The main course was mixed Thai fried rice, Hunan chicken and Singapore prawn and coke. The food was indeed tasty and the presention was good. But the behavior of the staff wasn't good. It should be better. Hope for a better experience next time.

Really a disappointing experience of a luncheon this Sunday. The already established resturant is lost in its glory, forgetting that maintaining it is a more difficult task.
Service was pathetic plates came later than the food, the texture of the meat was that of a corpse, and I guess the cook was in middle of a chess game which made the food's composition disproportionate and the serve time taking more time than a local entering Sealdah Station.

Starters were amazing as well as the main course. Service was a bit late. My friends ordered cocktails too. Nice place to hang out with colleagues and friends.

A pro tip to start with - Despite not mentioned in Menu Card, they serve one of the best pork dishes. Just ask your server about the availability and dig into that!

LOCATION AND AMBIANCE

Located at good old tangra, this establishment has seperate section for male only patrons and family groups. So not to be worried if you are with family. Seating arrangement is regular one.

FOOD

PRAWN CHIPS - Regular crispy fried prawn chips. It goes well with drinks. This chips have strong fishy flavour, so think twice if you have any non fish lover in your group

GOLDEN FRIED PRAWN - This is the eternal beauty of Tangra. Jumbo Prawn covered in golden crust, pure bliss for your tastebud

CHILLI PORK - This was the star of the show. Pork chunks with belly fat fried in light batter and sauted with green chilli and onion. Simple in preparation but delightfull in taste. We had ordered one more Pork dish which was in sweet and spicy gravy, but can't remember the name. Pork was so good that we ordered total 4 dishes!!
Again, these dishes are not in menu card, so make sure to ask your server.

FISH SAUTED WITH BLACK PEPPER - Lightly crumbed BASA fish fried with oniob, green chilli and black pepper. Agaim simple dish but great in taste.

GRAVY NOODLES - We opted for the white gravy, so it was not spicy but brusting with flavours of all the vegetables and proteins. Go for this if you dont want spicy stuff in your main course.

Overall a delightful gastronomical journey!

Disappointed with the all around experience. The food tasted nothing extraordinary. The duck roast was tough as stone and inedible. I ordered it with rs 320 and left 4 pieces of it untouched, it was that bad. The pork preparation was below average. We were told it'll be really hot and spicy. on the contrary, It was really very sweet, seemed like it was a cheap dish from a cheap place. Wanton soup and rice noodles were alright, the soup had a weird smell but taste was OK. Now, the ambience, I know what am going to share is not common but the management's reaction to it was disappointing. There was this group of almost twenty, men women and kids and for continuous two hours they shouted and celebrated on top of their voice. My God it was like hammers hitting our head.. Every customer was pissed off but pointing out repeatedly to the management didn't change the situation one bit. Nobody did anything and these crazy people, clapped, shouted, burst into laughter, shouted more and made total chaos. As I am typing this, am in a terrible headache due to their shouting. Overall experience, below average

The spread included Prawn Wantons, Crispy Fried Jumbo Prawns, Crispy chilly babycorn, Red pepper chicken,  Chilly Chicken dry and Fish Fingers among starters. LOVED their prawn starters the most. Main course had Mixed Fried Rice, Pan fried mixed noodles, Mixed Hakka noodles,Hot Garlic Chicken and Chilly Fish. All dishes were yummy. Don't forget to visit this pocket friendly place if you want some good Chinese food in this area.

I have visited this place multiple times and feel like visiting again and again for a particular dish and that is golden fried prawn, believe me its awesome. I have tried other dishes as well like hakka and gravy noodles, kung pao, lut me and mary more to mention. But till now golden fried prawn is the best. But what they can improve is their staffs courtesy. Staffs are not much attentive and welcoming, though there are so many. It might be the case that anyways they attract the crowd.

Ugghhh. The chicken here tastes super weird. It's all chewy and has a stale smell. Ambience is ordinary. They have an extensive menu, no doubt, but somehow I have always felt that their starters all taste the same. The prawn chips were good though. The main course menu of rice and noodles is better than the starters. I was under the impression that people flock to this place for its modestly priced food and drinks, but personally I feel a lot of places offer better quality Chinese food at a lower price.

First of all I have been a big fan of Golden Joy and its been my staple place.I simply loved their Bbq chicken,Bbq pork,Golden fried prawns,red pepper fried fish. The management and administration of this hotel is top notch.
Butttt... I am feeling very sorry to say I recently found some serious MISTAKE by the management.
1st one is in their menu which is showing in zomato.. The price of signature Pr is 170 and normal signature is 190. It makes no sense as per my knowledge is concerned...😳How!?
2nd one:
Yesterday i went there with my parents..Since i am a regular customer i just ordered some of their signature dishes without seeing their menu card..Nothing to say about the food and services.Food quality and quantity both are amazing.I simply loved one of their dish which i have not tried earlier ie..Red pepper fried fish.We loved that so much that we have orderd it twice (half plate+half plate)and parcel another one for my grand mother. And the bill was around 2700. I felt this time price on the higher side but i neglect that as i thought it may be because of festive seasons.So i came home and today when i am just checking my Bills, every items price is matching with the one that is there in ZOMATO except the Red pepper fish. In zomato the item costs Rs 280 (half plate 8pcs) but they have
Charged Rs 330.Not only that,the parcel that i have taken for my grand mother are of very bad quality and consist only 6pcs. This is not done seriously.
Actually the thing is i have been a regular customer to this place and money is not an issue but you should not cheat ur customer like this.
I want to say everyone whether its a 5star restaurant or a normal one please do check do check the Bill before paying. All the pictures and evidence are there!!
Picture 1&2 The entire Bill.
Picture 3. 1st mistake
Picture 4. 2nd mistake.

The food is very average and typical kolkata oily chinese. Nothing special. I came back to Tangra after almost 20yrs to rekindle some old memories. Had heard a lot of about Golden Joy.
The place is quite large and easy to find. Food i can say is average at best. But the only problem is the extremely bad attitude of the serving staff, particularly this old lanky man in black.

He is so rude to everyone, and I’m surprised why he hasn’t been slapped yet or thrown out of his job. The staff are busy arguing and there is absolutely no attention to service.

I would recommend you to skip this one.

Umm it has a mixed review. Street towards the restaurant is a roller coaster ride.. dingy.. water clogged. Parking space is comfortable. Now inside the restaurant - ample seating area.. comfortable seating.. Very authentic taste of chinese dishes. Soups are very tasty. Tried - Seafood soup, Chilly pepper chichen, Roasted Duck, Egg Haka noodles..

Must try.

Golden Joy is a well known and well decorated bar cum restaurant in Tangra, Kolkata. Like all indian chinese restaurant, Golden Joy is also carrying their legacy in terms of taste. Quantity of food items are also very good.

Service staffs are very polite, friendly and well behaved. Restaurant is also very well maintained. But the food and the liquor rates are on the higher side (what I personally feel) in comparison its competitors.

So my friends and I came here during Durga Pujo and that could have become a disastrous mistake if it hadn't been for Golden Joy's efficient crowd handling.
We were told we'd have to wait for a minimum of 1 hour, to which we agreed. We were promptly given a token with a number and sent to the terrace, where they had made seating arrangements, to wait with many others. Thankfully it took less than half an hour for them to call us and we were goldenjoyed (I will not apologize for that bad joke).
But then things got weird. The man who took our orders seemed as if all he wanted to do was sleep, not out of exhaustion but out of boredom.
The food was almost satisfactory enough to make us forget about him, especially the chilly shrimp. I say 'almost' because one item turned out to be too spicy and we wouldn't have ordered it had we not been misinformed by the sleepy man.
In any case, the food here is good enough for a revisit. 🙂

Nothing was upto the mark.. The seating looks cramped.. Tables are too close to each other.. Very noisy.. The people who served food were fine...but some seemed quite bossy.. Though we were around 6 people we were being told to sit at a certain table of their choice.. We adamantly sat down were we wanted which wasnt liked by them.. There was one bossy type fellow in particular.. Who was like this dictating guy.. And i have seen the same complaints from fellow reviewers.. I guess they too are talking abt the same goon-like bum... Who gives a rats ass to food when u get turned off by that bossy chap..

They serve amazing Chinese food. Almost all the Chinese dishes are delicious. Their Cantonese Chowmein is the best that I had in Kolkata. One of the few places which has maintained their quality over the years. Their golden fried prawn is extraordinary. It's the perfect place for a group of friends to eat and drink and have a gala time together. The ambience is good enough.

Durga Puja eve that too around 10 pm... We crashed to this restaurant in hope of good food.
The restaurant was jam-packed.We were given a token number and asked to wait in the terrace.
We got a place after 15 mins or so.
The waiter (Utpal Da) suggested all the things that we ate and boy o boy we had the best Chinese food in a while.
From starters to main course we ordered what he suggested.Amazing guy...
So now coming to the food. We ordered chilli garlic red pepper fish ( it was awesome ,and by awesome I mean best...must try) ,Thai soup (perfect spicy) and for main course schezwan noodles and mixed fried rice with garlic chicken (quantity you can choose according to the number of person,just ask the waiter).
Schezwan noodles were spicy and too good.
Overall one of the best place to eat Chinese food and I hope they keep that way. Only thing I didnot like is that...people ask for tip ..too much..from waiter to the car parking guy.

One of the renowned restaurant in China town. Went there yesterday for ashtami dinner and as usual we have to stand on the queue. If don't know the streets of China town, it will be tough to locate. Atlast, we got to seat and ordered for antiquity 750ml, crispy chili baby-corn, red chili pepper fish & chicken garlic red peper and in main course we ordered for egg fried rice and chicken manchurian. The starters were very good except the chicken preparation (very oily) and the manchurian was also less cooked. In durga puja times they are serving only limited options of food. The atmosphere was really great and the services were good. It was a great experience.

One of the best Chinese I have had in Calcutta. It has food to satisfy all tastes: bland, medium spicy and tangy. Ordered Golden Fried Prawns, Thread Chicken, Pan-fried fish, Bombay Chicken(Gravy), Chicken fried Rice and Chicken Gravy Noodles. 
By far the best dish was thread chicken, all because of the crispiness on the surface and soft chicken inside. Pair it with their spicy green chutney.
I was equally suprised by the Fried Rice, how different could it be from every other place, but the dish was colourful, perfect mix of spices and perfect amount of oil. 
I generally do not eat prawns but their prawns were soft and non-smelly and therefore I had to try it.
Rest everything was good to too but thread chicken and fried rice dishes stood out for me.
Quantity is good and rates are average for the quantity.

We ordered lut me babycorn as starter, mixed fried rice, American chopsuey,chicken manchurian in main course, blue cooler and some alcoholic beverages. What I love the most about this restaurant is its ambiance and the way they treat their customers, really heart-warming. The prize is reasonable. We were nine people and it costs nearly 5,500. The food was really mouthwatering and the quantity is ample. The chicken was well marinated with spices and sauces and I think they rest the mixture for a perfect time(for chicken manchurian). It was a yummy experience, to be precise. Totally recommended.

This place is legendary and for good reason- the food is excellent every time I've been here. Getting a table is a bit of a task since there are way too many people waiting always; however, the wait is worth it. My usual order is as follows:

1. Talumein soup
2. Chilli garlic red pepper chicken
3. Golden fried prawns 
4. Mei foon noodles
5. Red chow 
6. Anything they recommend with gravy to go with the noodles 
7. Darshan with ice cream 

There's no need for describing each of them. They're all top notch! Not a full 5 as the service can be slow at times.

Reached this place at 8pm, the crowd was decent, had 2-3tables empty.

Ambience: 9/10
Service(5/10): Very slow service, especially the parcel ones. On table, there was an old man taking orders who is not well behaved as talks like he's having a pity on us. Forced us to order mains fast, we did as we wanted. Billing took another 20minutes.

»Orders«
Starters
✩Half Golden Fried Fish(9/10): There's no competitor. It's like a fish butter fry, finger sized 7 pieces. Fresh fish, juicy and tender. Delicious!

✩Half Chicken Hakka Chilli(7/10): A good dish. Crunchy outside, tender inside. Doesn't have a strong significant taste. It isn't spicy unless you bite into a green chilli.

Mains

2x Meifoo Mixed(6.5/10): This was also a decent to good serve. Very light but doesn't have a strong flavor like normal noodles or fried rice. Decent amount of add-ons. 2 plate serves 3.

Mixed Fried Rice(9/10): This is a bang! Delicious, aromatic, flavorful, palatable. Compliments won't end. After having a spoon of this, meifoon was tasteless!

Chicken Manchurian(8/10): This was an exemplary dish, reduced 2 points because the taste of coriander was too strong, makes it more indian than chinese in it's aroma and aftertaste. 1 plate can serve 4-5 easily.

Nice Chinese joint. Very popular amongst China Town regulars. Serve piping hot indianised Chinese. Quantity is good, price reasonable. Interior is cozy but nothing fancy. Feels a little cramped when the dining hall is full(which happens regularly). Staffs are a bit nonchalant. Try their soups, wanton, dragon chicken. Recommended if you are in China town locality searching for a decent family restaurant.

One of the best restruant in China Town. I have been here before several times.. but reviewing it for the first time. Yesterday night I was there with my cousins, and the best part of this place is they keep open their restraunt till late night. And on weekends they accept their last order till 10.30P.M. 
Now about food... I love their Pawn papor...  yesterday we had Prawn papor, pepper chciken, threaded chicken, chicken noodles and fried rice and garlic fish. I personally love the noodles more than the rice. Its a perfect place to have loads of food and drink in your pocket pinch.

We ordered hakka noodles,fried rice, hunan chicken , shredded chicken, hot garlic chicken and beer. Prawn chips,chicken drumstick and pan fried fish contented as starters.This restaurant has a seperate smoking zone too, so dear smokers, nothing to worry!
Food is great, staffs are courteous, ambience could have been better though!

I have a very mixed feeling about this place. Located promptly in tangra and known to serve good quality chinese at reasonable prices, i visited this place more than once but had strange encounters.
Visit 1- it was a sunday afternoon and we had to wait for 10 mins before we got seated on their 1st floor. It was pretty crowded and the ambience is not sparking but goes fine. Even though i have no complains about their food and price, but we had to call their staff a number of times to order, and then to serve as food as they were delaying. overall---
Food-4/5
Staff-3.5/5
Visit 2- it was my friends birthday celebration and we went there with a cake. Unfortunately we forgot to bring knife and asked them for it. After asking for like 11-12 times we got one with a very disgusted look from the staff...dont know why.
Visit 3- it was an eve and i went there with my cousins, and we were sent to the ground floor gents section. even though we are non-alcoholic foodies, even before ordering any food, the waiter came to us and with a very rude attitude told us that they wont be serving drinks, not even with valid 21+ id. Though we were not even ordering drinks,still the attitude of the waiter was very bad and pretty much indirectly told us to leave if we wanted. I wasnt really expecting such behaviour from their staff. Whatever,if you plan on visiting this place,visit this place for the food- drums of heaven,pepper chicken,chilli garlic red pepper chicken,dragon chicken...all taste really great...But once again,dont even expect attention or courteousness from the staff.

I must say it was an disappointing visit. First of all their service was not at all good. There is only one man who was taking all the orders. Staffs r not that much cordial. 
Food quality wise not that great. Below average. 
Orderd Pan thai fried rice but served chicken fried rice. Though they had changed it. 
Not so happy.

Worst experience ever! Service was pathetic and had fallen down. I visit Kolkata once a year and make sure to eat here but will never ever recommend this restaurant to anyone. They were least bothered to serve water or food or to ask order. When asked to repeat the order he ignored. Seemed like the waiter was drunk! Ordered for chicken noodle wanton soup and came chicken wanton soup. I pointed it out. The waiter didn't bothered to apologise. He went in with the soup and added noodles in it that's it. Making the soup tasteless. Had ordered for chicken fried wanton and asked to be delivered after soup which got delivered with the soup. Had to ask them to take it back and bring when one meal was over. The basic ettiquite which was missing. And then the wanton came at last all cold and soft. On complaining he said that he will fry it again and bring. Whaatt!!! That doesn't makes sense ya. Why would you make all food together when I have instructed that I would prefer to have them one after another. Well that was not the end. After my lunch was spoiled and so was the mood I asked them to bring the bill. Which was Rs 870/- and mistakenly the person charged me Rs.670/-. I assumed fair enough they compensated for the mistakes they made and I left the restaurant. They came chasing me on the street with a machine and demanded for 200Rs I was shocked with this behaviour. They started blaming me that I have not paid the amount and ran away. I mean it was their staff who did not took full amount and they were charging me on the middle of the road. I lost my mind and had to get the police involved who was standing right opposite to me. Ofcourse I would have paid for that Rs200 if the approach was good.

Been here quite a few times the food quality has slowly decreased yet it still holds up against the other great tangra restaurants. The ambience is the only problem as it gets loud and boisterous. Last time I went a young girl who had too much to drink had hit her head on the bathroom sink. Ofcourse not the restaurants fault, just thought worth mentioning.

Pathetic service. Terrible food. The gold has left the joy alone, leaving nothing but dark sorrow. The black uniforms of the stewards was synonymous with their ubiquitous grim nature. They would much rather have customers wailing in agony than move their obnoxious butts around standing listlessly. Please visit at the earliest for a fantastic experience of nonsense. Cheers!

Ideal place for big groups and pocket pinch is moderate there. I went there with my office colleagues and ordered for chilly garlic chicken (dry), prawn chips, golden fried prawn, fried fish as starter. I didn't like the prawn chips much. The golden fried prawn was lip-smaking, the whole China town is famous for it, I really like the buttery smell of it. It should be definitely a part of your order. In main course I really liked the chilly fish. The vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce was good too.

Went there for a friend's birthday celebration.
We went there around 7:15p.m. The place was quite empty. As it became a bit around 8:30p.m it was house full as described as "Full house at dinner" in the "popular for" section in Zomato.
The ambience is nice with everything red.
For food we had:
1. Thread chicken: It is one of their specialties. These are crisp sticks of chicken. It separately is a bit bland but with any sauce it becomes one of the best.
2. Chicken hakka chow mein and chicken fried rice: Both were really tasty and with adequate quantity for the four of us.
3. Hot garlic chicken and Hunan chicken: Hot garlic chicken was on the spicy end whereas Hunan chicken on the sweeter end. Both tasted delicious.
With two bottles of soft drinks our meal ended.
This restaurant is one of the best places at China Town.
Have been and will surely go to this place again and again.
Happy to

It's a pretty big place and it's warm and comfortable. Their Chinese is one of the best I have ever had. It's one of the three best eateries of China town along with Beijing and Big Boss.
First I had the dragon chicken. It was lip smacking good! A bit on the spicy end. It was a shredded chicken based dish sauteed with cashews and sauce.
Then I had the chilly garlic pepper fish. This was also superb. It was crispy and hot and was made with basa.
After this we had their tangy crispy chicken. The dish was as delicious as the name sounds. It was also crispy and a bit spicy.
We had the above three dishes we a mixed fried rice. The best I had til date. It had a smoky garlic taste which I absolutely loved!
Their service is also spot on. Chinese lovers should definitely visit here without any hesitation.

When it comes to food, Golden Joy has so many hidden gems, that it would be a complete waste of a meal if you were to come here and order the regular Chili Chicken, Chowmein type of a meal.. Next time you are here.. try dishes like the Threaded Chicken, Roast Chicken with Chili Garlic or just the plain Roast Chicken, Chicken and Prawn Sui Mai, Steamed Prawn with shell, Crab claw cooked in Crab meat (not always available) and Steamed Fish in black bean sauce. I assure you, this is one meal you will remember for a very long time...

It's a suprise that I haven't reviewed my favourite restaurant yet !
Well my love for this place developed since my very first visit to the place! Located in the middle of china town, this place is a food heaven.
For starters you need to try the Thread Chicken, Prawn Waffers, Green Chilly Pepper Chicken and the Golden fried prawn. They serve some amazing thai soup. Another must have. The mixed rice and noodles are good but the mixed gravy chow is a beauty. This is my go to place for every kind of celebration there can be. I simply love the place and probably won't stop going there ever. Till I have teeth and I am alive 😁

The mei foon ordered for the main course was exceptionally good. Their service is very prompt and the staff very hospitable. The portion size is more than enough for 2 people. The ambience is cozy and it makes for a wonderful lunch.

I had heard a lot about this place and finally visited it on a Wednesday evening. 

Firstly, the location is quite in the interior, in a dark alley though the restaurant itself is bright and well decorated.

Coming to the food, we ordered chicken hakka noodles and garlic chicken. Both tasted yum, especially the chicken. But the quantity of the noodles was shockingly less. Barely enough for a single person! The bill came to 425 which was fine for the taste but not at all considering the quantity.

Overall, one of the best ambiences in tangra. Special mention to the senior staff who are very sweet and make knowledgeable suggestions about the menu. But the location by itself, is not very safe or inviting.

I would have given them 5 if they could provide me a little bit of service at all. We paid a visit at a sunday afternoon . Accepting the fact that the place was crowdy but their service was a disaster. After ordering cocktails we just had to sit clueless . It was quite funny that we had to consume alcohol without anything becoz the starters came after a long tym. But their food really deserves appreciation. We tried their dragon fish. Chilly garlic noodles and chilly pork and everything was lovely.so despite of the troubles we had to go thorough I love this place for their food only.

Bad :
1.location
Only go if you have a car or bike. Finding this place is like a treasure hunt, only there isn't a treasure. Roads are potholed and water logged.
2.ambiance
Mad rush, screeching people, some are drunk. There was no misbehaviour but it's not an ambience to enjoy.
Good
1. Food is fine, service is fast, ac works great and you will find a table despite the crowd.
But I didn't want to stay a second longer after I finished the food.
 The worst part is our bill was 1227 and they said it would be rounded off to 1230. I mean why?  Imagine 3 rs from every customer...how much they will gain on an average in a month.

One of the most legendary Chinese restaurants in Tangra and in fact, all of Kolkata and the narrow lanes and the aura of the entire locality just adds to the legendary status of this place. I went out with a group of friends to have good authentic Chinese food and they surely didn't disappoint at all. The portions served were quite decent and the prices were easy on the wallet. Overall, a must visit destination to have good Chinese food without burning a massive hole in the pocket and suitable when you're with a group of friends.

The narrow bylanes,the Chinese statues and flags...if u notice any one of these items nearby...u should be in Kolkata's Tangra....the authentic "China para" of Bangla.

And one of the recommended place of this China town is "Golden joy"

Ambience and decor had nothing extravagant in them .It was simple but nice.

Coming to the starters, we chose Sichuan pepper prawn and Chicken Satay stick.
While the addition of pepper and sauce in the prawn did complete justice to the dish....making it a bit spicy and saucy along with soft prawns.
On the other hand the chicken Satay stick was okayish as the vinegar content was a bit too much.

Then arrives our gravy mix noodles which was the best gravy noodles I ever had. The gravy was neither too thick nor too much juicy in content.
Then we had chicken fried rice with Sichuan chicken.
Both were a bit average. And I personally did not like them much.

I visited this place today, a Sunday.to avoid the rush hour I chose 5 pm. The family section was around 60% occupied that time. The service was really pathetic, they made us wait for long time, inspite of repeated reminders for the starters. They never got us the starter and the main course was served.they finally got us the starter after complaining. the sauce tray was empty and we got the sauce after very long, meanwhile the starter got cold.
It was a really bad experience service wise. Not worth the money.
Only saving grace was the food.
Fried fish was crispy and tasty.
Singapore chicken was also good.
Fried rice could have been better if it was less oily.
I wouldn't revisit after this disastrous experience. There is absolutely no quality of service.

A good place to booze, especially with friends. The Chinese menu is fabulous. Some noteworthy dishes are-
Lemon chicken
Garlic potatoes
Chicken chilly dry
Fish chilly 
All kinds of momo
Prawn dishes

The charges for alcohol are reasonable. The food items may seem to be priced on a higher side, but the portions are liberal. You understand it once you are with a big group, as you end up ordering lesser number of plates and the bill doesn't burn a hole in your pocket.

Quality, range and taste of food is very good. One of the best places in china town. Their waiters might lose track of you on weekends, when the whole place runs chock a block.

Have visited numerous restaurants in the Tangra area and have been doing so since the last 20 yrs or so. And last Friday was my first time at Golden Joy. The staff was not knowledgeable and not cordial. We had gone after office for some early evening snacks. They didnt serve any on the house accompaniments with drinks - most places atleast serve peanuts. The special GJ soup hardly tasted special. We had categorically mentioned not to put shrimps in our soup. And guess what? They did!!! The prawn papads could have been better if the oil was better drained. The chicken drumsticks were okayish barring it lacked salt.  We had also ordered fish finger - most places serve it with tarter or mint sauce. But they didnt. Overall one can experience it once.

But honestly I don't think it really measures upto all the hype.its mass market restaurant, hence don't look for ambience when you go there.but thats fine if you dont care.

The food though isn't something to talk home about. I liked the chicken fried rice and the chicken in black bean sauce.

Their golden fried prawns were ok, so was the chicken coriander  soup.im not too satisfied really, but I may go back there and give it another shot.

Work hard & party harder- that's the mantra of every youngsters' and Golden Joy is the ideal place to do party @ your nearest and dearest one. Classy though simple interior and a perfect Chinese tapas and staples are the best at this joint. Would love to visit again!

It's always great to catch up the "Tangra" Chinese cuisine, when you are in Kolkata. The authentic yet distinct taste in the food in general of Tangra restaurants is awesome.

I caught up with since friends and landed up for dinner. As you negotiate the charectetestic lanes and bylanes, you reach this place, which is pretty huge in terms of number of tables . Valley parking thankfully available.

The tangra style chilli chicken, the red pepper chilli fish were truly good. The popular golden fried prawn was a tad letdown 

The noodles in soupy Cantonese style and the chicken in hunan sauce were fabulous.

Portions are value for money. On liquor front, they have options to sell by bottle a week as peg measures. Bottle options helps!! 

Memorable place, great food.

While the food and ambiance scores, service has done it's bit to pull it down. Pathetic service by the staff. They don't even know what is being served, leave alone their knowledge on what has been ordered. I had changed my place from Big Boss to Golden Joy. A mistake never to be repeated........

It has been our family's favourite restaurant in China town area for years. Have been visiting the place for last 15 years. Good tasty food at a reasonable rate. Though there are better restaurants around, but if you are looking for a restaurant with decent ambience and food quality at a reasonable rate, Golden Joy is one good option. Try prawn papad, other prawn stsrters if you are visiting.

All the foods are delicious and very chip compared to their quantity. For the past 10 years tried almost all of their chicken staters and apart from one or two, the food is heavenly.
Golden Fried Prawn and Fresh lime soda are two others which required mentioning.
Happy Fooding with immense Joy..

Tyangra (China para) has always been known for a plethora of restaurant and bars offering cheap booze & delicious Chinese cuisine. Golden Joy has placed itself in here as a mid-range restaurant and bar, more chaotic than quaint. The "family" area on the 1st floor will give you a better experience than the "stags only" on the ground floor. Don't expect too much of professionalism when it comes for attendants at the table, which kind of gets balanced out with the almost value for money decent Chinese cuisine this restaurant offers. Crabs have always been unavailable, so not too sure if they ever cater their complete seafood menu, but the rest are good bites. Wide street in front for two way traffic & a parking space inside the building. 

A good 3.5⭐️. The service, almost borderline rude & snail paced kills the chance of the ⭐️ increasing any further. M

Golden Joy should be renamed to PURE JOY. If you haven't had chinese from Golden Joy, I bet you have not yet had chinese cuisine. One of the best and biggest chinese restaurant in town. Located in the narrow lanes of Tangra, I had never thought that I would be spell bound by this 500+ seater restaurant which server only Chinese Cuisine. I am a fan of your food.

We opted for One large bowl soup , spring chicken , chilli chicken ball , prawn papad with two budweiser beer bottles, three blue cooler mocktails , a float and two mojito cocktails. Later main course went with mei foon and fried rice and singapore chicken and dry prawn. Overall the day was enjoyable only because food and ambience was good. Staff were good too.

Why would you visit Golden joy when there are plenty of options?
Because China Town has it's own charm and you can not compare it with others.
One of the posh joint in tangra area. Not too costly not too cheap. The price of food and alcohol won't make a hole in your pocket. Best part of China Town is ; the quantity they serve is beyond imagination​. One plate of chilli Chicken would be sufficient for 4 people!! No I'm not joking!
They have spacious parking facility too, separate smoking zone, good ambience, quick delivery.

Golden Joy comes first in my mind if I am in Tangra. The food is exceptionally good here. But in my last visit I could differentiate the taste. The taste is deteriorating definitely and the price is now almost three times from initial visit. But still it is a better place to eat than many other places in Kolkata.

I Hve been to this place several times! If u like Chinese would love this place ! The dishes that stood out for me are :
1- chilli garlic red pepper chicken( starter - take small for 2 people and full plate for 4 people) 
2- golden fried prawns(same as above) 
3 - any soup with noodles (small for 2 people) 
4- Hakka noodles-shrimp, chicken (1 plate for 2 still after the starters u would be full )
5- garlic or honey chicken (same as above)  
Most importantly u could sit with a bottle of hardrinks in this restaurant!  So there is no point to wait :3
Enjoy guys :3

First the good points :

1) Food is average. Price is pocket friendly as the other restaurants in Tangra. 

2) Ambiance is also very good. Ample and comfortable space for sitting. In a busy time when the tables are fully booked, they will took you to their massive terrace where they have made their waiting arrangements, unlike others where you have to stay outside.  

3) Service is quite fast after giving the order.

Now, after reading the the above review, one may wonder that what the point which has made me so dissatisfy. All the things which we normally look before taking the service of a restaurant is OK here.  

Here comes the point :

When we go to a restaurant, it not only the food and ambiance, we also go there to get pampered. Just imagine a restaurant, where the person taking your order is not even looking at you. He was looking at other direction when you are asking him for a perfect menu. 

I have visited there thrice and every time I faced similar problem. All the three times I had attended by three different servers. And most surprisingly all of these three lack courteousness. They behave like they are managers of the place. I am probably not able to express the feelings I got all the three times, in a single line I can say that I was not very satisfied their way of answering a simple questing, "what you suggest to take today?" They are clueless about what menu could be suggested to a person who is asking for different dish. 

Its only happens when the servers are not properly trained about the food and doesn't know how to pamper the customers by guiding them to a proper menu which they relish and satisfy their taste bud.  

So, I will be not visiting this restaurant again.

Chinese Cuisine Luncheon @ Golden Joy, Tangra, Kolkata ☺

When Golden Joy, the popular Chinese restaurant at Tangra (China Town) was zeroed in as the meeting venue for an upcoming food meet, I felt like both laughing and crying. 

Crying because - hard core non veg and booze serving outlets of Tangra were clearly no-zones for teetotaller vegetarians like me. 

Laughing because - the foodie and blogger in me has long been yearning to cover the vegetarian options of at least one such Tangra based outlet.

Having taken the adjacent lane on the right side of J W Marriott, my car was required to travel a big network of narrow unruly lanes, before it finally reached the designated Golden Joy restaurant.

Upon reaching I saw that, situated on the first floor of it's establishment, Golden Joy was a flurry of activities and running in full capacity, catering to the Sunday lunch need of it's patrons.

Our table comprised of around 15 people. The vegetarian options ordered therein for a select few and also magnanimously opted by others over their non vegetarian counterparts, comprised of -

- Beverage -

- Blue Cooler (Rs. 150/-): It was the usual soda and sugar syrup based Blue Curacao mocktail. It expectantly tasted nice.

- Aerated Beverage (Rs. 40/-): It was the mandatory serving of Coca Cola, that most of the vegetarians require to pair with the otherwise dry Hakka Noodles and kind of semi dry veggie preparations of the Chinese Cuisine. It tasted fine.

- Starter -

- Thread Paneer (Rs. 330/- for Full Plate): Long cottage cheese fingerlings, were generously coated with some marination and cereal based bhujias or juliennes. We savored them with the available green chutney. It was nice to come across a fritter preparation where the outer coating was not batter based. The dish tasted quite nice. 

- Main Course -

- Mix Fried Rice (Rs. 170/-): Infused with mostly fine choppings of carrot, spring onion and some peas, the Fried Rice was slightly orange hued. It was well cooked and tasted nice.

- Mix Hakka Chow (Rs. 170/-): It was a well cooked and tasty Chow Mein plate, infused with long and thin strands of regular onion, spring onion and carrot, along side some cabbage chunks.

- Manchurian Gobi (Rs. 250/- for Full Plate): It was a big bowl of minced cauliflower dumplings dipped in thick soya sauce based gravy, which was strongly flavored with fine choppings of enough garlic, spring onion and coriander leaves. The dish tasted nice and well complimented the other two dry main course dishes.

The restaurant comprised of a good number of serving staff. They were quite prompt in their service.

All in all, it was a lovely and comfortable Sunday lunch, enjoyed with a new set of foodie friends, with the anticipation and wish for sharing many such luncheons in the future!

Service at this place is getting worse day by day. We waited for almost half n hour to have the glasses to have water. Then another half an hour to have tissues at the table. We ordered flesh lime soda which was served without any fizz in the soda and then the waiter hesitated to change the drink. While ordering the food the waiter captain Mr. Utpal took the menu from my hand like almost snatching it from me. 
We come here everytime for the good food they serve here but the service is the reason we might think twice the next time.

I was in golden joy with my friend. I was always prefer golden joy over other resturants in china town. But the experience i had today, just few minutes back.. I will think twice to revisit this place. Feeling very sad to write this review. We 2 ladies, wanted to enjoy friday nigjt over a couple of beer.. They took the advantage. 3 times i had to change the bill, and finally got the correct amount, after reducing it. The differe9is rs1200.what do u expect. Two ladies, drunk? Then they took 3 attempts during payment. 3 times they mis typed the amount, or they gave the excuse of me typing the wrong pin.. Is this the behaviour i expected?? Sorry golden joy management.. U have ruined my night.. I will never go to this place. Now i realise, if u want to go to china town, u need a male. Otherwise they can rob you..

Quite sometime since I went out for dinner. So yesterday we decided to reverse the trend. And since we were in the vicinity of Tangra, we thought of trying out Golden 
 Joy. The ambiance of the place is good, and on a Friday night, it was quite crowded in there. We began with a Smirnoff small, but after that we decided to focus on the 
 food instead. We had Chilly Garlic Red Pepper Fish, Spring Fish, Chilli Shrimp, Mixed Fried Rice, and Thai Soup. I have to say, the food is awesome, especially the 
 Chilli Garlic Red Pepper Fish, and Chilli Shrimp. The taste is just brilliant. We did not order any gravy items, not even as a side dish for the Mixed Fried Rice, 
 which we usually do, since we were really interested in gobbling up the Chilli Garlic Red Pepper Fish, which, in fact, we had ordered twice, something we dont remember 
 doing quite often anywhere. So, that itself goes to show we really liked the food yesterday. And even after such a hearty dinner with quite a lot of items ordered, the 
 bill amount came up to be around Rs.2500/- which we thought was okay. At other places, it could have easily shot up to an excess of Rs.3000/-. So, in the end, we were 
 really satisfied with the experience. Recommending it for others to try.

So for a quick indulgence in Chinese delicacies without straining the wallet, Golden Joy is the place for you.

Drinks are cheap but they don't give any complimentary snacks with the drink and you have to pay for it 
Overall an ok experience nothing great only thing good about this place is that if you are going in a group they will serve you bottle and that too at a very nominal price .

This is my sixth time at this prestigious restaurant and perhaps my worst experience there. The food is still brilliant be it the appetizers or the main course. However the case in point is the service. We went in at 6.15 PM which is relatively an off time but there was no one to offer us water. Furthermore, we had to ask for the menu card but the food came in hot and early. Most of the waiters looked confused. Most disgusting is the way the watchman and other chauffeurs ask for money for bringing the car over. It's literally demanding money rather than expecting a tip. I strongly recommend the management to look into this issue.

This is one of the best Chinese restaurant in the china town area. It has maintained its brand name for years now. Coming to food, its just perfect. We had chilly garlic red pepper for starters. For maincourse we ordered chicken sichuan fried rice with semi gravy Hunan chicken. It was good and delicious. Drinks are pocket friendly. 
However the management is not good. Theres a improper coordination between the waiters who serve us and the cook. Service is slow rather very slow.

Golden Joy is undoubtedly one of the most popular restaurants in the Tangra area . I have been to other restaurants in the locality but this is my first visit to this restaurant. It has got quite large area with parking space which is otherwise a problem during busy hours in Tangra . Seating area is large & comfortable but service needs improvement .The service manager was calling waiters while he was busy with his own work . We tried the following : 
Fresh lime Soda : Being non alcoholic opted for lime soda which was usual .
Golden Fried Fish : Contains 7 pieces of fish in half plate while 14 pieces in full . We opted for half plate as we were only two . Fish quality was good but the batter should have been better . Nevertheless a good & enjoyable starter .
Mixed Cantonese Chow ( gravy ) : I love gravy Chow & accordingly ordered it . The gravy was light yet tasty . Quantity is adequate though they do not provide egg in their mixed chow .
Chicken choice of Sichuan : We asked the manager to suggest a suitable side dish to accompany the chow & he suggested this . It was a bit spicy but I would have loved it to be spicier . The combination with chow was quite good. 
From my visit I got the impression that the restaurant has tie up with some corporate houses which allows their employees to have parties in large groups thereby making the place a bit noisy for my liking . I prefer to have my food quietly with my partner . I would have loved to try out one or two more dishes but since the place had become too much noisy  I decided to leave . If crowd & noise is not an issue with someone then this is a good place for you or look elsewhere .

DISASTER CALLED GOLDEN JOY!!
Hands down this is the worst restaurant that I have ever been to!!  Where should I start with. 
FOOD: absolutely average. Nothing spectacular or anything which can be talked about.
SERVICE: let's start with the waiter who waited our table. He had absolutely no patience to take the order properly. Though the restaurant wasn't even half filled. We had to call him back in order to assure that he has got everything right, including the point that none other than Hot Garlic chicken should have any chicken in it. 
After some time, surprisingly they served the appetizer and main course together. As we were going through the main course dishes we found hair in our Prawn Fried Rice. Upon calling them, we told them to replace it with another same dish.  And this time without checking our original order they served us Prawn Chicken Fried rice. Later we noticed that the Egg noodles also had chicken in it. On bringing this to their notice, their excuse was 'it might have slipped into it somehow!'    
The waiter, John was an absolutely fail in his job. He didnt seem to bother at all with all this. Later the manager, a lanky figure appeared and shared the same confusion like others. 
With a ruined mood and disastrous family lunch, we left the restaurant after paying a hefty bill of over rs. 1800/- for absolutely nothing which can be called enjoyable.  
Price: overtly hyped. The food is absolutely mediocre and doesn't deserve such pricing. 

After getting some recommendation, we chose Golden Joy for our driving-away-monday-blue lunch. But....it only made our day worse. 

Attached images: plate of fried rice with the hair.
Relatively empty restaurant.

I am here  with my wife, son and two nieces. This is one of the popular Chinese food joint in famous China Town in Ranges , East Calcutta. It is Saturday evening, we reached the place at 7.45 and the place is already near full. The ambience is average but clean. Service is fast and efficient. We started with clear chicken soup then  shredded chicken, a deep fried chicken finger coated  with rice noodles. It was followed by the house speciality golden fried prawn , spring fried prawn and chicken drumsticks. You can order either full (14) or half (7) plate of each dish. Then came pan fried noodles with chicken. Noodles was very well prepared with crispy and gravy combination with lot of chicken and pick choy and broccoli. We ended our dinner with Dar San served with Vanilla Ice Cream. Preparation was good with adequate quantity . When we finished our dinner and coming out huge number of guest were waiting patiently outside for their turn to get their table, such is the popularity of this joint.

Probably the best place in China Town serving authentic Chinese cuisine apart from the usual mundane indo-chinese dishes that is available in every corner of Kolkata- from the street food stalls to dhabas and the big air-conditioned joints. Signature dishes: Golden fried fish/prawns, suimai, shrimp cake, pok choy, Dragon eyes (24 hours advance order) and rice noodles. Kenneth, the restaurant manager is the most knowledgeable person here, and one would do well to seek his advice while placing orders as he has the uncanny knack of suggesting the best, based on the customer's preference. Good ambience, specially earmarked family sections and liquor availability (other joints in the area also serve liquor) make this place a favorite of every Kolkatan.

It's after ages that I stepped into this restaurant. But time seems to stand still here. It's the same ambience same servers & same delicious Chinese Food. A cacophony of sound greeted us & I found it extremely comforting. My main attraction was their roast duck & I wasn't disappointed. Soft & succulent pieces filled my mouth with the heavenly taste. There's nothing much to say about the restaurant with their noisy crowd & busy servers. Rest of the dishes were good. It's real value for money. To me it's the authentic Chinese food.

The location of the restaurant is great. The first advantage it has ample space for parking facility. So you can now move on to have some lip smacking Chinese. The quality of food is great but the quantity can be debatable. So if the food is great why only 3, because service is pathetic. The waiters are slow, unprofessional and unpredictable in few cases. They served our order to another table. Especially on Sunday afternoon the restaurant is crowded and they don't have a proper management to handle the crowd. 
So if only taste matter it's a must visit but service is pathetic.

I love golden joy. The food is par excellence. The unique flavors are best thing about this place. They started off with a large room and now have expanded to 4 large sitting areas. The weekend wait would be at least 30 to 45 mins, so be prepared for that. We generally order dry snacky food and so many of them that we rarely are able to order any fried rice or noodles. So if you want Chinese there is no place like golden joy. Try yam wanton, chili garlic chicken, thread fish, chili chicken dry. Oh no I'm drooling now...!!

We visited Golden Joy for an office party on Friday. As expected, the entire restaurant was crowded but we managed to get a seat. The person taking the order was courteous and what I loved about the place was the prompt delivery of the orders placed. 
Coming to the starters, we ordered Pepper Chicken and Prawn Papad. Pepper chicken was so tasty and the chicken pieces were soft and tender. For main course, we ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Hakka Noddles, Schezwan Chicken and Hunan Chicken. I personally liked the Mixed Fried Rice more than the Mixed Hakka Noodles. Both the chicken dishes didn't quite go well for me and I found the taste bland. The waiter told us that Hunan Chicken will be spicy and so we opted for that. However the taste was pretty sweet and didn't quite go well with the rice and the noodles. 
It was an average experience here at Golden Joy since we had much more higher expectations.

I would say that food is overrated at Tangra, in general. Golden Joy is a decent place. Must haves are the chilli chicken dry and golden fried prawns. They serve 14 prawns in a plate! That's a rarity for people living in the interiors of India and away from the waters!

Rice and noodles were average. So were Chicken Manchurian and Chicken hot garlic. Chilli Paneer was nice but the Prawn in garlic pepper was a disappointment. 
Prawn crackers are said to be the best here though i wish they'd add some rock salt or chat masala on top. They charge a hefty 150 bucks for a basket.

Overall..with drinks included.. the bill came around to be around 11K for 10 of us..including desserts.

The Service sort of disappointed me. Everyone was in such a hurry and it was only when we tipped a waiter that he went out of his way for us. That reflects the understaffed situation at hand, considering the crowd that visits them every single day.

All in all, had a good time with relatives at Golden Joy.

This is one place in China Town that I have visited multiple times, the number probably into double digits by now... But the latest experience this evening would probably make it my last for some time to come... Lets not get into the food, which was pretty bland by the way, the service is way too bad... Rude, arrogant staff, who make you feel as if they are doing you a favour by serving you... In a service industry, I am not sure how they are flourishing with such poorly behaved staff...

Good food, quality service, smoking room, bar, great crowd management, and a roof top waiting room add to its advantages, though the roof top view is bad! but overall, judging every aspect, this is best choice I have. so i cab easily recommend to all others, fellow foodies.

My Go-to place to grab a quick Chinese munch on. It has a range of lip-smacking starters - Dragon chicken , wooly's chicken , red pepper chilli garlic fish / chicken , golden fried jumbo prawns and the Siu-mais are to die for. 
In case you have got space left , finish with the main-course : yamein (Maggi type gravy chow) , steamed fish and chicken manchurian . 
Lovely place , good food , pocket friendly pricing. Must go.

So good that I couldn't take any pictures. 
Rarely do you come across food that's so good that the entire family quietly eats without a word. This was my first experience at Golden Joy. And I'm not even talking about their brilliant hospitality. Made us feel right at home. We got assistance in selecting our lunch from the vast menu and boy was it all worth it. The crispy, juicy and succulent golden fried prawns are all you need to give this place a killer rating, but don't. Have the noodles and the sides of fish and prawns. What a privilege to be part of this heritage. Loved every morsel. I will count my days till I come back to this city and hit golden joy for another meal.

I think golden joy has been my best experience of Chinese in Tangra so far. Their golden fried prawns were crisp, juicy &soft at the same time. Loved it. I could taste the flavour of the fish which was quite fresh and tender in their fish in spicy & sweet sauce. And everything is so so cheap compared to other cities. I mean it's worth every penny.

This is one of my favourite place in town for starters and I visit this place often. I love their starters menu, quantity is lovely and also because they serve alcohol on the basis of bottles and not pegs which goes a little light on the pocket. For starters, have tried their Chilli Garlic Red Pepper Chicken which is my favourite, favorite here. And also had Lut Me Fish which I found had almost the same taste as the chicken except for the fact that this was fish and that being chicken. The Golden Fry Prawn is a must try. Then for main course had Mixed hakka noodles and Chicken fried rice and Sweet and Sour Chicken which tasted very ordinary. I found no specialty in there. Staff were courteous and the ambience is good.

This is not a place you go to if you are looking for a fine dine or a classy party. Want to chill out with you college friends and relive those lovely memories where you drank like crazy?. Then this is what you are looking for. This is one the few places where they serve full bottles instead of regular pegs at reasonable rates. And that does the trick. I have visited the place quite a number of times now and its been a nice experience overall. The 1st floor has the family section with a separate smoking zone. Not very extravagant and lavish in the decor but overall a good service. The food menu also offers good choices, different kind of meat in a variety of sauces, etc. The Pork Mapo, roast duck and the mixed gravy noodles being my favorite. If you are visiting the place during the weekend or during the festivities make sure to check in early to avoid long waiting hours. Overall a pocket-friendly good place for a few drinks and chinese food.

The main course chicken hot garlic was also very tasty. Quantity of food served is also very good. They serve drinks and the menu is quite reasonable not too expensive 
The only thing I din like much was the dining hall the interior decoration reminded me of a dining hall at a marriage function. Rest is good

It was our second time there.. due to saraswati puja the crowd waa unexpected.. the main hall was full and so as the waiting room.. after 15 mins they started the second room and in no sec the second rool was full again.. but the service was very good. We ordered drums of heaven, veg fried rice, hot garlic pepper chicken. Each and every dish is amazing and mouth watering.  Special mention to the green chutney or sauce on the table. Few say that the waiters are rude.. i can say that while managing the crowd like yesterday one can easily get rude. Enjoy your food buddy

My first foray into Kolkata's Chinatown.....Tangra.
I'd heard a lot about the many restaurants being operated there by the Chinese settled there and the awesome food served therein. But I was quite disappointed.....The experience wasn't as good as I'd expected.( Maybe it was this particular joint, though it's quite reputated, which was the culprit). On entering only I was put off by the behaviour of the maitre d, who came and curtly asked us to sit elsewhere. When we asked why he said that since we were a group of four we shouldn't occupy a table meant for six!!! But why? It wasn't as if there weren't other vacant tables, the place was only half full. When we refuse he insisted it was company policy!! I was completely put off and would have simply left the restaurant and gone elsewhere but it was already late for lunch, we were famished and one friend was in a hurry having an appointment later. So we placed our orders, soup, starters and mains. The Thai veg soup was good. The mains, veg Hakka noodles were also good as was the sweet and sour vegetables. 
My friends had a chicken starter and also a chicken preparation in mains and were all praises. They also asked for prawn chips.. The service was fast . Nothing wrong with the food but the initial welcome was  extremely off-putting!!

A sudden plan of lunch landed me at Golden Joy. It has been a long time since I had made a visit to Tangra so I was all excited to have some Chinese delicacies at China Town. So I started my meal with the very popular golden fried prawns and they really lived up to their popularity. They were just lip smacking! Next I had mixed meifoon and Singapore chicken. The meifoon was good but the chicken was not as good as the other two dishes. But overall I would definitely like to go back to this place to have a sumptuous meal.

No doubt this is a very nice restaurant. Food is very nice , prices are up to the mark , though for some people it may be overpriced. For the ambience , I think there are a lot of pictures to help you out by other reviewers , although I didnt find anything that bad about the ambience , you might feel a lack of privacy . A lot of people say this is the best in Tangra. I feel its a Great place to go with friends and family.

We had a big office dinner...  Few days back...  The food was good...  As one can expect from golden joy...  The ambience was as expected of a busy office crowd ..  But the lower rating from my end are only due to some service...  First it it felt like the managers taking order did not want to entertain a big crowd...  As one kept pushing the other...  However at last they took in orders..  
As you know it gets complicated while ordering for 30 people or so... At the corrections to the orders...  The waiter in charge kept on grumbling... Even at the end he was like if you want to pay tip...  Pay me separately...  Don't show or give in the bill folder...  He kept on repeating the same like 5-6 times... Was not a good experience as he really looked an experienced guy.  

However the food and the price all included was a good place to go

This has become my mandatory spot for an after office hangout with co workers. Been here multiple times and tried series of dishes from golden fried prawns to Peking duck, fish in garlic sauce, chicken etc. Though this place has disappointed us with food a couple of times with their inconsistency , still I would give them the benefit of doubt and keep visiting for the joy it provides to create golden memories.

One of the worst services you will find over here. The upper section of the restaurant is said to be for family but saw stags being seated. We were 6 people (all guys) but they couldn't give us a seat upstairs though it was empty. And they cited that it was for family. We were asked to go to their down section which was for stags , we agreed to that happily as the down section was full empty. But to our dismay the waiters there were asking us to seat in a particular seat which we were not comfortable as it was too congested so we insisted on a different seat but the waiters started talking to us rudely and became abusive . And we had to forcefully come out of the restaurant . Avoid at all cost if you are going with all guys.

One of the best Chinese eateries in the City . Located right at the heart of Chinatown,this place is certainly a paradise for Chinese Cuisine lovers. This place provides such good food and drinks at decent prices that once you've visited,you will keep coming back here.  
The best part of the place is probably its universality ,its ability to be attractive to all categories of customers.

Looking for a place to grab some beers and hot snacks ? Perfect Place.

Looking for a good three course chinese meal with your family? Not many better places in Kolkata.

A treat with friends/colleagues where quantity of food and budget is key? It is Golden Joy you want to go to.

To start with,its spacious.It can accommodate around 200 people easily .There is nothing fancy about the decor,furniture or the menu and the simplicity is evident even from the service of waiters.When it comes to food though ,they elevate themselves to a completely different level and blow all other competitors out of the water.Visited here multiple times and tried many dishes .Can confidently say that they don't have any let-downs in their menu.Would strongly recommend their Roast Duck.It is delicious and filling.Served with barbecue sauce ,it is perfectly roasted in terms of texture and the flavor is something words can't really describe.Lu-mein and meifoon are well made here along with regular hakka and cantonese style noodles. Tried the Korean sticks once,which is a unique dish in Kolkata's Chinese scene.Lipsmacking dish.The quantity of food is always good. A  plate of noodles can suffice two very hungry stomachs. The quality of fish and meat are always top-notch.The service is always swift,even when they are catering a full-house.

Recommendations- Roast Duck,Korean Sticks, Mixed Lu Mein,Golden Fried Fish

This place easily has serves the best Chinese food in the city. Went there with my family on New Year's eve, and was surprisingly pleased with the efficiency of service and quality of food there, despite the large number of people inside the restaurant. The grilled chicken, prawn and the mixed fried rice are must haves for anyone going there, and the rates are pocket friendly as well. Would love to go back there soon!

Since I stay very close, this restaurant I our go-to place when we crave for chinese food! The ambience is decent but it gets too noisy on a busy dinner evening. The staff is friendly.

Coming to the food, id recommend the manchao soup, the Chicken Cantonese noodles, Hunan chicken and sweet and sour chicken!

We had  sweet corn soup, roast duck with chili garlic sauce, mixed lu mein, mixed hakka chowmein and hunan fish.
My personal favorite was the roast duck and lu mein which is a made with a thicker variety of chowmein and gravy. Although all the dishes were indeed very tasty.

Tucked away in the desolate streets of tangra is golden joy! We had the golden friend prawns, roast chicken , sea food soup and chicken Hakka noodles . Each order was excellent with 'authentic' Chinese taste. My reco would be the roast chicken and the noodles with a little serving of tomato ketchup . Service is not diffrent from other Kolkata old timers - quick, no nonsense and occasionally rude. Coming back and will recommend.

Golden Joy is perhaps the most visited Restaurant in China Town when it comes to the native Kolkata people. I myself used to go there a lot during my engineering days, and somehow found myself again at this place with my childhood buddies last sunday. This place is famous for its alcohol menu which they still serve by the bottle, a practice which seems to be missing in other China Town outlets unlike the days before. Thus by this, it really makes for a value for money outing with friends.
They are masters of Indian Chinese finger food to compliment the drinks, with the Prawn chips being the top attraction. This time round for starters, we tried the Thai Fried Chicken, Crispy Fired Fish, Chilly Baby Corn, Fish in Oyster Sauce and chicken in bell peppers. I loved each one of them as it reminded me of my childhood days and the fact how much I missed this type of food. I do suggest to try the baby corn with the green chutney that is served on the table as its marvelous.
For mains, we had the Mixed rice and chicken meifoon to go with a hunan chicken. I loved the rice noodles as its been some time I had it and it was cooked to perfection.
Golden Joy is, like the other china town restaurants, a value for money place where you cant sit back and enjoy with you friends with drinks and great food. Its a big hit for the student community and to the people staying outside town. Easily a 4/5.

Golden Joy is perhaps the most talked about restaurant of Tangra. They have a good sitting capacity but the tables are too close to be comfortable. Inner ambience is just ordinary. Drinks are priced hefty may be because it has got more takers here. Barring few special items, most of the dishes (including rice,mei foon &noodles) are quiet ordinary here and carry a pegged up price tag. Chicken BBQ was quiet delectable here. Service was sluggish. Overall, it's just ok  to have an one time experience out here and not to expect much of a satisfaction.

This place is like every foodie's dream place to be!
Reasonable rates and quantity is too much! 😍
We went there in evening and the place has a quite good ambience. We ordered 3 beers and the alcohol was quite expensive in comparison to the food over there.
For starter we ordered deep fried baby corn and the quantity was plenty for three of us.
For main course we went for chicken fried rice, Thai chicken fried rice along with Schezwan chicken.
Trust me when I say that! The food was enough for 3 of us who can eat like monsters.
The staff was very well behaved and helpful!
They have a smoking area too.
The pocket pinch was around 2,200 bucks but it was worth it.

Must tell the prices are way too expensive as compared to the environment and ambiance of the place. The only freedom is you have the option to buy the entire bottle of liquor and have it accordingly if you aren't willing to  go for pegs. Food is good. Services is not atall up to the mark. Its a Ideal place if you are wanting to visit it in a group.

I went for my Anniversary dinner for the first time at this well known and reputed eatery. While entering I was offered parking inside the building, as soon as we parked we were asked to park out on the road. We ordered for food and inquired about Golden Joy Special Chicken a waiter with dark complexion, medium height and moustache said straight on our face that it has a white gravy u won't like it... How did he know about our liking and he walked away. The overall food was dissapointing the starters - Fried Prawn and Chicken Satay Stick had no garnish and dips. The satay stick had no hint of peanut as it should be and was batter fried instead of grilled. The Mei-Foon had no salt and was oily. Bar B Q Chicken and Chilli Chicken was average in taste and nowhere near its class. Upon leaving I did not feel like giving any tip, the waiter opened the folder in front of me and sighed looking at me that it was empty. He discussed the same in front of us with another waiter. Left the place really dissapointed...

You may find it strange but I have not been to Tangra area much .. barring 1-2 visits to Big Boss, Beijing , etc. This may be because of the fact I am on most occasion dont take alcohol.
This was my first visit to Golden Joy to celebrate a friend's birthday. Missed out on Roast duck which I heard is their signature dish ... it was exhausted by the time we ordered it. We were mostly into starters .... We had chili shrimp , Lut me Chicken , Chilli garlic red pepper prawns and loads loads of Prawn chips. The tastes were really nice and economical as per as its respective costings. The atmosphere was nice but bit noisy as lots of people came over. I could sense its a very happening and favorite place of many. Given a chance I will definitely want to visit the place once again.

Being honest I must say, the Golden items (both prawn & Fish ) were pretty ordinary in taste but not the cost. Both the things were fried with a golden coating. They used an ordinary batter made which is very similar to Fish Butter Fry or Fish Orli. The texture were good and it was obviously a nice choice to have with liquor. They served a hot green chilli sauce which I felt a must apply on the golden fries.

Threaded Chicken was an absolute surprise. Very simply made but pretty tasty. soft tender chicken coated with crispy noodles.

One of the hotspots of tangra, a minute or two walk from beijing inside a lane. Ambience and setup is much better than most restaurants there. Decor is minimal, just enough lighting to click decent pics :P. Service at these restaurants should not be commented about much, we were just glad to receive our food before we fainted out of hunger.
Anyhow three of us were there for lunch, so we ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken for starter which was quiet spicy and complemented our drinks. For main course we got chicken meinfoon, fish in black bean sauce and mapo chicken. We were very happy with the taste, quantity. Fish was very succulent and tasty, while mapo chicken was spicy and a bit tangy both of them went well with the rice noodles. And of course there was no room for dessert so we are keeping that for next visit. :)

The Ambiance was good like all the Chinese restaurants in that area.  
Coming to the food now for  staters we had ordered Chilli Garlic red pepper chicken  and red pepper Fried  fish which was really Outstanding!
 👌
and for the main course we had ordered Mix chowmein ,chicken chowmein and Bombay Chicken .
"Bombay chicken " was really superb prescribed by the waiter..i was really very spicy and tasty 👌👍 
In the end  we have no complain about the food because it was perfectly tasteful and worth the money we paid. ☺😊

If anyone asks you what Calcutta chinese is, this is where you take them. Located in a small lane in tangda (Car parking is not an issue, they have a valet), this place has 2 sections, one for "bachelors" and another for "families" (Because bachelors don't belong to families) 

The food here is good, I'd recommend the threaded chicken and golden fried prawns for starters, mixed chowmein or fried rice (Contains chicken, fish,egg and prawns). All other side dishes are very good be it chicken, fish or prawns. The price isn't too high and there is alcohol available here by the bottles (For the nights you want to stumble home)

The service is an issue as the waiter takes forever to come to your table to take your order and hardly gives suggestions on what to eat, so my advice would be to go with a friend who has been here before, that way they can give you the best opinion on food to order and eat here.

Family-like restaurant in Tangra. People walk into the restaurant even after 10 pm. Nice staff and are cooperative too. Authentic Chinese food is available, which definitely will make you go there again and again.

The restaurant is hard to find and don't go if you hate walking and don't have any transport..😜
Anyway, the main reason for visit was roast duck as i wanted to have duck next in my long list of things to taste..
And surprisingly the duck was good.. 14 pieces in full plate.. but the pieces are uneven.. and the duck..though tasted good is not for everyone as its a bit rubbery.. 
Then we also ordered thai fried rice and schezwan fried rice(which is a bit too spicy).. with hot garlic chicken which tasted good.. 
The decor is nice and the mango and choco ice cream was good too with jelly inside..
Overall you can have your meal there but i have eaten better chinese..
The staff was a bit rude i thought or maybe they had hearing problems.. nevertheless.. good experience

My experience with Golden Joy is particularly not good since I went in with my friends during pujas and only boys were not allowed to be in the main restaurant. It's embarrassing for us who are single you can't be biased on that basis. Talking of food it was normal and not exceptional to excite me for a visit again.

If anyone asks you what Calcutta chinese is, this is where you take them. Located in a small lane in tangda (Car parking is not an issue, they have a valet), this place has 2 sections, one for "bachelors" and another for "families" (Because bachelors don't belong to families) 

The food here is good, I'd recommend the threaded chicken and golden fried prawns for starters, mixed chowmein or fried rice (Contains chicken, fish,egg and prawns). All other side dishes are very good be it chicken, fish or prawns. The price isn't too high and there is alcohol available here by the bottles (For the nights you want to stumble home)

The service is an issue as the waiter takes forever to come to your table to take your order and hardly gives suggestions on what to eat, so my advice would be to go with a friend who has been here before, that way they can give you the best opinion on food to order and eat here.

Golden Joy is a Chinatown restaurant in the classic sense. The food is actually quite nice. The Duck dishes are quite nice and the Thread Fish is quite nice for an appetizer. Expectations should be food-based and not ambience based.

China Town is very close to my place and in any occasion, I always end up here with my family.
I had very high expectations with this place. But all went down when I visited this restaurant last year.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE: Ambiance is okay. Just like all the chinese restaurants around this area.
The service was bad on both the times I had come here. The waiters have a very callous attitude. Moreover, it takes very long for the food to arrive.

FOOD: We ordered a Mixed Thai Soup and Chicken Wantons for starters. It was a BIG mistake to have ordered "MIXED" for the soup! I don't know if they were some kind of worms or octopus' tentacles.. I don't know.. that typical weird smell made me feel like throwing up. Never order "mixed" in a chinese restaurant in China Town! The wantons were dripping oil.. and the filling was okay.
For the main course, we wanted to try the authentic and very basic Hakka Noodles and Chilli Chicken (Dry) and they were good. We also ordered a Hot Garlic Fish (Gravy) and it was fine.

3.0 rating for the other restaurants in Tangra that serve better chinese than this place.

Those who call this good Chinese have no idea what good Chinese is, heck they don't even know what decent Chinese is.
The service is shoddy to say the least, everything takes a zillion years to get to the table and the servers behave with a downright i-dont-care attitude.
I've never witnessed such a callous attitude ever before.
As for the food; the duck and chicken was dry, so much so that they were leathery. The golden fried prawn was dripping oil. A main course that we had ordered with rice never arrived.
The overall food is ...well...for the lack of a better word crap, the ambience is crappier and the service, crappiest. Never again.

If found the place to be highly overrated after visiting on a Sunday afternoon having heard so many raving about it. Firstly Service- the waiters are just not bothered to provide you the menu which we got more than 10 minutes after being seated, on a not too busy afternoon. Then they took the drink and starter orders and asked us to place main course orders only after the starter arrived to prevent confusion (strange).
The beer arrived first without any accompanying dish, and the starters much later by the time the drink was finished.

In the meantime we asked the waiter what Golden Joy special noodles was and how it was different from Mix Lu Mein - all he could say is both were boiled noodles and since he sounded very discouraging about both we ordered Hakka. 

Similarly on asking about Assorted Vegetables with Chicken, and whether it could be made a little on the dry side (it's in a section of the menu where you can specify whether you want your dish to be gravy based out dry, he was of the opinion that for dry we could have something like Chilly Garlic Chicken as dry. Going along with his suggestion, we ended up having both main course and side dish as dry items... Which eventually did not turn out to be a successful combination.

Overall it maybe good for groups but for an afternoon out with the wife, not recommended

Had heard a lot bout this place, before finally deciding to hop in and give it a try. To start off, found the ambience to be quite neat and the seating capacity is quite high as well. The staffs are quite friendly as well. Considering its one of those innumerable chinese restaurants in the locality, it needed something to stand out, and it did. It did with its food. The food is subtle, you get exactly what you ask for, not overdone in any way. The prawn chips is is something that everyone in tangra serves, and there's nothing to mention here. What came next was what impressed us. Dry chilli shrimps. It simply melted in the mouth and it was just perfect. The thread chicken is something that i heard of a lot, and there were high expectations when we ordered for it, and honestly, it didnt disappoint us. I can still feel the crunch on the top and softness of the chicken inside.
To cut it short, well done. Only drag, found the liquor a bit over priced. Food was fairly priced.

Prawn chips is a must have item here. also try the pork items, they make is just awesome.
You can order full bottle of alcoholi here, and it is pretty much cheaper than if you take single pegs.

Went here for the first time after reading so much positive review's of this place on Sashthi. Due to Durga Puja, most of the items were missing including the items which we wanted to order. Anyways, ambience is like any other China town restaurants, accommodation is huge and they also have parking space. We ordered 2 full plates of Fried Spring Chicken and Golden Fried Fish. Quantity and quality both were great, specially the fish was too good. After having these, we were too full to try any main course items. Looking forward to try out their other items.

Not the best Chinese joint in the city, yet one of the good ones serving authentic Chinese. The restaurant is pretty spacious although I won't score them well when it comes to service. Service was slow and it seemed as if they were a bit unorganized.
Coming to the food now, I won't be doing justice if I complain about the food because it was perfectly tasteful and worth the money I paid. 
For staters I had the Chilli Garlic red pepper chicken which was Outstanding!
The chili garlic chicken they serve is one of the best version of the dish I have had till date.
Do try the Thai soup if you find yourself there soon!
In terms of food this place scores really well but definitely needs some work on service and presentation.

A bit of a mess is the location , which is inside the Chinatown , a long way into topsia. Amidst the tannery odour , you come across this place , get inside , and immediately get transported to the far east! The ambience is fully Chinese , with the scripts hanging on the walls , and plenty of Chinese folks dining . The food is a marvel , with Hunan chicken and Hakka noodles ruling our minds . My friend went for vodka , and said , he loved the experience! Nice!

Food was average "Just average" I have been to better places in kolkata for chinise. WORST!! staff ever there was more staff then customers, even then I had to wait 20min for someone to take the order, this guy starts taking the order, for a bit I was confused if I was placing the order or taking an order. I wanted to place starter and mains at the same time but this guy wouldn't take the mains order. Anyways we places an order for the starter. Food finally arrived.  After finishing the starter we had to wait another good 15-20 min for someone to take the order for the main course, now again the same guy comes to take the other "rather making me feel that he is placing the order". OK we had our food, asked them to get the bill, the bill comes with x 3, x 2 which we haven't even eaten or placed an order for  ( highly recommend all to throughly check bill before paying ) called an staff to check the bill the same guy comes pretending not to remember what order we have placed. Well they took the receipt to make the adjustment which took them good 30 min. 30min ? To adjust the bill? Reall ? The the staff that took the order openly asks for tip. OVER ALL THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER, WILL NOT RECOMMENDED THIS PLACE TO NO ONE.

worst experience on special day.. its about 1yr ago.. went there with friends to celebrate my gf's b'day.. it looked decently attractive but first thing first.. waited to get any menu for 10mins, but thats ok then there was no waiter around to take orders.. they're literary gossiping among each other.. u wont believe they're voice was the loudest out there.. thats not it they're actually checking out girls and passing comments.. i was actually looking for manager but couldn't find one.. management waa so poor.. food was great though. i recommend Big Boss is much better in terms of both taste and service.

Now its about 3days back i went there after year and thought things might have changed and improved but i was wrong, those same few waiters. But i tell you what..this time price were much increased and taste was degrading.. Myself being from Northeast wanted to experience good chinese food but in my experience i feel Big Boss, Kim fa, Hot wok, Beijing is much better.

If you wish to try authentic Chinese items in Kolkata. Golden joy is your destination. However since I m not much of an authentic Chinese lover, I did not like it's food that much. But it's definitely worth a try for once. Service is more or less quick, but delivery service is awful. They take a hell lot of time. Pricing is moderate I would say with the food served.

This Sunday morning had us thinking about crispy crunchy thread chicken from our good old Golden Joy! Lets take a trip to China Town? 😁 If you're in Calcutta the chances are you must have heard about this place. Every Calcuttan has an undying love for Chinese cuisine so much so that we have owned our very own version - Kolkata Chinese. Everything spicy (and oily! 😜) 💫
The long narrow lanes leading to these Chinese joints serving lip smashing food will zap you back to your childhood family dinners and good old college days because the pocket pinch pretty much suited our pocket money. Well, not anymore (or maybe its just us, Designers earning peanuts 🤔). Golden Joy is one such joint serving delicious food since ages. Though the service has gone a little bad recently but we swear by its Thread Chicken! Its crispy on the outside and as you bite you get the succulent chicken inside. Super Super appetiser (with your mug of beer or not!).

Situated in the heart of Tangra China Town in kolkata. The lanes are narrow, but u will feel that u were in the lanes of China..the Ambience of the restaurant is always busy...

Now coming back to the food we have ordered
Thai fried chicken,mixed fried rice,and Bombay chili fish...all the dishes were too good ...the quantity is enough for two people...

They do not  take much time for serving the food...
But one thing the waiters are not proper trained for satisfying the customer...overall it is a good restaurant...and the price is reasonable and affordable...

When Codfather failed to impress we decided to fall back on the trusted Golden Joy for the rest of our drinks and dinner. As usual i loved the chilli pork which is mandatory for me to order there as it is one of my favorites. I guess this is one of the places that serves the best indianized chinese in town

Situated in the heart of Tangra China Town in Kolkata..You will feel you are in a lane of China.The Ambiance of this Restaurant is always busy and during Christmas No way..Till 11:30PM they entertain Customers with their Delicious Food!
100% Authentic Chinese Food
If You want Taste and Quality try out this place.
Each time I go I always return with a tummy full and smile on my face.You will be suprised to see Bengali Families all relishing chinese food.
I have tried out Mixed Fried Rice,Duck Roast,Chilli Chicken,Deep Fried Prawns(Starters) and Caramel Pudding(Signature Desert)
Amazing Duck Roast cooked in soya and light garlic.
Their Caramel desert is a must try and people often end up ordering two two for each.Its light and balanced.
Price&Service is great.
They serve yummy Prawn Chips as a starter too.

One of the oldest, biggest  & most popular restaurants at China Town. 

Average ambiance & decor. Due to it's full house status, the place becomes too noisy at times.

We were there for lunch on a Sunday. We ordered Fresh Lime water, Fresh lime soda, Lut me fish, Chilli garlic red pepper chicken, Mix fried rice, Mix mei foon & Singapore Chilli Chicken. 

The Lut me fish was awesome. All of us loved it so much that we wanted to re-order it. This dish is recommended for all!
Chilli garlic red pepper chicken was good too.
Mix fried rice & mix mei foon was average. 
Singapore Chilli Chicken was disappointing. Should have been more spicy. 

Service is okay. At times sloth. 
Serving time is around 15 minutes. 
Price is reasonable. 
Portion is sufficient.

One of the oldest restaurant in China Town,tangra, this is a place I have visited very often, but the service standards keep detoriating Everytime...
The service standards are horrible , we weren't served water until we asked and when they did they gave us a bottle stating that they were out of glasses...the restaurant want even full at that time. We had to wait for at least 20 mins before we could get the attention of any waiting staff to place our order and food came in another 20 mins later. We also had to ask the waiting staff twice to clean out our starter plates...

Food was asusual upto the mark, not outstanding but tasty and the portions were good. 
Decor and ambience .. simply laid and okaish.

I would have rated this place a 4 had the review been ONLY from a food perspective! We have been frequenting this place for a long time now but today was a day of negatives! The place was quite full for a weekday dinner..6 of us were made to sit in a separate section. The area was smelly n hot! They switched on the AC..closed all the partitions, the place started getting comfortable. In the next 10 minutes, a group of 12 people arrived! We were asked "to get shifted" because apparently the guests were acquaintances of some known "leader." I was disgusted..threatened to leave the place, by then our order was placed! Nonetheless, with senior family members we had no other option!! We were FORCED to shift elsewhere. I AM NOT visiting this outlet ever again!!!
On the food front, the chilli garlic red pepper chicken was all about the batter and was undercooked! The pork was chewy and oily. The fish was good and priced at a whopping 500!!! The noodles and the chicken was bearable.

Food,ambiance everything is so average and the pathetic service. You literally have to scream for the Waiters. The staffs are like they are walking in park,no hurry,no professionalism in their attitude. Food was okay and red pepper chili chicken was a good suggestion by the staff. This was my second visit to China town and this time it was not so pleasant. Only good thing is,it's easy to locate.

My friends had been here for a couple of times but this was my first time. It's spacious & good for family time. We ordered Su mai, crispy red pepper chicken, mixed fried rice, mixed rice noodles, gravy chicken chowmin, Bombay chicken & chicken Manchurian. Bombay chicken was too spicy. Other than that, everything was balanced. su mai was great - not too spicy & soft. The service was good. THOUGH, there's a weird rule. They will not allow your driver to park your car in the parking space. You have to do it yourself or use their valet parking service. Other than this, it was a good experience.

Located in Tangra this restaurant is a little in the hiding. A small lane leads you to this place. However the restaurant is huge and has ample parking space for 40-50 cars. I guess more than 60 Tables. I tried some regular Chinese dishes which included Manchow soup, Golden Joy special soup, and clear soup, fried pepper chicken, Hakka Noodles, Cantonese Noodles, Fried Rice and Gravy Rice.

The food was delicious. Service was a bit slow. 

Main reason why restaurants in Tangra are popular is because of the cheap pricing of Alcoholic beverages and you will find drinks on 9 out of 10 tables.

If you prefer a non-alcoholic environment then this place will not make you comfortable..

Some seats bear the wash room are also uncomfortable as the odour is unbearable.

Had to change 3 tables.

The best part is that the food will not disappoint you. On Sundays there could be a waiting for 2 hour if you do not make it by 9 pm

We wanted to have a great Sunday Family Lunch and we chose Golden Joy, Tangra being the choice of the majority in the group.  It was crowded but luckily we did not have to wait. It has a huge sitting area and the first floor is for families. And the huge parking space is a plus point. We had ordered many starters as everybody was demanding their own choice to win. The threaded chicken was a new dish for me. It tasted good with their chilli paste. Among all, the crispy chilli mushroom is worth mentioning - it was delicious.  We had a nice hakka noodles for the main course. And the sweet and sour chicken tasted funny. Overall the food was good. What bothered me was the inattentive and the rude staff. They were often mixing up orders and moreover, being impolite.

Fish item was good but chicken was unexpectedly bad.. It didn't have any taste rather taste like baby corn... Don't know why...we said the same to the waiter but he answered don't know why. Decoration was simple n neat.

Golden joy is a very old restaurant of tangra. It's a huge place with a lot of seating capacity. Has valet parking too. The decor in the lower section which is for men only resembles more of a shady bar with false ceiling and blue lights and the upper section is more brightly lit in golden yellow color among red walls. Coming to the food ,try the red pepper chilli garlic chicken. It's really good. Be it the fried rice or noodles, if not very good they are better than most in the city. The rice especially is the better one . The noodles can do with a little bit more of boiling and penetration of spices . The chilli chicken was not as good as the starter though. A very good point of this place is that you can avail bottles of your choice of alcohol. The price is a little higher than moderate , but it's good value for money.

It was little pale. The place is huge approx 100 heads. This place also provides a hall for small parties. The first floor is generally reserved for families. I could see that the place was packed during peak hours. Interiors could improve. Still a thumbs up though!!

Out of all the places in Chinatown I have had food in, this is the least recommended. The quality of food is not at all impressive. We had ordered 4 different dry chicken preparations and surprisingly, all of them tasted the same. The place is good enough, the staff look as though they are somewhat forced to provide food to the customers. If you are in Chinatown, not a place to be

Within the huge list of Chinese restaurants in tangra area Golden Joy is the best considering the food taste . It is pocket friendly restrurent too . Cocktail lovers can also get different types of cocktail but not a very wide range. Altogether if you want to taste authentic chinese food with limited budget it is one of the perfect selection .

The overall price is justified with food quality and quantity. The best part of our experience: the manager suggested item we ordered and talked in lengths about the pros and cons of each item.   I recommend this chinese eatery whole-heartedly.

That time i thought probably because of a sunday night the food quality is bad but went there for the second time with frnds nd had the same bad experience. Ground floor is for gents nd the 1st floor nd rooftop r for family. Ground floor loo is the worst place,disgusting nd smelly. They have their own parking space inside. Niether do i like their food nor their service. All the items are more or less same in taste. Would avoid this place from now.

The predominant issue here is their service. The waiters are not attentive and then do not give a damn to the inconveniences faced by their patrons. The place used to be one of the jewels in Tangra but has now lost its charm. With a big sitting space, and separate area carved out for family, the food here is quite good. However, be content with the starters, as most of their main courses have a tendency to be overtly sweet. I would have rated this place a bit more, had it not for their unprofessional and rude behavior.

One of the famous joints of China Town, Golden Joy is really good place for a family dinner. It has separate areas for family and stags. The ambience is good, nothing specific to mention about. The decor is decent. Coming to the food, I had mixed reactions. The starters were delicious.....do try their Thread Chicken....simply awesome. We also ordered pepper chicken and chicken sweet corn soup. All were good. The side dishes of the main course, however, disappointed me. Chicken in black bean sauce and schezwan chicken both were too sweet according to my taste buds, but the gravy chowmein and Hakka chowmein both were good. The staff is also courteous. Good place to visit in Tangra.

I don't know how this restaurant got a a 4/5 rating in Zomato!!I have no complain about food. I will give 4/5 for food.
For ambiance too they will get 3/5.
Now comes to service. They have worst of a kind staffs!! They are busy in chit chatting among themselves. You need to raise your hand and mostly shout out "excuse me!" to get their attention. If you are lucky enough they will pay you hid!
After 2nd round of order we asked for menu card again. Someone gave it and before we could see an unprofessional staff took it away to give it to another visitor!! I mean seriously?? with this kind of behavior you expect customers to visit you again. After that we called up a staff waving our hands, shouting out loud, he just overlooked, as if he can not listen to us!! It is just GOLDEN DUCK for golden joy in service! 0/5
We have ordered 1 plate prawn chips, 2 plate mixed hakka noodles and a plate of dragon chicken. It costed us 1000 rupees in total. So 3/5 for cost to quality ratio!
 Hence it is 2.5/5. May not visit soon.

I attended a little gathering here . Ambiance was ok. Not very elegant or grand but the place was crowded and full. The items that were ordered were thread chicken, fish cutlet, prawn chips, prawn pakora, chicken roast.

The chicken roast was nice and yum though little on the sweeter side and i personally dont prefer sweet food except for desserts. The prawn chips was nice but hard and bit too oily. Earlier prawn chips used to be fluffy but this was not upto mark but the fish was good and the prawn pakora was indeed yum. The thread chicken was a disaster.

Next i had a chicken tom yum soup which barely had any chicken and was full of mushroom and tomato. Honestly food wise i would any day prefer beijing. 

Staffs were quick and cost was good enough. You dont expect much in tangra except good food but this place was just average.

I often go there, may be just because of the Legacy that this locality holds. Food is decent. I would appreciate if the quality of chicken they serve is improved. It would add an impeccable taste to their dishes. The staff is rowdy, all because of their popularity. I hope this changes. It is not really economical as the myth may be. 310 for a bottle of beer.

Tangra is the place to be when looking for good Chinese in Kolkata. And this place is my personal favorite . Try the crab soup and it won't disappoint . Wanton and starters are just amazing

I heard a lot about golden joy. So on a sunday i decided to finally visit this place. I went with my family. My experience was horrible. 
Ordered white gravy chowmien it was okay. The rest was all below satisfaction.
The service was so slow. After waiting for an hour for our food the waiter served us with the main course first. When our meal was almost over he brought the starter chicken. 
I am never going to visit this place again. Beijing anyday❤️

I have visited few restaurants of china town.This being one of them we a gang of girls decided to visit them for lunch...
They have a different sections for Men and this surprised me a lot..
The interior was ok but the taste of food was really good....Some of the staffs were well behaved..however the one who took our order was little slow..Some of them were also staring at us may b bcoz we were boozing and they haven't seen such things before...Lolz!!!

We had ordered for..
Prawn chips,crispy chicken,golden fried fish,dragon chicken,Hakka noodles and lime soda...All of them tasted superb!
To end of..
I have given 3.5 only and only because of the taste of food..Honestly I didn't like the ambience at all!!

Well m dining here at this point. Seriously speaking being a big time foodie I didn't like anything about the restaurant neither the service nor the food. Food quality and presentation does not match with the price at all. 'Value' for money is a big no no here. So I would suggest don't waste your time and money here. Big Boss is far better!!

Extremely disappointed with the place. We came here on 26th May'16 at around 10:30 for our dinner. Since it was late, The staffs behaviour were awful. Found a strand of hair in one of the  dish we ordered. When asked about that, they took the entire dish to the kitchen saying that ' they need to show it to the chef.' When asked to keep the plate down they  started arguing. After few minutes they did serve us with a new plate. But the staffs were undoubtedly unhappy with that.

Will not recommend this place.

Golden Joy just gives you immense joy in terms of an exquisite food experience. The combination of a few drinks coupled with their dry chilli chicken or garlic chicken can eradicate the agonies of a bad day at work! Oh! And the golden fried prawns! What can I say?...16 pieces comes at a neat 800 bucks but guess what?... you can't resist ordering another plate...and then maybe yet another one...;-)

This restaurant is really very spacious. 
Food quality is good. 
Staffs are bit rude and not that welcoming, may be because of the crowd.

There is a reason that this place has proved itself as one of the biggest establishments in China Town. By biggest not only do I mean the sheer span of its seating capacity but also in terms of reputation.

This is my first choice, when planning a trip to China Town and the place always manages to welcome me with mouth watering food. You MUST try the golden fried prawns. The coating is airy, crispy and succumbs to your bite and melts away within moments. The brawn is buttery, smooth and oh so fresh. There is a plethora of other dishes that you can choose from the vast menu and most of it is absolutely great. 

The flavors hit your taste buds in the best way possible and you are sure to come back for more. Absolutely love the food at Golden Joy.

Among the huge list of the restaurants in China town Golden joy remarkably has made their presence so alive with their offerings is all I can say.

**Location**
Located at tangra the China Town. Situated just the opposite small lane of Beijing . Rather enter China Town from the back gate and you get this one at the end of the lane.

**Decor & Ambiance**
A typical China Town restaurant with a huge sitting arrangements. The best part is their waiting area at the roof where u get to sit as well. That's a perfect thing to do...
Ambiance is a bit clumsy yet u can find your own space.

**Food**
This is where they score more and indeed a great one. I loved their food like anything .. Good taste and standard quality is the key also the quantity is huge. That's a plus too for having your meal at China Town.
It is a pure Chinese restaurant so no room for experiment I haven't done so.... Try out different style Chinese dishes..

My recommendation would be

Starters
Lat mai kei
Fish salt n Pepper
Soups
Thai soup
Lung fung soup

Prawn papad is lovely too as appetizer :)

Mains
Cantonese mixed noodles is my fav
Fish in hot garlic sauce
Kung pao Chicken 
Fried rice are good too.


**Service**
Service is the key here and they totally nailed it from the beginning. Loved the idea of token system waiting very good tactics for managing crowd also the waiting area mentioned earlier in the review. The person serving are very attentive and responsive. Well behaved and very well trained too.
All in all a great experience every time I visit this place.

Pretty good joint I must say. Nothing extraordinary, your typical Chinese place. Food is really good, quantity is abundant, loved the decor, service is very prompt. People who aren't experimental with their food, unlike me, will simply adore this place. Not that I'm saying its a bad place, it just lacks a bit of flair to make it standout.
Recommended place.

With Chinese in our hearts and not a lot of money in our wallets; a friend of mine and I, decided to go old school. We jumped on to a cab and headed straight to Tangra, aka 'china town'. With the advent of pan-asian cooking, like khao sueys, sushis & thai curries our good old Bengali style Chinese is getting de-popularized. With the hope to re-tantalize our taste buds and to reminiscent those days our lives when Chinese meant Tangra, we walked up the stairs of Golden Joy. We got seated in the family area and the restaurant was quite spacious. The restaurant has a lot of staff members, and most are very well versed with menu. Everything about this place is old school, from interiors to staff to food.

We ordered: Lut me chicken. It was oily, but tasted quite delicious. It was primarily fried chicken strips tossed in ginger, garlic, onions & spring onion.

They had 3 kinds of sauces(or garnish) on the table: chilies in vinegar, orangish colored chili tomato sauce(tasted bad) and green colored chili-corriender leave sauce. This was delicious and very hot. Balanced well with the lut me chicken.

Then we had, Thai mixed rice. This was very very yummmmnyyy and had was quite spicy. It had lots of veggies, chicken, prawn & egg.

We had Stir fried chili chicken with the rice. This had subtle garlic flavour. It tasted mediocre(without rice) but didn't blend well with the rice at all.

We also had Fresh lime soda (sweet). It came in a big beer glass with kingfisher logo. It was nice.

The hot garlic chicken is really awesome. Lut me chìcken is truly delicious and the pudding is also quite upto the mark. The cantonese chow is also very yummy and the chicken schezwan fried rice is just awesome. The fried chicken wantons is also nice. Overall it is one of the best places in kolkata to taste authentic chinese cuisine.

Pros: soup
          Quantity of food. 
Cons: main course and starter needs    improvement

Food Taste: 8/10

Value for Money: 8/10

Ambiance: 7/10

Variety: 7/10

One of the best places in Tangra that balances good food with serving whole bottles of Booze at the table. An approach that certainly creates a lot of satisfaction.

The portions of the starters are fairly large and make up for in variety where they may slip up on in quality. Unless what you're ordering is a plate of "Thread Chicken" or other bone dry dishes, you may be a little disappointed with the amount of oil soaked Chili, Capsicum and Onions that sneak into a plate that was supposed to filled with meat.

The staples and the main-courses are better. And after a few drinks, go down exceptionally well.

This place is perfectly suited to cater to large groups, owing to an extensive seating area. Ideal from all aspects for a re-union of old friends or for office parties.

For me the best restaurant in Tangra. Most of the times I am in Tangra, I go for Golden Joy. The ambiance in nice, so is the service, which becomes a bit slow in peak time, which I think is understandable. Great food quality. They have good parking facility.

I love their Thai soup. The prawn papads here are not oily like we get in so many other places. The golden fried prawns is a must try dish too.

After a long time returned to Kolkata from my office work and decided to have Chinese food with some of my friends over drinks at Tangra. And I was really glad that I chose this place because the atmosphere was great and even though it was fairly crowded we were not made to sit for long. Anyway the prawn items were mindblowing and the fried rice was also good. I think the Cantonese soup which my friend ordered could have a little better according to him because it was too spicy. Overall satisfying experience and will definitely visit again

This place is fast becoming the most pooular Chinese restaurant in Tangra. It is hard to find seats in weekends as it remains full all the time. Each Chinese item is amazing and tastes awesome. It was hard to resist the golden fried prawns and the chili garlic pepper chicken. The cheap booze is another reason why so many youngsters flock China Town. But it was the delicious Chinese food which takes me to China Town and not the booze.

Family dinner on a lazy friday. Heard a lot about this place so checked in. Started off well with smooth Valet parking. House was full but was lucky enough to get a table. Ordered chicken Manchow soup with Tangy Fried Chicken and Oyster Fish...Soup was OK...Chicken was bang on...Fish was very good... I feel it could have been top class if it was little dry with more spice...Chicken Fried Rice with Hunan Chicken, Fresh Lime and Coke summed it all. Both were good and upto the mark.
If you love eating in din..right place to be in...
Good Food....Good Quantity... So it's a Gang Place...

Golden Joy is one of the most well known place of tangra. IV been here around 4 times and one word that best fits the place is - inconsistent. 
The first time I came here, I tried the chilli garlic steam fish and it was amazing. The remaining 3 times that I visited here, three different experiences. At times, burnt garlic, at times its too oily, etc etc
Other than that, it's a gud place for boozing with big groups. Theyve got a lot of staff and service is very fast . the lighting is dim and it's more of a muted decor. 
The latest experience was very bad. I ordered the fish again, caramel custard pudding, chicken mushroom and coriander soup, chicken Thai Hakka noodles and lime juice 
The steam chilli garlic fish : too oily and burnt garlic
The soup: was fine. 
Chicken Thai Hakka noodles: I didnt really get the "Thai" part of it. It was just a normal chicken Hakka noodles.
Caramel custard: worst of the lot. It was max custard powder , with a powdery texture. If it costs 80bucks, it couldve  very well been fresh
Lime juice : luckily, fine.
Pros:
1. Prominent location
2. Good for boozing
3. Appetisers are good.
Cons:
1. Inconsistent in taste.
2. Some items are low quality
3. Food is too oily.

Sorry if I could not give this joint a green signal. Had pretty harrowing experience with oily food / seating arrangement / astronomic beer price / delayed bill / indifferent staff. Had chilli pork with no chilliness in sight, it was oily pork. Golden fried prawn was again coated in seven layers of oily batter. Nauseous. The saving grace was prawn chips, which anyway is the same all over chinatown. Had no idea drinks had become so prohibitively costly here. 5 of us ran a bill of around 8K. Had to wait for the bill though for a good 15 minutes. Seems their billing section is in some another part of the chinatown, took forever to produce the bill. The staff was indifferent bordering on rude & it was not crowded at all. Nope, I will definitely skip this joint next time.

Again a boys night out to china town with friends.. i got review from my brother thats this is a place with good food. So decided to try it out.

To start we had starter Lut me fish and chilly garlic red pepper chicken.. both we the opposite in taste.. the chocken was spicy and the fish was sweet.. gave a nice blend of taste.
We then hit the main course with
Chicken thai fried rice which i personal did not think it had anything extra ordinary, it tasted like regular fried rice.
Chicken Sichuan Chow it was  not very spicy ap per my taste coz i like a little spicy food, but for non spicy lovers this might feel spicy..
Along with Kung pao chicken without nuts which was really good in addition to Stir fry chilli garlic fish which i thought was not cooked well.. the smell of bhetki (Sea Bass) was eminently felt which makes u feel its uncooked.
Over all the experience was good with good service and very average decor.....@

I had gone to this place on a friend's birthday. It was my first visit to that restaurant. The entrance seemed little constricted and it was misleading. We were welcomed to a large room with neatly placed tables and other required accessories. I specifically remember the prawn since it is the best I have ever had. It was large, soft. Even the rest of the items were equally tasty. The place might seem a little pricier than other restaurant nearby but it is worth it. I am eagerly waiting for another visit to that place.

I rarely eat Chinese, but when I crave, this place is closest to my home and has amazing Chinese food. It's located in the Chinese hub..Tangra!!
I have never visited the place so no reviews on any of it except the quality of food. I always order the food and then a take away.
The Hakka Noodles are great,unlike the changed versions of other restaurant, it was quite Chinese.
Chinese Rice Noodles are also good, Schezwan Noodles, Stir fry noodles with and without gravy both are too good.
Crispy chilly babycorn is bad sadly. Try out this place!!

Family style restaurant in Tyangra. Good Chinese at great price alongwith good service. 
Foodie tip: Pork lovers don't get dissapointed to see there's no pork item on the menu...just request the waiters separately for chilli pork and try that out with beer ;)

China town is the ultimate destination for Chinese food. Golden joy is one of the the few restaurant which serves you with mouth-watering food. If you pay a visit dont forget to try the prawn dishes. Its pocket friendly and great place to go with your gang.

Golden Joy is a sad reflection of "what could have been". The food served is very average. Certainly not something you would travel for. But the service is pathetic! The typical attitude is, "boss this is what you will get here; we are full so guests be damned." We had gone to have a family get-together, and ended up enjoying ourselves in spite of the service level goof ups.

One of the top most restaurant in tangra, with a huge sitting capacity and a nice ambience,u will get some authentic Chinese food here. And the quality and taste of these foods are just amazing. Highly recommended for Chinese food. If you have been to tangra before and haven't visited Golden Joy you have to do it. The behavior of crew members are also nice, gentle and humble. I would definitely say, this is one of the best places to have authentic Chinese food in Kolkata. Last but not the least, this place is very much pocket friendly for sure.

I am not a great fan of any of the china town resturants.. Mainly because of the locality and the crowd..I heard a lot about this one and reluctantly decided for lunch at golden joy. It's a large noisy eatery for Chinese food lovers. The ambiance is cramped with basic interior.. Food is good. We ordered two starters one of fish and another one of chicken with different names..but both tasted same., the fried rice and Hunan chicken was good, 
The  waiters were friendly..  I loved the experience as I had good company and enjoyed the presence of dozens of people around me enjoying their lunch just like a collage canteen.

Golden Joy is located in the lane to the right upon entering Chinatown, just a few metres away from Beijing restaurant. A group of seven friends travelled quite a distance to locate the place and dined here earlier tonight. It's not everyday that I get to visit Tangra, so the sight of an array of Chinese people was pleasing. 
The restaurant has acres of space and can accommodate even a regiment of soldiers looking to replenish their stomachs in importunity. The ambiance, going by the location of the restaurant also surprised me. Waiters were friendly and knowledgeable. 
We ordered Drums of Heaven in entrées since no one was willing to gamble on the orders and were pretty hungry. It tasted perfect. 
It's a shame I didn't go through the menu on Zomato and my friends were pretty disappointed upon hearing the unavailability of Pork. Thus we decided to keep things simple and settled with Mixed Hakka Noodles with Kung Pao and Hunan Chicken. I was slightly disappointed with Kung Pao chicken as the sauce wasn't worked well and it tasted pretty bland. The rest were rightly prepared. Service wasn't very quick, and when you're hungry, you tend to put it under your list of issues no matter how good the food.
To sum up, I was happy with the dining experience and drinks seemed reasonably priced to me. Surely visiting again.

For me China Town always meant one place and that's Golden Joy. It has stayed almost the same over the years. Everything about this place is superb. The food is great, the price really easy on the pocket, even more so when dining in a group. They have lot of room. The service is a bit slow at times but they make up for it on all other fronts. My favourites include - Golden Fried Prawns, Thread Chicken & Mixed Meifoon.  The added bonus here is the option to order drinks by the bottle. All in all a great place to invite friends over for a treat or a group lunch or dinner.

Golden fried prawns, chicken threads, chili pork, chicken fried, meifoon, schezwan rice and mix all these will alcohol per peg or a bottle itself. You do get the idea ? 
Great place for old friends with loud voices to relish memories of school or college alike. 
Be it friend or family, you can always rely on the place. Though the service time needs a touch up, yet memories attached to the place would definitely push me to a 4.0.

Situated at the heart if Tangra, it is very easy to locate.Decor is basic but like most of the restaurants here they make it up with their swift and apt service along with their food. If you are visiting during peak season and hours be ready to wait and it can get a bit noisy so bear with that.

Coming to the service they are extremely swift and fast along being communicative with their suggestion.

We ordered Golden Joy special soup (Small-easily proportionate enough to suffice a single person) ,along with Chicken Ham choi stew rice and Sichuan chicken (Half-which again can suffice two easily)  ,Lastly followed by Brownie

Coming to the starter The Golden Joy special soup was brilliant, thick soup with large succulent shredded chicken portion and nicely diced mushrooms will uplift your mood any time of the day.I really liked the fact that they have options in terms of Quantity as in Large/Medium/Small which can be look at the needs of diff. appetite. 

The Chicken Ham choi stew rice went well with Sichuan chicken, quantity wise both the dishes can easily suffice two individuals with an healthy appetite. I really liked the way the stew rice was made ,boiled at the right measure so that the rice is intact and yet soft not melting alongside maintaining the stew factor well infused with the slices of ham and chicken. Sichuan chicken had the right touch of spice and flavour infused into the delicious pieces of chicken which played a perfect role of a sidekick that made the main course brilliant. A must try combo

The finishing note was nothing less than yummylicious as it ended with the brownie, perfectly scintillating the taste buds.  An encore is surely on the cards to try the rest of the dishes that they have to offer,Drinks are available aswl and prices are very much on affordable rates.
Bill including all the above and soft drinks along with taxes came upto @730 INR trust me ,this is bigtime afforable considering the amount and quality of food on offer.

My family and i are always a regular at the tangra restaurants. But never did we know about this place. But some years back we were told about this and since then we have been a regular here. Practically once every two months we make a visit. The food is obviously good which one can make out by the crowd inside. Though lunch time can be a little less crowded, dinner time its packed. Quality and quantity of food is always great. The lightings are too dull for selfie lovers.

We ordered their mixed mein-foon, chicken fried rice, chicken in oyster sauce, lemon chicken and tuborg strong. I must say, this place serves really awesome Chinese food.

Golden Joy is one of the most decent restaurant out there in Chinatown. Though hard to locate, it sees some loyal regular visitors. 
The drinks are cheap. The foods are cheap too and even cheaper if a large group visits as most starters and side dishes serves 14 pieces(full plate). 
The chicken drumsticks are different all over Chinatown, so as here, better to say fried chicken. Chilli chicken balls were good to taste. Golden fried fish was excellent. Chicken fried rice was good. Mixed mefoon was average, better say bad. Sanghai fish and Chicken in oyster sauce were average. There was no flavor, neither any distinct taste. Not satisfied with the service either. Food and drinks bill for 11 person were 6030.

Had Kowloon chicken for starters. Well fried but not too deeply and with green chillies started with good note. Then for main course we had Hakka mixed chow mein and fish. On looking at the fish dish, I had a misgiving but was soon cleared the moment I tasted it. It was simply divine. Food enough in quantity and superb in quality. Left happy promising to return soon.

Golden Joy has awesome food.  Ambience and location are good, and service staff can be a tad bit relaxed sometimes, but I did not find them bad.  Please say She She (Thanks), if you are served by one of the few remaining ethnic Yunnanese left in Kolkata.  We will have much to lose, if the last of them leave.

Coming back to the food, on my last trip, I started with a crab coriander soup. Clear, flavorful, with a few pieces of crab meat, the light soup was a perfect start to meal, with heartier fare to follow.  For mains, I had an order of mixed fried rice, made just the way I like it (crisp and clean, with plenty of pork). The chili garlic fried chicken, dry, was perfect foil.  

It was a wonderful and memorable meal; the taste and aroma will linger for a long time to come.  Thanks.

Golden joy is located superbly just at the entrance of china town with some delicious chinese lipsmacking dishes.There are definite negative marks in 2 issues.
1.The section lacks proper atmosphere..Its more a bar atmosphere than a family dine in.Full crowd makes the area very noisy.
2.The staffs are not proper here.They are rude and lacks hospitality.I really felt its bad.
The positive marks are food and location.Mapo chicken,lut me fish,kungpao chicken we ordered which tastes very nice.
Last point it can improve a lot as service wise.

Twelve cousins - meeting outside the puja setup - prawns & beer - we drove the staff and crowd alike - crazy!!Managed Atleast 8-9 hard looks! 
The starters - prawns hot pepper, thread chicken , fish chilly, Chilli mushrooms -- Perfect and guzzled on in 10 mins flat.
Mains - we were too hungry to wait for the main mains- 6 Foo-Yaa  or some "omelette"  _ no kidding , Good! 
Mains - rice noodles , chopsuey and Cantonese , fish chilly gravy & a chicken.
That's where the "confusion" played in.Maybe such a large order - veg became NonVeg ( I specifically said No chicken and he nods to "mixed" and gives exactly Chicken.) 
The fish - Bhakti maybe it was and maybe it is supposed to "smell" that - but all I know - Fish Should Not smell Fishy! Apparently the chef disagreed and so did most of my cousins - I disagreed.
The Cantonese and chopsuey - EXACT gravies - and honestly it got too heavy till the end.
The staff - needs to buck up their agility.Bigger crowd means bigger responsibility.

Tangra is the China Town of Kolkata. It is renowned for its chinese cuisine. The Thai soup that you get in tangra is not something that you get anywhere in the rest of the country. If you visit calcutta, this is a must have. Golden Joy is one of the numerous restaurants in Tangra. I have been to almost all the restaurants here and this is my favorite overall. The food is excellent. Specially dry chilli chicken and cilli prawn balls. While the pan fried noodles was decent, the chicken rice noodles were smelly and quite bad. Barring the rice noodles, it was an excellent experience. Service & staff attitude was actually another dampner

I recently visited Golden Joy for dinner. This is a tried and tested place for Chinese Food lovers located in Tangra, Chinatown and one of my favourite restaurants in the city. The interiors are simple with steel furniture which in my opinion, could be improved, comfort wise. However, the food, as always, was fantastic. Their Golden Fried Prawns, Hong Kong Chicken Drumsticks and Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken are delicious. For main course we ordered Chicken Cantonese Chowmein and Pork Hakka Chowmein which were equally good. Their Cantonese Chowmein in particular is exceptional. However, one or two of the stewards are always grumpy and not very helpful with order suggestions.

If cheap booze is what you want , cheap booze is what you will get!
Some average tasting chinese food!Good ambiance and properly lit . Can fit in your entire neighborhood(yes, it's THAT spacious). But all that is secondary ,Right!
Cummon guys ! we all come to Tangra for cheap booze! And Golden Joy fits that purpose totally!!!

It's a huge restaurant and they have sufficient place for their customers to serve immediately. There are two floors. The ground floor is for gents only and the upper floor is for ladies and family. The food is quite good and the ambiance is average. The waiters too are cooperative. Fits in for a casual hang out with friends to have few bottles of beer and chit chat.

My first visit to china town! Had no clue about Tangra (not a chinese cuisine fan!) but it was a treat so had to go. Shrimp cake was delectable. Was curious but too lazy to try the crab claws which were surprisingly available that day. Prawn chips were delecious and those prawns! confession: I had nothing but starters that day :D

As far as Tangra is considered the place is kind a so so place...
The quality of food is also average and yes price is the yard stick of both quality and quantity...
Now the thing which I liked was the attitude of the waiters...
We went there on dasami and yes no liquor was served on that day the waiters gave us a name of a restaurant where liquor was served on that day it was our bad luck that we couldn't get a sit...
But yeah they were good enough to look at our interests over their revenue...

This is a great chinese eatery. Conveniently located and with a valet parking facility you start liking this place even before the food arrives. The vast floor space ensures that seating is hassle free. The tables and chairs could use some updated upholstery though. The menu offers good variety and the food is reasonable considering the rather large portion sizes. The staff is courteous and helpful suggesting us some good options to try from. Oh did I mention that the food is AMAZING!!!!!

After bigboss visited this restaurant in china town, tangra. And I was not disappointed because they really served good foods. We ordered prawn chips, some kind of special soup (I forget the actual name), chicken wantons, mixed hakka chow, mixed fried rice, hunan chicken and singapore fish. Each and every dish was very good. One cannot compare between these items, so I am giving overall marks. And not to forget the ambience was also very good.

It was my first visit to this restaurant n after having lunch here I wonder how could I miss it. We went here being suggested by a common friend. The ambience was really beautiful.
We ordered latmai fish, hunan chicken golden fried prawn as starters and mixed hakka noodles, red pepper garlic chicken as main course.

Lat mai fish was lip smacking. I liked it the most n I would recommend everyone coming here to try it.

Hunan chicken was also yum yum.. perfect in taste.. melts in mouth.

Golden fried prawn was crispy from outside n soft n juicy from inside.

Mixed hakka noodles was also good. . Nothing wrong in its taste or quantity or anything.

Finally comes the red pepper garlic chicken. This is the only item which I didn't like much. It was sort of bland in taste.
I have given 4.5 only because of the last dish otherwise 5 upon 5 surely.

My 5th visit and 1st review! The best thing about it is its location and variety! Golden fried prawns are godie for.. They should.open up.more space especially during the Durga Puja times.. Great food despite the crowded ambience.. The staff and ushers are especially helpful and nixe, though quite firm if there is ACTUALLY no space..  All.in all, one of the best places in Chinatown to splurge!

Food was too oily ..golden fried fish .fried rice ,hakka noodles everything has an extra layer of oil ,which was never the case .Service was not good ..order dry chilli chicken instead got chicken with garlic sauce ...Somehow lunchtime crowd was not that big too ....

This was not the first time I went to Golden Joy. The third time for me. Good ambience to hang out with friends with non stop giggles and laughter. Pricewise it was economical. The food quality was good. I specially liked the golden fried prawns. Soft jumbo prawns coated in a crispy batter served with schezwan sauce. The rice and noodles dishes are served in good quantity to fill your stomach.

This used to be my favorite place to eat chinese when I was in calcutta. But on my recent visit to the city for durga puja, I visited Golden Joy and the place disappointed me with the food. Although it was a puja day it was not crowded but the food was bad. Me and my friends ordered chicken wanton, Thai soup, chicken friend rice and hunan chicken. Apart from the soup the rest were horrible. The preparations were full of oil and we were almost left pukish after eating it. We almost left the food. Didn't think my experience here would be so bad.

After reading great reviews on Zomato we planned to visit this Restaurent during Puja and planned some dishes before going there but after going we saw there are limited dishes available for Puja only and no Booze also. Also the prices are Rs 20 higher for every dishes. We ordered Mixed Chow Gravy, Chili Chicken Dry, Lut Me Chicken, Fish Manchurian Dry and 2 bottles of Cold Drinks (All half plates) . Bill was 1460 all included.

Food was good but we thought it will be better that Kim Ling but that disappointed us. Lut me chicken is simply like chicken fry. Fish and other food is good but serving time is very slow and waiters are lazy and less careful..

This review is not only about this restaurant but about zomato as well. Zomato ratings over the past few years have almost become an yardstick of the quality of an eatery. Anything 4.0 or above means that the place would serve good food, offer wonderful service and provide an ambiance to cherish. Golden Joy was none of the above.It was a shocker and I lost my face by recommending this place to my family purely based on the ratings. The food was average, service was bad and about the ambiance : the lesser said is better. The crowd was loud and and cooked up such a racket that it was difficult to have any conversation. A roadside dhaba presents a more serene environment to dine.My advice : do not venture here with your family or friends, unless you and your friends are the likes who should be called rowdies.  My rating of this place : 3.0 (would have rated 2.5, but the average food did some saving).

I'm not a frequent visitor of the Chinatown area so this place was a little difficult to find. But we finally got the place after a lil asking round. The food is decent and the ambience is also decent. 
You should try out Dragon Chicken and Mapa Chicken for starters. We had noodles and Kung Pao Chicken for the main course. 
We had also ordered drinks along with the food. The best part about this restaurant is that you can buy a bottle of the drink of your choice. This makes sure that the cost of drinks goes real cheap on your pockets. 
Overall experience: Good.

A highly rated and busy Restaurant in Tangra - its the latest favourite for Kolkatans. Went in on a weekday for dinner since i was on a business trip.
Ordered for drinks folioed by starters - Pepper Prawns, Crispy Chicken and Spring fish in Ginger - all the starters were served hot and were very good in taste. We also split a Thai soup - was surprised to have a thai soup in authentic Chinese restaurant.
For mains,we ordered the traditional hakka noodles and mixed fried rice and chillic ckicken-the rice was very good in taste and had more qty of rice than noodles,though am primarily a noodle eater.

Over all a good experience - food tasted good and since i was with family - evening turned out the awesome.

We visited this restaurant as a group of 14 friends to have lunch. The restaurant is located just at the very entrance of China Town which was easy to find. There is a parking lot just beside the restaurant and even a valet. The ambience was quite good inside with nice lights. For starters we ordered chicken sweet corn soup, chicken wanton soup, thread chicken and chilli pepper chicken. The chicken sweet corn soup was delicious. But the wanton soup tasted a bit bland just like boiled water. Thread chicken was unique which I have not had anywhere else. Chilli pepper chicken was good too. They provide 14 pieces of chicken in one large plate which is nice.
In the main course we ordered chicken noodles, chicken sichuan rice, mixed fried rice and chicken meifoon. The quantity was really good. A plate can easily be shared by 2.All were pretty good but the sichuan rice was really spicy. It literally brought water to our eyes. So if you do not prefer spicy food don't order that. As side dishes we ordered mushroom baby corn and golden joy spcl chicken. The golden joy spcl chicken was just delicious, a must have. We ordered ice cream and brownie with ice cream for desserts. The brownie was really good. But the thing I disliked was they did not provide seperate spoons for the desserts. The gave the same plastic green spoons which the ice cream vendors provide for free. We had vodka and breezers for drink. One thing that really bugged me were the waiters. They took a lot of time to take order. We had to call them several times before they came to our table.
The final bill was only about 6000 including drinks which was quite pocket friendly.

The go to for a china town visit.
+1 for vallet parking.
+1 for providing bottles of booze for around 1.75x the printed price (its really cheap for an account dining facility).
huge seating capacity.prompt service.plenty of starters and sides to choose from.
However not the best of taste is to be found.
We ordered a pork dish,two prawn dish,and two chicken dish. Chicken & prawns were okayish but the pork was surely overcooked and lacked the usual taste.
The prawn chips are a ripoff. It's basically papads fried in litres of oil!

And from what I've heard the stag section seating arrangement is very poor.its better to tag a lady along so that you can be seated in the family section.

Went there with my friend for a quick booze over discussion. The first thing i disked was that the waiters were unwilling to serve us with water unless and until we order our first course. Though after repeated asking also, they paid no heed to our request and only served prompt to our order. I was amazed of what kind of hospitality it was, not to serve water to your customer. 
We were a little hungry so ordered for a wanton soup and a golden joy special soup. Service was prompt thereafter. And we ordered dragon chicken. It was really a good side for a malt. We enjoyed and were quite full with the quantity for 2 people.

It is actually a joyful place. One of the oldest and most famous Chinese joints in Kolkata's own Chinese neighbourhood,China Town. A little difficult to reach without a car/cab. Have to walk a little,otherwise.The roads leading to it are narrow and full of potholes round the year. Have been going there since my college days. Can't have enough of their Golden Fried Prawns,Thread Chicken and Prawn Chips- just these and the amazingly cheap booze,makes for a fun time with friends or colleagues. A good place to go with your family,too. Don't miss their pudding at just 60 bucks!!

If you love Chinese you should at least once head out to Golden joy, surely the best restaurant in China town, Kolkata and goes easy on the pocket too. Right up there with Mainland China I'd say.

I was a bit confused as to where I can take a bunch of my team mates for lunch..wat I wanted was the ambience should be great..it should be in a pretty good locality and they should serve alcohol..there were lots of options and finally my boss suggested this place..once we reached I had this feeling it's the right decision to come to this place..we ordered lots of starters.. golden fried prawns..drum sticks..fish fingers..crispy mushrooms..paneer pakora..prawn chips..AND a litre of 100 pipers;). All the starters were absolutely great except for paneer pakora..though it was good but not up to the standard set by other items we had ordered. For veg people they should definitely order crispy mushroom..it's awesome!! For non veg lovers fish fingers aka golden fried fish..golden fried prawns..drumsticks is a must..they taste heavenly..beyond the expectations of my taste buds..lol..had few cocktails too..though they were good but not up to what a pub has to offer..the staff were courteous..well behaved and spoke fluent English and I know for some this part of review can ignored..we were soo stuffed by the time we finished with our drinks that we went straight to the desserts..had hot brownie with ice cream..it was good but not excellent.. Had a great time there with lots of drinks and lots and lots of starters..mind it the starters were not jus one of each;)..The ambience of the place is good with ample parking space and now m already looking forward to my nxt visit..

I went to this place about a month ago with my colleagues. Had a blast, ambience was good, we only had starters, and it was of good quantity, and service was good too.

Really good food
The staffs are very courteous
The portions are good enough
And the only restaurant that is left in Chinatown with the great taste
Rest are not at all worth visiting
As per Golden joy
We ordered
Mapo chicken - great
Singapore fish - ok

For main
Rice noodles chicken - the quantity is enough for 2 and clean and good quality
Another chicken noodle - ok
Hunan chicken - good in black sauce
Sweet garlic chicken - red gravy loved it

For those who could go a little extra for the spicy food
Must try tangy chicken
We once took it you can literally feel your tongue on fire

This was my first time in tangra so picked up Golden Joy as it was the one of the most voted one on zomato. Finding the restaurant was a bit bummer for me.
First thing I noticed about the restaurant that it was very glorious from the outside (that's the first impression very important it tells you many things about a restaurant)...as we entered the restaurant.....very nice ambience... Second impression spot on ....(one thing was very peculiar about tangra that I think there were more people in the restaurant than in the whole area).....now as we headed there for a birthday treat....we celebrated the birthday....and then we ordered....not too fancy about the dishes they are serving not many frightening names......very basic... So we ordered chicken Sichuan chow,chicken Cantonese chow, kung pao chicken and golden joy special chicken(based on white gravy)....the dishes were very good and the proportion was very generous but not awesome so 4/5 ....we were satisfied.... I was also checked the prices of the drinks they are not costly......but our frustrations were with the waiters....they were not serving properly....their attitude with the customers were not as expected.....there were few hiccups in their services.... Like we ordered plain water....they...brought mineral water....all and all it was horrible...so 2.5/5 for them.
A very adventurous day from finding the restaurant to everything. Very good Chinese restaurant....very pocket friendly restaurant.
So if you are looking for a Chinese restaurant which fits well with your budget and you are adventurous enough to find the restaurant..... You can never go with this one.

PLEASE CHECK YOUR PARCEL : I went to this place to celebrate my brothers birthday with his friends on 21 august 2015. Firstly the parking was an horrible experience due to inadequate space. After we managed to enter the place, the toilets were in horrible state due to vomits and piss stench. Very much average food quality to say the least. Though the worst experience came at last. Me and one of my friend choice to parcel food for our respective mothers. He ordered chicken chow hakka and I ordered chicken chow gravy. As I came home with the food for my famished mom, we found it to be nothing but just soup and nothing else. My friends parcel was also the same. Our mothers slept without any food as she was too angry and I was too embarrassed to say anything. This is my true experince and I suggest you to avoid it any cost. One of my worst experince ever. :(

Cheap booze and food and a chilled out place. Getting to this restaurant may be a challenge, but once there it ia all worth it. The thread chicken is very good, and goes well with an ol' rum and coke. Pocket pinch is not too much. Highly Recommended. (P.S.: Better than the neighbouring Beijing)

Located at Tangra. One of my favourite Chinese Cuisines in town. The ambience is good as well the service. Staffs coordinate well and are polite too. We were four in total and they served the food within minutes which is an advantage inspite of the day being a Sunday. This placed remains crowded all the time. Starting from the awesome starters to the maincourse items on their menu card, every item is worth it and tasty af. Price is okayish. Recommended absolutely.

Visited this place recently with my family... Those who know Chinatown tangra.. They know that it's a difficult place to reach.. But they have their own parking.. 
Price is quite reasonable.. Ordered a blue lagoon cocktail which was ok..
The food was amazing .. I really loved their Thai soup.. We had chicken lollipops .. Dry chilli chicken...Quite spicy.. Egg fried rice was good.. 
Ambience was nice.. And service was good..

We go there quite often- at least once in a month- mainly because of the ambience. The dimly lit restaurant has ample space and lot of energetic and noisy crowd around. The waiters are very well behaved and the best thing is you get everything there is on the menu and a few stuff not there on the menu as well. I have never been refused of a dish as on date. The price is very reasonable and overall value for money.

Golden fried prawns are awesome. Crispy on the outside amd soft and creamy inside. Comes at Rs 50 a pc approx. Also like their seafood soup and golden joy special soup. The waiters always insist on the red pepper chicken but we don't like it much. Momos are better than most places but not always available. Pretty good food overall and good value for money.

I completely agree with what Sinchan Roy had said in his review.I am still looking for the ZERO STAR option.Table service was slow.Food quality was low. Dont order any fish item for your palate unless you really want to forget what fish tastes like.Dont know why they suggest Bombai chicken to everyone...first they shud learn to cook a simple kolkata chicken.bombay bohot duur hai...all in all they presented us with the worst china town experience ever...I would rather suggest hot wok village...their ambience might not be as good but food(especially fish items) is much better..Golden joy sucks.big time!

Absolutely Worthless Restaurant
We reached this place after reading the good words on zomato. The vallet was nowhere to be seen and we had to park ourselves,though that isn't much of a bother. We entered the restaurant and tried to order our meal for 20 mins but somehow every waiter was clueless about where to go. To be noted here that only 3 tables were full. Our food and drinks were served in the most weird order. Hence we had to wait till all 5 of us were served with drinks, and that took 20/25 more minutes. By that time the chewy fish starter got chewier. Once we ordered our alcohol, we had to change our choice every 10 mins coz the waiter would come back and say it was not available. Anyways, we finally got our drink to the table aftr 30 mins of recurring disappointment. The main course noodles were extremely oily and smelled of uncooked oil. The waiters were unprofessional and knew nothing about the menu.
If u have enough cash to consider this place, start considering some other option coz this is a nightmare if u are thinking about "value for money".
Extremely bad food quality . Extremely lousy service. Thoroughly disappointed.

Visited 1 week back when I was in Kolkata.

Decent ambience. However, it was very crowded and very noisy. Service was poor. It seemed that they were doing some favor by taking out orders.😠

We ordered:
Prawn fried wantons : Oily and below average.
LUT me chicken : Medium spicy, good, tasty, dry chicken starter.
Mix Cantonese Chow : You would really love it if you are a fan of gravy noodles.
Mix fried rice: Good but nothing special.
Lemon Chilli Chicken : The name says it all. Medium spicy.
Red Wine was ordinary.

I would request the management to look at the lacking areas. Standards are dropping.

Hey golden fried prawns anyone, of course yes. Who'll say no. Unless u got some issues. But thankfully i don't,and dont mind unleashin the glutton within when i'm here . Well tangra can only disappoint u if it's pujo, and the the Chinese-loving bongali babu's infest dis place,only after their favorite biriyani place. Otherwise its mostly great.  The favourites are :- the Thai soup, chili pepper garlic chicken, honey chicken, roast chicken, threaded chicken, kung pao. Very tasty all of these,tried them multiple times, and moreorless it has a consistent quality every single time. Cheap booze is also a plus, but u might not wanna ruin that appetite with alcohol . Ps: they have this great green chili sauce, which accompanies almost anything really ( diners discretion required ,subject is very hot,and u should consume it at your own risk)  .  Cantonese noodles, mixed  fried rice(regular or schezwan ), basically the main course is also pretty good,but it all gets packed coz the huge quantity of starters will usually get u too full. So just make sure u have a giant hunger of some sorts wen u plan making a trip here, coz the triumph will be urs at bill time 😉.

Undoubtedly, on of the best restaurants in China Town. Great to have parties. Golden Joy serves one of the best foods in Tangra. And my favorites are Mixed Thai Soup, Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, Garlic Prawn, Prawn Chips, Lutme Chicken, Hoisin Chicken, Mixed Meifun, Schezuan Chicken/Fish and Darshan to end. You can also get liquors by bottles. The staffs are also very courteous. There are separate sitting arrangements for stags and families. The ambiance is also very nice. There is a separate smoking zone in the first floor. I would love to recommend Golden Joy to all.

I visited the place on 12th July.....didn't like the decor and there was very less space between the tables....one cannot go round the table without touching the other table...

we ordered our starters only to know after 15 mins that one of the dishes will not be available....How can the waiter not now what is being served?

the starters came in quite late and by the time the kids were hungry......this is probably the first restaurant in Kolkata that doesn't serve anything with drinks...surprising??

Food was nothing great stand alone even if not compared to other restaurants...overall a bad experience and will prefer Big Boss anytime....

When it comes to tangra or as popularly known as china town golden joy is one of my favorites.
The ambience is nice and so are the restaurant staff. They are really cooperative. The best part is that you can stay for as long as you want and hence a perfect "adda spot" for friends to hang out.
Ordered a variety of dishes ( chicken, pork and sea food). Their Golden fried prawns are awesome. In short, with good service, and pretty descent  food this place is one of my favorites in China Town.

Closely related to this area I regularly visit China town... Been here twice... The restaurant is quite spacious but they changed our place thrice since it was a busy day... The starters are slightly overpriced .. For the main course we ordered meinfoon rice and chicken..bombay chicken is one of my favourites.,since I love spicy food...the green chilli chutney served by them.is to die for..

With big names like big boss and beijing, this place has always been hiiden from the spotlight. But trust me this place has the potential to  take over the biggies. Starting with the sweet corn chicken soup, to lemon chicken to garlic chicken to chilli prawn,this place has everythng to top in the chinese cuisine list. Also the reasonable rates acts as the icing on the cake.

This place is located in tangra, China town. I had heard a lot about it from my friends. It is huge, it has a huge capacity. But I felt that the waiters were not week behaved. They were confused whether the dishes they are serving are veg out not. They getting bottles of drinks and not getting openers or glasses. Then the service was very slow, they were serving really late. They food was okay, already the vegetarian it was not as good as I had heard.

Fine diners may opt out but real food lovers must visit Golden Joy! I've been going there to satiate my Chinese cuisine cravings for years now. Nothing beats the food it offers, no matter how posh and fabulous other restaurants are. The menu is huge and the food is lip smacking. Alcohol is cheap and service is good. What else does one need? One must try the Golden Fried Prawn and the Red Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken. Those with a basket of prawn chips and a bottle of Corona. Aah bliss!

A pretty large seating area, with decent lighting is pretty much what the ambiance of the place is made up of. Nothing really striking. The service is prompt and there were no issues there. Coming to the food, it was about average. For the starters we had thread chicken, spicy tangy chicken and mushroom and baby corn fry. The thread chicken was pretty good. It's a dish that I am a big fan of and was cooked nicely. The noodles were very crisp and the meat inside was pretty tender. We were told that the tangy chicken would be 'very' tangy but the final dish was neither spicy nor tangy. We also had the lung fung soup which didn't have anything special about it. For the main course we ordered 2 veg noodles, one regular and one schezwan, kung pao chicken and french fries. The chicken was over done in the main course and had become pretty hard and leathery. The noodles were just like you would expect noodles to be, again nothing special. The fries were quite good compared to the rest of the spread. They were very crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall, a decent place but nothing makes it a must visit.

Jst luvd their dry chilli garlic chicken on being insisted by d waiter n also their speciality which is golden fried prawn. Unfortunately the main course failed to impress,hav had better mixd rice elsewhere. Apart from their Sweet n Sour Chicken which I wish I had nt ordered, it was nt gud at all. So I feel one should concentrate on starters.

Went to this place last sunday....Ambience is good, very spacious, no chance of getting overloaded with crowd for sure, however coming to food, as compared with other renowned restaurants in Tangra like Big Boss and Beijing, I found Golden Joy to be just better than average....we ordered Golden Fried Prawn, which was really nice, hot and sour chicken soup was also tasty and the quantity was sufficeient to feed 5 of us, however we ordered Lemon Chilli Chicken , which was not up to the mark, as it seemed to be a dish with no speciality of taste, however Hot Garlic chicken was good, followed by the Mix Fired Rice and Mix Sichuan Rice was even better than that, Overall good place to dine and good service. The 3.5/5 rating is because of the Lemon Chilli Chicken, not recomended at all.

One of the famous CHINA TOWN restaurant offering authentic chinese restaurants . This one being my favourite from childhood , hereby comes by review -
Ambience : china town in kolkata is one of that place where all the autuentic indian chinese restaurants are located and thus it gives a feeling of our neighbouring country. Beautifully arranged areas with dim lights gives a feeling of fine dining.
Food : starting from prawn chips , crispy babycorn and mushroom to   chicken lollypop and dragon chicken , all are awesome dishes to start with. Soups are an important part of chinese cuisine. they offer all types of veg/non.veg soups , i would recommend to choose any soup in 1:1 portion as their quantity is good otherwise you'll miss out on main courses. For main course i prefer to order their noodle dishes specially cantonnese. Once i tried schezwan fried rice which i didn't like much . Nonethless their mixed rice is awesome with mushroom, shrimps, chicken and pork. For side dish i would suggest one to have chicken and prawn dishes as what is chinese without mushroom , chicken and prawn ? 
Price : thier array of mouth-watering dishes are worth every penny.
Drinks : liked their collection. Usually i have breezer or smirnoff vodka with lime cordial.

Enjoy your meal, Eat till satisfied  :)

Great place to visit in China Town if you are looking to meet friends or have a get together of any sort. Very spacious with a pleasant ambiance. Booking is a must on evenings or weekends. 
Service is in general quite good. Food is nice, works well for your pocket too. Alcohol available, so that's a plus! Really wish they gave some complimentary peanuts or something though. We ordered a crispy chili baby corn for starter, which really disappointed us- was kind of oily and soggy. That apart, the fried won tons, the tangy chicken, the chili chicken balls were all excellent. 
Main course portions are quite generous- 1 plate serves 2 easy. Service was fast and food was excellent apart from that one glitch I mentioned earlier. 
One of the better restaurants of the area, looking forward to visiting this place again. Cheers!

Visiting the famed streets of Chinatown or Tangra is a must if you are in Kolkata, to try some really authentic Chinese cuisine. And Golden Joy is perhaps one of the best in the area. This is evident from the fact that the place generally remains packed during lunch and dinner even on weekdays so make sure you come a bit early if you don't want to end up waiting. 

Ambience: The place is nicely lit up with a lot of tables so there is always hustle & bustle as people chat away over some awesome food. 

Service: Here is where they lack a bit as the waiter-customer ratio is small and you might have to remind the waiter of your order once or twice. But order to serve time is descent and there is not much waiting. 

Food: Ahh it is so good, so light on your pocket and they give you 3 choices of portion for soup: small, regular and large & between full and half on almost all other items on the menu. So you can taste a bit of everything. It's perfect. 

Almost everything they have on their menu is worth trying but here are some must-trys: 

1. Shrimp Cakes: A piece of heaven for seafood lovers. A crispy coating on the outside and a brillaint filling of shrimps inside and nothing else. A half plate will give you 7 pieces. 

2. Chilli garlic red pepper Fish: As long as the name is, even more tastier and sumptuous is the fish preparation. Crispy layered chunks of fish sauted in a lovely, red, spicy sauce with bell-peppers; absolutely mouth watering.  

3. Dragon Chicken: Hot dish alert! As the name suggests, a fiery preparation of chicken but absolutely delicious. 

4. Mixed Hakka Chow: For those confused by the unending list of preparations of chow in the menu, this is a simple yet very delicious preparation. Sometimes simple is the best. Recommended. 

This place is definitely a heaven for seafood lovers as well as who adore Chinese cuisine. If nothing else, Go there simply for the love of good food.

One of the better restaurants of China Town. Great food, good ambiance, good service. I have visited here many times with family and friends. Its remains moderately crowded in weekends. Some great dishes are served here like the Singapore chicken and a Fish fry kind of a thing. Price is on the lower side and its quite pocket friendly. If other restaurants like the Bigg Boss and Beijing are full, drop here for a brunch.

First and foremost, the service does tend to be a bit slow. I begin with this because the food is amazing and the slow service may as well be the only complaint. We had Thai soup and Siu Mai with chicken and prawns (must-try) and were blown away - simple, authentic, and refreshingly light! Want to try their noodles next. The restaurant might not be too showy and grand but the quality of food is exquisite. Undoubtedly one of Tangra's best.

Was here on Saturday with my family and a recently married couple. The approach to this hotel is slightly narrow and messed up. Especially with monsoon in the picture the road is filled up with water and mud at some places and also not sufficient illumination is there. People entering chinatown for the first time might feel a little awkward or scary for the first time having the road less illuminated and completely isolated at certain stretches. It is around 7-8mins drive from the main entrance of chinatown. However, as soon as the hotel starts getting visible from the road, you get to see the crowd, cars and the support staff from the hotel who will guide you for the parking. Infact they have the facility of assisted parking hence you need not to worry about the parking at all (given the fact that I visited the place on a Saturday and still didnt face any hassles for parking my car). As soon as you enter the hotel, you will see a restrobar at the ground floor which is mainly for people coming without family. On the first floor, you have the restrobar for families. At the entrance of the first floor, there is this guy who will take the headcount of your group and will give you a token, in case, you are required to wait. They have a very nice terrace to wait for your turn. The terrace is quite a big one and is provided with lot of chairs and wall mounted fans. Infact we had a nice time at the terrace chatting and taking pics, selfies, etc. After waiting about 15 mins finally we got a place to dine in the restaurant. We started with some drinks and starters. The starters came in no time. The behavior of the staff was fair and the average time to bring in any food we ordered was between 5-7 mins. Isnt that fast considering the fact that that you are there on a weekend day with all the tables packed and the hotel working on full capacity? 10:30 pm is the time for last order. Well, overall we indeed had a great time over there and I recommend for family visits there. In my rating, I have deducted 0.5 only because of the narrow and messy approach to the hotel. Would have loved to give 5.

First visit to the restaurant with some of my office colleagues for party. This joint is located in Tangra and you will have to take the first right turn and then straight. We were seated on the first floor. Ambiance is not so nice. 

It was a tough call for me as I had to order for 22 people. We ordered fried spring chicken, schizwan pepper prawn as the starters.  On the soups menu we ordered Thai soup and sweet corn soup. The starters and Thai soup were good and did not disappoint. On the main course it was time for mixed chow and mixed fried rice along with schezwann chicken, these were so so kind a stuff and nothing special. 

Overall nice if you are going with a group of friends for some drinks and yes the best part is, they have a smoking zone inside the restaurant.

All what I heard about Chinese cuisine came to a perfect destination. I wouldn't say this is the best but one of the best as in my other reviews I have also mentioned some other Chinese cuisine where I have visited and are also good. The choice of Chinese food is endless here and all of them are worth trying indeed I tried some and chose in advance that I would try next time. The ambience, food and hospitality is equally good. For two costs around 800-900 and I must say its a must visit.

This was our joint during our early career days. The restuarant as grown over the years but the quality has depleted. Pricing has also increased. But it stuill remains a better option than many others in Tangra. Ambience is good and getting better everyday. They should again shift back their focus on the quality now. Overall among the better places in Tangra.

Great ambiance and even better food makes this place a personal favorite amongst the plethora of restaurants in China town. Golden fried prawns n prawn chips are amazing, so are the thread chicken n golden joy special fish fry.. For dessert, try darsaan. Though the service is a let down, the quality of the food n a well stocked bar more than makes up for it. 
 Make sure you reserve a table before hand or be prepared to wait outside as, despite the huge seating area, it is always always crowded.

This is for all you guys who obsess over prawns. Visited the place for dinner. Tried golden fried prawns, prawns in garlic butter, schzewan prawns and Mongolian prawns. All of them tasted beautiful. Would go there again every single time I visit Kolkata. Good value for money and the service is extremely prompt and responsible. Great job guys! Keep serving great prawns.

It was a good experience having lunch in this restaurant. We took golden prawns which was good, the prawns were soft inside the batter fried coating. We also took garlic pepper chicken, lemon chicken and Hakka noodles. Noodles and lemon chicken was perfectly done and tested great. Pepper chicken was so so. Situated at Chinatown, tangra they serve drinks at lower prices which is the plus point of the restaurants of Chinatown.

We have been a regular customer of golden joy in tangra for the past 10 years. But recently  we had been there and the service has been beyond poor. Just to get the starters and soup, the staff took about 45 minutes. I think their reputation has gone up to their head. 
This would be the last time I will be visiting this restaurant. Even the quality of the food has degraded.

This was my favorite place in tangra... But going there last month... It seems to have dropped it's standards... The staff weren't courteous enough... We made prior reservations since there were 24 of us...the prawn fried wantons had an unwanted fishy smell to it.... They made us wait for a long time before they served food
And we went at a time when the restaurant was half empty so no excuses for being late.

Visited the place for the first time recently for dinner and it was quite crowded for a weekday night.
Being my first visit, stuck to standard items from the menu while selecting. Ordered  thread chicken, chilli garlic chicken and chicken sweet and sour soup for starters. On the advice of the waiter ordered half plate of the chicken items and medium portion of soup and it was sufficient for four of us. All the starter items were excellent and deserve a 5 star.
For mains we ordered Egg fried rice, cantonese chow, chilli fish dry and sweet and sour chicken. Again quantity and taste of the items were good.
Meal was rounded off with puddings which were OK.
Service was prompt and waiters were polite and helpful.
Would surely visit again to try out more items.

I have been to Golden Joy before but this the first time I am writing a review about the place. The first impression is something that you get from almost all restaurants in Tangra barring Beijing which seems a little better than most.  The place is spread across 2 floors and the owners have tried to fit in as many covers as possible. A look at the menu will tell you that the place is very reasonably priced specially the Bar menu. Which is why you find it packed every day.  The food is good and the service is prompt. Try the starters, specially the golden fried prawns. Overall it is one of the better places to visit if you are craving Chinese.

If prawn and beer is what your taste-buds are striving for, this is the place to be. Though the service is really poor and the place is crowded like crazy in spite of being really huge (by huge, I mean HUGGGEEE!!), they have succeeded in maintaining a beautiful ambience. As far as I have heard, this is one of the best restaurant in Chinatown. So, a must go for chinese-lovers!

PS: Do try Golden Fried Prawn and Prawn Paapad!

One of my favorite joint in our own China Town... This place has proved to be the best place in terms of  quality, quantity and ambiance. Apart form hanging out with the close people, I have been host of 2 get-together at this place that had 20 plus people every time, and I must say we enjoyed the food & ambiance like anything. Another plus point of this place is its huge quantity of foods, you will never feel LESS.. Their most favorite & popular item being Golden Fried Prawns, along with Roasted Duck.. A must try. . One more thing to add on, they have half and full plate for every dishes, so you can order according to how many of you are eating & trust me the full plate (starters) easily serves 5 people if not more..

I haven't got a chance to explore much of the famous "China Town". Reason being, the very first restaurant I visited was this, and I never tried anything else after that. Located very close to the Tangra main road with a huge parking place available. Family section is in the first floor and for boozers, they have arranged your seat at the ground floor itself. It's a strictly "No smoking" place however a separate room / balcony kind of place is there for smokers(Very suffocating though). I would rather prefer to provide some bullet points rather than detailed sentences so the main highlights would go like this -

1. Well decorated interior with large space for seating
2. Most of the waiters are very well-mannered
3. You can avail the facility of an "ON SHOP" i.e instead of Alcohol pegs, you can take a bottle(like other china town restaurants)You can go for pegs as well. They serve tequila bottles also - price is a bit high (1 Pint of Blender's pride costs 800 + tax)
4. Truly authentic Chinese food - no question asked
5. For me, the best food has been Golden fried prawn, Chili pork, Salt and pepper chicken, chilli shrimp. Haven't tried much of the main course, as after "Hatari", I believe they are the 2nd most bowl fillers so hadn't much left in my stomach.
6. while ordering Pork, make sure you don't use the word "PORK" instead use "CHUNUK" - that's the process they follow as many guests might get biased thinking "Oh you serve pork too? then u must have mixed it in my chicken fried rice..."

Its one of those place which I keep visiting. Extremely crowded and noisy: resembles a market place ; waiting time is substantial on weekends but still this place does its job the best - makes superb chinese! Situated right in China town the starter spread is awesome. Fish Korean Steak, to Crispy Chicken, to Drums of Heaven,  to Golden Fried Jumbo Prawn everything is cooked to perfection. One should try out the Fried Jumbo Prawn. Main course is nothing over the top, but one should indulge as much as possible in starters.

It is probably one of the best Chinese restaurants in the city. Never been disappointed with any dish they served till date.
The decor is not upto the mark and the place becomes quite noisy especially during weekends. The service is slightly on the average side during weekends but the staff is pretty helpful.
Coming to the dishes the haka noodles, mein fu, fried rice  are pretty amazing . The garlic fried prawns are a must. But the chefs special barbeque chicken steals the show. The lip smacking barbeque chicken will make you lick your plate, its a must try.
Now the prices will surely NOT burn a hole in your pocket and at the same time you will surely be satisfied.

But noodles and soup was delicious. They were well behaved and had served timely. Price was reasonable as the quantity was good.

But I didn't find any wow factor in them.

We had prawn waffles, golden fried prawns, Thai mixed soup, chicken fried rice , pepper prawn and chicken with exotic veg. Needless to say we ordered too much we were 3 of us and very were over stuffed as their quantity r huge ! 
Food was really good and service was super fast and efficient.

Does this place need a review??? What you need to know is order for their specials on your next visit.
Dragon Eye, Steam Fish Fillet with chilli garlic sauce, Steam Prawn & Mapo Pork. Place your orders for the specials in the morning if your planning a 'Joyous' dinner trip. 
The service is prompt & courteous. They don't encourage reservations on weekends beyond 0730 pm.

Guys... Of all the cuisines Chinese is on my list for the least favourites. So if i say anything positive about this restaurant, trust me. :) well, The ambience in dim lit modest surroundings is good.The appetizers lived upto their names. Chilli garlic red pepper chicken, red pepper fried fish were just awesome. Reagarding the main course, mixed hakka chow, hunan chicken, chicken golden joy special stew rice were average albeit served in ample amount for 2-3 people. Golden fry babycorn Was really good while the pineapple blossom was so not up to the mark. But dont miss the Mango shake and the Darsaan...

Golden Joy is located in China Town (Tangra) one of the famous place for Chinese food.Have been there so many times.The place is very huge and its fully crowded all the time specially on weekends. The ambience is very nice.

Now comes to the food part it offer alcohol at very cheap rates.Beside that Golden fried Prawn are their speciality.Whenever we go their its a fixed we ordered prawn chips and golden fried prawn.

The taste of every food is excellent.Quality and Quantity of food is perfect.
Lastly the service a little bit slow.But overall a place for anyone who loves Chinese food.

Golden Joy is one of the more popular eateries in Tangra located close to Beijing Restaurant,just take the right turn on ur way towards Beijing,u can also enter from the Bypass side entrance..This place is a pure bliss for tipplers..It offers Alcohol at quite cheap rates..also they serve higher quantities of alcohol in bottles bringing down the price largely..Alongwith it they serve some of the tastiest and spicy Indo-Chinese food,perfectly suited for the appetite of majority of kolkata foodies..Their speciality is surely the huge quanitity they serve,that too at a lesser bucks than most other famous tangra outlets..The only con is surely their lackadaisical service..They service is better only if u r a regular to this joint..Coming to food:
Golden Fried Prawns: Brilliant..great texture..crisp,fresh,light..
Pepper Chicken: Quite spicy,fried nicely,perfect with ur booze..
Dragon Fish: Loved the portion..fish was fresh and good..generous amount of cashew in the dish..
Hunan Chicken and Fish In Oyster Sauce also tasted pretty decent..just felt the oyster sauce should have been a bit more balanced in flavours..Both blend well with the Thai Fried Rice..
Lastly the Darsaan ends up a perfect meal..Loved the huge quantity even in half portions..Highly Recommended..Overall our total cheque comes to Rs.2500/- for 2 person including alcohol..

We've been visiting Golden Joy for quite a few years now and the best thing is that they have maintained their food quality. Yes the rates have gone up in the past few years but the standard of the food has remained the same. The best thing about this restaurant is that they dont rush their guests, they let you enjoy your food and drinks till late nights and will always have someone at your call no matter how late it is. My favourites definitely are the Golden Fried Prawns and the Red Pepper Chilli Garlic Chicken (made with a special Chinese wine and chillies soaked in vinegar).

Lost the magic in the Sands of time.  Yes when I have friends talking about a Chinese and booze,  what first comes in mind is golden joy but it seems that it's time to move on not because there are better places or I have become a millionaire but they are losing the uniqueness which differs them from other Chinese joints. 
It was my wife's birthdays and I took her for lunch. They let us choose a table and we were happy with it.  Food was awesome just like always and the bill was light on pocket. And they were definitely courteous.  The experience was good
Then it was my sisters birthday and we went for dinner.  We were given some horrible place right in some corner of the restaurant where I think nobody can even see us and neither we could.  Bad table.  Then came the food.  Duck was  not cooked properly,  barbecue chicken was horrible and the chow just lacked the taste which makes it enjoyable. And the waiter was very arrogant.  Won't pay a heed Inspite of calling out a hundred time.  Bad experience
Finally I took a chance and went there for my sis in laws birthday (lunch) .  The moment we entered there was an argument in choosing a table. We had to shout and quarrel to get a table of our choice even though the restaurant was quite empty.  Judging food was a waste of time cause it had nothing unique in it.  The taste was nothing great which was a big surprise compared to my earlier experiences. Waiters were serving food as if they were forced to.  Giving bad stares to the ladies with us.  Delaying in serving food. And had put on a face as if his wife ran away with his neighbour. A Completely pissing experience.
Dont know what's wrong with you guys. If you continue this way you would definitely break hearts of a lot of fans of tangra. But one thing for sure,  I am not gonna recommend this restaurant to anyone.  You better lose those unworthy staff who would cost you a big loss down the line.  If you actually give a damn in keeping up with other famous and  successful restaurants,  you seriously need a great change or else Golden joy would no longer be that golden or joyful. 
Hope this reaches to the right people.

I have't been to this place but I heard food is good ! But as I was scrolling through your menu  the price of your liquor is too high . You are not a even a three star hotel , they why is your liquor are over priced . The same 60 ml Smirnoff will cost 110 in Green Palace in Bhowanipur while you guys are charging 170 . This is not at all acceptable . I want to visit your place but your liquor pricing strategy keeping me at bay . I hope you guys are taking notice of this .

I won't say the food is good but it is ok at that price.  Environment is good.  But the only reason I will never visit the restaurant again is because of the staff.  They are extremely unprofessional, doesn't know how to serve, keeps gossiping amongst themselves in foul language in front of guests.  The head captain in particular is very rude and lacks courtesy. I am writing this because a lot of my friends visit this joint and hope they read my comment and makes a better choice of having a nice lunch/dinner somewhere else.

Tangra is one of the go-to areas in Kolkata for decent to great Chinese food. Stiff competition among big names in this area lets the quality of food soar! Golden Joy, in my personal opinion, is the best restaurants for Chinese food in Kolkata - and the standout restaurant in Tangra. Now, the restaurant itself isn't much of an eye candy, even though it is decently decorated with proper seating and nice ambient tones. The food, however is exceptional. The staff as well, continue to deliver great service - 4 times I've been to this place. The last time I went to Golden Joy was a month back, and I could not notice any aspect which would lead me to write a half-negative review.
The cereals they offer are absolutely magnificent! Their noodles I would say, are probably better than their rice. Another great dish of theirs, which I always manage to end up ordering, is their fried prawns - incredible! With an easy budget and sinful dishes, Golden Joy makes for a brilliant outing - the location perhaps being its only undoing.
Thank you for reading, and please pardon any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

The most important thing about this restaurant is value for money . My friends and I chose this place as we love really spicy food and the food here is deliciously spicy . I've been to golden joy couple of times and have never been disalponted . We usually eat only starters and soups or dry mains and not any starches . The hot n sour soup here isn't soy loaded and is quite a refreshing change . We also love all started . The barbecue chicken was a show stealer as was the kung bao fish . 

The green dip they have on the table is mind numbing and do ask for the red chili sauce if u like spicy food . The prawn crackers are to die for .

The place is located in china town and still gets really filled with customers. This was my first visit here and we got a table quite quickly even though it was a Sunday. 

We were 7 guys out to eat and drink in china town, which has been neglected in recent times due to the numerous new joints that have come up in the city. The staff is courteous but their service is slow very very slow. Specially if you are there to drink just order the bottle of what you wish to drink.

The food was really horrible with only fish finger being the decent item. We ordered for chilly mushrooms, baby corn, chilly fish, prawn papad, fish finger and chilly paneer. I really felt that their food needs so much more improvement. Fish finger was good but they did not have tartare sauce and mushroom was about decent. The rest if it was really bad.

The drinks were served with quite a delay and since we have whiskey which it was good. 

The bill was around 8000 for the 7 of us which is pretty decent if their food was good. But for the kind of food they serve the prices are rather steep. We actually paid less for alcohol and more for food.

All in all there are much better places to go.

Food quality is v good however customer service is horrible.
The bengali manager (takes order),who is a bit aged in the family section is extremely rude with the customers & doesnt treat customers well.
Hope the management looks into it & zomato also passes the feedback to the management.
A lot of my friends have decided on not visiting the place again & i am also planning the same.

On a birthday party, me & my husband was invited here. There were lots of dishes. Drinks, Starter, Main course & Desserts were there. I am a Chinese food lover. & China Town is my favorite destination for having the Chinese food. But this restaurant made us down. I really don't like the quality of food. Ambiance was fine and price is affordable.

Decent Chinese food. Loaded with MSG!
The best part of the whole meal were the vegetarian wantons and the veg rice noodles. The non vegetarians enjoyed their dishes as well but the chicken wantons were disappointing. The other disappointment was the Thai veg soup! 
All in all a very very decent meal at a decent price. 
The service is fast and efficient.

The service is very slow, had wait for nearly 30 mis for the appatiseres and even longer for the main course, we couldn't order desert due to lack of time. Garlic pepper chicken has always been my fevarit and mixed fried rice with kungpao chicken and green chilli chicken is something i tasted for the first time and i loved it.... Over all i had a nice experiance and i would like to go back there soon.

After much convincing my parents agreed to go to this place for dinner. And we were not left disappointed. We ordered for small size manchow soup, chilli paneer, garlic sauce, egg fried rice and darsan with vanilla ice cream. Everything tasted delicious and the portion size was absolutely worth the money. Service was a little on the slower side, but it was probably because the place was packed. Overall a very good experience.

China town in itself does not need much of an explanation. Golden Joy is one of the better restaurants here. The starters are good, especially the chicken drumstick and fish finger. 

The seating area is huge and the ambiance is pleasant. They also have a dedicated smoking zone.

But the service could be better as it is slightly on the slower side.

Golden Joy as the name suggests, fills you with joy with the delicious cuisine it offers. It is one of the best places in Kolkata if you want to have a good chinese meal. My top fav here is definitely the 'Golden Fried fish' and Golden Fried Prawns', Prawn chips. Apart from this the ambience is also good, where you can enjoy good food with your family and friends alike. It will be a good dining experience.

One of the best restaurants in Tangra. We ordered mostly starters and all of them were good. Starters like Chilli Garlic Red Pepper Chicken / Fish , Thread Chicken , Lut Me, Salt and Pepper Chicken were awesome. In maincourse we had Mixed Mei Foon  and Woolly Chicken.The food was pretty good.The price also seems to be perfect.Golden Joy is a good value for money.But the number of staffs in the ground floor attending customers should be increased though. Many a times we had to wait for 10 minutes to just place an order.

A perfect place for Chinese dinner at Tangra. This place is always full and during weekends its a tough task to find a table here. The speciality here is the Golden Fried Fish. Every item on the menu is prepared nicely though the food is a little oily typical of Tangra eateries. The service is good too.

A pocket friendly place to be if in a group and you're looking for drinks and good food.would recommend thread chicken and crispy chilli garlic pepper chicken and fish in starters.schezuan noodles is worth mentioning in main course.i would strongly suggest kung pao fish here.we had ordered chicken in oyster sauce and is a good option for bland food lovers . desserts were a disappointment. Brownie with ice cream being the only good option.

Even though, in the search of good cuisine, one were to ignore the fact that this eatery is located in the heart of a slum-like neighbourhood , yet the hospitality, the kind of patronage this place attracts and most importantly, the food, are less than attractive to a person of taste. Bad food, they say, is palatable provided the circumstances of consuming it are warm & friendly. This place is avoidable on both counts. On the other hand if your selection is purely based on availability of cheap liquor & if you don't mind expletives pouring out of a neighbouring table that will make a sailor blush, then you'll truly be at home here.

I also had 2 big bottle of beer and pea nut. It's pocket  friendly too. After having all dose bill was only 1240. Superb. But one thing i want to say that one of their waiter came to ask and he was asking  for tip. Which i did not like because it's upto me what i like to give them . Except this everything was very good

Another of my favourite is the kung pao chicken. The noodles here is js so smooth n very different from the other places, it is full of flavour.. Not too fond of the fried rice here..

This place offers you delicious Chinese food cooked by expert hands, a descent relaxing ambience, a nice service & all these without burning a hole in your pocket. 
The last time we went there we ordered Golden Joy special mixed fried rice, Hunan chicken . The food was satisfying & we had a very nice experience overall.

What makes this restaurant great is its ambience. Food quality and service being an icing on the cake. They can of course work on the seating arrangement a bit, especially for the two seaters. 

As for the food, I enjoyed the crispness of the chicken wantons, the amazing mix of flavors on the chicken thai fried rice and the hunan chicken. However,  I personally think the chicken could have been a little less on the sweeter side but that's more of a personal choice! Other than that, really enjoyed the afternoon here. Perfect for a family gathering as well as for a luncheon with friends too.

This is possibly the most affordable place to enjoy a few glasses of drink, the system they use is good. 

It reduces the annoying factor of asking for refilling, plus the more you drink the move you safe, and thus it's a great place for treats, get together and etc. 

Another thing worth mentioning is their ambience, feel free and comfortable to bring women in their family section, it's actually made for that specific purpose, and a gang of guys can have their own share of fun separately on the ground floor. 
You will never feel out of place here. 

Coming to the food, the price they charge for some Chinese main course dishes is really at par, plus the quality can't be too much complained about. The quantity provided is enough for two average eating people. 
Stop by here and have your own share of fun.

Strategically located at the entrance of Chinatown next to Beijing. Valet parking was like a breeze. A group of 17 corporates visited during lunch. Table was made available immediately. This restaurant has the best ambiance in the locality.

In starters we ordered Stuffed Mushroom and Threaded Paneer for the vegetarians. While the non-vegetarians selected Threaded Chicken, Lut Me Chicken, Woolly Chicken and Golden Fried Prawn. Each and every item of starters are excellent and must try. Special mention about Thread Chicken which hotel management claims can only be available here in the world. Skipping such signature dish is a sin.

During main course in rice we ordered Mixed Sichuan Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice and Vegetable Fried Rice. We felt like stupid by ordering variety but there was no difference visually or taste wise among these dishes. Mixed Friend Rice had only chicken but nothing else. As side dishes we asked for Lemon Chili Chicken, Hunan Chicken, Sichuan Chicken and Chili Paneer. Apart from Lemon Chili Chicken all sauces tasted same. Even servers were confused by looking at the dish which is what while serving. Lemon Chili Chicken had not hint of lemon in the taste. No compliant taste wise but food also has visual value. Felt like cheated.

Apart from custard nothing else was available in dessert. Cup ice cream was served in a bowl with the same green spoon.

We found the captain Mr. Mark who was noting down order was very absent minded and while taking order he kept on looking around the hotel and suddenly moving from one table to another in middle of noting down KOT. Servers were slow and was not serving food correctly. Captain was clueless. A huge improvement in service and visual appeal for dishes are required. Bill came to INR 6400 with beer and lime soda. In short didn't live up to my expectation though opening was great with starters.

Ordered dragon chicken, lut me chicken, thread chicken(must have), thread paneer(one of my favourite), stuffed mushroom(best for mushroom lovers) and mixed hakka noodle. We didn't order any side dish with the noodle as we were so full by then. Each and every dish was way too good. Good service. Good ambience. I would like to visit this place again.

However my second visit was a disaster!!! I went there on my birthday with my girlfriend and it was  a sunday. The place was overcrowded and the waiters were having a hard time to attend   to the customers. There was not a single place vacant  and we were unfortunately given a seating arrangment which we didnt like at all. It was very noisy too which made it a very annoying experience for us.  However the food was quite tasty and it actually made up for the unpleasant part. It is perhaps the best restaurant in that area and i would recommend people to go there .

No one can question about the quality of food, it was just Yummm. We ordered thread chicken, crispy mushroom, roasted duck and prawn chips. Add up alcohol and beer to that. It was a value for money deal as the price of the items were truly cheap. Summation of solid ambience and quick services make the place a paradise for the foodies.
Next time, if I go to China Town, Golden Joy it will be

I have been here a lot of times & most of the dishes I had were really good but two items which I always order are The Drums of Heaven & The Chicken Canton Chow. If you come here you have to try these two dishes. Apart from the food the overall service is fine & pocket friendly. So thumps up to this place ????

This is a place you go back to all the time. The food is wholesome and value for money. The waiters are helpful and attentive. As the area is huge there is very little waiting time. We love the typical Calcutta Chinese fare which reminds us of our childhood eating out experiences. We loved the steamed rice especially as it suited everyone in the family. The golden fried fish was just great. Really good fare...

Visited again yesterday with friends so would like to make some clarification...the sevice and the staff behaviour has definitely changed for the worse...they make you wait and do not respond when you speak to them...the food remains good though

Returning to Tangra after almost 35 years for a Chinese meal, Chinatown has received a total makeover, and Golden Joy appears to lead the charge. On Christmas Day, for lunch, there was a waiting of about 40-50 people outside, despite two floors and what I think would be 300+ covers.

Leaving selection to the family who runs the place is the best idea, we said (we were two) that we were hungry, we wanted to try anything in not-fried pork, not-fried noodles and a couple of healthy starters of which one could please be veg and the other prawn. As for the soup, we left it to them, too, and it was (I think) a portion of the hot-pot lantern soup each and was, simply, too delicious.

That's what we got, prawns king size done in a lightly grilled manner I think and some baby corn starters again lightly cooked and covered with a sauce of a fairly interestingly chilly sort. The pork pieces in some dainty sour-hot sauce was out of the world, as were the fine glassy mee foon noodles.

Two of us ate for about 1200/- rupees without alcohol, brilliant service, and not to be missed either to or from the airport, slight diversion, if you have the time.

This is Calcutta Chinese at its best and once again I suggest you lay the basic guidelines and then let the restaurant people do the rest.

Tangra is almost synonymous wth this Chinese restaurant serving specialities like tangy barbeque chicken,goes perfct wth the alcohol..proceed to the water world..the prawn chips and golden fried prawn are quite an apetizer..personally,I like their chow more than the rice..team it up with a gravy dish like  hunan chicken and you are sorted..good decor too

I was on holiday in Kolkata with my husband and daughter and wanted to try out Chinese at the famous Tangra area. I was suggested of this place by my friend who is a native of this neighborhood. I was aware of Tangra's infamous gallis and difficulty of finding parking space due to which I was apprehensive of venturing to this place. But i decided to take the chance and headed out and on reaching the place I was pleasantly surprised to find parking just outside the restaurant.
We stepped in and found that the dine-in was upstairs on the first floor. Surprisingly the place was very spacious (i was not expecting it to be so from outside). We were seated and handed the menu. The menu was very extensive that it was really difficult to make choices. After a lot of contemplation we decided to start with prawn chips, dimsums and crab cakes. The serving was such that we were already filled with just the starters. But since we had put in so much efforts coming here we wanted to try their main course also. So we ordered mixed hakka noodles and chilli chicken.
Rating: 1.5/2 for service; ambiance and pricing. 
3/3 for food, taste and servings. 
This is a great place to have authentic chinese food with family and friends with so much to choose from. What we had was just the tip of the iceberg. I will definitely be coming back to try out more.

Never, never ever again......Went there on 29Dec 2014, a Monday night.....food was ok but the service was beyond pathetic.....it was just atrocious...place was crowded like a metro car at rush hour....waiter named Neville was so arrogant and outright rude....seemed the guy owned the place and was doing us a favour by taking our order.......they took so long to get our stuff......the stir fry vegetables was a watery soup....and Neville gave us a stern tutorial to justify the same.....finally the  Loo was worse than a general compartment setup.....no soap, no toilet paper.....just a bucket n a watery liquid in a soap container.....don't know whether to laugh or cry......but pls the owners wake up.....pls teach your waiters some basic manners n spruce the place up.....as far as we r concerned you have lost us as customers for ever....

Terrible, terrible place! Went there because a friend was celebrating his wedding there, and wish I hadn't. The service was terrible. The waiters were standing right behind our table and cribbing about whose turn it was to take orders or serve the food. Then when we asked for menu cards, they simply pointed at one another. Three or four requests later, we got the menu cards, and after we were done with the starters, the plates were cleared again after three or four requests. The food took forever to arrive, and when it did, it was neither hot, nor very tasty. The Hakka Noodles was oily and the Garlic Chicken was way too spicy. 

We were in the family room, and there were kids with us. On the next table were two men who were conversing very loudly, and using raw Bengali expletives as they spoke. I don't know how this kind of people are allowed in family rooms. It is called "family room" for a reason. On asking the waiters, we were told that they were the owner's friends. That kind of language is simply not done in a public space, where there are children in the next table! Jesus! 

I don't think I will get back there. The food was bad, the service was worse, the ambience was terrible. Overall, my worst China Town experience.

This is THE place to go if you want to get drunk in Chinatown without much of a pocket pinch. Alcohol is very cheap and they serve it by bottle which comes economical and thus encourages copious drinking. During all my visits, I have always been welcomed by warm and attentive servers who keep keen eye on your needs and are always willing to cater to your whims. I love the service here. Ambiance is fine too. Plenty of seating although this place is always overflowing with patrons.
One must eat here whenever I visit this place are the Golden Fried Prawns. I can't have enough of them. Juicy, succulent prawns is crispy air-light seasoned batter. Bliss on your tongetip!!! I love the shrimp chilli balls and Thai fried chicken too. In the main course section, I love the Cantonnese mixed chow as always, the sichuan canton chow are the spicy variant and delicious. Woolly Chicken is a nice and different type of option.
Golden Joy is a very relaxing place to be where alcohol flows freely adding to the whole experience. I think food comes secondary here and that's okay with everybody.

The pilot announces that China Town is a must visit for anybody loves Chinese and is new to the City of Joy when the aeroplane lands at the Netaji Shubhas Chandra International Airport. Amongst all the eateries, Golden Joy is my favourite restaurant in China Town. I have had some superb Chinese dishes at this place. I have been here several times friend and family. The last time I visited this place, we had ordered Sweet Corn Chicken Soup, Fried Chicken Drum Stick, Chicken Korean Stick, Chicken Satay Stick, Crispy Dry Chilli Chicken. Each and every dish was extremely delicious. I had ordered Blue Cooler which is a soft drink and was equally good. I also like the Rice Noodles and Pan Fried Gravy Noodles at this eatery. They serve alcohol here as well like every other restaurant of China Town.The staff are very friendly here and they recommend the best dish according to your taste. The food items are very reasonable. I would recommend every person who loves Chinese food to visit this place atleast once.

Decent place for a good meal. The interiors are not mind blowing & it's pretty cramped & congested. However, they do serve a good fare & that too at very affordable rates. Try the Golden Fried Prawn, its simply amazing. The service is shambolic though & it needs improvement. Overall, a decent place in Tangra!

I just love their  chilli garlic red pepper chicken, dragon chicken, lut me chicken, whooly chicken and red pepper fried chicken . all of these goes well with booze.

Planned it since a long time and finally fulfilled it this puja rather after puja. With an intention to boose with great chinese food we drove to golden joy one evening. I must say it has great ambiance with very decent crowd, although we sat at family section but still. Drinks out here is very reasonalbe so we ordered some with prawn chips. As we had to drive back we consoled ourselves with beer.

China town is the only place known for its quality chinese food and I would say Golden Joy didnt dissapoint at all. Food was awesome and service was really great. Every one was very cooperative and always ready to help for any need. All together it was a great experiance dining at Golden Joy and looking forward to visit again.

***************************

An old renowned restaurant in Tangra (the location which i had not got opportunity to visit prior to the day). We had been there for Team party and we were around 20 people. Location wise, I must say that I did not like as we had to walk 15 min to get taxi (nearest traffic post) but apart from this we had an excellent time and food there.

Ambiance, as expected from a Chinese restaurant slightly dim, reddish and I should add suitable for drinkers ;)  

Coming to the taste of food, everybody was overjoyed after having chili shrimp, we ordered six plates of that so you can imagine the taste and we wanted to order more of that. But the fish item in starter was not up to the mark. Baby corn I must say was above average.

Next we ordered Mixed Chow, one of the chicken item and fish items. All were as we expected in our minds. Tasty  And obviously the drinks ;) and some refresher. Personal choices you know.

Service was not that good. Although the restaurant has lots of space and can accommodate large number of people but I guess the number staff members was also good, so we expected a bit better service. 

We are satisfied customers of Golden Joy. And Thanks to the staffs of Golden joy for their friendly behavior (special thanks to Nevel) . Would love to go again for drink and chili shrimp … cheers

Well well... Not at all joyfull experience... Visited on 1/11/14.. Ordered Mixed rice noodles / Mei foon and Hot Garlic chicken... Frankly speaking the very first moment have seen my rice noodles coming was excited for a sec but OH MY GOD! It was Cơm tấm. they served us broken rice noodles instead of Mei foon... Cơm tấm is a cheaper version of rice noodles as it's comes broken.. Most of the people having this particular dish don't get know about the difference.. Oh yes and the hot garlic chicken it was freaking hot (jhaal) man... Guy's I don't think this should be the appropriate taste for KOLKATANS.. Though the rice noodles were broken it tasted good...
my overall experience was so so.

P.S -- Update the menu... They have raised the price

We had the Lut me fish , chilly garlic prawns and Thai soup. Everything was great! All the starters! For main course we had Mapo fish with Hakka noodles and fried rice. The fish was really good. And to end the meal , we had perfectly crispy Darsaan with Vanilla ice cream :) definitely worth a second visit!

Well, Tangra is one of my favorite places to eat and Golden Joy is one of top reasons I say so. Amazing food - Lut Me fish, spring fried prawns, babycorn starter, and the soups were lovely. So we the staples - rice and noodles. Flavorsome and full of spice (thankfully not overpowering the dish). Sauces on the table allow you to futher up the spice levels by a few notches (if you have lost it). The manager and the service staff were efficient (read brisk service) and happy to recommend dishes. Ohh - did i forget the outstanding Darsaan to end :))

Not just another Chinese restaurant in Tangra, I must say!! This place has ample seating arrangement and remains pretty crowded even on a weekday. Here one would find a large variety of Chinese cuisine to choose from. We ordered a Mixed Mei-foon, a medium woolly chicken and Bombay chilli pork. The woolly chicken was shredded pieces of chicken and the sauce was flavoured really well. The pork was dry and spicy nonetheless tasted great. The Mei-foon was okay. Pocket pinch: Rs. 1040/- including alcohol. Thus, it is pretty evident that you can have a great food experience at an affordable price.

I don't know how I missed this place for so long. Its a huuuuuuuuge place. We went there on a Sunday around 3pm and the place was bustling. Sunday 3pm in lazy Calcutta, I would have bet my money on people snoozing. 
 
To start with we ordered a medium portion of the special soup. We though that would be enough for two....but it was approximately two bowls of soup each for both of us. A lot of soup (tasty tasty soup). With that we ordered the shrimp balls......they were more like pakoras but they did taste nice. 
 
 For the mains we ordered mixed Cantonese noodles with dry Green Chilli Fish. The noodles were divine.....I will go as far to say the best grave noodles I have had in recent times. The fish was a fishy fish....so bhetki for sure. It went well with the noodles. 

 After having our late lunch we were so happy that we decided to walk it back to Beckbagan. I can't wait to go back and try the other items on their menu. Only Hatari excites me this much when it comes to Calcutta Chinese.

I have been brought up on chinese food as my dad was chinese ..I had also worked in a managerial capacity of a reputed chinese restaurant for 17 years and I do know chinese food and i am a big time foodie . I even run a foodie group on Fb. I am mentioning this in case people question my knowledge of food. I had never been to tangra to sample the food there so after reading reviews I went to golden joy. I must say none of these reviews justify the rubbish they pass off as chinese food. I ordered hot and sour soup szechwan noodles, chicken fried rice , drums of heaven, kung pao chicken and garlic bok choi. The soup arrived exactly 18 minutes before the starters and in dirty old bowls. it was nothing like authentic chinese hot and sour but rather filled with only chilli sauce and contained boiled chicken. hot and sour soup needs to be made with pieces of raw chicken coarsely minced so that they stick to form tiny chunks of minced chicken. well the noodles and rice had no flavor of chinese in it but was acceptable. the kung pao chicken was not kung pao chicken at all which needs to be made with a brownish red gravy slightly sour and tangy containing diced onions and flavored with a bit of ginger..and roasted peanut. what i got was chunks of chicken and chopped red chilli floating in a red coloured insipid gravy. bok choi is a distinct  light green flowered leafy chinese vegetable sold in all markets of kolkata. what they gave me was sarsu saag (mustard leaf)which chinese restaurants use in soups and cantonese chowmein.  when the soup was almost over and i politely asked the steward what happened to the starters..i was told in an off hand manner 'please cooperate with us it will take time. I know it takes time but i also know you should serve soup and starters together. well i will never go there again. of course if you want quantity then golden joy is a good place but if you want quality..its certainly not for you

We visited this place on sasthi this year and also earlier this year. Ambience is quite decent and the behabiour of attendars is also good. We ordered chicken pakora, pepper chicken and anriquity blue in starter and in main course chili chicken full, mixed rice and mixed chowmin. All items are properly cooked also they have smoking place which is quite good to have for me atleast. They served the food fresh and hot. Atlast my overall rating is quite good, they made that day special for us.

& they served us well with great atmosphere 5/5
delicious food 4.5/5
decent behaviour of staffs
we had ordered sweet corn soup which was average in taste as i have tasted a lot better at other place.so 3/5 but while ordering they adviced us that our order may be huge n to cut it down which seems good..
then as starter fried spring chicken which was just awesome & the best part is it just melts in mouth n gives a fresh n spicy taste of chicken.. :) 
mixed noodles was a perfect mix of chicken shrimp n fresh veggies. so 4/5
lastly the best 1 was the singapore chicken.a soury n spicy taste just refreshed the tastebuds of ours so 5/5.
i would prefer to hang out next tym wid my besties.. :)

Chilling here with friend's is seriously amazing experiance and the ambience of the place and serving waiters are too decent.
Best is when if you reserve the table before you get there. No question whatsoever for the whole staffs at any time. The food is great whatever the dishes are. During the festive season(Durga Puja) and on the weekends it is too jam-packed and sometimes it is too annoying for the people who wish too have drinks quietly and being on their planet.!!!!!!!

It is the pujo time and we decided to start tge ausipicious occassion with a good time in this restaurant in Tangra....we ordered for crispy chicken, chilly garlic red pepper fish, dry chilli chicken and dish finger along with regular potions of alcohol. Criapy chicken was made well made but only the sauce was not properly mixed in the wntire plate so half of the pieces were actually without any sauce and too much use of ginger was a problem...the chilli garlic fish was good but didnt see red pepper as per name of the dish... Dry chilli chicken was ok and felt that they didnt use the sauces properly..it tasted the same as pepper chicken in many ither places...the fish finger was a safe dish and the quality of the fiah was good.

The service was poor and tgey took 10 mins to come and take orders...the manager appeared to be arrogant and considering that the ground floor is stag only, he tried to behave like a warden...

Tge shocking fact was that they are charging atleast 100 rupees more due to the puja occassion which we felt like cheating....

If you are looking for chinese food in Kolkata, you can just straight away head to Tangra. You will find hundreds of restaurants as you keep going into those lanes. But not all those are good. Some are pathetic. For good food in Tangra, you must know which restaurants are good. 
One of the good restaurants is Golden Joy. The place is difficult to spot if you have never been there but the restaurants is never really empty during weekends. I am a vegetarian and so I could only order from  25% of what was there on the menu. A vegetarian in a chinese restaurant is like a teetotaler in a bar. Anyways I ordered what I could eat and some beer along with that. The ambience of the place is good. They could maintain the place in a better way though. The guy who was taking the order was having a difficult time trying to handle the place. When we were ordering, he told us that it was a lot of food and we probably won't be able to finish it. That seemed like a good advice because people don't do this everywhere. Though we finished all of that and ordered more. He came to us and asked "Do you guys go to the gym?"  We burst out laughing. Just then India lost the match they were playing and a few people got really upset, also started saying "BullChit! BullChit! This match was fixed." One of the waiters came and told me this is what happens in India, these people never learn and can never take a game sportingly. He was right. The manager came to us again and told us "Aap logo ne yahan batting start ki, aur wahan batting bandh ho gayi!" That was funny.
Though India lost the game, we had a great time. The food was good. I had ordered Dry Crispy Chilli Babycorn and the guy got me Gravy babycorn. At first he argued saying that was what I had ordered, later requested me to take it. We were too hungry to wait and we just ate that.  

That was a long review but it was a fun evening and we enjoyed. We had no complains about the food or the service as such. The beer was cold enough. Whenever you head to Tangra next, do give Golden Joy a try.

This place is a treat for all Chinese lovers. Located in the famous china town, it offers variety of authentic Chinese dishes in fairly reasonable price(as per quantity and ambience of the place).
Being purely veg, I thought that this place might not offer much, but I was proven wrong. The waiters are very courteous and helpful specially selecting the right recipes and proportion. 
Do try gravy noodles, rice noodles, Manchurian and soups. But proportions are too big so ask the waiter to help you select the right proportions else you will end up wasting good food and hard earned money.

Waiter - Mr Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?

Mr Hanna (Matthew McConaughey)  - Well, Hector, here's the game plan. You're gonna bring us two Absolut Martinis, you know how I like them, straight up and then
 precisely seven and one half minutes after that you're gonna bring us two more and then two more after that every five minutes, until one of us passes the f**K out. 
Waiter - An excellent strategy, Sir.
A scene from "The Wolf of Wall Street". 
Our game plan was quite similar except for the fact that there were no Martinis just old fashioned premium whisky and it wasn't a glorious afternoon but a pleasant evening. Good enough for us though.Occasion - A new job, new colleaguesLocation - Golden Joy, TangraNumber of people - 7 including myself.

Though I have been to Tangra several times I had never been to this place in fact I had a tough time figuring out where they were located actually but I finally found them tucked in a corner in a lane just opposite to Beijing. Having said that its not a small restaurant by any means, quite spacious with multiple dining spaces. The decor is also not bad either it's dimly lit with Chinese scriptures on the walls everything in red mostly overall I would say it's good.Would like to mention that the staff were friendly too, on our arrival a gentleman put his arm around me to suggest something while I was ordering drinks just to assure me that we were in safe hands I guess he was the manager, it was a nice little gesture on his part and it's things like these that makes you go back. Anyway we weren't there to eat we were there to drink so we kept our food to just starters which were the ever dependable crispy chilly baby corn for the vegetarian colleague, the Bombay chilly chicken recommended by Mr. Batabyal who is a regular here I guess and 2 plates of drums of heaven. Now for some strange reason I couldn't find the Bombay chilly chicken on their menu he just ordered and the waiter nodded his approval both of them knew what they were doing and I gave in, maybe this dish is one of their specialties and yes 2 litres of whisky (Signature) and 2 beers. I felt The Bombay chilly chicken compared to the  regular one is less spicy with a tangy flavor. I like experimenting with food to a certain extent so it doesn't really make a difference to me. The crispy chilly baby-corn was not crispy by the time it came to our table but it was chilly much to my liking, lastly the drums of heaven now they were crispy and the pieces were juicy as well, went down well with the liquor. The quantity didn't disappoint either because some of it had to be packed as we couldn't finish it. Ordering drinks in bottles should be the plan if you are in a group where everyone drinks and that's what we did as well though I like to smoke at my seat most restaurants don't allow that but having a smoking zone on the same floor is also appreciated so I am not complaining at least they didn't make us go out. The bill I guess was somewhere around Rs.6000 which was equally distributed so nobody felt the pinch. They have a decent parking space as well with valet parking which is what I heard my friends discussing in the car I  was too drunk to bother. Overall I had fun at this place but then the definition varies from person to person for me it's with friends eating, drinking, talking nonsense and just being stupid so cheers to a new beginning I guess.

Golden Joy will surely be one of the most value for money restaurants in Tangra region.
The manager who receives the guests is very cordial and friendly. He can connect with people very easily and will make you feel at home. On contrary, his helping hands are little bit messy.
The food is very good, and in particular best suited Chinese food for Bengali test buds. I have explored different options of meifoon, noodles & fried rice and each time I liked it.
The price is reasonable. If you opt for chicken and fish dishes, then the entire meal including starter & dessert will cost you 600-800 for 2 people. Prawns will cost you a little more.
The restaurant having multiple dining rooms , even for private parties.
Another point to mention here is the large parking space which can accommodate approx 30 cars.

Golden Joy is probably one of the best restaurants in China Town Area with a decent decor and quality Chinese food. The prawn items are simply delicious here. I love the golden fried prawns here. The menu has a variety of options when it comes to Chinese food. I tried the Chinese chopseuy and i just loved it. The other Chinese items like fried rice and noodles are usually tasty and served in good quantity. The garlic chicken and the prawn manchurian needs a special mention here. A great place to dine out with your family members in China Town.

As the name suggests, this place brings joys to every diner's face by offering exquisite Chinese delicacies. The quantity of every dish is sufficient for 3 people. The ambience is just ok and service is good. The decor is very simple. Pricing was good but off late they have increased the prices, but still is easy on the pocket as compared to other places.
The ambience is fully Chinese , with the scripts hanging on the walls , and plenty of Chinese folks dining . The food is a marvel , with Hunan chicken and Hakka noodles ruling our minds .
We started with tangy, thread chicken and wanton noodle soup. They have a give a half serving option, which works wonders for experimental foodies. Main course was Chicken Sichuan Fried Rice...with Hunan Fish. Again, great. All this for arnd INR 600 between 2 people. Will visit again. Staff was also friendly, though kind of busy given it was a sunday.

Golden Joy is my new discovery, when I had visited Kolkata last December. It is situated in China Town and boasts of serving authentic yummy Chinese food. Special Mention : Mixed gravy noodles, Prawn Manchurian, Chicken drumsticks.
Talking of ambiance, it is quite spacious and is extremely crowded during weekends, which shows its popularity. Dimly lit, soft music-the perfect ambiance to go out and have lunch with friends, on a Sunday Afternoon. 
Serving , well it's slow, because  it remains pretty crowded. But overall, I really loved the food and  ambiance. I would really recommend this place to people who really love good Chinese food.

This is of the better places serving Chinese. Food is good, the seating a little crammed up though. I had especially liked the Red Pepper Fried Prawn, the Chicken Satay and Shrimp Chili Ball. They serve a wide range of alcohol too, so you won't have a problem choosing your favorite. I love the food here and would surely recommend.

It is a joy to have a meal at golden joy - a great family restaurant! I have been there a couple of times and every time the experience has been good. Every waiter has his own recommendation in terms of what to order and I must say that they are honest. Never I have seen them advising to make money - the quantity and the type dishes are just apt. 
The service is fast and generally the will ask for a feedback if the food is good. Quite professional in the service they offer.  The drinks are affordable and can be ordered in bottles as well. The smoking zone is within the same floor so need not go out :) 
The food no doubt is tasty and well cooked. 
The parking service is ok- they can improve on it. 
Overall it is a place that I will come again and again - really not sure why! May be because it serves the best Chinese cuisine on town along with the service. Oh yes ! Un-Like many other restaurants in kolkata it is not closed during afternoon hours. So you can walk-in any time.

Last weekend i managed to visit this place after hearing so much. Looking at the menu i was surprised to see that it served liquor by a full bottle and also a litre!! That was pleasant for folks like us who don't stop at 2 pegs and drink in a group. The roast duck was awesome. Soft tender and juicy. However what disappointed me was that in the family section where we were sittin since we had few female friends there were a group of guys who were drunk md creating public nuisance. On asking the waiter as to why they have been allowed in the family section he said they are regulars. For a hotel of this standard it was rather bad. But food was excellent. They do need to prep up on ambience.

From Rishab's Taste Desk --

frankly speaking, for us, China town manei Golden Joy chilo for a greater part of our school and college life. Hence, have visited this place  many times. 

Taste  : -

"If you wish to go for authentic Chinese you wont get dissappointed in here" - was all I used to say when somebody used to ask me about this place. But my opinion changed a bit, when I visited quite recently and found out that the quality has degraded a bit -  as a result my taste buds  got a bit dissappointed  :

Booze :

friends, if you are planning to go out boozing with your friends I suggest this is the best place. The best part that I liked in this restaurant is that the availability of the BOTTLE system  i.e. you can either opt for pegs or u can buy an entire BOTTLE as per your convenience - a feature which is not available in many restaurants.


Ambience :

If you talk about the ambience, this place is upto its standard. You can take your family or friends and none will complain - thats for sure.

Piece of advise - 

Bhai, pujor somoyta jash na .. the price shoots up like a rocket all of a sudden!! :P

Though I visited this place about a month ago on a Sunday night, I luckily managed to get a seat in the first floor.  Being it Sunday,  it was over crowded. Still we got our food within a moderate stipulated time after we ordered. The ambiance was nice and spacious. 

We ordered chicken sweet corn soup, chilli garlic pepper chicken, golden fried prawn. The soup was "okayese". But the  pepper chicken was spicy and dry. It could be deadly combination drinks. The golden fried prawn was awesome. It was one of best I've ever had anywhere in the town. This is a must try item. 

In the main course, we tried  American chopsey, rice noodles, sicuan noodles, kumpau chicken, garlic chicken. American chopsey was as usual. The sicuan noodles, kumpau chicken were awesome. But rice noodles was a big disappointment for us.  It seemed that the noodles and chicken slices were boiled and served, nothing added to it. I was tasteless. Never try this item. Overall, it was a good experience and it deserves a thumbs up from myself.

Another eatery which is situated in a very odd place. This is my second favourite place in Tangra for having chinese. Food is delectable,quantity is overwhelming and pricing is moderate but if you have a lot of food then expenses are obviously heavy. Staffs are well-mannered and some staffs are informative while the others are not. They serve food timely if told,or else they take a lot of time. Sitting arrangement is cozy while being dimly lit making it an amazing combination. There is also a banquet. :)

When you step inside this dark and old looking restuarant you surely won't expect to be served anything great. But I guess that's what they mean when they tell us not to judge a book by its cover.
The Chinese food is simply delectable. Their prawn starters shouldn't be missed. I love the kungpao chicken and Cantonese noodles. Was a bit dissapointed when they told me they didn't have the crab and coriander soup though. I recommend this place if your looking  for great food and if you don't mind the dark interiors and waiters yelling at each other ????

I am a regular at this place. All  I can say is that their food is really good. Perfect for Bengali taste buds. Not sure how authentic each dish is, though they do have some authentic ones, whatever fusion they prepare goes very well down the taste buds. Just like what we call Punjabi Chinese in Delhi. I have had all kinds of food here (been visiting since the last 2 years), both with friends (while sitting on the ground floor) and on the 1st floor (with family). Trust me, each of them have been really good and tasty. Each dish is sufficient for two individuals. And price is very reasonable.

I even carry food from here when I return back home to Delhi.

Weekends are jam packed. Even though they have a huge place, you still have to wait before you get a seat. But its worth the wait. Weekdays are better, except Friday ofcourse.

Definitely recommended.

Eatn at an eatery by roadside would HV served tastier food.. Roast duck had more bones than ne flesh.. Well all in all golden joys food was not befitting zomatos user choice recognition sry to say

Not too low on budget....but still economic as the quantity of the food per item is quite good. Try out the Prawn Fried Wontons and golden joy special....the taste just wouldn't have got better. The Lemon Chiken and the meifoon is also good....with the perfect crisp in the chicken pieces. It surely is one of the best restos at China Town....a must visit ...keep it up!!

I have visited this place twice and I have been more than satisfied both of the times. Went there on my birthday the first time, with a gang of five. We ordered a bottle of white rum to start along with a plate of Shrimp with Oyster sauce. The booze here is quite cheap and food is really good. You have the option of opting for a half plate or a full plate and the half plate is good enough for two. The price of these delicious dishes are quite pocket friendly and you couldn't help but want more. Then we ordered some Thai Fried Chicken which was equally good. The ambiance has a nice vibe to it, the perfect place to chill with a group of friends. After a couple of hours, we finally ordered some lunch. The Prawn Sichuan Friend Rice, Chicken Thai Fried Rice came promptly along with Shredded Chicken and Hunan Chicken. The staff are quite friendly and always available when called upon. It was a really nice first experience. The total bill amounted to around 4000.

On my second visit, we had a few beers along with some starters. Thankfully it had all the brands which were mentioned a in the menu. We settled for some Carlsberg Elephant and some Heineken along with Spring Friend Prawns and Kowloon Chicken. These dishes were really good and I have to say, this is one the best Chinese restaurants in all of Kolkata. This time the bill came around 1000Rs.

It's definitely my first choice in China Town and a perfect place to give a treat to your friends without a burning a hole in your pocket. :)

One of the better restaurants in China Town. The food is pretty good. Ambiance is also very nice. Car parking facility is good, or else parking in china town would be difficult. We had Red Pepper Fried Prawns and Golden Fried Fish for starters, which was amazing. Mixed Hakka Noodles and Hot Garlic Chicken for main course, which also tasted decent.

Cost of 2 in my case: 1400 approx (without alcohol), 2200 approx (with alcohol).

So many tables and all full till late hours on Thursdays as well. Golden Joy surprised me with the food. Highly recommended for Chinese food. If you have been to tangra before and havent visited Golden Joy you have to do it.

I have been here today for the first time. Place is not at all appealing for the first sight. 
We started with drinks first. Tuborg, as I couldn't consume the taste I opted for smirnoff with orange juice. Then went for a cocktail baccardi rust. Taste was very mild and soothing that's why went for another. 
For starters we had crispy chilli baby corn. For the main course there was mixed frief rice, hakka egg noodles, chilli paneer, hunan chicken and manchurian mushroom and baby corn.
Noodles was very tasty only good item on the menu, chicken came bland then after complaining they changed it though but taste wasn't good enough. Chilli paneer, cottage cheese weren't fresh and it was hard and chewy. In desert we ordered for butter scotch ice cream but the sad part was it was simply cup ice cream from the market. They didn't even bother to remove the green plastic spoon. Service was fair enough though. But not finest Chinese we got to eat after spending 2660 INR.

We visited this place about a month ago on a Friday night.
It was very much crowded and so we finally found a table on the second floor.
We were 5 people.
Things we ordered :-
1) Chicken sweet corn soup - It tasted like it is supposed to be and was pretty nice with good amount of chicken pieces.
2) Pepper Chicken - It was perfectly cooked, soft and very tasty.
3) Golden Fried Prawns - Nothing can go wrong with Golden Fried Prawns. One of best I've ever had anywhere. The batter was extreamly soft and thin which was not suppressing the taste of the fresh prawns. It was just perfect or should I say, more than perfect.
4) Prawn Cantonese Noodles : Just too good. Not to bland, not too spicy. Just perfect. Full of prawns and chicken.
5) Prawn Thai Friedrice : DO NOT EVER ORDER THIS. It did not have salt or pepper and it does'nt even taste like the authentic Thai Friedrice which we had in Thailand. It seemed as if the rice was stirred in the red curry paste. It was absolutely tasteless.
6) Singapore Chilli Fish : Absolutely amazing.
7) Green Chilli Chicken : Now. This was the showstopper. Wow. This was succulent. Loved it.
The bill was around Rs.2950.
Overall, it was a very nice experience.
Would love to visit this place again. :D

A great experience if you are looking for some great Chinese cooking without burning a hole in your pocket. We went in as a group of 5 and got seats within a few minutes which was a pleasant surprise . 

Our order :-

The large bowl of Chicken Wanton Soup that served all of us easily -in one word, amazing!

The usual Hakka noodles and chicken rice -Good to taste , two plates of noodles and one bowl of rice was good enough to serve us all. 

Chicken In Oyster Sauce - This was my recommendation and has always been a personal delight . The preparation gets full marks , right down to the tangy taste of the gravy and the soft chunk of pineapple . For people who like a softer course without spice overdoses , this is a good bet .

Hunan Chicken - In contrast to the lighter oyster sauce , Hunan Chicken is heavy in spices . The chicken itself felt slightly undercooked at times but the gravy was a perfect combo to the rice and the noodles. 

Darshan- Another personal favourite of mine , when it comes to desserts few can beat the charm and experience that is Darshan. One plate and five scoops of ice cream to eat it with macs the best part of the night for us .

One thing to add , the server was really helpful with recommendations and even offered his insight on quantities to be offered to fit our group . That wins brownie points for the place itself !

Our total bill came to just 1.6k which is a delight on the pockets as compared to some high end joints I have been to recently . 

In short , Golden Joy is indeed a joy. Come here for the taste , leave while keeping your wallet happy.

Went there with a large group for team lunch. The place is difficult to find and more so if you do not have regular goers to this place. Food quality was good and very pocket friendly. The waiters were ok but the one who took the orders was quite rude. The place is dimly lit which feels a bit awkward during lunch hours. Overall I would recommend this place if you are in a large group and have budget constraints.

Golden Joy is the only chinese restaurant in tangra I mostly visit. The food there is good and there is alot of variety. The dishes you should really try are the crispy chilly shrimps and mixed chicken vegetable. It is a soothing experience. The ambience is warm and welcoming. The price is also worth paying.

A friend and me together visited Golden Joy Restaurant in China Town Tangra. Second time for me after a long gap. They have kept up their ambience well especially upstairs in the Family section. Clean cozy cool and comfortable. Once inside one gets cut off from the China Town dust din and bustle outside. They have their own parking arrangements.
We had chilled beer with starters Garlic  Prawn Chicken Pakora Golden Fried Prawn and Shrimp Papad. In main dish we had Hakka mixed Noodles with Sweet and Sour Pork.
All the snack items were in large helpings. So half plate between two of us was sufficient. Chicken was soft and succulent. Golden Fried Prawn is most appetizing to look at and very tasty and well done. Recommended must order here.
Noodles were soft tasty and made a good pairing with sweet sour Pork
Except that the pork pieces tasted like Chicken.
With four large beers between two of us and six dishes the total bill of Rs 2100/- was quite reasonable and very satisfying.
A must visit in China Town.

Golden Joy Is a place which made me contemplate a lot. My journey with it started last year when my Fiance hosted his Birthday dinner and then the place like a magnetic reaction forced us to go back on My own bday last Year. But the drama doesn't end there . Last Saturday i hosted my Fiance's Bday Bash there and here i start contemplating. Golden Joy is one of the best Chinese Experiences i had in my life...and trust me the experiences are quite few in number as i am not an ardent fan of that particular Cuisine. But Golden Joy does entice my taste buds in all sort of ways. The food is just Unnervingly Fresh and the proper amalgamation of all the spices just makes you awestruck. There are very few joints who are at par with their Veg Section and Golden Joy Definitely tops the chart. My all time favorite is their Golden Fried Prawn. The full Plate is good to feed 6 -8 People. The Perfectly cooked medium sized prawns with the adornment of Sweet Chili Sauce and Luscious red chili flakes and the aromatic king Garlic blending a heavenly gastronomical concoction just makes you go...HOLY MOSES!!! We tried a very new dish called the threaded chicken which is like chicken strips fried in thread like batter its a perfect combination of Crispy outside and Juicy wholesome goodness inside. The surprise was The Veg Starters. Thanks to Susham who has taken upon himself to have veg on Saturday's we had to order two veg. Starters, One Chilly Potato as we where tired of the baby corn fiasco which is common in veg starters in a Chinese restaurant. And then the 2nd starter was a paneer korean stick. Lets start with the Chilly Potatoes. Julian potatoes fried in in soy and sweet chili sauce stir fried in the 2nd round with Shallots, Garlic, and loads and loads of love. The Paneer Korean Sticks where basically paneer dipped in spiced batter and fried . In the Satay stick it looked like golden blocks studded between green emerald Capsicum) and Purple Sapphire (Onions). Delectable is the word which comes to my mind when i recapitulate the taste of these two dishes in my foodie mind. For Main Course we ordered Veg Fried rice, Veg Chowmein both delicately cooked to the finesse. Entree was Chicken in Oyster Sauce (Spoon licking Good) and Hot garlic Fish (Awesome awesome awesome). In Veg we ordered a Baby corn and mushroom Manchurian which gave close competition to the Non veg Entree's . 
But now where i had to contemplate. As you can clearly see the food deserves a Five Star ranking from me but i was compelled to Give a four . Reason being their below average Service. The staff there looked irritated when we ordered fresh lime soda in room temperature for a friend of mine. For the drinks 1st we where served a cracked glass and when we requested them to Change it the glass came after at least 15 reminders and 45 mins. later. The waiter served us the peg in a small glass and the soda and when we asked for the glass to make the drink he told us to have it in the peg glass, that was disdainful. 

Where you get food of 5 star quality the service needs to be of 7 star standards. Otherwise slowly the bad experience with placing the order overpowers the taste of the food.

Visited the place for the first time today and was absolutely delighted. We were very hungry and decided to go for the staples. 
Starters- Fried Chicken Wontons
Mains: Prawn Chow, Chicken Fried Rice, Schuan Fish and Manchurian Chicken. 
Firstly the ambience is very good and cosy. Nice comfy seating, albiet a little crowded. We took half portions of all proteins and were delightfully suprised to get such large potions. Seven pieces in each and it was quite enough for three people. 
The wantons were beautifully crisp, although there was no proper sauce like sweet chilli to accompany it. The fish was tender and juicy and served in bite sized portions. There was just enough sauce, neither too much nor too little. The chicken too came in bite sized pieces in a standard manchrian sauce, which was quite good. Soft and juicy, it cut easily. The rice and chow was absolutely delicious. They were not dry and each mouthful was full of flavour. There were quite a lot of prawns in the chow. We finished off with vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. 
The service took a little time, but that may be attributed to the crowd. The servers are nice and pleasant, especially the old Chinese guy in the suit. This is no "high class" place as in evident in the lack of table napkins, but is perfect for a night out with family. Reasonably priced, it is perfect for a family night out :)

Ordered:-
•Roast duck
•Chicken fried rice
•Hot garlic chicken
•Golden joy special chicken

It was crowded so had to take parcel from here. The roast duck was amazing! Chicken fried rice was not that good, hot garlic chicken was okay in taste and golden joy special chicken was good. Hot garlic as the name suggests was medium spicy and the golden joy special chicken was bland. I liked its taste though.

P.S. Do try the Roast Duck.

I simply lurve this place. .. I have treated my frnd twice there...
I love their food and starter items....
Espcly
their chicken coriander soup and hot and sour soup.... Thread chicken has a very flat taste you might want a lot of sauce to have it. ... Quantity of rice is also good.. But here have chowmein rather than rice coz rice also have a flat taste... I thing is that they put less salt in every dish.... So keep the salt shaker nearby. But the main positive to come here again and again is the booze here cost comparatively cheap. So for that a big thumbs up... (Y)

Golden Joy is a value-for-money joint like many other Tangra restaurants. It's USP is its sprawling spacious eating area and the crowd comprises mostly of families. The food is nothing extra-special and like my friends kept reminding me ....this is not a fine-dining restaurant. So expect the waiters to plonk a bucket of ice or platters of food on the table and walk away expecting you to serve yourself. No waiting on you hand and foot....no Sir! I was a bit taken aback by this but soon got used to it. We ordered Chilli Garlic Pork, Golden Fried Prawns and an array of chicken starters with our drinks. Then we moved on to Meifoon and Lemon chicken and Chilli Fish for the main course. My friends hated the fish and I found the meifoon tasteless. Stand-out dish of the day Lemon Chilli Chicken! Portions are good and the service is quite prompt. However, the starters were very oily and almost all of them tasted the same....red batter-fried nuggets of meat/fish. But the bill more than made up for the lack of variety :) I would probably try other places in Chinatown next time around.

Good restaurant with quality food and quantity too. Ambience was fine but a bit crowded when I visited with my family. We ordered chicken wantons, fish lut me, chilly garlic roasted duck in starter. As in main course we kept simple with mixed fried rice along with hot garlic prawn and Singapore chicken. Taste was as usual awesome. I thought prawns could have been better, but neways overall good quality food. The part that disappoints me was the serving time. It took almost 15 mins to serve our main course. That I didn't expect! We ended with fresh lime soda salt . The price of the food was very nominal.
Will definitely pay a visit next time and will try their caramel pudding. Will recommend every one to visit at least once.

Great food, the people at the adjoining table were a bit noisy though. If you're only men, you might have a problem with seating as apparently some tables are for 'family' only. Never had to face that before, but once we saw a bearer we knew, he relocated us. At the cost of reiteration, great food, ambience is nice, a must visit for people in Kolkata. Food is unpretentious, but strangely, the taste varies from visit to visit.

I have taken connoisseurs of food to Golden Joy and they have been repeats. Just do away with the staples and concentrate on the "thread Chicken, Korean Sticks, Crab Claws, Golden Fried Prawns, Hakka Chilli Shrimp,- and wash that down with some chilled beer for a satisfying and well spent Saturday evening.

The bengali signage in Golden Joy reflects the cuisine that it serves. Tangra is a cocktail of two food cultures and could ony be experinced by visiting there. Golden Joy remains my favourite in China Town, dont forget to try taste the spicy green chutney and of course darsan to sum up the meal.

Nah! I have no doubt that when it comes to food, Kolkata will always lead its way. And it will always be a clean sweep when it's Chinese! Why not? After all, Tangra is brimming with Chinese people, shaping, mastering and perfecting the true Indian-Chinese food, which probably the rest of India started to discover and modify later. I am from Kolkata, but I stay in Mumbai for 350 days a year approx. It's a feast time for the remaining 15 days in Kolkata! :)

It's a pleasure to be at Golden Joy. The food is excellent and no dishes disappointed me. Though the place is a bit shady (dimly lit and not very cozy) the food will sweep you off your feet. The Kung Pao chicken is notably good here. Like most other places in Tangra, the Indian Chinese cuisine here is genuinely superb! Do visit this place for some tasty treat!

P.S. For first-time visitors in Tangra, the lanes are quite narrow and parking can be an issue. So plan accordingly. Also, the area might appear to be dingy and not too welcoming, but please do not let that spoil your brilliant chance to try out some truly lip-smacking Indian Chinese dishes.

I and five of my friends went there and as we entered we were invited by the dim lighted cozy ambience.....for starters we ordered as usual prwan crackers which was served in large quantity and crisp....then we ordered garlic chicken , its was great with loads of garlic and onions ...then for the main course we ordered chicken Hakka chowmein ,Hunan chicken , schezwan fried rice and Singapore chicken....the Hunan chicken tasted authentic Chinese with spring onions,,, chillies ....Singaporean chicken was a bit bland and the fried rice ok types nothing to die for...Hakka chow had the taste of lot of herbs and we couldn't resist ordering more......the service is quite prompt and the prices affordable in comparison to the other restaurants in tangra.....its a must visit if a lot of friends wanna enjoy good chinese food and hangout .....

Golden Joy~~ is sheer joy bcoz of its food...taste ,quantity and ofcourse price.This is a must visit  during pujas for me with friends when all the other places will be filled will surely get a place ..thanks to the big dining halls.My recent visit  was on 19th April 2014.This was a treat from one of my cousin on a special cousin and we were 11.I suggested him this place and it didnt let me down.
We were bit dissapointed with the seating though.It could have been more comfortable,

Coming to food we had everything from pork,fish,chicken, mushroom.

In starters we had Golden fried Prawn,Red pepper chicken,chilli pork,spring baby corn(all are my favourites).The starters were as usual finger licking.

In main course we had schezwan rice ,noodles and singapore meifoon.while rice and noodles were pretty good the meifoon tatsed pretty bad and was wasted.

In sdie dishes we had Mandarin fish,chiken in oyester sauce and thai chicken.loved each of them.The fish could have been better.

Overall it was  a great experience with good food and best company around.

Thanks Golden Joy for yet another memorable dining.

So next time you are in tangra drop in for some good chinese  food.Parking is not a worry ,they have ample space.

A perfect hangout day with some college mates right out of nowhere. We were destined to be here.. We bunked college and headed to dis place.. A walk down from the chinatown gate brought us here.. It was around lunchtime.. The place was bubbling with energy.. We were a group of 4.. We ordered an entire 750ml bottle of royal stag alongside chicken in oyster sauce,chilly chicken dry and bombay chicken..the food augured well with the drinks..what else do u want!!!..cheap and sumptuous! Highly recommended!

Our visit here inadvertently turned out to be adventurous and quite exciting. It felt really good walking down the streets of Chinatown, especially the big red chinese doors on quite a few homestead. Now the place was dimly lit which for me was quite enticing. We took our time and came up with our order which was: Haka Chilli Shrimp and Pepper Chicken for starters, Mix Fried Rice, Mix Hakka Chow, Fish in Oyster Sauce and Chilli Chicken for the mains and for drinks a Red Bull for me and a Fresh Lime Soda for my friend. The Haka Chilli Shrimp was batter fried shrimps without any essence of chilis. It tasted nice though. On the other hand, the  Pepper Chicken was sort of a disappointment for me, as i have had better in other places. To be honest it tasted pretty dull.
 
The Mix Fried Rice and Mix Hakka Chow were usual fare, good in quantity and was actually prodigious compared to what our appetite could hold. Hardly anything goes wrong with the chilli chicken, it was soft, yummy and made for a good eat with the Hakka Chow. However, the fish wasn't pleasing to our palate,  especially the gravy didn't appeal to us. 

The spread was clearly more than what we both could devour, so we decided to pack the rest of our meal. The service was prompt, but what I didn't like was that they served the starters & the main within a pace of seconds, and the fact that chinese is ate good when served hot, clearly it was a disappointment for us as we were worried about the food getting cold. Apart from that it was a fair experience...

This restaurant is a recommend from Times of India group's food guide.  Must try food are Golden fried prawn,Duck roast, Korean fish sticks and dim sums. In main course try hunan chicken, dragon chicken and kung pao style gravy. Ordering half portion of each item would be more than enough for 2 persons. Service is super fast and the food get served hot and sizzling. This is a fantastic Chinese restaurant for family .fish was nice n tender,.. it was a medium spicy dish as recommended by the guy who was taking down the order..

We came here for an early dinner one night and found the restaurant quite empty and dark (we have since realised that most chinese restaurants in Tangra are dimly lit - maybe the reduced electricity bill is reflected in food price). We were ushered upstairs where we found the restaurant half full. 

Having read the reviews, we ordered the golden friend prawns as our starter. The quantity of the half serve was quite large for 2 people. The prawns were very fresh and cooked well. We found the batter a little too thick and doughy for our liking (as we prefer lighter/tempura style batter). We ordered a chicken wonton soup, however, we were served manchurian soup instead. When we brought this up with our waiter, he apologised and indicated that if we sent it back to the kitchen he would have to pay for the soup out of his wages. We felt bad for him, so stuck with the soup. The soup wasn't bad, we were just in the mood for clear soup rather than a thick soup.

We also ordered some noodles and rice - all of which was good food with quite authentic Chinese flavours (and limited adjustment for local palette). We especially liked that we were provided with chopsticks and bowls to eat from rather than plates and fork/spoon. This is the way we are used to eating Chinese food (usually plate with fork and spoon is preferred in south east asian countries such as Laos, Thailand, Cambodia).

Overall, quite good value for money (1,000 for 2 starters, 2 mains, 3 non-alcoholic drinks) and relatively authentic Chinese food.

Visited Golden Joy for dinner yesterday with my cousins. We were in the mood to catch up and just chill out over beer and starters and so that is exactly what we did. We began our meal with the usual Corn Chips and they ordered our beers. Next on the list was Lut MeChicken which was basically thinly sliced chicken pieces deep fried in a batter and tossed with scallions , chopped garlic and onions .... tasty though a tad oily went well with the beer though. Next up was the must have Golden Fried Prawn which was delicious and the dish of the day for me. The prawns were followed by Sliced  Chili Pork ( forgot to click a pic while chatting away ) which was so-so did not care much for it as found it a bit bland. Chicken Dragon Rolls followed which are sort of mini-spring rolls stuffed with chicken and veggies and wrapped up and fried.... nice enough. We liked the Prawns so much that we were tempted to order another round of Fried Prawns but finally settled for Chili Garlic Prawn which was really good. We were all stuffed by then but my cousin brother opted for Chicken Lung Fung Soup which was pretty nice. Dessert was Caramel Custard  which was terrible and highly avoidable. Overall food quality and price was decent but the service was quite terrible and they need to employ more people and train them to do the job at hand. Had it not been for the two prawn dishes which we all enjoyed I would not have rated them higher than 3 .

Golden Joy is like the 36th chamber of Shaolin. I have never seen such huge restro with big dining halls that also specialized in Chinese cuisine only. This place can accommodate more than 200 diners at a time on both the floors very easily. Even after having such huge place people get wait listed in festive season.

Interiors and decor carries an oriental theme with wooden partitions, Chinese lanterns, dragons and hand fan on wall makes it a perfect place to enjoy Chinese cuisine.

Must try food are Golden fried prawn, Chilli garlic red pepper chicken, Korean fish sticks and dim sums. In main course try hunan chicken, dragon chicken and kung pao style gravy. Ordering half portion of each item would be more than enough for 2 persons. Alcohol is much cheaper if full bottle is bought compare to individual half or full pegs.

Service is super fast and the food get served hot and sizzling. Managers and staffs are very polite they can guide you to have the right food according to your taste and preference. Parking is a bliss here, come and hand it over to the security guys they will take care of your vehicle.

This is a fantastic Chinese restaurant for family as well as couples.

Have heard a lot about this place. Wanted to try and check for self :-). 

We where group of 6 people went there for quick lunch. 

We ordered dry chicken, golden fry prawn, thai veg soup, one haka noodle. Quantity was good. Very generous. What it didn't had was taste. 

Other then golden fry prawn, everything was below average. I am sure you will find better food in your local restaurants. 

Waiter (or captian) who served us was Naievel. We requested him to bring something fast and he served us crispy dry chicken in 3 minutes! As expected it was cold, probably he served us leftover or a cancelled order. Asked him to replace it and he took all back, fried it again and brought it back to us. Disgusting. 

Another captian, Mark, took order and we asked him not to put egg in noodle as a friend of mine is allergic to egg. He smile broadly and say "sure". Once served we realized that it had egg and a lot of it. After much struggle he agreed to change just one plate and not the whole dish. 

Golden fry prawn where the only saving grace. They where good and hot. I usually don't eat prawns but still I have 4 pieces. They did tasted well. 

Ambience of this place is also very average. Neither it is traditional nor morden. Dim lit, pale interiors, no vibrant and smiling faces of staff. Not worth the effort if you have had experience of having good food at nice places.

We paid 2300/- for overall bill. So in a way it was reasonable. 

Final word, don't go with high expectations. It's a average place. More of name then any substance. 

Instead, visit Mainland China :-). 

Cheers!

on 15th feb the boscoiets had reunion thanks to my buddy joseph chen who recommended Goldeb Joy. finding the place is little foxing because its not in the same line of popular restro like beijing, lilly kitchen, kim fa and china pearl. its the road that goes straight on from the turning but once u take the road its a piece of cake finding the place. coming to the food it was lovely. the duck roast must have beeb specially made. the crispy pork, the mandarine fish with coriander and lemon wad superb. oh how can i forget the crab claws really tasty. chowmein and rice honestly i did not taste as i was so full with the snacks. but definitly i will visit it next time surely as i promised the owner mr.robert that i would return to taste some of his great chinese dishes.

Last night we went to celebrates  our 2nd anniversary at this place. We booked over phone for good table but when we enter 1st disappointment they don't about the reservation.  Anyway we found one 2 sitter table in bad place, in our back they are keeping their all cutlery so frequently disturbed us. We ordered lut me fish, bar-be-que & tangy chicken as starters all r very good. Then main course chicken hakka chow & chilli chiken with green chilli both the dish very bad. Waiters ar so so but out of them one is very rude name I think roshan  So we will not visited the place again. Before go there please keep in mind all. Because in this category so many like Big boss, Bejing, Ming garden, kimling also 
there. In my rating food 3 .staff 1. Ambience 2. Service 2.

so finally got a chance to visit this place after a long time.. didnt know the place had an a family section in the first floor so took a table at the ground itself.. ambiance was so so.. ordered for soup n starters as was in no mood for having rice or noodles.. we were shifted to the first floor as they were about to close the ground floor section.. the section above had a better ambiance... the food consisted of
veg manchow soup.. it was good and different.. for the first time i had manchow soup without soy sauce in it.. flavor was nice..
tangy crispy chicken..again the chicken was indeed tangy and had a good taste..
lat me fish.. fish was nice n tender,.. it was a medium spicy dish as recommended by the guy who was taking down the order..
hakka chilli shrimps.. this dish was a disappointment as it it was just fried shrimps with actually no flavor..

overall i enjoyed the experience at golden joy.. its surely is better than its competitor in that area.. only area of improvement would be the service which was pretty slow.. which though is good for for people going in groups who just want to kill time...

Just came back from this restro and cudnt wait to review the food of this restro situated in China Town. Went to this place after seeing the reviews and ratings in Zomato and i must say the ratings are totally worth it. The dishes we ordered here are as follows-

1. Golden Joy Special Chow-  Nice dish to blend with any kind of side dishes and it was really tasty with adequate amount for 2 people.

2. Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice- The rice was really spicy and tasted really good, tasted like smoked rice

3. Golden Joy Special Chicken - This white gravy chicken looked like some kind of soup but was really tasty and filled with pieces of Chicken.

4. Green Chilli Chicken- This dish was out of the world. Just the kind of chicken i have never tasted before. The green chilli chatni given in this dish was just making this dish too much tasty. 

If you really want to taste some nice Chinese food then this is the place you should visit...

I, with my family went for dinner today and I am so disappointed that I am not getting words to explain myself; I am not getting words to express my disappointment. I ordered fish fingers and a prawn for starter, it was more than an hour and we did not get anything on the table. I kept on inquiring and no heed. Ultimately we lost our patience, we raised our voice, then we got all the dishes much quicker. I also want to point out one thing, which I thing is a disgrace to hospitably, since I am also from hospitality I know this very well, I requested for some boiled noodles from my 2 year old daughter, first captain just ignored my request rudely and then the second agreed after a thought, but then even he did not cater to my request, I approached him again and then he got it. Thanks a ton for the favor. I can simply say I may not be the first one, there must be many, I say this because the staff simply did not care, this displayed the casual attitude. The chalta hai attitude. So let it be, chalna do.........or take it seriously, accept it and change the attitude if you can.

You may say that I am giving this place a high score for my love of Chinese food from Chinatown! I adore this place and I adore the food here. It is completely worth waiting in queue for this place. The have a huge number of chambers where you can sit and eat and yet people keep waiting and therefore you should realize that they are that good! 

I like the ambience. It may not be the classiest fine dining place but it does suffice. Once you taste the food here you need not care whether it is fine dining or not because the food is just fine. The interiors are comfortably dim and the food is outstanding.

My personal favorite is the chicken hakka noodles, the dry chilli chicken, the pepper chicken and the garlic chicken. The sweet and sour chicken is also quite nice to taste.

This is a place you can visit with friends or family and you will end up with a lovely experience.

A complete recommendation from me!!!

This restaurant is one of the finest in the Chinatown(Tangra) area. Its excellent when it comes to the ambiance and the service.

The prices are worth the quality.

However, the taxes on the drinks and alcohol is sure to leave a hole in your pocket.

Moreover, the distant location of this place makes the usage of public transport quite difficult. 

Recommended if you are dining out in large groups.

Always make sure you go there in a car or a cab.

One of my favorites in Tangra. seafood lovers- this is the place to go in kolkata.

This is a great place and has consistent food whenever you go.

The Service is great and the ambience also quite upscale as compared to other restaurants in Tangra.

Must order: Chili Crab, Steam Fish in black bean sauce, Steam Prawns and Crab Claws, Stir Fried Chilli Garlic Prawn and the Steamed Wantons with pakchoy.

It has recently become the hotspot in chinatown.All the credit goes to the food here.
There is barely a bad item on the menu.
From soups, my favorite being the thai soup to the starters, the dry chilli chicken to the drums of heaven...
The most famous item here are the crab claws...
The main course is delightful from the cantonese chowmein to the chopsuey....
The only let down is the consistency of the food when its heavily crowded..

Golden Joy was my choice of destination for my first journey into China town. Firstly, I must mention that it almost felt like an adventure finding this place....being a first timer. And what a find it was ! The place looked inviting....dimly lit like most Chinese places but very comfortable indeed. For starters we ordered the Haka Chilli Shrimp and Pepper Chicken. The Shrimp dish consisted of batter fried shrimps laid on a bed of chillies....Tasted nice but there was no hint of chilli in the shrimp itself. The Chicken starter tasted strictly okay.....a good snack but nothing more.

For main course our choices were Mix Fried Rice, Mix Hakka Chow, Fish in Oyster Sauce and Chilli Chicken. Both the Rice and the Chow were huge in quantity (as expected) and tasted really good. The Chilli Chicken was yummy and made for a great combination with the Hakka Chow. The Fish however didn't appeal to us much and I found the gravy to be nothing special. We had also ordered a Fresh Lime Soda for me and a Red Bull for my friend.....which he enjoyed !

We had clearly over ordered for the two of us and in the end had to pack away a lot of it. We were probably excited by the huge variety on the menu and got swept away ! :) One complaint  that I do have with this and many other such places is that they served all the starters and main course all together ! So while we eat one thing, the other goes cold. Wish they would look into this matter. Otherwise, we had a good meal....looking forward to discovering China Town now ! 3.5 stars from me.

Located in the east of the city, in Tangra and Topsia, Kolkata’s Chinatown boasts on a number of Chinese restaurants and tanneries. Chinese restaurants offers mind boggling variety of Chinese cuisine. The eateries serving the “hakka” style Chinese food suitably adapted for Bengali palate are choc a bloc on most weekends and holidays.
I would say there are lot many options in China Town and Golden Joy is one of the good choice. Large portions and spicy Kolkata Chinese fare welcomes you at Golden Joy. 

Elaborate eatery at Golden Joy restaurant can space out 200-250 diners at any time in its large 5-6 dining halls situated in two of its floors and for this reason one can easily get a place without waiting. Waiters service, confirm reservations, valet parking, take away, alcohol / bar & spicy kolkata Chinese fare has made golden joy a fairly popular place. 
The décor is quite simple , with wood paneling & comfortable seatings in sofas & chairs with ordinary tables. There are televisions & sound systems in the end of each of the dining room which play eventful programmes & music. Alcohol is served in both half & full pegs as well as bottles of all sizes. (I must mention one thing for those who do not know the fact that you can have whole bottle of liquor which may slash the cost a lot. So you can enjoy your drink there at much cheaper cost. )

We were in a group of 4 and our orders were - 
Hot & sour soup (small serving for one of us) ;
Tangy crispy chicken &
Green pepper chicken (half plates each) ;
Thai chicken fried rice
Sichuan chicken chow
Chicken in oyster sauce (half plate)
And a pyte of benders pride

The tangy crispy chicken was simply awesome – an instant hit & went too well accompanying our pegs. Green pepper chicken on the other hand was not that impressive.
The best dish of the day was the Sichuan chow – it was marvelous, don’t give it a miss if you are in . Thai rice was also good, but the oyster sauce was again pretty bland.
The half plates were very nicely portioned for 3-4 person, and the rates have gone up …much greater than those mentioned in zomato.

But for a group treat & cheaper booze, I prefer golden joy over all other restros of china town. The bill for 4 of us was about 2000 /- which was reasonable enough.

Loved golden joy ! 4 out of 5 from my side for golden joy :)

Aged 11 years, I have been visiting this place from its inception. The warmth and friendliness of the staff has remained intact over the years and they remember faces like no one else can. I have always visited Golden Joy with my family, brother-in-law who swears by it and cousins. It has  been the first choice amongst us because of its casual vibes which ensure a cozy, fun evening. 
Last evening we had met up at South City for a movie and wanted to dine out. We yet again zeroed on Golden Joy and went all the way to satisfy our souls. Our orders - prawn chips, golden fried prawns, fried chicken, mixed hakka noodles, hunan chicken and sweet sour chicken. We were eight of us with three young children and kept ourselves from ordering the schezwan and pepper options. China town in general and prawn chips are a sinful combination, the sip of a beer over crunchy prawn chips is a tried and tested will-never-go-wrong combination. The golden fried prawns are indulgent and I love having it with the extremely hot green chilli chutney and chilli sauce. The fried chicken is accompanied by what we Bengalis called jhurhjure alu bhaja, and a lot of it. 
The simple hakka noodles is the best one can ask for and goes very well with any order by the side. Something that one should not bother about here is the quantity of food. It is immense for the price quoted and I have never faced a compromise in quality either. Golden Joy is a lovely family dining place where kids can be themselves and run about, poison lovers can sip their drinks generously and foodies can gorge and slurp on their tit bits.

When in Kolkata how can you not go to China Town. My colleagues took me there to Golden Joy. China Town had been populated by Hakka Chinese 200 years back or so they say. Started leather tanneries and when they went kaput....converted the tanneries to authentic Chinese hakka restaurants. Try the crab claws. This was a first for me and they tasted good. Very subtle and went well with Old Monk and soda. We tried the chilly chicken also good and the chowmein. The taste is distinctly different from the run of the mill chinjabi cusine we get in Delhi restaurants.
The bill came to 4000 buck for 8 pax and it was very cheap by any standards.

One of the most amazing eating out places for me will be Golden Joy.. The thread chicken!!! HEAVENLY. . I can just eat a full plate of that. There are certain dishes which always stand out. Dry chilly chicken is also a must have. And thai soup.  As for the main course, go for anything you wish cause it's okay ish. The place has no certain "ooph-market ambience". It's alright. And yeah make sure you go on a normal day of the weak. Not festivals or something because then you are sure to come back disappointed !

B'day lunch today with my guy took place in this restaurant.
we went there because of the recommendations of course.
i was partially happy n partially not satisfied due to some factors!

PROS :
1.good ambience
2.good food quality
3.quantity was enough for two people with one plate rice/noodles
4.very good behaviour by the maître d'

CONS :
1.they could use some more light, as the place was so dimly lit that it was hard to look at the food and find out the right color.
2.the waiters looked as if they were slapped across the face and that made them angry..coz they looked rude all the time.
3.you can expect a little confusion over your orders. we ordered chicken fried rice and they put loads n loads of prawns in it..god knows why! (yes i am a little allergic to prawns -_- )


apart from all these..you will enjoy your food because they taste good and decent enough!

Best Chinese Cuisine I’ve had in a long long time – 4.5/5

This was one of the best Dining Out experiences we've had in recent times. Our relatives from US were visiting us during the Durga Pujas after almost 7 years and keeping in mind their craving for the Oriental Cuisine, we'd thought of treating them at some "GOOD" joint in Tangra. As always, the initial step was to go through the reviews of the various restaurants in Zomato to Zero in on the most suitable resturant. After a lot of research and discussion, we finally zeroed in on Golden Joy and we are really happy that we did. So, the Zomato reviewers definitely deserve a big round of applause for helping us choose the perfect restaurant.

I'd made the reservation by phone and when we reached, we were straight away shown to our table, albeit being early by almost 20 minutes. (Our guests were yet to arrive). we place the order as follows:

a. Chicken Man Chow Soup, Chicken Tom Yum Soup & Chicken Sweet Corn Soup (for the kids) 
b. Golden Fried Fish & Full Chicken Barbeque – Simply breathtaking and awesome. Haven’t had such good Golden Fried Fish in a long long time and the best part is they use authentic Bekti and not the Basa fish which so many other restaurants use. The Bar-B-Q Chicken was out of this world with the perfect amount of Barbecue sauce (in most cases, the quantity is either on the higher side or on the lower side).
c. Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice – Simply mouthwatering and lip – smacking.
d. Hunan Prawn and Chicken in Black Bean Sauce – we were surprised to see that they provided Jumbo Prawns because the other restaurants – who provide Jumbo Prawns – charge almost double for a plate. The taste was also wonderfully delightful. The chicken was the perfect Tangra Chilli Chicken.

To sum it all up, I can only say that our hour and a half long love affair with Golden Joy was a tremendous success and we were all happy and satisfied at the end of it all.

Golden Joy - Situated in Tangra also known as China Town :) which has more than 25 Chinese restaurants (guessing). Golden Joy stands tall and far superior both in terms of Food & Ambiance. Their special menu demands an appreciation which has many brilliant dishes which no other joints have. Golden Joy has a huge space so you do not feel cramped up and they keep improving their interiors all the time as well. They also have a Karaoke set for you to enjoy singing with your friends ans family.
Some of the food you just cant afford to miss: Thai soup, Thread fish/chicken, Chilly chicken haka dry, Golden fried prawns oh my god I cant write anymore I am feeling so hungry now.

To sum it up or in short: You will always and always be fully satisfied with the taste of the food. Go Fot It :)

The service is super terrible! The only restaurant at Tangra with such horrible waiters...seems like some management problem exist! The waiters just slams the food, they are rude, they pass unfavourable comments and shows nil respect to customers. The quality of food has been deteriorated over the months! Still would rate Beijing and KimLing a class above to this shit place. The place maybe cheap but the attitude of the staff is also cheap and also the crowd. It is not a safe and respectful place to visit with family.

I ws super hungry so we ordered red pepper chili garlic prawns, chicken n fish finger for starters. n prawn chips to bite on until the food arrived. prawn chips served to us tasted like its been fried in fish oil so tasted foul..its nt like m havin it fr the first tym hre, we've alwys eaten goldwn joys prawns chips n loved it bt not nemre..
the bad food journey dsnt end hre, nxt wqiter came wid sme chickn preparation n jat slamed it on d table n lefy widout sayin nethn n widout serving it out on our plates n guess wat it ws nt way v ordered..dey thn changed it m gt Us wat v ordered bt it ws prepared badly n at this point I gt very angry n tld d waiter to cancel rest of our order n call ur manager.. we waited n waited bt nobody came to tlk oe apologise so dats whn v jst walked off the restaurant..if you dont show respect n concern for ur customer then its nt worth bein in resturant business!!!
As we wre waitin fr our car to come the owner came to talk,he cud hv talkd wid Us while we were at d restaurant n nt like dis on the road..

I think all of us would agree on one thing - dining out today is not only about food. It is a combination of good food, nice ambiance and courteous service. I was hugely disappointed with the last point, and its huge enough to spoil an evening for you. The waiters were rude and I'm being polite when I say this. The place was not full either, so you can't really point at that for indifferent and shabby behavior. In any case, there can never be a reason for shabby behavior, especially when you are in the service industry. As it turned out, we had some starters and scooted off. The golden fried prawn, tangy crispy chicken and one fish starter(I don't remember the name, the fish was stale and we finished it with much difficulty) was what we ordered.The service size is huge, so thats a plus. The food,umm,inconsistent. As mentioned, the fish was definitely stale. The other two were good though.

Never mind,the horrible service can't be made up with anything else.Hence, the rating. Not going back in near future, for sure.

Went there during the durga pujas, a big mistake, had to wait for an hour to get a seat. The place was packed to the brim. We had ordered fish in chilli garlic sauce, canton mixed noodles, spring fried chicken and mixed fried rice. The food was superb and true value for money, it was well worth the wait. Will visit it again soon.

There are two parts to Golden Joy. The food is the first part and the service is the second. If you are talking about the food, Golden Joy deserves at least a 4.5/5 because of the quantity as well as quality of food. Their golden fried prawns are truly addictive and incredibly tasty, not to mention the barbecue chicken, the golden fried fish, and my favorite - the red pepper fried chicken. In the main course department, my eyes wander towards the simple chicken chowmien, which they make quite perfect for my taste. I also adore their version of the fish in hot garlic sauce. Absolutely mouthwatering and value for money.

Now comes the second part - service. Here, I would not be able to give more than 3/5 simply because the service is very inconsistent, especially when its crowded, which is the case on most evenings. I personally have been the recipient of very mixed service here, a reason why I generally avoid this place during those days when its crowded. But the booze is quite reasonably priced (as per Chinatown rates go, this is great!) and you can always smoke outside.

This is the first time I visited any restaurant in Tangra, selected Golden Joy for the high rating.

I am not sure if it was my luck or that's what can be expected from restaurant in Tangra, but the entire experience was a big nightmare. 

The restaurant was pretty crowded and would not suggest it to anyone who would like a quiet place to enjoy their meal. Had to wait for at least 10 minutes before someone could come to the table. the funny part is this restaurant still functions in the age old way, some guys in black suits will only take your order and would not even go back to the kitchen to check on the order. 

Ordered steamed momos and drumsticks for starters. the drumsticks were pretty fast, but there were no sign of the momos. Its been half and hour and while we could see a few plates of momos being served on other table there was no signs of our's. To ease my desperation my wife cracked a joke, maybe the chicken was missing in action rather than killed in action. Well it did the trick and I ordered the main course. Second big mistake-----ordered chicken in black bean sauce.

After a few rounds of heated discussions with the ordertaker and 40 minutes of waiting , the momos were still missing in action.

After 50 minutes the ordertaker kind of pretended as if we were invisible.

After almost 70 minutes we decided to call it a day and were about to pay for the one starter we ordered when some fellow brought us the fried rice and the chicken in black bean sauce.....which by the way took almost 50 minutes.  Half way through main course surprise! surprise! the momo was served. The server gave a sly smile and said its authentic Chinese dish and thus took "little time". You gotta be kidding me right starters after service of main course. On asking why the  chicken black bean took time----got the same reply. I wonder what he meant by authentic. 

None the less the only consolation was the price being extremely moderate and the quality of the food being quite good. 

What I could only infer that the restaurant gives preferential treatment and banks on repeat customer and tries to keep them  happy at all costs. Or as I said it might be my off day at having a good meal experience. 

Food:      4.5/5
Service: .1/5
Value :    3/5

For me China TOwn is Golden Joy. with a huge place to sit and relax and a huge menu with a good variety this place is all thumbs up for me. the booze is cheap and the food taste is excellent. i have had the oppurtunity to see their ktchen and i must say it is very clean. all in all i have been to this place more times than i can count not just cause it is on the cheaper side. but because the food is authentic and keeps you wanting more. 

the place is a little noisy when it is full but then it is not too much of a botheration to the kitchen as the food is served fast and upto mark everytime.

One of the better places in Tangra that has still maintained their quality standards. We were a bit taken aback they did not have pork on their menu but were happy when told they serve it nevertheless.The sweet and gingery Mapo pork especially was a winner, we were also pleased with their pork stewed rice (a personal favorite), golden fried prawns, chilly pork, assortments of fried rice and noodles that followed. They forgot to season the seafood soup but we didn't bother with that, given that the rest of the stuff was lipsmacking good. Biggest plus point is the fact that they have comfortable parking within the premises, something hard to find in Tangra.

Well, chinatown never lets you down...! 2nd visit to golden joy! If u dont intend to dig a hole by visiting beijing or big boss, then golden joy is the place to be...! Excellent ambience, liquor at reasonable rates, pretty authentic chinese...! The best part is that while many chinatown joints are shifting towards a more indian sort of chinese cuisine by making the food oily, this one has kept it nice and dry...! Overall, an excellent place for a group dinner...!

Location (Rating - 1):
The location is a bit hard to find but once you find the place...its a delight. The restaurant has a large parking space and so parking has never been a problem...just be on the lookout for open man holes.

Ambiance (Rating - 3):
A moderate ambiance in which dining feels good, not bad, not very exotic, but good.

Service (Rating - 2):
The service okay. Well no offence but the waiters, specially the steward thought he was Jackie Chan or something. He wasn't rude or anything but not very polite either.

Food (Rating - 5):
The best thing about Golden Joy is the food...yummy...!!!...Whatever you order tastes like heaven and authentic chinese. All the deficiencies of Golden Joy gets covered with the food they serve. I wanted to personally thank the chef but he was busy...well my bad luck...!!!

Price (Rating - 5):
The price of the dishes are very nominal and doesn't burn a hole and the quantity of the food...if you order 1 plate of any dish, be sure you are not alone.

In my opinion the best restaurant in Tangra. The chilli garlic red pepper chicken and steamed fish/prawns are absolutely awesome. 
The most visited restaurant by my family in Tangra.

Visited Golden joy a couple of times recently. Somehow this place is not as good as it used to be. The prices have shot up, the quality of golden fried prawns are not that great anymore. Still it is a good place for huge group outings. Revising the rating to 4


I was first introduced to this place around 3 years back by a colleague on a festive occasion. Since then, have visited this place for lunch/dinner at least 20-25 times if not more ! 

This fabulous Chinese joint is located in one of the by lanes of Tangra (China Town). People who are coming from Park circus should enter from the lane bang opposite to the Mercedes showroom, continue straight for about 250 meters and take the first right, follow the meandering lane and again right.

The restaurant is two storied with ample parking space (valet parking is available). The ground floor is usually for the stags and the 1st floor for family diners. 
Ambiance : The ambiance is neat with red dominating the interiors.  The tables are well placed and do not feel cramped. Nothing to complain about.

The Food : This is the best part. I feel Golden Joy offers the best value for money food. Servings are very much satisfactory for the price. Half plate consists of 7 pieces and large consists of 14, be it chicken, fish or prawns. Whenever I visit this place, I make it a point to have a prawn item, especially the Golden Fried Prawns. Pure bliss :D 
The Bar B Q chicken is another dish I love. One thing I do not like about the restaurant is the fish preparation. I have tried fish items thrice here and every time the fish had a weird smell and was disappointing. 
For main course the mixed noodles is a sure shot winner. You can order anything from the menu without thinking twice.
Booze is very reasonably priced. There is an option of ordering the whole bottle for a premium which is again quite reasonably priced. 

The service: Service is generally prompt even during peak hours which is a delight. I would suggest reaching the place before 7.30 pm on weekends and before 9 on weekdays as it is a preferred dining destination in China Town.

Final Verdict: I simply love this place and I feel it is a perfect combination of great food, reasonable pricing and decent family ambiance which is big group friendly. A meal for two along with drinks should not cost more than 1000 + tax, which is great value for money.Totally deserves a 4.5 :D

Very tastefully cooked oriental food.Flavours are very vibrant yet not very overpowering..
The staff was very friendly and suggestions too were very well made.
Very surprised to find valet parking here hence parking is not an issue(can't say on weekends when it's overtly crowded)
My only complaint would be that even on a normal day this place can get really noisy and may not be ideal for a quiet dinner but at these prices and such food I really wouldn't mind.
Overall a wonderful evening spent in company of family.
Definitely going back and highly recommended for good oriental dining!

This joint is surely a dark horse amongst all the joints at Tangra (China Town of Kolkata).But this place surely holds  its own among the more popular places like Beijing, Kim Ling,Big Boss etc.It has two sections.The one on the ground floor is spartan and meant  for stags.The family section is on the first floor.As far as the ambiance and decor is concerned, i can comment only on the ground floor section.The day i visited this place, it was choc a bloc in spite of being a weekday during lunch hours. Waiters were impatient and rude.Service was slow.Had to wait for quite some time before we were handed over menu cards.

Now coming on to the food.I had items like golden fish(highly recommended) boneless slices of fish golden brown fried in batter,american chopsuey-a slightly sweet non-spicy dish,bar- b- q chicken-excellent dry dish comprising of soft and juicy pieces of chicken,chicken stew rice- a nice bland health food,sweet and sour prawn-decent enough, chilli garlic red pepper chicken was a fiery dish and after having a few morsels we were on fire-literally!!!.Please avoid if you are not into spicy food.Lastly we had the chocolate ice cream to douse the fire:)
Now a few points as far as dining out in Tangra is concerned-This joint is difficult to locate since it is not on the main road and is inside a narrow by lane.If one is in a group of 2-3 people then ordering half-plates would suffice.Though i would remind people by saying that this place has  cut down on the quantity from 10-12 pieces of meat/fish to 7-8 pieces  for half plate.Full plate would be adequate for 4-5 people.As is typical of Tangra, booze is dirt cheap, a large peg of plain Smirnoff Vodka costs Rs 140.Options for buying a bottle-any size or carrying your own booze is allowed.There is no smoking zone.Depending on public transport to visit the joint especially in the evenings might prove to be risky.If you have women accompanying you then dinner is ruled out,try Tangra only for lunch.
To summarize Tangra still remains a hot favourite place for tipplers who want to drink silly along with good food.

The first thing remarkable about this place is the price. It's very reasonable. The quantity of food served is also sufficient. The main problem of this place, according to me, is the ambiance and the fact that it is almost always crowded to the full. An honorable mention is to be made to the baby corn, which way simply out of this world. Be ready to get disappointed by the quality of the service though, it's lousy. But it is worth visiting atleast once.

Certainly one of the cheapest Chinese restaurants in town serving brilliant food. The ambiance is pretty average though. The food tasted excellent. The tangy crispy chicken deserves special mention for being really top grade. Service however was very average and nothing praiseworthy but I guess that was because of the huge crowd present that day. The other thing is that they offer huge amounts just like any other restaurants in China Town. So be a bit careful before ordering and try to order in rounds

1.Great food
2.Doesn't make you feel wasted in money after your meal

We walked upstairs to the Family Room and proceeded to order several rounds of starters along with our drinks.

Schezwan battered shrimp, prawn in oyster sauce, fried chicken, chilli fish and the best of all the steamed fish with chili garlic ginger on top. 

The beers came quickly and kept coming. The waiter was friendly and cheeky.

A good time was had by all.

Have been there a hundred times and been satisfied always. The first place that comes to our mind when we want to have chinese. Excellent food. Good quality and very good service. But a long waiting queue on Sundays. So if you are thinking about Sundays then go a bit early at or before 8 . Order the starters and the soups and fill your tummy and you wont be disappointed . DONT MISS THE GOLDEN FRIED FISH.

The food here is just too good, service sometimes is a bit slow. One should try the Honey chicken, chicken with veg, chicken in oyster sauce, and try the caramel custard for dessert, its really yummy.Also we tried the Golden Joy special Cantonese chow and Golden Joy special chicken, its really worth to order for.After having visited most of the Chinese restaurants and tasted Honey Chicken (which is off course our favorite) we came to the conclusion that Golden Joy's honey chicken is one of the best, simply one cannot avoid.

this is quite the place... not too difficult to find really, just inside the lane which also has china haus, another brilliant restaurant...
it's a great place to host a treat really, as the booze is free-flowing and they're usually well-stocked, and the food goes really well with it... 
it's not a terrible idea to stock up on the starters - only it might end up costing you a lot more... do try the chilly garlic red pepper fish - it's to die for... the schezwan pepper prawn goes well with a brew as well... their specials like the woolly chicken and lut me chicken are also worth a shot...
for the mains, their assortment of rice and noodles is quite similar to what one gets at the other places in chinatown... however, their hoi sin chicken is an absolute hit... service is polite, and quite quick as well... the ambience is really nice for a small get-together... and the prices are not exorbitant... i look forward to returning there soon... :)

Though China Town has always been famous for cheap liquor,this restaurant has a separate family section on the first floor,and serves authentic Chinese cuisine at very reasonable rates!
Located in a small lane in Tangra,this restaurant is one of the most frequent places i go with family! Their tangy crisp chicken is an amazing starter which goes really well with mixed meifoon. You can also try the fish manchurian and Wooly chicken! One of the finest dining restaurants in China Town! Must try!

FOOD THAT IS JOYOUS AS WELL AS GOLDEN

Among the many Chinese restaurants in Tangra Golden Joy is a must visit. Because of its location- it is not situated like the other restaurants in Tangra in a linear manner and is located in a narrow lane- one might fail to spot it at first.  Even then, over the years it has built up a loyal clientele of foodies. Like its name the 'joy' is definitely of a ' golden' kind. Where food is concerned it is a value for your money kind of restaurant. The feeling of Chineseness is not only limited to the cuisine but is there in the decor created by hangings on the walls, the colour red of the walls and the dimly lit light. The food prices are not exorbitant. Though ordering alcohols from here will definitely burn a deep hole in your pocket. The food on offer is not only delicious but the quantity served won't disappoint you.

If money is not a problem, all the food items on offer are worth sampling. Begin the food journey with starters like Prawn Fried Wantons or Chicken Fried ones and hear the sound of crunch as you bite into the wanton skin. For soup lovers you can take your pick from the usual Chicken Sweet Corn Soup to the more exotic and expensive Asparagus Soup. Like in the menu of any restaurant , there is the usual offering of rice and noodle dishes , but the tender and juicy meat dishes is what make Golden Joy a must return  . The portions of meat served are not comparable to any other Chinese restaurant in Tangra. Again the meat dishes that are fried still retain their softness and juiciness. A great dining-in experience wouldn't be complete without the ever helpful staff of the restaurant. All in all for a well-spent time and money Golden Joy it should be.

I think I am one of the few people who will be saying that I was not happy with service or the food for that matter. The service was one of the worst I have ever come across - maybe because it was a Saturday evening - but v had to remind the waiter to get us water at least 4 times before he finally got it. They served us the noodles before and after some 20 mins v were served the side dish - needless to say that the noodles was cold by then. 
It was the first time I went to this restaurant ( I'm a regular at kimling) and I don't think I will ever go this place again or recommend it to anyone.

The price is fair and the ambiance is great. Helps your mood uplift in every possible way. A deserved 4.5 !

Yes I love this place undoubtedly......everything here impresses you starting from quality, taste, quantity to price. Though I personally don't like the location due to narrow lanes and parking problems, it doesn't stop me from going there. Each an every item here is worthy of being tried and appreciated. The ambience is also quite nice although its nothing great or unbelievable. The prices are very affordable and supports people of various financial backgrounds. 
The staff out here are quite ok and helpful. So I would recommend everyone to try the food or else you will seriously miss out on delicious, lip smacking food
So rating it 4 should be fair enough.

Would have gone there many more times had it been closer to my place.Try out the Thai soup and pepper fish andor dragon fish.... they are simply awesome, though you cant name just one or two dish as I had a lot of different items in their menu and all of them beats the rest. Staff is just too good and so is the ambiance. In one simple word just "Yummy......"

A good boy type answer may be to taste authentic chinese dishes.
Ya ofcourse but some like me dont go there only to taste chinese but to booze at a large :-P
Yes, chinatown is my favourite destiny when i want to cross my limit. Golden joy is my 2nd favourite restaurant in chinatown(1st is beijing).
The ambiance is good and it serves great quality of food in a very reasonable price. The staffs behave very well.
Drinks are i will say cheaper then other restaurants in china town. The juicy dishes of fish, chicken and prawn mainly attract me.

Today went to this restaurant, this is my first visit to chinatown so didnt know what to expect.. reached there at 8 pm and went to the upper stairs at the family section, it was almost totally filled, luckly 2 table were available and we got one,waiter asked whether we were happy to get the table,we were happy as we didnt have to wail outside!! ordered mixed fried rice, hot garlic prawns, chilli fish and salt pepper chicken..little surprised to see there is no pork & lamb items in the menu as i thought every restaurant at chinatown serves pork!! guess i was wrong!! we had to wait 35 mins for the food to arrive, may be due to too much crowd. ambience was so-so, too much chattering going on all around, this may cause some disturbance.. food was very good. half plate of chicken/fish/prawn items consists of 7 pieces and full plate has 12 pieces.. prawn was very juicy, tender and fresh, chicken was soft and good, fish item was avg, rice was good and huge in amount. cost for 3 was around 1000/-..  my first outing at chinatown was very satisfactory hope to visit there again in future..

Another eatery which is situated in a very odd place. This is my second favourite place in Tangra for having chinese. Food is delectable,quantity is overwhelming and pricing is moderate but if you have a lot of food then expenses are obviously heavy. Staffs are well-mannered and some staffs are informative while the others are not. They serve food timely if told,or else they take a lot of time. Sitting arrangement is fine and i like the aquarium filled with various fishes. There is also a banquet hall and whenever i go there seats are available most of the time, if not i go to  Beijing. My favourite food here is the chicken and juicy prawn preparations. Soups are also fantastic here and desserts are tasty food(ice creams specially).Folks,u can try  having food here. I would rate 4 stars,cause it deserves.

It was delicious, crispy and extremely mouth watering. Loved Chicken Wanton too. Not only the food but even the ambience rocks. The decor of the restaurant has a positive appeal which makes it even more special.

This is one of the moderately priced place yet stylish and decent in its own way. Unlike most of the restros in Tangra famously known as the 'China Town' this place has a good ambience to hang out with friends and family and spend rather reasonably. The 'prawn chips' was a great choice as we enjoyed two buckets of the same. Also we had crispy chicken and prawn which were also great. The main course was below average and after the tasty starters was a horrible thing to happen. The bottle of drink costs you just the double of the MRP. But found the seal of the bottle already broken which hinted us of you know what. Overall, minus the main course, it was a good outing.

I went there with my boyfriend.  
The food is tasty, deliciously cooked, even the waiters there helped us to select from the menu. 
The service is good and prompt. 
We ordered for Golden Fried Prawns which is cooked with to perfection, retaining the juiciness of the prawns. 
The portions were huge; we just ordered half a plate (Rs.180) as the waiter suggested that it would be enough for two. We loved it. 
Next we ordered Mixed Fried Rice (Rs.110), Lemon Chilly Chicken (half plate; as per the suggestion of the waiter) and soft drinks (Rs.25). The total bill was around Rs.520 including taxes. 
It was a nice experience overall.

it is definitely  not cheap  as some reviews suggest ,  but tolerable enough  ...  also food  quantity  is  NOT a LOT as some people  may suggest  ,  but definitely  this  place is better  then most  other chinese restaurants  in tangra  .   BUT  i would suggest to go with family as the stag section  is not that great...coming to  the  food  & service .....  SERVICE  IS QUICK  in the family section only BUT  in  the stag section  ....  service is very poor...  But food is great  ...  i went with a couple of friends of mine & we ordered  kungpao fish with  cashewnut  ( rs 230 ) lut me fish  ( rs 220 )  salt  & pepper fish  ( Rs  220  ) chilli garlic red  pepper fish ( rs  220 )  ,  Mixed cantonese  chow  (  rs 130 ) & Hot  garlic  fish   ( rs  220  ) & we finished it all  ....  the three of us without any trouble ....  so  that means  that the QUANTITY  is  LESS ....  coming to drinks ....  again drinks is  NOT  cheap , not even  bottle system is cheap a  750 Ml bottle of VAT-69 here would cost  you rs  2100,  whereas  the market or retail price of VAT-69 for a 750  ml bottle is Rs  1200.....  so NOT cheap  is my verdict but  yes for family outing in tangra  .....  do visit golden joy

Golden joy is right at the heart of tangra. It’s a big spacious restaurant with parking space of its own. Food is awesome here. Definitely try dry chilli fish and prawn chips. The mafoon (rice noodles) are thin and very tasty. I went with my colleagues for a informal party. Service is very good and polite. They can really handle big crowd with gusto.
