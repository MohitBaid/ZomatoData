Situated in the bowbazar area. One of the oldest sweet shop in the city. They are famous for their specialty in making Sandesh. But if you ever come down then do try their mihi dana, mango doi (summer special), sita bhog, rasgulla, ice cream sandesh and the kora paker sandesh.

On recommendation of my friends, i got the sandesh from here. Located in the narrow and busy Lanes, it can be quite disappointing in looks, but the desserts are just amazing. 

I had the gur sandesh and jal bhara sandesh - just heavenly! So soft that they melt in your mouth. A tad sweeter for my taste but definitely 4 üåü!

Situated near the tanishq showroom at bowbajaar this is a Bengali sweet seller of great repute.. Today i bought their famous jolbhora., Strawberry sandesh, gaja, and ice cream sandesh.. The sweets were mildly sweet.. Thus pleasing our palate.. The jolbhora was my fav.. I liked the gaja also very much for its lightness. It was not dense as is usual in most sweet shops.. Tried the ice cream sandesh which was cold and very tasty.. So was the pink strawberry sandesh. Forgot to mention the chocolate sandesh... It was equaaly tasty.. Sab ek se barkar ek... Cant pick one.

Having read some rave reviews about this place, I coincidentally walked into it. With such a huge variety of sweets, I was pretty confident that I would miss the best ones. So I asked the server to recommend me something good and he came up with "everything is good here" and proceeded to pack some 5-6 types of sandesh for me. He wasn't exaggerating. It was the best freakin sandesh, I had in my whole life. The butterscotch sandesh and a few others whose name I didn't ask then, were just too perfect.

Bengali sweets are doubtlessly the best sweets in the world and Bengal has had a properous ¬†history in this field and as time went by they continued adding new sweets. Bhim Chandra Nag is one of them . Most sweets here were just outstanding but the Butter Scothch sandesh and Abarkhabo sandesh stole my attention. The shop has a very stable customer base and they don‚Äôt compromise with quality. ¬†The customers are attracted by their lip-smacking servings like the fresh Rosogollas, Rose sandesh, Malai Sandesh and the Bengal special sandesh.

Many of my friends inquire that while I give long or standard reviews for all kinds of eateries, with exception of the ones which I have an indistinctly hate, why is it seen that for sweet shops I give such short reviews and without explaining much in details. Indeed there is a query for many. The point what stands that, since I am not a much lover of sweets, I generally do not try to find out the unique sweet names apart from the generic identification, like, Rasogolla, Sandesh, Gulab Jamun, etc. Due to this particular fact, I tend to describe less about the taste too, as, being a person who keeps distance from sweets tend to be more critical in reviewing than actually he should be. And, thus, I prefer to write less trying to be "neutral" in my approach.

I remember visiting this eatery with my uncle and he is known to prefer sweets from this place. My uncle is such a person who prefer quality over anything and this is the reason we travelled across 1.5 km along the extremely busy Nirmal Chandra Avenue & Chittaranjan Avenue to buy from this confectionery.

We ordered two kinds of sweets and packed it for home. The staffs were friendly as well as polite always bearing a smile in their face.

On returning home, I was made to try both kinds of sweets and I liked one of them. Both were sandesh with varied taste and design. One was little bit sugary while the other one was less and thus I liked the latter over the former.

A visit is advised!

The sweets of North Kolkata has a long history and these heritage stores like Bhim Chandra Nag is a prominent part of it. Bhim Chanda Nag is one of the oldest sweets seller in this area. Their sweets just the brilliant. I have been here a number of times tasted almost all of their sweets and I can't mention to you specifically which one is better because they all are very very good. Just pick up any one of your liking and you will love it more. Prices are reasonable if you consider thier golden heritage and of course the quality.

"Legendary", that's what people call this place, and after my visit I now know why they call it so. The sweets, mouth watering and made to absolute perfection. The sweets are definitely a class apart just because of their quality and presentation. The "Rose Sandesh" with a rose petal on top is a must try, the sweet has the odor of rose, and smells way better than anything else. Their Rosogollas are also a class apart. I also bought some Laddoos home, they were also very good. The pricing is totally okay for the quality of sweets they serve. The service is also commendable, keep up the good work.

This is a legendary place which started it's journey in early 19th century. A traditional North Kolkata sweet shop, there's not much to talk about ambiance, a big showcase and some wooden chairs. Don't miss the antique customised watch by Cooke and Kelvey.

It was my first visit and I tried with their Nolen Gurer sandesh which is available during winters, I never had such soft and amazingly flavoured sandesh. If in Kolkata you just can't afford to miss it if you want to experience the authentic Bengali sweets. They are known for their sandesh(cottage cheese sweet).

Recommended: Manohora sandesh, and other cottage cheese sweets.

Bhim Nag is one of those legendary shops in central calcutta. If you want those pure, lip smacking, heart melting sandesh, you've got to be here. But, the downside is their price. The sandesh that your heart will crave for will pinch your pocket by about 25 bucks. But i guess its worth it for the quality they give.

Bhim nag creates one of the best sweets. Their speciality is Mihi Dana, Mango curd during summers, Chamcham, Bode, and all kind of sandesh. But the demerit is rasgolla they are way too sweet. Ones suffering from sugar must avoid sweets from bhim nag it's much not advisable...other than that everyone must at least once visit during Durga Puja this outlet brings up with more varities.

The sweets are good but the staffers and owner ain't! ¬†The owner wears a snobbish look ¬†and hardly engages with customers. On one occasion I got 200 gms of "chanar polau". The "bill" came to Rs. 56/-. ¬†The owner insisted I pay 6 rupees change. ¬†He wouldn't take Rs. 5/- (which was the all change I had). Finally I had to get 50 gms more to get the "bill" rounded to Rs. 70/- for Mr. Nag's convenience! Some people ....

Bhim Nag the name says it all. I don't think I should go for an introduction neither for a quality check about this place. An old classic place of our city of Joy and still carrying the legacy along.¬†

##Location: Bow bazar area.

##Experience: Well I have had their sweets quite a number of times and never quite got a chance to get it myself but this was my first experience at their outlet. An old school big sized outlet which gives you the flavour of old Kolkata .The special wall clock will grab your attention whenever you get into this place. Vast product line up and serving them fresh is a wow factor. The staffs are ever busy with the delivery be it in bulk or retail. I saw people coming in and going out like water flow . In that continuous busy customer service I quickly ordered my two variety of sandesh which I brought back home also had some of them at the shop itself. I ¬†don't want to say how was it or something like that to judge them ¬†just can share that its an experience which a foodie or a sweet lover should give a try. Highly recommended.

And it sells out very fast. They start selling it around 1pm. U can consider yourself lucky if u find one at 4-5pm. Other specialties u can try there include khirer chop(available after 6pm), chocolate sandesh, mistidoi(only 250gm and above) and various sandesh.

You won't get such taste anywhere else. Be it the Lord Chamcham, which is a must try for all, or the mango doi, or the various other sandeshes whose name I don't know. Every single one is a gem. The only negative point, I think, is they have only one branch. Must visit place for everyone.

This place is historical for sweets lovers at Kolkata. Though I personally do not like their sweets as they do not taste that extraordinary as compared to any other decent sweet shop.

Bhim Nag is near my place. A very old gem of a place continued by the new generations. Always filled with customers. And on any special occasions there is a guaranteed queue whenever one goes.

 Living in central Calcutta is a boon for foodies like me as the best and the worst ( read going by the name good ) are nearby. This is definitely a place for the people who have a huge sweet tooth for Bengali sweets. 

Their jol bhora or the taal sash will stuff you up. The butterscotch Sandesh is a good choice for people who want to taste something different. 

My cousin from the State's wanted to take some sweets back and they had the perfect container for packing them. Paying extra rs  30 ensures a hassle free trip.

During summers I enjoy their mango sandesh made with Alphonso mangoes, and I just love their khirer chop, the best in town. It's one Bong sweet I never get tired of specially from Bhim Nag. They also make wonderful Bengali sweetmeats or "mishtis" such as jolbhora talshansh, khirer goja, monohora, etc. Their misti doi sp. aam doi in summer is also quite famous. One of the oldest iconic Bengali sweet shops in Kolkata, Bhim Chandra Nag  definitely occupies a position at the top of my list of authentic Bengali sweets.

It has always been Bengali's favourite sweet shop. And they are very efficiently maintaining their standard.
Wide variety of sandesh and other sweets are available here. I like 'Abar khabo sandesh', 'korapak sandesh', 'jolvora', 'dilkush' and many more.

Tried their mistis brought by my aunt...to be specific I just liked the ''prano hora'' sandesh...apart from that I did not find any other sweet that suited me..their pantua was one of the worst that I have ever had.. I did not like it...if I visit this place it will only be for the sondesh...my ratings are only based on that one sweet...

One of the best bengali sweet shop in Kolkata. They are famous for their sandesh a traditional bengali sweet prepared from chhena (cottage cheese).
As I belong from the same locality where the shop is located, for me Bhim Nag is equivalent to good Sandesh.

Try Dilkhush, any variety of nalen gur sandesh (seasonal), abar khabo, mishti doi, aam doi (seasonal), chhanar polau, goja, khhirer chop.

My office is at bowbazar area. this century old ' mishtir dokan' is a walking distance from my office.this 'dokan' is serving very good ' sondesh','doi' & ' bhaja mishti' year after year.Mishti doi is a must try.but only thing is that the doi comes only in kg,500gms & 250 grams,but not 100 grams.

I went on a mission to sample all the popular and highly rated sweet shops on a recent trip to Cal. Bhim Chandra Nag was, hands down, the best of the lot to my judgement. If you are in Calcutta, and are reading this review- waste no more time. Plan a trip as soon as possible, and do not forget to drag your best friends and family members along!

Bhim Chandra Nag are a name to reckon with among the huge array of renowned sweet shops in Kolkata.. Colourful Sandesh display is what I remember about this shop..
The price may at a glance seem a bit higher than the local sweet shops near home, but the quality of the mishti makes up for it.. The sheer look of the various mithai (pure Desi ghee) on display is enough.. Kudos...
Bhim Chandra Nag is a shop which goes back decades in the sweet makers manual and it is still maintaining their standards with newer innovative ideas and items..
Being a bong I am a genuine mishti lover and I have a sweet tooth since childhood ; proudly announced that...
So just forget about the diabetes and indulge in the sinful delights of Haldiram..

Heard so much about this sweet shop. There was one outlet in Dover Lane area but I never could try it and now I don't even know whether it exists at all. Well, my colleague cum friend took me to this outlet in order to give me a real taste of sweets.
As my friends would know, I love western sweet dishes more than the Indian ones. If you put a cake and a Sandesh on the same table and ask me to choose any one of them, I would choose the cake. But this time I fell head over heels in love with the sweet offerings of this outlet. I loved their Paradise Sandesh, it became my favourite. I loved their ice cream Sandesh, I loved their Pan Sandesh - in fact, I loved them all and wanted them all. Never leave me alone there, for I know not what I would do.

Nothing to beat Bhim Chandra Nag where Bengali sweets are concerned. Once you have had their melt-in-the-mouth sandeshes such as abar khabo, Paradise, and a host of others you would not like to touch the sweets of any other shop. Bhim Nag is the top where rasogolla, sitabhog and other delicacies are concerned as well. They are second to none.¬†
Once the shop stood out in Bowbazar because the huge clock on its front was visible from a distance. What distinguished was that its numerals were in Bengali. It was made by Cooke & Kelvey.
Sir Asutosh Mookerjee on his way to the University of Calcutta in carriage used to stop everyday near the shop to buy sandesh. He used to enjoy the sweets thereafter.
Little wonder Bhim Chandra Nag does not bother to join the rat race like many other sweet shops, and rarely takes part in any competition. It is the uncrowned king of Bengali mishti

Being one of the legendary sweet shops from pre-independence era, this sweet shop has been one of my favourites in Kolkata. The best sweets in their platter are Taalshans (various sizes), chocolate sandesh and Alphanso sandesh (during summers). The best way to enjoy these sweets are to take them home, refrigerate and have them cold. My personal favourite is their Nolen Gur sweets, especially during winters. A must visit place especially if you are in Central Kolkata.

I really don't remember the name of the school or college but I do have faint memories of the place and the story the sweets of this place tells. The sweets are incredibly delicious and are not too sweet a trend very commonplace nowadays. They are very innovative with their sweets with some even chocolate flavored. A great place.

Bhim Nag is yet another legendary name in the history of "Sweet" culture of Bengal..This is their oldest and most renowned outlet located at Bowbazar and they have maintained their tradition by using ingridents of the highest quality to maintain the taste and purity of their sweets..They have also imbibed some innovations in recent times using chocolate as a flavour for their items and indeed they have faired well..Their Jolbhora Sondesh is all time favourite and a popular pick too..Their Doi has maintained their consistency ever since time immemorial.. Even their savoury items like Radhaballavi is a must try..In fact if you are a bit late in the evening you might be dissappointed as it finishes quite quickly..Overall visit this place to get a flare of our rich culture and heritage..

Although they have not come up with much new sweets recently, still what they have are more than enough a reason to try it out.

This is truly a heritage sweet shop in Kolkata. One which has not modernized and started mixing Chocolate with their sweets. Staying in extreme South Kolkata it is difficult to reach there unless going somewhere nearby on work. But do manage to visit this place about 2-3 times in a year.
Variety of flavored Sandesh such as with lemon and Mangoe flavors are truly must have and out of this world.
Their Kamala Bhog is another prize winner. The big size the flavor and the color all make it the best perhaps in Kolkata far better than those available in sweet showrooms of today like Haldiram's in Ballygunge and elsewhere.
Mishti Doi flavor taste consistency and color put together would go to make this the best in Kolkata better than Mithai or Jadab Chandra Das or Balaram Mullick or any other.
Any day it is one of the best Bengali Sweet shops.
Must order for occasions and get togethers from here. It is assured satisfaction for money well spent.

While frantically searching for an ATM on a recent visit to Chadni, my eyes fell on this shop and I was instantly filled with sugary childhood memories, when any special occasion meant waiting for my father to return home from office with a box of the sinful Jolbhora sandesh. No other place could beat Bhim Chandra Nag at that, especially if it was during Bengal‚Äôs jaggery filled winters when biting into a sandesh would guarantee thick gurer rosh oozing out into my fingers (which would then be promptly lapped up without a single thought). Feeling wistful for the old days, we put our search on hold and went immediately ahead to get our sugar fix. Sadly, the racks were almost completely empty and devoid of any variety of sweets. Komola bhog and korapaak roshogolla came to our rescue nevertheless. The chhena used in both were of different consistencies but tasted absolutely perfect. Places like these are beyond the scope of any judgment of mine, but I only wished it was still winter here and that too, a jaggery filled one.

Icecream Sandesh is the one dreams are made of... they come in so many flavours it will make you drool. And one cannot miss the antique watch hanging just behind the cash counter.

Bhim Nag one of the oldest traditional Bengali sweet house in Bow Bazaar is a MUST for anyone¬† in love with 'Mishti" Its an Iconic landmark of Kolkata which has maintained its quality over the decades. Was introduced to it in the late 60s and ever since no visit to Cal goes without a visit or 'take away' from this great 'Mishti" shop. While KC Das has the higher profile¬† ,Bhim Nag is certainly head and sholders above for the overall variety and quality of sweetmeats. The nolin gur sandesh aswell as the other traditional Bengali sweets are excellent and for someone broughtup on the extra sweet mithai of Jaipur my vote anytime goes for the sandesh. While the rosogullas of Bikaner are well known the ones here are light as a feather and you can gobble up dozens !!The place is popular with generations of Calcutta families so do try their excellent Mishti and youll be a convert for sure !!

Bhim Chandra nag is one of the most renowned Bengali sweet shops of Kolkata and its easy to see why.I was passing by this shop located in Bow bazar and without much hesitation decided to try out a few of their sweets.They are also one of the oldest shops and hence in keeping with their heritage,amidst the recent trend towards fusion sweets they still focus mainly on the more traditional Bengali sweets and do a great job at it.
I tried the nolen gur er sandesh,rosogolla,kalo jam and the goja.All of them were really really good.I loved the goja.It was brilliant.The crust outside was extremely crisp and the inside soft and not at all overtly sweet.The nolen gur er sondesh and the rosogolla were also lovely and fresh.The prices are moderate and are well and truly justified by the quality.Overall I simply loved the sweets here.

Mishti from nag' s was a ritual in our family... I still remember loads of sandesh, rosogolla, pantua and many more were packed a day before we leave kolkata ( childhoodmemories)...last year I visited this place in search of good old mishti and was happy to find good mishti with a twist of taste. .. one of my uncle was very good friends with the owners and strongly recommend nag always and we never regretted. ... still the good old nag and will visit again and again....

A very antique mithai shop located in the heart of Old Calcutta.
Have been here more than five times and they definitely greet royal customers with a big smile.
You have a wide variety of sweets to select.
Since we pick up sweets from here,mostly for the Household pujas,I would recommend settling for the famous Mango Sandesh,Chocolate Sandesh(available in various shapes in some festive seasons),Kaju Barfi with Aam Shotto and of course the Sweet Rosogolla.

It takes a pretty long time to understand the taste of the sweets from this place,but if you are a head strong person,I swear this sweet shop will be very difficult to forget.

The Description: Its just near my Office.... 2mins walk from bowbazar crossing towards Hind Inox.They are popularly known for there very good and renowned Sweets they provide fro years...

The Ambience: Its just like other sweet shop to take your sweets and go or you eat there standing. No sitting arrangements as now.

The Food: .Had lot of sweets from there... Misti Doe is my fav. you will find lots of other dishes here such as Kachoris the singharas and the dhoklas.¬†

The Conclusion: Prices are a bit factor for many but according to their sweets standards it fine.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

This place needs no introduction if you have been living in Kolkata your whole life. At one point of time or other, you are bound to come across sandesh from this place. This place is a legend and a heritage of North Calcutta and has a history and tradition ¬†of over a 100 years. The sandesh(s) will simply melt in your mouth and you will savor the taste of its each bite till the end. The morning kachori-sabzi is also very famous, the sabzi being dum-aloo on Fridays, as far as I can remember 2 years back.

Being a big sweet lover, I have a special place for this one. I remember those days when my father first introduced me to this shop. Before that I had only heard about it. The norom paak misti here is absolutely brilliant. I still remember those days when dad used to take me there and I would grasp everything (sweets) I could and how that place soon grew up to be my regular misti joint gradually!!
The innovation they apply on every sweet is awesome and if you have one, it will leave you craving for some more!!

This is yet another one of the Sandesh legends of Kolkata. There are a few things that are timeless, thankfully this is one of them. I have fond childhood memories of this place. The pillars on outside, the black n white flooring and the antique clock with numbers in Bengali . 
they are more reasonable than most other popular sweet shops and their fare is relatively simpler, but they are very honest to their product. i simply over the freshness of the chhena products and how they haven't changed even by 10 % over the last 3 decades that i have had sandesh 

i hope they keep making soul comforting desserts in years to come as well

Bhim Chandra Nag is one of the oldest sweet shops in the city. Rumour has it that Bhim Chandra Nag was the inventor of the "ladikanee", a fried syrupy sweet, which was named after Lady Canning, the wife of the first Viceroy of India (after the 1857 Mutiny).

Though Bhim Nag is well-known for the so-called Payadhi or reddish sweet curd, they have a number of interesting sweets on offer. Foremost among them is the wonderful Ice-Cream Sandesh, which is so fragile that it decomposes very quickly out of the refrigerator. Even before the concept of fusion sweets came into vogue, Bhim Nag stocked the Paan Sandesh, which, in its present avatar, comprises a green narampaak base with a core fllled with nuts. The other traditional narampaak sandeshes are also quite good.

Though of late the qualiy of their sweets have dipped slightly on account of costing problems, this shop remains an excellent choice for anyone interested in traditional Bengali sweets. This is attested to by the fact that certain items, like the Payadhi, sell out within hours of being put on sale.

Mishti doi from bhim nag is divine. In fact its the best. They have mastered through the years the art of balancing the sweetness with the creaminess and the result is such that you can go on having it without ever getting an overdose. However their bonde, the best side accompaniment to doi, is not as good as the doi. In fact, nothing is as good as their doi though their Paradise sondesh and rose sondesh is definitely worth a try. They were my grandmums favourite. If you are ever passing by, U MUST STOP BY!!!! Their only drawback is that the grub gets over soon despite their efforts to maintain a steady supply of sweets.

iye, if you are a bengali and you dont like Bhim nag, then you are an anomaly. There's no two way about it. However, here I will have to take away one mark as the last two times I went to their shop to get the doi, it was decidedly underwhelming for me, due to the lack of creaminess it previously had. However the norom paaker mishti is still song-worthy (i.e. you can sing songs about them) and the service, as usual, is brisk and no-nonsense.
