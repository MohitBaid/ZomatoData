Excellent food and an interesting menu. The decor could do with some sprucing up though. The service more than makes up for that shortcoming!! Had a veg thali and was very satisfied. Quantity was sumptuous. I look forward to my next meal here. All the best

I visited this hidden gem with my family on a rainy afternoon last week. I'd heard good reviews from my family members and was glad to check it out. It's Situated on the street opposite kalighat fire brigade.
We had a veg and a non- veg thala - which included 6 pieces of luchi, alur dum- very tasty, rice, moong dal, shredded alu chips, mocha, doi begun, ilish- was ok, could have been fresher and tastier. Also tried the pomfret fish curry which was divine. Chitol muitha was also great. Overall it was a great experience. And the dishes were not as expensive as some of the other popular bengali joints. So definitely will pop in again.

Sumptuous Bangali fare.
Each and every item was distinct in flavour.
We had niramish Thali with chital macher muittha, Kochi patha and mutton dakbunglow.Hungry souls Dug into the food right away and hence the lack of any photosüôÅ
Bill came to around 4000 for 8 people including all taxes.
We left happy..Bong souls well fed and content.
The crisp decor and professional demeanor of the staff was an added bonus.

Located at the Harish Mukherjee Road just a min. walk from Kalighat fire station which serves only bengali cuisines. Visited this joine for a take away on a sunday evening.¬† Ordered luchi, aloor dum, kochu chingri, bhetki dum, polao mutton kasha. Bhetki dum and mutton kasha tasted good. Kochu chingri - hard to find the chingri and did not expect such watery gravy from aloor dum which tasted very blunt. Prices are okish and service is fast.

I was interested to try this restaurant. Yesterday I went in. It is a large restaurant and tastefully decorated. It is almost like visiting a star restaurant ( maybe it is a star restaurant? I wouldn't know)
The menu was not immediately served and I had to ask for it. The price is on the higher side. The thalis attracted my attention but i wanted to parcel home something and it wouldn't prove a good choice. So after discussing with the manager, I chose Chingri malaicurry. It was warm even when we reached home. And it tasted delicious.

There is ample car parking space.

Would take Mom there sometimes to have lunch.

Had ordered baked fish and kochu chingri through Swiggy. The baked fish was okayish, but the kochu chingri failed to impress. Had expected better from the comments.

Visited Ghare Baile for bengali cuisine today.
We ordered 1 mahabhog thali and some ala carte  dishes. In the thali there was a dal ( a little too sweet for my taste) a tasty sukto and mocha. The ilish bhapa and the dakbangla mutton were also tasty. The thali had accompaniments like papad chutney mishti doi and a paan.    In all, the thali was good.

Cannot say the same for the chicken jahanara ( had taste of raw garlic) the daab chingri was not good but when we complained they very kindly changed it and not liking it again-- they did not charge us for it. Fish fingers were quite good.
The staff was polite and helpful. Service was good.
Overall a good experience though would want them to lessen the sugar quotient in the dishes. Dakbangla Mutton is a must try.

Average food,though the ambience and service is good.aam porate shorbot was just too sweet,though the fresh lime soda was ok.fish fry was not that bad,but the mutton curry(kochi pathar jhol) tasted quite bland.
