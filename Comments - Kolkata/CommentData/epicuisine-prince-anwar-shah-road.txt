It's located at the Spencer's food court in the South city mall.
It's a bakery shop. Various types of cakes, cookies, snacks are available here. 
We ordered donuts and sandwiches. 
Donuts were really big in size and super tasty..I really mean it. Sandwiches are my alltym favrte obviously.. their sandwiches were cheesy..creamy..full of mayonnaise and chicken.. 
For me it should be rated as 5/5 without any doubt.

Though you don't get to sit and eat, their baked goods are worth the trip. I especially love their sausage puff, chocolate donut and their various muffins.

This place at spencers of south city mall was long in my bucket list..i did have a bite of their egg devil once..couldnot try their chicken items unfortunately..
However i managed to taste their bakery products...
The strawberry cake slice was a tad bit sour to my taste buds..otherwise..it was very fresh smooth and soft..i loved the rich flavour..next the eclair was one of the best i hav tasted..crunchy coat..with smooth filling..will definitely try out their other products..a seating arrangement will be highly appreciated i guess..

One of the best range of desserts at reasonable prices. The size of the desserts are good enough for the price. So it's really worth of the money you pay for them. The desserts are too delicious. Most recommended place for dessert lovers. They also sell fresh baked goods like muffins, cookies and breads. I've tasted many of their delicacies. If you're looking for stomach-filling and mouth-watering desserts at adorable prices then Epicuisine is the place.

The only reliable place to eat when you are shopping at Spencer's, south city mall. Their non veg items are really tasty and of good quality. I like their mutton kosha puff a lot. Paturi puff is also good . But the pastries and cheesecakes are not that tasty as they appear to be.

It's very difficult to avoid the bakery corner when shopping at Spencers... The food looks so luring and inviting! Two of my favorite items are the creamy chicken puff and the sausage one, as well as the cookies. The bread is excellent too.

A quick visit to Spencers left me standing in front of this little piece of heaven on earth. You may think this is over exaggeration, but that's how I felt. The scenery filled with delicious pastries and baked goodies, the smell of freshly baked cookies - heaven!! We wanted to try the cheesecake, and we were not disappointed. Its soft and cheesy feel and flavor left us craving for more. The price and the quality are lower and better, respectively, than most "bakeries" in Kolkata. The Mango Truffle looked strangely delicious, but had no time to try it. But the next visit is sure to bring some more good memories of well prepared dessert items into our lives. All in all, a good place to grab a quick bite for all those sweet teeth out there.

A decent bakery located at South City Mall in the basement where Spencer's is situated. A popular destination to purchase freshly baked breads, they have humble offerings when it comes to pastries and puff/patty as well. The star item of this place is brownie. A must try if you are here. Other than this, most other pastry items are charged higher than the quality which is served here.

This patisserie is located at the Spencer's mall in South city mall(lower basement)..Its a giant outlet serving all bread items both sour and sweet..I liked the way they were making the doughs and bread rolls..I was in a mood of having some chocolate pastries so I tried..
Chocolate dark fantasy...It tasted good but it could be little more softer..
Black forest...It did not taste at all like normal black forest and the colour combination was also different...It tasted ok...
Cheese garlic bread...I had carried this home for my breakfast..I found it ok, nothing great..The bread was little too salty...
The price of the pastries was higher than what it serves...
The outlet was nicely decorated,neat and clean and well lit...I loved the way they symbolised it as patisserie..
To end of...
You can definitely try some of its items after your shopping session @Spencers..But you will not find any seating places..You will have to stand and munch onto your food..

Epicuisine is a patisserie which can be located in Spencers at South City Mall. The place is very clean and hygienic. There is no sitting arrangements but there are places where you can stand have your food. While shopping some household things I found this place near the billing counter of Spencers. I found the place very neat and clean and the place is well maintained. I was in a mood of having some desserts after having a meal in Cafe Mezzuna.
I took these desserts:
#Chocolate Truffle: Dark and Rich Chocolate. I liked the taste but it could have been lil soft. 

#Black Forest: I don't know why and how they have named it Black Forest as it neither taste nor looks like one. But whatever it was it tasted nice.

#Tiramitsu: Well, it was decent and nothing great. The coffee flavour was coming well but lacked lil sweetness.

They have maintained the quality but the desserts are lil over priced as per me.
Overall a decent place to have some desserts.

I think this has replaced (or revamped?) the Spencer's patisserie and its very good for light bites which are light on pocket too.

At mere 50 rupees you get two thick triangles of chicken sandwich with plenty of chicken. The crunchy chocolate mousse is lovely- it is decadent and I love the crunchy cake crumb at the bottom. Thr mango souffle is delicious even though I would have liked some more real mango slice in there. The brownie is also heavenly and fudgy. The sausage rolls and kosha mangsho puffs are worth special mention.

This section at Spencer's South City Mall is hard to ignore and if you have managed to do so, till date, then you have no idea what you have been missing. The Epicuisine, previously known as the Patisserie produces some of the best cakes and bakes. The death by chocolate is a personal favorite. It is hard to shop at spencer's without craving for this devilish chocolate treat. 

The Strawberry and the pineapple slice are a delight too. The frosting is fresh and light. The cake comes with a thin base of digestive biscuit crumbles that gives you that cheesecake feel, without having to worry about the calories. Make sure you try the brownie, it is marvelous.

If you are not much of a sweet tooth, you can definitely try the Kosha Mangsho puff. I always buy bread from here. The bread is baked and sliced all in front of you that contributes to all the excitement. I also love their muffins. 

The level of cleanliness maintained in and around the baking area is great.

Really?Is that how you behave with a customer?I would have understood if at least she had gotten my order right.But she didnt.Madam,first of all,you are not good at what you do.So,you better keep that attitude in your pocket.I would request the management to take care of this.

Recently while shopping in Spencers, i had purchased a takeaway consisting of a chicken croissant and a chocolate truffle pastry.
                         The truffle pastry was well made and it was worth the price, which was rs 75 and it was delicious, exactly how a truffle should taste but the chicken croissant which was also priced at rs 75 wasn't so appealing in terms of taste,quality and economy.  
             Since i am a frequent to Spencers, i might just drop by to try a few more items from this confectionery.!

I always visit this place if i am in South City especially for their Blueberry Cheesecake. God! Totally worth it. Everyone should try their cheesecake. I m sure you will melt too. It is renovated and the name has changed too. 'Epicuisine' is worth a visit.

This outlet is located in the basement of South City Mall inside Spencer's. But I think that most probably they've changed the name to Epicuisine after the renovation and relocation. They've also added many new items. All for good. They have a wide array of different variety of breads which are generally not available easily elsewhere. They also have many kinds of pastries and cakes which can be ordered. Excellent. Savoury items are also available so one can have their fill of both sweet and savoury. All their items are very good. Some do seem overpriced but then it's acceptable for the quality. Good place .

Located inside Spencer's of South City Mall, just besides the frozen food section. Spencers Patisserie is the bakery unit operating inside Spencer's. They stock a whole lot of cakes, pastries, muffins, breads and stuff but what attracts me the most is their snack items. They prepare fresh snack items around 12 noon time, so it's the best time to have them. I have had their Chicken Roll, which is appreciable because of its size, big pieces of chicken and negligible use of oil. Chicken Sandwich is also nice, tastes like typical ones which you get in flights. They are bigger in size though and has a lot of chicken inside. Pastries could be good, never tried them mostly because they mess up a lot while carrying home.

Pricing is satisfactory, snacks are priced between ₹50-70 and pastries are ranged between ₹60-100. Cakes could be a little expensive touching ₹600-1000. Service was fast, billing was smooth and done there itself (not at the payment main counter).

PS: Couldn't click photos of the counter as the guy there gave a strange look while I was trying to photograph. He asked me to come in front of the billing counter, so I didn't took any photographs of the pastries and stuff in display.

Had ordered a friend's birthday cake. It was a dark chocolate cake with milk chocolate frosting. Birthday girl loves pizza so we had told them to make one on top of the cake! So they made the pizza with white chocolate, kiwi n cherries. It looked really nice.
And the cake tasted just awesome! :*

Spencers Patisserie is located in the basement of South City Mall in Spencers. The smell of freshly baked cakes, breads etc surely makes me hungry every single time. I have tried their chocolate muffins, brownies, chicken creamy puff etc. I love all of them. Every single item of this bakery is delicious.The chicken cream puff is very tasty, the chicken pieces are delicious. However, the staff is sometimes rude. They have a no photography policy,but how can we know about iy if you dont inform us???. The way the staff told us to stop taking photographs was very rude. They should behave well with the customers.

Located in the Basement, Inside Spencers at South City Mall, it is one of the new emerging cake shop of Kolkata. With modern equipment's and well managed and maintained staffs, they really serves the order pretty fast. The breads and related stuffs are quickly available as its being baked there only and also they have a wide variety of cakes to choose from. My personal favorite is the Trio of Chocolate Cake which is just awesome, prepared with mainly white chocolates.  Along with full 1 lbs and 2 lbs cakes, small slices are also available to taste from before ordering big cakes. Big cakes are also available within 4-5 hours after order is being placed which is pretty fast. Overall I personally had a nice and satisfactory experience, every time I went there.

Oh my god. If you love desserts this is your place to be. Their death by chocolate cake is awesome. I loved their chocolate cake slice. It had an underlying flavour of coconut which accentuated the overall taste.

Located almost at the end of the SC Spencers adjacent to the frost food counter, the sight of the pastries will really attract you. It did to me also, but that was the first and the last time. 

I love Black forest and hence could not resist myself from ordering it, my kid wanted to have pineapple cake. But he did not had the whole of it and I was struggling to kind the cake in it as a whole I felt that I was having just cream. I also did not like black forest.

I restrict myself to having the milk bread now.

Preface - - - -  One highly sinful spot that is sure to attract your senses and distract you while you are busy shopping at Spencers, South City. The cakes and pastries which are on display are sure to make you take a pause and taste them out. It's one common thing for me now to stop by the Patisserie in between shopping to get something packed for home or to try out some really enchanting piece of gastronomical artwork from the bakery.

Food - - - - Tried mainly their cakes and pastries, and tried quite a few varieties of them. 

a) Kiwi cream cake - Tried a slice of Kiwi cream cake which was really fresh, awesome, super-soft and was a great value for money. It will make you come back for more.

b) Passion Fruit cream cake - Purchased this for a birthday celebration at home, so had quite a bit of it, definitely more than a slice. The jelly like topping was giving all the taste and spark it required, the cake was extremely fresh and was melting in mouth. Sometimes you may find it difficult to serve since it breaks for being ultra soft.

c) Death by Choco cake - Now this is one real sinful peace of food item. At INR 85 you get teleported to a land filled with chocolates everywhere. It has got real dense chocolate cream on top of it that can sometimes be too sweet and chocolaty for you.

d) Blueberry Muffin - This is one thing we have quite often. Apart from trying out normal muffins from this place oneday I decided to go for this Blueberry muffin. It is one moderately soft, not-so-fluffy muffin base with dense Blueberry flavored jelly on top, quantity of jelly can be increased to make the thing even more attractive and interesting. Make sure there is a bit of jelly in each bite that you take.   

e) Cheesecake - Tried their cheesecake once, can't recollect the exact name though. I felt it was nice but unmemorable, not a great spot to have cheesecakes.

Service - - - - Really fast service to say the least, orders are received in sequence, billed and served in real quick time, people out there are polite and prompt. So they are basically nice, they don't make you wait long for your favorite slice of pasty :)

Summary - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 3.5/5
Food quality: 4/5
Food presentation: 3.8/5 
Value for money: 4/5 
Service: 4.2/5

Overall - - - - Though I am yet to try out many other items here, but I have surely got a hang of the quality they serve after trying them out several times (I have actually lost the count). If you are having the food there you might need to stand and eat since it is mostly crowded and you won't get a place to sit, so it's always best to opt for take-away. Also this is one great destination to get ready-make lovely birthday cakes at very reasonable price, apart from being one quick-bite station for regular shoppers at Spencers! So try them out next time you are here at this place.

Cheers!

Good tasty chocolate cakes  Tried the death by chocolate and chocolate truffle pastries and they were very moist and tasty. Price I felt though was a little high. Nevertheless while shopping at Spencer's if you feel like grabbing a sweet bite. Don't hesitate to order from here.

As you pass by the shop inside spencer's you would be mesmerized with the variety of bakery itema and pastries but as soon as you take a bite you would be really diappointed by the quality and taste. The food is not even satisfactory and the reheat everything in microwave oven which even further spoils the taste.

Expenditure / VFM : 150 for 2 people ( may seem slightly overpriced going by the size of pastries)

Ambience / Service : A takeaway inside Spencers.

What to Order : Pineapple Pastries
The ironic thing about this place is, some days the pastries are very soft and well baked. And on other days they can get hard and rough (may be even stored). So, I See a lack of consistency and one has to take a chance with their baked stuff. But the days they are good, they are really good.

Wide selection of freshly baked breads, biscuits,muffins, pies, etc. 
Wouldn't recommend the cream pastries in the showcase even though everything looks so pretty. The few times I've eaten those, I found them to be too dry or stored for too long. 
The one time I bought packaged sushi almost made me swear off it. Never again. 
Just the freshly baked ones please.

A nice place for pastries. Been here several times while buying ingredients for my weekend cooking. Some of the pastries displayed are very tempting and taste good too. Ideal when you are roaming around for couple of hours and you need a quick sweet bite to break the monotony. However, you can take it away packed in box if you wish. They also sell sushi, sandwiches and some other non-sweet items which I have never tried and don't feel like.

Whenever I come to Spencer's, I never miss few bites here. I love their pastries especially kiwi pastry, mango pastry and 3 tier chocolate pastry. I had once got their hard crust chocolate cake for my brother's birthday. I even got their kiwi on fresh cream cake as my boyfriend's birthday cake.
Their freshly baked breads are awesome especially their brown bread. They slice them right in front of you.
Even their plum cakes and dandi cakes are the best during Christmas.
They sell sushi too which I shall try soon.

Shopping at south city wana have a quick bite at a pocket friendly joint? Come here..
From wow momo! To kwality walls. From delicious shawarma wraps to yummy pastries they got evrything. Infact they change the main course menus often so you can always try something new. pocket friendly,well organised and fast service.
The only problem is the extremely small sitting space. Most of the time we have to stand and eat which is a big draw back.

Its difficult to find a seat here since its mostly overcrowded. The chicken shwarma wrap is heavenly. With the perfect combination of my favorite flavor of mayonnaise, shredded chicken, veggies, green chatni and onions it steals my heart. I love their American breakfast with bacon and egg poach and the crispy baby corn.  At a corner opposite the shwarma counter there's a man who makes jhal muri.. I simply love that. With an array of food counters we are left with several options to choose. I like it.

The first time i noticed this place was while i was in spencers shopping my groceries. I was bored and the cheesecakes looked succumbing. Hence i couldn't resist the temptation of trying them out and since that very day this part "spencers patisserie" of spencers just kept pampering my sweet tooth. Though when it started out for the people of kolkata places like monginis, kathleen, kookie jar, cakes etc were the destination but this joint's bold and innovative efforts paid off and was well appreciated. Their popularity spread like wild fire and they deserve all of it. Be it cheesecakes of various flavors, paties', mousse and other confectioner products they deliver with perfection. From my experience it can give a healthy competition to outlets like "la patiserrie" and "bistro" etc.

This bakery has just started to become popular with some innovative pastry creations. All the muffins moose and pastries are just delicious. But in most of them sour part is more than the sweet which makes it very difficult to eat, it spoils the taste. Otherwise ideas and creativity is appreciable.

Very good in quality. Price a bit ob the upper side for cakes but worth it. Two days back I tried mango chhese cake which was Rs 750 for a kg. But it was awsome. Also fresh and tasty breads and other bakery products are sold in reasonable price. I will definitely recommend it to you.

This bakery is one of my favourites. Have tried different items during my monthly shopping  at Spencer's.The USP of this place is the open bakery where all items are prepared fresh and are up for grabs.I must say that the variety of breads,pastries,cookies,croissants and savouries on offer is huge.The joint is pretty clean and that is an added much desired bonus. The different breads on offer are pretty decent, oven fresh and priced right.The creamy chicken puff(Rs 35/-) and the sausage puff(Rs 40/-) is strictly okay.Nothing special given the fact that the stuffing inside is bland.The choco chip muffin(Rs 40/-) and the cup cake are quite nice.I am yet to sample their large variety of pastries on offer especially the attractive looking blue berry cheese cake.Recently they have added burgers and sandwiches to their menu.More on this in my next visit.They also  accept orders for customised cakes for special occasions.To sum up i would say that this Patisserie  has a lot of potential and is kind of under rated.Prices are as per mall standards-bit on the higher side.

This outlet, with an adjacent open baking area offers a rather large variety of breads, cakes, savouries. They also have rather nicely done brownies (far better than the one at Quest),

There is a huge range of pastries on offer. Full sized chocolate and fruit cakes. I have tried a few and it is difficult to say which is good or bad. Try whatever catches your fancy. You cannot go very wrong. They also have a limited range of patties (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian), but they are not as great as some others.

I totally recommend their breads.

The prices are a bit on the higher side, but you are assured of fresh products (all packaged ones carry the date), and the fact it is made in a super clean environment.

South City Mall being the closest to my residence Spencers is a favored place for all the home shopping. I really like their Patisserie and always pick up some of the bread , croissants and cheese straws to carry home for later consumption. The best part of the Patisserie is the wonderful array of products spread out. The display cases filled with sweet and savory items are quite a treat. The apple pie is good to pack and take home and zap in the microwave for a few seconds and consume with a scoop of Vanilla Ice-cream .... yummmmmm !!!! If you have a sweet tooth try the pastries they are fresh and tasty and portion sizes are fairly good.

Spencer's Patisserie - A lovely place to enjoy the cream pastries and cakes. Not just that, they even sell the Japanese 'Sushi' which i will try later. :) 
------------
Brief: 

As i was looking for my home stuffs in Spencer's. I immediately saw this in the Spencer's Patisserie on the basement, South City Mall. It was over crowded and i was like is it really good? I somehow went to give a try out here. So, i went there. :) The prices were the mall standard. 
------------
Food: 

I had the kiwi cream pastry which costed me 65 bucks. It was really awesome and as good as a Kookie Jar pastry. I was strongly satisfied with the taste. It was mouth melting with cream below the kiwi on the top and a little sweet crust on the down which made this pastry a lovely dish. One pastry is enough for 1 person. 
------------
Summary: 

Food quantity 4/5
Food quality 4/5
Food presentation 3.5/5
Value for money 4.5/5 
------------
Conclusion: 

A lovely place to visit with friend's or families while you finish shopping out here in Spencer's. They even were preparing bread in front of me in a mesmerising way. Cheers. :)
