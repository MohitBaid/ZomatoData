A local chinese outlet in the neighbourhoods of baghajatin. This place has been running for a long period of time providing quality chinese food at affordable rates. Recently they tied up with swiggy leading to the expansion of their services. So likewise i tried their food via swiggy for the following items:-

1. Spicy treat Special pepper chicken - Shredded chicken shallow fried stirred with bell peppers,garlic,onions,chillies & grounded pepper. The quantity was very generous. The chicken was perfectly cooked with perfect amount of spice & condiments. Very satisfying for the taste buds.

2. Crispy chilli babycorn - Typical indo-chinese preparation of spicy crispy babycorn. They were crunchy from the outside while softer from the inside. Again generous in quantity. This was good in taste & spicyness.

3. Chicken chilli garlic rice - Again a basic friedrice preparation in chilli garlic sauce with good amount of chicken & vegetables. This was rather okayish in taste.

4. Honking chicken - 8pcs of medium sized chicken(batter infused) in dark soy sauce,bell peppers & onion. The dish was different to taste maybe due to its uniqueness but the disappointing thing about dish were the chicken pieces itself. The chicken had gooey batter inside which made the experience terrible.

The over pocket pinch is on the lower side. They have varieties of dish which could be tried upon.

Very good take away center. Food is very good - my recommendations are - Chilly Garlic noodles, gravy chowmin, chicken peeper salt, crispy chicken, dragon chicken, paneer pakora etc. Most importantly owner and all other staffs are so courteous and well behaved that u would like to visit there again and again. Most importantly even around 11:30 night they are available and provide u home delivery.
