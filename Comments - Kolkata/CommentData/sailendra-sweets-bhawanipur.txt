A popular sweet shop amidst the busy streets of Bhawanipore. In a hot summer day, when a sweet toothed bong wants to enjoy the best Mishty Doi o S.Kolkata, this is the only recommendation. With several other variety o mouth pampering sweets like Roshogolla nd Gulab Jab I almost forgot for sometime that I might get fat. It's surely worth a visit. ðŸ˜ƒ

With quick service and popularity Sailendra sweets is one of best shop around the Bhawanipore area. I simply drool over their Misti doi.. Also the other sweets are quite good with maintained quality and taste. Try out for better experience.

Located at Bhawanipore, Kolkata, this is one sweet shop, which simply excels when it comes to Roshogolla and Mishti Doi. Nothing much to expect from the ambiance but their Mishti Doi atleast can easily compete with the likes of Jugal's and Amrito. Do try this place if you are around.

*What : After a long days I m back with sweets...
*Where : Entering area of Jadu babur bajar,nearby Balaram mullick sweets outlet.
*When : At afternoon
*pocket pinch : Reasonable price with great quality.

* Ambience : No question of ambience in sweet shops. Come,decide your snacks like singara,kochuri and of course sweets; pay; move on. This sweet shop offers you a broad space to eat inside the shop and neat and clean whenever I visit that bazar area. Its difficult to maintain cleanliness there,but they are amazingly maintaining it.

* 1. Rosogolla : it is worth mentioned at first. It is so smooth that can melt in your mouth as soon as you take. Few N.kolkata sweet outlets can make so much smooth rosogolla as them. I liked it so much. (rating 10 on 10)

2. Yellow chomchom : They are also fascinating in taste. The quality of chomchomm they are offering @just rs 8, is just WOW!!! (rating 9 on 10)

3. Dim Sandesh : For the very first time I opted for their à¦¨à¦°à¦® à¦ªà¦¾à¦•à§‡à¦° sandesh item and I liked it instantly. All sweets may it be à¦¨à¦°à¦® à¦ªà¦¾à¦• or à¦•à§œà¦¾ à¦ªà¦¾à¦•,quality at its best comparing to the price. (rating 9 on 10)

* Why recommended : Being a N.Kolkatan frankly speaking that I don't like S.Kolkata sweets as they taste totally different. But this sweet outlet is an exception.
Rosogollas are MUST TRY.

Had their pantua and I have to say it was quite good. The pantua was tightly made yet soft and juicy, almost as good as the mouth-watering pantuas of Krishnanagar. For pure ghee products and sweets, this is a good shop to try out.

The best sweet shop in the town. Please try 'MISTHI DAHI' which is out of the world. And if you thought thatâ€™s all thereâ€™s to it, think again. The â€˜Kulfiâ€™ is well-loved here and if youâ€™ve never had one before, one awesome never-before-had experience awaits you.

Small sweet shop which looks nice. No sitting arrangement only takeaway service. Ambitious was nice. Hospitality was good. Quick service and friendly staff. Pure bengoli sweets made of desi ghee which tastes delicious. I liked the most their rossogulla and sandesh. Rossogulla was very light, spongy & delicious and sandesh was pure chhena made  and it was very delicious too. Good experience here. Recommended to all.

Whenever I go to Kolkata, I just cannot restrict myself from having the rosogollas and the mishti doi from this shop. The rosogollas are too soft and the sweetness is very light. This shop provides the best mishti doi in Kolkata. The quality of all the sweets are very good. If someone wants to take sweets abroad, I would recommend the kheerkodom and soanpapdi as they stay good for many days and the foreigners just love them (specially the kheerkodom because it is very uncommon and not easily available).

The sweets are really awesome. The quality is too good as they are made of pure ghee, specially the soanpapdi, gulab jamuns and mihidanas.

This sweet shop is like the many other sweet shops in Kolkata. Very simple and small but with some awesome sweets. The Rasagullas here are really soft and spongy albeit slightly more sweet than the should be. But still can be classified as excellent and gives competition to the likes of Chittaranjan's Rasagullas or any other famous name. The Rasbhari# too was just right...with the correct sweetness and freshness. Excellent sweets from here.
