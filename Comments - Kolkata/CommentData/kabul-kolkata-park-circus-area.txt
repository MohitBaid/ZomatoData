Tasty non-veg dishes at great price! And as an added benefit you get great service as well.

I visited this eatery for an early dinner today. Reached around 630 pm and was through before seven-thirty pm.

I ordered Chicken Tikka kebab and Afghani roti(see the attached pics).
The kebab was well marinated and roasted to perfection. I was able to tear the kebab to smaller pieces using the fingers of only one hand. This is a test of the softness of chicken and the Kebab passed with full marks.

They gave a green chutney and a sweet mayonnaise like chutney to accompany the Kebabs .
The roti was a very nicely done. It was pretty large. Equivalent to two tandoori rotis elsewhere. Made only from rough atta, the rotis are relatively healthy too!

I ended with a glass of Afghani Milk Tea. The tea was very lightly brewed and less sugary and more milky. It provided a perfect end to a great experience.

The service is very good. There is one roly-poly waiter who is cheerful and friendly.

Kabul Kolkata - it was a pretty trending name a few months back in zomato, specialist in providing the afgani food. So, it was a long due plan to be there. Atleast during the last working day of 2017, we are here.

Location:
___________

It was very near to the 7th point crossing park circus. If you coming from science city area ( Ma flyover), go straight crossing the 7 point crossing. It will be just there on the right hand.

Ambience:
_____________

It is not worthy mentioning. Not that clean also. USP is food and only food.

Food:
________

✓ Mutton Kabuli Polao - had this kind of this for the 1st time. Very nice, well cooked rice comes with a piece of mutton.

✓ Mutton Nihari- that was amazing. Comes with two pieces of Mutton. Tough I had the best one in Lucknow for sure.

✓ Mutton Rosh - a big piece of boiled mutton piece server with Dal. It was good but not excellent to me as having Mutton without spice is really not my cup of tea. So be aware of that fact.

✓ mutton karahi tomato with egg - this dish was excellent. Small pieces of mutton cooked with egg and chopped tomatoes.

✓ Afgani Murg Handi - this was just superb. Cooked owssum. Loved it.

✓ murg balkhi - another excellent. Cooked with capsicums in dry mode. That is just mouthwatering.

✓ Kabuli naan - very nice one. Big size of tandoori roti . But the taste is different. 


All that cost 1250 INR. 

Overall a very nice experience.

Few suggestions:
__________________
✓ need more cleanliness.
✓ need to update the menu in zomato.


This a great place having the authentic Afgani food. If they give attention to some few minor thing, this place can be more and more appealing.

To all : give it a try and enjoy something different.

Kabul is such a word, where you will get the Afghani touch & when it comes about Afghani food, the food is not so spicy but you will get the aroma of various Indian Sub continental spices. So let’s come and explore this place.

The place located near the Park Circus 7 Point Crossing, just a 2min walk towards Minto Park, so very easy to locate it. The restaurant have two separate sections for different purpose. One is for regular dining & other is for family dining. Service is quick.

We ordered –

1.	Mutton Kabuli Pulao – This one is the Kabul special item so after taking suggestion, we ordered this one. After few minutes, when the food came, we observed that it was served cool. So we call the stuff & ask him to change it. Then few minutes, after that we got a warm one. A single midsized mutton piece was served with the rice, which was not fleshy enough. The rice was too sweet & the over aroma of ingredients like garam masala, clove etc. simply just kill the pure aroma of Pulao. Overall not worthy.

2.	Mutton Nihari – Generally Nihari are famous for its spiciness & bone marrow into the gravy, but surprisingly both were missing from this one. One pieces midsized good mutton piece was served with lots of lite spicy gravy. Overall okay type.

3.	Kabul Roti – The roti was huge in size & thick enough to fill your empty tummy with just one roti. This one is their special one. Good.

4.	Mutton Rosh – This one is the most favorite item here, so we also ordered this one. The dish comes with either mattar dal or mutton keema. The Mutton keema variant is little expensive than the dal one. The portion of mutton, which was served was huge in size, juicy, tender and soft. Super like it. The mutton keema which we took also goes well with the Kabul Roti. Love it & full recommended dish here.

Overall, it was not so great dining experiences from our side except the Mutton Rosh, which really impressed us a lot. Hope to visit this place again.

It was an okies experience to try afgani cuisine at this place,food is delectable but did'nt feel the extraordinary touch recently in the way it is known.maybe I visited this joint on a bad day perhaps.Hoping for much better food experience next time.Staff is very courtegious no doubt.With AC seating also available this place seems to have a good future as it is also value for money

Hidden at a corner in park circus, this is one of the best mughlai food outlet in town. Definitely try out their kabuli pulao, mutton roash, and keema. I still can't take the taste out of my buds.

Afghani food is famous for its aromatic masala , dry fruits and light cooked food. So here you can get it. You will not get any ambience over here, but they have two sections. One for family dine in and one for regular dine in. Located just near to the 7 point crossing. A small restaurant just where the AJC Bose flyover is ending.
                    

The most recommended one is Mutton Rosh.

Mutton Kabuli Pulao– A single medium sized piece of mutton was served with this pulao. As it is pulao , its sweet enough. The ingredients like garam masala, nutmeg and mace being felt. As a biryani lover, its not really going. Didnt liked that much. Even the mutton piece was not that fleshy enough.

Mutton Nihari– The mutton piece was soft and good too. The preparation is light. The gravy was good but the strong flavour of garam masala can be felt which need to be diminished a bit.

Kabuli Roti– A jumbo sized tandoori roti which equals to two. One will be perfect for a person as its thick enough.

Mutton Rosh– The best in the menu. Highly recommended. They will ask you whether to take this with dal or mutton keema but go for mutton keema. The will give you a cooked huge juicy mutton piece along with mutton keema. Awesome.
                                          ...

This place was in my wish list for so long. But to some extent it disappointed me! Decor n ambiance r average. They should give more stress on hygiene n cleanliness. 
Now coming to the main part ie. FOOD. We had Afghani mutton pulao. Rice was well cooked. The aroma was arousing. N small pieces of mutton were so tender. We also had Chicken karachi n Chicken boti. Loved them too. The nan was okayish. 
In spite of such tasty dishes, I would think twice to come back to the place just because the lack of the cleanliness!!😟

Located in the prime location just 2 minutes walking from park circus 7 point this place is owned by afghan origin people.
 Ambience is nothing to talk about.There are two section ground floor non-AC section & 1st floor AC Section.
 Service is also a bit issue here.But when come to
 food they are too good.
We have tried their
Chicken siji kabab-chicken was so tender & soft.It was definitely the showstopper.
Mutton keema- it was tasty & good
Afghani nan-it was humongous.you need atleast 3 people to finish 1 Afghani nan
Heard about kabuli polao was not available then.
I am planning for my 2nd visit very soon.

A no frills place run by actual Afghans. A delight for meat lovers. We tried the Mutton Roush which in a single word was delectable. Never had anything like this ever. Unmissable for mutton lovers. The Afghani Pulao was smelling awkward. We couldn't finish it. They said 'it smells like that'. Afghani Naan looks as good as it is, again unlike the regularly found. Wanted to try the Afghani Lassi, sadly wasn't available.

Cleanliness is an issue they have to address.
I'll definitely visit this place again for their mutton roush and Afghani Naan.

If you want a giant fill of good food, this is the place for you.
My only compain could be the pieces of mutton in the pulao. But the taste of the rice made up largely , for it.
The Afghan Naan was a real treat. The sheer size of it is overwhelming. Not for the faint-hearted! If you're looking for something spicy to keep you warm this season, Kabul Kolkata is your go to place.

Chicken Handi..
1st thing to notice.. the river of OiL!
Taste- The Gravy was a mix between Chinese and Muglai.. 
The small Chicken pieces were hard, Chewy and seemed a bit still raw, undercooked actually so the dish was dissapointing, with chicken not cooked and too much oil.

Kabuli Roti... Good tat it was Big, nice design on it... but Tooo hard on the jaws!

All in all, for it to be their best, I'm dissapointed and wouldn't be eating from the place anymore.

This place had been in my wishlist for a long time, yesterday we decided to drop in here.
Not very difficult to locate,situated just opposite to Jhal Farezi, this restaurant looks like a normal eatery with no fancy decors.
We ordered-
•Kabuli Pulao combo 
•Butter Tikka Masala
•Kabuli Naan

Kabuli Pulao Combo consisted of a plate of pulao with a piece of mutton,a portion of keema,green salad and half a portion of Kabuli Naan.
The Keema had a homely flavour of spices and tasted great.

Chicken Butter Tikka Masala was full of flavours with 10 small pieces of chicken. The gravy was very tasty

Kabuli Naan was like a roti of huge size.

The food as I had expected was tasty.
Our total bill came up to 480,which was totally worth it.
The Menu in Zomato should be updated coz the prices vary and there are few more dishes which is not present in the menu provided by Zomato here.

I was very excited to be here because it is an all meat joint.
So being a meat lover this place was a absolute delight for me.
We ordered for , Murg siji and tangri kabab.
Well i cant just explain how wonderful experience it was having this amazing dish.
I was just here to have this particular one from this joint.
The chicken was so tender and soft that it made me take back another one home.
About the decor and place, well it has an okay ambience. But the food here helps you forget everything here.
Undoubtedly Murg siji is the star performers here.
I would love to come back to this place only for this particular dish.
So people if you are looking for a good meat joint and if you have a set ready to share stories over some lovely cooked chicken ,this is the place you should visit.
Kabul Kolkata definitely gets a 'Must try' tag from me.

The delicacy of Kabul in Kolkata. Kabul Kolkata is an excellent joint for traditional Afghani food. A very small and literary unattractive joint situated near Seven point crossing, Park Circus. Come to food

1. Kabuli Pulao Combo: It comes with one plate of Kabuli Mutton Pulao(Biryani quantity), one plate of Mutton Keema, half portion of Kabuli Roti and one plate of green salad. Excellent Pulao with a big piece of mutton. Keema was really good and good in quitantity. One plate of combo is enough for two people.

2. Mutton Rosh: The heaven for Mutton lovers. A big piece of mutton chunk slowly cooked in aromatic spices. As we Bengali used to call মোমের মতো নরম (Soft like molted wax). It comes with mutton keema or daal (choice is yous). Please....god sake have it. No other restaurant offers this happiness.

My target was Mahi Akhbari but it was unavailable.

Service was really good. You don't have to wait much. Prices are really worthy(don't go through the Zomato menu prices.Prices are changed).

They only charged 10% extra for A.C 😁

Food: 4.6/5
Ambience: 3.9/5

Kabul Kolkata name itself describes the cuisine. We were looking for good Afghani food in city. So this one is quite authentic. We ordered Afghani chicken kebab, chicken handi curry, afghani naan and double roti. Kebab was really light and unique in taste. Chicken handi curry was mouthwatering and naan was also really soft and crispy. Food was really good but ambience was disappointing. Must improve the ambience.

Kolkata has become a hub of global cuisines since the last 1.5 years with variety of restaurants popping up in the city offering variety of food belonging to different culture. Kabul is certainly one of such gem of a place which offers afghani cuisine which is certainly rare in the food hub of kolkata. So on a sunday afternoon my friend & I decided to have our lunch at this hidden gem after hearing a lot of rave reviews about this place. This restaurant is located just beneath the AJC Bose flyover near 7 point park circus crossing opposite of Hotel AkashDeep. The restaurant has adequate sitting divided into 2 floors with the upper one being the family section having AC while the lower level is general. The place doesn't boast of any special ambience but it's the food which would totally bowl you over.

We had the following:-

1. Mutton Seekh Kebab - 5 Delicate mutton seekh kebabs divided into mini pieces of 9 served with   julienne salad & pudina chutney. The seekh kebabs were fantastic in terms of seasoning boasting with delectable flavours. Though we felt it to be a tad bit dry but it was very marginal. The taste of mutton was retained & it was not lost due to charring. Just a wonderful execution of a classic dish. Recommended.

2. Kabuli double roti - Upon the confusion regarding size of the afghani nan,the server recommended us to have the double roti which was basically a huge mixture of nan & thick roti. Rectangular in shape & huge in size it surely suffice both of us. The taste was really different than a normal naan/roti which you would find. However they could use some butter to retain the softness of the roti since it really gets hard after some moment otherwise a wonderful bread item to have with gravy side dish.

3. Afghani Chicken - The server recommended this to have it along with our kabuli double roti & oh boy it surely did not disappoint us. A rich creamy gravy dish consisting of 12 chicken chunks(round about break up of 6 normal chicken pieces). The gravy was very subtle in taste yet pack full of flavours and the chicken was cooked to perfection. The presence of cream & tomato gave a great texture. A bit oily but the taste of the dish would totally give you a mouthgasm.

The food being offered here is certainly different with what you would get in north indian cuisine. All the prices in the menu are tax inclusive(No extra GST will be charged). However they charge 10% extra on your total bill if you dine in the family AC section above. The service was okayish & could be improved upon in my opinion. I would revisit this place surely to try more of their menu.

P.S. The menu given in zomato is outdated in terms of items.

Popped in for a quick lunch around 4 today. 
Not hard to find. Tye place is not very big has around 30 seats i guess. But the place is not clean. Tables were full of dirt. They should look into it.if they want to make a place like arsalan. Hygiene is must.

Coming to the food ordered mutton kabuli polau combo ,it has muttn keema small portion, kabulia naan and muttn polau.
Keema was fantastic and yummy,naan was okyish,polau was very good, aromatic rice very soft and tatsy with a decent soft pc of muttn. Enjoyed the food vry much. Will be back fr kababs . 

Pls look in the cleanliness and hygiene thats all

Been to this place last Sunday . Reached at around 8:30 pm . The restaurant was empty . 
The place is shabby and not somewhere you would like to dine with your family . 
We ordered Murgh Siji , Kadhai Murg and their Kabuli Naan . All the above mentioned items were good and I loved it . Next we wanted to order a Kabuli Pulao but it wasn't available so we ordered a biryani and we were disappointed . It was nowhere even average . 

The service is not good . They are very inattentive and also unprofessional .

This is again a highly underrated restaurant in Park Circus, serving Afghani Food. We had Kabuli Roti, which was huge...Single was enough for 2, Kabuli Mutton Pulao, this was almost like Biriyani, though flavours were different, Chicken Karahi...this was definitely something new I tried, and was quite tasty even. Recommended. This place has an air conditioned part as well, which is definitely better decorated, than its non Ac counterpart.

There is an Afghan proverb 'First food,then religion',how meaningful this is you only get to know If you try Afghani dishes.Located in the prime area of the city near Park Circus 7 point crossing 'Kabul Kolkata' is a small delicious piece of pure afghan origin.In starter,Murgh Afghani kabab was amazing,it's delicious and the taste is totally different from the as usual Indian chicken starters.A highly recommended of them.In main,Afghani Murgh Handi is a true winner,it's lipsmacking and wonderful with the big Afghani Naan.Mutton Keema was over the top,it's terrific with Double Roti.The place is tiny and ambience is not up to the mark,I think they need to work on it. As it is located on the main road side,it's little noisy.Otherwise the dishes were awesome,staffs were well mannered and service was prompt.Looking forward to try their Afghani Pulao with a better and cozy environment.

So yesterday we had our order parceled from this food joint. We had Kabuli pulao, chicken handi  and Afghani nun. We started off with the pulao. What it lacked apart from quantity was taste. The mutton piece smelled like garbage, even I doubt whether it was mutton at all. Now the pulao was nicely complemented by the foul smelling chicken handi,which unfortunately didn't have any chicken at all. Probably our acclaimed restaurant had mistakenly given us fried pieces of some tasteless fish instead of the chicken that we expected. And the gravy was oily,salty and disastrous. Next came the showstealer-Afghani nun! It left us with strained fingers and a half broken jaw. A must have for people who are willing to torture themselves. Well played, Kabul!

Kabul had been on my wish list for quite some time now, owing to its good zomato reviews. So today, along with a friend I made my way to this outlet(located conveniently near Park circus 7 point) and picked up our order (2 kabuli pulao, Chicken handi and Afghani Nun). And we set off for home to enjoy a sumptuous meal. What ensued this,however, was horrendous to say the least. I will start with the pulao. It tasted pretty bland, the mutton piece was smelly and wasn't soft at all. But the real surprise was the handi. What startled us was that instead of the succulent chicken pieces that we expected, what we were given turned out to be small chunks of fried fish(probably Basa). Yes, you read that right. THE CHICKEN HANDI DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE PIECE OF CHICKEN, WHAT WE GOT WERE SOME CHUNKS OF FRIED FISH COOKED IN A REVOLTING GRAVY! The Afghani nun comes next. It was shitty to say the least. We tried with all our might to tear off the hard as rock bread, our fingers ached and our teeth pained. And then we realized that let alone 3 people, this thing can even serve 10 people. That's because nobody would possibly be willing to have more than one bite of this rag. Shame on you people. Worst experience ever.

We visited this restaurant situated a few yards away from the park circus crossing on nabami afternoon.

The best part of this restaurant is their food
We ordered murg siji,kabuli nun,mutton biriyani,chicken biriyani and a chicken side dish.
All the items were just brilliant in taste.
Though I didn't like the murg siji,other people in my group liked it.
The ambience was okay,I would say very average 
The waiter was very attentive and polite.
Overall a big thumbs up to this place.

Kabul Kolkata is a small place (similar to the size of the Alibaba outlets)  located at Park Circus right at the base of the AJC Bose Road flyover (not too far from Arsalan) . The first impression that you get about this place is 'well , it doesn't really look like a place where a family can sit down and have food. Students , yes ; but a family , probably not ! Anyway , I was welcomed by the staff who were extremely nice and friendly . I told them that I needed food parceled for 5 people . They practically chose the food items for me. 1 biryani , 1 pulav , 1 naan , 2 rotis , 1 chicken gravy item and 1 mutton gravy item . Add 2 containers of phirni for dessert . Will this be sufficient for 5 adults and 1 kid , I asked . 'It will be more than enough' , they replied ! I was a little skeptical ! But as it turned out , they were right as we ended up wasting a bit of everything. The food was very tasty. It was the biggest piece of naan/roti that I have ever seen . The food was a little on the heavy side and probably not ideal for the health-conscious . But hey , every single item was so tasty ! What's more , I paid just 1100 for all of that ! Well , I will go there again ! U too should give it a shot !

A small place lurking in Circus Avenue. The interiors are very basic, but then again,these little pocket friendly delights wouldn't remain so if they suddenly went all Taj on you. 
We ordered  chicken siji,mutton roasch with keema,kabuli roti,chicken karahi, kabuli polao.Do exercise caution while ordering,the portions are huge. Chicken siji is a whole chicken baked in its own juices. Rotis are gigantic.
The dinner ended on a sweet note with their phirni,which thankfully comes in regular portions. The guy who took our orders was very helpful but also a bit prone to overestimate one's appetite.
So go to this new place if you crave a break from all that greasy butter masalas and munch away guilt free,as the stuff they make has no or very little oil. Bon appetite!

Don't judge this place by its looks. It doesn't look much from the outside but the food they serve packs a punch. There isn't much decor, no ambience at all. The service is quite fast.
Coming to the food

Murgh afghani: probably the highlight of the dinner.
They serve one whole chicken cut into 8 pieces. Soft juicy succulent chicken with very little oil served with pudina chutney and mayo. A must try dish.

Afghani naan: Be warned! Even the greatest foodie will have a tough time bringing down this beast. The naan is almost the size of my arm and it is enough for 4-5 people. As for the taste it is slightly different from the naans that I have tasted.

Murgh handi: 15 boneless pieces of chicken cooked in thick onion gravy. It was lip smacking delicious. Everyone loved it.

Mutton kabuli polao:  This dish was a huge disappointment. We were expecting something unique and spicey. But it turned out to be a very ordinary polao that everyone cooks at home with just a piece of mutton. It was simply basmati rice with carrots and chillies cooked in ghee. No spice at all. Also the mutton was a boiled piece of mutton with absolutely no flavoring.

Mutton rosh with keema: an odd dish. 1 huge piece of  mutton served with mutton keema. The keema was nice but mutton was okayish.

Mutton nihari: this isnt an afghani dish so its not on the menu. But they serve it anyway. The dish is a glorified mutton stew. Thats all. Bit more spicey than an ordinary stew. But it tastes nice. It has two pieces of mutton in it.

If you visit this place do try their kebabs and the naan.

We were very disappointed with their service at first,but they made it up soon with their mind-blowing food. You can't consider anything but food here.

I'll talk about the disappointing part at first. We had made a prior reservation for 7 people. We reached the place 20 minutes late owing to the traffic during pujas. There was no big table for us and a family of four were occupying the only table which could have accommodated us. We asked the man who was serving us to talk to that family as their food was not yet served,but they didn't make any such effort and said we have to adjust in small tables till they leave. One of their ACs was not working and the place was quite uncomfortable.

However, fortunately the big table was emptied later and we could shift there and have our meal more comfortably. We ordered :

1. Afghani naan : It was HUGE. One was sufficient for 5 people at least. It was crispy and tasty.

2. Chicken balki : A standard bharta like dish that tasted perfect with the naan.

3. Chicken handi : This was the standout item. The taste was so good. The tender chicken pieces were flavoured so nicely.

4. Mutton Kabuli Pulao : I don't like mutton. But I totally loved this. The mutton pieces were remarkably soft and the pulao was sweet and moist.

5. Chicken Afghani tikka kebab : They were very nice to make it seven pieces as they overheard us discussing how to share 6 pieces among 7 people. They didn't even charge extra for this. And the kebab was very well made.

Please go for the pulao everytime you visit Kabul.

Place easy to locate. Milk tea was too good at 10 rs only. Service fast. Ordered mutton kabuki pulao combo. Nan great. Keema was too good. Salad freshly cut. Pulao is too sweet and pale. It will better with keema. Very less spice used. But rice quality great. Kismis is very sweet. One Mutton piece which was very soft but too much sweet just like mutton sweet dish / desert. Small area.

Today evening , got some take away from them. Tasted their mutton kabuli pulao combo, and chicken handi. Also tried phirni. Taste was okay. The mutton piece in pulao was blunt in taste, though it was soft. Expected the piece to have more of meat than bone. Other dishes were okay, nothing to have the wow factor. May be i am tasting the afgani flavour or they will improve more with time. Also, no card swipe till now, remember to carry cash.

Experience during my first visit:
I visited the restaurant today with a friend. The restaurant was easy to locate after following the directions on Google Maps. It is right next to 7 Point Crossing. We chose to sit upstairs in the restaurant. The upper floor has comfortable seating in purple and black. The place is quite minimalistic in terms of decor.

Coming to the food, we chose to have the mutton kabuli pulao combo, one kabuli roti and anda gosht kadhai. Since the combo already has half a kabuli roti, our server recommended that we should upgrade the combo roti to full instead of taking another one. Along with roti, the combo also came with pulao, mutton keema and salad.

The food was brilliant! All the items were light but still very flavourful. I loved how the items were delicious even with less spice and oil. The quantity was quite@ good for the two of us who are moderate eaters. At the price charged, the quantity served was a great bargain.

The kabuli pulao was perfectly cooked and had a really nice taste. It had one big piece of mutton which was literally fall of the bone. The mutton served with the pulao actually melted in my mouth. Although similar in appearence to a biriyani, the pulao was better than any biriyani I have tried till date
The keema served alongside was fabulous! The keema had great texture and the preparation enhanced the meatiness of the mince. Adding a sprinkling of lemon juice elevated the flavour profile of the keema. The kabuli roti was huge and quite soft. We tore it into four pieces and proceeded to have it with the anda gosht kadai. The dish looked beautiful and comprised of mutton chunks cooked with eggs and tomato. It was a very different type of wholesome preparation.

Finally I must mention that their staff is super nice. The server was there at all times when needed. He came up twice while we were eating and enquired about whether we required anything. I really appreciate how we were given enough space to eat comfortably without a server coming around every two minutes. He was really polite and treated us well. He requested us to come again to try more dishes when we were leaving. While leaving we were asked by two more staff members about how the food was

Experience during my second visit
Following my 5 rating experience during my first visit, I recommended this place to my friend for a late lunch last month. As you can see, the experience was not as good leading me to change my rating to 3.5. We visited the restaurant around 4pm and ordered the kabuli pulao combo with anda gosht kadhai and dal gosht. None of the items stood out like they had before. In fact the kabuli naan was quite difficult to chew and took ages to swallow. The meat in the pulao was quite bland and the side dishes were simply oily and not too flavourful. I did not feel that the dal in the dal gosht added any flavour to the meet and it simply felt like some dal had just randomly been poured on meat.
Nonetheless the service was quick and the server was polite. The cost of the food was also light on the pocket. Probably visited them on a bad day but the change in quality of food saddened me. 
Also another thing I learnt recently is that restaurants are supposed to provide filtered drinking water at no cost to the customer and charge only if the customer requests bottled water. Kabul provides only bottled water and adds the cost to the bill. They should have some filtered water arrangement for those who don't want to have bottled water and at least mention at the start that the water will be charged separately.

A pre pujo lunch with office colleagues at Kabul Kolkata. My husband and I are frequent visitors at this place and we love the food here. We had mutton karahi and mutton karahi with egg with double roti. The food here is out of the world. The best part is you dnt feel heavy after eating there. We also packed a chicken saji and gobbled it in the evening. Also recommended are their dal ghost and nihari.

This place is a must visit for biriyani lovers. We had mutton biriyani and mutton kabuli pulao with mutton korma as side dish. Quality of mutton is very good. It's very soft that it literally melts in your mouth. 
One negetive part i would like to say. When I went there all food items were not available because their main chef was not there. 
So I'm looking forward for another visit as they promised me that I'll get whatever I want on my next visit.

Once in a while you come across places that touch your heart. For me that has been Kabul. With their food, hospitality, service and all those smiles, you are bound to find a little bit of affection grow in you from the moment you step in. By the time you leave the place, the affection will conquer both your heart and your mind. 

I tried plenty a things here. The favourite part of my meal was the kebabs, which included the Murgh Siji (the staple and the highlight), the Mahi Akbari and the extremely delicious Murgh Afghani. 

The kebabs are nothing like what you have had at other places across the city  absolutely different and absolutely delicious. 

For the main course we settled for a huge set of options. We loved the kabuli meal, which comes with a plate of Kabuli Polao, Rajma, Kofta, Salad and roti. It is a complete meal and will require two people to bring it to an end. 

Other favourites from the menu included the Murgh Handi, Mutton Roash, Afghani naan (bigger than your arm), and the Nihari. 

Every spoon is as lovely as the one before. Goign back definitely and you should too.

I heared a lot about this place... And the stories are really interesting... We all know about the Kabuliwalas... We all know about their profession... But time has changed and so the profession too... Now they are trying their hands in F&B industry... And belive me guys they are throwing serious challenge to the others... As far my knowledge is concern... They are the first who introduced "Authentic Afgani Cuisine" in kolkata... The chef himself is from Kabul and he is doing wonders... It's my gurantee that you will never return disheartened from this place... Also you will blown away with the service and the heart touching behavior of the Kabuliwalas... Go and give it a try...

Now coming straight to the food...

💝 Chicken Siji~ It was the Afgani style chicken roast where no oil is used for roasting it... The oil that comes out from the chicken skin during roasting is the cooking the dish itself... It is very very healthy and good for diabetic patients... It is served as a whole in a plate... You need to crush it and don't forget to sprinkle the dry grapes masala over it... Yes they serve it with it... And also use the dip they are serving for enjoying it to the fullest...

💝 Afgani Murgh~ It will look like traditional reshmi kebab... But tastes completely different...

💝 Mahi Akbari~ One of the best fish kebab I ever had... Crunchy outside soft and super juicy inside... It's hard to believe that Rui mach can be so much tasty...

★ Mutton Seekh Kebab~ Lovely one too...

💝 Afgani Murgh Handi~ So yummy n tasty... Perhaps the best handi I still had...

💝 Murgh Balkhi~ Another twist... It will resemble with our all time love chicken bharta... But again taste very very different... Mind blowing...

💝💝💝 Mutton Roash~ This is the dish I never had before... And what a dish it was... A full chunk of mutton rosted with minimal spice so that it doesn't kill the flavor of the mutton... And with it they serves an mind blowing mutton keema... Just wonderful... Heavenly...

💝 Mutton Nihari~ Awesome one... But have it after adding some corriender leaves, chopped green chillis n ample amount of lemon in it... This three things enhance the flavour to the next level...

💝 Mutton Kabuli Pulao~ Read carefully... If you order this dish... It will come up with a huge portion of tasty pulao with a full size yummy mutton, a big size naan, a katori of rajma, another katori of mutton kofta n green salad... All this for INR 200.00... Yes I'm not kidding... And boy... The whole combination is a killer...

💝 Afgan Naan~ We had all the gravy items with this one... Gone perfectly with all the above... Now it was a 3 layer naan... And it was huge in size... Huge means huge... You can also get the same in 1 & 2 layer also...

💝 Green Tea~ We ended our Kabul food voyage with this healthy drink... Which was a must after having all these delicacies... I recommend this one for all...

I didn't Recommended any of the dishs separately only because they all are highly recommend... You need to try all of them... It may take a single visit in a group or a number of solo visits... Choice is yours... And yes it was pretty pocket friendly... Also I can assure you that you can't get this kind of quality n quantity anywhere in Kolkata with such unique taste of Afganistan... So don't wait, go n get...

You guys may be little curious about the rating... It was only because of the decor n hygiene part... Which needs a lot of improvement... Thats all...

This Mughali -Afghani gem lies hidden near the 7-point Park Circus crossing .The modest outlet provides the best kebabs and Kabuli preparations one can find in Kolkata .
I visited this place with a couple of friends after hearing much about their mouth watering delicacies and the very affordable rate card .

                               -------------------
Starters -

   • Chicken Siji

   • Afghani murgh 

    • Mahi Akbari 

     • Mutton seekh kebab 

All the items were as tasty as it sounds .The kebabs are strictly something you just can't afford to miss here .Personal favourite was Chicken Siji.

Main course -

 • Afghani murgh handi 

 • Mutton Roash

 • Mutton nihari

  • Murgh balkhi

  • Mutton Kabuli pulao

  • Kabuli roti

 • Rumali roti 

 • Afghani naan

 
Pros -
  
✓While Afghani Naan came out to be absolutely splendid it tasted best with Afghani murgh handi and mutton nihari .I will definitely recommend these items to you .
✓Mutton Kabuli pulao is by far the best pulao I have had in a mughlai restaurant .The taste is still lingering on my tongue tip ! 
 ✓The affordability of food in this place is the key reason why you should visit this place .Good quality food served in large proportions and in such cheaper rate is a rarety in Kolkata . 

Overall I will definitely recommend you this Jewel of a place which immediately gives you an experience of Kabul in Kolkata. Mr Khan who served us here really needs a special mention here for his hospitality.

Location : At park circus 7 point crossing, take the road which takes you toward Minto park. Enter that road, you'll find Haji Ali and Arsalan; Kabul Kolkata is just on the opposite side of them.

Decor & Ambience : The restaurant is 2 storeyed. Decor is nothing to write home about and ambience is okayish. But hey, you don't visit such a place for a fine done experience. If you're here for a true gastronomical experience, read on.

So I wanted to visit this place for a long time. I had watched a few videos of Kabul Kolkata on YouTube and was well aware that such a place exist. This restaurant is run by the Kabuliwalas of Kolkata. Kabuliwalas are originally from Afghanistan who came here as refugees or to do business. Few months back this restaurant was revamped but they have kept the food as authentic as they can.

Food :

* Chicken siji : Chicken siji or sajji is basically an Afghani style chicken roast. Minimal spices are rubbed on the chicken, a long metal seekh is inserted through the whole chicken and cooked very slowly on the side of an open fire. The heat from the fire cooks the chicken. Such slow roasting ensures two things : 1) it keeps the chicken nice and moist on the inside.
2) it makes the chicken skin incredibly crispy.
The chicken was removed from the sheekh, given a bash and served with a sprinkling of chaat masala. It tasted out of this world. Not overly Spicy but it's hard to not like tender meat and crispy skin.

* Mahi akbari : Oh my god. Don't get me started on this one. Katla fish pieces, rubbed with spices & grilled to perfection was served. It is one of the best fish preparations I've ever had. The fish was spicy, tangy and just simply amazing. The fish was not deboned and the pieces were quite fatty And that is flavour.

*Afghani murgh : This is not the your regular Afghani kebab that you get in other restaurants. Authentic Afghani chicken kebab. The kebab literally melts in your mouth.

*Mutton Nihari : I'm a huge fan of Nihari. It is exactly the bowl of goodness that you need on a chilly morning. I don't like to have Nihari during the summers though. However, this Nihari was extremely flavourful & the meat literally fell off the bone. The consistency of the Nihari was bang on. Loved it.
Pro tip : squeeze in the lime, add the chopped coriander leaves for an enhanced taste.

*Mutton Roash : You won't get this dish anywhere else in Kolkata. Or even if you manage to find one, I'm sure it won't be as amazing as they do it in here. So this dish is basically a whole cooked head of a goat, served along side it's minced meat. The head of the goat is a delicacy not only in our neighbouring countries but also in European and American countries. Even in India, goat head is consumed in most rural areas. The idea is every part of an animal should be used and not thrown away. Anyway, I loved loved this dish. This one is a must try.

*Afghani murgh handi : I have never had anything like this before. This totally different from the handi you get in other restaurants. The gravy was thick, creamy,buttery and yougurt-y. Although, the boneless chicken pieces were a tad overcooked, I loved this dish.

*Mutton Kabuli pulao : Loved this one. Each rice grain was beautifully cooked and it was not spicy at all. In true Afghani way, Fried carrot Juliennes and nuts were sprinkled on the top. They served this dish with a ate of Afghani rajma preparation and a mutton kofta dish and salad. All this for just 200 bucks. Steal deal I must say.

*Afghani naan : It is huge. Like really huge. Like really really really really huge. And heavy. Very heavy. And it goes perfectly well with the gravies and the kebabs. For 60 bucks, you get this 3 layered naan. For 40 bucks, you'll get a 2 layered naan. For 20 bucks you'll get a simple single layer naan.

Service : Amazing hospitality. The owners are the most humble people I've ever met. Talking to them I could sense how passionate they were about their food and how they have accepted Kolkata over the years just as Kolkata has accepted the Kabuliwalas. They are amazing amazing people. This restaurant bags a heavy reccomendation. Cheers!

Kabul Kolkata is a Mughali and Afghani restaurant located near Park Circus 7 point crossing. This outlet will look like a very ordinary eatery with an air-conditioned dining area upstairs and a non air-conditioned in the ground floor. They have hardly 5-6 tables in total. But who would knew that after the day I visited this restaurant, this will become one of my favourite Mughlai restaurant in town. 
I went with my family and we ordered the following -
1. Chicken Saji - This is a full chicken, roasted and fried in a way that is crisp from outside and soft from inside, this fried chicken might just give a tough competition to joints like KFC.
2. Afghani murgh- a dish from the starters menu, a dish from Afghan cooked in Indian spices and the big chicken pieces would melt in your mouth with all its juice. 
3. Mahi Akbari- Undoubtedly the best fish item I have ever had till date. Rohu fish, fried in such a way with a perfect amount of spices, I wanted to have more and more of it. 
4. Mutton Seekh Kebab - mutton kebabs cut in long pieces served with pudina and mayo dip. These are not like the ordinary mutton kebabs, the chef has given his own touch to make it stand out of any ordinary mutton kebab.
5. Afghani naan - huge naan slices to go perfectly with the meat dishes. It's not like any other kind of naan that we order in restaurants.
6. Kabuli roti- firstly, the sight of this huge roti is a wonder to watch. It is so huge that one is enough for a whole family. It's thick and perfectly compliments with the meat items.
7. Mutton kabuli pulao- Mutton pulao made by the kabuliwalas with their own dash of spices to make it taste like heaven.
8. Mutton Nihari - This is a mutton stew cooked in a watery gravy with juicy and soft mutton pieces. It goes very well with the pulao.
9. Mutton Roash - thick red gravy cooked in Indian spices, rich in taste and together with the kabuli roti tastes brilliant.
10. Afghani Murgh handi- Diced chicken in thick yellow gravy with butter, the tender juicy chicken won't make you regret to have one extra piece.
11. Murgh balkhi - A chicken dish, with diced chicken cooked in rich and thick gravy with spices and herbs in a perfect manner. The rotis, pulao and all the meat dishes make perfect combinations.
They have a wholesome platter system as well which includes pulao, Rajma, murgh dish, roti and salad for just 200. The ambience doesn't matter when the main purpose of eating is served with delicious food. The service is commendable, staff is approachable and always ready at your service. The presentation of the dishes is ordinary but it can all be neglected as the quality and quantity of food is top notch. The taste is so impressive that I will surely take every friend of mine to eat here and try all the dishes. The best part in this whole thing is that all the dishes are available in economical prices. They won't even fall heavy on your pocket. You are surely not to miss out on this eatery if you are a meat lover. Highly recommended from my side!

Hidden Gem of the City.
I have tried a lot of places in town but I must say this place is among one on my top 10. We went in a group and tried a lot of things here, and each food items were so fantastic, that we couldn't concentrate on anything but food.
Starters :
* Chicken Siji : Whole chicken roasted for hours, juicy, soft and just wonderful.
* Afghani Murgh
* Mahi Akbari : excellent, Rui fish roasted by keeping in side of over for long time. What a wonderful taste it was.
* Mutton Sekh Kebab : I haven't tasted Mutton sekh kabab so good before.
.
Mains :
* Afghani Murgh Handi
* Murgh Balki
* Mutton Roash
* Mutton Kabuli Polao : excellent
* Afghani Naan
.
Everything was perfect and cooked with huge care, we enjoyed each of them. You can blindly order any of these that ai have mentioned and I am sure you won't regret.
The most striking feature here is their price, each of the dish is very very low cost and reasonable.
We had a great time. Will be back again.
And we needed their Green tea at the end to complete our meal, as the Green tea here is very popular we couldn't afford to miss it.

This is truly a hidden gem of kolkata fot the people who loves Afghani food, located near park
circus 7 point crossing.Take the road towards Exide then you will find this place to your
right side. This is a simple roadside restaurant with no fancy decoration. Seating arrangements are decent. The main highlight of this place is that they prepare the food almost without any oil. Me with my girlfriend went there for lunch. At first we were not that satisfied by the decoration of this place but that concept was totally changed after we tasted the food.

We Ordered : Chicken Afghani Kebab, Mutton Rosh with Keema, Chicken Karahi and one huge kabuli roti.

# Chicken Afghani kebab was nicely marinated 4 juicy pieces of chicken grilled to perfection in a tandoor. Served with Salad and green chutney. The kebab was not like all other traditional kebab preparations. It had a very unique taste. Chicken was soft and succulent.

# Mutton rosh is their signature dish. Though we felt that the mutton was little bit smelly.
One big chunk of mutton with bone cooked slowly for hour with very less spices. served with 
minced mutton cooked in lots of spices and green chilies. The mutton was ridiculously tender and the keema(minced mutton) took the dish to a different level.

# Chicken karahi was a delicious spicy dish. Pieces of chicken was cooked well in a rich gravy with a variety of spices in it. It was slightly tangy due to the heavy usage of tomato in the gravy. Chicken pieces were succulent and juicy and it melted in mouth. 

# Kabuli roti was made of plain flour. The size was big enough for two people.

Overall a must try place for all the food lovers. The owner was really humble and suggested us the dishes. Staffs were decent and the service was prompt. Prices were reasonable regarding the quality and quantity of the dishes. 
Highly recommended.........

Kabul Kolkata is one of the hidden gem of Kolkata, serves authentic Afghani dishes. Located in Park circus 7-point crossing just below of AJC Bose Road Flyover. In Kolkata it’s hard to find good Afghani restaurant, and Kabul Kolkata will definitely fill the gap. Thanks to Kabul Kolkata, the foods from the land of Kabuliwala is now in our reach of hand. 

The Owner Hasan Khan wants to introduce Afghani food to the people of Kolkata and for that purpose he has got a special Chef Gul Mohammad from Kabul to give us a real taste of Kabul.

Recently we visited the place for a tasting event and the experience was very fascinating. The taste of Afghani cuisine was unique, the spices they used and the food was very less oily yet purely delicious. Spices play a big role in Afghani Cuisine. They used different typically Afghani Spices in the food which act as taste boostup.

The décor of this place is very ordinary, from outside its looks dull but I am pretty sure, it doesn’t even matter after you get the taste of food they have to offer.

Our tasting session starts with,

Kabuli Naan- It was a huge roti with carving decoration, all over itself, made with flour, almonds, cashews, raisins mixed with powdered milk, curd and butter. It was very soft, went perfectly with any gravy item or Mutton Seekh Kebabs. One naan is enough to serve 4-5 people.

Kabuli Seekh Kebabs- Small size mutton pieces marinated with different spices and then putted in a flat metal skewer and grilled perfectly in tandoor. The kebabs were little bit stiff not very soft, but taste wise simply superb. The best way to enjoy seekh kebab is to wrap it with roti and then eat it.

Grilled Rohu- Full size Rohu fish marinated with different spices and herbs and grilled nicely, they used a special spice made from dried anjeer at the time of serving with made the whole thing fingerlicking. The outside was very crispy and from inside it was very soft.  

Murgh Siji- This is a must try dish for kebabs and tandoor lovers. Whole chicken roasted with spices and salt, no oil or butter used. Little bit dry but very soft and superbly delicious. Try with coriander chutney and mayo.  It is something you definitely want to have again!

Afghani Murgh Handi- Chunks of chicken marinated with spices and after that cooked in a spicy creamy gravy. Chicken pieces were very soft.  Full of flavour and very delicious. Perfect gravy item to try with naan. 

Afghani Chicken and Mutton Kadai- This preparation can be made with chicken and mutton. Very spicy preparation. Less gravy, little bit oily. Taste wise simply awesome, specially Mutton Kadai was too good. Tender mutton pieces will melt in your mouth in no time. This preparation is rich traditional Afghani Preparation. Try it with Afghani pulao.

Nihari- Slowly cooked mutton with bone marrow in a medium spicy stew. This preparation is blessing for your taste buds. Mutton was very soft, and stew was really delicious. They used less oil to make it healthier. Served with green coriander leaves, green chillies from top. 

Mutton Roash- This was the first time I tried this preparation and it was like love at first sight. A huge portion of mutton (Leg piece) cooked low and slow until the meat was full-apart tender. It was beautifully juicy and tender. They roasted the mutton without oil. You can choose your quantity from 250gm, 500gm or order for a full rann as well. They also added mutton keema with this preparation which made it even more mouthwatering. Try it with naan or kabuli roti as you like. A must try dish.

Finally, for the dessert they offer a special chutney made with dry fruits. It was there Ramadan special dessert. A perfect way to finish this delicious tasting event. 

If you love to eat Mughlai foods, then you need to try Afghani cuisine. It is slightly different from as usual Mughlai food we have. A lovely experience we have in Kabul Kolkata. The hospitality was amazing and Co-Owner Zoab Khan was very friendly, told us many story about afghan cuisine. Well come and try these amazing dishes, (Mutton Roash, Murgh Siji) in Kabul Kolkata and introduce your taste buds with the taste from Land of Kabuliwalas.  
 Great time spend with team Panchphoron.

Very good mughlai cuisine at reasonable price. 
The attic seating arrangement in this restaurant is nice and offers privacy. 
Although on a rainy day, the roof might lick!
The food is fresh and nice .
We ordered 
Murgh malai tikka which are spiced succulent pieces of chicken prepared with yoghurt. Excellent. 
Mutton keema, was like normal qeema that you get anywhere sense. 
Mutton rosh,  is a big succulent chunk of mutton with dry dal, was very good! 
The mutton pulao was nice with the extra flavor from fats they use for preparing it. 
The kabuli roti was humongous and soft and tasty.. 
All these asking with a bottle of coke cost us 950, it was a non tax transaction. 
Good lunch at reasonable price.

A little and small firecracker, a place which serves delicious and fingerlicking Afghan food has slowly turned out to be one of my favourites and rightly so. The food here is subtle, mostly devoid of unnecessary oil, and yet tastes so devouring. It's like paradise coming to Earth, with its humbleness and unmatched aura.


Very recently we were invited for a little sampling and tasting session, but little did I know then I was perhaps going for the best treat of my life. The first appearance went for a mixture of dry fruits, duly assorted in a small serving container. Ever heard of the story of the famous Kabuliwala? How the Afghans came over to this country, kept wandering over and doing business? All they mostly had to feed themselves throughout the day was this assortment of dry fruits. Not only this was hearty and heavy, this gives you the perfect boost of energy for you to energize yourself. This was foĺlowed by a giant roti, with carvings, decorations and artwork all over itself. 


This Kabuli Naan was served with Afghani Murgh Handi. A simple yet flavorful preparation, one would surely be amazed by how simpke and convenient such preparations can be without the use of much oil and least amount of spices. The grilled chunks of chicken was soft and had the right amount of marination to create a ripple of flavours in the tastebuds.


The next serving was in the form of a Kebab. Ever heard or tried the comforting tale of a Tandoori Chicken? Well this was more of a simplistic version of the above, only cooked with least amount of spices and was completely devoid of any oil. The entire Chicken was cooked and roasted in its own skin and what follows afterwards is the gentle sprinkling of Afghan spices made from dry Anjeer. This Masala does not have any dry mango powder in it and thus gives a completely different set of flavours to your senses.

A place of authentic Afghani cuisine right at the Park Circus area,the biriyani hub of Kolkata.What made the first impression is the courteous attendant who helped us by downsizing our order as the amount in each dish is even difficult for three persons to finish.The kabab,giant size Kabuli naan,keema & polao tasted wow.With three namkin lassis the total bill was an unbelievable Rs 550 only.Wish the place was more spacious.For every other thing,loved the place.

It's a small restaurant run by the Afghans of Kolkata. The restaurant is cozy with separate section upstairs for families. And the food is just amazing and 100% authentic. Portions are appropriate. I went alone and ordered Chicken Karahi (250g) and one full naan. The staff insisted that I get it in two rounds and it was a good idea. The naan is actually really huge. The chicken was very different with less oil and spice and a tomato based tangy gravy. It's light on your stomach but still takes your taste buds on a joyous and ecstatic ride.

“The Kabuliwalas are Back!”

Today, I have been to a restaurant named Kabul Kolkata which places itself near Park Circus 7 point crossing just below the AJC Bose Flyover and did transformed my life. It dishes authentic Afghani cuisine and has genuine cook belonging from Afghanistan.

While, I wanted the name to add a “To” in between, the warmness of the owner, stall and the whole people out there, made my mood so light that the need for complaint vanished into thin air.

It fancies a full air conditioned restaurant with the upper seating arrangement for the couple and privacy concerned individuals. The décor isn’t out of the world but decent enough for one to please their senses.

We went inside, made ourselves seated and ordered for Murg Afghani Kebab, Afghani Mutton Karahi and 4 Kabuli Roti for four of us. The waiter insisted us to order only three and refused to take order Kabuli Double Roti citing that it will be too heavy for all of us. And well, he was damn right. The whole order was followed by four glasses of Lassi.

He requested us to wait for fifteen minutes for the order to be prepared and our meal came as expected without any delay. The rotis was indeed huge and it seemed a 2.5x of a standard tandoori. The Murg Afghani Kebab was delicious and Afghani Mutton Karahi was covered with mouth licking masalas. However, there were two type of chutney which indeed made my day – Coriander Leaves Chutney & Mayonnaise Chutney both individually prepared with customised spices. The salad provided with the kebab were fresh and tasty. The Lassi however did not taste that good. The food was too cost and the pocket pinch was more than reasonable.

To rate the food according to the items, it will stand like:

Afghani Roti – 5 / 5
Murg Afghani Kebab – 4 / 5
Afghani Mutton Karahi – 4.5 / 5
Lassi – 2 / 5
Coriander Leaves Chutney – 4.5 / 5
Mayonnaise Chutney – 5 / 5
** Pocket Pinch – 5 / 5

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Definitely you should visit them as they provide authentic Afghani dishes. The cook and even the waiter are Afghani people.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) The outlet as well as the food are really good and they deserve high ratings. However, the place isn’t that spacious which made me deduce half a star.

** I could not add pictures of food being served on a plate as I visited the places with uncles and granddads, who consider clicking pictures when food is on plate, as a bad habit.

Amazing food. The gigantic naan is a real center piece to the table of yummy mouth watering dishes.. A small place at the park circus crossing which I had passed umpteen number of times, but never thought of visiting until a friend introduced us to it. It's definitely a hidden gem in the heart of the city..
