What can you say about this place.... one word 'Common', in every aspect.... The taste and quality is average even in it's own category.... Not gonna visit again....

One of the many biriyani places that you will find when you're travelling along the Andul Road.
Seating is not available and the food is only for take-away. The biriyani and the chicken chaap are the only thing which are reliable and it's not disappointing consistent cheap price they offer.good for a quick meal
