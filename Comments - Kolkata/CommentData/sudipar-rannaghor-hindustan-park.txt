Worst experience ever!!! Prices are like 5 star hotels and the quality of food is worst than the roadside dhabas...
This restaurant should be closed down immediately for such poor service and quality....

Was apprehensive about visiting the place due to its poor rating but was impressed by the food and the behaviour of the staff. Irrespective of the who the owner is, I feel it's a good enough restaurant but pricey.

Living in Bangalore,I can't say that I have tasted the food...however,my wife goes to Calcutta often. The food at Sudipa's is far too expensive....nothing great & the Restaurant has a space crunch. I happen to watch Thurs 21st Dec Ranna Ghar on TV....was appalled to see that 2 varieties of PATTIES were served & that they were DEEP FIRED! When are patties deep fried?? There was no mention of BAKING ! They all turned out to be like shiney tele bhaja found in local melas & Sealdah station. No rolling out & rerolling of the dough, the Patty base was an "off the shelf" ready made outer casing ,cooked by 2 Ladies, one of who was trying to impress the audience with her Spanish & the other  was going overboard singing Sudipa's culinary praises....O M G !! Grow up Lady & stop over powering the Invited participants with your silly chit chat & your superior air !! Thanks.

Wow..... An absolute shame in the name of Bengali Cuisine which has worldwide impression. 

Where the other restaurants are competing with freshness and taste and you are cheating customers with rotten foods?

Raised complaint about rotten fish but they are not concerned about it. It was their policy not to exchange. Lol.

Results? look your score card here.

The rating in zomato is already below 2 which is very difficult..... Cant find any other resturant with such rating... In spite of that went to the place bcoz parents insisted (thanks to the TV show)... And now I know why they managed such rating.... Ridiculous is one word.... Not talking abt the taste as nothing to talk abt..... What I want to talk about is they charged Rs 1000 per head for buffet with only 2 non veg in the spread & one of them is katla maach.. The mutton was chewy.... So basically nothing to eat.. Horrible....

এই ধরুন পুজোর আগে একদিন, এক মাসের দ্বিতীয় শনিবার আমার মা আমাকে নিয়ে চল্লেন সুদীপার রান্নাঘরে খেতে। সেইখানে নাকি শনি-রোববারে "আনলিমিটেড বুফে" চলে, আর আইটেমও নাকি দাআআরুণ। তিনি যাবেন বলছেন বহুদিন আগে থেকেই, কিন্তু জোম্যাটোতে 1.4 রেটিং দেখে আমি ক্রমাগত এড়িয়েই যাচ্ছিলুম। কিন্তু কপালে রাহু থাকলে কে সামলাবে???
তাঁর ক্রমশঃ মনে হতে লাগলো আমি তাঁকে নিয়ে যাবো না বলেই নানারকম বাহানা করছি, আমি আসলে ঘরকুনো মানুষ, মায়ের সঙ্গে বেরোতে হলেই আর টাইম হয় না ইত্যাদি ইত্যাদি এবং এই প্রসঙ্গে বারংবার আমার স্বর্গত বাবার সঙ্গে আমার তুলনা টানা হতে লাগলো।

তা সত্যিই আমি একটু কুঁড়ে গোছের মানুষ, বুঝেছেন তো??? ছুটির দিনে কোথাও বেরোতে খুব একটা ইচ্ছে করে না। তাও টেনেটুনে মুখ ব্যাজার করে গেলুম। বল্লে বিশ্বাস যাবেন না, কালীঘাট Metro স্টেশনে নামতেই, সে কি আকাশভাঙা বৃষ্টি.!! আসলে তখন বুঝিনি জানেন, যে প্রকৃতিমাতাও আমাদের বাধা দেওয়ার চেষ্টা করছিলেন। তবে এতে আমার মাকে দমানো গেলো না, তিনি তাঁর লক্ষ্যে অনড় রইলেন (প্রকৃত বীরের মতই)। 

ভিজে স্নান করে আমরা পৌঁছলাম সেই দ্রৌপদীপীঠে, ছাতা গুটিয়ে রিসেপশনের পাশে রেখে ঢুকলুম ভিতরে। জানা গেলো আজ বুফেই হবে শুধু, আ লা কার্টের কোনো ব্যবস্থা নেই। তা না হোক গে, বুফেই সই। আমি নিলুম নিরামিষ বুফে (এটাকে শনিবারের বাধ্যতামূলক ধর্মাচরণ ভাববেন না যেন, আসলে আমি নিরামিষ খেতে ভালোবাসি এবং আমার ষষ্ঠ ইন্দ্রিয় কেন জানিনা আমাকে সতর্ক করছিল যে নিরামিষ পদগুলো কম অখাদ্য হবে), মা নিলো আমিষ।
তারপরে, এলো সেই মাহেন্দ্রক্ষণ।
একটা প্লাস্টিকের ছোট্ট গ্লাসে করে ঘোল, ওপরে একটুকরো লেবু ভাসছে। (তখনই বোঝা উচিৎ ছিলো কেমন ঘোলটি খাওয়াবে)।
তারপরে এলো স্টার্টার হিসাবে মোচার চপ (আমার) এবং ফিশফ্রাইয়ের ক্ষুদ্র সংস্করণ (মায়ের জন্য)। স্বাদ খারাপ নয়।
তারপরে কচুরি, আলুরদম। আলুরদমটা খাওয়ার যোগ্য নয়, কারণ আলুগুলোকে যৌথ প্রচেষ্টাতেও ভাঙা গেলো না।
তারপর এলো পোলাও, ঠিক যেন ঠাণ্ডা ভাতে ঘি মেখে দিয়ে দিয়েছে। দুই-দুই চার চামচের বেশি গলাঃধকরণ করা গেলো না, তেমনই একটা বোঁটকা গন্ধ।
সঙ্গে দু-টুকরো শিশু ধোঁকা (আমার), দুটুকরো সফেদ চিকেন (মায়ের)। এইখানে এসেই বোঝা গেলো আমার ব্রেন কতোটা ধারালো, কারণ ধোঁকার টুকরো দুটো চিকেনের চাইতে কম অখাদ্য ছিলো। সফেদ চিকেনের পিসদুটো হাড়সর্বস্ব, এবং এতোই মনমাতানো স্বাদ যে আমরা আর নেওয়ার সাহস দেখালাম না। যাইহোক, এই দুটো আইটেমই দুজনে শেয়ার করে খেলাম, থুড়ি খাওয়ার চেষ্টা করলাম। তাতে ব্যর্থ হয়ে ভাবলাম ডেসার্টের দিকে এগোনো যাক।

ডেসার্টের প্রথমেই খুব সম্ভবত দই ছিলো এক চামচ করে, এতোই বনস্পতি মেশানো যে খাওয়ার অযোগ্য।
নেক্সট আইটেম কালো ক্ষীরের গজা, আমার বেশ ফেভারিট মিষ্টি। কিন্তু এক কামড় খেয়েই উৎসাহ নিভে গেলো, ময়রা ভুল করে ভিতরে ময়দাই ঠেসেছেন, অন্য পদার্থ পেলাম না। সবশেষে মাদার ডেয়ারির নলেনগুড়ের আইসক্রিম দু-চামচ করে, যেটার গুণাগুণ বিচারের অবস্থায় এতোক্ষণের যুদ্ধবিধ্বস্ত আমরা আর ছিলাম না।
তারপরে এলো বিল, আঠারোশ' টাকা মাত্র। তখনই মনে হচ্ছিলো জানেন, যে আঠারোশ'টা একটাকার কয়েন গিলে খেলে এর চাইতে বেশি ভালো হত।

পুনশ্চঃ আমার মা বাড়ি ফেরার পথে "ওলা করবি??" ছাড়া দ্বিতীয় কোনো কথা বলেন নি।

Since I don't have an option to thumbs down, so I'm rating it a single star. Basically a substandard, overpriced restaurant which offers rotten food. Like the owner like the product. The owner and the staffs are cheap sinisters. Using the brand name of Zee Bangla's cookery show is the last resort for them. There are multiple Bengali restaurants in Kolkata nowadays. Only if you want to make a fool of yourself and allow the theives to cut your pocket, then choose this one. I will never visit this place ever again. I give a shit to deceit Sudipa the baby elephant.
BTW they have food items for Dogs too in their menu. Next time on wards carry your pets and make it a restaurant for dogs.

An important aspect of travel is to try the local cuisine. But in an alien city, how to find a place that serves authentic regional food in a pleasant, clean ambiance and at reasonable prices? No wonder, a traveler is often baffled. We are making it easy for our Delhi-Fun-Dos readers. We recently visited “Sudipar Rannaghar”, a restaurant serving Bengali food in Kolkata and here is our account.

Cant find a rating lower so 1 will have to do.
Visiting from overseas after years away - missed our fantastic Bengali cooking and heard this is a famous great restaurent owned by a celibrity chef (REALLY?) so we went looking for it tohave lunch. Found it neat, clean and some art on the walls good sign I thought.

Where do I start? Service - lotsa staff but not at all service trained (customer service is an alien term for them.) Staff outnumbered guests - but they made 4 of us squeeze next to another family of 4 who spilled out of their space. Should have taken that as an OMEN and left then.
When ordering we said we dont want too hot spicy but definitely not sweet. Wasted my breath!
Mochar chop arrived - good size, too much haldi - tasted very ordinary and even that is a compliment. Dal was served - but we hadnt ordered any - server insisted we had ordered dal. Went to check order and admitted he was wrong and took it away. Dahi begun was good - not exceptional but tasty enough. That was the dish we could eat some rice with at least - else we would go hungry. I asked the server to give me very little rice because I wanted to save tummy space for the dishes. 
Dhokar dalna arrived - was dry round the edges and had gone off . They could have said dont order this. Mochar ghonto was ok -if not tasty and had mouldy bori. I waited for Golda chingri looked good in the menu card (we dont get golda chingri where we live). It was not fresh and small. Been telling my overseas friends that food is so fresh here they are cooked and eaten before they see a fridge!
We had almost finished and the muri ghoto was still not ready. One of us actually left the table. The muri ghonto arrived - looked like watery kechuri. Still I thought lets give it a try. It was like a sweet dish and watery. Perhaps thats to someone's flavour. But not ours. We raised our disappointment to the staff - they called the Manager -he said ring him when we come again and he will take good care of us - sure we will return - when the sun rises in the west. I said to them - one dish coule be a mistake - but so many mistakes? I suppose they needed my donation.

I would give a zero if it was possible... We ordered a takeaway on ashtami evening, consisting of Basanti polao, mochar chop, bhaja moshala aloo r Dom, koraisuti diye dhokar danla, and kumror halwa. 
The aloor dom which was completely stale and putrid.... And the smell itself wafting from it was enough to run from the room, 
The Basanti polao was edible, and the rest of it... Not upto the mark. Special mention was the kumror halwa which I was assured was the best in the menu.... Was absolutely rubbish and horrible... 
The worst ever dining experience ... I wonder whether they would have served such good on the table.... Or was it a takeaway special??? 
PS I had called to tell them about the food... And the man on the phone flatly told me it wasn't possible... As if I would deliberately lie.... And for what? I wasn't asking for any refund or anything... Just informing them of their shortcomings

Worst. I have visited with family and after a-la-carte, order 2 rosogolla for my kid, without checking the price. To my surprise, bill comes Rs 120 for 2 rosogolla + tax. It should not cost Rs. 10 or 15 each in some very good sweet shop also. Service is also worst. Food was testy, but not at all upto the standard, specially the price they ae taking for it. I want to give 0 rating for this restaurant :😠

Considering that Ms Sudipa is such a loved and respected name in Bengal, I expected high standards. Was thoroughly disappointed. My parents wanted to go there, specially my mom, so took them out to lunch. 
Be aware that on festivals and weekends, there is only buffet which is really not elaborate and includes a set thalli starter which on the day we went included the simple khichuri...which was good for my parents as my dad loved it. But for me it wasn't what I would have expected. 
There were two different chops with it which was really good in taste. 
The buffet then included luchi with cholar dal and a polao with doi Mach and kosha mansho followed by a sweet dish. This was good in taste but very oily, specially the polao. 
The menu changes every buffet but the spread was not elaborate at all. While we were in the place, numerous customers came and went looking at the day's menu. 

The place is simple and tastefully decorated and almost gives a flavour of an old rajbari but the space is too small. Not much privacy while eating or talking in there. 
Go at your own risk.

Extremely disappointing experience. 
The first point of dissonance was the stench of raw fish as soon as one enters the restaurant. Why??? 
It started with the staff flatly stating that several items from the menu - especially prawns items were not available, reason being attributed was that they closed buffet service the day before and so were out of stock for most raw ingredients.
We then placed order for macher Paturi amongst other things and they forgot to serve the dish. But then they added the item to the bill. 
The daal (bhaja moog’er daal) was stale. One could get the smell of reheated food. And when reported the standard reply was “we do not serve stale food”. No offering to taste / check the dish - nothing. 
The mahanayak thali had maach’er muro diye daal which was fried too many times to the extent of making the muro dry and tasteless. 
The begun bhaja was not fried well and was uncooked inside. 
The allo’r jhuri bhaja was cold and soggy. 
We asked for two freshlime sodas and that took them 40 minutes to serve without either sweet or salt!!! Then they took it back and corrected it. 
The icing of this experience was with the Mishti which was part of the thali and they conveniently forgot to serve it. When asked the got a rosogolla - wherein during the ordering they had said the thali ends with a Sandesh. 
The service and staff are another story. They generally prefer to stick around the cash counter chatting away. We had to call out to them several times to get them to serve the table. This got to the point that when I called for the settlement, they simply gave the bill and disappeared again. I had to walk up to the cash desk to pay the bill. 
While it is easy to keep pointing fingers, they need to take a stock of the situation. There are people like us who come once in a while only for the experience. In this case my mother was the one most keen to visit the place. Sudipa’r rannaghor did not only do a bad job of the food and the service, they disappointed the sentiments of a hardened fan of theirs - my septegenarian mother. 
Get you act straight guys. Keep the shop closed if you can’t provide full service. And then reopen to ensure you meet with fulfilling the dreams and expectations of your fans.

Worst. I have visited with family and after a-la-carte, order 2 rosogolla for my kid, without checking the price. To my surprise, bill comes Rs 120 for 2 rosogolla + tax. It should not cost Rs. 10 or 15 each in some very good sweet shop also. Service is also worst. Food was testy, but not at all upto the standard, specially the price they ae taking for it. I want to give 0 rating for this restaurant :😠

Considering that Ms Sudipa is such a loved and respected name in Bengal, I expected high standards. Was thoroughly disappointed. My parents wanted to go there, specially my mom, so took them out to lunch. 
Be aware that on festivals and weekends, there is only buffet which is really not elaborate and includes a set thalli starter which on the day we went included the simple khichuri...which was good for my parents as my dad loved it. But for me it wasn't what I would have expected. 
There were two different chops with it which was really good in taste. 
The buffet then included luchi with cholar dal and a polao with doi Mach and kosha mansho followed by a sweet dish. This was good in taste but very oily, specially the polao. 
The menu changes every buffet but the spread was not elaborate at all. While we were in the place, numerous customers came and went looking at the day's menu. 

The place is simple and tastefully decorated and almost gives a flavour of an old rajbari but the space is too small. Not much privacy while eating or talking in there. 
Go at your own risk.

Extremely disappointing experience. 
The first point of dissonance was the stench of raw fish as soon as one enters the restaurant. Why??? 
It started with the staff flatly stating that several items from the menu - especially prawns items were not available, reason being attributed was that they closed buffet service the day before and so were out of stock for most raw ingredients.
We then placed order for macher Paturi amongst other things and they forgot to serve the dish. But then they added the item to the bill. 
The daal (bhaja moog’er daal) was stale. One could get the smell of reheated food. And when reported the standard reply was “we do not serve stale food”. No offering to taste / check the dish - nothing. 
The mahanayak thali had maach’er muro diye daal which was fried too many times to the extent of making the muro dry and tasteless.

But when I looked at the rate chart i realized that the food was overpriced. Even the quantity of some dishes was not sufficient for my family. The decor was quite good and the room was packed.For decor i will give 6/10. But for food i will give 1.5

- Food: Had lunch. Only buffet(Durga Puja special). Very expensive. Quality of Spread not worth the money spent. Food was very ordinary.
- Service: Staff had an air of authority esp. the managers. Found their behaviour rude for my taste.
- Ambience: Nice but the joint was pretty small. Had problems getting to the buffet.
- Expected a lot from the place due to the popularity of the owner and her cooking show. But it was a letdown. There is a lot of room for improvement. Very disappointed.

Honestly this city offers numerous eateries serving traditional bengali food which are pretty accomplished in their work. But then there is this joint! The quality or quantity, neither of them are up to the mark. The doi begun i had was bland and the gondhoraj bhetki tasted okayish.In spite of multiple warnings about how disappointing my experience would be here I went ahead for a personal experience, which turned out quite disastrous.

Taste: The menu is fair. However, I was a bit reserved in my approach to the lunch here. Moong Dal was wonderful with the Aloo Bhaja. Dhokar Dalna was fair. And I had Bhetki Paturi after more than a decade, so can't complaint. However, the Mutton Curry was not good.

Ambience: Good. Nice decor on the wall. However the effort to push the brand was very visible and why not, have heard it's quite popular.

Service: Good. The good part was the assurance that the dishes would be prepared according to specifications.

Value for money: 5/10

This place doesn't deserve to have such a low rating. Went there for Sunday lunch buffet with family. 850+ tax indeed a high price for the menu they offered. It could have been ay least 200 bucks less. But Bengali fine dining in kolkata is expensive for no reason. Oh Calcutta and 6 ballygaunge place have very similar in pricing.
Coming to food, decor and service, i am impressed by them. They may have small number ot item in the menu, but the quality was good. They had gondhoraj fish fry, veg chop, rice, ilish macher matha die chochhori, polao, pabda mach, desi murgir jhol, chatni l, doi l, misti. Kind of bie bari food :) Fish fry was made of basa and not bhetki, this is the only flaw i could find. I have never seen any bengali restaurant to serve such huge pabda.
Overall, except the price not a bad experience at all. 1.9 rating  for this is really a surprise to me!!!

Not too sure what is the hype about this restaurant. Been there yesterday and least to say it was an extremely disappointing experience. The spread was very ordinary, predictable and there wasn't any innovative idea. The taste of food was very average especially the non vegetarian dishes. Felt like fried fish was dipped in precooked gravy and served and not cooked together.  Above all the pricing at Rs 950 plus taxes was too exorbitant convenient the quality. Overall not lived up to the reputation and definitely not a second time.

I had gone to Sudips's Rannaghor twice. The last one was only a few days back. Let me put the facts straight.
Many of the items shown on the menu are not available. The stewards tend to steer you away but then such menus only show the pretensions of this restaurant.
A couple of examples would be Fishroll and Malpua.

Believe me the quality of the fish used both in the fish fry and the panda dish was of such standard that had I known earlier I would have stuck to being a vegetarian.
The Begun Bhaskar was underdone and raw inside. The posto bats was watery and served with mustard oil and sliced green chillies.Altogether insipid and tasteless.
Yet the restaurant had a reasonable crowd. Goes to show that Television is getting the better of our judgement.
I for one have given up the restaurant as a lost case after trying twice.

Had been there day before yesterday. My mom wanted to have lunch in this Restaurant so took her. 
The staffs behaved well with us. We liked the decor too. Nice old bengali songs added up to the charm. 
We ordered plain steamed rice. Bhaja moong daal and Jhurjhure Aloo Bhaja. Then ordered Doi Begun and finally Lebu Lonka Murgi. 
The bhaat-daal-bhaja was not special in taste. It was exactly how any Bengali mom makes it. Doi Begun was okay. Not very bad. But to my surprise it was yellowish in colour that marked the presence of turmeric in it (Doi Begun is usually white).
But I honestly loveeeed the Lebu Lonka Murgi. It was light and quite flavourful. 
This certainly ain't the best Bengali Restuarant in town. Moreover it is over-priced. Who would want to have normal bhaat daal bhaja for 290(+tax)? 
I hope it improves its quality as I am afraid, no person will return to the place again if they keep getting such food for such price. 
All the best. :)

Full marks to the ambience and presentation. Food are good specially veg items. They serve enough quantity share for two people .though I don't like the teast of "duck benglo" and the idea of slices thin boild egg serve with it. The smell of the egg doesn't go with the particular preparation.

Being a bong, i have tasted a lot many different types of bengali preparations of one dish but here it was not that satisfactory.
I found it over priced compared to the taste. 
I tried out, kesari polau, chingri polau, mutton duck banglow, paratha and nolen gur er ice cream. Kesari polau and Paratha were too sweet. Mutton duck banglow and chingri polau were okayish. Well the only thing i would appreciate is nolen gour er ice cream. Thats something tasted better than all others. 
If you are a non bong and planning to try out some bengali cuisine, it would its not a good place to do so.

As Sudipa is a big name in Bengali ranna ghor,
I expected it would be quite unique.
Ambience was too catchy.
But food was horrible
Worst restaurant in town.
Hilsha Biriyani was too bad. Most disappointing experience.

As every other said .... as the ratings said... WORST. Madam Sudipa has no idea about Bengali cooking. Or she just wants to fool everyone by her Tv appearances and brand name. Even worst then street food.

Yesterday I have visited the restaurant while they are serving bhuni khichuri platter.In the name of bhuni khichuri they simply served #JholaKhichuri.Not only that they were just mixing  the fried rohu fish with gravy on the buffet serving bowl as the fish pieces were finished. Ambience was good.But taste of the food was below average.Need for professional approach as other restaurants of this zenre doing extremely well.

Yesterday I ordered Ilish Biriyani relying on the name of Sudipa. But I have become disappointed while having my dinner. First of all the fish which was given was not actual Hilsha fish and secondly it was fried long ago. Really disappointing experience.. It was the 3rd time I have ordered food from this outlet, but this happens for the first time..Please improve ur quality or else don't provide food ..

After a long time today 10/06/17 we went to dine in for authentic Bengali Food.My daughter who has come to Kolkata from USA after 4 Years wishes to have Lunch only at Sudipar Rannaghor.But we are so disappointed after having the buffet Lunch, my daughter hardly took any thing. None of the Non Veg as well Basanti Pulao( only two i.e Chicken bharta and Doi Katla) preparation is not good as such it is very bad.. Unable to take the chicken dish as well quality of Fish is not good it was tasteless.We are surprised to see the deterioration of this Restaurant. 
In future I will not refer this to be the authentic Bengali Restaurant. Much better options are available at less budget.

Well... I haven't been to the restaurant so I won't comment on the food... Please please don't put absurd headings in your menu... Entreé means main course... Not starters... Since entreé is a French term.. let me inform you the French word for starters is "Hors d' Oeuvres"... And the basic rule of menu making is maintain one language.. so abide to it... 
If in any case you wanna know the different course names in French.. u can reply to the comment....

“Quality and Hospitality is at challenge here” 

While our popular TV anchor, Sudipa appears very warm and hospitable on the contrary her staff at restaurant is a misnomer to fabled bengali hospitality. When we landed at the restaurant, the start of cold attitude of staff, reeling under the impact of fame of Sudipa forgets what it takes to welcome guests. Followed by no attention for 45 mins despite repeated requests for water. Welcome drink follows mid-meal and that too don't worry, we will give it as it is listed in menu. No cutlery offered, no curry bowls, etc. Not sure if Sudipa understands that it takes more than TV shows to welcome guests and provide them that hospitality which will be an experience to narrate. My regrets but not worth the money and your time due to unprofessional behavior and attitude of staff, quality of food, and presentation.

The place has good decor with Sudipa's sketch on the main course plates. However we were provided with normal white plates. We tried the Rashmoni Malaicurry, which is a unique dish prepared with Rosogolla. Aam Katuli is also a very well prepared dish with subtle taste of raw mango. However, they served Rohu fish instead of Katla, as specified in the menu. We ordered Coconut ice cream as dessert. But the ice cream which they served was horrible to taste as the stock was very old. No flavour. So we cancelled it. Overall quality of food is not up to the mark.

People come to this restaurant only after seeing Sudipa in Zee Bangla. But her restaurant is very poorly managed. It has got very callous staff. Food stocks are not fresh. Hygiene is also not properly maintained. People sitting beside us in another table even saw bed bugs in their food which left all of us horrified. It is evident that the footfall in this restsurant is very poor. Won't advice anybody to visit this restaurant.

We have been visiting sudipar Rannaghar ocassionaly and found food quality by and large so.so. But on last sunday  ( on 26th.March'17 ), we are surprised to observe the Food Quality has detoriated to a great extent. It was sunday and actually we were fully dissatisfied with Bengali preparation and service. We occupied table no. 25 ( 2 Sr. Citizen) ,memo no.17/4856 dt.26Mar'17. We ordered for 7 items. About quality  Fish fry some how ok. but Fish kalia - Neither the fish nor the Kalia has been prepaired properperly,we could not eat actually ,as such no taste at all. We asked them to pack . Dal served cold and no taste. Papad ordered has been delivered  after bill payment. Actually server forgotton to serve and when we pointed out that item has already billed,then they served.  Our expression as above is out of our best wishes to sudipta so that our Bengali preparations quality should not  be allowed to go down this way along with passage of time. Sudipar's preparation once we used to talk about.But we find it is detoriating. Please take care of quality and taste for all Bengali food lovers. Thanks.

If it is about bengali food or bengali cuisine then we have so many option in Kolkata. But I would  really suggest you all to visit this restaurant. Situated in triangular park. Decor and environment was really nice. The most important part is food and service, and they are maintaining the quality as I believe. It was a awesome experience all together. I have ordered Prawn Cake, Begun Bhaja, Steam Rice, Macher Matha diye Moong dal, Chital Macher Muithya, Palang Cofi, and obviously no bengali food is complete without Kacha Amer chutney and Nolengur Ice cream. All I want to say, food was upto the mark. And I enjoyed a lot. Menu pricing is also affortable. Want to visit again.

I went yesterday with my wife at restaurant  Sudipar rannaghar  at Gariahat for lunch. There was bitter experience while we were  forced to take buffet by the restaurant  boys. We found sukto carry was very bad condition. Staff checked it and told us due to bori, the curry had been deteriorated. They cooked new sukto immediately but we stared for others. However they packed it. We had paid Rs.1808/- for two persons which seem to be exorbitant high where the food was not up to the mark.

Probably the place runs on its Brand Name... But not on goodwill I hope. 
This is definitely not the best place to dine in for Bengali food... Much better options are there like Bhojohori Manna and Kasturi. The prices for the menu are quite high above average compared to the food served... 
**Special Mention - the Chingri Maacher Malaikaari should be a little more thick in consistency and a bit for smooth. The dish a bit too loud and strong in aroma... The fish should be litlle more soft. 
I wouldn't refer this to be the best Bengali restaurant... When you have much better options at the same budget.

If you are keen on trying something horrible...and give your tongue a traumatic experience this place is perfect. We went for lunch today and ordered Ilish bhapa... there was no salt. When I complained they pretended as if it was sin to ask for salt ...why not Gandhi walked miles to break the salt law. To add cherry on the cream I became more adventurous and ordered bhetki paturi for home. The fish were not fresh had a bland taste and once again no salt.

Total YUCK

This is certainly not the best place to have authentic Bengali cuisine. I found the buffet menu over-priced and below par. 

Very limited spread and ambience lacks the bong appeal. 

However the fish fry is a must try in the ala carte menu, too tempting to resist.

All in all its worth an one-time visit if you have tried most of the other bong-food heavens! 😊

The ambience, though not very authentic for a Bengali meal, is quite nice. Price is a notch above average for restaurants of the same standard. The food is naturally what we have at home usually, but, for non-Bengalis, or even Bengalis who do not get to have the Bengali delicacies at home, I recommend 
#Chingri Macher Malaikari (They use the Golda variety of shrimp, and the coconut milk based curry is delicious)

Bangali bhuribhoj @ Sudipar Rannaghor

As people around the world celebrate food, there is a clan called amongst them called “Bangali” who live for food. When the world is concerned about staying fit and healthy , what bangalis need is chingri machher malaikari and kochi pathar jhol. Bangalis may have become Bongs but their foodie nature cannot be marred. So living food is living the life of Bangali.
            

To celebrate the spirit of Bangaliana, Sudipar Rannaghor brings to you a diverse spread of Bengali cuisines from the culinary diaries of mothers and grandmothers, who have surpassed the rich heritage called FOOD to their successors. From the kitchens of both East and West Bengal, Sudipar Rannaghor presents to you a plethora of fine Bengali food.

Location : The address reads 37/1, Purna Das Road, Hindustan Park. This joint is easy to locate. Just take the lane adjacent to Triangular Park and walk towards Southern Avenue. From the first crossing, take left and there you find it on the left footpath.

Decor and Ambience :Sudipar Rannaghor celebrates Babuana from where the food culture of Bengalis have evolved. Wall has paintings of scenes from the king’s courts. The wooden furniture quote elegance and the beautiful chandeliers of belgium glass are a proof to the rich heritage Bengal. The restaurant does not have a spread floor area and and has limited seating capacity. The pleasant music enhances the pleasure of eating.

Food :  The design of menu is attractive. It has a diverse spread of delicacies from East Bengal and West Bengal.

This is what we were served.

Beverages :

1. Spotik jol – This is a reincarnated form of an age-old digestive tonic given to people during summers. This is made of burnt unripe mangoes (aam pora) with salt, oil and sugar perfectly blended together to give a refreshing bliss after a hard day.

With the rise in number of restaurants serving Bengali cuisine, the varieties of food on offer have increased too. With rising competition, every place is trying to offer something unique to get the attention of the foodies. So, when I got an invitation for dinner at Sudipar Rannaghor, the first thing that came to my mind was what specialty would be on offer for us. And though, unfortunately, I have not been able to catch even a single episode of Sudipar Rannaghor, a Bengali TV cooking show, there were expectations, as it is, I heard, a very popular one.
                                                                ...

Sudipar Rannaghor offers a journey into Kolkata cuisine, a range of food influenced by the different rulers who have come and gone. The interiors are classy, yet welcoming. The help you look forward to a good meal ahead. 
Of all the dishes we were served, our favourites were the Royal Bengal Fish Fry and the Chingri Cake among the appetizers. The bits of prawn on the cake were delicious and the whole dish was fun to eat. For mains, we suggest the Lebu Lonka Murgi and the Jumbo Chingri Malaikari (which you'll get in both East & West Bengal style).
For dessert, we sampled the different variants of icecream. We always love Nolen Gurer Icecream which was a delight. We also enjoyed the Bubblegum and Tender Coconut flavours. 
Lastly, although the food was really good, the service needs to improve. They're always courteous but a little disorganized.
                                                                ...

The Purna Das road corridor is becoming quite a destination for Bengali food. A house has been converted into a restaurant. Good ambience and intimate feel. It makes for somewhat cramped interiors especially when they lay out the buffet. Have tried their lunch buffet. The food is quite decent but nothing extraordinary. It's owned by a popular TV cooking show host. It's tremendously overpriced though for what it offers compared to other Bengali buffets in town like 6 Ballygunge Place which also has much more elegant decor. This buffet came with very standard items - one dal, one veg, one mutton, one fish, a couple of fried things, one kind of sweet and was Rs 950 which was quite exorbitant. Most other buffets in town will have multiple kinds of vegetables, non-veg dishes and desserts. Service here is friendly and polite but other places (even the slightly more upscale ones) are more value for your money.

The food was just about average and the taste too. The staff was ok and tried to keep up with that rush. An overhyped place in literal sense. It was so overcrowded that it seemed like sitting in a fish market.

Went for a weekend lunch buffet with too much of expectations of tasting bengali food. Absolutely disappointed with the starters and the non veg food. First of all there was not much starters out which fish finger was fine  and postor bora horrible

In the main course rui fish was not upto the mark, prawns were fine, kancha lonka chicken not good,mutton too smelly. I would say the veg main course were better. What I liked was luchi, Alu posto, chochori and payesh. 

Expensive. Quantity not enough. The sides are not fresh. The dude taking orders is pushing to get stuff like luchi and postor bora and diamond fish fry when you clearly don't think you can eat a lot.

I felt the money they charged for buffet is not at all worth it, could have better food somewhere
else. I hope ala carte is better which I didn't try but both are too costly . But I would never go for a
buffet at this place. A place not worth going!

I REALLY WONDER HOW THEY WOULD JUSTIFY THE MONEY TO THE PERSONS HAVING VEG WITH ONLY TWO VEG ITEMS..THEY DIDNOT EVEN KNOW HOW TO BOIL BENGAN,CHICKEN ,MUTTON AND FISH.. BENGALI FOOD ALWAYS TASTES AWESOME..BUT THEY ARE LIKE DEGRADING IT.. THEY SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR THIS KIND OF FRAUD.. I THINK WE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE MONEY TO THEM SO THAT THEY CAN GO AND HAVE FOOD AT THE SPECIALITY CHAIN RESTAURANTS TO REALISE HOW TO SATISFY CUSTOMERS WITH GOOD FOOD  WHEN THEY ARE PAYING SO MUCH..

Food was okay...Not at all worth 1400 per person for non veg buffet though.The only praiseworthy dish that i found was the fish fry.Rest was all below par.There was complete mismanagement throughout the restaurant as the staff was finding it v difficult to put up with the huge count of customers.We got a seat at the back.Which was v close to the kitchen and  we could see the filth inside.It was v dirty.A simple process of providing a finger bowl could ease up this issue,as people dont hav to stand for hours in a queue to wash their hands and thereby causing incovenience to other customers,since the space is v less.

I was surprised when we complete buffet lunch at this location on yesterday (9th Oct) during Astomi of Durga Puja... One words it was just horrible. . Buffet luch for bengali cusine was cost around 1400 per head including tax which too much expensive. Still we can consider that price part if atleast food was good but unfortunately that part also disappointed us. All foods without salt and without mirchi.
I think food quality is better than road side dhaba. No means to spend lots of money only AC and decorated atmosphere.

After visiting Durgas in and around Gariahat, Jodhpur, Chetla; we stepped into Sudipar Rannaghor.... Buffet was served during Pujas.... But what type of Buffet is this??? Shukto, Beguni, Potoler Dom all served on the Bone-China plate with rice.... And we have to wait till a person comes and refill it... It reminded me of ‘Olden Days of Bengali Biye Baari’.... I asked what is the Buffet table for??? They replied only for Desserts... Pineapple chutney, Rasogolla, Ice-Cream Sondesh and Payesh....

Luchi was crispy and seems a cold-one was refried...  The main course arrived before the starters and the service was atrocious... Such that you eat Starters less.... Funny isn’t it!!!! They don’t want customer to waste a single food.... They will check only if you finished eating, then only they will serve you anything... No extra bowl... The Daal, Jhol and fries all mixed
up... Seems like you are eating meal in a cheap eatery....

Ordered lanka lebu murgi, kesari pulao, and katla kalia. Food was nice and the containers were labelled which was very helpful. The chicken pieces were a little bony, but otherwise the quality of food was good.

Food was okay...Not at all worth 1400 per person for non veg buffet though.The only praiseworthy dish that i found was the fish fry.Rest was all below par.There was complete mismanagement throughout the restaurant as the staff was finding it v difficult to put up with the huge count of customers.We got a seat at the back.Which was v close to the kitchen and  we could see the filth inside.It was v dirty.A simple process of providing a finger bowl could ease up this issue,as people dont hav to stand for hours in a queue to wash their hands and thereby causing incovenience to other customers,since the space is v less.

I was surprised when we complete buffet lunch at this location on yesterday (9th Oct) during Astomi of Durga Puja... One words it was just horrible. . Buffet luch for bengali cusine was cost around 1400 per head including tax which too much expensive. Still we can consider that price part if atleast food was good but unfortunately that part also disappointed us. All foods without salt and without mirchi.
I think food quality is better than road side dhaba. No means to spend lots of money only AC and decorated atmosphere. 
I will suggest never go that place, if you are planning to waste your money then give it to any person who is begging atleast you will get bless from him.

The food was horribe as luchi had raw maida in it and the kosha chicken had more of bones than chicken. Fish chop had a spoonful of Fish hidden in loads of potatoes. And to the top of it had the sour taste of vinegar and the smell of pangus fish (they claimed it to be vetki, which it was definitely not). The coating for the stuff was too thick and Smaller sizes, lesser vinegar and better quality / variety of fish will work. I was wondering if it was a bread roll or something like fish is also there. Food was too spicy and damn expensive.

I had such a horrible
experience at this place. Extremely disappointing and frustrating! It was a pathetic
service, portion size and quality of food. 

We had ordered prawn
cutlet, luchi, kasha mangsho, basanti pulao and chingri bhapa. The prawn
cutlets had more onions than prawns in them. Infact if we did find a piece of
prawn we considered ourselves to be very lucky! The fish was seasoned too
heavily and smelt off(i think there was a pong to it). The prawn cutlet had
less prawns and more mirchi. Kasha mangsho had nothing but gravy and
when we checked we were informed that they didn't have enough of the dish but
since they didn't want to refuse us they didn't inform that the dish was over. 

For desserts we
decided to call for Nolen gurer ice-cream. They didn't have that, so they offered
Butter-Scotch ice-cream. The other stuff was not that great also. The chingri
bhapa lacked taste and had too much of mustard in it. 

Except for the fish
fry everything else on the menu makes no sense at all. To top this, was their food is
strictly average and definitely burn pockets. Overall the experience was
really bad. I would not recommend it to anyone for sure. I am not going to return back
to this place again for the second time. For others, please don't step into
this place on days, you feel it can be crowded, because they can't handle
'rush'. However, I will give them full points for screwing our mood on the day
of a festival.

Just now had pujo buffet in this eatery. Not at all value for money. Katla kalia was full of boroken and small pieces of fish which is not at all expected in a buffet of 950/-. Bhetki kata chachchari ideally should be made with tail part, fin part head of kolkata bhetki witj some vegetables may be but here the restaurant unethically utilised scraped out bones (not "kata") of bombay vetki which perhaps they have used for making their royall fish fry and other boneless fish preparations. So it is very evident that this restaurant never uses kolkata vetki for any if its dish. Even a child will not believe that they have purchased smelly bombat vetki bones only to make this chachchari. Machher chop was dry, luchi was greasy. Mutton curry had no problem but it was not very different from the mutton curry that usually we have in wedding made by any local caterer. Palak chingri thakurbari was good chingri was used like garnishing, we expected a bit more elegance in this dish as the restaurant was very hyped amd buffet was costly.

The best part of the buffet wad butterscotch sandesh on dessert counter ( on that counter the other sweet dish was chutney only!!!) Which i believe they have not made in house.

Welcome drinks were served to us after 20mins when we have already started with the main course.

In nutshell that rs.950 buffet is not at all good and doesn't give value for money. Service is lousy and it was bitter experience for me and my family.

For an eating place to
serve stale food is just unpardonable, that means they are out to dupe the
customers, and absorb their money.

Chingrir Malaikari was
tasteless, adding extra oil and spices won't make the stale curry taste better.  The oil was oozing out
like molten lava from each dish. On top of that they didn't give chili and salt
and it tasted too sweet.

The mutton korma was
so hard that you would need to chew really hard before you can swallow it.

Kosha murgi'r mangsho was
also disappointing it was over-cooked meat and the curry tasted more akin to
macher kalia's.


The only savior was Doi potol but again it was too
spicy.

The buffet served was vast and most of the dishes were authentic and one could make out the bengali flavors easily. Borishal Murgi Bhaja- A wonderful bengali style chicken fry which tastes awesome with all the necessary flavors and spices added in proportionate amount. Fish Salad- Bengalis are known for their special affection towards sea food especially fish. This fish salad was rightly spiced and tasted very good as a starter. 

The most popular dish here is Kosha Mangsho, but my favourite is the delectable combination of soft Luchis with Cholar dal. 

Aam diye phool kopi and Chicken rezala are tempting. Food was good specially the Lonka bhapa murgi and fish chop and Potoler paturi.

I won't be able to comment about the malpua and the rosogulla being too full. We also had bhapa sandesh (steamed sandesh) and  Payesh which is recommended for all who want to have dessert. 

The floor managers are ever-so courteous, the waiters are so gentle, polite, humble, contrite and ever smiling really lifted my mood for the day.

Today was the first visit to this place , though have been planning since it's opening . The expectation was quite high considering the owner's taste and reputation. The disappointment is Everest High. 
 
To start with - 
Staff : attitude and management problem . They serve only buffet on weekends , as this wasn't a common knowledge we wanted to order according to our choice but the refusal was so sharp and arrogant that you would like to leave the place at that instant.

Food : a so called traditional bengali restaurant serving " shukto " for dinner that to in buffet which kind of makes it compulsory to have ( as the choices were just a few ) 

Cost : a moderate bengali meal cost u around  500-700 in these 'B class ' restaurants , even if u go to luxury group of restaurants they charge u as high as 1.5k ( approx ) . Here a meal consists of Fish fry , plain rice, shukto , mangsher dal , begun bhaja , pulao , pabdar jhal , mutton , chatni , rasogolla costs u 1.3k ( approx with tax ) 

Ambiance : a well decorated walls with a chandelier ceiling catches the eye , but all the impression goes out of window the moment you come to know the restaurant  doesn't have a toilet .

Total waste of money and time!

I went with my husband to have lunch for the first time, we were very pleased with the decor and the waiters attended us nicely, Sudipa herself came to us and talked twice which we felt was very thoughtful of her. Now the downside, we ordered 1)Mochar Chop 2)Nayok Thali 3)Luchi 4)Chhanar Kalia...these four items cost us lil above 1500 bucks. Now if you go to place like 6BP or The Wall or Mainland China, you will get much tastier and more food for the same amount. This restaurant being new, I felt first they should take care of the cooking, win ppls hearts and gradually can increase their price demand-wise. Mochar Chop was fantastic! But just two of it cost 150 ! Thats too much. The Nayok Thali that was served to me was not enough in quantity for an adult person, the mutton/fish/dal were served in very small quantity, not sure if they could provide a second helping. I did not ask for it. The item that was supposed to be fish was anything but fish, not sure which part of the fish it was, I guess the head(muro), so all that was in my thali was a huge bone dipped in curry, not a single bit of flesh whatsoever. So my thali went basically fishless. Also to mention I wanted the khichudi thali first which I was denied, later being confronted by Sudipa to the waiter, he flipped 180 Deg and said"No its available".Then I had to say that I was denied initially, after which the waiter said "well it will take lot of time". Luchi and Chhanar Kalia was good.But my husband had to wait a long time for just Luchi and Chhanar Kalia to arrive, I insisted to wait for him, so by the time his dish came, my thali went cold too. One thing to appreciate, they did not add service charge which I believe should be left to the customer's will ofcourse. I think this restaurant can win more stars if they try to improve on cooking because the taste being not so out of the ordinary, just what I could make at home. Secondly, the prices are way too steep, I dont mind paying, but I should get quality food as well, not bones of a fish.

Its not very good, but not the worst also....

Ambience: Good; decor is suitable for bengali cuisine restaurant.

Service: Not very good. staffs are not so attentive & not courteous, & they are bit slow also.

Food: I have ordered Royal Bengal Fish Fry, Kosha Mangsho & Paratha
*Royal Bengal Fish Fry- It was described as one of their best items by their staff. But if this is the best,then god knows how much horrible the taste of the worst items are. It has a big size, but taste is not up to the mark.
*Kosha Mangsho- Again this was also described as one of their best items, but sadly this is also not that much good.
*Paratha- Worst Paratha I've ever seen. Extremely over fried & hard.
Overall quantity is good enough, quality of food is good as it had not caused any health hazard, But taste is not at all good.

Price: Bit overpriced.

After spending 31 Durga pujo in various cities around USA, I am looking forward to spending this 2016 pujo in Kolkata. While trying to line up some authentic Bong restaurants my trusted friend Mr. Google referred me to Zomato. I was expecting it to be like Yelp, where we read some constructive criticism the purpose of which is to improve the outcome. You review a restaurant and let everyone know of your experience and leave it to the business owner and the potential customer on how they want to benefit from your review. However, most of the posts here seem like coming from a couple of scorned lovers. It's a shame that Zomato doesn't monitor the site like yelp does. They let a review site turn into a full fledged battle ground. 

 

A friendly suggestion to the owner of the restaurant, running a business is tough and running a restaurant is even tougher.  In order to be a good businesswoman and run a successful business you have to first be a good listener, your patrons are your secret to success.  If you are in hospitality business your Mantra should be a customer is always right( I don't mean the ones who sound like scorned lovers, they are just that). You don't have to reply to all the reviews.  The consumers in this day and age are well traveled and well informed, I am sure they are sensible enough to know which reviews to ignore.

I don't doubt for a moment that you have some wonderful food at your restaurant, however the consensus is you are a bit pricey for the general consumer.  It seems like people like you as a TV personality and are willing to try out your restaurant. As a seasoned businesswoman with over 2 decade of experience in the hospitality business if I was in your predicament I would have one upscale restaurant and one no frill casual dining with competitive pricing.  Wish you all the best !!!

Just had lunch here.Wanted to give 0 rating but app wont allow it.Apart from the average quality and steep price of the food what is most disgusting is the attitude of the waiters.
1.While placing orders  Mr.Dilip Yadav misguided us about the quantity (without being asked for) and forced us (me and wife) to take 2 plates of rice.Later when told, he retorted"how will I know,how much you eat".
2.On arrival, nobody bothered to ask even, whether to serve the food ( although only 3 out of 10-12 tables were occupied at that time) as 2-3 waiters were  around another empty table busy sorting out their personal problems.
3.Nobody asked about food taste or our experience during the meals, which,even a local restaurant also does now.
4.We had to ask for the paan which they were supposed to serve free and again on asking about the slip one Mr. Mukesh Swain plainly told "we have forgotten."
All these could have been proved more clearly had there been CCTV, but unfortunately there isn't any.
Price, quality etc. does matter but hospitality matters most.If Mrs. Sudipa can please look into these matters with concern, otherwise I would take this venture as yet another pastime of a celebrity..

With folded hands I request you not to go this place if you really like bengali cuisine. Today I visited this place with my wife and parents around 145 pm due to some occasion and I was totally upset. We ordered for so many foods including Sorse Bhetki. The quality and quantity was very poor for all the foods but the worst part was that the sarse Bhetki was totally rotten and such a bad smell that you just can not put it in your mouth. I called the staffs and they said fish was bought on that day. I am a central govt. class 1 officer and very much fond of authentic bengali food. In Kolkata I have tried so many bengali cuisine but this place is the worst. After watching Tv we planned to visit this place with lot of hope but I am really upset.The staffs are very ill mannered. The food bill and payment is attached with photograph. I also know that Sudipa is not aware of all these otherwise this resturant can not be the worst.

My request to all Bengali Food Lovers please do not visit this overhyped restaurant. I have visited this restaurant on 14.08.16 in South Kolkata with family members of 7nos.Total Billing is above 12000/- in buffet. Food quality is worthless in terms of price. They provide us 6nos chairs and one of our family member take his lunch throughout the session by standing. Even they don't bother to provide us drinking water, we serve it own. Plates are inadequate, we take desert in main course dish, also they don't have adequate finger bowl, they request us to wash our hands in washroom, it was flooded, after several request they provide us the same. Last but not the least the owner is not ready to take any complain, she is little pampered and ready to engage in photo session. My rating is 1

We went there for a Sunday buffet. This place didnot live upto our expectations at all. Very few menu on the buffet. Taste of the food was bad. Prawn Paturi didnot have proper masala, mutton was not at all cooked. Desserts were disappointing as well as they served only Rasgullas and Chutneys which was not expected from a place which they advertise so much for, on the bengali television.

Had to wait for more than 39 mins to get a space...when entering found that there were empty tables inside....requested for ala carte...the waiter replied rudely that ala carte will take more than 45 mins..we were forced to order buffet.The buffet was having missing dishes(pakoda)..we were informed that this would arrive soon..we started with main course and the pakoda arrived after the main course was finished.Now comes the most horrific part--the mutton contained hairs and the chutney contained flies...when these were pointed to the the staff they were oblivious to the situation...to our utter dismay the chutney was still being served as a part of the buffet😟 overall a very horrific experience after coming to this place with lots of expectations....

I went there and I had fallen sick. Can you guys be little hygienic.  Leaving hair open while cooking. Not wearing gloves,  having long nails with nail paint on and then cooking with bare hands is such a no no. Please avoid eating in this restaurant.... I felt terrible having meal here.

Was a high disappointment there was empty dishes, which was taking a long time to get refilled. I don't know whether it was the weekend which effected the quality of the food. 

 In the main course Rui fish was not upto the mark, prawns were fine, Kancha Lonka chicken not good, mutton too bland. The meat was cooked to perfection, but was devoid of flavor. Loochi was bit sobby.

Gondhoraj Bhetki was very Tasty but  without a single lemon leaf or lemon wedges .Little bit disappointed for Lau chingri though it was Quite tasty but too oily. Alu Bhaja was very crispy and had peanuts garnish the plate. 

Not great taste, Disappointing service, Average ambiance, Rates are very high, Wastage of money and time.

Went there today in the middle of a hectic shopping only to find the worst resturant ever. Food was below quailty would be an understand. They don't have even 1% of humaniy. Charging a dish of ilish paturi @450 and its equal to what we get in any vat er hotel @80 or @90. How can the foods be so bad! I mean seriously this requires a while new level of negligence and a rare talent. People who are going in there without even not knowing whats waiting for you there,you have my deepest symapthies.

I loved each of the preparation and the perfection it bestowed on coming out with the peculiar taste, aroma and texture of authentic Bengali food! 

The prawn was tender and full of flavors, and the fish fry was equally awesome. In Buffet we were served Rice,.Aloo bhaja, Golda chingri, Chicken Kosha, Luchi, Mochar Ghonto, Potoler Dolma, Bhektir Paturi, Rui Sorse, Tetuler Chatni, Ice Cream Sondesh, Baked Rosogolla.  

Their presentation, staff behavior, ambiance was very nice. A bit overpriced but this is a lovely place to have a dine in with your family. Looking forward for a visit again.

Madam as a well-wisher and a great fan of your TV Show, I review that I am utterly disappointed.  

Cold Fish fry and Half-Cooked Mutton Kosha. Aloo-Bhaja was not crispy. We ordered Maan-Bata but Staff said, it was not available. The Phoolkopir Danta bata was very bitter. Only thing I liked was Ilisher Tel-Jhol.

Last night was my second visit to this eatery. I liked the Royal Bengal Fish Fry the last time I visited, so made my friends try that n I tried the Fish Roll. Was awesome. Am not a big " Fish Fan " as most Bongs are. So, tried the gravy of Borishailla Ilish with Mochar Pulao n of course the Golda Chingdi Malai Curry. Loved them all. Proper balance of mustard n coconut in the Ilish preparation. The Mochar Pulao was flavourful. The Chingdi curry could have been thicker n rich in its consistency. The Morich Mangsho was also good. Got some food packed as well for home. Mutton Duck Bungalow n Bhetki Maacher Paturi to name a few n as always, the taste was fab. Ended with Nolen Gurer Ice cream which they didn't hv last time. Overall, very satisfied.

I and my girl-friend went to this joint but feels ourselves cheated. ….

We ordered 2 plates of Basanti Pulao & Bhetkir-Paturi…. And 1 plate each of Chingrir-Malaikari, Chanar-Dalna….. 

We decided to try Veg for change in taste, and ordered Kumro-Chingri…. That tasted like Prawn-Halwa…..

Every dish was so sweet, that we felt like eating spicy dessert…..

We were disappointed when none questioned why we wasted so much food…. The Bill turned about Rs. 2300/…. 

Didn’t like anything here except the location even the staffs were cold and arrogantly behaved….

So called bengali cuisine which is maintained by a well known tv personality but is very average as per food quality. Moreover the service is the worst part of this restaurant. Apart from fish fry none of the food is good. Where on earth do you eat sweet Kosha Mangsho. Overpriced because of the location. The menu card is not detailed, we ordered paratha and got thick lachha paratha which too was over sweetened. There are many bengali cuisine themed restaurant but this one is worst I ever had.

Love Bengali Food.........I would suggest donot be here👎.......... You will surely get a shock after getting the menu card in your hand.... 1stly the Price is tooo much high.... 2ndly the food they cooked are just wak... Once after the opening four of my friends visited the joint........Trust me : Ordered Mutton Kassa.............Firstly the served us lately, then when started having the food.....we found the Mutton Kassa they served having a bitter taste due to over cooking.... We asked them, they told  "AMADER EKHANKAR TASTE AMON E, KAU TO KONO DIN COMPLAIN KORAYNI"

Here is the shocking price for u :
Mochar Chop : Rs 150......Dohi Begun : Rs 250........Rice : Rs 150.....just the example of the price

Visit at your own risk.....friends

So a big thank you to all including chef and staffs of this restaurant for making my son's birthday an awesome one.. My son is a 6yr old Labrador n on this 13th I decided to get a doggy meal for him from this new restaurant. This is the first n only restaurant in Kolkata which helps you to get something for your furry baby too. I ordered for chicken meal and the best part was when they asked what are my specifications for salt n turmeric etc.. The staffs and there behavior was really good. The ambiance was very Royal. 
Coming to the food, so the meal contains chicken stew and rice and they served it hot and my baby loved it so it's understood that the taste was yumm as well.
Keep up the good work.. Hoping to visit soon :)

This is a restaurant of famous Bengali cooking Television show's host Sudiipa Chatterjee. My experiences of the first visit to this restaurant was average. I had visited for lunch and I ordered Fish Roll as starter and Desi Murgir Dom with Bhaja Mung Dal & Steamed Rice, prices are not so lower side but portion are good.

TASTE :
On the scale of taste it's only chicken preparation (Gravy) was delicious but chicken was not so tender and it's requires some more cooking and Mung Dal was average and I have not expected such a Dal preparation from Sudiipa's restaurant. Fish Roll was also average and served without any salads with just plain regular tomato sauce and why there is no Bengal's famous mustered chutney (Kashundi) if it's a Bengali cuisine speciality restaurant. This restaurant not serves any kind of Rotis.

AMBIANCE :This restaurant has not big floor area and it has small seating capacity, some of the seating arrangements are tight and table for two is extremely short to accommodate few plates, Interiors is simple with Bengali style hand printing walls. Air conditioning is good and pleasant music enhance the pleasure of eating and the design of Menu is attractive.

SERVICE :
I find that staff are not so attentive & not courteous, non of the staffs are wear smile during my presence, they just doing their duties without smile and they don't ask you to have anything more or offer any desert after the lunch even they do not offer to serve the food or refill your glasses of water.

PRESENTATION:
All foods are being served here without any decor and plating, food presentation doesn't starts sparks within you to enjoy the food immediately. My bowl of served chicken preparation was not cleaned from outside and looking dirty , you can see it in image and service bowl are not selected tastefully; are basic bowls.

This restaurant carry Sudiipa's name and foodies like me visit here in search of great Bengali cuisine with great care and service.

Overpriced bullshit. The mutton wasn't cooked properly. There was a nasty smell coming from the mutton. The dal was mostly water. The mochar ghonto was extremely sweet.
On top of that, the staffs are extremely ill mannered. They don't know how to serve their customers. They are extremely rude and after calling them for 4-5 times they'll come with a disgusted face.
Utterly disappointed and an absolute waste of money.
And obviously, the food was so bad I didn't have the interest to take any picture.

Compared to other buffet options around the city this place does not even stand in comparison...its way too poor in terms of buffet services/options....

Despite its rating, had to visit bcz it was on my mum's bucket list. She loves rannaghor on TV. Well she was heavily disappointed😖 with the food(being a bangal) and the staff got my dad 😠 angry. There was no one to refill our glasses of water or to even ask if we needed something more. On the other hand we could see the staff laughing and talking on the other side of the glass paying no attention to us. I had to literally leave my food in the middle to ask them for refilling our glasses and order more rice. Dad was furious😫 and over that the pricing!😕 it was a disaster. Coming to the food, we ordered everything in bangal style. However, everything came sweet😑(ghoti style). Mum got so frustrated, she didn't want to eat anything and made both me and dad eat everything. I am no expert in bengali cuisine so whatever mum says. Acc. to her, the "bhapa elish" had no 'jhaal' in it🙅 the "mochar ghonto" was grounded in the mixer and lost its taste😔It was tasty for me bcz I have a ghoti taste. But it felt like eating a dry sweet paste with the Maharashtrian peanut chutney at the sides. Sorry to say but mum makes much better. We also ordered "chingrhi macher malai curry" but dad said the prawns weren't cleaned properly😥 however, it's supposed to be sweet so it tasted good. The prawns had butter infused in them. So my rating is mainly because of this dish, the décor+presentation of food. Otherwise, it would have been in minus. It wasn't a good experience, sadly. Hope it gets better for their own sake.

Hi .. I had the misfortune to visit this place as it was the nearest one to where I stay.  One word to describe the total experience is disgusting - food (buffet for today) was a disaster - none of the food items had any semblance of taste, the waiter waiting at our table was extremely rude and we were served drinking water only after repeatedly asking for the same and the price is something better not talked about ( Paid Rs.6015- for 4 people... totally ridiculous when compared to the food and services )

It can simply be rated as the worst place that  I have been to in a long long time. Even the road side stalls serves better tasting food than this place.

I was two times at the restaurant last December. The interior is nicely designed, depicts some of the lost culture of old Kolkata. The first time we ordered individual dishes, which were strongly advertised in her Z-Bangla show. Apart from the use of too much sweet in most of the recipes, we found the food quite appreciable. I would in particular recommend "chhana-r kaliya". The second time, we were left only with the option of the lunch buffet on a Saturday afternoon and we were disappointed to see blood marks on the chicken pieces in biriyani. Overall, a good attempt to bring forth the traditional Bengali food with a nice ambience and I think that some small flaws can be overlooked. We hope to see improvements in the future and wish a long life for the efforts.    

Greetings from Germany

Terribly over priced with substandard food and staff. 
The decor is nice and refreshing but the food is awful. We ordered Paturi which was stinking and dry, it was surely kept in the fridge for 2 days and just warmed in the micowave for us. The replaced it promptly only to serve the same stale fish again ! We felt sick that evening ! The Basanti Pulao and Chicken was not bad...The menu card was just a few xeroxed pieces of paper! There is no finesse at all...!

Sudipa is a regular name in Bengali house holds...its a shame that her restaurant is such a sham and shame on Zee network for promoting such a terrible place. 
Clearly they just want to use the TV show to fleece people here...its sad that they cant even live up to their reputation.

We will discourage people from going there. I went there as my Mom was a fan of hers....There are small shacks on the roadside that cant make such excellent home food ! We don,t need a self proclaimed celebrity and a media house promoting such pathetic food.

Hi .. I had the misfortune to visit this place as it was the nearest one to where I stay.  One word to describe the total experience is disgusting - food (buffet for today) was a disaster - none of the food items had any semblance of taste, the waiter waiting at our table was extremely rude and we were served drinking water only after repeatedly asking for the same and the price is something better not talked about ( Paid Rs.6015- for 4 people... totally ridiculous when compared to the food and services )

It can simply be rated as the worst place that  I have been to in a long long time. Even the road side stalls serves better tasting food than this place.

I was two times at the restaurant last December. The interior is nicely designed, depicts some of the lost culture of old Kolkata. The first time we ordered individual dishes, which were strongly advertised in her Z-Bangla show. Apart from the use of too much sweet in most of the recipes, we found the food quite appreciable. I would in particular recommend "chhana-r kaliya". The second time, we were left only with the option of the lunch buffet on a Saturday afternoon and we were disappointed to see blood marks on the chicken pieces in biriyani. Overall, a good attempt to bring forth the traditional Bengali food with a nice ambience and I think that some small flaws can be overlooked. We hope to see improvements in the future and wish a long life for the efforts.    

Greetings from Germany

Terribly over priced with substandard food and staff. 
The decor is nice and refreshing but the food is awful. We ordered Paturi which was stinking and dry, it was surely kept in the fridge for 2 days and just warmed in the micowave for us. The replaced it promptly only to serve the same stale fish again ! We felt sick that evening ! The Basanti Pulao and Chicken was not bad...The menu card was just a few xeroxed pieces of paper! There is no finesse at all...!

Sudipa is a regular name in Bengali house holds...its a shame that her restaurant is such a sham and shame on Zee network for promoting such a terrible place. 
Clearly they just want to use the TV show to fleece people here...its sad that they cant even live up to their reputation.

We will discourage people from going there. I went there as my Mom was a fan of hers....There are small shacks on the roadside that cant make such excellent home food ! We don,t need a self proclaimed celebrity and a media house promoting such pathetic food.

the experience was very bad due to the unprofessional service by the waiters....
.1).the "mochar chop" that we ordered was cold inside......
2)the "aloo bhaja" was soggy..
3).the gondhoral ghol was served in a plastic glass...
and suerly over priced
would never recommend this to anyone....
rating of 1 was for the good behaviour of the security guard.

Desperately over priced, pretentious and disappointing. These are the only 3 adjectives that come to your mind. Though I do not like her show, and the Zomato ratings warned me - I wanted to try this place because of some solid recommendations. believe me you _ I would rather spend my hard earned money on a dinner of Maggi and fried eggs that spend it here ever again.

Found the decor simplistic yet contemporary to the restaurants theme. Food appreciable. Mochar Paturi was truly disappointing....couldn't fathom what it really was...the fine shreds of Mocha should be felt in the mouth....the Luchi is a misnomer....it resembled and felt like Puri... Though we had ordered Luchi, & our kind waiter confirmed it was Luchi. Liked Bhetki Paturi, and loved the rosomalai.

Well, I had a bitter experience yesterday. I had gone yesterday with my family for the first time but really sorry to say that I had the worst experience of a restaurant till date!!
To start with the staff are totally unprofessional and etiquette less. we had to ask for water and spoons 3-4 times to get one. one has to ask for water otherwise they are least bothered. finally they put some water in the glasses that too warm!! There is no fridge i hope.  For taking daal they don't have bowls and when you ask for one they seem to hear the name for the first time. I do not complain about the ambiance; coz that hardly matters to me.
The buffet menu was worst of a kind, I had ever taken. I have been to almost all the bengali restaurants in kolkata barring a few. We had chosen for the buffet. The food quality was comparable to some street side shack!! Mutton was half cooked and fish was tasteless and overfried.
 To top all the buffet costs 1000/ bucks plus taxes!! for the non-veg menu. with taxes it comes around 1200/ per person!! not even good expensive restaurants charge that much!! Be it ohh calcutta, mainland china, barbecue nation; all charge around 750 per meal.
To our surprise the 1000 rupee buffet didn't have any jumbo prawns; bhetki or ilish!! 
There was no salad, starter; misti doi or papad. The menu consisted of rice, simple masur dal, aloo bhaja, crispy fried chicken, shrimp pulao, mutton curry and katla maach curry!! That's it my friends. desserts consisted of chutni, payesh and gulab jamun. To be frank the menu deserves not more that 500 bucks!! Nice way to cheat people and taking advantage of your prpular TV show!!
        I am not of the habit of writing bad things for anybody but this is the first time I am compelled to do so. I am not exaggerating the facts at all; if you don't believe, go and check it yourself !!
I am not going to visit that nonsense palce again and if you still have any doubt in your minds go to that place at your own risk!! 
I seriously wish i could rate it negatively; alas there is no option for that!!!! I shall put -5 for the useless place.

Thank you

My brother brought some food from a new place called "Sudipar Rannaghar". I was a bit curious how the food will be. 
The art of cooking is perhaps the most innovative form of work. especially when u experiment with it. After having 'Mochar Pulao, Keshariya pulao, Deshi Murgir dum, Golda Chingrir Malai kari',I was spellbound. And the "Chitol Cake" was out of this world. The food was not at all very spicy or oily. Its awesome & everyone should try this place at least 1s. And trust me when i say this,u will not be disappointed. Thank u Sudipar Rannaghar for this awesome treat.

Sometimes you just have to trust your Bong Instincts. I was a bit sceptical after reading a few of the " Rubbish " reviews on Zomato, to go to this place. But now that I've been there, I don't regret.  The place equally matches with the ethnic Bong atmosphere and etnicity and Sudipa's image. The place is easy to locate and the food is out of the world. If u miss good old grandma's cooking, I strongly urge you to go here. The food will remind you of the childhood days wherein the women of our household used to cook Bong food with much fervour and being strict to the recipies. Please don't listen to the misguiding reviews. Go and explore and fall in love with this place. I've had food here and also got loads of food parcelled for my family and now they are enjoying it as well at my home. The smile on my mother's face paid for it. 3 Cheers for Sudipa n all the best for your future endeavours...

Sometime you wish you can give a negative rating, well Sudipar Rannaghor will stir an exact feeling in you. This is a place where you pay a hefty amount for utter bullshit. A nice ambience also will turn out to a bad experience if the food is not good. Going here was perhaps my worst decision (more than 75% reviews are negative, and I can understand why so many people disliked this place after my experience here). We went for lunch, and had chingri macher malaicurry (gravy was bitter, prawns smelt weird, when asked about this reply was, this is the most authentic way to cook it), mochar chop (150 bucks, too dry inside), bhaja moonger dal (at least edible), murgi kosha (okayish, does not commensurate with the price you pay) and steamed rice (the best thing that was served). My pishi and my mom got sick in the evening, with intermittent vomiting and stomach ache. 6 Ballygunj Place, Kasturi, Oh! Calcutta, even Bhojohori Manna are the places which one should opt for bengali food, not this place. Not at all recommended. Some people are better off on television, Sudipar Rannaghor proved it.

Yesterday for the first time I went for lunch at SUDIPA'r RANNAGHAR and I believe it to be the last time.
To start with, the staffs were not at all welcoming rather the security is much more prompt.
I went with my wife and my 5 year old daughter, no one was showing us the table where to sit. Even no one has guided us for the buffet menus.
No one has asked us for water during the lunch.
And over all the foods doesn't have the tagging in front.
So overall the service was pathetic.

Second the food part. There were only 3 items in non veg menu whose quality can be available even in any corner of "running hotels". Even after the payment done, we waited for 10-15 mins for the PAN as someone went to brought it, ( how unprofessional ).

After paying buffet charge of Rs 950/- for non-veg is NOT AT ALL justified with the food , ambience and service.
 
My rannaghar is better I believe.

Good evening friends, 

This goes for the owner of the place as well.

Sunday lunch, wanted to spent a good time with my parents who wanted to be in this place, much influenced by the TV soaps and other commercial publicity.

First and foremost, yes I admit -  it was a wrong decision to chose the venue without an in-depth screening/study.

Sunday - only buffet , no ala-carte to be served - a terrible statement by the restaurant. 

Moreover when requested, to serve few main course dishes on table for my parents - "it was straight away dishonored saying its completely self serviced" - so my question, man why do you charge service tax if you are unable to give bare minimum service to your guests.
I won't say much about the presentation, it doesn't worth really. 

Food was good to be honest - 
I had non-veg serving - 
Gondho raj murgi,
bhaja moog dal, 
begun bhaja, 
polao, 
ar macch, 
kosha magsho (mutton)

Deserts: - payesh, tetuler chatni, gulab jamun

Does it worth 950/- + taxes, I dint think so.

It was a delight when I asked - do you serve finger bowl on the table or have to get that from somewhere - it was said they do serve! 
I was thankful for the gesture!

Would say don't go by endorsements by dada didi on TV soaps, try to get some insight of any place before spending.

My message for the Sudipar Rannaghor team - please work with your pricing / make some revisions on your buffet spread it doesnt worth.
Last but not the least - work with presentation to your guests, 
the place hv been decorated well. Interiors, ambience hv been crafted well, chef is making the platform to the highest level - dont take it down on the finishing line - with your gesture like that of rontu's biriyani centre - "nile ne nahole ja"

best wishes!
Gaurav

Multiple times to serve - they surely need training in Attentiveness. Hygiene outside the dining place one should not consider- terrible scene when you go to the washroom. Sudipa needs a visit to this place if she desires it to be a place of class and preference. I wouldn't recommend anyone

Well, I simply dont know why few people are branding this joint as horrible, too overpriced et al?? Yes,its a little overpriced but the quantity was sufficient for me and my family... we ordered sada bhaat,karaishutir kochuri, chholar dal ( the best preparation among all), sorshe ilish and bagda chingrir malaikari,each item was moderately spicy which was apt for us as we dont have too much of spices in our food,we polished it off with an excellent khejur amshottor chatni...
A word of caution for those,who take pride in having too much of 'jhaal' (rich) and snigger at us who prefer a bit of sweetness in their food,sorry folks,this place is not for u... :-)..

Today (14/2) we five members of the family visited much hyped Rannaghor for lunch. But simply awestuck. when we were slapped a bill for Rs 5426. This dampened our spirit. The cost of Moong Dal, Fish fry, and steamed rice is too high. Madam, your know average Bengali's pocket. So, why not have a re-think at your price structure. 

The staff is well behaved and gently. Food quality is okay. But simply, this restaurant is over pricy, many items are too costly without any logic, will rethink before visiting again.

GOAT BODY BLACK HAIR IN BUFFET MUTTON CURRY AND NO APOLOGY FROM STAFF.

This is the worst Restaurant we had been ever, especially the hygene.We went for buffet lunch on Sunday 31st Jan 2016 at 12.30am and were seated exactly opposite to their billing counter..While trying their mutton curry we found goat hair on the plate and this also happened on the next table where three ladies were having their lunch.Their staff tried to convince us is not hair but fibre..... really ridiculous.They didnot care to change the curry and people continued to take it from the buffet bowl.Just 5 mins later similar hair was found on my napkin and they again argued its fibre.
This is the condition of celebrity Bengali restaurent in Kolkata charging big but hygyne is zero .
We had been to Bhojohari Manna, Teroparban and their hygene is just beyond compare.Sudipar Ranna ghar should learn from them how to maintain hygyne.
One of the ladies in the next table left the lunch midway on finding similar hair and we also took one sweet item and left.
I still feel their staff has so much audacity to be so arrogant to convince it as fibre where its a clear goat hair on the plate even a lay man can see and happened on the other table.Instead of asking sorry their staff was trying to convince its no problem to take goat hair along with the curry.
Really ridiculous.
These type of of celebrity restaurents just sucks peoples money at the cost of peoples health where hygene is given a backseat .
We cleared the bills and left with empty stomach and went to another restaurent to complete our lunch .
We went for our anniversary lunch and this is the experience we got.Hats off Sudiper Ranna Ghar.

But to start with the menu was not fully available, food was atrocious, behaviour of the staff was highly unprofessional, the Ilish Machh had a fly, order was not completely delivered yet included in the bill. So overall an extremely bad experience and utterly atrocious.

Being a fan of the tv program Rannaghar I was looking for an outing with my family at Sudipa's Rannaghar. The menu was most ordinary. The food served to us at lunch was cold. The Mangsher Jhol was full of floating oil and strong smell of garlic and perhaps stale. The chicken in Lebu Lanka Murghi was oozing blood when the pieces were cut probably under cooked. The food quality overall attached to the brand Sudipa was much below par unfortunately. Finally all of us fell sick and were down with severe diarrhoea after our treat at this restaurant perhaps for lack of hygiene and bad cooking medium/oil..

When this restaurant was open on that day only I had decided that this time when I visit Kolkata this would be the place to visit.
I along with my family, my sister and his son. The reach ability  to the restaurant was easy.
Already had decided seeing the reviews what to order.
I ordered bhetki fish fry, and Paturi as starters. In main course ordered steam rice , basanti pulao, kosha mangsho, lebu lanka murgi and luchi also aloo bhaja.
In every  table there was hand sanitizer which I saw for the 1st time.
I loved the ambience and feel like many similar restaurants like oh Calcutta and 6 ballygunj place.
At first came the fish fry which was awesome with large size pieces.
Then came the main course in which loved the lebu lanka murgi and basanti pulao. The kosha mangsho could have been better and also pieces were not so good. The bhetki Paturi needs lot of improvement didn't like much 
I would suggest to reduce the size of luchi.
We had to serve ourselves.
There is lot of scope for improvement in service. Though food was served in quick time.
Also I would suggest for well printed menu card.
Food 4/5
Ambience 4/5
Service 3.5/5

Sudipa should go back to hosting Rannaghar instead of opening a bullshit restaurant....Really forgettable experience..and totally unworthy of all expenses.It's better to have dal,rice and aloo bhajji at a roadside dhaba.I even bet the daily home cooked food tastes much better.It's my earnest request to all the users not to get drawn to this hoax.

Very good food. Tried out this place with family. The food is delicious, a bit experimental from the traditional eay of Bengali dining. Must try the "Gondhoraj betki" and "lebu Lanka murgi". 
Ambience and service is excellent. Pricing is also very nominal. 
Surely im my recommendation for anyone looking for Bengali crusine with less spices.

As expected specially in Sudipar Rannaghor. .. 
It has to be more bengali & NOT BEANGLISH...

Extremely disappointed. The quality of food was appallingly bad and unhygienic - the fish was muddy and had obviously not been cleaned. At 850, the buffet is overpriced with no starters, no veg side dish and a very limited choice overall. The restro needs to pull up its act.

Visited the restaurant wid mom yesterday. The first thing that caught my attention was the stained seats of the sofas. Staff was attentive & cordial. The menu was very small. Ordered the Shammi Kabab, Chingri Malaikari & Chhanar Kalia. No wow factor there, the dishes tasted close to what one has at home. Where is the "restaurant quality" factor?? n then they charge you a 100 bucks for about 200gm of misti doi which was again equivalent to what you can have at any sweet shop in kolkata.  Overall a highly disappointing & overpriced affair.

I visited on New Year's Day 2015. I must say that the management and the cuisine are below standard. After opening time and entrance to the restaurant, had to wait 25 minutes before buffet was ready. Being New Year's Day, there was a special buffet. Food is poor. I do not recommend this place to anyone. To top it off the cost for 2 was ₹ 2500/-.

Sudipa is a pretty popular face for bengalis specially the 'kakimas' who religiously watch her show every evening.
So when the outlet opened, obviously it already had its brand value built along with millions of expectations.
I will be honest, I was a bit hesitant to visit here since the reviews on zomato had been very poor(in fact we had HATARI as a backup)
But we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the below:
Chingri Macher Malai Curry (Galda)
Bhetki Kata Chorchori
Mutton Kasa
Chicken Kasa
Topshe Fry
Cholar dal
Bhaja moong dal
Also bhaja and
Steamed Rice
What really impressed me was each dish had its unique taste. The mutton tasted distinctively different from the chicken;even the 2 dals had their individualistic flavours.
The Chingri Macher Malai Curry and Bhetki Kata Chorchori were the best for me. The interior is simple and adorned with some really amazing paintings portraying popular aspects of Bengali culture.
The service is slow and I think that's what brought about the bad reviews. We had to bear it as well when we ordered an extra plate of topshe Fry to have with dal but that arrived when we were almost done with everything. My advise would be sock up the service and this place can easily overthrow likes of 'Oh!Calcutta' and '6 Ballygunge Place:

Worst lunch experience I've had in a long time. First of all, the food is ridiculously overpriced, not even that good and barely enough in quantity. The waiters are extremely rude, it took me about 15 minutes to get them to switch off an a.c. Found an ant(AN ANT!! A WHOLE ANT!!!) in my rice, they exchanged it without any apologies and served me ANOTHER FRIGGING ANT in the replacement. They charged us for practically everything nonetheless. Completely ruined our lunch and our mood. I suggest they shut down as soon as possible before they feed all their customers insects and bugs. Stay away from this place unless you're looking to have a horrible and disgusting meal.

An experience that is easily forgettable. On 31st the buffet was such a let down. Sparse choice of items, bland food, extremely poor choice of desserts.
Buffets are meant to be lavish, not austere. Peeps at Sudipar Rannaghor, please check out spreads at 6 Ballygunge Place, Oh! Calcutta to learn how to arrange a buffet. 
Priced at 1250/- per head (all inclusive), it was a real dampener of a lunch. Total waste of money.

All in all, for a one time wonder it is okay. It is overpriced with respect to the quality and variety of the buffet. So no, won't be going back anytime soon :)

Had the grand New Year unlimited buffet on 31st Dec 2015 and I was amazed at the spread on offer! And the pricing was a steal. Decor was awesome and the staff extremely courteous. I must make special mention of the Manager who was taking  personalised care of every guest. Basanti Pulao, Prawn Malai Curry, Mutton and Gondhoraj Ghol were highlights. Thanks Sudipa for this wonderful gift to Kolkata. I felt cared for and welcome. Only minus point is the hand-wash area as the space is cramped and the area outside the hand-wash area should be well decorated to match with the awesome restaurant interiors.

Half cooked fish..no variety in dish..have to wait for 15min because every 2min bowls are empty..too much clumsy environment. Worst staff. Felt like I burned my money today.

The worst restaurant I ever visited in Kolkata. 
The staff are not at all trained, they give priority to the people they know personally. 
Yesterday I went there for lunch with my husband and son and was asked to wait, we did the same for 15 minutes.
After waiting for 15 minutes they called in another family who came while we were waiting. 
I bet the family was known to them so was give the priority, they don't maintain a register to write the names of the waiting customers and call them in accordingly. 
All the big restaurants in the city I visited do maintain it. 
Sudipa may be a celebrity but have no business sense at all. 
She should have learned the tricks of the
 trade first and then open a restaurant. 
I'll tell all my friends and family not to visit this restaurant at all. 
Sudipa please look into the matter.

Being in south kolkata place is really cozy with a moderate interior though the sitting is not much comfortable. Food is so so. But the pathetic thing is they have so many waiter to serve but due to some unknown reason they are not prompt or available even to fill empty glass of water. And the most importantly its too much costly compare to quality and quantity. I been there once and for me 1st impression is the last impression.

Dear Sudipa Mam
My parents were one of the first few visitor to your joint on the Mahalaya day, the whole idea was from my better half who's is an ardent follower of your show on TV. But there positive review and again my wife's pestering made me visit your joint last week. Our spread is as follows Royal Bengal fish fry was fantabulous, I'd tried a similar dish in one of the restaurants of kolkata. But I would rank your fish fry a way ahead of others. Then there comes Gandhoraj Bhetki, which was a real surprise and made both of us completely bowled by the taste. It was followed by Mochar paturi, which was definitely a good try, we need to have a palate to enjoy such a dish. For the main course it was steam rice Bhaja mooger daal and  julienne aloo bhaja. We ordered chitol peti which could have been better considering its consistency. Our main attraction was Galda chingri r malai curry which actually lived upto our expectations considering the size of the chingri and the taste of the gravy which was simply awe. 
To me and my wife it was definitely a great experience and your staff were quite courteous.

Had Musur dal with chingri, begun vaja, chingri with lal shak, katla macher kaliya & kosha mangso, chatni, payes & rasogolla. Buffet cost 850 for 1 parson. Why people will go such a restaurant to have musur dal or lal shak? Kosha mangso is very hard. Dessert placed in billing counter. Can't imagine. Space is very insufficient. Overall had a very poor experience.

Nothing much to say about the paratha and pulao .Our Sunday lunch turned out to be such a disaster .Service equally slow ,more than 45 mins they took to start serving and not worth the money at all .

Weekends for me is finding new places to visit in Kolkata and outskirts. So knowing about this new restaurant in Gariahat gave me a reason to visit it. I am particularly fond of Bengali cuisn and think that gave me more delight to gorge on the food. Being Bangal, ilish is my all time favourite, however  I would rate Galda chingri more in this restaurant. Getting a chance to taste the payesh was the best part of it, as you do not get it usually in restaurants. So I know now where to go now. Thanks Sudipa for this good initiative. Wish you all the best!

If only some sugar free dessert can be included then I can enjoy more being diabetic :)

My In Laws who are senior citizens and cannot go to the restaurants requested me to get food from your restaurant for Sunday Lunch as they are very fond of your TV show. But little did I know that I would not be able to fulfil their wish. When I reached the place I said that I wanted to place take away order. No body bother to give me a glass of water. After few minutes I was told that on Sunday only buffet menu is available. Then I said fine as I cannot take away buffet menu can you allow me to order portions from the buffet menu itself and price it at A-La-Carte rate? After few moments of deliberations the young manager who behaves like a sultan ( no please no sorry word is in his dictionary ) said that no we CANNOT give you food. I came out and have taken a promise of not visiting this place any more because of bad behaviour and I think many more will have the same opinion as you have a pathetic bunch of uncourteous staff. I think this place is only meant for celebrities and not for commoners. Madam Sudipa if you care for your business then given some courtesy lesson to your staff.

This is one of the Worst Restaurant in Kolkata we have ever visited in a loooooong time !!!!! Went there with a friend and his family from Delhi. I never heard of this place, but my Delhi friends insisted a visit, as the owner is a well known  TV Chef (?) . The place looks good once you are inside . However the Menu card is limited and the food takes a long time to arrive and tastes unexpectedly drab & ORDINARY !!!. How come Kolkatans are still bearing the burden of such bad taste ?? Really felt cheated with the whole dinner experience at that awefull place.

We searched out the establishment expecting a gourmet experience. What we experienced is as follows:
The ushering in was warm. The interiors, very new, lacked character except for the potchitra style paintings. The restroom  was filthy.
The establishment is focussed on its buffet spread, which was quite staple, as served across various establishments in the area. Some of the a la carte offerings which sounded off-beat and special, were not available, such as Kumro Chingri, or Nolen-gurer icecream. The a la carte offerings seemed to rely heavily on the buffet menu!
Royal Bengal Fish Fry was good. But I have had much superior fish fry at Sagarika, Diamond Harbour.
Gandharaj Bhetki was delicately delicious.
Chitol Peti Jhal: It was actually a steak cut, not a "peti" served in a spicy sauce. It was Jhal, but not fresh. Very disappointing offering.
The bhaja muger daal was a disaster, with coagulated lumps, and the distinctive flavour of roasted daal missing.
The vegetarian buffet spread was very descent.
Overall, I would say there are better places for experiencing Bengali cuisine. And the gourmet connection suggested by the name is misleading.
The pricing is moderate, at Rs. 2560 for 3 persons.
Recommendation:  May visit if passing by; certainly not a destination.

Dear Sudipa, I am writing this as a feedback of the food I ate today at your esteemed restaurant at Purna Das Road.I went with my wife and mother in law with many expectations. My wife really adores you and my mother in law is a regular viewer of your world famous TV show.I ordered some ethnic Bengali cuisines like Gondhoraj Bhetki, Bhetki Paturi, Bagda Chingri Malaikari, bhape ilish, deshi murgi dom. I am sorry to say that I never ate such badly cooked food for a long time. The gondhoraj bhetki was prepared with curd ( which was not mentioned in the menu) and the first bite, I felt like vomiting.I couldn't eat it. Bhetki Paturi was served mild hot which also was not enjoyed fully. Then in the main course, the Chingri Malaikari was made too sweet. We couldn't enjoyed it either. The deshi murgi was so hard that even with both hands, I couldn't eat it. The only eatable dish was the bhape ilish but that too was made with curd. I had tried out few Bengali restaurants in Kolkata like Kasturi, Fish Fish, Oh Calcutta, Tero Parbon and they all kept some standards. I didn't expected this so bad. Request you to kindly make some time and have a taste by yourself. I am sure you will find the reason why I wrote this piece of essay. I hope with all my due respect your restaurant becomes famous like your TV show

Well our visit turned out to be a disaster. The Buffett spread was decent, and we had just about started digging in when a dead fly appeared from inside my Phulkopir roast. Eewww!!!! And the best part was the staff was shamelessly unapologetic about this. They just offered to change my plate with an expression like "we expected a cockroach, but you got just a fly". Well am sure the restaurant would do well considering the fan following and popularity of its owner. But for me it's substandard. Btw, I did write a private message to the owner, and on the FB page of the restaurant, and am yet to get a reply. I DO NOT recommend this place to anyone. The city doesn't lack authentic and hygienic Bengali joints.

Visited the place last week with my friends, must say the interiors were done tastefully, ambiance is quiet good over all a perfect environment one desires when dining out. Food was well cooked with good servicing provided by the staff. However, the only issue that I had, was with the quantity of food provided compared to the amount that I  had paid. apart from the quantity served on my plate the quality of food, service and ambiance was satisfactory. Will surely visit the place again and shall also recommend it to my family and friends.

We had Saturday afternoon lunch. Its Rs. 850 per person at the buffet, so for 2 people its 1700 bucks. Food was good though menu is limited. We liked the lobster very much but Chicken was not up to expectation. Sweet dishes were nice too. 
Space is limited inside and we felt that they could start "Thali" instead of the buffet. Because of limited space going up and down to the serving counter is a problem. Also, menu could be a little more diverse. 
Over all we had an enjoyable afternoon and might go back again.

We went for buffet menu and felt disappointed and robbed in the end. There were no starter items with only one veg side dish. We paid around Rs. 900 each plate for moong dal, plain rice, alu bhaja, posto bata, fulcopi roast, chicken, parawn malaicurry and some regular deserts. The price was steep high compared to what was offered with very limited choice of food in buffet menu. Also food taste is not so great for this steep high. Place is good for average mid level celebs but certainly not for food lovers.

As well are probashis, we had unfortunately not heard about the bad reviews of the Sudipar Rannaghar. We went there hoping to taste some really delicious dishes which we hoped would rival those prepared at her hugely television show. However, we are utterly shocked and disheartened to taste the dishes. More so as the restaurant bears the brand name of SUDIPA. Not only the prices sky high which do not match the quality,  the service as well as the ambience is poor, to say the least ! All the dishes were exhobitantly hot (with no sugar), and we found the Elish dishes to be deep fried and of  small  size. All in all, a disastrous experience!  SUDIPA, please  close down. At least, it will save our time and money!

Visited the place last week with my friends, must say the interiors were done tastefully, ambiance is quiet good over all a perfect environment one desires when dining out. Food was well cooked with good servicing provided by the staff. However, the only issue that I had, was with the quantity of food provided compared to the amount that I  had paid. apart from the quantity served on my plate the quality of food, service and ambiance was satisfactory. Will surely visit the place again and shall also recommend it to my family and friends.

We had Saturday afternoon lunch. Its Rs. 850 per person at the buffet, so for 2 people its 1700 bucks. Food was good though menu is limited. We liked the lobster very much but Chicken was not up to expectation. Sweet dishes were nice too. 
Space is limited inside and we felt that they could start "Thali" instead of the buffet. Because of limited space going up and down to the serving counter is a problem. Also, menu could be a little more diverse. 
Over all we had an enjoyable afternoon and might go back again.

We went for buffet menu and felt disappointed and robbed in the end. There were no starter items with only one veg side dish. We paid around Rs. 900 each plate for moong dal, plain rice, alu bhaja, posto bata, fulcopi roast, chicken, parawn malaicurry and some regular deserts. The price was steep high compared to what was offered with very limited choice of food in buffet menu. Also food taste is not so great for this steep high. Place is good for average mid level celebs but certainly not for food lovers.

Date of visit: 21 Nov 2015.

As well are probashis, we had unfortunately not heard about the bad reviews of the Sudipar Rannaghar. We went there hoping to taste some really delicious dishes which we hoped would rival those prepared at her hugely television show. However, we are utterly shocked and disheartened to taste the dishes. More so as the restaurant bears the brand name of SUDIPA. Not only the prices sky high which do not match the quality,  the service as well as the ambience is poor, to say the least ! All the dishes were exhobitantly hot (with no sugar), and we found the Elish dishes to be deep fried and of  small  size. All in all, a disastrous experience!  SUDIPA, please  close down. At least, it will save our time and money!

the restraurant has great interiors.....kolkatas babu potochitro adorn the walls.the items in buffet were good.taste of some items like kosha mutton, diamond fry,zafrani murgi were up to the mark.chanchra was excellent even polao.i did not like your vegetarian section.dholar dalna n fulkopi could be made better.add some more desserts.again when you are pricing buffet at more than 900 bucks,kindly arrange for more starters some of them should be unlimited atleast.your waiters are very confused.employ better staff to increase efficiency level.groom them well.service is not up to the mark.thinking of your service,i decide not to visit again as i was denied even a finger bowl on 14.0.2015.

Horrible food. Mutton kasha is stale. Starters given after main course. How can sudipa think that hosting a cookery show can make her expert in opening a restaurant. All staffs are inefficient. Taken from production level.  One known to me. Everyday cook is changed. How can she cheat people ' s money like this. I think once visited second time no one will visit. Requesting sudipa to take trained staffs otherwise one day people will break her restaurant
 As I have written in fb sudipa blocked me. But she does not know I will write more and let everyone know her restaurant quality and stop going there.

Sudipa, I am already a big fan of yours. I regularly watch your T.V. show and try experimenting with the recipes you forecast. Visited your restaurant a few days back and there is just one word for you and your team- ‘Awesome’. A real improvement indeed! However, my suggestions would be Sada Murgir Dom with Zafrani Pulao- a perfect duo to pamper your taste buds.

Being a vegetarian, I found this restaurant quite good. Although, I had limited options but honestly, each and every dish I ordered was delicious indeed. Perfect place for an ideal Bhuri Bhoj! In dessert section, I had payesh which was nice. I think they should definitely increase their dessert items since taste wise, I found all the veg items good! May be it can also be a good option for the non-vegetarians.

Had visited this restaurant with family...I must say that this is one of the best Bengali food joints in Kolkata. We had basmati rice, Ilish Bhapa, Kosha Mangsho and chutney. All dishes were tender and well cooked with the perfect mix of spices. Chutney was a real paradise for me. Besides ambiance and quality of food, the waiters were also courteous. I guess the management has done a good job in managing the restaurant in every aspect. A must try for all Bengali food lovers!

Went to this place with a lot of expectations , especially mom who's a big fan of the cookery show.....well where do i start?...the service was terrible...the staff were unsure about what to do with their customers...the taste & quality of food was as good as crap....quantity even worse.....the "mochar ghonto" didn't even seem to have a trace of mocha in it and almost tasted like the sandwich filling from a vernacular sweet  shop....the sink in the washroom was so small that you'd do well to fit your hand between the tap end outlet and the drain....and the list goes on....
highly OVERPRICED ( 500 for 2 is bullshit ) & extremely extremely DISAPPOINTED
i vow to NEVER RETURN here...

Pathetic piece of a eatery. A mockery to bengali cuisines. Even if someone pays me to eat there in future, I will stay away. Decor and ambience doesn't make a restaurant, the food does.  

Ps: just wanna give it a 5 star so that it's overall rating is averaged out!!! 😁

If only interior designing & brand name would have earned a positive review, sudipar rannaghor would have scored higher. Unfortunately, it doesn't! And that's where we come to the food served here. We had ordered basanti polao, gondhoraj bhetki paturi & chicken kosha. The rice of the polao  was quite ordinary, bhetki paturi was extremely sour, and it was mangshor jhol rather than kosha. The chicken wasn't tenderly cooked either. Tastewise very ordinary. In contrast, prices are rather high compared to other such kind of food joints. The quantity is quite unimpressive too. In all, a very dissatisfying experience.

I normally do not write reviews on Zomato but was compelled to post my views today. I am a big fan of Sudipa and Rannaghor on Zee Bangla and was extremely excited about visiting this place. The experience was not good, to say the least.

The food was excellent, no doubts about that. But when it came to service, it was horrifying. Everyone is clueless. One has to wait for eternity before an order is taken. Once you have decided what you want to eat, you might as well go out, watch a movie at Priya and come back to see your order is still not ready.

Slow service is something which everyone at the restaurant complained about. One group of guests even left after waiting for two hours; we had to wait for an hour and a half thankfully.

And the prices of items were not in sync with the quantity. Who would want to buy mochar chop for 80 bucks? 

Clearly, Sudipa hired a bad team to run her business and needs to rectify before it is too late.

Hosting a cookery show and running a restaurant is not the same ball game. The thought was good but the execution is below average. The interiors are nice and that's about it! Food is average and after the long wait and the rude behaviour of the staff and the owner how can the food taste good! In this competitive market I don't see this place going a long way in future. Sudipa says problems happen in the teething period but I would like to tell her that this is definitely not applicable for this industry. Fame and faith once lost is lost forever!

Worst dining experience ever!  Long wait, inefficient  and understaffed with no coordination among themselves, a vacuum in the name of ambience. And the management (if there is one) seems to be very ignorant about all this . I went there on the 1st Nov. 
 After all the hype we had expected some good quality food but were disappointed. 
I would suggest the management that expectations run high when you have a celebrity name attached to your establishment; so you need to be on your toes rather than being lax.

This restaurant is getting constant poor reviews , the management authority is seeing all the poor reviews in zomato but seems to be ignorant and not taking any necessary steps to rectify the flaws. Such arrogance will certainly lead to the downfall of this restaurant. people go restaurants to eat good food, not to see the glimpse of a celebrity cookery show host, and when people go to such expensive restaurant they expect good behaviour from staffs and good food from chefs but this restaurant lacks both and authority seems to be reluctant to rectify their faults and also has the audacity to ask the customers to return to the restaurant again to have the same rotten food and get same bad treatment. Unless and until the authority makes drastic changes to their cooking and serving staffs people must avoid this restaurant so that the celebrity owners get the idea that only reputation doesn't lead to success in this gourmet field.

I have been there in Sudipta's Rannaghar in Triangular Park on 24th Oct'15. I am totally disappointed with the taste, cost, management and available space. Stuffs were totally confused. They served us welcome drink at the end of the our lunch. When they started serving starer, after serving 1 kebab, suddenly they stopped serving and took almost another 15 minutes to serve the 2nd one. There was no food tongs to use for the sweets item, so we had to use our hand for that. Coming to the menu item, I had "Sada Murgir Dam" in which salt was missing in chicken pieces. In Paneer and prawn Item, too much of sugar had been used   and again salt was missing which make the taste very poor. Only Mutton, fish fry and Payes were very good. Cost was too high for buffet lunch. The restaurant is very congested, not spacious & suffocating which is not actually proper for buffet system. There are lots of thing to say but these are the most important things which I have noticed and mentioned here. Please take care of all these issues.

As suggested by my mom had to travel all the way from barast to this place just to have lunch, as she's a big fan of ms sudeepa.We went there on Oct 22nd/NOBOMI day.

This review is not for the food & beverages served at the restaurant as we never got an opportunity till the last to have a meal there, This feedback is on the service quality & the way they are managing the business.

Every restaurant gets crowded during PUJO, but thats upto the management & their reputation how they can  manage the footfall.

1. Waited there for almost 40 minutes to get a place from 3.30pm till 4.10pm & the restaurant could not arrange  a place for 2.

2. Lady receptionist ( named YASHPAL) was too casual , rude and did not show basic empathy for people those who came for a paid ( an expensive restaurant) lunch & not for any free service

TO MY SURPRISE ,SHE'S busy talking to her boyfriend over phone & dint not bother to talk something very personal in front of many hungry & impatient customers.She went on talking private without any hesitation & for some time i failed to understand the kind of lady Ms Sudeepa has hired for fir 1st business venture.

I could manage to intervene twice into her personal conversations and asked twice about the status of my reservation. later i realized she did not even write my name or no on her notepad.

Later she said (almost after 25 mins) she said she can give me a shared table after 15 mins.

all these while shes diverted not less than 6-8 customers to the neighboring restaurants because of her silly & casual approach

That's too much , as its crowded and there's hardly any vacant chairs left.
At last we gave up, & had to move out of that place.dont know if my mom would ever like to visit that place again.

WE were lucky enough to enjoy the meal after walking into another restuarnt on the same road offering bengali buffet with a much exhaustive menu with a lesser cost than that of sudeepas rannaghar.

Visited this place for saptami lunch with family. With a new bengali joint hitting the city during the festive time and the much known Sudipar rannaghar branding, it was quite an obvious choice to try during this pujo. Honestly, the expectation was that it would be atleast 'not bad' if not 'great'. But, sorry to say that the first experience has not been pleasant enough to risk a visit to this place again. The look and feel is nice, with paintings depicting the babu culture and good ambient music. So, the first impression was soothing enough. However, the real story begins thereafter.

FOOD-
They serve gandhoraj ghol as welcome drink followed by the starters 'Royal bengal diamond fry' (the only thing that tasted great) and 'chicken kabab'. The twist in the tale is that you are allowed to have only one piece each. Not sure why they call it 'unlimited' buffet!
For main course, the buffet included rice, zafrani pulao (which was flat and pretty close to the plain rice), mung dal, jhurjhure alubhaja (cold and not 'jhurjhure' at all), niramish alur dom, chhanar kaliya (which was actually a tasteless preparation of paneer), chingrir malaikari, sada murgir dom, kosha mangsho. Everything was plain average and regular in taste. Alur dom and paneer made at our home are anyday more delicious than those at this joint.
Coming to the desserts, they had only chatni payesh and sondesh, all pretty average (read poor) in taste and presentation.

SERVICE-
Non-attending and unprofessional staff members.
We had to follow up even for refilling our glasses of water.
The plates (for starters, main course and desserts) just kept on getting accumulated on the table and were not cleared till the end.

Few more things that did not seem to be cool about this place-

1.The buffet counters are quite congested, especially the dessert counter (which is actually the cash counter too).
2. While waiting, saw that they were spraying room freshner with glasses placed on the tables upside up!
3. There is a poster outside the joint with the menu printed on it. But once you get in, you neither get a menu card nor find any tags in the buffet counters with the names of the dishes to help you. Come on. Are we meant to learn the menu before entering!
4. Finger bowls are a must after bengali buffet. It is ridiculous that they dont provide that and one has to go to the washroom and has to wait in a queue too when its crowded. To add on, the way to washroom is risky because of the slippery floor and stairs one has to go through.
5. Request to the owners, Atleast stick to what you are comitting for, please. Veg kabab was not mentioned in the menu to be only for vegetarians. Nowhere was it written that chicken kabab was an one-piece-only affair. We did see papad in the menu but not on the counters.
6. Rs.950 is a price too high compared to what is served. Have been to all other major bengali joints available in the city. Many of them serve much better quality and quantity of food in lower prices.

To conclude, I would just say I am really dissappointed. As a bengali, I feel its our tradition that we love to feed people. But, from the very beginning at this place, we always felt that the 'heart to feed well' and the 'warmth' were missing. Business is important, we understand, but bad impression wont help it either!

Paradise lost !! People should spend some extra bucks and visit oh Calcutta. This new food destination is nothing but full disaster. Mrs. Sudipa, u must concentrate on ur television show. This restaurant is nothing but waste of money. In Kolkata, we have so many options for Bengali cuisine or simply cook at home.

Been to this new outlet of Bengali food today for lunch & came back disappointed. The main problem here is lack of space management. It's too small for an outlet,catering only buffet. The service is erratic. We  have to wait for about 15 minutes to get the starters. The starters had only two items: a sort of chicken dumpling(don't know why they called it kebab) and a crispy fish fry. The main course had handful of items, compared to the hefty sum they're charging per head. The white pulao is so so. So is the paneer dish. How come most of the prawns  had  only head & the flesh lost in the gravy. The chicken is bland & mutton is rubbery, too hard to chew. The dessert section had only  semi thick payes & sandesh.
  I feel this place needs to have  quite a few basic changes. The management must understand their limitations. This place is unsuitable for buffet. The standard of food & service must be improved a lot. The pricing is too high even for a Puja special menu.

I know it's Durga Puja, I know its a new joint, I know there's rush! 

But above everything I am a hard critic of food and nothing can change that.

Sudipa's Rannaghor - 

My expectations : A bright, happy celebrity kitchen, plush location, bengali cuisine, maybe a little costly.

What I found : 

* A rather unimaginative and badly lit office canteen theme (it's been done after tearing down the beautiful "Baati Chokha" benarasi restaurant).

* Tired and confused waiters forgetting to serve water in clean glasses, clearing tables and to announce it's an all day buffet service due to pujas.

* The buffet has food similar to a lunch at an office seminar or a moderate "Para" picnic - in fact, this was very bengali about the cuisine. 

The dessert section, placed on the cash counter almost eclipsing the poor cashier, comprised of a bowl of payesh (with a layer of dust, since nobody would touch that), some sticky chutney and plain sandesh with a rose petal shoved into each one for added attraction.

*The ambience? Hmmm... very interesting rest room that snugly blocks the way to the kitchen service passage with a step one's supposed to miss! The wash basin's in the toilet since they didn't have finger bowls (due to Pujas!?) and hence a long queue (like in Biye baris -once more a bengali trait)

*When asked why is the buffet priced at 955/- per person, the poor girl at the reception seemed puzzled and asked back "Why, wasn't there chicken, mutton and prawn???" 

I tried to explain that in a buffet priced like that, there should be a little variety style and glamour in the food and not just chicken-mutton-prawn! 

Her very satisfying answer was "I'll inform Ma'm!"

Hmmm! A bengali Michelin marvel it seems!

My rather foodie suggestion to Ma'm, our beloved Supdipadi, would be :

* To have some trained and spry service staff .

* A spruced up menu full of surprises like in her shows.

* A little target specific and justified pricing of the food.

So overall : 1.5 for the location and the Sweet Supari at the reception!

Visited this place for saptami lunch with family. With a new bengali joint hitting the city during the festive time and the much known Sudipar rannaghar branding, it was quite an obvious choice to try during this pujo. Honestly, the expectation was that it would be atleast 'not bad' if not 'great'. But, sorry to say that the first experience has not been pleasant enough to risk a visit to this place again. The look and feel is nice, with paintings depicting the babu culture and good ambient music. So, the first impression was soothing enough. However, the real story begins thereafter.

FOOD-
They serve gandhoraj ghol as welcome drink followed by the starters 'Royal bengal diamond fry' (the only thing that tasted great) and 'chicken kabab'. The twist in the tale is that you are allowed to have only one piece each. Not sure why they call it 'unlimited' buffet!
For main course, the buffet included rice, zafrani pulao (which was flat and pretty close to the plain rice), mung dal, jhurjhure alubhaja (cold and not 'jhurjhure' at all), niramish alur dom, chhanar kaliya (which was actually a tasteless preparation of paneer), chingrir malaikari, sada murgir dom, kosha mangsho. Everything was plain average and regular in taste. Alur dom and paneer made at our home are anyday more delicious than those at this joint.
Coming to the desserts, they had only chatni payesh and sondesh, all pretty average (read poor) in taste and presentation.

SERVICE-
Non-attending and unprofessional staff members.
We had to follow up even for refilling our glasses of water.
The plates (for starters, main course and desserts) just kept on getting accumulated on the table and were not cleared till the end.

Few more things that did not seem to be cool about this place-

1.The buffet counters are quite congested, especially the dessert counter (which is actually the cash counter too).
2. While waiting, saw that they were spraying room freshner with glasses placed on the tables upside up!
3. There is a poster outside the joint with the menu printed on it. But once you get in, you neither get a menu card nor find any tags in the buffet counters with the names of the dishes to help you. Come on. Are we meant to learn the menu before entering!
4. Finger bowls are a must after bengali buffet. It is ridiculous that they dont provide that and one has to go to the washroom and has to wait in a queue too when its crowded. To add on, the way to washroom is risky because of the slippery floor and stairs one has to go through.
5. Request to the owners, Atleast stick to what you are comitting for, please. Veg kabab was not mentioned in the menu to be only for vegetarians. Nowhere was it written that chicken kabab was an one-piece-only affair. We did see papad in the menu but not on the counters.
6. Rs.950 is a price too high compared to what is served. Have been to all other major bengali joints available in the city. Many of them serve much better quality and quantity of food in lower prices.

To conclude, I would just say I am really dissappointed. As a bengali, I feel its our tradition that we love to feed people. But, from the very beginning at this place, we always felt that the 'heart to feed well' and the 'warmth' were missing. Business is important, we understand, but bad impression wont help it either!

Paradise lost !! People should spend some extra bucks and visit oh Calcutta. This new food destination is nothing but full disaster. Mrs. Sudipa, u must concentrate on ur television show. This restaurant is nothing but waste of money. In Kolkata, we have so many options for Bengali cuisine or simply cook at home.

Been to this new outlet of Bengali food today for lunch & came back disappointed. The main problem here is lack of space management. It's too small for an outlet,catering only buffet. The service is erratic. We  have to wait for about 15 minutes to get the starters. The starters had only two items: a sort of chicken dumpling(don't know why they called it kebab) and a crispy fish fry. The main course had handful of items, compared to the hefty sum they're charging per head. The white pulao is so so. So is the paneer dish. How come most of the prawns  had  only head & the flesh lost in the gravy. The chicken is bland & mutton is rubbery, too hard to chew. The dessert section had only  semi thick payes & sandesh.
  I feel this place needs to have  quite a few basic changes. The management must understand their limitations. This place is unsuitable for buffet. The standard of food & service must be improved a lot. The pricing is too high even for a Puja special menu.

I know it's Durga Puja, I know its a new joint, I know there's rush! 

But above everything I am a hard critic of food and nothing can change that.

Sudipa's Rannaghor - 

My expectations : A bright, happy celebrity kitchen, plush location, bengali cuisine, maybe a little costly.

What I found : 

* A rather unimaginative and badly lit office canteen theme (it's been done after tearing down the beautiful "Baati Chokha" benarasi restaurant).

* Tired and confused waiters forgetting to serve water in clean glasses, clearing tables and to announce it's an all day buffet service due to pujas.

* The buffet has food similar to a lunch at an office seminar or a moderate "Para" picnic - in fact, this was very bengali about the cuisine. 

The dessert section, placed on the cash counter almost eclipsing the poor cashier, comprised of a bowl of payesh (with a layer of dust, since nobody would touch that), some sticky chutney and plain sandesh with a rose petal shoved into each one for added attraction.

*The ambience? Hmmm... very interesting rest room that snugly blocks the way to the kitchen service passage with a step one's supposed to miss! The wash basin's in the toilet since they didn't have finger bowls (due to Pujas!?) and hence a long queue (like in Biye baris -once more a bengali trait)

*When asked why is the buffet priced at 955/- per person, the poor girl at the reception seemed puzzled and asked back "Why, wasn't there chicken, mutton and prawn???" 

I tried to explain that in a buffet priced like that, there should be a little variety style and glamour in the food and not just chicken-mutton-prawn! 

Her very satisfying answer was "I'll inform Ma'm!"

Hmmm! A bengali Michelin marvel it seems!

My rather foodie suggestion to Ma'm, our beloved Supdipadi, would be :

* To have some trained and spry service staff .

* A spruced up menu full of surprises like in her shows.

* A little target specific and justified pricing of the food.

So overall : 1.5 for the location and the Sweet Supari at the reception!

good ambiance. staff cordial and pleasant but a bit novice . Variety of the spread was limited. 
quality of cooking is surprisingly awful. totally tasteless food. only saving grace was the prawn preparation
common washroom for ladies and gents is not acceptable. The floor in front of the washroom should be made nonskid immediately to avoid a major mishap.

Cons :
1. Service is pathetic. Only two starters which are served at Table. They will serve you only one piece and you will have to wait for 15 minutes for the next round.
2. Although Luchi is written on the menu it was not available.
3. Waiters are not even removing the soiled plates from the table. We had to ask them to do so.
4. Food quality was average.
5. Very poor choice of vegetarian food.
6. Desserts items were just simple.
7. They only have a small washroom so washing up after a meal feels like standing in Queue to view the Deshopriyopark Puja. They don't even offer finger bowl on their own.
In short Just because a Restaurant is associated with a Celebrity
 does not mean it will serve great quality of food and offer good service.

Went here on ashtami night for dinner....n was disappointed with the entire arrangement. Service is slow and poor. Over priced according to the food they serve. Buffet menu had less items compared to other places. Mutton was undercooked. All good hopes about this place has been turned down.

Though I know that during the Puja maddening rush any New Restaurant would crumble under the immense pressure of table turnovers and is also not a right time to review any restaurant based only on their Buffet but still I found certain things that can be revamped. And that is the service. As far as the food it was awesome to taste but was cold by the time we could find a place in the restaurant. The decor of the place is wonderful specially the chandeliers. Sitting is a bit cramped specifically the 2 seaters.
The Servers should ensure that atleast the waters tumblers are refilled time to time. We were served the initial starters after 38 minutes of being seated and the first starter was the chicken kebab which was cold to the core but was made up by the blazing hot fish fries. The Pulao, Steamed Rice, Dal was cold but tasted wonderful. If it had been served hot then it would have been out of the world. The paneer was completely tasteless (not well seasoned) as there was no gravy in the paneer, just a few cubes of fried paneer in the chafing dish. The Jhuri Alu Bhaja was soggy, I missed the crunch. The Prawn, Chicken and Mutton was wonderful but would have been outstanding if it was hot.
Places to improve:
1. The table in which we were made to sit was not wiped before seating.
2. The glasses in which we were served water were not clean and was stained. I had to ask the server to change the glasses. He did not seem too happy when was asked to do so.
3. We constantly asked the waiter to refil our water tumblers but somehow he forgot everytime. We had our entire meal without a single drop of water in our glasses.
Overall the service needs to be revamped or else the place will turn similar to any roadside eatery.

I would definitely try out the restaurant once again on a normal busy day. But being a completely new name in the crowd you guys are awesome. Hope you shine and grow fast.

The food was simply horrible... Starter had only a fish fry which was served cold and chicken kebab which had no taste...... Chicken served for main course was tasteless..... Only thing edible was the prawn malai curry. Desert section was placed on cash counter. The restaurant is filled with unprofessional people , the service was very bad, they didnot voluntarily give any figure bowl until I pressurized them to give one.

We visited this place during the middle of Durga Puja on Saptami for lunch. Quite naturally, it was packed up and there was a  queue. We enrolled our names at around 1.15 and finally got our turn at 3.15. It was a horrible experience till that point in time. However, once we got in, Sudipa di and Agnidev da welcomed us. Sudipa di went to the extent of serving the welcome drink and arranging stuff, which was understandable. The crowd waiting outside was quite uncontrollable (having waited for so long) and that gesture from her somewhat cooled the atmosphere. Coming to the food, there was buffet on offer with some selective Bangali dishes which were cooked in a homely fashion. Starters, main course items and desserts tasted absolutely simple and fine. However, to our surprise, most of the main course trays became empty in no time (may be due to the sudden surge of hungry folks). And those remained empty for quite sometime. Ambience was apt with fabulous age-old Calcutta 'babu' paintings hanging and Ramkumar Chattopadhyay's 'toppa's playing. Overall, it was a feel good experience, although gaps in terms of flawless customer management and fulfilling client expectations can be bridged with time and experience. There will be an anticipation of a better experience the next time I visit this place or recommend someone.

We could not think that we have worry about quality when someone linked with this restaurant is well known in Rannaghar.
Starter kebab was smelling and couldn't not eat. In main course mutton was again having smell and could not touch. Chicken was vanished from the counter as it was having complain of being half cooked. Veg was not having options. Desert.....I cook better Payes than it was there. Chatni I did not take as I do not take which food does not look good or smell good. Overall very disappointed with the visit to the restaurant. Off course the price was exorbitant.

A buffet at 950 INR i.e. priced higher than mainland China, Bar B Q nation, has no waiting room. We went there at 7:50 p.m.  restaurant was closed; staff said it will open at 8:00 p.m. Please have a check with ur timings instead of flaunting ur informations.  When we came outside another person told us that we can wait outside on footpath. This is ridiculous... u don’t even have a well managed waiting area for your customers .,just 10 mins before....  and  u have a price rate at par with these restaurants.....

We were looking out for a Bengali cuisine restaurant for our particular guest, who is a new Bong jamai...and we preferred to give a visit to Sudipar rannaghor. The place is well decorated with beautiful paintings and the ambience is nice over here. Coming to food, we were given a choice to have the food either from buffet or from menu card. We preferred to sit and eat. We started with Royal Bengal Diamond fry...I must say if ever anyone wishes to visit this place do try it out...made from bhetki maach this fry is surely a star starter. Our starter was followed by luchi and dhokar dalna. I loved this dhokar dalna very much. The gravy was itself very tasty. Zafrani pulao along with sada murgir dum didn't go well. But thanks to Sudipa for suggesting us to have kosha mangsho which was the perfect combination with zafrani pulao. Finally we ended our dinner with Chutney of the day. Though the food over here is a bit costly yet it's worth trying it out over here. The staff over here was friendly and courteous. And a surprise meeting with Sudipa at her Rannaghor surely made this a memorable visit.

It's a new place for Bengali Food lovers..near Triangular Park. We went to taste the Lunch buffet menu. The inside decor is pretty good with a soothing music. The food items are mouthwatering and very much tasty. From the Diamond fry to kababs all are pretty good. Zafrani pulao..bhetki maach er kata chocchori,Golda chingrir malaikari [ quite big in size ] and mutton kosha are too much tasty.And a pleasant dessert at the end. Just loved it.Its worth of money. Just go and have it..dnt miss it

New place just around Triangular Park with an array of sumptuous buffet lunch consisting of a whole Bengali cuisine. Ambiance is pretty homely and so is the meal which is simple yet tasty. Price tag is well ok for now given the fact it is only a few days old and has opened in peak festive season. As for being a Bengali and loving to eat just one thing to say,"kobji dubiye khao".(just dig in and eat)

Visited the place for lunch today. Had loads of expectations from this place. The pujo buffet menu must be known to all by now.so not getting into the details further.The interiors have been done nicely. Now coming to the main part.... Inspite of all the hype n hoopla and the extensive offering of the platter, the food came as a damp squib. Mutton was not soft, prawns were not marinated properly and resultantly salt content was not evenly distributed. Now coming to another aspect the service. Its the quintessential aspect of any good food chain and here also loads of work needs to be done. First it took an eternity for them to serve the starters, secondly it was taking loads of time to get the fill in s and thirdly our repeated asking to clear the plates was falling into deaf ears. All these aspects are a huge deterrent for an institution that aspire to be counted amongst the best fine dining establishments. Hope the authorities take proper care of all these aspects.best wishes.
