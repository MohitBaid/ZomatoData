I can swear by the Kolkata kathi rolls...wherever u r in Kolkata...a joint serving rolls is definitely nearby..and u r spoilt by choice...my favorite is always egg roll....soft parathas crispy on the outside...spongy layer of omelette inside peppered with green chilli shavings and lemon...wow!
Sree lagna is no different...satiates your hunger when it is needed most....

A small take away joint locaed opposite CIEM college, Sreelagna serves decent food. Their rolls and momos are my favourites. It is a good place for students to grab a quick bite between classes.

This is unbelievable. The small shack right beside my house is on zomato. Well to be honest, we survive on it. Food is extremely reasonable and going by the fact that we order so frequently and never fall sick i guess its safe too. Lol. Order away. They make great momos and finger food.

Located just beside the narmada school opposite to CIEM college, sreelagna is a small stall like shop with average tasting food. Nothing excited me much except the chicken steamed momo. Average food and the time taken to serve was much more than expected. Lack of cleanliness. I hope better I'll be given better service the next time.

Not a very good food outlet. Can never live up to my expectations. Quality of food isn't that good. And above all, the conduct of the the owner isn't upto the mark. Overall rating goes down when people don't get what they want!

This is the neighbourhood local shop, known for their momos and rolls...This is preferably a take away opposite ITI. My personal favourite is their chicken roll. The momos also are cheap though a bit oily. The owner  Dilip da is someone whom i have known for years. 
Only one complain, i miss their fish fries..

Pretty decent roadside food outlet. Its in my locality, so had a snacks often. Located opposite ITI Tollygunge and just besides Narmada School. Among the tried ones are the Chicken Momo, Egg chicken roll, egg chicken chowmein. One thing good about them is they listen and properly carry out to your specific demands like less oiled parathas, no chilly sauce.

Overall, nice snacks hangout.
