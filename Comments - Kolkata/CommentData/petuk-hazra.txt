Wonderful food.  Would recommend to everyone!! Especially the fish fry,  it is a real pleasure to the taste buds. With a crunchy outside the soft fish inside,  there is just no match!

This place is located opposite to Sujata Sadan on Hazra road. You need to either accommodate yourself on the benches put in front of it or opt for a take away. I have had here twice and tried different items.
The Chicken Tikka roll is great to taste. I loved the paratha and the chicken pieces were soft and large in size for a roll. The roll is thin so people with better appetite might feel disappointed. I also tried veg fried rice and Machurian Chicken. Both of them were decent in taste.
Their quality and hygiene has earned special mention. And the staff behavior is also polite.
I have never tried their home delivery so I won't be able to comment on that.

This is a small eatery near paramount nursing home in Hazra. I like their rolls because it's not that spicy and even tried their aloo tandoori which I liked. This place doesn't have a proper sitting arrangement but a nice place to grab some quick snacks.

First all it's a food joint for take-n-away as there is basically no sitting arrangements. The place is small, but neat & clean kitchen inside. 

I had their Chicken Kaathi Roll (costs Rs 70/-) and it's quite slim, less oily. A low calorie roll, it seems. However their basic chinese offerings are better, yet just standard.

The Rolls seems to be like finger chips.... I think the road side thelawalas prepare better Rolls...please change the name from Roll to Slim-Rolls... Petuk name is not justified at all... highly disappointed.
Second time ordered chilli chicken... it was more of chilli batter rather than chilli chicken.... horrible food!!!!

A friend of mine took me there yesterday, saying that its a good chinese place, and gives good value of money. So we went there, my friend knew the owner Biplab Da, he is very friendly man. We ordered two plates of Veg Chilli Garlic Noodles, 1 plate of Chilli Babycorn, 1 plate of Schezuan Chicken and two bottles of coke. All of them were very tasty! And all of it came down to only 500 bucks. Totally worth it!
We loved the food, plus the weather was so amazing yesterday evening and the amazing chinese simply added on to the evening ;)

Petuk is quite a famous eatery located at Hazra. It's basically a take away counter.

Ambience is ok with nice service.

Tried egg chicken tikka roll, which had good fillings, soft and less oily. A must try.
Also had parathaa and chilly chicken , quantity was good. Chilly chicken was delicious , paratha was soft.

Overall they serve tasty food at an affordable price . Don't bother the ambience .

I happened to visit this place on the Wednesday this week and I stunned by the quality of the food served by them.
We ordered chicken hakka noodles, chilli chicken and a chicken soup, There was unnecssary delay im serving the foodwe waited over 40 minutes for the food, when the place was empty and not crowded at all, however after severe delay we were served with food which was like, the quality of noodles was thick and they had a stinking smell, on being questioned about it we were informed that the noodles had been spiked with white pepper for taste, however white pepper adds taste to food and not stinking smell.
The soup lacked any taste,it was mere tasteless and the chilli chicken felled fried chicken dippen in tomato puree!!

Extremely dissatisfied with the food and quality!! Looking at the place I expected much better food!!!

Ultimately we dint eat our food beacuse it made no sense eating tasteless food.

One day when I was craving a lot for kebabs, dad got some of them for me from here on his way home from work. 
There were Achari Fish Tikka and Chicken Haryali Kebabs. Both of them were fantastic. The amounts were a little less compared to the pricing and quality. Otherwise, recommended for satisfying a pocket friendly kebab craving.

Have passed by this eatery without taking a single glance till my friend Saptarshi Dutta introduced it in my life. Apparently shabby by looks, Petuk reminds us of the advice that one should not go by looks while judging something or someone.

I have eaten food at least twice from here, courtesy Saptarshi Dutta, this being his favourite eatery. Every time I have marvelled at their taste. The kebabs are wonderful to taste. The biriyani is to die for. The Chinese dishes are also good. But I prefer kebab and biriyani from here. The price is also pocket friendly.
Would recommend it to anyone who prefers take home food packs.

At first glance on the rates, you have to agree it is very much in the affordable range and the value for money is great. The food quality was awesome and way better than some other eateries that serve Chinese food in the vicinity.. in short the food made me "Petuk" üòÅ

It's mainly a take away corner over hazra rd near Hazra. Although few seats are available in it, and hence no emphasis over decor or ambience.
While returning from university me and my friends used to hop in here, because it belongs to the tag of "huge portions in less money". 

So here schezwan mixed fried rice is a speciality, since I'm not a rice freak so I used to have Hakka noodles (schezwan mixed, garlic chicken etc) and all of them were quite scrumptious.

When you are hungry like heck and you r near Hazra and you wanna run smooth on your pocket, try out Petuk! Yes the name is just apt for this place. üòù 

RECOMMENDED!

I have been visiting this area for the last few days consecutively and this place fell to my notice, the first day itself. Petuk is a small little outlet, mainly just a take away, but you can constantly hear the rattle of spatulas clattering against woks and tawas. Since we had a bit of time in our hands today, me and a friend decided to check the place out. We straight away went for a double chicken roll since they were already making quite a few for an order. the parathas looked so good. We also ordered two aerated beverages.
The service was pretty fast though they were already in the mid of unloading and packing the first order.
Coming to the rolls. They are the perfect size. The parathas are lachedar but not unnecessarily doughy or thick. It is the slim version of the gigantic delicious ones we find with some of the leading brands. The filling inside had large pieces of chicken, marinated in a flavorsome masala mix. A bit more of that cooked masala marinade in the roll would have done wonders for it. Also the chicken was a bit over cooked that left it chewy and stringy. The best part about the roll was without a doubt the paratha.

It's a take-away and home delivery outlet.Seeing it's high rating in zomato I decided to order dinner from this place via swiggy.There have been much praises about their kebabs but there are no other options for maincourse dishes in Indian section.It disappointed me a bit and hence I decided to order Chinese.The dishes were Petuk special fried rice(full) and Chicken in hot garlic sauce(full).I must say that I didn't at all regret my decision for dropping renowned Chinese restaurants and choosing Petuk for my dinner. :)

Petuk special fried rice-Quantity was huge.It was spicy in taste.And the special thing about it was that apart from usual combinations in mixed fried rice(egg,chicken,shrimp) it also contained ample amounts of sweet corn and mushrooms.I liked it a lot.

Hot garlic chicken-It contained 8 big pieces of chicken tossed in a VERY hot garlic sauce.Since I love spicy food it tantalised my tastebud.Chicken was soft too and not at all coated with too much cornflour.Though the combination of spicy staple with yet another spicy side dish can be difficult for few people,it was amazingly suitable for my palate.

Pocket pinch was very nominal.My only suggestion for them would be to add options for maincourse under Indian cuisine section.

Went to this place with high expectations but met with little satisfaction. It is just opposite to sujata sadan,hazra which is a usual place for our weekly classes & tests.after a 10 hour long class we went to this shop to quench our appetite of some lipsmacking snacks.items were average not too good not too bad.but chicken pakora was disappointing.may be as we couldn't taste each of their delicacious so m not being judgemental about those untasted yummies.but overall it could hv been better experience. And yes it's a take away.if u wana sit n eat u've to do it on roadside tools

This holds truth for Petuk, a small eatery located in Hazra. Thank you for thinking about food. Very few are inclined towards giving our favorite food a new facelift, Petuk does exactly that. The freshness of the variety fish dishes available is commendable. Wish you success and hope you feed people the love and gastronomic¬†excitement forever.

Thought of tryng a new place n just half an hour ago ordered fish Irani kabab,petuk special friedrice, pan fried fish in mustard sauce nd chilli fish. I am quite dissapointed. D rice was way too spicy n fnd only  3 or 4 pieces of shrimps.,eggs n mushroom fillets.  Fish Irani kebabs were also a thumb down.it was supposed to b a mughlai dish but  only  some cheese were sprinkled  over d fish.no texture no flavours just sum chunks of steam fish. Chilli fish was ok nothing special nd nt worthy as per d price .cnt say anything bout fish in mustard sauce cause I tried d dish 4 first time so can't compare. I would really like d chef to improve d food taste. Otherwise I am never going to taste again. It became a total loss to my pocket pinch.

I have noticed this joint many times and the one thing that attracted me towards the shop was the tagline " When food is your religion". It is located opposite to Sujata Sadan, just near my college which gives me enough reason to visit this place. I have been here quite a few times but did not try much dishes. But recently, I went there for an assignment and I was lucky enough to try many of their dishes. Starting with, they have a great variety of rolls, which are pretty good and I have tried them earlier. Speaking of the kebabs, the hariyali chicken, fish irani kebab and the reshmi kebab are a must try there. The petuk sepcial fried rice is also delicious. It is paired very well with the Fish in chili mustard sauce. I also loved their chili garlic noodles and the pan fried chicken. Overall, a pretty good experience. Perfect place for college students, good food in a budget is what this little joint is..

I ordered here for dinner on 10th July, to celebrate my Dad's 70th birthday at our place, just amongst the four of us.¬†
We had ordered Chicken Tangy Lollypop for starters, ¬†
a half plate of eggless Chicken Hakka Noodles for my mom as she is allergic to eggs,¬†
one Petuk Special Noodles,
¬†and one Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice for main course¬†
with one Chicken in hot Garlic Sauce
¬†and one Chilli Fish....
Loved every bit of the food, although some may find it a little too spicy. For me it was absolutely sumptuous.¬†
I could have rated this quaint little eatery 4.5 only if the prawns in the Petuk Special Noodles had those black thick threads taken out of them.

Located just near the hazra to bondel auto stand. I had read the name in zomato many a times but could never figure out where the shop is when suddenly, one fine day i saw it right there near the stand. 
It's been two times that i have already eaten the food of this place. Or rather should i say i have taken food parcel from here because there's no proper seating arrangement here. 
But nevertheless... The food is really awsome out here. 
I have tried their chicken 65 which was something different and lovely n spicy. I have also tasted their egg noodles and the Petuk special noodles. Now their Petuk special noodles is really special. Prepared with golden corn, prawns, egg, mushrooms, bell peppers etc., it's a lovely dish and d spice makes it better. Their tangy lollypop is lovely too. 
Overall a nice food stop. Cheap rates. Affordable. And lastly...their addition of spice to the food just makes it the best.

Located on Hazra road, the place is a small outlet with young staff and menue displayed at the entrance. The menue is dominated by non-veg items. I was in the mood of veg though so asked for suggestion to staff member who was very helping. I ordered chilly babycorn and veg fried rice. The service was fast and price reasonable.I had to say, I enjoyed the spicy taste of babycorn and rice had exact amount of oil and flavours. The quantity was ample as well.

My review

Food:4/5. Spicy and tasty

Ambience:2/5 , better to take parcel. Only few benches kept for seating that too on footpath so not recommended.

Value for money:5/5 . only INR 110/- for full meal.

Service:3.5/5

Recommend: Yes for take away parcel service

Petuk located near Hazra crossing is a relatively new restaurant to have come up.It has mainly takeaway and home delivery facility.Having heard good things about this place and passed by it quite a few times I decided to order from here for dinner a couple of days back.

My order was a tangy lollypop,a petuk special chowmein and a garlic chicken.The order was delivered more or less in time and packed quite nicely.The tangy lollypop contained 8 chicken pieces and was really good.It was juicy and succulent and slightly spicy which went well with the tanginess.I loved it and gobbled most of them off.The petuk special chowmein was tasty and flavourful but it was a bit too spicy for my liking.The garlic chicken was decent but not as good as the other two preparations.The prices are pretty reasonable too.

Overall I was satisfied with my experience here and I look forward to ordering more from here soon.

I've been hearing nice things about this place from my neighbours in hazra and they seem to be quite fine of the food from here. 

Was told that the Chinese starters ate nice and so are the Indian mains. We decided to order some chinese starters to munch on with drinks. Our order consisted of barbecue chicken and chicken lollypop. 

The barbecue chicken was thin strips of chicken breast tossed with bell peppers in a sweet garlicky sauce. An absolute winner . It was gobbled in minutes . And the lollypop although fried was flavorful and really juicy . 

We loved both the dishes. And will try the mains soon

The fish tikkas looked like kebabs and I went really confused which is what. Mutton Kebabs were good and I expected them to be big chunks. The small sticks disappointed me. Fish Tikkas were yummy. It was really good. I will come again for the Fish Tikkas.

I've been hearing nice things about this place from my neighbours in hazra and they seem to be quite fine of the food from here. 

Was told that the Chinese starters ate nice and so are the Indian mains. We decided to order some chinese starters to munch on with drinks. Our order consisted of barbecue chicken and chicken lollypop. 

The barbecue chicken was thin strips of chicken breast tossed with bell peppers in a sweet garlicky sauce. An absolute winner . It was gobbled in minutes . And the lollypop although fried was flavorful and really juicy . 

We loved both the dishes. And will try the mains soon

I ordered Fish Tikka and Mutton Kebab and seriously I did not regret ordering them. I did one mistake of taking them home as it went cold. The fish tikkas looked like kebabs and I went really confused which is what. Mutton Kebabs were good and I expected them to be big chunks. The small sticks disappointed me. Fish Tikkas were yummy. It was really good. I will come again for the Fish Tikkas.

Nice place.. Saves me from random hunger pangs. I am specially fond of the tangri kebab. One of the best I have tasted. Mutton seekh kebab here is also great stuff. Thanks Biplob da.

When I ate  last time here say it was not so good but decent if compared with price. Recently it introduced many other varieties of food which I haven't tasted yet.
