A small cafe rite at the walk in entry of the Park kolkata.They serve descent pastries , sandwiches and alcohol.The draught beer is pretty good though.Not that overpriced in compared to a five star brand but it was okay.I like the place because the way it is built,its more like a long que that covera the whole bakery where you have glass windows and sitting arrangements just beside that,which feels pretty good.ITs a good place to sit with a friend and have a nice conversation with a glass of beer.

This cafe is just located in the entry of The Park and we always wanted to try this place.
Today we came here and the price was double their regular price due to Christmas.
Anyway,we took a Dry Tangra Chilli Prawn,Chicken Penne pasta in white sauce and a cookie brownie shake.
The Pasta had less quantity compared to the price but it tasted amazing.We highly recommend their penne in white sauce.It was cheesy with good portion of chicken chunks and they added mushroom to it on our request.We loved it.
Next,the chilli prawn was six pieces in number,medium spicy and tasted great.
Also,the cookie brownie shake is recommended.

Such an average place. Staff seems untrained and unprofessional. Couldn't even open beer bottles properly. Food was disappointing. We ordered chilli pork sausages, it was what I'd get at a frozen foods section at Spencers but half the quantity. They just cut sausages into several pieces and served it. I was so eager to visit this place, guess I'm not going again.

An outlet of The Park , which leads you to the lounge of the hotel is a well decorated and a cozy place to have a drink or two with your friends. Service is quick and price is  pocket friendly. They also serve various desserts. Loved it.

The seating arrangement is awful , facing the driveway just the canteens in govt offices. Menu is inconsistent and many items not available there should have been seperate menu or the customers are expected to do magic and understand which item available before placing an order..!

I went to this place today.Its a nice place just at the entrance of "The park" hotel. Ambiance is not that good but one can sit and relax. Over weekends this place gets crowded.Unfortunately drought beer was not there so went for Kingfisher.Ordered nachos but it was not there. So tried Tangra Dry Chili Baby corn and Mushroom as suggested by the waiter.It tasted good but lacked in quantity.Crews were courteous. Overall had a nice time here.Happy Drinking.

Another name which goes side by side with "The Park" is "The Street". Just like the name given to this place , this place is very beautifully as casual street cafe. Continental cuisine teamed up with cool music and precise angular view of the busy street before the cafe, simply provides relaxation on week day or weekend.

Nice location , not too good an ambience ; sort of a boring place as it seemed to me . Was with a couple of friends , the waiters seemed to forget what you asked them for , we had to ask four times for getting ice cubes .
Food was okayish type , not too good .
Well now coming to the drink , they charge you Rs245 for a fosters half pint which has an MRP of Rs70 only.Every pub or bar in kolkata does so but not this much hiked.
And moreover the weirdest part , they actually looked dismayed and rather horrified when they saw me pay cash ; at first they refused saying they do not have change . Afterwards accepted after being forced by me once or twice , weird place . Would definitely not go there again , and from me this place is not at all suggested .
Happy drinking

Visited this much-hyped place on a Saturday late afternoon  and found it to be quite good. The decor and ambience is nice, the staffs are courteous. The food quality and taste undoubtedly caress the taste buds. We ordered a Strawberry-basil shake, beer, Dry Tangra Chilli Chicken and Penne Pasta with chicken add ons. The quantity is a disappointment though. But it's worth a few visits.

I visited the street Cafe after ages on my last visit to Kolkata. I went in to eat my favourite mushroom waffles which I was a great fan of in my college days.
The menu has completely changed.

The surprising part was that the prices are still so reasonable. It's eating at Park hotel without a pocket pinch. The prices are totally STUDENT friendly and it's perfect for people looking for a place for having a meeting.

I was initially in two minds as what I wanted to eat was not available. We ordered:

Arrabiata pasta
Paneer Khurchan Kathi rolls
French fries
Street Cold coffee

The Kathi rolls were superb.
The pasta was good. I'm not a great fan of coffee but I could not stop my self from taking a couple of sips.

I love the vibe of the place and the lovely food will keep making me come back.

But drinks like the draught beer are pretty budget friendly if not cheap. Do try their chocolate waffle. Overall a great place to hangout with friends and crack open a few cold ones ;)

Its USP is that it is pocket friendly. Ambiance is cool, but pretty ordinary, not grand either considering it to be inside The Park! Food served is fresh and the quality is good too. Desserts are superb, the Hot Walnut Chocolate Brownie was really good in taste. Need to work on the promptness in the service and behavior of the staffs at the counter, sometimes they are little lethargic in paying attention to the customer's needs.

Being a Kolkatan, you obviously know THE PARK, the name is self sufficient and truly it is the most luxurious and conveniently located hotel in this city.

Everyone wants to experience its services, but one fine evening, when the pocket had been burnt to agreat extent and the rain Gods decided to show no mercy, I entered the Street, an extension of the Park on Park Street.

The decor and ambiance can be described best as classy, add to it prompt and efficient staff.

Food ordered, tangra dry chilli chicken, a wonderful dish, made like the authentic Tangra(China Town) delicacy.

Street Cold coffee-super taste, super presentation.

Walnut Brownie- though a bit dry but then not that bad to taste.

Pocket pinch was okayish specially at the end of the month.

Would love to go back!!

This place is in a very convenient location. And almost everyone is well versed with THE PARK. ☺

Ambience - Headed to this place one evening while it was ☔. The ambience and Decor sets your mood perfectly well. Such classy decor. Less seating arrangements but You would not have to wait probably. 😍

Food - Ordered Dry Tangra Chilli Chicken, Street Cold Coffee & Hot Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream.
*Dry Tangra Chilli Chicken - was prepared well. Lil spicy but good to the taste buds.
*Street Cold Coffee - was Outstanding ! Especially for a Coffee lover.
*Hot Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream - was good. The Brownie could have been a bit softer. Otherwise, it was good. 😍

Service - It was quick. Hospitality is commendable.

Overall, a nice place to sit and talk with your loved ones. No hustle bustle. ❤

As the name of the place says, literally this place is on the street when you walk towards Roxy or SPE or Tantra from Park street main road. It's a good place for people who wants to get high while watching a band show inside someplace else or dancing inside Roxy but in a budget cost. A pint beer inside someplace else costs 403 rupees and here at "The Street" you get a 1.5 litre draught beer pitcher for 662 rupees. You can pour one glass from it, sip it down and go inside while ur pitcher wd be kept safe in the fridge till that time u come again. I took one dry chilli chicken as well which cost 175+tax only which is very cheap compared to a 5 star property. Waiters needless to mention are awesome, crowd is good, definitely worth a booze!!

This place is located just at the entrance of The Park and is a part of the same. I've been here multiple times during happy hours when the drinks are really cheap...one of the cheapest in the area(surprising but true) ! But after that the prices usually double up! The draught beer is really smooth and good. Never really tried anything from the food menu...maybe next time!

The beer is not that good being of the kingfisher brand. U could choose up other drinks as well for suprisingly low rates considering that the place is a part of The Park. On the downside ..there is a dearth of space in terms of headcount it can accomodate - so go early if u want to sit at the round tables . Also the food is a little costly , but tasty. More often than not there is no background music to drown the human conversation - which for me acted as a good thing .

A classy place

Very much within range

This brings park hotel within the range of people.

Top class dining style is their usp.

The drinks are nice.

Although air conditioning is bit too high sometimes but that still adds to the experience.

A big issue is its the entrance of the park hotel. 

So people keep on coming and going beside you.

I like the décor of this place quite a lot and it has just the right ambience to make you feel very comfortable. When you are in the mood for a good beer at a chilled out place this hits the spot right. If you find it expensive, there is always a cheerful board outside declaring happy hour timings. :)

The entry to the Park hotel, and as the name suggests ,upon visiting you will find yourself on the street. The street leading inside. I love their draught beer. On one of my visits I had their tangra chilli chicken, which was delicious and complimented my Blenders on the rocks.

The happy hours are what makes the street and its gorgeous draught beer so appealing. The waitress is extremely amicable and te ambience is not all that bad with a backdrop of busy park Street and glass walls. The street is the place to be if your squad prefers quality brewed beer and Loves Park Street

I went to The Street yesterday. I had the idea that it had street food in its menu, but no it hadn't. Then why it is named thus? It is because they have set it up in the passageway, and you have to endure people passing down the way with luggage and eyeing your plate out of curiosity.

Anyway,I liked the new style of sitting arrangement. And the lighting. And the display.

So I asked for the menu. I chose waffles. Have always loved them. I chose one savoury waffles consisting of English coleslaw
tomatoes and shredded chicken and one golden sweet waffle and one cold coffee. 

The staff were formal and alert.

Cold coffee arrived earlier. It arrived in a tall glass. One sip and I felt relieved.

Savoury waffle arrived right after that. It tasted good. Enough crunch and enough stuffing. They were handing over the sweet waffle almost simultaneously but looking at the ice cream in it, I requested them to keep it with them till I ask them. After I finished off my savoury waffle with a contented sigh, I asked for the sweet waffle.
The maple syrup is kept in a separate portion of the plate, to be drizzled over the ice cream and the waffles. But no spoon was provided to do it. You cannot drizzle the same with fork or knife. So I requested for a small spoon, which was given immediately. This also tasted fabulous. But if you ask me to compare, I liked savoury waffle more.

Don't think I would venture here again, but it was a good experience.

At the Park, everything is "Designed," and maybe you are too! While the fare is pretty fair, each dish is carefully packaged in a thoughtful style! Style is the idea here at the Park and not really any special cuisine!
So get on a yellow shirt, with pink polka dots, and move your pink suede shoes down to the Park!

Desserts were just OK.  tandoori aloo and paneer tikka starter were rightly spiced and served with chutney were really yummy. The starters were Suggested by Shamik.

There's no ambience to speak of, it's literally like a Street.
Although the music was nice but it felt weird that there are people walking past you to enter The Park, it totally kills the mood.

We ordered
A basket of fries,
Pan fried chicken momos with Chutney,
Chicken Shwarma,
Chocolate Junkyard (Sweet Waffles),
Cookies and Cream Shake,
Banana Peanut Smoothie.

The waffles, momos, fries were really good.
Shakes and smoothies were nice too.
But the shwarma was a bit dry and wasn't good enough.

Overall a nice place for a quick bite.

The Street is among the better places in Kolkata for a quick drink. The joint boasts amazing ambience, but the service is average. One of the better features of this interesting place is that it's very long, while maintaining little width. This may not sound worth mentioning, but it does work very subtly on the senses.

They play very nice music, and they make sure to not overdo it. Loud music can be a terrible addition to any joint trying to come off as classy. But that's what The Street does so well - it's classy in a very simplistic way.

The food is good, and their draught beer is worth the money spent. They do charge a pretty heavy tax on their foodstuff, but that's to be expected. The beer and the wine are most recommended, and for good reason. Do try their pastries out.

Food: 3.5/5
Ambience/Interiors: 4.5/5
Service: 2.5/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Well let's say that you have visited The Street if you have been to The Park. It is actually the the ally way with chairs and tables on the side which leads to The Park. Coming back from an event in town we stopped here for a quick bite. Tried a variety of food but a few were satisfactory while the others were really good. The only turn off was the people walking up and down constantly as it being the entrance of the hotel, with a place so cool you kind of want some privacy which this place didn't offer at all.
Highly recommended if you don't get distracted easily and want to have some amazing coffee or milkshakes.

Decor / Ambience: The place looks classy. The sitting area looks like a narrow alley which leads to the hotel interior.
Service: Sometimes the waiters behave indifferently. My friend asked for the menu card and the waiter behind the counter pushed the menu towards her while checking his phone.
Food: The menu offers very limited choice. Though there are certain other items displayed in the counters that are not listed in the menu. 
The Fish Finger was not available though according to the menu this item is one of their bestsellers. So we expected this item to be available. 
If you order tea, you will get a cup of boiled water/ milk & a typhoo sachet! We didn't get the sugar sachets either & had to request for some.  Disappointing.
The walnut brownie shake tasted average. 

Price: Reasonable considering the hotel is a 5* property.

The first thing you probably notice about the hotel is the narrow lane leading to Roxy. But that is the eatery!
Love the name, decoration is good. Seats are lined up against the glass barricade. Once can see the cars entering the hotel towards the parking. The best thing about this place is probably the menu, they serve everything!!! Definitely recommended!!

Cool, fun and effortlessly classy coz it is THE Park. The interiors reminded me of the interiors for any Starbucks. The pitcher came at a cool 650 bucks including taxes while food is on the steeper side,it is advisable to enjoy the mocktails and the devilishly delicious shakes this place has on offer.

If you want to have a drink in Park Street with some cafe food to munch on, walk on to The Street. Also, if you are out to party at Roxy or Tantra or Someplace Else, but suddenly feel the urge to gorge on a sandwich, just come and get one from this place. The food is honestly ordinary, but the beer is pretty cheap. For me, this a nice place to chill and catch up with friends after office.

Known for it's cheap beer, The Street is one place that has to be in your food bucket list If you're a Kolkata foodie. 

Located at The Park, this place provides you with an amazing range of liquor to select from. Food here is pretty good too. I personally am a big fan of their sausage section. 

Ten on ten on cleanliness. Service is quick. Ambience is cosy. Well lit. Plus, it comes with The Park lobby. What else do you need?

The best thing about the place is the ambience and then you get decent offers during day time on drinks. But the service is poor and the waitress will come and tell you that don't take pictures as it's forbidden by the management.... Then the tea they serve is merely typhoo sachets and don't have any actual tea leaves..
The sandwiches etc are decent but the pastries are nothing that great. The menu card etc seem worn out and tacky

Had a fair experience. the service was good, I had a two little deals,though being on Friday the service team redeemed it,the gentleman and the lady at the counter was good,great exactly. 
Now coming to the food,you are cheating boss, the chicken you can clearly see, a single portion is cut into two pieces,each pieces not even weighing 15gms, the mint chutney went sour,because of excessively use of spinach paste to color it, on flavour of mint. Disappointed. the fish and chips was excessively salty and had no fries into it,when asked they said That it was their standard. The fries basket was overpriced at 320, and the fish basket was around 220. Completely clueless. Please look into the matter.

Pretty a cozy corner for a quiet conversation on beer with a five starred chic decor and chilling ambience. For the couple of times that i visited, i had their nonveg sandwich, shwarma, kathi rolls and beer battered fish fingers with tartar sauce usually with draught beer or bud magnum. The fish was excellent, and the shwarma was below par. Have not tried the bakery section yet.
The only con i feel is since its located at the entrance, the continuous passage of the guests in and out of the park sometimes hamper the privacy.

Looking for a pub with some cozy corner and some soft, mellow touch in its ambience?
 Step in to your desired destination at "The Street", located at the ground floor of "The Park" at Park Street.
The place is not so crowded, and visited by selected group of people from different walks of life. So if you want to avoid the crowd of random/mass people
this place is the perfect fit for you to enjoy your drink(and meal if you want to).
And yes, they provide happy hours facility also.
The only annoying thing is the lack of manpower in service team, resulting in a bit slow service.
Overall, a nice, descent place.

The Street is a place very close to my heart. During the days when Zomato was not there with us, I would often visit The Street during winters.
Sit there during the winter afternoons staring at the busy and festive Park Street, sipping in to the special Draught Beer and biting over Dadger Dog. The experience is even more pleasant if you happen to be a reader and carry a book with you.
The Street is a nostalgia to many. Thank You Park Hotel.

Excellent location, bang on the entrance of Park Hotel. Ambience is great, their music choice is really exceptional. They are always kinda short staffed, which is not upto par.

In short, visit here for the draught beer and Dadger Dog.

That's pretty much the standard fare I have every time I visit this place. 
The hot dog is really excellent, with juicy bacon slices and a thick sausage.
Draught beer is kingfisher, so you know what taste and quality to expect, nonetheless for Rs 60 you cant complain.

I keep on visiting this place regularly and will recommend it to others.

Location: At the ground floor of hotel 'The Park'

Ambiance: Dimly lit, warm and cozy.  Awesome music playing background. Only disturbance here is the visitors of Park hotel passing by your table. Perhaps, this is why, this cafe is called 'The STREET' which leads you to hotel 'The Park'. ;) 3.5/5

Service: Prompt. The staffs were courteous. No issues whatsoever, nothing to mention about either. 3.5/5

Food: We ordered for grilled double egg sandwich and dark chocolate pastry.
The sandwich was not properly grilled. The egg filling tasted blunt and the breads were loosely coupled together. 
The dark chocolate pastry was sinfully tasty. It was heavy. Enjoyed the pastry thoroughly. 3/5 (points deducted for sandwich)

First of all I had a huge expectation as i was going "THE PARK". Went there to have evening snacks. I ordered for Sandwich, but unfortunately they dont have Brown Bread or Multi Grain Sandwich. So my first disappointment arrives here. Then I ordered for a NON VEG Salad. I ordered 2. 
After 15-20 mins the order came. 
Firstly he (the man who took the order and serving us) served 1 Salad. When I said I ordered for 2, he apologised that he didnt hear.
Secondly, the salad was a VEG SALAD. WTF. And the most irritating part that there is no waiter or some one available to call in need. The man, was inside the kitchen leaving the guests all by their own. We need to get up again and again from our table to call him for Coffee, Water, and bill. What the hell on the earth god knows he was so busy at doing with his fellow staffs in the kitchen that he bothers a little for his guests. 
When I saw it was a Veg Salad, I decided not to call him again, because by that time I was pushed to frustration by calling him again and again. 
Coming to the taste. It was sooooooooo awful. The salad was tossed in raw vinegar and olives on the topping. The vinegar was so excess that we could see the remaining lettuces dumped in it. It was soo yukky. There was full of Vinegar and nothing. We had a diarrhea after having it. 
The basic coffee was so dissatisfying. It was simply machine made. Full of Milk. I found no trace of coffee in it. 
My experience with The Street is really painfull. First time ever in my life I felt I totally wasted my money in a meal. So bad.

On a hot summer day, I visited this place with my brother en route to the Kolkata for Nepal concert. From outside, this looks like a small place (a small cake shop to be honest), but inside it extends up to the lobby of the park hotel with a bar in the middle.

There's always some offer on drinks going on at this joint, specially in afternoon. When we visited, they served a mug of kingfisher draught beer for just 50 bucks! We had couple of those and also order lamb kababs.
The lamb was tender with the balance of all the flavours. But, nothing much special about it. No doubt, the place is costly if visit it at a time other than the happy hours.

But, overall the ambience and service is really nice with really exciting offers. So from next time, whenever you pass by this joint, have look at the board in front of this place showing that day's offer, otherwise you might be missing out a good deal.

The Park Hotel in the early nineties was a rundown,old school hotel with old school decor and old school people.Then the two Paul sisters Preeti and Priya took over and transformed the Park with an explosion of cuttin edge interiors,modern design aesthetics and some exciting spaces like Tantra,Zen,Chai bar,Someplace else etc.
It is this dynamism which converted a narrow pedestrian entrance from Park Street to the hotel into this exciting place called the street.You can sit on steel chairs,listen to Steve win wood and see the cars driving past in the driveway along with every face strolling in and out of the Park.
And yes,you can also dig into the very best hot dog that this town has to offer along with fresh juice like I had.The hotdog had the right quantity of mustard and the sausage was perfect.The juice a mix of tomato and carrot   was the best I have had in a long time.this really is a street with a difference.

Visited The street on a Friday, post hectic office hours. It turned out to be a very pleasant experience, one that will tantamount to many others visits in the future. The ambiance is quite infectiously casual and allows you to let your hair down. We ordered light as we were not in the mood for too much food. 
So we settled on Apple, Melon and Ginger juice and Virgin Mary as well as Cheese and Ham Panckakes. All of the ordered items tasted quite nice and since we were not looking forward to weighing down on our tummy, it did suit our purpose just fine. 
The set-up and the music is definitely going to attract me to the place soon again. It is breezy and fun, just the right combo for a casual weekday evening hangout with a friend.

It’s been a long time when I and my wife went to an Electronic music festival so we decided to listen to some house music. As we entered this place, a DJ set was going on and we quickly caught the beat and started dancing. After some wild dance, we ordered some food which was nachos, tortillas and chicken wrap. All of it was as good as the music playing there.

There are resturants serve you "authentic" continental food then there is one - The Street. Ever gone through those food journals , where in they do a study on particular eateries every month. Now imagine such an article on an Italian Bistro. The first things that comes to mind are freshly baked breads, an extensve wine collection and good food. You enter The Street , and it gives you a slice of Europe right here in Kolkata. The bistro setup seating, the over hanging banners, pastries wine all adds up to it. Then there are some lip smacking food. Try the burgers, agreed not very European but I hardly think you will complain about that. Then there is the crepes in chocolate sauce. Even though am not a desert person , these chocolate crepes can convert even the likes of me.

The ambience in the Street is really good. It is situated right next to a club and at times, if you listen hard enough, you can actually hear the music. Coming to the food - really nice though the quantity coud be worked upon a bit.
The Street has an okayish collection of music but the draught beer here is to die for. It is really good but they serve the beer in plastic glasses so that is a let down, but I've recently heard that they've now started using beer glasses, so that is good.
Overall rating mainly goes for the ambience and the beer. The quantity of food here is not that much, so be prepared to shell out quite a premium if you come here with an empty stomach and want to leave with a full stomach.

Many a great nights have been spent by me and my family here, at The Street. We were frequent visitors there and still visit from time to time. It's the first thing you see upon entering the Park. It's a cool and nice cafe sort of a place which has a whole lot of variety in its menu. The fact that it has an entire glass wall makes  it a beautiful place to sit and watch the maddening crowd when you feel a little too prejudiced to enter the discs. With nearly 10 tables, this is a place where you can adda with your crowd in style whey you don't feel like dancing or drinking much. The draught beer is an added magnet. Available beverages are breezers, beers, wines and a small range of champagnes. For the non alcoholic, there's always those energy drinks (though I never prefer them, still, to each his own!)
There a rack full of games you can play and a cart of flowers on display which adds a little zest to the place, proving that you can do other things at Park other than booze and dance.
Anyways, coming to the food.
It's quite reasonable for a cafe in a five star, I bet others aren't so low-priced. 
Recommend items: the Kathi rolls (specially mutton and chicken), waffles,  baby corn, club sandwich... Even the coffee is pretty good!
The chocolate truffle pastry is a must try.
Also... The Belgian chocolate ice cream (although it isn't always available), is something straight out of heaven's golden gates. A must have if you love non-OTT but sinful dark chocolate!!
Overall, a nice place for a light eat with beer and thus, warmly Recommended!!

Gotta be here for the yummiest chicken roll - amongst the best in town!

Try the chicken burger too with draughts or coffee, depending on your mood.

Small cafe - calm, casual, youth and well mannered staff!

Nice place, and good food. The ambiance is is cool but being the main passage way to the Park Hotel...there's hardly any privacy....you are sandwiched between cars behind the glass wall on one side entering the park and people on the other walking up to the main lobby...I do wish the authorities re-structure The Street so that the counters and passage face the drive in and customers get to sit away from the din and clatter !

The food was good...and the Draught beer was very good value for money. We loved the service of Himadri who served us with a smile and he is a big reason for giving 3.5 points. 

Its the fact that one is having food at The Park a 5 star hotel at 3 star prices which give it a value for money run, but I do feel much needs to be improved.

I find the food a bit pricey for a cafe and with too many taxes added to it... that even without any privacy whatsoever. The taste is good...and fresh... We loved the club sandwich and Burgers as well as the Crepes.. but the taste of the Shawarma was not authentic...a bit sweet and sour..

What I like is that I get valet parking at park Street and that its open till midnight a big reason for me to drop in at odd hours...why not make it 24 hours?

Whats lacking is a TV...which is a MUST...esp when you want to have a drink and watch cricket or news ! There was no telecast of the world cup or IPL !!
And serving beer in plastic glasses was a put off ....though they have stopped doing that for the last few times we visited.

Many a great nights have been spent by me and my family here, at The Street. We were frequent visitors there and still visit from time to time. It's the first thing you see upon entering the Park. It's a cool and nice cafe sort of a place which has a whole lot of variety in its menu. The fact that it has an entire glass wall makes  it a beautiful place to sit and watch the maddening crowd when you feel a little too prejudiced to enter the discs. With nearly 10 tables, this is a place where you can adda with your crowd in style whey you don't feel like dancing or drinking much. The draught beer is an added magnet. Available beverages are breezers, beers, wines and a small range of champagnes. For the non alcoholic, there's always those energy drinks (though I never prefer them, still, to each his own!)
There a rack full of games you can play and a cart of flowers on display which adds a little zest to the place, proving that you can do other things at Park other than booze and dance.
Anyways, coming to the food.
It's quite reasonable for a cafe in a five star, I bet others aren't so low-priced. 
Recommend items: the Kathi rolls (specially mutton and chicken), waffles,  baby corn, club sandwich... Even the coffee is pretty good!
The chocolate truffle pastry is a must try.
Also... The Belgian chocolate ice cream (although it isn't always available), is something straight out of heaven's golden gates. A must have if you love non-OTT but sinful dark chocolate!!
Overall, a nice place for a light eat with beer and thus, warmly Recommended!!

The Street is the first thing you'd see entering The Park. Located at the entrance, The Street holds the main pathway to Park's entry. The ambiance is quite soothing and the menu is rush with a variety of options. Best suited for a quick bite or a beer in style. It's pricy and it's perfectly justifiable as the items they serve is up to the mark.

The lovely rainy weather led Us to The Street in The Park to sip Hot Mocha with some Chilli Babycorn and potato wedges. As being Vegan it's very Hard to find Varities in Menu but my sister wanted to munch on babycorn and Bil on Wedges and I preferred to stick with My favourable Coffee and Cookies so it was fine. Ambience as usual perfect and lovable the coffee was superb. We asked them to make Chilly Baby Corn less spicy but when the order was served I sticked to water after having a bite and thanks to the staff who changed and brought less spicy after few mins. Friendly service and serving manner is fantastic. While Coming back we thought to pick some pastry from the Bakery which is still lying in the fridge hope it taste good.

Had recently visited kolkata when I happened to pop in here for a quick bite with a friend. I had ordered the crumb fried chicken burger with fries and ended the snack with a cappuccino. The burger was juicy. Cappuccino was the usual. What struck me as odd was the fact that the waiter was impossible to get a hold of. He seemed to have simply vanished! I had to go out at the back to catch hold of someone to make my payment and get out of there. Pretty average fare. Average decor. Weird service and extremely limited menu even for a cafe.

Went for some quick bites in the evening
Intro : The name itself talks about the theme of this joint ...its a simulation of a street side fast food corner!

Food : Had grilled chicken sandwich,hot kati roll and couple of glasses of draught beer .
The sandwich was grilled to perfection...and tasted awesome with adequate chicken chunks. 4/5
The hot kati roll was alright , the chicken mix I felt was a bit too spicy but the good thing was that it was not oily at all -3/5

Service : very good - the guy was really courteous and was very proactive too !

Overall 3.5/5

This place is the ultimate example of trash running its business thanks to its 5 star tag.
The menu here is surprisingly lacking in variety and the food is expensive enough to burn a huge whole in your pocket. Add to that, most of the items written on the card are unavailable.
On top of this, the staff are extremely unwelcoming, bordering on hostile even.
This is one place I'll surely never visit ever in my life.

Its a part of the park hotel and its located just beside the entrace of park. Though it seems quite narrow from the entrance but it has got sufficiently spacious interiors. The decor is quite extravagant and plush as expected being a joint of The Park. Inhave dropped by to this place a couple of times to catch up a few bottles of beer. As the name "The street" suggests it specializes in offering varieties of famous street food from varioua part of the world like- hot dogs, crepes, burgers, sandwiches, kathi rolls, wraps etc. It is a place where you can savor a couple of drinks pairing with your favorite street food in a luxurious and exotic environment. This place also offers discounts on beers and other dishes on weekdays till 6pm termed as "happy hours". So inorder to indulge into street food and sip beer in style  this is quite a good place to try.

This place is just located at the entrance of Park Hotel. Few tables and resembles a roadside cafe.
There is not much to mention about ambiance since it is a very small place.
Cost is little bit on higher side since it s a premier hotel.
Service is fast and staff is courteous.
We ordered for Mushroom and Spinach Crepe. This was beautiful and tasted nice. Very creamy inside and I must say lot of mushrooms. 
Then we went for Chicken Shawarma. They give 2 for 250 bucks. Price was not the issue, the dish was. I must say I was disappointed with the taste since I was expecting the kind we normally get in local shops in Hyd/B'lore or even Lebanese outlets at Kolkata. Somehow did not find it tasty or that good either.

Cost 3.5/5

I have been to many cafes all over the world and this one reminded me a few of them. Though a little bit congested, we sat down to have a glass of beer as it was happy hours. So what do we get? Kingfisher Beer served to us in a 250ml plastic glass...costing rs.125/- each. A 650ml bottle of Budweiser costs as much. Have never been ripped off like this before.

THE STREET, you are sure to fall in love with the ambience when you visit this place. It’s on the outer part of the Park and is good place to catch on with some friends over a cup or coffee or a glass of fresh beer. The once I went there I tried on the sandwich and milk shakes and both of them seemed pretty decent. They usually have happy hours for beer in the late afternoon so it might seem like a good deal to visit this place then.

The Street at The Park is a nice place to catch up with friends at odd hours. The are also one of the few cafes which serve you a glass/botttle of wine and beer as well. The serve a nice hot dog with the "mush puppy" and the "cheesy" being the two that I favour. I also tried their ham and cheese pancake and liked it. for those with a sweet tooth try their "butter,sugar lemon crepe" or the "golden waffle". The pastries they serve are from the same kitchen as Flury's ( they are both owned by the Apeejay Group).

Quick service, fresh food and good overall quality. If you're looking for a food quickie this is the place for it!

The street located at The Park is a nice place to hang out with friends. 
The decoration of the cafe is top notch but the worst thing is that it shares a same entrance of the hotel and all the restaurant in The Park. 
Sometimes its irritating people are passing through the cafe.. If anybodies planning a quiet evening in The Street..Its probably impossible without getting disturbed.
Staffs are good... Service is quick. 
Food is average tried their sandwiches and waffles.. Price is on the higher side.

My first (and hopefully the last) experience at The Street was disappointing to say the least. This place looks so attractive from the outside that it had been on my wish-list since forever. But as you spend some time inside, you see the place for what it really is- a passageway to a five-star hotel. As I walked into this place, I could see no one inside except the security at the gate. There wasn't anyone behind the counter also. Overlooking the dark driveway, the feel of this place can only be described as depressing. We ordered Shawarma, Crepes and Chocolate Pastries along with draught brewed beer. The food was dry and dint seemed freshly cooked. We paid 2100 rupees for a meal that we couldn't get ourselves to finish. Still hungry we went looking for some other eatery after leaving this place.

Craving street food and great ambience at the same time!!! The Street is a restaurant at The Park with chequered floor, edgy silver furniture, mirrors and marble tiles on the walls combined with dim lighting. It serves street food from around the globe with a gourmet “5-star” twist. The restaurant recreates a walk-through street that houses a café, deli, dessert bar and a well-stocked cellar. Well, today we tried their “gourmet” street food with drinks at The Street in the luxurious ambiance. We took our time to decide the menu and finally ordered ‘Savoury Crepes’ (made with lebanese chicken), ‘Dodger Dog’ (made with pork sausage, grilled onion & jalapenos), Mango Banana Milkshake , Chocolate Walnut Brownie Milkshake, Chicken Sandwich, Chocolate Junkyard, Chocolate Pastries and Beers. Dodger Dog & Savoury Crepes taste average but nice combination with draught beer. The taste of Chocolate Junkyard & Chocolate Pastries were quite nice but not heart touching. The sizes of the chocolate pastries were incredibly small in respect to the prices!! One thing I liked that their chocolate desserts have a lot of chocolate flavour, but they are not too heavy. All in all a very average food experience in “5-star” ambiance.

This was my second visit to Street cafe. I had come here many years ago with my father, which i can remember vaguely. After having lunch at mocambo, sister suddenly had a craving for something sweet.. So we dropped in and ordered a chocolate tiramisu,chocolate truffle ..,choco pesta.. The chocolate truffle pastry was pure blis!!! I loved the tiramisu as well. The pastry was very light yet i had a very dense coffee flavour... Undoubtedly Street is the place to go for breakfast or baked goodies and confectionaries!!!!

Street cafe is place for snacks , sandwiches, burgers , pizzas etc . As they say " No one makes better Sandwiches than us" in fact they do take a lot of care in preparing a properly cooked sandwich / burger , pizza for you . You will find all standard/branded ingredients used in the preparation of the sandwiches like cheese, mayonnaise, butter etc . Would say total neat preparation of lip-smacking snacks in front of you. They have been maintaining this since they have started .

A thousand mind flickering thoughts keep boggling whenever I passed this alley of Park into the Oxford Book Store, and today,  I made it to this place after a lot of dissapointments. Its called The Street. One can locate this very easily because you enter the 5-star hotel through this lane.

Its posh, as the name boasts of (The Park Association that it has)
Clean and hygienic, has a good feel to it and also has good music in the backdrop.
Ambience is pleasant, I mean you'd feel bigger than you really are and the staff is efficient though they do not smile much anyway!
The one negative about their ambience is the security standing by the door, the sight isnt very plesant to be honest.
They make you feel like jailors eating together in a common mess! -_-
Coming to the food, I might beg to differ from my fellow foodies because my experience has been rather good, others might not have liked it though.
So , we ordered : :

1. Chocolate waffle (Its called "chocolate junkyard")
2. Mushroom waffle
3. Cappuccino
4.Mango & banana smoothie

The chocolate waffle and the mushroom waffle were the best waffles I ever had ! The crust was soft and smooth and the mushroom topping was really good. Coming to the quantity, NEVER order two waffles if you are in a pair.
They are massive and you might end up not being able to finish all of it.
I have had waffles at other places too, but this waffle was really nice. Very soft and could be easily cut out with a knife. 
And the chocolate waffle bowled me for a duck!
It was all chocolaty, and yummy with chocolate chips and ice-cream dollop.
The chocolate sauce was literally dripping off the waffle and my head went for a toss.
You will be surprised at how easily one can cut down the waffle with a fork and a knife while in other places, I've literally had to fight with it and topple the plate here and there onto the table!

A complete calorie-gainer :D

After eating from both plates, I was totally fully and had to give away a weeny bit because I cudnt finish it.
The smoothie was nice and smooth as it should be.  Could easily detect the banana and mango flavours separately and that ended my meal.

The Street has less staff and it might be a problem if they forget your order but for today, the staffs were attentive and gave us our prescribed food in no time. So, did not have to worry about reminding them about our orders every now and then.

Lets get to the economic catastrophe now :D

Pocket pinch for two : : 750-800 (without alcohol)
A wee lil steep I know, but its worth the risk! (Stick to waffles maybe?) :P

The Street can give you a happy meal when you're in a mood to just sit back, relax and chill with your peeps after a hard week at work! :)

Happy eating guys, 
Cheers! :)

Well Yesterday was my first experience to this place..So i would be putting it in detail what I understood about it. 
Situated like a narrow lane you should not be missing this place if you are coming to the Park.. I normally look straight and continue every time i enter this place...except for yesterday while i was waiting for a friend and thought of dropping by..
First Look : Quite Good.. the whole place is quite neatly done.. with seating arrangements made in different ways..they have also taken special care for family folks too.. i mean if you have a kid then maybe you can drop by and enjoy while the little one can play some games..
I ordered for a Draught beer with sandwich and a roll.. Draught beer was ofcourse the usual and I honestly would not be commenting on that..Sandwich and the roll was bit more spicy.. The place is very much understaffed.. and honestly the one or 2 of them hardly care if you sit idle for more than 30 minutes waiting for an order.. And that is the only reason i had deducted 1 point.. They even claim to have a Live ice cream counter which is apparently 94% Fat Free but none to serve..And this was at 7.30 PM i am talking about..on a saturday night..

Some suggestions to first timers.. this is a place only for friends..coz you would never get the privacy in case you are on a date.. considering the fact that people just walk past you every second..secondly order in one go(Thats what we did later when we caught hold of one waiter)..you would care a damn once you have what you wanted.and lastly the best time to come here would be after 6 pm but definitely before 9 PM (was here for 3 hours and was waited by some one just once)..

Prices for the drinks are average but yes the food is a little high...

Hope you enjoy your time.. :)

The draught beer here is fresh and the overall ambience is quite good. It is kind of amusing to sit and eat there with all the people walking by and getting screened by the security. It is a nice place to have some beer and food before you go to Someplace Else or Roxy. I had ordered paneer khurchan but found it to be spicy. Probably it was kept in the oven for too long as it was very hot and I almost burned by tongue. Had ordered a Chocolate Blanc  which was very good. Try the basket of fries with beer, a great combination and the fries were quite good. We had also ordered fiery chicken. The menu does not mention whether the fiery chicken is with bone or boneless and we were slightly disappointed to see the with bone fiery chicken. For quick bites, try the pancakes and sandwiches.

The street is located inside the park hotel. I was walking down park street and suddenly saw a board for happy hour offers for draught beer here. After looking at the board I went inside with a Friend of mine.

I took 2 draught beer , veg sandwich and kathi roll which tasted nice. 

Coming to the pros and cons:-
Pros:-
1) ambience is superb
2) very much clean and hygienic
3) staffs are polite
4) service is moderate
5) properly maintained

Cons:-
1) expensive 

Rest all is well :-)

This is by far the most economic eatery of The Park and even though the prices are quite steep at times you require the need to indulge a bit to feel happy. The decor is quite posh as is expected from a  5 star hotel. The food is great. I have often dropped in for some filter coffee which had a strong taste to my satisfaction. Their choice of juices are wonderful for those days when you feel that you would like to go healthy. The carrot , apple and ginger has a kick which is delicious. The mango apple orange is a bit too sweet for my taste and it is always freshly pressed and they refrain from adding sugar if requested to do so. This place is a delight for those who love breakfast . I am happy to see that this is one eatery which has both pancakes , waffles and crepes and you get to choose between sweet and savoury.  They have a range of delicious desserts which include ice-creams etc. Only on one occasion was I a bit disappointed to find that they had the exact same menu of the famous tea room further down the road across the street and the only difference was that you paid up quite an excess for enjoying the pleasures of sitting in the cafe but on most occasions they have charmed me with some beautiful dessert which isn't available elsewhere. their made to order salads are also quite tasty and satisfactory since you personally get to see the fresh ingredients.

Some titbits at The Street @ The Park!
4 out of 5

Eating yummy sandwiches and hotdogs with a pint of wine in a plush hotel is a delightful experience in its own right. You feel relaxed and invigorated as the light music playing in the background transports you to a different world, and this is the reason why I would head to The Street at The Park if I wanted to relax after a hectic day. The dimly lit interiors (the only source of light being classy LEDs), the plush decor and the chequered flooring are a unique combination.  The place boasts of many street food counters, each offering something special.

I must say that places like The Street have modernized the concept of making and serving street food. The place is spotlessly clean and food is served in the most hygienic way. Here, you can savour a wide assortment of vintage wines and beer with a selection of some of the best wines in the country. Whenever I'm at The Street I prefer flaming fajita wrap (a yummy delicacy of fiery chicken and pepper wrapped in a tortilla), dodger dog (special hot dog with bacon, salsa, grilled onion, jalapenos) or mush puppy (served with cheddar melt, grilled mushrooms and pepper) with a glass of terzas altocab sauvignon blanc (Argentinean wine) or nivole moscato d'asti mischele chiarlo. It's a heavenly experience! 

One can settle for melon apple and ginger juice or a cappuccino along with mushroom and spinach crepes, stewed seasonal fruit pancakes or golden waffles if they're looking for a snack. This luxurious eatery has excellent seating arrangements so you will not be left standing in a corner with your munchies and wine. Drop in here once for some of the best international street food in the city!

It was late Saturday afternoon and my better half was hungry so we decided to try a place that was close by and not too crowded and of course something we hadn't tried before.
This place is actually the entrance for pedestrians to the Park hotel so you do have people walking by your table quite frequently. Frankly, this did not seem disturbing at all. I did check with the Maitre d about what cuisine they actually serve before going in and he confirmed that it was a multi-cuisine restaurant. The menu wasn't disappointing nor was it as elaborate as I was made to believe. I ended up going for a American Street Style Hot Dog while my wife went for a Veg Burger with two lattes to accompany that. They also serve wine and beer. For a place of this cost, I expected the presentation of the food to be a little better. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not good enough. The food too was not too great. The hot dog seemed undercooked and not as garnished as I would imagine an American Street style hot dog to be. The lattes were fine though.
I believe I could have had a similar meal for the same cost elsewhere. The fact that this place is connected to the hotel, makes the prices shoot up. The ambience doesn't justify the cost. Wouldn't go back in a hurry

this place is not for so much for gluttony than to withdraw peacefully in a quiet evening in the part of the city where evrything's happening around you.lazily sip on the desserts or snacks,or if you have a rich taste and have the riches for it,go for the wide range of selection of alcohol they have to offer.lookout for the knockouts walking in every moment when your partner is not paying attention.its posh,its sophisticated and its quiet.

I'd give this place negative marks if it existed. I first went here in 2009. That's we payed 150 bucks for a glass of juice which had a fly in it and the coffee back then was quite decent.  My second experience here was last year. I had the chicken wings and the crepes. The chicken wings were yummy, based on a red sauce and the quadro cheese crepes I had was okay. My final and hopefully last experience was today. I had the same chicken wings (Rs.250) and the funny part is that not only was it different compared to the ones I had the last time ( this time it was more of a thai based chicken wings), it barely had any chicken in it. They should call it batter wings. The coffee was horrid, I had a latte and I think they didn't put any sort of milk in it, it was simply water and coffee. I also had the hot dog with bacon (RS. 250)and it was so extremely bad. The hot dog had half a strip of bacon with tons of mustard and the sausage on top. The place is absolutely not worth the money at all. I would highly discourage anyone to go here, its a complete waste of time and money.

i had a decent experience here last time i went. not that i can call it unforgettable.
 there is a lack of service or attention. one pretty much feels left out sometimes even when the place is empty . 

the banana and peanut butter pancakes are awesome. so are the iced teas and the chicken wings. love the interiors and the decor. 

hope to try some other things next time

The Street.. The restaurant which also serves as the corridor to or the entrance to the five star property in Park Street ie The Park. Had a really bad experiance here. When you go and sit down there's no one to attend you.. then after five minutes when you ask the security he calls the stewards. Though they apolagised, but this is not how it should be. Coming to the food the crepes here were horrible and so were the coffees. I could not believe I was having such food at a 5 star hotel. The only thing is it is cheap (for a 5 star restaurant or a cafe) but that does not make things any better.

1. Service - no attention will be paid to you, as the attendants are prepping your meal. In fact they are hardly seen and are called by the security staff to attend to the guests.

2. The menu is very limited. Food - is cooked well and very clean, but it comes down to whether the item matches your taste. There is a leaning towards the pungent mughlai street style of food in the menu, although few other continental dishes are fresh tasting. 

3. I love the french fries.

4. My issue with some of the items were that they were too freshly cooked - as in, they got soggy from the steam. I don't know how that can happen. The ingredients and breads are fresh though.

During our unfortunate visit to The Street today, we were served the worst possible coffees. Mr. Chiranjit served us a failed Cappuccino and an unconcious Latte Macchiato Frio.
