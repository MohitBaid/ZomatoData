Being a frequent customer of this eatery I can vouch for their home made cakes, they are heavenly !! They have a decent collection of story books, so if you are looking for a "me time" with a good book and a cup of coffee/tea on the table then this place should be in your list. Staff is courteous and has a seating capacity of 15 people. The ambiance inside is really homely. But other than the cakes and beverages they really run low on other food items mentioned in their menu. Most of the time these items are not even available which is really disappointing. Though low on the pocket but I would suggest to go with a handful of cash because they don't provide debit/credit card facility. This obviously has a room for further improvement. Remains closed on Sundays.

Had been a regular at this place since 2011.inspite of its  cumbersome appearance and the average quality of food it offered,I personally liked visiting this outlet for its hospitable staff and the added advantage of getting a good number of books to read while munching some evening snacks.a recent visit however has left me extremely disheartened.the staff seemed to be unconcerned and did not even apologise for not paying necessary attention  to the food we ordered for.the quality of food served deteriorated even further.the cold coffee served did not even had sugar and it tasted awful.it was disappointing to have such an experience here. i will not recommend anyone to visit this outlet further..

Average decor and ambience. The hospitality is awful . They are confused about their own menu and misguide the visitor. Totally unprofessional behavior. Don't even take the order properly. After confirming the order three times came up with the worng food.  Afterwards started fighting over the same among themselves in front of us.  Went there to spend quality time together instead had to sit in such a bad Ambience.  Waste money and an evening wasted.

Take the lane from the taratala auto stand and walk straight, turn right from where the lane ends.
Small and cosy café, with a very cute orange color decor.
We ordered:
Pan Fried Chicken Momo that was sauted nicely in a great Chinese sauce with veggies, but the Momos could've been a bit more soft. The chicken filling was yum! 
Strawberry Magic, which was a strawberry flavoured creamy drink.
Mango Mania, which came under the same drinks category. 
Both the drinks were soothing & creamy.
Nice place to Hangout with Friends. Surely coming back as it's Pocket Friendly & would love to try their pasta.

My only purpose for visiting this place is to grab a quick bite after spending a romantic evening with my special someone. The cosy ambience adds up to the mood. However the food can be better. I always feel it is a bit overpriced if the quality of the food is considered. 

Adding an edit to this review as I got to visit again today (27th july 2017). Well this is for the "special" staff that takes care of the place in the absence of the owner. A request the owner to change their staff  ASAP or there might be a loss in business. I have been  a victim of unnecessary ogling and looking straight in the eye when i showed discomfort. Also please tell your staff to lower their voices during service and replace the spoons and forks after dropping them on the floor. They literally washed them off with just water and served them along with our food. Try to clean the tables as soon as other customers go away. Doesn't look nice. Dissapointing!!!!

After having heard quiet a bit from a friend who ASPIRED TO VISIT THIS PLACE FOR PAST DECADE.

I decided to give it a visit.

In the month of April when you can feel that it is cooler outside than inside than no point of having AC installed.

" Hathi ke dant dikhane ke alag khane ke alag hoten hain. "

We ordered pan fried chicken momo and dragon chicken. In both I left searching for taste of chicken. I found momo's were very rubbery and as if not fresh.

It did taste good with all that spices and oil but still it didn't feel fresh and healthy.

People running it were quite amicable.

Till about a year back, I used to hang out here with my friends quite often, because it was easily accessible for all of us, was a cozy place, and prices were reasonable. We especially liked their vanilla sponge cake. Now, for the reason we stopped going... one evening, a few of us were here, and we had ordered coffee, cake and sandwiches. After we had finished eating, we were still sitting and chatting. A few minutes later, one of the women who worked there came to clear our table and asked if we wanted to order anything else. When we said 'no', she said she would bring the bill, and then we must leave. After getting over the initial shock, I asked what the problem was, since only one other table was occupied and it was not closing time. She replied that the fan in our part of the cafe was on just for us, and if we didn't order anything else, they were 'not allowed' to keep the fan switched on. When I told her that I hadn't heard anything so ridiculous in my life, she rudely asked us to take it up with the cafe owner who lived upstairs. Well, we just paid and left. But since that day, my friends or I have never gone back to Pam's, so they lost a lot more business than the money they saved that day by switching off the fan.

Kind of tiny. But, somehow it has the homely feel to it. I have had the Momos here and I can't complain. Not that there is a dearth of momo places in Calcutta but this place has a special touch to it. There are little books on the shelves and you can sit here and chill with your friends while hogging. All in all, a cute little place that lives up to your expectations.

PAM's is named after the initials of three friends who opened the cafe during their youth. In the early days,you could find one of the owners moving about the cafe,serving food. 
Long before the concept of reading in a cafe caught on,PAM's had dog eared books and journals you could read while sipping on a cooler. I have spent many hours between school and tuitions sitting inside this joint located near the chetla-taratala auto stand. 
They used to make a good fritata and an average sandwich.
Like all dreams of youth, the friends have probably moved on and away from this cafe.
The food quality has deteoriated but the price still remains pocket friendly. 
The rating is purely on nostalgia.

Went to this place the other day with a friend. Its a pretty narrow place which looks gloomy from the outside and even more on the inside. The staffs were lousy as it gets and the ambience was disturbingly dull and unattractive.
As far as the food was concerned,disappointing like the place itself. They don't even serve proper coffee. The food was nothing impressive. Just some average tasting pasta and sandwich.
Would never recommend to anybody.

Pam's Cafe was a bad experience for me to be honest. Starting from the food to the behaviour of staffs and the ambience everything seemed to be wrong. I didn't like almost everything. I saw the zomato ratings before I went with a hope of getting something better even when the ratings are low but it nothing changed.
To start with. As soon as I entered i didn't like the ambience. The furniture were not fitting the place well with too many of them were adjusted forcefully. It was not comfortable. Secondly, I didn't like the service at all. The staffs don't even smile or greet once, instead they talk as if they hardly care. I asked "what's the speciality menu of this place?" The answer was "Everything is special here, you can order anything you want from the menu"
And then the most important part of a restaurant or cafe i.e the food. It was not good at all except one item.
These were the things ordered:
#True Blue : It was more of a cough syrup mixed with water. The two ice cubes were just to give the feel of a cooler. The only thing good about it was the colour.

#Pink Blush : This was a strawberry flavoured drink which again failed to impress. Only thing which I liked was the deep pink colour which was coming nice in the pictures.

#Chicken Mushroom Frittata : This was little better than what I expected after finishing off my drink. More of a omelette with chicken, mushroom and cheese toppings. I found it to be little more oily. But it was not bad to eat.

#Dragon Chicken : I cant explain how bad it was. I think they don't know what dragon chicken is. The upper coating over the chicken is just bad. I don't use the word "bad" so often but this time had to. It was just BAD.
A big NO from my side for anyone who is reading this review. Do not order this.

Last Words:
A Definite No from my side. The only thing which can attract you is the price but that's waste of your money.
Lots and lots of improvement needed.

2/5 for this place.

This eatery serves good cafe style food. I've never been disappointed during my visits. The ambiance is cozy, homely and warm. It's got an all female staff which is quite nice to see. The collection of books put on display range from Good to average depending on your taste.
Now, the food is fuss-free, be it my favorite hot and sour non veg soup, fritata, the junglee sandwich, or any pasta dish. I especially love their blue lagoon, and m sorely disappointed when it's not available. Service is a little slow, but then it's justified, as they make everything from scratch. They should try to extend the area a little more.

Well this is my account of first and last time I went to this place. This one is funny, it was crazy hot outside and the only reason we went there was because it had AC. When we entered it was off so we asked if the AC worked or not to which they said it did. And for the next 5 mins I was staring at them to as when they would turn it on. So I thought it was my fault that I hadn't framed the question properly. So I asked them if they could turn it on, which they did 😱
The order was pan fried momos and chicken noodles. Momo was decent but noodles looked and tasted like sevai. Place looked shabby and not up to the mark.

Had coffee and chicken pakora in this place for me most of times and taste wise is is absolutely average.

If you want to catch up with friends with a low pinch on the pocket then this is the place.

If u want to spend ur money to have food inferior to roadside stall then go to pams.... Fritata is just an omlette and chicken drumstick is just a stick without chicken. Spent 370 for a snack but had to end up with fuchka from the person in front of pams just to assure oneself that u had something..... Better save money rather than having at pams..

Pam's is nostalgia and warmth nestled in one cozy corner of Taratala and New Alipore. You will always get a decent cup of coffee, mouthwatering momos and a slice of the house cake (most of the time). The ambience is laid back and you have an array of books you can choose from and sit with it along with a cup of warmth or cool juice. Have had many first dates here. Even brought my Delhiwalli girlfriend back in the days here to show off this tiny gem of my city. Love Pam's.

It was 22nd Sep'15,my father's birthday.He is an old man who has lost my Mom this Feb.I just wanted to make him feel better on that evening.He is dead `against dining out.I chose to go to Pam's with him.It is small but home like looking cafe.We order a plate of noodle immediately,chicken one.We were told it would take 15 mins.We had some paperwork and finishing it.After sometime we saw a man getting inside the kitchen and coming out of with a plate of noodles.But wait he himself sat at the counter and started having it.We waited.No,nothing was coming our way and the people at the counter were looking blank toward the wall.Again a lady and her mother entered and ordered.The young gang of 5  had already finished food before we entered.Now i knock them again and they give a SHITTTT!!!!!! kinda look and says 'deri hobe'-(we will need more time).My father walked out.Thanx for ruining my special day.This rate 1 is for allowing us to sit for 20 mins without food or water.(I am the wife of the person who is rating it)

Always been fond of tiny little escapades amidst the hustle-bustle of the city. Pam's being closer to home is always the first choice for a steaming plate of pan fried momos or a quick cold coffee. 
The warm ambience and homely service adds to it :)

This is basically a small cafe carved out of the garage of an apartment building. Its a small cozy place with a collection of books that you can pore over. The place is pretty old by the looks of it but the atmosphere is very homely. The negative point is the food. The coffee we ordered was lacking in milk and flavour. The egg mayo sandwich was bland and the momos were a bit too squishy. I liked the place overall but they really need to work on their food. And it doesn't burn a hole in your pocket.

The specialty of this place is that this place is very much homely and the food is awesome.  If any fine evening you are feeling lonely you can easily go there and chill.  I must say that this place closes quite early and the positive point after all this is Pam's has got a very small collection of books for book lovers :)

I find the food to be overpriced, considering the quantity. For example, the 5 pieces of momos that they serve isnt worth Rs 80. Instead u can have amaizng momos at Steam and Fried which isnt very far away from this place

Its a nice, sweet & homely place. The ambiance & location is good. I tried pancakes,iced coffee,pasta,momo out there. Pancakes & pasta were realy good. I like this place cause its very hygienic & the food is prepared with care after you order. They dnt provide pre cooked foods. Dnt expect food preparations by professional cooks because its a homely place & the foods are like home made. The prices are reasonable.

Was a quaint place for small bites. But slowly becoming a place to avoid. The badly behaved jerks they have employed are a big turn off. The a/c have stopped working (or have they switched it off to save on electric bills). Food is just about ok

Tiny little place located right at the taratala and new slipper junction is the perfect place for killing time over a book and some amazing pasta.

Happy eating.

Small yet nice place to visit if you are looking for a quick bite. The atmosphere inside is very cosy with well adjusted tables and chairs, paintings, piles of story books stacked. I ordered for chicken sandwich grilled as a take away. Though I had to wait for long but I must say that the sandwich was a perfect one. It tasted great and I am looking forward to give a visit over here and taste the other foods that they serve. Nice experience as a first timer :)

A quaint lil place tucked away in a corner , far from the bustle of the busy taratala intersection.
A nice place if you don't want too many people around , I chatted up with my friend till 9 ( considering they take a lot of time to serve ) and gorged over momos,  chicken drumsticks,  green tea and masala chai. 
Food was average, pocket friendly, making it an ideal haunt for school- college goers , and a perfect place if you want to take your sweetheart since they will give you enough time to enjoy each other's company. :)

Okay.. After a tiring day.. Me and my aunt went there for break .. And as like always.. Pam's welcomed us with its good food ... We placed order of coffee first .. Then my favourite one vanilla cake with chocolate sauce and ice cream toppings ! And it tasted the same just like i tasted it on my first visit to that place ! Then.. We decided to have grilled potato onion sandwich ! It was too delicious ! You all should give it a visit atleast once ! 

P.s : one of the most pocket friendly café in behala..!

This small cafe is located near the taratala auto stand. It is been there for a long time. I have visited "Pam's Cafe" quite a few times. It is a small coffee joint run by a woman and her kin most probably. They offer various dishes like sandwiches, milkshakes, juices, pancakes,chicken wings and beverages like coffee ofcource. I have tried out almost all of their offerings and i am more than pleased with the quality as well as the quantity of the dishes by considering the less than reasonable rates. This place is moderately decorated with half a dozen tables snd can accomodate around 10 people(rough assumption). It has got a homely feeling with no fancy decor. Having coffee over here feels like sipping your beverage sitting in your own living room. It is quite a good place to enjoy a cup of coffee and sandwiches with your friends and having a healthy conversation in a peaceful environment without suffering a severe pocket pinch.

Though you need to wait for quite a while, the momos they serve are delicious. The pan-fried momo is just too good. They have a tiny bookshelf for you to read while you wait. the decor is colourful and place is comfortable. The service is a bit too slow. But it's a nice place to hangout with friends or just grab a meal when you are too hungry without being much heavy on your pocket!

I had a pathetic experience when I went to this cafe for the 1st time (and that was the last time too) few years back. I had odered for a cold coffee (so far so good) and as I was about to finish my drink.. I saw a big insect which lay dead at the base of the glass. I was traumatised! .. I had that drink all along when there was a dead insect! And then the staff do nothing about it and were not much bothered.

Discovered this place when I was in college.

and I kinda like it.

They have some books there for the customers to read or pass time while their order is getting ready. and the small vibrant and calm atmosphere. :)



their sandwiches are tasty and filling.

i love their momos.

(I am a momo freak)

and the coolers are no doubt good. Mint magic is my favourite.



and I love the fact that the place is run by some women. they are good natured and soft spoken. :)



but there is just one problem with the place... i.e... their service is very slow, compared to other cafés.. 



But if you overlook it, this place has some good food... 

:)

I used to like this place before the staff stated behaving like jerks. They should also consider getting the an Air conditioner for this place. I mean seriously. It's really hot in the summer. The food is okay at the most. I'd say pay a few bucks extra and go to CCD.

Pam's used to be my regular hangout at one point of time. It's a cozy little cafe which offers you no outstanding delicacy but items sufficient enough to satisfy your appetite without much of a pocket pinch , just when you are dying out of hunger.
Basically they serve dishes which can be put within the bracket of simple "home- made stuff"... for instance the 'Grilled Chicken Sandwich ', Fritata, Pancakes, plain cakes, Chai (Tea), Green tea, these are all things we generally grab when we are hungry at home...that's exactly they do. The cafe gives you one lazy dazy homely feeling where you can ideally sit back and chill. Good for evening chat sessions with friends, or back from office chilling out hub.... and incase u are alone..no worries, U vl not get bored as they have decent collection of Story books...U can always  get ur hands on a book with a mug of Hot chocolate maybe.

PAM’S CAFÉ - A cafe to chill with your dearest one. :P 
========================================================================================

Intro 

Pam’s café is located at Taratala. It’s near to the taratala auto stand or you can say when you head towards Mani Towers through the short lane. 

It’s a small café, but it has a warm and nice ambience. Its run by women from what I could guess. 
========================================================================================
Food and Beverages: 

Coffee: It was good, had perfect sugar and was served in seconds of placing the order. 

Steamed Momo: It tasted well. The momo’s were tender and it was not too oily either. 
========================================================================================
Pros:

1.	It has a very homely feel to it. 
2.	Its not to expensive if you want a quick bite. 

Cons:

1.	More items on the menu would be better.
2.	Service need to be improved.
========================================================================================
Conclusion:

Overall, Pam’s café is good place you want to grab a quick bite and at a reasonable price. Its 3.5 from my side.

This small café can attract your eyeballs because of its moderate site, just opposite Taratala auto stand in New Alipore. Yes, you cannot play around in this diner, but you have to take conscious leading steps. But when pushed the entrance, you will feel a friendly milieu. In a narrow passage non metallic low chairs and tables were set in a decorative way. 

You will find a women's army who is handling with orders and servicing on tables, but not with a smile. But you know what, we don’t eat smile, we eat food. So let’s come to this. On my first visit I have tasted their Pan Fried Momo, which had taken me in surprise. It was mouth watering flavors swimming in my plate. I just swiped out my plate, but I had to admit it when I dropped by second in search of the same food. I was utterly disappointed. I have no idea what went wrong, the dish which was presented was not the same at all. Their pancakes are subtle in taste. 

The service department needs to improve a bit. But yes, this café can give you the breaking path taste, which you can’t get on normal ones. As the matter of fact, they are not rude on your pockets so you can have a go.

This is a small cafeteria located near taratala in new alipore. The impression before entering the place is of one where you could go and eat your heart with little pounding on your pockets but the place does not live it up to that imp. 

The fact that it is run by a couple of women is appreciable in itself but the food standards could improve. The sitting area is not so big and seats are weird but spacious and comfortable enough to grab a quick bite. The hospitality is not handled so professionally but at these prices, it could be forgiven.

The food is average though. My first try included the momos which were average. Sandwiches and coolers were good enough for those prices but their homemade cakes are good. There are not so many options for momo lovers in this locality which gives it a decent crowd. But if am very hungry and want a quick bite at reasonable budget without any particular cuisine in mind, i would prefer the krishna restaurant nearby.

I will narrate a small incident. We were a group of 10 people. We went inside this cafe and took our seats. After looking into the menu some of us decided to leave, as we did't find what we were looking for.

We left, and were standing just outside the cafe, when a lady from this cafe appeared, and said 
- " Bol ke nahi ja sakte kya ??? Mazak samajj ke rakhha hain !!! " ( why did't you people tell me before leaving ? You think this is a joke or what ? )

Now its up to you people to decide whether you want a bit of this " hospitality " !!!!!
