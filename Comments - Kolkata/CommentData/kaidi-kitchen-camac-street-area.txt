This was my first visit with my mumbaikar bestie to Kaidi Kitchen and before that I didn't get good reviews about the food for this place from people. But I must tell the readers that this place serves awesome food with mind boggling ambience of prisoner cell. One will surely get the actual experience. Courteous and warm staff behaviour also adds another star on the jailer's uniform. A must go place for vegans. 

Also, a request to Kaidi Kitchen to remove that extra 10% service tax after the implementation of GST. That stopped me from rating you even high.

Keep Rocking!!!

Ambience here is amazing. **The service staff behavior is pathetic.** Not acceptable at all. Asked the staff for dal bowl..the reaction was as if it was a huge favour done to me while the bowls were given. *Main course* at Kaidi Kitchen Camag St. is good, I ordered for paneer bara masala and dal dhabey wali. But the appetizers to start with I ordered Dahi sholey and it wasn't up to mark, full of cardamom flavor. The barudi aloo were dry, not too fresh and not too hot. The indian breads that I called for I requested for soft breads but to my surprise the breads were too hard to bite on. On requesting to change the bread the captain denied to give the breads where as the timing for the restaurant shows 12pm to 11pm..! SAD!!

I went to Kaidi Kitchen recently . The food was good and was served nicely but the issue was with the serving quantity.The quantity was less as compared to other fine dining places.

Also,they forcefully levy Service Charge @10% on the bill amount and are very reluctant to reverse the amount . So,guys do tell them before hand not to include service charge in the bill if you don't wish to pay it.

Food ordered, subtly forced to make choices by the waiter ( don‚Äôt know why, it did not felt like that he was explaining menu to help us understand). Any way, food came in 5 minute ( everything together), didn‚Äôt allow us to sit and settle and then constantly trying to force us out, even denied that they have any deserts in stock !!!! Shocking!

The place is themed like a prison and the waiters and other staff are dressed alike. The staff and waiters are courteous and efficient in their work. The food is decent. A significant downside for this place is that paying 10% Service Charge is mandatory here, besides GST. Unlike all places in the city, the service charge is not optional. You will find numerous other veg resturants in the city at this price. All aspects combined, the place is not quite worth a second visit.

Kaidi kitchen is one of the better fine dining restaurants in Kolkata. There is hardly any fault in the dishes be it Indian or Chinese or continental, they get everything right. The portions served are also good. A trio would be in a better spot to get most of the order as opposed to a pair. The service is also good, and staff are courteous. Price wise it is a little expensive, but the prices are justified given the ambiance, quality and quantity.

A themed restaurant, that's rather well maintained. True to it's name, the staff is dressed in uniforms donned by the prisoners and Police, giving it the whole "chor police" vibes, with mock cells lining the restaurant, with tables and chairs for a large group. As far as the food is concerned, its delicious, but strictly vegetarian with options to cater for Jain customers as well, on request. It is a little on the pricey side but the food and timely deliver on it and at the end, expense doesn't matter.

It wasn't very difficult for us to locate this outlet at camac street.true to its name,it is designed as a prison with the employees dressed in uniforms as in jails.i am not a lover of veg foods bt liked all the preparations ordered here.we had virgin pinacolada as an appetizer and steamed momos as starters.the Mexican yellow rice we had ordered next was well cooked and delicious.we also had pan fried noodles and chilli paneer.the quantity of food was pretty good and me along with my two colleagues had a sumptuous lunch there.

The theme of the restaurant is totally unique and the interior justifies the name completely. There are cabins designed like jail cells and the waiters are dressed as convicts, isn't that brilliant ?
Coming to the food, I loved the Litti Chokha here, which is an ordinary Bihari wheat dumpling filled with sattu but Kaidi Kitchen glorifies it.
I only went there to have litti chokha, so I cannot comment on other items served here, but I'm pretty sure they will be great as well!!

Loved the ambiance and the staff courtesy here. However, we had to go early to get locked up in their cell for dining or else, we would be sitting out on normal tables.
I loved their cheese balls (little spicy though), mushroom salt and pepper and paneer makhanwala in their main course. The quantity is also sufficient justifying the quality of food and its price.
A must visit, at least once for a different dining experience coupled with good food and service.

Ordered mexican lasagna which was simply superb. Little spicy, little tangy n flavorsome! Mushroom salt n pepper was another dish i liked.
Butter naan was good. Paneer bada masala was okayish. Daal makhani was tasty.
The dessert was a disappointment. Ordered vanilla ice-cream with sizzling brownie. The brownie tasted stale.
A thing which irked me was they charge GST on service charge. The GST should only be charged on food but they include the gst on service charge along with the food total. Even after pointing this out, ≈•he servers pointed out their helplessness. 

Overall a good experience

Experiencing imprisonment (willfully!!)

Food: Being a veg restaurant, it was surprising to see the collection and variety of food on offer. However, we settled for a Greek Salad, one Schezwan Noodle and a Shark bite for beverage. The food was pretty good. Particularly the Greek salad tasted very fresh and soothing. We asked to make the schezwan extra spicy and they made it perfect. The Shark bite was minty and refreshing. Was pretty impressed with the food quality and quantity.

Ambience: The ambience is absolutely perfect. The waiters are dressed as Kaidis and the people who took orders dressed like Jailers. We were given a small cell which contained a small table and 2 chairs only. The lighting was adequate and matched the ambience for a jail cell. Once the food was served, they closed the cell's gates from outside and we were left alone in private. Privacy is fully guaranteed. Absolutely enjoyed the ambience and kudos to the authority for maintaining this ambience so strictly.

Service: The staffs are very very helpful. Since, u r locked inside a cell, it is not possible to get up and shout out to waiters. Hence, the Jailers stay close by and keep a keen watch in the cells and promptly come to service if u indicate. Cash and card accepted. Parking is available. The only drawback was the 10% "Service CHARGE" they levy upon the total bill amount. This should be abolished immediately.

Overall: Will definitely visit this place again. Scores high in both Food, service and ambience. Strongly recommended for anyone who hasn't been jailed yet. For people like me, it brings back old memories though!! :P

Kaidi Kitchen as well all are aware is a very unique place. In order to give you that 'kaidi' vibe you are seated in small jails, complete with the waiters dressed to serve their part. I'd gone for dinner with my friends and we were very hungry. We ordered the palak paneer, the kaali daal, shahi paneer, naan and another gravy. It was extremely delicious! I didn't think I'll like the food as much as I did. I kid you not, I loved the food! Also, an added bonus, the place is quite cheap as well and the food filling.

Location - Camac street crossing 

This place is located at the adjacent to camac street crossing beside Hp petrol pump . As the name suggest its all thing its a jail based restaurant with 2 floors and facilty of Vallet parking is also there . The restaurant waiters are dreased up like prisoners and managers are dressed up as Officers . The place has 6 prison cells in which u can enjoy your lunch and dinner with family or friends . If u r going on weekends plz make prior reservation so that u dont have to wait for long . Its purely vegetarian with different cuisines and the the varieties of dishes are pretty impressing . The quantity is also good . Price for 2 people without alcohols would be around 1500k . Hope u all enjoy the Jail based restaurant . 

Food -4.5/5
Ambience - 4.7/5

A great place to enjoy a dinner time with family... ordered Rajasthani Kofta which is a delight to tastebuds...also Subz Jhalfarezi is a nice combination of spices and veggies...The Hyderabadi biryani was an awesome climax to our dinner...Also the interiors were great creating an ambience of that of a Jail... Although regrets that couldn't try drinks...All and all a great experience and enjoyed with my parents and brother

As you know it's a themed restaurant so the dinning tables are kept in different jail cabins.We three were put in one of them.The ambiance was so genuine. Staffs were very extrovert. They take people's photographs without any hesitation. But it was very dark inside.Although they clarified that it was jail so darkness has to be there. Anywhere moving on to the food as it was a vegetarian restaurant we didn't took the risk of ordering continental dishes.We ordered Indian food. They included Butter naan,Dal Makhani,Aloo Dopiaza. All of them were good.For desert we took sizzling chocolate brownie.Tasty it is was.

After hearing all praises about this place I called up kaidi kitchen on a Sunday evening to book a table but it was on first come first serve basis. We reached there by 8:20 but got a table only at 9pm. The jail theme is pretty good but it is available just for few groups. So most of the groups were sitting on normal tables and we were one of them. The AC temperature of the place was very low and it was freezing cold. It should be taken care that very low temperatures are not preferred by all. The manager was polite enough to say that the AC was centralized and nothing could be done about it. Most of the staff was polite but very busy. They didn't even stop to pay head to what we had to say. One of the staff members was giving sarcastic and rude replies to our pleas. This is not expected of a restaurant of this stature. Coming to the food, the crispy chilly Babycorn was very spicy but good. Unlike other places which serve honey chilly potato, this place has tried making two dishes out of this- crispy chilly potato and honey glazed potato. I would recommend they should have honey chilli potato instead of these two separate dishes as the dish exists because of a reason. It is suppose to be both chilly and sweet at the same time. The honey glazed potato was okayish. In the main course we had paneer makhanwala and butter naan and butter roti. Paneer was good whereas the rotis were just perfectly cooked. They should increase options for desserts in the menu. They did not accept cards nor payment wallets unlike mentioned on zomato. I wonder what could be the reason for the same. Thankfully we had cash or else we would have been in a fix. In all it was an average experience. Would rather try better and new places than going here again.

Tips for customers- It is located near Elgin road. Do not forget to use GPS as it is slightly difficult to locate. Also be careful as it is located on a one way road. Also valet parking is available so parking is not an issue. Reach by 8 or so on weekends to be sure that you get a table early or try the zomato feature of booking a table a day in advance (I couldn't as it was a sudden plan). Try and sit in the jailed area so that you actually get the feeling of being imprisoned. The food was just fine and the rates did not justify the taste, so not like you are missing out on something.

Finally we were jailedüòÇ... 

Gud ambience... Nice music... And gud food..
We had a hardcore vegetarian in our gang  for whom even onion and garlic are a big no no...

I feel they should work better on their service....
This why I hav rated d place 3.5.. the problem was we ordered three dishes and they served  all three dishes at one go.. I actually told them to serve one by one ... It was like they were in a hurry to serve and leave... and I found few glued to the television... Heheh which is  not at all appreciated.

We ordered three starters only as they said d  main course is not available but then we  were happy to be served all three without onion and garlic.

1. Crispy chilly potato- Average taste as and slightly sweet.

2. Mushroom kurkure-  crispy coating and mushrooms were cooked real well... Recommended for d ones who love d less spicy stuff

3. Paneer tikka- loved it. Highly recommended...

4. Pink Lady- avg

Treat of a place for veggie lovers, this place is so well balanced in its interiors and its food that the blend will mesmerise you. The place is very well decorated with a prison theme and just when you thought the place will only be good for its interiors the food is going to blow your mind. All the cusines are a must eat, all of them are very well prepared and the taste is yummy. The plating are exceptional as well. Do visit !

A hidden gem in the camac street. This place will serve you some best veg food in the locality. The ambience is super cool.The jail themed resto with the waiters in the costume of security guards and you in a cell like cabin will get a feel of a real prisoner or a kaidi in this place. 
Now, the food. I have been here a couple of times. Once i had their north indian cuisine and the other time i had their italian and mexican cuisine. I liked them equally good. We had cheese balls, crispy chilly brocolli, mexican sizzlers and spaghetti olio here. They were damn good and also the north indian were good. I loved the place. Would love to visit this place again and again.

Im not a veggi lovers but went there with friends, cause some one close recommended me this place and the name of this place also catches my attention. ¬†Its something like you are going to prison for dinner or lunch. A nice theme based restaurant in camac street. The ambiance was good. The owners tried their best to show it like a prison. Those taking the order are dressed as police inspectors and those serving the food are dressed as prisoners. The special areas enclosed for VIP guests are enclosed high security cells. Food was good and price was reasonable. Well make a visit not for the food only for the theme also.

Waited a long to visit this place and I feel it was worth that. The ambience didn't disappoint at all and actually it did make me feel like I was in a jail with jailers and Kaidi all around. Kind of an amazing experience.  Coming to the food which was extremely tummy filling and tasty. We got a lunch offer of unlimited Indian and Chinese food for just 450/- which was truly the best part and a kind of offer which one usually offers.  So overall a good place for vegetarians who wishes to have tasty food. Service was on point which includes on time food on table. 
Thank you

The theme is too cool where the waiters are dressed like armed guards at a prison and you are setaiong as a prisoner. 

Food are all vegetarian but nice .

Quality is flashy quantity could have been better.

The only issue the entire restaurant is not entirely themed as a jail some parts are so the illusion fades away so quickly. 

They should work on these .

Overall a cool place and if you are lucky enough then you will get a seat at the corner one where its like a proper cell with a 2 seater table.

located at camac street ..they have valet parking ..It's a purely veg restaurant. Once in a while, it's good to visit themed restaurants that offer a tinge of difference from any ordinary restaurant. It has those beautiful chambers surrounded with jail bars with people serving food dressed up as jail inmates, giving you the proper feels of being in a prison and enjoying food. Music is really light and compliments the ambience.
Coming to the food, we ordered ¬†mostly north indian ..the food is not extraordinary
compare to the prices they charge ..I think they almost charge 30% tax+vat....i think price is only negative point there..otherwise it was good..giving extra +1 rating for ambiance it gives ... otherwise its 2.5 from me

This jail themed restaurant has been on my wishlist since a very long time. so finally my wish got fulfiiled this independence day. Located on camac st, beside the petrol pump... google maps helps to pinpoint the restaurant.¬†
The restaurant was not that crowded however all the cells were occupied so we waited for a while and then got seated at one of the cells. the servers and waiters were dressed in jail clothes.

We ordered the tandoori maharani Platter with an orange based mocktail and a lime-mint mojito for starters. the tandoori platter was huge with different veggies however potato was the dominant vegetable.. they did have some paneer tikkkas , mushrooms and soyabean stuffed potatoes.... but other wise for a non-vegetarian me they didnt have much veg varities to offer.

Moving to the mains we thought of trying the italian stuff so we ordered Cannelloni florentine....since it was independence day, they decorated it like the national flag. this dish was yumm...the cannelloni was stuffed with cheese corn and spinach and nothing could go wrong with this combination.

For desserts we had the famous choco plant... It looks like a plant in a tub but its actually a layer of crumbled cookies, cream and icecream. although we were ecstatic to find something unique but it didnt taste that great.

The menu has a lot to offer to the vegetarians and i will surely come back to taste some of their veggie goodness!

One would be happy to be imprisoned if the jails would serve such good food and ambience.  As the name suggests this place is a prison themed restaurant with the managers dressed as jailors and serving staff dressed as prisoners.  Also few of the tables are proper jails where you can get locked.  Coming to the staff , they were courteous and disciplined.  The food was pretty good and a pure veg restaurant is always a plus for me . They have Jain options as well . The food was cooked well and tastes fresh . The portions were sufficient for a group of 4 . You can try the sizzlers and  khow suey apart from the regular north Indian menu.  The desert menu is limited and simple . Over all a good place for family outing , reasonably priced and good food.

Moving to the mains we thought of trying the italian stuff so we ordered Cannelloni florentine....since it was independence day, they decorated it like the national flag. this dish was yumm...the cannelloni was stuffed with cheese corn and spinach and nothing could go wrong with this combination.

For desserts we had the famous choco plant... It looks like a plant in a tub but its actually a layer of crumbled cookies, cream and icecream. although we were ecstatic to find something unique but it didnt taste that great.

The menu has a lot to offer to the vegetarians and i will surely come back to taste some of their veggie goodness!

One would be happy to be imprisoned if the jails would serve such good food and ambience.  As the name suggests this place is a prison themed restaurant with the managers dressed as jailors and serving staff dressed as prisoners.  Also few of the tables are proper jails where you can get locked.  Coming to the staff , they were courteous and disciplined.  The food was pretty good and a pure veg restaurant is always a plus for me . They have Jain options as well . The food was cooked well and tastes fresh . The portions were sufficient for a group of 4 . You can try the sizzlers and  khow suey apart from the regular north Indian menu.  The desert menu is limited and simple . Over all a good place for family outing , reasonably priced and good food.

Good food and Well behaved staff. The jail theme is somewhat amusing. The bar is pretty good too. Decent value for money. Certain food items like rice, pulao are of good quality. Not a place to visit with a big gang. Recommend for 2 - 5 people. One might find the waiter dressed as a prisoner very amusing. They irony is the prisoners are roaming everywhere while the diners sit inside the jail.  Dont plan to go to a real jail after this.

We went here on Independence Day. Yes, we ourselves were quite amused with the irony :-D

The place looked quite like what I had imagined it to be. They have a few normal tables and a few larger ones in 'cells' - so yes, if you really wanna be a 'Kaidi' you've got to go in a larger group to increase your odds of getting inside the Cell. There were Kaidis who mainly did the job of serving dishes and clearing tables while, Jailors took orders from the tables. It sure is fun! It was crowded during the lunch time and they did a good job managing the same.

We ordered Baroodi Aloo, Rajasthani Kofta, Amritsari Chhole, Masala Kulcha, Cheese Naan, Fresh Lime Soda and Gulab Jamun. All of this for a lunch for 2 and yes, it overwhelmed us. The quantity of the sabzis is really a lot! One sabzi can easily be fulfilling for 2. All the dishes were really great! If I had to pick just one, I'd still pick all of them! I just have one complaint though - the tandoor is unreasonably high priced. It was good, but not worth the price at all! Other dishes were gems for their price!

The order came quick and hot. The Kaidis did a good job serving the portions to us. The chefs had given a nice tri-color touch to almost all the dishes which we quite liked! It being a dry day couldn't try anything from there...but would surely like to try it out!

Must visit place for your taste buds...and also for having a fun experience and evening with your bunch of people :-)

Horrible experience. The place is famous but they cheat their customers. One has to be very careful while ordering else they will pass one portion as two portions. And even after asking them to serve separately they will get in one plate. The staff is horrible lack basic courtesy and are rude. Turned a family dinner into a horrible experience.

Being a kaidi is tough but not when you are at kaidi kitchen. One of the best thematic restaurants in town. 
As the name would suggest , it has a prison set up .
You can either eat in a cell or there is a regular dining space . 
Being a 100% veg restaurant , the place does not fall short on variety . I had the mexican veg steak and it was superb . The spices are the right amount . 
The mexican items are a must try for they are the show stealers . 
After a hefty dinner , i had a chocolate plant for dessert and it was brilliantly presented as a sapling in a tiny pot . Very creative indeed ! 
The price tag is the right amount for a thematic experience . So go break the dieting rules and treat yourself to some prison time . :P

All that glitters is not gold!!!
After visiting this place it has been seen that zomato reviews can actually misguide you at times.
Had been to the place for a family dinner but had to return, disappointed. The food was not up to the mark and the service was pathetic. Even after complaining against the service measures were not taken to improve it. The only edible item was the onion. The place has good name for its mongolian food but i did not find that true. The place belongs to the best caterering team of kolkata and hence we had high expectations. I agree that Ganpati has earned a good fame since the past years but gradually it is being seen that the standard of the  company is coming down. If we can place you on cloud nine,we can also place you inside a heated mine!!
Hope to see some changes soon:)

As soon as we entered Kaidi Kitchen, we knew we were in for a wonderful feast in a yet more wonderful ambience. The cabins were designed like a jail. All the waiters were dressed like prisoners. The head waiter was dressed like a jailor. A theme setting for a perfect lunch was an awesome combination. Mushroom Salt n Paper for starters were crunchy and juicy at the same time. Lachha Paratha, Masala Kulcha with Paneer Rogan Josh made the perfect main course. Hydrabadi Biryani was also aptly flavoured. Pineapple Raita was delicious as well. All in all, it was a memorable lunch at Kaidi Kitchen.

The place as the name suggests has jail cells, prisoners and even a JAILOR :'D.¬†
Pretty much of an experience when it comes to the ambience, as you have waiters in prisoners uniform taking orders and serving you food, sitting inside a jail cell and a jailor strolling around . But , the food is not that great- just very ordinary like any other restaurant serving north indian food on the streets of calcutta, which would definitely be cheaper than the what is charged in Kaidi Kitchen .¬†
If ambience excites you, then do visit the place. But if you are looking for quality food then you can try some other place which would be better.

Saturday evening saw us having dinner at this wonderful restaurant. The Ambience was nice- soft lights, families talking and laughing, everyone having a good time. While we didn't get a chance to sit in one of the "Jail Cell", we were seated comfortably.¬†

For starters we ordered the cheese Fondue, served with toasted bread and sauted vegetables like potato, babycorn, black and green olives, broccoli. That was Heaven on Earth! Being Cheese crazy, it was a given that I would like this dish but everyone around the table loved this.¬†

Roasted Potato in Adobo sauce was one of the Appetizers we ordered and that was good too. I liked it more than the others- it was too bland for the liking of a few. ¬†

The other appetizer was Steamed Momos served with a clear soup. The momos and the dip were lovely. I savoured the soup- it was light and flavourful.¬†

From the Soup menu, we had ordered for Garden Vegetable soup which was oh-so-good. It tasted like melted Au Gratin. Niceeee!¬†

The other soup was the Veg. Sweet Corn soup. That was nothing exceptional.¬†

The main course comprised of Mongolian, Thai and Indian dishes. The Thai Green curry with boiled rice was yummylicious. But a family member who is a Thai Cuisine connoisseur said that she had had better Green Thai Curry. Well, we agreed to disagree :)¬†

The Indian spread was ¬†Dal Makhni, Aloo Do Piaza and Tandoori rotis. These were all delectable- must have cuisine in KK.¬†

The only glitch in the main course came when we ordered for Mongolian Barbeque noodles and rice with veggies- we had ordered for a minimal spicy dish and what came was very spicy. When we asked the gentleman who had taken our order about why he had not asked it to be made less spicy, he said that it was less spicy and was arguing with us. Only when we told him that if he will not change the dish, then he can charge for that hardly tasted one and get us a fresh one made. He then took the one that was already made and when he got it back, it looked as if it had just been made sweeter by adding sauce. Sigh. Such a disappointment. That was left as is, only after a few bites. The argument too left a bad taste in the mouth.¬†

Baked Rasogolla was the sweet ending to our meal. That was so-so. Very sweet. That was left untouched as well.¬†

Overall, we had a good time. Would like to visit a second time and see if the good things become better and the bad things become good.

Ambiance is as the name says like a Jail, they have sitting inside the cell which is fun.
Service is a bit slow and inattentive, should improve.
Mocktails are great ! We tried chineese which wasn't that good. but i have heard the north indian is good, so may be next time i will try that.
its a different experience (ambiance wise)

Located at camac street, this place is getting famous day by day. The restaurant is themed as a prison, it has small cells with a dark ambience. The manager is dressed like a jailor while the waiters as prisoners. The entrance is a parking lot where you would have to usually wait because of the rush. The rush is on weekends, so the tip would be to  try it any other weekday. Also has an open bar for those who would like to follow up their dinner with a drink. One tip would be to not parcel stuff from here, they charge about 25 rupees per container which adds up to about 200 extra for a regular parcel.
Coming to the food , the restaurant serves Mexican, Italian, Indian, chinese and Mongolian.
I had ordered 
Paneer tikka - Not upto the mark, quantity was too less for the price charged
Nachos- Very regular, nothing special
Hakka noodles - Tasted okay, do give the dish a miss.
Chinese sizzler- Tasted better than other dishes.
Cheese fondue - Creamy and just right. Though priced high.
Soups and shorbas were bland
Pasta- Very basic. Give it a miss.
Try the paneer nawabi or the kadhai paneer laziz- both the gravies were very tasty . Definitely had an edge over the usual paneer dishes.
Hyderabadi Biryani was okay but what was disappointing was that they served no raita with it.
Masala kulcha and missi roti are soft and definitely worth a try.
The food is average and brings nothing new to the platter.
The service is slow, waiters have no idea about the dishes.
All in all

An expensive treat for the eyes not for the stomach

Visited this place with family for dinner on a weekend. The ambience is nice, the staff are well trained and the place is easy to locate.
The servers are all dressed as prisoners and the mangers are dressed as the warden of the prison.
Coming to the food, they have a decent selection to choose from. For starters we order stuffed aalo, agio olio momo and cheese fondue. The aalo was soft and flavourful and the momo was also good. Along with the momo they serve the normal chili garlic sauce and also a peanut paste which was yumm. The best starter was the cheese fondue, it was warm, tasty and made you go for more.
For the mains we ordered a Lasagne, Chinese sizzler, Panner Makhachkala, Chana masala and 2 Kulcha. The Lasagne and the sizzler was good and also the portion size was very good. The Indian however was the best of the night. The Panner was just melting in the mouth and the Chana was outstanding. Each Indian dishes by itself is sufficient for 2 people. We had also order drinks for all of us.
Overall a nice experience.
The bill came to approx Rs 4700 for 5 people and it's reasonable considering the quantity and quality on offer.
Will definitely visit the place again.

The restaurant makes for a great break away from the regular establishments in the city. Although a jail is not somewhere where anyone would go for a meal (because of the stereotype that one only gets breads and onions for meals), you'd be surprised when you glance through the menu.
The waiters dressed in prison clothes (whites with black stripes) make for a monochromatic appearance. But their willingness to come to your rescue, when you're confused about what to order first / what goes well with what, will put a smile across your face.
Be adventurous and take a swing at North Indian cuisine.
Could use better music & a little more lighting within the cells.

I had been to this place when it had just opened a couple of years back but since it was too crowded we left without eating. How much I wish i had not made this second attempt!

¬†It also goes to show how misleading ZOMATO Reviews & Ratings can be at times. Before i begin with what transpired last evening, i would like to say that this review pertains to their North Indian cuisine only. 

So there were 5 of us and we  were craving for some really good north indian. We chose this place over Zaranj, BBQ, Bombay Brasserie ( fools really, in hindsight ofcourse). 

DECOR: Their Decor does not impress me much but yet we did sit in one of the cells because i had my 5 yr old niece with me. Its a half hearted attempt really to make it look like a jail because apart from the cells and waiters in jail uniforms everything else is pretty much run of the mill. 

FOOD:  Soup - 1. Tomato Dhania shorba- right consistency but no tanginess of tomatoes and too oily. Lacking flavours too. What does so much oil have to do in a shorba? 

2. Tom Yam Soup- Again the same as the above. Too oily! The chef was probably finishing his stock of  leftover oil i suppose. This too was flavorless.

STARTERS: 1. Baroodi Aloo: Spicy baby potatoes with nice smoky flavour to it. Probably the only good dish we had. 

2. Hariyali panner tikka- Generic paneer tikka marinated with green chutney. 

MAIN COURSE: 

1. Rajasthani kofta: I ordered this because heard good things about this on zomato. Apparently it is also the chef's specialty.  It reminds you of the kofta moms would often make to increase your vegetable intake or  finish leftovers in the kitchen. But mom's make it is tasty at least. The gravy was again very heavy and rich. 

2. Kashmiri Alu Dam: The alu and its stuffing were okay but the gravy was again so rich. The chef was probably trying to camouflage his incompetency to cook tatseful food by making the gravy excruciatingly heavy and rich.  

3.Yellow Dal tadka:  They should call this chana dal tadka because it was full of it and red chilli powder. Total disappointment.

BREADS: Tandoori roti, Masala and onion kulcha,cheese naan. Bread were all well cooked, crispy and tasty.

SIDE ORDERS: Hakka chow- This was well made, the way it should be.

Fresh Lime Soda- Both sweet and salted were well made, came in jar like bottles. DESSERTS: After such a bad experience we decided to skip it.

BILL: The bill came to a whooping Rs 3300 inclusive of a 10% service charge.  So thats Rs 650 per head without desserts. if we had ordered desserts the bill would have easily shot up by another Rs 1000-1200 making it Rs 850-900 per head. Can this joint really demand such premium pricing? I beg to differ.

CONCLUSION: It was just a one time visit for us definitely, i cannot think of wasting money here again. All the props and theme can attract initial curiosity and footfall but at the end of the day its the food that counts. The service was good, for which they are already charging me a good 10% but i will neither be stepping foot again nor recommend anyone. 

ALTERNATIVES: Zaranj, Bombay Brasserie, Kuazi n Kadai, Crave foodworks etc.

I was very intrigued about the prison concept when I first heard it from my friends in Chennai. This was the first place that I visited as soon as I landed in Kolkata. Classic case of high expectations and falling flat. The first setback was when we had to wait for about 20 minutes for a table in the parking lot without even proper seats. . We wanted to experiment with the flavours and ordered one dish of each cuisine. We zeroed on Litti Choka in the Indian, Corn fritters in Thai style, Pasta in 4 cheeses in Italian and Mexican Lasagna in Mexican. Once we decided on the order, it was delivered within record time and full points to the super quick service. However felt the flavours were not very authentic and definitely did not do any justice to the money spent. Even the prison theme did not really come through except for the decor and costumes of the waiters. One time visit just for the new concept.

This theme restaurant located on Camac Street lives up to its name...the waiters are  in the prisoners uniform and there is also someone in the jailors uniform. There are tables and chairs behind bars where one can dine( resembling a prison cell). It's a multi cuisine Veg restaurant,with Italian,mexican, Chinese and Indian veg items. We decided not to be purists keeping to one cuisine but to mix and match. For starters we had mini Tacos which were served with sour cream and salsa along with fresh green salad.( Awesome). Also had litti-chokkha which is a sattu ball roasted in tandoor and mashed potatoes with onions,green chillies in mustard oil ( very tasty but too filling). The veggies we ordered Kashmiri alu and paneer with exotic veggies in white gravy( yum). The breads laccha paratha, chur chur nan and Missi Roti were all good. But the pasta dish was ordinary,not very tasty. The cucumber Mojito too lacked punch and tanginess( was over sweet). But an interesting place and definitely worth visiting. The staff were polite and well mannered. I will definitely want to visit again to try other dishes on the menu.

With the name itself you feel like you're entering an innovative place.  I won't give it marks for innovation as the interiors could be well worked upon. The cutlery etc was very basic where as a lot could be done with the same. Food and drinks were reasonably priced and the taste was decent as well. 
An ideal place to visit with your family for a dinner.

The concept of this restaurant was something  very different. It's been put up well too. The jail ambience is been maintained well with prisoners serving the and the jailor as the restaurant manger. Haha! Good innovation. The food served here is completely vegan but has a quite a lot of variety. The waiters are well behaved. 
The quality and the taste of the food is really good. It's been presented very neatly. We had ordered for the below things :
‚Ä¢ Manchow Soup - The soup tasted good. It had lots of veggies in it and had a balanced taste. Something good to start with.
‚Ä¢ Rajastahani style kofta curry - This was among one of their specialties. The koftas were made out of veggies and also tasted great.
‚Ä¢ Veg Pulao - The pulao had an amazing aroma and tasted well.
‚Ä¢ Naan & Missi Roti - Both of these were fresh and brushed with a whole lot of butter.
‚Ä¢ Brownie with hot chocolate and Vanilla Ice Cream - Well this was the complimentary dessert we got just for liking their page on Facebook which was so amazing. Loved the dessert as well their hospitality.

My overall experience to this place was awesome. It's a must visit. I am looking forward to go again and have an amazing time.

Went this place ¬†with my family and the food was awesome. ordered several dishes and everything was exceptional except biyani . However the price are on a very high side - Breads cost you 150 bucks which is damn expensive. There was also a dispute with the staff regarding Cheese Naan which i ordered for myself but was not served and on asking them even they could not find it on the table but they billed for the item and were adamant on having served it which was all time low for a luxury restaurant and it spoiled the entire mood of the dining.

Simply a delight for veg lovers !! Located in Camac Street, though old but it is a one of a kind restaurant. The jail theme is one of the many attention grabbing points. Awesome food, good service. I'll happily take a life imprisonment here. :D

A fine dinning pure vegetarian resturant,I have visited it once on opening and once now, will located this resturant is done up like a jail which h makes it stands out. I was greeted well and given a nice seat. The food was disappointing... I called for I ordered a cottage cheese satay which was not well done, it had a wierd smell and taste. An agli olio which was tad too oily and did not go well with my tastebuds! The choco plant saved the meal. Unhappy we left the place.

This place is among my personal favourites for its vegetarian food.
The ambience is pleasing and service is quick. The theme of eating in cells is exciting. 
The Litti Chokha is brilliant.  Worth a try. The starters platter is good.
The main course was also good. 
No complaints with any dish. 
I feel desserts should have a wider menu options. 
Overall recommend.

It's a vegetarian's paradise!! I should rather say its a 'cheese lovers'' paradise!! I got to say this!!
The ambience is quirky because it's not everyday that you get to eat in/outside a cell and are being served by people dressed as jailers and inmates! :p The service is fast but you wish it had been faster when you see your cheese fondue melting fast and sticking to the vessel before your extra platter of bread crumbs arrives! After visiting all the seven heavens with the cheese fondue literally arousing our taste buds(!) we ordered Canneloni Florentine which was good, especially for people who love herbs in their Italian food and then we had Spaghetti Carbonara with Sun-dried tomatoes! The guy who helped us choose asked us to take it with white sauce and I swear we didn't regret our decision! Extremely creamy, nicely cooked , you can 'feel' the cheese. We also tried the cream of tomato soup but that was quite a regular dish. 
In one word..AWESOME! If you like Italian cuisine , don't stop to think twice. THIS is it!And it isn't as expensive as the menu card may look 'coz the portions are sufficient and your stomach will be happy and full when you leave the place! 
P.S.: I missed out on the Chocolate fondue but I'm sure it will be as good as the cheese fondue (c'mon, it's melted Chocolate!) But I'll definitely be back to this place to have something even more sinful and cheese-ful!!!

After 5 failed attempts to write a review about this place, I think this will be my final try of perseverance. üòÇ

This outlet - my best vegetarian outlet by all means, is where I have taken all my non - vegetarian friends to try vegetarian foods. That much I like to visit this place (ya ya, I know - no need to complain about their price)

But let's look at the brighter side, if you are luck or may be wait for your time, you may finally get to fulfill one of the 3 conditions to become a man/woman (y should they be left behind - Rathore nincompoofs). Whatever - basically you get to be a kaidi and dine in a lockup - yipeeeee üòÇüòú, The fun begins!!!!!!

Apperizers: Don't frg8 to order the Paneer sikandari kebabs - Super awesome üòò
U can also give their mushroom kurkure a try.

Main Course: Mexican n Italian dishes IMHO are hits and misses and some of them may even upset you bad, very bad.
I opted for their Indian offerings - Dal makhani, Pista Kofta are some of my favourites. Sabzi dewani handi and Paneer Nawabi are some notable dishes.
Butter Naan, stuffed naan are really soft and tender. Should like them tooooo.

All n all experience was good and a big thumbs up üëç

Kaidi Kitchen for Christmas dinner was not themed but they didn't go wrong at all in their food. Started with a vegetable cream soup which had tiny pieces of vegetables in it. Tasted perfect. For starters we went for Baked Potato in Adobo Sauce (white cheesy sauce preparation) and Crispy Chilly Baby corn. The baby corn was on the sweeter side. Main Course comprised of Paneer and Daal Makhani, as basic as it can get - the gravy was rich and fresh. For breads, we ordered awesome Cheese Naans and Onion Kulcha. Pick up the yum meetha gundi paan on your way out after the meal.

The major drawback of this place is the entry from the dimlit parking lot. You have no propr waiting area. Its kind of difficult to locate this place but they serve good vegeterian food. Their jail theme is awesome and staffs roam around in dressed as cops. Not a real value for money but this place is becoming the hot fav for the poor vegeterians of kolkata considering the fact that they also serve jain food.

With 8 colleagues for company, entered this unique concept-place and was amused by the lockups and the costumes of head waiter (jailor) and other waiters (prisoners). 

More than half the group was very unpleasantly surprised when we discovered that the place is a veg-only place with 'Jain' option, too, for most dishes. (Alcohol, though, is freely available.)

The disappointment lasted only till we had the fortune of having an amazingly delicious meal, comparisons of which are difficult in Kolkata.  The mushroom and babycorn appetisers were common but a treat for the tongue. From Thai Green curry to Spaghetti to Indian daal, mushroom and pulao, we had it all and all the hardcore non veg lovers just couldnt help going gaga over food.

Its located a little unconveniently and it doesnt look like making a lot of money somehow; but it just cant disappoint foodies.

Its easily one of the best theme restaurants in the city. Going by the name I thought it is an Indian cuisine restaurant but the 24-page menu simply 'wow'ed me. They did justice to all the dishes ordered be it the momos-thukpa , crispy chilly baby corn or four cheese pasta. The ambience is soothing with dim lights and slow background music. Service is good. Definitely a must try!

So I did not visit this place before because all i had heard was how overpriced this place is. And how below average their food is. 
And on being there for a family function, I could partially agree with it. Yes it is over priced but the food is not below average.
1. Crispy chilly broccoli is yum. (Chose this over the babycorns please)
2.dahi ke sholay was a very dull dish. You can definitely skip that one. 
3. Lukhnow-e-kebabs is a MUST have. 
4. Pink Lady was over sweetened. Presentation was not great either. 
5. Spaghetti aglio olio with garlic breads was a treat. Very well cooked with the perfect blend of herbs. 
6. The Chinese sizzler was not that great. I have had better ones.
7. The cheese fondue is a must try for all. The fondue was pure sin. You can not have just one dip bite. It leaves you asking for more.

The service was very attentive and really courteous. This place is a vegetarian's paradise. Totally looking forward for more visits. The only downside is that it is overpriced, and only some of their dishes are not worth trying and should be avoided.

Probably my bad that i bumped into a vegetarian restaurant. The situation got worsened by the service provided by the waiter. As we were least interested to go through the menu, so we asked his choices. He hardly had any know how. Crispy chilli corn is the worst that I ever tasted. Mushroom was inedible, only saving grace was the cocktail. By the time the biriyani arrived I have given up all hopes. Not visiting again. Hugely disappointed. At least thought that the food would be edible. Full waste of a lunch and my time. And how could I forget the price. I could easily had a mouthful in any decent restaurant. A complete no suggestion to all

A decent restaurant for people who prefer having a good ambience, over the quality of food. The food is good. But at such rates better food can be easily available in near vicinity. For people staying in Calcutta, if you're tired of usual dining and want to give your meals experience a new twist. You can give this place a shot. 
The food is okay-ish  but the presentability does grab your attention. And it's a good option for people looking for a "different " dining experience.

It's different, and though it's a vegetarian restaurant, it's good. The biggest draw is definitely the restaurant's quirky ambience. True to its name, it looks like a prison and waiters dressed like prisoners give the place a weird/spooky feel. Food too is good. If you are a vegetarian, then this restaurant should be one of your top picks. Service is excellent. The only word of caution from my side - getting anything packed might seem expensive @Rs 25 per box.

However there are managers who are dressed in suits which is passe. I think instead maybe they can go for a fresh look and change this to a kurta chudidar with a bright bundi/nehru jacket to make it more refreshing, going with the theme and a bright contrast to the other service guys attire. The overall decor was pleasant to the eye with a lot of tables and a bar. Service was excellent. Ordered the aglio olio momo and a cheese fondue for appetizers. Something felt wrong with the cheese but when we told one of the suited managers they promptly changed it. Both were slightly above average. For the main course ordered a burnt garlic fried rice and a chilli potato(gravy version). This was definitely quite good. Would have ordered a bloody mary had it not been a dry day :( making me have my regular fresh lime soda salt. Overall a nice casual place you can drop in sometimes for lunch or dinner and get a variety of food to order from.

Can't imagine to step in ever again in this life. People are ready to pay if something is worth it. Horrible north indian food which we had. Just for the sake of the ambience one cannot harm their own pockets. Trust me if you visited the place already and you liked the food then please meet me personally can't humiliate anyone in public. Utter disappointment and disgust for the spoilt occasion.

This place is lovely.  The starters are very very good.  The place offers a good mixture of Italian and Mexican dishes.  I tried a rice based Mexican and was very impressed.  The service is a tad bit slow. The price are not pocket friendly but for the taste and quantity it is worth it.

Finally visited this all veg, prison style restaurant. Dim light did create some discomfort. I loved the paneer nawabi we ordered, however Rajasthani kabab were a bit disappointment and so was lemon soda. Rest all was great. Service was fine. Will def go there again for that paneer nawabi.

M Not a big time veggie food lover so I had kind of no good memory other than the theme of prison which is very unique from the visit to this place and I felt like people give visit to this place for their curiosity of theme not because of taste of food.

In a place like Kolkata where u have a huge range of food in very reasonable price I felt the food is over priced. We have ordered crispy chilli baby corn, paneer malao sheek kebab, paneer tikka, dahi k sholey, baroodi aloo, Mexican corn soup, hara bhara salad, paneer makhanwala, malao meethi matar, aloo dhania, tandoori naan, laccha paratha, peas pulao and hyderabadi biriyani.

Sorry for not having any pic yet we have ordered so many things as I have already mentioned it was not a memorable visit here.

I have been to this restaurant couple of times, the latest one being in August 2015. Here is what I feel about this restaurant :

Ambience : When you step in for the first time, it blows you away with its quirky look. Being a theme restaurant, they focus a lot on giving that end to end experience to the customer. The door looks like a Jail gate, the interior is dimly lit and resembles that of a prison. Food are served by people dressed like Kaidis and Jailors. The chairs and the dim lit cabin are very much like of a prison cell.¬†
Tips : Try to get in the prison cell type of cabins and dont sit in the open space. The cabins give much better feel of the ambience.¬†

Food : Well, being a non vegetarian, I was initially bit skeptical about trying food here. I always see better value in Tandoori chicken than in paneel kebabs. But frankly, the veg dishes available in this restaurant is no less delicious than the non veg ones. Food is awesome and prepared with great care. A sure recommendation.¬†
Tips : Try the momo (olio or something they call it). Very tasty starter. Then try Lucknow e tikki. You might have tried tikki in many other places, this one is surely one of the best. Then in the main course, try Matar Dhania Kulcha with Paneer Rogan Josh. These are the ones I tried and all of them were superb

Quantity : bit on the lesser side, specially on the starters. Momo - 6 pieces in a plate, Lucknow tikki 5 in a plate. I feel that is seriously less. Paneer Rogan Josh was good enough for 2 people or even bit more I would say.¬†

Price : reasonable. Two starters, one main dish and couple of breads will cost you 1300 bucks including tax. Not bad

Value add : there is live music. That person plays decent music and plays music of your choice on request. Very nice. It is unfortunate that I found other people busy reading their menu card than listening to him. That is rude I say, but you cant change people¬†

Put off : There is a service charge component in the bill. This is a forced addition to increase the bill value. So, if you have spent 1000 bucks for food, apart from VAT etc, you will be charged additional 100 bucks as service charge.¬†

Hope you find this review useful. Keep enjoying the food !!!

This place will surly feature in one of the good family restras in Kolkata. Good ambiance, good service, well mannered staffs, and good food. Plus the prison theme adds a different atmosphere all together for those who prefer the prison cells. The menu is vast and almost everything tastes good. Nothing in the menu disappointed me. Will like to give a special emphasis on the beverage they call 'Masala Marke'!! It's a drink for taking revenge spicy revenge on other friends or cousins or siblings. Haha

Themed based restaurants are always very appealing.  Kaidi kitchen has a completely differently feel to it. Go to jail for the right reasons, FOOD ! on the 1st floor if you are lucky you can get seated at one of the prison cells. However good the ambience is the food is average; like any other veg restaurant. If they could have incorporated the prison concept into their food as well the place would have become legendary. On the whole a good culinary experience and I do recommend it.

A themed restaurant which is visited mostly by families. It offers Multi cuisine options at decent price. We tried there ali olio momos for starters which was the best dish out of everything we ordered. For main course we ordered capsicum burnt garlic fried rice and chilly potato which was very average. For desert, I opted for chocolate Monte Carlo which was a big disappointment and we left it half way. Overall I would have give 3 but I give that extra .5 for the service. I think it was the owner who was personally receiving the guests and was extremely courteous. These small gestures speak a lot and can totally make your visit a pleasant one. Might visit again to try other cuisine.

Kaidi Kitchen is a beautiful themed restaurant located at Camac Street, located bang opposite the Nizam Palace. As the name suggests, the ambiance is that of a jail, which is one of the biggest reasons you must give it a visit. 

‚òÖ LOCATION : From the Nizam Palace Bus Stop move to Camac Street where you'll see the large entrance of Kaidi Kitchen on your left . Enter and move to the first floor.

‚òÖ AMBIANCE : We had gone with a prior reservation which was executed smoothly.
The huge jail door leads to the lovely interiors. The unique jail theme which includes the staff dressed like prisoners and the guy at the entrance like the jailor, is really impressive. In fact, the latter was actually speaking in a stern tone adding the feel to his uniform! We had visited on a special 'Musical Nite' where a musician was playing the violin and guitar and humming songs as he walked past the tables. In the dimly lit restaurant, the musical atmosphere was surreal. You have the option of sitting inside a locked cell and enjoying your meal.
Fine dining in a jail = epic!

‚òÖ FOOD : As mentioned in Zomato, this restaurant is purely vegetarian. Although this turns off most nonveggie people, the dishes are worth trying out. We settled for a four-course meal. It started with a Choco Lust and a Blue Lagoon. Served in crude little jars, they were good enough to cool down after a walk in the pounding heat outside. Considering the price, I wish the quantity was better. 

> Paneer Malai Sheekh Kebab : The starter which comprised of four pieces of delicious paneer kebab around a serving of shredded onions and carrots was a treat. Loved it.

> Dhaba Style Dal : This is supposedly a signature dish of Kaidi Kitchen, whose taste completely explained why it is recommended so much. Take a naan or paratha with it and you're set.

> Paneer Bara Masala : Another recommendation from the staff. It was pretty decent and worth a try.

> Peas Pulao : A well prepared and nicely presented bowl of peas polao was served on our table. The quantity is enough for one.

> Choco Plant : This was an innovative dessert. A plastic flower pot filled with chocolate flakes, vanilla ice cream, brownie crumbs, nuts and topped with a cherry on which a little plant is standing - this is the mouthwatering dish. The perfect way to end the course of our meal. 

‚òÖ PRICES : The prices are on the steeper side if you keep in mind the low quantities of some of the dishes. A complete meal for two would come near about ‚Çπ1600. 

‚òÖ SERVICE : Absolutely brilliant service was received from the staff of Kaidi Kitchen, starting from the selection of tables to the final dessert. Truly appreciate their management of the food and the visitors.

The experience was mindblowing courtesy their striking ambiance and lovely food. Had the portions been bigger, it would have surely got a 4.5 rating from my side. :)

It was a Thusday night and we have decided to go for dinner near camac street. we have decided to try Kaidi Kitchen because of their creative showing, Loved the place with a JAIL ambience . Food is good, however, the price is a tad high but i am okay with that as long as you are serving good food and the hospitality is good. Even though we had reservations, we had to wait for a table, but that was fine, Every dish we we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. For appetizers we had the Paneer Tikka with Mint chutney and thus super yum! The main course was even better! I wish I lived closer so I could come here more often. For desert we had creme brownee with ice cream and Hot Choco syruo in top, It was creamy and delicious. I recommend going with as several people. Although not specified for veg resturant

My last visit to Kaidi kitchen has been a pleasant experience unlike the previous 2 visits which were sheer disappointments! 
I was unhappy with the service n most importantly the food! 
But this time I'm glad I don't have any such complaints! 
I had North Indian.. For mocktail I ordered masala maarke which had a spicy twist n was refreshing!:)
Aloo Eee aatishi for starter was pretty nice with proper stuffing ! It was quite a filler!
For the main course we had dal makhani n paneer bara masala both of which were rich n tasty.
Lachha was okaish...Other breads were crisp n well roasted..
The sizzling brownie platter for dessert was nice. :)
Staff was warm n served us well :)

Kaidi kitchen was on my life wishlist for a long time for its unique jail theme but since it was a veg restro, I kept on avoiding it. But when my friend insisted, I had to go.

We had previously reserved our tables. The first thing that struck me was the stunning ambience. It was like I was in a jail ! The waiters were dressed like kaidis. Luckily one of the cells was empty and we got a chance to dine inside the cell.

For starters we ordered paneer malai seekh kabab. Four pieces of seekh kabab with beautifully carved out pieces of salad. The presentation was impressive and the taste was beyond words. Being a pure non vegetarian, I never had any veg item as starter. But I never knew a paneer kabab could be so tasty !! It was soft juicy and just perfect !! The kabab just melted in the mouth. Having this as a starter is probably the best way to begin a veg meal.

Then we had our mocktails. Virgin pinacolada and golden jubilee. They were great and highly recommended.

Next came our mains. We had ordered butter nan, dal makhani, veg polao and Rajasthani kofta.

The butter nan was soft and buttery ! The dal makhani was just superb. I never had such good dal makhani before. The combination of the nan and dal makhani was like a burst of Indian flavours.

The polao was good beyong expectation. The polao consisted of almost veg ingredient- peas, carrot, large paneer slices, babycorn, etc. Now the kofta was a dish by which kaidi kitchen will be memorable to me throughout my life. Four pieces of kofta were served in an insaleny tasty gravy. The filling of the koftas was very tasty. This dish was a treat to the taste buds

Finally came our dessert- the sizzling brownie. It was so tasty that we almost burnt our tongue having it in a hurry !! :p

This place a sure visit for next time. The waiters are courteous and friendly. The prices are moderate in considerate to the luxury dining experience here. I would love to be in prison if I'm given food like this :D

Hi Guys,
I gave them 1 in their rating as i cannot give zero(No option to do so).
I believe a good restaurant experience involves healthy ambiance ,cordial staff and tasteful food.
The first one I have to say was so far so good but the staff attitude and food that we had was way below our expectations.
What you need to remember is how is the attitude of the staff when you go there at almost closing time as for any other time they have no reason to be bad.
We sat at the corner table ,Yes right below the TV (for those who have been there). The waiters constantly tried cleaning and arranging our table hovering over our shoulders while we were in the middle of our conversation from their plate storage area.
As it grew irritating we changed our table .At this place we had another waiter wearing shabby prisoner clothes(don,t know if that was meant to be) constantly prodding us to place all our orders.
When this happened a few times we asked him to wait patiently as they were still letting fresh customers come in meaning they would be taking orders for a while or so.
The starters came"Hariyali Paneer".The paneer was hard as stone ,and felt as if its been taken out of the refrigerator and served on tray.
We called the restaurant manager,told him we don't need the Paneer and that he should cancel it from the bill.He said in broken English that if there is something wrong with it he can get it rectified,we said again "Don't need it",just take it off the bill and we will order the main course".
He then said that they cannot cancel it and that it is his duty to get us a fresh one. To that I said , "Please do not serve this again,I will pay for it". Guess what??¬† He agreed without a word.He was getting the money after all.
It was shameful of them to do so.I came out of the place. Did not order anything else,paid for whatever I had eaten.
I will never visit this place again.As for you,decide for yourself.

I really liked the theme and the service met the promised expectations. The restaurant has a particular section which is divided into small cells and the rest if it is like a normal family restaurant. The food refreshes your taste buds. A classic veg restaurant.

Jailed for food ! As the name appropriatey suggests the theme of the restaurant.. one has to sit and eat in a cell ( but ofcourse comfortably and sophisticatedly).. food being served by the waiters dressed as jailers or prisoners. Vegetarian food. Quite diversified carte. Food is quite appetizing and flavorsome..Tried Indian dishes - fresh lime soda, Kashmiri aloo dum and nun(without butter) . We found the Fresh lime soda to be too tangy and sour. The other too dishes were savorous .Moderate quantity.Slightly overpriced. Taxes extra. In a nutshell, good enough to lure the vegetarian crowd.. the other half can surely drop in as well

Overhyped place, people flock to this place simply because of their prison like theme. This place is so full on weekends and holidays that you have to wait for more then an hour to find a table. Food is nothing much to write about as well. Go there only if you want to experience something different in terms of ambience.

I went there for my birthday. Since we were a group of 15, the reservation had been made earlier but to our disappointment, the table wasn't arranged when we reached!

Coming to the food, it was delicious. Special mention to the baby corn because I'm not fond of it but i liked the crispy baby corn. The paneer was good and the naan and kulcha were served well. The waiters were extremely efficient and made sure that the plates didn't remain empty for long. They served the cake but didn't take care while cutting them.As a result few pieces were very small.

Overall the experience was good and I would look forward to going back again.

One of the best themed restaurants I visited. Themed on jail with the waiters wearing kaidi outfits and the managers wearing jailor outfit. Even thr seating arrangements is like inside a jail with grilled doors. It's a vegetarian restaurant with sooo many varieties of menu of its kind. We hade a mushroom starter with margarita and butter nuns with paneer dopiyaza. The items were perfectly cooked and soo tasty. Wanna definitely come back to this place to try out other dishes. Specially their litti chokhas.

I believe it is one of the exquisite theme restaurants here. One that serves vegetarian food which lures any foodie to visit it quite often. My experience has been quite delightful. One must try the Paneer Makhanwala. I can anyday plan my lunch or dinner in Kaidi Kitchen with family or friends. And the ambience will make u feel good especially if you sit inside one of the prison cell.

Went on with a friend on Saturday..to check the veggie restaurant at Mani Square. Since we were two in no. they didn't let us in the prison, so sat outside. Ambience was good until some group of aunties started howling and the staff was unable to settle them. Food was good. We had food in Jain style and we did not regret having it here. A little high on the price but is worth spending on.

Jailed for food! Wow, amazingly delicious Indian food, very handsome portions and superb service. Once it became annoying when the waiter tried to become unwelcoming and over friendly. Overall my rating of 4.5 says it all.. Ate up 1 point on the rating scale because of the approach and entry to the restaurant; being located on the mezzanine floor through the parking lot of a residential building. The exit after a superb meal is an anticlimax. Nevertheless, food matters end of day!!

As the name suggests, the place has huge cells and gives the feel as if one is sitting and eating in a jail (but sophistically and comfortably). It is an absolute pleasure to have cheese fondue of this place. Food and moctails also tasted good. Though, i feel that the restaurant is highly priced. Had it been moderately priced, it would attract more middle class crowd.
But yes, i would like to revisit this place more often.

The food here is wonderful and it's all great value for money too. The waiters are courteous and alert and their service very prompt, friendly and respectful.  

The managers however are the worst I've ever come across. They were sarcastic and rude and were passing comments on our group, playing with their phones and gossiping with each other like teenagers and had no regard to our calls. I am not sure how a place with such wonderful chefs and waiters could hire such managers.

I have visited many times. It is a jail theme based restaurant, suits with the name " Kaidi Kitchen".  Food and drinks all are good. Service is good. Reservstions are also available. It has its new branch at Kankurgachi, Mani Square Mall, 4th Floor. These branch consists of three layers. Good place to visit with family and friends.  Pocket pinch is little high.

I visited Kaidi Kitchen after a long time..I had visited them when it had first opened and I must say they have improved a lot in all sectors.The theme of the prison is followed to the tee with the entrance being made as the facade of an Indian Jail,the waiters wearing uniforms like that of Kaidis and the stewards posing as Jailors !

Talking about the food,I just loved the Tandoori platter .It had mushroom ,potatoes,paneer tikka and cauliflower.The best one was undoubtedly the potatoes.The "baroodi aloo" has been appropriately named as it gives a big burst of intense flavours and tingles your tastebuds with its spice.
The kali dal was good.It was thick and creamy,I would just like some more flavour in it.
The service was a bit below par and should be improved as we got our drinks a good 10min after our food had arrived.Also we were first served naan instead of the rotis we had ordered.Nonetheless overall Kaidi Kitchen deserves atleast a 3.5 because of the quality of food.

Good interiors.
Cordial staff outside the gate.
Cordial staff in the kaidi uniform.

Manager in blazers, the one who attended us was not in the behaviour the others were in. He was making us feel awkward by  just standing outside and asking the waiter whatever we were asking him and replying in a weird way to the waiter to our question which was not indicated to him in any way. If you could teach your floor managers some ettiquette and a cordial way to be around customers. 
I cut 0.5 because of him.

Coming to food, it was delicious. The only thing I would suggest is to ask the customers if they would need cashews and kismis in the Hyderabadi Biryani, did not like kajus and kismis in it. Otherwise it was great. 
Cost is more on the higher side.

I was really bowled over by the theme and the story behind it linked to Tihar Jail.
The ambience is excellent, the dim lights underline the restaurant's theme.
And of course, about the moolah, believe me it might seem costly but it actually is a great value for money.
The quality of food is good.
I'd recommend the Kashmiri Pulao.

Theme is unique... Its quite different from the ordinary hotels........ Ine thing you won't like about this place is the quantity of the food they serve........ And the price is too heavy for that quantity......... We have ordered Mexican sizzler...... When it came we were shocked to see the quantity of it......... The restaurant is too pricey.......... If the price were 800 fir two people i would have rated it 4.5......... But its too costly and more over the food was also normal......... There was no different taste........ All the north indian we have tried have the same taste of gravy....... Stater was nice brocoli..... So watch out for the menu before entering............

Actually the review is not about the food, its about the service and approach. I purchased coupons for weekday lunch valid till 7.6.2015; It was not mentioned that the coupon would not be valid on 15.04.2015 and so requested a reservation. Was refused a reservation, stating that the coupon will not be valid. All deals on groupon are provided by the vendor and in this case by Kaidi Kitchen, there was no mention of the DEAL not being valid on 15.04 and hence is a complete violation of the deal so purchased. Worse the staff are unmindful of the customers in manner they speak and regard them. Have been to the place before, but from now on will never visit Kaidi Kitchen

Welcome to the Kaidi land! :D One of the most unique themes I have ever seen in a restaurant! All the prisoners are at your service while you have your meal inside the lock up!¬† Jailors are also present to supervise the place ;) Fantastic idea!! We went there on a Sunday night! The place is mostly crowded during weekends :( We waited for 20 minutes to get a table. (Should book in advance the next time :P ) 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We weren't so hungry! We missed the starters as we were late! :(¬† So we ordered¬† a Roti combo! The basket (Kaidiyon ki Pasandari Roti Ki Tokri) can be shared between 2 or 3 persons! There were 10 pieces in that basket (Kulcha, Tandoori Roti,Missi Roti & Naan). 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What should I say about the service provided by all the 'Kaidis'! They were very friendly, polite and efficient to leave a good impression. :) The kaidis and jailors agreed to take photos with us! :D¬† They served us with a smiling face! :) Ambience was great! And the interior! Wow!¬† :D 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The prices of the dishes were too high! :( But it didn't matter because the service, taste of food and ambience was too good! :D We would love to visit the restaurant again and again and again! :D Please open a branch in Trichy, Tamilnadu if possible :P
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall...Kaidi Kitchen is¬† A SUPERB RESTAURANT! :D

Great food but cunning staff. Low rating for staff otherwise food is good. Probably the management needs to look into the matter seriously otherwise things may go out of hands.

Welcome to the Kaidi land! :D One of the most unique themes I have ever seen in a restaurant! All the prisoners are at your service while you have your meal inside the lock up!¬† Jailors are also present to supervise the place ;) Fantastic idea!! We went there on a Sunday night! The place is mostly crowded during weekends :( We waited for 20 minutes to get a table. (Should book in advance the next time :P ) 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† We weren't so hungry! We missed the starters as we were late! :(¬† So we ordered¬† a Roti combo! The basket (Kaidiyon ki Pasandari Roti Ki Tokri) can be shared between 2 or 3 persons! There were 10 pieces in that basket (Kulcha, Tandoori Roti,Missi Roti & Naan). 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What should I say about the service provided by all the 'Kaidis'! They were very friendly, polite and efficient to leave a good impression. :) The kaidis and jailors agreed to take photos with us! :D¬† They served us with a smiling face! :) Ambience was great! And the interior! Wow!¬† :D 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The prices of the dishes were too high! :( But it didn't matter because the service, taste of food and ambience was too good! :D We would love to visit the restaurant again and again and again! :D Please open a branch in Trichy, Tamilnadu if possible :P
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Overall...Kaidi Kitchen is¬† A SUPERB RESTAURANT! :D

Full Points for Decor. Amazing concept. It was my 18th birthday and I got to celebrate it in a jail. Now thats something to flaunt about. XD The waiters are dressed up in kaidi uniforms which is like cherry on the cake. :)) 

Service : 4.5 
The manager was very considerate and helped my sister arrange the surprise birthday party for me. The waiters agreed to click photos WITH us. Oh yes, the very few times you want to be clicked WITH the waiter instead of asking them to click us. 

Food : Tried almost half of the mocktails. Dont remember much but nothing to complain. Other food items were also good. Food gets a 3.5

Value for money: a little pricey maybe 3.0

May visit it again :)

One of the most unique theme I have ever seen in a restaurant! Welcome to the Kaidi land, you are cordially invited by the Jail. And all the prisoners are at your service while you have your meal inside the lock up. Jailers are also present to supervise the place. Cracking idea and improvisation!! The place is mostly crowded during peak hours and weekends, we had to wait for 20 mins to get a table. I recommend you to grab an advance reservation (If they provide).

Being a non-veggie, I wish they had served non-veg as well! But, their veg items won't disappoint I guess. I had quite a good meal inside a small, dark prison!! :) We ordered Afghani Paneer, Paneer Bara Mashala and Mashala Kulcha. Taste is really good. :)

What should I say about the service provided by all the 'Kaidis'! They are very polite and efficient to leave a good impression. :)

The cost seemed a bit higher than it should be! A full meal for two costs around Rs 1400. But considering the ambiance, taste and service that is quite worthy.

Food - 3.5
Ambiance - 4
Service - 3.5
Value for money - 3

I love going to themed restaurants, and dining in Kaidi Kitchen was a fun experience. On top of that, the ambience was peaceful and the recommended "Dal Dhaba Wali" was delicious. Filled my stomach with cheesy naan and "Pink Lady" till I couldn't move from my cell. Service was well satisfying.

I do not think I need to write how amazing is this place as by reading the reviews half of Kolkata has already visited this place and knows how awesome it is but for the other half here goes the review. I am listing the only con this place has and no it is not that it does not serve non-vegetarian food ;) it is a bit difficult to locate you I was revolving around this place for about 20 minutes and then I actually found this place. That's it guys no other con for this place. Coming to the Pros; awesome decor and ambience. I really liked the Idea of jail and all the waiters were dressed as kaidis. The whole concept is so good. Coming to the food we ordered two fresh lime sodas, Paneer makhanwala, Butter nan, zeera rice, and sizzling brownie with ice cream. The lime soda was fine nothing' oh so wow' about that ;But the wow for us was zeera rice and the paneer it was DELICIOUS!!!!The paneeer was so fresh and just melted in my mouth and zeera rice was really you know light and still flavour if zeera was there because at some places if the zeera rice is light it means no flavour of zeera at all. The nan was good nothing to complain about and I am cake lover guys so nothing to complain about the dessert The staff was present at all times to see if we required anything. They did their part of jo very well. The bill came to 1178 which was perfectly reasonable for me. do give this place a visit. Let us sum the Pros and Cons of this place:)
Pros-awesome ambience(romantic also)
-reasonable for me
-real good food
-staff is really helpful
Cons-finding was difficult for me

Kaidi Kitchen, the name says it all. one outlet at camac street which was the first in the country 2nd in chennai where i have been and third again at manisquare mall in kolkata. whenever it comes to quality food with perfect dining experience, its always exciting to experience Imprisonment which is their tagline and trust me they really do give the best of all.

coming to Ambience: They didn't go over to make it cage and spoil to feel of classy, but they utilised their space very well to give you classy feeling with its clean interiors. truly sensible and intriguing ambience.

coming to food: Only vegetarian is on the menu card but yes its multi-cuisine and great variety options you have to try outs.
i ordered for cheese fondue which was best i had in kolkata from italian section. burmese khowsuey was the item i tried for the first time and trust me it was thebest of all. paneer sheek kebab from tandoor was again thumbs-up.
main-course was also amazing with their dal tadka, paneer bara masala and chana masala. getting confused what to order in breads i ordered for basket which was best option i had.
well i had no regrets in any  of the items i ordered but i had limit so unhappy for that. 
i have been to Chennai and mani sq and camac st but loved everywhere.
will definitely suggest everyone for class food and experience.

Ok, first things first, you are going to have a tough time locating this food joint. If you are lucky, you will succeed. Just across Seven Heaven, right at the crossing of AJC Bose - Camac St is Kaidi Kitchen.

A small lane from the main road into a very residential type building is the way to Kaidi Kitchen which is at first floor. The floor supervisors are dressed in a mock up of the Jailor's costume, the waiters are dressed in a modified version of kaidi costumes. The restaurant hag a big door which is a mock up of a jail door, and inside we have an open space with tables, and just across are some "jail" units. These are like clean lock ups. Now personally I don't know why someone would want to eat inside a lock up or a jail, but anything goes.

Ambiance is nice, staff is very helpful. Food wise I had the thai fritters which was not worth the money. I ordered Hyderabadi Biryani which was somewhat ok. The one thing I liked about Kaidi was the food preparation, the way they serve, the food looks awesome, and the drinks menu was good. I ordered virgin mojito, and it was perfect, except for the granules of sugar that they did not care to dissolve in the drink.

An ok experience, if you ask me if I would like to go back again, well, who would like to go to jail?

A day back I had attended Birthday party of my nephew at KAIDI KITCHEN.
It is distributed in two floors because as soon as I reached outside the first floor gate I was politely been told to go inside the gate upstairs.
As i went inside it was obviously crowded as all the guests had already arrived.
The place has a very nice themed layout - JAIL. Yes that's the concept which clearly compliments the Name.¬†
There was a buffet - set up just adjacent to the BAR counter as it was of no use.
There were 3 consecutive jails where people were sitting in and in the corner there was a dim place with more 2 tables.
The Walls were all bricks which was adding more to give a feel of real jail.
The service staffs were all dressed up as a KAIDI, very humble and happy to serve.

Talked a lot about the ambiance Now lets come to gourmet.
OUTSTANDING is the word!
I missed the starters as I was late but I heard they were really delicious.
Lunch menu was elaborate -
Dal makhani
Paneer butter masala
Aloo do pyaza
Mixed veg
Masala kulcha / Nan
Baked Rasgulla¬†
ice cream

Everything tasted superb. Dal and aloo do pyaza with masala kulcha was in the pin interest of all the guests.
Really nice preparation.

Yes the timing of refilling was turning off but manageable.
There was times when the salad and onions were over but it took them too late to refill it.

But the asst. Manager was there to help everytime and paid heed to all our needs and requirement.

As a guest i really liked the party.
Would look forward to dine in here with my family and friends

As a conclusion, I would definitely recommend it one of the exotic restaurants in all over kolkata - 4.5/5

Ambience : a very diffrent experience .quirky one indeed

Food : we ordered for cheese fondue ..w
Which was amazing. ...the entire concept of rissoto cheesey dip with sauted vwg and breads was quite awesome .we also ordered for kabab which was average as i found it to be dry .

Main course : we ordered for dal makhni ..roti and veg lasagne ....all of them were equally good .

You are busted once you enter this outlet..
There are kaidis serving you and jailers taking your order..
You are locked inside a cell in which you are served one of the most delicious vegetarian food in town..
They have a wide menu to choose from and you will surely be impressed by the presentation of the food..
Ambience is perfect..it cant be better..
Staff is well trained..
Price is a bit on higher side but is passable for such a great time and experience..

I have been to this restaurant before but today i finally decided to write a review because the food was just amazing! Had gone for a friends bday treat. We ordered cripsy chill baby corn which was fabulous i completely loved it so did everyone. For the main course we ordered dal-e-rezala which was not that good as it is made of white lentils and i prefer blank lentils. The person who was taking my order had told me this before but as we wanted to try something new we ordered it we also ordered english desi veggie which was superb. Along with the veggies we had ordered for naan n kulcha both were superb. Overall the experience was amazing. Just a suggesstion improve the lighting of the restaurant its very dificult to click photos!! Loved the food and so the place!!

The staffs are dressed in the uniform of jailors and prisoners and there are also some private cells where you can dine with ur family and friends.

I've been waiting for so long for Zomato to include Surat in its list and especially this restaurant.

Leonardo's is the most authentic Italian place this city has seen. The recipes remain truly Italian in their flavors and thankfully haven't been surti-fied (too much cheese and sugar is how most surtis love their Italian). What's more the head chef is an Italian himself - Giuseppe.

I have eaten here on two different ocassions and both times come away happy, sated and grinning like an idiot.

The food is served piping hot and in generous portions. And when I say generous, I mean GENEROUS.

The cheese fondue served here is probably the best starter in the menu.
A very well planned theme and a good place for dinner.
Not so pocket friendly yet the food served doesn't give you a chance to complaint.
Valet parking available and quick service too.

Located in camac street, having valet parking facility is the best part about this veg restaurant..With a very different concept of a jail the ambience is really good,jailers serving you and taking the orders:P.The jail cell which is generally given when you are in a group of more than 4 or if the place is empty ¬†you can sit there but the sitting area is very small and congested...Coming to the food it was pretty average, i had ordered for babycorn,paneer tikka,pasta and few more stuff...if the taste of 1 dish is nice the second one is not that good so by the end your meal you are not fully satisfied with the food...service is decent..waiters have a good gesture...
You can definitely try this place

It was just before Diwali when I went with few of my close friends for the treat. We had been planning since a long time to try out the food of this place. We went to the restaurant and we found the theme so fancy and fascinating and after seeing the prison which was the asset of the place to attract the customers, we then and then decided to have the food seating in that prison. We ordered food and in no time it was on our table. They provide the quickest service in town. The moment we order something, we see it in front of us within 5 mins(literally). We got done in an hour.. The food was truly delicious and yummy. Yeah kinda expensive but honestly worth it. 5 on 5.
Great job guys.. Keep it up :)

Finally a themed restaurant in Kolkata! From the ambiance to the costumes of the staff everything was unique and detailed. Do ask the staff to arrange for a seat inside a jail. :D

Food was delicious. We had a veg sizzler which did taste good! And the quantity was enough for two.

On the downside this prices are too high and the place is vegetarian. So for a non veg lover like me, that's a big no no! I love the entire experience in the restaurant but I'd probably not visit this place again unless they start serving non veg.

Amongst food Indian has to be good and it was really delicious and i also liked babycorn which is ofcouse my fav and the kebabs which were too good.. Only my bad luck was i didn't got the booking in the jail area because we were 7 of us.. One has to be in a group of 4 to sit inside a jail.. LoL.. But nevertheless the other areas where undoubtedly superb.. A big smiling thumps up to this :)

As the name suggests, this place has interiors like a jail with waiters dressed up in stripes and one person roaming around like a superintendent. Obviously there are cells on one side of the restaurant which is more of a personal dining space for groups.¬†
Now beyond the novelty of the decor, the menu is a regular vegetarian spread, but what redeems the regular menu is the awesome tasty food they have to offer.¬†
Shaam Savera Kofta is the best I have had. So is the peas pulao they served. My Dad who is very finicky about the Roti's and Nan's would be very happy at the quality of Nan served.¬†

Ambiance - 4.5/5 (the cells are a bit cramped for the number of people it is designed for)
Quality of Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4/5
Price - 3.5/5 (slightly on the higher side considering there is nothing new about the spread and is strictly vegetarian)

Went to Kaidi Kitchen to have veg continental food with a friend. The restaurant is well maintained, and the service is decent, although I don't have a clue as to who gets intrigued by the Prison based theme. The ambiance was decent though. We ordered Fondue and it was a delight initially, although I found the quantity to be a little on the lower side. The problem though is that they don't have any arrangement to keep the cheese warm. They lit up some candles below the dish but needless to say, it was inadequate. So, once its cold, it doesn't taste as good anymore. But overall I liked their food.

One of the worst experiences i have had since the time i started visiting resturants. I booked a table for dinner and specified them that we are 10 adults and 2 children. When we arrived they gave us a area which has been designed as a jail cell. The place was so congusted that hardly 8 people could sit there. The person sitting at the end of the table had to pass his glass to the waiter serving water. However when i asked the steward to change our table he said that they do not have any table avaliable at the moment. Since the seating was uncomfortable we got up and left the place without having dinner. Resturants being so commercial that they do not think about the comfort of the customer are an absolute no no no....

Kaidi Kitchen

You cannot judge the book by its cover...same is true in case of this "Theme based restaurant"..Its only once you open the book and experience...you will get to know the real story.The moment you put your foot inside, you will get a different feeling...something like "yeah...i am at the right place! :)".The ambiance is good, the set up is good, the food is good...finger licking...I was looking for something unique to spend my day with my special person and KAIDI KITCHEN was an apt one(now I can say that). My better half....just loved it...and off course we enjoyed our day :)
If you haven't visited it...you are missing something! :)
One of the few good restaurants where you will find a good ambiance, good food, good service, good experience.(Basically.. the ingredients which are required to make a memorable moment)

One place where both north Indian and continental are good to taste and won't even dig a hole in one's pocket. The place is a must visit and different food items should be tried.

The name sounded quite interesting so I had to add it to wishlist. Was excited to know what exactly d concept is... visited it on a family occassion. Thankfully we had booked it in advance otherwisd wud hv had to wait for atleast 45 mins to get a table.. this place being a vegetarian restaurants is alwaz fully booked...be it weekends or weekdays! Advance booking is highly recommended. The seating layout is very interesting, there are jail like cells as well as normal seating..though normal one is quite a hoch poch situation. But the cells are spacious for small families.
Coming to the food...most of dishes we had looks temoting and are equally delicious.  Specially the crispy broccoli,  very well prepared.  They hv all d cuisines; indian, mexica, italian, chinese....anc desserts are quite good as well.
Its a little pricey... overall, a good experience.

This place came by me in zomato only, I never knew that a place like this ever existed. Well, themed restuarent and bars has always been a special attraction of mine, but this place was very unique to me strictly of the prison theme which was very astonishing for me. The jail-like coupes or tables have a very demand and thus I would advise to book in advance. The ambiance is nice enough to enjoy the meal. However, the Indian cuisine is not that good in comparision to the International cuisine. The price is a bit on the high side, so I would suggest not go for Indian cuisine. Its not at all that good.

Finally I got a chance to land the place on my birthday.
I visited d place with 4 of my friends and we choose to sit inside the JAIL. 
The ambience is excellent, staff pretty good and the decor is eye soothing.

We started with the usual fresh sweet soda lime and it was really poor.
Next the starters
The crispy baby corn is very good, the only place after BSS where I would love to have it again.
The paneer tikka was average but the chutney was awesome.

The main course was just like any other average restaurant,  nothing fancy about it.

Overall the food was average.

Last but not the least the pricing is bit on the higher side as compared to the quality of food.

Not for the theme, Not for the ambience or the service. Not for guys dressed as jailers and prisoners. Solely based on the food they serve. I loved the place. I could not stop eating. There were quite a few things on the table and I don't remember what I loved the most but I am sure there was nothing I didn't like. By the end I had eaten so much I couldn't move. The place is usually crowded. It's always recommended to make a booking before you show up and see a huge queue waiting in front of you. It can be even more exciting if you fancy eating in a jail. And it is vegetarian, which is great!

Highly recommended by a friend, I wanted to visit this restaurant during my Kolkata visit. Before leaving for the place I phoned them and enquired how to reach there and whether I would have to pre-book a seat. The man on the other side: Chief Steward or Manager,  was quite courteous and gave me the necessary directions. Having reached the place, I found it to be heavily crowded although it was almost 10:15 PM and the kitchen was supposed to close by 11:00PM.

I started with cocktails : COSMOPOLITAN (Marks=4/5)and PINA COLADA, which were served with Potato wafers and salted peanuts. The first one was good but same can not be said about PINA COLADA which was not upto mark( Marks=2/5). I also ordered Mexican Nachos, which were good, (Marks=4/5).

I wanted to have Mexican food but the manager suggested that I try Indian food as the the same was their specialty. I sensed that probably they do not have a good Continental cook and consequently this suggestion was a defensive one. Nevertheless, I ordered Minestrone Al Pesto Soup and my apprehension became very clear as the soup which came was having the base of Tomato Shorba with sprinkling of chopped coriander with dices of pasta and some vegetables (see pic ). Also the use of Indian spices as in Tomato Shorba was quiet evident. When enquired, he was defensive in his approach and tried to convince me that this is their own recipe for Minestrone. When I countered that if it was a modified version why was this fact was not mentioned in their Menu, he had no answer. He offered to exclude the same and asked me to place an order for the main course: I ordered Paneer Bara Masala (Marks=2/5) and crispy plain naan. (Marks=3/5).

Overall food was not very good and many restaurants in Kanpur / Delhi offer much better taste and quality. Nevertheless, one can visit the restaurant once purely for the new and unique theme experience. PRICES: On higher side.

Highly irresponsible management.  If you go to this place please never trust vallet facilities. On 10th of july 2014, my car vw polo was banged badly by the driver of the restaurant while parking. Next day morning when I saw two big holes on the bumper of my car I was shocked. I called the manager of kaidi and he said he would get back to me but no surprises as he never found it responsible to get back to me. I wouldn't want any money but an apology atleast. If a restaurant cant maintain customers car and act irresponsibly how can we be rest assured about the cooking standards. Pathetic.

Lasagna was brilliant and so was the crispy baby corn..  A place all the vegetarian food lovers should visit.. The price is very decent for the ambiance and the service level created and maintained..

Have now visited Kaidi Kitchen a couple of times, and every time I want back for more. The khowsuey is a must try and we swear by their Virgin Mojito.  The ambience is excellent - only suggestion is to start taking reservations so that we can visit more often before thinking about having to wait.

Kaidi kitchen

The name suits the place. It is totally appropriate and let me tell you the waiters are actually dressed as Kaidi's . I must say that if I ever got the opportunity to go to jail and I come to know that they serve this kind of food then I would run to grab it! The food is very tasty and they give you a lot of variety to choose from. The sizzler is worth a try and so are the potato jackets! The food is yum and yum and yum.

Food 4.7/5
Service 4/5
Ambience 4.5/5
Variety 4.9/5

It was my first time here. I was here for a birthday celebration with my family. The ambience n the food is fabulous. The theme for the waiters dressed as "Kaidi's" is not something one sees everyday. Our order arrived timely n service was smooth. Would love to visit the place again sometime. Next time, hopefully, to sit in a cellar. Cheerio.

I visited Kaidi kitchen today, and trust me, the experience was really good. :)
My friend gave her B'day party there, and it was really nice. They served us very quick and made us feel really comfortable. :)
We gave them cake to bring at the desert time and they bought it with rose petals decorated beside the plate. It was really nice of them. They even played the b'day song for us while cutting the cake. :)
The food was really good, the babycorn, dal makhni and naan and even the paneer was awesome. :)
i would recommend to visit it, a worth experience :)

Food is simply awesome and spicy and mouthwatering and delicious. Cheese fondue is the best starter there. Management of the place is equally good. Had visited the place twice and planning to have a visit again and not to forget to mention about the lovely sizzling hot brownies followed by the cool lemonade.

¬´¬´Second Review¬ª¬ª
[Date: May 17, 2015]

Location: Next to Industry House.

This prison-themed restaurant was yet again visited on May 17, 2015 along with an old friend over casual luncheon.
For details on ambiance and North Indian Cuisine, kindly read through the first review.

This time we had opted for the Chinese Cuisine along with a few dishes from other cuisines:

-¬† Aloo Eee Atishi
Parboiled potatoes scooped out, stuffed with with a flavorful filling, deep fried and served along with thinly sliced onion. The potatoes weren't crisp and felt quite delicate. Tasted good, but, could have been better.
Mint Chutney as an accompaniment was good to taste.

- Hakka Noodles
Perfectly boiled noodles wok-tossed along with finely chopped fresh veggies. Tasted good but, was slightly oily.

- Vegetable Manchurian
The dumplings were flavorful and nicely done. Tossed into a perfectly prepared manchurian sauce, the dish tasted good.

- Italian Sizzler
The Sizzler consisted of a nicely prepared Pasta (Penne in Arrabiatta Sauce), decent Ricotta steak topped with Picante sauce, perfectly seasoned rice and saut√©ed vegetables. Topped with cheese.
The sizzler as a whole was delicious!
Recommended.

- Long Island Ice Tea (LIIT) (Cocktail)
Perfectly prepared! Enjoyed it thoroughly.

- Pina Colada (Cocktail)
Was nicely prepared and tasted good.

‚Ä¢ Peanuts and masala chips were served as accompaniments to the cocktails.

Prices are moderate with respect to the portions served, but otherwise a bit towards the higher end.
Staff was polite, prompt and had a fair knowledge about the menu.

Overall a good experience.

¬´¬´First Review¬ª¬ª
[Date: June, 2014]

Location: Next to Industry House.

This place had been on my cards since it's opening due to the hype it got in respect of the interiors. 
Finally, happened to visit this place over dinner on a family celebration. 

Aah, this place on entering is so mesmerizing. 
Is a two-level restaurant, with private dining facilities in the cells which surprisingly have call switches as well (expected so, on seeing the red lights above all cells, on enquiry was informed about switches below the table) and open dining with a satisfactory number of tables to cater bigger crowds. 

In short, 
-BOOKING HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
-Fooding was awesome in regards to the quality as well as quantity. 
-Stewards were efficient enough. 
-Pricing on the slight high. 

Detailed: 
We were 12 people, and insisted on being seated in one of the private dining areas. 
Since, the cells on the first floor were for smaller groups, we were led to the second level. 
We were comfortably seated by the staff in one the cells out there. 

Coming to the food, 

- Crispy chilli broccoli 
An absolute surprise! Had always known about babycorn and paneer, but, this combination was great as well. Broccoli was crisp and the gravy was spicy enough to compliment. 
Recommended. 

- Paneer hariyali Kebab
A mouthwatering variant of the traditional paneer tikka, which had an addition of spinach in the spice toss. Paneer cubes were succulent. Delectable.
Recommended.

- Dal makhani
Surprisingly, had a little different taste than what our taste buds recognize by the name, but, was a great dish which was perfectly cooked with the right amount cream and spices. 

- Sabji Diwani Handi 
Was simply delicious. I would suggest foodies to try it out themselves rather than me telling you about it. :-) 

- Paneer Kadhai 
Was a bit oily, but, the Paneer was tender and melted in the mouth, veggies were fresh and juicy. 

- Hyderabadi Biryani 
This was a masterpiece. Simply in love.¬† 
Recommended. 

- Tandoori Roti 
Bit of a turn off, wasn't made to choice. We had wished for the same to be soft, but were served crisp and parts being burnt. :-( 
Yes, on complaint, they were immediately changed, but I suppose this change scenario shouldn't have been in the scene. But, happy to see the responsible behavior. 

- Butter Naan 
Soft and buttery as expected.¬† (y) 

- Garlic Naan
Perfectly baked under the right temperature! Served with a slight brush of butter. 

Prices are moderate with respect to the portions served, but otherwise a bit towards the higher end. 
Staff was courteous, prompt and well-informed. 

Overall a great experience. :-) 
- Yet to try the desserts and other available cuisines, so comments on those sections remain due until next visit.

Amazing food with very innovative interiors.One cannot imagine waiters as convicts,stewards as officers and the cabins as lock-ups.One must try the sabzees like English Desi and starters like crispy chilly baby corn,soups.This sabzee is really sumptuous and an invention of this restaurant.The price is fairly charged because of the  location,interiors and premium food.

In india, theme based restaurants is an upcoming phenomenon. Kaidi kitchen is definitely a good attempt at it. It is as the name suggests based on the concept of prison with the ambience very interesting but not dingy. The service people are dressed as Qaids or prisoners. Vegetarian food is average- international cuisines is better than Indian food. To enjoy the experience definitely get the tables in the prison cell area, so book in advance.

We went to eat around 10:00 pm, so were the last group of diners by the time we left. The food was tasty, especially the Chana Masala, and also came in healthy quantity. However the most obvious downside was the lack of waiters committed to one table, and ultimately service was slow. The place's famed interior is interesting, with some details being tendered to well. Overall, a nice place to visit if you're confused where to take family/friends out for a vegetarian meal.

This is a theme restaurant on the first floor in central Kolkata. The theme, which I am not going to disclose (though you must have got an inkling by it's name itself), is a good sorted one (which is by the way much more saner than the toilet themed restaurant in Japan) riding with it a wind of freshness, but as you take the first morsel of food it, unfortunately, it  assumes a regular rhythm. 

The servers (more appropriately "jailers" ) are helpful but are stripped off of knowledge on fine dining. Since it is a multi-cuisine eatery, what to order is an onerous task. Khou suey is exceptionally delicious but other dishes are prey to the bandwagon of Indianising everything, so the food is really spicy something that could char your insides. So be wise by telling the waiter about your taste and how you would like it to be served. 

It is a good economic option for going out during weekends. One thing that bugs me is the constrained sitting space. It is so proximal that one can eavesdrop on the other table involuntary (or voluntary).

Lack of space, mediocre food quality are some points that belittle this wonderful place. But still a good choice for at least a one time visit.

This place provides the best North Indian cuisine one can have in the entire city. A solemn theme based restaurant with the look of a jail and tables arranged in a cell and the waiters dressed as jailors, a good ambience. I would have rated it 5 but the service here annoys me. Its completely disappointing.

Well..have been here loads of times.. It's quite expensive. But I still like this place.
To start off..
The ambience- it has two sides for seating. One in the jails; that's the theme. the waiters are all dressed in prisoners uniform and c managers in jailers.. Quite fun to watch prisoners serving.. And the other is normal restaurant.. Overall it's quite dimly lit.. It gives good backgrounds for photography... He he.. And when it's empty you can request for handcuffs too.. I enjoy it.

Food: that's the main part... The starters are quite good... however way too expensive.. I had ordered the Mexican sizzler.. Was OK.. Not great... Not spicy either.. Main course- yellow dal: though I am not too fond of it..yet I really liked the one served here.sabzi handi- was good too cooked in yellow gravy veggies quite well cooked..right spices .I has it plain too..paneer makhanwala- cooked in tomato gravy.. It was really creamy.. Awesome texture.. In fact the Indian food wasn't oily at all.. That was the best part... No overpowering spices... Good food...
Service- the service is decent.. Do not have to wait too long for the food.. and the food served is real hot... The waiter is well rehearsed in taking pics.. Hehe.. in fact he was suggesting us poses too.. Lol.. Nice..
Pocket pinch: 400 per head... Provided u order wisely.. The quantity is decent for 5 people.. For the Indian main course..
Con's: I guess they should put a call bell in each cell so that it's easier to call the staff and I find the place really noisy.. So maybe that should help...:):)

7th april-2015
The first thing I did today was search for the bell in the cell and it was niceeee.there is red flashlight just outside the cell. I liked it:)
Would love to tell u what u must order next time u r there. Minestrone soup was just amazing. Every flavour came out so well. Nothing overpowering. Loved it. I just finished it in few mins. I tasted tomato soup too and it was sufficely provided with cream yummy.. Mexican sizzler a must try. If u like spicy food . though its not extremely spicy. The steak and sauce are delicious. The rice I found a little overcooked and since it was a Mexican platter it lacked kidney beans. Well the main course was just delicious as well. Rajasthani kofta is a MUST try. Won't describe just have and comment. Paneer sirka pyaz was good too. Nothing great to say for roti they were well cooked. Last but not the least chocolate Monte Carlo. Nice but I felt a little more quantity would be much sweeter.desserts can make people longing for more;)

P.s. pls change your table mats or doesn't suit a restaurant of such high stature to have torn table mats .
Also the service is slow. After ringing the bell several times noone showed up . on a weekday with such low rush we expect better service.
Rest all fine :)

After almost celebrating its 2 year anniversary, I'm visiting them for the 2nd time now. The first time, i wasn't very much impressed, slightly though, blame it on the ambience. This time i was disappointed to the core & vowed not to go again or suggest someone. Firstly, no table bookings allowed. I don't have to explain how vital it is nowadays to book a table. Secondly, the place looks clumsy. More than the customers their were people representing Kaidi kitchen. How often do you see that ? Anyways, coming to the food. I'll just put it in very simple words "not worth the money spent" and the bartenders need to learn how to prepare a virgin mojito - That comes as legit. I would not recommend anyone to go unless Kaidi kitchen does a complete overhaul & value its customers. Ohh yes, not to forget the mismanaged parking facility.

nice idea of theme based restaurant..
However, the place gets too noisy. It gets suffocating. Too much things fixed in some space. The space within cell is fine bt sitting space not comfortable. Outer part too much commotion. 
Food is fine, lil overratd place. 
Taste is average, dont have consistency.

Kaidi kitchen is a new concept of theme based fine dining veg restaurant in Kolkata. This place has a long queue at any hour of the day. The ambience especially the decor of this place is simply amazing. The variety of food offered is simply vast. You can randomly order anything from the menu and u will never go wrong with it. The food is simply marvellous be it starter,main course or desserts everything is worth giving a try. 4 stars from me.

The restaurant is based on a great theme which is very rare. The ambience is very good. The service and staff are appreciable. Now coming to food,it is awesome with no extra oil and spice. Moreover the cuisine is superb. Though the pocket pinch is a bit high but the quality of the food and the service is worth it. One of the most awesome family restaurant in the city of joy. My personal advice is that if one's in the city for a while one must go there and try the food out.

Has been to here lately !!  My first experience was as soon as i entered had to wait for a very long time which is really crazy next came the food which is not at all to the standard poor in quality in spite of charging around Rs. 800 for a couple the quality standards are no where to be seen. Since it was my first time, with so many restaurants to offer much good foods in the same area I hardly will be looking forward to became a Kaidi again ....  : (

one of the most innovative themed restaurant in town. the decor goes hand in hand with theme & its name. The place is quite spacious. Now coming to food no doubt the taste & quality is maintained & cannot be questioned upon but quantity is not at all satisfying. well talking about the price, with the quantity being served its high on pocket pinch. Its surely a one time time visit is recommended.

First of all, the Zomato price categorization for this place is wrong. Cost for 2 would be about Rs. 1500, which is almost twice the zomato estimate. And this is when you order 1 starter + 2 main course dishes with breads. 

The ambience is nice. Food is decent. Nothing great. Mirchi ka salan is a good one on the menu. Beware of the dish descriptions - the cooks have changed and so the dish, when it comes, may look nothing like what was mentioned in menu.

1 glass of Chachh costs Rs. 140+ which is crazy. Mocktails are priced fine. 

The exit outside the restaurant is in a basement and is smelly, though from inside the place is neat.

Have been to this restaurant last month just wanna say the food here is way to bad to go for. The  environment for couples or for family members is worst. The quality of food served are poor and not hygenic. In spite of been a vegetarian diner the cost of food is very exaggerating high. Not a single bit of quality for the bar standards has been maintained feels like everything is messy around here. Not at all suggested for neither couples nor for family.Very unsatisfied with this restaurant and indeed felt like a KAIDI behind the bars :-(

Went there for lunch on Saturday i.e. 15/03/14. The ambience and decor are quite impressive. We ordered North Indian food which was way below our expectation given that this restaurant is ranked 1 in Zomato currently. The service and staff behavior was good. Will try Chinese and Continental next time around.

The rating given is only for the food.The food was yummy but quantity should have been increased considering the high price.When we go there we are made to wait for around 20mins uselessly.The food comes one by one in intervals of 5mins each.Worst part being the service.There was a person outside our cell ready to take away the plates as soon as someone  finished his last bite.As if they were wanting to throw us out asap.When you go for lunch that to for a friends birthday you except little peace.The service was annoying and giving the guests little privacy would have been good.Thumbs down for th service.Never going there again

Different concept, the ventilation even matches the theme of the place if you know what I mean! The food could really use some improvement, green curry was more Indian than Thai, I was expecting a little variety with the fondue with the price they're charging for it. Friendly staff makes it all worth it though!

U will be amazed by the ambience and so by the food as well.. North indian is the forte or signature cuisine where they excel in n is a must try .. Even d other cuisines are well justified.. Excellent service .. Must must visit !!

Well my wait came to an end to visit the so called BEST vegetarian restaurant in the city.
'DISAPPOINTING' yes thats the word. Am not a vegetarian, but coming from a pure vegetarian family i love vegetarian food a lot.
To start with, we were asked to wait for 30 mins which i completely understand coz there was rush, but at the same time i expect some honesty from the restaurant owners that they should mention the exact waiting time. I do realise what exactly RUSH is, but if you say 30 mins, that can be 35 not 1hr. Yes we waited for exactly 1 hr to get a table for 10.

Now comes the service :-
We ordered 5 soups (1:2) & 5 starters. The sequence was like this 1 soup then wait for 4-5 mins then another, 4-5 mins then another & so on. The last soup came when we all finished the rest.
Then came a guy who took our main course order (Note - yet to receive the starters).
The BEST part was when we received our starters with Naan. I mean how can a good restaurant can even think of doing that. Receiving the mocktails when we were about to finish our dinner was a DISASTER.

FOOD:-
The rating which i gave was only for the food.
Tomato & dhaniya ka shorba was AWESOME. Mirch ka salan was really well prepared (thick, not that oily, perfect blend of spices).
The other like daal, dum aloo, & paneer were ok.
The real disaster out here was the sizzler, request you not to call that fried rice which u serve with this sizzler a 'risotto'.
Apart from the sizzler the food was good.

It was one of those evenings in which i took my best friend's parents who came from mumbai to kolkata for the first time & we landed up here just on my recommendation.
Request you to please take care of your servicing issues very seriously because as per me, you not only serve food to your guests, you serve an experience too.
And mine was bad.

I would love to visit again, but i would request you again to pay serious attention to my issues.
As now the graph is Downward sloping.

Just returned from the entrance of this place,was stopped by the security staff who started questioning as if we were entering a private space.
We had gone to see the place and make a reservation for next day.The security staff shouted from the entrance for someone and that person screamed back asking us to wait outside till he comes.
Got put off by their behavior and left the place.
Management should look into it and have a proper person to receive the guest or they will be history.

After reading so much about this place on zomato and in the foodies circle, I had to try out this place. I am a DIE HARD non vegetarian, so the vegetarian fare has to be exceptional for me to  like it. 

Kaidi Kitchen is located behind the petrol pump on the AJC Bose Rd end of Camac Street. A little hard to find in the first go.

Once you find it, you are in for a totally different experience when it come to the ambiance. From the Main Door which has functional handcuffs as decoration to the Hand print niches on the wall to the cell like private dining area the concept is something which is a welcome relief to the city.

The staff are courteous and are even dressed up in Kaidi and Police costumes!!

Now coming to the food. 

I have read and heard about the cheese fondue so much that I couldn't not have it as starters. The cheese was just perfectly seasoned and was full of flavour and the sauciness was exemplary.
  For Rs. 601 they give an ample quantity of the fondue with croutons and veggies on the side. The sad part is, we wanted an extra plate of croutons and they charged us Rs. 101 for it. The least they can do is when your food is priced as such, you can offer a plate of croutons complimentary on the first repeat.

For the main course we ordered the "Spaghetti Agile Olio with Feta" and the Veg Thai Green Curry.
The spaghetti Aglio Olio (Rs. 391) was pretty good with a nice balance of flavours and the punch of the chilly. However, it lacked Feta.  
When we pointed it out to our order taker he first said that the 'Feta' was the Garlic Bread which came on the side!! I looked at him in disdain and he went back to check over it. He comes back and mentions that the 'Feta' has been mixed in the sauce. The dish has no sauce by rule, so I dont bother arguing back.
However, I repeat, whatever we were served tasted awesome.

The Veg Thai Green Curry.... PLEASE DO NOT ORDER IT.
It looked like mixed vegetables in a spinach gravy. Tasted nothing like what Thai Green is supposed to taste like, with not an ounce of coconut in it, in any form. RIP.

They do have Mexican and Indian fare too. My suggestion to them would be to not have so many cuisines, and just have 2 or 3 and be good at it. 

NOTE: 
*There is no Wi-Fi.
**There is Valet Parking
***Despite the steep pocket pinch they charge for packing up the food.
****Bar is only available Friday thru Sunday.

OVERALL: I may come back to this place, but just for the Cheese Fondue and the ambiance.
                     I give the food a rating of 3 and a 0.5 additional just for the ambiance

On a personal note would not want to give a second visit to this place.
> we were made to wait in a very stinky waiting area, a really really bad smelling area.
> a very limited menu which just holds fancy names.
> portions r too small according to d price charged.
> we had ordered a Mexican sizzler's  but it actually had nothing Mexican in it. How can pasta be included in a Mexican sizzler.!!
> the mock-tails only had fancy names but when tasted were terrible. We had ordered 3 from d menu but none were good. 
Sorry but very disappointed. It's just a hyped place. Have been to better vegetarian food joints in d city. N u only enjoy d ambiance if ur lucky to get a table inside d cell. Otherwise it's just a very normal place.

I went to this place for lunch.  We were a group of 5. The main attraction was obviously the theme and the decor. We choosed the table in one of those cells. The place was too comfy to feel like a jail but those cells provide privacy. The staff there generally closes the cell gate except when they come to serve. So for the most part we dint even realise the presence of people at the next tables.

We ordered Baby Corn and Paneer Tikka for starters. I really liked the Baby Corn. It had this sweet and spicy effect which was really working for the dish. Paneer Tikka was okayish.

For the main course we ordered Dal Makhani and Mixed Vegetable (which they call English Veggies) along with stuffed kulchas and laccha paratha. Everything was perfectly cooked but what I liked the most were the kulchas. The size wasn't too big or too small. It was just right. And so was the filling. The best part was that they din't feel too heavy on the stomach.

Though we dint order anything from the bar, but from the looks of it I thought it was well stocked (can be majorly mistaken).

The staff was really very friendly. The table attendants were dressed as prison inmates and their in-charges were dressed as jailors. Everyone seemed eager to serve. Apart from the table attendants, the person-in-charge also checked on us atleast 4-5 times which you don't generally find at other places. At the end of our lunch, we asked them to take a group picture and they were more than willing to do so.

I would definitely visit Kaidi Kitchen again cause of the ambience, the staff and the food (in that order) and recommend this place to everyone.

Kaidi Kitchen is a fun place to dine .... being a foodie I would not mind too much being in a prison that serves great food ;-) . Yes the non-vegetarian in me wishes that the menu had non-veg options as well but the food was quite nice and the menu had Continental and Oriental food on offer beside the Indian Section. We ordered Cream of Tomato Soup, Crispy Chilly Baby Corn and Cheese Fondue. All the starters were quite nice and we enjoyed them. For the main course we were quite stuffed so ordered Dal Makhani and Paneer Tikka with Naan. Overall pretty good food but would not say the best I have had. Did not have room for dessert so will reserve my comments on that section for another day. Decor was great ... as was the service. Valet Parking is available as well so another plus.

A Jail themed multi-cuisine restaurant with decent food is what Kaidi kitchen offers. Situated on camac street, close to the crossing heading towards AJC Bose Road. I would recommend reserving a seat inside the prison to feel like a part of the theme but it only accommodates upto six people max. 

Here's my review for the stuff we ordered:
Nachos-Nice except one of the dips had too much Garlic.
~Chinese Salad- Good but scope for improvement
~Manchow soup-Delicious and spicy
~Crispy Chilli Babycorn- it was decent but i‚Äôve tasted better. 
~Hariyali Paneer tikka- yummy, must try. 
~Hara Bhara kebab- nice , would definetely recommend. The chutney was also good. 


For Main course we had North Indian 
~Dal Makhni was good, 
~Tandoori roti was nice and light, so was the Naan.  
~veg handi could have been a lil better.
~Italian Sizzler- Good 
( I missed Romali roti on the menu) n the desserts should have more options. The service was great and commendable. Food didn't take very long so all in all was a gastronomically delightful experience!

A fun place with a concept... respect to the fact that its a pure veg place surviving in a city filled with non veg joints.... 

lets start with the decor which is concept place of prisons and they pull it off very well....

the food is a range from pretty good to average... the chinese starter we called for was average while the stuffed aloo kebab was very good...

as per the bar.. the place got bar licence only a couple of days before we visited.... the menu made by them and the items they have present are totally different which was very weird.. we called for wine...

the main course... the daal makahani was very very good... while the hyderabadi biryani was amazing... the methi matar malai was good...

a spot of warning... the food here is very very heavy... so order carefully... as for the indian food... order as you want and they wont disappoint.... cause it is very good.... 

on a feedback note we told the manager there that they need the machine to ward of insects as there were a few flies in the food zone...

over and above... i guess it was a good exp and i would be visiting again...

one of the finest restaurant in calcutta and brilliantly conceptualised in its design and decor. As the ambience attracts your eyes to its minute details in the same way food will keep your fingers/spoons/forks licking till you get another taste on your tongue. hats-off to the people who are managing such a huge crowd where 50-60 people wait for this food. Though food comes within a span of 7-8 mins. 
thumbs-up to this place.

I went there a week back with my friends.
Food is in three words - Rich, Delicious & Well Presented.
We ordered Thai noodles with tofu followed by Lasagne Verdure and lastly on the staff's suggestion we went for Mongolian Noodles.
Our first dish was just like how we wanted it- mild yet with a distinct taste of flavours and the tofu was soft and perfectly marinated.
Lasagne seemed more of an Indian version with a grnerous use of sauces.
Mongolian noodles would be suitable for anybody with a taste bud for spicy food.
For drinks we had ordered Blue Lagoon, Peach Havena and Choco Moco Delight.
All were good. Blue Lagoon has scope for improvement.

The best part of the restaurant is the menu, with illustration and information about prisons around the world.
Its a multi-cusine restaurant so thats a plus.
The service was quick and the staff was courteous, paying attention to needs of the diners.

It was a good dining experience. Looking forward to visit again purely for its richness in the variety of cuisines.

I visited on last wednesday ie; 18/12/2013 with my family & friends (around 35 people) , to my utter surprise your staff are not upto the mark.Normally if we go to a good place we expect good ambience, good staff, good service along with good food.As per me other than food nothing is good at your place.I filled up the customer satisfaction card as well over there & very clearly told the manager onduty at that time to provide me with the feedback for the same, but I am still waiting for the feed back from your side.It seems that you all only respond to the positive feedbacks not for negative feed backs.I think this should not be done with a customer who is coming to your place & spending money.

Extremely novel concept :) You are seated in a prison cell and "served" by stewards in prisoners' uniforms or waited upon by staff in police-uniform. We were asked "are you feeling scared" :D

I guess we were lucky to get a table (cell?) on a friday evening..there were long queues outside!! 

The food was delicious, do try the mexican soup! 

The portion-sizes seemed small but nevertheless a very fulfilling and enjoyable experience! :)

VERY good service and great amicable staff!

The name itself appealed to me,  though I am not a fan of veg food I wanted to go there. 
The approach to the restaurant is poor and one cannot judge the place by that. 
As you reach the entrance the drama starts, the entrance the waiters, staff everyone dresses in the kaidi theme. 
It feels like a circus going around.

There are cells in which you could be seated. 
The eexperience is awesome.
The food is value for money. And the food is really good. 
I had Indian food only but they definitely amazed me .
The paneer Rogan Josh and chana masala along with a roti ki tokri. 

There is a kitchen near the seating area area too, from where flames keep coming out at Times. 

It is a definitely must go for the vegetarians and also the people who like fun.

Starters(Paneer Tikka, Chilly Babycorn) were decent and so were the soups(Tomato). 

After that the main course along with breads were quite a let down. 

The ambiance of few tables in a prison style surrounding can be a novelty at first but if the food is not upto the mark it doesn't really matter.

With so many choices, difficult to say if I am going back here. 

Average per head comes to around 750-800.

to experience "isme different kya hai" we went to this restaurant and liked the ambience. it will be unjust , both from the customer as well as the owner's point of view, to comment on the quality of food as we had just two dishes. black daal and alu kashmiri with a basket of rotis.. dal was quiet good but alu kashmiri was as good as that is served every where else. the jailors were over zealous and kept asking for drinks./refreshments/desserts....
may be next time i might try something else and then comment.

The place was too crowded on a friday with waiting for upto an hour. I luckily booked over phone. The exterior look had nothing much for me. The interior seemed definite with prison look but deprived feel. 
The uniforms and the bell system was captivating. Food service and quality was overall good and upto the mark. The cells were small for a family of 7 but other were big. Overall satisfaction was in name of food. And it was finger licking good. Pure veg brought smile on family's face. The creme of tomato soup was excellent and so was paneer rogash.  Must visit.

I have been to this place a couple of times and it has not disappointed. It is one of the best all vegetarian dining experiences you can find in the city.

The crispy chilli broccoli is a must try. The cheese fondue is also pretty good.

I like the indian fare better here than the italian and chinese. Although i must say that the burmese khowsuey is pretty good. The dal makhani is one of the best i have tasted in the city. The breads came piping hot and crisp. The portion size is also quite substantial. 

We were too full to order dessert each time we went their. But someday i am gonna manage to try some desserts also.

It's a complete NO.
Today being my sister's b'day we decided to visit this place and believe me you the experience was loathsome.To begin with, we had to wait for an exceedingly long time in spite of having made prior reservation.After getting ourselves seated we waited for some lip smacking food.The staff though courteous took an eon to attend us.After being served some good starters we thought that it was worth the pain we had endured so far but just then the experience got worse.Every single morsel of food then onward made us repent for having come here.We ordered some dal makhani which was pretty average (though best of the lot),some subji dewani (their version of mixed veg) which was undoubtedly the worst I have had so far and some aaloo do pyaza which surpassed subji dewani in terms of its awful taste.Not to forget our Naan also had a hair strand in it and the plates were emanating a foul smell.We got our plates changed thrice but to no effect.We finally gave up.
We also got a cake to be cut after dinner  but their staff took an eternity to not only get it but also broke the news in front of my sister for whom it was meant to be a surprise.Also we had a box of custom made chocolates enclosed in the same packet as the cake but strangely enough it was missing.We were so disgusted with the entire experience thus far that we decided not to lodge any further complaint.
We came back home utterly disappointed and pledged not to pay this place a second visit.

Food Served in prison like environment that wins the heart of all Foodies.!!!

Location: 

Ahhh!!! Visited the much awaited Kaidi Kitchen was visited again located at the first floor leaving few buildings heading from fort Knox(Urban Desi) towards the main road below AJC flyover. In short, inside Usha Kiran Building. I had pre booked this place for a table and i was very well amazed at the decor and the ambience of the prison cells designed in such a way in the city of JOY. Previously, Amarna Gold Lounge was located herein. 

Description: This is a purely a Vegetarian restaurant and attracts a lot of crowd because of its decor,ambience and superb food. The place comprising of three sections:- 
1)  The outer section comprising of the Dine-in area which can accommodate a large number of crowd at a time and a bar for mocktails. 
2) The inner section also comprising of the dine-in area. 
3) Prison cells ( Private dining area)  approximately 5 of them and comprising of seating arrangement of 8-10 people at a time. 

I had visited with couple of my friends and had ordered :-

1) Burmese Khow suey 
2) Paneer Hariyali Kabab
3) Dal Makhani
4) Paneer Kadai
5) Rotiyon ka mela - comprising of all kinds of breads
6) Lasagne Verdere
7) Vodka, Redbull, Chill n Mix

1) The Burmese Khow suey had the blend of all the necessary spices, sweets and salts along with vegetables and crispy chowmien and its outstanding orange burmese garlic gravy which was an icing on the cake. It is one of my favourite dish and i would like all of you to try it. 
2) Paneer Hariyali Kabab was succulent and mouthwatering. I must say it is not to be missed because the way it was presented to us and its amazing taste won our hearts. 
3) Dal Makhani was not extraordinary. However, it wasn't bad either.
4) Paneer Kadai was superb, spicy, outstanding, yummy and delicious. 
5) Rotiyon ka Mela comprised of the breads including rajasthani special missi roti which weren't very different but were very tasty.  
6) Lasagne Verdere had a very thin layer of flour and freshly cooked vegetables inside it which was tender and lip smacking. 
7) Chill n mix was suggested to me by their steward comprising of Redbull n vodka mixed together in a can which was superb too. 

What i noticed in this place was very different from other restaurants. They had a switch button below the table  which when  pressed will blow the bulb red making it noticeable for the steward/staff to attend the table asap. Even after being so crowded, they served us in an outstanding speed which was like "INSANE" because the presentation and the food was a win-win at the same time. The chef area is open and the people can see with how much hygiene, quality and standards the food is being cooked. There was not even one dish which i did not enjoy because of their proper addition of masalas and their presentation. I felt that the dish which i was trying had been tried out many many times to get a proper and an accurate taste to it. I must say the chefs out here are brilliant and hats off to them. This place had a lot of innovative ideas be it the prison cells, be it the menu, be it the switch button, be it the table servings. I mean for the first time i am short of words to describe this place. 

Kaidi kitchen Restaurant even provide you with a valet parking. Be it the staffs, stewards or the person who do bookings outside, they were very friendly and attentive having a positive attitude which could be felt and i was left in utter surprise. The staffs were dressed up like real Kaidi's and there were inspectors too who represented security guards. 

Be it Indian, Chinese, Burmese, Thai, Italian or Mexican, you get it all out here. 

Pros and cons:- 

Pros:-
1) Insane serving speed.
2) Quality and delicious food.
3) Staffs and stewards being very positive and kind serving with a smiling face which cannot be seen elsewhere in Kolkata. 
4) Ambience.
5) PURELY VEG RESTAURANT.
6) Red button switch(explained above).
7) Servings and Presentation of the Food make it even more mouth watering. 

Cons:-
1) Music was being repeated again and again.
2) Costly affair i.e. our bill approximately came to 4k.
3) The entrance inside the building does not make you feel like you are visiting a class restaurant. However, Patience is the key. 
4) The prison cells having 8 chairs were very cramped up at first. However, they just took out the chairs for us to be comfortable in seating. 

I did not mind paying the money because i had a lovely experience with not at all any problems with respect to food or the quality of service. Below i have attached a couple of pictures depicting the sizzling hot food. Do have a watch and its my personal recommendation to all the vegetarians and non vegetarians - DO NOT miss this place. Very much satisfied. ;)

Location: Kaidi Kitchen is located on the first floor of Usha Kiran building , near fortnox. It serves only vegetarian food . As one enters the place it's ambience does create an impact they have cells just like in prison where family's can sit and relish there meal . There is also a live bar for  mocktails . 
Pros :
1) The ambience is really good and extremely innovative.
2) Wide menu to choose from they have different variety of cuisine with an Indian touch ! 
3) We had monchow soup , panner platter and a Mexican wrap for starters which was very good apart from the wrap which was average . 
4)The main course was a simple affair which dal makhni and mix vegetables which had all exotic vegetable and was a refreshing change from the usual mix vegetable . In bread we ordered tandoori roti , naan and laccha paratha all these item was good again specially the dal which was excellent . 
5) the staff are polite and well informed .
6) the place is quite pocket friendly . 

Cons : 
1) Improvement in the taste of the other cuisines apart from Indian is required. 

Kaidi kitchen lived up to my expectation . Another visit to this place is definitely on my cards. I would rate it a 4 .

Consistency is wat I can say wen I think of kaidi kitchen... These people have maintained the quality of food rite from day 1 and still is d same... Paneer melts down .. Dal makhani has improved.. I mus mention I always had complains regarding the kulchas they served for take away bt nw there has been a drastic improvement which is commendable.... Service is super awesome.. Some issues here n there could be cuz of the rush of puja's bt ya can be overlooked.. Guys I am a big big fan of this place... Must must must go !!!!

Seems these guys have taken the "jail" theme literally by "imposing" their version of "international" cuisine & trying to justify it as the way the dish is supposed to be prepared.. we left after a few spoonfuls of our 1st dish, a mexican sizzler as we couldn't bear to eat any further.. of course we paid for food we didnt eat and of course no apology was made.. i guess stick to dal rotis at this jailhouse & u shud be safe!!!

The ambience is nice. At one side there are prison cells where one can dine. The waiters are all dressed up as prisoners. As far as the food is concerned, i simply love it. Be it chinese, continental or indian, they are all delicious. Paneer tikka, kebabs, spaghetti in white sauce and pan fried noodles are my favorite. I'm sure you'll have a nice dining experience.

Kaidi Kitchen has a great location (right at Camac street, besides the petrol pump). In spite of that, it is difficult to spot from the road. Also, it is surprising to find a valet parking service over an otherwise shady looking entrance.

The restaurant management has done a good job with the choosing and implementing a theme which manages to look classy (in spite of what it is) but you get the real feeling only if you are seated in one of the ‚Äòdining prison cells‚Äô. There is a proper prison gate at the entry, waiters are also dressed in prisoner attire and you even find the red emergency lights occasionally blinking!

Fully vegetarian (a rarity in Kolkata) with many India, Oriental and Continental options. Worth applauding is the menu design, which has every alternate page devoted to a famous prison, replete with its story and picture ( had me googling about some of them at night :D). 

The Chinese was good (a bit oily though). As usual, I ordered Dal Makhani too (which I believe is the acid test to evaluate any North Indian restaurant) and was satisfied (read: not extremely elated). The menu item which I liked the most was their in-house improvisation of Jal-zeera (ughh I am forgetting its name) which we ordered twice and should be a delight for anyone looking to replace that boring old mocktail! All in all, the food won‚Äôt make you go gaga but then, the prices are also not too high so you won‚Äôt have much to complain about.

The service was fast, even at a near 100% occupancy, which leads me to make another recommendation that one should get a reservation done over phone if one wants to be sure about getting a place. Also, no booze for us prisoners! (which might turn some people down but it has been kept so to make this a family place) 

Overall, Kaidi Kitchen is definitely worth a visit or two specially if you are a veggie, a teetotaler and  appreciate a theme based eating joints!

A good concept,however what is disappointing is that there are only a few "jail" tables to sit in to admire the concept .However the food isnt too bad after all.The idian particulary is very good.The paneer was good.If only the portions of their servings were enough to feed our gang of hungry friends!However all in all a decent experience.

Very good and fast service, very courteous staff but average food. Entrance through car parking gives a first bad impression. Prison theme is something new but personally I didn't find it exciting at all. Dal Makhni and Sabji Diwani Handi were very delicious. Though the Menu has lot to offer, they should add more options to Indian Starters.

Would definitely like to mention that though Zomato suggests for table reservation but unfortunately Kaidi Kitchen doesn't accept reservation on weekends which is very illogical. I don't think during weekdays getting a table on arrival would be a problem here in any case.

This was my second visit to kaidi kitchen restaurant located on camac street usha kiran building, my first visit was on a weekday dinner but this time my family decided to go on a sunday which i was against becoz i heard that on sunday if you are goin to kaidi kitchen u have to wait for about 1.5 hrs as we entered it was raining cats and dogs but we found good valet service when we went there we found huge number of people waiting i thought of returning back but when we went to reception we were happy to knw that they have expanded it to above 2nd floor now they have restaurant on 1st as well as 2nd floor. Finally after waiting for approx 30 mins we got a place as we sat down we found the staff as polite as before we ordered for our favourite litti choka and then indian food, we have ordered for pista badam kofta,paneer rogan josh and dal makhani and in breads we ordered cheese naan which was yum and tandoori roti. Pista badam kofta was out of the world paneer rogan was a bit spicy and oily but the taste was very good overall the foood us very goood and as well as the staff. A good news for the food lovers that u dont have to wait much from now but the only problem is the entrance whic they need to change ... Overall a must visit!!!!!

Kaidi kitchen- Being a hardcore Non vegetarian it was a little difficult for me to go to a vegetarian restaurant. But i would say, i was pleasantly surprised.  

FOOD: We thought of trying something different apart from the same usual Indian food. I loved the pan fried chow min....the chow min was a little fried and it had a gravy with lots of veggies which is usually not served everywhere.  Though the veggies should have been cooked a little more. The quantity of Thai green curry was really good and it too tasted good.

AMBIANCE & SERVICE:  Though families can enjoy their dinner experience inside a cell/prison with waiters dressed as prisoners serving them, but it is a little hyped . he waiters were very polite and courteous. Service was fast. The only demerit the restaurant has in terms of ambiance is the entrance. A clumsy entrance leading to the restaurant spoils the rating a lot.


Price: A meal for two would cost somewhere between Rs 700-800. Expensive Veggie Food!

Appreciate the new jail theme concept, Expensive veggie food! Would only recommend for a single visit if u want to enjoy the theme of the restaurant.

I visited Kaidi Kitchen almost a month back, after a set of glowing reviews from  my group of friends. They told me I was in for a surprise, and I am always up for one! Well, the decor of the place did really surprise me. Its really innovative to make a restaurant set-up in-between a prison facility, where your servers and managers are dresses in those filmy prison and warden costumes. It is a welcome change from  the normal, conventional restaurants, and yes, a thumbs-up for the ambience.
The food, though me being a pure vegetarian, was really on the okayish side, maybe even a notch lesser than what you would expect of such a restaurant. Ambience was pleasant, but the service was very slow. It is one of the few joints in Kolkata, that serve Mongolian food, a personal favourite, and I really appreciate them for doing something not so prevalent. All in all, the wacky decor makes the mediocre food way more interesting. Good job!

An awful end for a nearly perfect evening !!! 
I visited this place on 6th August to celebrate my Wife's B'day..
Had heard a gr8 deal about the place as the concept and ambience are totally new.
Since it was raining so I decided to use the valet service (my biggest mistake). The parking of the building housing the restaurant is not even worth calling a parking.. Low height and no turning space and no parking space for sure.. 
I handed over the keys and moved upstair for dinner. The Ambience, food, service everything was just perfect. 
And we had a truly amazing time.
As we reached down for my car (scorpio with a carrier) it was raining and we waited for the valet to get it.. My car came and while trying to turn it the driver rammed it in the low height overbeam of the parking. And then I noticed the back part of the carrier was also damaged which must have happened while he was taking my car out for parking. But the management and the entire valet staff refused to acknowledge the same. I showed them the marks on the overhead beam( identical to the fresh marks created in front of me) where the vehicle must've crashed earlier but no sense of guilt or acknowledgement from the entire team. 
What a pathetic end to a wonderful evening !!!
Caution: People with SUVs should park their vehicle outside only and not try to use valet service.

so Saturday night dinner with family was kaidi kitchen this time..10 0f us veggies including my grandparents who don't have onion garlic also.as we walk up the crowded stairs, it actually feels like gallows.we ordered paneer afghani tikka which was superlative.cheese fondue was served with croutons and assorted olives babycorns and mushrooms...good portion size...but the best starter was thai corn fritters. 
main course was veg canneloni...which I found quite average coz had ordered without onion garlic.found the spinach bitter.assorted breads like cheese naan and masala kulcha and lachcha paratha was ordered. lachcha paratha wasnt as yummy as zaranj but cheese naan was delicious.we ordered pista badaam kofta which was slightly on the sweeter side and paneer in onion gravy was v well made.kali daal needs improvemment. .
staff courteous...seating cramped up.though we did not get the cells to sit in..

on the whole I would give it 3.5 stars..would like to come again to order non indian fare in a smaller more experimental group..for 10 people it costed us 4700 without any soft drinks which looks decently priced.all the best.

Kaidi Kitchen is a real delight for the vegetarians as it serves only vegetarian food. 

Pros:
1. The ambience is really innovative. It consists of prison cells in which you will be locked and the staff are dressed as prison inmates.

2. The quantity of food is really good and reduces your per head costs instead of higher rates.

3. The speed of service is quite good and the staff is quite polite and friendly and serves with smile .

4. The menu consists of a wide variety of dishes with Indian taste.

Cons:
1. The entrance is through a parking lot which is a bit awkward.

2. Lack of variety in other cuisines.

Overall Kaidi kitchen lived upto my expectation and i would like to go back again.

went for lunch at kaidi kitchen . The feel of the place was good, the staff very courteous. They recommended the mocktail of watermelon which had a soothing taste. The Panner tikka was very tasty. The steward was helpful in choosing the dish. We ordered  Cannelonni Florentine which was good except that the salt was on a little higher side. The portion served was sufficient for the two of us and we did not have to order any other dish. We were seated in the cell but there was a lot of noise because of kitty party going on at the next table.The lighting was very dim and we had to strain the eyes to read the menu and the bill. Overall a good place for the vegetarians and we shall definitely visit again

On my Birthday when we got put behind bars! ;)
The first thing that struck me when I first heard about this place from a friend was the very catchy name, "Kaidi Kitchen". I was so intrigued by the name and went to try it out on my birthday. On entering we were welcomed by extremely polite and courteous staff and I got an instantly positive vibe about the place. The decor was extremely interesting and loved the entire jail theme.. the bars.. the waiters dressed as jail inmates.. we even got locked up inside the jail cell after being served!
Coming to the food.. I was astounded by the high prices and would recommend that you go to this place only if someone else is footing the bill! We went on to order the starter which basically stuffed potato but had a very fancy name.. was good but not great.. then went on to order a punjabi kofta, kaali dal, kulchha, naan, and tandoori roti. The roti was rubbery and we almost had to wrestle with it to break it apart! The taste of the kofta and Kaali dal was bland and could had done with more spice. All in all did not find value for money in what was served. I would definitely not be visiting it again anytime soon unless I hear of some drastic improvements in the kind of food they serve!

The worst veg food that i have eaten till date... the dal makhani well i could sniff the makhan... its not like the ones i have at ludhiana... the paneer stuff into the aloo was terrible, cant imagine how people can pallet  such crap veg food and give it such a high rating... i think zomato needs to check it out there is something wrong about your rating system as there are so many less than 2.0 ratings and still this lousy restaurant featured in the top 25 seems zomato is doctering the ratings for kaldi kitchen... the restaurant details are misleading they have mentioned credit card facilty available but honestly speaking the credit card machine did not work putting customers in big soup. The food is over priced for sure... there are many better restaurants that serve better veg food than this dump. 

Simply would never recommend this crappy restaurant to anyone...

I went with my boyfriend to this restaurant since we both were feeling grubby after a seminar that we went for at British Council which is just opposite the road. the get up had no theme at all... there is more staff than people in the restaurant.No wonder the price of all the items is all spruced up. Neither was the lift to the restaurant working. I fsimply hate restros situated on the first  floor it kinds of puts me off. 

The entrance to the restro was looking like the runaway of the n.s.c.bose airport... service staff is terrible, I asked the waiter to give me a glass of chilled water and he brings me a bottle of mineral water. You as for the check and want to pay by card and the waiter tells u sorry madame the card machine is not working, this just puts u in an embarrassing situation, who the hell these days carries cash in their wallets, its the age of the plastic money therefore if the lousy restaurant have swipe card machine which is not working the authorities should jolly well get the damn thing fixed up. 

The waiters at the restaurant were sizing me up and down and starring at my cloths, and i was really feeling uncomfortable and i told my bf about this matter, the management should do something about this over above i see the place is not managed properly poor management!

the most horrifying experience for a foodie is when u have a restaurant which is vegetarian. although the ambience was good, the service staff per polite but were definitely not trained how to serve food and they have a great open kitchen but yet i have rated it as one and promise never to visit again. i had ordered some take away food and thought i would pay by card but lo and behold i found a notice that said since there is problem with the swipe machine hence credit cards are not acceptable, more so the notice was placed in such a place that u literally have to crane ur neck to see it, i just felt that the waiter could have easily told me that there is a problem with the credit card this thereby put me in a spot of bother because i was not carrying enough cash. secondly the reason for my poor rating is that the take away food was pethetic considering the high rating of zomato it does not deserve to be #4 on the list of 25 prominent restaurants in kol city. never recommending it to non veg foodies for sure nor would.

Going by the reviews, I decided to visit this restro last weekend, only to be disappointed by the poor service and excessive noise inside the place. The ambiance looked good initially, however the effect faded once we sat down. The food was not up to the mark and the waiters were not courteous enough. Overpriced food and slow service added to the woes. Definitely, Kolkata has better options for a veg restro. I would think thrice before revisiting this place.

For us vegetarians, it is an absolute delight!

The food quality and quantity - both - are amazing and apt for connoisseurs! The cost per head is extremely reasonable and worth the size of each platter they serve!

The ambience is the plus point! The atmosphere of a prison and prison guards and prisoners welcoming you with a smile is highly intimidating initially but the courteous and friendly nature of each and every employee will make you feel extremely comfortable!

On a whole, it is EXCELLENT!

Went there again today on 17th May '15 for lunch and i now know why the restaurant was almost vacant on a sunday. 

Food quality has dropped like anything. Rather poor experience with the food. Only Thai curry was ok. 
Dal was v bad. Breads were abominable as well. Other curries - avge. 
The rates of breads are almost as much as that of a 5 star but the quality of breads is like that of a roadside stall. 

And to add,  they also charge service charge @10%

Strong recommendation :  do not go

The zomato page doesn't lie when it says, "Table Reservation: Recommended" for Kaidi Kitchen, especially on weekends. On a personal level, I was completely overawed on the outset but that was mainly due to nostalgia, as my dad used to have an office on the second floor of the Usha Kiran building; Kaidi Kitchen's cropped up on the first floor where Bharat Overseas Bank used to be.
Anyway, the first thing I liked is that they have valet parking, which becomes extremely vital due to lack of parking space in both Camac Street & within the building. Secondly, we didn't have to wait long for a table even though we went on a Friday night (At least 30 minutes waiting time on Sundays). The staff was extremely welcoming, with bright smiles on their faces showing no signs of coercion! The ambience: wait... (takes a deep breath) is absolutely PHENOMENAL!! I've not seen anything like it in Calcutta... The concept of having convicts (fictional) serve food inside a cell & the jailer taking our food order was a delightful experience altogether. The interiors have been worked on a lot to give you a mystical feeling and the lighting is blissfully dim.
Coming to the foooood... We only had Indian food with crispy chilli babycorn for starters. It wasn't phenomenal, but quite good. What made me inadvertently lick my fingers all throughout dinner was the delectable Paneer Bara Masala & the Paneer Roghan Josh... We also ordered Sabz e handi which was good, but again not as delectable as the Paneer dishes. Their breads were soft & curries were served in quite good quantities. My nephew accidentally dropped his fork & believe you me a prisoner picked it up in a jiffy although he was nowhere to be seen pre or post happening! Unbelievable! I'm not exaggerating either!

To sum it up, they provide amazing food with amazing service. I'm planning to visit this place once again. this time with my friends, to try their Italian & Mexican offerings. Recommended, with all my heart....

This place is pretty nice and you may visit it if you like. This one is located in Camac Street. Here you get a variety of food of various cuisines. The taste is quite nice and majority of people I feel will like it. The ambience is well done and quite stylish. 
The staff are well behaved and cheerful. The North Indian section is the best and you should definitely try it.
Overall I enjoyed my meal and will rate it 3.5 which means the place is slightly above average. The pricing is also quite reasonable so that too isn't a real issue.

I feel the place is extremely over rated! The staff absolutely SUCKS! 
We asked them thrice to INCREASE the temperature, but the staff came and explained, " temperature increase Karne se thand badhega.." and nothing was done! However, we left early ditching desserts, because it was just too much for us to take! We were freezing -_-

While serving starters, since we had ordered 3 of them, we asked the waiter to give us dinner plates, but he refused.. Rather saying "plate toh hai hi" and we were not given the plates until the main course arrived.

Coming to the food- yes it's good, but the waiters are rude and ill mannered and I won't ever like going back to this place.

Kaidi kitchen staff sucks, especially the greeter. First time in my life I walked out of the restaurant without eating at. If you go in a small group, say two, they keep you on hold un-necessarily and let group of three or four dine before you, even if you're ahead. If you try to rush them even after waiting for double the proposed time, they give lame excuses and say that they're letting you into a cell for four, as if it's a favor? Bollocks!!
These people seem to be very insulting and full of arrogance. Having dined at three out of top ten restaurants of the world, where the food served is bang-in, I've never experienced such a disdainful and contemptuous behavior.
Anybody else who has experienced such a bad hospitality? Feel free to write criticisms and spread the word.

The most amazing thing about the place is the decor, it's something different than the rest of restaurants in Kolkata. 

The food is good, nothing great, there are places that serve better food for the price, but I feel that they are also charging for the experience. 

The white dal is great, the broccoli is good and so are the enchiladas. All in all a good experience. 

The only thing that I don't like about this places that they don't accept a prior reservation.

When it comes to good food, Calcuttans are spoilt for choice and this newly launched pure vegetarian gastronomic institution - known as 'Kaidi Kitchen' is surely going to leave you with one question in  your mind i.e. why doesn't this place have some Michelin stars?

Abiding by its name, the restaurant has come up with some creative ways of presenting it with the aim of capturing the spirit of a 'cellular jail', found in India which awakens curiosity and hence provides for an interesting dining experience. The menu marries traditional and Contemporary Indian cuisine with exotic world cuisines such as Chinese, Mexican, Thai, Mongolian, Italian etc. and is a good value for money.

The staffs are prompt and are bound to bring a smile to your face by the means of their attire which is of a traditional inhabitant of a cellular jail if you happen to dine in any one of their seven cellular in private dining cells. One must try the Z soup and the Burmese Khowswey along with other delicacies. Every single thing that had hit my palate was remarkable. 

The chefs have tried to make spice meet real life which sends you on a different level of great gastronomic adventure of seasonings, flavors and aromas which I believe they have justifiably been able to attain so amidst an elegant setup. 

Cheers to good food and Kaidi Kitchen

Kaidi Kitchen: This is one place that starts to intrigue you the moment you enter it. Set on a rarest theme of a jail, the food here is outstanding as well. The theme indeed is a little "hatke" and so is the food. We've all heard people saying that vegetarians have limited options when it comes to eating, this place just proves 'em wrong. Yes, you are spoilt with options: Thai, Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Indian cuisines, etc. You name it, they have it.

They have something for everyone: From Litti Chokha to Burmese Khow-suey, you can't help but savour every bite of the dishes served. This is one place where you'll find all the varieties you can possibly think of. The mocktails are also something you can't give a miss.

Quite evidently, the food is so awesome that I forgot to talk about the hospitality here. The stewards (dressed in prisoner's attire) are courteous and the prompt service is a plus!

This is one place which starts from being on someone's wishlist and ends up as a regular in no time. It's a paradise for all the veggies out there. Enough said. Feeling hungry already! :D

Kaidi Kitchen located inside Usha Kiran building on Camac Street was on my wishlist for some time. The entrance is a little awkward through the parking lot. The ambiance is good and although we could not get one of the cells, I was satisfied with the ambiance of the place and the  jail based theme of the place is something new to our city which gives it marks for innovation.
We only had Indian lunch at the place as we had plans elsewhere after this place. 

Our lunch consisted of Dal Makhani and Paneer Rogan Josh. The breads were Veg Stuffed Naan, Masala Kulcha and Lachcha paratha. Both the veggies were very tasty and different in taste from other places. Among the breads, Veg Stuffed naan was very good and Kulcha was decent. The Lachcha Paratha was ok types. 

The stewards were very helpful and served with a smile. The service was good and quick. Its prices are on the higher side compared to park street restaurants but they are reasonable. Overall a good experience, would visit again. 4 stars for Kaidi Kitchen.

This is a good place to visit for the experience. Its fun to eat inside of a jail and with the staff in their police uniforms.The staff is nice and service is average. The food here was a let down. We ordered for a virgin mojito that was made well. For the starters we had crispy chilly broccoli that was pretty good. The main course we had a thai green curry noddle and a spaghetti arrabeita which was a let down. They did not taste well enuf. Cudn finish the dish. I gave up on it. The price for each dish is not worth paying for a veg dish. It would be nice if they would have non veg dishes too. The dessert is not that bad. I enjoyed it.

Kaidi Kitchen. It is located in Usha Kiran Building next to Industry House in Camac Street.
It's the same place where Amarna Gold Lounge used to be. First of all, great concept!
The private dining rooms are designed like a cells in the prison and the waiters and the stewards are dressed like the prisoners and prison-keepers. The ambiance is quite nice, if only the entrance was a bit better (especially the lift one). The seating is comfortable too. We fortunately got the prison cell to sit in, considering it was packed (as it was a Saturday night), in which we were taken hand-cuffed. Haha :D
In spite of that, the service was very quick. Thumbs up for that. 
Coming to the food, it's pure vegetarian with diverse menu ranging from North Indian to Italian, Mexican, Chinese, Thai, Burmese and many more. Super!
We ordered Mexican Lasagna, Nasi Goreng Rice, Four Cheese Ante Paste in Arabia Sauce, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Litti Chokha among International main course and starters and a Burmese Khowsuey. All were good except the Litti Chokha which they claim to be their speciality. In the Indian main course, we ordered Dal Makhani, a paneer dish, naans and a Hyderabadi Biryani which was too good.
The prices are quite moderate and would set you back by around 700 per person.
All in all, it's a good place.
Three and a half stars from me :)

Nicely conceptualized by the owner, the waiters dressed like the prisoners and serving you while you are sitting inside the cell waiting for your food. Celebrated my birthday there with all my family members and it was really awesome. As the day was the 1st day of the year so it was totally crowded but still they managed very well, hats off to their management. 
1st of all, they provided a complimentary cake for celebrating my birthday which was very generous on their part. Then we ordered our food which was served on time and the manager as well as the waiters were serving with the attitude of "Ready to serve you" (but sometimes it happened as if they were trying to be extra caring).
Coming to the food, the appetizers were really palatable. We ordered some sizzler (don't remember the exact name) and some paneer tikka stuff, and something else. The sizzler was scrumptious while the others were also good.Coming to the main course we ordered one paneer curry, one dal and one veg curry(again forgot the name) while for the roti we ordered the basket (which contained one missi roti, one naan, one tandoori, one lachha paratha, and one more) which was really economical as well as amazing.
As we were totally full with this only so did not get a chance to order the desserts but will surely go again to that place and this time will try out the desserts too.
Overall. an amazing place with perfect combination of service and taste.

Service :-4/5
Food/Taste :- 4/5

Finally ... a theme restaurant that takes the theme seriously .... 

to being with... the place is beautifully decorated... the decor is kept dim and love the tiles with a bit a grass peeling through the crevices.. for fortunate to get a prizon cell alcove for the seating in spite of a super busy service. 

the decor was spot on .. we were made to seat in a cell... the stewards were dess as inmates... and we  here handcuffed as well.... awesome ... 

the menu has a vast range.... indian... chinese.... thai... mexican .... something for every taste bud ... 

our order was as follows 

butter milk 
mexican corn soup 
crispy chili broccoli 
masala papad
paneer afghani tikka 
mirch ka salan 
daal makhani 
bread basket
kabuli naan 
kulfi .

all the food was good.... the soup was remarkable and the broccoli was nice too... the salan was not authentic but none the less it was delicious .... 

only thing we didnt like was the kulfi.... the portion size was ample... but it was very floury.... 

in spite of a full house .... the service was fast... and the staff was very warm and tended to our tantrums of photographing antics.... very very impressive 

over all a must visit over and over again.... :) 

Kudos ...

My experience with Kaidi Kitchen was one that was utterly gratifying and pleasing. While the concept of a prison, the unusual yet exciting ambience is good enough to shell out brownie points to this place, the food served is the real deal. Mouth watering and divine! Loved it. It only helps that they have an excellent service as well. Really warm and attentive waiters. 

Kudos Kaidi Kitchen! Highly recommended!

Kaidi Kitchen..a newly opened restaurant in the heart of the city Camac Street, serves amazing food at a very reasonable price. and what more? it is pure vegetarian which is like a  boon for this city which is starved of good vegetarian joints. A family rest. wid a very good ambience plus good food. A must visit with the entire family.

poor service
the waiters and manager dont know the menu itself
ordered for a mexican corn soup and the manager got me a tomato soup with some corn in it
the menu is good but its only good in the menu card
when they serve it to u its a disaster.
I ordered 5 dishes and all of them had some problem
i ordered for a 4 cheese pasta and instead of 4 types of cheese I got 4 types of pasta in it.

Think twice b4 u go there. 
it justifies its name... u feel like a true kaidi stuck in there once ur food gets delivered.
