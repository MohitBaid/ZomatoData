I don't know how this restaurant is rated so low. The only reason I was reluctant to visit this outlet in such an iconic location was the rating. Finally we decided to go with guys and am so happy cause I was thoroughly satisfied. With a beautiful view on top of the Star Theatre and a vast outdoor seating arrangements it looks beautiful after dark. There's even a small indoor seating arrangement. Staff are little unprofessional though but are very helpful. We tried some light food items and it tasted super good. Quantity is so satisfactory and taste is good. Service is relatively quick. There's no additional tax charges and as per the price is concerned the food they offer is a great surprise. I would recommend everyone not to look at the ratings and do give it a try. You may thank me later.

This restaurant is situated at the top floor of star theater. This restaurant has a roof top open seating arrangement as well as a in house dining space.
This was my first time visit to this place. I ordered
üçó Chicken drumsticks
üçú Mixed Szechuan noodles
ü•ò Sweet and sour chicken

üçóChicken drumsticks were really nice. Especially the sauce it was cooked in. It had the right amount of spices, the chicken was nicely cooked, the meat was tender. I enjoyed it a lot.

üçúMixed szechuan noodle had a great quantity. It was tasty and 2 people can easily share this dish.

ü•òSweet and sour chicken was a show stealer. I didn't have much expectation from this dish but it blew me away. Although the quantity does not justify the price of this particular item as it has way too much bell peppers in it which clearly can be cut down by a considerable amount. But taste wise this dish was a stand out.

The service was quite nice, and the waiters give very genuine suggestions which I liked a lot.overall ambiance was quite nice. It's a good restaurant if you like Chinese food. Do give it a try

Situated on terrace of Star Theatre building in Hatibagan. Two sections are there outside seating and indoor. We prefer to sit inside but the ac was not working properly . On informing the same the staffs tried their best to keep the ac work and after a while it started working. A great relief. Nothing much to say about interior 'cause it is very basic. Coming to food we ordered 2 items in starters and in main mixed hakka noodles with chicken gravy side dish. I forgot the names but can't complain as such about the taste. I like the starters better than main. Noodles were okayish but rest of the items were good. And price is extremely pocket friendly. Overall a nice experience. Debanjana Raha Sananda Sur Ghosh

Ordered food through Swiggy, hence cant provide review upon ambiance.

I had chosen less fried food and it was upto my expectations. Food was not at all over oily. Soup was too good. Chowmein was good. Only problem was with lemon fish, as I did not expect it to be that sweet. But it was good I will definitely order once more from here

Despite situating at a prime location like star theatre, hati bagan...this place failed to impress. Lazy stuffs, mediocre food, overall bad management and service. Nothing to elaborate about the food, still regretting my visit.

Newly opened near Star Theatre.We went there on Dashami afternoon for lunch.We ordered Chicken Soup,Crispy Babycorn,Mixed Rice and Chicken Manchurian. The soup n the starter was tasty but the main course was a let down. The staffs are not so efficient but try to provide good service. The quantity of food was good enough. Taste can be improved.

We went here during Durga puja,it was saptami and we were extremely hungry after lots of pandal hopping in North Kolkata and finding restraunts everywhere,we went to every possible place but as usual the que for food was too long then this place was our last hope nd luckily we got less crowd here.
The management for crowd was very good..they arranged a special place for waiting.
They have two portions one's ac another non ac both are good.decor was simple yet fine.
One thing I have to mention is that everything was priced 50-60 rupees more than listed in Zomato.
We ordered chicken fried rice and chicken Manchurian.Most of the restraunts fall down in their quality but here they served us quite good Chinese food,rice was properly cooked, quantity is decent and chicken Manchurian was awesome.Pocket pinch is medium.Chinese lovers can give it a try
