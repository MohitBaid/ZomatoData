Average Thai food compared to other Thai cuisine restaurants in Kolkata. 
The decor leaves a lasting impression though. 
Tried their green curry and sushi. Nothing extraordinary about it. Sticky rice was woeful.

A small simple restaurant with good food and bad service. 

I have wanted to visit the restaurant since it opened a couple of years ago and finally went there on Saturday night. The place was full but thankfully we had a reservation.


We ordered - 

Glass noodle salad - Good.yummy! (+1)

Tofu satay- tasteless, chunks of semi - hard tofu with a dipping sauce. Don‚Äôt order!

Sushi - we tried 4 types, both maki and nigiri and they were all great. (+2) 

Pad Thai - decent! (+1) 

Water Chestnuts with veggies in a gravy- this is a seasonal dish, recommended by a staff. It was different with strong soy flavoured curry and lots of vegetables. (+2) 

Unfortunately, we weren‚Äôt served anything until we asked for it. This also includes not serving water for at least 20 minutes after being seated. And then, the water served was dirty. (-1) 

The entire restaurant smells of the food being cooked and also makes you cough. (-1) 

There are a few cockroaches enjoying the meal around you. Sucks! (-1) 

And, dinner will easily take you about two hours without dessert. (-1) 

The bill is around 900 person with taxes, which is not high for a sushi dinner (+1/2). 
I am not visiting The Sushi Oke soon.

This small cozy place is tucked away in a location near the back gate of St. Xavier's college. Not a very flashy looking place, but serves decent food at slightly expensive prices.

Sushi tasted good enough. We had taken a maki sushi(California roll), and nigiri sushi (salmon). We had also ordered bok choi chicken, udon noodles. The portions may not be sufficient for 2 persons, however.

The only complaint regarding this place is about their service, which isn't really up to the mark. We have been to this place on two occasions, but there hasn't been a remarkable change in service during the period.

Ordered a portion of the glass noodle salad - it was bland. It tastes like the filling of a rice paper wrap. It was not spicy and didn't have any taste like glass noodle salad does. Also. THEY CHARGED 300 RUPEES AND THE PORTION WAS SUCH THAT EVEN A MOUSE COULDN'T FILL HER STOMACH. Never ordering again !

But don't under estimate as it serves decent sushi service is nice.

Just recommend them to improve their quality of wasabi

Finally visited this place was planning from a long time... At first this place is little small with their sitting arrangements as depicted in zomato ‚òπbut the food is worth and tasty..üòÅ
We ordered for:
1) Chicken satay,
2) Bokchoy with chicken and
3) Sticky fried rice with chicken.
Which costed me 1500/- approax.
Also it took a little while for my order to be on my table may be because of the timing i went it was around 2:30 i guess. But still i feel it could have been served little earlier.
At last though this place is little expensive for my pocket and little less with quantity, but guys it was a worth experience visiting here, the quality of food is really good with colour, presentation and taste.
I beleive all gud things comes with a premium with themselves so does the same goes for this place as they are serving a different cuisine simultaneously maintaning the ambience of their restaurants theme..
For the videographic review of this place check out my YT channel as "Traveller Piu".

We ordered 3 plates of sushi. 
Basil vegetables and a plate of STICKY fried rice. 
The rest of the food was pretty satisfactory, but the rice was not "sticky" rice. 
It was regular white rice that is used for generic cooking. 
Really disappointing that they assumed it would be ok to send something completely different from what has been ordered.

Visited this place only for their wide range of sushis.
Located near the Xavier's back gate is this tiny restaurant.
We ordered
1) NIGIRI SUSHI ( The chicken and avocado rolls) and
2) MAKI SUSHI ( Smoked salmon one).
Though the food was good, but didn't like the hospitality..
Firstly the AC was not working properly, it was very hot inside..
And then, when we came inside, we were not even served water.
The place is small and can be suffocating with the smoke coming out of the kitchen.
But the sushi were good.
Not quite sure of a second visit.

We went in a group of five and decided to try all the non-veg nigiri and maaki sushi they had to offer. Since it was my first and only sushi experience till date, it would be foolish of me to compare the food with anything. I liked what I had, it was a completely new experience, but to be honest, the size of the rolls let us down. The value for money is the only reason keeping me from rating it a 4 or may be even 4.5.

A small place in a corner very close to St. Xavier's College, The Sushi Oke is a hard to notice.
The place gives the feel of a Japanese household with dim lightings, photo frames, the wallpaper of Sakura...
Having tried the cuisine for the first time...found it pretty good.The Thai food is appreciable too.

Food:
Smoked salmon maki sushi 3/5 (The sushi size could have been bigger)
Chicken yakitori 5/5
Phad thai noodles with chicken 4/5
Vietnamese glass noodles with chicken 4/5 (The two tasted the same to me..the other one being flat noodles)

Service: 3.5/5
They don't serve water until asked. No washroom. The cooling service needs a lot improvement.
A .5 for they were polite enough to help us with the details about the food and ingredients.

Price: 4/5
Reasonable as compared to any other restaurant serving Japanese. The quantity needs an increase (Thai was an enough for two though)

Overall, a worthy visit.

Had sushi after a long time, Sushi Oke is a good play to try out sushi, they have a good variety at a good price point, we had crab and avocado maki sushi, and Thai burnt ginger fried rice and forgot the chicken dish name we had but it was a Japanese dish, 
Restaurant ambiance: 4/5 (Traditional Japanese style)
Food Quality: 4/5
Food Quantity: 2/5 (for the price tag we expected more.
Wifi: NO
Parking: NO
Cards Accepted: NO (at least we could not pay by card luckily we had cash)
Over all experience: 3/5
Food quality and ambiance is what we liked bust rest is all not up to our experience, if you want to experience sushi good place to start with.

It was pretty bad . I never had sushi before and i thought why not try it . So i went over google and searched sushi places and this place named "The Sushi oke" came up . I saw the reviews which were moderately good and so i thought of trying it . 

Worst decision ever.

First of all the ambiance was nit that good
So we settled in and ordered 2 plates of maki sushi , 2 plates of nigiri sushi , a bowl of chicken sticky fried rice , a chicken udon noodles and a chicken soba noodles.

First came the maki sushi and the rice tasted rancid . So did the nigiri sushi . My brother almost vomited . Then came the chicken sticky fried rice . It was eatable . We cleared the whole bowl. Then after about 30mins came the two noodles aka. the worst noodles I've ever tasted . The noodles couldn't be distinguished . The soup was bland , had a weird sweet taste to it . It had boiled vegetables and boiled chicken . All tasted bland .We couldn't really drink the soup. It was so bad . We somehow managed to slurp the bland noodles and went home . 
The wasabi was bad . The kimchi was overly garlicky . And the soya sauce was weirdly sweet and had kinda a rancid aftertaste to it . 

And the total bill came to around Rs.2600 .

Worst way to spend money .

Don't be deceived by the pictures . They might look good but they aren't . They really aren't .

I don't know whether it's just me but i would not recommend this to anyone

Its hard to find a good Japanese restaurant in the streets of Kolkata find this restaurant by one of my friend's suggestion.
Had sushi basically Maki sushi and nigiri with salmon and prawn. The plating was good and the food was great as well. Miso soup was average not like those Sushis. Seats and entire ambience were tried to give a touch of Japanese sushi bar which I liked. Recommended for those who doesnt have any issue with raw fish.

My love for Japanese food, specially Sushis started around the time when I was living in London and used to gorge on various Nigiris and Maaki Roll platters daily for lunch. Now back ¬†in India, I am currently I am on a Sushi Trail...‚Äì in search of the best Sushi Bar in Kolkata.¬†

Find of this week ‚Äì Sushi Oke.¬†

Hidden away in a corner on the usually bustling Short Street, just opposite St. Xaviers College, its easy to miss this small and cute little Sushi bar.¬†

We tried Salmon Nigiris which were tasty enough, with the Salmon perfectly cured and fresh. We also ordered a plate of Boston Maki Rolls with Salmon, CrabMeat and Scallions stuffing inside, which were great too.

Japanese cuisine is a huge favorite, always has been even when I lived in New York city.  After a painful dental visit I felt like having sushi which is a comfort zone. This was the first time I went to Sushi Oke. A cute and cozy hangout. I decided to take away. A gentleman named Amitabh was extremely helpful and courteous. Came across as a genuine host who helped me recommend the right dishes knowing I had a tooth ache. The Boston rolls and prawn rolls were out of the world! The food from Sushi Oke was a silver lining to my day with "teething trouble"! Each bite was heaven. Compared to Fuji it was lighter on the picket with no compromise in taste. 
My Feedback would be to have zomato remove card as a mode of payment as they only accept cash. I wish Sushi Oke all the best and hope they grow across the city.

Being a big fan of Japanese cuisine, especially in, my friend and I just had to visit this restaurant place. This restaurant was in my bucket list for quite a long time. I read and gathered a lot of reviews from my friends, both negative and positive so we decided to give this place a visit. When we arrived, it was totally empty. We were the first customers there. The place was also very small with about 4 tables. It has low ceiling and the wallpaper had cherry blossoms  ( Sakura ) on it. The door to the kitchen was that of Japanese style.  The service was quite good and prompt. We ordered for mushroom roll, smoked salmon roll, and tuna nigiri. Along with that, we ordered for Japanese sticky rice with prawn, and Vietnamese glass noodles with chicken. What disappointed me the most was the size of the sushi they serve. Being only four in numbers, it was very small. They should have made it a bit bigger. The sticky rice wasn't that sticky actually. However, the taste was good. It was expensive if you take the size of the sushi in consideration. Everything we ordered came to around rs1800. But it was a bit cheap if you compare it with other japanese restaurants in kolkata.

Absolute worst experience in any restaurant ever!! The worst at Sushi Oki and never expected from this place! :( Will never return to this place after today.
Entered the restaurant at 9:03pm.. Got our first portion of sushi at 1015pm!! Main course at 11pm!!
Problem was that by the time we realised it will take forever it was too late to go to another place..
The sushi rolls were warm probably coz they made fresh rice. Over cooked rice in the sushi. Food was bad and definitely not worth the wait.
There was no cold water in the place which I was informed at 945 after which I went to Shibuji to get water and cold drinks. Now I wonder why we endured this suffering! :( Two VIPs entered at 925pm and were out at 1030 after a full meal while we 4 twiddleed our thumbs. Feel like an idiot to have sat through all this. Never coming back!
Oh and the AC is not at all efficient.. It's like there is no air-conditioning! If you really have to eat here inspite of my review, avoid summers for sure!
Meal ended at about 1115pm. Karan and Amitabh (owners) did not even have the decency to come out of the kitchen to apologise for the shoddy treatment of patrons who have been visiting this place from the day it opened. I guess they don't value our business which we shall be happily taking elsewhere and urge others to do the same. Thank you!

Great place for sushi , they have good variety of sushi's available , the place is quite small with only 4 tables.
The veg sushi was good , tried the spicy mushroom rolls were good, the California ¬†rolls were good too, the avocado with cheese roll is must try.
For the main course ordered the Veg. Udon noodles was good, Basil rice was also ok and we tried the morning glory dish which we didnt like as much.

For the drinks Ice tea was nice and refreshing.

The place is a bit expensive, Per head it will cost you around Rs.1200 .

Got food delivered. Prawn and chicken maki sushi, udon noodles, prawn sticky rice and chicken with cashew nuts. 
The sushis were nice but very small in size. Rest of the food was full of pepper and spice which was weird as Japanese cuisine isn't spicy and this way way too spicy. If they could look into their portion sizes and spice level it would be better.

Last night, we visited the Sushi Oke, and my, is it a find! The tiny restaurant can seat just about 20 people, and is easy to blink - and - miss. The ambience is lovely - bright lamps, quirky posters, clean, well - cut furniture and an entire wall lined with a cherry blossom wallpaper! The crockery was clean and functional. Everything is simple and minimalist, and ensures that the centre of attention is the food, and nothing else.¬†

We tried the California Rolls, which were very well - prepared. They came with a generous button of wasabi and pickled ginger. Perhaps the only disappointment was that we were expecting cream - cheese, and not a small piece of processed cheese. Regardless, it was delicious. Next came Chicken Satay, which was also delicious. It came with a sweet chilli dip that they prepare themselves, which complemented the dish perfectly. We also ordered the Singaporean Prawn Laksa, which was a generous portion for the price. It came with lots of kafir lime and lemongrass, and the presentation was lovely! But the real star of our meal was the Crispy Chicken - small pieces of batter - fried chicken tossed in divine, divine ginger honey (or at least that's what we though it was!). The dish was a perfect combination of chewy and crunchy, and on the list of the best dishes we've ever eaten, this one is right there.¬†

This is a lovely place was a quiet date night, or an intimate family affair. I'd recommend only those who enjoy authentic Asian food to hit up this place. If you go expecting Indo - Chinese, or some kind of fusion food, you will be disappointed!

Great place for sushi , they have good variety of sushi's available , the place is quite small with only 4 tables.
The veg sushi was good , tried the spicy mushroom rolls were good, the California ¬†rolls were good too, the avocado with cheese roll is must try.
For the main course ordered the Veg. Udon noodles was good, Basil rice was also ok and we tried the morning glory dish which we didnt like as much.

For the drinks Ice tea was nice and refreshing.

The place is a bit expensive, Per head it will cost you around Rs.1200 .

Pretty decent sushi. Wish the place was a little cooler with slightly more enthusiastic staff. Not that the food served was bad...but wasn't too great. It was just good. I was hungry when I got there..and left satisfied after lunch. The picture of the cat from the place kinda reflects my sentiments, in a slightly exaggerated way.

My 9 year old wanted to try sushi and therefore landed up here yesterday afternoon. A small place with minimalistic decor. 
Not a sushi afficionado myself asked the server to suggest something that my child would like & went with his suggestion. Were served sushi with nori which didn't go down well. Had also ordered Thai green curry which was good but was served with nornal rice instead of Jasmine rice.

Finally a sushi place. Going by the reviews we reached there with great expectations. We were not disappointed. The ambience was modest, service friendly. Coming to the food, it was nice but I won't say it's 100 percent perfect. I have eaten sushi in speciality restaurants in and out of the country and I think there is scope for improvement with this one. But overall, an enjoyable experience.

If you are looking to go to a fancy place don't go here.

If you are looking for really fresh authentic Japanese and Thai food visit this place. Everything you order is freshly made and you can say that in the first bite you take .

The taste is very authentic so most of the people won't like it, but for people who have a taste for authentic Thai and Japanese food are going to love it.

Glass noodle salad and sushi is a must try here.

Extremely small place with just 15 ppl seating.

The interior is resonant of the japanese inns. They even have a ppster of spirited away on the wall. If you want to experiment with cuisines you can come here.  This is as the name suggests a japanese cuisine restaurant located near the back gate of St. Xaviers College. 

We ordered a non veg nigiri sushi platter, yaki soba and udon noodles and Blue flower juice. The juice was actually a dark glistening purple...amd was lightly sweet and soothing. The sushi was great. I loved the crabmeat sushi. The udon was sweet and had weird japanese spices so the taste is new to me. The soup was slightly soya tasted with sweet teriyaki sauce and had abundant sesame seeds. I liked the items. But you need to be open about your tasting spectrum because tbe taste is not at all something you have come across if you are a hard core indian food lover or continental or italian or indian styled chinese lover. Tgey taste is off beat. So if you are willing to experiment go ahead and try out.

I've been coming here for the past three years and in my opinion it's one of the best Japanese/thai joints in its price range. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say that its just as good as many other pricier Japanese joints in the city. It's tucked away near the Xavier's backgate. I've ordered the futamaki and nigiri sushi multiple times. Although it's well made and tastes pretty alright for its price although I suspect they use frozen fish and local soya sauce. The Japanese fried rice was fragrant and delicious. The same goes for the thai cashew nut chicken I ordered. The wasabi ice cream is also worth trying if only for its novelty.

A fantastic surprise. It might not appear much appealing from outside but once you enter and see those menu start tasting those sushi ur whole world gona be upside down. LOCATION : Located in Short Street area just near the 2nd gate of Xavier's. ( exactly same place at the map of zomato)
Tucked away in the corner of  this Japanese gem is worth a attention . Beautiful decor with tatami mats and paper board walls exude an authentic Japanese experience. The service is exemplary. The food arriving within minutes of ordering. Now coming to the food- in one word heavenly. The Boston sushi roll was out has the right amount of tang. Its Made of crab meat ,scallion and salmon  , coated with sticky rice . That tuna sushi wonderfully done. And prawn with spicy mayo mustard  sauce blew us away.  Its was simply sushi day for us.üç¢üç±üç§No doubt about that this place does offer very genuine Japanese dishes. It's hard to pick  favourite sushi over here. 

**Reminder for customer like us and also suggestions for owner or management:
#Please start accepting cards. [they don't accept card so keep cash with ur self minimum 1000 to 1500 for 2 . As there is no ATM near by. ] 
# please keep at-least a wash basin at the restaurant. 
[there is no washroom or no wash basin, so carry ur sanitizer with u] 
This place is like GET Ready with money -> eat n pay -> get out üò¨ (joke ) 

Overall had a nice dinner really recommend this place :)

Visited this place today. Has been longing for this place after hearing a lot about this place. And I was so not disappointed. 
This is a small outlet with decent decoration and clean environment. The main thing which impressed me from the very beginning is the behaviour of the staffs. They are extremely polite and sober. That is exceptationally good. Ordered 3 different types of Sushis. Tastes good absolutely no complaints. Food prices are decent. 
Two things I felt disappointed about it the absence of washroom and they do not accept card payment. These are two major drawbacks. Otherwise a very nice place for japanese food at affordable prices.

If it's your first brave attempt at sushi tasting then hit this joint. The prices here are lower than other restaurants serving sushi...'coz let's face it...sushi is NOT pocket friendly or filling. Sushi is also not for people who prefer spicy and conventional food. I had the Nigiri salmon sushi. 4 small pieces were accompanied by soy sauce, onions and wasabi. It was my first time experience....and I didn't like it much. It tasted sort of bland. The wasabi was terrible. Ordered the Chicken Glass Noodle Salad....and it sort of pulled me out of my disastrous sushi after shock. Quantity was low but taste was good. Sushi really is not for everyone...be prepared for low quantity and comparatively high prices. No wonder the Japanese folks remain so slim & healthy...'coz the get to eat so little :D ... lol! But all joking apart, feel free to visit this place for trying out new cuisines for they do offer a better price than most other restaurants. Ambience nd service was good.

So this was the first time ever that I had sushi. And the experience was wonderful. We ordered vegetarian and non vegetarian ones. There was Maki sushi and California sushi. The non vegetarian came with a crab stick , salmon and tuna in different sushis and in the vegetarian  one there was mushroom and carrots. It was supposed to be dipped in a mixture of soy sauce and wasabi , which I particularly liked. I liked the crab stick sushi more as it was tastier. The other two kinds were okay. The sushis were also served with shredded sweet ginger which I liked the most. Unlike other people had mentioned about how sushi is basically sticky rice and raw fish so it won't taste good , I liked the fact how simple and healthy it is and that it does not taste that bad also. Definitely going to try more sushis !

We went for lunch to this place. Had to struggle a bit finding this place since google maps and zomato showed conflicting locations.
We ordered the sushi(shittake) and Singaporean laksa.The sushi rolls arrived first within 10 minutes. They were tiny but more than the size , taste was not to my liking. The rice seemed a bit overcooked and flavorless. The shittake too tasted a bit bland.
Laksa arrived next. I liked the look of it.And I wasn't proved wrong by the taste either. My first bite into the laksa was a burst of flavors. The rich coconut based gravy alongwith the chewy noodles won my heart. It is one of those comfort foods that can be had all day. The noodles deserve special praise. They were chewy at the same time well cooked. Fine stalks of ginger alongwith some fresh crunchy veggies lent freshness to the laksa.
The 3.5 rating is mainly because of the laksa. Yet to find a good sushi place at Kolkata.

A cosy little restaurant, with comfortable seating and a fine ambience, Sushi Oke's plus points include its friendly staff and the variety of cuisine available, featuring Japanese cuisine which is rare in Kolkata's restaurants. Food preparation is clean and overall healthy and light, which may be a delight for people on diet, but it is belittled by the average Calcuttan's hunger which craves for quantity and quality. Although the dishes like sushi and soba which are popular in Japan, are light, they hardly fill the stomach and miso soup itself has no significant taste. Sushi and fish teriyaki may have been the only saving grace, for the boston rolls served with radish and fish with gravy was good enough, but only as an appetizer and not a main course, which left me and my friends hungry. Also, sticky rice wasn't much of a dish as it couldn't be picked with chopsticks (eating traditional Bengali rice would make me happier any day). And lastly, the prices, which, even for such a restaurant, was too high for such less food served. Therefore, go in if you want an exclusive once-in-a-lifetime taste of Japanese or Thai food, but definitely not to fill your stomach or if you want to save your pocket money or are on a low budget.

Laksa arrived next. I liked the look of it.And I wasn't proved wrong by the taste either. My first bite into the laksa was a burst of flavors. The rich coconut based gravy alongwith the chewy noodles won my heart. It is one of those comfort foods that can be had all day. The noodles deserve special praise. They were chewy at the same time well cooked. Fine stalks of ginger alongwith some fresh crunchy veggies lent freshness to the laksa.
The 3.5 rating is mainly because of the laksa. Yet to find a good sushi place at Kolkata.

Authentic Japanese cuisine and really cozy ambience....Their tempura was light and fluffy, noodles well seasoned and sushi, well prepared. Definitely worth visiting...

A cosy little restaurant, with comfortable seating and a fine ambience, Sushi Oke's plus points include its friendly staff and the variety of cuisine available, featuring Japanese cuisine which is rare in Kolkata's restaurants. Food preparation is clean and overall healthy and light, which may be a delight for people on diet, but it is belittled by the average Calcuttan's hunger which craves for quantity and quality. Although the dishes like sushi and soba which are popular in Japan, are light, they hardly fill the stomach and miso soup itself has no significant taste. Sushi and fish teriyaki may have been the only saving grace, for the boston rolls served with radish and fish with gravy was good enough, but only as an appetizer and not a main course, which left me and my friends hungry. Also, sticky rice wasn't much of a dish as it couldn't be picked with chopsticks (eating traditional Bengali rice would make me happier any day). And lastly, the prices, which, even for such a restaurant, was too high for such less food served. Therefore, go in if you want an exclusive once-in-a-lifetime taste of Japanese or Thai food, but definitely not to fill your stomach or if you want to save your pocket money or are on a low budget.

It's a tiny place. Nice cosy interiors. Well mannered staff. The food is good too. What's interesting is that we ordered a teriyaki, a basil sauce vegetable and a honey and cashewnut gravy vegetable. They all looked amazing but similar. But when we tasted them, all tasted different. :) The laska is another thing that everyone should try.

I, along with two of my friends, was planning to visit The Sushi Oke for a long time. We finally managed to drop in here yesterday at around 7pm.

The place has been nicely decorated maintaining the Japanese theme. The seating arrangements, the sliding doors, the cherry blossom wallpaper, the chopsticks all added to the feel of being in a house in Japan.

We were the only people in the restaurant at that time. Since I and one of my friends have never tried Sushi before, we had come here especially to have Sushi. We decided to order a single plate first and then order more based on how we like it. We opted for a plate of Salmon Nigiri Sushi. We were told by the waiter to pour the soy in the small rectangular bowls and put some wasabi in it and then to dip the sushi in that mix before having it. We did as we were told. As I was having sushi for the first time, I did not have any benchmark to compare it with, but personally I felt that if the amount of rice would have been less, it would have been better. The rice also felt very gluggy to me, but maybe that is how it is actually made, so I cannot complain too much about it. My other friend who was having it for the first time felt so as well.

We decided not to order sushi any more. Instead we opted for a plate of Prawn Thai Red Curry and steamed rice to go with it. This was my first time trying Thai Curry as well, and I liked it very much. The prawns were fresh and plump, and together with the rice, it felt very comforting.

We were still hungry and thus decided to order a plate of Rice Paper Wraps (Chicken). The wraps were decent enough.

The service was good and the waiters were friendly and helpful. Overall it was a nice experience trying out new dishes.

My first attempt at trying Japanese cuisine, and oh boy, I absolutely enjoyed it! Started with Futo Maki Roll stuffed with salmon, egg, carrot, and mushrooms. For the main course, steamed rice and basil chicken. Absolutely loved the basil chicken and also trying the sushi was an amazing experience!

One of the disappointing restaurants i have ever been to.¬†
1) Upon arrival we were told that the chef has gone out and will be returning shortly(which turned out to be a good 20 mins later) .¬†After the staff returned we ordered, two types of nigiri sushi and two sets of sushi rolls and a plate of chicken teriyaki.
2) Tuna was not available in in spite of being one of the 4 non veg sushi items on the menu. I was surprised to hear a microwave beeping in the kitchen a few mins after ordering which made me think that it might be frozen sushi being thawed.
3) The sushi rice was stiff and clumped together and definitely made beforehand. 4)The the salmon topping had dark green to black patches on top.
5) The strips of nori meant to hold the sushi together were frayed and torn in places(as visible in the images uploaded by other reviewers). Having used chopsticks for many years i tried my best to pick them up as lightly as possible yet the nori kept ripping the sushi disintegrated as i tried to dip them into the soy sauce. I would rate the supermarket style spencers food court sushi higher. ¬†
6)The chicken teriyaki pieces were very dry and tough and not properly sliced through.¬†

The strangest thing of all of this being that in spite of being a specialty restaurant with premium prices( the bill came to around 1800) they do not accept any cards, moreover there are no ATM's within walking distance. The waiter actually came with us on an uber to the nearest ¬†ATM(which would be a good 8 -10 min walk away) and took the cash.

Being crazy about sushi i would not recommend this restaurant to anybody. Also from the time we arrived till the time we left no other customers were to be seen.

Went there on one of my friend's birthday. The waiter served us water which was smelling like fish. Yuck. We ordered veg sushi platter and a non veg sushi platter. The salmon in the sushi was again smelling. It was not fresh. We ordered glass noodles which was yummy.. The interiors are greatly done. They have totally succeeded in impressing the customers at first sight.

The only con is that they don't accept cards, so carry enough cash.

I've been there with my cousin. It was our first sushi experience.  However we entered it was quite and we were the only persons cuse it was their closing time after lunch hour. We were seated and provided with menu however what we wanted we didn't got cus it was out of stock so we tried 2 types of sushi dishes which were Asparagus roll and Futo Maki roll that was awesome. After that we tried some basil chicken with Japanese sticky rice and coke.  The food was awsome the only grief was that the smoked salmon was not available. Will definitely visit there once more to experience that.

Well let me start reviewing by saying that I am not at all fond of Japanese food though I like to try different cuisines but I am not very fond of their cuisine. But my friend forced me to visit this small food joint right at the back end of Xavier's and I felt the place is very small, it can maximum accommodate 15 odd people. We ordered 2 different varieties if sushi and they served it in a very neatly and decorated manner but since I'm pretty apprehensive having Japanese food so I was hesitant in trying at the starting but it tasted good.. I won't be able to judge on the standard of the food as I haven't tried sushi at other places but I felt it was quite delicious.. Still I would tell my friends who is not fond of Japanese cuisine that visit this outlet but before ordering just ask the stuffing in sushi cause it is very important otherwise you might not like what is being served..

Before I share my experience with you I want to highlight the 3 fundamental ways restaurants increase profit or minimise loss-
1) Increase revenue
2) Decrease cost
3) Both of the above

Having said that, inadequate quantity of Nori wrap, adulteration of sushi rice with long grained substitute & stale raw fish are perhaps some of the key cost reduction strategies adopted by some Japanese restaurants, in order to maintain a low pricing strategy. Sushi Oke's 'long-grained-rice-with-a-slice-of-seemingly-stale-salmon' rendition of Nigiri sushi was a clear reflection of the economical twist that appears on their menu card. Having traded my time & money for sheer disappointment I've come to terms with the fact that Japanese cuisine is best left in the fine dining segment. A classic example of living on borrowed time.

Located in Short Street area just near the 2nd gate of Xavier's. A perfect destination for authentic Japanese and Thai food in the city. The teriyaki, tom yum soup , phad thai - all were just mindblowing. This place has the best collection for sushi. We went for Nilgiri Sushi with asparagus. Just mesmerising. The deserts had a unique touch. Wasabi and coconut ice creams were ordered. Wasabi was too innovative a flavour for desert. Must try their sushis and wasabi. A small place with not much of decor, but the food- awsummm.

I was very satisfied by the Japanese food in the restaurant. The sushi was slightly tweaked for the Indian palette and served very well. I was disappointed to know there was no tuna available - you need tuna in your sushi. The Japanese style fried rice, teriyaki flavoured chicken and miso soup were good enough for a satisfying meal. 

One major problem I faced is that they do not accept cards. For their sake and the customers convenience I hope they include that payment option. 
All in all a decent experience. I hope they have tuna the next time i come in.

Why don't you change the old menu here to the new one? Food is generally good, but the last time we went, they let us order tonnes of main course gravy items, and then told us they had no more steamed rice or anything of that sort except tofu fried rice which was horrible and an extravagant price. And food quality was much worse than before for sure!

And I see that I have not reviewed the joint from where my venture with japanese food started. I was a novice at japanese food and scared of eating uncooked fish when two of my friends insisted we should drive in to sushi oke. I was not a xavierian then , so had problems in locating. Now that I know where short street is, sushi oke is at the backgate of st. Xavier's College.  Ask anyone, the blind knows the way. And I entered. And i was amazed to see the amazing decor. So simple, just like a courtyard of a house in Japan, with flaired fans on the walls, and low chairs, well litted joint.  It gave me kind of comfortable feeling that finally am at home. I was thoroughly impressed by the salt and pepper stacks which look like two rats embracing each other. I believe a bit of Japanese music would havr definitely uplifted the spirit. Opened the menu and asked the staff to suggest what is best. Had heard praises of its nigiri sushi.

 So we went in for-

 a tuna nigiri sushi. The dish arrived in a wooden mantle, chopsticks laying around. Looked like small cute dumplings tied around with a thread. It was basically vinegared rice topped with tuna , served witb pickled ginger , soy and wasabi. It was the first time that I tried wasabi and it made me perpetually sneeze since I took it all at one.

Then we went in the traditional chicken odon noodles. With its unbeatable taste and the slurpy feel of the noodles , I could simply rate it as an amazing little dish. 

The star of the show was however the chicken teriyaki.  The chicken was a bit hard though. But it was amazingly prepared with the correct amount of teriyaki sauce. Highly recommended. 

However the portions were quite small except for the odon noodles. So I believe this is one of the major drawback which definitely needs to be sorted. Prices dont burn your pocket. Definitely worth trying. 

Will definitely be remembered for giving me a nostalgic memory of my first sushi tasting

If you want to try Japanese food for the first time, don't ever go here! Your enthusiasm will be nipped in its bud.
The food quality was quite bad overall. 

Our order consisted of : 
Tom Yum Soup (8/10, however this was the only dish which we relished) 
California Roll Sushi ( 2/10) 
Vegetable & Mayonnaise Roll Sushi (1/10) 
Soba Noodle ( 2/10) 

This was my first experience of leaving unconsumed sushi behind on the plate. Quite a disappointment.

This place is located right behind the back gate of Xaviers College.
Its a small restaurant with a seating capacity of 20 people (+-5). The decor is simple and sober. One little challenge was the location of the AC. Since there is only one AC due to which only one side of the restaurant is cooled. This might be an issue in Calcutta summers.
The food was pretty good. We had a Salmon sushi, 2 chicken sushis and a pad thai noodles. They serve 4 sushis per plate which is decent for Rs.230. I would suggest the chicken sushi over the salmon one because the salmon portion is quite less and it tends to dissolve in the rice and the seaweed. We also ordered the Chicken pad thai noodles which I found to be surprisingly sweet! That I found weird, not bad though. The noodles quantity can increase however.
On an overall I give a 4 simply because of the taste of the Sushi and the affordability factor. I would say that Price for 2 people should be close to Rs.1000 and not Rs.700

I was gifted a coupon via Groupon. . Which was a non veg meal for two. But to my suprise all that was served In this deal was a portion of 4 ps sushi and a portion of chicken teriyaki Which is actually enough for just one person. 

But the food was fairly decent... The sushi is decent.. If u r someone who has a sushi fetish then u might be disappointed... The chicken teriyaki was fairly decent... what suprised me is the pricing.. The items are priced like any sushi bar but the post ions are small. 

The restaurant is like a hole in the wall.. its tiny..and lacks to give you the basic ambience and hygiene is also a concern..With 2-3 flies.. hovering around your food..

The management on the other hand is friendly... and helpful.. 

I would still say give it a shot.. but don't over expect. .

So I wanted to try out sushi for ages. At Bangalore, there were some nice places I heard but back then, never had the time or money to try them out. Last week, I was at Kolkata for an exam, and with my cousin, it seemed a perfect time to try out Sushi. So, The Sushi Oke. Cheaper than the rest, and in a place which I know.¬†
First impression, the door is an unsuspecting glass door. A very normal, simple looking one. You need to keep your eye out for this one though, easy to miss.
Within, 5 tables i think, and 4 per table seating capacity. Neat table mats, chopsticks, and the spoon and fork. Nice salt and pepper holders.¬†
We asked our waiter to suggest, and he asked us to try Salmon and California Rolls. So, thats what we ordered.
One thing I must make clear here, the food is absolutely not spicy. And the raw fish, is basically smoked. It isnt uncooked. Anyway, the California Rolls were rice and crab meat and avocado bits. Nice actually. And the salmon was so-so.¬†
Also, this isnt filling in any way. We ordered a plate of Nigiri sushi, 2 prawns and 2 salmon. These i liked. Sis didnt like the salmon much.¬†
This place is fine if you crave absolute calm, and peaceful non spicy food. The price seemed a bit expensive with respect to the food quantity, but then, thats how these cost.¬†
Another point ticked off the list.

Good food, reasonable prices, cozy interiors, friendly staff- sums up this place about right. I'd choose this place over the other Japanese joints in town any day. 
Besides the sushi, the sticky Japanese rice was especially good, and is a must try.
The sad part about this place is that they don't accept cards AND there is no ATM nearby. So make sure you go to this place with your pockets loaded!

My cousin Mrinalini introduced me to this joint. It is a small place situated opposite to the back gate of st. Xavier's college. The place has really great decor and some super cute salt and pepper shaker. 
We ordered the miso soup and the nigiri sushi and maki sushi. The food was really good and the management is really nice and friendly. The staff and owner r very helpful and even help u decide if u don't know wat to order.

I was gifted a coupon via Groupon. . Which was a non veg meal for two. But to my suprise all that was served In this deal was a portion of 4 ps sushi and a portion of chicken teriyaki Which is actually enough for just one person.

Good enough sushi. First we ordered Salmon nigiri sushi and California rolls and followed it up with a second order of Philadelphia rolls and Futo Maki rolls. The second batch was especially nice, moist and fresh like good sushi should be. But the menu lacks variety, too few seafood options, no meat options other than chicken, no fish eggs that form such an integral part of sushi. The wasabi lacks punch as well. We also had prawn tempura which was nice enough. On a previous visit I also had Soba noodles which I didn't care much about. Prices are alright, but they only take cash, so go with a full wallet. Even though there was only one server attending to all 4 tables, service was good and friendly. Overall I like this place, only wish that there were some more varieties of sushi available.

Place is small, food is good, little bit overpriced. Overall 4.5/5

Let me start by saying I am fond of Japanese food, specially when it comes to sudden craving for something to eat between work. So my love for sushi is a convenient option. This place is very near to my office.
Food: We had a veg sushi maki roll (mushrooms, avocado and carrot) and asparagus nigiri. It was priced at 200 each which came with 4 pieces, since I had an experience of how expensive Japanese cuisine can be, this seemed affordable. This also meant u can try more options. But 8 pieces of sushi wasn't really filling so we ordered veg teriyaki( curry with an assortment of vegetables) with Japanese sticky rice. (275+ 120).
Ambience:  From the outside it doesn't look like a Japanese restaurant until u go inside. The inside decor theme is inspired by the Japanese culture. Though they also have Thai cuisine. 

Service : It was a little slow and all the waiters were in the kitchen so it was always a hazel to call them if u wanted something. But they were courteous and the food was good. No qualms about that.

Over all : Affordable! They had the usual 14% Vat charges only. So the bill was under 1000 for 2 people.

I am being extremely generous by giving a 2.5/5. It is outrageously expensive. Decor is good but not of high quality. Food is very very average and the service is quite poor. I paid 1200 for a lunch for 2, 1 course meal and was not even full after we were done.

What was I thinking when I decided to make a vegetarian sushi Virgin try Japanese in a new random untouched sushi place in a new town. Clearly I wasn't. 
Now, its proximity to Xaviers is why this place might be running coz I remember coming out with sincere displeasure on my face. They didn't have a lot of element specified in their menu, and I was reduced to the choice of maki rolls ( California rolls and cucumber cheese rolls ) They actually ran out of ice tea, who does that! The only good thing was the staff.

I visited this place on December 2013.At that time it was one of the few outlets selling Sushi.I tried the sushi there,not a big fan really.Good for a 1st time experience.

The Thai Food was brilliant there..I ordered Phad Thai..The flavours in it were amazing.

Got hold of Groupon's latest deal on Sushi OKe.. Had to try it!
We were firstly given Ice Tea. Then we were given options from sushi rolls ( and not nilgiri Sushi may be since its on offer) and I Ordered Boston Rolls. It was well marinated and slightly cooked and I really loved it. This kind of sushi is not raw. Then I ordered Chicken Teriyaki. They gave good amount of flavored steamed rice with chicken teriyaki ( I forgot to take pics). Quantity of rice was a lot. Also, initially the flavor seemed nice, but after a point of time, I did not feel like having it anymore. I would have loved to try another sushi but the overdose of rice kind of ruined my taste.

Located just beside St.Xavier's back gate. This outlet is rather small but cozy..ambiance is moderately decorated. Now coming to the food!!
The thai green curry with jasmine is a must and just amazing to our surprise. Portion size is not lump sum but did does really fills up the belly for regular eaters. Salmon sushi was just lip smacking...overall a good experience...

Had an amazing experience! The restaurant may look small but the ambience is semi Japanese and the food is just delicious. The staff is extremely courteous and although the menu is limited because of the place obviously, one of the suggestions made, rice paper chicken roll, was a first try for me and as it turned out was just perfect! The wasabi could be add a little more kick to it though. Overall the meal was pocket friendly and we had a great experience.

Had decided to try for something new and the term 'sushi' instantly sprang up in my mind. Zomaing later, I decided on trying out The Sushi Oke. Located just a stone's throgh from Xaviers gate, the small twenty odd seater is the perfect sushi bar. The ambience was nice; simple seating and great lights.

About the food, the soup we ordered was a bit on the bland at first, but was later told it tasted exactly like that. Green tea-ish kind of, with tofus floating around. Not my thing.

Next we settled for the Nilgiri Sushi. Just one word, beautifully done. The elegant Japanese way. We tried out some other dishes as well, and all of them were good to taste. A slight bland, but not tasteless. Not for the Indian palette diehard though.

About the service, excellent. The waiter was kind enough to spend over ten minutes telling us how each dish is done and how to hold the chopsticks in the right way.

Rounding off, a good experience. A must try for the Zen in us. :)

This month I planned to give my stomach a new taste and so I was trying new cuisines and out of all the cuisines I thought of trying Japanese was one of them. Now going through the review I got a mixed feedback about the cuisine. Sushi is the only name most people have heard when it comes to Japanese food. As mentioned after getting mixed feedback I thought of giving it a try and so today in the afternoon I visited this place. After going through the menu and consulting the people there we came to a conclusion and ordered three dishes-
1. Yakitori Chicken( Looked same like Chicken Satay)
2. Japanese Sticky Rice
3. Nigiri Sushi(Salmon)

Yakitori Chicken as I said tasted like Chicken Satay and blended pretty well with the Sticky rice and so we enjoyed the combination.
Now coming to Sushi,aahh the first look of the Sushi didn't stirred me up at all. It was plain and simple bundled¬† nothing much and so we called up the person there and asked him how to exactly eat Sushi.
The person was really helpful he taught us how to use a chopstick and what exactly is Sushi plate.
Now coming to the tutorial Sushi plate is just a black plate used to mix the Sushi,wasabi and soy. First you pour some amount of Soya Sauce almost half the plate then you take half the wasabi(for 2 bundled Sushis) and mix it well with the Soya Sauce and then you dip the Sushi in it and then eat the whole thing at once. Sushi in itself is not at all spicy and so it might not taste that good but when it tried like this it tastes pretty well.

So overall my experience at Sushi Oke was pretty damn good and looking forward to try their other dishes in future.

Given all the good reviews,I decided to give japanese a try.
NOTE to Self:-NEVER have japanese again in entire life.

We ordered sushi-Philadelphia roll,chicken teriyaki,and fried sticky rice.

Sushi-Oh My God, either I dont know how to eat sushi,or sushi just tastes bad,very bad.We could eat only three rolls out of four.I felt pukish.

Sticky Fried Rice-This was nice,not very,but still,atleast way better than sushi(why do people even have sushi??)

Chicken Teriyaki-The chicken pieces were in nice portions,but I felt the sauce wasnt tasty and the chicken chewy.

Ambience- was good,service-good.
We went on a sunday at around 2 to find the place totally empty.There was just one more customer.
Ambience-4
Service-4
Food-Ahem,ahem-Its the japanese food that tastes yuk.the rolls of sushi was nicely done,and looks as per youtube vids.yet -1
Value for money-2
Verdict-Maybe japanese cuisine is what one needs to get used to.Visit once for the experience and then decide for yourself.Personally,I now know,why my elder brother stuck to mac d,and not sushi,while he was in japan.I am never having japanese again.

The place is hard to find for those who are not acquainted with lanes and by lanes of Park Street and can only accommodate a maximum of 16-20 people at the most. Wait !!!! do not let that dampen your quest for the joint !!!!!.
Great food. The cuisine they serve, the service they provide and the ambiance is really cool.
My first start with Japanese cuisine is off to a rocking start, thanks to Sushi Oke and Mrinmoy. I learnt to use the chopsticks, tasted sushi for the first time and boy did I like it.
However, not for Kolkata foodies who are more in tune with Kolkata - Chinese cuisine served everywhere. The taste is bland but sure makes a grand entry for first timers.
Try the Futo Maki Roll, Nigiri Sushi and Boston Roll. Tom Yum Soup (chicken) is also tasty and different despite being a clear soup (its Thai by the way). Tried Bangkok Style Squid and I must say i missed my drinks a lot at that point of time.
Lastly, the guy named Mrinmoy. He can help you immensely. Ask for him to assist you and he can be as sweet as the caramelised juice !!!!!
Definitely a thumbs up and a must visit.

Located two steps from the back gaye of St Xavier's, it not only serves Japanese but Thai and Singaporean too. The best black plates, the ever so useful sauce bowls, the low tables, the quirky posters on the wall - I loved it all. 
The sushi rolls were well made. The clean yet flavoursome glass noodle salad was a treat too. The sticky rice and fish, though well balanced and tasty, came in small portions. 
Then came the big warm bowl of laksa and this was the real badass! As I mixed the red sauce and the condiments with the flat noodles, I was trying to figure in my mind as to how the end product will be. The first mouthful was nothing less than a mad boy of fireworks of flavours inside my mouth. In a blink the bowl was literally licked clean. 
Then came by the coconut ice cream and wasabi ice cream. The wasabi one had a good dose of the typical wasabi kick and is a must try. 
Also the staff was courteous. But the negatives would be that the place is very crammed. Two big peep pole will have a problem eating side by side. Also portion sizes are not too generous. But loved it anyway!

This place was near to the office where I went for a meeting. As I never before tried Sushi, I decided to give it a try here. Place is pretty small can fit 10 - 12 people together at max. I liked it's Japanese style bright decor. The staff was courteous, guided me   how to have Sushi and also informed me about its ingredients.

For people who have never tried Sushi:
1. You can have Sushi only with chopsticks. So learn how to use them before trying Sushi.
2. People who like spicy food should give it a miss. 
3. Also people who prefer quantity should look for other options.

For me this was my first and last experience of Sushi. Sushi doesn't suits my taste buds.

Located two steps from the back gaye of St Xavier's, it not only serves Japanese but Thai and Singaporean too. The best black plates, the ever so useful sauce bowls, the low tables, the quirky posters on the wall - I loved it all. 
The sushi rolls were well made. The clean yet flavoursome glass noodle salad was a treat too. The sticky rice and fish, though well balanced and tasty, came in small portions. 
Then came the big warm bowl of laksa and this was the real badass! As I mixed the red sauce and the condiments with the flat noodles, I was trying to figure in my mind as to how the end product will be. The first mouthful was nothing less than a mad boy of fireworks of flavours inside my mouth. In a blink the bowl was literally licked clean. 
Then came by the coconut ice cream and wasabi ice cream. The wasabi one had a good dose of the typical wasabi kick and is a must try. 
Also the staff was courteous. But the negatives would be that the place is very crammed. Two big peep pole will have a problem eating side by side. Also portion sizes are not too generous. But loved it anyway!

This place was near to the office where I went for a meeting. As I never before tried Sushi, I decided to give it a try here. Place is pretty small can fit 10 - 12 people together at max. I liked it's Japanese style bright decor. The staff was courteous, guided me   how to have Sushi and also informed me about its ingredients.

For people who have never tried Sushi:
1. You can have Sushi only with chopsticks. So learn how to use them before trying Sushi.
2. People who like spicy food should give it a miss. 
3. Also people who prefer quantity should look for other options.

For me this was my first and last experience of Sushi. Sushi doesn't suits my taste buds.

The Sushi Oke is a wonderful place for Japanese food in the city! Super affordable and super tasty food. Great service ; very friendly manager and staff - very patient on the phone and they recommend the best items on the menu. Must tries are Smoked Salmon Sushi Rolls, Chicken Yakitori and the California Rolls.

I really loved this place. This is the first time I tried Japanese cuisine and the waiters very courteously helped us to order the food. They were educated and were very patient to teach us eat with the chopsticks till we mastered it. We ate sushi and the flat noodles in soup. The sushi felt like multiple flavours bursting in my mouth. It was a very hot summer afternoon when we reached there and they allowed us to stay over a little longer in their eatery even after we had paid our bills. That was a great attitude. kudos!

Located on Short Street, near the St. Xavier's hostel, this little eatery is easy to miss. Once you go in, the ambiance is spot on, from low seats and tables, Japanese style sliding doors, and Miyazaki posters on the wall.

I have been there twice. Their sushi tastes fresh, with no overwhelming smell, and just the right flavour coming through. The bowl of soba noodles is huge, and a meal in itself. The sticky rice with tofu may seem a bit bland to the Indian palate, but is quite delightful with a dose of soya sauce.

But the star of their menu, in my opinion, is their chicken yakitori, grilled skewered chicken lathered in a special sauce. It is like an explosion of umami in your mouth. Do give it a try if you decide to go there.

The bill on both occasions came to around Rs 1200, which is a good enough price to pay if you really want to try out good Japanese food.

This small & cozy restaurant is located near the Short Street-Outram Road crossing close to St. Xavier's. I've been a fan of Japanese cuisine ever since trying out the Sushi from their outlet at the Forum mall in Elgin Road. A few change of locations later they've settled down with this wonderful little eatery. The ambience is soothing & the service excellent; they are very helpful whether you're dining there or ordering for takeaway/home delivery. Sushi is, admittedly, an acquired taste but I like the subtle flavours & they certainly take utmost care in preparing it hygenically. I'd give them a perfect score but I'm holding out till I tried the Thai items on the menu.

If you have seen my review on Chilli Wok, I ¬†had mentioned that I have regulared the food from this place since they home delivered out of Alipur. Ever since the joint opened, ¬†I have regularly visited it and have loved each experience. Japanese food is always about freshness and subtlety of flavour and they deliver it in abundance. The sushi's in all their forms are great whether its the Nori Maki, California Roll, nagiri etc etc. I regularly have the soba noodles and the sticky fried rice as they really hit the spot with the flavour. But my personal recommendations have to be the Tempura, whose batter is superbly light fluffy and crunchy, and the fish Teriyaki. Overeating here for me is a bit of a habit now.
Being a regular also brings with it some added benefits like great service and quick service. The only sad bit is the location and the unassumingly small location. People tend to miss it or sometimes diss it. But for anyone and everyone reading this review. Trust me, there are only 2 credible choices for authentic Japanese cuisine that don't burn your pockets and thats Fuji and Sushi Oke. Of the 2 I always recommend Sushi Oke.
Food: 4. Maybe a few new items or slight change in menu is due.
Ambiance: 4.5. I find it very comfy and cozy, which goes well with Japanese food anyways.
Service: 5
Value for Money: 4. I know Im being unfair because I always overeat ;P

Yes I've heard umpteen number of times that Japanese cuisine is all about acquired taste. So when the first time I tasted Japanese food at the sushi oke I knew I do not wish to acquire the taste. 

Located just beside my college, I had been eyeing at this place since a year and finally, I went in here with a friend of mine. 

Upon entering we found a person sleeping on the floor and it was horribly hot inside. 
The ac was switched on and we placed our orders. 
I do not remember which sushi did I order- guess it was California roll and along with that we ordered soba noodles. 
I found the sushi bland and the rice was indeed sticky. 
There was a blob of green something which looked like clay, we tasted that and regretted it immediately. 
My friend liked the soup of the soba noodles, i found it to be okay. Honestly, I was craving for a familiar taste and I couldn't bear these foreign tastes dancing on my taste buds. 

The bill come around 500 bucks. However, I don't think I'm going back here anytime soon.

Visited last time this little cozy Japanese restaurant,  while leaving koljata.  Gave a party to my friend's and it was quite one and very great.  Mine friends were in there first time to try sushi for first time,  the serving people described in detail to them what should they try.  And quality of food is great,  and considered with other Japanese restaurant in kolkata its price is cheaper,  but quality is very good. Planning to visit again when in kolkata

Sushi oke-  a small friendly cosy little restaurant where you get amazing sushi and thai food as well. They have variety which is commendable. Difficult to locate, they should put up some signs here and there. 

The place is small but well maintained and definitely has that japanese feeling . I was indeed very excited to try their food after seeing the multiple reviews and i have to say i am not disappointed. The salmon sushi was yum to my tum.Most importantly the prices here are very reasonable. To all the fish lovers or japanese food lovers, give this place a try. Not saying that this a fine dining place but i am sure you will be surprised at their quality and service. You could also give their thai dishes a try, which are equally yum.

Finally a place i can hit whenever i crave sushi.

Definitely the place to be for sushi after pan Asian (which is heavy on your pocket). Sushi oke is delightfully delicious. I started with miso soup and followed it up with the sushi- boston roll, smoked salmon roll and salmon nigiri. The food was satisfying though you can't compare it to pan Asian specially if you talk about the sauce to go with the sushi. Overall, above average food at a decent price..

I am a big fan of bland oriental food, and this is my favorite Japanese place in Kolkata. Tucked away in a quiet Wood Street corner, it is difficult to locate this teeny weeny eatery, but the effort is worth it because its a treasure trove! I have been here a number of times, and each time came back happy happy happy! 
The seating capacity is limited, albeit comfortable. The staff is warm, friendly and eager to help. I have tried the Chicken Yakitori (sauce lined lightly flavored chicken skewers), miso soup, prawn tempura (yummmm), almost all maki sushis and nigiri sushis, and the Soba noodles. They are all just heavenly. Most of the ingredients of Teppenyaki cuisine is imported, perhaps the reason why most places serve stale Nori. But, I am impressed with the freshness of the stuff that is served here. The tender flavors of the far east, so delicately recreated in my city - it is simply heartwarming.
This place is pricey by ordinary Kolkata standards, but remember this is exotic Japanese, so it is worth every penny. They do not have desserts, which is a bit sad (maybe they will introduce later for people like me with a sweet tooth) TIP: Bongs with palates like me who dig bland food are also big on their sweets!
They serve cold drinks and do not have a liquor license, so diet coke it is for people like me. Cheers!

Went with a friend on a summer's day, the ambiance was beautiful-soothing, in fact. Had the miso soup-it was quite authentic and delicate. The sushi was fine, though a little chewy! The fish and sticky rice were delicious. All in all , a fine place. The downside is that it is quite costly, even for two students.

I was ¬†shocked and disappointed as i have previously recommended this place to many of my aquaintances and then this happens !!!!!!! And to my dismay the ¬†guy did not ever bother to say a sorry ! and went up asking "was it on your plate !" as if that was excusable . Appalling ,pathetic .

Kolkata finally has a good Sushi joint which serves quality Japanese food without burning an outrageous hole in one's pocket.

Parking availability : Located near St. Xaviers college back gate, I went there in the late evening for dinner and parking was quite easily available right in front of the store. A huge plus for a city that has never-ending parking woes.

Ambiance: Minimalist style but quaint enough to have an asian cum japanese feel to it. Comfortable.

Food:
I order an assortment of Sushi rolls - California Roll, Boston Roll, Prawn Roll and Smoked Salmon Roll. They were all good. 4pc per plate, each with decent quantity (not small nibbles). Kikkomon sauce was good as usual. Wasabi paste was nice and flavourful, a good indication of quality. I also ordered the chicken teriyaki and sticky rice. The Chicken was slightly overdone. It could have been a bit more moist and soft. 

Drinks: Reasonable and good. Had the mixed berry tea which was very nice.
Owner was present to meet and greet which was super!

Desserts: They have a wonderful range of desserts. Must try!

Suggestions to owner:
Try and see if you can have your branding on the cutlery. It adds to the sophistication of your counter.
You can possibly experiment with light instrumental japanese / oriental music to enhance the 'feel' for the customer.
More experimentation with Sushi! Visit some iconic japanese restaurants across the country for ideas. (yum yum tree in delhi, Wasabi @ Taj, Mumbai are some examples).

All in all, I love japanese food. And while there are two or three new options in the city, Sushi Oke is definite value for money! A must go for anyone who wants to pig-out on some scrumptious sushi.

I have mixed feelings about The Sushi Oke. Their interiors are nice and minimal following an Asian theme. The service was decent, probably to do with the fact that we were the only diners in there. 

In terms of food, their menu does show some variety - though none of the Thai section dishes were available when we there. The food seemed fresh, but did need some improvement. The sushi we ordered was too chewy for my liking -  with a synthetic flavour to it. The miso soup was decent, and the mains were okay. Overall, this place is about average and is fine for a change, definitely not the best.

A quaint little place tucked away in the ground floor of a fairly large and squat building, almost hidden away from plain sight is Sushi Oke. I liked it that away. It left some room for privacy and isolation which can sometimes be a good thing during a meal and especially while savouring a cuisine as delicate as Japanese. Take a step down and you will find yourself in a room with 8 to 10 tables and a counter top with 4 or 5 stools. The decor is pleasing and has a distinct Japanese touch to it.  
The day we visited we were greeted and served by the owner himself who was a pleasant and rather polite man. From the onset he was honest and made recommendations in the same vein. I was very disappointed to learn that the salmon used in the sushis were not of the raw variety but smoked, which is never the case with sushis. We ordered the maki sushis, nigiri sushis and the tuna roll. The prawns used in all the sushis were quite fresh and the flavours of the vinegar-ed rice were quite appreciable. The tuna was average in my opinion. The salmon as I expected was a huge disappointment. The slight smokiness in the fish was too overpowering for the delicate rice and the nori. The pickled ginger was good and the wasabi did pack a punch. Next up, we went for the soba noodles with prawns which was good. The flavours of the broth and prawn tempura did combine well. 
The price that we had to pay for the quantity and quality was in my opinion a bit steep. Other than the salmon there is nothing majorly wrong with the place, the only drawback as informed by the owner is that they will never get a liquor license due to their close proximity to a school and college. I am unlikely to visit this place again as I don't intend to have smoked salmon sushis and also because a couple of new Japanese restaurants have cropped up which serve very good food and especially sushis.

Food nothing gr8!!! Too pricey !! We spent 1400 for 2 ppl!
Glass noodle salad was served warm when it should be served cold! curry very oily, didn't care much for sushi.
Ambience sucks- uncomfortable seats, poor hygiene, dirty walls and air conditioner, no music!!
Saw cockroaches climbing up the glass division in the kitchen. Cheap cutlery - all together not worth the price paid!!

This is one place i cant get enough of. Not very overpriced for the quality of food they serve and really good service too. 
The salmon sushi is just amazing. Tried the boston roll too..was very well done. For the mains..I've tried almost everything on their menu and have never been disappointed. The basil chicken with sticky rice is one of my favourites. The phad thai is also worth mentioning..great flavours!! Haven't come across a place which makes better phad thai here in kolkata. Also, they have expanded their menu quite a bit. Theres something new in their menu every time i visit this place. Also the unique blue pea flower juice is worth giving a try. Finally the coconut ice cream and apple pie ice cream are just the perfect ending to the lovely meal!!

The food, the ambiance and the location is great. When you enter the restaurant you feel very cosy and it is very comfortable. I simply love their sushi and their salads.

Good food.   The decor is very lovely.  It is small and evokes the neighbourhood japaneese hole in the wall restaurant.  So the feel is there.  Thai dishes are also good.  Had vegetarian options.  A bit pricey.

I'll start with the decor of the place. It is small and quite beautiful. Has a very distinct Japanese touch to it. Nothing fancy, nothing over the top, just the that very clean and crisp feel to it without actually being very fake. 

I have had sushi a couple of times now. So here is what we ordered. Salmon nigiri sushi, california rolls, chicken teriyaki with some sticky rice and iced tea. A reasonably safe looking choice, but the menu is limited in a sense. I am fine with it when you can make sushis as well as Sushi Oke actually ends up doing. I absolutely adored the rice paper rolls and the nigiri sushi. I am not a huge fan of wasabi so I generally keep that out of my system. Plain soy and the pickled ginger with my sushi. The salmon on the nigiri was so good. Very delicate flavours enhanced by the slight saltiness of the soy. It was beautiful. I would probably have loved the california rolls as well if I had it before the nigiris. The nigiris were brilliant. The california rolls were not as good.

The rice paper rolls were another thing of beauty. Very fresh, very light and with this green sauce (which seems sweet at first, but has this almighty kick to it which gets you sweating in minutes) it was possibly among the most refreshing things i have had in a while. The noodles and the prawn and the veggies provided you with this beautiful soft, crispy texture (yes, I used both soft and crispy in the same line) which make you so happy. Had the chicken teriyaki with some sticky rice. The flavours on the teriyaki was wonderful. But what disappointed me was the chicken. Just was a bit over which kind of detracted from the whole experience in ways. The iced tea works well with all of it. 

Paid a total of 1632, and definitely coming back soon enough.

Food nothing gr8!!! Too pricey !! We spent 1400 for 2 ppl!
Glass noodle salad was served warm when it should be served cold! curry very oily, didn't care much for sushi.
Ambience sucks- uncomfortable seats, poor hygiene, dirty walls and air conditioner, no music!!
Saw cockroaches climbing up the glass division in the kitchen. Cheap cutlery - all together not worth the price paid!!

This is one place i cant get enough of. Not very overpriced for the quality of food they serve and really good service too. 
The salmon sushi is just amazing. Tried the boston roll too..was very well done. For the mains..I've tried almost everything on their menu and have never been disappointed. The basil chicken with sticky rice is one of my favourites. The phad thai is also worth mentioning..great flavours!! Haven't come across a place which makes better phad thai here in kolkata. Also, they have expanded their menu quite a bit. Theres something new in their menu every time i visit this place. Also the unique blue pea flower juice is worth giving a try. Finally the coconut ice cream and apple pie ice cream are just the perfect ending to the lovely meal!!

Confession: I will talk about the taste. I've always wanted to taste sushi and this was my first time. So, I will not be able to comment on authenticity.

The Sushi Oke was on my Wishlist for the longest time. And finally, today was the lucky day. As I read on previous reviews, I chose to visit this place for lunch. The restaurant was empty, and remained so when we left. Even the staff pointed out that the rush hour starts from 6 pm. So, afternoon is the perfect time to enjoy a quiet Japanese meal. Maybe because the restaurant had no other visitor, my team got undivided attention from them.

We ordered Salmon Nigiri Sushi, Boston Roll Maki Sushi, Tempura Prawn & Fish Teriyaki...

Between the two, I liked the Nigiri Sushi more. The Boston Roll Maki Sushi was great nonetheless, but the Salmon Nigiri Sushi got a tad better complemented with the Wasabi/Soy mix. Coming to this mix, I must tell you that it has a greater kick than our very own Mustard sauce (or, kasundi). As Japanese tradition demands, you need to mix the small green Wasabi ball into the bowl of Soy sauce. And then, dip a sushi into it and eat the sushi whole. If you eat a sushi without this mix, it's plain 'maach-bhaat' (no offense). With this mix, however, you get a feel of a Mt. Vesuvius eruption. And if you like unexpected punches (just with food obviously), this is definitely an eruption worth trying! Sticky rice, fish and this mix took my first Sushi experience to a whole new level.

I didn't like the taste of the Fish Teriyaki that much. It was just OK! Nothing great, really! However, the Prawn Tempura was a stunner. Yes, it's a bit on the costlier side but what's the harm in trying once? Nicely battered fried prawns, and pretty big in size. With this dish comes a bowl of sauce (which looked more like a soup). As I didn't want to dip the crunchy prawns, this sauce got the treatment a soup deserves. But it was OUTSTANDING!! I had never tasted something so mild, yet so refreshing. Hats off!! A total comfort food.

P.S: Some of you might be happy to know that you can use spoons and forks if you want. And if you insist on eating using chopsticks (like I was), your attendant will be happy to teach you.

Moral of the story: I had sushi... i used chopsticks... and I am happy!

I have been to many places but this was worst.No wash room.They don't accept debit cards.The place was too tiny.This one rating just for the waiter.Otherwise it is Zero.I have decided to visit this place as there were too many good reviews.But the real picture is different.We were unble to find the place as it's like a rat hole and the name on the restaurant displayed in the dark.Food was horrible.Never coming here..

Firstly,I must mention that The Sushi Oke was my first brush with Sushi and Japanese food at a proper Japanese restaurant.I had had Sushis before but not at very proper places.I had found Sushis were a bit too bland and raw and the fish was smelly.In short I did not like it much and I could not explain the hype surrounding it.I generally tend to like or appreciate most different types of cuisines but Japanese and Sushi somehow did not fall in that category.But I was keen to give this popular cuisine a fair chance! So,with Japanese food gaining in popularity,my friend and I decided upon this place.

Located in Short street near the back gate of St.Xaviers we visited this place quite a few days back on a saturday afternoon around 1pm.When we entered,the place was quite empty.The interior is small but nicely decorated and does have a Japanese,Oriental feel about it.It can accommodate about 20 people only.The seating arrangements are also a bit atypical with no back rests.We came to know that they have opened a separate seating area adjacent to the original one to solve the space crunch and also to deal with the popularity of the place.The popularity of the place was evidenced by the fact that very soon we found the place absolutely full!

Now,coming to the food.The menu is a bit limited and offers various types of sushis and a few Japanese and Thai main course items.Our order was as follows-
1.Boston Roll Sushi
2.Salmon Nigiri Sushi
3.Japanese sticky rice
4.Chicken teriyaki
The sushis arrived first and quite swiftly too.They were served with wasabi and soya.The presentation was really nice and appreciable.Both the Sushis I must admit were very well made.They did not smell or taste raw.Yes they were a bit bland but the wasabi and the soya more than made up for it.
Then came the Japanese sticky rice and the Chicken Teriyaki.The sticky rice was just a minor modification of the normal plain rice I have at home almost everyday! That was a tad disappointing.But it went well with the Chicken Teriyaki nonetheless.The Chicken Teriyaki was two generous pieces of chicken in a very tasty sauce.It was more familiar to our taste buds.

The prices though lower than the other places for Japanese are still quite high.I somehow feel Japanese and specially Sushis are a bit overpriced in general.
The service is quite swift.The waiters are very helpful and are extremely well informed about the menu.

Now,the two big drawbacks of this place were-
1.They do not accept credit cards.
2.There was no proper place to wash hands even!
These are issues the management needs to look into.Although I do not know if these issuse have been taken care of by now.

In short,I am personally still not very fond of Japanese cuisine but that is just a personal choice and no blame attached to this place.The Sushi Oke is a very good place for Japanese food and Sushi without any doubt.Those who are fond of Japanese are sure to enjoy this place and for the rest this is worth a try!
Enjoy! :-)

I've overeaten here multiple times before writing the review. Must say sushi's are excellent. The veg options are great. Excellent options for other Japanese dishes like the radish soup and yakitori vegetables. Ambience is also nice and the owner/chef is also often at hand to take the order or suggest items.

The Sushi Oke

I have been having a Sushi craving for a long time and since this is a fairly new place,so I decided to give it a visit. What I expected based on reviews that I read on Zomato was honest good japanese food in a fast food type of atmosphere. What I got was honest good Japanese and Thai food at standard prices for such fare ( not too expensive but not cheap either ).

Update on the Restaurant - They have started a separate little seating area where they serve Thai and Japanese food. The decor is less authentic and more seats table and a mirror on the wall to make the restaurant look huge. The introduction of a separate thai menu with authentic Thai Dishes is a welcome addition, one which this city surely needed.

Food - The menus are small and limited. I had a huge craving for Salmon Sashimi and Ugon, both of which were missing from the menu. So I ended up ordering 
1. Nigiri Salmon Sushi - The sushi was small ( 4 pieces ) to be honest compared to what I have had at restaurants in Bangalore and The Wall in Kolkata. The taste was SPOT ON though. No different from the Sushi you would get in say a Harima in Bangalore which is a Japanese owned restaurant so is defined by the word authentic. The Soy sauce lacked a kick to it and I could barely taste its flavors through the Sushi ( I dip my Sushi in Soy Sauce and apply a big blob of wasabi to it). The wasabi was nice, and I loved the first spicy hit I got from it. It reminded me how much I love wasabi.

2. Phad Thai - This was a dish of the Thai Menu and I just loved the sweet spicy and nutty flavors I got in it. The quantity was quite good and the glass noodles silky smooth. The paste of crushed nuts just added a layer of texture to the phad thai. A very satisfying dish.

They need to expand their menu to really attract Sashimi fans like me who just love the taste of Salmon with Soy Sauce. The fare otherwise is quite good. The one thing I love the most is the fact that every single dish has a Vegetarian as well as a Non-Vegetarian option to it.

Opinion - The fact that every dish has a veg and a non veg option makes this a top pick for all those non-vegetarians with vegetarian friends who you always wanted to take with you for a Sushi Session

They need to expand their menu to really attract Sashimi fans like me who just love the taste of Salmon with Soy Sauce. The fare otherwise is quite good. The one thing I love the most is the fact that every single dish has a Vegetarian as well as a Non-Vegetarian option to it.

Opinion - The fact that every dish has a veg and a non veg option makes this a top pick for all those non-vegetarians with vegetarian friends who you always wanted to take with you for a Sushi Session

After reading the reviews on Zomato, my wife and I went to this restaurant which is very conveniently located (Behind St.Xavier's) and ended up being pleasantly surprised. The place has about 4 or 5 tables and the waiters are very courteous but they do not have a washroom. Considering they are a Japanese restaurant and they serve Sushi which is also a finger food not having a washroom is a major drawback. When we told them we want to wash our hands they took us to the kitchen sink which was piled up with dishes. But we got to see the kitchen which was clean and hygienic. I suggest you carry hand sanitizers.

The food is good. They have quite a decent menu. But I failed to understand why they don't serve Sashimi. I was really hoping to order some but was disappointed. So, we ordered two Maki Sushis - California Roll and Norimaki Roll, a Nigiri Sushi (Salmon), Chicken Teriyaki and Sticky Rice. The Sushis were very well prepared and with the condiments it brought out the right flavours. You may order extra Wasabi if you wish. I strongly recommend the Nigiri Sushi, it was heavenly. The Chicken Teriyaki was well cooked, the texture of the meat and the sauce was just perfect. It goes very well with the Sticky Rice. The food is definitely at par with many Sushi restaurants in the country and is very affordable. I'd like to try everything on the menu because I'm sure they'll do a good job. This place is definitely on my list of places to eat in Calcutta whenever I visit the city.

I give it a full rating. the place looks authentic and cozy. the cutlery used is something even Zen is not using. the pricing is extremly cheap for sushis. and the sushis itself is genuine and complete. the management and waiter are polite. only one thing is missing is that they dont have credit card service till now. which is a minor issue. 

Other than that this place did really surprise me as the food is just mouth watering and oh so fresh that you must over eat if you are a sushi lover like me. the menu too is good with a good variety in veg as well as non veg.

over all i would love to visit this place again and again.

I love sushi and I try to indulge in good sushi whenever and wherever possible. Hence you can imagine my excitement in discovering Sushi Oke on Zomato. I had to have a go.

We arrived around 1:30 in the afternoon and it was largely empty. Undeterred, we ordered some Miso soup, California, Alaska and Prawn Rolls along with some Chicken Yakitori. The service was prompt although during the wait I noticed some flies buzzing around on our table. The Miso soup was shockingly un-Miso soup like. The bits of tofu that floated around looked disquietingly like a Kindergarden student from the opposite school had crumbled some of his eraser into the food. Apart from that, there was little else in it. The flavour was nothing to write home about. 

The sushi itself left much to be desired. I couldn't tell the rolls apart due to the almost negligible amounts of salmon / crab and prawns. And in true skimping style, whatever was present was pasted into the cucumber and tightly wrapped in a disproportionate amount of sticky rice. The wasabi had a good kick. The chicken Yakitori was overdone and dry and tasted suspiciously like the chicken thats chucked into roadside chowmien stands. This hit us up for 1500 bucks (for two).

Overall, disappointing food and overpriced for the quality they offer. I'd rather pay more for the real deal and come home satisfied than visit Sushi Oke again.  BLAH.

This is probably the best Japanese restaurant in town. Keeping respect for the wonderful food of wall and other japanese joints, I must admit I have never been offered such wonderful shushies and soba in kolkata. Very authentic, like we always eat in Japan itself and craved in kolkata. Their menu is not very versatile. Only a few options to choose for. But, they know how to prepare and present them. Hats off Shushi Oke. Definitely a 4.5/5 from me.

This is probably one of the best restaurants serving Japanese cuisines in Calcutta. I inquired about the Thai food, but they had not started with Thai when I went.

Nevertheless, I can vouch for the Japanese food. I was actually craving for some Spam Musubi (a Hawaiian version of Sushi) and found this place. The Maki-Sushi they serve is exactly like the Musubi we find in the US, with smoked salmon in the core.

We also ordered Chicken Yakitori (skewers with special sauce), Japanese Sticky Rice and Fish Teriyaki. All items were delicious and fabulously done. I will definitely like to visit this place in recurring.

The decor is well done.... nothing extravagant, but perfectly symbolizes the oriental style and idiosyncracies. Loved it, actually.

A couple of downsides: 
1. THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CARDS (had to deduct 0.5 points for that)!!!!!!! 
2. I went there late in the afternoon. So didn't have to face the crowd. But in peak hours, this place might be pretty crowded provided that it's accomodation strength is quite meagre. 

Saying that, I like this place much more than a lot of high profile eateries in the metropolis. These days, the Sushi Oke is the synonym for great Japanese food for me.

Tiny little place, I would not call it cozy as such, but it is rather quaint, and a good place to go to with friends. Now, for the food - I love the way cooked sushi tastes, so I was quite happy with what I had here - I had the chicken tempura sushi rolls and the spicy mushroom sushi rolls. yes, a tad expensive for the quantity but hey, better than the one other place I have had sushi at - both taste wise and prices. Then we had the most divine main course - the soba noodles floating in a delightful, lightly spiced broth, with prawn tempura. We felt so healthy after eating! We finished the meal with an apple pie icecream which was a delightful surprise - the subtle taste of cinnamon blended with the dominant flavour of warm apple pie was delicious! 

Will go back, this time to try the thai section which came highly recommended but was alas, shut even at 2 pm.

A quaint place that's cozy and serves amazing food is what sushi oke stands for.  The salmon nigiri is really nice along with the sticky japanese fried rice leaves you wanting more...I personally loved it that the place wasn't full because it just made it more cozy...however sushi oke will surely see me again...its a 5 star rating for food...only down side----they don't take debit cards and they do not have a loo for the guests...all that is there is a service bathroom that's at best, dhaba class...which is sad. Purely on food and ambience, sushi oke is a double thumbs up

I was recommended by another food connoisseur to visit this place which serves sushi that comes closest to the actual Japanese delicacy "sushi'. And i would say, i was not disappointed. 
The place looks nice, feels a bit Japanese with those rectangular framed frosted glass doors(which is the kitchen) and the sitting arrangement. The people out there are very hospitable and amiable. They helped me and my friend have our first ever sushi in the perfect manner possible and also helped us choose the best dishes out their varied and confusing menu.
We had -- Chicken Yakitori, Prawn Tempura, Salmon nigiri sushi, Smoked salmon roll and sticky chicken fried rice with tofu. I absolutely loved the taste of salmon nigiri sushi! it's really good, a subtle taste , different textures and the dip in the wasabee and soy gave a pungent hit to the palette that the fish and rice mellows down. The roll was good but i felt another nigiri would have been better, as the roll had relatively more rice and less fish. Chicken yakitori is splendid, their "special sauce" was indeed special! i couldn't get enough of it! Prawn Tempura was also beautiful, it melted in my mouth and had a lasting taste. The "sticky" rice was ok-ok compared to the rest, would not have made a difference if i wouldn't have ordered it, it was okayish, nothing worth of a special mention.
The price is a bit high given the monopoly in what they are serving(sushi).But once you know what to order , it is fine.But do know they still do not accept cards and the nearest ATM is quite far away.(Though a friendly staff accompanied us to the ATM without any second thoughts.)
All-in-all, hitting the place again soon for quenching some sushi craving and it is guilt free as 1 salmon nigiri sushi is only 61 calories !!!
My suggestion would be that their menu must have graphic detailing for newcomers and also the place must finish its decor more aptly with the Japanese theme to give a warmer welcome.

This is one must visit eatery for all those who need to dig your teeth into Oriental food. A comparatively small (serves at max 20 people when in full throng) yet warm layout that takes u to the setups that u must have savored in Korean/Japanese movies. Food is REALLY awesome..Maki sushi and sticky fried rice are a must try. Right from the Teriyakis to the complementary sauces..this place epitomizes taste. 
The only spoiler being the inconspicuous location of the restaurant that is bound to get overlooked especially keeping in mind the college crowd that hovers around.  
And for all those who are skeptical about chop sticks being the only medium between your mouth and food...RELAX!! They provide you forks and spoons too.
A cent percent vote and a definite recommendation to the Japanese food lovers.

First time for me to have sushi in a less known place, as i am perpetually afraid of the fish quality, especially when raw. I ordered a Boston roll, and must say, was much better than my expectations. Next up, I ordered a vegetarian sticky fried rice. Amazing, though salt could have been less. (This, coming from a die-hard non-vegetarian.)
Cons. Seating could be better, because if a short person is accompanied on the same side by a tall one, he cannot take the settee front without posing a problem for the taller one.
Service was not up to my expectations for such a small joint. One does not expect oneself to go to the kitchen and ask for the bill, at all!
Though overall, I'd say this place sure is worth a visit!

I really liked the experience yesterday night at Sushi Oke. Interesting food - smoked salmon and chicken teriyaki suhis, sabo noodle with prawn tempura and sticky rice. Owner Karan is well informed and customer friendly. Prices are fine though credit cards not accepted. Also, some menu like Thai not available. On the whole, quite a nice quiet place for out of box meals. Recommended strongly

Let me at the outset warm readers that this is my first interaction with Japanese food, so I did not know quite what to expect and even more, have no platform for comparision. I will base my writing on my observations. My two friends who I accompanied were seasoned though!

This place is a small cosy 4-5 table restaurant opposite St Xaviers. Low seating without backrest. There was no place to even wash our hands, pretty odd for a restaurant, and my friend was given a finger bowl prior to eating. One of the small rectangular bowls for sauces had a musty smell, either from the cleaning cloth or from the soya sauce :)

I did not dare try any of the raw sushis, so opted for the cooked one. Tried both the salmon (I think) and the crab-meat sushis. I preferred the latter. We then have the prawn tempura, nicely batter fried prawns. I have a feeling the prawns were not deveined, but I cannot be sure of that.

Final course was the Soba Noodles. I would heartily recommend this. A large bowl of brown soup (I am sure a lot of soya went into it) with a breast of chicken, mushrooms, some veggies and noodles. It had a slightly burnt and pungent flavour. Please try it out!

We were the only guests at that time. The owners were happy to explain the food and suggest what to eat. I found the food a tad expensive... Rs 300 or so for 4 pieces of sushi!

Trying sushi for first timers is ideal at this place. It's well decorated, in line with Japanese decor. The owners are usually present to help you with selecting the cuisine. Prices are reasonable as compared to hotels serving this cuisine. Two issues are absence of wc & wash basin and  lack of a credit card machine!

The place has got a nice vibe to it, just like the small japanese restaurants in Nagoya and Tokyo.

The food's pretty decent by the indian standards, though lacks the complexity in taste as per the real Japanese cuisines. 

People well traveled overseas might not enjoy it as much, still worth trying for sushi lovers in kal.

This is a place where you get authentic Japanese  food. I just arrived frm mumbai and craved for sushi, so headed down to this place. I was awed by the cute tiny little place and the cute interiors. It was pleasant and clean. I wasn't expecting much from this place but it too me by surprise. 

I had the fish teriyaki, chicken satay, prawn satay, tofu bags, inari sushi, California roll and the soba noodles. The prawn and the fish teriyaki was salty. But the soba noodles were excellent. Tofu bags were surprisingly good too. 

I will visit this place again for some more sushi. And will try out some more dishes. People should try it out for the sushi cuz for the other dishes you need to acquire taste. 

Oh and the packing is really cute!!!!

I love sushi, absolutely love it! In fact, I think this place is quite a nice place compared to spending more money on sushi at The Wall. For 350 Rs. for 10 pieces of sushi, it is absolutely worth it. The only bad part about this place is that they only deliver at home. It would be amazing if they could open a restaurant where you can sit and stuff yourself with sushi.

It was a great surprise to find a sushi place in Kolkata. I was skeptic about the hygiene, as any one else would be to have raw fish in a tropical climate. Hygiene did not turn out to be the disappointment at all. 
I ordered some Hand Roll, Salmon Nigiri and some Miso Soup. The food was a shame in the name of sushi. The salmon was COOKED. It was heartbreaking and I felt cheated. I have no idea how others have rated their sushi good. Whatever they served was not sushi. It was poorly prepared "shari" with some stuff. I adamantly refuse to call it sushi. I have had better Futomaki which is a week old. 
The Miso Soup was a disaster as well. Miso soup is probably one of the most delicate soup in the world. Whatever they served was overly salty and overpowered by the use of poor quality miso. 

At the risk of being repetitive, whatever they served was not sushi.
