This take away snacks eatery is situated at Bhawanipur.

Ambience is ok with no sitting arrangenents.

Quick service & nice staffs .

They serve desi snacks at an affordable price . Tried their hing Kachori and lassi. 

Both were awesome .

They need to add more items to their menu.

সকাল এর শুরু টা এরকম সুন্দর কচুরি খেয়ে করতে পারলে বাকি দিন টা ভালো যেতে বাধ্য , আর তার পর যদি একটু লস্যি হয় তো কথাই নেই ...। বসার জায়গা নেই তাতে ক্ষতি নেই দাড়িয়ে খেয়ে পেট এর সাথে মনও ভরবে ।

A lovely place to have Kachuri. Tried the Hinger Kachuri with the divine Gulab Jamun. Ended the feast with the most comforting Lassi. Service was quick. Reasonable pricing left us all happy souls in the end.

Ordered hinger kachoris from this place for a Sunday morning breakfast at home seeing such rave reviews.Well.. wasn't disappointed at all.Best kachori and alur tarkari I tasted ever till now.The kachoris were crisp,big in size and delivered hot.The alur tarkari was flavourful..the aroma was tantalising.They also provide pickled chopped green chillies for people who like it spicier.Did not click photos this time since everyone was hungry in the morning and we got busy eating.Will surely upload next time.

Takeaway outlet with no place to sit. Very small and serves only kachori, singada, gulabjamun and lassi. Service was very quick. Friendly staff and ambitious & hospitality was very nice. Come to snacks kachori and singada both were very spicy, true desi and very tasty served with aloo sabhi and chatni which were also tasty. In sweet and refreshments we have Gulab Jamun and lassi both were very delicious and refreshing. Right choice for desi breakfast and quick snacks in bhawanipur. Recommended to all.

Amazing kachoris you get here!!! The best I have tasted till date! The chutney and the mirchi just add to the flavour! I'm salivating as I write this review! :P Every time I visit, I always have their kachoris and end my meal with a tall glass of thick cool lassi! The best, thickest lassi in town, hands down! I'd recommend this to a friend over and over again!
