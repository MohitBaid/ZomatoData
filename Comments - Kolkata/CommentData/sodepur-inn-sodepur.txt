We ordered tanduri roti and murg darbari...taste,quantity,and quality are quite good.bt ambiance was not up to mark.the AC was off when we entered,they turned that on after 8/10 minutes.waiter's behave was not welcoming.they just served the food and gave the bill,when we asked for that....mean while,waiters were busy in their phones.did not even asked us if we need anything or not..... pocket friendly though.....

They took 150/- per plate for Chicken Biriyani. Believe me the quantity is apt for two persons. 

Will rate 5 out of 5 on quantity. Will deduct few points since it was too spicy and oily.

No doubt the food was very much well and good in both quality and quantity..  I ordered food for home delivery.  But food comes  30 minutes late and the delivery boy(more precisely uncle) does not return my exchange money and promise me to deduct that money from my next bill...  So please friends carry penny if your bill is in a fractional figure..  Because '' Amr kache খুচরো পয়সা nei'' this doesn't make any sense..

Sodepur inn is overall good. But I don't say very good. Visited here many times as it is near our home. But visited at the lunch time; at that time they didn't allow us to seat at the first floor ac dinning room.Maximum food items of the menu card was not available. The service was also not good. But the food quality is good. They also provide a good quantity. The biryani of sodepur inn is the best biryani of Sodepur. Also tried the rolls. Egg chicken roll is too good in taste here.

Restaurant was stark empty when we moved in. Half of the menu not available. Sad that we counted on ratings in Zomato. Biryani was lukewarm. Even the card machine was not working. The service is poor and the excuse is that staffs are leaving for better offers! Sad and really bad experience on an otherwise nice evening.
For all of you, please don't go by the prices written in the published menu here. All are manipulated. Like Mutton Biryani costs Rs.210 and not Rs.170. At this cost, it's always better to try Aminia/Arselan

ONCE GOT INN-SIDE...

As a small food joint beside Pantaloons, this place offers a good alternative for a quickly decided eating out plan. For those seeking classy, fine or refined dinning, this place is a strict no, however. For a casual goer, one can easily dig into it's staple items - Biriyani or Chowmein.

I was so much tempted to give a negative feedback until the food was delivered to the table. To start with the negative points, I would say the interior needs serious upgradation. It is a small joint, with accommodation for about maximum 20 people. The tables were small and very closely placed to each another. It would be very hot inside during summer and they need to have AC. There is no washroom and the only functional basin is very much repulsive to look at. But, the positive points prevail. The price for all items were very much reasonable. Serving time was very short. I ordered butter tandoori roti, chicken do piyaza and cold drink. Foods were awesome. I was surprised to see the quantity of chicken do piyaza and it's unbelievable that the dish cost only 150 rupees. It could easily be shared with another companion. They also didn't compromise with the quality of food. So, I will definitely recommend others to visit Sodepur Inn and if possible, get their orders parcelled. They do have home delivery option too..

This gem of a place is possibly one of the best restaurants in the area. Food quality is absolutely brilliant, however the Biryani serving sizes are too large, one plate can feed 2. The joint being a small one, you can experience the Love and passion put into making the food come out just perfect. The Mutton Biryani there is possibly the best in all of Sodepur, and I highly recommend it.

However some cons include the total lack of air conditioning, and the overall size of the restaurant can prove to be claustrophobic. But if you can overcome that feeling, this is one of the best food joints I have ever been to in my life, and needs better attention.

I want them to give it 3.5 but giving 4.0 because they needs motivation and inspiration from us... they are trying very hard to develop themselves... 
We went there for a Sunday dinner... at first we entered there non AC section, but they guided us to the AC section which was upstairs... 
After entering we found it's quite a large place for accommodate at least 30 to 35 person at a time...we got our seats and one of the staffs presented us menu... after going through that we place a mix an match ordered... 
1. Crispy chilli babycorn--- It was crisp but the babycorn was stale, and the babycorn taste sour, allover it was a flat dish... the starting was disappointing... we complained about it...
2. Chilli garlic chowmin--- It was a okish type of preparation... it also smells little wired to me... but my family members enjoyed it pretty much, so doesn't say anything... but I'm sure there is scope for improvements...
3. Chicken with vegetables--- These one was awesome... and gone perfect with the chowmin... a must try... Although it has same issues with the babycorn...
4. Spicy chicken kabab--- Another lip smacking dish... though it's a very common one... a tandoori chicken with a spicy sauce over it... but it was very good...
5. Murg kulchan--- It was of the menu... and it's was just excellent... just go for it... a gr8 dish for spicy people...
6. Chicken bharta--- Very tasty...
7. Garlic naan--- very fresh gone well with the above two dishes...
Whole meal was accomplished with Thumbs up and sprite...
Staffs are very courteous... Although they can improve themselves... service was very decent...
Now coming to the bill... it came very fast and with a Rs 50 off... asking for reason they said as we found the babycorn not up to the mark, that's why they given us the discount... Very good approach I must say... that's the reason I given it 0.5 extra...
Pocket pinch was very friendly here... 
Overall a very good experience... Only thing I think they have to work on there Chinese section a little more...

Okay people Biriyani may taste good at this place.. But one day when i bumped here for a dinner date,first of all there were no staffs to greet us.We entered and kept on waiting for some good 10-15mins before someone finally arrived to give us the menu card. We ordered for Tandoori Roti and Chicken butter masala. They took like ages to serve the dish.. Arghhhh! Finally when it came the chicken was not succulent,wasn't even able to tear it.
Had to finish up wid the gravy only.
Such a bad experience. I won't go ever. Spoilt my date! -_-

This is quite a big responsibility being the first person to write a review. Being in Sodepur for all my life, I haven't been here earlier. Decor is pretty nice, considering it's a new joint. Extra points for the servicing and nice behavior. I have only been to the AC area of the restaurant and could understand that the lack of space can be an issue. 

Must try the Mutton Biriyani. Yum, delicious, fresh and yum again. I have had the veg pulao and boneless chicken, very tasty. Taste buds might differ for you people, but if you've ever been here, do try them out this Puja 2015.
