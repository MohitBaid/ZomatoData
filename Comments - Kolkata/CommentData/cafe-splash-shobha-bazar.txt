শোভাবাজারের ওপর একদম রাস্তার ধারে , ফলত পরিবেশ বিশেষ ভালো নয় । স্বাদ ভালো হলেও খাবারের মানের দিকে নজর দেওয়া দরকার । বসার জায়গার অভাব । কোল্ড কফি আর স্যান্ডুইচ খেয়েছিলাম , মাঝারি মানের লেগেছে ।

A road side cafe eatery located near  lal mandir, Shovabazar, North Kolkata.  Only veg items are available. Good for a quick bite. Limited sitting arrangements. Tried mix. veg cheese sandwich and it was delicious. Pocket pinch is normal.

Tried Cheese Masala Vara paav , which was pretty average.
Cold coffee was not that good. Overall an average satisfaction.

Tried Cheesy pasta in white sauce & Cheese Garlic bread. Both were average, nothing special.

Price is reasonable.

I visited this place when I went to Modi House which is close by. The food here isn't good. I tried their Sandwich, it lacked everything. Cheese, Meyo was very less. Price were also high as per the quality.

Cafe Splash is just off the main road. The don't have any good seating arrangement inside. Sells mostly Snacks, cold drinks. I had Cheese Sandwich here which was very average, price also seemed to me bit high. The ambiance is shabby and i am sure there is nothing to like it. They also sell ice creams.

When we were students, we used to search for places serving delicious food at a pocket friendly rates. We didn’t care about the AC, the seating arrangements or any other fineness of the outlets then. What was important was good food and cheap rates. And once we found one, used to spend hours there in groups. Many memorable times were spend in those places, where, most of the times, there were even no proper seating.
                                                ...

This is not a proper cafe or restaurant, but a small eatery operating out of a garage. Seating is basic stools inside and some chairs outside on the footpath. Service is a bit slow, but friendly. 

This place mainly caters to students. In that category it scores really well. Cheap and tasty food. Tried the Cheese Garlic Maggi, Cheese Masala Vada Paw and Wai Wai Bhel. The Cheese Garlic Maggi tasted garlicky enough and had sweet corn kernels. The Cheese Masala Vada Paw tasted yummy. The Paw was buttery and the vada was really well made. The cheese and spices balance was also great. The Wai Wai Bhel was ok. If the onion and capsicums pieces were cut bigger, it could have been better. Also I felt there should be more onions in it. 

The coffee here was decent too. Not too sweet and light.

If you are around and want a quick bite this is a good place if you have no problem with the lack of proper seating.
