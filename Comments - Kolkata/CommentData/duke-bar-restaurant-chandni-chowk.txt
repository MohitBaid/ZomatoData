Have had their fish and chips a couple of times. Tastes good. The size of the fish is good and they had packed chips separately in a packet which i really liked.

Duke is situated right next to Chandni Chowk Metro Exit and I got the recommendation from a friend about their fish items. This place has a shabby ambience and the staffs are not prompt at all to their job as you have to literally get up and call them to your table. I ordered beers and those were cheap. Ordered one crispy fried fish item and that was pretty good. The other item I had was crispy chilli baby corn and that tasted average.

This is one of the places in central Kolkata, where an array of lip smacking snacks (especially fish dishes) are available along with some serious cheap booze. And, the good part is, they use Vetki for fish dishes and not basa (which personally I hate). I've tried Fish Salami there, which is basically a fish battered fry )with thin batter with chilly and coriander chopped in the batter) and it was good. The Mourola Veritas (god knows why the strange name) was perfect for a booze snacks. But, best of the lot was the Indianised chilly shrimps. It was a perfect mixture of stir fried capsicum, onion julienne and fresh water shrimps. The green fish (whole boneless vetki was average at the best and a steamed version could've been better. The mutton liver fry was good though. The place is slightly cramped up and full on the office day evenings. 

Overall, for a party with friends and parceling the food back home, is a nice joint.

Ambience - Nothing much to expect..Pretty small one with clean table and cushioned sofa style sitting arrangement. Not very spacious. 

Cost - Pocket friendly for professionals but not at all pocket friendly for students.

Adjacent to the Chandni Chawk metro station, this orchestra bar is just perfect for real cheap booze! When I say real cheap I mean it! You might not like the ambiance as it's quite depressing and full o sad souls, especially the retro RD Burman classics the singers perform live! Well don't expect much from the food menu as I couldn't trust a place who serves cucumber as chakhna!!! Still I really enjoyed the boneless dry chillichicken.

This is situated opposite Hindusthan Building, Chandni Chawk. Two floored Joint. Ground runs normal bar and the upper runs Singing Bar. 
It's not at all a restaurant. It comes under category of a bar primarily which serves Chinese food too. 
Very much affordable price for Drinks. 
Food is not at all good except dry chili chicken. 
Too much oily stuffs.

Duke is one of the oldest and value for money place for the people who prefers drinking. 
Located just near to the chandni chowk metro station it is a very popular place for the office goers of that area.
Ambiance is not that great and family audience are a strict no no as they will not like the shabby atmosphere all around. 
Go for usual starters specially the Chinese ones they are just about ok. 
All in all a place for the booze lovers :) That's all.

I went into this joint by choice just to kill some time before I board train from Howrah. In total, I had ordered 3 beers & no food as I had a strange feeling that food must not taste good here. Interiors were shabby, staff unpleasant & so on. RECOMMENDATION: NO

A nostalgic place of Central Kolkata.  A place for sumptuous food and homely ambience.  Must visit for every kolkata people's.
A place of intellectuals of Central kolkata.  Most of the writers,  novelist,  poets use to come here regularly.  A high cultural place.  I request  to visit this place once and taste the heritage..

I use to stay in Bangalore. After a while I visited Kolkata I call my entire friend and we decided that we will meet and have some fun. So we decided we will sit in park street I asked them where I will get some marvelous fish item one of my friends said I know a place where you will get a marvelous fish item and a good atmosphere. I said ok where it is he said the central avenue duke. At first I said no my friend assures me then I said ok. We 12 guys meet their in Saptami. Really, I am astonished their behavior, food quality just awesome, we feel like home Rabin chandro (captain) helps us a lot. Really their atmosphere is too good and their fish item is marvelous. Grill pepper fish is really hot. Afterward, I visit duke with my family and we decided whenever we will visit Kolkata we will visit duke. Thank you duke.

Duke is located on C.R.Avenue close to Chandni Metro and is one of those typical Tipplers spot..Not much to talk about the ambiance,it is one of those shabby, unhygeinic bar frequented by seasoned drinkers and office goers to enjoy their poison..A strict no for family visit,this place might get a bit creepy in the late hours.. 
The service is typical for a place like this..they will serve you complementary peanuts or chips and if you are a regular you do get a special treatment  else the staff will be quite indifferent towards you..
Coming to the food they serve a wide selection of Chinese and North Indian dishes..Chinese dishes are preferred and taste better..Food is just average cause for those who visit this place the taste don't matters much since they are always heavy on their tongue..Drinks is the focal point and is indeed very economical here..You will get large peg of VAT69 at Rs.210/- and Royal Stag at just Rs.90/-..indeed a pocket friendly option for tipplers in the locality with some decent enough food..
Food: 2/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 1.5/5
Ambiance: 1.5/5

A typical central kolkata bar, also provides live music, mostly hindi film songs. Not a bad place if you want to soak in the typical environment and ambiance. Food ok, service ok if you are lucky.

This restaurant is located in chandni chowk just beside "Chung Wah". It has a decent but shabby decor. With around 6-8 tables. They serve conventional north Indian and Chinese cuisines. As far as the ambience is concerned, being a bar cum restaurant, it mostly stays occupied by commuters and office goers for booze and the environment does sometimes gets awry hence it is not ideally a family restaurant where you can enjoy your meal in a homely environment. I have been to this restaurant twice or thrice being near to my Aunty's office, the quality and the taste of their offerings are around average. But they serve a good variety of starters and most of them are quite mouth watering, which is the only plus point I figured out from my prospective unless if I consider booze in a reasonable rate.

Fish roll, prawn balls and fried rice are my favourite here, although ambience and service have deteriorated so much with time, but as I see, the food quality is still better then others in the class. They serve a huge menu and Chinese and most of the starters are well made and tasty. Not a place for a family dining though, but, very good for a quick drink and bites.

It is a very good Bar & Restaurant located at the heart of  the city . I would like to give 5 star due to their good management, healthy and delicious food, family environment and top of the all their very decent Staff like Harida, Robinda, Joyanta Da and all. But very recently I was disappointed with some policy which management of Duke have which still fails in implementation.
