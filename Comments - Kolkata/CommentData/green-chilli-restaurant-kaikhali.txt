Although its a pocket friendly place , yet the taste is not up to the mark ..... The main course dishes ain't that good , but its a good place for snacks and stuff .... The size of their rolls are really huge and so is the quantity as far as chowmein is concerned , which I must say is far too much for the price they charge ..... Even their kebabs are good as well .... But if you are a hygienic freak , this place is surely not for you ,,,,,

Food is average , ambience is average, if you looking for fine dining type of service then this place is not for you. So its typical budget restaurant. ..

This small eatery is very easy to locate. If you are too fussy about ambience and too much of oil in food turns you down, this isn't the place for you. It is a pocket friendly place to go to when you are actually hungry. All you need to do is order a roll, any type of roll for that matter and you'll be full for sure because the rolls are huge! I've ordered for home delivery a number of times and the service is moderately okay. The mixed chow mein, chicken tarka, mixed fried rice, chilli chicken also taste great. Since it was located near my college I've tried a number of items from this eatery and I was mostly satisfied.

While returning from my classes, I usually take a meal home, but, one particular night I was kinda full and thus opted for a pair of rolls. And, this urge of having a 'light' dinner made me visit Green Chilli Restaurant.

Located on VIP Road at Kaikhali, it is a hub of junk foodie. Although there were range of options available, I opted for egg roll only, without ketchup as I would be having it after a gap of at least quarter of an hour. Taking the order, it took them twenty minutes to prepare the food and hand it over to me. 

Coming home and freshening myself up, I opened up the package to heat it up and to my utter disappointment found that the roll has turn stale. The paratha has become rock solid and it was clearly evident that it has been prepared using animal fats instead of oil. Looking at the disastrous condition, I decided to have puffed rice for my dinner.

A true disaster is safe to be avoided!

I love to eat spring rolls. In our dumdum and kaikhali location there are only few food hut that offers quality spring rolls. Among them Green chilli is best and I love to be there always for chicken spring rolls and chicken lollypop. Very good service and price is quite reasonable. It's located near kaikhali bus stop, anyone can reach there easily.

The restaurant is small but you won't find any difficulty in finding this place. I've been in Kolkata for 5 years and I can't even count how many Egg Rolls I've had there. Maybe 1000+. üòç The rolls are big in size and you'll easily fullfil your appetite with just one. Taste and quality is all you can expect from this place. Please don't cry for Ambience here.

This Restaurant is good . Specially the Veg roll they made is really mind-blowing . And ¬†also food was good according to price . The service is quite good as we always used to visit the restaurant. 7 times a week i use to go their as this restaurant is ¬† cheap and also the owner of this Restaurant gives huge discounts to us . Manchurian is the dish i always prefer and Tandoori Roti is also good there not like ¬†Chennai restaurant. Service-4/5,Rate-4/5 ,Roll-4.8/5,Dishes-4.

I tried tanduri chicken from the restaurant. It was really delicious and the pieces were big enough. I can say this restaurant does not compromise with quantity as well as quality. Price was reasonable. They delivered my order within said time. Though the restaurant is good,it should be little spacious.. But you can take the food at home at enjoy the taste...

ok for quick bites. tend to be high on oil. also, use of artificial food color in mint chutneys served with tikkas. Rolls are tastey..not sure if use of animal fats as the cause..main food items are ok types.

We had once opted for a takeaway since it was rush hour and no restaurant was willing to deliver. As much as skeptical we were, we were surprised by their taste. It was not bad neither extremely good but okay! Can be tried..!

A pocket-friendly street joint serving  quality fast food.. recently tried their chicken tikka masala and crispy chicken. Didn't have much hopes about the food as the place looked a little shabby.. but to my surprise the @food tasted satisfactorily yum.. so overall a nice take away experience.  Would like to try out their butter garlic fish fry the next day.

A pocket friendly restaurant.Best for take away ,because the place is not at all spacious and clean.Mughlai paratha and kababs are their speciality.The food tastes good and I am rating completely on the basis of their food's taste,not the restaurant's ambiance.

Simply good, it's a no fuss heavy food joint. The chicken roll at 45 is a sheer treat. Rich in chicken nicely quoted in spicy masala and the laccha paratha enclosing it is also delicious. It's a quiet place but provides greatly to your famished stomach.

With the major restaurants charging as much as 1/3rd of your bill as taxes, this restaurant still is pocket-friendly. 
Order : Double chicken egg roll, Chicken biryani and Chicken tikka masala.
The roll was well made and tasty. But at Rs.85/pc its not so pocket friendly.
The biryani at Rs.110/plate it was very good. Though it was not as good as maybe Arsalan and soughts but it was good.
The tikka masala was well prepared with some pieces were too much cooked in the tandoor.

Overall Rs.1000 for 4persons wholesome meal is a good bet when you don't need a big hole in your pocket.

very bad. as a resident of kaikhali for past 20 years I have got a good idea of all the restrnts here. only good thing is egg roll but that is almost 150% costlier than siraj, haji or other heritage rstrnts. food quality is too bad. foods prepated in low quality dalda harmful for health and paratha of egg roll is too thick

while going to airport yesterday afternoon stopped here for a quick food as i had to travel a long way. Nothing to say about the place a small shanty type outlet with a few seating arrangements. Menu had a large number of items though, ordered chicken & egg fried rice along with garlic chicken and sprite (which was not available)  fried rice was better to taste but the chicken was salty and not good price affordable
