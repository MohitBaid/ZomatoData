Small joint for rolls and fast food.The rolls here are quite good,the momos are equally good.Service depends on whether the outlet is crowded or not.Overall it's a good place for a snack on the go.

Tried one egg chicken roll from here... it was good... nothing extraordinary... one of the pocket friendly option in the locality... staffs are well mannered... no ambience or deco... pocket pinch was friendly...

The kababs are wonderful,  they are tender and soft. The only place in picnic garden where you will get delicious kababs.  I wish to try all the kababs there. Everyone should try

Yesterday after office on my way
I tried a chicken roll which is stuffed with good quantity chicken & other stuff but the paratha is little bit hard to munch though they made it in front of me. So overall test was average on that price point. Staff are good and no doubt highly motivated. Their grill chicken items which was on display are quite mouthwatering. Definitely I will try it on my next visit.

There rumali roti and tarka are just awesome specially the rumali rotis are too soft the only bad thing is just that they not provide home delivery at little orders

I have ordered from them several times already.They make stuff like Egg dopiyaza,egg masala,fish masala,chicken and mutton briyani,mixed hakka noodles,paneer matar,and tarka and rolls,which aren't available with most other eateries here.the bread department has rumali roti and lacha paratha in the evening and naan and tandoori roti and kulcha all day.

however,be wary of chilly chicken and fish fry.these are some potholes in their culinary setup.also if you ask for vegetable pulao,youâ€™ll be served something at rs70 which is almost identical to their veg briyani that comes at rs 50.
But perhaps the most invigorating reason to avoid them is their astonishing lack of professionalism.They mess up the bill almost every other time.If you call them,you aren't offered any respite or resolution.If you return their product,the owner shows up at your door,insisting that whatever fault there might have been there with the food wasn't a reason enough to return a food item.I had to call my security the last time.

In other words,if you don't mind a time to time drama,and you're looking for home delivery at reasonable rate,this might be your place.Otherwise at the same price,just revising your order a bit,you can order from places like little china town or preity's, who act responsibly when commit a faux pas and have more than a semblance of customer service.(check their price rates at zomato,it isn't much higher than rock and roll.in some cases,cheaper too.)
