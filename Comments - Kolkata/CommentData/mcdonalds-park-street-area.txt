Best place to feed your self with fresh burgers. There is nothing special about those burgers yet it tastes amazing. The Mcfloat and McChicken burger is my favourite. I visit it quiet often.

The first thing that will strike you about this place is the ambience of the place. Its different, more legacy and less modern.¬† The food is standardized and the service is quick. Most of the times it is full.

Nice place for a good chat with friends and lip smacking food. Particularly the soft serves of this place are a personal favorite. However, the upper part of the 2 storied seating area mostly remains booked for private parties. More lighting is needed in the ground floor eating area. Friendly staff and card is accepted.

Yet another McD review. This place is located at a distance of a few hundred meters from park street¬† metro and is generally filled with people. However it is quite spacious so brownie points for that. 

As far as the food and service is concerned, its standard McD, so there is nothing much to write about. Step in if you want formulaic hygienic commercial fast food which doesn‚Äôt blow a hole through your pocket.

McD Park Street is one of their best outlets in Kolkata. This place has a huge sitting space. Their service is also quite good. I love their french fries and Chicken Maharaja burger. McEgg burger is also a good option. Their soft ice-creams are also yummm!

Being one of the favourite outlets of Mc Donald's, it never fails to fulfill the cravings for French fries and burgers. The chicken wraps are personal favourite and so is the Mcspicy chicken burger. A casual meet over burger and fries are enough to fill you up. Though it stays crowded, seatings are available within few minutes. The service is quick too.

Hate the fact that McDonald‚Äôs Kolkata doesn‚Äôt serve peri peri fries all season. Beside that Chicken Majaraja is probably the best burger available in McDonald‚Äôs.
Chicken nuggets is my favourite too.
Apart from that, McFlurry is actually the reason why I go to McDonald‚Äôs very often but they get sold out very early.

I visited this particular McDonald's on 25th December. Hence I would write in favour of McDonald's as it's hard to maintain the rush during that time. The seating arrangement is good so as the staff is knowledgeable and helpful. The only challenge was the bathroom wasn't working and it was very difficult for a women. So keep that clean and in working condition.

Be it McEgg or Mcflurry or Maharaja
McDonald's is everyone's favorite.

Try out Mcveg if you are a vegetarian or McAloo tikki is even better.
But what i insist to try upon is Mc Chicken meal it's worth every penny.

Price - 400/-INR for two

This place was about 15 minutes walk away from my office (when i was in park street) and that was the sole reason why I used to drop in any time during the day. However, slowly this place became a spot for our "after-office" addas over burgers, french fries and cold coffee. I have lost count of the number of times I have visited this place. I have tried almost everything from the menu. Cold coffee and fries are my staple (oh! I really miss the peri-peri masala that they used to give with the fries..McD kindly bring it back!!!). I loved McVeggie burger, McAloo tikki, McEgg and Chicken McGrill. The soft serves are really good and i also liked the breakfast menu and happy meal (I still have the barbie toy phone i got!!).  Although it's a bit difficult to get a seat on weekends...but overall, this outlet is a nice hangout zone.

MacDonald's the name is enough to send chills to your taste buds and digestive system. The quality of burgers, French fries, mcpuff served is nothing short of pathetic. Whenever my friends insist on going to MacDonald's i pray to God that my stomach responds positively to the offering. Even though the food pinches low on your wallet, the following check ups at clinics ensure that even 5 star meals are inexpensive.

The service is as fast as the stomach cramps which appear after eating.

This particular Saturday when I was out there with my friend, we were disturbed 3 times by a supervisor, as they wanted us to share the 4 people dining space with another couple. What I noticed was that we were the only ones among others, who were asked to accommodate! And in the meantime, my coffee, brewed cold. The manager was kind enough to replace the coffee.

I write this review wuth writhing pain in my stomach. Please avoid visiting. üò¢

Maybe it was because I was dining alone.

As for the food, it is pretty good.
Would appreciate if the burgers served were warmer.

Pretty mild on the pocket.

The park street outlet is by far the most beautiful McD in Calcutta. in three levels this place give you the space you want.Cheerful staff, clean surroundings and beautiful balloons for takeaways- I love the experience at this place.

McDonald's has never been much of a craze for me. Had visited this place for a birthday party. The service is excellent here, and arrangements too. Don‚Äôt really prefer the snacks here. There isn‚Äôt anything special about the burger but French fries are good. It is a perfect place only for group gatherings. Otherwise, Park street has several other eateries for a sumptuous meal. Good luck to the team anyway!

If the day hasn't turned out very well, McD is the first thing that brings a smile to my face. The park street outlet is by far the most beautiful McD in Calcutta. in three levels this place give you the space you want.Cheerful staff, clean surroundings and beautiful balloons for takeaways- I love the experience at this place. In the mornings this place just gets better with all the peace in the world.

This place isn't very far from the metro station, it's opposite to flurys. The restaurant is good, won't provide you a very classy ambience. A simple place. Good for hanging out. The food delivery time takes 15 mins. Food was good. Pocket friendly if you're running low on money!

FINAL VERDICT- A decent place to hangout with friends and enjoy some quality burgers.

If you want great burgers this is the place you need to be . I have visited this outlet a number of times and it's the best place to hang out.
The service and ambience is great. As far as the food goes the burgers are just WOW. The Mc Chicken, the chicken maharaja mac and the mcspicy chicken burgers are too good. A meal includes the burger along with cold drinks and french fries. The egg and veg burgers are also good. The mcflurry is awesome.
This place is a must visit if you are looking forward to some amazing burgers.

McDonald's üòÉ a huge fan of the Mc Chicken meal with cold coffee. Their fries are very well seasoned. The BBQ sauce accompanying the chicken nuggets is  too good. 
The only folly is the service isn't consistent. The last time I had gone the manager refused to accept a note because it had something written on it which I had nothing to do with, he came up with an excuse that his bank doesn't accept written notes. After arguing with him for 10 minutes he agreed and took the payment. I mean why harass your regular customers without a reason?
But today the service was good. Enjoyed the Mc Spicy wrap! As well as the Mc flurry Chocolate crunch.

Food Mobs are again in action with their one of the evergreen treat homes "McDonald's".
This is one fast food restaurant which has maintained its food quality from the very beginning.Be it the McAloo Tikkis or new additions to the menu, McDonald's‚Äã never disappoints.
More interesting to see is people from all ages come in here and share the love of junk food.

Few things about the food :

1. Veg Burgers are not at par in taste and handling as compared to Non Veg Burgers.
2. Filet o Fish is the best of all time and beats any Non Veg Burger hands down,So make sure you always have it available for delivery as logistics took a hit my last order.
3. Chicken McGrills and Wraps are all good,but extra cheese and mayo kills the base flavours and become overpowering,So try different cheese and season the mint mayo properly.
4. For god sake - Who asks for a buck for chilly and regular ketchups.Need to grow up with more dip options.

Rating Reasons :
Overall 4 since i mostly order Non Veg Options.
3 if we consider Veg.

Taste : 4

Classis feel but dying slowly : 4

Non Veg Burgers and Wraps : 4

Veg Burgers and Wraps : 2.5

Need more options : 10

Time to rebrand and revive it : 10

All hail the legendary mcD for giving us good burgers all these years. An all time favourite place for burgers, and the fries are true love. Gluttony lovers paradise is what you can call it. Haven't tried all of their burgers, but the mcaloo, veggie, mcchicken chicken nuggets, are my favourites. :)
They were a good stress buster during exams. ;)

Among all the Mc Donald's outlets in the city, this one is my absolute favourite.
The interior of the eatery is quite big, spacious and it has got a positive vibe which makes it extra special..
Though its my fourth visit over here, i am reviewing them for the first time today..

Me,and my friend went there yesterday to satisfy our hunger pangs..
We ordered

1) MC CHICKEN MEAL
2) MC CHICKEN BURGER
AND 3) CHOCOLATE SOFT SERVE.
We got a medium sized chicken burger, one medium french fries and one iced tea..
I opted for the iced tea, there are also cold drinks available for the combo..

Now, coming to the burgers. MC DONALD'S has always been my favourite for their fresh and good quality burger..
The patty was soft, juicy with crunchy lettuce and cheddar cheese and i loved the burger.
The french fries on the other side were crunchy and not atall soggy and oily..
The ice tea was good, nothing extraordinary..
I really like the soft serve.. Although it is just normal vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce but it is way more tastier than its description..
The pocket pinch was about 400, which is quite pocket friendly. The staffs are always very cordial and efficient and the service was pretty fast as well.

Overall, Mc Donald's has always made me happy with their burgers.
There are some new items in their menu so definitely coming back to try them out and definitely recommend this place to others.

Mc.Flurys Oreo and the new one black current both were great... Though l would like to give a slight higher rating to the latter one. And of course how can l miss the cone ice creams.  Enjoyed this place and would love to visit more this place.

This outlet in park street is a big one. The ambience is nice. There's nothing to say about the food. It's always at it's best. There's this one disappointment though. Every time I've been here, after 7 o'clock in the evening, ice cream is unavailable. Always. Other than that, there's absolutely no negative point. :)

Burger pang continues and it landed me n my friend in this outlet as it's near our workplace. We ordered two McChicken and Two Soft serves. Even if the burger tasted okay, not bad. I didn't find any zing or flavour burst at all. Patty was crispy but it lacked seasoning for me. Soft serves were good, what to say about desserts!

Among all the McDonald's outlet in Kolkata, this particular one located in Park Street is my favourite because this was the only place other than Flurys which use to open at 8am in Park Street. Thus it was very convinent for me to grab something filling and affordable for my morning breakfast before college. Also it has a huge space divided in 3 floors with a sophisticated ambience and can be easily located opposite to Flurys and Au Bon Pan.

One of the biggest McDonald's I have been to in Kolkata. I love their seating arrangement. My absolute staple favourites are the Chicken Maharaja Meal and the Fish o Fillet meals. I also tried out their Chicken McNuggets which were really good. Moreover, their French Fries are the best I have had till date.

Location: beside Bar BQue, opposite Flurry's
Likes: Seating Arrangement, Fillet O Fish, Chicken Maharaja, French Fries
Dislikes: on a busy day u get slow service and the place might be a bit untidy, washroom is very dirty and the taps don't work half the time
Must order: Fillet o Fish, French Fries, Chicken McNugget

One of the worst MCD I've been to. Extremely slow service. Doesn't feel as if you've entered such a reputed place otherwise. I visited this particular outlet on a normal Tuesday evening. The place was quite empty so there was no question of waiting.... or so I expected. But to my surprise, there were 4 counters empty and and one counter open for orders. The person behind this counter was so slow that automatically after a while there was a queue. On my questioning as to why the other counters weren't functional, the manger said "No, only this counter is open ". 
Extremely surprised at this kind of operation in a place like McDonalds where fast service is there so call USP!

I have never been a great fan of McDonald's specially after numerous burger joints have sprung across all over the city. Good enough for a quick bite if you do not have time for a proper meal. The chicken maharaja Mac is the best in the menu followed by their well seasoned golden fries. The double meat patty with the sauces are good to bite into. The Chicken McGrill is sad and dry and their nuggets chewy and rubbery. This place also has a separate party area which hosts birthday parties. The happy meals along with the toys and everything makes those birthdays quite memorable. Staff behavior is very cordial and warm. Pocket pinch is average although I don't  believe it's always worth the money.

Finding out yourself with a seat is one of the tough job here. It's always crowded... I visited here during Christmas time and I hope you can understand what I have gone through... Brusting crowd but still I saw the patience of the people working here taking order without confusing things and with a smile all the time.. food is a little lower graded as I have just visited KFC there and found things better. But Mc. Is crowded and pocket friendly as well. Just the need to serve a little better food.. and above all they must do something to make their French fries little crispy as I found them very soggy.

McD's is McD's. No comparison to anything else. However I always find the McDonald's here in India to be of a lesser standard than compared to overseas. This branch is one of the better ones though. It's always crowded so I'd recommend getting a take away. In terms food, everyone has their personal favorites, mine being the fish burger and fries in particular.

I have been a regular to this place right since college days but have slightly shifted my loyalty due to KFC now ! Its almost impossible to find a place to sit here in the peak hours and getting a parcel too takes some time. Like to have the Chicken wrap wid cool large coke with. Burgers are as always good. ¬†McDonalds retains the same child/family friendly theme, making it a happy place to dine. Prices are good too. Great place to hangout with friends.

I love the interior and ambience .. It is spacious than other outlets of McD .. We had gone for breakfast , so we had ordered egg sausage burger which was good but tastes like regular burger .. The blackforest sundae was good but it was too cold which overpower the taste of it .. The aloo petty was also good with the crisp :)
The tea was however perfect
.
Overall its good :)

Didn't have a very sound experience over here. The staff are well mannered, but the service was very slow. Ordered a chicken mcgrill, wasn't impressed at all. The quality was very average compared to the pricing. Also ordered some french fries and a sundae, the fries were good enough and the sundae was the show stopper. The rates are pretty high when it comes to McDonald's. Won't be saying anything more.

McDonald's burger are worth having. I visited to thier outlet at Park Street with few of my friends and had Chicken Maharaja Burger and Smoothie Ice cream. The Maharaja Burger was delightful, came in a box huge in size. The chicken inside tasted good enough. The second bottom layer has a thick coating of Mayonis and Yellow Cheese piece. The overall thing was good to taste.

As soon as you enter the place,you will get the nice aroma of food! The newly introduced pizza mc puff is pretty good..french fries are also good.But their mc chicken burger is very average kindof and I would prefer the KFC zinger burger over this any day.Their nuggets are also very average..nothing great.But prices are lower compared to other fast food chains and the meals are value for money.

Went to this park street outlet of McDonald's with 7 of my friends today evening. This was much much bigger than the other outlets I have visited. They even had an upper tier for accomodation. Being Christmas season, the place was fully packed up, buzzing with foreigners as well as locals. However the behaviour of the staff were quite informal. We decided that half of our group would be seated while the rest half will be going to place order, since the counter was far away from the table and there was a risk that we might lose that empty table owing to the huge rush of customers. But he didn't allow us to do that. He said we can only sit; only after we come with our food. Henceforth we left the place with a very sour experience.

Ambience s nice . But the Burgers are served cold and soggy , also most of the time they are either out of the dessert or some of the drinks available there. Also Happy meal has a different toy than the one on display which is not accpetable.Have been to this place several times but I dnt think I will continue the same as d consistency in quality is dropping day by day.

McDonald's has always been the hub of "adda" for the students not only because of it's pocket friendly menu,but also cuz of it's lip smacking and delicious combos.

I ordered :-

(1) Mc Spicy Chicken Burger Combo

(2) Spicy Chicken Wrap Combo

(3) Filet-o-Fish Burger Combo

I got not only the taste of juicy and crispy and well seasoned chicken patty of the burger with the rich creamy mayonnaise but also enjoyed the salty fries served with it.

Put your taste buds into a roller coaster of heavenly taste by digging into the burger along with the fries!!A true foodie soul can never say no to crispy and salty fries when it comes to munching on their burger.Put the fries into the patty and yum...welcome to food heaven.

The crunch of the fresh lettuce,the tang of the mayonnaise and the smokey and spicy flavour of the chicken patty will leave you hungry for more with every bite you take.

Now,the Spicy Chicken Wrap is a must grab for the one's who prefe@r a healthy veggie diet with good protein.The chicken is grilled and smoked and put with a combination of spicy sauce and loads of veggies such as onions and tomatoes.The chicken is one of a kind seasoned with spices and adds to the heat when you take a bite.

It is wrapped in a beautiful thin layer of chapati and is soft as air when you take a bite.Soft on the outside and devilishly spicy on the inside.

The "Filet-o-Fish" is an absolute delight for the one's crazy about sea food such as myself.The filet is really very soft and tender and it melts the instant you take a bite.Soft,tender and astoundingly different from the traditional burgers.Who would have thought fish can go so well as a patty.A must try for all the fish lovers.

Overall a decent menu put together and definitely a treat for the taste buds‚ù§

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

I just love this place. Ambience is great. Food is top class. Great place for a hangout. The meals are enough to satisfy your tummy. This is one place I have seen a 70 year old enjoying as much as a 5 year old. 
Only once I was rather irritated with the staff. There was no water in the washroom and the staff were least bothered. Barring that, every visit has been great. My personal favourite is the Mc Maharaja.
The fries are always great.

Not many places in kolkata you can go for a breakfast   but McDonald's is one of the rarest of them all.

The food the seating plan the soothing behaviour 

All make your morning experience really good.


A very good price is charged always a good value for money. 

Nicely planned interiors add yp to your experience. 

Very crowdy during college time but still you will be able to get the best place of your choice

My first McD experience was in this place with my Dad and sister.

Staffs here are friendly.
Last year during this time, I guess, they introduced this McFlurry Blueberry Brownie of which I was a fan!
I came in like 4-5 days in a row in one week to have that heavenly dessert! Sadly, soon they discontinued serving it but it remained the best McD dessert to me by far!

I like their piri piri French fries which is quite spicy nd for me its the best thing for visiting any McDonald outlet. I also like their ice cream which comes with chocochips nd Oreo in it. The taste is very good. The burgers are tasty having really large chunk of chicken in it. Would give totally a thumbs up to McDonald.

This was the first McDonald's outlet to be set up in Kolkata and I've visited it innumerable times. I really like the ambience here, it's a buzzing place and crowded most of the time. Why wouldn't it be when it is so pocket friendly and the service too is very swift. It is a very spacious outlet in three levels...
one level is where you place the order, another where you eat and the third is mostly kept for private parties.I like most of their stuff, which I being a vegetarian can eat, favourite obviously being the burger and fries. Their meal combo is very economical. I also love the desserts that they have as well as the peri peri fries.
A great place to go to when you don't want to spend too much yet want to chill out with friends.

This is another outlet of McDonald's  located in park street. Went there on a Sunday evening. The indoor seating of this outlet is awesome as it is very nicely decorated. It has that aristocratic touch. Just loved the ambience. We already were filled so we just ordered soft serve in chocolate flavour. Nothing new to say about their ice cream. A portion of vanilla ice cream with chocolate topping. Ice cream was great in taste and that thick chocolate topping, jus,t loved
The staffs were very well behaved and they served us with a smile on their face. As per my opinion McDonald's is that one place that serves burger, fries, coke and ice cream at such a reasonable price.....

Want a good burger? Find another place. Simple as that. Don't get carried away by the media hype on a global scale. If you are craving a burger in Park Street and don't know where to go, simply cross over to the KFC outlet on Middleton Row.  Better value for money than McDonald's.

This place has got 3 levels. The bottom most level for placing the order and the first and the second level got the seating arrangements. I always like sitting on the upper level, which also offers for private parties for occassions likr Birthday and all. This outlet of Mac D is my favourite of all. As for food, well nothing new to say....a burger, a drink with some fries... well, who wouldn't want that?? And of course..not to forget their yummy Softies and desserts!!

That is what comes to my mind for their burgers. However the ambience is nice for sitting and chatting. The points r all for the desserts. They are really nice. I hope that something is done for their signatures i.e. the burgers.

Have been a frequent visitor to this place, it being quite good for breakfasts and pocket-friendly.The place is good and spacious, the staff courteous. I prefer this McD joint over the many others that I've tried.

On my recent visit, I tried their Mc Egg, which is by far the cheapest non-veg burger in town, and so juicy and succulent from the inside.The cold coffee was a great accompaniment, along with their hash browns and French fries.
A hearty breakfast... Oh, what a start to the day!
            

Oh! And also can you imagine a dessert being spicy!!There's the Chilli Mango Sundae ;)

While penning down a few words about a big American fast food brand's flagship outlet in Kolkata, the story remains incomplete without the relevant facts associated with it. And when in comes to McDonald's, the Park Street outlet happens to be its flagship, with a huge and completely different interior. 
The reason behind the interior being unusual, may be known to many, but for those who are unaware, it should be shared that, the place/property where McDonald's stands today at Park Street, once belonged to "HOTEL BLUE FOX", a vintage restaurant of Kolkata, closed down during early nineties.

Service is prompt, and seating capacity is huge, and food is as per the standard served in any other McDonald's outlet. Being located in a premium area, it attracts a lot of footfall too.

Overall, a nice place to grab a bite, specially during sudden hunger pangs.

Located at just near to Bar B Que . At the Rainy afternoon last week went to this place with few of my friends. Having a long discussion and fun filled moments. This place is quite big as for the ambiance is concerned. They also have a party space on the upper tier and quite decent sitting.
Had a Combo meal here with One Veg one Non veg Burger with French Fries, a veg roll and Two cokes. Burgers were spot on with the taste but the french fries disappointed a bit. Veg roll was okeyish.

Being in Park Street and imagining all the well renowned food chain not being available is really difficult, but, this was actually a headache few years ago when Mc D in Kolkata ceased to exist. This outlet is the oldest in Kolkata and well, located in the well renowned area.
It is very spacious and the staffs are too good to speak the least. The services are faster than other other outlets which make them grab a niche above others.
The food as usual are really great maintaining the usual Mc D standards. There ain't anything more to add owing to the fact that it is similar with other outlets in the town.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Definitely pay them a visit and get yourself treated like a king.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Because they are kind of best in class in town ;)

It took really long for mcdonalds to enter in Kolkata. This is the first outlet which was opened.It was closed for some months due to one fire incident. Very big and mostly crowded by family and kids... also, college crowd could be seen... Service is good and tastes wise its identical in every...east to get place here to seat as there is ample seating place.

Yes!! You must believe that it is my first time here. It was my childhood dream to come here. Though I have visited Peter Cat, Mocambo etc numerous times, I always felt that eating here is a waste of money. But today my misconception has been unveiled and I finally get to believe that this place is good. I ordered Mc Grill Chicken Meal. The burger was soft. juicy, tender and flavorsome. ¬†The decor is very good. The staffs are very helpful and kind. I had left my umbrella there and a staff came behind me on road and gave it to me. Really the restro has everything to become famous in culinary world.

What can I say that already hasn't been said by a million people across the planet? The Big Mac is as good as ever ! Always stick to the usual McSpicy Burger along with a McChicken , Medium Fries, 9-piece Nuggets and a Coke. Finger-lickin' good , as always :). Excellent service and polite staff make you feel at home. Offers a wide plethora of burgers(both veg and non-veg) to spoil you for choice. You can't go wrong with this place.Ever :)

McDonald's is a worldwide name for burger and meals! Situated just opposite foot of Legendary Flury's and beside of Vodafone store make this restaurant very easy to find!

It is one of the oldest outlet in Kolkata! Two floored, well decorated! Well trained stuffs and service is quick! Perfect place for family dining or Friend meet up!

They served lots of variety of Burger in both Veg and Non Veg section! Among all of them Chicken Maharaja Mac' is my personal fav item! Big in size and one burger is more than enough to fill your empty stomach! In meal package you will get French fries and coke with Burger! Try it!

I have been a McDonald's  lover since I was a child and since McD opened up in Park Street I became a weekly customer.
Sadly few days back a waiter had spoken to me very harshly. I was with my friends, and after we finished eating we were asked to leave, the waiter was very ill mannered and embarrassed us. Now I'd rather drive all the way to Mani Square to eat from McD than coming to Park Street McD.

After a quiet walk from Xavier's, we were so hungry and tired. It had been 6-7 years I didn't eat from a MC Donalds. I generally don't like eating from KFC, Dominoes or CCD. But this outlet really changed my opinion about MC D. We ordered a meal with large fries and coke. At the end we ordered a softy. This softy is the best ice cream you can ever have. The hot molten chocolate with frozen bites of vanilla ice cream is the best combination ever. The price is quite genuine and it was a good lunch. The park Street outlet is huge and people keep flowing in. However, I didn't like the Maharaja Mac(from the Mani Square Outlet). It's an unrealistic burger with two patties. It has weird green olives or whatever it was which I didn't like with mayonnaise spread. The burger was too huge to fit in my mouth and the mayonnaise was dripping out from the other side and it was all over my fingers. It was such a mess. It's really embarrassing to eat like that outside. At home you can eat whatever you want, no one will judge you. But outside, people will look weirdly at you if you lick the mayonnaise off of your fingers. And it's really weird when you have to wipe your mayonnaise laden fingers with the dry tissues. Not only that, the green lettuce leaves looked depressingly dead. There was one slice of tomato. And the patty didn't taste like delicious chicken at all. It felt like some mashed potato with flour and chicken bits. Apart from maharaja mac, everything else tasted better.

Mcegg burger is the worst thing to order.. I go to McDonalds only because of mcflurry which is amazingly yummy.. But disappointed with the supervisors behaviour at the restaurant who doesn't have the courtesy to deal with customers properly because he has to empty a section for a supposed birthday party! Kindly take a note of it.

This place needs no introduction and no reviews as per my opinion. Everyone has definitely had something from this place. McDonald's has been a pioneer of the fast food industry for quite some time.

LOCATION
This infamous joint is located in the heart of Park Street. Of course everyone knows that.

FOOD
McDonald's has quite good generic burgers and wraps. Their fries have to be the best ever! I have liked everything I've tried so far. My personal favorites being McSpicy Paneer Wrap, the Fillet-o-Fish burger and the Peri Peri Fries which are only available the latter half of the year. McDonald's also has pretty good breakfast! 
Their hotcakes with syrup and butter were so good! Soft and Fluffy, although I have to say they could have provided more syrup. üòë
I also tried the Supreme Veg McMuffin. It was like a burger, nothing like English Muffins. Delicious though, I am not complaining.
Their Cold Coffee was okay, nothing amazing, but considering the price it wasn't bad.
The hash browns are my favorite! 
I like how they have multiple options of drinks with their meals.

AMBIANCE
I've visited the place quite a few times, it's quite spacious. Not that ambience matters for me. I mean it's a fast food joint what can we expect? 

AFFORDABILITY
I think McDonald's is not extremely reasonable, although by no means it is expensive. 

SERVICE
The staff is quite helpful, their delivery is super quick. I mean they serve breakfast from 8:00 a.m and even in the mornings the deliveries are quick. 
I have to mention one thing though, the fact that Indian McDonald's Chicken is halal or not, is still a mystery to me. The staff says it's not, but I had sent a query to the website directly, and they say it is. Anyway I don't have Chicken here. I wish they would confirm and put up a certification just like KFC. 

I have put up a picture of the breakfast I recently had.

But, since I was here for breakfast, it needs a review.
A friend had spoken highly of the breakfast menu of McDonald's a short time back. 
But it wasn't as great as I was expecting.
I felt it was little too expensive and coke for breakfast. Naaah :/
The hash browns and the burger was no doubt good.

McDonald's is always overcrowded! Be it in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata or Chandigarh.. Anyways, this Park Street one also gets crowded especially in the evenings. Even if u are planning for a quick grab, it takes time as there's a long queue always. Generally, I feel McD veg burgers and French fries are the best. However, I find their chicken burgers dry. So I always stick to good old McAloo tikli only all the time üòÅ

Anyway, it tasted horrible. The veggies were not fresh, the chicken strip particularly tasted so bad.

One of the most famous and widespread food chains all over the world. This outlet,is ( correct me if I am wrong) the oldest one in Kolkata. Located at Park Street amongst the popular food destinations of fellow Calcuttans, this place has maintained it's own since it's inception. The interior is quite spacious and there always a huge demand. Not once did I find this place empty. It is always brimming with people. The staff tries it's best to give as quick a service as possible but falls short at times owing to the demand. I personally am not a fan of their burger ( because of the patty) but the maharaja burger is decent. I love the crispy French fries they give and also the aloo tiki is quite tasty, the ice tea is impressive. It is filling no doubt and economically viable at the same time.

Mcdonalds is one of those joints who are supposed to serve good burgers. Its a shame that one can get better burgers (far better) burers from other places. As for my experience, I have never liked McDonald's in India, outside India, McDonald's is far more better. 
Now coming to the food, the burger was okayish, nothing even close to very good. And then there was something that made me literally feel pukish. The veg pizza pockets or whatever it's name was. I felt it was stale and even though it mentioned it had cheese in it, it was dry like the Sahara and tased like sand. The French fries were horrible too. The only good thing was the coke, but McD doesn't make them, so no surprise. 
My advice to y'all is never ever try the veg pizza pockets(provided if you have no problem in feeling pukish). The McSpicy chicken is probably the only burger that is up to the mark.

Mc Donald's is one of the famous brand worldwide. They have been serving people all around for quite some time now and well we all know the rest of the story.

**Location**
This was the first outlet in Kolkata which is located at the bylane of park Street main road just beside the Barbque restaurant. Just at the opposite foot of Flurys.

**Ambiance & Decor**
Absolutely fantastic and very eye catching Decor all around this big sized outlet. You have got multi touch flavor in their Decor with some antique type designs all around and smart looking furniture have been used to justify the depth.

**Food**
Burgers are their forte as all we know. Other than that they serve you some other dishes as well. My favorites to be mentioned are 

Mcmaharaja Burger
Chicken mcgrill 
Mac aloo tikki
French fries are one the best they serve.
Ice tea
And
The brownie with vanilla ice cream

**Service**
Staffs are quite well trained and serves you always at their best. Quick and well responsive to your queries and need. Good one indeed.
Good luck and keep serving us even better :)

This McDonald's branch is located at Park Street, right beside B.B.Q. Not much difficulty in locating it.

McChicken Burger: Leafy lettuce, molten cheese, mayo and chicken patty stuffed between two pairs of hot bun.

French Fries: kept simple and served hot and crunchy.

You get the picture. 

The space is divided into two storeys. It is always crowded up in here. There is a lot of energy to this place. Service is prompt.

It was just another stroll down the sidewalk in Park Street in the morning and I decided to gorge in breakfast from the good old McDonald's. Amidst the crowd of swanky breakfast and tea spots mushrooming in every corner of the city McDonalds continue to stand for old childhood memories of a happy meal and the toy tucked inside it! I ordered mcpuff egg burger along with ice tea. No complaints about the food but its just that the place is insanely crowded that too in the morning!

I ordered Chicken Maharaja Mac and Chicken Nuggets through McDonald's Delivery App. The delivery was fast but the food was horrible. Instead of cooking properly, they burnt it. I was getting a charred taste. I wont order anything again. My rating is solely based on the taste of the food.

I have visited this outlet the most from all the Mc Donald's. ¬†I love the Mac Maharaja and when I am low on budget the Mc Chicken does it for me. The wrap is okayish, better to stick to the burgers and combos. Fries are crispy and seasoned well.

It was just another stroll down the sidewalk in Park Street in the morning and I decided to gorge in breakfast from the good old McDonald's. Amidst the crowd of swanky breakfast and tea spots mushrooming in every corner of the city McDonalds continue to stand for old childhood memories of a happy meal and the toy tucked inside it! I ordered mcpuff egg burger along with ice tea. No complaints about the food but its just that the place is insanely crowded that too in the morning!

it was dripping heavily outside, so we stepped in for a quick pocket friendly bite.
the place is on the main road, opposite to flury's and au bon pain.¬†

they really need to do something about the water logging in front of their entrance, which is really worse during the monsoons.

had Oreo mcflurry, chocolate brownie and two cones of vanilla awesomeness !¬†

desserts are moderately okay but honestly pocket friendly and apt for a sudden hangout.
this time i was already full , but next time surely gonna taste some of their burgers.

When McDonald's forayed into Park Street, it was the start of a new love affair with food. It is impossible for me ¬†to count the number of time I have been to the outlet and ¬†any and every celebration includes this place. Their burgers are out of the world and the prices are such that they cater to every pocket. Their muffins and wraps have also pleased the foodie inside me and I only search for excuses to visit the place time and again to savour the spicy and great food they offer. Another incentive is the great ambience on both the levels and the cacophony of the children during birthday parties is also quite welcome.

What can you really write about a food chain giant that hundreds of others haven't already written? McDonald's is like those food joints that's such a part of your daily system that you don't really think about writing a review for. But then, why not! It deserves one. You take an old friend, a lazy rainy afternoon, burgers and fries...and you get the perfect concoction for an evening well spent. Many might say the variety is limited. But when you have such delicious, easy-on-the-stomach burgers served to you, do you really need anything else?  Having tried the Maharaja Mac, McChicken burger, Indie McSpicy Chicken, Chicken McGrill burger, i can't really say i have been disappointed by any of them. Yummy burgers and add to that, coke and crispy fries.. It's a perfectly happy meal! And the best part.. You get a full meal that is not even heavy on the pocket ! Ting ;-)

From absolutely resenting gulping down Chicken McGrill (which I long believed was an alien piece meat made out of plastic in some dystopian factory on some planet) during college days, to absolutely loving Chicken McSpicy - my food journey with McD has been as long as its own in India. During all these years, Macdonalds India heavily customized to suit the Indian pallette, and in that, it ended up winning over Indian taste buds and spreading much more than its rival KFC (which is still stuck to Zinger Burgers).

True that the North-East India Franchisee fell out with Macdonald's India leaving so few centers in North as compared to their whopping ubiquity in South India ( there are only 5 Mcd in Calcutta, as opposed to 18 KFC-s), still the few that are left are quite spread out all over Calcutta and are quite nice. I genuinely hope they would open one in south Calcutta Gariahat-Ruby side, though.

Other than the McSpicy Burger, I also like the fries, esp with the Peri Peri Mix, and the Orea McFlurry. Here and there, I have had the Wraps and other things, but have ended up coming back to the McSpicy Burger.

Now, there's that question as to whether McD makes the best burgers in Calcutta (and the world) ? No. Like all chains, they serve pretty standardized above-average popular burgers, and like all aberrations to the fast food industry's hegemony, small stand alone restaurants end up serving the best-est burgers in every town in the world. In Calcutta, that place happens to be Burger You, a small takeway, running out of a kitchen behind Kasba Thana. But then there are days when Burger You serves burnt potato wedges and fries, something a McDonald's will probably never (or rarely) do.

So that's pretty much the difference between a huge multinational chain and a stand alone restaurant. Since I have no political or culinary affiliation to either this or that, I like both, knowing very well they are going to be different - and have my expectation moderated accordingly. So should you !

On a budget and want some deliciously fried food? Where better than here? Their fries are hands down the best in the city. I personally opt for either the filet o fish or big spicy chicken wrap but even their chicken burgers are juicy and have a decent quantity. The staff could be friendlier and the restroom isn't ideal. I wouldn't recommend it for a heart patient but it's great for a mid-college break!

Mcdonalds must have lost its sheen in Kolkata, otherwise why this outlet was desolate on Friday evening? Added to that I found the staff very unprofessional - they were not at all efficient. It was difficult to converse with them. Mac does not have a printed menu - you have gaze high up to see the glow board... not done!
I purchased a happy meal for my daughter, a takeaway - the packaging is awful! what is going on?
For me it was a big spicy chicken wrap - quite good. while I was there, another customer complained about the soft drink being toooo sweet!¬†
I could understand the reason behind the desolate atmosphere... other fast food joints are going whole hog to please and entice customers ...what is Mac doing?

This was my first McDonald's visit in Kolkata. I just love this place. Although very unhealthy food that would definitely lead you to obesity but who cares about that always?
Love the Chicken McTikki, Chicken Maharaja Mac and the Fish one. I also love their soft serves. Being a kid, McDonald's gave me happy memories of collecting toys when you bought a happy meal. It was a great time. And I loved it. Happy Dining! :)

It was a summer afternoon and I was highly upset. I was returning from Park Street after completion of a work. It was after ages that I decided to take myself out to McDonald's. It is opposite to Flurrys and just beside Barbeque.

All alone I opted for the chicken mc grill burger, cool drink and french fries to lift my mood. It actually helped. I suggest you to go for the maharaja chicken burger. ¬†As compared to KFC, Mc D is way much cheaper and this outlet has beautiful ambience though sometimes it's really crowded.

Good to go!

McDonald's burgers have a legendary status worldwide. However, I feel like it's time they do a shuffle in their menu and bring something newer. Undoubtedly the food is good, but it's time for a change. They should use more sauces and make the cutlet crispier.

I have been there for a small party on my friends bday we have gone for a long bill but the Pizza Puff destroyed the party mood as it was under cooked and soggy from inside we have complained this to their staff but they denied. But the nicest past was thy changed the whole lot of Pizza Puffs (about 15) and offered us with the burgers. The service staff was very nice and helpful. And coming to the rating the rating id for the service standard not for the food
Hoping to see improvement in the food standrds!!

Out of all the McDonald's, I prefer this one the most in Kolkata. Located in Park Street, McDonald's here has comfortable seating, primary location, and suitable opening hours. 

As always, my preference is Chicken McGrill Burger - it has the right amount of succulent chicken and tomatoes. I like the Maharaja Mac and McChicken burgers as well. I am not a big fan of the egg burgers, as I find it to be slightly bland in comparison. The softies in McD are not very filling, but are good enough. My favourite, of course, as it should be, are the fries. There is no place on earth where I have found better fries than McDonald's. 

As far as beverages are concerned, I like the Iced Tea and the Cold Coffee float (much better than just the cold coffee). 

Hope you have a good time! :)

Located a prime position in park street this outlet is always overcrowded. But the staff are well managed and courteous. The ambiance is simplistic with nice furniture. The place looks clean and hygienic. But the washrooms are dirty, something that McD should work upon.
Now the food. Well i love the aloo tikka burger. Its cheap, its delicious, its filling. What more do you need. Also their fish-o-filet is delectable. I do nit find the Maharaja Burger any great. Though i simply love the chocolate dip vanilla cone ice cream. It is totally mouth watering and will leave you wanting more.

This is one of the finest McDonald's joints I have been to. The food served is of top notch quality! Now I know most people think that the food across all McDonald's outlets is that same and hence it's going to be the same experience everywhere. But trust me, I have seen many outlets that are terrible and very disappointing! The food does not seem fresh, the chicken is not cooked properly, the buns aren't of good quality and well you get the picture!
Thankfully this outlet serves high quality food and the taste just seems a lot better! The staff is also quite courteous (Mind you, some are very sweet but some are more like "lets get to business" types who aren't sweet but nonetheless they are all courteous and that's all one needs). The ambience is also quite lively and located at Park Street, it's more often than not crowded as it makes a nice hang out place.
Well, this outlet is definitely one of my favourite fast food outlets and I love coming here again and again!

This brand is supposed to serve you the best Burgers but unfortunately they have compromised on the quality. They don't provide the veggies properly and patty lacks what it is supposed to offer. But I like theirs Filet o Fish and MC Flurry's. And I must confess that they provide the best French fries.

Probably one of those better Mc Donald joints! Although, this is situated in a much crowded area, which remains alive and on its toes, for most part of the day, this particular outlet, although situated right at the hornet's nest, offers a secluded and calm ambiance among all the hustle and bustle happening outside.

I have been here a couple of times and have found the service to be top-notch. Mostly went for their 20 piece Nuggets. Love the Barbecue dips and hence do not usually order for any other flavor. The nuggets are well made and I absolutely love their texture. Goes very well with the tangy sauce. A handful of fries and a glass of cold drinks, what else would I wish to have for a sumptuous meal?

The decoration and ambiance here is pretty classic. The sitting space is huge and widespread, and hence finding a place here shouldn't be much difficult. Their pocket-friendly prices make this is a must-visit place to come over here. :-)

How often does it happen that you visit a McDonald's outlet, and find something different? For me, this was the first time!
This park street has quite an un-McDonaldsy ambiance. The seating is a mixture of modern seating with archaic wooden interiors which I really really liked!
I was visiting a McDonald's outlet after a long time and had the McAloo Tikki, Veg McMaharaja and Peach Iced Tea. Food was great, really love their McMaharaja Burger!
You should definitely visit this McD outlet...just for the unique feel of it! :)

Here's an honest confession, I haven't been to this outlet since May last year, but I joined Zomato later then that....this particular outlet begs a write-up.....i have almost covered every possible item on the menu card during my trips all across the country and this is McD, they are damn good at what they do. What's special about this place is that this particular corner of park street has these series of outlets in this particular corner leading to Mirza Ghalib street, which inspite of the damn traffic outside gives you a cozy feeling especially in the late evenings bordering to an old world charm, i am so fascinated by that. Once you enter the joint, the wooden framed glass doors, wooden partitioning and furniture... all add to this old world charm and "so kolkata" feeling... for me more then the food this drew me to this place countless times, will make sure to drop in in the next few weeks....food??McD, love all the menu including the crushers and puffs.... :)

We ordered a new burger that they have launched "mc maharaja with corn and cheese stuffing" and indeed it was a huge burger with three layers of bread and two layers of stuffing in it and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found the staff very welcoming and professional too.. And burger lovers should definitely try this new burger..

Now this is one task which is really easy. Reviewing a particular McD and when it's the oldest and one of the biggest in Kolkata, it's truly an easy job. Their wonder burgers, the perfect French fries and amazing sides have always been a companion when it comes to food in every part of the world I've traveled to. The Big Mac being my favorite and a part of my current dp on Zomato is one thing that can cure my health anytime anywhere. 

Talking about this particular store, it's really well decorated with enough sitting capacity and a pretty fast service. I so live this place for no particular but all possible reasons.

McDonalds is comparatively one of the pocket friendly international food chain store.. I surely love the McMaharaja Meal with fries and coke, and also the oreo dessert.. Wifi is available, so check out if u need it, but the food needs some new introductions, they require to step up a bit i think.

The service that McD used to provide is no longer available. The quality of food has drastically come down. However, it is the best suited for Kids and Infants. A happy meal is what everyone goes there for! ‚ò∫

Recently tried the maharaja burger of McDonald's by far the best one till date.
Amazing taste and the qty is sufficient for a person who wants to have a meal.
The place is good as it's so huge that you will surely get a seat to sit even if it is crowded and the service is decent.

The ambience is nice, especially for hangouts. The decor has a bit of traditional touch. 

Food quality is fine and very quick service.
They have seating arrangements for both upstairs and downstairs. I, personally, prefer seating in the upstairs.

They give you colourful balloons and I love it. :D

The most good looking Mc D ambiance in Kolkata is the Park Street Mc Donalds. The restaurant is huge, and the architecture is pretty antique. The food is pretty much similar to any Mc D, but when you are in Park street, and you need a quick snack, you ¬†should visit this place!

So we ordered a Maharaja burger...a chicken Mc spicy burger....a brownie ice-cream...Mc flurry...
Maharaja burger is just big...other than that is not tasty at all...even they don't use pure chicken in filling...they use chicken mixed smashed potato...with a lil amount of mayo...with no other sauces!
Mc spicy is yum!
& Mc flurry and brownie is just delightful. :-)

One of my favourite outlets of Mc Donald's in the city. This outlet is spacious and the ambience is great here. The burgers as well as the wraps are as usual tasty. The Veg items on their list are equally delicious. The nuggets,   aloo tikki and other items on their menu are fantastic! Meals consisting of the burgers, french fries and pepsi prove to be a hearty snack and is pocket friendly too. Recommended.

This is a regular hangout place for me as it is close to college. The ambience is pleasant and the seating is very comfortable. I usually order the chocolate Soft Serve and Chicken Nuggets. Everything seems fine with this outlet of McD except that they give very little chocolate coating on the Soft Serve. Last time, when I asked if there should be more chocolate (because there is almost 50% more in the other outlets of McD), the person serving said that it will cost extra. When I mentioned about how it is more in other outlets without charge, she went on to tell me that different outlets have different rules. Like, seriously? Different outlets of McD have different rules? Then why is it that they vary the chocolate coating in that SAME Park Street Outlet, give more when they feel like and less when they again feel like it? And that doesn't end there. So I go back with my food and perhaps they didn't realise that my friends were still there, placing their orders, they start to speak behind my back.
Is this the expected behaviour of staff in the highly reputed McDonald's? I am highly disappointed with this specific outlet and would never visit again. I pay money for something and then don't get the right amount and on top that, the staff speaks about a customer in front of other customers.
Disgusting.

I love the ambience in this outlet. Jade green fixings around the tables gives the place a sort of character that you do the generally associate with fast food chains. The upstairs section is the regular run of the mill seating although illuminated by bright lights and is frequently booked for private parties. 
Coming to the food I am an ardent fan of their French fry and after heaps of it I still wanna have more!! I love McSpicy Chicken burger. Soft spicy chicken cooled down with a hint of mayo. The Maharaja Mac is huge and filling. I like the brownie soft serve. 
Service is smooth albeit the often snooty crowd.

Situated dang opposite to Flury's on Park Street, you can clearly make out the fast food joint. Had been there for a couple of times. Am not a fast food fan, and I have been here just to spend some wee hours before meeting up with friends

Food as normal as any other McDonald's outlet. I found the service to be quiet shoddy and slow. I am quite surprised to the fact that Meal Coupons are not accepted here. I have been to quiet a number of McDonald's in Bangalore, Delhi and Chennai. Everywhere they accept Meal Passes

Due lack of professionalism from the people behind the counter. Out of 3 counters, 1 was working on the day I was there

Typical McD.

Point to note, first one in Kolkata, probably the largest too.

The Maharaja Mac is pretty good. Taste wise its similar to any other McD outlet. 
Ambience of this particular one is better, the interiors are pretty tastefully made for a fast food joint.

I am not a big fan of McD or similar institutions, so the review might be a bit biased. Pricing is average.

I visit only when my friends drag me along.

Being a McDonald's lover since I was a child, I will not say anything negative about its food. My favourite is the spicy paneer burger, which is very much delicious.
The best part is that it opens at 8am early in the morning. So whenever I am craving to have a burger early in the morning...I can go and grab a bite. Another reason behind is that its just 5 mins from my place..haha ;)
Though if you thinking to enjoy your meal in a calm environment(you will not find it over here). You feel like...just finish your meal within 10 mins and leave, otherwise you will start having a headache! Being located in a porsche area, I am not liking the crowd.

I usually have the McChicken meal or the happy meal . The problem I have with the burgers is that the patties are too dry and I don't find the quality of the patty appealing. The lack of mayo and lettuce makes it even harder to eat. They are not really generous with the amount of mayo they put in the burgers. The french fries they give in the meal are crispy and tasty. The staffs are friendly . The ambience is nice with a huge space. Good for the eyes but I wish the food was better too.

Pros: Free half-hour wifi, McFlurry (strawberry+banana!), McCafe, and a bunch of options for Vegetarians, fast, and convenient.

Cons: It's a McDonald's, only chicken options for non-vegetarians, not-so-healthy food.

This place used to be a favourite of mine since a few years ago,it was one of the very few places in kolkata that served decent burgers.But now a lot of good burger joints have come up and McD is absolutely no match to them.Patties are thin,small portions of everything actually.You have to actually search for the lettuce and mayo in there.Not worth my money.

This place is situated in parkstreet. 2-3 mins walk from the parkstreet bus stop.
The place is spacious, 3-4 counters are working for the quick response to customers so not at all big queues even on rush days.
Quick delivery of the orders.
Though the place is having rush on the weekends. Still waiting for 10-15 mins gets u seated.
Plus the McDonalds menu which makes me say I am loving it. Paparapaa. ;)

This joint of McDonald's is located at a 2 mins walking distance from Park Street Metro Station, and beside Bar-b-q joint. Nice and spacious, the staffs are friendly, this place got around thousand footfalls daily, I usually have Maharaja Chicken Burger, French fry and soft drinks.

One of the must-visit places of kolkata. . Its value for money meals have attracted the customers since many years.  Probably it is the first Macdonalds outlet in kolkata. Not sure though.  The best part about this place is you can chit chat for hours and no one will anything until it's crowded. I have seen many people enjoying their meals alone, so whether you are alone or with place you will love it with pocket friendly foods.

FOOD - I have eaten Chicken McGrill Meal, McAloo Tikki burger and Mcflury Oreo till now. In the meal they include French fries and pepsi. French fries are to die for. But there was too much ice into the pepsi. I loved Chicken McGrill burger. Now comes MCFLURY oreo I would suggest to eat it when it starts melting otherwise it's a bit cold. I didn't like the McAloo Tikki burger. It was bland. Will try other stuffs in future. 
PRICE- Chicken McGrill meal costs 99 without tax. Mcflury and McAloo tikki burger costed 94 with tax. So overall pocket friendly amd affordable. 
Ambience - quite spacious and upper floor is reserved for birthday parties. It's a bit crowdy specially during Christmas and Durga puja.
So overall a good place to hang out.

It has huge seating arrangemnts but i stl fl tht thy shud kp the upper part open too when thr is no b'day or any sort of parties gng on, as it is usually crowded and gtng a table quickly seems to b difficult. One of the best outlet which serves yummy burgers with mayonnaise and french fries along with the mc flurry.. Have aways been a fan for the chilling mc flurry and it never lets u down! We also tried thr latest chilli paneer pockets which was great too.. Wanna grab a quick bite which dosent burn a hole in your pocket??? This is the plc where u need to go!!

Let's just say i have found an answer to universal human depression and angst and anger and intolerance that plagues the greater part of our planet. The answer, is food. The love of food in itself is a love that is in all measure a love so deep and so profound that it disallows any form of hatred to sink in. It is this love that got rekindled when i visited mcdonalds(the gourmets are already scoffing at me). It had been a while since i stepped inside one of these. Its a welcome change though. Maybe its just me who has crept out of the dark ages but the breakfast menu that they have is and i repeat earnestly is the need of the day when you have skipped breakfast. Taste is just right, to the right extent of filling you up and leaves you content. The meal is a winning deal in itself. All in all, thank you ronald. You just made my day. One grouse, introduce happy meals or deals in the breakfast menu.

The McDonald's at Park Street was the first one, and having been there on the opening day, I can assert that its the most popular and visited burger-joint in park street.
The burgers are obviously a hit, but some sweet-toothed people go specifically for the variety of desserts (McFlurrys and soft serves).
Its an inexpensive yet yummy way to spend an evening with friends or family.

It's service, the food quality they offer, the ambience, everything. All of us had ordered something different and the same went with me even. I had Grilled Chicken Wrap, Chicken Mc Nuggets-just loved them!, Mc Aloo Tikki. For Hot beverages I had Fresh brew coffee which was truly refreshing, in extra value meals I had Sausage Mc Muffin. I just loved it :)

So, apparently this was my 2nd visit..
This place is a perfect combination of good food, comfy ambience, light atmosphere and pocket friendly. 
We had 3 McBurgers, which were really good and french fries being crispy enough to satisfy our taste buds! The food here was served fresh, but a little lag in service or you can even frame as delivery. Otherwise, satisfactory!

Mcd has always been competitive with its product. There burgers are cheaply priced and few of them are actually good. Still remember the old times when i use to bunk my clg classes at xaviers and come to mcd to have a gala time with friends. Mcd french fries are my favourite , just the way i like it thin and crispy. The staff are always helpful, you can ask them to make your fries a little extra crispy if you need it. And then there soft serve with chocolate sauce is reallly awesome. I feel they add eggs in their chocolate sauce and thats why they are thick.

Well, there's always Hustle Bustle here and then this is the park street so that is normal I guess. Numerous visits that include having the breakfast offerings (Sausage McMuffin With Egg meal) as well as the normal offerings. Seating is a bit of a problem and you need the eyes of a hawk to spot one.
Service is as good any McDonalds's.

Have tried almost everything that's available here.. Right from the good old fries to the burgers, to the newly introduced wraps or the Mcflurys or soft serves and even the floats.. every damn thing under their roof! Nd to confess unabashedly, we LOVE them all..
Tried their latest Mcflury blueberry brownie nd the Mcflury choco crunch.. we both liked the former over the latter.. blueberry brownie Mcflury was a real yum.. Do try it out, all blueberry lovers!
The choco crunch Mcflury wasn't bad either.. chocolate lovers r gonna like it undoubtedly..
P.S. we both still love playing nd beating each other with the McD balloons.. we aint growing up, not so fast! :p

Whether you need to celebrate your birthday party or simply hangout with your group, nothing can serve to be a better place than this huge and cute McD outlet. Their service is what I loved the most. The centrally placed small hut is what draws me again and again (though I have never got the chance to sit there :( ). Coming to the food, if you are vegetarian than the paneer burgers are enough to suffice along with french fries. But feel blessed if you are a non-vegetarian, for the chicken masala grill burger is all set to tingle your tongue. Their egg burgers are also great but the fiet-o-fish gives a tough fight to other non-veg burhers.My caffeine addiction forced me to go for Cold coffee float ¬†and that was yummmmyyyyy. I could have rated it 4.5 or even 5, but there are lots of stuffs I still need to explore here. One thing I can be sure of is that foodies will surely find this place nice.

Located conveniently just opposite to the Flury's, this is one of those ol' spacious burger joints belonging the McD family. I have always found this place well managed with beautiful decorum. I absolutely love this amazing joint. People are well aware of the menu they serve in here. My personal fav burgers include the ever famous chicken Mc Maharaja, Mc spicy chicken and chicken Mc Grill. I love the egg wrap in here which is always deliciously done. The staff is polite and courteous. The best thing about McD obviously is it's low budget meals and burgers. McD is a boon for the student community. Give McD a sure shot if you have'nt yet (which is grossly uncanny). McD will make your tastebuds as well as your pocket superhappy. :)

I visited McDonald's, parkstreet 2 weeks ago.
The ambience was fine. I ordered 3 Mc. Masala Grill Veg, 2 Mc. Aloo Tikki and a cold coffee. The cold coffee had more of water content than milk. And its taste was pathetic. I complained about it to the staff there. The person had replaced it. But i would never try the cold coffee again.
Rest all were fine.
So, overall my experience was fine.

During the outlets opening we had visited and we visited time and again the service has been inclining towards the bad üëé
Although its a spacious and accommodating one. So a good place for a big group of people to just go and hangout.
The menu after coming over to India has grown a lot too üëå

VISIT
I visited this outlet on 30/05/2015.

AMBIENCE
Coming to the ambience,i would say that this is an aristocratic restaurant.The furniture used speaks about its aristocracy.The furniture,ample seating space,wide expanse of commuting space,myriad staff,multiple stalls to cater to the needs of the consumers,etc. adds to its brownie points.Further, this is located in the "life" of Kolkata-The Park Street.I don't think this restaurant could have done anything more to beautify its ambience.

FOOD
Coming to the food,i would say that i ordered for only a mc aloo tikki.To my utter surprise,the tikki was slightly different in taste and that too not for the better.The burger had satisfactory taste.It doesn't have anything unique although it is loved by many.It suits the taste of everyone as it is not spicy neither it is sweet.It is neutral in those respects.I would prefer a Mo-Burg to a mc aloo tikki which is much more innovative and lip-smacking than this one.Those who love spicy food a lot are not recommended to try this mc aloo tikki.It is generally meant for the kids who have an aversion to spicy food many a times.

SERVICE
Coming to the service,i would say that the service is quite fast.The staff is well-behaved and helpful at the same time.The staff is quite agile in taking down the order and was quicker in delivering the same.The staff was also seen transporting the ordered food to the table of a customer.What more can you ask?

RATINGS
My ratings are as follows:
Ambience-5/5
Food-4/5
Service-5/5
Value for money-5/5
Overall-4.75/5(19/20)

Well to start with there aren't much one needs to write about a global fast food chain like McDonald's cause everyone is well aware of the taste and details of everything served here..This review is written from a more personal point of view because I always loved hanging out with friends in this specific outlet..Just love the ambiance at this place,the decor gives you a classy and vintage look quite distinct from other outlets of McD,the seating arrangement is spacious and comfortable and the seats at the upper floor is always recommended..Have spend a zillion evenings with friends chatting over a Cold Coffee with McChicken Burger,Chicken Wrap or Oreo Shake..Its pocket friendly,not to heavy on your diet, and its full-filling as well..Plus the location of this outlet makes it convenient for everyone..The service is actually a bit slow at time given the crowds at this outlet,apart from which everything is just satisfactory..
Food: 3/5
Pricing: 4.5/5

Although this is quite an old place but they have done a fine job in maintaining it. I used to come here from my school days. The place serves burgers and fries the same as any other Mc Donalds in the city but the only thing I did not like about them is the rough behavior that some of their staff have sometimes. Other than that its a great place.

Can beat any fast food outlet when it comes to their burgers..but overall i think KFC has an edge as being much more popular in Calcutta..still the main difference with KFC is that MACD serves french fries for free which KFC does not..i am loving it ?

If I am not mistaken I think this is the second McDonald's outlet which opened in Calcutta, and not just in any area but Park Street. 
Calcuttans were waiting eagerly and patiently for a McDonald's for which they don't have to run to Mani Square mall and finally they got one! 
This place is indeed spacious but always always filled to its fullest capacity. Packed with screaming kids and loud teenagers this place is always buzzing with people. 
McDonald's has always been consistent as far as their burgers are concerned but I love their fries! 
I don't experiment much whenever I visit McDonald's I stick to my basic Mcchicken burger meal with extra cheese and no lettuce (yikes) the fries and drinks served is quite a filling meal. I am not a fan of their wraps, find them a little bit on the bland side most of the time with no seasoning.
Their mcnuggets are nice and crispy if and when served hot. Dessert section is pretty good and their vanilla ice cream with the chocolate sauce is a must try for all. 
All in all a good family place obviously worth a visit because out of all the outlets in Kolkata I think this is the best one.

McDonald's has introduced a new breakfast menu for relatively early risers and people on-the-go. 
We ordered the breakfast combo comprising of an egg sausage muffin, hash browns and a choice of drink (we opted for coffee). It was a standard McDonald's meal, nothing over the top but fairly good go-to option.

This is a destination for burger lovers. Though there are competitors in the market, McD has been serving what burgers should be like. The Maharaja Burger is a two storey burger, which deserves the mouth of a foodie. Combined with the Happy meal, which is the ultimate kids special. The McSpicy is a wonderful add to their menu. Have always loved to bite onto a McD burger. Quite hospitable staff and nice ambience. The centre seats here are amusing and gives a relaxing feel to the tired and hungry body.

Same old Mcd, the affordable and convenient option for students or the family place since kids love the concept of happy meal. Its a good option for a quick bite. They have introduced a nice breakfast menu, which I m big fan of. Their morning muffins which have better quality in terms of health are a variation of the burger. So wen u have a lazy Sunday and you are looking for a nice breakfast without spending much you know this is the place to call.

A tad bit more pocket-friendly than its next door neighbour, KFC. This outlet of McD at Park street, ranks a close second to KFC, as per my favourite 'fast-food joint' list. The staff seems over-worked, though. The food is good, and there are some healthy options too in the breakfast menu. Have had breakfast here quite a few times, and availed of special offers too, such as free burgers etc. What I don't like about this place are the screaming children who accompany their parents (somehow such people are hardly noticed in KFC). Similarly, McD is not as spacious as Park street KFC. It scores over KFC in one aspect : This outlet serves hot coffee.

The best thing about this McD is it's ambiance.

The ambiance is pure delight. Its made like an old school coffee shop, with wood work throughout.

The service is standard.

In terms of food, I had the breakfast menu. The egg burger was great and the pancakes were awesome. The coffee was very refreshing. The hash brownie is something I've never developed a liking towards.

This McDonald's outlet on Kolkata's food street needs no introduction. Quite spacious interiors, decent ambiance, seating across two levels,friendly staff, opens at breakfast timings-nothing much to complain about. Really?Hang on. On a fine sunny morning, when I had some time to kill dropped in to have my breakfast. I had ordered the non-veg combo breakfast- one chicken patty burger with egg, hash brown and coffee. To start off the burger was quite bland and chewy. I mean with stuffing comprising of chicken and egg it can't be that bland and flavourless, but sadly it was. The hash brown was crispy and not too oily. However the coffee was again a let-down. There was no froth in it at all. These days any coffee machine provides frothy warm rich coffee. But this seemed like the traditional home-made stuff. Taste-wise it was fine but somehow lacked the punch that one looks for in a morning brew.Maybe a bad-day for me.Looking forward to a much better experience in my next visit.

We indians are in love with ¬†Mc Donalds.This park street outlet is quite a big eatery and the mezanine floor adds to the glam effect.
The affordable(read-cheapest) fast food joint in Park street means happy us.
However,I have tried out mainly the signature Mc Donalds-a burger,fries and coke.
This is a good hangout for the students,and the service commendable.

Verdict-Must Visit.

Like every other McD in India. Only slightly better. We have all been there at month ends after the drinks have squeezed the last penny from your wallet and there's still a week for the salary to kick in. Pretty noisy because of the sheer number of people across the two floors on any given evening across the year!

Must say how the services have fallen. 

I ordered a chicken McRoyale along with a chicken Burger. Charged me 228 inr for no apparent reason. Gave me a bill receipt which only had the total without split up. 

Didn't give a single napkin. 

Oh and the most amazing thing is the cleaning gal was busy flirting with a customer. 

So much for McDonald's surprise on a Monday !!!!

One of the best McDs I have been to. Strategically placed in the ever busy park Street, it gives an awesome view of the same. The food is your default menu. The ambiance is great, with different kinda seating arrangements. There is this centre place, which is really awesome. There is also a seating on top, which is rarely opened, with a mirrored wall giving an illusion of a lot of space. We ordered a grilled chicken wrap, which was just not that great. The iced tea was a tad too sweet. The fries were awesome.

This is one of the first MacD joints in Kolkata.And also my first Mac Burgers experience.Its quite spacious with the seating arrangements divided in two levels.The upper level is the one where birthdays and other events are held.Otherwise that too is open to everyone.The bread of MacD burgers is soft and my favorite.I have had most of the items on their menu,my favorite being the Mac Spicy Chicken.I dont really like the puffs and wraps.The service is quick.Once we complained about the quantity of french fries.They had the grace to refill it with more without a question.This one is almost always crowded due to the excellent location on Park Street just beside Bar-b-q.Recommended for the soft non-chewy breads!Cheerie!

This place holds a very special place in my heart for an entirely different reason ;) and I think this is my most visited eating joint in kolkata. Mc Donalds and french fries+burger are synonymous.. I have tried almost all of their non veg burgers and for me all taste the same.. but I love them all! But the icing on the cake has to be the oreo icecream(I forgot the exact name though) I love it.. every oreo lover will love it and wait! Who doesn't love oreo? ‚ô•‚ô• the ambience is nice.. although I don't like the open tables and I have a special table for which I mostly wait before we start eating.. definitely a go to place if you love burgers :)  
Updated on 20/1/15- McD is advertising a lot about their double patty,but half the price burgers..So we thought of giving it a try. We ordered chicken mc spicy double patty one. But sadly, the patties have become so thin that I wonder how thin a burger with a single patty will taste! There was so taste of chicken in the chicken burger :( mc flurry(oreo icecream) is still the same.. yum yum.. will definitely go back again and again for that :)

McDonald's being one of the largest fast food chain restaurant in the world they have similar standard variety and taste. Ofcourse the menu differs country wise. I have been to all McDonald's in kolkata and mostly all in Mumbai. I love their coke float, chocolate soft serve & french fries with peri peri. For sandwich I prefer KFC and subway over McDonald's. However I frequent Mcdonald's more than the others because of its cost effectiveness. I could have written this same review for other McDonald's outlet too but choose this one because of its interiors. It's the only McDonald's which feels like a restaurant rather than a fast joint. Other outlets hardly have any thing special to boost about. I rate it 5 because it was my second home in my college days and have many memorable moments in their outlets.

One of the first mcdonald's outlet in kolkata, located at the heart of parkstreet just opposite flury's. I have been going to this joint since i was in primary school. It is from where i started to taste my freedom of hanging out alone and with friends. Always spent the maximum portion of my pocket money at this place. It is located which was previously used to be "blue fox" one of kolkata's nostalgic pub. These McD joint has a very distinctive decor of modern and vintage fusion unlike all other outlets in the city and one of the most spacious one as well. Now coming to the menu they serve, i guess there's ain't anyone who is unaware of it. Though to mention few of my favorites i gotta talk about is the Indian version of "Mac Big N Tasty" known as " MacMaharaja", that is one of my all time favorite burgers of MacD, something which sheerly pamper your tastebuds. Their french fries are as always served in their distinctive style. This is the place which can buy the teenagers like us freedom and pompous joy in our limited allowances and pocket money. 
Hallelaujah Mcdonald for making my schol life and now my college life worth cherishing.

Have visited here quiet often with friends.. Liked the burgers and everything.. But one thing I found that when ever I visit this place the upper session is always closed.. If you go in a group of 8 or so make sure you sit in the upper session.. I found that cool

So one of the biggest mcD out of all and the service is very effective undoubtedly! And without a doubt , too crowdy!!

 I generally have fillet o fish or chicken royal burger but this time, i had the chicken wrap along with iced tea ! I had the wrap along time ago and it was tasting just the way it was before! No complains ! The main disappointment was mcflurry(oreo)! Frankly i didnt like it much ! It was just a small serving of awkward tasting disappointing dessert! 
overall a 3.5 for this outlet!

This outlet of McD is located on park street and is a proper restaurant with an elevated floor , which has a continuous seat at the back , thereby making it available to large groups of friends   to hang out. The orders are taken on the ground floor  and the staff are courteous. The interiors of this Mc D are better than several other outlets and the restaurant has a nice ambience .

Till I remember this was the oldest sole burger shop in kolkata who sold only burgers. My venture with MacD started when I was in class nine or ten. Started out with Mc aloo tikki and Mc chicken. A friend of mine had planned her 15th birthday at this park street joint. And since then I have fallen in love with burgers. The mayonnaise they put inside, I dont know where do they get it from. Its amazing and you will tend to fall in love with it. I generally prefer a-la-carte, as the meals with a coke and french fries appear a bit over priced to me. The a-la-carte is the best deal and quite economical. Whenever I am superbly hungry, the chicken Maharaja Mac awaits for me. The fact that I dont like is they give tomatoes in it. And I solely hate it. The best of the burgers,  I feel is the fillet o fish burger. The amazingly soft, supple fish fillet of bekti that melts in your mouth with the amazingly delicious mayonnaise to it, is a bang on combination and I generally crave for it whenever I am at MacD. Whatever it is, if its burger, no one can beat MacD ever. Love love you my mackie

Personally, I never liked McDonald's much earlier...hence I ate here only twice, when I was in Kolkata. At that time, there wasn't much combo offers available there. We had just ordered chicken burger, fries and Pepsi. Now, they have introduced a lot of combo offers of burgers and pepsi, which makes it even more better. The fries are crispier and I love McFloat.

McDonald of the Park Street best owned for its ambience and spacious interior but at times it is congested as it one the most popular branches among the other 4 branches of this outlet and is pretty good but like of items like ...mc egg or mc paneer are not really what i would fancy.. a good place for little family time and some NOM NOM NOM

Just the right place for burger lovers. McD is a place which I can never get bored of. A pocket friendly place, which will never disappoint u in terms of quality and quantity. Grilled chicken royale is good, but chicken maharaja mc is the best. One could try that out. The meal options are really pocket friendly, and good enough if you are super hungry.

**Location = It is located at Park Street. So a superhit location I must say.

**Brief = I have been there many a times. But the latest visit was on the occassion of a friend's birthday celebrations :)

**Ambiance = They have lots of space and also arrangement to sit in the upstairs which they usually reserve for birthday parties.
As the downstairs was crowded, we requested the management to allow us sit upstairs which they readily agreed despite our no prior reservations :D

**Things ordered = Chicken Maharaja Mac Meals and chocolate sundaes :)
They Mac burgers were filling with decent chicken patty and lots of veggies and big slice of cheese :)
They serve best french fries(both quantity and quality wise) :P
We had Cold coffees which were pretty good as well :D
The sundaes were yummy but nothing extraordinary than the other competitors like KFC and all :(

**Recommended = Mac Spicy Chicken, Chicken Maharaja Mac.

P.S. I never liked they Mac Egg !!

**Purse Check = Rs.400/- would be good enough for 2 people :)

**Overall = Great place to hangout with friends and they allowed us to stay there as long as you like and we had great photoshoots :D Lol, cheers :)

Have been here several times when I visited park street for a quick snack or just to chat. The service here is good, the place is nicely decorated . The footfall here is quite significant so if you're going out on special days you will have to wait to get a seat. The menu is same as the other macdonalds . 

I love their chocolate sundae and chicken burgers. Have loved their Meal combo too .. the French fries are really appetizing .

Service is fast and seating different as in you have different levels of seating. Go there regularly since office is close by. Love the Mcveggies and the Mcchicken.

Like any other McDonald's outlet.. this is is also A+ in its service and food. I would say that if you are searching for a good place to eat, which is not a burden on your pocket then this is the place one you should go to. Tried the new paneer royal.. it's very tasty for a paneer lover..but very big as well.
 I would say that this outlet is the best among the several one's because it is very big abd especially they allow you to sit abd have a blast with your mates! Unlike the Merlin homeland outlet which kicked me and my friends out because we were celebrating a bit loudly!

They have survuived competition from KFC and a bomb blast from miscreants and they still stand strong. Need I say more? Try the McChicken burger and then eat the Maharaja Mac. I dont think you will have space for deserts after this, though! BUt you can always go for the softy ice creamafter this if you are still hungry. Regarding quality, of course they are good. They are Macdonals after all. Regarding ambiance: No fine dining...but you are eating a burger at a burger joint. It is spacious, cool and in one word, awesome!

I prefer McDonald's over KFC any given day. 
I like the way how their burgers are not totally drenched in oil.:D

Personal favourites from McDonald's are :-

1) Chicken Maharaja Mac : They give 2 patties of chicken with Indian tandoored flavours which I like. The mayo, lattuce and tomatoes seem to be it's best friend and automatically the taste buds start dancing after taking the first bite. :3 
I never miss on this when I am in McDonald's! :D 

2) Fillet-O-Fish : Its basically a fish burger with a very subtle taste which is actually really comforting. The fish patty even though fried doesn't seem oily. The fish is soft and amazing. The burgee is a must try for everyone. 

3) Chicken Nuggets - Good! 

4) Their wraps are nice too. They use fresh vegetables which I appreciate. :) 

McDonald's is definitely a place worth visiting. 
Recommended. :)

Happy eating! :D

i have visited mc donalds many a time.. and i am a very foody person..i love enjoying burgers and all.Mc donalds is my favorite place.it is quiet and not noisy at all. it looks very private at night and i love the lights in mc donalds at night.. the upper stair in mc donalds is prohibited for birthday celebration i think..but it would be much better if it would have for local peoples to get up there.. the television in mc donalds is pritty well and can be kept busy with own self with watching telivision and having burgers.. i love the offer that the mc donalds park street offers that the no of time i visit  ..visit 1 ,visit 2 ,visit 3.is pretty well a very nice offer..i think the price of mc donalds is cheap.. and i love the ice-creams also.. i love the maintenance of the staff that they provide.mc donalds is one of m favorite place in kolkata whenever i go to any food area or restaurant i think of going to mc donalds.mc donalds should think of more offers that would afford customers or those who come to eat.. the ac is well mainted in mc donalds,, well its pritty obvious that place like mc donalds should obviously be well maintained and music playing .. well i think mc donalds dosent play a  music which could b heard by all listeners.. they should try to play music a little bit more loud.not so much louder but ya little bit more louder would have been ok i think.. i love the foods of mc donalds a lot..whenever i come with my friends i think of enjying here and having a great time and enjying the food

Fast service, always well stocked and has a big area for us to sit down and have the food. I do not like it when I have to hover on someone else and wait for a table to be vacant while my food becomes cold! One more thing I like is that they have a lot of cleaning staff and they keep this outlet squeaky clean! 

The staff here are well behaved and trained, they have at least two of the happy meal toys to chose from.

If you want on of the best burgers in the city, you have to walk down here, cause this is the place which makes world famous burgers, that are ultra delicious.
The all new grilled chicken royale and mc paneer royale are really delicious. the burgers are full of calories and taste really well. The prices are very affordable. The restaurant is clean, well spacious, very well lit. The people working there are very kind and responsive, even in an extremely housefull days. The menu is neat and you can simply pick anything and you won't get disappointed. Chicken items are not on par with KFC but overall most burgers are way tastier than KFC.. It s must recommendation for unhealthy and tasty food lovers

for sharing happy moments and to have good junk food at reasonable price at the party hub of the city, McD is unbeatable.. its one of the most anticipated treat place of kolkata.. food here is completely mixbag, some of them are simply mouth smashing, some of them are literally poor. mcaloo tikki, maharaja burger, mcspicy panner are the real treat of this place but some them like mcgrilled chicken burger deserves thrashing.. the last thing i tasted which blown me away is mcfloat, its a combination of vanilla ice cream and cold drinks with ice cubes, a showstealer indeed.. it takes time about 15 mins to get finished but costs only 35 bucks!! am serious, its a must try.
if you have 200 bucks or even 150 bucks and you want to have a delicious meal and if you are near park street, just go for McD.. my recommendation is maharaja burger or mcspicy paneer burger with french fries and mcfloat for sure.

In the heart of park street. Visited at odd hours of rainy afternoon.
Had ordered Mc Puff and a Coke.
As soon as I stepped out of there developed rashes and swelling. According to the doctor it was due to the oil they used to fry.
Been to Mc Donalds in other cities, they were ok.
Ambiance is good and spacious.

Location: Park Street 

This is the first outlet of McDonald's in Kolkata.
I being a big fan of fast-food, have personally loved the offerings out here. 

Summarizing it up, 

- McVeggie Burger 
The patty was correctly fried and the veggies were at perfect balance, the mayo level was satisfactory and the lettuce was fresh. 

- McSpicy Paneer Wrap 
This was an absolute delicacy. 
The perfect balance of mayo, veggies and the succulent paneer patty made it delectable. 
Recommended. 

- McPuff 
Has a salsa type filling. Was decent. 

- McSpicy Paneer Burger 
The Paneer in the patty was soft and melt-in-the-mouth type. 
The sauce complimented well with the patty. 
Great taste. 

- Veg Double Decker 
Was a triple layered bun with aloo patty, spicy Paneer patty, lettuce and sauces. Was a deliciously filling burger. 
Recommended. 

- McVeggie Twist
McVeggie Burger patty sandwiched in a different bun topped with chilli flakes and oregano. Not much different than the regular.

- Shake Shake Fries
Regular fries given along with a spicy seasoning (Piri Piri). Tasted great.

- McSwirl 
A cone full of vanilla icecream topped with hot chocolate. 
Tasted great. 

Coldrinks out here is a turn off since the ice to beverage ratio seems to be 2:1! 
There's more ice than the drink. 
Kindly serve cold drinks instead of ice for the money you charge. 

Self-service. Staff is quick to deliver your order. 

Prices are pocket friendly. 

Overall a good experience. :-)

Nothing new to say about a McD. But one thing stands out with this particular branch is that: when you at Park Street, it is around 8 or 9 in the morning and you are feeling hungry, the only 2 shops which you will find open is the McD and Flurys. Now Flurys isnt exactly where you would go to for a simple bite, given its prices. Hence in that sense McD's Park Street is a life saver!

As all know McDonald uses the production line concept  and the taste wont change anywhere in India and is always consistent with their food, hence the review should be focused on aspects like seating, ambiance, service and crowd. 
This outlet has a very different seating, a little old school, with loads of woodwork. and the location is just perfect. Service was great when i visited and the the outlet was clean and busy, had to wait to grab a seat.

This is one of the best places to have junk food in the city but it's no way near to KFC in comparison. Went there during my last visit with 2 of my friends, ordered chicken maharaja french fries and coke. Burgers are obviously  good and this is what they are famous for. Altogether a nice place to hang around with friends.

If you want fast food and running short of time, McDonalds is the best place to be. You would never find a que and the tables will always be clean and sanitized (coz no one turns up here). There are two things in India, first BSNL connection and the other McDonald. People don use them yet the costs are going up. Burgers are going colder and drinks here are going hotter. Left over cookies are mixed in ice-cream to call it a new product. Out of 300ml cola you will get 100ml ice. God knows where on earth the McD heading to.
The only good thing is the ambience and the decoration. Sorry guys the whole 1.5 goes for the deco.

Located in Park Street.. It is the first Mac Donald's of the city..
As the biggest outlet in the city, It is very spacious.. with nice interiors.. Ambience is quite good with foreigners and people of all age groups coming here..  

Quick at service, you don't have to wait much for your order.

** A Good OFFER : I suggest you to have a FREECHARGE Coupon with you, while your visit here.. which lets you get a Mc Aloo Tikki burger and Iced Tea per coupon, with each order of Rs. 100 (You can get Coupons, if you recharge your prepaid mobile with Rs 50 or above on freecharge.com - max of 4 coupons per recharge)

Coming to food, I have been many times and ordered these, summing it up - 

* Mc Veggie - Not so good.. Instead go for Masala Grill Veg.
* Masala Grill Veg. Meal - The most economic meal here.
* Mc Spicy Paneer - Very good.
* Spicy Paneer Wrap - Very good, but a bit expensive.
* Mc Aloo Tikki - I got it as a freebie.. which became my next day breakfast.. so good for coupon holders ;)
* Iced Tea - Nice refresher.. I got it as a freebie.. If u don't have appetite then, you can have it next day.. (Keep it refrigerated)
* Chocolate Brownie - Awesome.. Must Try.
* Mc Flurry (Choco crunch) - Awesome - Must Try. Tell them to give a good amt. of Crunch (without charging you)

If you like spicy food, don't forget to ask them for Spicy sauce.

Pocket Pinch - Rs. 200-250.

Mediocre food. The person at the counter understood neither Bengali nor English. Gave me a Chicken Royale Burger when I asked for a Paneer Royale one. Chicken Maharaja Mac is not even worth the tag of 'Maha Praja'. No wonder they reduced the price of most meals by around 50rs. Subway is a much better option around, so is KFC. I also hate the fact that they recruited not one, but multiple staff who don't understand Bengali at all. It's a shame to live in Kolkata and use English as the primary language of communication while doing something as basic as ordering food.

There are two groups of people. One of them like McD's and the other doesn't. I will be very candid here, I just don't like McDonald's. There is nothing much to like about this chain and I am not a big fan of chicken burgers. The burgers are average and have become even more undesirable to me after a few new restaurants have opened up in town which serve fantastic burgers. The buns are good but the contents in between the buns are not too good. The service here is pretty good and even with a large queue they are pretty efficient and handle themselves well. The tables are almost always clean.
But what good is good service at a restaurant which serves average food. But if you are one of those people who love McD's for what they are and what they stand for then you will obviously not agree with me.

While it can in no way compete with KFC, It is definitely a good place to chat with friends while having food. My friends and I went here on 24th March, world breakfast day. They offer free burgers there in the morning on that particular occasion. The friendly staff and the fact that they offer breakfast make this a regular visit for us St. Xaviers morning boys.

Got DRAGGED to this place by accident. Oh GOD this was where BLU FOX was--one of Calcuttas great joints---Pam Crain,Nondon,Tony and the gang,jamming in the evenings. The Best Jazz east of Suez and the food and drinks were great too. A real tragedy that it was closed down.
Macs serves the standard junk food which really cant be rated. Ambience is smelly (boiled hot dogs and burning oil). The fried chicken was DRY like the Gobi desert and tasteless.The burgers were laced with stale smelling mayo. and flacid tomato and onion rings.Yukkkk.
Go at your own risk---the Katirolls at the street corner are FAR tastier and enjoyable.

i am a foodie and my friends are so whenever our classes get over we start thinking where to go today to grab a bite...thats how we zeroed at mc donald's at parkstreet..it was a nice place with nice decor a feeling of old calcutta comes as u get inside it ,places to sit are very comfortable..the ambience was nice 
we ordered for mc spicy chicken meal,mc egg,cold coffee,grilled chicken exotica and softees..coming to the burgers they just dont satisfy ur hunger,quite small in size and not that tasty ..the mc egg is another drawback which is just not equivalent to its price...the cold coffes and softees are fyn ..grilled chicken was better than mc spicy and the french fries are the saviour without them we would have rioted as with those small burgers not even one side of our tummies were filled..
i dint find it pocket friendly coz the food and quantity was not upto the mark...service was good 
i might visit it again only to have those drinks and softees and not with a hungry me...:p

I went to McDonalds after almost 3 years and found this is not what it used to be. Anyway we ordered ‚ÄòMc Chicken‚Äô accompanied with ‚ÄòFrench Fries‚Äô and ‚ÄòCoke‚Äô. McDonald's outlet at Park Street is a perfect place to hang out with friends as it offers some delicious snacks at very pocket friendly rates. We took our time to finish the food and it was good. Cokes should be served without ice. About the food, however, there is nothing special to write home about. Overall a good place no doubt.

Well it's Mc Donalds. A place where you should come only if you love burgers. And I do! 
Coming to the place, it's a decent joint. There's plenty of space though it seems cramped up at times due to too much seating arrangements. 
As far as food is concerned the classic Big Mac, French Fries and icy Coke is an all time favorite of mine(and many). 
Well, I suppose that's it. Come only if...

Of all the MacD outlets you have across the gargantuan city, this one is definitely the classiest, given it's exquisite location and pleasantly unique interiors. A great place to chill out with old buddies over copious amounts of coffee& burgers, MacDonald's has made a name for itself by catering to the hunger pangs of (primarily) the youth across the globe. A wide array of burgers, each of which look inviting enough, welcome you at the main counter as you are spoiled for choices.
However, there are a few things that deter a foodie like me when it comes to MacD. Firstly, if you are looking to have lunch or dinner with your friends or family, then MacD is definitely not the best option, not by any stretch of imagination. A couple of chicken grilled burgers is definitely not a viable lunch/ dinner option, unless you are looking to deprive yourself of the 'wholesome satiation' after a full- course meal. Also, most of the burgers are pretty over- priced, so often after spending close to 250 bucks (french fries& cola included), you end up with a stomach still pining for more. MacD is not an economical option either (it never feigned to be one, to be fair). 
However, if you are looking to chill out with your friends for long hours amidst the hustle& bustle of Park Street& you don't mind the pocket pinch, then MacD@Park Street is definitely the Numero Uno junction. I definitely do not mind hopping in, once in a while!

I'm not exactly a McD fan. KFC gives much better value for the money. Still, I've come here with my friends on a few occasions and tried several of their offerings. 
The main problem here is that the food is mostly not as hot as it should be. The burgers and fries look and taste like something taken out of the freezer only a short while ago. The chicken burger has a rather chewy patty with a bland bread coating. The nuggets are quite good - but once again, barely warm. The fries are perhaps the coldest ever served at any fast food joint. I don't think much of the coffee either. Easily the best item is the McFlurry - creamy and rich with delightful granules of Oreo. Given a chance I'd come here just for the ice-cream! The meals are very definitely below average. 
I wouldn't say McD has bad food. I've enjoyed it several times on trips abroad. The thing is, the outlets in Kolkata just don't seem to live up to the standards expected of them.Whether the staff are simply indifferent or the cooks are inefficient, I don't know, but it's quite plain to see why McD hasn't taken off as well as it should have. And this from one of the most successful brands in the world. Tsk tsk.

there is nothing that great about Mc Donalads that would make you visit it again and again.........
its prices are high relative to the quality of food 
the burgers regular or econo . ..... seem very ordinary to me lacking any signature flavors or rare taste .....
the Mc egg is such a stupid concept and almost like charging you for nothing ........just eggs and bread 
then there is problem with the portion size ............
the pictures are so appealing ..but its a sad reality that they dont serve that much sauce or lettuce or onion or cheese in the actual burger which is half the size apparent from the picture 
the french fries are ok .but the tomato sauce is much better at KFC 
the ice creams were my thing of interest here but now other places are also serving softies at the same rate more or less 
the cold drinks seems to much iced and less of the actual drink 
-----------------------------
ambiance is good 
service can be sloppy during rush hours 
very average food 
good for children who cant eat much and are enticed by the joker thing

The ambiance, unlike the usual Mc Donald's is a bit different,so extra points there. The service was a bit slow compared to the usual Mc Donald's. The food is tasty enough for the price we pay, which is not much. 
They have a separate kids playing area and when I visited the place a party was going on there. By the looks on the kids they all seemed to be very happy and having fun. If you are out in Park Street with your kids or short of cash, Mc Donald's is the place to be. Otherwise there are plenty of better options to look out for.

An old warm charm in a fast food chain. it happens only in Calcutta.

this outlet just opposite flury's is one of the largest i have visited and the interior decor is well done. here finding a place wont be difficult and the sitting is very suitable with your family.

coming to the food, its the standard McD dishes. i love the layering in the maharaja burger . the chicken by itself has an awesome taste. also as you bite the burger slowly you can taste all the individual components like cheese n veggies. another item on my frequent ordered list are the brownie and the soft serve. these are real value for money.

perfect place for a quick bite with your special one or to catch up with old friends .

P.S.- they have free wifi for a limited time

This Mc Donald's has come up in the same premises of the famed Blue Fox which at one point was one of the most popular establishments on Park Street. Its good to see that Mc Donald's has pulled up its service as well as quality in recent times because at one point I had simply stopped visiting it. I like both the Mc Aloo Tikki and Mc Egg which are well priced and also make for tasty snacks. My favorite though is still the breakfast menu especially the Sausage Mc Muffin with Egg. I have yet to try the new Grilled Chicken Exotica burger and look forward to doing so.



----- 30 Oct, 2012 -----

McD's is not what it used to be .... I loved the Mc Chicken with Cheese Burger but find it lacks flavor of late ..... however the Nuggets are great and I like the honey mustard dip that you get with the nuggets. Also love the McDonald's breakfast McMuffins ... Chicken Sausage and Egg McMuffin is a tasty way to start your day !!!

MCDonald's is a worldwide fastfood chain that had gained recognition at a quick pace. However, this particular outlet is the biggest in town.
It has two floors. The upper one is often booked for parties. The lower one is however always packed yet you will manage to grab a few seats here and there.
Coming to the food :

Maintains a basic standard.
Preferable burgers : Chicken Mc Grill
Mc Egg, Chicken masala grill.

Team it up with fries or masala fries and a coke and you're good to go.
They have also introduced this range of chicken and veg pops which are pretty good. They come in a pack of either 6 or 12.

Pocket friendly prices. However, do not forget their Cola Float and Mc Flurry. I prefer Choco Crunch.

A thumbs up for me.

Cheers! :)

Have been there many a times..but haven't tried everything yet because I simply can't get enough of their mcspicy paneer(it's just ammazzing)!!! French fries are always good.. But I really miss the shake shake fries. Well if you want to be full with moderate prices, then you need to visit it.

Today i.e. on November 20 th at 2:30 pm I had visited McDonald's, Park Street and had Veg McPuff  and one cup of coffee
but the stuffings in the McPuff came out while trying to cherw it and came out on the plate and dropped on my shirt which caused tremendous embarassment to me because it had spoiled my favourite shirt although I wased that portion of the shirt 
but still the stain remained. I henceforth put a written complaint to the floor manager and am waiting for the necessary actions to be taken. I hope that the product be changed and me given due compensation for the embarassment.
Thanks .

McD is one of the best quick service outlets in India. I rate it  4.5/5.0 for its food and service.  I had a grt McD experience in Bangalore with all the outlets. Unfortunately, McD's park street outlet stands no where near to those I have visited in Blr. The burgers taste ok but the service is not appreciable. They take eternity to serve certain items; for e.g. the french fries. At multiple occasions they took 15-20 minutes to serve the french fries pack.... Once, after waiting for 30 mins, I went to the counter to ask for the french fries and they excused themselves by saying that they forgot about it.... Really?!?! Remind you, it was not a busy day for them!....and C.O.T., I always find some crumbs on the tables/seats...perhaps, they do not clean the place properly after the previous occupants leave.

McDonald's is a worldwide fast food chain which has so far done a good job in covering most parts of India. My only concern is that Kolkata has the least number of McD's compared to other metropolitan cities. There are only like 6 McD's in Kolkata and I really urge them to open more stores in like Domino's have done.

The McD located in Park Street is probably the best one in Kolkata and the largest one also. It opens early at 8AM as it is written on the gate, however 8-11AM is the breakfast time and only breakfast menu is available. The restaurant is well decorated and is spacious with two floors. The washrooms are eco-friendly toilets as they do not use water to clean it but some bacterias are used (it was written inside the washroom). There are ample of counters in the restaurant.

Talking about the food, everyone is familiar to more or less what McDonalds serves and their menu has hardly changed except for one or two items being added. McDonald's does full justice to all the vegetarians and non-vegetarians as a number of good veg burgers are available, the cheapest being McAloo Tikki. Non-veg burgers are no less and even fish burger (Filet O' Fish) is available. Leaving burgers aside, McD also has some awsome side dishes such as their world famous French Fires, Wraps, McPuff, Chicken Nuggets etc. Deserts and beverages are a bit overpriced however, you have nice McShakes, McFluffy in deserts. Don't bother to purchase any soft drink as McD charges you twice the amount for them and their 300Ml cup is filled with almost 100Ml ice cubes.

Some of my favorites here are Chicken Maharaja Mac, Chicken Masala Grill, Chicken Wrap and Chicken Nuggets. If you are going to have the food there itself then I will also recommend their traditional crisp French Fries but if you are going for a take away or home delivery, then you should avoid that as it tends to get cold and loose their taste.

There is also a separate breakfast menu which is served from 8AM-11AM. There are no as such stomach filling items in this menu but contains good items. My recommendation from this menu would be Sausage McMuffin and Hot Cakes with Butter and Syrup. There is also a dedicated happy meal available in this menu.

McD is quite reasonable on prices except for beverages and deserts and you should expect a Rs.150 bill for a non veg burger and a side item. McD rarely introduces any offers and coupons but this month (August) they have introduced something called a "i'm loving it cart" which will give you a free item as mentioned in the card on your every second visit. The offer expires on 30th September. Though I have the card, but I have only made 2 visits so far after receiving it however, my second visit was not marked on the card as I visited the store before 11AM (breakfast time).

Delivery wise, the home delivery is fast. McDonald's does have an online order option but is currently not available for Kolkata.

Fillet of Fish is also liked by a lot of people (I personally don't like it much because of the sauce).

McDonald's is not renowned worldwide for nothing.Whenever you visit McD you expect a certain standard and they generally dont let you down.When McD had first started in Kolkata,I had huge expectations.I dont know if my expectations were too high or for whatever reason I have been a little disappointed at McD.
Their burgers are good no doubt but I would like it more if they gave us the option to customise it at the time of order eg like if we want more cheese or if we dont want the cheese or we dont want the tomato etc.Sometimes when you inform them at the time of order they do customise for you but most times owing to the rush of customers they forget.Also in the rush,since they dont ask you,you may forget to let them know what exactly you want.
Coming to the food,the Maharaja Mac is the best but I dont like the big tomato in it.The fillet o fish is a nice idea and is quite unique.The nuggets are not at all good.The mcspicy burgers are something a quite like.The desserts are just about okay.
The ambience at the park street outlet is really nice.It is probably the best among the popular fast food outlets.
The prices have gone up of late.
Overall a good place no doubt but somehow I would prefer Kfc to McD.The crispy chicken of Kfc is far better and their zinger burger for me is better(and they dont use big tomatoes in their burgers!).The crushers and brownies of kfc are way superior too.

One of my all time favourite restaurants. That's one of the reason why I've given it a 5 out of 5. Thumbs up for the casual environment, the professional service, and last but not the least, the food. My favourite would be the Mc Chicken Maharaja with 2 layers of fillings. I love all the desserts starting from Mc Swirl to Mc Flurry to Soft Serve to chocolate brownie soft serve. I've tried them all and they just taste amazing.

Very economical location. Cheaper and better option than the ones beside it.

The place is spacious most of the time. During birthday parties they tend to block the upper floor 
and the lower area gets congested. so please look into that. If you don't have space its best to not allow customers to come in. An apology is better than a customer standing with a tray full of food.

The service is quicker compared to other joints and the people appointed to the counters are very friendly, if you are confused they are more than happy to help you out.

One must try the cola float here but do ask them to go easy on the ice. 

Overall a nice spot to hangout with friends.

This is the third time i ordered online for home delivery from mcdonalds. The online ordering process is very easy, they also have a customizing option which i like. 

They also have a online tracking system just like dominos, but it is not at all accurate. About 20 minutes after the tracker had already shown that the order was on its way the delivery boy called me saying that he was just leaving and asked me for directions and asked too many questions, also the expected delivery time was off by about 30 minutes.

Mcdonalds also charge a minimum of Rs.22 as packaging charges which i feel they should not charge.

I Ordered a McEgg and a Masala Grill chicken which tasted fine. The masala grill chicken is a nice new option and i think it will do well in India.

Lastly Mcdonalds gave me a free fridge magnet with my meal, which i will stick on my fridge. I think it is a smart idea as it made me happy as a customer and will provide them some extra branding.

I really love the ambiance at McDonald's, its gives you the feeling of a lively restaurant. The moment you enter the restaurant you find the place teeming with people chok o bloke, some people waiting in a queue to order their snacks. The aroma of the french fries being cooked at one far end of the restaurant, the jingling of coins going inside the till, the click of the buttons being pressed by the customer service person at the ordering counter, just sums its all for you that this is indeed a lively fast food joint. 

Though the Big M menu is limited but the standard of their food is always retained, well if you express their quality standards in terms of the graphs in economics it would appear like  perfect competition graph, one straight line.Come to the food part now, you talk about the ice creams, with the  biscuit cones that yummy, you talk about the Hash, or the Chicken Burger, thats brilliant too,.of course the french fries they just add the icing to the cake of the quality of food at Mcdonald's. . . 

Folks lets me share with you something, you see I have tasted Burgers at MacDonald in Connaught Place New Delhi, McDonalds at Bangkok near Nana's station, Mac Donalds in London toole street  and guess what? they all taste the same, may be the indian burgers are slightly spicer and have some more varieties.

The McDonalds on park street is spic and span. Even the toilets are great and i like the concept of saving water. The mezzanine floor of Big Mac is another plus that goes in favour of this exquisite restaurant on park street. One thought that the fire at Big Mac would bring the sales down but lo and Behold nothing stops people to throng McDonalds despite this earlier teething problem that plagued McDonalds initially. Bottomline, McDonald simply is awesome, McDonalds take a bow!

Crispy fries, Mc chicken and a glass of coke are the things i routinely have from this popular American food joint. The ambience is wonderful,there are two floors and a separate section for birthday celebration. The staff are very modest but the service could have been slightly faster. Prices are very reasonable, burgers are rich in mayonnaise, the place is always crowded owing to its prime location near Bar B Q. Apart from my waiting-in-the-queue experience twice or thrice,i have no repulsion! Go savour a burger from McD foodies!

Ahhhhhh!!!!! Located at the posh area. Very reasonably priced as compared to the other costly restaurant? Could anyone guess what I am talking about? None other than McDonalds parkstreet!! , located beside Barbq. I love this McDonalds more than any other branches. 

Basically, divided into three areas: 1) As we enter, there is seating place which is always crowded which includes a proper decent hygenic and maintained washroom. And has around 20 tables (there can be more or less) 
2) the ground area where the staffs wearing caps and proper uniform serves us with the food. Having French fries made on the right side and burgers prepared on the back side(secret recipe you see :p).
3) another area above top most area after climbing from area 1 where one can throw birthday parties. And has a decent seating capacity.

Coming to the pros and cons: 
Pros:
1) Has the best ambience in town as compare to other McDonalds. Not just town even in other states of india. 
2) service is quick staffs are decent. 
3) serves yummy burgers with mayo stuffed and crispy fries better than other branches for sure.
4) Has the largest seating capacity 
5) located at the prime area

Cons:
1) sometimes customers don't get seat during peak hours. 
2) they should allow customers to use the above area when birthday party is not going on- basically value your customers.
3) service requires time even after having machines - I feel the service can be much faster with decent planning and management.
4) sometimes staffs mis manage due to excessive crowd and orders- take care please
5) Please don't add half a glass ice in coca cola then it becomes cola ice. - take a serious note

Rest all is well. I love McDonalds. :) 

One must try: combo meals, mc chicken vegie aloo tiki puff fries maharaja spicy paneer and chicken and their crispy fries.

I am not averse to eating food from popular fast-food chains. McD is one of them. I like a few things on the menu, always order them, and chuck the rest. I particularly dislike the chicken nuggets, and I dont know why some people wax lyrical about it. 

I find the construction of the spicy chicken burger, one of the two things on the menu I actually eat, to be silly. Why would someone put a slice of tomato in a wrap, where the tomato slithers out as soon as you bite, and proceed to fall on your lap? I hate it when that happens. In this KFC Zinger is so much more methodical. Everything cut up in tiny pieces so that such slithering and falling bit is kept at the minimum.

Plus, they dont listen to orders. At McD you can ask the server to hold a particular thing in a burger if you dont like it. I generally ask the people to hold the cheese in my big spicy chicken wrap, and the Mc D at Mani Sq never makes a mistake. Out of the 5 times i have ordered the same at the Park st one, they have got it wrong thrice.

I personally think that the milkshakes McD serves are pretty good value for money, and go for them when I am not eating anything heavy. The other favorite is French Fries. I generally aks the guys to give me a pack of fresh fries, and dont mind waiting. they oblige.

so yes, mixed reactions here.

The first of the McDonalds to open and stay open in Calcutta, this restaurant showcases the interesting phenomenon of a low-end cheap fast-food restaurant chain (renowned for bad food) across the world turning into some kind of exotic dining experience in Calcutta.

The old Blue Fox restaurant has been done up well, and the place looks neat and clean most of the time. The food, however, is nothing to write home about - McDonalds are standardized, if nothing else. The Chicken Maharaja Mac, the Indian cousin of the beefy Big Mac, is not bad. Soft drinks are best taken without ice - apparently they are less watered down that way. The desserts are not good at all.

The service gets on your nerves. The fake cheeriness and endless "thank you"s might work well in the USA, but in India, it is strange. One actually misses the crusty waiters one complains about in other restaurants. In sum, if you want to go to a McDonald's badly, this is the place. Otherwise. even for burgers, there are other options in this city.

You go to a McDonald and you know what to expect. Uniformed staff, deep fried burgers and kids having birthday parties. No different from the thousands of other outlets across the globe, you'll get a smiling service, spotless hygiene and cheap plastic trays. Of course, when you're in Park Street and the pocket feels lightish, this is the place to go. Also, it is my opinion that their value for money is better than rival KFC'S. 
The one thing different which this McD  is the Chinese themed sitting space in the middle. Try to get a place there. :) I've been to this outlet more times than I'd like to admit. And the thing which bugs me most is that you have to pay extra for a packet of sauce.

Chakraborty Tip : Don't wait for the bathroom urinal to flush. Its a no water toilet applying some sort of biochemical technology or other. You wouldn't want to stand there like an idiot.

I am not a big fan of McD, and I have my reasons. Poor choice of menu and better options provided by their competitors elsewhere. It is very well priced and that's a positive for sure. The one thing I really like is the Mc Egg. And that's about it. KFC over McD every day.

Disclosure: I'm not a Mc Donalds fan...I lean more towards KFC. As far as Mc Delivery is concerned they do not deliver in my area. Now having said all that I sent out for some Burgers from Mc Donalds, Park Street today and I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered the Chicken Maharaja Mac, the Chicken Mc Grill and the Chicken Mc Spicy Burgers with side orders of Mc Nuggets. The Spicy Mc Grill stood out for excellent flavour. I must say they have improved. 

Just one bit of wishful thinking....please add more kinds of burgers apart from chicken ...like pork maybe?

*** Update of 15/ May 2014.
Walked in for a breakfast at about 7.20, only to be told it opens at 8. So I waited till the doors opened at 08:01. Had been wanting to try the breakfast menu.
I asked for a Sausage & Egg McMuffin which I converted to a deal by adding a Coke and Hash Browns. I also wanted to try the Hot Cakes with Syrup (actually pancakes with maple syrup), which I had with another Hash Brown and coffee.
The Sausage was just like any other burger patty. Nothing exciting. The egg didn't add much. The pancakes were passable, the maple syrup nice. Didn't use the butter. The hash browns quite bad but the coffee was good :)
My phone ran out of charge taking pictures.
And oh yes I always find a fly buzzing around annoying me near the exit where I sit. I wish they be a tad careful.  

--------------------------------------------------


Mcdonald's is not really premium experience and it shows in the quality of food and service almost every time.

First of all, the place looks shabby. The colours used look shabby. Over use of brown etc on the packaging makes the food look shabby.

My last visit was a few days back. I had been hearing about their breakfast offerings and decided to try it out. I walked in to the outlet and asked what was available. I was a little taken aback when they said nothing from the breakfast specials were available as the muffins were out of stock. I tried out the McSpicy Chicken, basically wanting a crispy fried one. It was passable, and a bit too spicy for my liking.

The fries were okay. I asked for a Thumsup, and the ordertaker billed it before telling me they don't have serve Thumsup, just Coke and others. I found that rather callous.

After finishing my meal, I was still hungry so I asked for a Masala Grill Chicken burger.  Also, they should serve more than just mayo and onions with it!

All in all not worth the money.

Honestly Macdonald's is my personal favourite and I've been to atleast 30 outlets of it across the world, but at the same time I must admit the Kolkata one is not that good like it should be. Outside Mac wins hands down but here I myself must admit there are other fast food outlets which are better than this one. 
Here though the burgers name the same the taste does not really correspond which is a big area for worry. The quality of bread isn't that good and neither the tenderness of the chicken. 
The ambience is good and well done and quite big so no complains regarding this particular area. 
The staff here aren't well trained at all, they don't even smile at you when you order it seems like they are doing a favour on you by giving you the food!!!!! that's not the right attitude, after all its all about customer satisfaction. 
So I rate it 3.5 and sincerely hope their service and food quality improves as soon as possible.

The tag line flashing across the television screens, 'I'm loving it' and the images of delish burgers, French fries and chicken nuggets are enough to entice Kolkata foodies to run to McDonald's fast food joint at 55, Park Street, Kolkata. Their juicy and delicious chicken burgers at amazingly reasonable prices are enough to satiate your hunger anytime. McDonald's outlet at Park Street is a perfect place to hang out with friends. Even if you are not hungry you can just grab and chomp in some chicken Mc. Nuggets while gossiping with friends. Kids love to eat at Mc. Donald's just for the special toy, given with every happy meal pack.
Yes, sometimes you will find it difficult to find a proper seat because the place is overcrowded at times. College students throng in here to grab a bite or two; Mc Donald's offers some truly delicious snacks at very pocket friendly rates. Mc. Donald's also offers some delicious hamburgers for the eggetarians and the vegetarians. When hungry, you can grab some Mc Egg or Mc Aloo Tikki which are wholesome and offered at nominal rates. Apart from coke and maaza, you can also have some refreshing iced tea or freshly brewed coffee to soothe your nerves. 
Unlike roadside fast food joints where the cook and the food joint owner hardly pay attention to personal hygiene and cleanliness, Mc. Donald's particularly thinks of your health and hygiene. Their staff make sure to wear gloves while serving your food trays. They never use their ungloved hands to pick up the burgers or nuggets from the containers. On the hot and humid summer months it is always relaxing to grab a bite at an air-conditioned fast food joint with no one to shove you or disturb you.  Enter this food joint whenever you are hungry and never hesitate to gorge in their mouthwatering burgers and nuggets.

Agree with the negative reviews which speak of serious deterioration.
I didn't even like the newly introduced spicy dish. Somehow for me it beats the purpose of visiting McD

McDonald has deteriorated over last couple of years a lot. The quality of burgers have fallen quite a bit. Having said all these, yet there is a charm in the MacD that pulls you there. If I look a bit closely, the quality of food is pretty consistent, the concerning part is that it's same old Macchicken, Macspicy or Macmaharaja. A few months ago when they launched a spice along with the fries, it was a big hit, at least with me. But they have stopped that now. I guess MacD needs to have new dish in the menu - that is the only suggestion.
As for the food quality - it is good. You can always grab a bite at a MacD!!!

Once upon a time MC Donalds used to be very well-known for its food but according to me it is losing its standard. Nowadays i seldom visit there and ambiance is good here. After the fire incident i usually go there. I am not at all fond of burger so i mainly eat chicken Nuggets and french fries. Service is well and all the time it remains crowded. It is lucky that it is situated in a very popular place. Food quality is great but i think burgers are now becoming tasteless. i would rate it 3 stars.

Well, yesterday for the first time, I went to Mc Donalds,park street. I had taken a Mc Maharaja(parcel). I am bound to say that they had made me a fool as because seeing the picture of Mc Maharaja,I ordered that thinking it would be larger and stuffed with two chicken layers(as it is portrayed in the pic)...but alas,it was stuffed with large slices of tomato and a little bit chkn and it didn't have multiple layers...it was a small and narrow one...I am not goin to that place nemore guys..I am dissapointed...

Its the best place to hang out with friends,chat,gosssips,discussions and what not??I love the location and ambience of it because its very near to my college and I am a regular goer.....I have heard the non veg variety of burgers offered in mcdonalds is beyond comaparison...there's no doubt about it....I being a vegetarian prefer having the mc alu tikki,veg wrap and piri piri french fries....It satisfies my taste buds and the place attracts me...Do grab a burger whenever u even dare to pass by that area....

Prem-E-Asha (www.premeasha.org) has found the Park Street outlet excellent and we have celebrated Children's Day, Founder's Day and our B'Day with some marginalized and destitute street children.

Most of the time, we, friends used to visit there, and we got the so called burgers and whatever for absolutely free of cost. So I dont wanna discuss nything about the prices of the food, but I must say that the burgers are not that good. One which is simple, is too much simple in taste and one which is spicy is more than spicy enough. I do not love the burgers. But the brownies are alright. And of course it is one of the good places to hang out with friends.

Mc D is the place we hang around mostly when our college is over or when bunking classes.Innumerable meetings,reunions,fights,gossips happen right here at this Park Street eatery! Be it over a Mc Veggie Meal or a Chicken Mexican Wrap and fries,this place is a sure boon to all the college goers of this area. I personally swear by the Chicken Mexican Wrap and love this place for its seating arrangement.The booths are quite cozy and comfortable.Getting yourself a good place to sit is quite a task especially if you're there at the lunch hour or something.Overall,Mc Donald's is for us and I'm Lovin' It !!!
