Located at the shopping hub- New Market, the food here is too filling. You get the best of Chinese and Indian assortments but those who prefer to go easy on their tummy, this place isn't for them.

Located in sudder street just after Zaranj, it's a calm nd quite place near to park street. Has valet parking available which is a boon in that area. Dynasty is the Chinese section whereas Gaylords serve indian. We tried chicken tangri kebab, chicken spring roll, prawn szewan and chicken with spring onions. All the dishes were good except the spring roll which was moderate. Aircondition had an issue so it was quite uncomfortable after 2 pegs of whiskey but it was manageable. Visited their terrace and seen their rooms just to get an idea about the room fare. Minimum fare is 6000 per night for double bed stay. The third floor had residential units whereas the 1st and 2nd floors consisted of rooms. Coming to the ambience nothing special but a proper family place. They offered 15% discount on beverages and 10% on food. Quite reasonable compared to park street. 3 pegs antiquity blue, 1 Tom Collins and 2 small blue disband gin costed 1170 after discount and 4 dishes of food costed us 1290 after discount. That mean 1250 approx for two. Will definitely visit again.

Must have been a good place in its heydays, now it's just one of those restaurants which just rely on their reputation to bring people in. It's a non descript place with dim lighting and uninspiring ambience. There were three things I asked for, which weren't on the menu. That's such a put off! The food wasn't too bad but not anything I would go back for. They really need to pull up their socks!

Checked in there on 22nd October. Heard that they serve good Chineese and Thai dishes. We ordered pepper chicken and garlic chicken for starter.

Pepper chicken was ultimate. Not too much fried, chicken pieces were tender, taste was very much palatable.

Garlic chicken was good as well.

For main course we ordered for fried rice(unfortunately they were out of shrimps n prawns) , massaman curry and schezhuan chicken. 

Massaman curry, which is Thai dish, was good and upto my marks list I will give 5/10.

Ambience was a bit dark, with noise of service people in the gallery. Hope they could improve the ambience a little bit and we missed presence of other guests as we were the only ones sitting there.

Service level was very good.

As a vegetarian, I find that the Thai food at Dynasty offers variety as well as quality. I tried the Thai Green Curry, Papaya Salad, Paneer Satay in Peanut Sauce and Pad Thai Noodles, all of which were exceptional.

I'd definitely recommend even someone who eats only non-vegetarian to try the paneer satay in peanut sauce!

VERY disappointed after visiting this place. Went for the Far East Dining Experience and it wasn't any experience at all since we did not get food even after being seated for 2 hours and 15 mins. All we got was starters which had cold momos with super thick skin! NOT EDIBLE! When we ordered for drinks from the drinks menu, 3 out of 4 drinks weren't available. The whiskey that we ordered was served to us in regular soft drink glasses. On asking the waiter, he said that we are out of whiskey glasses since the hotel has never had so much crowd before. The menu was pre-ordered at the time of reservation. But we again had to give our separate selections half an hour after being seated. The timings for the dinner was 9 - 11 pm. We continuously requested for the dinner to be served faster. But we were seated till 11:30 being served only with starters and the staff said that dinner was getting prepared and we would have to wait for another half an hour. We had to walk off just to get dinner elsewhere after having spent ten thousand at this place. Terrible experience. Inspite of hearing good reviews about the thai food, would never want to visit this place again thanks to the extremely slow service, the hospitality and the ignorance of the staff.

So we are at the Dynasty. They have apparently organised some 'event' they have no clue what an event entails. Absolutely no work or effort has gone into it. 
We have just had the soup which was below average. 
Appetisers came in 45 minutes. Dumpling cold and taste of the other things were average. 
I don't think I will ever come back here. 
And oh ya they have an event and the AC is not working!! Cherry on the cake...

Got groupon coupons for this restaurant! And the thai green curry was awesome. We often come from office to have our favourite Chinese or Thai lunch. Little shabby ambience, but well located!

Discovered this place pretty late.. It has amazing Chinese and Thai food. I tried the chicken momos, chilly chicken, chicken satay and the red curry. All the dishes were outstanding. The special black sauce with the momos was outstanding. This place is a must visit for your Asian food cravings.

Dynasty is one of the oldest and best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. With its sophisticated interiors and experienced staff, it exudes the grandeur of days gone by. The delicious food, good service and charming atmosphere make it well worth the price! The garlic prawn starter and chilly chicken are great. A must visit for all.

Horrible food, pls do not bother even to step in. The food was ready to be served, but there was no one to serve it for 30 mins. After we made a lot of hue and cry, they decided to warm the food again and serve it. It was reallly bad, with food not cooked properly. Pls dont ever think of going there if you intend to spend a nice evening.

Visited Dynasty today for lunch..n we were expecting a crowded restaurant but to our surprise we four were the only people there! Ambience was pleasant. We went in for their set lunch menu n even though they did not have many options to choose from but the food was up to the mark! I especially liked their pepper chicken n a fish preparation that was served for starters. Overall a nice dine in to have some quiet time with your loved ones alongwith some delicious food.

i love the food at dynasty. be it the garlic prawns. meinfoon, fried rice,szechuan prawns and chicken manchurian are really good. the good thing is that it is  a romantic place which is not so crowded and quiet. i guess climbing to the first floor puts foodies off. desserts were also decent. definitely would like to dine in a quiet place but of course good food.

Dynasty has pretty decent food ... sometimes if you want to go to a place where you get good Chinese food but not the same old places Dynasty is where I head to .... I usually start with the Prawn Spring Roll and the Chicken Gold Coin ...... if its winter combine that with the Hot and Sour Soup or the Chicken Noodle Soup. For the mains my must have is the Chicken Honey Lemon .... I like the way the flavours tickle the palette and you can also order the Crispy Lamb or the Garlic Prawns both of which are good. This place is usually not too crowded and has a good ambience so if your not looking for a rushed meal and want to catch up with friends its a nice option.

Hang out at Lytton hotel for a change!
3 out of 5

There are many good and affordable food joints in the New Market area. Of them, the Dynasty Restaurant in Lytton Hotel is a must visit. If you are planning to have a classy lunch or dinner in a classy area, then this is the place to be. The interiors exude sophistication and elegance like no other place in Kolkata. The stylish decor and the comfortable sitting arrangements simply make having your meal here a complete experience. Though they serve both Thai and Chinese dishes; it is their Chinese offerings that shine out. The dishes are priced a bit too high in my opinion but the food is nice. The service deserves much appreciation too. The servers are polite and well informed; very attentive to every need of the diner. 

To begin with, their starters do not have any rivals. Items like golden fried prawns, chicken spring roll and chicken gold coin are wonderful snack options. They are not only light but very golden and crispy as well. They had been fried to perfection. Their soups are delightful and heart warming dishes. Crab sweet corn soup and noodle soup are scrumptious options. There is a nice balance of flavours and a generous dose of meat and vegetables in all of their soups. One most important fact that one must remember while dining here is that their hot and spicy dishes might be too fiery for people with a very sensitive palate. Nonetheless, it should not stop you from ordering them; they can be tweaked to suit your needs. They complement the fried rice and noodle staples served here very well and provide a wholesome meal.

A meal is normally not complete without ordering dessert, which is a shame as dessert options are not many and varied here. Nevertheless, they offer the usual ice cream flavours, tutti fruity and the like.
