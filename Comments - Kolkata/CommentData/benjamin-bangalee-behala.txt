Very happy to have discovered such an amazing restaurant in my locality. I've been binge eating on their food for a while now.

I've tried a lot of dishes from here, right from simple breakfast items to exquisite main course preparation.

I tried their Baked Bhetki very recently, which has kind of forced me to put in this good review. It was sheer heaven in our mouths. It is an absolute must try for everyone out there.

Among the rest of their menu, other extremely recommended dishes would be their Jumbo Rolls, different Prawns preparation, the Biryani (of course) and the thalis. The chinese food is also quite good.

Thank you Benjamin Bangalee. Had a great great time. Excellent ambience and excellent service. I'd definitely want to come try more of your exquisite (on order) dishes.

Been to this place a couple of times in the past, always loved the ambience and the food. Went there last night with family and was pleasantly surprised to see the place boasting of some festive flavour, the waiters dressed like the elves, almost made me wish to be young again and once more believe in Santa. That aside the food here never disappoints, in fact we make it a point to always try something new every time we visit. Last night we had their prawns malai curry which was served in actual fresh coconut kernels, with aromatic steamed rice, followed by mutton dak banglow, and some chicken hariyali tikka kebobs and some hot chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert.

Must try their continental food next, the table next to ours had ordered a mutton goulash that seemed positively yum.

Ah well with this place I'm sure there will always be a next time for me and my family.

A hospitality industry runs on both food and the service and also fails for the same. Unfortunately neither the service or food was responsible for this review but the management. I guess like quite a few eateries in Kolkata success has gone to their head. The owners didn't bother to tone down their soiree and meetings while guests were seated, moreover the initial hospitality which we had received during the initial months had vanished only in a mere few months and they casually shrugged off requests. The biriyani is most pathetic I have ever tested anywhere in whole world. Nomatter how much tried to bring this into concern and check the reviews other have posted, they just don't care and rather said DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO, nice. Used to be nice joint, but alas. Perhaps the untidy interiors and biriyani along with replacement of attitude of the owner should be able to save it. Anyways since it started it is steadily going down in ratings

I ordered their food online after seeing reviews and ratings and I can assure that you wont be dissapointed. I ordered for lunch and all chinese dishes, the food was not only tasty but also in good quantity, they offer a variety of good chinese dishes.I mainly liked the burnt garlic fried rice and shezwan noodles. If you are planning to have good chinese food in a decent budget then you can easily trust Benjamin Bangalee and you wont be dissapointed atall.

One of my favourite places, this place is fortunately so near to my house..I order from here all the time, they are known for their Coastal and Chinese cuisines..My personal favourite is the herb rice, which I recommend to those reading my review.. You can have herb rice with whatever side dish you want, be it Chinese or Mughal.. Also, I love their chicken steamed momo and the pan-fried momo..
 The place is quite beautiful and ambient.. You'll get a Bengali feeling from this place..And also, the name is actually quite unique.. Overall...A very nice place..Which I recommend to all.. :)

This is the fourth time i have been to this restaurant. It basically has a very cozy environment and the staff are very friendly. Now coming to food the dishes are pretty good for a restaurant in thakurpukhur area.I have tried chinese here which was pretty good in terms of quality and quantity.the best that i likes was the indian mutton preparations especially mutton kosha and rice. The kosha was extremely flavourful and soft. The staff take extra care of the guests trying to accomodate their requirements and specifications. A must try for the people staying nearby. Yet to try the rolls though.Heard a lot about them.

Chinese food and combos are good enough.
Heard a lot about its Biryani.
Sadly it's not that good as heard.
 One packet contains one Aloo one egg and a very big piece of chicken.
Now since the chicken is so big it is not very soft and takes up alot of space of the packet so rice amount is very less for one person.
However the mughlai that they make is tasty n contain less oil and can be had. 
There are far better places of Biryani @ Behala so go for them instead of this.

Located in South Calcutta, near Behala Chowrasta, Benjamin Bangalee is well known for its Coastal and Bengali cuisines. From outside it gives you an old school feel, but as you enter, the place mesmerizes you. It looks like one out of the movies, with hand painted walls, beautiful table lamps and wall arts, and yet has quite a pleasant and calm touch to it. The restaurant is spacious unlike the other cramped up places you find across the city, and can easily accommodate 30+ heads at a time.

Invited over by Culinary Calcutta (Udit and Ritika), and hosted by Bina Ghosh, we had a wonderful time together along with a few more bloggers. Benjamin Bengalee is located in James Long Sarani, Behala, opposite to the Bank of India James Long Sarani branch. The place is well decorated and has a very homely ambiance, the wall paintings have a pretty nice story behind them. The three walls depict the three cuisines available at Benjamin Bengalee, Continental, Chinese and Bengali.

From finger foods to three course meal, Benjamin Bangalee brings to you an array of Indian and continental cuisine.
From the lusciously baked bhetki to the aromatic kerela mutton, from spicy dumplings to mutton goulash Benajmin Bangalee has much to offer than just biryanis and kebabs.
On a recent invite for menu tasting I came across some amazing dishes.
Starting off with spicy chicken and cheese momo we moved to the beautifully baked bhetki served with baked veggies.
The bhekti was all things sensational and the momo were tasteful to the core.
The ajwaini fish and chicken tikka were great on the taste buds.

Moving on to the main course the mutton goulash and kerala mutton just wooed me.
The biryani however was average, the rice and potato was well cooked and flavorful but the mutton needs to be worked on. There is always a room for improvement.
Also this eatery is much more than a biryani chain, they have a lot of flavors to explore.
If you are a dessert person do opt for the hot brownie served with ice or the beautiful apple and cinnamon pie. You won't be disappointed!

Food: 4/5
Ambience: 4.2/5

One of those places you definitely gotta visit if you're foodie. The non vegetarian food here will never disappoint you. From Kerala mutton to their Baked Bhetki, or the interesting take on Fish n Chips with their amazing Chicken and Fries, all the dishes are mouthwatering. The desserts here are worth drooling and not to miss out on.

Hospitality is of the top notch, and worth appreciating. Service is really quick.
Certainly not one of the regular dimly places you'll find around the city, Benjamin Bangalee mesmerizes you as soon as you enter. The place looks one out of the movies, with hand painted walls, yet has quite a pleasant and calm touch to it. The place is spacious unlike the other cramped up restaurants across the city and can easily accommodate 30+ heads at a time.

How to reach: Head along James Long Sarani towards Behala. A few minutes after crossing Behala Chowrasta, you'll find the place on your left.

Suggestion- Don't miss out on their Jumbo Roll. You'll love it!!

This joint is located at James Long Sarani near DM Hospital...it has been beautifully decoarated and has a good vibe...we were thinking of Indian food and hence ordered butter naan, butter tandoori roti, laccha paratha with chicken dishes like chicken tikka butter masala, chicken bharta and chicken korma...to my surprise the food was too good except the tikka dish...we really enjoyed our meal and craved for more. Lastly we finished off with caramel custard. We wanted an Indian desert but they still didnt have those in the menu which was a bit downer for me.  Ambience and decor is nicely done and staffs are well behaved and helpful. Seating is also very much comfortable. Overall it was a good experience.

How happy I'm to be blessed with a restaurant like Benjamin Bengalee which is just a few footsteps away from my residence. It's been here for 8 months now but I tried out this restaurant recently. It's located on James Long Sarani road and has a fair seating accommodation. The restaurant is beautifully decked up. Staff was courteous and looked after us well. We had ordered some fried rice and schezwan chicken. Food tasted too good and it was completely value for money. This is the reason why I'll frequently visit the restaurant. Takeaway is also available.

this place, near Thakurpukur on James Long, I visited with my wife, unplanned, for late lunch in afternoon, on the way to somewhere else.. it was quite and only few people were inside. the decoration is good, wall paintings and lighting were nice, (a bit managed with small space and budget and application of brain!) can accommodate 20/25 people, and menu cards had so many things! two boys i found who were serving, we ordered for simple mixed fried rice and chilly fish. well cooked, good quantity, good taste, (though we sprinkled little salt, but that is dependent on individual taste buds) and reasonable price. but one thing the service guy told me, that surprised me lot, he said he will serve as the customers are not allowed to serve themselves, as they make the table cloth dirty.. (oh boy, come on, but its very derogating; u r not correct for all). I advised him to buy few table mats!!! to conclude, i will say this is a good place for small family dine-out, value of money, and can promise better in future if they care few things. now Behala apart, Thakurpukur lacks good places as such.

Today I ordered Fried rice Chilli chicken combo via Zomato. Thank you Benjamin Bangalee for offering 10% discount on all orders.
The combo comprises 3/4 plate fried rice and 3 chilli chicken pieces.
Honestly speaking the food in terms of quality and quantity rose above my expectations. I presumed the quantity to be a bit low but it was pretty decent.
The food in terms of Taste was decent as well without a doubt..the quality was not at all an inferuor one. The rice was tasty and chicken were spicy..hence no compromise on the taste. The pieces of chicken were of moderate size.
The combo will surely fill your hunger pangs.
Great going Benjamin Great going Bangalee !!

The ambience was wonderful and the place was quite big and comfortable. We ordered Butter Tandoori Roti, Butter Nan and Lacha Parathas. The parathas were quite delicious. With these we ordered Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Korma and Chicken Bharta. The tikka butter masala was a dull one but except that every thing was perfect in taste. At last we finished off with a desert. Overall it was a good experience for us and I was going to rate them 4.5 but for that tikka butter masala the rating comes down to 4.

Yet another eat house on the James Long Sarani. Its located between Kadamtala and Thakurpukur on the left. Big spacious place with a couple of wall paintings nothing fancy. Around a 24 seater restaurant. Their menu card is never ending and serves a lot of varieties. Now I ended up ordering the basic Special Mutton Biryani and Chicken tikka butter masala. It was in all a disaster. Now a days even street side 70-80 rupees biryani walas serve better quality that what was served. And the Tikka Butter Masala was, I dont actually know what. Tasteless, over cooked, no taste of Tikka at all and butter??? there was none. If not the whole of behala, if you guys have to stay in the market with competitions from the James Long based restaurants then please buck up. U at this point in time are no where near to it.  A clear NO NO from me. Thank You. 
Gave 2 for the place was neat and spacious and the staffs were helpful and friendly.

Well! Well! the food here has really inspired me. I was totally taken aback by the taste, quantity and quality of the food that they have to offer. The service is quite quick with the friendly behaviour of the owner. The value that they give to the reviews of their customer is also appreciable.
Now coming back to the food, I had tried quite a lot of dishes starting from Rolls and Momos, to Malai Kebab, Biriyani, Fish Fry and Chowmein, etc.
The Rolls have a sumptuous amount of chicken cubes. The Momos are perfectly juicy and the complimentary soup that they offer with the momos are also quite great. What I can say about the Malai Kebabs- its a must try for all who visit, for its the best in this locality. The Biriyani is quite impressive and the quantity, I must  say, is also very good. The Chowmein which I tried twice, the first one I tried was really very good while the second time the chowmein was a little overcooked. 
All I can say is one must try and visit this place, which also greets you wonderfully. They have a view like street-side cafe which is also a new one in this area and also an eye candy.

Oh my god, this place probably serves the best rolls anywhere. Their Jumbo Roll is a must try, Chicken and Mutton till kababs, Paneer and loads of Mutton tikia, wrapped in a massive one foot long lacha paratha. They serve without sauce for an authentic mughlai taste, but you can request for sauce if that's the way you like it.

I had ordered chicken rolls, which were fine, but they didn't have any sauce. Just eatable. I ordered kabab and cheese corn momo, and I guess they mixed my order with someone else's and I was delivered two kinds of kabab momos (reshami and Tikka). The momos we're bad. Kababs were undercooked. Chicken steam Momo was the oiliest I have had till date. The worst however, (so far) has to be alu dum. OMG, dark brown onion gravy. Definitely and old preparation that they retouched for delivery. The first time I ordered, I was happy seeing the rolls were actually decent enough to be ordered again if I added some dressing myself. But this second home delivery has been so disappointing that I know I am never ordering again from here.

The mutton tested good. Only problem was the meat used was of an old goat. So it was not so easy on the teeth.

A little eating place, in the by lanes of James Long Sarani, it has won hearts with the wonderful owner's politeness, swift services and delicious food. Also, the fact that in a place like Thakurpukur, the kind of dishes they offer and at the highly affordable rates they offer. Please go for the Niramish thali (I personally love the moong dal with peas), the Parshe thali and of course Mutton jhol. I had Chicken Reshmi kabab and I loved the tenderness of the cooked meat. A thumbs up for all the good services.

Menu - 1 Chicken Biryani & Chicken Reshmi Kebab (8 Pcs)

Review;
Chicken Biryani was okish! it had 1 boiled egg 1 chicken and 1 alu! out of all the alu tasted awesome!! somewhat like fried in ghee <3 rest ok! except the boiled egg cause it had egg shells attached to it :3 quantity was also much! 
Chicken Reshmi Kebab (8 Pcs) okish! the chicken were on the harder side :/ anyways the sizes were huge i mean i couldn't finish it!! we ordered for Chicken Butter Reshmi Boneless (8 Pcs) gravy dish but due to miscommunication got this :/ our mistake was too not to check the bill at that moment :(

in total it was an okish experience!

Today, quality and quantity together is just a theory, yet this place made it true. As an icing on the cake, the owner is too friendly to the point of making a conversation. At this time of writing this review, the interiors aren't complete yet, so bear with that, but apart from that it is a delight to have such a good place nearby.

The place is good atleast looks good. New, not so decorated. The food is ok at best. Service is slow. But the manager/cashier is over-friendly, speaks too much english(most of the time wrong), not good at maths...

I went with a mind to have a quick bite & boy what a delicious Chicken roll it was.... Mind-boggling.. Better than anything I had before..... Their Kebabs, Biriyanis, I am told is equally delicious... A must for a foodie.

Simply awesome and delicious food,  you surely can't stop at one.  Very courteous service with value for money. The menu looked very appetizing. We ordered for a party and surely it was a super hit with all taking multiple rounds. The Kebabs were very well cooked, juicy and tender - perfect and the Biryani was delicious. For a non-mutton eater it was tender and flavorful. Need to try all the other dishes and would recommend ordering food from here without a doubt. Totally Recommending it to all who love good food !

I have been here once during my visit to Kolkata. It's an awesome joint for finger food. The owner is really courteous and the food is really tasty. The best part is light on pocket and the service is quick. Must open the delivery service soon!
