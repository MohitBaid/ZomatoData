It was panchami , after pandel hopping we saw this restaurant near the metro station , so without thinking twice we just entered there.
It has two sections AC and non AC . Prices are bit higher in AC section. We choose AC section .
We ordered full tandoori chicken , romali roti and full chilli Chicken .
According to the quantity and quality Prices are definitely higher . 
Tandoori chicken was okay but chilli Chicken was below Standard ! 
They need to work on Chinese section !
No extra charges are taken .

A pocket friendly restaurant located at the heart of Rashbehari. This is my one stop destination as its a pocket friendly restaurant. I frequently visit this place. Last Tuesday dropped down for Dinner , ordered a plate of mixed fried rice, a plate of egg fried rice and a plate of chilli chicken. The quality and quantity are good enough. Oh yes we also ordered Kesar Pista Kulfi and they were yum üòã also don't forget to try their tarka though its comparatively a bit costly.

Only suggestion please change the chairs please !! Otherwise good

I have been going to this place since my school days. I have had almost everything. Its located near the rashbehari crossing just beside nachhans dhaba.  Food is good. However  most of the times, a few dishes are unavailable. Moreover the management is not good,  interiors and decor is bad and they really need to work on themselves to survive the cut throat competion. But yes the food tastes well.

When I have no money or maid and I am on the go, I drop by at Sathi during the afternoon. For 80rs, you get rice,dal,subzi and maach. The fish piece is humongous in size and comes with an equally big piece of alu. People don't stare at you like they do in other aam janta hotels.

Often when I am running late returning home, they pack and keep my dinner ready. I am ready to vouch for their chicken bharta. The waiters know me, they are always ready with a smile.

This joint has more faults than fine points, but it has it's heart in the right place.

I was travelling from my office. Was feeling very much hungry. Before taking metro from Kalighat thought about to have some food. I have tested bachans dhaba at rashbehari number of time but this time i tried Sathi just beside the bachans dhaba.
Food quality was awesome with very nominal price. I have tried chicken Tandoori. Took the half potion of it.. Chicken was so fresh and well Marinated. Every bites was blissful. 
Ac portion is very good but rest was not so clean as it should be.

If you want home delivered Biriyani this isn't that bad an option but one must not rely on this place for good and delicious food. It serves the sort of Biriyani you eat when you have the sudden craving attack and you are stuck in the area and the other options are so bad that this place seems like heaven. I wouldn't totally recommend it.

Hotel Sathi is situated just near to the Rashbehari Crossing. It's a big restaurant with near around capacity of 60-70. Ambience is negligible. Price is reasonable. I just had a chicken roll and my friend ordered a egg roll. The Chicken Roll was superb. The size of the paratha was big. The chicken pieces were good both in terms of taste and size. The staffs were polite. So a 3.5 for them.

One of the popular places in and around Kalighat Metro area, one can find this right next to the much famed Bacchan's Dhaba. These guys serve more than one cuisine, but as per remarks and reviews, North Indian is quite good around here. Had tried Chicken Roll and Chicken Tandoor from this place. Both of them were quite good. The place has a Dhaba like feeling, which adds to the eating pleasure.

Well this is one of my favourite places to have some quick bite. The place is located just beside Kalighat Metro or the famous Bachan's Dhaba. The place serves all kinds of item from Indian to Chinese, but their Indian dishes are far better than the Chinesd Dishes.
They have two section. One the Non Ac and the other one is the AC section. There is no ambience or decor as such. Just sit and eat, a dhaba style place.
Food:
I love their Kathi Rolls. The Egg Chicken Roll is just too good.
The Rumali Roti and Chicken Do Pyaza is one of my favourite their.
The Chicken Haryali Kabab and Chicken Tandoor is always a good option.

The stress in your pocket will be very less and you would get some good food.
Always a good option.

We went there at the evening after being completely famished. We went to the AC section and ordered Rumali Roti, Palak Paneer, chicken Butter Masala. The rotis were very soft as they should be. Palak Paneer ¬†had ¬†only 5-6 meagre paneer pieces which was totally contradicting its cost. The Butter Masala was better with two huge chicken
pieces , price was on the higher side though.
The staffs were courteous and the service was prompt.¬†
The experience was not bad though and I will definitely visit this place again to hang out with my friends .

Hotel Sathi is in my locality and more than often I have enjoyed food from here, mostly home delivered! Surprisingly the taste of their food constantly rises up and down! For eg: one day you will be mesmerized with their kebabs and another day, they will seemingly appear bland! The North Indian chicken dishes are delicious.The place can do much better if they make attempts to project their uniqueness and not be satisfied by being a second fiddle to their neighbour, the Bachhan's Dhaba...why?

You have got to wait in a queue outside.Do try out their coolfi when you are there.

The ambience is always very chaotic. It is located in such a busy place that one cannot expect a very polished interior and tranquil ambience.

Now coming to food, must say they were really good. Especially the quantity of food & the strategy of Half plates. We ordered for half chicken tandoori , Veg Fried Rice, Half Butter Reshmi Kawab, Chilli Paneer & 2 Kulfis. Each Of them were too good and hence it deserves satisfactory points as food is what that matters to me the most.

Price is also moderate.Service is quick.

This restaurant is located nearby kalighat metro and just beside "Bachan's Dhaba". It has been in business for around a decade now. Having a moderate floor space the sitting arrangements are divided into two sections both A/C and non-a/c.

Well, I have visited this place last puja. I went into this place accidentally but was totally satisfied with the food. It is located just beside the Bachan's Dhaba. Well the ambience is very chaotic and may be that was because of the pujas. It is located in such a busy place that one cannot expect a very polished interior and tranquil ambience. Now coming to food, must say they were really good. Especially the quantity of food. We ordered for chicken biriyani and chicken butter masala. Both were too good and hence it deserves a 4 point as food is what that matters to me the most.

This restaurant is located nearby kalighat metro and just beside "Bachan's Dhaba". It has been in business for around a decade now. Having a moderate floor space and simple interiors, the sitting arrangements are divided into two sections both A/C and non-a/c. They serve north Indian, Chinese, mughlai cuisines and fast foods like rolls etc; and dessert like kulfi and all. The quality of their dishes are on the average side and the quantities served are quite decent too. But the service offered are very slack and the waiter are damn reluctant and uncourteous. Having a well established and reputed joint like "Bachan's Dhaba" just beside this joint, gives this outlet a tough competition and somewhere cause of its inefficient service and hospitality it lags behind in attracting crowd even after serving a good variety and moderate quality of cuisines. It really needs to improve their service quality and maintain courteous staffs to cope up with the competition.

Hotel Sathi is an average place where you can have some good food at reasonable rates. They serve delicious mixed tarka fry, tandoori chicken, mutton saag and hot rotis. ¬†Service is reasonably gd. Sometimes you¬†might have to wait for even for water and sometimes even food is served in shortest duration of time. Ambiance is simple bt ¬†food is certainly nice..and cheap.... Location is also a bonus !!!

The Kali Dal here is to die for. Even though usually I'm not fond of kali dal whenever I'm here my brother n I just gorge on Kali dal and butter naan. 
Besides that the paneer Gravy items are also nice here.
The service is super quick and it's very cheap as well.

Location---->> Located in Rashbehari Avenue , just opposite Kalighat Metro, it is towards Chetla and just next to Bachhan's Dhaba.

Been there ----->> I have been their specially for Rolls or a quick simple dinner.

Attraction------>> The first thing that will attract you to go inside the hotel is the kebabs that you will see from outside which looks delicious! The Chicken hariyali Kebab and Reshmi Kebab are just wonderful.

Things tried------->> I have tried several rolls from this Hotel  . Besides I have tried ‚Ä¢ Tarka ,‚Ä¢ Roomali roti,‚Ä¢ Tanddori Roti, ,‚Ä¢ Malai Kofta, ‚Ä¢ Kulfi.

Ambiance------->> The ambiance is pretty simple, nothing special here about the ambiance but of course you will not come here for ambiance but for its cheap price and good food quality. What you can expect is the place to be clean but you will be disappointed for sure. 

Food quality------->> This is the only good part of this Hotel. The food Quality is really good and for that you would  come here again and again. 

Food Quantity------>>  Food Quantity is adequate.

Price- ------->> Reasonable. 300-400 roughly for 2.

My recommendations -------->>  Hariyali kebab, Kulfi.

Bottom line--------->>  A good choice in the area if Bachhan's Dhaba is closed.
