Very good ambience. The food is very good too but I would say it is a bit overpriced. The kebabs are really good to taste. Staff behavior is friendly. Good place if you want to eat out with a large group.

Went there and had kebabs. The tandoori was okayish and the boti was nice. Am not a fan of dim lighting so that dint work with me. The rest did work for me. The service was good.

A quite average pocket friendly restaurant,  well arranged sitting,  average food with a below average service. This was the third time I visited the place as this is among one of the closest to my workplace. Since it is and average yet ok kind of restaurant,  whenever one is low on budjet can try this place.

After having some good reviews about its starters, I have decided to pay a quick visit at this place, and the experience was simply awesome. Ordered only starters and tasted two three awesome preparations. Looking forward for a full fledged ' vuribhoj ' very soon..

One of the old places to go to in Kolkata the decor is very same and very basic
Staff well its behavior towards you will depends on its own mood 
Now the food it's standard food not going amazing not below power 
CRISPY CHILLI BABY CORN-STANDARD ITEM BASIC TASTE  the vegetables were also fresh 

CHICKEN LOLLIPOP-TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS THE BEST DISH THERE. IT WAS JUST NOT NORMAL FRIED CHICKEN  IT WAS MUCH LIKE A PAKORA WHICH WAS PAN FRIED IN SAUCE

MIX HAKKA NOODLE-BASIC IN TASTE HAD PRAWNS CHICKEN EGG IT WAS LESS OILY AND HAD DECENT AMOUNT OF PROTEIN AND VEGES 

HONG KONG CHICKEN-A LIL DIFFERENT IN  TASTE HAD A LITTLE FLAVOR OF LIME AND LEMONGRASS AND DECENT AMOUNT OF CHICKEN ENOUGH FOR 3-4 TO BE FULL ON

Visited on a weekend with a friend for dinner.
Good food.Good ambience.Good decor.
Great place for a family dinner.
But the price mentioned here for two people of Rs.500 is wrong.It will be a minimum of Rs.850-900 cost for two people without alcohol.

One of those places where u don't feel the pocket pinch much . Indian , Chinese and Continental all available and at a much reasonable rate. Having a bar also helps in its foot fall. Good is just abt ok nothing great but not bad either. And yes ... they don't serve Biriyani. 
But it's the service that's needs a whole lot of improvements.. u will be served by people who will seem like a robot. Very mechanical and at times not that skilled either . Keep on dropping one thing or the other on the floor or table. 
The only attraction could be the pricing. 
We had a chicken sweet corn soup , Navratan Polao and Chicken Bharta. With GST the bill was 643/-
