I have to give really high marks to this outlet because i cant help it. Besides, this outlet is located inside the residential complex where I reside and thus, is at stone throw distance from my home. Not only that, the food and the options they provide are really impressive for such a small outlet. My recommendations would be chicken and cheese momo (steam and fried, both) and the chicken momo burger. One thing I should mention is the hygiene that they maintain here. Everything is clean and shiny, including the utensils and equipments they use to make those dishes. At times a few of their options given in the menu card may not be in their stock but dont be dissapointed, the alternatives wont turn you off. I sincerely hope they get help and spread further by partnering with some delivery party. This outlet, whenever I visit it, is always there to rescue me from my monster cravings. May this outlet keep growing further and make more people happy with what they have to offer. :)

Ordered chicken kothey.. it's just a different name for fried momo.. initially thought it  was something different.. going just by the name.. grossly over priced.. the packaging was good though.. came in a proper plastic box..

Dumpling momo serve different varieties of baozis and kothays.. 
Had chicken baozi from there which was nice but the soup needs to be improved..
