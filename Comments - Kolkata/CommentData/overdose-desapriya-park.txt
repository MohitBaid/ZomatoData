This is one another food joint from where we order frequently for our office lunch. They make good Chinese food and are reasonably priced. Their delivery time is also very fast along with neatly packed food.

We ordered chicken fried,  chilly chicken and mix noodles.  The taste was okay.  It's a one time eat place.  The taste is same as most Chinese restaurant.  And the use of sauce was too much which made it sour.

Great place to hangout for. Beautifully decorated,the actual brick texture added more flare. The service were also pretty fast and the behaviour of the manager is highly appreciable. The foods were also delicious,the only thing that I have an issue with is the quantity. The quantity of the food can be a bit more.

Location:Deshapriya Park Near Tea Trove. 

This was previously a take away joint but now they have made a seating space for a few people so we decided to dine in. 

We ordered:

Starters:

Lat Me Kai: This was delicious and the chicken pieces were amazing. 

Seafood Soup: The soup was really interesting with a lemony flavour. 

Panko Fish:The fish was flavourful and really soft on the inside. 

Mains:

Gravy Rice:The rice was a lot in quantity served with a flavourful Gravy with chunks of chicken and prawns. 

Hakka Noodles:The quantity  was huge with nice chunks of chicken and prawns. 

Chicken With Pakchoi:This dish was also really tasty.

This place initially started as a take-away joint and I often ordered food. Around last Pujo, they extended the space to include a medium-sized dining space. Hearing this, I decided to give it a try recently. The seating arrangement is very comfortable and the ambiance is soothing. 

We ordered Seafood Lemon Coriander Soup, Shanghai Dumplings, Lat-me-kai  and Panko Fish for starters. The soup is perfect for those who like a hint of lemon in it. The dumplings, fish and mat-me-kai were too delicious. 

For them main course, we ordered Gravy rice, hakka noodles and chicken with pakchoi. The quantity was huge, and each dish tasted too good. I totally plan to revisit Overdose and try the other food items on their menu!

Located just beside where tea trove, southern avenue was situated. This is a drive in and more of a take away joint, hence do not judge it by it's size or surface area.
They serve Chinese delicacies, made hot and at really pocket friendly prices.
I ordered for seafood Shanghai dimsums, chicken suimais , panko fish, lat me Kai chicken as starters.
Loved the seafood Shanghai dimsums and chicken lat me Kai. 
For the main course, kept it simple and settled for chicken fried rice, mixed halka noodles, chicken with pakchoi (a healthy choice) , and devil's prawns.
The food was very reasonable (140-190 range) and served fresh.

You should try their special item called the overdose special gravy Rice.. a bowl of steaming herbed rice surrounded with a thick gravy containing chicken, prawns, mushrooms and assorted veggies. This is your catch.
They serve in cars too, which is pretty convenient..also takeaway is always an option.

Went to this place with some of my buddies to try some of it's dishes. The place is Located on Sarat bose road road opposite to Desapriya Park... So it's not really hard to find it. As far as the ambience is concerned, the place is cozy and Good looking with a decent sit-and-dine area which can accommodate 15 people comfortably. So, it's recommended that you visit in small sized group. They also provide Drive in facility. As for the staffs, they were fantastic and service was pretty quick. Shoutout to the owner, who himself is an awesome personality.

Now, as far food is concerned, most of the dishes we ordered, were Awesomely cooked. Though thrre are few, which need some more improvements. We ordered:

Starters:-
◆Seafood Lemon Coriander Soup - 5/5 (Best soup Ever tasted I must say)
◆Chicken Shu-Mai - 4/5 (They can do a bit more improvisation to make it taste awesome)
◆Seafood Shanghai Dumpling - 4/5
◆Lat-Me-Kai - 5/5 (Only one word - FANTASTIC)
◆Panko Fish - 5/5

Main Course:-
●Overdose Special Gravy Rice - 5/5 (Highly recommended maincourse if you take my advice for this place)
●Mixed Hakka Noodles - 5/5 ( Cooked tenderly, hence was an awesome delight)
●Devils Prawn - 5/5
●Chicken With Pakchoy - 5/5

In total, had a great time with friends at this awesome place. Will surely visit again.

Been to this really nice place near Deshapriya Park.

AMBIENCE - This place is quite small to accommodate huge numbers BUT it's cosy and nice. The brick walls add to the good ambience. ☺

FOOD - Had Sea Food Lemon Coriander Soup, Chicken Sui Mai, Sea Food Shengai Dumpling, Lat Ma Kai, Panko Fish, Overdose Special Gravy Rice, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Devils Prawn and Chicken with Pakchoi.
*The Soup was really appealing, especially in the winters.
*The Dumplings really good and served hot.
*Loved the Panko Fish.
*The Gravy rice was impressive both by the way it eas served and how it tasted.
So overall the food was good and pretty reasonable.


SERVICE - The Service time is really quick. And the staffs were courteous. And special mention of the owner who was courteous as well. Cheers to the team. ✌

So, this is a must visit place while you are running a lil low on budget or searching for a pocket friendly place. ☺

A compact Chinese food joint where it's worth overdosing on the delicious dishes. Located near Sarat Bose Road, Overdose provides the option of dine in or delivery, as comfortable, and also drive in facility is available. They can accommodate around 15 people altogether, so it's preferred you go there with small group of friends. The interior is well decorated and service was really good. The staff was polite. Coming to the food, every dish tastes absolutely scrumptious and the flavours had a perfect balance. The quality and quantity of the food is commendable. The portions of each dish is really a lot, and I suppose that's what justifies their name as Overdose. I thoroughly enjoyed every food item. Also their menu is extensive so it's pretty hard to choose from.

Food we ordered :
STARTERS
▶Seafood Lemon Coriander Soup
▶Chicken Sui Mai
▶Seafood Sanghai Dumpling
▶Lat-me-kai
▶Panko Fish

MAIN COURSE
▶Overdose Special Gravy Rice
▶Mixed Hakka Noodles
▶Devils Prawn
▶Chicken with Pakchoy

Lat-me-kai and Devils prawn were my personal favourites. Highly recommended. The soup was good and if you prefer mild flavours over rich, you'll sure love it. Also the noodles were cooked really well. Tried such brilliant Chinese food after a very long time. Perfect place to grab a sumptuous meal with your buddies over great conversations.

This is yet another authentic Chinese restaurant in Kolkata you need to try! Look for their delicious Seafood Lemon Coriander Soups and Seafood Shanghai Dimsums. It’s a small, cozy restaurant located near the Desapriya Park,Sarat Bose Road, Lake Market, Kalighat, Kolkata. 

And also try Overdose Special Gravy Rice and Chicken with Pakchoi  if you want to try something amazing when hungry. This restaurant thoroughly deserves to be in the list of best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. It also has a takeaway facility.

Places which has good food dont have to wait for the customers, the customer themselves find them and walk in. How often you see a food delivery only joint turns into a restaurant on public demand? I guess Zero in my Knowledge but this particular place has done this. It was really interesting to know that how their journey has been so beautiful in this recent time and their rating speaks for themselves. 

A mentioned above this was food delivery joint turned restro has very limited sitting capacity of around 20 people at once. The newly made place is designed simply with the brick only left walls with some decent lightings and transparent glass for outside view. You can see the kitchen yourself as it is in front.

Overdose has got total overdose of lip smacking menu and what makes it more special is the rates they offer you. So the Menu was little short for me but they were:

1. Seafood lemon coriander soup

2. Devil's prawn 

3. Mixed Hakka noodles

4. Mixed Rice

I was little disappointed with the Seafood Soup but all the other items were perfectly ok with the taste and nicely balanced with the spices. Rice and Noodles contained good amount of Egg chicken and Prawn and one bowl is sufficient for two people. Whereas Devil prawn complemented both pretty well.

Location: Next stop from desapriya park towards southern avenue next lane from Maharani Tea shop.
It is basically a take away joint and drive in joint :)
Overdose only offer Chinese cuisine which is best in taste.. We ordered:
Chicken sui mai ,Lat ma kai Chicken, Panko fish, Mixed Hakka noodles,Mixed Fried Rice ,Devils Prawn and Chicken with Pak choi.
All the dishes were too good in taste specially lat me kai chicken and devils prawn as I like spicy food for non spicy lover they can opt for chicken with pak choi which is made in a lite gravy..
A pocket friendly restaurant for school and college goers and the quantity satisfies 2 hungry tummy .. Hope to try more dishes from here.

This place is conveniently located Sarat Bose Road. It's diagonally opposite to the Furniture shop in that lane.
Had a great time with my friends this evening at this place. It's more of a take away joint with an advantage of giving the customers a place to relax n have gupshup while waiting for the delivery.
Food we ordered are:
Seafood lemon coriander soup
Chicken sui mai
Shanghai seafood dumpling
Lat mokai
Panko fish
Overdose special gravy rice
Mixed Hakka noodles
Devil's prawn
Chicken with Pakchoi
All the above mentioned items are yummy and great in quantity!
Panko fish is my personal favourite though.

A small but nice restaurant located in Sarat Bose Road beside The Tea Trove. It's a great place to eat if you are looking for a pocket friendly place and hence is mainly visited by college students. Both the quality and quantity of food are amazing here. For starters, we ordered Lat-me-kai which was quite tasty. In the main course, Burnt Garlic and Capsicum Rice is a must try along with the Kung Pao chicken.

The staff here is extremely polite and they will even suggest you what's good here. Overall a good experience and will definitely visit again.

today ordered from this outlet via another delivery app. tried chicken hakka chow and chicken lat me kai . had a great expectation after seeing the reviews. but it came to me as total disaster. lat me kai was horribly hot...lots of chillies just made us mad like anything. the chow was having very minimal veggies and chicken/egg. it was very dry , something like the chow from roadside roll center. not sure how the reviews and real experience differ in such a way.

11jan18: really appreciate the good gesture from the owner. this time food was really good. want to mention the chicken shumai dimsum specially. ot was really awesome. hence revised the rating.

This is undeniably one of the best cafe’s offering food within a small budget. Ambiance and hospitality is spot-on. We ordered the Lat-Me-Kai and the Shanghai Dumplings. The chicken was perfectly cooked in both cases and the former was just the right amount of spicy. However the dumplings were a bit bland and dry on the mouth. Overall this is a place which should be on everybody’s go-to for a quick ‘cafe-ing’ with friends.

Located in the lanes of deshapriya park, this small restaurant is at one of the corners of the place. We ordered chinese- chilli garlic chicken noodles and manchurian chicken. The noodle tasted well with some good amount of chicken and eggs. Also the quantity was okayish. But manchurian chicken was very spicy and the amount was less compared to the price.
 Also the place is not very spacious. Hence its not good for large gatherings.

This restaurant is a gem of a place among restaurants in the city.  Run a by a very suave young man, this place packs a punch and throws up challenge to the mighty places in town. 

Located near Deshapriya Park-Landsdown crossing,in the lane opposite to the Baskins Robins store, the place serves fantastic Chinese.
 
 The sitting arrangement is basic and limited and the restaurant seats around 15 people at the most.  The decoration is soothing and the live kitchen can be seen through the partition. The tables are so small that you would have to compromise with the no. of dishes you keep on them. The menu is limited which I believe adds to their advantage. The waiters though are under trained and clumsy and that creates a bit of an eye sore. In case you are looking for a fine dining experience, this place is not for you.

However, they treat you with their food. And that's their USP. It's difficult to enlist the names of all the dishes I have tried for I have been visiting the place for more than an year now and have tasted their entire menu. I suggest one to go for their Dimsums and Prawn. You may also take suggestions from the owner. Visit this restaurant with great expectations and they are surely to satisfy you.

Located near deshapriya park is this small restaurant with affordable & amazing food..ordered lemon coriander soup, chicken pan fried noodles & lat me kai.. noodles & lat me kai tasted great..must try.
The soup was okayish..the lemon in the soup could have been lesser..pocket pinch is low..some mouth freshner at the end of the meal would have been great. 😀
Overall, a great joint serving amazing chinese food at affordable prices.. Definitely gonna try out the other dishes.

This restaurant is a gem of a place among restaurants in the city.  Run a by a very suave young man, this place packs a punch and throws up challenge to the mighty places in town. 

Located near Deshapriya Park-Landsdown crossing,in the lane opposite to the Baskins Robins store, the place serves fantastic Chinese.
 
 The sitting arrangement is basic and limited and the restaurant seats around 15 people at the most.  The decoration is soothing and the live kitchen can be seen through the partition. The tables are so small that you would have to compromise with the no. of dishes you keep on them. The menu is limited which I believe adds to their advantage. The waiters though are under trained and clumsy and that creates a bit of an eye sore. In case you are looking for a fine dining experience, this place is not for you.

However, they treat you with their food. And that's their USP. It's difficult to enlist the names of all the dishes I have tried for I have been visiting the place for more than an year now and have tasted their entire menu. I suggest one to go for their Dimsums and Prawn. You may also take suggestions from the owner. Visit this restaurant with great expectations and they are surely to satisfy you.

One of the most affordable restaurants near Deshapriyo Park, Overdose is located exactly beside where The Tea Trove used to be. You'll find it in a lane on your left if you're walking towards Deshapriyo Park. The lane is just opposite to Baskin Robbins, Southern Avenue.

The decor is nothing grand but the brick styled walls catch your attention. The place can accomodate around 12-15 people. Their starters are simply lip smacking. Although their main courses are tasty, they are not as good as the starters. I don't really remember the exact names of the dishes so avoiding it here. The experience was a good one. My friend took me there for a treat. Even though we completely filled our tummies, the bill wasn't much.

Try this little gem when in Southern Avenue/Lake Stadium area. You can reach the place through the lane at the left side of Lake Mall.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 600 for two (approx.)

I had ordered for steamed momos, the lat mat kai and Hakka noodles.  The momos were great however the lat mat kai that everyone so highly recommends was terrible. It smelt, tasted spoilt and was undercooked. The least one can do for a delivery order is to taste the food and rectify it before sending it. If the order then gets delayed you can still inform the customers. That, would still be better than sending spoilt food. Terrible experience don't think I would ever order from here again.

A small Chinese joint hidden in the by lanes of Deshpriya Park promises to blow your mind with an #Overdose of flavour!
The ambience is warmly lit with red and yellow lights and rimmed with brick wall. It can accommodate 10-12 people at one go.
The starters are as lip-smacking as the main course and good in proportion to fill up two poeple per plate.
Lung fu soup - Its light and frothy, perfect to rejuvenate after a hard day. Spices are mild and every spoonful gives you a yummy eggy taste.
Tom yum soup - Sour and spicy, this soup will surely warm up chilly Winter evenings. Not for the light hearted, it just bangs on your taste bud with its flavours.
Seafood Suimai - It has a sweet natural taste of prawn which is the main stuffing, comes with special chilli oil. Its nice and best recommended for those who avoid spicy food.
Shanghai@ Dumpling - Nice healthy dish with chicken stuffing paired with special chilli oil
Lat Me Kai - Tasty lip-smacking dry chilli chicken, a perfect side dish with gravy noodles.
Overdose Special Noodles - Spicy tasty noodles tossed in mild spices and assortment of veggies and chicken.
Overdose Special Rice - Mildly spicy rice with a tasty gravy loaded with veggies and tossed chicken that will keep you slurping.
Crispy Honey Chilli Wonton - My favourite dish from this restaurant has to be this one. Couldn't help munching away as many as I could. The perfect blend of honey, soy sauce and chillis with crisp wonton filled with yummy stuffing.
Chicken With Pakchoy - Soft chicken pieces tossed in light gravy accompanied with blanched Pakchoy. A light and nutritious dish.
Coriander Fish - Another mind blowing dish, Basa tossed in yummy coriander gravy. Pairs best with plain rice or noodles.
The service is quite fast and waiters are courteous.
Will visit soon for more Overdose to my taste buds!

Located very near to deshapriya park this small eatery serves up good food at reasonable rates.
The ambience is nothing noteworthy,just about okay.
I have tried their chicken hakka noodles,lat me know and dragon chicken on my previous visit and totally loved each of the items served.On my last visit I tried their Non Veg Suimai which was a very unique dish,when it was served trust me the smell scared my friend and me!!!smelled so horrible!!But when we added the tempered spring onions and that awesome chutney to it,the taste simply won our taste buds and the smell vanished!!!At 130rs this this is a stellar! Would come back soon for trying the other dishes!

Overdose, a hidden gem which is giving neck to neck competition to the big renowned names in the same field with the quality of food they are serving and ofcourse the quantity, which is a must mention. Located in Desapriya Park is very easy to locate, can accomodate almost 16 heads under one roof; decorated decently and pleasingly in its own way keeping in mind that the space is less. The service is prompt, the staffs are very courteous and always available to help you with the menu.

Found out another super affordable oriental restaurant near the deshapriya park area.
● Location: Going towards lake/southern avenue from deshapriya park 4 point crossing, take the lane right opposite to Baskin Robins. It's situated on the left hand side of the lane just where The Tea Trove used to be.
● Ambience: Tiny yet very cosy. dimly lit. Can accommodate 10-12 people at a go.
● Food:
◆ Starters: lip smacking starters. each one is Recommended.
* Lung fung soup: light, frothy, clear soup. Tastes heaven on a chilly winter day.
* Tom yum soup: the well-known spicy Thai soup that is sure to blow your mind and get you heated up even in the winters.
* Seafood suimai: prawn stuffings inside a dumpling, steamed and served with the Overdose special chilli oil made with Sesame oil, green chillies and white wine vinegar.
* Shanghai dumpling: a very unique variety of chicken dumplings, steamed and served with the same Overdose special chilli oil.
* Lat Me Kai: a crispy version of dry chilli chicken. So good!
* Crispy honey chilli wonton: crispy wontons tossed in soy sauce, honey and chillies.
◆ Main Course:
* Overdose spcl Rice: a bowl of well cooked Chinese rice surrounded by a pool of pan tossed chicken & veggies in a gravy. So unique. So yum!
* Overdose spcl Noodles: well tossed noodles with loads of chicken & veggies. Simple yet the classic.
* Chicken with pakchoy: well poached shredded chicken tossed in a light gravy along with pakchoy.
* Corriander fish: shallow fried Basa fish tossed in a corriander gravy.

It was a sumptuous meal altogether. The only regret was the unavailability of pork on the menu. Never mind though, looking forward to another visit real soon.

Fare episode!

Do you know euphoria? I propituously received it from Monks. It was gross delight to acquire the overdose of cuisine. And this property might be tiny to accomodate more than 12 people, nevertheless it's good eatery house to have a marvelous date with food.

Thus, dose began with Lung Fung soup, and Tomyum soup. And both the platters were flavorful. Further there were Seafood suimai, Shanghai dumpling, Lat Me Kai and Crispy Honey Chilli Fried Wanton. Most toothsome was the Wanton, as it tasted fabulously delicious cause of its crispy form and the honey chilli sauce. However, other preparations were very palatable too. Esteemed every bite of them. And for the main course there were Overdose special rice and Noodles, Chicken with Pakchoi, and Coriander fish. All of them were extremely nectareous. Utterly revered it. 

Thanks Monks and Rajdeep Seth for providing me chance to 'munch' humongous diversity of food.

Located in Sarat Bose Road, easy to locate this place serves amazing chinese at an affordable price.

AMBIENCE - This is a very small place, provision for 12people dining at a time. The brick style interiors looks good, the ambience is average, but the food makes up for all the cons.

FOOD- Ordered chicken steam momos, Lat me kai, Burnt ginger chicken fried rice, Overdose special chicken. Boy, the dishes! Each & every dish was on point. The Lat Me Kai & Overdose special chicken was heavenly, do try.
Update : Tried their Seafood Coriander Lemon Soup, Mixed Fried rice with all time fav overdose special chicken. The soup was yum, though I would have preferred a little less lemon. 

SERVICE- Not much to say about this. Well behaved staff.

POCKET PINCH- Pocket friendly place, 500 for two.
Strongly recommended.

Although the name of this restro carries with it the expectations for a really funky,posh gastro pub your excitement will at first be slightly dampened by the little joint tucked away in one of the bylanes of deshopriyo park..overshadowed by the familiarity of tea trove also in that lane...and the disappointment will continue with the lack of attention to detail perhaps maybe cause they were renovating..but it stops right there...cause when it comes to the food...the delicious chinese they promise to serve and what comes out from behind the smooth sliding door is something that makes you forget about the decor and the size of this little place..cause it's something that traces your synapses to the old expression that never judge a book by it's cover...and as you go through the pages...rather go through your meal... you're left with a sense of pleasant satisfaction consolidated by the fact that they don't charge taxes..atleast not now.....and yes it's a dose of flavour that makes you wanna come here again..and that i think rightly describes the name.

Ordered a few times. Good soups. Specially the hot n sour chicken soup. The pan fried noodles is nice. Overall food quality is good. The quantity is  less compared to other Chinese restaurants. Also, they charge 10 rs per plastic box for delivery, which is ridiculous. I have always ordered for home delivery as i stay just opposite to the restaurant, hence cannot talk about the dine in experience.

This place is located on Sarat Bose road, just five minutes away from Deshopriya Park more. The place to honest is very small and has a capacity for around 12-13 people. The brick decor is nice but so far ambience is concerned it's just average. The food on the other had is pretty good. The prices are cheap but at the same time I have to say the chicken pieces are not too big. But the food tasted truly great and the service was really nice. The manager was really polite and orders came quickly. I would surely come back here just for the food !

This place is located exactly next to Tea Trove.A very small joint with absolutely delicious food. The place can accommodate up to 16 people. Ambience wise it's quite cosy.After the waiter brings the food on your table , you are expected to serve yourself as this food joint has the motto of self service.
Coming to the food:
We ordered 1) Lat me kai : It tasted delicious. It was crisp and perfect with all the ingredients forming an amazing blend
2) Chicken pan fried momo : Once again too good.
3) Dry devil's prawn : This was way too spicy and way too tasty.The prawns were fresh.
4) Mixed pan fried noodles : There cannot be a single bit of negative criticism on this one as well.
Overall both the quality and quantity were very satisfying.
Would love to visit this place soon.

After reading rave reviews about the sui mai at this place, I decided to have a look at their page. I think the menu at the Zomato page is outdated. The items are actually priced higher, which I got to know after I dined in at the joint. 
It is a small place but with nice, minimalistic decor. We ordered the chicken sui mai and Schezwan sui mai. Priced at Rs 150 and Rs 160 respectively. 
As far as my understanding goes, any form of dumpling is supposed to be juicy and soft. Though the filling was tasty, it was far from being either juicy or soft. The presentation was beautiful and the dip was mild on the palate, but the all in all the dish failed to live up to the great expectations I had from it.

Used to be one of my favorites. Visited the outlet after 6 months, and very disappointed to find such degradation in food quality. The décor has been improved but the quality of food has gone down to a large extent. First of all, they are still serving the puja menu ( gosh! It's November!!) which misses out most of the items ( including my all time favorite suimai dimsum). We ordered fish pepper salt, Szechuan fried rice and Overdose special chicken. Fish could hardly be found in the first dish. Rice and chicken were okayish, not up to the mark. Terribly disappointed. Never coming back again.

Not much to be said about the ambience but don't let that fool you. Serving Lip-smacking Chinese at very reasonable rates this place deserves a try. Tried their momos, lat me kai, overdose special chicken, mixed fried rice, burnt ginger rice and each item tasted equally good. Pocket pinch is on the lower side. A meal for two would cost around 600. Quantity is pretty good.

Who doesn't like getting OD-ed with food to some extent, right?
"Of all the drugs there be, you chose food."
So without indulging in deadwood, let's talk business.
Finding location was a no-brainer. Boi such a tiny booth. Somehow a dozen of people will make the red dot of max limit beep. 
Balancing the lack of one aspect with emending another is a good game. 
Food makes it up for it. 
Traditional Asian cuisine. No fancy, euphuistic item names on menu card. 
I've decided to list it like that as well. 
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: A tad bit inclined on the spicy side, this set the taste buds on fire; in a good way. Crispy, fiery and yummy. 
Pan Fried Momo: Delectably juicy momos with solid gulp fillings. One of the main strikers in a small package.
Burnt Garlic Capsicum Fried Rice: Traditional fried rice, with a refreshing aroma of burnt garlic and topped with sliced bell papers. 
Pan Fried Noodles Gravy: Always a scorer. Semi-fried noodles served in a thick gravy, delivering just the needed crunch and sap. 
Kung Pao Chicken: With perfectly sauted veggies in varied cuts, the coating of chicken blended smooth with papillae. Soft chunks dripping with extract. MVP.
Panko Crumb Fish (gravy): So they say. I hardly felt any essence of panko crumbs. Not only that, the fish wasn't fresh. The most anticipated dish turned out to be the major bummer. Tho they apologized and offered another refil/change, but we were out of it and thought to rest it. 

A mishap can be ignored but not really; when you're being a professional in the culinary world. But nvm that, since they really set a standard of good food at good price that is applaudable. I'd place it under recommendation list hence.

So ordered food two hours ago . Actually more than two hours ago . And still no sign of it. Maybe the cook or the delivery boy overdosed  . Avoid delivery if you want to eat , as you may starve before the food arrives  . Restaurant said they would call to inform me of where the delivery is . Like the food I am still waiting for that . Great service . Overdose rating 0 zomato 0 . Cannot seem to give them less than 1 but it is a big fat zero

In the city of joy, Kolkata, there is many small and big joints or restaurants serving Chinese cuisine but only few actually manage to create that delighting or fascinating and live up to our expectations.  Talking of one such places, Overdose, is quite a familiar name and very popular for its Chinese cuisines. Undoubtedly one of the best places to have authentic Chinese and pleasing sea food at Desopriyo Park area with varieties of options to choose from and  satisfy the palate. Located at a very prime spot, 23, Lake Terrace, Sarath Bose Road, Desapriya Park, Kolkata. Interiors are done simple yet elegant with a seating capacity of 16-20 people in one go. The décor isn’t out of the world but decent enough for one to please their senses. Talking about the food here, it seems they maintained the authenticity of preparations, without much experimentation to impress and satisfy Indian palate.In terms of service …Well no points that I can deduct. Thumbs up to their cook along with the service boys.

Now coming up to the food matter… 

>Seafood Lemon Coriander Soup -Rs 160 – Good one to start with…A soup with veggies and herbs incliding the sea foods such as fish, prawn, squids with mushroom and chicken.

>Chicken Suimai- Rs 90 – Dimsums being stuffed with cooked chicken and veggies. The coating is thick which should be thin to get the real flavor of chicken for which it was missing. Even felt undercooked.

>Chicken Sanghai Dimsum – Rs 105 – Same as the above. They need to check it on this. The outer layering is so thick that it’s killing up the taste.

>Lat Me Kai🐓- Rs 150 – The best. We ordered it twice. This was the most recommended one. It’s crispy and spicy. Basically an item of chicken made so beautifully that it hits my taste bud. Will be visiting again for this. Thumbs up…!!

>Crispy Honey Chicken 🐓 – Rs 150-  Yes.. It’s really crispy and tangy as well as the  addition of honey in it making it littel sweet too. Loved this one. Recommended.

>Dry Panko Fish- Rs 220 – A fish item which has being cooked with chinese sauces. It’s dry and good in taste.

>Dry Devil’s Prawn 🍤 – Rs 320- The prawn being fried with acoating and tossed with tangy and spicy sauces. Really spicy one.. You need to get a glass of water for this. Loved this spicyness.

>Chicken Burnt Ginger Capsicum Rice. – Rs 130 – Basically a fried rice which includes chicken and the main flavor which hits the tastebuds is the burnt ginger which has been added to it. It’s spicy and good in taste.

>Overdose Special Chicken. – Rs 180 – A gravy item of chicken which is spicy too. Cooked with some chineswe sauce. It was served relly hot and along with fried rice it’s just nice.

>Chicken with Pakchoy- Rs 200 – Chicken dish being cooked in a white gravy having distinct flavor of Pakchoy basically a chinese leaf. Good but light in taste.

>Chicken Panfry Noodles – Rs 135 – Fried noodles with the light masala flavours with added mixed  vegetables, chicken, egg, prawn and mushrooms in it.

Overdose ...  We really got overdosed. As the price of the dishes are reasonable enough it will help you to order as your pocket doesn't hit much. My definition of reasonable includes quantity factor too. As per the quantity matching with prices.. I say it is as a reasonable outlet for Chinese food and prices are pretty reasonable compared to other restaurants over that area. 

Food quality on a whole is pretty good ... Just a few steps ahead towards catching up some big hot shot restaurants in the city like bar b q, tung fong etc. 

In terms of service ...Well no points that I can deduct. Thumbs up to their cook along with the service boys.

Located near Deshapriya Park area on the way of Sarat Bose-road heading towards Rabindra Sarovar Lake, you will find a right lane after taking to this way where the restaurant is situated ie, 23, Lake Terrace.

The restaurant is small with a brick decor having a seating capacity of around 14-16 persons.Coming up to the ambience.. Don't expect any ambience,basically it's a delivery joint. Nevertheless you can dine in.

Now coming up to the food matter... Here we go...!!

As I use to mention the best items in my blog first. So here I go with it only. The most recommended one was Lat Me Kai (Chicken Prepartion), the best in the menu and other good items are Dry Panko Fish, Crispy Honey Chicken and Dry Devil's Prawn.

This small Chinese Joint near Desapriya Park was in my bucket list for a long time and finally the dreams come true, when I visited this restaurant 2days ago with my friends. The small joint offers you some finger licking Chinese cuisine which is really wonderful. So let’s come and explore this place.

Positive Points –

1.	Great quality food – All food we tried were awesome in one word. Both is quantity wise and quality wise, it was great. Taste wise in some cases, it can easily competes with the other big hot shots.

2.	Cheap pricing – Compare to the other restaurant situated in the South Kolkata, the place is really a cheap one. Pricing of every item was really decent.

3.	Service & management – One of the best service I observed till now. The service boy named Rajesh, really impressed us a lot with his super skilled efficient service. Kudos to the management also for the fast serving food.

Negative Points – 

1.	Spacing – The spacing of this restaurant is really a big issue here. With basic chair table sitting, the restaurant can accommodate maximum 15-18 persons at a time.

Now come to the food. We ordered –

 Soups –

1.	Seafood Lemon Coriander Soup – The soup was like Coriander soup with shredded seafood items in it. Thick in shape and well mixed. Coriander touch added some special flavor in it with some vibrant color also.

Dim sum – 

1.	Chicken Sui Mai Dim sum – One of the best Dim sum ever had. The mixture of shredded chickens and veggies were tightly packed in a thin layer coating. 6pieces Dim sum were served with special chutney. Love the taste and the presentation.

2.	Chicken Shanghai Dim sum – Another most popular Dim sum here. The Dim sum was full packed with shredded Chicken. Sesame seed over the top with little onion leaf touch makes the dish super attractive. Awesome in one word.

Starter –

1.	Lat-Me-Kai – Small sized chicken pieces were well cooked with finned cut onion, capsicum and onion leaves. Little tangy and spicy this dish was absolutely okay as a starter.

2.	Dry Devils’ Prawn – After the chicken, we headed for the Prawn. The Prawn was crispy fried with lots of other veggies. Dry nature makes the item excellent as a starter. Full recommended item.

3.	Dry Panko Fish – Well marinated and well cooked fish pieces were beautifully cooked with onion and capsicum.  Love it.

4.	Crispy Honey Chicken – Another beauty straight from the kitchen. The chicken pieces were first fried in crispy way. Then the honey and the sesame seed touch over the chicken pieces makes it just wow. Must try item here.

Main Course & Side Dishes – 

1.	Chicken Burnt Garlic Capsicum Rice – Well cooked rice were perfectly tossed with small chicken pieces. Fried onion over the rice added some serious smell. Love it.

2.	Mixed Pan fried Noodles – Fried noodles were well stirred with diced veggies, chicken, egg and prawn. The item goes excellent with any gravy item. Must try item here.

3.	Overdose Special Chicken – Soft juicy chicken pieces were well cooked with spicy hot gravy. A must try item for chilly lovers. Onion and Capsicum also added some extra flavor into it.

4.	Chicken with Pak choy – White gravy chicken side dish. The dish was lite in flavor and the chicken pieces were well cooked with Chinese cabbage. The dish goes excellent with any spicy rice or noodles.

So in conclusion, I will say Over Dose is one of the best pocket friendly Chinese restaurant in its area. With some serious good quality food, professional service and decent pricing it really stole my hearts away. Overall an excellent dining experiences and will definitely visit this restaurant again.

There's no surprise that Kolkata is a city full of hidden gems. Overdose is one of them serving pocket friendly mouth-watering Chinese dishes in a small dining.
 
The ambiance of this place is decent for the space they have. Somehow they have managed sittings for 10-12 people comfortably. Brick walls creates a texture on walls and warm whites lights creates the ambiance.

We were 11 people in total & following were our menu. We took 2 of each portion and surprisingly they served it pretty well and very fast.

Soup :
----------------
Seafood Lemon Coriander Soup : Very light to taste with the flavour of seafood. It was white soup with some green leaves on top and seafood was cut into very small pieces and mixed.
 
Dimsum :
------------------
Chicken Suimai Dimsum : Solid dimsums with chicken and veggies pouring inside that tasted very light & simple.
 
Chicken Sanghai Dimsum : It was same as Suimai, solid and filled inside. It also tasted similar but the shape was different.
 
Starters :
--------------------
Lat-Me-Kai : Small chicken pieces mixed with fine cut onions and green chilli. Hot & spicy it tasted. Everybody in our group enjoyed this dish so much that they ended up ordering another plate of it.
 
Crispy Honey Chicken : This dish was lovely, Tangy, Crispy & Spicy. Chicken pieces made well balanced with the sweetness of honey and hotness of chinese spices that tasted too good. I liked this dish more than Lat-Me-Kai.
 
Dry Panko Fish : Soft well cooked fish pieces cooked with chinese spices and vegetables. Tasted pungent and its ideal for people bored with chinese chicken starters.
 
Main Course :
--------------------------
Mix Pan Fried Noodles : Mixed boiled and crispy fried noodles with mixed diced vegetables, chicken, egg, prawn and mushrooms, this dish was enjoyable even without any side dish.
 
Chilli Garlic Noodles : Thick red noodles with the rich flavour of garlic. This noodles itself tasted very hot & spicy, much suited with white gravy side dishes.
 
Chicken Burnt Ginger Capsicum Rice : Simple steamed rice with a lite flavour of ginger. It tasted very lite and suitable with every other side dish.

Dry Devil's Chicken : Hot & Spicy , devil's chicken is always popular in Chinese menu. Here they made it little more hot & spicy.
 
Overdose Special Chicken : Chicken pieces tasted extremely good, Gravy was extremely hot. Suitable for chilli lovers.
 
Chicken with Pakchoy : A white gravy chicken dish with Chinese cabbage. This dish have its own distinct mild flavour. Its better to have with garlic or any other hot & spicy noodles.
 
Pricing :
----------------
Best part about this small place is their pricing is also very small on pocket. Searching good quality food for pocket friendly price is little hard in this area, so Overdose is . Quantity they serve per plate is manageable for 2 persons.
 
Conclusion :
------------------------
Overdose is a pure dose of chinese dishes, not really authentic chinese but more of hot & spicy chinese that most people love. Their food not only look vibrant in colour they also taste pungent.

Went for a friend's birthday treat on Sunday evening. Easy to locate. A small joint with 3-4 tables. Not very much decorated But love that friendly ambiance. The owner was so friendly that he helped us with food selection. He suggested us Overdose special chicken, Kungpao chicken and fish with pak choi. Along with these we ordered steamed veg momo, pan fried veg momo, veg fried rice, veg Hakka noodles. Steamed momo came with spicy schezwan sauce which was the only best part of that dish cause momos were bit dry. Pan fried momo was heavenly delicious with perfect seasonings. Rice was tad bland but quantity was enough for four of us. Noodle dish was unexpectedly delicious and enough quantity was served. Both the chicken preparations tasted almost same to us. Only exception was the cashews present in the kung pao chicken.Fish gravy was delicious with generous amount of pak choi and the smell of this preparation was mouth watering. Our overall experience was quite good and it's quite cheap. no added tax,which is a boon. I'll recommend this eatery to everyone.

After reading all good reviews about this place finally we decided to visit,  the restaurant is small but very beautiful interior design, behavior of their staff is also very good,  now coming to food,  we ordered Crispy Honey Chicken, Black Pepper chicken and Boiled Chicken momo,  and all the 3 items were m@ore than good, taste was awesome and quality was also good.. We didn't try main course as we are going to visit again to try main course but all the 3 starters we had were awesome. Total bill was 470/- which is too good. 
Final Verdict - if you want to have some delicious Chinese food at reasonable price then this place is for you.

Had been there during the Durga puja. We had to wait outside the restaurant for nearly 30 mins which is exepected due to the rush. A small but appealing restaurant with maximum 20 seating capacity.
What we ordered:-
1) Crispy chilli baby corn as a starter which stimulated our hunger .
2) One Hakka veg noodles 
3) Two pan fry chicken noodles.
4) One veg Manchurian.
5) One kung pao chicken
As a whole we had a great lunch over there . And both  quantity and quality of the food was good.  Only one factor which disappointed me was that the A.C. wasn't working properly. We're literally sweating while eating. The pocket pinch is also medium. Overall a perfect restaurant for a foodie like me to satisfy his/her tummy :)

Good hang out place for 2 to 4 persons for Saturday night near Desapriya Park. I love visiting this place because of good food, cozy ambience at pocket friendly cost. But now they have increased the price from puja which is unexpected.  It is expected that if the price remain same as earlier then we can again visit this place more often. AS THE PRESENT RATES ARE OVER PRICED.

Visited the place, this Durga Puja. Located in Deshapriya Park, near the State bank ATM.  Small place with cozy ambience , this place was in my bookmark list for a long time, finally got a chance to visit.well coming to the food part we ordered Crispy honey chicken as a starter followed by Chicken burnt ginger capsicum rice and hunan chicken. The Crispy honey chicken just made my day, one of the best starters(probably the best maybe) I have had till now, period. Rice item and hunan chicken was good too. Quantity was enough to feed two hungry souls. A very good experience, will surely visit again.

To make it short and simple, just close your eyes and choose anything out of the menu. Yes. ANYTHING and EVERYTHING in this restaurant's menu card is a treat to the palate. Just a larger carpet area would have gone given serious complex to 'sharks' of the catering industry. Great going and a long way to go.

As they invited me once to visit their outlet and try their signature dishes, I visited them this month..
I must say this time i was much satisfied with the food and service.. The following will be a detailed review covering key points :-

Space- It is a small outlet for dining holding hardly 10-15 person at a time..

Decor- Well! not much decorations here.. I found the rice bowls and serving plates quite fascinating though..

Service- Fast as lightning...! Haha.. no really I mean it.. I mean I thought they already knew what we will order.. They hardly took a minute to serve the main course when we asked as we finished the starter..

now coming to the most important point,

FOOD- Previous time, I got veg fried rice and overdose spl. chicken delivered to my home, which I found not good enough.. Their management invited me once to visit their outlet to try some signature dishes and I must say I am really surprised this time with the quality and quantity of the food at amazingly reasonable price including all taxes..
We ordered,

Crispy Honey Chicken- Sweet deep fried chicken with capsicum, onion and topped with sprinkled sesame seeds.. Pieces were big enough and came with a good quantity..

Burnt Ginger and Capsicum Rice (Chicken+Egg)- The combination of ginger and capsicum has always been good for our taste buds..

Manchurian Chicken- Juicy chicken pieces with garlic essence taste nice.. One plate serves 10 big pieces..

Thats all for now, foodies! Hope u enjoy these food and check out the restaurant cause all matters to them is food and service..

Chinese cuisine is one of the famous cuisine in all over the world. In every part of the world you will find Chinese restaurants. Kolkata is also full of Chinese restaurants, but there are very few restaurants which can live up to our expectation. Overdose is one of these restaurants, located near Desha Priya Park. The place is little bit small, can manage 10-12 people at a time, the ambiance is nice with decent décor. I and my fellow foodie friends visited the place for tasting event, and had some wonderful experiences. The preparation they served were very very delicious!! We started with,

•	SeaFood Lemon Coriander Soup – Very thick and loaded with lots of sea-foods like prawn, fish etc. and shredded chicken. Chopped coriander leaves and lemon juice added an extra flavour into it. Very delicious and healthy. A must try for all soup lovers.

•	Shangai Dimsums – Dimsum is a very famous Chinese preparation. The spicy chicken stuffing was very delicious. Served with a spicy chili dip. Very good in taste.

•	Suimais – It is another type of dimsum. Good in taste. It’s also served with the chili dip. 

•	Crispy Honey Chicken – Medium pieces of chicken fried deeply and tossed with bell pepper and chopped onions. Then mixed with gravy made with honey and topped with sesame seeds. It was very crispy , juicy and had a sweet spicy taste. Mouth watering. 

•	Lat me kai – Another mouth watering preparation. Chicken pieces were cooked into dry spicy gravy. Chicken were so crisp and juicy,  cooked wonderfully in chilli garlic sauces, it was rich in taste and flavour, had perfect amount of spice content.

•	Pan fried noodles – Pan fried noodles good in taste. Loaded with pieces of chicken and mushrooms along with onions and bell pepper and mixed with a thick gravy.

•	Panko Fish – Another must try fish preparation. Very good in taste and flavourful. Fish was soft and juicy and cooked perfectly. Very good in taste.

 

•	Devil’s Prawn – This one was amazing. Perfect dish for a prawn lover. Prawn dipped into batter and fried deeply and added into spicy gravy. The gravy was mixture of different types of sauces, spices. Bell pepper and chopped onions were also added with prawns. It was spicy yummy preparation.

Every preparation the served were absolutely delicious. 

The experience was very satisfying dining.  A highly recommended place for Chinese lovers. Service was fast and staffs are very attentive. Pocket pinch is very nominal. A special thanks to all the stuffs and the chef for this delicious experience. It was really an overdose of delicious Chinese foods. 
Happy eating everyone. Good Food Feel Good.

Chinese cuisine is one of my favorite among many other cuisines after the Bengali cuisine. basically, ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures are integrated into Chinese cuisines over time. Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. the most three traditional aspects used to describe Chinese food is color, smell and the taste as well as the meaning, appearance, and nutrition of the food. Chopsticks are the main eating utensils for Chinese food, which can be used to cut and pick up food. recently I went to a place which serves authentic dishes of Chinese and Asian cuisine known by “Overdose” located 23, Lake Terrace near Desapriya Park. a small and cozy place 10-12 seater beautifully decorated the place. the ambiance was quite good, the walls are perfectly customized. a small foodie meetup arranged by the management.
                                                                ...

I am overwhelmed by their behaviour...Will like to visit there again...And hope will not get disappoint for the 2nd time...

Food was decent
But the owner told us that the momos weren't available while a little while later a couple of girls entered who ordered the same and were given so happily. Dissapointed. 
Edit -
Gave this place another chance
Pan fried momos could have been a bit crisper and less soggy.
But the chicken was exquisite.
Recommended for the food, rather than the ambience or the hospitality.
Good enough.

A restaurant with a sitting capacity of 10 people!
Tried hard to not judge a restaurant by it's size and kept telling myself the food will be good.
Then came the ultimate blow.
The food :-
Noodles - Schezwan Noodles didn't have an iota of spiciness. It was basically roadside chowmein with mushroom and extra veggies.The Chilli Capsicum chowmein tasted better.
Side dish - Again, Schezwan Chicken failed to add spice to the meal!  The chilli chicken was way too average for such a price tag. 
And, DO NOT EVER order Hunan chicken here. It's basically tasteless boiled chicken in thickened chicken broth.
Ambience and service are good though!

This place didn't satisfied me much....The food was ok ok...The starters were good bt the main dishes disappointed me...The devil chicken was just taste less...The home made chicken curry is even better than that...May be it was a bad day...The place was small they should increase their sitting arrangements ... I am overwhelmed by their behaviour...Will like to visit there again...And hope will not get disappoint for the 2nd time...

we visited there during durga puja...i must say this place is a hidden treasure for chinese cuisine...we ordered lat me kai chicken for starter...mixed fried rice and devil's chicken for main course...we requested for the extra spice level in all dishes...and i must say they kept our request..foods were really hot and spicy..all dishes tasted pretty good...they charged pretty reasonable...i would suggest them to make the place a bit larger as getting a table was kinda hectic..

There is no shortage of restaurants serving Chinese cuisine but only few actually manage to create that charm and live up to our expectations.  Talking of one such places, Overdose, is quite a familiar name and very popular for its Chinese cuisines preparations. Undoubtedly one of the best places to have authentic Chinese and pleasing sea food at Desopriyo Park area with varieties of options to choose from and  satisfy the palate .Located at a very prime spot, 23, Lake Terrace, Sarath Bose Road, Desapriya Park, Kolkata . Interiors are done simple yet elegant with a seating capacity of 16-20 people in one go. The décor isn’t out of the world but decent enough for one to please their senses. Talking about the food here, it seems they maintained the authenticity of preparations, without much experimentation to impress and satisfy Indian palate.  I have been invited here with Team Panchphoron to attend their food menu launch . The menu start with

Overdose is located in Deshapriya Park near the State Bank ATM. This is a very small restaurant with 4 tables. I came across this eatery on zomato and thought of trying it. So, I went with a group of friends on Shoshti to have lunch. We ordered:
1.Crispy Honey Chicken -crispy and juicy chicken pieces served with veggies, they tasted really good. 
2. Crispy chili babycorn- I love crispy chili babycorn and hence I had to order this one.
3. Veg Hakka noodles , chili garlic noodles, veg fried rice- they are the usual Chinese dishes but tasted really good even in the rush hours of pujo. They did not compromise on their quality. They give good portions and one can be shared by 2-3 persons. 
4. Hunan chicken - minced chicken in white sauce gravy tasted perfect with the noodles and rice.
5. Kung Pao Chicken- a little sweet and spicy diced chicken, soft and juicy and complimented the rice really well.
This place is really pocket friendly and a great place to hang out with friends. The staff is good, ambience doesn't have anything new to it but the great food won't let you complain. A must visit.

Went yesterday with my team. Though it was an Astami night, we still get to manage seats for 5 of us, after waiting for 10 minutes. It's a small restaurant, so, going there with a big group will be little problem.
We ordered food like Mix noodles, Mix rice, Chili Chicken, Chicken Manchurian and Kung Pao Chicken.
Food were just awesome. Getting tasty food with a moderate price was more good.
Both the quantity and the quality was just outstanding. Price was just okay with both the quality and quantity.
Chicken were 8 pieces in a plate. Even though the pieces were small, but the taste was very good.
The service as well as the behaviour of the people there are also very good.
They took around 10 mins to serve food. And as we were looking very hungry and tired, they apologized to us to serving food to us 10 mins late. We were very happy to see the behaviour.
Food also included the tax and it will fetch around 170 for a plate.

Food for 2: Rs 500

Food: 4.3/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service: 4.1/5
Value of money: 4.3/5

But somehow I just love to give a 5 star to the food quality and quantity..We ordered Chicken Lat Me Kai which was too tasty..Chicken Hakka noodles-"overdose" for two people if you order one.. And hunan chicken which was less spicy but quite tasty.. Service was a bit late.. Would love to visit after the Pujo season..

Had veg food. Food quality and quantity both are upto the expectations. Price is reasonable. Just there is little space crunch and interior could be more decorative and a good hospitality needed from the stuffs. Then it will be 5 star for sure.
Location: Near charuchandra college lake market. Or opposite to Monalisa lodge road near desopriya park.

Didn't like it. Went during pujo. Ordered some chicken and prawns. Shrimps were not available. They served he soup first but didn't serve the the mocktail. Didn't bother ongoing that's prawns are not available... So after eating half of the chicken starter we were told that prawns Re not available. Bad service. Didn't find the food to be wow too. Their unapologetic response is visible in the comments section

Yesterday I went there for the first time. This place is  small but the ambience is nice. We ordered Soup , Chicken Fried momo , Chicken Fried Rice & Hot Garlic Chicken. The soup was really tasty and the momo gave immense satisfaction to my taste buds. But I didn't like the fried rice , it was not up to the mark . The Hot Garlic Chicken was good. The quantity they provide is enough for two. Pocket friendly restaurant.   Overall a good experience. Will surely visit it again.

Small eating house located in the alleys of Sarat Bose  Road. Place is good for small groups of 2/3 persons since the area is quite small. 

Food:Chinese fare  is quite okay to good. However we felt that the usher should guide customers properly to place the orders as per their requirements and not force down any single dish. Value for money is good which I believe is the USP of the place also the prices are GST inclusive which feels good.

The plates were clean and were promptly changed after every course which is impressive.

Areas of improvement: we felt the steel chairs are not at all comfy but it's not a deal breaker. However the air conditioner kept us sweating, this is one great concern especially when you are not directly seating in front of it. 

Will visit again after some time. Cheers !

Visited the place this afternoon. Not so spacious but the decor is good and has a cozy ambiance. Kept order minimal. Ordered Panko fish for starter and Kung Pao chicken with chicken rice for main course. Loved the fish. Absolutely worth the price. But the chicken and rice were bit too salty . When told the person who was serving, he immediately replaced the dishes with another plate of rice and Kung Pao chicken freshly cooked with correct amount of salt. Very happy with the service. Just the quality of rice could be improved.
PS- there's no GST on billing. Pocket friendly .

For last few years Deshapriya Park area is getting crowded during Puja Days. And I’m sure no one loves to stay hungry. So in case if you feel hungry here is the place where you can go and fill your empty stomach.

We, the Team panch Phoron are extremely busy with our Puja schedule. So we were invited to taste the Puja Menu of this place too.

Me, along with my others foodie friends of Team Panch Phoron went to this place and we tasted some super tasty food.

Though they have a very small sitting arrangement, but there is an option of TAKE AWAY all the time.

Now I should tell you what did we taste - 

•	Shangai Dimsums - Dim sum is usually linked with the older tradition from ..But the unique culinary art dim sum originated with the Cantonese in southern China, who over the centuries transformed yum cha from a relaxing respite to a loud and happy dining experience. However, in modern society, it has become commonplace for restaurants to serve dim sum at dinner time; various dim sum items are even sold as take-out for students and office workers on the go. Thus we were offered SHANGHAI DIMSUMS with the super exotic sauce that was basically made of garlic oil and spring onion.

•	Suimais – Sui Mai is another origin of dumpling and Dim Sums. Sui Mai means the product was "sold as a sideline". The product was initially in the form of meat and vegetables wrapped in thin sheets, and was sold weighing only the wrapper, a tradition which is still kept in Huhhot. And trust me the moment it was given to us, the plate became empty within a few seconds. So you can understand how it was tasted.

•	Crispy Honey Chicken – This is one dish that I personally like very much. This dish is basically fried chicken pieces tossed in honey sauce and served with sesame.

•	Lat me kai – Lat Me Kai, means deep fried bones chicken tossed in oyster and garlic sauce and Capsicum; served with sprinkled spring onion.

•	Pan fried noodles – Pan fried Noodles is basically a preparation where  you have to shallow fry the noodles and then it has to be served with chicken with the sauce or vegetables with the sauce. Here we were served with Chicken  with the garlic sauce.

•	Chicken with Pakchoi – Pak Choi is basically Chinese Cabbage also known as Bok Choi. This dish was a dish where small pieces of chicken were cooked with Bell Peppers and Pak Choi in Black Soya Sauce with burnt garlic and onion. Trust me, it was superb.

•	Panko Fish – Panko is basically breadcrumbs with a light, flaky texture, typically used as a coating for fried or baked food. So here fishes were coated with breadcrumbs and fried. And after frying those were tossed with chef’s special sauce and served with sprinkled sesame. 

•	Devil's Prawn – We all have had Devil’s Crab, but this time I’ll tell you about Devil’s Prawn. But please do not go by the name or try to compare it with Devil’s Crab. Because, usually Devil’s Crab is a recipe where you’ll find lot of cheese, but here this was an in and out without cheese recipe where Prawns were cooked with normal barbecue sause, Capsicum, garlic and served with spring onion. Though it didn’t meet the expectation with the name, but with its taste it has won the match.

So now do not wait for anything.. This puja, just visit this place and indulge in some super yummie food.

Thank you OVER DOSE for inviting Team panch Phoron  and thank you

Going by all the reviews, I paid a visit to them for a takeaway. I ordered 2 chicken fried rice, 2 chicken hakka  chowmien, 4 garlic chicken. And requested not to put any chilli or chilli sauce. After reaching home and sitting with family for dinner, I found to my horror that the Garlic chicken had extra chilli added to it. Cant imagine why on earth would they add chilli to plain Garlic chicken. And despite requesting not to put any chilli in any dish. Even the fried rice and chowmien had very little chicken pieces.
It was unfortunately my first and my last experience there !!

Going by its name, this place actually serves you an overdose of Chinese tastes and flavours.😍😍 Located in one of the lanes near Deshpriya park, Overdose is a small Chinese restraunt with 5-6 tables. The restraunt decor was themed of black.. most probabably depicting of 'devil' -- Sumptuous devilish dishes, pleasing your belly wholly!!😝😝 The walls here are given a brick texture with green creepers all around enhancing its beauty further more.😍

Coming to the most important part of a restraunt--its FOOD-- the platters were a complete explosion of Chinese flavours with perfect balance of garlic, seasonings and other sauces!! We ordered-- chicken steam momo, pan fried chicken momo, garlic fried chicken and overdose special chicken gravy. Each of these dishes had there distinct tastes that will cheer you up instantly.😍 It was only that the amount of ginger was a little more in the food, which for us was a minor drawback!!😝😝
The quantity was quite huge and so a plate of any dish was appropriate for two.🤓
Talking about the prices-- it is absolutely pocket friendly even after the application of GST, and the best part is that the bill is what you calculate going by the price lists of the menu card without any addition of extra taxes in the net amount!!😍😍

The staffs were quite friendly...it was only that they could have smiled a little more!!🤓🤓

When we went there most probably work was in progress for the enlargement of the accomodating area of the restraunt and hopefully it shall get conpleted before the Durga pujas!!😍😍 So if you are finding a pocket friendly Chinese restraunt with delicious tastes and belly-filling quantity, do visit OVERDOSE and get overdosed with varieties of lip-snacking grubs!!😍😍

Its been on my wishlist fr a long tym..atlast got to visit today with a friend of mine. Its a very small restaurant nd the ambience was simple yet cozy. The service was quite fast which pleased us since we were really hungry by the tym we reached there. We ordered lat me kai as starter which was tasty nd recommended to us. Next we had veg fried rice with the overdose special chicken..the rice was good in quality..nd quantity is enough fr two along with starter. I am personally a huge fan of Chinese fare hence I am a bit critical about it..however the main course chicken was surely delicious. Its like chilli chicken with a twist. Lastly we ended our meal with 2glasses of masala colddrinks. It was OK. Though they should surely add some dessert atleast or even a few mocktails to their menu..the last course is surely very imp as it adds a magical touch to the whole dining experience. Anyway recommended fr tasty Chinese food within a shoestring budget coz this place doesn't levy any tax..atleast as of now!!..Hoping to mk another visit soon.😊

Located near deshapriya park. We went there for a friend's birthday treat. The restaurant is small but cozy. The stuffs were very polite and well mannered. Now coming to the food. We ordered lat Mai Mai as a starter. Which was of a heavenly taste. After that mixed fried rice and devils chicken were ordered. Both of them had very good quality as well as quantity. The best thing was they gave us a complimentary dish of momo because of the Birthday girl, Which was absolutely unexpected from us. It's a very pocket friendly restaurant, which doesn't take any Extra charge or GST n food. One of the best Chinese restaurants in southern avenue .

Time:7.30-9.30 pm

Intro: Well it took a bit of longer time on my part to review this restaurant. 
It was a Saturday night, the missus was feeling lazy to go outside for eating, so we ordered a takeaway via Zomato and it was a mistake.
The restaurant is located in deshapriya park and our residence is nearby rashbehari Avenue.
The time as mentioned above might look funny! However that is the exact time it took for them to deliver us our order. 
They took 2 hours to deliver the order at the location which is merely  20mins away. Also the stipulated time for delivery as mentioned in Zomato was 50 mins!!

Location: as mentioned above its just located near deshapriya park. May be will visit it sometime later.

Our order: we ordered a Shanghai dimsum (non veg), panko fish as starters , chicken burnt Ginger capsicum rice in mains and devil's chicken on side.

The dimsum (6 PC's) looked just like a shorter concentrated version of momo. It was stuffed fully with chicken n veggies, soft, succulent, not oily unlike its momo counterpart n served with a yummy herbal chutney. 

Following it was the seductive looking panko fish. 6 decent fillets of fish thinly coated , fried, garnished with spices and served with lots of usual veggies tasted wonderful. It had a tangy n spicy taste to it.

The burnt Ginger capsicum chicken fried rice had a nice gingerish taste to it n served with slices of capsicum and generous amount of chicken ; went well with the side. The amount is okay for two people.

The devil's chicken is a shredded chicken dish. The taste, color, smell and feel of the dish is almost same as the panko fish. So that was a downer on our part. However it's hotness made up for it.

Price: 500-600 bux for two people .

Conclusion: the food is good; run of the mill indo Chinese , however the difference is they have better flavour than the rest among its category. Also for the price they take, the food they serve, is peach. However they do have to pull up their socks in the delivery department.

Overdose is a small pocket friendly Chinese restaurant....It is situated in the Sarat Bose road...a little difficult to locate because the restaurant is not that big...but thanks to Google maps. 
We ordered Crispy honey chicken and Sumai dimsums for starters and mixed fried rice and devil's chicken for the main course... The quantity was enough for two.. with a total bill of just 560/- only
Totally overwhelmed by the taste ...and the ambience and services both were good as well.
It is a must visit for the Chinese lovers who want to eat a lot without a whole in their pockets.
Looking forward to the next visit.

Located at Sarat Bose road , this restaurant is not spacious as such, but the decor is captivating.The place is hard to locate , but the irksome search was worth the pain . The restaurant staff is polite and efficient. 

As regards the food , we were highly appealed by the presentation as well as the taste.We ordered fresh lime soda , crispy honey chicken , chicken pan-fried noodles and chicken dumplings.Each of the items was lip-smacking .Overall, the meal was scrumptious and the price is affordable . 

Looking forward to another visit !

Excessively overwhelmed and exhilarated after visiting the place. OVERDOSE as the name suggests will  make you visit their place over and over again and will intend you to feast on the Chinese varieties over and over and over again until you get overdosed 😁😁Nevertheless ,even after that, you can never cease coming to this place to satisfy your hunger.Today we checked in here after hours of tedious navigation. A small joint with a peaceful ambience and a pretty decor. Now coming to the food, we ordered for crispy honey chicken, Shanghai dimsum and  chicken pan fried noodles which was cooked to perfection. And ended up sipping the  lime soda. What is remarkable about this joint is the perfect quantity of the food they serve and the quality they maintain. Worth a visit. Highly impressing.

I have never been to this place but have ordered food once from here, randomly, and I can never thank myself enough for taking such a random decision 😂. Jokes apart, the food is delicious and the service is no less. On one occasion I even received a call from the owner of Overdose himself, and he was extremely polite and humble. Hoping to visit the restaurant someday soon 😀.

Momos and starters are lovely! The place is not much in size but the comfort one experiences is great! Food is available at an inexpensive rate but that does not compromise with its quality.

Visited this resturant with Kashmira Das. The resturant is near Desapriya Park. From Rashbehari Avenue and Sarat Bose Road crossing move towards Lake Kalibari, in the 3rd right lane you can find Overdose. This is a very small resturant, it can accommodate only 15-16 people at a time. A very good ambience you can find. The serving men are very polite and helpful.

Now coming to the food. We have ordered Lung Fung Soup,  one Crispy Honey Chicken, one Burnt Ginger Capsicum Rice, one Pan Fried Noodles and one Hunan Chicken. The quality and quantity of food is very good according to their price. Only we didn't like the Crispy Honey Chicken. They are too crispy and sweet to enjoy the actual taste. Otherwise all other foods were excellent. 
Overall this food joint is a good Chinese option in Kolkata for Chinese lovers. Go and have a visit.

P.S: They serve very very slow. So you need to have enough patience to enjoy the quality food. Enjoy. Happy fooding. ❤

This particular restaurant was in my hit list to visit and I was so excited about it because of its high rating and wonderful reviews and somewhat interesting menu. But unfortunately, it was a total time as well as money waste for me. We ordered chicken shanghai dimsum and chicken american chopsuey. First of all, it took them almost 40 minutes to serve the food. When it came, it looked good but least we knew it would be a complete disaster in terms of taste.
American Chopsuey: I hated the taste of pineapple in it. In this case I think it is my issue that I didn't like that particular gravy (not a fan of fruits in any starter or main dish). However I would like to add that the pineapple pieces failed to compliment the dish and the gravy was really an overdose of sweet,sour sauces. I would say they didn't blend it quite well. Next, what disappointed me the most that I had to see the menu again and only after billing I was confirmed that I ordered Chicken chopsuey, which I knew I ordered obviously, but the lack of chicken pieces in the chopsuey compelled me to doubt it.
Dimsum : it was a total rubbish dish. It has no taste, not even the taste of salt. A kind of raw smell of dimsum with that liquid dip was a complete failure. We ate only two dimsums and couldn't really eat any further...
Overall, a total OVERDOSE of disappointment...

The place is a student friendly place.  The food is the star of this place. The hot garlic Noodles and garlic chicken is a must try. The quantity is in a fair amount and pleases your taste buds and pockets as well.  The staff is prompt in their service and would give you no chance to complain.

Wanted to try out something new, so went here...the ambience was pretty good and nicely decorated not that spacious but enough to treat your Gang of 9. Reasonable price good quantity, although they dont have a lot in the menu, but they certainly have some quality menus! We had Dimsums, honey crispy chicken and schewan fried rice which were 5/5 for me! Overall a good place for casual hangouts! 
P.S- we were entitled to 20% off on our bill as an offer for their first anniversary!

After having this place on my list for a long time , yesterday I visited this place with my friends. When we went there they had a puja going on as it was their 1year anniversary. We were given prasad which was a very kind gesture of them. They were really very polite and we loved their warm attitude. Now coming to the food! Yesterday they offered a discount of 20% on the occasion of their anniversary which was a very pleasant surprise. We ordered
1: panko fish - it was recommended by the guy who took the orders. We loved it! It was a 4/5. The quality of the fish was good and we loved the taste
2: Chicken suimai dumplings- tried this for the first time. It was a bit bland to my taste buds! But some of my friends liked it so I can't really say that it was cooked bad or something. For me it is 2.5/5
3: Mixed Fried rice- one plate is enough for two people and was loaded with chicken and prawns. It was not oily. The quality of the rice was decent too. 3.5/5
4: overdose special fish- loved the fish! The batter could've been thinner thought. 4/5
5: hot garlic chicken- it tasted good and the chicken was moist. 4/5 again

The bill was around Rs.830 which is a fairly cheap price we paid for so much of food.
They have very courteous staff and we were inquired about the quality of the food items frequently, which was a nice gesture on their part.
Would definitely love to visit again :)

The food quality was bang on! Would've loved it to be a bit hotter but I guess it got cold by the time the guy reached our place crossing the puja jam. The quantity for the price paid is amazing and they serve quality food. Would definitely order again!

We had crispy honey chicken , dragon chicken and chicken hakka noodles
Crispy honey chicken is their special dish ❤️ , definitely it tastes different from other restaurants .
It is sweet as well as spicy too 😈

Dragon chicken was too spicy ! And hakka noodles was also good ❤️🤘

Quantity and quality both are up to the mark , each dish is enough for two ✌️

Specially the staffs and manager , they are all so polite and well behaved ❤️

Tomorrow means 7 th September is their anniversary, they provide flat 20% on everything on that day ✌️❤️

Went to this place with my best friend. 
Order dumplings, hunan chicken and mixed fried rice. 
Also a sweet lime soda which was not at all good. 
Dumplings were really yummy and I tried hunan chicken for the first Tym.. So no idea about its taste.. 
It was average for me.

Located near Rashbehari Avenue (Deshapriya park), the place doesn't have too much space, but it has very normal and pleasant ambiance. We ordered the followings:
1 . Mix Rice noodles (can easily be shared by 2 people) 
2. Panko fish gravy (suggested by them) 
3. Mix vegetable chicken
4. Fresh lime soda
The food was delicious, Panko fish is actually belong to the starters but they suggested me to have it as a side dish and they made it with gravy as I wanted, servicing was very nice. Pocket friendly. I would definitely like to visit here again.

This restaurant deserves a full rating because of its food,pricing,location and service.It is located near deshapriya park crossing.Its just 5 mins walk from the crossing.

It was recommended to me by one of my friend and we decided to visit the place.We were 6 in number and had a proper full course dinner and the bill was just around 1200/-.The food was mouth watering and quantity was more than enough.Since then I am a big big fan of OVERDOSE.The USP of this food joint is its authentic chinese taste and their consistency.My all time favourite dishes are their momos,sanghai dimsums,chicken lat-me-kai,dry chilli chicken ,garlic fried chicken ,hunan chicken,overdose special fish and pan fried noodles.
Keeping in mind the quality and quantity of the food,I consider OVERDOSE as a very pocket friendly restaurant.
I keep going to the restaurant very frequently and trust me it never failed to impress my taste buds.
This food joint is a must visit for all and am pretty sure you'll all get 'OVERDOSED' by their scrumptious foods.

Overdose Is a Special Place for me, I have not visited it personally but have had their Food Delivered Via 3rd Party Delivery Apps a Lot. I really love Chinese Food and this is One of the Best Restaurants near me. There are many choices between Gariahat & Deshopriyo Park but its my Favorite amongst them all. 

My Recommendations
Starters - Black Pepper Chicken & Dry Chili Chicken
Main Course - Chili Chicken & Schezwan Chicken (Bit On The Spicy Side)Noodles/Rice - Chili Garlic Noodles & Schezwan Fried Rice
Pros
Packaging - Exceptional For the Price Range
Quality - Very Healthy & Hygienic 
PresentationPrice - Well Within Budget (Approx 450 For 2)
Delivery - Fast (Within 30 Mins)

ConsNone So Far, Keep Up The Good Work!Cheers!

A small neatly maintained & well decorated ac restaurant near deshapriya park. A must visit for crazy chinese lovers. Been there with my bestie to celebrate her birthday. The outlet was not that spacious but after having their food we were just "overdosed". We took "Crispy Honey Chicken" as starter & it was the best among the dishes that we had on that day. Fusion of sweet & spicy hot flavour was at its best level. Next we had Suimai dimsum which is not a typical momo/dimsum. But the taste!! Awfully awsome.
Next we had the main course in which first we took "Burnt Ginger Capsicum Rice" along with "Hunan Chicken". Both the dishes was outstanding. The rice has its own smoky & ginger rich flavour & it was loaded with diced & smoked capsicum. The Hunan Chicken was on a lighter taste. It was lightly flavoured chicken preparation which I liked very much. Next we had "Pan fried noodles". It was also very good. Loaded with chicken strips & mushrooms it tastes heavenly. Overall pocket pinch was moderate. The whole package along with 2 glass of fresh lime soda cost us around 800. & it was really awsome that they dont charge any extra tax on total. Overall for an "OVERDOSED" experience, it's a must try. Looking forward to visit again💝💝

Tastes like street food. I really don't get how so many people rated this place so high. The seating chairs were dirtier than the street. People were smoking weeds inside. The food was an oily, raw mess. And the price they are asking for the kind of food they are serving is ridiculous. Are people high? This is such a bad restaurant. Even though the owner was humble and behaved courteously, he couldn't save his sinking ship. We ordered Pan Fried Momos, Schezwan noodles, Chilli garlic Chicken and Honey Chilli Chicken. The momos were tasty but I have had better momos at Wow Momo! Next, the quality of the noodles were comparable to any street side food stall. The veggies were not so fresh. The quality of the chicken was bad. We bit into raw ginger. And in the end my stomach started hurting. Overall a terrible experience.

Being a Chinese lover i must say this place is pretty good for any Chinese lover. We ordered four different dishs and the best part is every single dish tastes different than rest of three.. we ordered honey chilli chicken devil's chicken overdose special chicken and hunan chicken. We also  ordered chicken garlic chowmin which is also good.. overall very much satisfactory.. 
But one thing which i didn't like that the place is too small.. just started and end by 2 steps.. 
Otherwise a good place for hangout..

It's possibly the best Chinese restaurant for a low budget.
Their food is delicious.
Last time I tried
the Shanghai dimsum: Mildly flavoured n crispy.
Momo (non veg): tastes good especially the sauce served.
Lat me Kai. It's one of the best starters served here.
Nearbuy has some attractive vouchers to avail.
It's a go to Chinese place.

The crispy honey chicken is crispier than it is anywhere else I've been too, and that's so great!
I also liked their Lat mein Kai, but Hatari makes it better. Everything a bit on the spicy side, so, maybe my rating is a little low due to that 
I recommend:

My parents were racking up Zomato discount vouchers from Coke bottles so decided to order in from this place. 

We ordered the clear vegetable noodle soup and the crispy babycorn starter. The quantity of the babycorn was decent - enough for 3-4 folks. The soup was on the bland side however - and the quantity was more for 1.5 people. The quantity of noodles was a bit low too.

I am willing to order in again and try more of their dishes, but none of them really stand out as something that really needs to be tried.

Location :  it is very good , located near the Deshopriyo Park signal, not so difficult to locate, and the area is known for its adjacent offices too, another advantage. 
Ambience : It is a small place, with classy set up. You wouldn't get that congested feel despite the area being small. 
Service : Quite promt and courteous. 
Food : I tried two of their signature dishes - Overdose special Chilli Chicken and Siu Mai. Chilli chicken I just loved it, as it had authentic Chinese flavours, which is  quite hard to find these dats. Siu Mai is a classic Chinese dish which is more like dumplings with a special oil based dip. I tried it first time there, and was quite impressed. 
Cost : Going by the taste, expected it to be pricey, but cost was quite reasonable.
Overall quite a good experience, would like to revisit, must recommended to all Chinese food lovers ready to chill out in a cool ambience !!

Located near Deshapriya Park. The place is very small. It hardly has 10-12 chairs and 3 small tables. But the food is very delicious. We ordered the following dishes-
1. Chilly Garlic Chicken (Starter)- it comes in 8 pieces of chicken. Taste is great.
2. Chilly Garlic Chicken Chowmein- Quantity, Quality & Taste- awesome in every aspect. It is sufficient for 2 people if ordered with a side dish.
3. Hunan Chicken- it comes in shredded chicken pieces in white sauce along with some green veggies. 
4. Overdize Special Chicken- total 8 chicken pieces will be there. It tastes a little sour, a little hot with red sauce. Try for it.
5. Honey Chilly Chicken- total 8 pieces of chicken cooked in red sauce. It tastes fabulous. A totally new taste will be in your tongue. Do have a try.
6. Devil's Chicken- shredded pieces in red sauce. Its high spicy & hot in taste. 
The best thing I noticed is that each & every chicken dishes we ordered have its own unique taste. And the price is much reasonable.

Few months back we went to this place, its a tiny food joint! So we had to wait a lil, as it was full..after 10-15mins they called us in.
Nothing special about the ambience, the walls had a rough brick finish, but the USP of this place is its food.
We ordered Pan fried Momo (non-veg) and Lat Mein Kai in starters, and Chili Garlic mixed Hakka noodles and Chilli fish in main course.
Momo was fine, but lat mein kai was one heck of a dish, spicy tangy succulent pieces of chicken totally tasty!
Noodles was tasty again and I completely loved chilli fish.
Portions were more than OK for the two of us.
Service was fast as well.
Nothing to complain about.
Great Chinese food in an area like Deshapriya park within such economic prices.
Way to go OVERDOSE.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 👑

The Best Chinese Food you'll have in this price range in the city of Kolkata. Small Joint but worth the visit if you want to have a crazy Chinese fiasco. Chilli chicken,chilli fish,mix fried rice and dimsums are recommended.

This is probably the first time I'm rating a restaurant only 1 out of five. Today was the first time I came to know about this food joint and today itself I ordered the food(through a different app for home delivery). The general reviews and ratings were good in here, so I decided to go with it. So here's the list of the things that I ordered:
1. Chicken Shumai Dimsum(not good)
2. Chicken Momo(was average)
3. Crispy Honey Chicken(not good)
4. Fish Pepper and Salt(the fish didn't had any taste)
5. Hunan Chicken(was very average)
6. Hot Garlic Fish(was ok)
7. Chicken Fried Rice(worst of all I've ever tasted)
8. Chicken Pan Fried Noodles(why the gravy?? I didn't ordered gravy noodles)
9. Chicken Hakka Noodles(a sure waste of money because roadside stuffs taste better)

I would never recommend this place to anybody. It was a special day today so we decided to go with it, instead of ordering from Hatari. 4 out of 5 in zomato is a decent rating, if the food isn't that good I'm not sure how they made it this far. The only pro I can see in here is the pricing.

We visited many Chinese restaurant in Calcutta.Because we are Chinese foodies. I was searching on Zomato for a cheap & good Chinese restaurant.I saw many name but finally I choose Overdose which is very nearly to Lake Mall.The First word is coming to my mind about Overdose after testing the food is 'FANTASTIC'.Although the place is little bit small but it is comfortable.The food are moderately cheap & taste also like a pro.The Staffs & Manager behaviour are so gentle.Even they are remember us when we are visiting second time on their restaurant.Overall the Food Quality & Staff Behaviours is Miraculous.Such a nice joint with a budget.Hope u come to Overdose soon.

Place is tiny (with 3 tables only) but the food is great!
Ordered: Lat Me Kai, Crispy Honey Chicken for starters and both were delicious.

For the main course, we had Garlic and Capsicum Rice and Chicken Fried Rice with Hong Kong Chicken. All of them were very filling and really catered to our taste buds. 
The quantity is very good, especially for the price. 

5 items and guess the pocket pinch?! ₹ 725/- ! 

Shall come back soon!

This is my first review about Overdose though I had their food at Rs 99/-  from nearbuy more than 10 times earlier.I can bet no such Chinese restaurants offer such a tasty food both in quality and quantity at such a cheap price.Yeah the restaurant is small but the coordiality of the staffs and the taste of food are just amazing.The owner Mr Rajdeep Seth is a nice gentleman with a friendly behaviour.He suggested to have their signature dishes one day.So I went there yeaterday with my friend.We ordered their favourite Lat me kai as starter,it was crispy and tasted nice.We also ordered Mixed Schezuan fried rice and overdose special chicken.The quantity was enough for two people and taste was really nice.They served quite fast after taking the orders.They do not charge any extra tax on the bill amount.Overall the experience was very pleasant.I will surely visit once more to try their other signature dishes.

This is a small food joint near desapriya park crossing. 8-10 seats available. I and my friend went there for lunch. Ordered chicken fried rice, chilly garlic hakka noodles and kung pao chicken which was suggested by them. Every item was delicious. The noodle was spicy. The portion of rice and noodles was more than enough for one person. Ordered steamed chicken momo, noodles, fried rice, chilly chicken and hot garlic chicken. The momo was too oily. But the other dishes were very tasty. The service was really good. I loved this restaurant.

A relatively small joint more of a takeaway ...Overdose is located in a lane just a few blocks way opposite Xrong place.Me and my girls were looking for sampling a new menu to our taste buds and Overdose was the perfect overdose for that. For the evening we decided to taste starters only with a glass of sweet lime soda.The place is tiny and can barely fit in 3 tables but the food is to die for explaining the popularity.Our orders for the evening:

1.Suimai dimsum
2.Shanghai dimsum
3.Chicken momo
4.chicken dumpling
5.dry chilli chicken
6.crispy honey chicken.

The dimsums are recommended-- It is a sensation for the taste buds.I have had better momos before so it was ok.Next came the dry chilli chicken which was spicy and quite well prepared.The crispy honey chicken was a recommendation from our sever.At first we were sceptic but when the dish arrived , taking a bite in to the sesame coated sweet chicken piece we decided that we can have one more of it. 

I plan to go again this time giving a shot at their main course and overdose myself with spicy sauces.Team overdose kudos to your effort

A small restaurant. Mainly for home delivery and take away, they have sitting space for about 10 people. But whatever space they have, it's neat and clean. We ordered chicken steamed momo, chicken dumpling, burnt garlic fried rice, szechuan chicken rice, exotic veg in white garlic sauce and honey chili chicken. All the dishes were tasty, but the exotic veg stood out. Loaded with mushroom, zucchini, bok choy, broccoli and peppers, it was light and very tasty. Perhaps the least tasty dish was the dimsums, but they were served with a yummy sauce. The cost was amazingly low for the portions they served. Definitely going to visit again.

Definitely one of the hidden gems in Kolkata. Located just beside tea trove this place is just what a pure chinese food lover needs. Just dropped by in the evening to have plate of momo and tried their chicken as well as the pan fried chicken momo and i was completely mesmerized. It was so delicious and yummy. Though the size of the restaurant is small but the behaviour of the staffs and the quality of the food will take you to this place everytime you crave for some real chinese food.

A new eatery in South Kolkata which seems to have made quite a name for itself and why not??... They dished out some spectacular chinese food and frankly speaking we weren't expecting it to be this good. We ordered Hong-Kong Chicken, Chilli Chicken,   Chicken Lollipop,  Chicken Hakka Chowmein and Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles. The items were neatly packaged and tasted delightfully good. Quantity is decent and the overall prices of the dish do not burn a hole in your pocket. Plan to be in person soon to experience the ambience and their service.

Also a small joint its easy to locate. The place is small and can accommodate 10 at a time. It's better to make prior appointment here.

The decor is nice and so was the behavior of the staffs over here.

Coming to food. We got a little coupon for which we had chicken clear Noodle soup. Quantity was okayish but tasted well and good.
Next was fried chicken which was a tangy and spicy preparation. Then was a fried rice and garlic chicken. The quantity was really worth noticing for all. And taste was nice enough to have a second visit.

Overdose had been in my bucket list for a long time and finally i had the oppurtunity to taste their dishes. It was a home-delivery service via swiggy so i wont be able to give a proper comment on the ambiance  and structure of the restaurant. So directly coming towards the food, i ordered chicken fried rice and chili chicken via swiggy for lunch. The fried rice was yummm in taste- the balance was good and it was a subtle taste. Coming to the chili chicken i was absolutely bowled away by its taste. The chili chicken was delicious and spicy and the chicken pieces were juicy. I loved the dishes which was prepared by them. Hope to visit this place again to try their other dishes also.

A very very tiny restaurant. Seating arrangement will allow only 8 people to dine.
Ambience- not very decorative,kind of shabby. The chairs are not very clean and some of them are disoriented. Tables placed just next to kitchen from where u can hear chefs chatting and cooking.
Quantity - less according to the price. 1 plate of noodles will just be ok for one person.
Quality- well this is the only point which will fetch rating for this food joint. Tried crispy honey chicken,dumpling, veg noodles and kung Pao chicken. The food tastes good.
Service- very unprofessional. Slow. The waiter brought us veg Manchurian instead kung Pao chicken . Later he changed the item on telling him the mistake. Everytime we had to ask for refilling our glasses with drinking water.

Only plus point is it is pocket friendly for students.

We discovered this place after checking little app coupons. It's beside the tea trove and is basically a very small restaurant with a capacity of allowing 8 people to sit and dine. The waiter was decent but however forgot to serve water due to the late hour maybe, the place was okayish. The food that they served, the rating is totally for that. We ordered clear chicken noodle soup which was light n tasty. Then we  placed the order for pepper chilly chicken, garlic chicken and schezuan fried rice. All of them tasted really awesome, and the quantity and quality both impressed us. Would love to visit again :)

Another newly opened small eatery of south.
Located near Lake Mall,this one also has a very cozy decor with the kitchen very near to the sitting area which sometimes might cause you trouble.
I assume the young owner himself was taking our orders in a perfect hospitable manner which was really something very pleasant for the customers.
We had Suimai Dimsums as the starter which was absolutely amazing though i didn't like the sauce much.
Then we took a Hakka Noodles with Overdose Special Chicken and both of them satisfied my appetite.
The quantity as well as the quality serve justice to your cost.
Definitely recommending this pocket friendly place to others.

A tiny eating place located beside tea trove,deshapriyo park. It can accomodate a maximum of  10 people at a time. The serving size does not justify it's name rather its pretty 'underdose' according to the price. 
Taste of all the items ordered were  average. The Tom-yum was bit too sour, lat-me-kai chicken was good, thin slices of over fried chicken were served in honey crispy chicken, there were very little chicken strips found in singapore CHICKEN noodle.
✓One good point is all the prices are inclusive of all taxes and do not add up to the expected bill.

This is a hidden gem of South kolkata..Not a big and stylish place but a cozy place with simple decor.

Now lets come to the main point.. One of the best pocket friendly Chinese restaurant I've ever went through.. Tried Pan fried chicken momo, which was too much yummy with the perfect crisp, after that tried lat-me-kai which was perfectly cooked too much soft and tasty and lastly Chicken chili garlic noodles , trust me it was wow! And the best thing about over dose is ' quantity '. Chili garlic noodle was loaded with chicken and egg bhujia. And after having all these it costed me only 395 Rs .. I'm in love with this place, I would like to visit the place  soon and would recommend my friends too.. thanks overdose for the great experience <3 a big thumbs up for all the friendly staffs and owner :)Tag

This place is awfully bad. Disgusting ambience, too cozy, staffs were not attentive enough. And the worst part is the food. Oh my god !! Terrible.. we ordered burnt ginger capsicum rice , overdose special chicken and sweet lime soda.. the rice were badly cooked and had no taste of ginger in it, rather it was a plain mixed rice with lots of capsicum. The overdose chicken was overdose of hotness,lacks taste. And the sweet lime soda, to talk less about it is better.

Overall experience : total mess !

Above everything, if you are planning to visit this place seeing in zomato then please lemme tell you, this place doesn't look like the way it shows here. Its inside decor is shabby and the space is too tiny. I think its best if you plan for take away.
We arrived there at around 10.15 at night and trust me we were very disappointed to see the place like that. So leaving everything behind we ordered our food. We ordered Shanghai dimsum, but since they didn't have dimsum ready we had chicken pan fried momo as suggested by them. It was too much spicy but yeah the taste was good. Then we ordered mixed hakka noodles and overdize special chicken. The chicken dish was suggested by them, as according to them this dish was one of their special recipes. Now both the noodles and the chicken dish were not at all well made. It was too salty and too much spicy even after we warned that we want less spicy food.
Coming to the price, its a pocket friendly restaurant. But sadly enough our experience here was not good as per its zomato review and rating.

The food is really very good. We went over there for a Team Lunch. Ordered Veg Fried Rice and Hot Garlic Chicken. I must say this is the best Chinese Cuisine outlet near Southern Avenue. Thank You Overdose for your awesome hospitality. Good Job.

Been to this place a couple of months back. We had Suimai Dimsum, Overdose Special Chicken, Burnt Ginger Capsicum rice and Mixed Pan fried Noodles. This was the first time I ever had Dimsum and the order which we gave was Suimai Dimsum. Honestly, I would never have dimsums in my life again if this was the real dimsum taste. So I would not be able to compare or comment on a food which I have never tried. Mixed Pan Fried Noodle lacked taste which we call it as "Paansha" in Bengali, Rice was average and the Chicken was good. Nothing great about this place except its pocket friendly.

This restaurant deserves a full 5 because of it's apt price, friendly service, location, food and everything else! We went there 3-4 times and just believe me! The food, service and the courtesy of the people there were excellent! Though on a saraswati puja we didn't get place iinside so we had to eat outside but still the food was divine! Highly recommend for those who have a great apetite but a low pocket pinch!

A very small place in kolkata, only sitting for 8-10 people. But i have never gone a restaurant as cheap as this but really good. Their starters are really good. We had a starter never heard before, but it was good. Had noodles also, which was also good. But chicken in main course was not as good as others. Atmosphere is great. Overall must go. People are also nice.

Recently visited this place,located near Lake Mall. A tiny place with great food and a soothing decor.
The thing which caught my attention the most is that the owner himself takes the order of your food and performs a very good customer service.
We ordered Suimai Dimsums as the starter which was absolutely amazing.
Then we had a Hakka Noodles with Overdose Special Chicken and both of them satisfied my appetite.
This pocket friendly place is a must visit for all.

A small eating joint located in a small alley in the road opposite to Deshapriya Park, beside Tea Trove and near the Monalisa Guest House, Overdose is a quiet little place, useful for couples with a moderate budget. The place has about 3-4 table of 2 chairs each and will not be suitable for large groups. The food was delicious though. We had Veg Hakka Noodles along with Chicken with Pakchoy. The side dish was light and tasted brilliant.

OVERDOSE- The name itself struck me with lots of food-fantasies & to be true enough, they made justice with the name. Though the place is too small but it won my heart with their amazingly delicious food.The PAN FRIED MOMO & CRISPY HONEY CHICKEN deserve a standing ovation.
& to add to the food lovers' excitement,This is one of the best pocket friendly Chinese joint in Kolkata.
Hope to come back here with some more cravings.

PS: one advice- stick to their STARTERS. Main course is good but nothing special.

Me and my bestie went there yesterday. This small food joint offers chinese food at a very reasonable price. We had Suimai Dimsum for starters. It was good though with did not like the sauce much. For main course we ordered Schezuan Mixed Noodles as we are looking for something spicy and Overdose special Chicken as per their suggestion. Both the dishes were just great and perfect. Staffs are polite and friendly. They have seating facility for 10-12 people. Price is very reasonable and quantity is very good. If you are looking forward to have good chinese with a little pocket pinch, Overdose is definitely a must try.

Tiny space but great customer service and food. That's pretty much what we had expected and that is exactly what we got.
The man who took our orders (who, I assume, was the owner, going by the reviews) was very helpful and communicative.
We ordered Panko fish, chicken lat me kai, mixed and chicken fried rice, chicken manchurian, the overdose special chicken and fresh lime soda.
The Panko fish and the overdose special chicken were both new to us and we regretted neither. The other preparations were great as well. It is not without reason that Overdose has been featured in the 'Great Chinese' collection.
Also I have to mention the great value for money! Super pocket friendly place.
We hope to visit again. :)

Revisited:
They have expanded a bit, so the added 0.5⭐️
--------------------------------------------------Pretty smart interior, and the person running the place. Just that the kitchen being too close to the seating area (which is kind of a little claustrophobic as well) makes you experience the "unofficial informal" exchanges between the employed personnel.

We tried pan fried momo, was pretty awesome. We were in a rush the last the time, need to get back for a detailed experience of the menu. Pocket friendly for sure.

A definite 4.5⭐. Missed out on the 5⭐ because of the the space inside, it's a personal thing, you might actually like the coziness.

tried twice online order. 
First time they accepted order and called my number to say that they dont have what we ordered and we need to either cancel the order from our end or take what they are left in stock. We denied and complained to Zomato, however recieved our money back after 4 days.
Second Order: We still wanted to checkout the food, so we ordered again, this time the mixed pan fried noodle was good, however the Crispy Honey Chicken and  Veg Hakka Noodle was terrible to taste and seemed to be stale.

I've been here twice with Little vouchers. It's a small place. The prices are not particularly low. Food is good, not consistently great.

Chicken Hot and Sour Soup - Loaded with ingredients, not too spicy, just right. Loved it.

Chicken Dim Sum - Unbelievably dry. Kind of tasteless. I could not finish my share even, very disappointed.

Chilli Garlic Noodles - Again, a great tasting dish with the toasted garlic and sauces it was tossed in. This was also loaded with ingredients, and tasted great.

Hot Garlic Chicken - Mediocre.

This is a restaurant that has garnered a lot of attention , good reviews and goodwill for quite sometime now . And so many 4 star reviews deserves a visit and therefore we went for a delayed lunch at in an odd time in the afternoon.  It was about 3 45 pm ( Saturday ) when we reached there and we found a minimal decor eatery with a kitchen full of busy staff . Normally, these are signs of a little hidden gem and that exactly what my expectation was before having my meal here.  It started out quite well but it didn't live up to the hype. So, before outlining my detailed response as to why I didn't have a good meal it is worth mentioning that a 4 star restaurant in Zomato with it's extravagant reviews and recommendations does not fully ensure that you will have a nice experience at a place . And besides reading blogs by well acclaimed bloggers showering accolades at a place , please kindly read the reviews of a normal customer has visited a restaurant at during anytime between opening hours of a restaurant . 

° Location :-  You have to take Sarat Bose road which houses zeeshan and Maharaja . You have to take that side of the road that also houses maharani and after waking past few steps you will have to take the lane which will lead you to Overdose .Please consult Google maps to choose the lane .

° Ambience ( 3 / 5 ) :- Minimal ambience .Houses small tables of 2 to accommodate at most 10 people . The washroom is located at the back of a flat which is located beside the restaurant. On requesting you will be taken there but trust me you will not find it hygienic . Also, the bathroom door does not work .So better use napkins for the usual task which the staff will gleefully provide . 

-----------------------------------------------

° FOOD :-  We ordered 3 items for our meal and had the following experience .

1. Panko Fish ( 4 / 5 ) :- We were craving for a fish starter and when we asked the staff for suggestions , this is what they suggested.  And it was worth it.  A fine fish starter dish.. There were around 8 medium sized basa pieces perfectly pan fried and served with bell pepper and mushrooms.  Not just the fish , the mushroom was yummy . This is one starter dish that is highly recommended from this place and a must try for the fish lovers .

After having a fine starter , our expectations grew up the ladder very fast .

2. Pan fried noodles mixed ( 2.5 / 5 ) :- And this has to be the worst pan friend noodles i have ever had . The quantity of the dish was wholesome , good enough for 2 people . It also had generous amounts of chicken , prawn and egg . But , what destroyed the dish was the sauce .The blackish sauce felt like an overindulgence of soya sauce . I still feel it was soya although I am still pretty not sure . But whatever it was it killed the dish to the extent that we could not feel like taking just the chicken pieces out and eat . Certainly , I must say the dish had an OVERDOSE of a really bad and inedible sauce which absolutely killed it . Why am i ranting so much ? I was confident that a pan friend noodles is a dish that any Chinese restaurants can do well without any hesitation but certainly i am not right now. Change the gravy asap .

3. Suimai dimsum ( 3 / 5 ) :- This has to be the most boring dimsum ever . Thanks to the dip , otherwise I would have simply given up after the horrible pan fried noodles . The dimsum was very very dry and the filling was so so bland . My question to the chef is did he put ginger . The bland and dry dimsum seemed slightly edible with the excellent dip which seemed to have a tinge of vinegar and a lot of chillies . Unfortunately , you should rather skip this unless they revisit the recipe . 

4. Sweet lime soda ( 3 / 5 ) :-  The only thing i remember is an OVERDOSE of lime after they took more than 10 minutes to serve.  

-----------------------------------------------


° Service ( 3 / 5 ) :- When I first entered the restaurant I realized that even though there were no customers in the sitting area, the kitchen staff was really really busy . And this was because that there were a lot of food parcels and deliveries to be done . The starter took around 15 mins , followed almost immediately by the pan friend noodles . Sweet lime took a long time and we ordered the dimsum to at the end to change our appetite . After ordering , we saw that the staff and the owner was engaged in a sort of meeting and had minimum intention to serve the dimsum . It is when I decided to rise up and bring to their attention that one order was still pending . One man went to the kitchen and what seemed was that the man was pulling out dimsum from the steam basket but he didn't serve the food instead waited for a boy which again took a long time . Although they were very amiable and good in their behaviour , i found everything to be unprofessional and novice . Moreover , in the end their card reader was not working which prompted me to use PAYTM .Under such circumstances , i was more than unhappy . 

° VERDICT :-  If you read the restaurant page in Zomato you will find that it falls under the category of "Quick bite " section so automatically my criticism about the bathroom and ambience goes away . Then, let's work on the main part and that is food .It was not per the expectations. 

* A 4 star restaurant can surely do better than this.  It may happen that my orders were not that good but then you should know that a highly rated Chinese eatery with so many good reviews is expected to get a pan fried noodle right . Secondly , by now it is totally clear that this joint mainly specializes in deliveries and parcels which may be the best idea to be associated to this place . 

* Reviews can be highly misleading. If you see the reviews, you will often be associated by the word cheap for this restaurant . Okay, so let me make it clear for you . For a joint which is tagged as a " quick bite " , the price that is given to the dishes is good enough. My total bill came around 570 for 4 items out of which 3 was forgettable so there goes away the notion of cheap to you . As long as you realize what 570 rupees values  for you though . A also heard a lot of screams for " NO VAT .... " . VAT for a quick bite ? 

* This note is for the owner . You have received a lot of good reviews . You must be doing something right and congratulations for that . But, trust me reviews like mine will motivate you to be more clear about what you are trying to achieve . If you are going for a complete delivery experience then don't keep seats . Once you keep seats then please make sure that the experience is proper . I am.pretty sure that the overindulgence of soya in my pan fried noodles was due to some hurrying in the kitchen .

* My last note is for the reviewers . Please be more accurate, unbiased and confident in your reviews . Although , the starter was a good item nothing in my experience was worth a 4 star and I wonder how many reviews for this page are truly genuine and spoken from the mind . Words like cheap , fast service , great gravy give you an overpowering appeal but maybe otherwise a fluke . 

So, my verdict is that the joint was a no show . But , once again putting in faith in the percentage of genuine reviews in the page i still smell potential and I want to wish the owner the best for the upcoming days . I firmly believe that an honest , unbiased and clean spoken review like this will do a world of good for his establishment .

Inconsistent! At its peak! 

Initially, in its opening the food was really nice. They should MAINTAIN their QUALITY . Had ordered veg choupsey before, was really nice. Some weeks back, they had a discount (Some Swiggy Festival) or something, Looked liked it was made in a hurry. Had an issue with their food once before. The owner added the items in another order which was decent. 

I personally think, they should do a huge quality check. Sometimes the food is great, sometimes it's terrible!

The place is quite small, more like a garage turned into a resturant. Yet it's quite comfortable to sit and enjoy a meal. The staff there here are really courteous and well-behaved. They were very attentive and our empty water glasses were filled from time to time.
Now, coming to the quality of food, though pocket-friendly, it's not quite upto the mark. We ordered pan fried noodles which tasted very dull. The veggies were just boiled and tasted raw. The whole thing tasted more like the bengali's "shukto". The pan fried chicken was ok, though nothing great. 
Reckomended if you are really tight on budget and is ok with avergae quality of food. Otherwise this resturant won't be a very nice choice.

Overdose happens to be one of the hottest places around the city. And the name does justice to it. The name overdose indicates overdose of chillies in food with best taste of Chinese. It has limited menu but enough to drool over.

It was my birthday on Holi and I decided to visit this place as it had been in my wish-list for quite sometime. I had to pre-book seats as they can accommodate 8/9 seats only with proper table facility. Probably, this is the one & only drawback of Overdose.

On scheduled time, the owner called and confirmed my arrival. The staffs were pretty much welcoming too.

Reading reviews online, I opted for Dimsum suimai (chicken) and crispy chilli baby corn as starters. Dimsums were non-spicy and so very cute looking ones. As it was my birthday, they gave a complimentary plate of suimai dimsum. The baby-corn was  good but over-spicy. We further opted for Chilli garlic burnt noodles, special Overdose Chicken and Chicken Pakchoy. The first too were exactly how Indianised-Chinese must taste but the overdose of chillies burnt me literally. I like Pakchoy. It was a unique preparation with white sauce and plenty of green leaves.

If you are in Southern Avenue looking for a cheap dirt Chinese place this is the one. They don't even charge any VAT. What you see printed, that you pay. No added taxes. And keeping the taste on mind, I am definitely going back. Just that, if the overdose of Chillies is minimised this might do wonders.

More love to Overdose and do visit! :)

** Location = Desapriya Park Area, just for location's sake saying it is just at the same premises of the Tea Trove.

**Brief = I had thought of going there looking at the reviews it has got in Zomato and we were 3 of us when we went there to have lunch.

** Ambiance = Please let me clear it out at the beginning, not much of decor, neither much seating place as well, but the servers are helpful and are attentive which is very very important and what they lack in terms of size they make it up with their quality of food.

** Things tried = Chicken steamed momos 2 portions, Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Fried Rice,  Kung Pao Chicken and Schezwan Chicken.
And trust me they serve superb momos with the broth overflowing inside the small white dumps.
The rice was of sumptous quantity and I am just now a fan of their Kung Pao Chicken. It is one of the great ones I have had.
The portions were great taste wise and quantity wise as well.

**Recommended = Kung Pao Chicken.

** Purse Check = Our Bill came around Rs.700/- and I think Rs.500/- would enough for 2 persons.

**Overall = They deserve the reviews they are getting and they are doing a great job , hats off !!

Several small restaurants have gained quite a loyal fanbase in the vicinity of Rashbehari in the last couple of years. Being the foodie I am , I decided to have dinner from one such Chinese joint. Hence based upon recommendations from Zomato and my friends, I paid a visit to Overdose. Though I missed the discount on home delivery , the food was still very cheap and affordable. I ordered Pan fried Momo, Hot Garlic Chilly Noodles and Kung Pao Chicken. All the dishes had the right mix of spicy yet sweet flavour. Pan Fried Momo was too delicious and I can again pay a visit to this place only to taste this. They however need to work upon their seating arrangement as the restaurant hardly had 4-5 tables.

Overdose was on my list from long. Finally paid a visit here today. The place is small, bit difficult to locate. Ambiance inside is good.
Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Pakchoy, Overdose Special Chicken, Chicken Burnt Garlic Capcicum rice and Mixed Garlic Noodles.
Food was good. But the rice disappointed me, it was all salty in taste.
Chicken Pakchoy was very good and unique.
Prices are reasonable.

Quality:- Coming to the food quality....the food tastes very delicious....they know how to give chinese effect to the food....kung pao chicken was well prepared chicken was well boiled 😊 As we asked them to make the side dishes a bit spicy they did the same....and it was perfect in taste✌✌

Management:- Well management system....the no of times i asked them to change the air condition temperature they did so....served the food within time....we didnt have to wait long.....😊

Overall a nice place to dine out....only difficulty is seating space is very less only 10 seats are available
Other than that everything is perfect here....Will visit next tym😍😍✌✌

Was looking for a momo joint nearby and happened to chance upon this place. Although we ordered only fried chicken momos, looking forward to try the other things in the menu.

They add too much oil and the "overdose special chicken" recipe wasn't anything special... The noodles they use is of low quality and I have probably gained 1 kilo after having their food. It's a promising startup nonetheless. Needs to improve

Not such a bad idea for a quick bite. Haven't tried the main dishes. We tried Non Veg Dumplings and Crispy Honey Chicken, and enjoyed both. Dumplings were slightly dry, but enjoyed the taste.

Overdose was on my list for a long time now. Having read mixed reviews, I was more than eager to visit the place. The ambiance has honestly nothing much to offer. It is a small takeaway, dine in restaurant. They have opted for home deliveries via Swiggy and Zomato, and are planning to start their own deliveries. However, the lack of space or glittering lights are made way by the awesome quality of food. The food served is freshly made, and served steaming hot! The staff count is perfect given the area. Too many staff would have appear cluttered. Opted for chicken hakka noodles and a bowlful of yummy garlic chicken. The taste is bang on, and quantity sufficient for a good eater. The spices are neither less nor more, they are perfectly utilized. Waiting to go back for more!!

OVER-RATED Seriously !! What a place OVERDOSE! I bought a coupon from GROUPON worth rs 99. Ok so this restro is located just beside desapriya park hanuman temple. I went there with the coupon, saw there is a guy who is the manager and one couple friend of him. The thing they wre talking to eachother while smoking infront of customer that too using abusive slangs for other people. That was an horrible experience, totally ruined my mood. They kept me waiting for more than 45mins to prepare hakka noddls nd chilli chicken and the owner was such a guy who neither told me to get inside the restro and have a sit and I was standing outside for such a long time,nor they told that they will take time. Instd he was busy in smoking nd talking to his frnds. Horrible behaviour. Not going to visit ever. Before opening a restro they should have learnt how to maintain a good relationship with the customer so that the person feel like visiting again.

The food was good bt the quantity was poor in a bowl. Szechuan chicken was the best 😊 Bt hongkong chicken was mediocre. All over good hospitality and cozy ambience though the place is not much broad 😊  but the food is juz yumm 😋 looking forward to visit again.. Chinese food lovers should visit ASAP. 😊

My search for a pocket-friendly outlet near Deshapriya Park ended in Overdose..It's a pretty small outlet and is mainly functioning as a takeaway joint..!
The items are rightly priced and the portion size left us amazed..! 
We loved the crispy honey chicken,kung pao chicken and fried rice...!
They claim their Lat me Kai to be special and have heard the same from my friends too..! 
Well,if you are looking for a hearty meal without the pocket pinch, Overdose is the right place to visit...!

Hello peole who are reading my review. I have been there at overdose. We ate A LOT. Tasted various dishes. Love those starters, yes, specially starters. We thought we will order some more. Our Will supported us BUT Kambakht Pet Ne Saath Chhor Diya. ;)
Food quality quantity both is satisfying. Starters are bit more satisfying (I am pretty obsessed I tell you). Little cozy space. Even liked the location. (That place gave me a facebook dp ;p)
Last but never the least, I dont know the owner's name but really adored your puppy. Bruno, right?

This is a small food joint mainly suitable for take away. It is located just beside Tea Trove near the bylanes of Deshapriyo Park. I visited this place on a friend's recommendation and I'm glad that I did so. The food served here is scrumptious and the quantity was really great. The place has an added advantage of being highly reasonable. But the ambience here is average. Overall this place is worth a visit.

It was a long due visit to this small cute little outlet of OverDose. 
They're at a distance of just 10 minutes from lake mall,right beside Tea Trove at deshapriya park. 
They're really small with around 8 to 12 person's sitting arrangement. There's nothing really special about the restaurant. When I entered there was a distinct stinky smell and that was a huge turn down for me. The air conditioner was working and maybe they sprayed some room freshener or something so the smell vanished. 
Looking at menu we ordered a plate of Singaporean Hakka noodles and a plate of hot garlic chicken. We waited for 20 minutes. 
The staff came out with plates in his hand. He was poor at handling his work, serving technique was too poor. Whatsoever, the quantity and quality of the food was okayish. The chicken was really tasty but the noodles were not really made by sticking to the authentic recipe so it wasn't really upto the mark. 
During our tuck-in, the owner cane up and spoke to us personally asking about the food. That was really courteous of him and I really liked his gesture towards his customer. 
I would have given it a 4 if there wasn't the stinky smell and if the noodles were better in taste. 
There's a lot to improve. Best of luck. 
Thanks.

It's a very small eatery, more of a takeaway station. The servers are polite and very eager to assist, so is the manager/owner. Coming to the taste of the food it's pretty average. I read multiple rave reviews before visiting the place but didn't find the food matching up to them. The pan-fried momos were slightly salty, lacked a bit of the zing that they usually have. I didn't quite like the Suimai dimsums, the chicken in Lat-me-kai was a bit over-fried for my taste, should be a bit more tender with a little gravy.

'Overdose' is located at Lake Terrace near Sarat Bose Road & Desapriya Park Crossing,Just under the 'The Tea Trove'.It is ine of the best cheap chinese restaurant in kolkata.There food quality & quantity both are good.I'd been there few days ago with my lover for dinner.The area is too smal,two small tables are here.we ordered here 'Pan Fried Chicken' &  'Shanghai Dimsum' as a starters.Both items are delicious.Shanghai Dimsum is unique taste,it serves with unique dip (mixture of vinegar,olive oil).Then we ordered Chicken Chilli Garlic Noodles,it was also tasty & spicy.Price is very reasonable.I'll recommend this restaurant for tasting their chinese item,Must visit place.

Visited this place today for dinner. Located near deshpriya park, this restaurant is on the second right lane if u r walking towards lake stadium and situated next to the tree trove. Talking about space, this is a very small place with just 3 tables with just  2 chair each. However its beautiful from inside. Service is quick.
I ordered Garlic Fried Chicken as a starter which was dry and tasty. For the main course meal i ordered chicken fried rice and hones chilly chicken. Chicken fried rice was average  however the quantity served was very good for 2 ppl. Honey chicken was new and delicious.  It was spicy sweet and had all the flavours. So overall food was quite good and cheap. All these costed around 500  bucks. So must visit this place if u have a low budget and u want some delicious food.

This small outlet is situated near deshapriya park right beside tea trove. Its a small outlet with 10-12 seating capacity and high chairs and counter outside.
Now let's come to the food:
1) Starter- crispy honey chicken was quite and the honey did not make the crispy nature go away
2) Rice- Chicken fried rice was quite good and to add to it egg slices were also there which was a bonus
3) Main course- Kung pao chicken tasted really good and was also spicy.
All in all a good experience and worth visit for a second time.
P.S- pocket friendly and no extra taxes. All my orders cost only Rs.345/-

For main course chicken fried rice & overdose special fish;  again both dishes was very tasty and quality & quantity also very good enough for two people.  The service also good & the place is not pricey at all.  These are definitely in my bucket list. 👍👍👍👍

Chinese is a varied term used by restaurant in Kolkata to offer you the infamous world cuisine but ofthen it is a disappointment. But this place does justice to the cuisine at a whole new level. I cannot explain in words how good the food is here. They know their sauces extremely well.
The food is always served hot and the variation in their menu is definitely a delight. Very few places in the city serves such a variation of Chinese and selected South Asian cuisine.
To add to your surprise the prices are really low for the quality of food served to you. I have always been taken aback by the billing amount. 
The restaurant is owned by a fine gentleman named Rajdeep Seth who along with his staff will offer you the best services possible. 
So next time if you wish to visit a Chinese Restaurant to have good Chinese and have a fun time with friends/ family do head there!!

I heard about Overdose from a friend of mine. He said Overdose make amazing rice preparations, so I thought to give it s try. I ordered online: chicken fried rice, dry chilli chicken and singapore chicken. The fried rice was indeed amazing, it was properly cooked, well balanced with all the flavours, loads of shredded chicken. The dry chilli chicken was also good in taste, but the chicken pieces were a bit chewy. The Singapore noodles was full of flavours and colours, it was great. The packaging was perfect and all the dishes were hot. Overall it was a nice experience!!

I am surely recommending this place to my friends! :)

A very small joint mainly for take away (they have small sitting arrangement) just beside Tea Trove near the bylanes of  Deshapriya Park.
They serve you with Thai & Chinese delicacies. Not so wide array of menu to choose from but the limited menu facilitates to choose the correct food for the tastebuds at that mood.
We tried their pan fried chicken momo, burnt garlic capsicum rice & overdoze special chicken side dish. At to my surprise they all tasted immensely good & portion served was also satisfactory. Sure to visit again & try their other items.
P.S. As I parcelled the food home so no pictures taken. Highly recommended for take aways.

Found a deal on little app for takeaway of Rs 149 which included 
a portion of starter, a main course and a side dish. The offer seemed too good to be true but on finding good reviews on zomato, I bought the deal and ventured out to find the place. The restaurant is located right below tea trove near Deshopriya Park and the owner gave me directions to reach there. 

I had two coupons of 149 so I ordered for crispy chilli baby corn, chilli garlic noodles and chilli chicken(4 pieces per order so 8 pieces or basically a full plate). They have seating capacity for around 12 or so inside. Only one family of 4 was sitting inside. However as I had ordered takeaway, I had to wait outside. Again, that would not have been the problem as they have four high chairs and a counter outside. The problem was, the counter was littered with used tissue papers, a sticky spilled gravy, cigarette packets, lighters etc. The mess wasn't cleaned up in the whole 15 minutes I had to wait for my order. 

Coming to the food, they packed the small portions of chilli chicken in two different boxes. This might have been done to justify the packing charge of Rs60.  It took them another good 10 minutes to give me change for Rs 100, ultimately resorting to intervention by the owner. The noodles and the crispy baby corn tasted quite nice, but by then I already had a sour taste in my mouth due to my bad experience. 

New restaurants should not offer deals on these apps if they cannot honour them. Making a customer feel like a second class citizen standing outside glass walls for food isn't cool, at all.

I went there with my friend yesterday. It is a small place with a sitting capacity of probably 8-10 people. Ambience was basic. It's located just beside tea trove.
Coming to the food, we ordered crispy baby corn and American chopsuey... The baby corn was crispy and spicy enough with the right amount of peppery zest to it... The quantity was good too.
But the American Chopsuey was a disappointment.. The poached egg on top was a bit too fried and the sauce was a little bit too sweet for my taste. It had a very garlic-y taste. The quantity of the chicken in it was okay.
Both the dishes cost us just 245. Prices are tax inclusive and cheap.
Would like to visit again...

After reading all the good reviews, ordered for home delivery...food was good but the quantity of the noodles was perhaps a bit less comapred to the rice and didn't find any difference between overdose special chicken and schezwan chicken apart from a bit of garnishing perhaps...would like to try the other items nevertheless

Overdose is a Chinese take away joint with a few sitting arrangements located near Desapriya Park.

Ambience is nice.

Service is prompt.

Tried  Seafood lemon coriander soup & Chili Garlic mixed noodles. Soup was very nicely made and was lip smacking. Noodles was hot, spicy with generous fillings.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable.

A must visit place for Chinese Cuisine lovers.

This was in my wish list for many days, finally yesterday got the chance to taste their food first. ordered through zomato only. Ordered 3 chicken pan fried noodles, 1 lat me kai , 1 chilli garlic chicken.
Noodles were awesome, perfect crunchy fried noodles and a soulful gravy with lots of veggies and some amount of chicken. Awesome just, though I just felt the quantity is less than expectation. (Koi nehi, expectation hurts ;) )
Lat me kai and chilli garlic chicken, both were very nice. Not too spicy, soft tender pieces of@ chickens. Lat me kai i liked more.
Best part is they don't charge vat. So pocket pinch was quite affordable. 700 all total. So yes very satisfied. Looking for trying more of them.
P. S. Packaging was really fine.
–------------------

19th Feb,2017

I gave 4.5 before but now after receiving my 2nd order am decreasing that to 3.5. no complaints about taste,its awesome but the quantity? If I hope to get a starters dish will be enough for us 2 is that very wrong? But sorry to say it's enough for 1 only. 
Beautifully cooked chicken, excellent taste- 1 honey chilly crispy chicken reached to me with in 30 mins of my order placed by zomato. Packed well in small plastic bowl, but it's just 1 3rd of the bowl. Sorry to say highly disappointed. 
P.S. the delivery boy was extremely rude, don't know why showed a very bad temper over the ph as well as while delivering through attitude.

So in 1 line , i really need to think now whether i will continue ordering from overdose or not.
And whatever rating i have given that is solely because of their awesomely tasty food.

Well I usually do not prefer writing a review but in case of Over doze I did feel the need . It is a hidden gem started by Raj , personally haven't gotten the opportunity of meeting him but def must say that the food out here is pretty good. Well I have prefer judging the food on basis of quality , quantity , price . 
The items I tried were chicken munchurian which was quite good, the balance between the soya and garlic along with scallions was great. Lat Mai Kai again great texture however it was a delivery order again freshness of spring onions garlic was spot on. Then it was my favorite dish which very few could match upto was chilly garlic noodles noodles were boiled to the correct texture , no ajinomoto , garlic oil and chilly paste to correct amount. Now pan fried fish crispy spicy and hint of sweetness was too damn good. So this def met my expectation. 
Now pricing - 760 INR inclusive of taxes 
What I really liked about the outlet was noting down the details as per my preference. Very few outlets can match up with this quality. Thanks team over doze . I look forward to order further . Wish u all the best. Cheers

We bumped into this place when we went Pokémon hunting in Sarovar and were of course ravenous. This is a nice tiny place that can accommodate 10-12 people mac, is situated right beside Tea Trove near Deshapriya Park. It might be a little hard to locate from the main road, but once you go ahead a few metres you'll see it. The owner is a nice, young, courteous man, and we ordered as per his recommendations.

🔸 Mixed Pan Fried Noodles - I never tried pan fried noodles before, but it was delicious. Nice crisp noodle covered with a delicious gravy, loaded with mushrooms, veggies and sea weed, though it was REALLY lacking chicken or shrimp.

🔸Kung Pao Chicken - Well, to be very honest it totally tastes like dragon chicken from Denzong Kitchen, which is of course tasty.

The place is super affordable and tax-free. Oh, and apparently Chicken Lat Mai Kai is one of their well known speciality (which we found out while few other people who came in ordered the same and were absolutely praising it :3 ).

This is a little place near deshyopriya park. We went out for lunch and ordered kang pao chicken and chicken rice and noodles and another preparation of fish. Food was cooked really nice and service was quick and it's very pocket friendly. It's a nice place to try Chinese without burning a hole in your pocket.

I visited this place on a friend's recommendation, two days earlier. I am extremely glad that I did so.
There is not much to write about the interiors as the space of this eatery is quite less. It is more of a take-away joint.

But who cares about the space when the food served here is so scrumptious and the prices are very reasonable.
CHICKEN PANFRIED NOODLES : Bed of panfried noodles served with a delectable gravy consisting of exotic veggies, mushrooms and chicken ofcourse. All this was placed in front of me, merely at 135 bucks. Too good to be true :D
CHILLI GARLIC CHICKEN : 8 proper pieces of flavourful chicken was bang on. It tastes superb.

I was so impressed by OVERDOSE that I got the panfried noodles parceled today on my way back home. Unfortunately the quantity of the noodles seemed to be much lesser than the quantity served there in the outlet itself. I was disappointed.
Yet the taste of the food was no less appealing.
I would hope next time OVERDOSE doesn't disappoint regarding parceled food.
_______________
I got Chicken fried rice and Hot Garlic Chicken parceled today. And this time the quantity was good. 
Especially the Hot Garlic Chicken was really delicious.
A big thanks to the OVERDOSE team :)

Newly opened joint..easy on ur pockets..
Quantity is sufficient to feed all hungry souls..
Biggest drawback is their space crunch..ambience is average..
We ordered lat me kai..it was average..common taste but 8 pieces for 150 bucks... quite a deal..
The chicken steamed momo was well below average...bland and stuffy..the accompanying sauce was good..
The chilli garlic noodles was super hot...overzealous use of spices..the devil chicken was good..palatable.but again too hot to burn my taste buds....the burnt garlic and capsicum chicken fried rice was very average..
I felt the unnecessary use of spices turned the flavours down..otherwise a pocket friendly place..worth a visit

Ordered mixed chowmein and a couple of side dishes, namely Hunan Fish and Hong Kong Chicken. The chowmein was pretty well made, it was less oily and had pretty big chunks of chicken and prawn. The fish used in the Hunan fish was very good, the spices were also very well used to make up this dish. The Hong Kong Chicken was also very good, lived upto its reputation. The service was very good, and the rates are very reasonable. Keep up the good work.

Must say a great place! Though it's small yet it has warmth :) the owner himself was taking the orders, and was busy taking feedback, and was too nice. Kudos to that. Now coming to the food, it tasted really nice, chinese like the way bengali's like and was almost at par with other big restaurants in terms of taste. We were having a nearbuy coupon, and had chicken steamed momo, chicken haka noodles, panko fish,soft drink at Rs269, and totally satisfied, would surely revisit and try out the other dishes on the menu. A totally pocket friendly place, but do not visit in large groups, it has only a 4seater, a 2seater, and a side table which can accomodate another 4 i guess. This is mainly a takeaway joint, and the food wont disappoint you.

We ordered Lat Me Kai Chicken and Veg Fried Rice. 
The chicken was delicious. The meat was cooked well. We really enjoyed this preparation. The fried rice was also good in taste. Not much oil yet tasteful. The quantity could have been a bit more. I would suggest not to divide a single plate of rice into two, it will be short.

Overdose is a new pretty food joint in south Kolkata. Tucked in a corner in desapriya park , right below tea trove , this place serves some really authentic Chinese dishes. Though very small sitting arrangement , we were a group of 3 and managed to get a place.
For starters we ordered lat me kai and panko fish . Both were excellent . This was the best lat me kai I have ever tasted really. Next for main course we ordered burnt garlic friedrice (chicken) , pan-fried mixed noodles and chicken with pakchoy. Pan-fried noodles was truly a delight , incredibly good . Since I prefer spicy , I didn't like their chicken with pakchoy much , but the taste was indeed somewhat different. They somehow forgot our burnt garlic friedrice , and after asking again we were served normal friedrice . It was good but we ordered with different expectation . Nevertheless we ordered 3 coke to supplement our maincourse . Service was fast but they were a bit confused about everything it seemed . If you are going for something pocketfriendly yet good this place is definitely a must try !

This is a little restaurant with maybe a max capacity of 15 people.. that too is overestimated.. the service is horrible.. we went there around 3 for lunch.. they said therez something wrong with the gas and asked us to come back after sometime.. so we loitered a bit and came back again at around 5.. we were very hungry by this time.. we immediately ordered lat me kai and shanghai dimsums.. the starters came to our table after 30 min.. and no one was coming to take order for main course.. the place seemed heavily under staffed..  also had heard that panko fish is very tasty but unfortunately it was not available.. also they were not clearing away the plates.. main course was served on the same plate where we had starters..

However, coming to food.. both the starters were very tasty.. mixed Singapore hakka noodles, mixed fried rice, kung pao chicken and overdose special chicken was good too. Food deserves a 4.5 out of 5. The rating above is mainly due to poor service..

I have been a frequent customer of this restaurant through Zomato delivery option.
I placed an order of 2 mixed rice, 1 mixed pan fried noodles, 1 chicken dimsum, 1 chilly fish and 1 chilly pepper fish.
I experienced a mistake of over charging in the bill but the management is so good that they immediately contacted me, was very courteous enough to accept the fault and apologize. Also they sent me a complimentary chicken dimsum and chicken pepper fry along with my refund money!

Not only am I impressed with the food but also with the hospitality!

Oriental cuisine is the new normalcy in Kolkata and Overdose is no different but the cramped up restaurant makes it up with its swift service, courteous staff including the owner, and chicken delicacies.
This place cannot accommodate 20 person at once and the mundane décor won't soothe you. However, the food quality is definitely worth bragging about. Lat me Kai was scrumptious and worth every penny. Fried rice and Hakka noodles were just the usual ones. The best item would surely be the Hong Kong chicken.
You can visit this place and have a good time without being hard on your pocket.

We had ordered the suimai dumplings, chicken lat me kai, Singaporean noodles and Crispy Honey chicken. The food was served hot and delicious with fresh made spring onion sauce. Quite a unique joint for easy Chinese and Tibetan cuisine. Really enjoyed being there. Service was really friendly.

Edited : what went wrong with this place ? Smelly glass, they have 2 tables which takes 15+ minutes to attend.

The noodles was not properly cooked, schezwan fried rice was blunt. Sorry to say the place is very unhygienic.

I had a very good experience with this outlet in the past. But now it's a complete change.
===========================

Hands down THE BEST CHINESE i have tried in recent times.

Located by lane near deshapriya park, this small outlet is a hidden gem. They have small sitting arrangement, but i would recommend dining in the outlet rather than take away.

We ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles, Chilli Chicken Dry and Tiger Prawns. They serve generous portion of all dishes for a really reasonable price with excellent quality.

The tiger prawn is not in the menu but definitely recommended to anyone who loves Chinese food.

Thank you Overdose for the amazing food.

Foods are extremely good if I had to rate the food I would have rated it 4 out of 5  & there's no doubt about that but ...
the tiny six to seven seater place , 
not understanding the order properly (I ordered  schezwan noodles but they served plain chicken rice instead of noodles) , 
un-ability of providing what they have in their own menu,  
taking too much of time(we had to call for bill by cancelling our last order) 
& lack of hospitality ... made me lower the rate.  

I don't know how is their home delivery service, 
But I will try that too  ( that too for the food which we really loved )

We stumbled into Overdose because our initial lunch place was closed in the afternoon, so overdose being nearer to us we decided to visit this place.

This tiny place is located just beneath the tea trove. They have managed to fit the kitchen & a small amount of dining place for customers. This place has 3 tables of 2 sitters & 3 spots for desk platform. So takeaway would be recommended unless you are desperate to eat on spot.

So my friend & i got our seats without any hassle. We quickly ordered the following:-

1. Panko fish - i noticed this item being mentioned in some reviews over here & so i decided to go with this as our starter & oh boy it indeed was worth every spoonful of it. 8pcs of crispy fried bhetki fish in bell peppers,garlic,onions. The taste was delectable & yet funky to gorge upon. The soy garlic gave a very unique dimension of flavours. Well worthy to be their signature dish. Highly recommended!!

2. Chicken schezwan rice - 1 plateful of mild spiced rice chicken bits & veggies. This was an average dish to be honest. The quantity should be sufficient for 1 person & won't suffice 2 persons unless you have low apetite. Another flaw i found was that the chicken bits were added separately & wasn't fried along with the rice due to which the chicken was cold and lacked flavour.

3. Hot garlic chicken - 8pcs of pure chicken made in garlic sauce,onions & spring onions. The spice factor was on the lower side. The dish was good but i found the sauce to be a bit more pungent than usual which kind of ruined the experience for me.

4. Veg panfried noodles - A plateful of boiled & fried noodles topped with generous amounts of veg gravy. This dish was loved by us.

The pocket pinch was on the lower side since it cost us 300 per head. They don't charge extra taxes! The service however was a concern but the person in charge(most probably the owner) was very cordial to look after the issue. Being a new place it sure takes time to improve step by step. Will surely visit again in the future!!

Have been eating from this place for the past two  month and I must say their food has been consistently good. They have a neat menu with all things almost always available. 
Overdose is located in the exact opposite lane from Baskin-Robbins in Deshapriya. The place is small and cleanly done with a total of 10 seats inside and  four outside.  Service could be improved  but the servers are extremely cordial.  
As for the food I have tried the Chilli Garlic Chicken Noodles which is my favorite dish from this place. Their Chicken Momos take time but are very juicy when they arrive. Their Overdose Special Mixed Vegetables is great choice for vegetarians. Their Hot Garlic chicken is nice too. 
Overall I have a had a very good experience with Overdose.  Must try :)

We were craving for some good Chinese food and heard the name of this place for a long time.So, we wanted to try their dishes.The restaurant is located near Deshapriya Park just beside of Tea trove.This is a bit small place but they treated us extremely humbly.

We were very hungry and ordered : Suimai Dimsums, Panko Fish, Chili garlic Mixed Noodles and Schezwan Chicken.

Each and every dish was well cooked and tasted really yum.
We specifically liked the Panko Fish for the taste and the freshness of the fish and also the amount of mushrooms and vegetables it had.
Suimai Dimsums were good but what made the dish significant was the dip that's provided with the dish.
Chili garlic noodles was nicely made with lots of chicken,prawn,egg.
Schezwan chicken was  little dry  but the chicken pieces were soft and succulent.  

Overall it was a Great place, Neat and clean.The Food was awesome and also 
Pocket friendly as all the prices were inclusive of all the taxes.. 
And the best part of this restaurant is its owner,Such a polite behavior. :)
Highly Recommended......

Located just below Tea Trove.
Quite a gem. 
This is a little eatery with a proper air conditioned scenario. This place accommodates around 7-8 people at a time with 2 chairs seated outside. 

Check out this place not by its looks but by the food they serve. Delicious is the word. 
We ordered pan fried noodles with chicken and pepper chicken.
Each of the dishes were so well made. Infact such good amount of mushrooms, veggies added to the noodle. 

Service was excellent. 
Price: very reasonable. No extra taxes added.  Our bill was of Rs. 265. 
Recommended for sure.

Just visited this place today after all my friends suggested it.I was under the impression that may be it can be an ordinary Chinese restaurant.Yes it is an ordinary Chinese restaurant but  once you taste the food you'll love it .Reasons to go to Overdose are
1)It's very CHEAP.All my college buddies just hop into it.Well I was damn hungry and in this monotonous work loaded life you  always need time out for lunches.So basically this is the place.
2) Delicious food with different items.I had the coriander burnt ginger rice,which I felt something very yummy and a different recipes too.
3) Food available in a lot of quantity,so basically you are going to be OVERDOSED 😜

Only the thing that is to be improved that there is less number of seats available for dining so they should expand more.And And (to Overdose) please be quick at serving.Hunger means food.We need food which is served to us quickly so please please thoda jaldi serve kijiye !!!!😜😜😜😜
Nevermind it's it's not a bad place for first time visitors.And service is amazing and food dilvery available too☺

Location - if you are coming from Sarat Bose road you need to talk straight crossing the petrol pump. The lane just beside the standard chartered bank famous is where the food joint is situated. If you still can't locate ask anyone where's Hanuman Mandir overdose. Is right situated in that lane below tea trove
Ambience - very small but cosy and beautifully decorated with lights. I wish the place would have been larger. The staffs and especially the owner was very courteous.. in midst of their personal party he enquired about Our order.
Food- ordered lat-me-kei and shanghai dumdum
Both are their signature dishes. Lat mei kei was crispy juicy chicken. While dimsum was more like Ann exotic chicken filled momo with a relative hard covering.. both were good and unique in taste.
Price-  this Is the thing for which overdose really stands out. It's really cheap. 
No extra tax :* 
 Besides we got a 10% discount coupon which was an add on incentive to visit the place again.

Coming to the Food.
This was my 2nd visit to overdose and awaited one.
I ordered Shanghai Dimsum and Lat-Me-kai.
Dimsum are served with delicious sauce which is overall very juicy and Yummy.
Lat-Me-Kai are crispy chicken pieces which are medium spicy and are tossed up with various vegetables.
Chicken Spring Roll - Excellent. Very appealing and delicious.  
Chilli garlic chicken chow -  Spicy but tasty.  Very tastefull and fitting.  
Both the quantity and quality are rich and inviting.
Overdose is one of the few pocket friendly Quick Bites in the area.

My review is solely based on takeaway experience that i availed yesterday for dinner.
My orders were
CHICKEN PAN FRIED MOMOS , CHICKEN DUMPLING , NONVEG HAKA NOODLES, NONVEG FRIED RICE , PANKO FISH , CHILLI CHICKEN , OVERDOSE SPECIAL CHCKEN .
Each and every dish tasted good specially i loved the panko fish , overdose special chicken which were awesome. The pan fried momos were the best i had in recent times. Packaging was excellently spillproof. However the dumpling was missing , though a conversation with the owner Mr. Rajdeep ( friendly person and a warm host) settled it.

Coming to the dine in part , the space is quite small , with a three tables for two. The other side has 4 wall facing high stools. Four high tools are also placed in the outer space , two on each side. The bricky walls and yellow lit air-conditioned room however makes it a small cozy eatery for budget chinese dining.

My suggestion is to label the containers with the dish names as in case of mutliple packages it really becomes difficult to open up each and everything for identifying which is what , as chicken or fish side dishes look so similar , hence labelling can make the distribution part easier. Also it would be easier on your part to check the order before delivery thus minimizing chances of misplacement , as happened with me.

Overdose means an Overdose of Salt and MSG. And oil too (even steamed momos have oil droplets dripping). For the price charged, the number of pieces of momos or chicken in one dish is too few. The quantity of noodles is less and very few shreds of chewy chicken is added. All items lack any taste except an overpowering saltines. An utter failure in both Quality and Quantity.

This small joint located in Deshapriya park is a win win! 😁 Its an ideal place for college students who look out for quick lunch or snack after classes with friends. People can also come for date here. The ambiance of the place, though small is worth the experience. The waiters are jolly and attentive. Coming to their food, their pan fried momos and dimsums are one of the best in town and can give a strong competition to other reputed restaurants. But my favourite dish will be the American Chopsuey and Sea food lemon coriander soup. The flavours of these two dishes were unfathomable. The chopsuey was mouth watering and I feel it was better than the famous chopsuey of Bar B Q.. ☺ All in all it was an amazing experience and I will surely recommend this one. And visit here more often. 😃

Last evening was our anniversary and unlike previous years we decided to stay in and order our favorite cuisine Chinese.
Scanning Zomato and reading the reviews we decided on Overdose. I got to speak to the owner Raj and after listening to my specifications and learning that it's our Anniversary he very kindly added a complimentary dish! 
Coming to the food, everything was wonderful and we ordered a lot! Only suggestion I can think of is to make a thinner batter for the golden fried prawns.
The quality and quantity leaves nothing to be desired and the pricing is very pocket friendly.
The best part was when I got a call from the owner later in the evening to enquire about the food. That is unheard of!
Thanks Zomato and thanks Raj for a wonderful dinning experience.Next time shall surely visit the restaurant.

This is my second visit to this cozy little food joint located near deshopriyo park rather just the next lane after crossing the most famous monalisa guest house, has an extremely sober,well lit and quite quirky walls.
Coming to the food, the panfried chicken momos are one of the best kind of momos i've had in a while.
The chilly garlic noodles is slightly more chillier than the usual ones,though depends on personal taste buds.The burnt capsicum chicken rice having that roasted smell is something one would yearn for more.The panko fish and the overdose special chicken is the must try among all the dishes .
Last but not the least,even if they do not have a menu for desserts,the overwhelming behaviour makes it through 😊
To add on...it is a pocket friendly place...and a must visit for every college goer and foodies 😊

I was craving for some good Chinese food and was tired of Mandarin -ka chinese . Since , read some really amazing reviews and this one being on my priority gastronomic needs for long..Zomato home delivery came to my rescue .The time taken was unusually short span of a time :D The entire packaging deserves 5/5 .Now , coming to the food we ordered a Mixed pan fried noodles ,Burnt ginger capsicum fried rice , Panko fish and Hunan chicken .The medium in which the food prepared was exceptionally god .Each and every dish was well cooked and tasted really yum .I specifically liked the Panko Fish -a) for the taste and the freshness of the fish and b) the amount of mushroom it had (too much to satisfy a mushroom lover like me) .It satisfied my Chinese Cravings too much .The pinch on the pocket was also easy ( keeping the demonitization issue n mind) .Thank you , Overdose .You made our tummies happy ...happier 💝


I have been an ardent fan of Overdose since its inception and have been ordering almost every month .Today my order was for steamed chicken momo , veg Hakka noodles and Chicken packchoy

The steamed momo was dripping oil .
Veg hakka noodles oil used was extremely inferior quality smelling and tasting really bad like road side stalls
And Chicken packchoy was completely tasteless .

My mother has been vomiting since eating the food and so is my situation .

This was a good Chinese restaurant i was satisfied with after a long time but now I have to rethink twice to order the next time .
Giving discounts and degrading the quality horrendously is just not acceptable .Thank you !

I have been wanting to try this place for a long time now. Finally did manage to go there today with friends for dinner. The place is small but one.shouldnt judge them by their place. The food tells u what notion you're to develop about the place. I'm not much of a Chinese lover but after a long time after I tried out the food here i have come to develop a liking towards this cuisine. Quality was brilliant so was the quantity. Tasted amazing both the starters and main course. Attendants were hospitable and the owner Rajdeep is a brilliant host. We were also given a complimentary dish. Ordering for 3 starters, beverages, 3 side dishes along with 3 main course I expected the bill to be pretty high, however much to our astonishment the bill was way below what we even wildly imagined. In a nutshell if you want fantastic Chinese food without harming your pocket much this place is for you. 
Must try : Chilli Garlic noodles with hot garlic chicken - heavenly beats any famous resturant but yes as the name suggests its burning hot.

i came to know about this joint while searching for asian cuisine restaurants under budget. i saw the high rating and cheap price and thus excited to visit this place. well, the place is too small. the ambience is somewhat average. what was extraordinary was the food. we ordered overdose special chicken, black pepper fish and american choupsey. well, the quantity is not much (especially when you have visited places like calcutta bistro where the quantity is huge). one plate isn't enough for two. but the taste and the quality of food is really outstanding. to add to that, the hospitality of the manager or the owner (not sure) was something to mention.

After a long time we finally discovered a new Chinese cuisine joint where the owner personally takes ownership of his restaurant and provides absolutely delicious food.

This review is based on the experiences we had on the 3 different occasions that we tried this joint. The first time was when we ordered through Swiggy. Unfortunately, I was left out of the party as i returned home late at night carrying my favorite Mutton Biryani from Zeeshan. So, I wud say it was more by choice. However, after listening to rave reviews abt the food from my wife and both sons (the younger one is just 5, mind u), I decided to give it a try.

So, one fine evening, all four of us visit this joint for dinner. The joint as such is not something great to talk about but the food and the warmth we got there was overwhelming. Starting from the Lemon Coriander Soup, through Panko Fish, Lat Me Kai Chicken, right upto the Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Fried Rice and Kungpao Chicken, everything was impeccable. The owner, Raj, personally looked into if everything we were served were as per our liking.
Coming to the 3rd occasion, we had again ordered through Swiggy for 2 portions of Chicken Fried Rice and 1 Kungpao Chicken. Subsequently we received a call from Swiggy saying that only 1 portion of Chicken Fried Rice was available. So, my wife immediately called up Raj and after a brief discussion, agreed upon a Mixed Pan Fried Noodles. Moreover, Raj didn't charge us anything extra, though I believe Mixed Pan Fried Noodles costs more than a Chicken Fried Rice. Now, that is what "going the extra mile" means. Way to go Raj .. keep up the good work.

Would definitely recommend this restaurant to all Chinese lovers.

Nice little Chinese joint around Deshopriya park. Beside Tea Trove. It's better to go for home delivery as the seating space is a bit cramped. Good food with a pocket friendly price is their usp. But I personally felt this place is a bit over hyped. 
Food Ordered  : 
 Chicken sweet corn soup : Nice thick broth good to start the food journey.
Lat me kai : This dish a did not satisfy my taste buds. Frankly sleaking I have tasted better lat me kai than this. 
Over dose spl chicken and Chicken fried rice: This one is house specialty and its went  fried rice. Fried rice quantity was good enough for 2. 
Chicken hakka noodles: Again a decent one.

All this costs us Rs 730.
 
In a nutshell good lil pocket friendly option.

First time at Overdose,near Deshopriyo Park with my lady..Plan was to take away with packed food..but we were before time.. Bt hospitality of the staff was really impressive.. We wait inside for a few time..no sooner our food was ready to go.. 
Comming to the food.. We took chilly garlic noodles and chilly chicken...but a complain.. They didn't provide spoon..😞 
But it was ok..cos..they give us an opportunity to lick our fingers..because of the tasty food... O yum..the noodles was perfect and chicken was really tasty..spiciness added more flavour to it..service was quite fast..
Must try it.. There a tasty treat waiting for you...

This place can be easily located as it is just beside the Tea trove near Deshapriya park. I have purchased a nearbuy coupon for the takeaway offer of 99 rs. The deal includes one rice or noodle item and one chicken gravy item. I have gone with one of my friends and we preferered to take the chicken chilly garlic noodles along with chilly chicken. We were greeted humbly by the restaurant authority and they offered us to sit in the dining space while the food was being prepared. As we visited quite early we have to wait for sometime but their hospitality was very nice. The dining space is a little bit small but nicely arranged. Now coming to the foods, it was super tasty. The noodle was cooked perfectly with right blend of spices and it was tasty. The chilly chicken was also very much good as per as my taste buds. The chicken pieces were soft and juicy with balanced amount of cornflower that I liked the most. Overall it is definitely a good place for having tasty foods at a pocket friendly price. Just a small suggestion to the restaurant authority if you guys are giving foods as takeaway then do provide spoons. (Though I enjoyed finger licking after having such delicious foods). 😋

This eatery doesn't do justice to its high ratings.. First of all, the place is too small.. it can hardly accommodate 10 people at a time.. Secondly, the food is nothing great.. Quality and quantity are both average.. one main dish is sufficient for one person.. and lastly, service is slow and inattentive..

Located right below tea trove deshapriya park this small join will ensure that you overdose on best of best Chinese Cuisines on offer.  Probably the best New Chinese Restaurant to have opened up.Staff are extremely cordial and helpful,Prices are all inclusive. 
Decor wise it real damm neat with rustic walls and can accommodate 25-30 people at one go.We order for... Suimui Dimsums,Chicken with Pakchoy ,Mixed Ginger fried rice,Chicken Pan fried noodles, Devils Prawn along with soft drinks.Suimui dimsums are a perfect start ,the highlight is the dip that's provided with the dish, it leaves a tingling ever lingering note even after you've finished the dish. MUST TRY,HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS.Chicken with Pakchoy ,Mixed Ginger fried rice is another combo that tingles ones palate, the packhoy leaves only enhances the feel of the meel teamed up with the ginger fried rice ,Another MUST TRY & RECOMMENDATION.Chicken Pan fried noodles, Devils Prawn this combo will add some definite spice to your taste buds and experience and ensure that you salivate to get overdosed bigtime. The spicy prawns is a perfect partner to the pan fried noodles. The Bill came upto 975 inclusive all, THIS IS A MUST VISIT FOR ALL FOODIES, surely coming back for round 2.

'Overdose' is the newest entry in the Chinese food scenario of Kolkata. It is located near Desapriya Park in the lane beside Just Baked. 

We went here yesterday on my lady's birthday at 7.40 pm. The eatery is very small and we were lucky that we got two seats. The eatery can arrange a maximum of 12 persons inside. The management should look like into this. 

Coming to food, we ordered one 'Lat-me-kai' first. Service was fast and our food came within seven minutes. This dish is the best Chinese starter dish that I have ever had. Fried chicken in sauce along with chopped spring onions made this dish heavenly. We loved it. 

Up next, we ordered one chicken hakka noodles and Devil's chicken. The chicken hakka noodles was great. It was perfect in all aspects. The Devil's chicken was delicious. It was loaded with chicken. The chicken pieces were as soft as a pillow. This was a spicy dish and the addition of black pepper made it spicier. Thr chicken pieces were tender. The dishe went well with the noodles. 

The behavior of the staff was amiable. In a nutshell,we have found a great eatery and we will visit again.

Whenever my n bestie are home to chill we always crave for food. One such Eve we ordered from "overdose " the delivery was not too slow but the most inconvenient thing for us was the delivery person had no change which they should carry for home delivery. Now coming to the food we ordered Szechuan fried rice n hunan fish. Both the dishes were good but the fish was a bit too spicy. But in the end our food cravings were satisfied. Looking forward to visit the restaurant soon! ;)

We've eaten for the first time at "Overdose," a relatively new Chinese restaurant, and had exceptionally good meal. Although small, the restaurant is reasonably attractive. The menu is standard and reasonably priced. The food was fresh, properly prepared and a great value for the price. We had Lat-Me-Kai, Overdize Special, Chicken with Pakchoy, Pan fried noodles, Chilli garlic noodles. My personal favourite was Overdize Special. Wonderful service and highly recommended.

A bit spicy but tastes good. In main dish we ordered mixed  panfried noodles, mixed fried rice and garlic chicken. All the items are delicious. Its completely a budget restro. Tastes were just FATAFATI according to the prices. Worthy for a second visit.

I have ordered food from here through swiggy earlier today after a week wanted to binge on Chinese. The weather and mood calls for it. So headed personally. We started with chicken lemon coriander soup chicken lat me kai and panko fish. The soup was good,  lat me kai was well made but the panko fish was outstanding. The crisp fish stir fried with bell peppers and oyster mushrooms. Truly gourmet. Main course we had a mixed and a chicken fried rice with kungpao chicken. The rice well tossed was flavourful .The chicken was tender and the gravy was yumm.Raj was extremely warm . Great customer service. The place though small for a sit down dinner is a gem for take away or delivery. Extremely pleased with the quality and quantity of food. Oh yes, it's sweet on the pocket too .My bill with a 10% discount for soup two starters two staples and a side dish was 850. 4 more than stuffed and satisfied people. Highly recommended .

I'd been to Overdose in their initial week of opening itself. I happened to venture into the lane of Tea Trove and bumped into Overdose instead, that too at lunch time. The place was not really completed by then, but obvious. The seating capacity inside the restaurant is crunched with three tables to accommodate four each and a side table with high stools for the solo dinners ideally. 
I was looking for light lunch, starters dish of Suimai Dimsum was ordered. Well I wouldn't really find much differences between our regular steamed momos. Perhaps the shape of these dimsums were different. Taste wise, they were okay-okay. As an accompaniment, a sauce/dip was provided which had olive oil base.
Overdose was looking for a big bang with a pre-Durga puja opening.

Not all that glitters is Gold! But then, you need to glitter to be Gold. A rather ordinary looking Cafe, located on the ground floor (More like a garage carved out space) houses a brilliant yet humble looking Overdose. Located in the same place which used to house Cafe 23, Overdose aims to satiate the hunger and tastebuds of their patrons by serving mouthwatering and delicious foods at affordable and pocket friendly prices. 

The best part of using Zomato is one gets to see all the buzzing and less known eateries all around. Bookmarking this particular place sometime back, I decided to head out to this place today along with a friend. The owner Rajdeep is a humble man and welcomed with a cheerful smile. We ordered for a Fish Pepper Salt (Dry, without being sauteed in any sauce), Sui Mai, Non Veg Momo and Overdose Special (Chicken). The Fish Pepper Salt was crispy, and had a lovely balance of salt and sweet. The Fish was fresh and the use of Bhetki surprised us. The Sui Mai was decent, but what stole the show was the amazing dip. Oriental lovers, please check out the dip, if not anything else. The Overdose Special was quite good as well, with the Chicken portions being sauteed in a lovely sweet and tangy sauce.

The best dish of the day (according to me) were the Non Vegetarian Momos. Pefectly Juicy and steamy, they had the right amount of moisture in them. The stuffing was excellent and pretty good in quantity. Beware though, please take care while having a bite, as the juice is going to fall out on the plates. (Mind your shirt). The entire sags was pretty nice and the bill, the cherry point. The food was excellent and mindblowing. Honestly, we could care less about the ambiance and the shortage in space. The owner and the brand aims to provide delicious food, and to my perception they are pretty much on the right track on it.

Nice place very homely and delicious food, nice ambience and budget friendly.Little small but lovely seating arrangement and smartly designed interiors.
We decided to go for a lunch here.
Our menu includes
1. Seafood lemon coriander soup.
2. Lat me kai.
3. Chicken suimai
4. Chicken sanghai dimsum
5. Crispy honey chicken
6. Dry panko fish
7. Dry devil's prawn
8. Chicken burnt ginger capsicum rice
9. Overdose special chicken
10. Chicken with packchoy
11. Chicken pan fry noodles.
The seafood soup tastes like some authentic Chinese dish. Soup is not spicy though but have ingredients of all kinds of sea food. A must try.
Lat me Kai is one of the best dishes served here. Boneless chicken pieces are fried and tossed into a special schezwan sauce that they make and it is pure bliss.
Chicken suimai and sanghai dimsum tastes as beautiful as they look.
Crispy honey chicken is a complete amusement to your eyes as well as to the taste buds. Those who don't like much spicy food go for this item.
Dry panko fish as it's name suggest doesn't come with any gravy but the stuffings they do is great and how soft they are inside is just a wow factor. Shoutout to the chef for such commendable work.

Ending a overdosed starter menu we decided to go for a little lighter main menu.
Mixed burnt ginger capsicum rice and the Overdose special chicken goes well with each other. Rice being a little on lighter spicy side and the side dish is bit overpowered with spices.
Chicken pan fried noodles as per me is the best dish and my personal favourite. Beautifully presented with fried noodles topped with mushroom chicken slices egg white , Chinese vegetables and a light gravy. Tastes wonderful and can be had without any side dish also. That's how good it is.

They served all food on matching black crockery which looks pretty cool. Delicious vibrant food items served on those plate is a treat both to our eyes and tongue.
Hats off to the staff for such quick service and wonderful behavior that they have. They always serve with a big smile.
Each dish was delicious with all the right flavours. Place has some reasonable price that they charge. Preice of the items are inclusive of taxes.This place is a must visit for all.
Recommended everyone to give a try to this new joint.

On nabami afternoon we went there with the plan of having some starters.but when we reached there around 12.30 pm,they informed us that the cook hadnt arrived yet as he had got stuck in traffic and hence told us to come back after 30 mins.we did so and when we came back later the cook had arrived. Their service was prompt.within 15 mins our order got served at the table. We had overdose special chicken,black pepper fish and lat me kai.overdose special just simply won our heart..it was amazing.the other dishes were pretty delicious too.infact the owner himself came ,suggested us the dishes and even asked us for our feedback.overall had a pleasing experience!

Overdose is located where Cafe 23 used to sit q few months back.  Right beneath The Tea Trove,  this quaint joint serves pretty good Chinese fare at affordable prices.  The place is quite tiny with only three tables and a high desk.  The place can ideally sit about 8-10 people at a max.  The problem that I faced on my visit was that there were too many flies and insects and sadly the restaurant doesn't have an insect catcher.  However, the owner was sincere in his efforts and assured that the issue will be attended to.
We ordered for a Fish Pepper Salt as starter. The fish used was Beckti which was nicely fried.  The fish was firm yet flaky. The sauce however was overwhelmingly spicy but I guess that's my own issue and not really an issue with the preparation.  The main course consisted of Chicken Hakka and chicken chilli garlic noodles with Overdose Special chicken.  The regular Hakka noodles was delicious. It wasn't laden with oil unlikely most joints and tasted like home made stuff which is a good thing. The chilli garlic noodles was spicy as expected. The Overdose Special chicken was good. Chicken cubes in a tangy mildly spicy sauce with three peppers....it is quite enjoyable on its own as well.  
The service is slow but the owner is extremely cordial and personally asks for suggestions for improvements.  I wish Overdose good luck for a long run.

Today I Bunked My School At 2:30pm And I Came To My Mother's Home Lake Gardens To Recieve A Parcel Of WWE Superstar John Cena T-shirt From Flipkart. After That My Kalpana Di Gave Me A Piece Of Fish Which Was Leftover Only For Me. After That My Sister Malvika Ordered From Swiggy App From Overdose, Desapriya Park. She Ordered 2 Plates Chicken Momo Steam @ Rs. 80/- Each Which Was To Oily But It Was Also Tasty To Eat After That She Ordered 2 Plates Of Chicken Lollipop @ Rs. 80/- Which Was A Little Spicy But Yummy As Well.  The Bill Came Around @ Rs. 341/- And My Sister Malvika Paid That Amount. Thank you Overdose For Making Our Day Very Very Precious.

Went there last week. The lung fung soup and the sweet corn soup were quite tasty. The Crispy Honey Chicken was the star dish.The Lat Me Kai won't disappoint you. The Chilli Garlic Noodles were also good. Adding to these we had Fried Rice, Garlic Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken (the garlic chicken was better) . Food was really good at reasonable prices but service was really bad. Nobody was attending us properly. Otherwise a good place to have chinese cuisine. Upasana Ghosh

This is my first review on zomato and m dedicating it to Overdose.We went for snacks and ordered steamed chicken momo and chicken lat-me-kai.Both the dishes tasted delicious.Momos were simple,tasty and nicely garnished.Chicken lat-me-kai was just amazing.It had a very slight crunchy coating and sweet n sour taste.The service was fast.The interior was pretty decent.On a skeptic note the place can accomodate only 10 people at a time.So increasing the dining space would be great.Once you have been there you would crave to revisit.So go and give it a try and you wont be disappointed.

Quantity of the food is very good so do the quality... Every dish was very delicious, this is a new joint recommended everyone to visit... Looking forward to drop by soon

When you know, you'll be served with delicacies, then nothing else matters. This place has the perfect ambience where you can feel cozy and enjoy the scumptous meal. Here happiness is served hot without burning pockets. Manchow soup and Overdose Special chicken should be there while you place an order. Must visit and often eatery joint ! "Overdose" - you took my heart away.. 😊

Excellent place. Nice ambience. We were cordially greeted when we entered the place. Unfortunately, the seating arrangement leaves something to be desired. Seating arrangement is only for 10 people, out of which only 6 people can be properly seated at a table. However, the food was very good. We had a coupon for two, and we ordered hot and soup with lat me kai starters, Hakka noodles and Hunan chicken. The hot and sour was delicious in addition to being actually hot and sour, and not a pale imitation. The lat me kai chicken and Hakka noodles were simply delicious. Sadly, the Hunan chicken was bland. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place, and would like to visit it in near future. Great place for a budget friendly Chinese food experience with nice ambience.

​It is always my crave for Chinese that brings me to the doors of every Chinese restaurant that opens up in the city. With the huge number of such restaurants, it’s always a tough job to decide on which on to give a visit. Mostly, I tend to stick to my favourites. But often I decide to give a chance to the newer chinese restaurants that are establishing their roots in the city. Well, it was my sudden urge for Chinese that brought me to this new little place, Overdose.

Ordered lat me kai chicken, overdose special chicken, fish salt and pepper, mixed fried rice and sezwan rice, all the food items were very good, ingredients used were fresh, adequate use of salt and spices made the food delectable. Special mention goes to lat me kai which was excellent. Price is very pocket friendly also.

Went to this restaurant few days back. Not a big place though but its surely comfy. Walking through the entrance we were warmly welcomed by the manager (I guess). The management was very friendly and helpful when selecting the menu and ordering the food.

When the food was served, we started to get a vivid feeling of being at home as the management would often come to us and ask for feedback for each and every dish just to make sure that the food served were of the optimum quality.

Well, they do serve awesome and delicious food. The starter consisted of large pieces of chicken. The soup tasted way better than those of expensive restaurants. Quantity of rice in a single plate was more than enough for two. The chicken was tender and juicy. The spices had their distinct flavour. Nothing to complain about.

The only drawback was the seating capacity due to low space. But then the much better than average food quality in such a low price can easily beat that drawback. And yes, THIS RESTAURANT WAS NOT AT ALL TOUGHT TO LOCATE. HARDLY TAKES 3-4 MINUTES FROM DESHAPRIYA CROSSING AND THE MAP DOES EXACTLY WHAT ITS MEANT TO DO. Keep serving awesome food. Thumbs up for the management. Would definitely visit again. :) :)

This place is nothing like those posh eateries. It has got a bare minimum of everything. The place has a sitting arrangement for about 10 people. The ambience is nice. The staff were very very cordial and helpful. We initially decided on ordering shezwan noodles and hongkong chicken but the staff suggested us to take Devil's chicken. I was quite satisfied with the food and the quantity overall. The place is very cheap but still provides quality food and service. Since it opened just a few days back, I'd recommend this to more people. Let's make this place famous.

Small cozy Chinese eatery located next to Tea Trove on the second left lane from Marco Polo, if you are coming down from Southern Avenue. Visited to this eatery for light evening snack. Tried their Panko Fish - the taste was delicious. Battered fish perfectly deep fried and tossed in sweet sour gravy  sauce (perfectly balanced) served with bell peppers. Service was instant.

Bought a coupon for this on Nearbuy.com .  The ADDRESS WAS NOT GIVEN AT THE RIGHT PLACE ON THE MAP!!! Whoever marked the location is incapable of marking it correctly - I spent a lot of time hunting for the right place all the way near Oudh 1590, that too on a Puja night, and I WAS FORCED TO COME BACK WITHOUT MY FOOD, IN THAT MADDENING TRAFFIC, WITH ALL THE ROADS BLOCKED EVERYWHERE!! Thanks!!
So - went today, went by the NUMERICAL ADDRESS this time, and finally found it! - it's the Tea Trove building! It's tiny, but the decor is quite nice, there was a small guy sitting outside, and, you guessed it, he tried to do 420 - said "Ei offer-ta to aamra Pujor pore shuru korchhi" - when I firmly said "Website-e to sheta lekha chilo na", then he invited me inside. So......I DID end up getting my food.
The coupon was for fried rice and chicken - the rice tasted, well, like rice, it had tender white thin pieces of chicken which were really great! And I got 4 pieces of hot garlic chicken, I TOLD the guy - "Akdom jhaal na", but it was so jhaal that I couldn't have. But I still have to say that the outside coating of the pieces were very soft, and the pieces were succulent.
For 99 Rs, it was a bargain, even the ROADSIDE places near Ballygunge Cultural had the same thing for about 150 I think, and this is like, a brick n mortar Restaurant! If 1) they learn to give less chillies when someone tells them, and 2) if you can FIND the damn place!

"Overdose" is a good place to hang out with friends.
The quality and quantity of food is very good.
i went with three of my friends and looked for chicken lollipop. The owner advised me us to try " Lat-Me-kai"
as it was there best dish they can offer to us as starters.

We took a risk, and being a foodie i always wanted to try out a new dish. So the dish really tasted well.
We were so happy with the politeness of the owner and the staffs that we ordered "Hongkong chicken", "Mixed gravy noodles" & "Devil's Chicken".

Over all a good place to visit .
Thank You.

To be honest I was overdosed on ajinomoto.
My head was spinning with immense pain and my stomach was hurting after consuming from this joint.
The place is small and cramped up.
The manager who tries to change his voice while talking was decent.

Went for the following items 

Coriander Soup, Hot & Sour Soup, Lat-Me-Kai Chicken, Hong Kong Chicken, Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Hakka Noodles.
The item which I liked the most was Chicken Fried Rice but that too was spiked with too much ajinomoto.

Location : This li'l food joint is tucked deep inside the lane where 'Jishu Sengupta's pujo takes place.Landmark is the The Tea Trove cafè.
Ambience : Lacks in space.But extra marks can be credited for the warm lights and lovely walls. ☺
Food : Guess where you get classic chinese delicasies for hardly any money?No.I'm not talking about IMAGINATION.I'm talking about OVERDOSE.
We ordered a lot for 6 of us and the piping hot food was served quite fast.The staffs are not well efficient yet,but I believe it will be made up over course of time.our orders consisted of two starters,three side dishes and three plates of rice.
1.Dry Chilli Fish : Crispy fried fish fillet loaded with spring onion,pieces of green chilli.
2.Overdose special chicken (starter) : diced chicken tossed in just the right amount of sauce and capsicum.
3.Schezwan veg rice : Loaded with veggies.High in spice quotient.
4.Devil's Chicken : Spicy chicken side dish.
5.Honey chilli chicken: a balanced dish with both sweetness and spices shooting clues of its presence.
6.Hunan fish : Fried fish fillets in non-spicy clear gravy.
The food is overloaded with freshness and flavours that already convinces you for a secret commitment to come back again. ☺
The added ingradient seems to be utmost care that the chef pours in huge quantity,gives the dishes a happy-homely feel.
Certainly going back to this hidden gem.
Can't wait to see them grow. 💟

Last night it was hard finding a place to eat as most of the restaurant had waiting list as a result of puja. This is a small place with seating capacity of 10 people. The one thing people will notice here is the hospitality here. The manager here is really helpful and was not rude at all.
Even though the place was small but the way its all managed is good consideting the kitchen with seating capacity of approx 12 people. On asking he said that he will be opening a bigger food joint later at salt lake.
Talking about the food, we ordered chicken momo., chicken overdose, devils chicken, pan fried noodles and mixed fried rice. Mix fried was ok. Nothing to complain about. Chicken overdose was good. Chicken with capsicum medium spicy and devils chicken was the spicy one with sliced chicken on red gravy. Pan friend was also good. Momo was good and was served in 10 mins.
Mostly in puja food quality of some places comes down as a result of large volumes but this was not the case for this restaurant.
Pocket pinch was 2720 which is quite low considering 10 people in hand. Will fefinitely recommend this and visit sometime again. Hoping to see their new place with larger seating capacity

Want to get overdosed ? Then OVERDOSE is the best place for you. it's located 23 jadunath sarkar road,Desapriya park, sarath bose road. ( opposite Baskin Robbins, near Hanuman Mandir.
As i entered the best thing that caught my attention was the pretty simple and classy decor at the place which made the ambience of the place extremely beautiful.
Nice and quite place to have chinese meal. The momos and the dimsums are just 'WOW'. Owner and workers are ready to help you to decide what will be suitable for your experience of good food. For those who haven't recently been to OVERDOSE, it's really  gotten quite excellent. The restaurant's atmosphere is sophisticated but at the same time, almost homey. Prices too, are really reasonable for the quality and quantity, though certainly not cheap. 
An ideal place for a foodie. I would love to visit this place again.Keep up this good work.

An eatery worthy of 4 points. Ever heard of the phrase "never judge a book by it's cover" ? So appropriate in this scenario because though the arrangement is minimal, yet the food is delicious. My friend and I visited this place last night for some quick bite and ended up ordering three dishes-equally good. A special mention to their dimsums, which is oh so yummy! Very few places in Calcutta serve dimsums at such inexpensive price as far as my knowledge goes. Over all a great experience.

We were looking for a new restaurant in the vicinity of Gariahat, and Zomato was prompt in bringing this up. It is located near the Desapriya Park crossing on Sarat Bose Road, and near other well known restaurants like The Wall. But, this new kid on the block is coming up fast! 
At first glance, it might strike as a little short of space, but what it lacked in space, it more than made up through the courteous behaviour of the staff. 
As for the food, we ordered Overdose Special Chicken which was simply awesome! Then for the main course, we had Schezwan Chicken Fried Rice and Devil's Chicken to go with it. Both items were delicious, and the quantity was good enough for two.
The total bill was Rs. 480 so it was really very reasonable. And, before we left, as a special offer from the owner himself,we were given a special discount coupon for our next visit. We would surely like to visit this place again. And all the best to the new venture!

This restaurant truly justifies it's name. Overdoses you with amazing food ( having the right balance of spices and the quantity that is served, also they serve their signature dishes which are not just delicious but pocketfriendly too!) and great ambience, which you just can't get enough of. And it all starts with a warm welcome by a very polite and friendly owner. The momos and the dimsums are to die for ! The dimsums are served with a special thing called suimai (which was very new for me) and it complements the taste of the dimsums so well! Even the main course meal was so filling and tasty! I would definitely recommend my friends to give this place a visit. 😁

The plan was to actually visit a really popular café in the Deshopriyo Park area but on our way there, we spotted this newly opened joined and decided to pay a visit. It's a small, intimate place with enough space for around 8 people but thankfully it was empty when I visited it this afternoon. The decor is quite nice, with exposed brick walls, giving the place a unique charm . 
Coming to the food, we tried the chicken dumplings, the mixed Hakka noodles and the oversize special chicken. All the dishes were very well prepared and the quantity was more than enough to be shared between 2-3 people. The prices were also pocket friendly, with the total amount coming to around Rs 455. Looking forward to visiting again :)
