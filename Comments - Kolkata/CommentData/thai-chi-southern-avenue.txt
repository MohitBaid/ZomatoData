A quaint little take away place tucked in one of lanes near triangular park, but a must try place. Very close to my office, i once ordered their meifoon, sweet n sour chicken, manchurian and hot garlic chicken. All of them were lipsmackingly amazing and makes it a must try. The only draw back is, its a take away place and they start a bit late but the food, taste, quality and price wise is amazing.

A very good roadside eatery especially for bikers and goers who are willing for fast bite.. Arrived at 10pm sunday so momo was not available tried schezwan fish and pepper chicken was excellent and spicy. Took pork fried for home was again tasty.. So overall it a good place to have a fast munch. They serve fish, chicken and pork..

Horrible .nothing can be more pathetic than this.firstly ordered for veg schezwan noodles.they prepared and packed and when I asked for another dish came to know they did not have schezwan sauce.How the hall did they make schezwan noodles then.tasted it .it was horrible .the noodles were over cooked and vegetables were raw. There was no taste totally blank. the person sitting on desk was a jargon buster .according to him khowswey and Thai curry are same.First time heard schezwan noodles without schezwan sauce. Waste of money.threw all the food.

I stay very close to this joint and walked in and ordered food for home delivery. I ordered Veg Hakka Chowmein with Gravy Mushroom and Babycorn. I also ordered Veg Thai Curry with steam rice. 
The mushroom dish was very good. I would rate it at 4.5/5.0. The Hakka Chow was good but a bit too oily. The quantity of Hakka Chow was pathetic and the gravy mushroom dish was good. Hence we ended up short on Hakka Chow. The same with Thai Curry. The quantity of rice was frugal while the curry was in excess once we finished the rice. The taste of Thai Curry was far far too sweet for it to be anywhere close to authentic. 
Thumbs up for the price line and the staff behavior was very very nice and polite. 
They would do well if they look into the quantity angle and serve at par with the competition and use spices which are authentic for a particular cuisine.
