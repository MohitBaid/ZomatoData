Hatari is surely one of the best Chinese restaurants in town. It‚Äôs 5 mins away from Lake Mall. I‚Äôve been there a number of times and never got disappointed. The food is hygienic and always delicious. One must try the pork and the lamb here. The service is also great. The prices may be a bit on the higher side but is totally worth it. The ambience is very comfortable. The place is dimly lit. The place is always crowded. Like on weekends a long queue of 50 people outside the restaurant door is common. And even on weekdays sometimes there are some people waiting. So be prepared to wait or visit a bit early. But this place is surely a must visit for all the Chinese cuisine lovers. üòä

You sure must have heard about this restaurant considering the number of branches they have all over the city and it has a pretty good name among foodies as well. I have been here thrice and each time it sure has been a pretty delightful experience. The place is around 5-6mins from Lake Mall. The last time I was there I had tried the chicken hot and sour soup, the pan fried chilly fish, chicken fried rice and red chilly chicken. Generally, you might find the pieces a little more than normal but then they also provide with adequate quantity. The service at least at this branch is pretty great. The ambience of the restaurant is comfortable, dimly lit and absolutely fine for family visits. The food here is great. Definitely a place you'd like to visit.

I have grown up to 23 eating Chinese courses from here. Very courteous staff. Quantity and quality of the food is too good and please keep it up in the coming years. Good wishes for the team.
Every items is good. Had tasted so many dishes from Hatari till now so could not name one or two. :)

Bening a typical combo I am ‚Äì a quintessential Bengali without living in Kolkata‚Äîthe Kolkata food scene is always very much surprising to me. In most of the famous restaurants I had visited in Kolkata, I got disappointed. Probably hopes were high, dishes were not. I understand that people attach a lot of sentimental value to the places they are going since long, and that‚Äôs totally acceptable.

During my visit to Kolkata in August, 2017, I was in Gariahat area one evening for some work. After the work got finished, began searching in Zomato about some good places to eat, and decided to go to Hatari. And I must say, this place, unlike others, did not disappoint me inspite of having high expectations.

We (I and my wife) reached Hatari at around 7:45 PM. It was bit early, but the restaurant was almost full. We were seated in one of the two empty tables. Soon, the other table also got filled up; and when we were coming out after dinner at around 8:30 PM, saw a queue of at least 40-50 people!!! My gosh, this place IS popular!!

We ordered chilly pork as starter, and mixed gravy chowmein and Mongolian chicken as main courses. Portion sizes of all dishes were more than adequate for two people. Chilly pork and mixed gravy chowmein were really excellent in taste, Mongolian chicken was good too. Portions sizes were so huge that we could finish off just 60% of food only.

Overall, a great place for Chinese, and very VFM too. The long queue outside was probably a testimony to that.

First, they'll make you wait outside in a long queue. It will make you hungrier or hangrier. But once you're inside and has been guided to your seat, it's just a matter of minutes since the time you order till the food appears on your table. In other words, they have the quickest service.

Food quality and quantity, both are stupendofantabulously fantastical.

Hatari , we all know is vintage and lives up to its reputation of great food and legacy. Been there 4-5 times. Food quality and service has been always good. 

Had tried Mughlai as well as Chinese there - both has been pretty good. Last time we went there, we had Mutton Biriyani and a chicken disk. Some of us tried Chinese - chicken fried and Thai chicken with cashew along with Chilli chicken and chilli fish. It was very pretty quick and ambience was fine too.

Overall, a good experience.

I had mutton biriyani which was good but the mutton wasn't very soft but overall it was good. The rice was perfectly cooked with a great balance of flavours.
The steamed chicken momo was excellent. The filling was delicious. And the complementary soup was very basic yet delicious and fulfilling.
The chicken hakka noodles was also very good. Bang on with authentic flavours.
The chilli garlic chicken was a bit below my expectations, could have been definitely better. It wasn't spicy as was told to us.
Overall the ambience was good but was not going with the weird edm going in the background.
The service given by the staff was quite good.

Hatari is nostalgia and taste served to you with care and love. We opted for dim sums, fish and chips, chicken fried rice and fish mandarin. Though the dough in the dim sum felt a bit thick and bland, the other dishes were top notch. The chocolate brownie with ice cream as a dessert was a pleasant add on as well. Will definitely be visiting this place again, very soon.

Their Staffs are very well behaved,polite and courteous. We ordered Fresh Lime Soda, Mongolian Chicken Dry and Panfried Chilli Fish for starters. Well Mongolian Chicken is very spicy if you are a spicy food lover you can go for it!. And PanFried Chilli Fish is amazing just andd  its not spicy !. Then as their quantity is huge so we were almost full .. in main course we ordered Singapore EggChicken Noodless (hakka) and Shanghai Chicken. Both were awesome but  Shanghai Chicken was extremely good I loved it!!!.

Opposite to Triangular Park,¬† this is a heritage place to have Chinese in southern Kolkata at a very descent price.¬† Previously always found people waiting in queues here, such was the craze . And the craze is still there!!!

I went again on Saturday evening with my friend.¬† The decors have changed a lot over time. Its quite spacious for big groups.

Coming to the food, I always come here to have signature Chinese¬† (dont prefer Indian food here, wont recommend ). Ordered red pepper chicken,¬† egg chicken fried rice and sanghai chicken.
The quantity is superb here! Red pepper chicken was moderate spicy with lots of pepper nd spring onion.¬† Fried rice had sufficient ingredients and the sanghai chicken was done with bell peppers , but it was a bit less spicy than it should be.

Staff is courteous.¬†
Definitely recommended for Chinese,¬† price has been raised moderately though.

This is one of those few restaurants which is well recognised by almost everyone in the city of joy and everyone has heard positive reviews about. Even if one has not visited personally, he/she is surely to have heard of it. This is a place which goes back many years and has stood the test of changing tastes by ticking all the right boxes.... good service, decent decor and the thing that matters the most, excellent food. This place is known for its Chinese dishes which I am personally very fond of. Simpy love the wantons and crispy chickens. It is difficult for me to pinpoint one or two dishes as everything in their Chinese menu is better than the other in a way. I have tried a few other cuisines once, which were decent, but the showstopper remains the Chinese. The flavours are just right, the portions are large. Just remember to keep some buffer time when you visit as the place is usually always packed. Highly recommended

What would i say about Hatari.. The gariahat outlet have become our family restaurant now, whenever any relatives visit to kolkata we take them to Hatari, have celebrated our anniversary there, tired of shopping we all flocked to hatari anytime and everytime. "Best Quality Food with Good Quantity" is the key which tied us with this restaurant and such homely ambience, polite waiters sophisticated attire are also the keys. Few must try dishes are:

Chicken fried rice
Chilli garlic duck
Barbque pork chops
Chicken Nurani sheekh kebab
Fish kebab
Prawn tempura,
And many more i wouldn't recommend to have the mughlai dishes here..

Waited for 2 hours for a seat for 11 people. Every time we asked how much longer it would take, we were told "Just a few minutes more". After waiting for 2 hours and seeing the whole queue of people going inside except us, we called the manager. After endless arguments, we were asked to be seated at a table for 10, in spite of repeatedly telling them that there were 11 of us. Later, the waiter told us to "adjust", as if 2 hours of waiting was not adjustment enough. Giving the dismal rating just for the irresponsible attitude of the management.

Hatari, a restaurant, belonging to an era when eating out was more than just having good food. The head of the family ( the big fat bengali joint family off course) used to decide the place even after much discussion and crazy inputs from youngsters and the women. Much before the red letter day arrived, boudis and kakimas would invest a lot of time from their 'bhatghum' hours to pick the best saris and even jewellery for the occasion! It was indeed a gala time for the family.
Now, Hatari inevitably was synonymous with good food and great ambience for the family. This wonderful culinary destination with mouthwatering delicacies and friendly staff has been able to withstand fierce competition from new culinary players in the area and make an unenviable reputation for itself!

Renowned as this place is, it is one my favorites too. Luckily one of my friends who has been going to Hatari since probably his previous life üòÇ , took me there and I can't thank him enough for this. Also I tried pork meat for the first time here and I loved it. I've been there twice since then. The first time we ordered-

1. Fish Irani kebab- It is one of the best fish kebabs I've ever had, anywhere. The fish just melts in your mouth and with that smoky flavor, it's just spot on!

2. Mixed fried rice- One thing about Hatari is the quantity of food they serve. One bowl of it is enough to fill two people! The taste was also good.

3. Szechuan pork- Again the quantity was more than what two people together can finish and I absolutely loved it. The pork had perfect amount of meat and fat. The gravy however was a bit spicy and pungent for my palate.

After these we hardly had any room for dessert üòÖ

The second time we went there during the pujas but then they were only serving from a set menu and we ordered-

1. Dry chilli pork- This one is highly recommended and I liked it more than the Szechuan pork. The meat was cooked to perfection and with the fried chillies it was just perfect.

2. Singapore noodles- It was yummy too but the taste could have been a bit more authentic. I guess the puja rush affected the quality a bit.

They weren't serving desserts during the pujas. Also we had to stand in a que and wait for a long time after placing the order and before they finally served us.

A 4.5/5 for the food.
It's a must visit for all Chinese food lovers.

The staff is really well behaved and helpful and deserve a 4/5

As for the ambience I'll give a 4/5

Went there after a long time. We used to be regulars here. I must admit the look has drastically changed towards betterment of course. But Hatari's plus point was the amazingly tasty food against a very reasonable price point. None of that exists anymore. The price is at par with any medium level restaurant and the food....what has happened to it? We ordered Fish fry as starter and it was good. Then came our mutton kasha, the masala was half cooked with no taste whatsoever, when complained the waiter promptly changed it to mutton roganjosh. Equally bad tasted like an amateurish cook which strongly tasted and smelled of turmeric. Was highly disappointed. Will not be going there for a while.

The Fish Chilli and Pepper is an absolute miracle. With Nasi Goreng and Mixed Hunan Rice, the aforementioned dishes felt like heaven on a platter.  Their lamb is pretty amazing too. And it's quite easy on the pockets as the quantity is HUUUUGE!!! Pay a visit, you won't be disappointed!

I'll keep my review short . This time when I went to hatari I tried their "Chicken Fried Wantons" and "Konjee Crispy Lamb" from their Oriental menu and "Mandarin Noodles" from their regular menu. The wantons and lamb were pretty good . I'll rate them a 5/5 . The mandarin noodles were so so . It seemed like mix of a chopsuey and soya sauce based pan fried noodles, a bit too tangy for my taste. Other than that I love the food this restaurant offers and will keep visiting.

Rated 4 because of the food was awesome. Waited 40 minutes for mixed non-veg soup and crispy veg. But before finishing the soup, the mixed non-veg noodles came. Service was extremely slow. I almost felt asleep.

With good ambience and friendly staff, this is the place to fulfill your all Mughlai craving. They have their menu with Mughlai and Chinese cuisine lined up.  Really satisfied with the service. I would recommend to have the special biriyani first.

One of the best and authentic restaurants in Kolkata serving nice Chinese delicacies located in the heart of South Kolkata. Apart from the long queue that leads you upstairs to the second floor , Hatari marvels in it's way. The American Choupsuey , Chilli Pork , Schezwan Rice ..... Oh hell with review ! I am leaving for Hatari right now :).

Been here after a long time. After getting a table we saw it was not tide enough. We ordered Hot and Sour Soup, Chicken Prawn Fried Rice and Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce. We were waiting so long for the food and got our plates after repeatedly telling them. Food was good in quality and quantity. Decor is so simple and not lucrative..and little dusty.

Spacious. Ambiance is good. Though remains crowded most of the time which is a good thing.
We had Nasi Goreng and Gansu lamb.
Definitely tasted different.
The lamb was tender.
Quantity of servings was a bit too generous for the two of us.

As such I have only tasted the north indian part of it.  So I won't be able to comment on the rest.  Well,  to be very honest Hatari provides proper Northy recipes at reasonable price. Go and try

The old fave. But ... getting on in age. The fooƒès as good as always. Noisy, crowded, cramped. The washrooms are weary. Far from the best in service with one or two exceptions. Flies on plates, and otherwise buzzing around. Personally, I regret its descent into a plain, no frills eatery. I think that's a lost opportunity.

Well this place is among the oldest gems in our city of Joy.i had been waiting for a long time till i finally got an opportunity to dine out at this place with some close people.This place is located just opposite triangular park right on RB connector.The food was mindblowing.For starters we had kebabs from a specific kebab menu named Kebabeyana!!.we tried a new item The murgh Shola kebab along with the classic Gosh Galouti kebab.The Murgh Shola kebab was different yet awsome and really made us look forward to a great meal ahead.The blend of spices in the kebabs were perfect and the size of chicken pieces was much more than average..The Galauti kebab was chicken cutlet shaped and each bite initially giving a spicy taste in our tastebuds finally gave into a mesmerising mouthful..we were very happy with the kebabs.For our main course we had Chicken prawn hakka chowmein along with Mongolian fish and Manchurian chicken...The chowmein was top notch with the right amount of oil and being garnished with appropriate amounts of veggies..The quantity of the side dishes was very impressive...The Mongolian fish is a nonspicy boneless fish delicacy which felt very elegant to taste while the manchurian chicken was spicy and majestic in its own long known flavour..both the side dishes gelled well with the noodles and we were full to the brim after having our main course.we had Fresh Lime Soda for a cooler with our meal.The staff is helpful and courteous.since this is among the most happening diners across the neighbourhood this place is nearly full always and so there is the noise of chitchat and crockery clatters all around you but if you are lucky enough then you might get the quiet corner as well.The price is reasonable and i would happily say that Hatari is excellent choice for some great dinner with family and friends...

Chicken in red wine----this dish was sweet in taste..nothing extraordinary.. Just okk
Chilli pork-----now it was the disappointing moment for us....it was bad in taste...simply bad...
Lamb in oyster sauce-----1st i tried this dish...and it was very nice....

So overall i have a huge expectation about hatari...but they disappointed me a little bit...

Have been to this place multiple numbers of times. They have always mesmerized me with their chinese cuisine (maintaining their standards even during the puja times, when one really doesn't expect it to be that way) and also the quantity that they provide.

Went there after a long long time. To be honest, lots of things have changed. And so did my impression about this place.

First of all, about the ambience. It was a hell of a wrong timing. They were probably going through a renovation or something (atleast i would like to think that. Even though I don't know if it's all that they provide now). So the ambience was horrible. There was dust all over the tables. It was a nightmare, believe me.

The food really didn't pack a punch. It lacked the lustre much like the ambience itself. But yes, having said that, quantity wise a thumbs up!!! They nailed it, as always.

Hatari didn't really impress me much like before. With number of new restaurants springing up, providing quality dining experience in all sectors, i really think they need to up their game, if they at all want to maintain their well earned reputation over all these years.

Hatari is considered as one of the best places to have good food in deshapriya park area.. which is absolutely true.. 
Ambience- nothing special as such
Staff- here I found it needs to be improved.. they aren't polite and must b more efficient
Quantity- satisfying
Quality- we ordered
Chicken tikka kabab- perfect smoked tender chicken pieces with ryt amt of spices
Butter naan- needs to b more soft
Chicken tawa masala- not upto the mark.. it was full of fried onions paste
Matar paneer- excellent.. soft paneer and ymmy gravy
Chicken biriyani- mouth watering.. the chicken wasn't at all dry and the alu was creamy.. 
In short it was a good experience

When you think of delicious Chinese food there is no other place which can beat Hatari. The most family friendly restaurant with awesome food at awesome prices. Every dish we had this Sunday afternoon was so yummy that we all are hungry for more. We ordered 3 dishes for starters - the trademark chicken drumsticks (which is a must have every time we visit), fish Chilli and pepper (which was heavenly) and Keongs chicken. Keongs chicken was an unusual dish we ordered but it was worth the try. For main course we ordered 2 plates of burnt garlic coriander rice. I don't know why but the fried rice tastes best in Hatari. For main course we ordered That Pan Kai and Tsing Hoi chicken. The former is a black gravy with oyster sauce and Tsing Hoi was a better version of sweet N sour chicken. I'm so glad we ordered these two since we could taste both spicy N sweet gravy. Must say Tsing Hoi is not like sweet N sour exactly. It is mildly spicy N slightly sweet, so these were awesome. My kid doesn't eat a thing at restaurants and so we ordered a single sundae. This was a surprise since it had 1 scoop each of vanilla, strawberry N chocolate ice cream with dry fruits. It was a delight for kids! Truly happy and we are coming back for more :)

This place is located right besides Bharat Optics Store in Gariahat. 
I have been to this restaurant a couple of times and they haven‚Äôt disappointed even once. 
Today I visited this place again and noticed some changes. The ceiling of this place has changed and the wallpapers of the wall. They have renovated the place before the pujas I guess.
The quality of the food hasn‚Äôt dropped since the last time I visited this place. 
Today we ordered Canton chicken, Kabab, chicken noodle soup, chicken Asparagus soup, chicken prawn fried rice and fish finger. 
Each and every item was delicious. 
Just the service was a little slow this time. But the staffs are very co-operative.

If you want a family lunch or dinner but do not want to spend loads, this should be your go-to place. The ambience is serene, with soft music adding to the atmosphere. It doesn't matter if you're a Mughlai or Chinese person, both are equally good here. 
The American Chopsuey, mixed rice noodles, mixed hakka noodles, chilli pork, lamb with mushroom, brown glazed duck is a must try.

My experience to Hatari has been splendid for the first time . This was my very first visit to this much talked about restaurant.
The first and foremost important aspect of any restaurant is it's Food hence I will first talk about that. Three of us had gone there and we ordered 2 plates of Chicken Fried Rice and 1 plate of Sweet and Sour Chilly Chicken . The taste of the rice was as per my liking . It was wonderful and didn't have a lot of oil in it so that's a plus ! The sweet and Sour chicken was taste wise more on the sweeter side . I felt like they could made it better to balance out both the flavours . However it was a good dish overall . The quantity od the food was a lot as per the price . We couldn't finish our food and had to get them parcelled. A big thumbs up to the food there!
The ambience of the place is very soothing and relaxing . A great place to spend some time with family . Loved the seating arrangement .!
The staff were very courteous and the service time was quite fast . We didn't have to wait long for our order to arrive .

As a conclusion, I would recommend people to go there if they haven't and I myself would be going back there again ! üòä

Don't know why this we got bad experience. Only Crispy chilli mashroom was good. Others are so pathetic. I hade been there even before. Experience was quite good. But after a long tym we went there and ordered few things like Chef speial's Hakka , Mongolian Fish... Those were ot like to eat at all. Hakka was too bland,couldn't find any speciality and Fish was not li'l sweet it was too sweet. Became hust like a dessert. And finally when it was the sweet time brownie was stiff.... I had not expect this from Hatari. We are spending money for some good food. Not to be disheartened. Very Sorry.

Hatari staff should know a pseudo marketing team of Hatari exists, & that's my family headed by me, as their marketing head.
This is truly a Legendary Restaurant, running their business absolutely on their own terms over several years. It has created its own brand for every single dish. I cannot post pictures, since Hatari has almost been my weekly delight for last 6 years. Among all the dishes what remains my favourite of favourites is: Thai Soup, Crispy Prawn Balls, Prawn Shanghai Fried Rice (available if ordered), Lamb with green pepper red chilli, Shredded Oyster Fish. The only disturbing thing about Hatari is its craze. For all the Hataris, whether it is a take away counter like Golf Green or the Lavish Restaurant like in Triangular Park, waiting in cues is an inherent feature and quite an usual sight outside the restaurant. But one must be ready for the most worthy wait in anticipation of something special coming next.

If you are planning for pork or lamb its the perfect outlet to hangout! But it's a bit costly. It will be a loss of budget if you go there alone! I'll recommend atleast 3 to 4 people to go which would cost within 1250 rupees in total!

Tried Lamb and fish items. Particularly, Fish finger, crispy fish, schezwan Lamb with mixed fried rice. ¬†Had a nice dinner and they served really good even during heavy pressure of Durgapuja. Will come again.

I have visited this particular branch of Hatari quite a few number of times and my last visit was on Durga Puja this year, on Shashthi. We had expected a long queue outside but had no idea that we had to wait for two whole hours to finally get a table!! The person seated downstairs did not give us any estimated waiting time. But thankfully, service inside the restaurant was pretty quick and the food arrived on our tables within ten minutes of placing the order. We ordered two Butter Naans, one Egg Fried Rice, one Chilli Paneer and one Green Chilli Chicken. The food was enough for four of us. Coming to the taste, the rice was good, the Chilli Paneer was also very good. The Green Chilli Chicken tasted very much like usual Chilli chicken except that the gravy was slightly sour. But I would prefer normal Chilli chicken over this any day. One of the two butter naans however was burnt and the other one was hard to tear. Overall the bill came to be Rs 909 including GST which was pretty reasonable for four people.What however struck me the most was that only half of us had finished our food when they were repeatedly telling us to pay the bill,, as if they were not concerned about anything else but only the money. Such kind of behaviour was really not expected from a reputed place like Hatari.

Service Quality - Good

Food - Excellent

It is one of the best restaurant we have in City of Joy. Apart from above points this is one of the few restaurant who maintain their quality even during Durga Puja festival.

I had gone there during puja time so foods, arrangement was a little messy. Staff to whom we gave order was so much full of attitude, not friendly!!

Coming to the food items
We ordered Pan fried chilly fish which was crispy and sweet n sour in taste!! Butter Nun was good, and with that we took chicken tawa masala, that tastes good but was a little bit sweet, which I didn't like as I prefer spicy items!. Anyways.. my friends ordered kadhai paneer that was a flop choice as the paneer used was rubbery!

We had a visit this place on 25th September, we had to wait for around 30min. At 11pm finally we went to tables.
We had Pan fried chilli fish, Mix fried rice, kadhai paneer, chicken tawa masala and Nun. Except kadhai paneer all disher are good to taste. I personally feel that kadhai paneer was made of apsara non dust rubber, a disgusting dish I had ever eat.

The place where I am going since childhood and everytime it satisfies me to the fullest be it the decor the food the taste or the quality, every bit of it is amazing.
But it is slight costly for students but if you're with your family then it's a the perfect place to have a lavish dinner.

Service: 4/5
The service i would say was pretty good here. Our order got served within 15 minutes. The staff was courteous.

Food: 4/5
Singapore Noodles: Went well with thr spicy tomato chutney kept on the table. 
Paneer Do Pyaza: Had it along with tandooti roti and it tasted nice. I liked the preparation and presentation as well.

A nice place for variety and value for money üí∞ restaurant. Went with a friend and tried fried rice and sweet & sour fish üéè quite nice and a the quantity is quite descent. One plate can serve 2 people. The con is that the space is very less. Management can think of changing the decor and accomodation space so that more people can be accommodated. The decor has been there for a long time. Change is required.

Have been visiting here since my childhood. Undoubtedly the best chinese food cuisine. Even after moving out of Kolkata whenever i coms i never fail to visit the restaurant atleast once
The dishes i love over here are mushroom manchurian, crispy chilly babycorn, hot and sour soup and fried rice. Their non veg counterparts are equally tasty (reviewed by those who eat non veg)

.but so worth it..the service is just awsome
.we ordered manchan soup which was delicious

And mixed fried rice and lamb was just enough for 3 ppl..infact we were quite full aftr the food was over

It is not only good in terms of quality but also best in terms of quantity.. No other resturant in kolkata serves so much food, of such high quality..

I visited this place first when smartphone was yet to be invented and henceforth I became a frequent visitor to this place
the place is nicely tucked on the main road of rashbehari avenue opposite to triangular park. The moment I hear of hatari the one thing that strikes me immediately is the portion of food.. their quantity is Mammoth .. the food tastes good.. some of my recommendation would be chilly pork, nasi goreng, hakka noodles, green chili chicken, hot garlic chicken, crispy fried chicken, sweet corn soup

A sudden plan which turns really amazing. So me and my friend were out for shopping when he suggested this place. We tried just two things: 

Thai Soup: A little tangy with crab meat, prawns and mushrooms. This soup is not like the regular soups. And the quantity is too filling.

Mongolian Prawns: Spicy batter fried prawns with Cajun sauce, bell peppers and cashews, it was a nice prawn dish. 

I was really overwhelmed with the quantity. We were really hungry but we became nearly full. The staff was courteous. And the service was good. If around and if you love Chinese, make sure you visit here.

Hatari is a household name among Calcuttans,serving them for a long time now. The main branch,which is opposite Triangular Park,is spacious and able to provide comfortable seating arrangement.
Despite the large capacity,it sometimes becomes difficult to get a table even on weekdays,let alone on weekends or holidays,when the serpentine queue of customers waiting reaches till the streets downstairs!
Hatari is known for the unique taste they have created in their dishes,especially those belonging to the Chinese Cuisine. They have a wide variety of side dishes to choose from,with the Chicken coming in both boneless chunks or shredded pieces.
My favourites here are the Chicken in white oyster sauce and the Canton Chicken. I've always started off my meal here with a plate of Crispy Chilli Babycorn,which might be too spicy for your liking if you don't specify from before. 
There's no denying that their prices are on the higher side,but they do provide a large quantity for it.
Two plates of fried rice/noodles can be overbearing for three people.

Most of the staff are courteous and service is decent.

This is our all time favourite dine in place with friends and family. I have simply lost the count to how many times I have been here. It serves chinese as well as Indian cuisine and both of them tastes equally good. My personal favourites are the pan fried fish,crispy pepper chicken and Mongolian chicken. The Triangular park branch has been here for more than 15years serving their best. I love the quantity as well as the quality of food that they offer. So never doubt when you plan to barge into Hatari. Happy eating !!

This restaurant located in the Triangular park area is well known for their chinese delicacies. We are fond of their dishes and since childhood days we are having frequent family gathering in this restaurant. Their frequently ordered dishes are Pan fried chilly fish,crispy chicken, mongolian chicken as starters and mixed fried rice, hakka noodles with canton chicken , chicken in hot garlic sauce etc. Special mention for mongolian chicken dry- 10pieces of chicken prepared in a red sauce with diced capsicum and roasted cashew nuts. Very tasty and has a unique flavour. In mains we frequently order Canton chicken- shredded chicken prepared in a black sauce and also there are veggies like mushrooms, unique in taste. Though the price is not so pocket friendly but they serve huge quantity. Each dish will suffice three people..so guys visit this place in multiples of three if you are a average eater.

Probably the best Hatari outlets in kolkata. I love this place for its food. But its a bit congested. Tables are placed almost on top of each other and hampers ur privacy. Staff behavior is satisfactory. Quantity served is huge. Sometimes its difficult to finish a bowl of noodle and side dish by two people if u had anything for starter.

The prices are very affordable and the service is quite good..
U can have chicken lollipop for starters..
For main course u can have mixed fried rice with chilli pork..
The quantity is just too good..
Must visit for all the foodies out there.
For the quality and quantity a lot of people actually go out there..so i would suggest you to go a bit early..or u have to wait in line..

One of the best legendary restaurants of South Kolkata, Hatari, known for its Authentic Chinese dishes. Located exactly in the main road at Triangular Park between Gariahat and Rashbehari Avenue.
Today after shopping for long time went there for lunch.The entrance way is quite shabby and clumsy but the moment you enter the restaurant you will get the top notch feeling.
Now coming to the food, all the items we ordered were yummy and mouth Watering. We ordered Crunchy Fried Chilli chicken for Starters. Small pieces of chicken fried well to give a crunchy feeling. Tasted awesome. In the main course we ordered Wok Seared Chicken and Black Mushroom Fried Rice and Chilli Fish. Both of them were extremely tasty and more then enough in quantity for two people.
Overall a great experience and highly recommended for anyone looking for good Chinese food.

It was just another day when we felt very hungry while crossing Rashbehari Avenue. So we decided to stop by some restaurant. Hatari happens to be a very traditional restaurant but believe me guys this was my first visit there. It was afternoon, the restaurant has just opened, man be an hour ago, and half of the restaurant was full with family lunch. We took a side table and ordered Tangy Crispy chicken and a blue lagoon. The ambience of the restaurant is okay with decent amount of luminescence. The chicken was Crispy no doubt and enjoyed a lot. For the main course I ordered mutton biryani and my friend ordered masala kulcha. She is very fond of fish so we ordered Fish do-piaza as a side dish. Quantity was very decent for fish do piazza and was enough for both of us. Kulcha was very good but taste wise fish do-piaza could have been better. Overall it was a happy time spent over lunch with satisfaction. @seheli reh

The Chicken was extremely good. Shredded pieces of chicken with the great tawa masala smell.
I am extremely happy with Hatari.

But it was ok. Their chicken fried rice was so good with lots of big chicken chunks. And their chilli pork was the showstopper. They served Big size juicy pork meat,well cooked and so tasty. And the pocket pinch was almost 800 bucks which I think is quite reasonable. So all total i loved this place and thank you abhi for this treat :) :)

One of the best Chinese restaurant near gariahat. The price is reasonable because the quality is really good actually it is sufficient for 2people. The ambiance is not so impressive! Chicken manchurian, i liked it.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. The entrance is not that catchy, one might find it difficult to spot at first. Once you enter the restaurant after climbing the flight of stairs and walking through the corridor, your mind will be blown away by the ambience and accommodating ability.
Coming to food, the quality is great, so is the service. The quality and quantity complement each other, making the price fairly reasonable. Highly recommended. Thank you

Have been visiting since 2007. Totally love this place.  Apart from the fact that one has tonwait in a long queue to a avail a table, everything about Hatari rocks. The location is it's plus point. I personally love the Chinese food here. We have tried prawn, fish, lamb and chicken dishes here. Love the Pan fried chilli fish and Chicken in oyster sauce.

One of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. Located in Triangular Park. a bit difficult to spot. And while entering, you may not feel upto it, but trust me as soon as you enter, you will be blown away! This place has almost a 5-star ambience, with great sitting. And the food is my favourite. You can try out the conventional North Indian cuisine or go out of the box with their Chinese dishes. Even the fried rice comes in so many unique tastes. I have been here so many times. This place is almost full during special occasions, but not so crowded during other times of the year. You can enjoy a huge variety of not-known-before dishes at a reasonable price. My favourites are the Mutton Handi (huge boneless pieces of mutton in gravy) and Schezwan Chicken, for sure. They also have huge tables for family gatherings and are also available for takeaway. This is my favourite place for a special lunch or dinner on a special day.

A legendary restaurant that runs primarily on it's heritage factor.

I visited it on a friday noon around 12 and the entrance itself disgusted me. Very old staircase that starts right from the gariahat footpath, the entrance is marked by two lamps at the entrance that are totally shrouded in spider web and instead of a carpet or a doormat theres a wet basta to wipe your shoes on. So we go up the stairs, old and not that well maintained, the building's condition is like that of a dilapidated third class hotel in the sealdah area. So then we finally enter the restaurant room which totally shocks me. The room is under repair. The walls are stripped to the bricks and the ceiling is a mesh of open hanging wires that used to be covered by a false ceiling. My point is, when you are under repair, you close the damned place, or open a temporary takeaway counter instead!

We were standing there all shocked when the waiter came and escorted us to another small room which was in fine condition. We ordered

Tangy crispy chicken=  the best among the dishes. The sauce was nice and sticky though the chicken could have been more fresh.
Mixed fried rice= okayish, a bit oily but not bad
Prawn in chilli sauce= well cleaned prawns in a terribly bland sauce which seemed to contain only thickened soya sauce.
 
Conclusion: Go to Park Street instead. Way better value for money.

Finally got a chance to visit Hatari after months of planning and countless disappointing cancellations. Had heard so much about this place that my expectations, naturally, were soaring high. Now when I visited, the place was mostly empty which is lucky considering it remains pretty crowded (atleast as many times I've tried to eat here before, prompting me to reconsider the venue). Now as far as the interior decoration goes, on close inspection the place gives off the vibe that (cue Jim Gordon voice) they did the best they could with what they had, which isn't really bad but then it's not glorious either. The lighting did wonders for the ambience though, however i feel the music playlist has room for improvement, but then that's a matter of taste i guess. The staff were very good and there is no scope for any discontentment there, they were very well mannered and helpful. Now coming to the food: I had ordered American Chop suey and dry chilli pork, the latter being listed as a specialty of this place. The chop suey was great and largely appreciated by everyone. However the dry chilli pork was a let down, being a bit too oily and a tad less spicy than expected. It was disappointing, coming from a place of this caliber and also being a dish being suggested on zomato. Overall it was a good experience and I'll expect the little points of dissatisfaction to be rectified by the time of my next visit.

Considering how far we travelled and how hungry I was when we reached here, the quick service pleased me.
üî∏Chicken lollipop 3.5/5 (6 pieces of fried chicken)
They weren't tossed in any gravy and was simply batter fried, a little different from how I like it but it tasted good.
üî∏Shezuan chicken fried rice and egg fried rice 5/5.
You don't even need gravy with it. Very appetising and amazing quantity (1 bowl enough for 2 people and a kid) .
üî∏Red chilly chicken (3/5) this is the only reason why I am rating a little low. It was tad sweet, which chilly chicken isn't supposed to be. But taste wise I liked it and quantity wise sufficient for 2.
Try crispy chicken and prawn items. The soups aren't that good though. 
Reach early or queue up.

The North Indian dishes are a little less spicier than they used to be. Also try out the tutti fruity icecream .Its a sensation!

A famous restaurant, one people have been visiting for years now. My first visit. Food is not amazing, it's sketchy. Quantity is ample though.

Seeing the number of people waiting, we ordered all the food together rather than going course by course.

Veg fried rice, Thai Noodles for the staple item. Side dishes were Crispy Chicken, Fish Manchurian and a pork dish, the name of which I can't remember. One plate of each for 4 of us, yet we couldn't finish all of it. The quantity was quite a bit, and given the price, it's value for money. Service is quick too.

This is personally my favourite chinese resturant. They offer both North Indian and Chinese food but this place is famous mainly for their chinese. The best thing is about this place us the huge quantity. The food is delicious and the staffs are very effecient and very friendly. If you order food for four people it will be more than enough for six. Everytime we order as less as we can still we have to make parcel. Price is very much affordable. Whether you are with family or with friends this place is great. But most of the time the seats are full so you may have to wait to get but the waiting is worthy for their food.

One of the few authentic Chinese restaurants in the city...and the 
Gariahat one is the best at it...you can find lamb dishes to chicken dishes also pork and duck dishes are available here...also one can get some good seafood...
Food quality is good and so is the portions...
My personal favorite would be Dry Chili Pork, Gansu lamb, crispy chicken, crispy golden prawn, Garlic noodles, brown glazed duck...for the sweet toothed don't miss hot brownie with ice cream...
The price of food is not that high given the quality and quantity they provide...
Though the restaurant has enough space, still it remains choc-a-bloc on weekends, holidays & festivals...so keep ample time in hand and appetite...

We visited this place today. As it's a Sunday we had to wait for almost an hour which was pretty boring.
Coming to the food, for starters we ordered Keong Chicken. It was light and different from usual Chinese starters. It tasted nice. For the main course we ordered Shrimp Corn Fried Rice and Lamb In Oyster Sauce. Fried rice was fine with lots of shrimps and generous amounts of corn. The lamb dish however was too fibrous and not at all tasty. I would never try lamb dish here again. I don't recommend this AT ALL. It kind of spoiled our entire mood. Finally we ordered hot brownie with ice cream as dessert. This was actually the best dish of the day and enough to cover up the sins of ordering lamb for main course. The bill was ‚Çπ1392 (GST @18% included).
Service was fine. It could have been faster though. Ambience is okay. There are quite a number of tables. This place is recommended but not on holidays especially if you are in a hurry.

Hatari! The one n only joint where i celebrate different occasions such as birthday valentine day friends' get2gather since 2007. This time for a treat by my friend on her bday. I always order a dish whenever i visit hatari named Chilly garlic chicken. My favourite. Also i ordered chilly pork, singapore noodles, chicken fried rice, red pepper fish. Quantity has been reduced than earlier. Red pepper is too spicy. Chilly pork n chilly garlic chicken are fav. Although a little bit of extra use of sauces made the dish tangy which i dont like. But hatari brings peace in mind. This time after a long gap of 1 year.

This is a legendary restaurant in South Kolkata. Ambience is charming and good although a bit noisy.
 
Service : Courteous and friendly staff. They know their menu well so you can ask for  suggestions. They r attentive too!!

Food : Simply lip-smacking!!
We opted for:-
Tandoori chicken and crispy chicken for starters. Both were good but special mention to the former one as it was humoungous in quantity and damn tasty. It was perfectly done...Juicy tender chicken with right amount of spices.
Mains : We ordered egg hakka noodles and egg rice. For sides we took chilli Chicken and Shanghai chicken. All of them were equally good for indo- Chinese taste buds. Prices r a bit on the higher side but considering the quantity its totally worth it. We washed it down with lemonade which was good with ample amount of sweetness. Enjoyed the evening with family.
Highly recommendable...Happy eating!!

5 minute walk from Priya Cinema, restaurant Hatari situated on the second floor which has a very good balcony view of the place. We had Mongolian chickn, Mixed fried rice,Mixed chowmein gravy,Sweet and sour chilli chickn,Schezwan fish and a mango juice. The schezwan fish was the best of all the dishes. The waiters were very attending. The price is a bit steeper. Definitely will be known for its chinese dishes.

Wonderful pocket friendly restaurant! We took Mongolian Chicken as starter, Schezuan noodles, Red sauce chicken and Shanghai Chicken for the main course. The two chicken dishes were extraordinarily good. They were a bit on the spicier end, but there are plenty of other options to choose from. Ambience is on the poorer side. However, quick delivery makes up for it a little. Do end with a masala thumbs-up!!

My friend and me visited this resturant for lunch one afternoon. Easy to locate. Just on the main road from Rashbehari to Gariahat. Its a nice place. The decor is old but nice. Coming to the food. The USP of this resturant is the quantity. The quality mathes up with the same. We ordered a crispy chilly baby corn,a mixed fried rice and a chicken in red wine. All three were really good. The quantity of one plate is more than enough for 2 people. The bill was fair- Rs1006!
Would recommend to friends and relatives.

This place is located near triangular park, gariahat. It is an age old food joint and still running successfully. I ordered:
1. chili and pepper fish- as the name suggests it was hot as hell!! 10 succulent pieces of fish cubes in a very hot sauce. Loved it.
2. Chicken and prawn fried rice- this fried rice is one of my favourites! the quality of the rice they used was really commendable. White rice with some veggies, with chicken, prawn and eggs. Aaaaaaahhh!! Heaven!!
3. chicken manchurian- soft, tender, slightly battered chicken pieces in a delicious gravy. Loved it as well. 
This place is a well known place for their food in south kolkata. They really make amazing foods and serve them in a big quantity. This place is slightly expensive. But when it comes to the quality and the quantitty of food then the price factor can be justified. The stuffs are very attentive and they pour the glass of water as soon as it gets empty. They serve promptly. Highly recommended.

The pan-fried prawns, just wow. Fish chilly and pepper, oriental starter at its best. Singapore rice noodles was so light and yet so flavorful. Fish in chilly oyster basil sauce, a bit salty just like it should be with oyster sauce dishes. 
Awesome place to have your special meal with your family. Just the perfect ambience and services.

Hatari, named after a Hollywood hit in mid sixties is one of the oldest in south Kolkata. Zomato has rightly said it is legendary as far as quantity and quick service is concerned. I visited this eatery on a Sunday (26.03.2017). After standing in the pretty long queue for at least for half an hour we entered  in hatari. Pretty noisy outlet. Ambience is like old Kolkata Chinese restaurant. Waiters are talking with themselves "who will catch up which train to go home". Coming to food. I beg pardon of all...I have much more delicious Chinese experience rather in contemporary ones.

The chowmein at Hatari is the way I like my noodles to be ‚Äì of the right thickness, and a delightful balance of all ingredients. The portions are also substantial, which makes it the ‚Äògo-to place‚Äô for big groups, especially in South Kolkata.

Went there last week. The guy who manages the queue is the stupidest guy on earth. There is no ticketing system and while enquiring how long you need to wait , the only answer you get is : VERY LONG. Had to leave  the resturant without dinner since the  gatekeeper skipped our name and still kept us waiting for 1 hr.  

VERDICT : Unless they fire that man and introduce a standard queue handling mechanism using numbers,  avoid Hatari Gariahat.

Nice cosy ambience. Comfortable seating. 
For starters we had the crispy congee lamb which was spicy crispy and oooh so delicious and by far the best of the three dishes we had.

For main course we had the schezwan Hakka noodles which was average, had a raw turmeric taste to it and a grainy floury texture. The dry chilli chicken was good but I have had better.

But overall nice experience and I would definitely comeback for more.

"Hatari" or as people say "The Legendary" restaurant.. yes it's rightly said.. standing tall since ages in the heart of kolkata shoppers "The Gariahat" .. Serving delicious foods and quenching the hunger of food souls like me... well this place was in my wishlist for a long time but Cud not visit each time due to some reasons.. sometimes a long que... sometimes cancellation of plans.. etc.. but finally happened to visit this place on 24.05.2017 after watching a movie...

As we entered the guard asked for the number of heads.. and as usual we were told to wait till a table for 6 is vacant.. (It was irritating for me as I was damn hungry) 

Finally We were called and given a seat.. The decor was nice.. but the ac was a bit less chilling... In spite of being a weekday it was still crowded... 

We ordered special mutton biriyani.. single mutton biriyani.. mixed Fried rice... chicken tikka masala.. garlic chicken and blue lagoon mocktail..

Te quality of food was top notch.. The quantity was huge.. One mixed rice is enough for 2 adults and a child.. A lot of prawns and chicken.. and the taste was heavenly.. The authentic dish..

The biriyani was lipsmacking.. The aroma..The quantity.. ahhh it will simply drive you crazy.. Two pieces of mutton.. An egg.. and a big sized aloo..

The show stopper was the tikka masala.. soft and juicy chicken pieces in a thick rich gravy... 

The garlic chicken was also good... 
Overall a great experience.. The service was also good..

My favourite place for a luncheon would be this amazing place. A very popular place. Even if you go on a weekday, you are sure to wait for a table
It is always buzzing with people.
I have been here a number of times.
I have tried the mixed fried rice, thai noodles,  schezwan chicken, chilly chicken, thai lamb, golden friend prawn, dry chilly chicken, fish finger, butter chicken, pulau and nun.
And each of them is lovely.
The quantity of each of them is adequate for two.
Must try the golden fried prawn and the fish finger with the in house mayonnaise is to die for.
Will I visit again- Absolutely!!

Hatari is one of my fav when it comes for chinese cuisine. Have been to their baguiati outlet and gariahat outlet. The ambience is quite good and staffs are corteous. They will always at your service with a smile on their face. And helps to choose out the kind of dish you want. We were 7 people out there.
So we tried
*CHICKEN PRAWN FRIED RICE (1 PLATE)- Ample amount of rice filled with chicken and prawns. Two plates were sufficient.
*CHILLI GARLIC FRIED RICE (2 PLATE)- The rice was so tasty. Had the righteous flavour of garlic and chilly and garnished with yellow and red bell peppers. Loved it. And the amount was huge.
3 Plate rice was enough for 7 of us.
*SCHEZWAN CHICKEN (8 Piece/1 Plate)- Chunky pieces of chicken with thick chilly flavoured gravy. But i think the chicken was much fried so it became hard. When it comes for gravy i gradually prefer soft tender pieces. But liked the gravy.
But 7 pieces chicken was served. So when we complained it to the attendant they rectified it and served another 2 pieces of chicken which was quite impressive. Liked their way of corteousness.
*MONGOLIAN FISH (8 Piece/1 Plate)- Now this was the show stopper. It complimented with the rice so well. Tender soft pieces of fish with chilly sweet flavoured gravy and garnished with spring onion. Loved it so much. A must have üòä.
Our total bill was 1663 bucks which was quite reasonable. Yes definitely will visit again and again

The Cantonese roast pork was well done and had a nice tangy  taste to it. It's recommendable for the pork lovers..

2.Red chili chicken:
These spicy,reddy,hoty bellpaper chili chicken is fantastic..i recomend to try this item... rating-4.5/5

3.Thai chicken:
When they served thus item,because of the smell of chili flex i thought that it was more spicy than the previous dish.. but i was wrong.. It's taste like Hot & sweet..with the smell of spicy chili flex..taste good..but not up to the mark.. rating-3.5/5

4.Plain paratha:
rating- 2.5/5.

SECOND REVIEW

It's my second review but I visited this outlet 4 times. This time I visited with my family for new year celebration . But we were shockd because they changed their interior decoration . Their decoration is really very good. Now am come to food. We ordered chicken lolipop for starter, and two plate of egg fried rice ,one plate of hot garlic fish, one plate of Shanghai chicken ,and one plate of mutton handi for main course . Now am talk about food . Their food quality and quantity is really very good. The taste of Chinese dishes are really very good but mutton handi's taste is not so good. But I always recommend that plzz try their Chinese dishes . So Hatari is perfect for many time visits .

And they charge 2.50% SGST and 2.50% CGST.

Now that's dining! 

Great dishes with huge quantity, good music playing throughout, an unrivalled ambience for a family place, and at the most conspicuous of all locations! Match that! Hatari has always been a favourite. Tandoori chicken, to start with, is an epic dish. Hunan chicken and special fried rice (with or without pork) tasted heavenly. To try out a vegetarian dish, paneer with vegetables and mushroom was ordered but it was very light. Too light to be honest. On the whole, none of the dishes were too rich. 
Will be visiting soon again!

Last sunday we went hatari for lunch. This is at triangular park between rashbehari and gariahat. We had to wait for 15min. Decorations were not so eye catching. They were serving so late which was really irritating cause we are so much hungry that we could not wait. But quantity and quality wise foods were Awsooooome. We ordered 4dishes , and we were 4 people we could not finish 'em all. We ordered drums of heaven as starter. Then mixed fried rice and mixed rice and noodles and hot garlic chicken. We did not like hot garlic chicken as it was so less spicey and tastes poor. Drums of heaven consists of 7 pieces for 300. Prices are bit high though. Ambience was not so peaceful. Full of people and noice. I can recommend a friend for only its food quality and quantity only.

Quite disappointing. After watching a movie in Priya we thought to visit it as it is nearby. After getting the table we have to repeatedly request for mineral water. After 10 minutes it arrived but they gave us normal water. Which is really annoying. We ordered 3 hot & sour soups. The soup was rich in soya sauce and little bit of chicken was there. Then we ordered chicken prawn gravy noodles, Singapore Hakka Noodles, Sweet & Sour Boneless Chicken, Garlic Chicken Boneless. The Singapore noodles was sweet and not at all spicy as explained by the waiter who suggested it. The gravy in garlic chicken wasn't good too. Everything felt like below average. Had a lot more expectations.

Chinese items are excellent  in here. Starting from special rice to chowmin are great. Prawn items are best in here. Among the kebabs chicken malai kebab  is the best. My favourite dish in hatari is seafood suimui.

Nice ambience. Great food. Ordered Mongolian chicken, Korean rice. Good quantity enough for two. In desserts single sundae and hot chocolate brownie looked and tasted yummilicious. Overall a good experience. A good place for both family and friends.

Wanted to visit this place from a long time and finally I did, today.
1. Ambience: spacious and comfortable
2. Service: quick
3. Food: we ordered 3 items: drums of heaven, veg Shanghai rice n red chilli chicken. All 3 were awesome. Both quality n quantity was great. Infact the 3 of us couldn't even finish the food, so we had to get the rest packed. 
Bill was 904. Would love to visit there again, soon.

Well hatari is one of the most well known and legendary restaurants of Kolkata... Went there with my family on "poila baisakh" this year. As my parents never went there before nor they know about the craze around there... They were pissed off due to the long queue outside the place. I was adamant and asked them to wait. And the "sabrah ka fall was really meetha" . We got to enter at around 11pm and quickly placed our order- red pepper chicken,  Fakusa zuisi, Sha Cha chicken, masala kulcha and fish do piaza..
Starter was hot, spicy and really tasty. I loved Sha Cha chicken and masala kulcha... Kulcha and nans tend to get hard after few minutes but the kulcha was soft till the end.. rice was nice too. Quantity was huge and the waiter was warm andfriendly.. we ended our meal with fresh lime soda which was okay.. the experience was great and the restaurant has become my mother's favorite now..üòÅ

It is undoubtedly one of the best restaurant in Kolkata. This place is equally good in terms of quality and quantity. No restaurant in Kolkata can beat it's quantity. Day by day the quality is getting better and better. I consider myself so much fortunate since it's situated just at a 2 min walking distance from my house.üòÇ The environment there is very good. At the beginning they used to take a lot of time serving the food but now they serve it much faster compared to the previous times. Overall this is an excellent place to have lunch or dinner. If you people have not visited this place yet please go once. I bet you will like both the environment as well as the mouth watering, yummy food :-D

Given them 4 points just because of their shabby ambience with a dimly lit staircase and a dull looking place. Quality and quantity of the food are excellent. Ordered Egg chicken fried rice and Prawn delight. Quantity of rice was such that two of us were unable to finish it inspite of being very hungry. Prawn delight was really a delightful dish indeed. Pieces of prawns were huge and the dish was spicy and hot too. As i said earlier ambience had nothing to talk about but as it is said-- let the food do all the talking and they really are talkative in that senseüëç

All 5 stars for this restaurant. Have been eating here since a long time and truly speaking none of the restaurants make me feel the way this does. From the outside one will feel an urge not to enter it unless they actually go inside. The interior i wont say is really amazing but its not bad. Its a normal looking restaurant with a good interior but what suffices all the hardwork is the food. They serve you an ample quantity of food enough  for 3 people. The quality is really good and they have kept that since they opened. Must try„Äã Crispy fish, Pan Fried fish, Chilly Chicken Dry, Mongolian fish and chicken  for starters. I am not a fan of other kinds of meat  i stick to chicken mutton and fish. The Indian dishes are equally good one must try Chicken Do Pyaza. This is my all time  favourite joint and i will continue having food here.

They serve very tasty food in moderate price. Environment is clean. Felt very good.

Very convenient location and simple decor. Because of too much crowd,the ambience isn't very pleasant but the staff is good. Ordered a simple chicken fried rice and Manchurian prawn. The quantity was sufficient for two and the food was nice. if only the prawn had been a little less salty.

Hatari is especially known for the huge quantity of food they offer in such an affordable price.Located in Triangular Park,the restaurant is quite easy to find.

The ambience is not spectacular but quite satisfactory.The service was nice.Staff were courteous and friendly.

Coming to the food,we ordered :

1. Pan fried Chilli Fish - This starter is the best of all the dishes we had that evening.The fish was so soft and well cooked;it melted in our mouth smoothly and it tastes heaven.Definitely recommended !!

2. Mixed Fried Rice - The fried rice was mized with chicken,pork and egg.It was good enough. 

3. Lamb with Green Pepper and Red Chilli - The lamb preparation was simply awesome ! We loved it !! Recommended.

4. Chicken Manchurian - It was quite normal.Nothing extraordinary.

5. Singapore Noodles - The noodles was great!

The quantity served was enough to fulfill the starving  stomachs of seven people.

Our visit was worthwhile !! Hope to visit soon.

As the intro rightly says, the ‚ÄúLegendary family restaurant‚Äù has an emotional connect with the people born and brought up in that area (or maybe, Kolkata). My parents‚Äô favourite, so is mine. Be it treating family for your first salary or the customary Durga Puja get-togethers, it witnessed some of the best memories of my life.

My latest visit was rounded off with Szechuan Chicken, Singapore Hakka noodles, Lemon Fish, Hot Brownie with ice cream. I will not judge the taste as Hatari forms the basis on whic I judge other Chinese restaurants. 

Food: 5/5

Ambience: 4/5

Service: 5/5

Though the interiors have been upgraded, I will surely deduct points for making us wait in long queues in the festive seasons. Probably, its their strategy:- The hungrier you get, the tastier the food seems!

The place is right in the heart of one of the busiest place in Kolkata - Gariahat. The seating area is quiet large. The staffs are prompt and well behaved. We ordered pan fried fish as starter. The fish was well cooked, could really taste the Oyster sauce. The chicken noodles and schezwan lamb were good too. The quantity is huge for all the dishes. Best to visit if u r in group. The fresh lime soda was little bit sweet. Also been to the baguihati outlet but liked this outlet more. Keep up the good work.

This one just wins you over with its sheer taste of the food that it excels in! We had ordered drunken prawns for appetizers, mixed hakka chow and schezwan chicken for the main course. The prawns had a unique taste. Then came the main course and one bite into the chow secured the 5 point that it completely deserves. Well endowed with prawns and chicken. Good portion size ( A chow good enough for 3 people if you are ordering appetisers too). The ambience compliments the food. Service is very prompt and cordial and they will give you the right suggestions if asked for. I regretted for not having been on my prior visits to gariahat and will make sure I make it a point to fit in a lunch or dinner on all of my next visits.

Located near Traingular park, its a two minute walk.

Visited the place more than the many times.
From North indian to chinese they are masters in everything.

My favorite from the place is the dry chilli pork. To all the pork lovers do give a visit. Absolutely amazing.

Other good remark is the quantity, they serve amazing quantity along with great quality.

Service is always friendly as by year long staffs.
Pocket pinch is reasonable.

This place had been one my childhood favorite. Used to visit with parents and family. So on my friend's birthday we happened to visit here after ages. 
The look of the place is still the same as it was but the food standards have gone down. 
We had ordered for:
Fresh lime soda- too sweet. And the sugar crystals were not dissolved properly. (I wonder why they had added sugar to it in the first place) 
Pork cops in bbq sauce- this was the only dish worth mentioning that day. It was served in a bed of sauted vegetables. 
Mixed rice- though the quantity was huge, the taste of it was not nice. The pork chunks were merely boiled. And boiled pork is not nice to taste.
Chilly garlic pork- again this was very tasteless and bland.  Restricted myself to only one helping. 
The service was very slow. 
This place being such a big name should not take its customers for granted (the visit this time gave me that feeling). Hoping to have a better experience the next time if i visit. 
The 4 points just because of the memories connected to this place.

The restaurant located right opposite Hindustan Park is a true quality restaurant in Kolkata. It does not have a posh outlook from the outside. But they do concentrate on food and service. The place being not that big have enough staff to almost attend to every table. The service is prompt and amiable. The food quantity and quality based on the pricing is real good. Overall it's a no loss restaurant and a foodies mind will be replenished dining out here.

Hatari is one favorite destination of mine.  Have visited it a lot of times.. located in triangular park near priya gopal bisoi .. rice noodles, chilli duck, briyani, conji lamb, American chopsey... kebab platter.. all..and every food item is worth a try.. be careful if you r just two ppl going to dine coz the quantity they serve for two is too much..u will need 4 ppl to finish. The dining experience is good. But at times you have to stand in queue for long for a table or have to do previous reservations

We order chicken hariyali kabab, chicken rice and prawn in garlic sauce. I love¬† Hariyali kabab the most. The quantity of rice is good to. The price is also good so worth visiting again and again.

One can locate this place easily near triangular park .
Popular chinese restaurant I can say...though other dishes are also available.
Ambience is cosy with sober staffs and with many seating arrangements.
Food quantity is good enough and quality of the food is fresh too.
Pocket pinch is moderate. 
Fresh lime soda...pan fried fish u simply shoudn't miss if u r here with your family..partner or friends...rice noodles also tastes good.
Usually need to wait for a while during weekends.
This place is highly recommendable.

This is a paradise for Chinese lovers. This place provides you with the best delicious chinese dishes in south Calcutta. I frequently order food from this place or visit this place. In starters, my favourites are pan fried chilli fish, konjee lamb, crispy chicken. I love their pan fried noodles which contain the perfect amount of meat and vegetables. Their mixed fried rice, Cantonese noodles also deserve a mention. Chicken in red wine and chilli pork are my favourites. This restaurant never disappoints me with their quality or quantity of food.

A very nice place for chinese and mughlai dishes, the former being the more preferred one! The price may seem to be a bit on the higher side, but its totally worth it for the quantity they serve. The behaviour of the waiters is nice and the ambience is great too and the taste : pretty amazing! 

A minor drawback : the long queues on weekends and the never ending staircase which might be a problem for middle-aged family members!

I have great memories related to this place and therefore it would always be very close to my heart.I celebrated a special day here and had planned for a small surprise for a loved one which included of flowers and cake.Best part was it was done the apt way and moreover i wasnt charged a penny extra for the arrangement,only the exact prices were deducted.All thanks to Jimmy (manager).
This is a place which is always crowded no matter its a working day or a holiday.Its a chirpy kind of place with quality crowd.
Coming to the food,they make awesome chinese and that really suffices my crave for the cuisine and that too at a moderate price without the use of ajinomoto.Yes they ¬†do not use ajinomoto.
Do try the the squids starter,I just love it.The waiters are very warm and welcoming .
The restaurant has a well maintained interior and a typical ambience.
Only drawback is I just wish that they served alcohol.

Food quality is good,though i find it a bit over priced but my low rating is for behaviour of staffs of this place. You will feel weird as they will talk with their co workers about how quickly you'll leave,how you have wasted other 2 seats if you were 2 in a 4 person table, and other things. I find it totally unprofessional.

Coming to the food, we had ordered one chicken friend rice along with Chilli duck, both of which quantity and quality wise was more than enough for two. The bill was a meagre 747 Rs. Including the fresh lime Soda. Would love to visit again though

I've attended this place multiple times now, but I'll merely document today's experience now, because I barely remember the food items from before. 

Appetisers-
1. Tangy crispy chicken - It's been a constant favourite among our friends for ages now. Not sure if this item is even available at the Golf Green branch since this belongs to the special Oriental menu card. The chicken is crisply fried and tossed in a slightly hot, absolutely delectable sauce. Quantity is generous, as always. I'll rate this one a strong 4/5. 

2. Smoked lamb in sesame oil - this is an extraordinary dish. The lamb is melt in your mouth, the dish is mild and smoky and full of deliciousness, the sesame oil lends quite the taste to it. Highly recommended. 5/5 from my side for this. 

Mains: 

1. Egg fried rice - standard taste, more than decent quantity. 3.5/5

2. Sha cha chicken - Loaded with broccoli and baby corn and the likes, I expected this dish to be slightly better than what we received. It was mild, but slightly more sour than what I personally prefer. No complaints with regards to the quantity of chicken, although the quantity and quality of vegetables was severely lacking. Disappointing. 2/5.

3. Chef's Special Chicken - This tasted like a standard garlic based mildly spicy Indian Chinese dish with egg in it. Won't complain about the taste, it was great. 8 pieces is more than sufficient in a plate as well. 3.5/5.

4. Lemon Chicken - Shredded chicken in a light fragrant gravy, this one has always been a steady favourite of mine, in spite of the fact that the lack of colour puts off some people. I love the smell of gondhoraj lebu and found, surprisingly, that some of my friends felt it was too light or that the smell didn't come to par with a chicken dish. I personally loved it. 4/5.

Drinks-

1. Fresh Lime Soda - Tasted reasonable enough. 3/5.

Went for a family dinner. The quality of food is very good. The quantity is awesome. This is the perfect restaurant for groups for casual dinner. Recommendations made by the staff were very apt.
Crispy chilly baby corn, chicken reshmi kebabs were very good. Chop Suey items were also good. Deserts are good especially the brownies with ice-cream.
The price is on the lower side for the quality, quantity and service provided.

Weeks ago, I visited Hatari for dinner. The most bogus chinese dinner I have ever had was here.

Crispy Chilli Babycorn : This was the only satisfactory dish we had in Hatari.

Manchow Soup : It was a disgusting solution of soy sauce with veggies. 

Shanghai Friedrice : Flavourless rice with huge chunks of uncooked tomatoes and bell peppers. Yuck

Mongolian Chicken : This is supposed to be a star dish of Hatari. But it tasted like a mere sweet and sour chicken.

Highly disappointing experience. I dont understand why people keep prefering this place as it is unnecessarily costly and the food sucks !!

One of the legendary chinese restaurant in Rash behari avenue, south kolkata. It was one of my very frequently visited places. Although it is a multi cuisine restaurant, I prefer the Chinese here. Everything they serve is tasty. This place is spcially known for lamb (konjee crispy lamb), duck, and shrimps. The serving quantity is sufficient. Pocket pinch reasonable. A must try for chinese food lover.

This place serves nice chinese cuisine no doubt I love their Chinese Starters, Chopsueys, but I think they need to work on the tenderness of Chicken which is bit hard on main course dishes.

Ambiance : Okay (Too much of lights)

Want to have sumptuous Chinese cuisine?  Then this place should definitely be on your list! I always had this place bookmarked but somehow never got the time to make it here. Today fortuitously a friend treated us here and I am so in love with this place. First of all the ambience is all cosy and humble. Well seating arrangement.  Courteous staff. Quick service. Coming to the food, crispy chilly babycorn was lipsmackingly delicious. Also fish chilly and pepper was fresh and well cooked. Gravy vegetable noodles was something that I tried for the first time; and I am going to try it again here on my next visit. It was awesome. Chicken fried rice and chicken hakka noodles too worth trying. The cost might come up to a bit high but considering the generous quantity it's all worth it in the end. Keep it up guys, gonna visit this place again for sure.

There was quite a line outside the restaurant and we waited for approx. 30 mins but it was definitely worth it once the food came. The serving sizes were huge and we ordered 4 mains for 6 people and were all very very full by the end. The chicken munchurian was a bit too salty in my opinion but all other dishes were incredible. Will definitely come back here. Now we know why there's always such a line here, great food and reasonable prices.

Quantity. That's the word to describe this restaurant. I can bet, you will not find a cheaper Chinese restaurant serving you a stomach bursting amount of food that Hatari offers. Whether it be the lick smacking chilli chicken or the chicken fried rice, one plate can be eaten by 3 people and you will still have left over to take back home. That's how much they emphasize on ensuring your stomach is filled up. Prices are damn good for the amount of food you get and this is what makes Hatari stand out among the other restaurants in South Kolkata. Hope they keep this up and I'll keep visiting the place without a second thought.

Let's start with food & like all other reviews I would talk about every prospect -

1. Food - The Menu is "Diverse", you get both Chinese as well as Mughlai options. But they don't compromise the quality at any point. We ordered Egg - Chicken Fried Rice & Sanghai Chicken & both were mid blowing with ample quantity for 3 pax.

2. Ambiance - A lot, lot, lot to improve. We had to wait for around 20min without proper sitting arrangement which certainly wasn't acceptable. I definitely would advice them to anyway plan this better at least for their loyal customers. The sitting arrangement was neither very easy soothing nor comfortable. This is another workable area.

3. Facilities - No wifi, no sufficient sitting arrangement!!

We had ordered crispy chicken fry in appetizer, it was so juicy and crispy. It wasn't the usual crispy chicken but more of shredded crispy chicken,loved it. In main course we had Fish in Mustard Sauce, Special haka Chow and special fried rice. Another 5 star for the quantity. :)

Pocket pinch is reasonable as per quality.

Food quantity is sufficient.

Ordered Pan fried fish, Shanghai noodles, fried rice , sweet & sour chicken, hot garlic chicken and fresh lime soda.

Pan fried fish was tasty, soft & succulent with a tanginess.
Shanghai noodles & fried rice were of sufficient quantity and were nice and well cooked.
Sweet & sour chicken was well cooked, soft & juicy with perfect balance of flavours.
Hot garlic chicken was tangy and lip smacking.
Lastly, fresh lime soda was very refreshing and appetising.

Decided to check this place out with a friend on a lazy winter afternoon. Well, given the demand of the place and it being a weekend, we had to wait for a while to gain entry. The ambience and decor was pretty nice. I would especially like to mention the efficiency of the staff. We were about to order a whole lot of food, since we were determined to try  quite a few dishes. However, the staff courteously mentioned that the quantity would be too much for us. So with a little apprehension, we ordered a starter and main course.
Honeyed Chilli Lamb crisps- Decently cooked, seemed too sweet at first taste, but the flavour of chilli caught on later.
Nasi Goreng rice- Quantity was HUGE, rice well-cooked, with lots of spices and toppings.
Chilli Pork- That was a 5/5. Delicious and tender.
I am definitely going to recommend this place for an outing with friends and family, as this place is doubtlessly as I would call: Value for money.

I have been seeing Hatari forever. Gariahat has changed a lot with time. Hatari didn't. Of course there is renovation yet it remained, as crowded and popular as before. Have visited earlier too, but today went there after a long time with a friend. 

Parking is no problem. The decoration is good. There are well mannered boys and attendants who are constantly attentive.

We chose Hakka mixed chow mein and chilly fish. Food came fast and in such huge quantities that both of us could not finish it. The taste is good. The size of the chilly fish is large and they are soft and juicy. Price is also reasonable.

Possibly one of the hot shot contenders for the top slot in dine out style restaurants. 
It is not the interiors not the style or not the music 
Its all about the food 
A rare delight in our city
The quantity is also very well which is of this standard is not easily available.
The only issue is the taste of fried rice isn't like an upscale restaurant. 
Sometimes the quantity of chicken or prawn in mixed rice or noodles is too low.
But if you complain they will help you.

they even changed my dish and gave me a new one, ¬†

so very pleased¬†
Have a nice time here

A legendary restaurant in the history of family dining, Hatari is a great place to throw a party or to treat your friends, simply because of the lump sum quantities of food that they offer. Not much is to be said regarding the ambience, decor and staff - more or less what you expect in a decent dine out experience. Food quality is excellent, and Mongolian chicken is a must try among starters. The main trick here is to order economically, otherwise it's most likely that people will end up with heaps of leftover food after their meal.

I absolutely love their Chinese. Like always , I ordered Chicken fried rice and chicken Manchurian. And like always , it totally satisfied my tastebuds. Though the chicken Manchurian had a tad bit extra salt in it. But it was good nevertheless.

It was a Saturday. We went there to celebrate the marriage anniversary celebration of my parents. Though it was a normal Saturday, we had to wait in queue for around 20 mins. We ordered Crispy fried golden Prawn, Chilli and pepper fish and Konjee Crispy lamb as starter. In main course we ordered Singapore noodles, Mongolian chicken and sweet fresh lime soda. The food was mouth watering and very pocket friendly. With

The food was good. We have been to this place multiple number of times. Staff is courteous. But I faced a small problem this time during payment , my account got debited with Rs.1410/- twice on 10.12.2016. Can this please be reversed at the earliest.
At Hatari on 9/6/17 and a disappointing experience. Offered szechuan prawn having 6 pieces. But got a bowl with 5 pieces and when pointed out they went into denial. Finally it got amended. But seriously this kind of cheap stuff not expected from such an ole brand HATARI. This bowl was provided afterwards. But I won't change my rating. I am sure the management will look into this so that such incidents are not repeated.

Always whenever I walk by the footpaths from Gariahat towards Rashbehari Avenue, I never forget to miss out on a glimpse of this place. Else I will tell my partner "Dekh Dekh Hatari...Jabi niki"... This place was introduced to me by my Girlfriend as she is a Big Fan of its Biryani something which I haven't tried out till date inspite of visiting here umpteen times. Well this one is still on my bucket list for sure...One advise to everyone if you're visiting during weekends, please get some good amount of time in hand as you're sure to stand in long queues & a minimum of 30-45 mins wait (purely based on personal experience). However once your turn comes up & you get inside you feel like as if you're into Heaven (For hardcore foodies like me of course).I don't know if there are serving Welcome drinks anymore but I had a chance twice to have a taste of the Welcome Drinks and once it was Aam Panna & other time Lemon Juice..Starters --- A lot to choose from -- Am a Big Pork Lover so I generally order Double Fried Roasted Pork Dry (A little customized as I hail from the north-eastern part of India & have had Pork starters in many ways), Then I love the Smoked Lamb in Sesame Sauce, not to forget "Drums of Heaven".Main Course --- I loved the Mixed Rice noodles, Pork Fried Rice, Fish in Chilli Mustard Sauce & how I can I forget "Chengdu Chicken"One suggestion to everyone if you're planning to try out a few dishes out here, please do visit with a at least a group of friends (3-5) as the quantity of in every department is over satisfying...The place has really set high standards for itself and at the end when you pay the bill both from Quality & Quantity perspective you will be satisfied.So what are you waiting for... If you're a Chinese Food lover then this is one of the places to be for sure... I will be rating it 4.5 only because of the long wait in the queue...Otherwise it would have been a Perfect 5 for me....Cheers...!!!

1)would recommend to families or large groups.
2) prices and taste of food both are average .
3) not recommended to couples as they rarely make you sit in a large table though they dont have small tables for two people or smaller group.
4) almost everytime you have to stand in a queue to enter.
5)ambience is like everything is confined in a small place you can see everyone from every corner.
 i didnt like or dislike it , you may go if you want to.

Hatari!! A safe option. When nothing comes to my mind its a safe choice. You can always go to it. One of the best multicuisine in the budget. Had went in for lunch,there was a bit of rush. Took special motton biriyani with motton handi.  Motton wes well prepared in both the cases. And then had butter roti with Chinese mixed veg. On the the best rotis I had.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Being heard lot about Hatari at Gariahat and its fascinating food. In the recent times They have made their name spoken from every food loving person for their mind blowing food whether its Indian or its Chinese. I have always a craze for Hatari and this is the Mother outlet of all four outlets in Kolkata. Being already tried the Vip Road outlet my expectation with this outlet was certainly on the top notch. The kind of food i had last time was just above the bar. SO dropped in here at the Gariahat outlet for a birthday lunch with family.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE : If you are going to hatari don't expect anything with the ambiance or the interiors or exteriors. They dont speak with the kind of interior glitters they talk with the charm of their mouth watering food. Though it was quite a big outlet with lots of tables up for grabs, not happy with the lightings as it was too dim. If i talk about staff then they have some very well mannered and attentive staff. Very courteous and always ready to be in your service. Full Marks for the service.
¬†
FOOD AND DRINKS : With the kind of happy experience i had in their previous outlet i decided to stick with the same here also. So ordered the Chicken Reshmi Kabab as the starter followed by Main course:

Chicken Reshmi Kabab : Highly Disappointed! The kind of reputation they have i didn't expected this from them. The chicken was good in shape and size but the kind of softness and juiciness i was expecting really shattered me big time. It was hard and according to me the marinated chicken was too much frozen in the fridge which turned the things wrong. When complained first it was denied but later they accepted and offered for another plate of Kabab but it was main course time till then.¬†

Sweet & sour Chilli Chicken : This was sweet as well as sour too. Perfectly blended. The gravy was thick and good in quantity. Though it also gave me a feeling of Lemon chicken a little. Everything was done well until again i had an issue with the meat which was uncooked inside.¬†

Chicken Prawn Fried Rice : Tremendous with the taste and quantity. Simply you can't beat Hatari's Fried rice in any form. Talking from the quantity so one bowl can easily be consumed by three people. The amount of chicken was done justice, really happy with the prawn as it was fresh and tasting as it should be. The spices were mixed excellently ¬†and finally i had something to cheer about.

Chicken Manchurian : This was a Manchurian i can finally say. Had lot of Manchurian over the year but they served the best till now to me. Again the chicken was and gravy was done justice. The quantity has more than enough.

Chicken Prawn Noodles : Like all the other dishes this also dosent left behind to impress us. The kind of preparation and spices they put in just done magic with the taste. Filled with good amount of chicken and prawn. One bowl is enough for 3.

CONCLUSION: There were few ups and down this time but surely their experience can't be challenge. May be one of those days. Coming to the food so i was very impressed with the raw materials they use. Quantity is just unquestionable. ¬†They are doing excellent job with the food and i hope they open soon in North as well.
All the best. Cheers

Can easily be located at gariahat. The ambience is homely...service is accurate and on time. Food quality is excellent. Variations of meats are available. A multicuisine restaurant. The oriental dishes are tasty, chili pork dry is must try,one. 
We ordered 
*Chili pork dry..which was most tastier.
*keong's chicken...
*mixed noodles
*Nasi goreng..a rice preparation, more like mixed rice with a twist of different taste.
*general tao's chicken
*ginger garlic fish...

Would love to visit again..

The standalone top rated elite property of Gariahat, Hatari has always been an old favorite of mine. The last time When I visited this place, I had schezwan fried rice, brown glazed duck, red chilli pepper fish(starter) etc. The fried rice had ample amount of prawns and chicken and the schezwan sauce here is amazing, unlike other places.. Less spicy and on the tangier side. Food was very palatable but they took a lot of time to arrive. Service needs a lot of improvement.

Today we went to Hatari to have some oriental food. My God! Finally got a chance. We tried several times during pujas and other occasions but didn't get a chance to please our taste buds as it was too crowded to get a seat. Anyway let's concentrate on the food. Food was average as oriental food was too spicy for me. But really liked their seafood rice and floats. Little bit expensive. May be going to visit again to try their Chinese.

Hatari is one of the exemplary places about how a dine-in restaurant should be in terms of every particular thing. This hub is one of the oldest restaurants in South Kolkata, holding up its fame since ages...truly a perfect dine-in place with pretty decor and ambience and it never fails to impress me with it's food..and oh yes the QUANTITY...that's a major thing here..having said that, it doesn't compromise with the quality as well...so it's like double bonanza!
Been here a number of times...and each time got back with a happy tummy.
So some dishes to check on :

STARTERS :
‚Ä¢ Drums of Heaven : I've never tasted a better one anywhere... So they're just a pro in this one.
‚Ä¢ Fish chilli n pepper : the spices just tantalizes the taste buds and will keep u wanting for more...and the fish pieces are so succulent that they will melt in your mouth.
‚Ä¢ Pan fried Chilli Prawn : Schezwan taste of prawn with the perfect crunch just blows off the mind.

MAIN COURSE :
‚Ä¢ CHOW-MEIN / MEI-FOON : 1 bowl just enough for 3 servings.
‚Ä¢ Dry chilli Pork - the tastiest of all dishes...never tasted a better one before.
‚Ä¢ Stir Fried Lamb / chilli lamb both equally luscious.
.
Service is super quick with prompt and suave staffs.
.
RATINGS :
 FOOD : 4.5/5
 AMBIENCE : 4/5
 SERVICE : 4/5
 VFM : 5/5

Hence, RECOMMENDED!!! üëë

I've been here a few times, one of the most famous food joints in South Calcutta. They also opened a new branch near Baguihati, VIP road. I really like the place, specially their service even when they are stuffed with people. ¬†Also the interior decorations are quite sober, it's a very cozy experience overall.
The quality and quantity of the FOOD they serve are both ample. The place is well known for it's Chinese food. Almost everything they serve are excellent. Except the Chopsuey, which is a little too sweet for the average Indian tongue, though the quantity is enough to fill two hungry stomachs and the gravy is stuffed with meat and veggies. Surprisingly, they also make a decent biriyani, but the amount is less, but should be enough, for an ordinary person, if you're taking something on the side. If, you're nearby and hungry definitely, give this place a visit.

We ordered a host of things like chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, lamb in black bean sauce, american/chinese chopsuey, biriyani as well. All the dishes were brilliant and the quantity was more than enough. Definite Go.
On a side note- they did take a while to deliver the food but it was a rush day so its understandable.

Ok,so my first review on zomato. :)
Hatari is that place which i have frequented loads of times and it has never failed to entice my tastebuds..and the bonus ofcourse remains the humongous quantities of food fit to satite any hungry soul and stomach.
The ambience remained serene and beautiful as always.I ended up having a really great birthday lunch there.We ordered pork friedrice..perfectly cooked as always with large pork chunks in it.With that crispy chilly honey lamb was ordered as starter which was extremely tasty too but i would have preferred if the spice was a little less.Then we ordered fish with sweet and sour garlic sauce and this dish was out of this world sumptuous.Tender fish pieces with a delectable sauce with the enticing smell of garlic..it was too good.Hatari is a bit high on cost but they make up for it with their amazing quantities.

Aah!! it was my first visit during this festival season and compared it with other restaurant. But it has been proven me wrong and I'm happy for that. When I went with my mother, place was not so full and easily we got seats but while coming out we got to know the demand of this place. They have wide range of dishes and I heard they have speciality in pork too. But I was with my mother so unable to taste that :( . Apart from that whatever the food we ordered that was quite excess for two people so it's a perfect place if you want to hang out with large group. They maintained the taste of foods during festival time also that's a good side and they have quick service too :) All over I like this place and want to visit again to try out pork dishes .

Pros would be:
1. Very fast and prompt delivery of food.
2. Waiters are very polite and gentle.
3. The quantity is a lot (by loy I mean too much) for the amount.
Cons:
1. Its too overcrowded and the din would irritate u.
2. Chinese is good, though I didn't like the Shanghai Chicken, tasted like dozen of pills had been dissolved.The honey chicken starter was lip smacking though, so was the chicken fried rice.
3. And the place is not capacious at all.....felt claustrophobic.
4. Is a not a frugal choice to make if u are low in budget because its pricy.....But for the amount it provides I think it justifies!

We went in there on d day aftr lakshmi puja. Even if puja  n all were over they offered us the puja menu in which a lot of lovely dishes roti n desserts were missing. We had to choos from a very limited no of dishes.
It however contained some of their signature dishes.

Starters: Mongolian chikn n chickn tandoor
Mongolian chikn was reallt vryy ausome..

Main course: Chikn fried rice, nun, sechewan fish, chkn.
In roti section,They only had num which was a bit dissapointing. The quantity of chikn fried rice was really good. Taste was nice. Sechewan fish was pale, could hav been more spice. It was nice experience overall.

Desserts: The puja menu didnt hv any deserts, howevr they told us that they hav icecreams. We orderes chocklate, butterscotch n tutifruity. The tutifruity really looked sexy. Yumm. 

Enjoyed d eveneing. Very nice place to hav a good meal. Loved the service and the quantity and also d food.

Service is good. I love their fish and chips and babycorn. it is absolutely yummy.

For the main course if you are fond of lamb then you can definitelty try their chilli lamb or chilli pork because both are very good.
We had ordered pan fried chilli fish, a chicken gravy which i dont rememeber and gravy noodles.
It is was mouth watering.¬†
A must visit for all.

This is a favorite near Triangular Park. They have perfected their niche, which is decent chinese food at an economical price. What they are known for is their quantity, so be careful when you order, their portion sizes are huge.

I would recommend the chopsuey - our family favorite, their crispy chicken and fish as well as their soups.¬†

I hope they maintain the quality and quantity they serve. All in all it is the perfect restaurant to satisfy your evening ¬†Indo-chinese food cravings.

Pocket friendly.Good quality and quantity.Nice atmosphere. But should take up delivery in zomato . I have to go and buy food there which is quite not possible everytime.My mother and me both like their fried rice and chicken Manchurian. One must try pan fried chilly fish.

Been there on navami night.. had to wait for more than an hour to book a table. bt the wait was worth it. 
Food orderd- tikka kabab, 2 mixed chowmine and 1 chili pork, 4 cold drnks (For 3 ppl) 
1 mixed chowmine was sufficient for 3 ppl. The  Quantity is huge, even quality of food is very good.
Price- Reasonable.. it cost around 1654.
Would recommend to try the chili pork.

This is my second visit to Hatari, triangular park and that too on Nabami during the Durga Puja. Hence I had considerably lowered my expectation for quality of service and food. Having first hand experience that during festivals, restaurant food quality as well as quantity goes for a toss. But I was pleasantly surprised that it was not the case here.

The waiters were courteous. The restaurant was cleaned well (it is not uncommon to come across dirty floors, seats, even dirty cutlery sometimes during festivals). We had ordered chicken asparagus soup, pan fried fish, chicken fried rice and chilly chicken. The food was good. The highlight being the pan fried fish. Quantity is awesome for all the items, which is why the prices seem to be fine. (The only disappointment was the waiting in the queue, while the stomach was shouting out for food. But its a given during festivals. Can't help). All in all a nice restaurant. Pork lovers can try chilly pork. Lipsmacking@!!

Hatari... has kept its name and repo for years and is a place u surely have to visit for a fine dine. The chineese was delicious the chilly pork was well flavoured and was yummy. The only major drawback was its service and booking hassle, without a proper place for the customers to wait. but overall delicious food which is also pocket friendly. I highly recommend this place, do visit it once.

Alright, so this is slightly delayed since ¬†I actually went with my friends for lunch last Friday, but better late than never. Firstly, I'd like to thank the management for the great time and enjoyable experience. The Drums of Heaven which we ordered as a starter was excellent and we've been discussing how sumptuous it was since then (as a matter of fact, we were just talking about it, which reminded about posting this review.)¬†

The pre-puja rush meant a slightly slower service than I'm used to at Hatari, but nevertheless, it was a great and memorable experience. ¬†Thanks!

I went here with 2 of my friends on Choturthi 2016
Hatari is famous for it's Food and The Long waiting before getting in.
Luckily enough We got in pretty quick.
The ambience is nice just that everyone is a bit too loud ;)
The staff is well behaved and courteous.
We ordered
Pork Fried Rice
Shanghai Chicken
Initially we ordered 1 batch of each item.
We were very hungry
So we decided to have another helping of Pork Fried Rice but owing to their quantity we could not finish and had to get it packed.
I must say the quantity they provide is just incredible. :)
The pricing is perfect.
They just take vat and s.tax :)
And the pork fries rice was heavenly.
Shanghai chicken had the right amount of spice and was wonderful.
Hatari has rightfully earned it's name.
Extremely happy with their service and quality of food.
Thumbs Up.
Don't Miss this one.

Best place to have Chinese food in Gariahat area. Hatari is the place to be if you want to enjoy good Chinese food at a decent price. The restaurant offers varieties of Chinese preparations which come in huge quantity. The service is good but it could be improved. But one has to stand in long queues to get inside the restaurant and due to its popularity it remains full all the time.

Hatari is quite a legend near Deshapriya Park and a favourite of most 90's kids growing up in south calcutta. I remember Hatari through countless family dinners when I was a child, first outings with friends or cousins as a teenager and pocket friendly dates! Be prepared for a waiting time, whenever you go. They serve in huge portions so be careful while ordering. I love their chopsueys, soups and noodles.

I visited this place for the first time yesterday. The decor needs to be upgraded immediately. The place was really crowded and the A.Cs weren't working properly. The service time is extremely quick. The servers are really polite and well behaved. Its a little heavy on the pocket but makes up for it in quality and quantity.
We had ordered Goreng Rice from the Oriental menu. It was delicious although i wished that the rice was coked for a tad longer,it was a little chewy. The roast pork was upto the expectation too. We washed these down fresh lime soda.

A special item of hatari for me is mongolian chicken and the chop suey is also good (American) . It is a worth it place for chineese lovers .

This was my 2nd visit to Hatari. I went to Hatari for the 1st on 31st Dec 2013 with my friends group. The 1st thing I fell in love with was Pan fried chilli fish. The second time I went there, I ordered pan fried chilli fish first. One of the best pan fried chilli fish dish I had. It is so tasty that I can't express in words. I had dry chilli pork and hunan chicken when I visited hatari for the 1st time. On 2nd visit I ordered special fried rice and lamb with mushroom. Lamb with mushroom is not spicy. Though I love spicy foods, I ordered this non spicy dish as whom I went with prefers non spicy food. However, inspite of being non spicy, it tasted good. Quantity and quality both are very good. If u order a single dish, it will be more than enough for 2 person. I love this place a lot and would love to visit again.

Another legendary and old restaurant of Kolkata succumbs to my list. Visited it this Saturday after a hectic pujo shopping.

Had to register my name first followed by maintaining a long queue. Thankfully, fans installed on the side-walls provided some respite from the scorching heat outside.

The entry despite the long quite wasn't very chaotic but surprisingly smooth. Once inside the restaurant you are greeted by the ever attentive waiters. The cooling is good and they even allow you to sit on the four-seaters even though you are single.

The food:
I had requested for the Hong Kong soup which is a delectable dish made of thick soup, corn flour based, and with prawns, chicken and mushrooms apart from other paraphernalia.

The golden fried prawns are crispy and actually made up of medium sized prawns split longitudinally and then spread apart to give an apparent feeling of being large.

The disappointment for me was the pan fried chilly fish.This was deep fried and extremely recalcitrant to my taste. I have had better tasting stuff elsewhere. The fish used is bassa which has become quite popular in India mainly because of the following reasons-
1. Easier to prepare, no elaborate maturation
2. No smell of its own
3. Only a central bone

Being a doc I know that bhetki has higher proportion of omega 3 & 6 FA which is protective for the heart.
I urge all my readers to insist on bhetki rather than on bassa which had come into prominence only because of its ear of use.

Another request to the Bengali middle class not to visit a classy Chinese restaurant and request for biriyanis. This way they will ensure the death of specialty restaurants in Kolkata for sure.

The quantity was optimal for two persons and had to box them home. Overall, I left the place with mixed feelings.

This is a very old restaurant of Kolkata and quite a popular one. Even in the Evening you will find it full and quite bustling... 
The food is quite good and economical. 
However I would recommend you not to have the green chicken as it doesn't taste that good. There is a Chinese menu card and an oriental menu card. 
The waiter's are extremely polite and the service is fast too. 

The location is in gariahat road which is convenient for people as it is on the main road.

Well I don't know how to start.I have been a constant customer at Hatari for years now.I had very good experiences at past,i was one of those customer who used to proudly recommend this restaurant to friends and relatives.
Last visited there on 7.10.17,a Saturday early afternoon.Was welcomed usually by the staff and got nice place to sit as well.
Excited as always,we ordered
1.mongolian fish(dry) - 5/5
2.thai fried rice - 0.5/5
3.chili pork-3/5
4.fresh lime soda
The rice was just not eatable,i was wondering if it is edible or not!.The grain was simply yesterday's.It was so disgusting that we couldn't eat.
Same for the pork,just that a lil better than the rice.
The one eatable,rather delicious was the fish and that is why i have given 2star.
A horrible experience at hatari, gariahat.
Hatari was one of my favourite,but the quality has gone down so drastically that it is unimaginable.

This is one of the classics and it is almost an iconic restaurant and among the very few 'heritage' places that has maintained it's quality and standard. I have been here innumerable number of times but thought of giving a review of a recent visit. The ambiance is homely and comfortable and the staff is friendly. I had momo as starters, lamb with mushrooms and mixed fried rice as the main course. The momo gets finished easily and a few who came after us did not get it. The food is still excellent as usual but I am taking half a star for non availability of certain items. The stock management should be better.

A decent restaurant in the triangular park area, a series of stairs is all you need to climb. The food is really good. The amount they serve is more than many well-known places I've been to.

If you are looking for Chinese food in gariahat then Hatari may be the place for you. Though its a multi cuisine restaurant its famous for its chinese food which in this case is Indian chinese.¬†
Prices of dishes were a little on the higher side but the quality and quantity surely does make up for it. We ordered Chicken Prawn Fried Rice and Noodles with the chefs special chicken and drums of heaven as starters. All the dishes were great. Previously I had tried their polao and it was very tasty to say the least. ¬†

A tip if you want to eat at this place its better to have prior reservation because its always crowded specially in the weekends. Overall rating great place in terms of food. :)

Hatari- the legendary restaurant. A decade ago when the gastronomical explosion was yet to happen in south Kolkata, it used to be a cherished place for Chinese food. They really make great duck cuisines, which is rare in south Kolkata. The rest are the usual Chinese dishes that you'll get at any renowned joint nowadays. We have had countless treat there. Now it has numerous joints and I really don't like them. I miss the good ol' hatari. Someday I'll go back to hatari, but not today.

Renowned Chinese eatery situated just opposite to triangular park.
A small place but almost remains full all the time.
Went for a chicken mushroom soup,mixed fried rice and sweet and sour chicken.
The soup was a clear soup with lots of mushroom(canned ones) and chicken pieces.Suited my palate very nicely.One mixed fried rice was more than enough for three people with a side dish.Again ample pork,prawn,egg and chicken in the rice.
The chicken had a strong vinegar hit,not very nice,also the carrots had a little odd smell.Again the quantity was huge.Will visit again to further try other stuffs.

Even though located right opposite to Triangular Park, this place can be a bit difficult to locate, since all you get to see from the pavement is a flight of stairs. But once you reach the other side of the stairs, it is almost like a different world. The d√©cor is beautiful and the staffs friendly. They will happily guide you to your table. The seat capacity is huge and so is the quantity of the food served. We ordered Crispy Chicken and Pan Fried Chilli Fish for starters and decided to skip the soup. Korean Lamb and Mixed Rice Noodles were ordered next. I was excited to see, that they have Duck in their menu and decided to order Duck on my next visit. As for my present visit, the food was superb. The lamb was not stiff and fish fresh and soft. The prawns and chicken in the noodles tasted good, but a bit undercooked, I felt. Overall, I came back happy and content.

Other than mainland China ,whenever am craving for Chinese cuisine hatari is the place. 

Probably this place needs no introduction. 
I visit this place more often.

Ambiance , service, stuff , food everything is perfect 

Well two of my favourite dishes are ..
Mongolian fish 
Thai pork (dry) 
  Highly recommended :)

Went there after may be a year with colleagues for dinner. Ordered dry chili pork which was too spicy but the taste was good. Pan fried fish which was crispy n stir fried and really good. But was disappointed with the main course where we ordered gravy noodles which was really bland, fried rice which was just ok and garlic chicken was was not up to the mark and we were struggling to finish the stuff. Being such an old restaurant and considering the number of footfall I feel they are lagging behind.

Hatari is one of the iconic eateries in Kolkata. A trip to Gariahat seems incomplete without eating in Hatari. A non-descript gate leads to Hatari, located on the first floor of a house. There is a good amout of seating, however, whenever you visit the place there will be a waiting line of hungry college students, couples and families. This is evidence enough of the popularity of the place. They serve both Indian and Chinese cuisines. The food is tasty and good. The good quatity and reasonable pricing is another reason why many people flock to Hatari. If you are looking for a good hearty meal without buring a hole in your pocket this is definitely the place to be.

Ordered crispy chilli potato as a starter which was good. In main course ordered chill garlic rice and sweet n sour chicken. The rice tasted nice and quantity was okayish (keeping the price tag in mind). But the chicken was not good at all, the gravy tasted eerily similar to tomato ketchup. Got a feeling of eating chicken dipped in a whole lot of ketchup.

The main plus point is that here u can get north Indian dish, Chinese dish and Oriental dish... We ordered chicken tandoori full as starter, followed by prawn chicken rice and fish in oyster sauce... All of them were just wow in taste... Though the rates were a bit costly but the quantity is surely more than any other restro.

I have been here innumerable times and will keep visiting for the quantity and quality of the food. Ideal when you have a huge group and want to fit in for pocket friendly food. Service is quick. The best thing is the quantity they give,but there is no compromise on the quality! My favourite is pan fried chilly fish(a must have for me,everytime I go).

American chopsuey here is a fav of mine. I try experimenting in diff restaurants and have had my share of ups and downs. But on days when I am looking for guaranteed good food, (like today, after a horrid restaurant experience yesterday) i choose Hatari. That's saying a lot, isn't it! Try Hatari if you have not yet.

One of my most favourite restaurants in the city.

Excellent food,reasonable pricing and definitely one of the best chinese you will ever have.

The place is not too big and is always crowded and you might have to wait for a table a little while but all of that is justified for the Hatari experience.

I have heard from others that the other outlets that have been newly opened are not that good or simply stating bad but the main branch,the legendary one, opposite Triangular park is an absolute delight.

A must visit for everyone.

Have heard a lot about this place for ages but never been there, until last week we made a sudden plan. 
We order fish fingers which was sided by french fries and mayonnaise, and manchow soup. The fish was awesome and the soup was very dense. And it was indeed very tasty. Then we ordered Sanghai Rice and schezwan fish, the fish was great, but the rice was not upto the mark. It was supposed to be mixed rice but hardly there was any prawns in it. We could have told the authority, but we were too hungry for all that. Anyway, did not expect it from them as the previous food were indeed tasty. Ambience is good but the internal parlour closes at 4pm and I didn't find any reason for that. Staff behaviour was also good.

This is my favourite dine-in place from last 5/6 years. The price charged over here is reasonable in accordance with the quantity served. You can never finish a chinese dish alone over here. It comes in large proportion. I've tried a lot of their dishes and none seemed to disappoint me except their chicken drumsticks. Those were below average. One must try their crispy chicken for the starters(cooked from shreded chicken and comes in good quantity) and chicken in oyester sauce for main course. These two are my favourite.

I guess everyone who visits hatari is well aware of their oh so long queue during the pujas.....so that would speak in itself about their quality of food!!!and yes the quantity is commendable. One portion is simply enough for two hungry souls.The price being a bit on the higher side....with the service tax and all...but you wouldn't mind paying after tasting the food and looking at the quantity. The mixed chow mein would definitely leave you dreaming about it later on....when hungry...again....just lyk me *wink*

No one can ever make get enough of Hatari. It is literally the best place to have Chinese food. The quality is like out of the world and the quantity just has no one near its sight. There can never be any complaint against the food. In fact the service is also just as good. Oh....did I mention the ambience. The best place to enjoy, celebrate, rejoice - just anything that one wants to do. But the only thing holding me back to give a full is the price. It is pricey stuff and even with all taxes the prices really should have been less. Good things demand price, no doubt, but the price should be a bit less. Overall, Hatari remains the golden place to visit and I may repeat my first statement again and again and again.

The first day ever to visit hatari was on friendship's day last year with my friends. We ordered starters, rice noodles, and garlic fish. The total preparation was good indeed! And the pocket pinch way too less! I visited there several more times but the last time was disappointing. We were suggested by the people there to take Mongolian chicken as they said it was one of the best there! But it was too sweet for our liking. Rest items were awesome and the ambience perfect!

6 yrs in Kolkata and nvr been to this place tats operating from around '66....passed by it many times....So finally a friend's birthday treat cum a mini clg reunion led me to this place....The restaurant may not be located in a posh building BT once u enter it the d√©cor spells class.....Staff was courteous and helpful and patiently took all our orders that was given for such a huge group of us.....

Coming to food...if u are not a voracious eater,u need to order carefully at this place..The amount is a lot...a single bowl of rice would serve two superfoodies easily..Food is clean and delicious....We ordered Mixed fried rice,schzwan fried rice,chicken noodles,Hot garlic chicken ,Schzwan chicken,Chef's special chicken....If u are not a fan of spicy and chilli-licious food better avoid hot garlic and schzwan...Desserts were okayish...Brownie with ice cream was regular nothing superb...and tutty frutty is just fresh fruits with ice cream which I felt was the only item not worth it.....Sundae was just three scoops of vanila chocolate and strawberry.....with cashrws and stuffs as garnish......

The place serves pork lamb and duck in a lot of diff varieties which I would soon visit to taste !!

The name is enough to ring bells about good food in your ears. Being one of the oldest of the lot, this one is situated right at triangular park, so spotting it wouldn't be a problem.
The seating area is situated on the 1st floor. I have been here twice so far. They serve chinese and north indian food. The chinese dishes are much more popular other than their indian cuisine but it's too worth a try. On my first visit with a friend we ordered chicken fried rice and mongolian chicken. The quantity n quality was good. On my second visit, I ordered steamed chicken momos for starters. The momos were well made the only downside was the complementary thukpa which tasted extremely bad. 
For the main course we ordered north indian food starting with buttered tandoori rotis and naan and dal makhani and an kashmiri aloo dum as sides.
It took them pretty long to get everything at once, that became a tiny problem at first as the dal was getting cold. The meal impressed me much. Everything was cooked nicely, the dum aloo was subtle and the gravy had a homestyle base. Dal was excellent , but a bit salty. That depends on your taste. Overall this place has been and is still a great joint for anytime dining. Hope they serve this well, for more days to come.

Try anything you like,you won't get disappointed. Only disappointment ,which you may have to face- you need to wait and wait and wait to get in. There is long queue always specially on weekends. But the wait always tastes beautiful thereafter.

The place which is too famous for its chinese Food.Be it a normal day or on the DP days you do have to wait on an queue to grab a table.

One of my visit on DP days i was on 104th number and waited for more than 4hrs to eat here grabbing chips from the local stalls to manage with my hunger rush.

you can get it by my words itself by now, that its how much worth enough to wait for the food from this particular place.

Be it fried Rice, chilly prawns , chilly crab , korean Chicken , seafood noodles

I smiply love all, all of them.

The quantity is pretty enough and the prices  are moderate .

Visited this place a couple of months back. Located at the heart of Rashbehari Avenue, so there won't be any problem finding it. The restaurant is in the 1st floor and you have to go through the staircase.

We ordered Schezwan Fried Rice and Chengdu Chicken. Well the delivery was okay. Not quite fast. But the food was real hot. And it tasted amazing. The rice was great and the chicken was also quite good. One of the best Chinese destinations in Kolkata.

This is going to be funny! LOL

¬†Umm..Been visiting this place, as a regular,  since i've been living in kolkata as a regular. I would say, that year would be  1996.  And this is the first time, i'm reviewing this place :P

Though this place requires no rating or reviews......What actually spurred me to write this review is their level of hospitality that's always been a constant years down the line.  I happened to visit this place on 14th July 2016... Probably after a long span of 7 years, give or take a few months.  Uniforms changed...a bit of interiors have been given a face-lift.. they needed it. But right from the gate,, the recognition, and the old familiar faces that greeted me to my seat, as if  I was there a few days back... was more than enough, given the fact that they happen to handle, such a huge bulk of customers everyday!  Coming to the food....as far as i remember...i've never had any issues with their quality or quantity of the food they serve, in between, they had decreased their quantity but they are back to their old form once again..   We had ordered a Mixed fried-rice and a side of Schezwan Pork.. along with a Talumein soup...The soup has changed in taste and texture over the years..but the taste was absolutely the same.  No comments about the rice or the side dish....they tasted incredibly good....and the quantity, as always was too much for two people to finish....we ended up over eating.. :P 

They still play Brian Adams...Enrique and Iron Maiden .....hahahaha....as their recorded music....it hasn't changed a bit....they have been playing the same playlist...for the past 10 freaking years!!! :P  The crowd, like always,  a mix and match of College kids and Family...alike....this place has always been like home to people like me and several others. 

We had eaten so much....couldn't waste the food, it being so yummy..  we had to finish of our meal with a Sweet lime soda and Ice-Cream.  :) 

Keep up the awesome work you guys do!!! Can't wait to visit you again shortly! :D

Hatari has always been a Hotspot for Chinese lovers across the city, specially South Kolkata s. Went there after ages last week on a rainy Sunday afternoon.. Waiting queue was minimal, we got seats almost immediately (that's a surprise!) Ambience well quite good.. buzzing with people as it was always. Ordered Drums of Heaven and Pan Fried Chilly Fish as starters. They were good though the Drums of Heaven was a bit high on salt quotient. Mixed fried rice was good as always their trademark.. Chicken in oyster sauce wasn't good at all.. Very high on soya sauce content.. Maybe our expectation from Here  is more. Staffs though well behaved, have now become careless n complacent. We were served fish in oyster sauce before it was replaced..

These people don't have any idea what they have in their menu and how it is cooked... Today we decided to order some food from them as till date we had a very good impression about hatari (triangular park) as a restaurant...but to our amazement today our order- barbeque pork chops in barbeque sauce- was somehow changed and was cooked in chilli garlic sauce. When we asked them to change the same they refused to do it and also insulted us in a mocking manner...did not expect this kind of an unprofessional behaviour from such an old and reputed restaurant.

It is a 5min walk from Priya Cinema. Take the same footpath and walk and you'll find this restaurant. 
We have gone there earlier and still opted to go over there. We had ordered American Choupsey, Butter nun and Chicken Bharta. The food was no doubt great as usual. The American Choupsey was my favourite among them. It had the right crisp and the gravy was excellent. 
The bill came around 700(including taxes).

I have been eating here since the last thirteen years and seen a lot of changes in interior decors and menu.

I miss the steamed rice/noodles with chicken/fish and vegetables ( a soothing Chinese preparation which is now included as a soul food in my family).

I love their red pepper chicken, crispy chicken and crispy vegetables as starters and mixed or egg rice noodles, garlic chicken, chilli crab and chilli mushroom.

The last time I visited, I ordered chicken with red wine but it turned out too sweet and smelling of alcohol as the wine was added at the end of the cooking (red wine is to be added at the starting so that the alcohol evaporates leaving behind the flavor only).

Went to this place on a Monday, without reservation. N the place was Not crowded,
I have to say that food was really good.
One of the best places to have pork 
Taste was good and the quantity is reasonable for the price
We were 2
N ordered chilly pork, pan fried fish, and crab chilly dry, as starter's 
Pan fried fish and chilly pork was great.

But crab wasn't that good 
It didn't had the juicy flesh little disappointed.
Next we ordered 
Garlic prawn and fried squid.
Garlic prawn was great (we had ordered small prawn)  the prawn size was larger than our expectation. Really enjoyed the prawn.
Squid was good too, better than most sea food restaurant.
We were full by this 
Had tutti-frutti n fruit punch for desert
Had a great lunch..
The stuff were really helpful n kind.
Service was Swift.
Good proportion for the price.
Elaborate menu. 
Nice ambiance.
Highly recommend to try this restaurant

I have visited this restaurant multiple times and my latest visit forced me to pen down some good words for this legendary restaurant. If you haven't been to Hatari, you have missed out something great. It's a very reputed and old food joint in South Kolkata, probably one of the best with the tastiest food ever. While the chicken and fish platters age delightful, one must also try out the pork platters. Hatari has also introduced a new menu and I must say it's quite interesting. The food quality is top notch, quantity is very good -- five of us went for dinner and we had ordered one plate of noodles, one plate of rice, lamb in chilli hoisin sauce, fish in chilli mustard sauce and chicken hot and sour soup. We couldn't even finish the rice. That's how much quantity you get. Have only one thing to say to the readers - just go and dine here.

I still remember the college days when we used to give birthday treats in this restaurant because they provide huge amounts and we hogged the delicious food within minutes! They make delicious kebabs, momos and crispy chilly baby corn. Also, Hatari is like your knight in shining armour when you're too tired of shopping in Gariahat and your tummy is empty.

Ordered shredded chicken for starters. But then we decided to have north Indian, so ordered chicken biryani. The starter was delicious. The biryani came in a pot containing rice, egg, chicken & my favourite - potato.. The quanity was generous. We also ordered salad & finally ended with Tutty Fruity because its my mother's favourite. Hatari takes some time to deliver as usual but the quality & quantity are always food. Price is a bit on high side but its worth it.

Hatari is a famous name down South. The popularity is such that they drag people from Salt Lake like us to try their food. Parking is a problem!
During weekends, the place is crammed with people, you have to wait in a queue. But they move real quick and ensure the waiting time is less. Their quantity was way more for two people. We had to get the extra portions packed. Prices are okay. Coming to the food, we went to try their duck. It was on the chewy side but really liked their pork, chicken dishes!

Hatari is that 1 place that will never fail to delight you.¬†
My cousins, friends have long been loyal to Hatari and we can vouch for this place anytime.

Food: 4.5/5 - They make phenomenal Chinese & North Indian food. Each item will make you crave for more.

Portion: 5/5 - Hatari is also famous for the portion sizes. One serving is almost equal to 1.5 - 2 servings of other restaurants.

Price: 5/5 - Absolutely reasonable.

Service: 4.5/5 - Great.

Ambiance/Decor: 3.5/5 - Moderate.

Please take some time in hand on weekends. You will find a long queue along the narrow balcony. Waiting time can range from 15 mins - 1 hour. Sometimes even more! ¬†Some might find the place little congested & noisy, given their full house status almost all the time.

Do try their Pan fried chilli fish, Crispy golden prawn, Chicken Lollypop, Szechuan prawn from the Chinese section.

Do not miss the Butter naan, Chicken Tikka Masala & Special Chicken/Mutton Biriyani from the North Indian section.

Highly Recommended!!!

Some things get better with time- this phrase perfectly goes with Hatari. This place is here for ages but still scores high on their food and service.

Interior is large with seating arrangements for both family and couples, ignoring the stairs to the first floor.
Its better to get a reservation, else you have to wait for a while, while the polite and famous doorman of hatari arranges a seat for you.

Menu card is vast and we managed to taste quite a few items. Starting from sublime chicken clear soup, subtle honey chicken, golden fried prawns to juicy tandoori chicken and lot of other dishes..which I don't remember.
In main course this place specializes in duck and lamb recipe. We tried smoked lamb, teriyaki duck, Hunan chicken, mutton Rogan josh, etc. Hatari serves the rice in huge quantities but quality wise they are just above average.
In desserts we tried dark chocolate ice cream and hot brownie with vanilla ice cream.

Pricing is on the higher side with added vat.

Service is polite and helpful

Being newly getting into the eating arena, was looking for a place which is economical and at the same time doling out lip smacking food...someone in our group called out a name HATARI along came a set of adjectives mostly nice ones...why wait more we all packed ourselves hailing HATARI. Sorry for starting with the bad aspect but thats the only cons we found.I could not give it 4.5 just becos we as a family had to wait for more than an hour which was not very cool... When we entered the hunger meter was reading upwards...the good part was the waiters , servers were very eager to hear out of our queries... Also you have the option of chinese and indian both. In our group we had lovers of both the variations...After the wait everything else was satisfying experience , the serving time , quality food....the best part is which i cud see and impressed me was the way each and evry tables was being managed with equal
Importance..we all left the place happy and content and surely promise to come back sooner than later for yet another good treat.  The food items which made our day...
pan fried fish - lovely crispy outside and fish had no smell . Nicely cooked.
Chicken tandoori- again nicely tandoored and marinated to near perfection 
Chicken haka chowmin - nicely cooked strands of chowmin and good amount of chicken strips
Butter nun with 
Mixed fried rice with chicken in red sauce - perfect blend of spicy and tangy sauce with nicely cooked chicken. 
The day ends with a simple dessert sizzling brownie with ice creame...the brownie was soft.

We went to hatari on a friends birthday treat. Though the entrance was quite small. The ambience was good. And the services were also fast. The Chinese foods and as well as chicken dishes and pork dishes were equally good. The quantity of all dishes are worthy according to price. The biriyani was too good. It was an nice experience.

Sorry guys....I do not want to stir up a hornet's nest but this was some of the most disappointing Chinese food I have had for a long long time. This might be in contrast to most of the reviews here, but even I was surprised in the end by most of it. We made a table reservation, so waiting was not a big issue. The ambience was ok.....a bit too crowded and a lot of noise for my liking. 
Let's get down to the food....Pan fried chilly fish was too sweet for our liking. The Chicken chowmein had too much of egg and the chicken faded away in its presence. Chef's special chicken.....again more of sweet and sour chicken. Veg. Manchurian did not have the flavours of a Manchurian dish. The Fried Rice was ok to say the least. Crispy chilly babycorn was standard. 
No complaints regarding the service.....it was very good. The amount served in each dish was exhilarating but doesn't help much if the taste is not up to the mark. This was a visit here after a long time and in the end turned out to be a disappointment. Bengali version of Chinese food tastes better than what we served this day. Opinions might vary but I would rather call a spade.... a spade.

Located very close to triangular park this ia a chinese and mughlai restaurant. About this particular outlet its spacious with good area. We went on a weekday afternoon and it was almost full. Coming to the food we had chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chilli chicken. The quantity is good and you can again trust me on this because me and my girl are good eaters. The chilli chicken could have been a bit better i guess. The chicken portion was a bit less and i guess has room for improvement. But if you want a decent chinese joint with reasonable pocket pinch opt for it. Stay blessed cheers..

The most crowded place when ever I've visited. Probably, the only restaurant in Gariahat region who has been able to uphold their standard n integrity of Food since the last decade in a 'comfortable to all pocket' way, along with sufficient quantity that most of the time customers found as excess. No matter whether Indian or Chinese or Oriental, all have their separate identity in terms of taste, aroma n delicacy! Service is equivalently good, but dear all, please do come here n hold patience while being in the queue since patience has always yielded u the best fruit.

As a must have option, Thai Lamb, Chilli Pork, Egg wrapped rice are some of the delicacy we have ordered for most of the time. Reason is the taste that moulded the taste buds so well that it attracts to that same taste like anything. 

We look forward to see some more outlets in the future days so that we r not kept away from the best for too long in the queue.

I have fond memories of visiting hatari as a kid with my parents and later with my friends from the time I started going to college. Now I hear there are multiple outlets of it all over the city, this one however holds a special place in my heart. It is located at triangular park. One needs to climb a flight of stairs which look dingy but be don't be fooled by it because the restaurant looks nothing like that. It is well lit, spacious and more often than not one needs to stand in a queue to secure a table. The waiting time goes berserk during festival season causing one to wait for as long as 2-3 hours. Such is the demand. The staff is very well versed with the menu, extremely courteous and helpful. They pioneer in Chinese. I love their Cantonese noodles, Manchurian, Chicken in oyster sauce, drums of heaven. They make north Indian as well. I have tried the kababs and the biryani. Both are good. The quality is always satisfactory and the quantity is ample. However one tiny glitch, the price of the food has shot up over the past couple of years. I understand it is probably because of the VAT and other taxes. However the escalation of price has been too steep to ignore and often makes one think twice before visiting the place, specially for college goers who can't afford it as often as they could previously.

Well we reached there like 1:45pm and the restaurant was full..it would have been nice if the host by the door would try to speak a bit nicely rather than rudely explaining we don't have table right now you have to wait...i know its sunday afternoon and its quite a popular restaurant as myself coming from the same hospitality industry 'GUEST IS ALWAYS RIGHT'... otherwise we all enjoyed the food and service...thank you..

Great food, and generous servings. Went there with my friends and ordered Fried Rice and Chili Chicken, AND a certain "Mongolian Chicken" on the suggestion of the person taking our order, because it would be something new, and in his opinion, worth trying. I wouldn't blame him - perhaps this dish would be a nice addition - but we love our food spicy, not sweet, and this Mongolian Chicken tasted sweet. We hadn't enquired about the details of the dish, and when we tasted it, we didn't like it at all.

Apart from that, we enjoyed our food. Our evening would have been better and I would have rated our experience 5.0 if not for the side, which we didn't like at all.

1st tym Im at this place. Totally family restaurant.. I've ordered fish finger, chilli pork dried nd chichen noodles. Fish fingers n porks were awesome in taste. Quantity of Pork dish nd noodles were more than enough for me nd my hubby. Services was equally good to remember. Had a great experience.

One of the best family restaurants in terms of quantity, quality, ambience and service. Serves both Chinese and Indian. The quantity per plate is more than adequate. 

My favourite dishes:
Crispy Chicken
Konjee crispy lamb ( amazing! )
Fish in red wine sauce
Cantonese noodles.

This (triangular park one) is a all time favourite place. Never disappoints. Came here after five years and again going back all happy. Ordered crispy fish, mixed fried rice and green pepper red chilli lamb. Loads a meat, delicious taste. Each and every bit were mouth watering. Ended with a tutty fruity as always. Can't wait to come back again.

I may request them, if 2 people r visiting drop the quantity by one layer. There had been not a single time I have not parcelled or wasted food in hatari. I will always rate 10 out of 10 for the quantity they serve. Thai noodles with prawn tossed in red wine was a nice combo. Unfortunately duck was not available though it was mentioned in the menu. One request on that note, please update the menu as per the availability.

I would give Hatari 5 if only the waiting experience could be a little better. However their consistence with excellent food is amazing. Tried the Thai soup. It was absolutely right with the right amount of crabmeat prawns and the tanginess. Post this we tried the crispy fish which was greatly done. Amongst their Kebabania promo we tried the Fish Amritsari kebab, Chicken shola kebab and another type. The kebabs too were done well. No wonder why the place is always chock-a-block with patrons.

I've grown up eating in this place. Recently visits became less frequent as I'm away.
Hatari, this restaurant has its own glory.
Almost all the time I had to wait to get a table. During pujas the waiting part becomes painfully prolonged.
Last time we were here, we started with reshmi kebabs. Then mixed fried rice, sanghai chicken. Ended with fresh lime soda and vanilla float. Nothing new to say about dishes. They are maintaining their quality of food and service ever since.
Bottomline standard place to get quality foods.

I don't remember how many times i have been to this outlet of Hatari!!! Sometimes with "S" and some of the times with friends and family but they have never disappointed us with their hospitality and food...
Even in weekdays of you reach after 8:30 then you have to wait for alteast 30-40 mins for sure as it is a hugely famous place in Gariahat belt...
Though they prepare Indian as well but i love their Chinese preparations...And the best part is they serve you oven hot food with great service...The attendants are quiet known to us now and give special attention towards their existing clients...
Really impressed and surely will recommend...üëç

Nice ambience with good decorations. We ordered a chicken starter(Sadly i forgot the name), which tastes good with slight smoky smell. Then we ordered Special Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Do Piyaja... both were very good. Actually biriyani is an item which is criticised most of the time by the foodie... but as per my opinion Hatari achieved their goal to a very satisfactory level... I find it very tasty.. Finally the pocket pinch.. yes it bit costly, but i think worthy enough.

One of my favourite place for Chinese. This restaurant is specialist in Chinese dishes, Indian dishes are also good. I had Chicken fried-rice, Sanghai Chicken, Chilli Prawn, Prawn balls in sweet and sour sauce. The prawn dishes are so tasty.The quantity served is really great. Foodies will be so delighted. The tastes are exquisite. The prices are a bit high but would say they are worth the quality and quantity. The aura will make you quite comfy with slight and elegant lighting. I wish to go there more often and try new items more and more.

One of the oldest, most preferred restaurants and the most happening places in South Kolkata. Be it any party, celebration, delivery, festival, they have always proved to be outstanding. Best for chinese, but north indian is up to the marks and expectations.. I had been there several times on several occassions... Had organised treats n parties as this place turns out to be budget friendly for a group lunch or dinner.. Schezwan chicken, hunan chicken, fried rices.. Noodles.. Prawn dishes , lemon fish , thai fish, chilly garlic fish, These are one of the best dishes i have ever had.. Biriyani quantity wise is great.. Only thing is its so full of crowd everytime, you have to stand a long time during peak hours to enter. And the place is too small to stand outside for a long time.. Rest all is fine.. Service superb.. Ambience is a thumbs up..

I went to this place last year at saptami with a friend. We had to wait a long time as it was puja time. Finally we entered the resturant. It was cosy inside and the staffs were very friendly.
We ordered crispy chicken for starters, for the main course we ordered hakka noddles and chicken in red wine. The chicken pieces were big and taste was totally outstanding! And there is nothing to say about the quantity as its totally worth the money. We were full so didn't even think to order desserts! Looking forward to visit this place again! :)

Also we ordered one veg fried rice and chicken dish. That combined good. The amount of the dishes are more than enough for two people. The rice was tasteful..the chicken was yummy. We had to pack leftover food for home. The staffs are quite helpful,good ambiance...atlast a happy tummy. That's all matters.

Really clean and service is really quick. Quality of the food is top notch. And the amount they give you is too much! Perfect for a family get-together. A huge range of items are available and never have I seen them run out of a particular dish. I've visited this joint multiple times and never been disappointed. Pricing is reasonable. Neither is it too pocket friendly nor does it burn a huge hole in your pocket. Really nice place.

Wonderful place from all aspect : quality of food, quantity of food, taste, price, ambience everything. I've been visiting this place from my schooldays and they've never failed to live up to my expectation. My all time favourite here is the Cantonese Chicken, Pork and the Duck Wings which is a must have for me whenever I visit this place. Even the price of the items are not too high to burn a hole in your pocket. A word of caution for the first time visitors, the quantity is huge so don't order individual plates for everyone as you might find it a little difficult to finish all. The only drawback is the waiting time is sometime too high, just beyond imagination and you've to wait in the narrow lane outside the restaurant which is really uncomfortable, otherwise it's one of the best restaurants I've been to in South Kolkata.

Food is delicious though I have tried only few of there dishes but I liked all of them. Specifically Mongolian Chicken dry in starter was mouthwatering. Sanghai chicken was also good. Chicken prawn fried rice was Ok type. But what I really hate about triangular park Hatari is the outside waiting in this hot summer. It's always crowded in the weekends. Anyway overall experience is good.

Okay, so here I come again this time to write for Hatari.. Me being a diehard fan of chinese cuisine.. hatari is surely amongst my topmost preferences among the restaurants that make me indulge in the chowmein and chopsticks.. Being located close to Gariahat this is a convinient option for me and my gang during the puja pandal hopping sessions.. been there twice in the last couple of years.. Drums of Heaven, Chicken In Red Wine, Shanghai Chicken, Hot Garlic chicken, Mixed Chowmeiy personal favourites.. ¬†the ambience is also quite refreshing and enjoyable..¬†
Now, coming to the drawbacks, the only one is a looong like a really long queue at the puja times.. sometimes it exceeds 2 hours.. but the food will surely be worth the wait.. i would recomend it to the the chineseloving foodies surely..

My love for Hatari is undying. I have cued up behind those doors on many weekends for as long as I can remember. For me and my parents back then, Hatari was the comfort den and their food, the ultimate happy resource we looked forward to. Not much different now, either.

I have always been a bigger fan of the Chinese food served by the place, in comparison to their Indian affairs. It is sincerely a nice feeling to get back to those comforting and never changing flavors.

Hatari has always been recognized for two things:-
1. Their superior quality of food.
2. Their huge quantities.
The best part is none of these qualities have been compromised upon, even today.

The introduction of their new oriental menu, a couple of years back is an additional reason that has led to the increasing popularity of this iconic restaurant among the modern restaurant hoppers in the city, who are always looking for some very fine and new flavors to devour.

My personal favorites from their special oriental menu are the Keong's Chicken, crunchy fried chilli chicken, spicy dragon fish, sliced fish in chilli oyester basil sauce, prawn in chilli black beans sauce, and a lot more.

Apart from the dishes mentioned above, the usual dishes from the regular menu are a delight as well. Some of the favorites from that list, include- the chicken sweet corn soup, crispy chilli mushroom, fish and chips, hot pepper fish, drums of heaven, Mongolian chicken, Mandarin fish, Cantonese noodles and the list goes on.

If you are anywhere around the Triangular Park area and searching for a great place to dine in, Hatari is the best place to drop by. To top it all, the service is fast and even if there is a long line of people waiting to get in, the management is quite communicative, which helps avoiding any kind of problems.

Hatari is like my childhood restaurant.
I am going to Hatari since I was in class 5 or 6.
They serve very good Chinese though I feel the service has gone down recently.
I have tasted a lot of items from the menu. My favourite being the Mixed Cantonese Noodles, Thai Chicken Fried Rice, Garlic Fish and Pepper Chicken.
Recently I tried their Korean Noodles and the Roasted Chilli Pork.
The pork tasted amazing.
Though I didn't like their Pork Ribs much.
But all in all, it's a nicely decorated place serving good food.

Though I have been to this place quite a few times earlier but this review of mine is based on my take away order.

So I will only talk about the food

Mongolian Chicken Dry - Your tastebuds will surely going to like this as starter. Bit crispy, dry and bit spicy.
Chicken Prawn Fried Rice - Nothing to say more about this common dish. Only along with quality, they have maintained their quantity.
Egg Fried Rice - I would say go for Mixed rather than only egg.
Chicken with Vegetable - This is very light dish in white sauce with brocolli, carrort and other vegetables.
Chilli Duck - This is duck with bone dish but to be honest i would recommend shredded duck rather than this dish

Next time when I visit them will provide the review of the ambience, staff and decors.

Chinese Bliss to the Taste Bud‚Äù¬†
It was a saturday Chinese Lunch programme with my friends and it started well with the Spicy awesome soup "Tam Yam Khung".....then we proceeded to the sweet and tangy tasty "Pan fried chilly fish "......slurp slurp!!!!! and liked this starter item so much that we decided to continue with starters for that day , so it was a "NO MAIN COURSE" lunch day for us.So next items were "Darbaari fish Kabab" and "Dry chilly Pork"from the starter menu.

Food is good here, but all items are slightly inclined to sweetness...which is not acceptable to the taste bud like the dry CHILLI pork sud have been more spicey rather than tasting sweet. And my all time favourite FRESH LIME SODA was the saviour after this DRY SWEET Pork dish.

Foods were so amazing everytime I visit, although fish in hot garlic sauce didn't go with my taste..again this Durgapuja I visited and had crispy fish which was good, red wine chicken just made my day, I fell in love with the dish and mix fried rice with fresh lime soda. Everything was great as everytime...  it was all great and recommended everyone to visit

I visited this place twice is one month. Yes that's right. That is only because I fell in love all over again with the food here. A multi-cuisine by name, they live upto their the food they serve. From Indian to Chinese they excel in everything. Chicken Tandoori is sublime. Chinese is light. The mixed fried rice come with a whole bunch of prawns and is a complete winner. I tried the Chili Garlic Crab, and it's the best crab I've had in a while. Also, one must not miss the Tutty Fruity for dessert. It is absolute value for money and economic. Portions for every dish is huge eg, one rice is enough for three. The ambience is great. However, it is always a hustle. You might have to wait in the queue to get in on weekends. I think I've found my go to place whenever I want to hog on a lot of happy food! :)

For me their Fried Rice is the best in town. At times i don't even need a side dish. I think there fried rice should be included in the list of recommended dishes. And their quantity is huge... i mean its enough for 2ppl and sometimes 3as well. Among the side dishes I usually prefer to go for lamb( chilli lamb) which is delicious. On the other hand i don't like their cantonese noodles. Never tried their Indian Dishes so can't say much about them. The place is easy to locate.. just oppo of triangular park. The ambience is very good enough and the service is satisfactory. The prices are not very cheap but then again the quantity of food they serve is sufficient for 2 people... so that evens up.

Although we had to wait 30 min outside for our turn, but it was DEAN CHATER who made our day. He made us comfotable so we can have our lunch properly. Great hospitality provided. Thanks again had a great supper. Cheers & best of luck in coming future.

Hatari is a tried and tested food joint for Chinese lovers in the city. The ambience is good, and so is the crowd. The setting is also impressive. The servers are pleasant and helpful,and they will guide you well about the amount of order you should place. While your first look at the menu will give you the idea that it is a fairly expensive place, let me assure you that the quality of each dish is quite good. A single plate of rice can easily be shared by two. So, it fits well in your budget. Yes, there are any options for Chinese food these days. So, perhaps, Hatari needs to up its game slightly when it comes to food. But overall, my experiences here have always been pleasant.

I visited two of their outlets. One in Behala and other one in Gariahat. The taste is authentic. But somehow I didn't like some of their main courses.

Very old food joint in South Kolkata. Ambience is not their strong point. Usually overcrowded with people talking loudly. But the quality of food makes up for that. The food on offer does not disappoint. Add to it the immense quantity of the food. The crispy chilli baby corn was itself so filling that we had to pack portions of the main course and carry it back home. The service is good and attentive. Though some of their recommendations can go wrong, but that is okay. Overall good food, both in terms of quality and quantity.

Hatari is one of those finest restaurants in kolkata which never fails to be at it's best anytime you go. A very well decorated, courteous behavior of their staffs, awesome quality of food and quantity is just more that enough for two. I remember having chicken gravy chowmin. It was yummy. Too good. It is undoubtedly one of the best restaurants in kolkata.

If you're looking for authentic Chinese food, you should come here without even batting an eyelid. Have been visiting this place for ages and each time has been as gratifying as the last. I love their mixed fried rice and all pork dishes. Chili duck is also delicious. The soups are lip smacking as well. Service is excellent. The d√©cor and ambience are very welcoming.

The only negative of this place according to me is the queue we have to stand in to eat here. Even on weekdays during lunch we had to wait.

But once in the service is good. They serve quality dishes in affordable cost. Quantity is also good. Have been eating here for a long time, so have tried almost all the dishes here. Liked almost all of them.

If you have some time in hand and want Chinese, this is the place to be if you are in Gariahat area.

Awesome ambience. Decor: Nice.
 food is delicious.
 Favorites include: Mixed noodles(with pork), Thai pork, all the fish dishes, lamb and mushroom. I hardly have chicken here..pocket pinch is on the higher side, but quality and quantity offered is really good. Highly recommended.

My friend and I went there on a Sunday. We were the first customer there on that day. As soon as a few people started coming in, it was evident that the waiters wanted us out of the place quickly, even though there were more than 7-8 tables empty at that time. We definitely felt uncomfortable at this kind of customer service.

Coming to the food, we ordered for Dry Chili Pork. It was undoubtedly tasty, but within 10 mins of consuming it I had a stomach ache. By that time the main course arrived - lamb and sea food fried rice. The lamb was stale. By the time we left, my friend also got a stomach ache.¬†

I have been to Hatari more than 5 times, and this time I was visiting the place after 2 years. I do not know whether the standard of food has deteriorated or our case is an anomaly, but I will definitely not recommend this place to anyone.

Definitely a value meal in terms of quantity. The taste of the food itself is average. Some of the dishes are overly spicy (hot).

This was a really bad experience at the restaurant. Absolute callousness and negligence on part of the staff. We were a group of 14 and were enjoying the food. At the end we requested for a mutton dish. We were suggested masala mutton. We ordered. First bite into the mutton, it was cold from inside. (Heated food.) We requested for a change. Another plate comes in and to our utter surprise it was STALE. On being told that the dish was STALE the staff tried to prove it wasn't and in the meantime even started to talk in a imperious tone. This ruined everyone's mood
 Why can the staff not say that they cannot serve the dish??

This is a highly acclaimed food joint in South Kolkata. The chinese preparations are quiet good over here. One should try their Drums of Heaven, Mongolian Fish, Rice Noodles and Tangy Crispy Chicken.All the above mentioned dishes are tasty. The service is prompt. Their home delivery service is also quiet good and prompt. The staffs are also courteous and helpful.

I was at a friend's place to watch the India vs West Indies worldT20 seminal. We ordered Mongolian chicken, pan fried chilly fish and  chicken tandoori. 
The fish was really tasty and all the other stuff was also delicious. But the fish blew our minds. It was amazingly cooked. It was soft, smooth and almost melted in the mouth. Must try dish at hatari. Had a great time with friends, cricket and good food. :)

Let's stick to the facts on this. To start with it has a small entrance and a good number of stiff stairs to climb which may be a problem for the elderly. Coming to the eatery, not much of decor, they play some light music which has a nice feel, though. You will find a wide variety of meat on the menu. Food is average compared to the price though they provide sufficient quantity of it. They will also pack your food for take away at no extra cost if you can not eat it all.

What a gem of a place! From outside, it looks very run down and shabby, and normally I wouldn't enter such an establishment. Early January, my husband coaxed me into having lunch here, after shopping at Adi Dhakeshwari, R.B. Avenue. This place is quite close, just on the opposite side of the road.
While he kept on praising the place, about having great food here since he was a kid, I was very skeptical.

The ambiance is quite decent, and I was pleased to find the pace almost full with families and groups. The crowd was decent, and so was the decor. Food was way beyond my expectation, with big portions and good quality. Taste wise, 5 stars. The waiters are non intrusive but still helpful. We couldn't eat everything, and took away the rest (couldn't bear to leave behind such tasty food).

I'm guessing the old looking entrance has something to do with why this place doesn't have people waiting in queue outside :-)
Would definitely drop in again.

King of restaurants between Gariahat and Rashbihari.
¬†I visit this place for PORK. My recent visit was a bit disappointing. This time i really did not enjoy the food as i did on my previous 6 visits. The fish item was so so, the pork gravy noodles was very tasty but the pork side dish chili pork dry was a hard to chew. No complaints on quantity of food. I love eating in Hatari i tried many dishes previously, though the price is a bit high than is brother in Garia reason being the owner of garia is different.
Items tried :Mongolian Fish Dry, Chili Pork Dry, Pork Gravy Noodles.
Service is very good. ¬†I will definitely go once more as it made me happy 6 times earlier 1 time average quality can be taken under consideration. ;)

My Suggestion-Try the noodles with shredded chicken.

All time fab place of mine .... from collage days with stressed budget to parties, family get together Hatari checks in all the boxes... 

Price now has increased a lot .. can't be called a pocket friendly restrurent though, but the quantity still will bring smile back... 

Going there for 15 years now but hardly tried their indian food.. so can't  comment on that . 

Few things a must try 
1. Chicken saut√® with black mushrooms...( waiters will  discourage you as it takes some time )
2. Pan fried fish 
3. Momo ( :P) yes momo...may be its not authentic momo place ... but its yummy .. 
4. Fish fingers  and 5. Thai  chicken/ fish ( extreme spicy  but extremely yummy and addictive)
6. Chicken in red wine sauce.
7. Jumbo prawns , not a single jumbo prawn though ( its like a kfc's zinger patty... )

2 plate main course/ side dish  for 4 avarage eaters 

Approx Rs. 450 per person with for 3 course meal.. 

Happy eating 

Happy eating

We ordered the below items for take away and was blown away by the taste.
Veg Gravy Chowmein
-The noodles were non-sticky,long and nicely boiled. The gravy was also good and the portion size was sufficient for 2 people.

Chilli Chicken (Boneless)
-It was absolutely soft and melt in the mouth which is a rarely the case these days, all the more because we chose the boneless option.The portion size was good enough for 2-3 people though I would have wanted more gravy considering the number of pieces provided.

Chilli Prawn
-The prawn sizes were good and was flattened which was unusual.It was again soft and tasted very nice.The portion size was good enough for 2-3 people though I would have wanted more gravy considering the number of pieces provided.

Hot Garlic Prawn
-It was nice and spicy.The portion size was good enough for 2-3 people though I would have wanted more gravy considering the number of pieces provided.

Overall, a very good option for Chinese food, however the pricing is high.My rating is 4 based on the food since I cannot comment on the service and decor inside.

One of the oldest joints in South Kol which has yummy Chinese dishes. On my latest tryst with it, some of us colleagues decided on a takeaway order. We decided on mixed noodles, mixed rice, fried rice in ouster sauce, chilli garlic fish, Mongolian fish nd dry chilli pork. Each and every item on our order was simply heavenly! The highlights were Mongolian fish nd dry chilli pork. It was the best pork i have had in the recent past. As for the rice and noodles, the quantity of each plate was more than enough for 2. Will surely visit again üòä

I have been to Hatari numerous times, both this and the Behala outlet and the ambience is particularly welcoming, not to mention their exquisite chinese cuisine.Recently they have started making the Indian dishes as good as the rest and last week I had biriyani which was amazing, though a little less in quantity unlike fried rice or chow mein.
They have various types of dishes with different tastes and flavors and the menu is vast with diverse features.The service is quite good and the waiters are quite prompt and helpful.
The only thing which I wanted complain about is the spiciness of the spicy dishes. Normally I like quite spicy dishes and always order for them, but I was quite disappointed recently as its content was quite less.In fact Sanghai chicken which is one the examples, tasted quite sweet to me and I would like to point that the dishes which are marked spicy and tangy are not so at all.
Overall this is quite a reasonably priced restaurant and I would recommend it to others.

We are regulars in Hatari and often order chinese from this place,
Highly recommended - Pork in black bean sauce, ALl mixed non veg rice and noodle dishes, momos, sea food.
Thankfully many of the items are not batter fried and dunked in sauces. thankfully their sauces are not run of the mill sweet-sour tangy but have distict flavours.
Recommended item in Veg - black fungus and bok choy stir fried.
Given the quantities - quite pocket friendly , as in any chinese joint, larger groups better economy :)
i am not too familiar with thier non chinese food menu but they do serve indian food as well. Eating in the restaurant may not be the best experience due to the rush and theres not much in the ambience to enjoy , ordering is definitely the better choice here

I had been to the restaurant many a times for the past 7-8 years. keeping aside the regular chicken, fish, pork items even if I talk about the vegetarian preparation they make awesome crispy chilly baby corn and Chilly paneer not to forget about the quantity and quality of the food which is pretty good.

Well,we have been to this place innumerable times for the past 15-20 years.It is our go-to place whenever we have to treat a group of friends or order a takeaway when we have a large group at home.

We have tried out almost all of the vast menu,particularly their chinese.To me,they are the best in Kolkata style chinese.reasonable price,huge quantity,distinguishing taste for each dish and not the same kind of gravy,what  more does one want.

The service is prompt and friendly,considering the rush and the long queue at any time.we usually order on phone and pick it up at the designated time.They have never kept us waiting till date.For large orders they even waived off the container charges and offered us complimentary fresh lime sodas while we were there to pick up our orders.A very nice gesture,I must say. 

I will name my favourite dishes here,which we order again and again
Prawn fried rice:ultimate comfort food with lots and lots of prawn
Thai chicken:hot and sweet and spicy and tangy,this dry preparation of chicken can be had on its own.its finger licking good.
Sha cha chicken:chicken in hot barbque sauce,with a mild hint of sweetness,with loads of brocolli.
Chilli mustard fish-chunks of bhetki fillet in a tangy and spicy mustard sauce with heaps of bell pepper
Pan fried chilli garlic fish:the name says it all.It is the ultimate starter.
Thai soup:again a comfort food on a rainy evening.loaded with seafood,thick,with a hint of lemongrass.

The only reason I deducted .5 is that their Indian is simply not up to the mark.But try any dish in chinese,and you will not be dissappointed.

This is my 2nd visit to Hatari...the first outing was not a good memory. But this time i got to change my opinion about this place
It was a weekday... no Hatarish long que. We got our table instantly. There's nothing much to say about decor.. staffs r polite n helpful.
We orderd a chilly pepper chikn,mix hakka noodle & Gansu lamb(dint have much idea about it)
It took quite a lot of time for the food to arrive...n man it was worth waiting for!
The portions r huge i must say. Chilly pepper chkn was super spicy...thin blood red coating over soft chkn pieces with occasional grittiness of pepper in between...rab di kasam kan se dhua nikal gaya!
Mix noodle was also large in amount with plenty of chkn pork prawn in it. The lamb dish was okayish...it was cooked in sweet n sour gravy with tricolor capcicum n other veggies. The lamb was soft properly cooked n was complimenting the noodles.
Prices are slightly on the higher side but considering the large amounts it shudnt b a problem for a group of 4-5.
Fiiled with rejoice by the quality n quantity i certainly have desire to revisit.

Hatari is a legend. And yet, their food resembles a variation of Chinese usually served in stalls or canteens for one quarter their price. Most of their dishes can be categorised into two tastes - tangy, spicy and red, or batter fried. The batter fried variant is generally better. For those who like spicy Chinese, and large quantities of the same, this is the place to go. I like my food nuanced, the flavours subtle, its quality impeccable. Hatari is not for me.

Special mention for the pork dishes and the chicken chopsey. The quantity size is also great.

Though it delivers different cuisines but the Chinese here is unparalleled. The dishes are mouthwatering and costs deservedly correct. The ambience is just fine. So, if you're ready to spend and want to peep into the delightful Chinese cuisine, hatari is the heaven in earth for you.

One of the most popular places to have Chinese in Calcutta. It's mainly very attractive to youngsters because of its affordable prices. 
However the quality of food varies from time to time. On my last visit I had tried Thai chicken and was pleasantly surprised. But next time when I ordered the same, it was not that impressive. Infact it was so spicy and hot that we couldn't finish the whole dish. 
Also the honey chicken looked and tasted like pineapple chutney! 
Still if u keep these points aside, the place has a really nice ambience and u will surely enjoy if u r out there with your friends and family.

With a decent ambience and quite reasonable price to quantity (and quality) ratio this place is a sharer. The food and the hospitality is such one wouldn't consider taking this place as a one time visit. Since 2006 this place has been our dining place almost every alternate weekends so more or less every dishes have been tried out. However the personal favourites stick to the crispy chicken for starters, mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken for main course with the recent addition of chilli pork and General Tao's Chicken in their menu. Overall this is a nice place if one's looking for a family get together or sorts. The above factors make it really crowded so good luck with the queue. I'd recommend going to this place if you haven't before. Peace.

Okay so, hatari and I go back a long way! I was in class 10 when I had first eaten here. But sadly hatari has changed over the past few years. The food quality and quantity remains the same - as amazing as ever. But the price, burns a hole right through your pocket now. I still remember the time when pork fried rice used to be charged 90 bucks, but now! Okay, I understand that times are changing but still, such a hike in prices is really uncalled for. 2 weeks back my friend and I had to visit this place as other Chinese joints were not open, and god, we felt looted. We had ordered dry chilli potato, mixed fried rice and chilli garlic chicken and it amounted to 900 something. I mean, why would I pay so much?! However the food tastes amazing and the quantity is overwhelming. Still, disappointed.

Had to change my review after yesterday's visit. This time I planned on munching some starters and glug in their best soup. Hence I decided to have:

Soup: Lung Fong Soup...... Almost Thai soup with egg whites (Awesome preparation), 
Starters: 1) Tangy crispy chicken, 2) Keong 's chicken, 3) Threaded chicken and 4) Mongolian Fish. 

1) Tangy crispy was synonymous to pan fried (blah blah blah...) ‚úÇ 
2) Keongs chicken carried different flavour, which I think would have suited prawn rather than chicken in it. But, we all liked it. 
3) Threaded Chicken - Snack that made our evening...... Cool serving, girls liked it üòÜ. Preparation - well let's keep it a mystery.... Y don't you try and leave a comment after my review. 
4) Mongolian Fish - (Basha Fish) Again synonymous to pan fried preparation... 

Whatever be it, that we were served we were close to ecstatic, discovering such well cooked (& presented) dish at such a price. (I would say priced appropriately)

An excellent place for chinese. The food is awesome and the whole menu is top notch. I had been introduced to the place by my uncle. I had always been fond of pork n duck and this place came across as a treasure chest of good and affordable chinese food. 

Located on  Rashbshari Avenue, This place is easily accessible. The only downside is that sometimes you might have to wait for getting a seating. 

The chiili pork is really tasty and is a must try for people who like pork. The rice noodles is also really good. Food quantity and pricing complement each other. Overall the place is really a good place to go and have a good Chinese Lunch/Dinner

In starters we had 6 different types. Main course we had two choices: chicken noodles/rice and in side dish we have again 5 different food items. We even had butter naan and mixed vegetables and soup too. And to end the day we have sweet lime soda.

Hatari is hands down one of the best restaurants for Chinese cuisine that I have been to in the city. Their mixed hakka chowmein (with or without pork, as per taste), their chicken with mushroom, their canton chicken...absolutely delicious!! And the amount they give in each plate is enough to feed an army! Well, it is enough to feed four people well anyway...
Hatari also has a few unconventional items like duck meat on their menu. Although that is a little too fibrous for my taste, I know people who swear by their honey duck.

Their staff are helpful and efficient, especially their manager, who is often seen behind the billing counter is an extremely friendly person.¬†
Hatari also serves Indian food, however I will recommend their Chinese every time.

Have been going here for ages, be it after an intense shopping session at gariahat or be it for some friend's birthday treat. And gradually, this place has asked to the changing food scene by incorporating changes in the menu, in the decor, opening branches and everything. So it is one of those old eateries which is not outdated and still attracts me. 

Their Thai lamb is my absolute favorite but almost everything they serve is tasty. Also, they are known for their generous portions. However, if it's a holiday, brace yourself for a long queue outside.

This used to be the one and only outlet in the city, until they decided to open a few more. Located near Triangular Park and Hindusthan Park - Gariahat, this is an extremely popular and busy restaurant, so try only if you have a lot of time to spare for waiting in the queue. However you won't be disappointed once you are done dining after all that wait. Hatari gives you a pleasurable experience. The prices are a touch high, but at the same time, they also serve great quantity which makes up for it. I liked the partially renovated interior of this place, during my recent visit. The waiters are well behaved.

Must try starter - Chicken Shola Kebab. Beautifully spiced. Buttery and soft. Just melts in our mouth. Sumptuous, to say the least.

Their Mutton Biryani is pretty good. Not much of oil content, has a dry feel to it. Sufficient quantity. If you order one special biryani, it should suffice 2 average eaters. Fish Kadai gave me a feel of fish mashed with flour. Tasted good somehow.

Hatari is a reliable restaurant. Value for money. Recommended.

I love the thai chicken. It goes really good with the rice with boiled vegetables combo.

Mentioning any particular item is difficult given the fact that i have been visiting this place for years now.
Overall- good food, good pricing. It tends to have a long queue on weekends though.

We were all waiting to visit this place. And yesterday we got a chance to come at this place. We knew we had to wait for around 30-45mins and we did so.
Now the ambience was good.we all enjoyed.
We have ordered chilli lamb(dry),chicken Mongolia and drums of heaven for starters. All the items were very tasty.
For main course we ordered mixed fried rice,mixed hakka noodles,Thai chicken curry,chef's special chicken and brown glazed duck.
The rice and noodles tasted yum.
We dint like the Thai chicken curry. It smelled bad and the gravy was not good.
And the duck also.it was as if saute in sauce and then served.
One thing is commendable and that is the quantity is very good.
Order should be placed wisely.
The waiters were all well behaved and friendly.

Hatari is one of the most well known restaurants among the student circle. Though the food is far from cheap, it is modestly priced. The Quality of the food is a huge point in the favour of the restaurant. I visited this restaurant recently after a long time and was glad to see the interior decor had improved considerably since my last visit. The service however still leaves much to be desired with the staff ignoring the order and giving you what they "suggest". The Chili pork is one of the best I have had anywhere in the city. If the waiter's were a bit more polite this restaurant would rate a definite 5 star.

I just¬†love their food. They are equally good in chinese and north indian. Their mixed fried rice and dry chilli lamb are my favourite.. Brilliantly made.¬†On the other hand, their Indian dishes are pretty good. Although my recent experience says they need to serve better quality and well cooked mutton in biryani.¬†The prices are on the higher side but their food quality and quantity balances that part.. it also offers nice cozy ambience. I find this outlet better than the behala one. If I have to choose, I will surely go for Chinese.

Ambience is okay, but when we went, the AC next to our table was not working so it was very hot. There is always a long queue in front of the restaurant, but service is fine. We ordered crispy chicken but it was not very crispy, rest of the food however was ok.

A great restaurant! I can't count the number of times I've been here. Right from childhood, my very introduction with Chinese food had been at Hatari. The gravy chow Mein, the fried rice, the sweet n sour chilli chicken, Thai chicken, fish Manchurian, schezuan dishes and many many more.... All are great! I had biryani only once and that was great too! However, I recommend this place for Chinese mainly. The price used to be very pocket friendly, but has been hiked considerably nowadays. The quantity has reduced. The quality has also downgraded a bit, it still remains good though! However, I still wish that the authorities take a look at at the quality once again to ensure we get what we used to at hatari earlier. Increase of prices and downfall of quantity and quality together cannot be tolerated!

I have been visiting Hatari since my school days way back in 2007. Great Chinese food at great price and huge quantity. Home deliveries are also timely, usually with in an hour. For starters Keong's Chicken and Konjee Crispy Lamb are a must try. Mongolian Chicken is a great side dish which goes well with any kind of spicy fried rice like Szechuan or Hunan rice. Overall a great restaurant, nice ambience and awesome food.

They do justice to whatever they serve. The quantity per plate is for 2 people, for any dish you order. The pocket pinch is manageable, wont hurt, after judging by the quantity and taste of food.
Now coming to the food, most are likely to enjoy it. I am not biased nor will I say its the best, but really commendable tasty food, well informed waiters, nice ambience. Only negative aspect of Hatari @ triangular park is their low seating capacity, so one might expect to have to wait before getting a seat. Please go ahead and try. I loved their mixed rice noodles and pork with mushroom. Will visit again.

(29/12/2015) Dropped in again, and my expectations for this restaurant are rising with each visit... This time we ordered chicken special biriyani and red garlic lamb. Both were awesome and sumptuous. So no complaints.. Only praises for u guys. Keep up the good work!

Though centrally located and quite near to my house, this was my first visit to Hatari. We visited just after the Durga Puja and had to wait for 45 minutes to get a seat. The wait was worth it when the food arrived. We had ordered Crispy Chicken as starter and the quantity in one plate is good enough for three people. In main course we had ordered Szechuan Mixed Rice Noodles and Fish in Oyster Sauce. Here also, the quantity was very satisfactory. The rice noodle was mildly spiced and tasted really good in itself or with the oyster sauce gravy. The fish fillets however smelled a little too fishy. The staff is polite and courteous but the decor is ordinary and a little staid. Considering the reputation of this place, a little makeover in decor will be a welcome change.

Okay, so I had to delete my previous review and write a new one, because of the recent most experience with Hatari.¬†
I went there a couple of months back, and tried things mostly from the oriental menu. It was a great change to my palate, as I am sick n tired of eating the typical Chinese dishes. I ordered - SQUID PEPPER SALT & PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH for the starters, and NASI GORENG, GHANSU LAMB & SLICED PORK IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE .. I must say each and every item was satisfying and Huge, I mean HUGE in quantity.¬†
I am glad that my old love for Hatari has come back, and I will visit more to indulge into that Oriental menu, which according to me is the best thing that happened to Hatari.

Now this is a place for Chinese cuisine lovers. It holds for a special mention for the 'Thai Chicken' and the 'Wanton Chicken'  that they serve. They made some additions to their menu with Oriental dishes being included along with sea food dishes.  Would want to try the fish they serve. 

Their staff members are not very friendly and always expect to be tipped,  which can be irritating at times.  I have even seen them misbehave and pass comments for not being tipped. 

Twice the main course chicken served was not at all warm.  They said they made it earlier with the starter, which to me sounds to be a dumb logic.

But still I will suggest this place for the only reason that the food is good.

I seriously din't understand why there's so much of hype about Hatari after my visit two weekends back. We ordered for dry chilli pork,  Singaporean noodles and Mongolian chicken. The chilli pork and noodles were okayish but we din't like the chicken. Quantity was good enough to serve for two people sufficiently but     owing to the taste it could have been much better. Kolkata provides a lot of good options for having Chinese food and I don't think one needs to come here to have chinese.

I went there last month and I somehow missed writing my review on this place. It was my friend's bday treat and we were 10 person in total. 4 veg & 6 non veg who went.
I found that this place is quite renowned amongst the Bengalis as the restaurant was power packed even on a working day with most of them. 
Table reservation is Highly Recommend.
Coming to the reviews.

We 4(veg) ordered Hot & sour soup to start with. It was a decent one but the quantity that they serve you even in 1/2 bowl was Mind Blowing. Then we found babycorn better than the Chilli Potato.
However, after ordering the main course (North Indian) and having them we found that this restaurant is truly meant for the Non Vegetarian's. They have LOT for you guys!! 
Less recommended for my vegetarian pals.

Surrounding is good, waiters are also humble and attentive. Its just that the once your order is placed waiting time is high as this restaurant  remains full mostly. That's all!!

Will love to hear your views zomatorians!!

The quality of the food is pretty good but the best thing about this place is the quantity, like one plate of their Mixed Hakka/Gravy Noodles or Mixed Fried Rice is enough for two people, other items that I have tried are the roast chilli pork and chicken in oyster sauce among others. If one is looking for decent quality food with good quantity per plate, then this is one of the best places to go.

I've been coming here for almost 10-12 tears now. Over the years hatari has become extremely expensive and the food hasn't taken as big a leap as the money we pay for it. Thats not to say that the food is bad in any way but only that at these prices, it wouldn't be absolutely unfair to expect a little more or a little better.

Now if Zomato says it's a legendary restaurant it has reasons! You dont become a legend over night , you have to earn that title! This place has earned it and earned it right! The best Chinese i have had. Hatari really defines the concept of a family restaurant! Come in groups of 8s or 10s. ..order lots of food without being anxious about the quality because each one of them tastes splendid ... sit back ..relax ...enjoy the food without burning a hole in you pocket and go back HAPPY AND SATISFIED!
It's spacious and old, with pale walls and won out sofa covers but the food compensates for all faults! Chicken, shrimp, lamb, duck, chopsuey , noodles , rice.... even the Indian dishes taste remarkably good!
Just have sufficient time at your hand and come prepared for the queue and ... if it's during the durga puja .... may the Goddess help you find a seat! ;)

We had chicken sweet corn soup, mongolian chicken, crispy chilly babycorn, egg fried rice, sweet and sour chilly chicken, szechuan paneer. The porportions were really great (we shared 3 bowls of rice, which was more than enough). The ambience was also very good and the staffs were really helpful.

This place needs no introduction.... For the Chinese food lovers (jzt like me), this place is like Mecca... Hardcore foodie residing in Kolkata yet not visited this place?? That is someone hard to find.. I know very few people who have not eaten a Hatari..¬†
This restaurant which is a favorite of a very large section of people.. The only thing that irks me is waiting time.. But that is understandable taking into account the popularity of the place which is situated in triangular park.¬†
A tad bit of expensive but the quality n quantity of food served by this old legendary restaurant is enough to taste your appetite..¬†
Hatari better known for its Chinese preparations but also serves North Indian cuisine.. A Special note for the authentic Chinese food lovers must visit this place for a complete idea of how Indo-chinese cuisines should taste like.. This place caters to foodies across various geners.. On a recent visit I had tried out their Mongolian chicken.. N its awesome.. But all n above I must say lamb is the show stopper .. With the ample space it's the best hangout spot for groups and family..

I recently visited the Gariahat outlet with my friends and as it was Durga puja, we had to wait for more than one and a half hours for our turn. moreover the guy attending us seemed to be very pissed. Don't it was us or he had a bad day but he was kind of rude. it looked like he wanted to get rid of us as soon as possible. Bad Customer service I must say. I didn't have much expectation with the food as well but I was wrong as even the veg dishes but nicele prepared. Looks like the kitchen was not experiencing a bad day afterall.

I am a frequent visitor of this place. Conveniently located, pocket friendly. The portion is quite good. It will be really economical when you go in group. Almost all dishes are good, can try anything, but be careful about the amount, as u may end packing up more parcels more than food you have there. Crispy chicken is a must try as starter

Murphy's Law has been playing a tricky part in my restaurant visits over the past few weeks. Which ever ones I had huge expectations came out as a dampener. Its like SRK movies over the past few years. Myself and my girl, had tried to visit Hataari during a puja afternoon, but having looked at the crowd, we decided on coming up later. Hence visited yesterday afternoon, and after waiting for 10mins was called inside in.

1. Chicken Mushroom soup : This was something beyond recognition. Was it a soup, or was it boiled chicken shreds and mushroom dipped into boiling water? Guaranteed you can have this while having jaundice.

2. Chicken Noodles: Chinese desi style. We discussed over how it reminded me of ghar ka noodles where you put in carrot slices. It was moderate in taste

3. Thai Chicken with Cashew Nut : I expected it to be prepared in the way it was. But given the sweetness quotient, it could easily be a dessert

4. Tsui Chicken: The chicken pieces reminded me of road side stalls which sells pakoras worth rs. 10. Huge ball of meat, with practically no flavor inside of it was something I didn't expect

Overall it's a disappointment. Given the number of Chinese joints in the city now and china-town being an all time fav, Hatari is only a good option if you are extremely hungry and you care only about quantity and not of quality.

Hands down one of the all time best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. The quality and quantity of each dish is quite the same over the years, which others might learn from them. They have a huge range of delicacies in their menu but My personal choice is their Duck and Lamb dishes. What delicious and delicate meat!! I am not a soup person but I always find their Soups pretty amazing in taste, Minus the queue on the weekends, everything about this place is amazing. But trust me it's worth the wait. :)

The USP of this place is its quantity. The price is very justified given the quantity and quality served. You have to stand in line whenever you go to this restaurant which is a little tedious. The service is average but overall, this place pleases the taste buds and also does not dig a hole in your pocket.

This was my first visit to Hatari. Yes...being a resident of Kolkata, I have never been here before. Though I must say, I have heard a lot about this place from different people and a lot of good reviews from fellow foodies. ¬†Well, coming to the food, I can't say it was awesome but owing to the time I went to this place (Durga Puja) it was pretty decent compared to other food joints serving similar cuisines. The pricing is also reasonable (will not make a hole in your pocket). The service was also pretty quick compared to the rush that they were having. Overall it was a pretty good experience and they did not disappoint the family. Will visit again when I am in the city.

If you are fond of Indian style Chinese food and still you haven't visited this place then you are dialing a wrong number. The place is exclusively known for its Chinese cuisine (buy recently has become a multi-speciality restaurant). Some of its mouth watering dishes are Fish n Chips, Korean & Mixed fried rice, Pork dishes etc. Its not very costly but it will not hit your pockets badly. Staff are well behaved and good ambience for family or get-together.

One of the best places to have Chinese in south kolkata. The food is delicious and the service is extremely good. The atmosphere is very homely. One should definitely try out this restaurant.

Being a fanatic about chinese food, I must say that Hatari is an absolute delight..! Though i had been to the behala center of Hatari, this was my first time at the gariahat center. The very first thing that grabs your attention on entering this place is the classy ambiance..! And then comes the food..!! We ordered for veg sweet corn soup, fish chips, mixed fried rice and chicken sweet and sour, and the taste was just ahh,, good enough to make the afternoon etched in my memory.. I strongly recommend tgis place for every chinese lover..! Keep eating.. :)

We were a group of 6 for dinner. We ordered asparagus soup, chicken clear soup, red pepper chicken, grilled fish, mixed fries rice, rice noodles, gravy chow and chilli dry lamb. I had previously tried the red pepper chicken at the vip road outlet of hatari, so ordered it again. All of the dishes were cooked to perfection. Red pepper chicken as usual was very spicy but the taste was worth it. Over all service is great, food is awesome and ambiance is excellent...

Am a regular at this place, they provide huge quantities of really yummy food at great pocket friendly prices! Personally love their golden fried baby corn and chicken reshmi kabab which they serve with the most delicious raita. Go there and surely you will leave with a big smile on your face!
Edit: So for the last few years I had been giving hatari a visit every pujo on sasthi with my friends and left satisfied every time. But this time we found that both the service and the food quantity had degraded quite a bit and so had the attitude of the staff. A disappointing experience since we really do love this place and the food here. Edited in 2017

This is the place that I have been visiting with my parents since childhood (last 25 years). Appreciated every time I visited, and still believe they are the best in town when it comes to their indo Chinese fried rice and chili chicken. They are superb with their quantity and food is out of the world. My personal favorites apart from fried rice, chili chicken  are Thai fish, dry chili lamb, duck, canyon chicken and hot garlic chicken. Every dish is so good at their restaurant. A big 5 from me.

Food : We ordered 1 mix noodles, 1 chicken Fried Rice, 1 chilli chicken and 1 nun... 

Mix noodles : its was good and tasty.. they have maintained the quality ...

Chicken Fried Rice : this is where the taste has deteriorated... it has become very dry and dull..

Chilli chicken : It was tasty .. it was also maintained well..

Nun : was as soft as cotton...

Service : good 

ambience : as always.... Very Crowded....

From outside it looks shabby but man they serve amazing foods. Starting from crispy fish to finish with fresh lime soda tests were perfect. We had both rice & noodle but rice was better in taste (doesn't mean noodles sucked) special fried rice & mixed friee rice are morally same just in addition a with some vegetables. Chiefs special chicken is a perfect intersection between chilli chicken & chicken sweet & sour. Chilli pork dry & chill lamb hoysen was at it's best.

We went there during durga pujas. As expected, we had to wait in a long queue outside but i was taken aback by their unprofessionalism when we had to wait another 20 odd mins after being called up.
Anyways, coming to the food, we ordered butter nan, murgh tawa masala, murgh reshmi masala, mixed fried rice & chilli chicken. The service was prompt. The chinese was delicious but i was not impressed by their indian dishes. All were very bland. Keeping in mind the durga pujas & d over-pricing of things, their food is way below par.
Overall, a very bad experience !

Came here for lunch yesterday with a group of friends.we had to wait for quite some time before we cud manage to get a table for the 8 of us.coming to the food:for starters we had ordered the honey pepper chicken.the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sweetness of the honey complimented the heat of the pepper.for our main course we had mixed noodles and mixed fried rice.point to be noted here is that they serve pork in the mixed noodles and rice and since two of us didn eat pork we requested them to leave out the pork from on of the dishes.for sides we had the schezwan chicken...hot garlic chicken...chicken in oyster sauce..and despite of the puja rush the food was served on time...and everything tasted great.quantity and quality of the food served was great.and above that nothing on the menu was overpriced.so overall satisfied with the experience and looking forward to come back for a second time.

This was my first visit to this place. We were a gang of nine friends and decided to go there for supper on Panchami after visiting several puja pandals whole day long. Due to Puja the place was crowded and we have to wait for getting our chance to sit for half and hour. The ambiance was very nice though it was almost filled up. The staffs were well behaved and service was good. The quantity of the food was surprisingly awesome. We have ordered Egg chicken fried rice, Chilly pork and Schezwan chicken. Rice and chicken was good. Personally i just loved the taste of the pork as i first time tasted it. I want to visit this place for many times..

This is near triangular Park. 
Ambiance was great, interior was also good. 
We had to be waiting for dinner as there were lots of people are already in queue. So management should take care of it. 
Anyway, we ordered Cantonese soup, mixed rice noodles, prawn with mushroom, Thai fish, green salad and lemon soda. I must say food will amazed you. Quantity is more than sufficient. Price is standard. 
Looking forward to try other items from their menu. Recommended for foodies.

Me & my wife planned to have lunch at Hatari since last year durga puja. It didn't happen due to heavy crowd. This year we had a great sumptuous lunch at Hatari last month. We had Sweet & spicy chicken in starter which is crunchy, mouth watering dish itself. They sauteed it very well in tangy sweet  and spicy sauce and plated it very decoratively. In main course we had Fried rice with prawn and  squid. That was also awesome as it was full of prawn and squids and tasted very authentic. It was very subtle in taste as we could taste all the ingredients. I have a very soft corner in my heart for their fish in red wine. And I ordered that and they didn't disappoint us. It was superb as fish was well marinated and just melted in mouth. I just closed my eyes after having a spoonful. We had a great lunch and service and prices are quite affordable for a nice lunch or dinner for two. My affection is growing day by day. Thanks Hatari.

Pro: The food is worth the wait and way more!!

I cannot name one dish that I have had here and disliked!
The beverages, soups, starters, main course and desserts. They are all fantastic!

The crispy chilli baby corn, Mongolian Prawn and the chicken kababs are delicious.
The American Chopsuey was just like it should be!
The rice and noodles are ample in quantity and excellent in quality!
The chicken, mushroom and prawn side dishes are the icing to the cake!

Lastly, the ambience has a homely feel to it. And the service is extremely prompt!

QUANTITY!!! This is a warning this restaurant should put up on their door. Amazing Chinese food at excellent prices and humongous quantity. Don't eat here unless you are as hungry as a lion! :D
Every time we visit this place we HAVE to parcel our meal. One plate of any fried rice or noodle with one ala carte dish more than enough for 3 people, yes not 2, 3!
Very good ambiance, never seen this place go empty. Even for evening snacks this place looks decently crowded. Lost count on how many times we've been here or ordered from here.
And about their food, what can I say, order anything, you wont be disappointed.
What we loved the most here- we ordered prawn fried rice once, the amount of prawn provided in the rice was so satisfying that we din't once think of ordering any prawn ala carte dish :)
This place ranks in my favourite restaurants in the city

Hatari, a stone's throw from my house, and always buzzing with customers, has always been a favourite of myself and all my family members!

Amazing quantity!!! An array of choices. And. Tasty food. You do get a lot of variety to choose from. Can't really pinpoint one particular dish since i love whatever there is on the menu. Personally in Hatari, i prefer the noodles to the rice(even though i am a fan of fried rice). You can try out the lamb and duck dishes as well!

Enjoy eating at Hatari :)
I'm sure you won't be disappointed :D

Good chinese food. Everytime. Stick to tried and tested cuisines with Hatari though. Try not to order their biriyani or spare ribs - utter disappointment. Thai curry was also not up to the mark. Dig in blindly in case of authentic Indian Chinese items. One portion is more than enough for 2 hungry souls/3 people who eat in moderation. And try getting a table in the extention (tiny area with black sofas)..  you can catch awesome music playing in the background!

Located away from Deshapriya Park and around Gariahat is this restaurant going by the name of Hatari. The people who frequent this place are quite familiar to this name as it's often used as a landmark too. The place is large and perched on the first floor. I have been here quite a few times and have witnessed its growth and expanding diversity in its menu cards. You will come across most of the Bengali cuisines here. For momo lovers, chicken lovers and Nan lovers like me this is an easy choice if you're shopping or just walking past it with a hungry belly (or heart!). The food is good and so is the service. The place is kept clean invariably and is frequented by people of all ages. Now if you're interested to know the catches, then let me tell you that there is no lift to take you up to the floor making it difficult for aged people. Another problem is that since this is situated at the heart of Gariahat, one must be ready to wait on their turns hand and foot for the place attracts quite an attention. Finally the most important thing at least for me is the cloakrooms, and that is fine and usable. The prices are not really OTT so people banking upon only their pocket monies can afford the bills. So if you still haven't been here, next time post-shopping grab a bite here, chances are you will wound up satisfied.

Went there as had heard a lot about the place but our idea was to have something light. 
We had to wait for half an hours to get our seats but I'll tell you the wait was worth it. We ordered two dishes Chilly garlic Prawn and Mangolian fish with fresh lime water. The preparation of the dishes was excellent , it seemed the place has its own sense of touch to the dishes, awesome work by the chef. Even the quantity of the food was good .
Coming to the vibe and feel of the place, don't expect something fancy, the place is crowded and noisy but it's absolutely a winner in my book due to the  awesome food quality and quantity. 
Will plan to go again, very soooon!!!!

Visited Hatari after a very long time. Quite cramped with very little elbow room. It looked as if the owners are not bothered about a thing called decor - so if you are looking for ambience this is not for you.
Food tasted good and fresh though the gravy for all the dishes seemed to blend into one. Service was prompt and good. What stood out was the size of the portions - absolutely humongous ! No wonder the waiter stopped me in the middle of the order and said we wouldn't be able to finish what I had ordered - and he was right ! Each portion is good enough for four - so beware when placing your order.
The bill was reasonable and I might drop in again if ' ambience ' is not on my menu.

One of my favourite places in Kolkata. We had to wait for about 20 mins before getting in, which is very common as the place remains crowded during the weekend. This was in the month of Feb(2015).¬†

Quantity : 5/5 (Its better for a group of people with more than 3 heads as they serve a lot!)
Food : 4.5 /5 (Dry Chili Pork was so yunmmy !!!! )
Ambiance : 4/5
Service : 4/5
Cost : 4.5/5

I am looking forward to visit the place again once I am back to my hometown during Durga Puja!

The food standard has dropped drastically..
We ordered..

Pepper Chilli Fish
Drums of Heaven.. as starters

In main course we had..

Mixed Hakka Noodles
Mixed Fried Rice
Mongolian Chicken
Sweet n Sour Fish

I would like to say.. apart from the Pepper Chilli Fish everything was below average.. Not expected from such a restaurant.. the food is not of that standard to be of such high price...
I would really like the management to look into the matter.. because the experience was really pathetic...

Well, one of my university senior wanted to give us a treat and we all zeroed in on Hatari, reading the rave reviews in Zomato. We went around 2:30 in the afternoon and the eatery was chockablock. We had to wait for 30 minutes to finally get a table. The ambience is passable. We ordered drums of heaven as starters and mixed fried rice, mixed chow mein, hot garlic chicken and chilli fish in the main course. We were expectedly taken aback by the quantity of the food. It was impressive- enough for 2 voracious eaters. Well, the starter tasted quite good and the main spread was scrumptious and perfectly cooked. They were bearing all the hallmarks of Chinese food- were light with lil or no oil, oozing typical aromas! I loved the hot garlic chicken the most. Highly recommended.

Love makes you travel, true for food too. When you hog the place thrice in a fortnight for Chinese, you know you have found a good place. You may not like the looks of the restaurant, interiors and all but the food will make you go gaga over it. Price is an added advantage. Mongolian Chicken (Dry) and Sweet Corn Soup are must to begin with. Spices can transform a meal by adding a range of flavors, from a hint of sweetness to a kick of heat, which in case of Mongolian Chicken is true to core with cashews blended in dry spices. Chicken Prawn Chow, Chicken Chow, Vegetable Chow (Gravy), Szechuan Noodles and Fried Rice are all great. Thai chicken is what has made me a fan of this place, what a mouthwatering delicacy!!! Go ahead and mix it with their Special Chicken Biryani and thank me later. Truly a legendary restaurant of Kolkata.

One of the oldest 'legendary' Chinese restaurants in Calcutta! On the first floor, the first time I had been there, which was years ago, the shabby looking stairs that led to the restaurant kept me thinking and the interiors didn't please me a lot either, though it came as a surprise compared to the exteriors. But once I tasted the food, oh boy! I have never ever stopped visiting this place. The prices are easy on the pocket considering the huge portions they serve. Interiors are dimly lit with cosy sofas but something more plush would have been nicer. I love their Thai soup, chilli pork- one of my favourites in the city, mixed special rice (with pork of course), pan fried chilli fish, Hunan lamb, red wine chicken, and etc (yes)! Plus I had also tried a particular fish kebab (on their special menu) one day, and it was mind blowing, the fish was so soft and melted in mouth, subtle flavours and perfectly cooked. This place never lets me down and I love going back over and again! Service and all is good as well.

This place may not be so pleasing to one's eyes when you pass by it, but once you enter the restaurant, it's a pretty nice place. One of the legendary restaurants of kolkata, Hatari serves delicious food and that too in great quantities. Had tried their chicken biryani along with raita, and chilli garlic rice with schezuan chicken. 
Definitely a must place for all the food lovers.

Are you looking for a nice place to have dinner with your family or friends?
YES.
Are you looking for a place which is quiet affordable?
YES.
Are you looking for a place which can offer you almost all sorts of known cuisines?
YES.  
Are you looking for a place which can offer you huge amount of foods?                                  
YES.
And lastly are you fond of delicious pork dishes(only if you are a pork eater)?                                 
YES.
Then hatari is the place you should be. Even if you don't eat pork it really won't matter as they have a huge lists of food from different cuisines. They are famous for their chinese foods but trust me you can trust them with anything. Be it tandoori, chinese, veg, non-veg it will always end with you saying 'BAH'(wow in bengali). Don't trust me? Just give a visit their and the never ending long que will let you know the truth. 

Which brings me to the hatari's only known downside(and the reason for holding back .5) that is the place where you have to wait in the que. It's a bit frustrating as you have to wait for a long time and all the mouth watering aroma of those dishes which you will possibly crave for makes you more hungry.     

But as I said the crowd itself is the answer to your question if it is a right place to go. I would say yes, the crowd would say too.

This one is my personal favourite from South Kolkata. Their Chinese food can leave you drooling for more. The best part is that you can ask for your chosen dish to be made more spicy and they will oblige readily. The ambience is sooting and relaxes you instantly. Nothing specific but all the dishes are outstanding. Great experience at every visit is what you take back from here.

Whether you visit this placw with your friends or family or with a date or alone you will enjoy your time. The ambience is good for all purpose and with any company. The service was outstanding and quality of food was justifying the high zomato ratings. The taste was good but only disappointing factor was non availability of tandoori breads on repeat order just after 10 minutes of my first order. Worth visiting and offering yourself a good meal.

Located in the heart of Kolkata at Triangular Park, Hatari is one place which never disappoints, be it the food, the quantity, the ambiense, the hospitality. Been there many times now, but the wow factor never ceases. Must try items are Mongolean chicken and chicken in red wine. Looking forward to many more yummy visits to this place. Hatari, you are pure bliss!

Another favorite place since my childhood. Located opposite to Triangular Park at Rash Behari Avenue, is one of the popular restaurant of Kolkata. If you go during peak lunch or dinner time, you surely have to wait outside in the queue for some time. During Durga Puja this waiting time can be even 2-3 hours, so much is the demand of Hatari. The food quality and quantity is very good and price is pretty much okay. Recently they have introduced kebabs which are also very tasty. My all time favorurite at Hatari is crispy fried fish, crispy golden prawns, mixed rice noodles and sweet and sour chicken and offcouse fresh lime soda (sweet). I celebrated my last birthday at hatari last month, for a change it starters i took their newly introduced kebab platter (2 types of 2 pc chicken, 1 type of 2 pc fish and 1 type of 2 pc mutton) and it was good indeed, the crispy golden prawns was as usual yummy, long with it was my favorite fresh lime soda (sweet). In the main course it was as usual my hatari special favorite mixed rice noodles and sweet and sour chicken. Really loved the food as always and enjoyed my birthday lunch to the fullest. Ambiance is good as always, staffs are always smiling and helpful. Eagerly waiting for my next visit.

One of the oldest & most visited restaurants of Kolkata. Best thing about this place is their quantity of food which is enormous. Even a person with a great appetite cannot consume one full plate of anything. If we come to the quality, it is absolutely wonderful. The fish items are a must try. The American Chopsuey is another awesome food of theirs. We tried the mixed hakka noodles; you can avoid pork in it, chilli lamb & dry chilli chicken. All of the food were too much tasty. Really looking forward to try their long menu.
P.S The waiters are absolutely wonderful. If you are confused what to order, they will suggest you the best food of their kitchen :)

Don't judge the book by its cover - very apt for Hatari... Generous portion of delicious food at very reasonable rate is what they are known for. 

Location: Located at a prime location, near triangular park.

Ambiance: Very ordinary with huge seating arrangements. Very less space in between the tables, hence, privacy is a bit concern here. This space remains full almost all the time, so, prepare yourself to wait in queue before you get the table. 3.5/5 

Service: Being there on sunday, during peak lunch hours, We had to wait for 15 mins to make ourselves to the table. Despite the houseful restaurant, we got everything very promptly. A high five for that real prompt service at peak time. 5/5 

Food: This is where the not-so-gorgeous restaurant won my heart. Be it menu variety, food quality, food quantity... You name it, they nail it. 
We ordered for sweet lime, crispy golden prawn, chicken fried rice and chicken in red wine. The prawns were succulent and good in size, though the crispness of the fry could have been more. 
Chicken fried rice is a dish which obviously you don't expect anything new to offer, but No, Hatari made sure to blown us away with its distinct flavour. I have never tasted this scrumptious fried rice ever. And then, the ample portion, OMG... More than enough for two really hungry stomachs. 
Chicken in red wine was a bit let down. The gravy tasted delectable, but didn't get the aroma or flavour of red wine at all. The chicken pieces were big, juicy and properly marinated though. 4.5/5 

Overall, a real foodie's place to enjoy the exquisite Chinese cuisines wholeheartedly.

Went yesterday for the first time with a college friend. Environment was good, service was also good. We ordered Drums of Heaven as starter which was a bit spicy for us. For main course, we ordered Chicken Fried Rice and Duck in oyster sauce. The fried rice was classic Chinese chicken fried rice, steaming while served. :) The duck was soft and tender but the hero of the dish was the oyster sauce itself. The only downside of the entire experience was a long line of customers registering their names and waiting. Nevertheless, I am hoping to visit again! :)

Has been a Hatari regular since not sure of how many years . Food is good , although overpriced. However recently started witnessing significant deterioration in attitude of the staff. Mr.Udayan , who takes down order phone at the Golf Green branch deserves special mention in this regard. He not only tries to hide his callousness and lack of professional attitude , but speaks to customer in a very arrogant tone. Happened to me today only. I ordered couple of dishes at 8.40 pm today which was supposed to collected in short duration and when I went at 9.00 pm , I was told that it is getting ready. Then a mini fire broke in the kitchen and after giving them time to settle down , when I enquired about order , I was told it is getting ready. Finally at 9.25 pm, it was discovered that order was not recorded in their ticketing system. It was there only at Mr. Udayan's notepad. When , I expressed my dissatisfaction , I was told , if I had been in his situation , I would have known his challenges . He blatantly lied that 'system' was down and hence order could not be placed . His colleague , however recognised me because of my alternate day visits and tried to do some damage control. However , it was too late and by that time Brand Hatari took a serious beating . Unfortunately , it was not because of food or price , but because of casual attitude , behaviour of their staff members

Have been a Hatari goer since i was a school kid. This place has never dissapointed me. Perfect place for family eat-outs and birthday treats, not only because of the quality food they serve, but also because of the quantity. 1 plate of fried rice can suffice 3 adults if you are decent eaters and have eaten your starters well. Went there for a Saturday lunch with my friends. We were 8 people. Our starters orders were:
1. Crispy Chilly Babycorn
2. Pan fried fish
3. Red pepper Chicken
4. Fried Prawns
Each and every item were served hot and tasted great. For main course our orders were:
1. Veg Hakka Noodles (1 plate)
2. Chicken Fried Rice (2 plates)
3. Chilly Lamb
4. Chicken with vegetables
Again, all of it tasted heavenly, especially the lamb. Chicken with vegetables was in white gravy and had all fresh well-cooked veggies. We had to parcel more than 70% of the noodles as we were full. As accompaniments had Fresh Lime Sodas. The bill came up to Rs. 3040 for 8 people, that too after so much hogging. Easy on pocket, Hatari is worth a try. Only con being, we had to be in queue for more than 30 minutes, as the place is almost always crowded. But it's worth the wait. :)

This place has been a personal favorite right from the first time i visited back in 2010. It was a Dashami evening. We had to wait for around 45 mins to get a seat. And the food we received was worth every second we waited. They provide a perfect dining room ambiance along with well cooked foods that will surely tug at the corner of your heart for another visit. Well if you are anywhere nearby the place, and looking for a place to eat, then look no more. Go for this place. It will be worth your time and pocket pinch. üòä

Hi foodies!

-Intro-
I've visited this place quite a few times but never got around to writing a review. This restaurant also falls into my top choices for Chinese Cuisine. 
Honestly, all the times that I've been here, I've never had a problem, especially with the food. 

-Food-
This particular day, we ordered only Mixed Fried Rice and Garlic Fish (pictures included). I would recommend this combo as the white gravy of the fish blends perfectly with the rice. Mixed Rice includes pork. Since my mom doesn't have pork, they served it separately. 
Other items I tried before and really liked was their lamb items. 
Point to note: They are VERY generous with the quantity. The friend rice is sufficient for two persons. We had to parcel the fish as we couldn't finish it all (it contained 8 big pieces). 

-Ambience-
Okay, so the place is loud. Like, really loud. If you want to have a quiet, private dinner, this is NOT the appropriate restaurant. On the other hand, the place is perfect for big groups, birthday parties and the like. 

-Endnote-
An honest tip to the management would be to introduce half plate and full plate system for all their items, not only the side dishes. This is because if one person enters the restaurant to have lunch/dinner, not only will he have to take every item as a parcel, but it would also not be pocket-friendly. 
Our bill of just two items was close to 600rs. 
Irrespective, this restaurant is highly recommended for families. 

Bon Appetite. :)

Location wise it's really great. Service is also fine. They have tried to introduce a continental section in their menu which is not good at all. But overall food quality is okay. The main USP is the quantity that they provide. It's really value for money.
If you are looking for standard food at reasonable price this one is definitely for you.

From an outstanding restaurant this hs become quite a mediocre one now. I really feel they need to ramp things up and come up with something special. The kind of location its in it has to compete with numerous restaurants. Other ones have so much to offer which this doesn't anymore. It is still better than most but they need to come uo with something different to regain its lost sheen.

It became one of my favourite restaurant due to their maintainability of food quality. It's delicious, fantastic and wonderful.

Even though today was my second visit to this place within a month, I couldn't think about any other place to give myself post-birthday treat. Where on the last visit with my friends we ordered a plate of Drums of Heaven(for starters), mixed fried rice with Hunan Chicken,Thai noodles and Lamb with Mushroom.One plate of each items served seven of us perfectly.

This time(self-treat) I opted for Seafood dishes. I took 'Squids pepper salt' for starters- it was quiet crunchy and I really liked it more than any other place I've had squids from. And for main course, seafood fried rice with ' Lun Woo Yuk See' ( sliced pork with wood ear and water chestnut). I should give credit to my attendant for helping me chose the items. As the fried rice was a simple one with squid,fish and prawn, the LunWoo contrasted it with all five spices and soft meat and mushroom slices. My regular Blue heaven mocktail was presented as finishing touch. 

This place serves great quality of Chinese cuisines at reasonable price, and definitely the quantity is a plus. One plate serves two people efficiently. Every time I leave the place with a food baby and half-the-dishes packed. The place is a cosy one with dim lights and nice paintings; hosts are polite and very attentive- a beautiful restaurant to hangout with friends or dine with family. So, Hatari will always be my choice for both quick-grabs and long fancy meals every time I think about to have Chinese. One of the best Chinese restaurants in south kolkata, that serves delicious foods with a touch of heaven,indeed.

After so much of rain and water logging throughout the past few days,finally we could step out of our house today.So, we landed at Hatari for today`s Sunday special lunch after some sale shopping.We had to wait outside for around 15 minutes to get a seat.
Ordered SCHEZWAN DOUBLE FRIED LAMB for starter and MIXED FRIED RICE with CHICKEN with RED WINE for the mains.They took bit time to deliver.All the dishes are more than sufficient for 2 people. Schezwan lamb was very hot according to my taste.Those who like chili would like it.Lamb were very well cooked.Mixed fried rice was perfect in taste.I loved it.But the winner dish was chili chicken in red wine.O.m.g the taste of the curry wa so heavenly.I could taste the flavour of red wine in it.I would recommend this dish to everyone.¬†
we paid 1100/- for all of these.

Located in the heart of south kolkata, this is one joint that has catered to generations of hungry Calcuttans! Went there for the first time in the last 5 years just to see how nothing has changed. Being one of the best Chinese food joint in south Kolkata, they offer you some delectable oriental dishes (distinctly different and sadly way better than the Chinese cuisine in Delhi). Pepper fry squid and the signature crispy chicken a must try.
Oh and when you visit, keep ample time in hand. It is likely that you'll have to wait in the queue for at least 30mins if not more.

I actually think its the best indo-Chinese in town. What I absolutely love about them is the variability in taste . .I hate it when all dishes taste quite the same in Chinese serving restaurants.
We are so addicted to their food we almost order for home delivery twice a month!(Yes,I know I'm a Chinese food maniac). . .I have only dined in the actual restaurant once. .and have come back once since I did not have the patience to stick around for 20 mins or more( though I had to wait for 20 mins approx the only time I ate there). But you will get how popular the place is when you see the queue of people outside . .always and how readily people agree to wait even a whole hour.
I prefer home delivery since they are quite efficient and very polite about it and fast enough.
The ambience inside the restaurant is nice with a lot of halla gulla . .but sometimes you can't like that much crowd.
Coming to the food . .they are well reputed for their amount which easily serves 3 moderately hungry people and is of very good quality.
Our absolute favourites are their Chilli dragon noodles. .the dragon fish and the Sha Cha chicken.
Also the pan fried and chilli pepper fish are lip smacking. The chicken dishes are a bit on the sweeter side. The place is perfect when there are many of you together . .be it a treat or a get together and I guarantee u will b amazed(in a good way) when you see the bill after you have had the lovely food.
Everyone has to go there . .at least once . .I won't need to tell u to go in the next time!

Hello all,
Hatari, is a restaurant which will obviously be etched in my memory for times to come, obviously not because for the food but for a personal experience...
But its a very average restaurant both in terms of quality, ambience, courtesy ...everything almost...hell yeah.!!
D food served was very average and it was not worth the visit..don't knw why do people still throng there..d AirConditioner was leaking water and they were unaware and was trying to make us sit there...PATHETIC...!!

Hatari always brings back memories from my childhood days when I used to go with mom n dad. Being an ardent admirer of hatari, I cant single out any one particular dish. 
For all foodies' out there.. If you haven't been to hatari ever, you have truly missed out some good mouth watering dishes. 
And talking about quantity, please don't order two dishes of similar food for two persons.. That will be a waste because hatari is truly a value for money when it comes to quality n quantity.

Well the place looks quite fulfilled always,and the environment was good,atleast i thot it was at first,the server was too disappointng as we got our starter's after 20 to 25mins while in the first place they said it will take 10mins.... Though the taste was good and the quantity was good enough for the two I would say for three even,it was red pepper fish or something from their oriental cuisine,now comes the main course which we again got after 20 mins,haka non veg chilli garlic noodles and chicken in hot garlic sauce,the side dish was too soury to be tasted,chicken in hot garlic sauce is one of my most favourite dish and it never tasted so horrible,the noodles was fresh n just okay n nothing extraordinary,on the top of that the sweepers come and clean up the floors v while you're eating with a horrible smelling phenyl... When you would wish to throw up actually,so unsatisfied n never visiting again... Cleanliness is good but thw way of doing is not...

With a help of a special one you have made me learn to eat pork & duck, & till now I didn't stop, but being far sometimes I miss your delicacies. Each dishes have their own defined & distinguishable flavours. I loved the soft & juicy fleshes (fried ones must say) laying over the gravy or in the plate (for dry ones).

Been going to Hatari for almost 10 years now, and the amazing part lies in the fact that my order has never changed.
American non veg chopsuey with chilli garlic pork is my choice. It has always been that way and will probably be that way for years to come.

Was there for a friend's birthday party!! Actually 10 of us! Service was prompt !! Quantity was good price was average not on lower side even but manageable! Ordered Thai soup but it was so sour and thick that we suggested them it would go best with panipuri !!!! :D however the chilli pork was out of the world and the rest of the dishes too!! Just excellent!

My picks: Chicken sweet corn soup,  mongolian chicken (dry), chilli crab or pork, fried rice or noodles along with green chilli chicken or garlic chicken.

This place is serving great chinese dishes since long and is absolutely perfect to throw a birthday treat or visiting for a lunch or dinner with family.

Nowadays,  Hatari came up with an outlet near Golf Green which is closer to my place and hence, take away is the option which I am going for.

I was never a big fan of hatari but i got a news from several friends that hatari has changed.now they have improved food quality.i've visited this food joint last evening.nothing has changed at all.i had crispy fish in starter,non veg cantonese noodles & hunan chicken semi dry in main course.
Fish was moderate in taste,greasy.
Noodles was very flat in taste & so was the chicken dish.
Only positive thing was foods were huge in quantity.
I was looking for quality not quantity.

My recommendations :

Pan fried chilli fish, chilli chicken dry, mixed rice/ noodles, diced chicken starters. 

According to me, the USP of the restaurant is the Chinese variations and the proportions of the dishes they serve and that's huge and like no other !

Hatari is one my most favourite restaurants since my childhood. The things I love about Hatari are its good foods, service, and no-nonsenseness of the menu- straightforward and easy.

I've lost count of how many times I've visited this restaurant and how many times I've ordered food to my home, and I still remain a loyal customer.

I've tried their soups, veg and non-veg starters, noodles, fried rice, chicken, fish lamb. And all the dishes are so good, so wonderful I get delighted everytime I have food from Hatari. The lamb they serve is of very good quality in comparison to other similar restaurants..

The serve a good quantity. Price is reasonable.

Two things I hate about the place, and not their food:There is almost always a long queue, and waiting time is quite high.
The diners tend to speak and chat among themselves very loudly, which adds to a pandemonium.

Should have given this review earlier.. hatari used to be( and still is) one of our favourite places for big treats and birthday parties.. 
Ambience: well the saying "never judge a book by its cover" is what perfectly describes this place.. a very small passage of unattractive staircases finally leads you to a huge spacious restaurant with superb decorations.. waiters are very cooperative and too swift in their services..
Food- the menu card itself is very impressive with its wide variety which included Indian, Chinese, sea foods and beverages too! 
Visited this place 4-5times..  So can say they serve some amazing lamb, pork and squid dishes.. dishes worth mentioning are chilly garlic squid, lamb in oyster sauce, burnt garlic coriander rice and Thad pan kai.. and they serve unbelievably  enormous quantities in all their dishes..
With its prime location, and quite reasonable prices and wide range of food.. this place will always be a great choice for any occasion.. family dinner or big parties or even a date( just in that case, order wisely for 2people keeping their huge quantities in mind!!!).. 
Would love to visit this place infinite number of times!

Best Chinese in South Kolkata...decent prices especially compared to the amount of food they serve. Its not authentic chinese but its tasty and that's what matters. we had Seafood thai soup, mixed fried rice, chilli chicken, chilli pork & Keong's chicken which were all very tasty but the Piece de Resistance was the Seafood Sui Mai perfect in taste and reminded me of the ones i have had during my visits to South East Asia. I would highly recommend the Sea Food Sui Mai to people who visit hatari.

When we travelled by tram or bus from Deshapriya Park to Ballygunge to go to South Point high school,Hatari was a landmark we eyed with longing.Legend has it that the name has something to do with the old Hollywood hit called Hatari which was an African Safari of sorts.
You have to go up a long flight of stairs and when I last visited this place exactly ten years back I had to give up because I was 15th in queue.

Today went in at 3 45 pm and the place was full.Shows the immense popularity the place commands.We ordered golden fried prawns,mixed gravy chow,mixed fried rice,chilli pork and chefs special chicken.Everything was uniformly good example of Calcutta Indo Chinese with the pork and chicken which was basically a variant of sweet and sour chicken being outstanding.The pork did not have too much fat and had the flavour which comes with roasting.Coupled with friendly,energetic service it shows the secret of longevity of an eatery.Having launched a cafe lately,it is inspiring for entrepreneurs like us and humbling too.

Yesterday we went there for a family lunch. We were a group of 10 people and the four of us had arrived first, and the rest took quite some time to arrive. But the manager was extremely understanding and accommodating, and he provided them a table right beside ours in spite of at least 30 people waiting outside for their turn.¬†
Coming to the food now -¬†
Chicken Sweet Corn Soup - so yummilicious that my 2-year-old had her entire share ( quantity awesome),
Chicken Mushroom Soup - this was a clear soup but tasty nevertheless,
Vegetable Sweet Corn Soup - this was tasty too,
Chilli Honey lamb for starters - great,
Main Course - Chicken Fried Rice, Veg Fried Rice, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, ( one plate of each, we were about to order more as we were 10 adults and one kid there, but the waiter advised us against it),
Sweet & Sour Garlic Fish, Thai Chicken, Gravy Chilli Pork, Hot Garlic Prawn - each and every item was superb to say the least,
then we had 7 Fresh Lime Sodas & 1 Tutti Fruity Ice Cream.
Food was great, but the prices of 1/2 items were a little too much.

I have been there several times but in my last visit I was a bit disappointed with their quality of food.I tried their chilli fish but the fish was smelly.The big chunks of fish seemed to be raw from inside, they have not cooked it properly. Otherwise I was quite satisfied with their food every time I visited it,but in recent times their standard has come down. But if you want a quite environment then stay away from hatari as it is very chaotic.It's a great place for group hangout.

Yesterday I had lunch at Hatari with a friend. Even though it was a weekday, it was more or less packed with people. But, thanks to my good stars I did not have wait in those long, slow-crawling, gruelling queues which is predominent not only during pujas & other festivities; but during the weekends as well!

Talking about the ambiance:

It is a brightly lit up place with a large accomodating capacity. Tunes of Bollywood songs are played in hush hush tones. The tables are closely placed, and there is a constant loud chatter in the restaurant (which maybe a worry for some). But I have gone there so many times, that it hardly bothers me.

Food:

Hatari presents the most amazing chinese food, that to in delectable portions. One portion can easily replenish the cravings of two very hungry souls! We ordered Sweet lime sodas which were perfect. We were very hungry hence ordered for main course directly. But I can assure you that most of the starters are yummilicious especially the Drums of heaven & Chicken satay.

For the main course we ordered mixed fried rice and chicken with red wine (which is my personal favourite). It just tastes out-of-the-world with just the right amount of wine! It is one of the must-haves that they can boast about.

Service was swift. The staff are there for ages and usually know you if you are a regular. They are polite and help you with good suggestions as well.

I just love going back to this place again & again. It is one of the best mid-budget chinese joints in south Kolkata!

They serve huge quantity. So order accordingly.
Their rice noodles and Mongolian chicken is really good as well as the crispy chicken. Don't miss out on the Mongolian chicken.
The Chinese is at par with the better chinese restaurants in the city.
Its almost a habit to go here during the Durga Pujas for the past 5 years. They have a waiting of average 60-70 groups who have mastered the pandals of South Kolkata. Its quite fun to wait for a couple of hours chatting away before being called for such great food.

Went for lunch on a weekday. Mainly because of its high rating on Zomato. In fact, chose it over Bar-B-Q (which was closer to our location at that moment), only to be disappointed badly. Both the rice and chilli fish were no match for the ones by Bar-B-Q, both in quality and quantity. The fish used was Topshe rather than Bhetki, and it tasted much worse. Not going again unless I have no other option.

It quite SURPRISED me that on my last visit here, a week ago, i did not have to wait to get a table. Yeah, getting a table without waiting is quite next to impossible when it comes to Hatari. It is the Oldest Chinese restaurant in South Calcutta and has maintained its quality-food  till today. 

The entrance is quite small. There are stairs which will lead you to the first floor where the main sit-in is. DON'T judge this place based on the let-down type entrance. The moment you enter you will get to see a big room which can accommodate around 50 people. The decor is simple, nothing to boast about. I feel the ambience over here very homely. Bengali crowd dominates this place. 

¬†So here it is. It was last thursday when i along with two of my friends landed ourselves over here after watching a top notch Arnold movie. It was raining and we were hungry. We were drenched when we entered. We were nicely welcomed and taken to our table.  

The waiters give us some time to settle in and brought glasses of water. After around five minutes we gave our order.

Starters - Dry Chilli Pork¬†Main course - Singapore Noodles, Chicken Prawn Fried rice  with Mangollan                             Chicken 

Dry Chilli Pork is one of the or rather The Starter you should have when you are in Hatatri. The meat is very well fried and you will get perfect amount of chilli essence. It is tossed with onions and capsicum. The quantity is HUGE. It is more than enough for two people. It is my personal favourite and a must try for me when i come to this place every time. Singapore Noodles contains only egg and chicken and it lies on the spicier side just like Szechuan. One of the speciality of Hatari when it come to side-dishes is the Mangollan Chicken. They serve 8 pieces. It is quite sweet in taste and it is very very tasty.

The quantity they serve in each food item is too much. So think and then order. One main course and a side dish is sufficient enough for two. Not only the quantity, the quality is just too appetizing. 

The staff knows their job. They will help you to order if you cant decide from the variety of dishes they serve. They don't hesitate to explain you the dishes if you want to know. For the food items that we ordered above, our bill came around Rs 1200, which is pocket friendly when it come to three. 

If you live in South Calcutta and you haven't tried this place, consider it as a sin. :P

One bit of advice don't order everything at once, order it bit by bit because of their huge quantity most of the time you're left with unfinished food which you have to pack. 
Happened to us everytime we went there. 
But the food is delicious so enjoy :)

Hatari? Every food lover from south Kolkata knows this place. If you go after 7.30 pm, surely you find a long queue in front of the gate. I think Chinese food is a delicious in Hatari. Lamb preparation is my favorite. Whatever you order here, It is sufficient for two people. Few Chinese starters like Black paper Chicken, Mongolian Chicken are also awesome taste and I think most of the items from main are really tasty. Rice with Oyster sauce one of them. The waiters are very friendly and they guided very well about your order. Most of the time we could not complete what we ordered and then packed the extra one. I visited here many times and hope I may visit there in the future.

Whenever I vist this place there is always a long que at its entrance and I have to wait for atleats 20 -30 mins minimum. Though its very irritating but it somehow depicts the place's popularity as by no means there is any lack of space and at single time the place can house over 50 people..Food served here is delicious and delectable..and a single portion of rice can easily feed two hungry grouwn up adults! Golden fried prawns are a speciality here and I, without fail have them every single time I drop in here. Seats are also very comfortable..though, a few sofas have become quite old and needs to be replaced. Overall great place to be at and have the wonderful and yummy food.

Last Saturday me and my friend visited this restaurant. It's located in the Rashbihari avenue near triangular park. No doubt that this is a legendary restaurant with soft music and nice and friendly staff. Hatati has its own authenticity and heritage that they maintained throughout the years. Coming to the food you should definitely order their chilli pepper fish. We ordered that for the starters and for the main course we went for chicken and prawn fried rice with Munchurian chicken. The quality and quantity both were up to the mark. Highly recommend if want to try some good Chinese food.

The ambience is awesome. The seats are comfortable. 
On my first visit i ordered chilli babycorn and veg fried rice. The quantity was enough to feed me and my friend. But the babycorn was a little less cooked. But it was fine. 
On.my next outlet i ordered the same veg rice and chilli paneer. The food didnot disappoint neither did the quantity. A nice place to enjoy your food :)

All time favourite, have visited several times with friends and family. Hatari is the place for quantity and quality. This place is crowded all the time and you might need to wait in the queue to get inside. There is always rush inside and it takes time to deliver your items.

It has been there since i was a child and over the years the restaurant has grown better in terms of style, decor and taste and established itself as a brand. Doesnt really matter how many more chinese restaurants come up in the city, people will still go to Hatari keeping it crowded forming a long queue waiting outside to find a place. Their business has expanded for good and they try to keep up the same standard in all their outlets.

Hatari is my favourite Chinese restaurant in Kolkata and I can vouch for that. I have been to many other Chinese joints but none can match up to Hatari's overall credentials. The quantity in one plate is always enough for two persons. The quality is always top class. The price is reasonably decent than a couple of overhyped Chinese restaurants if Kolkata. I have lunched and dined here many times and never have been disappointed.

Had an outstanding lunch at Hatari today. The ambience is good. The staffs are friendly. Most importantly, the food is delicious and well-served. I always get disappointed with brownies...but this one at Hatari...although not a sizzler, thrilled my taste buds. The restaurant is most famous for its chilli pork so there wasn't any question of missing it. Beautiful I would say. I've tasted pork in several other places, but this one simply beats all. The quantity they serve in a plate, is more than enough for two, rather for three (if you aren't a heavy eater). The only thing that disappointed me was the entrance. Although located in a decently identifiable location, the stairs along with the dingy corridor is weird and an utter misfit to what you get once you are in. But I think we can overlook that and go ahead praising Hatari for its outstanding performance. Indeed it deserves the "legendary" tag. Will visit sometime soon...
 Lamb with mushroom awaits..............

well, does this place need any review? the food here speaks for itself. hatari has never disappointed me. and a special mention to their fried rice coz I am not quite a fried rice fan, but whenever I come to hatari I never miss to order a plate of chicken or mixed fried rice.. and the canton chicken is also a must try! And also there needs to be a special mention abt the very helpful and friendly staff and Mr. Dean Chater, the manager for his warm hospitality.... Thumbs up!!

Hatari is located at rashbehari avenue near triangular park.  Ambience is nice with friendly staffs and nice music.  Coming to the food,  taste was good though i found the price bit high.  Must try -  drums of heaven, crispy chicken as starter.  Chicken rice noodles, sweet and sour prawn,  chicken hakka noodles, garlic chicken,  paratha and also kashmiri alu dum.  Food quantity is decent and tastes nice.

Indeed a legendary restaurant, going on for years, the quality unchanged and the price right on the sweet spot. Hatari deserves the name it has made.
The quantity is enough for 2 persons and you'll find yourself having some leftovers for home.
The quality is still lip-smackingly good, the staffs courteous, and the interior spacious for a large group, Hatari does serve really well.
Do try the rice noodles and the chili pork. One of the best chili pork on a budget if I might say.Avoid the dry crab preparation, as they give you only claws and you'll feel cheated due to the quantity of crab meat.
Overall a pocket friendly, nice Chinese restaurant giving you a bang for your buck.

I came here for dinner on a Sunday. Had to wait in a queue for over an hour and that was probably the only dampener in the whole experience since I was accompanied by my 85 year old grandmother as well.¬†
The food was served promptly though and one of the biggest pluses of this place is the sizeable portion and the relatively cheaper rates. it's undoubtedly one of the best places in the city for a casual hangout. The mixed hakka noodles, the fried rice was really authentic ad the prawn pieces were fresh and of good quality. we also ordered Ginger chicken and Mongolian chicken. The preparations were really nice but the solid blocks of chicken seemed a little chewy...would have preferred something more soft and tender instead of the large chunks.
However, i have to say that this place is great and ideal for those on a budget. On the outside, the restaurant won't seem all that impressive but once you enter inside , you won't have too much to complain about.

Well hate to break this but I am honestly disappointed as the only thing this restaurant can cook is possibly drums of heaven. The other dishes we had were average and don't even try the lamb dishes it's pathetic. As for the duck who serves their duck not skinned. We were served an not skinned duck and it was really pathetic. On budget restaurant but only order drums of heaven. Everything else not recommended.

when you have such an awesome place walking distant from your house you don't need a reason to visit it. This being one of my favourite place i've been to this place numerous times with my family, friends, cousins, for luncheon or on valentine special candle light dinner. This place can give competition to any chinese restaurant any day . In terms of there quantity you can't get enough of them, as everytime i get so full that i had to pack some home. i never miss to try their signature chicken dishes especially red pepper chicken and chicken in red wine. Their cantonese and schezwan dishes are yumilicious. Their duck and pork dishes are equally tasty . make a reservation previously or you've to face a queu even on weekdays. So next time if you are planning a sumptuous dinner trip or a small birthday gathering for your friends then just give hatari a try.

The ambience is what strikes u the moment you enter Hatari. Its Lighting is very nice. The waiters I believe are not too experienced and the service leaves a lot to be desired, especially when dropping waste from the neighbouring table on to ours.
The food is wonderful, especially the Crispy Chilly Potatoes and the Paneer Dopyaza and the portion size is also large enough for 3 persons.
Overall a decent experience but not over the top.

Should be looked upon as a legend, when it comes to restaurants in kolkata. This place is filled up almost through out the day. The food they serve is great, be it chinese or north indian. Both taste equally good. Beware of the portion of food they serve for a dish, its much more than other restaurants. So if you are looking for giving a treat, its one of the places to be. A place where both quality and quantity are equally looked upon. My favourites from their menu is shahi polao and kadai chicken. Chilli pork they serve is one of the best around. Might sound funny, but if you like having sweet fresh lime soda like I do, they serve one of the best in the city.

Came here at 3 pm for Lunch. Three people were still waiting in the queue outside to be seated. Peak hour and dinner - this place is out of bounds for gentry and better avoided. Crowd going to this place looks like the Rashbehari foot traveller types. Waiting time at 3 pm is 20 minutes to be seated. All Part of Kolkata culture I suppose. 
AC was not working when we entered because of power failure. So it was like frying pan to fire from outside queue to inside. They ought to notify customers about power and AC failure which they don't and yet they charge AC Tax, Mamta Tax, Modi Tax etc
Inside decor was nothing to write home about. It has a low light worn out inside ambience. Three four waiters are always hovering nearby the door and dominating in decibels over the customers. Not much decency left.
After ordering it took 20 minutes to serve the first dish - contrary to what other reviewers found here.
Ordered one starter Drums of Heaven and Pork Hakka Noodles for two persons.
There were seven large and softened drumsticks well coated in Cornflower cooked and served in chillie garlic sauce. Taste was heavenly especially in empty stomach and quantity more than enough for two as starter.
Pork Hakka noodles dry was done with shredded Pork pieces. Pork taste was good. Dry Hakka Noodles were filling and not too heavy. One noodle dish between two is again slightly more than just right.
Bill came to Rs 440 + taxes ie Rs 528 which is  reasonable excluding Tax, considering the large quantity per plate ordered. One has to be conservative in ordering dishes here as the quantity is invariably too large.
On the whole the place needs additional space and immediate renovation. Otherwise it looks like a ration shop queue outside and a seedy cabin joint inside. Queue must go. Otherwise it feels bad to be kept standing outside for a table. Waiters are efficient but few manners sessions with them will do good. They should guide customers while taking orders or one or two stewards should be there in lieu of waiters.
Cooking is good but possibly slow, slowing down the Service. Service has to be more efficient.

Undoubtedly the most legendary restaurant in Kolkata outside of Park Street. Be it the chinese and the indian, the food they serve is simply delicious! Personally since I prefer chinese cuisine to indian, I always end up ordering chinese..but honestly their indian is just as good. The chinese starters at Hatari are mind-blowing!! Some of the must try items would have to be the "mongolian chicken", " red pepper chicken", "pan fried chili fish", and the lesser known but surprisingly good "fish finger".
The quantity served at this restaurant is more than enough for two people. The service is fast. The staff know about the food really well and they will be able to recommend dishes according to your liking.
Overall a highly recommended restaurant in south Kolkata.

If it's authentic Chinese, then it's definitely Hatari. The decades old restaurant in Triangular Park surely makes it count when talked about legendary restaurants in Kolkata. Hatari is better known for its Chinese preparations but also serves North Indian cuisine.

I ordered from this place on the occasion of my mum's birthday, as this place is always crowded, home delivery was preferred. Food I ordered was Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Fried Rice, Sweet 'n' Sour Chilli Chicken, Crispy Chilli Babycorn and Red Pepper Chicken.

Hakka Noodles and Fried Rice were some of the best I had in past few months. It was properly tossed and very less oil was used for preparation. Sweet 'n' Sour Chilli Chicken had huge pieces of chicken used however the gravy could have tasted better. Crispy Chilli Babycorn was quite crisp and golden fried all the way and evenly sized too. Red Pepper Chicken had a lot of peppy flavour to it as it should. Overall professional food and no complaints whatsoever.

About the pricing, not very cheap but food is worth every penny. Nice service adds up to the cost. Quantity was very good, one plate of every dish can feed two persons easily. Home delivery was nice and prompt, no confusions regarding the address which is far off the restaurant. Delivery coverage is also good. Packing was excellent, nice and colourful boxes used for packing and no oil or gravy dripping from boxes.

Overall a hard to miss place if one is looking for authentic Chinese and a place good enough to be trusted for their quality of food.

An old favourite, Hatari keeps calling us back even as prices are steeply on the rise. Hatari is great for an afternoon or evening out with family or friends. The homely yet professional ambience works in its favour, although it occasionally gets too busy for the waiters to pay sufficient attention to your table. Although the variety on the menu can be baffling to choose from, all the dishes maintain high standards. The amounts served per plate may seem unconquerable, but being a delight to the taste buds, they disappear quite quickly. I've often wished that they offered a larger selection of drinks and desserts. I can swear upon the Chinese cuisine served here, and the momos are marvellous. Additionally, Hatari accepts Sodexo vouchers, which is a pro for me since I hate carrying around cash. The expenses don't always work in favour of the student-crowd, and it's impossible to try to visit the eatery alone, but Hatari is certainly a value-for-money restaurant.

Prices being reasonable, whenever there is talk of giving treats,hatari is the place . It's situated conveniently,with quality of food being exceptional and service  immaculate,even though the decor is quite ordinary.It is advisable to order less at first and depending on apetite, to follow up on the order,because the quantity per dish is quite substantial.

One of the legendary restaurants in Kolkata...this place surely lives up to its name..After a Looong line of avid hungry people we went in.
For starters we ordered Mongolian Chicken and Double Schezuwan Lamb...The Chicken was Spicy and crunchy...but the show stopper was the lamb..shredded lamb with coleslaw and veggies with spices that literally pop in your mouth..My friend's eyes started watering after the first few bites..
For main Course we ordered Pork Rice Noodles Korean Rice Korean Chicken and Chilli Duck...
The Korean Rice and Chicken was a big let down..Chicken was exceptionally sweet to my taste and the Star anise in the gravy made it even sweeter....The rice was in face Steamed Rice with veggie and prawn gravy and It looked like a weird cross between chop suey and fried rice...The duck was tender and plentiful...and the dish spicy and hot.The Pork rice noodles were brilliantly made with thin meifoon and pork fat with just the right amount of oil...
One advice...if going to Hatari..order lamb or pork or crab or other seafood in place of normal Chicken recipes..U wnt be let down ?

I heard the name of Hatari for quite a sometime. Today was the first time I did get a chance to go to this place. 

The people are very friendly. The menu is biiiig. I was confused what to order. I finally ordered a Lemongrass corn soup, Mixed hakka noodles, prawn fried rice, chilli pork and chilli fish. 

The food is good here. I loved the chilli pork. It was awesome

Operating since 1966...my first experienced happened on 15th may 2015.
Owinf to mixed reviews had not tried till now

The place can seat approx 80+people and has an ok interiors.. A touch up wud do wonders.

Postive was the food which was really good and the quantity can suffice 2people comfortably with large apettite. Staff was very friendly and surely a very good experience overall...good enough to go back and eat again.

Average cost is 650-750 for 2 and its a non alcholic restaurant.

I rated Hatari 4/5 simply because of the enormous quantity it provides and the generous amount of chicken, prawns, pork in the main dish. The restaurant used to feel cheap before they increased the prices. Now it would fall under the reasonable category. One side dish and one main is more than sufficient for two people. The only problem is all their variety of chicken side dishes taste more or less the same. A side I would recommend is General Tso's chicken, which tastes as interesting as it sounds!

One sunday afternoon five of my friends went to this esteemed restaurant. .. well, i have tried many times to havelunch here, but everytime huge line of people waiting outside had disappointed me... we had clear mushroom chicken soup and a chicken noodles soup with a Mongolian chicken as starter... and we ordered chicken rice noodles , chicken fried rice with two side dishes... the quantity of food in each plate is too much for 2 people after thaving starter... and even we could not order dessert ... quality of food was good... service was every prompt... i must suggest people for advance booking... otherwise its impossible to have ur food on time... and do order one dish for too people... i guess no restaurant in this city serves that much food in one plate... at the end of the day its quite pocket friendly also... :)

Located in the heart of the city, this place is usually crowded. The food is good, but I would not call it amazing. The only reason I love visiting this place is, because they serve duck all 365 days of the year. Still, this is a nice place to visit with your family. The service is fast and for me the only thing special I repeat is 'they serve duck'.

Hatari truly is a pride of Calcutta, and can teach many restaurants what is a really good eating experience.The service , quality of food, pricing, taste every aspect of this restaurant is splendid.
     I would recommend the Mongolian Chicken which is chicken cooked in red sauce with eggs and wine.I find the taste of wine which they add to this item really unique and something which will stick to your tastebuds forever , i can promise you even while writing this review i am literally salivating, it is soo good.The Chilli prawns are huge and always fresh and have a awesome flavour which my family members always order whenever here.The mixed fried rice and mixed haka chow are also good.
     Every time i am here i feel i am at home, though enjoying the delicious food.The quantity they serve is overwhelming and it'll surely satisfy your hunger.
    All friends of mine whom i have recommended this restaurant have come back with great responses.

One of the most popular Chinese restaurants in South Kolkata. And why not? It easily serves the best dishes. The service is amazing and so is the food. 
The most mentionable quality of Hatari is the amount of food they give you per plate. One bowl of fried rice can easily serve 3 people (people with medium-small appetite). Most of the times food is so much in excess that we have to parcel them. So don't order too much at one go. 
Nothing more to say about a restaurant that has redefined legendary!

It's been a countless number of times that I have been visiting Hatari since my childhood. So reviewing its cuisine in a few words can never be enough. The entrance way will no way give you the idea of the food you are going to enjoy there. Although they offer both Indian and Chinese, I will suggest you to stick to Chinese for sure. They have a few signature dishes. Golden Fried Prawn, Dry Chilli Pork, Pan Fried Chilli Fish are some of my favourites in it. Once, we ordered for Konjee Crispy Lamb, which I and my friend didn't like. When complained, they immediately changed it for us and gave another new dish of lamb in a different preparation. And that was really good. I like their service and the courteousness of the people over there. Every time you visit Hatari, even on a weekday lunch, you have to wait outside for at least ten minutes, if not more. And this proves the popularity, quality, taste and value for money aspect of the restaurant. I think these factors are very important when you judge any eatery. And for me, Hatari has excelled in all of these fields with flying colours. Hatari is one of the most running eating joints in the town. And I'd suggest you to visit the place with confidence, for I know Hatari will never disappoint you. You will surely come out with blotted up happiness of exotic gastronomic pleasure. Happy Dining! :)

Hatari has been around for years and it's in my locality but I have to be honest, I have never stepped inside this restaurant! But I have ordered food from here for home delivery tonnes of times. Always Chinese. 
The best thing about this place is of course their : QUANTITY and price. The portions are seriously huge and whatever amount is considered meal for two, it's actually a meal for four out here. 
I ain't very adventurous especially when it comes to Chinese food and basically stick to what I order almost every time without trying anything new and the food in Hatari has always been very good and consistent. It never disappoints. 
Usually I order a prawn fried rice, chilli garlic fish and fried prawns, also a couple of times I have ordered wantons, the food is pretty good and they hardly take any time to deliver! Highly recommended!

Large quantity food and great variety of tastes.

Hatari is one of the oldest resturants in kolkata that still serve good quality food. Located near triangular park, this joint is awesome for group hangouts, particularly if you are giving treat to your friends. Quantity of single plate is enough to fill up two people. Menu has great variety starting from chinese to north indian. Price are decent considering quantity. One thing i really like about this place is that the waiters are very friendly, well behaved and attentive, and unlike some other famous resturants, they never ask for tips. 

 My personal favourites in the starters are Crispy Chicken, drums of heaven, Pan fried chilli Fish, dry chilly pork and crispy chilli mushroom. Among main course, hunan rice, thai noodles, canton chicken and all the lamb items are great.

Yes they serve more than adequate quantity food which is quiet good enough fr two people within price rates to fit ur pockets. The must have dishes here are chicken with oyster sauce nd chicken or duck with red wine... Rice noodles r good as well bt pls don't try to have muglai dishes they r crap. The only annoying thing is u have to wait too long fr a table on weekends or any ocassion.

We went there for the first time in 2009. Still remember we had ordered mixed fried rice, which had a large quantity of prawns. Had fallen in love with the restaurant since then. The quantity is more than sufficient to serve two. The service is really good. The waiters are friendly. The place is usually crowded and many times , there is long waiting too. The price is not on the cheaper side. Yet its the taste, the large heart filling servings, and the friendly service that keeps us going back again and again.

There were people sitting behind people who were sitting beside some more people and who,in turn, were sitting opposite more and more people. In between this riotous colourful congregation were the servers, dressed in black, weaving their way through the maze of tables to reach their destination! 
I loved Hatari. Loved it when i learnt that the place has been in existence for many years, being part of the growing up years of many of our generation who grew up in Kolkata. Loved it despite the management's decision to place as many covers as possible, waywardly and fill up every possible space. Loved it for the smiling servers who were eager to please and suggested dishes that turned out to be a delight. I loved Hatari for its food, for offering chicken dishes from Mongolia to Thailand.  I loved Hatari for its ginger flavoured fried rice. And I loved Hatari for the security guard at the entrance who, despite being tired after a long day, still managed a wan smile and a salute as we walked out, content!

Now I am in a steady relationship with this place since 2009. When I knew nothing about the city, all I knew is Hatari. I have wonderful memories attached to this place specially of birthday celebrations. This is one of those places where both Chinese and Indian are very well prepared. ¬†

The food is mouthwatering and the quantity is huge. You will never expect so much to come to you. The Indian dishes that I recommend of Hatari are fis fingers, Chicken Biyiyani, nun and Chicken butter masala. But as I prefer chinese more, I always opt for chicken sweet corn soup, crispy chilly baby corn, simple mixed noodles, honey/ lemon chicken, fish in red wine and Chilly lamb.

*If you take my opinion I will warn you of Pork and Munchurian Chicken. They are simply not good.

Another drawback is you will never get a table in a minute at Hatari. You will be given chits with waiting numbers that it's really annoying when you are hungry. Best is to book a table in the morning and you will be free from trouble.

The security card at the door, waiters attending you and managers all are really courteous.¬†
This is a must visit.
see you there!

Hatari is one of those old chain of restaurants in Kolkata where the different generations visit. Catering to both the palates, its got a good variety in menu and is lavish.

The queue for dinner on any normal day is enough to describe the craze for this restaurant. Chinese dishes are very good here. The quality of fried rice is comparable with any given good Chinese cuisine restaurant. The Chilli Pork is one of the must have dishes. The quantity per dish is more than enough for two. Ambiance is good but a bit congested. Service is good.

I'd rate Hatari as one of the best restaurants in Kolkata and a must visit for meat lovers. The place is famous for the wide range of preparations both veg and non-veg. The ambiance is too good and the service is prompt. I have visisted Hatari not a million times but it left an impression quite nice on me. The food is absolutely delucious no matter what you order. Some might find the rates a bit high but trust me, they serve food with justified quality and quantity. The seating space is nice with widely placed tables and it's comfortable for a couple or even a group planning to get together over a meal. I hope I can visit this place soon enough cause I still have the taste of that lamb dish I had here. Keep up the good work fellows.

In starter chicken drumstick and crispy prawn is very good, after that I ordered their specialty Singaporean Noodles, that tastes great and also the quantity is good...

Finally I made it to this well known Chinese restaurant on april fool day and i swear it didn't fool us. As referred by some friends and zomato reviews I would say that this place didn't disappoint.
Food:3.5
Decor: 3
Service: 4
We ordered drums of heaven for starters which was perfectly cooked and sauted. Then for main course we ordered non veg schezuan fried rice with chicken manchurian. The quantity was enough to satiate 3 adults after the starters.  Staff if hatari were very co operative and polite which is less seen these days. They took very good care of us.  I would love to visit this place again and again.

This is the only place in Kolkata where I don‚Äôt mind standing in line to get a table. The queues here are long on weekends and holidays, so try and get here early. Luckily, since Hatari serves no alcohol and is quick with its service, most diners eat and dash.

We‚Äôve been eating here at least once a month for the past several months and the food has been consistently good. The quantities are more than generous and ideal for groups of three.

My favourite meal: Gravy chowmein and chilli pork. We have recently discovered their chilli duck, which works well as a starter and as a side dish. Each time we‚Äôve ordered, the duck has been beautifully cooked, not at all rubbery.

Their white menu has something called golden onion shitake mushroom fried rice. It sounds fancy and is fancy‚Äîlots of mushroom, and the onions add a lovely sweetness to the dish. We‚Äôve eaten this with sha cha chicken, though you can order pretty much anything as a side. (Personally, I can even eat this rice plain!) If you are a hard-core non-vegetarian forced onto a vegetarian diet, this is a veggie dish that will keep you taste buds happy (provided you like mushroom).

What I don‚Äôt like here are the chicken fried wontons (not delicate enough) and the fish batter fry (too much like a kobiraaji). I also wish they would change the sauce they give with the momos/sui mais/wontons‚Äîit is a tad too sweet and chutney-like. The seafood sui mai, however, is really nice with an almost translucent wrapper and a juicy filling.

Why should you eat here? Because the food is good: You can close your eyes and point to pretty much anything and it will invariably be tasty. Moreover, the quantities are generous and the waiters know their dishes. Plus, they serve ice cream floats and a very Bengali tutti frutti! 

(PS: I haven‚Äôt eaten from their Indian menu yet, so this review is just about the Chinese dishes.)

Ordered Szechuan noodles,chilli duck and drums of heaven......although the duck was not well cooked,rest of the dishes were awesome....one of the best Chinese food i ever had.The ambience is also nice but the place is small....so be prepared to wait as it gets overcrowded most of the time.If u r looking for both quantity & quality, hatari should be in your must visit list?

It was my first outing with my friends from school and the place we decided to go was hatari. I had never been to this place and was a bit skeptical at first. But as years rolled on I lost track on how many times I have eaten here. Both the Indian and the Chinese platters are good. For people like few of my friends who like it non spicy, the Chicken Resmi Kebab is the best bet. Though it is not as tender as I would have like but none the less good for the pocket. Having said that, the same is not true for the Chinese items as the meat is soft in those. The quantity of the items they serve is sufficient for three people. It's a nice place and I would recommend it to everyone.

Now I have an on-off relationship with this place since ages and I mean this in the best possible way. I have some fond memories and I have specially noticed one of the waiters who has been there for the entire journey. Food-wise it is above good and quantity-wise too. Be it butter nun with chicken tikka masala or fried rice. On a recent visit I have tried out their Mongolian Chicken (dry) and it was good. In main course we opted for Chicken fried rice, Chicken Chowmein, Fish in Red Wine and Manchurian Chicken. Fish in Red Wine deserves special mention. I have a friend who is not into fish and still he could not stop complimenting the dish. Let me mention here it is a little towards the tangy side. Fried rice and chowmein was above average but the Manchurian chicken was average. If u ask my opinion I would not recommend it. You have some really courteous waiters and the staffs' manager as well as the security guard deserve special mention! If you haven't been here it deserves at least a try from all of you.

My family in Kolkata seems to love this place.¬†

I have however found this restaurant quite average at best. The quantity served is huge and could easily be sufficient for two people. Their chilli chicken is pretty good and so is their momos. However, their momo chutney is something they need to improve upon. Everyone in my family is a fan of their rice noodles however it somehow doesn't suit my taste buds. But I'd surely recommend people to give it a try as they might just like it.¬†

While I have most done a takeaway, I once happened to eat in the restaurant. It has a pretty large dining area and the service is prompt. Not much to write home about when it comes to ambience or decor.

Yesterday my experience at hatari turned out to be a disaster since four of our friends were quite excited for a hang out after a long time!!!!! We had ordered terino toki( a grilled chicken "apparently "made to perfection!!?!)  as starter...dat too was suggested by 1 of the staff!!! It was too bad to taste...extremely sweet, reminded me of jaggery based milk powder n chocolate sauce chicken tossed with sesame ( if any such dish exists by combining all these ingredients?!?!)... In the main course, mein yam or yam main,a dish made out of noodles +ginger n wine etc almost evoked antiperistalsis instantly...!!! Excuse me for d expression!!  it was too bland,tasteless with a nauseating odour that we couldn't quite determine ...even service was quite annoying....we were kept waiting for a very long time...nasigorang rice was average.. Chilly lamb was....thank god..not bad afterall... The only saving grace......!! The highly rediculous one was a question from a waiter " hot ya cold" when we asked for a soda lime water n a masala cold drink!!!!!!..... Lol!
And the end,i came to a question " whether i should go for it nxt time or quit visiting dis restaurant!!?  "... I m confused btw!!!!!

A restaurant with wide accommodation, some times its important. We bengalies are foodies that's for sure. Inside it's all well decorated and I believe a good standard restaurant must have these eye catchers. And hatari is up to the mark. 
Well am going to hatari to taste their well standard food items for sure though. 
Some are really hard to forget. 
Well you won't get a seat in one chance for this one guys, just wait a little for 10-15 and come back home with the legendary feeling. 
Stay tuned... ;)

This restaurant has been our childhood favourite. We used to live in Triangular Park & this was sort of our ritual dine out at least once a month. Afterwards when they started their home delivery the frequency of course increased !!After moving out of India went back to Hatari after a long long time & to my delight it was the same special food that I remembered from my childhood. Had our old time favourite fried rice, chilli chicken & sweet & sour chicken. It was delicious & the taste was exactly the same. When I go back to India I tend to eat authentic food or childhood memory foods rather than fusion food. And Hatari I must admit fitted the bill perfectly. Will definitely visit again when I go back. Simply loved it !!

Hatari is one of the oldest Indian Chinese joints of Calcutta ‚Äì but it‚Äôs probably frequented more by Bengali old timers than the youth. It‚Äôs in triangular park on the 1st floor ‚Äì you need to climb a little. If you have old people in your company, please try some other place.

You will get typically the entire variety of Indian Chines, price is also economical. The taste of the food is alright but please do not expect something exceptional. This of course is not a place for the connoisseur.

Went about a month back to this restaurant. I was sadly disappointed. I had visited the Behala outlet and I was so impressed. I had mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken. The rice was just okay. I mean nothing extraordinary. As far as the chicken was concerned...it was bland. Not spicy, not tasty at all. I have no clue what was wrong. But that did not taste a bit of schezwan chicken. The coating was too thick. The gravy was bad. I had so high hopes but i was badly disappointed. I am giving 2 for the interiors, well behaved staff and 0.5 for the rice. No points for the chicken.

The standout was the American Chopsuey , Chilli Lamb,Chicken Biriyani. Did not like the Chicken Bharta as the chicken pieces were not shredded properly.But no complaints the hot brownie with ice cream made up for it :)

Hatari had been in on my 'restaurants-to-go' list for a long time.Finally the wait was over.We were a group of 8 and fortunately enough we didnt have to queue up for a long time to get a table.The ambience is simply amazing.You would find groups or couples enjoying themselves over food.Coming to the food the menu offered so much that we were left in a dizzy about what to order and what not to!We finally settled for schezwan noodle,chicken prawn hakka,chicken prawn fried rice,fried rice in oyster sauce,honey chicken,hongkong chicken and chilli lamb in gravy.The rice and noodle helpings were enough for two if not for three!!The schezwan noodle was nothing big to boast off and would recommend only the chicken prwan hakka.But the chilli lamb was the star!!It tasted amazing and anybody trying lamb for the first time can go for it if you are okay with a bit of tanginess.
The service was quick and nice!
Overall I'm coming back here soon to try out the other dishes on the menu soon!!

This is my fav restaurant in the whole of kolkata. After visiting this restaurant miscellanous no of times, this is the fourth and probably the last time i'm editing my previous review and writing a new one. :p
Cons:
The eatery is small and often there is a long crowd of people waiting. So if you are in a big group, table reservation is highly recommended
Pros:
The place has a pleasant atmosphere, just the best place to be with your partner. The waiters are highly courteous and friendly. The items which are highly recommended are- mongolian chicken, panfried chilli fish, mongolian fish, drums of heaven, golden crispy prawns, cantonese noodles, chilli pork, singaporean noodles. The indians dishes are quite good. The best ones being chicken biryani and chicken masala. The quantity of each item is huge though the prices are high. So if you want to have a sophisticated meal, there can be no better place than hatari.

I visit this place when I crave for lamb in dinner. Yes, ‚ÄòLamb with Mushroom‚Äô is the prime reason for me to visit this place. I like their fried rice too. They are really delicious and perfectly mixed with lamb. Crispy fish is starter will set the tune for a perfect dinner. I have tried their Hunan Chicken, Honey Chicken, Chicken with black mushrooms, Chicken with vegetables, All the dishes of lambs ¬†etc etc. All of then are equally good and comes with great proportion. Do not visit this place alone. Foods come in great proportion. It is a perfect place for dinner with large group of friends.

The staffs were really good and¬† will suggest you food and offer to serve you from the bowls in which they serve. Delivery time is bit longer but its expected as its quite big. Putting the festive time aside its full most of the time. All the arrangements was good. I like the ambiance very much. The location is awesome too. Yes the price is a bit high but considering everything its reasonable.

The only place that sweeped me off my feet when i entered!!!
The entrance is reaaally narrow...nd the queue is serpentine... I had least expectation about the ambiance inside...bt when i entered. Well.it was impressive.
Coming to the food.its fingerlicking good.
The portions are enough to fill two-not-so-hungry stomach.
The chowmein nd manchurian chicken are delicious.
The staff is very customer-friendly.they will suggest u food nd offer to serve you from the bowls in which they serve.
The toilet is very clean.
The location of the eatery is its plus point.
Though the prices have increased a lot.but kolkatans don't mind splurging wen the food is good in quality nd quantity.;)

It is mainly a Chinese restaurant. I visited this place many times with my family. It is a okay kind of place. I would not say the food is great but it is good.

If you are at Gariahat and searching for a good restaurant nearby. Then Hatari is a good option. ¬†

One of the best located restaurants in kolkata at a prime location opposite triangular park.The interior is also quite nice wid dim lights.waiters are very much cooperative here.coming to the food it was much more than expectation both quantity and quality wise. Authentic chinese taste and a large amount of food was served in each plate. The order was dry chilli pork one of their specialities alongside mixed hakka chowmein and mandarin fish. The pork dish was outstanding. The fish was also fresh amd tangy min taste and fish gravy was complementing the hakka chow. Very pleasant experience.will surely visit again

Well I'll always remember this place, as I tried a new thing here for the first time- duck. Even though we ordered a chilly duck, it was too sweet for my taste. Coming to the ambience, it is nothing special but it was full packed even on a weekday night. The service is lovely and the bill definitely reassures your pocket. Given my pleasant experience here, this is a must try place for foodies.

Whenever we plan out for a family dinner or 'old friends' meet up' the name of Hatari always pops up in my head. It's an ideal place for group gatherings and family dinner. I have been here for a number of times and not for once have I been disappointed. The restaurant being situated at one of the prime locations in kolkata is easy to find.The overall ambience is good and the staff are quite courteous. But Hatari stands out for the quantity of the food served. A single plate of any of their cuisine is ample to satisfy two extremely hungry foodies to the core. Not only in quantity,Hatari is also one of the few restaurants which serve delicious and lip smacking food irrespective of the cuisine. My personal favourite is their oriental cuisine. The pan fried chilli fish is one of their most sought after dish and each time I visit Hatari I make sure to have this dish. The flavours of this dish is impeccable and the fish is just perfectly cooked. Among the other dishes general tao's chiken and their shredded chicken preparations(can't remember the exact names) are always among favourites. Also among the noodles and rice dishes specially the mixed pan fried noodles,singapore noodles and schezwan fried rice are extremely yummy and very palatable. The price of the food is extremely reasonable compared to the quantity and quality served. The only downhill point of this restaurant is the wait in the long line which is bound to happen if visited on weekends. The place assigned for waiting is exrtremely narrow and crowded and it gets very uncomfortable after a few minutes. The management should definitely look into this matter and try to make the waiting place more comfortable for the customers. However,barring this small waiting issue,the overall experience in this resaturant is always delightful!!

A mediocre sized restaurant,my first visit at hatari left me with a good impression and great satisfaction! I went there with my family at around 7pm,we didn't have to wait and were seated instantly. The decor,ambience is not so incredible but what will leave you incredibly happy is their food..incredible quantity and great quality. I had already heard from my peers that hatari is best known for its quantity,and surely they weren't wrong,i saw with my own eyes how much quantity they offer. 1 plate is more than enough for 2 people with pretty good appetite..and more will be left behind. We ordered 1 plate mixed fried rice,1 plate chicken biriyani and 1 plate chicken side dish. There were 3 of us and we were stuffed full after then also more was left,we had to really force ourselves into finishing them. And such awesome taste..i really savoured each and every bite of my meal. For dessert we ordered 1 sundae and to be relieved they didn't put 10 scoops to make up to their quantity mark:-P
The chicken was really tasty..the meat totally fresh and delicious. With a bill of around 800 bucks,the dinner was worth the money. And surprisingly,when we were leaving we saw a huge queue and people waiting for their tables. Luckily,our dinner got over at the time when we did not have to wait and could finish off with the meal comfortably:-)

While the name of the dish got bigger and fancier the quantity on plate got lesser and lesser. Well in that case, visit Hatari and see if you still hold that grudge. The quantity served per portion could easily feed two hungry souls. A typical chinese resturant which is a crowd puller 7 days a week. Located right near Triangular Park this resturant has held its cliche atmosphere and maintained its food standard through the test of time. To recommend dishes would be redundant. Having said that I would suggest that the Chinese Chopsuey is  wortha try  here.

But later figured out that it was very spacious. Starting from soups along with the pork and prawn starters.... The tender duck and lamb in the main course along with fried rice and rice noodles made the visit worth it... Lastly... The staff and service was also good. Give a visit and you would enjoy it

This place is one of those rare ones where the two sisters quality and quantity do not fight for survival among each other but they go hand in hand on a joyride for the duration of the meal....
Speciality is obviously Chinese and the oriental dishes they offer on the menu and they are often quite authentic too...
Moreover the variety and range of the flavour palet offered is much appreciable...
Word of advice...
Will give it a 8.5 in my book ....

The name of this restro is well knitted with my childhood memories. . Though I enjoy tasting all kinds of cuisines, Asian cuisines (mostly Chinese in child hood) attracted me the most! I just loved the unique flavor of Chinese cuisines which were not what one would typically call "masaledar" or rich yet they were so amazingly toothsome!! Being a Chinese food lover,living in South Kolkatata and not going to this place is a crime is must say.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†The place looks humble from outside with a narrow staircase and small balcony as waiting area. During the peak season you may need to wait there for hours! Makes it a little clumsy. The interior is not the best but they maintain a well-organised and decent ambiance. The service's fine, nothing to complain but nothing to boast about either.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Now the food!..... Amazing! that's what I would say. Food is the most important factor for determining the quality of any restaurant. You don't need to have big and cozy waiting area with managers and waiters taking care of all your needs to become a successful food joint! Don't get ¬†me wrong those are important factors I know, but not as much important as the food quality. That's why people keep flocking here day in and day out ! This is one hell of a restro where almost all dishes are equally good. Be it Chinese or North Indain. (Didn't try their sea food much, so cant comment) The fried rice and noodles they offer is just spectacular. One bowl of Fried Rice or noodles can serve 2 persons easily! The side dishes are flavorful doing justice to their names! I personally love their lamb preparations! Well cooked and succulent pieces of lambs in delicious sauces!! The Indian dishes are also very desi and full of flavors!!¬†
¬†The only bad experience I had over so many years is a duck preparation they gave once, it was not good with smell of the raw meat prevailing over the gravy! May be they have improved it now! ¬†
Bottomline, great food! great portions! not so good service! but a delightful experience which will make you come back over and over again!

small suggestion: Management could look into the waiting area issue to give a better experience to their customers!!¬†

Food: 5/5 (undoubtedly )
Ambiance: 3.5¬†
Service: 3

I have been to this place so many times, but it never happened that I got to enter without waiting for half an hour. The long queue waiting outside the entrance in such a small space speaks of the quality of the food served there, and the only thing that irritates me. Always be in group of more than two, as the quantity they serve is too much. I have tasted both Chinese and Indian cuisines, and both tastes really awesome.
However, the outside looks a little shabby, and the inside space is small. If you are in two, they advice you to share table, which is quite irritating, because the do not have table for two.And if you are lucky, you may find artists of tollywood sitting the next to you.

One of the primary options for 5 star quality Chinese in South Kolkata (wat am i saying)... actually not only chinese, anything you order over here cannot disappoint you in any way wat so ever.¬†
1stly, the restaurant maintains a low profile from outside coz a narrowish n low lit staircase leads upto the restaurant on the 1st floor. The ambience inside is also okay, above average you can say. Nothing extra-ordinary. The service is also good, nothing to complain.
Now coming to the food. The Reshmi kebab we ordered for starters was just mouth watering and as soft as it can be accompanied by a perfectly prepared pudeena chaatney. In the main course, we ordered mixed rice and noodles with pork and schezwan fish. The fried rice was just a complete riot amongst the chicken, prawn and pork. Never had i came across such high amount of pork n chicken in fried rice at any other chinese eatery. the noodles was also equally good i guess though i didn't taste it much. The schezwan fish was also prepare from fresh sliced bhetki fish of the topmost quality. Though it was not that delicious as i expected it to be. I think the Mongolian chicken is a speciality over here coz the waiter suggested it but we chose to go our way. ll in all, it quite easily deserves a 4 out of 5 anyday.

ONE OF THE BEST IN CALCUTTA:
1. Best place to take your family.
2. The food is excellent.
3. The quantity makes it more attractive for foodies like me.
4. Various mouthwatering, authentic Chinese recipes are served.
5. Hospitality is excellent.

There are some accommodation problems, because the place is small, so it gets crowded very easily. But, its worth waiting at the queue.

Hatari is a nice little restaurant near Deshopriya Park. It offers choices for different tastes. The food is served quite fast in comparison with other places. The quality of food is great too. And at last the quantity, it is one of the best for any restaurant. The quantity of the food makes the joint a value for money restaurant. With one portion of noodles or side dish is more than good enough for two.

Well, we went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.The place was a bit crowded and easily locatable.Pictures have been uploaded for those food we had. We were a small group so could not try out much varieties.One thing I must say about this place is their quantity--fried rice and chicken was so much provided that we could not complete the course.The starters were good and crispy--though the chicken dish was bit spicy--still we enjoyed it a lot.Fired rice was also delicious--mixture of egg,chicken,corn,carror,multi-coloured capsicum(bell pepper), spring onion and the quality of rice was also good.Coming to chicken dish, that taste was not ok and for that my rating goes to 3.5 from 4.Staffs are good and prompt service we got.Willing to visit once more to try out other dishes

The contrast seen in its exterior and interior was not a pleasing one, leaving a huge scope for improvements... But once in, the feel is good though a bit clumsy they are in their table layout... But these things are left out after the food is served and tasted... Great food.. And the speciality has to be the Thai lamb... The service is average, and you might have to wait for some time to even place your order...Although a good experience but could have been much much better.. Said that the food is what that matters and they have scored big time in this department....

Hatari is located in between triangular park and deshapriya park, very easy to locate. Firstly i must say it has a great ambience and a decent interior that definitely gives it a sophisticated touch. Secondly the quality of food is quite good especially the crispy chicken and chicken in red wine. But the price is comparatively high. But is an ideal place to dine or have lunch peacefully without any commotion and chaos.

I love Hatari for its location. I love Hatari for its afforability. I love ¬†Hatari for the yummy simplicity.
There is nothing wrong with being an pocket friendly place. The seemingly endless queue outside this place in fridays and weekends will tell you their success story. This used to be our go to place for birthday treats and other celebration when we were in college and post college struggling days till we could afford more upscale places. I always feel that restaurants like Hatari form a big part of our happy memories with friends and familily owing to its easy affordability. You do not have to think twice before dropping in. Nor do you have to scrape your purse after the meal. All you do is sit back and relax before stuffing yourself to the brim.
The ambiance is nothing special. Basic chinese decoration with some wall art. Basic but comfy seating. Courteous staff. If you are here during the weekend or during shopping rush like Pujas, be sure to expect a full restaurant and quite a bit of waiting.¬†
Coming to the food, I am a sucker for their Pan Fried Chili Fish. this is my favourite starter. batter coated fish pieces stir fired with julienned carrots, Bell peppers, onion in a spicy garlicky oil. Yum!! I also like the Chilli pork mainly because the quantity is really huge. Oddly enough I have never really tried the Indian fare here. Always have went for chinese. So, can't review that section. I love the crab sweet corn soup. The sweet salty thick broth is the comfort food. In the main course, I like Cantoneese noodle, Schezwan noodle, Chily Garlic Fried Rice, Red Chilli Chicken, Chicken with Capsicum, Thai Prawn, Sweet and Sour Garlic Fish, Chili Garlic Crab (they serve crab in the shell, but they break the shells to make it easier to extract the meat.) I have never tasted the Lamb and the Duck dishes. They are sure to be on the top of my list for the next visit. Lastly, the quantity of food is huge and sharing is must.
Hatari remains and will always remain a favorite for my family and friends for the good chinese food and easy location.

Elegent decor, fine service and the quality food are three main reasons to visit this chinese cum oriental restaurant. One of south kolkata's best.¬†

As my visit over here, in starter ordered crispy fish well it was just perfectly cooked with perfection and ¬†which tasted really good. Fish pieces were crispy and tasted better with the sauce dip. Suited well with sweet lime soda...

In the main course had hunan chicken and burnt garlic mixed rice. Both were cooked well and tasted really amazing.¬†

Overall a must try oriental joint in South kolkata. Next time need to taste variety of starters and Indian dishes too...

In spite of travelling to Desapriya Park for innumerable reasons, I haven't had the opportunity (read pocket money) to dine in at Hatari. Thankfully, two of my friends decided to treat us for a delicious delicacy and I must say, this restaurant exceeded my expectations.

Some of the best features are:

1. Quantity: No matter how much you eat, I can bet that you won't be able to complete one bowl of rice/noodles alone. Thus, this place becomes the best spot for a group treat. 4.5/5

2. Ambience:  Another major factor which adds that subtle taste to the food. Good food tastes better with the right settings of external environment. Hatari hits a 4/5 here.

3. Variety: The variety of dishes are large and adequate for a person who is tired of eating the same type of Chinese food. Unlike some restaurants, each dish is almost always available. 4/5

There are a few drawbacks of this restaurant as well:

1. Price: It's a steep bit high for middle classed people like us but it manages to compensate with the quantity. 3/5

2. Availability: With great food comes great patience. The tables are almost always booked from noon to night, and unless you are more than a tad-bit-lucky, your patience will be tested. 3/5

Overall Rating: 4/5

Go for the food. If hunger is the best sauce, Hatari is the spice that makes it even more enjoyable.

Hatari is a place I would always love to visit. Belonging to North Kolkata, I do not have much idea about eateries in the southern part of the city. It was my treat to my school besties and they suggested Hatari. I had no idea about the food here. The ambiance of the outlet is very soothing and the staff were very polite and helpful. We had ordered Pan Fried Chilly Fish for starters. I got to know that Hatari serves sumptuous and delicious Pan Fried Chilly Fish. My mouth waters as I write this review, this dish was seriously too tasty. We had then ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Pan Fried Noodles and a Chinese Chicken dish. I do not remember the name of the Chicken dish now. All the dishes were delicious and were in great amount. We were four people yet the dishes had so much food in amount that we had to pack the food since I hate wasting food. I would recommend people to visit this outlet. I myself will go back there again.

Good Old Hatari is a place I have been going to since I was a kid.
These guys provide home delivery as well.
A lot of people have said a lot of stuff about the food. Good indianised chinese doesn't get better.

Chinese joints in south kolkata come and go.
What remains,is the grand old daddy.
Hatari,have years more.
P.S-PLEASE try and tip the ground floor SECURITY GUY. Poor man hardly gets tips

It's a place me and my friends go very often. Puja time lunch and birthday treats,Hatari has never disappointed me with its good quality and delicious food. The fried rice here is one of my favourites,and the pan fried noodles and dry chilli roast pork are really good. They even have squid for those who'd like to try something new,I'd suggest the butter garlic squid. 
It's a bit expensive, but the food and the portions are really good and worth it. Highly recommend it.

Excellent location, apt place to have birthday treats. Definitely an awesome place for us college goers.

They sell really a great many number of items.

The waiters were nice albeit I didn't like their darwan much :-/

The food was real good.

I can't but mention the Chicken in Red Wine, among the other things I had that day.

The starters were good, and my friends said, the Pork dishes were tasty as well.

No wonder they are Chinese experts.

Located near deshopriya park and just opposite triangular park, situated on the first floor. I have been visiting this restaurant for almost a decade now, but when I visited it for the first time, I was quite skeptical after looking at the shabby staircase which leads us upstairs and was quite confused thinking how the restaurant would turn out to be. But the moment you enter through the door, an unexpected surprise gets bombarded upon you, the lavish and extravagant interiors, luxurious and cozy sitting arrangements, elegant ambience; perfection oozing out of every nook and corner of the place. We received a warm welcome from the staffs and were accompanied to our table, a complete sophisticated management. They have a wide variety of offerings ranging from Chinese, oriental, north Indian, mughlai, etc;. Till date I have tried out almost every genre of their offerings and have always cherished them till the last bite. The quantities served by them more than sufficient for two people to get completely stuffed. Their oriental offerings are the best among all the restaurants in the nearby vicinity. They have particular variety of offerings for every distinctive palette. This is a perfect place for a complete dining experience.

One of the most 'value-for-money' restaurants of Kolkata. Awesome Food. Reasonable Prices. Excellent Quantity.
I have been to this branch for uncountable times and i have never been disappointed.
They specialise in both Chinese and North Indian cuisines! In Chinese their Mongolian Chicken and Red Pepper Chicken as starters are fab! *_* Their staples..i.e their Fried Rice is great and it is better than their noodles! Any chicken or prawn chinese side dish with their fried rice tastes awesome! But, DON'T try their General Tao's Chicken....it's their only chinese side dish which just sucks. And more thing is that try their Indian side dishes like Chicken Tikka Butter Masala or Chicken Bharta or Paneer Makhani with their Fried Rice or Butter Naaan. It's a great combination, way better than trying them with their Biriyani! And, they make wonderful momos as well! All in all, a wonderful place which i will keep on returning to, for such tasty food, reasonable price, excellent quantity and prompt service! And the branch in Behala which is 15 minutes from my house gives home delivery too..the bill being over 800...and it's quite fast as well!
Cheers! :D

One of the Best Chinese food I have tasted within short distance. First time I came to know about it from a bong magazine. I won't say it is some classy restro with high ambience and all but if u really want to have the best feel of some Chinese blend then its one of the perfect choice to make. The service there is very quick . Chengdu chicken( mixture of shredded chicken & wine) was one of my favourites. U can also try their lamb starters as well. I tried chicken siumai as well but if u try to compare it with the one at mainland china then i m sorry u wnt like it at all but if u go for d value of money its not that bad even. Its a good choice for birthday celebrations etc. All over its a good restro with calm soft music & dim lights . Most important lump some quantity within cheap price :)

Affordable. Prices worth it. Great quality. Great quantity. And a must visit.
You stay in south Kolkata and you haven't visited Hatari. Come on, that's impossible.
This is perhaps the only restaurant in Kolkata which had a long queue of visitors outside it whenever I've been here.¬†
Now, I can't be specific about what you should try in Hatari. It can be anything and each and every food they serve tastes awesome. But I will say what I try each time I visit Hatari.¬†
1) Honey Duck (please please try it. Nowhere in Kolkata, not even in any five-star have I got this dish)
2) Pan fried fish
3) Tutti-frooti
And mind it please don't order much. Their quantities are huge. I have always returned home with a packet which I enjoy next morning for brunch. ;)

This review is for Hatari gariahat n behala as well.
I have always thought about writing about this place. But then I feel, how can you write about a place which already boasts of 400+ reviews to it. More so, how do you review a Legend? 
Yes rightly so, Hatari is a legend. Located at the prominent of locations in gariahat also behala n covering huge space, you probably won't get a seat here on the "prime days", weekends, hell even normal weekdays, if u come at the rush hours. 
If you still haven't eaten here u probably aren't a kolkatan. You don't like hatari? Then probably u r an alien, haven't started eating the human way!!
So, what's special about Hatari? Everything and anything and any item in the menu is special. They all are premium quality food, fill u with a nice warm feeling that u have after real good food, in one word it's delicioso...except the biriyani. I mean yes the biriyani they serve is huge in proportion n enough meat n light but well its, diet. U dont eat and appraise a diet biriyani as a kolkatan. But its so so, I may say. 
About proportion, they serve huge quantity of food. If u are odd number of eaters, u r doomed. If u can't eat, well u have to just pack them up. Be careful of ur appetite n the quantity u r ordering. I always over order n my mom shouts at me for bringing left over packed food. :D
Money wise; see I have been to this place when I was in school & pay from my pocket money I used to get during the pujas. N u know what amount, as a student n from Bengali family u will get as a pocket money. So u dont have money, its end of the month, u visit this place. U have money, u still visit this place. This is tailor made for your dietary needs. 
Hatari is a legend among foodies in itself. Hatari, as I say is a flavour of kolkata.

This restaurant makes me nostalgic..I have started visiting this place with my family and friends when I was in school. Still remember those days when during Durga Puja we used to stand in queue for hours just to eat here in Hatari. I always loved there food but what was stand out was there Biriyani and Chopsuey with crispy noodles. Quantity wise also they were very good. ¬†One Biriyani or rice was more than enough for two adults so it was cost effective also. Its been couple of years that I have not visited Kolkata so not sure if they have maintained that standards or not. I will surely visit them during my next visit to Kolkata and hope they will impress me as always..Cheers.

So one fine hungry night ¬†, me and my friends decided to check out this outlet of Hatari.. Zomato has kept this restaurant featured in the Legendary collection , so obviously expectations were high . Had to wait for 20 minutes before finding our way inside . We asked the waiter to suggest some starters . He suggested ¬†ChillyCorn Chicken Soup , Spicy Dragon Fish ¬†and ¬†Konjee Crispy Lamb . The fish was undoubtedly the best for its juiciness. In the main course we tried Nasi Goreng , Pork ribs in chilli garlic sauce and Chengdu Chicken. ¬†The pork was ¬†disapointing for the meat was ¬†a bit rubbery and contained chunks of fat . Rest of the food was delicious and worth every penny .

Its always been a must go destination for the Chinese lovers present in the city.

Located at Deshoprya park I have visited this restaurant for more than ten, fifteen times. The restaurant is very hygienic and clean. The food served here are adequate for two hungry people per plate. The Lamb, pork and chicken side dishes are all very delicious and tasty. The noodles and rice dishes are also good. The prices are also not too high and worth the dishes served. But in recent times the quality of food served in Hatari has downgraded from the standards they set which are very high. In all Hatari is still a very standard restaurant if want to go out there with your family or hang out with your friends.

I found this place listed on Zomato Legendary section with almost every reviews being positive. Visited this place recently and I can tell you this is indeed Legendary.

The food is awesome, completely satisfies your taste buds. A single staple and a side dish is more than enough to feed two hungry souls. The ambience is not too appealing, but the food compensates for it all.

We ordered Mangolian Fish, Chilli Pork, Pork Fried Rice, Schezwan Rice, Green Chilly Chicken, Singapore Hakka. Every dish was in ample quantity and tasted too good. Still out of them, I would recommend not to miss out in ordering the Mangolian Fish (starter) and Chili Pork, they were really heaven on my plate. Had heard about a good squid preparation they serve, but it seems that it's not available all the time. (Not even mentioned in the menu either, you have to ask them if they had squid on that particular day) 

We had to wait in the queue for about 20 min to get a table, but this queue symbolises the restaurant's popularity and people's choice. 
Had a great time, will visit again. :)

There is literally nothing wrong with this place. The decor of this cozy outlet exudes an old-world charm that really becomes Chinese eateries in the city such as this one. In spite of the obvious popularity of the place and the queue outside, my friend and I were seated pretty quickly (the manager was friendly, helpful and sans an attitude: half the battle won). Thereafter, the gentleman who served us proceeded to recommend some items that he thought we might like. And we did! We were two ravenous individuals determined to lapse into a food coma. Hatari helped brilliantly with that. The mixed fried rice was incredible: it was loaded with shrimp, chicken, and fatty bits of pork. These guys really don't scrimp on quantity. The prawn starters we had were a bit too spicy for us, but were delicious nevertheless. The main dishes of pork and duck that we ordered were brilliantly cooked: we could not finish the pork, there was so much of it. And the duck was soft and falling off the bone. It was also loaded with cashew nuts, a sureshot winner. All in all, the food was fantastic. Hatari isn't a cheap eatery, but the quality and quantity of the food you are served more than makes up for the amount you pay.

I went to this place a lot of times. I really love the ambience. The staffs are very courteous. 
Now coming to the dishes I would really recommend RED PEPPER FISH for the starters if you are into spicy dishes (warning : the dish is way more spicy than one can imagine) .
Hatari is known for Chinese dishes and those are actually very tasty. But what needs a special mention is their mutton biryani. I had it the last time I went their and it was really very very good. So the next time you visit this place do overcome the convention of must-having Chinese in Hatari and try out their biryani for once.

Every time I go to Hatari I get satisfied fully, such is the place. The restaurant always offers extra with its cozy ambience and off course its delicious food items. Last time when I was there I ordered first fried fish and chips which were simply lovely to munch for a while. Then I ordered a plate of chicken prawn fried rice. To jazz it up I preferred hot garlic chicken. The gravy of the dish was simply yummy and the combination was complementing each other in fine way. Also green salad was in the platter to add some extra to the whole meal. Fish is must item for all Bengalis so I ordered chilli fish. And the dish was as mouth watering as it looked. Though all my friends ordered same but one preferred duck in oyster sauce. And as I love prawn my next preference was Thai prawn. And my meal was finished with a Tuttifruti.

For the first time I have visited this place. I must say it's one great place. I celebrated my birthday there and I loved the way the management helped my boyfriend to surprise me with the cake.. ????
Now coming to the food...I know hatari is famous for chinese but I wanted north indian stuffs..so we had ordered tandoori chicken half...one chichen tikka masala and two masala kulcha along with two masala coke and my must have fresh lime soda.
I must say the chicken was so soft and fresh it made me lick my finger and eat like am at home. The chicken tikka masala was so great and yummy. Kulcha was very soft till the end. Masala coke was rightly made..not watery...! Fresh lime soda was good too.. All of these at 950- 970 ..
I had a great birthday over there...I would love to go again and try chinese dishes as I was observing they give really good portion of it at such reasonable price.

BEST ¬†place for giving a birthday treat!¬†this outlet is old and much better than the behala one. ambience is also very good.¬†but during the lunch hour one has to wait quite for a while to grab a table.¬†among what i have tried so far i loved the mixed haka chow, rice noodles, chilli garlic fried rice with red chilli chicken.¬†¬†huge quantity with great taste! awesome! :)-----------24-12-14¬†On christmas eve i was able to reach there around 8pm and guess what we got a table immedietly , no waiting! Happy i was!¬†we just ordered a mixed rice noddles, mixed fried rice and sweet n sour garlic fish!¬†Food- good as always.... but there was pieces of egg shell in the rice which spoilt the mood.service- prompt n nice¬†cost -around 850rs. i must say prices have gone up incredibly in the past year. may be bcoz of the vat charges

located near gariahat this place cannot be missed, it serves great Chinese food, the service is quick and the waiters are polite and friendly, table reservation is recommended coz it is full most of the time and you don't want to wait outside.
the food is really good and it is both good in quality and quantity, you should definitely try their lamb and duck dishes as they are really good.

It's really amazing to find a restaurant which not only serves your appetite but is also pocket-friendly; and Hatari scores high on both the categories. Hatari allows you neither to compromise with the quality nor the quantity. Of all the dishes, though it's difficult to jot down the best ones , 'thai fish' is the one I love the most.

Hatari is one of the oldest places I have been going to for dinners. The place specializes in indo chinese cuisine. You will get all different varieties of chinese and one main course dish is enough for 2 people. I really like the chilly lamb they serve for starters. For the main course I would suggest the Fish in Oyster Sauce. Overall this is a very good place to take your family or friends for a nice dinner. But on occasions the place gets a bit crowded so you might have to stand in a queue for sometime.

I am thoroughly impressed by this restaurant- near Priya cinema, towards Gariahat . No fancy style. Basic decor. Sometimes huge rush forces you to wait for hours. It's on the first floor and the stairs are narrow. Budget friendly and big quantity of food. The quantity is definitely  more but I actually expected even more,  after reading the other reviews. Anyway it's absolutely Value for money as the pricing is very reasonable .
The Pork chilly is just the very Best that I have ever eaten in a restaurant. Only the home made pork which I ate in a friend's house in Sikkim was better than this. I will go back again for this dish.
We took the Ginger duck and Red pepper fish in addition, both were good- especially the fish.
The sweet and salty lime soda was also very good. Darshan was also sumptious and large in quantity.
The ambience is not as of fine dining. Though you don't need to do elbow fights, the tables are very near and when full, it does give a feel of a college canteen. Surprisingly the serving is attentive and pretty fast in spite of the crowd.  But good food conquers all the shortcomings.   There is no valet parking and you need to cram in where ever possible in the Rashbehari  avenue in front. 
I am extremely satisfied with this place and blissfully recommend for a family and friend dining.

Went yesterday for a late dinner. Apart from the regular menu, they had introduced a continental menu. Ordered spicy fish as starter. 10 pieces.Very spicy & tasty. Highly recommended.then ordered Hunan rice & chengdu chicken as the main course . Quantity is enough for 3 hungry souls. Hunan rice is kin of mixed fried rice with a tinge of Chinese flavours. Chengdu chicken is also very spicy but tasty as well. A must try
Overall a very nice experience.

I have been to hatari many a times.
The place is very much famous among people of south Kolkata.
Chinese is their specialty,though the Indian djshes served are equally good.
To anyone who is visiting this restaurant,i would seriously recommended drums of heaven,which looks like chicken lollipop but tastes much more flavorful(might be some Chinese grandmother recipe ;)  )...
Before ordering you should always ask the waiter about the quantity of food in the dish you are ordering,as they serve in quantities sufficient for two persons.
The ambience is average,but their excellent food make up for that. The prices are not at all high,so you can definitely choose this place to dine with family or friends whenever you choose to and that too very frequently. :)

Hatari is a place wer u cn visit for normal occassion nd hangout. So in starter we order first chilly lamb (dry) nd red pepper chicken both wer delicious nd spicy. Then for main dish we had mixed rice noodles (without pork) mixed fried rice (without pork) with chicken mongolian. So the starters wer awesome with large quantities but main dish was average except mongolian chicken whch was pathetic, it was sour in taste made with wine and sauce. So guys if u r gng hatari then go for its quantity it wil nt dissapoint u bt dnt try to experiment with food. Order simple and nd better ask d ingredients for new food. On d whole Hatari is an average place whc wil nt dissapoint u bt it wil nt make an urge to go for next tym. Its a review for chinese i didnt knw abt north indian food. Will go again to check the north indian food.

The best place to visit in Kolkata for whatever we call 'chinese'. The place is so popular that if you don't step into it right when it opens you are sure to find yourself standing behind a string of eager people wanting to get inside. The most attractive thing about this restaurant is the quantity of food they serve; each dish is sufficient to serve two ravenously hungry persons. Quality is persistently good & so is the service. The crispy chilly babycorn is an eternal favourite. All their dishes have distinct flavours. The lamb dishes are surprisingly good especially, the lamb with mushrooms. The prices are moderate when compared to quality and quantity. Being there with friends and family is a wholesome experience. A must visit!

One of the very few restaurants in the city which provide lamb,pork and even duck dishes. ¬†Tried Schezwan Lamb ,cost of which was a little above 300 and the quantity was more than sufficient for 2 people. My friends took pork,which was delectable too.¬†
¬† ¬† ¬†One thing I can assure is that whenever you dine here, you will always be content with the quantity and quality of food :)

Though I have not visited this place in the recent past but I did have the pleasure to visit this place quite a few number of times.

It has been one of my favorites since a long time and there were so many memories related to this place.

But coming on to the actual review, I must say it is one of the best budget restaurants in town. A special mention should be made of the Chinese section because of its generous portions and taste. One plate of any Chinese dish you order can easily be sufficient for two people, unless of course you are one of those gluttonous beasts...!!!

The waiters are pretty decent. Though most of the times I visited it was a packed house, the service wasn't bad at all.

I especially liked the chopsuey here and the duck preparations as well.

One of my friend suggested this restaurant during last year durga puja but couldn't get a chance that time, so we planned to give it a try during this year durga puja. Two of us waited almost more than almost 40 min to get a seat because it was last day of durga puja (Navami) so the crowd was max, but the crowd management system was really good.
Ambiance :- The moment we entered the restaurant the refreshing atmosphere just soaks all our tiredness. The lights were perfectly dimmed and the place is quite spacious. We got a very good comfortable seat. The table was ready and two menu card was kept nicely so we don't have to ask for that.

Service:- The waiters are very well mannered, soft spoken and really know their job, they will suggest you accordingly to choose the right dish also.
Food:- I have ordered crispy baby corn for starter and mixed fried rice, thai pork, schezwan chicken for main course and one sweet fresh lime soda and masala cold drinks at the end. Truly speaking i was really got amazed with the quantity they served, one plate of mixed fried rice is quite enough for a small family of three. The mixed fried rice they serve contains full of chicken, prawn, egg and pork (if you like), the taste was just impeccable. The schezwan chicken contains 8 pcs of really big size chicken pieces and taste was awesome. The Thai pork they serve i really have that kind of taste after a long time and I really mean it, the pork was perfectly cooked with right amount of spices and was so soft and tendered that it was melting in our mouth.
The quantity they served was so much that two of was not enough to finish it up, so the waiter packed it very nicely for us. When we left the restaurant we were so pleased that I personally went to the waiter and thanked him for the service.¬†
If you are looking looking for authentic Chinese then no doubt Hatari is one of the best option for you. The ambiance the service and the food with it's quantity and quality both is waiting there to amaze you. Strongly recommend all my friend and all foodies to give it a try it will not let you down I promise. Thank you.

Firstly, Hatari is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata and also one of the very few who have maintained their quality of food for over decades now.
I had a sweet corn soup which was pretty ordinary but was bowled over by golden crispy prawn. Finest prawn dish I've ever come across.
Next, the Shanghai noodles and Chilli chicken were served. Both were fantastically delicious.
The unique thing about Hatari is it's quantity per dish which means excellent value for money output. Highly recommended.

We ordered for fresh lime soda which was usual, mixed fried rice which was mote than enough for two hungry souls, a chicken and a mutton biriyani which was ok and chilli lamb which was quite good and enough for the 4 of us. Initially if you see the price it may seem on a higher side but as you see the quantity, price would seem reasonable. So its a restaurent highly recommended for groups.

Hatari is one of the oldest and most visited restaurants in town. The reasons are obvious. It has a prime location, serves good food, has a well to do ambiance and the service even if not outstanding, does stand apart when compared to restaurants of similar class.

I have lost count of the number of times I have visited this place. Some of my most favorite dishes at Hatari include Brown Glazed Duck, Thai Pork and Chilli Pork. The dishes of chicken and fish are equally good.

I have just one suggestion. Please be prepared to wait for over an hour during the Puja days.

According to our order i was provided with a bowl of brilliant biriyani, a full plate of chicken tandoori. Believe it or not it was soooo yummy that i'd love to go there again again. It'll get a full marks on quality and even quantity which was quite amazing. Trust me if you are fond of biriyanis you must visit this place at least once.

Recently went there to celebrate my Dad's birthday and tried their oriental delights. And it was really delightful. The lungfung soup with chicken suimai and the red pepper chilli fish had already made our day & then according to the staff's choice ordered Nasi Goreng rice with Fish in oyster and basil sauce and sauted lamb (exactly can't remember the name) and it was heavenly.

Location : Near triangular park Gariahat just opposite adi dhakeshwari bastralay, easy to locate.

Ambience: nice d√©cor large sitting area. Low soothing light suits the atmosphere.

No of vists: 1

Food review:

¬† ¬†items ordered: 1) Chicken drums of heaven

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 2) crispy chicken

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 3)chili garlic rice

¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 4) Korean lamb

1) CHICKEN DRUMS OF HEAVEN:- juicy tender chicken dipped in tangy spicy sauce . Really a must have dish when you come here

2) CRISPY CHICKEN: crisp spicy munchy boneless chicken another mouthwatering prospect.

3) CHILLY GARLIC RICE : rice cooked with a tangy spicy flavor. A tasty dish to suit any taste bud

4) KOREAN LAMB: sweet and sour gravy dish with large chunks of lamb. Gravy item is smooth yet flavor of some natural spices will take a burst inside your mouth making a great dish

Conclusion: A nice place to dine in. The quantity they serve is enough to serve 3 people .the only thing that I don‚Äôt like about this place is that whenever you come you have to wait in a queue to get your turn to seat as this place is always crowded during dining hours.

Pocket pinch: Rs 900-1000 for 3 people

Hatari has been catering to numerous foodies like me for quite some time now, when there wasn't much options to dine out along the Rashbehari - Bye Pass route. There are many options to choose from, won't say that all the items that I have had in all these years are good, but that can be considered. The price is okay, quantity generous and is quite popular equally amongst the college students and family.... 

And yes, they sell pork and duck too !!! I would always recommend this place to everyone... :-)

A household name in South Kolkata, Hatari has been there in the 1st floor above the saree shops in Triangular Park for as long as I can remember..
Have been there plenty of times in my childhood, however, reviewing this, based on my latest visit, the Pujas 2013..
Went there with a big group of friends, about 20, so it was a chaos waiting to happen.. When we finally settled and gave orders ranging from Biriyanis, to fried rice, to what nots, we realised, Hatari didn't serve deserts.. This was a big let down for us, and hope they address this issue in the future.. The food was nice, and decently priced..

Well, before starting, there goes a small prelude ... i have been referring zomato for a couple of years for my regular outing of food smacks ... but here it goes my 1st review today and for that i carefully chose something close to my heart and the one i have been regular for the last 10 years ..yes it is, Hatari

Hatari, a nice cosy multicuisine restro(though originally specialized in Chinese, now its cuisine variety is just more than impressive) located just opposite Triangular Park in the upper floor of the building which a very narrow staircase leads to.

Specialities of Hatari are its

1) ¬†Great Food Quality -- which has only raised over the tenure of time
2) Good Quantity -- Now and always their quantity is just the same, 1 main course and 1 side dish is enough for 2 people
3) Hospitality -- The staff are nice and sufficient to cater to your needs , though food preparation does take a bit time,which of course explains their great food quality
4) Variety -- Yes, you can have from Chinese to Indian to Mughlai to Oriental with servings from Chicken,Mutton,Prawn,Fish,Lamb,Duck,Pork ... Never been a veggie till now ,so can't comment on their variety in Veg :(
5) Pocket friendly -- With that taste and quantity, i believe its a pretty standard pocket pinch and that explains how i could actually manage to be a frequent out there in my school and college days with limited pocket money.


This review is not based on any certain visit. But just from my experience from the past. I loved a whole lot of their delicacies from Chicken Lollypop to Rice Noodles to Golden Prawns to Kabab to Thai Pork to Schezwan Chicken to Lamb. From Sundae to Tutti Frutti to the Fresh Lime Soda , seldom i have found any reason to complain.

Last but not the least , they maintain all the above key points even in the rush period like Durga Puja to the dull weekday afternoons,which i believe happens rare.

I love feeding my hungry tummy with the food of this restaurant because of its delicious and tasty food. This is one of my 'I can visit again and again' type restaurant. I love their crispy golden prawn which I find different every time I eat.
I would suggest not to try Crispy Chicken' which is too dry and a disastrous comparing to other items.
Try noodles, prawns and pork dishes.

Ambience is okay.
Food quality is very good and it tastes awesome.
Quantity can be shared by 2-3 people.
Wait time is long.
Some of the staffs are friendly, not all.
The entrance is hard to find for those new in that area.
The bad point is the distance from my place of residence.

That's why I want them to open a chain in north Kolkata, so we don't stay away from the good food anymore for a long time.

Hatari loacted on Rashbehari Avenue, one of the busiest areas in Kolkata is aways crowded due to it's prime location and value for money food. Though it serves Indian as weel, it is known mainly for it's Chineese. All Chineese dishes are well made and the quantity really generous so it makes great value for money when visiting in a group. Decor and ambience is not much to speak about. Quite cramped and not so cozy, Hatari still remains a favourite amongst the younger lot primarily due to its value for money offerings.

Location : Close to Triangular Park. Diagonally opposite to Dhakeswari Bastralaya.

Ambiance : Up a slim series of stairs , it lends an upscale yet subdued touch with Red hues all around. Square feet wise it's pretty huge !

Service : Although the cleaning department is up to speed but the waiters seem to take their own free time in bringing up the Menu even at a ¬†time around 5 pm when the rush is minimal. The waiting time takes upwards of 20 minutes !At least they were Well dressed and well spoken and most importantly knowledgeable.¬†

Food : We ordered the The Chicken Hot and Sour soup , The Mixed Fried Rice , and the Mongolian Chicken. Since I don't have a clue about soups at all I'll take my mother's word , that it was very good and very fulfilling. But I did notice that there was an awful lot of it ! and this trend continued with the Fried Rice and the Mongolian Chicken. The Fried Rice was so delicious with a different aroma and gave me a sense of satisfaction above all else. You think you've eaten it before so there's nothing new to look forward to ! But that's not the case here. Even the Mongolian Chicken was excellent . Taste , Consistency , Quantity ¬†you name it , they have it nailed !! At the end ordered Darsaan and my oh my it was such a pleasure. Best DARSAAN ever !!!!!!! . With a cute little ball of vanilla ice cream at the corner of the plate and the tasty sweet fries with sesame seeds I can swear by it that it's the best DARSAAN in south Kolkata.

Cost for 2: 900 plus ( Average Estimate )¬†

Final Conclusion : The first thing that hits you when you open the MENU is the variety of dishes ! From Duck to Pork preparations ! From Mughlai to Chinese it's Endless ! I will need 7-10 more outings to go through them all . But lemme tell you this: The QUANTITY they serve here is the best I've ever seen . The Fried Rice was so ample in amount that it lasted two people and yet there was 25% left !! Same was the scene when it came to the Mongolian Chicken. In fact even the DARSAAN was very ample in amount . No wonder they have lasted all these years with such a faithful clientele. If you're 2 people order for 1 , you'll see what I'm talking about. May not be cheap considering Chinese cuisine but No complaints apart from the waiting time.Thumbs Up .

After a very hectic day, with my wife visit Hatari on weekday. The ambience was ok, but a bit crowded, with tables kept very closely. Also on weekend need to wait in the long queue. We ordered from their Oriental menu (not available in Zomato), with starter Tangy Cripsy Chicken with crispy chicken cubes tossed sweet, sour & spicy sauces. It taste absolutely HEAVEN. For the main course we ordered Mixed Fried Rice & Gansu Lamb (Lamb preparation suggested by one of the Waiter). It was hot & spicy and delightfully tasty.
A highly recommended one for all food lovers..
Many more visit are due .... :-)

Now this is a place my parents love to take me to!! It's in a true sense a family restaurant 
The positives - the food, the taste, the quantity.. If you love crab and don't get it in restaurants that often Hatari is a place you should definitely try! Chilly crab dry is just mouth watering :) the burnt garlic fried rice is another win :)
The ambience is not that good..it's very noisy and a bit clumsy! But when the food tastes heavenly we don't really mind the noise and the crowd ;)
Cheers to Hatari!!!

Well its a very old restaurant.. and famous among the Bengali's.my brother who is a vig time foodie.. suggested us dis place.. and relyin on his taste buds we went there.. surely not disappointin.. however vegetarians have extremely limited options..the chinese is its speciality.. and the quantum of the food is huge.. we had ordered soups 1/2 but that seemed to be just never ending..it was supposed to be an appetizer but it turned out to be main course mostly.. the crispy mushrooms weren't too crispy.. but had good flavours hot and spicy.. for main course we ordered chilly paneer and garlic noodles.. the garlic noodles were well cooked.. authentic chinese taste.. and paneer was perfect.soft and juicy..the best was the dessert..the darsaan but ironically what we wanted in quantity was the ice cream which he just served one scoop which was definitely not enough so we ordered two more:) 
Ambience wasn't too great.. and definitely  it looked thar it has served maby years to kolkattans.. 
I know u guys must be wondering I said that we were full yet we had  3course meal that lays the fact that the food is worth givin a try..

Currently i would count Hatari in one of better multicuisine restaurants in south kolkata, rather in kolkata. it's really tough to understand its quality while entering through the ground floor entrance. but once you got the taste, you cann't stop by going there just once. i have visited here multiple times, lost count even. their ambience, stuffs, decor are quite good, a bit clumsy. but these wil be sufficed once you have the food.

in food i tried, chicken/mixed fried rice, chowmin, red wine fish/ chicken, chilli garlic chicken, schezwan fish, sanghai chicken and some more indian dishes also. i prefered the chinese ones specially. all of these preparations were very good, specially i should mention the red wine dishes. quantity wise it is huge, one plate would easily suffice two good foodies. so, go in a gang, else there is a  chance of wasting food. also considering the quantity, the price does not seem that high.

just one point i need to mention separately that if you are planning to go in weekends, keep time in hand. you must have to wait in a large queue, standing in a narrow passage. but i am again saying the food will worth the wait. so, i should highly recommend this place to everyone...

Had heard a lot about the history of Hatari and its authentic Chinese Food. Located bang opposite triangular park on rashbehari avenue, Hatari is located on the 1st floor there. Being a weekday we were expecting it to be more or less empty but we are surprised to find it choc a bloc. That was indeed a surprise. The staff was polite cordial and guided us to our table in one end. Service time is also decent, though not very fast. We had Chicken fried wontons for starters which were good. For main course we had Shrimp and Corn Fried Rice along with Sliced Fish in Chilli Basil Sauce. The food was tasty and lived upto the expectations. The best part of Hatari is its portion size. One portion can easily suffice 3 people with a decent appetite so whenever you go order keeping this in mind. Will wait to go back for more

We had ordered fried chicken wanton, shrimp and corn fried rice and sliced fish in oyster sauce.The food is quite delicious .The servings are very very generous and its great value for money. Maybe the menu doesn't offer anything new in terms of variety but it does a good job with what it offers.

am not really an aficionado of reviewing restaurants but for Hatari am ready to fag out my fingers!!......so this is one of those restaurants where i often pay a visit and still can't get enough of it...........the location will not be a problem even if u decide to board on public transports,since it's located centrally on the main road in the prime location of triangular park(pretty close to gariahat char rastar more).........once you get seated you will realize how pleasing the ambience is!..............the quantity of food they provide is comparatively huge and is worth mentioning......but at the same time they don't compromise with their quality..........no special mention of any food item for you should try out every single item on the menu.........even when every seat is occupied it wont appear to be bursting at the beams!.......this place is also pocket friendly if you visit in groups.............apt for every occasions,be it a date or birthday treat or family outings.............and one last thing to be mentioned is the etiquette of the waiters...they perform their job efficiently and would never disappoint you with their attitude!!...So finally this is a place which you can't visit only ONCE and hope it turns out to be your favourite as well!!! :)

Traditional yet absolute beauty of a family restaurant. Very friendly staff, warm ambience. Hatari have their signature with very popular dishes even. 
Its speciality is Chinese/Oriental Cuisine so order from the white menu card (oriental special). 
Fish and peppers is a must for starters. While for main dish Burnt Garlic Coriander Rice and Chengdu Chicken is a must try. This chicken is deceptively hot. At start u will feel nothing slowly u will enjoy the heat afterwards. 
Huge proportion of food. One dish is more than enough to feed 2 people hence priced that way.

One of old yet marvellous eatery serving chinese food which you just should not miss. 

On special days/Holidays expect long queues to get in.

The most reasonable rate restaurant in Kolkata and no one can beat the quantity which is provided by this joint. In terms of the quantity this is truly amazing. If you think that you are going to have a plate of friend rice and finish it by yourself you are completely wrong it will be extremely difficult for 2 people to finish off the dish.¬†

I had tried the reshmi kebab and the tandoori chicken which was good enough but not that great, chicken fried rice and green chilli chicken and to me these were a bit below the average mark. Service is a bit sluggish.

If there is a competition about quantity of food gets served in a dish then Hatari will win it by miles. Not that quality gets compromised. 
A classic Chinese food joint in Kolkata who has seen how this business has evolved over ages. To stay in the business they have always adapted changes.
Superb ambiance after recent renovation. Staffs are very polite and they will not try to sell you more dishes rather will advice not to over-order.
Starter: Crispy Golden Prawn & Chilli Lamb
Main Course: Mixed Fried Rice, Mongolian Chicken & Chicken in Red Wine
No mention is required about taste as they have proved themselves since ages. Each one of the above dishes were masterpiece and meat/fish was succulent. Chilli lamb will surely tickle your taste buds.
However one need to wait in long queue upto an hour depending on rush hours.
Tip: If you are opting for home delivery try to avoid crispy coating stuff as they becomes soggy soon.

A foodie would definitely want to try this place out if he/she is interested in trying a variety of non-veg items (chicken, fish, crab, pork, lamb, duck, squids, shrimps, prawns ) in oriental preparations ! They also serve North Indian dishes but since I've not tasted them , I can't comment on them, though I've heard they taste quite good.The place is situated on the main road, in the prime location of Triangular Park. It is extremely convenient to reach this place through public transport. The cost is absolutely okay considering the huge quanitity they serve. If you want to taste their huge variety of items,it would cost you less if you went in large groups rather than in groups of 2 or 3. The service is quite swift and the waiters are polite too. The ambience is good for big groups of people since there is a lot of noise and chattering of people all around. But it really feels good and airy inside. The place also accepts SODEXO MEAL PASSES.

All the items I've tasted here are wonderful. Some of the must tries among the starters are CHILLI PORK (DRY) , LAMB WITH GREEN PEPPER AND RED CHILLI, SQUID FRIES IN BUTTER GARLIC. The quantity of the starters is enough for 3-4 people. The spices and flavours really enlighten your taste buds ! I've heard the duck, prawn and crab preparations are equally good.¬†
Coming to the main course, what you MUST try is the BURNT GARLIC CORIANDER RICE. It is simply awesome. The smell of burnt garlic, the long strands of the fried rice together with the innumerable pieces of chicken and shrimps in it make you go crazy ! The other rice preparations are also worth tasting. Among the side dishes I've had PORK IN OYSTER SAUCE and SANGHAI CHICKEN. Both seemed delicious.

So I'd recommend this restaurant if you want to spend a good family time or throw a party to a large group of friends. Try it out peeps ! Cheers ! :-)

I have been to Hatari countless times now. But yet i return there each time because of its strategic location in south Kolkata and the quantity and quality of food they serve at affordable price. Its an apt place for treats and family get togethers. And the staff there is also quite well mannered, the ones that i have encoutered at least.
So if you are craving for chinese and yet want to go easy on your pockets, do visit Hatari.

Been there many times. The interior decor has changed three times since i have been visiting and Hatari never lets me down. The management has become a little sluggish in serving the food, but the food leaves no place to complain. When out to treat a big crowd without a big hole in the pocket, this is the place to be.

Ordered a takeaway meal which I went to pick up - a tedious process from start to end due to the inefficiency or just plain foolishness of the person handling the telephone. The food is OK, the typical Calcutta - Chinese cuisine, also available at a thousand other restaurants. Not oily or tasteless and reasonable portions.

Why I like Hatari?

Simple, It not only satisfies my taste buds but also keep my wallet happy. :)
The only bad thing about this place is there is always a que outside the restaurant.

Park street is too far away ?? Tangra too?? But that Chinese craving is driving you mad! Drop in to Hatari, Deshapriya Park and be delighted and satisfied. A breath of relief to South Kolkatan Chinese Lovers Hatari scores big on rating list. Be it birthday parties, treats, family outings this place can never turn you down. During Pujo/ other festives, beware of the long queue! People here are so friendly, patience and quick to serve you won't delay much time once inside. Surely the quality but the quantity is also worth mentioning. Each plate of main course serves 3 people minimum! Each plate of poultry or meat has 8 pcs or more! Their food deserves special mention:
Soups:
Chicken Sweet Corn, Chicken Clear, Chicken Mushroom, Talu Mein.
Starters:¬†
Pan Fried Fish -- must try!, Chili babycorn, Chicken Lollypop, Chicken Drumsticks, Momos, Wantons, Red Pepper chicken.
Main Course:
Cantonese Cowmein, Mixed Fired Rice, American Chopsuey
Main Course Side Dish:
Any chicken dish be it oyster, with black mushroom, in red wine or the normals like chilli chiekn or garlic or ginger or lemon or sweet and sour. Their Fish and Prawns are of top quality do try anything from the varied list according to your taste. I have even tried their chilli pork and i loved it ! their shredded lamb is also my favorite.
Desserts:
The Brownie with ice cream is a hot favorite, it does get over by 8-ish ¬†so order soon, the tutty-fruity is my uncle's fav and we have never seen him finishing it alone, the quantity is huge!
Love Hatari!!

The first time I went here, I had to literally find it like anything ! but it is situated near hindustan park on 1 st floor. on the row of Indian silk house.
This is a very old restaurant and has maintained some good standards.

Food:- Really nice. Very good quantity and reasonable pricing. The taste is also very good. I love the pork dishes here. Crab sweet corn soup is my favorite. 

Staff:- well trained courteous staff. No complains. 

Only problem is sometimes you have to stand in line for even 45 minutes to get a place and during rush hours the taste of food degrades everytime!

I would ask you to go here when it is empty.

This particular outlet of Hatari will always be special to me as my friends and I have been their regular customers since our school days. Hatari is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants in Calcutta and the go-to place for good Chinese food. The enormous amount of food that you get for the price you pay satisfies both your palate and your pocket. Their renditions of Thai Soup, Pan Fried Chilli Fish and American Chopsuey are arguably the best I have ever had. Once you visit this place, it is guaranteed that you will keep on coming back as they never let you down in terms of taste.

For long we all knew that this was the No 1 place for Chinese cuisine in South Kolkata. You will be amazed to know the wide range of Indian & Muglai fare this place has to offer. Try the Biriyani and you will forget the Arsalans & Shirazs of this world and that is really an understatement. Make sure you have some time in hand during the peak hours as Hatari is always full and people wait in a queue to get a place.

Overall Hatari is an experience that packs in great cuisine too.

This place could be called the Waldorf of South Calcutta. It is one of the oldest chinese restaurant in South Kolkata region which serves delicious chinese food at a very reasonable rate. The ambiance is nothing great but nonetheless a must visit place if you are somewhere in that part of Kolkata and want to try out some good Chinese cuisine. I love the pan fried fish available here. It's yummy with a perfect blend of spiciness and sweetness in it.  The various types of soup are a must try. I specially like the Tom yum soup. The chilli garlic fried rice is to die for.  I'd you want to try something bland yet tasty try the fish and mushrooms in white sauce. It is excellent.

One of the oldest Chinese restaurants in South Kolkata, Hatari was always a birthday treat getaway, or a after exams first lunch, or a puja time night out restaurant. With its brilliance in Chinese, Hatari is a favourite of many in Kolkata who wants a hearty Chinese lunch or dinner, without too much of a hole in their wallet. The duck, panfried fish, chilly baby corn are some of my personal favourites, when teamed up with the delicious Schezwan fried rice..

Hatari a name well known to most people in kolkata. They had also opened a branch in siliguri but for some reasons it shut down. My dad had mentioned this place to me first . Chinese at its best was what i was told. My first encounter with Hatari was in siliguri. I had ordered quite a number of dishes like the chicken sweet corn soup, chilly chicken, hot and sour crab soup, chicken bharta and noodles. I was quite shocked with their indian dishes because it was really yum. Therefore, i can say that not only the chinese but their indian too is worth trying. Just few days back i went to their rash behari outlet. Quite a crowd puller on a weekday i must say. Ambience was little above average, though i thought it was very noisy and crammed. ¬†Service was ok and everyone was relishing the food they had ordered.¬†

Everything was good except their crab soup which was soo tangy that i could not get the crabby feeling or taste. Apart from that i was highly disappointed with the behaviour of their waiters. Unprofessional to the core. They were actually using bengali slangs aloud against some customers for being loud and having a naughty kid. I mean if you are soo annoyed go and talk to the customers and bring to their notice that their kid is creating nuisance for the other guests. Instead they came near the order counter and were cursing. Really sad.¬†

I hope Hatari jots down this and trains their waiters and perhaps upgrade the ambiance with some basic dinning rules so that everyone can have a good time.

This is such a special joint and i have been here innumerable times. As my college was nearby we ended up going there because we believe from the bottom of our heart that the quality and quantity of food that they serve will not be served anywhere else. Yesterday was more special for me as i visited this place with my school friends and as it was sunday we had to wait in the queue for some time but still we were excited as one of my friend was giving us a treat here. We ordered pan fried chili fish, fried rice, pan fried noodles and sha chein chicken (not sure about the spelling sorry!). Pan fried fish is my all time favourite and again it did not disappoint me, apart from this all the other dishes were also lip smacking but as usual we couldn't finish and so had to pack it (it is not because we eat less but because their quantity is enormous. Based on my previous visits i would also like to mention that their Thai soup is awesome and one should definitely give it a try. I wish they continue serving us with this consistency and thus go on satisfying our hungry souls.

The one at the Rashbehari Avenue is a convenient place for a South Calcuttan like me to take my friends to when I'm celebrating an auspicious occasion.This outlet greets you with a soft mellifluous music as you enter.¬†The dishes served here are equally laudable in quality and quantity and the the ones who work here not only have amiability about their person, but also know how to satiate their customers. One can even enjoy lavishly without the slightest apprehension of slitting their pockets.The place is totally hygienic (at least what I gather from my experiences), although rumors about a mouse scurrying under the couches and the degradation of the quality of the dishes are surfacing.

Well it was my first visit to this popular for chinese dishes restaurant but however I ordered our very own Indian dish..chicken biryani..and seriosly even the most superlative food critic would never be able to find even 1% disbalance with the ingredients.It was perfect. Crispy chicken was ordered as starter, though the quantity initially looked like impossible to be gulped down by a single person, one of those chicken on your taste bud and you will compete with your fellow luncheon friends to grab the greatest share.Yes they are awesome! The decor and seats are fine, clean, though a bit crowded, and a queue is always there, but given the mindblowing taste of the food I guess we cant' avoid the queue nor can we complain! :-)

This place is the epitome of proper dining for value and then some. It starts of on a high note as there is a long row of paid parking outside of you choose to come by car. Chances are there might be small wait because of a waiting queue because the place is that good. The staff are very courteous the food is amazing and the environment is very homely and the seating is secluded enough from table to table. It's commendable that they have maintained standards even after reaching where they are now. The lamb and pork dishes are the obvious must tries and for the less adventurous any biriyani will give you a momentary bliss. It's kind of those must go restaurants and even fit in a meal for 500 rupees if your really tight. Do your palette a favor and enjoy what dining is amidst all the shopping you can do in the adjacent stores

Sorry for writing a review so late.. Been there so many times. My favourite place for hang out in college days. Whenever I come back to kolkata i spent my one evening  at Hatari.

Ambience: Good but not worth writing. People who love food can easily jump on what Hatari serves instead of seeing the ambience ;-)

Food: You will love whatever they serve. Pocket friendly and reasonable rates :-)
Must have Mongolian Chicken and chicken prawn fried rice. Pork dishes are good as well. 

Quantity : One plate can easily satisfy two hungry folks.
Guys please go and enjoy weekends. Best for get togethers. A must go for food lovers.

From the outside- it's not the type of restaurant I'd usually go for. The staircase leading up to the one-side open-to-air corridor leads to a rather unassuming door that opens to the restaurant. Once you are in though, it's another story. The menu is extensive. You can tell, they have a good regular clientele. Each main portion is good enough to feed 2.5 hungry adults by itself. I recommend going in a group of 4 here. We were 2 and the waiter kindly, and honestly told us that what we had ordered was way too much (we'd ordered a starter and 2 mains). He was right. We could eat about 1/3rd of the total. The taste was pretty good. I'd go there again no doubt. I recommend this place.

Hatari has been 'THE' family restaurant for the Kars since we moved to Kolkata 2001, this review will be with that point of view as I try to represent the experience as a family. This place is at easy to find for any south calcuttan, right on the rashbehari road.The ambience isn't the highlight of this place, but it has got much better over time, I won't complain if you plan to go on family meal here. We have been here a lot many times and have tried almost all the items on their very diverse menu(the prices of which we saw increase over time :P) , right from the specialities from our monarchist neighbour in the east to our very own north Indian cuisine. The noodles are done greatly here, not too oily, not soggy and taste is evenly spread out and it just feels great, it is the same for the fried rice. The Chinese dishes right from Manchurian to chilli to garlic to ginger to lemon are great here(haven't tried thai here), are a perfect complement to the rice/noodle dish you decide to take. The Indian is great here as well, the menu is limited on the Veg section, we actually have run out of options here, so they can use a refresh out here. The Chicken Tawa masala needs a special mention as it has been our favourite in the Indian chicken specialities. Rotis and Nans are done well and not a pinch to the pocket like any other dishes on the menu.  
Will absolutely recommend this for anyone in the city who are looking for a great Chinese option out here. This place has always been easy on the pocket. A special shout-out to the wonderful staff and manager and even the person at the door who manages queues pretty well on those crowded weekends.

One of the oldest chinese restaurant in south cal..I remember having food from hatari not less than 5 yrs ago..I was looking for home delivery and checked the reviews of hatari.. to my surprise I saw a good rating which motivated me to order Chinese food from thr... I must mention it was very good.. and they had improvised on the dishes and is now comparable to any good restaurant serving Chinese cuisine. the taste was authentic and the serving was decent. we had ordered for chilli pork which was excellent with the right tangy flavour.. hakka noodles and chicken fried rice and hunan chicken were perfect too. they delivered it within 20 mins.
waiting to try their other dishes too.. excellent food. really impressed.

Hatari has always been a favorite among chinese food lovers. Their authentic cuisine and wonderful variety of chinese food makes it one of my favorites. 
Pros- 1. Brilliant location
2. Quick and organized service
3. Large proportions(One plate easily serves two)
4. Nice soothing ambiance perfect to take your family out to
5. Affordable. 

Cons- Now everyone would complain about this. But I guess they can't help it if they are so popular. But sometimes that queue goes right down to the street! Speaks a lot about how it's worth the wait

Had mofu tofu and korean rice and loved both of them. The pork here is very well cooked. and the fish here is the best i have tasted.definitely will recommend.The quantity of each dish is enough for at least 3 people and the prices are also quite reasonable.But hatari is not for couples because then it will be a waste of money.though you can pack the extra but still hatari is best for groups of 5 or more.

gets 3.5/5 from me

Located at proper deshapriya park, Hatari appears as my first choice when i plan to have a chinese lunch or dinner and that too without making a whole in my wallet. The food is no doubt very good and too this i must also add about the quantity. The quantity is unbelievably high. Taking everything in account it can be considered as a good resturant with a cozy ambience and nice food .

Chinese food and Hatari are like synonymous. One of the best Chinese resturants in town, with no second thoughts. Its a resturant I frequently visit, yet I don't get tired of it because it has so much to offer. Firstly, its really hard to get a table at Hatari as its always full, with people lining up outside the resturant. The ambience inside is pleasant. The food, Omg, amazing. My personal all time favourites:
1. Drums of heaven. Not has there been one day when I've visited Hatari and not had the drums of heaven. In one word, its delicious and does complete justice to its name. 
2. Pork cooked in oyster sauce. Hatari serves fine quality pork. Its mouth watering with the perfect balance of flavours. Its tender, tasty I and totally love it.
3. Lastly, the Chinese chopsuey. It just totally an unjustifiable, delicious weakness :)
Well apart from this most of the chicken and prawns dishes are simply great. They are extremely generous with their quantity which does make their food indirectly pocket friendly. Once you've been here, you'll definitely want income back for more. Cheers!

This is my favourite restaurant I just love the ambience and the food. My favourites are the chopsuey's all of them and the lamb preparations they simply cook the best. The quality is too good and the quantity of every dish is too much for a single person and the service quality is also great. Hatari's biriyani is also one of my favourites. It's absolutely the best value for money restaurant I have ever been to. The only disadvantage being Hatari is slightly costly than the other budget restaurant's but it provides full value for every penny you spend.

It's the place where I go in regular intervals.  The quality and quantity of food is very good. A single plate can easily help to hungry souls. The thai chicken with extra spice is too osum to make your taste buds pleased. Want to visit again  and again.

I almost tried every chinise dishes over here.
All the chicken dishes are tasty .I loved the shezwan lamb here, it is lip smaking. All the varieties of rice , noddols are also very good.
Ambience is nothing special. This place is pocket frienly and I loved almost all the Chinese dishes over here.

This place is the best for a full stomach meal .. and you will get the best out of your budget. 
Great for family and friend gatherings .... I went there with my friends probably 7-8 persons . The fact is when the group is big every people give order of their own choices . I was glad to find that unlike most restoras the waiter didn't object to any uncommon dish , and everything was available within the given time.

the first thing i check about restoras is their cleanliness , and this place was as clean as it can get . No unhygienic food here , everything neat and clean 
The environment is calm and not noisy , the area is big to its not crammed a tall..

this place serves pork and lamb unlike most restoras in the nearby areas , so if u want to try something new definitely go to this place

Very old place. Still hasn't lost its charm. Good family restaurant in south Kolkata. Variety of dishes (Indian, Chinese, Thai). I have mostly tried the Chinese. Food has been good every time. They maintain consistency, which is what is needed. No need to visit China Town if you stay in south Kolkata. And quantity is ideal for two individuals. Price is pocket friendly. Their ice cream sundaes were also nicely made.

One bad experience was with fish fry. It turned out to be made of Basa and not Bhetki. 

Would definitely recommend this place if you are around south Kolkata. Beware, you are likely to be on waitlist if you visit around lunch time on weekends. Go a little early I would suggest.

Used to come in Hatari a number of times during college days. Then went away to Mumbai for job. Now again im back here and went to Hatari yesterday almost after 4-5 years. But felt the same great taste as usual with good service. Be it starters or the main course or the ice cream at last, everything tasted awesome. One of the best restaurant in kolkata for foodaholics :-)

It was a great experience at Hatari! I had heard a lot of good things about this restaurant and finally the chance came! We visited the place, 5 hungry giants! Ambience was good and cozy. We have ordered Red pepper chicken for starter and it was so good we ordered another plate :D. Then chicken rice noodles, chicken hakka noodles, Singapore chicken and hot gerlic chicken followed. All was upto the mark but personaly, I didn't like the rice noodles there, though it is one of my favorite dish.
So, overall, the food was good and bill was pocket friendly! :)

I popped into this place with my two very special person in the afternoon of a saturday. There was no vacant places and we had to struggle through a long queue to reach to our destination. I am delighted with their services.The management, staffs and others were very polite and organized. They served our foods in just 10 mins. We ordered chef's special chicken, fried rice and sanghai noodles. I don't think that I am even able to judge about the quality of the food,( it's just incredible). And same goes with the quantity. I wonder how could they make profit by giving us so much of good food in such a price? Trust me fellas, if you want to try the true master's food in kolkata, you should go to this place.

A very nice family restaurant. The food is god, the proportions are a lot compared to other restaurants in its category. The location is convenient too, and families who like to eat out at affordable places but would like to avoid the hustle and bustle of restaurants located at malls or popular places like Park Street would love this place. It gets crowded during weekends when you have to wait in line but they serve and deliver very fast.

Hatari is a familiar name for the south kolkata people. This place is always bustling.On special days or weekends u may have to stand in a queue.
Its mainly known for its quantity and quality.But with time the quality has gone down but the quantity being the same.Not a single person leaves this place without a parcel. The fried rice and Chilli chicken is a favorite of mine.
You can also opt for Mongolian Chicken: It is a starter dish and it is absolutely awesome. The dipping is fabulous too.

Although, We dint like the preparation of Lamb. We ordered Lamb with Green Chilli and Red Pepper and it was very sticky and the meat not at all cooked nicely.

Dishes are good but the ambience is not up to the mark...entrance and the staircase is not at all spacious and thus creates a great chaos during heavy crowd...also the sofas are too closely arranged that may hamper the privacy..but dishes like malai kebab and dessert such as brownie can help us to raise its rating points

Visited Hatari long time ago (maybe 2-3 years back) with a friend and her mother.
It was Saturday afternoon and hence the place was very crowded. Thankfully we found a table for us.

Food we ordered :-
1) Chicken hot and sour soup : Loved it. It had a balance between tangy and spicy. Perfect.

2) American Chopsuey : I just love this dish and try to order it wherever I go. Yes I know, it has a lot of calories but is'nt it difficult to avoid stuffs like this? Anyway. I loved it here, too.:D

3) Chicken with mushrooms : My friend is a diehard fan of this dish and makes it a point to order it whenever she visits Hatari. It has chunks of chicken and mushroom cooked in the white chinese gravy. Very comforting taste.

4) Mixed Hakka Noodles : Really tasty. Too good.

5) Schezuan Chicken : Again. Very nice.

[Note : The food they serve is huge in quantity. One plate is more than enough for 2 people with a big appetite.]

This is the most favorite restaurant of mine . I am fan of Hatari food.
The food cost and quality and also quantity(which is ignored by many places) are the best. Till date I ate there 50 times maybe and even ordered for home delivery from Golf Green Hatari and I am never disappointed with anything. I would always recommend people to eat from Hatari if you love Chinese. Yummy food !! The best !

Will always recommend this restaurant to any Chinese food lovers ! Please visit there soon if you haven't yet !

Happy Eating :) !

With so many options for Chinese in Kolkata these days, the fact that Hatari still shines in the food map of the city is perhaps a testimony to the delicious food they serve consistently.
The interiors are done in red and white and the seats are comfy. They give you two menu cards to choose your dishes from (Zomato is showing only one) and be sure to scan properly or you might miss a few gems. 
We ordered the drums of heaven for the starters and chilli garlic prawn, Korean lamb and sweet and sour crab to go with mixed burnt ginger rice and mixed shanghai noodles. All the dishes were well made and tasty but the prawns and the burnt ginger rice were outstanding! I have never tasted such succulent prawns in chinese sauces and the burnt ginger rice is to be tasted to be believed!
The famed quantity of Hatari makes one dish enough for atleast 3 people. The 7 of us ate to our hearts' content and we still had to carry some food home and the bill showed a shade over 2k! 


P.S. Hatari stays filled to the brim during mealtimes even on weekdays and they don't accept reservations on friday, saturday and sunday so be prepared to wait.

Hatari has been my favorite place now for more than a decade. I have thrown parties here, treated friends in college on birthdays to bridal showers, dated here, and done a myriad of other things, all over super awesome food that was truly truly pocket friendly. You cannot help but marvel at the generous portion size of the food here - its unlike any other. They always had items which were a tad out of the league for a Kolkata setting - like honey chicken, lemon chicken, singapore chicken - back in 2003 these were really new! I love their burnt garlic and spinach fried rice, mouthwatering and one bowl is sufficient for three average eaters - what more do you ask for...Now they have introduced more exotic asian cuisine like chilly duck, mapo tofu and nasi goreng which are equally good, though the price has gone up a little (totally justified). 
I also like the fact that they serve very decent indian (my dad would not do Chinese so often). Also the tutty fruity icecream is a a must try!

In a group of five we went to Hatari for dinner.Asked for water regular or mineral...ordered for mineral but was served with regular...inattentive staff..:(
For starters we ordered masala colddrinks,sweet lime soda,a plate of pork chilly dry and a plate of hariali chicken kebabs...

The cold drinks were sprinkled,with some masala..not done properly..

The pork chilly was too good...tender yet chewy with thick belly pieces...hot spicy and tangy...instant hit.

The hariali kebabs were well done and were tender and moist..nyc

For main course we ordered for mixed fried rice,chicken rice noodles,garlic chicken and pan fried chilly fish.
Okayy the amount was too much for five people..needed ayleast one more to finish off...;)

Main course was a dissapointment ...food was bland and the fish was too sweet...not happy..

Overall good and btr if ur in a big group.

Happy eating..:)

It is a perfect place to hang out and enjoy food with family and friends. Situated in Rashbehari Avenue, Hatari provides perfect ambience and delicious bite. I love their lamb and duck preparations. I also recommend the Crispy golden prawn and Chicken in red wine. The food is great in terms of both, quality and quantity. It should be on the wish list of every people in Kolkata.

Whenever we plan Hatari... that is nearly 1 hour drive from my residence at Lake Town... the process of salivation gets into emergency mode.

Hatari is the most popular restaurant for my family and friends. Our regular picks-

1. Thai Soup- No one in Kolkata can serve this typical distinct soup. I dnt know if it is authentic chinese, all I know is, it is delectable and an absolute must if we visit the restaurant.

2. Chilly Pork- They serve perfectly cooked chilly pork. My wife, who isnt fond of pork loves Chilly Pork here. One positive point is, they serve lean meat. In many joints, they serve pieces of bacon/fat instead of meat. Chilly Pork is a die for item for this restaurant.

3. Golden Fried Prawns- This is the signature item of Hatari and deserves in true sense its status. Its beyond words to describe the item.

4. Thai Fried Rice/ Shanghai Fried Rice- We opt any of these two. Both are extremely exotic and tasting them can only make you feel the taste.

5. Pan fried Chilly Fish- This is the must try side dish at Hatari.

Pros-

1. Pocket friendly.
2. Distinct taste
3. Sumptuous portions served- one plate fried rice is more than adequate for two adults.
4. Moderate ambience

Cons-

1. No table booking. Excessive queue.
2. No waiting lounge- you actually stand in a queue like while you used to do for reserving railway tickets.

I had heard so much about Hatari, that being a North-Calcuttan, I, along with my friends decided to drop in for dinner. And Hatari didn't disappoint.
The restaurant is generally crowded, especially on festive occasions. However we were fortunate enough to get seats without having to wait.
For starters, we ordered Dry Chilli Pork. The pork was excellent, cooked just to perfection, with the right amount of heat and spice. 
Then we had vegetable fried rice, Hot Garlic Chicken and Sweet and Sour Garlic Pork. Too much garlic in the names, but that was their recommendation, when we asked to suggest spicy dishes. We were reluctant to order fearing both would have similar tastes. But we weren't let down. Both the dishes were good. 
I specially loved Sweet and Sour Garlic Pork. The chicken was a bit tough, and it was like normal garlic chicken. I missed the 'hot' factor in there. 
Nevertheless, it was a lovely experience, and I am definitely looking forward to pay a visit in the near future.

The best place to be when you have to treat a lot of people and your budget is really not in good terms with your wishes. Excellent food, excellent quantity, no compromise with quality and service. The chinese here is just superlatively good at the price they offer you, and also the quantity. 3 fried rice is enough for 5 people. Such is the quantity they give. Be it the peak time for them, like Durga Puja, or days when people are hardly seen on roads, the service is excellent. Been here several times, and have had wonderful dining experience every time. The only problem is the long queue on peak days.( the rush can be compared to that of peter cat's, though the latter would win it hands down ;)  )
Cost for 2 in my case : 750 approx (no alcohol).

The worst place about this place is the queue which is too long most of the time.. An hours wait in the queue is nothing out of the ordinary.. But once you do get in it's quite a place... Nice looking.. Seems a bit too crowded on a difficult day. But then comes the food which led to me rating this place so high on zomato. It's top notch Chinese food. The dry chilli pork is great. Noodles are a delight. Other cuisines are equally great. Delightful place to dine if you have a lot of time in your hand...

If there was a restaurant which could bear the tag of 'value for money' , this would be it. The food is amazing. The quantity is better and the ambiance is great as well. The lamb over here is something you'd want to try out and also the dry chili chicken. I really have no complains with this place. I'd give it a 5 star rating if they could have the option to use chop sticks, though.

Its a tradition that I take my parents out for lunch to Hatari at least once when I visit home. A simple yet authentic Chinese cuisine joint, Hatari serves one of the best portions in the town. 

My favourite spread at Hatari is Pork Mushroom soup, Chilli pork, Rice noodles and Prawn in Garlic sauce!

Just the place for a quiet dinner with your family or friends, without a big pocket pinch. Does not compromise on the taste though ! And the quantity served in each dish makes me order with care, else there's always some leftovers.
Have tasted their honey duck, pork, pan fried fish, golden fried prawn and satay chicken- every one was worthy of a recommendation. 
They have started indian cuisine too, but i prefer the chinese. 
Overall, a budget friendly nice place.

This restaurant located near the rashbehari metro station, more precisely near triangular park, is well accessable and according to the frequency, lists high on my chart of dine outs....

most of the time it's well packed with people, sometimes you may have to wait to get a place specially in weekends, but all these goes off the mind once you enter as the staffs greet you with all  their decency and warmth.... the ambience inside is quite sober and the seating is comfortable.... The place is very much suitable for a happy family time....

So telling you about my last visit, we ordered crispy chilli babycorns, mixed fried rice, mandarin chowmein(gravy)  and thai pork... the starter was very tasty and well the amount was enough for all 3 of us.... Next came the main course which was very delicious and the quantity was more than perfect. The pork was well cooked, soft and juicy having an unique taste, a definite recommendation for you all.... my other favourites are the chicken in red wine, thai chicken, shanghai friedrice, Cantonese chowmein, and Korean friedrice....
The Chinese dishes though not authentic but is very well prepared and commendable....I haven't yet tried the indian food here so no comments about it...

for me, 
Food quality: 4.2/5
quantity: 4.8/5
presentation: 4.2/5
ambience:4/5
sevice: 4/5
value for money: 4/5

give it try folks, you will definitely love the Chinese cuisine offered here....

Been there a lot of times. The atmosphere is a completely a kind of family dinner place. The staffs are good and attend warmly. U'll always find the place crowded.Coming to the food its good. The smoked lamb and the sanghai fried rice is not at all good as expected. Last day I had crispy chicken,and its tastes soooo good. Even the chilly fish(though very spicy) tastes awesome. Averall serving a good quantity, reasonable price its a perfect place for a family dinner/lunch.

*EDIT* Pics attached post recent visit.

Hatari a place I have been visiting since 1996. The food quality was so finger licking delicious that I could never think I can eat anywhere except here.

So my first zomato review is more of a general nature. But I would also mention my most recent visit which was on 1st May, 2014. Let's keep this review to the point:

Pros:
a. Superb Ambiance. A definition of family restaurant which is mainly thanks to no alcohol system.
b. The food is as I said finger licking delicious. And the best part is their consistency with the quality. Its the rarest occasion when I can say the quality is anything less than best.
c. Chinese cuisine. They just excel in this field. Every item is made to perfection.
d. Along with quality the quantity is ample.
e. Behavior of stuffs. Though its a basic requirement for hospitality business still their stuff requires a special mention. They are always smiling and helping. Another thing I have noticed that there are not much change in stuff in the past 18 years. Somehow it depicts good employee oriented policies. And we customers get the benefits of such policies. As in my case most of the stuffs already know what I would order. They also inform me what are the new things that I should try. Its a homely experience.

Cons:
a. Hatari has slowly came in the ranks of pricey places. Earlier the price seemed right. But now it has shot upwards and now its rising curve is pretty steep.
b. The service remains a bit slow for the past 15 years.
c. The ambiance of inside chamber doesn't match with the original room. Its a bit dull.

On my visit of 1st May I have ordered One Chicken Prawn fried rice, Chicken with red wine. The food quality was as usual great. So as I said Hatari's best part is their consistency in quality and worst part is inconsistency in pricing.

Happy Eating folks!

Been to this place many times, but the experience is going down day by day. 

Had pretty bad experience last week, on dry chilli chicken starter. Chicken was damm hard (not at all soft), seems being prepared in afternoon. When asked about it to waiter, Mr. P K Baiddo, he said he will check in kitchen. He never came back with feedback, and after reminder, he said he informed. My wife decided to leave half eaten, as  food was not too great. the service was also not polite enough. It seems Hatari is getting complacent in their service area as well.

Parceled rest of the rice and gravy item for home, which was average. The chinese taste was there, but the "tastyness" seems to be going down. 

Time for you to improve taste and service !

Its located at triangular park.. Have been there twice though one year back.. Its pretty late to write a review after a year but then I wasn't aware of zomato.. :-P The ambience was good.. Food quality was good.. The prices were not much high and was quite affordable.. In short, I liked it and would like to visit it soon. :-)

Had been to Hatari for the very 1st time today. Had heard a lot about it from my friends. 5 of us entered Hatari in the midst of shopping for a quick lunch. Ambiance and interior wise there is nothing much to mention. Location wise, its very near to the Priyo Gopal Bishoyi sari showroom at Triangular Park in Gariahat. Anyway, coming to the menu now. We had ordered 2 starters and 2 main course dish, which are as follows:
Starters: Red Pepper Chicken & Chicken Wanton
Main Course: Chicken with Red Wine & Cantonese Noodles.
Both the starters were extremely delicious and yummy, and chicken with red wine too was good.
Price came to around 1100 which was pretty cheap for 5.
Recommended and would like to visit again.

Well if you can have enough patience to survive the long queue outside this place you are in for a treat. Though this place is hyped for its chinese food but trust me the biriyani here is awesome. I have a thing for biriyanis which are neither too dry nor too sloppy and it just fits the bill. 
Decor: 3/5
Ambience: 3/5
Food:4.5/5
Service: 3.5/5. There is so much rush they really cant help it.
Ideal for a simple evening with friends and family,

I guess this the most crowded restaurant i came across after Petercat. This my most visited restaurant from childhood. Have seen a lot of changes in management and cooking. Now i can say they are awesome. They aren't authentic Chinese cooking restaurant but what ever they did & does is good. Upon all they have friendly waiters and quality is huge. i am crazy for their sweet corn soup and chilly chicken. I am sure that many people reading this review has already visited the restaurant and those who didn't please visit you will not regret.

Hatari is a familiar name for the south kolkata people.This place is always bustling.On special days or weekends u may have to stand in the queue.
Its mainly known for its quantity and quality.But with time the qualty has deteroited quantity being the same.Not a single person leaves this place without a parcel.I am not kidding .Even I do the same.
Its a waste to visit this people all alone or in a couple.You are surely gona waste food.Its best for big groups.

Coming to ambience.They have maintain the same ambience through out the years.The place has its own warmth and charm.
Coming to food :Almost all the chinese items are good and  you are certainly gonna like them if you are a first time vistor.They have a typical own style of chinese taste which is Hatari style chinese.
Amogst all chicken in red wine,Sweet n sour chicken ,Thai chicken,Mongolian chicken/fish/prawn,garlic noodles,mandarin noodles(gravy),Shanghai fried rice are my favourites.

Once I ordered soup which was not that good.

Last visit:I was highly disappointed on the recent visit.The order was simple Mixed fried rice and thai lamb.While the rice was decent the lamb was very disappointing.It was one huge bowl of lamb.It was not cooked well and I was not happy with the quality too.It was wasted.I am done with Hatari for some time now.

The 3.5 is for all the previous visits.


P.S:Staff is ver well mannered and polite.

Hatari has always been very special to me and some of my friends as it was the place where we used to meet up while in college, give a birthday treat, or just simply have a meal together. Hatari ofcourse is famous for serving generous, rather very generous portions in case of Chinese food. I kind of like the Chinese preparations, although if you are looking for authenticity that's just not the place to be. Their Indian is somewhat good enough. Last time we went there we decided to try pork and the duck. I thought the pork was rubbery, didn't like it much, although my friend thought it was okay. The glazed duck which we had hoped would be outstanding, was a disappointment. It was too sweet for my taste and somewhat awkward tasting and i don't think i'll ever have anything other than the mainstream chinese in hatari ever again. The 3.5 rating which i've given is only for their Chinese food, their seating capacity which is good enough and for their well-mannered staff.

its not about the ambiance nor the fine dining experience...its about taste and quantity !
at the price they charge you...they provide you double that quantity...pretty accessible location and great taste...a popular joint for large school groups and families !try the Chinese...not the Indian. A serving of noodles/rice or chicken Is sufficient for 3 people !

Last time I visited this place on durga saptami. I went out with friends on that day and sice the place is near Desho Priyo park we decided to eat Biriyani here. We went early there to avoid rush but still it was jam pack. Anyway finally we got our place. 

We stated with Mongolian Chicken dry and Tandoori chicken both were great. I took then Biriyani as usual , in the time of pujas Biriyani is my choice all the time. We took chicken kasha and chicken Tawa Masala. Some of my friends took Naan with them. 

We enjoyed the food , the ambience was great although there was a huge line of people outside they were able to keep inside of hatari spacious. I liked the Biriyani here. The place is really reasonable in price and the waiters are good though they tend to serve all the food at a time like Bhojohori Manna .

The main complain I have against Hatari is the humongous amount of food they deliver in a single plate. Poor souls like me who most of the time dine alone feel filled upto the throat but still has to carry food home. Ha ha but that must be regarded as a huge positive point for couple diners or those who are looking for a group hangout.
Its very hard to choose or name any particular favorite food because most of the dishes taste yummylisious. But still the chinese menu is obviously more enriched. My favorite among the favorites is a pork and apple curry ( the name is too hard to remember). Its just out of this world.
The place is spacious enough and the ambiance is also good.
Bottomline 4 out of 5 stars from me.

As the place for foodies, Kolkata clearly has no dearth of dining options. Having read the reviews for Hatari, it only seemed fitting to drop in here for dinner after some serious shopping on Rash Behari Avenue. I was in a bit of a rush and i must say the staff did a great job with servibg the food soon with minimum fuss despite the sizeable crowd. We tried the chicken fried rice and prawns in chilly butter garlic sauce, and washed them down with cold coffee. Everything tasted great and satiated my craving for Chinese food in Kolkata. I may never be able to enjoy the fried rice in any Bangalore eatery ever again! Courteous staff, great food, and reasonable prices--Hatari is a must try if you are in South Kolkata.

I have lost count of how many times we have been there with family and friends and each time time we were satisfied with the food. The decor is good, plenty of space and the waiters are well behaved.
The food is great and comes in generous portions. Lamb and duck are well cooked.
Didn't like their oriental section to be honest, Bt love their normal section. Chilli pork and mandarin chicken are my all time favourites.
Be early in weekdays or stand in long queues.

One of my favourite restaurants right from childhood. Visited the place after a long time today and I am so happy that I did.
It maintained it's standard both in quantity and quality keeping the price reasonable.
The food is amazing both in taste, proportion and material.
The American Chop suey was very well done, and was a treat to the tongue. The thai lamb, was as brilliant as I remembered it. It's that dish that separates this place from other restaurants in the city, truly an amazing dish and I'd suggest everyone to give it a try. The mixed fried rice and Szechuan pork was pretty good as well.
The staff is cooperative and the ambience is homely and elegant making the experience absolutely worth every penny.

i had been to Kolkata N number of times but this was my very  1st visit to Hatari. i can write a whole book about the visit and experience but i ll keep it short n simple. We reached there around 10 pm and the place was  full so we waited for about 15-20 minutes . The interior is quite elegantly decorated. We ordered for mixed Hakka noodles, mixed fried rice, green chilly chicken, stir fried lamb with red chilly and green peppers and mandarin fish .All the  dishes were excellent and the portion size was more than you can ever expect. I had been to many chinese restaurants in hyderabad and all the time most of the dishes tasted similar or else they had very slight difference in taste but in Hatari all the dishes had there own identity and authenticity . I just loved the food . Not to forget the service was nice and prompt  and prices were quite reasonable.
Whenever there is a comparison between Kolkata and Hyderabad i had always been a blind supporter of Hyderabad  but this time i think Kolkata has won the trophy. Hatari definitely deserves a 5 but Lets see if Hyderabad can offer something better. :)

I live in New Delhi but when it comes to having food in Kolkatta I am obsessed with few options and when it comes to Chinese food in Kolkatta that too near my house it has to be Hatatri. My first visit to Hatari was when our family decided to have a get together and three generations were meeting altogether somewhere apart from our house lawn. So we called and checked if they can arrange a siting for 20people. 

They booked the mini hall kind of area which other days is included in their dining hall a cozy place for small families or couples to sit in. And our giant feast started. We ordered for soups - chicken clear soup, sweet n sour corn soup and they were fine. The way the soups should be. In starters we ordered for chicken Dumplings, Veg dumplings, Chilly potato, Chicken Lollipop and the lollipop was lip smacking. In main course- we ordered the standard Chilly chicken, Prawns in garlic sauce, Fried rice, hakka noodels and the food was superb. We ate double of what we could have managed and we were so happy with the food. And all the service and attention they gave to us.

My family anytime would love to visit this place and I myself have been coming to this place in my every visit to kolkatta just to have their chinese. With friends, with family, with better half. This place is meant for one and all. With a promising Foodie Experience.

The old saying "good things do come to those who wait" may in fact be true. Hatari proves that every time when i reach its door step and get disappointed by seeing the long queue. Love Chinese food? Hatari is your paradise then. Situated near triangular park where its hard to find a proper eatery when famished. the food leaves a satisfied you. The first time we had Prawn fried rice, Thai fish, Chicken with Red wine and Thai Chicken with Cashew nut. Ever since then i have been a huge fan of their Chinese menu. 
A very good place to give treating your friends given the huge quantity they serve. the staff is good and helpful. 
The food is pricy, but the quality and quantity will suffice.

Have been frequenting this restaurant right from childhood. Food quality is good if compared to the rates it charge. Chinese cuisine  are the best to order. Although they serve Mughlai and other India dishes. Good ambience although a bit noisy, as tables are placed close to each other. Family restaurant and the crowd is good. Serving is pretty fast, so if you are very hungry and you cannot wait much Hatari is the place to be. Locates itself to be the best place to dinner, after and movie in evening show at Priya cinema.

I am just excited because Hatari is well Hatari one of "THE " restaurant you have to go to in Kolkata, if you know what I mean. So finally, regrettably after a lot of days , I am initiated in to the Been-To-Hatari-Club. Yeah.I felt proud.  
So after a wait of good 20 mins , me and two of my friends found a place to sit. We were ravenous so we ordered quickly :
1.  Fresh Lime Soda.
2. Crab Hot and Sour Soup
3. Mushroom Crispy Chilli
4. Veg Hakka Noodles
5. Schezuan Lamb. 
Yes, quite a lot considering us three girls. So after a 10-15 min wait the starters came.
1. SOUP - Tasty, tangy good amount of crab in there. 
2. Mushroom Crispy Chilli - This was the star of the entire meal. We could not stop gorging on this ! This one was delicious ! 
3. Main Course - The Lamb I found a tad bit well mellow for a Schezuan preparation and the noodles were like they are supposed to be. The Lamb was cooked good though. All over not a bad combination :) 
4. Fresh Lime Soda - Nice balance, nothing extraordinary though. 
The bill was 1,172 ( with taxes) - Good news for the wallets. 
The three skinny girls finished them all. 8) All though the portions were HUGE. ( thank god we had a light breakfast)
Over all , good place, nice ambiance and good service, but food is worth returning for. :) 

Over all, it was a good experience,

I have been to the main entrance of the restaurant thrice, but only once have I gone beyond it& had a meal there. 

The reason behind it shouldn't raise any eyebrows- the omnipresent 'Hatari- special super- long' queue didn't fail to piss me off on the first two occasions. On the third occasion though, I came out of Hatari, feeling supremely content  with the world around me. 
If you can withstand the ordeal of waiting for close to an hour during the prime time, there's hardly anything you wouldn't like about this eatery. It has stood the test of time& has served many a generation of Kolkata with distinction and earnesty. Yes, smarter, slicker& finer restaurants have come up in several pockets of the city, but there's an unmistakable charm about this particular joint that makes you go for it, even on your most inauspicious days. 
The quantities are insane, the prices are ridiculously easy on the pocket& the quality is heavenly. Go for anything in Chinese tint- chicken, lamb, pork or duck, Hatari lives up to it's own high standards with consummate ease. There was nothing that was bland or boring, as everything tasted exquisitely delicious, while the staff on duty was extremely cordial, much in contrast to the usual snooty people you get to see at fine- dining restaurants. The not- so- slick interiors lends it an old- world charm& you duly understand why the classes& the masses throng the restaurant...every single day of the year. 

If you pine for the heady concoction of a lazy evening, good company& great food at affordable rates, look no further than Hatari..
But then, you still have to withstand the ordeal of waiting in a super- long queue for close to an hour.. :)

Well, Hatari is simply there for family dining. Food is a bit overpriced but sometimes, especially if you try out the sea food it is totally worth. The amount of food they serve in a platter is often more than enough for the greatest of foodies. Choose your meal wisely and Hatari is a win win.

The word Hatari in swahili means "Danger" :D

Location - Hatari is located at Rashbehari Avenue, nearby Triangular Park. 

Ambience - The restaurant is on the first floor. The passage way is pretty narrow as people are asked to wait there. The ambience inside is nice with smooth decorations. Its a large restaurant in terms of seating. The Doormen are nice and greet you nicely. 

Brief - Its one of the best chinese restaurants in south Kolkata. My collegemates have a fascination giving their birthday treats mostly in Hatari, maybe because of its location which is very near my Dept Of Law,CU(Hazra). Today we reached there at about 2pm and were made to wait for atleast 20 minutes as they were full and could not accomodate 10 people together in one table. So we had to wait in this heat in the narrow passageway which was very difficult and uncomfortable to be precise :(

Things to try - I have been frequent there and have tried various chinese dishes. Today we ordered Mixed Fried rices(without pork), Mixed  Hakka Noodles(without pork), Chilly Chicken,Chicken Manchurian, Shanghai Chicken,Schezwan Chicken. At last we had some cold drinks to quench our thirsts :D

The Mixed fried rices and mixed hakka noodles are awesome with large quantity. They contained good amount of chicken,egg and prawn. The chilly chicken was as usual tasty and chicken pieces were succulent. The schezwan was spicy and brought tears to some eyes :D But my favourite was the Shanghai chicken it was awesome shredded chicken and the gravy was a mix of sweet and sour(perfect balance).
The cold drinks added glamour to the treat :)

Purse Check - Frankly, it was a friend's treat so could not exactly ask her about the bill. But I presume it must have been around Rs. 2,500/-(approx.)  for 10 people which I would say is very good. :)

Highly Recommended :) Go there and grab your chinese lunch and dinner now :D

P.S. would have given 5 pointer, but not because of the waiting problem :P



----- 01 Feb, 2014 -----

Went to Hatari after years ...We were just overwhelmed wirh this place.
Fantastic service, awesome food. We ordered for duck and ginger chicken for main course along with fried rice and cantonese noodles.
Duck was simply delicious, so was ginger chicken
Quantity per portion is one more point to note .... ...we were 3 of us and we had to pack a good amont of rice ...part of the duck dish and even little bit of noodles ....
Service was also fantastic ...special note ...service with a smile! !

Updated Review:
Went again on Christmas...
Ordered:
Chicken & Prawn Gravy Noodles - Awesome 
Chicken & Prawn Fried Rice - Super
Manchurian Chicken (Gravy) - Super
Need to mention that even on Christmas they lived up to the quality and even quantity - quantity is Hatari s big plus usually...
Service : very courteous and smiling staff...
4.5/5

One of the famous foodie destinations in the city. Menus are full with the names from Chinese, Continental and North-Indian cuisines.
 Really good Chinese starters are served here but I found sauces are used in "Dry-chilli chicken", "Pan-fried-chilli-fish" and "Tangy crispy chicken" are almost same. They try to present Chinese form of "Chicken" and "Fish" with same crispiness in almost all dishes. 
In main-course I found some quality rice-dishes. One Indonesian mixed fried rice is there in the menu, I forget the real name of that dish, that dish was really palatable.

ambiance : 2/5 (Decoration should be changed, they are not utilizing the space)
service : 3/5 (Good)

Hatari served up some of the best Chinese food in South Calcutta at one point of time ..... and though I still like the food I have to admit that the quality is not quite what it used to be. Than being said however its still extremely popular .... both with the locals who stay around the area as well as those who come to shop. Portions are generous and food is quite nice. Of late though when I want to eat Hatari-style Indianised Chinese I prefer a takeaway because during peak dining hours you have to wait and the footfall inside is quite heavy so it is not a place to sit and chill out and catch up with friends. Coming to the food my personal picks are as follows - Start your meal with Dry Chili Pork or Crispy Golden Prawn both of which are delicious. If your in the mood for a soup I like the Chicken Hot and Sour and follow that up with Mixed Hakka Noodles and American Chopsuey paired up with Chili Chicken and either the Chili Garlic Prawn or Hot Garlic Prawn ... the spiciness and sauces of the chicken and prawn are a perfect foil to the sweetness of the American Chopsuey and tickles my taste-buds in just the right way. They also serve up a pretty extensive Indian menu that I have never tried so will not comment on in all fairness.

How now should I express my love for this amazing joint !
It saved me from getting famished last evening after a movie at Priya.
I was frantically zomatoing around to search for a place to eat and this is what I found. With my senses and the reviews right, I headed to Hatari with J, S and A.
Ambience : Nice and cosy. Though the stairs are shabby and you might not feel right (something that happened with me) but take the risk and enter. Once you're inside, you'll be just fine :)
We were seated cosily. Seats are nice and do not sink. I have a thing for seats that are comfortable yet steady.

With hunger in our tummies, we ordered  the following :

Pepper fish
Singaporean Noodles
Fried rice
Sweet n sour chicken

The fish was crunchy and tasty and very fresh. An extremely good starter option as per my take.
It was light and a perfect start to a hearty meal.

Quantity here is a BIG factor. The quantity given in one plate can easily feed two hungry souls.
The noodles were quite nice. The rice on the other hand was not something extra ordinary.

The chicken was nice and sweet and the pieces were tender. But somehow, because it was sweet it failed to leave an impact on the palate.
However, the food is good and in huge quantity. Not very steep on the pockets either.

Coming back for more.
Cheers! :)

Very good ambiance. Situated in prime location - between Gariahat and Rasbihari. Testes awesome. Ideal for family and friends. Services are good. Phone order and take away service are also available. Food quantity are also good. If you are not 'that' hungry, one main course and once side dish could be sufficient for a couple. Pork Fried rice and Chicken with baby corn are my favorite dish here till now.

first ever place where i to my great embarrassment could not complete  eating (the chop suey gravy was too sweet) 
that being said ... the prices are a little high for college students if you're looking for a place to visit often ..BUt one thing is certain the variety and quality will surely make up for that dis utility
only sad part is Its always crowded .... and i made the grave mistake  of taking my friends there for lunch on a puja day without reservation lol..we had a hard time finding another decent restaurant

If I really swear by any restaurant in Kolkata, and recommend it every time; Hatari will surely top the list. The palce, the food and the contentment is unsurpassable.

The food:
Mongolian Prawn, an utterly delicious preparation, which is a definite order every time.
Thai Lamb: Though I am not fond of lamb, I relish every bit of this.
Hong Kong Chicken: This shredded chicken preparation is one more attraction.
Chicken in Red wine: An amazing concoction of ideas.

Apart from that the regular Chinese and Indian dishes taste pretty decent. So in all the food is a star here. And anything you order, will satiate your taste bud for sure. 

The service here is not that amazing, and the serving time is considerable. However, tits worth the wait though. To sum it up,  Hatari is foodie's delight and anyone landing in Kolkata, should make a point to eat here.

Recommended always.

The one thing you will notice right away about Hattari is that there is always a long queue leading to the door. It is one of the best places to eat out with family and friends at any point of time. The food is good most of the time, services, pretty fast and the waiters, quite helpful and pleasant. 

When I went recently with my husband, we ordered the Crispy Fish, Chili Chicken dry and Cantonese Noodle. The fish was succulent and melted in the mouth. The Chicken tasted heavenly and the noodles was yummy. The portions served are generous and enough to fill the tummy and soul. It is great place to eat out, and we are certainly heading back sometime soon.

Hatari is highly recommendable for Chinese cuisine lovers..

A place where I had been going since the past 7 years. Price may seem a bit high but the food that they provide you with is very filling. Just loved their Tibetian Soup, very filling and yummy. They might want to work a bit on their desserts, especially Tutti Fruity, it's quality has gone down a bit. Overall nice ambiance, no wonder there is always a queue. I place where I would like go and munch up to fill in my tummies again and again.

Definitely one of the most popular joints in South Calcutta, the snaking line on a Monday afternoon proving it, Hatari scores high on two counts:

1. The food is definitely palatable considering you know what you are ordering.
2. The portions are definitely more than enough and it doesn't really pinch your pocket that much.

My personal favorite has to the Prawn Fried Rice and the Cantonese Roast Pork. The combination is heavenly and equally filling.

Like many other similar joints, the taste is not maintained across all dishes. So, I would suggest one to be careful when ordering so as not to be disappointed. Overall, a good place to have your weekday lunch.

Another one of those quaint little popular Chinese restaurants in town. This is a pretty amazing place. I like the way one has to approach the restaurant and that flight of stairs. There is something about it that is exciting. The seating arrangement is quite comfortable and conversing might get difficult at times as the place is always hustling and bustling with activity. Even on weeknights. The service is decent, efficient and quick. The food is very good. And so is the value one gets for the money spent. If you don't like the ambiance take your food home. They are pretty quick with that too. I love their pork ribs . So succulent and it has the right ratio of fat and meat, which is rather tender. You have to use your hands and lick your fingers clean if your really want to enjoy these little babies. The chilli pork and chilli crab (not always available) are pretty nice too. Do try the duck dishes. I like almost all of them but my favourites are the brown glazed duck and the one cooked in pineapple sauce (and those bits of sweet tinned pineapple). another favourite of mine is the Szechuan Pork. Spicy and hot and delicious. Somehow I am not too fond of neither the noodles nor the fried rice. But one can make do with the sauce of the main course. Good place and good value for money. Must try.

Returened to Hatari today again after a long time. We were a group of five and had to wait for a while. The wait was worth it because the food as usual was simply delectable. We ordered the salt and pepper squid and mongolian chicken. The flavours of the chicken were wonderful, sweet and spicy with cashew nuts. The squid was a bit too chewy but it tasted very well. The main course took too much of time to arrive but once again everything tasted so good we could not complain. The chilli pork dry and chicken in oyster sauce were amazing. The lemon chicken was perhaps a bit bland, neither sweet nor tangy. Overall a good experience once again with good company and conversation. Hope to return soon.

Hatari is the best value for money restaurant where you can take a gathering and also expect a sophisticated crowd. Food here is amazing with a plethora of dishes spread all over the menu card. My personal favorite is the Chinese cuisine with its so many yay varieties. The quantity of food is huge and it is often to much to easy for two people. The pricing is also very moderate, a rarity in these inflated times! I totally recommend Hatari of you are looking for a moderate ambience and great food.

If you visit this place you should book a table because if you don't you would have to stand in the line for  some time...It's always crowded. The restaurant is pretty clean and spacious.The ambience is good and service is quick for a restaurant so crowded.We had ordered Drums of Heaven but was told it wasn't available so we went for Crispy Chicken..It was very delicious.Their pricing is on the higher side but the quantity is more than enough..Then we ordered Hakka Chicken Chow and Mixed Fried Rice with  Chicken in Oyster Sauce. The Chow was good but a little oily.The Fried Rice was very nice but the real eye catcher was that splendid  Chicken in Oyster Sauce..
As I said earlier quantites are more than enough...This is a must try

Amazing food, courteous service but too much crowded place! This is how Hatari can be explained the best! We went there on a weekday and still we had to wait for half an hour to get a table for three! But once we got the food, we actually forgot irritation of waiting for so long. For the starters we had Mongolian Chicken and Crispy Golden Prawn. Both were too good. We moved on the the main course and order Chicken hakka chow, sweet and sour chilli chicken and hot garlic fish. All of them yumm enough to make us drool over them! This is a nice place for eating out with family and friends but be ready to wait a bit to get a seat! The food, the ambience and everything related to Hatari is so nice that no wonder why this place is crowded all the time! 
A must visit for all the Chinese cuisine lovers!

One of the most popular restaurants of South Kolkata, Hatari has been serving all kinds of foodies with perhaps one definite motto- treat the taste-buds in the lowest price possible!!!!!! We were celebrating our Aunt's 65th birthday there. The whole family of 23 people was there. So one can really guess how much food and how many dishes we have actually ordered for. But the bill was extremely minimal. We were amazed by the bill.......

As the price compared to other resturants is not so high but the Food quality is too very good. It is one of the best restuarants at south kolkata. 

I just loved it !!!!

Nice  and  cosy  ambiance ,  though  it  can  take  some  time  to  get  seats ,  especially  on  occasions  like  Christmas  and  the  Pujas.. Their  Chinese  is  just  awesome ,  like  the  fried  rice  ,  gravy  chowmein ,  hakka  noodles and   chicken  dishes .  A  special mention would  be  the  Thai   Chicken ,  shredded  and  spicy   it  is  a  dish  that  would  bring  water  to the  mouth  of  many   food  lovers ! The  quantity  is  good  ,  a  plate of  noodles  or  rice  is  enough  for   two  people  . The  service  is  good  and  the  waiters always  offer  valuable  suggestions. Had some  nice meals  there  and  looking  forward  to  many  more !

Hatari to me is nostalgia. We would stop there for hot and sour soup and some chowmein while on the way back from school. As high school students with little money to spend, it was also our fixed restaurant to eat during our Durga Puja outing on Saptami. 
Hatari serves up highly Indianized Chinese and takes you back to simpler times when greasy noodles and soy drenched chilli chicken was enough to satisfy your taste buds.

The restaurant is synonymous with good quality and ambience. The variations in their menu is pleasant. Do explore the recent additions in the Oriental section. If you are looking for a good dine-out experience then this is the place you can count on, even during the pujas, for their quality does not waver during times of high demand, unlike many illustrious restaurants of South Kolkata.

There's nothing new to be added about this wonder of a restaurant. It is certainly one of the most popular choices for dining out in South Kolkata. The food is pretty good in flavors and quantity. The best thing about the place, in my opinion, is the service. The staff surely knows how to earn customer satisfaction. They also give special attention in case of birthday celebrations which is a great thing in its own small way. It's not too heavy on the pockets and that makes it a good choice if you are not a big spender but have an above average appetite. So, to sum it all up, Hatari is a must go.

Used to be good, but has deteriorated in recent years. I will cite three incidents.
Incident one - we order a soup, first it is cold, and the next time we find a fly in it.
Incident two - the food was so bad we could not eat it, and then when they asked if we would like it to be packed, we were more than happy to just pay and leave and not take the food with us.
Incident three - We had gone there to have lunch, and all of us had stomach upset.

As I have rated Hatari a big 5, it does not mean that it is the best restaurant in the city. But it portrays the fact that this is the only restaurant known to me in my City of Joy which maintained it consistency for nearly 10 years. Which is amazing. Now come to the point of Food & others.

Date of visit ‚Äì Too many times in 10 years & last in September 2013.
Decor: 3.5
Seating Capacity: 4
Service Time: 4
Food: 5

Items ordered & how they taste :- 
1)	Chinese Mixed Salad ‚Äì It was awesome in taste.
2)	Crispy Golden Prawn ‚Äì The Prawns were finely fried & the crispiness along with taste was excellent.
3)	Tomato Egg Drop Soup ‚Äì The soup was Good. But the egg was slightly over cooked in respective of EGG DROP soup. 
4)	Pork Fried Rice ‚Äì The rice was really fantastic. It was fresh with a great aroma & the porks were very much succulent.
5)	Thai Chicken -  It is my favourite dish. As before it was really tangy, rich flavoured & very much spicy.  ( who does not like too much spicy taste, don‚Äôt go for it).
6)	Fish with Baby corn ‚Äì I had tried the dish before, but somehow it attracted me every time. This time also, the dish was equally good & the fish pieces were well cooked & fresh. This is a neutrally rather less spicy dish.
7)	Tuti Fruti ‚Äì Desert was also excellent. But somehow I found the price of the desert a little higher. 

Overall I may like to add that all the service persons of this Restaurant are well informed about their delicacies & the quantity of the dishes is huge. Everybody should give Hatari a chance.

A very good eatery if you are unsure of which cuisine to choose - Indian or Chinese (the two most popular among most Indians). Their quantity per plate is huge and the taste is also quite good. Just a small fact to corroborate its goodness - it has a seating capacity of almost 50, still you need to be really lucky not to find any queue for dining in

This is one of those restaurants you keep coming back to. They're extremely pocket friendly, especially for the portions they serve. We ordered Crispy Chicken, one plate of Mixed Chowmein, two plates of Mixed Fried Rice, one Garlic Chicken and one Sweet and Sour Chicken. And there were five of us. College people. We couldn't finish it. I think that more or less sums up the part about them serving huge portions. The food tasted well enough. The ambiance was nice. The staff were efficient. But if you wanna go there during pujo, the best thing to do would be to get your name on the list an hour in advance and then spend the next hour visiting the nearby pandals, and that if you're early. Otherwise be prepared to wait for anything from one to two hours outside, because this nondescript on Rashbehari Avenue is a huge crowd-puller The waiters might rush you a bit, but they can't help it, with a waiting list outside climbing to the late nineties. So, overall a good restaurant, that serves awesome portions, is pocket-friend;y with the food being quite good.

Just one word would suffice: great!

Had lunch at Hatari today with family.

Management, ambiance, light music was just awesome.

Ordered crispy chicken for starters. It was great. And boneless chilly chicken with mixed American Chowpsey. It was great. The quantity, and quality was awesome. 

Hatari is beyond recommendations. I've been here 3 times before and the environment is still the same! The same amount of crowd, the same quality, the same behavior of management. Excellent!!!

Please keep it up.

Hatari is one of the best restaurants of South Kolkata. Don't underestimate it from its outer appearance. The quality of food is excellent and the quantity is more than sufficient. You should  definitely try their lamb preparations. Tasty food and good service is a rare combo, which makes it a must-go.

Perfect place to hang out with friends and family. Hatari will never disappoint you.

It is one of those Kolkata restaurants which have been resting too much on its laurels and failed to keep up with the times. It is one thing to be one of the top restaurants in Kolkata in the 1970s but it is quite another to retain the position four decades later, with the younger generation far more well traveled and worldly wise. The only saving graces are the low prices and large portions, otherwise there is nothing to write home about the food. Also some of the more exotic items like duck are frequently unavailable. In summary, this place is OK for some casual dining. But I don't see any reason why someone should come from far to eat out at this place.

had been going there since childhood...
a very good chinese restaurant to suit indian taste...

their thai soup is amazing...
among the starters, drums of heaven is my personal favourite...also the prawns and crispi chicken r also good...
in the main course, go for any regular chinese favourites,  but definitely try their lamb preparations..specially the pepper chilli lamb...its awesome...
however the duck items r not up to the mark....
dont know about their indian or mughlai dishes...generally people dont go for these in a chinese restaurant...
the desserts are so-so...nothing special...

overall a very good chinese eatery at a reasonable price...a must-go i would say

spent a lovely evening at hatari...today with two of my cousin sisters.
as usuall,we opted for chinese..and ordered
crispy chicken for starters
thai chicken with
chicken prawn fried rice for the main course.
and 3 sweet lime sodas.
the crispy chicken was crisp-est i had ever.moreover it was not at all oily as served elsewhere.
one portion of fried rice was apt for 3 of us, it had ample amount of chicken and prawn, n thai chicken with huge quantity of shredded chicken was one of hottest item i had this year.it will definitely set your taste buds on fire.but it was not a gravy dish that we usually order with fried rice,instead this dry version can be a better starter.
nevertheless we thoroughly enjoyed the hottness of the meal on such hot day...i iove hatari for its cozyness and quantity...doubtlessly the hugest serving size in town. you will never find this place empty,it almost always remains full.donot dare to plan a visit in any occasions like durga puja..the que here is unimaginable.
 hatari is beyond recommendations.. i am just waiting for the next time to step in :)

The food they serve is very good but the options of veg dishes is very limited. also they have not moved on to the changing trends of veggies like brocolli and other. 

the Veg Manchurian and the Chowmien was very very good though i wish i could have called for more things to eat.

I have had a Biriyani couple of years back and after that have had tried to get in but the long lines had turned me away. Mid of the week  while shopping, I was around Hatari and seeing no line, went in. I ordered Veg chowmien gravy and Manchurian chicken. The chowmien was tasteless and tasted more like the roadside eateries. It just had few shreds of vegetables with no mushrooms, etc. The chicken tasted below par and came with a thick coating. Price and quantity wise, this restaurant compares to BarbeQ in Park street but food quality is much much below par.
I think its best to pass along, never mind the long lines, atleast if you are trying chinese food there. The indian menu meanwhile is above average.

The first thing to say about this place would be not to judge this place by its outer appearance. This place from outside looks a pretty not so fancy kinda place but as you step in Wolla, you have a great looking restaurant in front of you!!But the worst part you have to wait in a long queue outside the place for a table even though the place being quite big..
About the ambiance & staff out there, they are damn good at their jobs, with a very friendly attitude but the ambiance was not so great at all.. 
Now the main part, the food:-
Well what i can say is the quantity of the serve is damn good as compared to the price but the taste matters too. And in the taste challenge it doesn't really stand up to be great or amazing but simply saying the food is just a bit better than average.
Pan Fried Chilli Prawns are a good way to start your meal
The rice was good enough to write about but somehow it didnt really stand out all alone
Mafu Tofu is what i would recommend for pork eaters, simple but great
and
for chicken eaters any chicken dish would do they all are quite good, but highlights would be for Steamed chicken in oyster sauce and thai red curry
but worry not nothing is really spicy instead they end up being sweet at times
anyways allover review of the place would be a good place for hangouts with friends

Hatari is one of the places where we started having friends get together from school time. The place offers a huge range of exotic chinese and cantonese food along with north indian. But the factors that make this place one of the 'most wanted' among Kolkatans is its huge quantity of food, excellent taste, and pocket friendly price. Some of the must tries of this place is lung fung soup, threaded chicken, crispy chilli baby corn, and in main course any rice item is very nice, mongolian chicken tastes good, even duck and pork dishes are good enough. The spread of food is vast and any random pick would serve good i can bet. The ambiance is pretty clean and appropriate for family gathering. They even give this place for small parties. Having Priya Cinema Hall nearby, it is a very common place to eat before or after a show. The place for waiting is actually a very narrow corridor and in special days the queue even goes down the stairs on the pavement downstairs..but the wait is worth it for the fine dining experience inside. In a whole its one one the great food places of the city...not by size but by taste for sure!!

One of the most popular restaurants of South Kolkata, Hatari has been serving all kinds of foodies with perhaps one definite motto- treat the taste-buds in the lowest price possible! During the graduation, we used to go there for all sorts of occasion - a birthday, a good result or even a farewell to a friend- and never really this restaurant failed to earn our respect. This trend continued in Masters also and by that time we had tasted and assimilated almost every item on its menu! I have not been there for a long time though I recently came top know that they have added some fresh varieties to their sleeves! Till I do not get the chance to savor those newcomers, I shall have to limit this review to the old menu.

But that is not going to do any less, is it? Hatari means 'consistency' to all of those who have dined there religiously :) And if you ask me to pick three platters from the list, I will name the Crispy Honey Chilly Lamb, Sliced Pork with Black Bean and Thai Pork. They have started a collection of seafoods and I truly hope that will do great as well. And whatever cuisine it may be, be sure not to order more than 2 plates for 4 people, or you might get to overload yourself with the huge amount of leftovers!

A sudden whim took me to Hatari after 3 years few hours back. Standing in a queue for 15 mins made me realize this place of old was still standing proud in the new concrete jungle of Kolkata restaurants. Our order was received politely and served in 4 minutes flat. This included the special rice and red wine fish. Amazing taste as usual. However the star of the show was the pork chops. It arrived after 15 mins and was just amazing. Having tasted the same dish in 3 continents I could easily say this was the best I had ever tasted. The perfect combination of the fat and meat was amazing. I asked for the chef and when he arrived at the table I complimented him for the dish. He replied with a humble smile and my offer to shake his hands was met with a huge pride. I would recommend this person in any class of fine dining. If you have a inclination for pork chops come here. Hats off to Hatari. Keep up the great dining. (The brownie with ice cream is worth a dig into).

Hatari is one of the old Chinese Food joint of South Kolkata. Location is just opposite of triangular park of Rashbehari, and serve food at low cost. You will not be able to complain for a 'close-to-street-chinese' as you are not shelling a out a lot ! I found them open at 10-45 PM when I was heading out to AHD Kasba but had no intent to try Indian once more (Doesn't at all mean I hate them, in fact I am a very frequent visitor of AHD). The timing is good for late eaters !

Pros: 
1. Timings
2. New items introduced in the menu
3. Quality interior

Cons:
1. Medium quality food - In fact the spicy dragon noddles was so spicy that we had to throw the full plate !
2. Even the waiter did not know that it was going to be so spicy ! Poor service
3. 1st floor, hence a long stair-way

Old and highly appreciated at a time. Chicken lollypop still tastes best in town and just heavenly for your tongue, specially with the red hot chilli papaya (?) chutney. Once upon a time duck tasted very good here and general meifoon or fried rice and green chicken curry and similar Chinese and few thai items were pretty good too. They have detoriorated with time (and expanded also with deterioration), but as I said, still serves good food, and when amount matters, they are humazing. An affair still to remember.

This restaurant is one of the few places which serves very good Chinese food. My all time favourite dishes are - mixed fried rice, chicken with red wine .Very delicious, people who especially like spicy food will love it ! One must come here surely on v-day, this year, they offered gifts along with a coke bottle 500 ml . candle-lit dinner was also arranged. every year they do something new on that day. Also, the staff is very polite. Looking forward to come here during the pujas.  The atmosphere inside is also quite good.

Pros
SERVICE-4.5/5
CHINESE FOOD-4/5
INDIAN FOOD-3/5

Cons
Home delivery system is confusing and not good

They call it a multicuisine restaurant so they should improve the quality of their Indian food

Ambiance can be improved.

Overall a nice place to visit 
cost for 3- rs 1000 inclusive of taxes

Must try-Chicken in oyster sauce :-)

Hatari - located just of Priya cinema. I think before Malls and fancy MNC outlets came up - this is how places in Kolkata looked like.  Some decor, food being served in nice catering quality white plates and big bowls.  

Hatari is a nice place to gather for a group meal - portions are large so 2 people does not cut it.  Food is good, given we were a group - we ordered tons of things and in typical indian style mixture of tandoor and chinese dishes. 

We were a hungry lot and the order was big so it did take a little time for food to arrive. However, we were satisfied lot soon after good arrived.

Real tip would be go there for a group meal and order tons of things given everything they serve is quite good for taste-buds :)

Remember that story, where a little girl crossed all the patchy road, dense forest, scary caves to discover a wonderland? The entrance to Hatari quite reminds you of that venture, only you don't find the wonderland at the end! :P

Situated on one of the busiest roads in the city, this place has a weirdly long entrance.. Quite a few stairs, then a turn, a balcony, another turn, a few steps, your restaurant.. Upon entrance, this place gives you a mediocre feeling.. Close to a fine diner, but not quite so! Anyways, the place is pretty big.. Yet, you could be told to join the queue outside, as this place is full most of the times..  

Thankfully when I arrived, they had a few empty tables.. We were ushered to one.. The place has got no real decor to boast of, simply arranged, and well enough! Their menu is widespread, from Chicken to pork to lamb to Biryani, they serve everything.. Do go for the Chinese dishes though, the safest bet here..

We'd ordered the Green Chili Chicken, while the waiter served us Red.. Anyways, when told, he instantly changed it.. Very professional, I must say! 

As soon as you see the quantity of the food, you think "Whoa! I should've brought my roomies n shared the bill!" :P Yeah, it's that huge.. One bowl of Fried Rice is more than enough for two.. Same goes for the side dishes too..

The food tastes above average at best.. The rice was okay, though I think mixing the pork was a good idea.. It slightly enhanced the flavor of the dish.. The Green Chili Chicken was very very ordinary.. Meant to be a spicy dish on the hotter side, it was rather sweet! I don't know if they had a bad day or what, but nobody likes Green Chili Chicken sweet! I mean, it kills the whole purpose of the dish! Maybe next time I'll walk a 'less experimental' road and order a Red or Garlic Chicken..

An average affair, this place earns all its points from the quantity of the food and their service.. A perfect diner to give your gang a treat, will save you bucks! But if the quality of food tops your priority list, maybe you could find better!

For a long time Hatari was undoubtedly the best restaurant in and around the rashbehari-gariahat area.But as more and more new restaurants have come up in the area the status of hatari has declined a little and for me so has the quality.I have been to this place a number of times.Previously it was one of my favourite places but I feel presently the quality has declined a little and there are other better options around.
The quality of the food they serve is still good.The quantity of their food is enormous to say the least.Hatari beats most other places when it comes to quantity of food.The variety of food they offer is also really good.I prefer their Chinese items more.But again the quality of the duck and crab items have declined.I used to love the duck items but I had visited the place for duck a couple of months back and was a bit disappointed.
The service is good and fast.The prices are very affordable.Overall,still the place serves good food and is quite popular.

This is one place which has not changed over years and serving brilliant Indian version of Chinese :) But we all love it for what they are. I have never been extremely experimental about their food. Starting from Dry Chili Chicken to a Chicken Manchurian to Prawn in Garlic Sauce, nothing has ever disappointed me. Perhaps they are very true to their signature style. They never try to be too Oriental or very authentic but whatever they produce is just divine. A simple Chicken Sweet Corn soup or their special burnt chicken garlic butter rice - nothing will make you feel bad about your choice of dinner/lunch place. Since this place is always in high demand, I wish they make some effort to arrange a better place for customers to wait than that narrow balcony and stairs. Staffs are quick and pretty nice. Never had a problem with them. Oh how can I forget to mention their style of making Thai Chicken - my favourite. It can blew your head off if you are not used to spicy food but worth a try ! Hatari - please stay the way you are as standards of most of our old hubs of food are gradually declining !

All I have to say is that, if someone is looking for a decent restaurant in southern section of Calcutta, then HATARI is the place. Named after the famous Hollywood film & located at well-connected place like Triangular Park, Behala & Tollugunj, this place not only provides you with the perfect ambiance but also with mouth-watering dishes to suit everyone's palate. The stewards always bear a smile on their faces -- be it while taking the orders or serving them to your plates. The best thing about them is that, most of them are generally too polite and never show any sign of upset or soreness upon their countenance. 

This restaurant is highly recommended for everyone.

Hatari is one of those few restaurants that serve good food but don't cost you a bomb. The location is convenient, but I am not thrilled about the dingy corridor you have to pass through before entering. The restaurant itself has a nice, cheerful ambiance and I have never once been to Hatari when it wasn't bustling with people chatting noisily over food. That is actually a plus for me because I don't like to eat at places people talk in hushed tones.

As for the menu, I am indebted to Hatari for my first taste of pork and lamb way back when I was a kid and this scored me bragging points with my friends. I always order chicken satay for starter, and I think anyone who hasn't had it once is missing something. The fried rice, be it mixed or chicken, is absolutely delicious. My suggestion is that don't skip on the pork in mixed fired rice, and I say this because I have seen many do this, because the shreds of the meat adds a depth to the flavour. I don't usually like noodles, but I can easily polish off half a plate of pork rice noodles. The chicken sides are all really good, manchurian, sweet and sour garlic, Schezuan, Red Chilli Chicken are all my favourites. 

All of them have that typical Oriental balance of sweet, sour and salt. Pork in Oyster Sauce is my favourite of the porcine spread. The fat in the pork is trimmed and rendered well, so it doesn't leave a fatty taste in your mouth. The Thai Lamb is worth a try although it makes me drink glass after glass of water. It has a kind of heat that doesn't affect your tongue but hits your sinus, very different from the usual chilli heat. The Schezuan lamb is just as scrumptious. However, I didn't like the Korean lamb. It was too sweet and had too much of star anise and other aromats, and the taste of fennel seeds was overpowering. The portions are really big- the carbs are good enough for two big eaters while the sides can easily be shared by three or four even.

Among the Indian dishes, I have had only the most unimaginative fare- Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Reshmi Masala. They were just okay, I suppose, so given the price I would rather have it at the strictly Mughlai and North Indian restaurants. The amount wasn't as enormous as the Chinese dishes either.

The waiters are friendly and give good suggestions. When asked for how many dishes would be enough for a certain number of people, they give honest inputs and even politely warn you about ordering excess. They do take a while when you place a large order or something more exotic like lamb, though. So, for me, service is a 4.5/5.

Simply THE place for foodies. this multi-cuisine food joint offers sumptuous delicacies and a good ambiance . pocket pinch for two would be around 600+taxes. i would recommend you try out the pan fried garlic fish for starter. the lamb preparations are also great.

well if yu want to eat a lotta quantity no matter, whats the taste n how oily it might be..
you are absolutely at the rite place ...you get a starter konjy crispy chicken.. eachtime we took a piece we.. remarked wow.. we like fried maida..with a hint of chicken,the fish chili n pepper is still okhay.. again a great disappointment is konjy crispy lamb.. about the drunken prawn nothing much to say.... just dont forget to get drunk before you enter the place to avoid question marks ;-)... btw the whooping quantity of noodles n rice is okay.. now main course the chili or schezwan is poorly average wid a bowl of watery gravy along...this plave enjoys monopoly n thats the reason its able to draw crowd..as it has no stiff competition around  i bet if yu are a foodie its truelry hard for you to re-visit this place...

certainly would come in the try its of the chinese restaurants in kol. cheap and good food is what you will find here. the starters are just too good and yes you can order about any starter and certainly won't be disappointed. the noodles and rice need improving. the new oriental additions are also pretty good especially the gansu lamb. my recommendations try the chicken in oyster sauce.

I don't know how many times I have visited this restaurant but all the times I had to wait in a queue to seek for my chance...Such is the crowd pull and thus it makes one the best Chinese restaurant in the area...The ambiance is quite good and their service is also prompt...The courteous waiters are always there for any kind of assistance which makes the dining experience so beautiful....
Now the food....I prefer Chinese cuisine to Indian or Mughlai in this restaurant...Thai fish you order for starters and you would have a mind boggling sensation when you would have that...The portions of the Chinese items are really good...Both chowmein and rice are served in good quantity...Lamb is a must try at this place...

Location: Went to this place called Hatari - famous for its varieties of meats- chicken, lamb, duck, pork, lobsters , crab etc. they serve Chinese and Indian cuisines. It is located near fortis hospital, rashbehari. This was my second visit with my family and we ordered burnt ginger rice, Singaporean noodles and manchurian. First time, had ordered Hakka noodles wd duck in oyester sauce. 

As you enter you will feel like 'kya kachra as entrance hai' once you enter. You will be amazed. That's the speciality of this place - it surprises people. I don't wanna tell you about it right now as I want you to experience it yourself . The a la carte has a wide range of things to offer. 
Pros n cons
Pros:-
1) food is extremely good and quality. 
2) staffs are very polite. 
3) quick service. 
4) place which is busy on every time of a day. 
5) wide varieties of meats.
6) ambience wins over- do notice the parrot on the counter wall looks funny. :P
7) seats are damn comfortable. And proper spacing in between them. 
8) Large seating area. 
9) Even if you are late as I was no compromise in quantity of food and service offered to us with smiling face. 
10) substantial quantity at reasonable prices. 

Cons:-
1) Entrance needs improvement a bit. 
2) Chinese gravy items should have less corn starch. 

Satisfactory experience. :-)

Hatari at Triangular Park is one of my favorite places whenever I think of having something good outside. I have been visiting this place since my school days, though it felt expensive during those times, but now Hatari seems to be one of the finest offerings with sumptuous quantity and standard quality every time I visit this place. 
The dishes are really tasty, try out the lamb ones or the shredded chicken ones, with special rices like korean rice. The red pepper chicken balls  and pan fried fish in starters are very good also. Please try to stick to chinese menu here, as I really do not find the mughlai or north indian dishes up to the mark of the chinese counterparts. for example, the biryani is very bad here. If you can, then try out their special oriental cuisine though they are not offering that menu card always. 
For improvement, I feel the staff can be more courteous + they need to seriously work on their entrance to the restaurant. It gives a very shabby feeling.
I am regular goer here, starting from small hang outs to family dinners, Hatari has bee one of the first choices that comes to mind.

We went there with my Mrs.,Brother in law and his Mrs.
It,s an average restaurant, normally we go for hangout. Neither variety in food items nor in taste. 

Good thing is only quantity, is huge. In one plate, two are comfortable.
Accessibility of the restaurant is quite easy, situated on the main road. Walking distance from Gariahat Crossing. 

Bad things are A.C., not working properly, or it may be a eyewash.

One thing that attract me to visit this place is their Special Oriental Cuisine. Decor and lighting could be much improved, and a little brightness would help liven up the atmosphere. I went there with my 2 friends (Amit Mukherjee and Mainak Bhattacharyya) and we ordered 1 Fish Chilly and Pepper (Tossed fish with chilly and pepper finished with wine) as starter and for main courses we ordered pure oriental cuisine; 1 Nasi Goreng (Indonesian dish, rice with chicken, shrimps, lamb, fried eggs finished with Shao Shing wine), 1 Hunan Rice (Chinese dish, rice with Crispy chicken, prawns, lambs pieces, cauliflower and corn flavoured with lemon juice) 1 Chengdu Chicken (A Sichuan dish; Sliced chicken cooked in spicy red chilly sauce) and 1 Tsing Hoi Chicken (Chinese dish, cube chicken toss with cashew nut and bell pepper). Food is mouth watering in quality more than enough quantity and the preparation was extremely satisfactory. What I have liked about Hatari is that they give good quantity and they offer prompt service. The pricing is very very affordable and goes easy on your pocket. The ambience is decent and the staffs are helpful and well mannered. I think this restaurant is totally worth for money.

Hatari, the place famous with school and college students. Perfect for that reunion or that birthday treat on a budget. Quantity and definitely not quality is what Hatari stands for. The decor is very average although decent considering the cost . The food is good and quality is consistent. However, the place is always crowded due to its prime location on Rashbehari Avenue and close proximity to Gariahat. 

TIP: Avoid the place on special occasions. The  waiting time can be a nightmare!!!!

Recommended if you are on a budget. Must try for hang out with friends!!! Takeaway is another good option .

Frequented by inhabitants of South Kolkata, this is a place where one gets quality Indian-Chinese food offered at moderate prices and ample quantity.The most exciting thing is that one plate of any rice or noodles feed two unless u r a great foodie like me.. :D

Well I have grown up hearing tales of parents and uncles visiting the place for a dinner date. I have been to the place quite a few times myself. Here is the review

The plus
1.Large portions of food. One serving suffices for two 
2.Fairly friendly staff who can recommend you a thing or two
3.Decent family atmosphere
4.They stock some real good soups and starters
5.They offer home delivery

The minus
1.There's no waiting area outside(this is a shame as the restaurant is quite full on weekends)
2.The main courses lack variety
3.The dessert menu is very limited
4.It is somewhere in between a casual hang out place and fine dining.

Hatari is quite an old restaurant nearby-  often frequented by shoppers around Gariahat / deshapriya park. They have nice sitting arrangements inside but not so great waiting area-  which starts from the small balcony area and can soon overflow to the stairs. 
Foodwise they are an average chinese restaurant- I would not be raving about , but the price range makes them enjoyable.  Crowd wise it is mostly family crowd only and if I recollect they only expect family or groups as they do not have couple seats or trio's. 
What I have liked about Hatari in the past is that they give good quantity and they offer prompt service .
Cons : Not too much variety and sometimes to serve maximum customers they rush you while you are enjoying your meal.

The name "Hatari" says it all!! One of the oldest and most reputable restaurants in the Gariahat area, don't let the exterior fool you! I know it's a bit hard to spot.... and as you climb up the stairs and enter the passageway, you might even start having second thoughts! But be patient... I guarantee, you won't be disappointed.

Let's come to the real part. Went with a friend to have lunch. We ordered one Mixed Fried Rice, one Schezwan Lamb, and one Brown Glazed Duck. The rice and the lamb were just AMAZING!! I highly recommend the Schezwan Lamb. I've heard a lot how Hatari serves the best duck dishes in the city. I've never tasted duck before, so couldn't compare it with a dish of a different restaurant. But the preparation was extremely satisfactory.

The ambiance is a very comfortable one, and the waiters are courteous too. In all, I would love to go back ASAP and try out a couple of new dishes... maybe a crab or a pork item next time!

Massive quantity. Pocket-friendly pricing.
Ambience: It is quite a large place with ample seating. Very suited for small parties, birthdays, treats and likes (you get the drift right?!) The ambience is bright and airy and yet you will find yourself a bit suffocated on weekend nights and holidays due to the huge crowd the place pulls!
Service: I havn't had any issues with their service as yet and I have been visiting this place for quite a while now. But I usually avoid the weekends and holidays for the long queues, so cannot really tell you how they perform under pressure! Anyway, otherwise the staff is welcoming, efficient and prompt.
Food: Usually I go for Chinese at Hatari (originally it was a Chinese place back in the 90s) but I tried their Indian recently and found it pretty decent as well. The Chinese here is totally suited to the Indian palate. It is a tad bit too rich and spicy and the flavours seem a bit mixed up. But who cares when you are among friends and having a gala time chatting and stuff! The quantity is gargantuan and the attractive pricing make this place an obvious choice if you have to treat your group on your birthday or such.
Recommendation: Have a large group of friends to treat on a small budget? Hatari has to be your choice.
P.S- Cannot really dig the name though and that too of a restaurant! I mean, why would you name a restaurant Hatari, which in Swahili means 'danger'?! Food for thought...

Hatari has had been one of the top favorites during our college days. It is a cool place to catch up with friends and offers lip-smacking Chinese and Indian delicacies at a price which is pocket friendly for students. I personally feel that their Nasi Goreng, Chicken Manchurian and the duck & crab preparations are the crowd pullers. The entrance to the restaurant could be more elegant, however.

So far for the past 30 years or so, this was one of the cheapest yet good Chinese Restaurants in Calcutta.  Recently they have hiked their price due to inflation which is perhaps justifiable.

Hot-and-sour soup, Garlic Chicken, Pork in Oyster sauce, Steamed Rice, Egg-fried Rice, Hakka Noodles are some of the favorite dishes here.

Location is great, quantity for price is equally great.

Its been there for as long as i can remember and every time ive been there ive had Chinese and have never been dissapointed. Their chopsuey is great- the most unique! Instead of normal crispy chow, they serve a nimki sort of thingwhich is fantastic. Their soups are yum as is their crispy chilli chicken. My personal favourite is their garlic chicken n sweet and sour prawns. Decor wise its very basic and its a bit noisy. The service is fast. Dont go there for anything except food. The food too is simple indian chinese and nothing fancy yet it's something i super like. Its actually amust for all foodies!  The only downside is that every time you go, you have to wait- its almost never empty and the smell of food while you wait makes you hungrier! I became hungry while thinking about it- so you can imagine the magnetic charm of hatari.

Yeah here you have a lot to choose from! I've been here twice. First time,the chopsuey was really good,with lots and lots of chicken, and the orange blossom was fantabulous! The crispy chicken we had was good too. But the 2nd time I went in,I was utterly disappointed with the biryani! It was unevenly spicy having patches of red and white rice,and the spices weren't the usual ones and really bad. The shanghai fried rice was okay and then again I had the orange blossom which was wow! The location is good,steps away from Priya cinema and near Gariahat,and is the only restaurant in that area,so it recieves a huuuge rush before and during pujas,so its advisable not to visit it then. But at other times,with good food and good interiors,Hatari is a nice place to dine-in.

Its a place which we have frequented with our parents since we were kids - so a lot of happy memories are linked to it! However the best thing about the place still happens to be that the quality and taste when compared to the price is still decent! The crispy chicken and green chilly chicken can still hold their own with chinese food lovers. The service however needs to be more alert, specially since it is almost always full and has people waiting for their chance at the table. An afternoon chat session with friends is not a bad idea!

what amazes me is that in spite of the large number of options  that are available now for chinese cuisine...  the popularity of this place never seems to go down... on holidays one still has to wait in a long queue... and the food still taste the same after so many years...
especially the GREEN CHILI CHICKEN .... and the duck dishes.... love em... this was the plac ei had duck for the first time.... and loved it.... :) and it still stays my fav meat...

Hatari had been there for a long time and have provided unbelievable service throughout. They have expanded their space as well as their menu! This place offers Indian and Chinese and has recently introduced Oriental. Indian food has all the conventional things you can think of. And they are well prepared and fresh! Same for the Chinese dishes. They offer lamb and pork apart from chicken,fish and prawn! Prices are not very peaky, still i suggest do carry some extra cash! 
Now coming to the Oriental menu! Here the prices are steep but the food is not that good to match the prices! They are a little more flavored than their regular Chinese and hav fancy names! :)

A family restaurant for me as i visit at least once a month. The biggest quality of the place is the quantity of food in each dish. 2 average people can fill their tummy totally with a rice or noodles dish and some side dish. Some say that they provide good quality dishes of lamb too, although i haven't tasted it personally. Prices could have been lowered by 20-50 rupees depending on dish, but can't complain because of the quantity and increasing commercial taxes and price of commodities. The old waiters are quite generous and help the new ones to learn fast too, change noticeable in a month only. Do not experiment with tandoor dishes, u may get disappointed. My favourites are canton chicken, hot garlic chicken, chicken with wine sauce, fish manchurian and chopsuey :)

An all time favourite hang outs. Spent lots of good time with good foods in college days. Loved the chineese dishes. Momo , mixed noodles or chicken chilly/manchurian. ambience is good, taste is excellent and price is just the right. The location is well situated among the busy marketing area of Gariahat Triangular park although the entrance is small and one may have to find it if not regular at here. Steamed momo is highly recommended. Best for Calcuttan  chineese dishes. (foodies in search of authentic chineese food should look for someplace else)

Hatari is one of the oldest restaurants in South Calcutta, and has now come up with several outlets, though my favourite one is still the one on Rashbehari Avenue. During rush hours, you might have to wait around 20-30 minutes to get a table, but when you do, it's worth it.

The decor is not exceptional, but quite nice. The arrangement is comfortable.

The food here is top notch in terms of both quality and quantity. If you have decided to leave out on starters and gorge straight to the main course, the quantity can be a bit befuddling. Three portions would suffice for 4 adults, but one portion for 2 adults is a little less than what would fill your tummy.

Start off with the Dry Chili Lamb, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn and Spring Chicken along with a sip of Blue lagoon. The Drums of Heaven are also good and the Chicken Mushroom soup is fantastic. They also make kebabs, but the Mughlai section is not as good as the Chinese spread.

For the main course, you can try the Schezwan Rice Noodles. The Pan-Fried Noodles are also  tasty. The Chilly Pork is delectable, and the Shredded Chicken items are also treats for your taste-buds. The Manchurian Prawn is one of their special items and the Glazed Duck - if available - is surely a treat. However, the Korean Lamb is excessively sweet and could potentially spoil your dinner unless you look at it as the premature dessert!

For the dessert section - and for loyal customers, the staff often go the extra mile and serve complementary desserts at times - the Double Sundae is worth tasting.

Verdict: Located near Gariahat, quite reasonable prices, substantial helpings of quality food. But if you are on a budget, note that taxes are added extra to the price on the menu! Over-all, definitely a place I would love to go back to.

Pros:  I cant even remember how many times i have visited this place, after my school which is quite near(South Point at Gariahat). It is an ideal family restaurant and for outing with friends. very peaceful. prices are not at all steep. different variety of food. Also a place where you can brag of eating different types of animals (without having spent too much for it :p) The best occasion here was when i and my best friend had ordered pork fried rice,korean lamb, brown glazed duck, corn pakoras and tooty frooty. The korean lamb was too sweet and they themselves said so when we ordered :) The rest was superb,awesome,fantabulous,mind blowing. Also plays good music.

Cons: Its not spacious. order completion not very fast.

Conclusion : An ideal place for dining out for middle class families. and also for school going people going together with friends for some place to eat. Its not highly branded and advertised, but no need for it, as  the food and experience speaks for itself.

Full marks for the fast service, crispy chilli babycorns and the chicken mushroom soup. I have never had anything but the Chinese here, and I daresay I adore it to the core. Quite reasonably priced, good quantities, and piping hot food. Plus, they make a mean chilly pork, and my favorite - Spring Chicken (I have actually come here, had a plate of it with a glass of very cold thums up, and gone back to work). Plus, they really remember customers, and give them royal treatment when they return. 

Keep up the good work!

Hatari is spacious, good ambiance, good food.  I had the Lamb with Green Onions and Chicken Rice with Seared Black Mushrooms (Shitake)...the rice was really really yummilicious and the lamb was good too.  Large helpings didn't hurt either! Pricing could be a little lower. Good experience.  Only problem is Que forms at peak hours/holidays - that is frustrating.

I had a very recent visit. Hatari is located at Rashbehari Avenue. Not completely i was satisfied with their food quality but i only liked the Chicken Drumsticks. For starters i ordered Chicken Momo only which was okay and straightaway jumped for dinner. For dinner i ordered Machurian PRawn and Mixed Fried rice which was average. Ambience is pretty good and staffs are well-mannered. i would rate3.0 for Hatari.

I recall going there as a kid. Memory was good. Went back few months ago. I'm going to keep this short and simple. 

Sad to hear that the Mukherjee brothers have split. Two brothers now run Hatari at two different locations. 

What to say about their menu, its still trying to find its place... Not sure whether its the food which was gross or the fact that someone beside us was having Chowmein with Chicken Bharta & Tandoori Roti. Get me outta here someone please before I knock myself silly...

I don't know what they are making there folks, but if someone says Chinese, 'Jesus' .. that person is leading you down the garden path baby... (Lord forgive me for I have NOT taken your name in vain)...

Enter at your own risk ....

i liked the simple yet elegant ambiance and great biriyani. but one should also try the chicken lollipop. the sauce is just adequately spicy. the kababs are soft and yummy. the crispy chilly babycorn is also good. but you won't be going back just to have it. the location is an added advantage. apart from your own conveyance, the ac buses will drop you 10 steps ahead of hatari. the kalighat metro is also near by. it gets too crowded at times and then the waiting is boring. they need to improve the staircases which leads to the restaurant.

1. The arrangement is awesome.
2. The food quality was too good, I had Korean Chicken with Chicken Fried rice. Both were of great taste. liked a lot.
3. The quantity- Oh My God, two common people can easily manage with one plate each item.

So I'm giving 4.5 / 5 to Hatari just because serving tasty food in moderate price.

Well well what do we have here??? Hatari, my parents have simply seen it grow from a small non AC eatery to how it stands today and not to mention even I loved the food...Hatari has sincerely grown over the years but then not all things have changed for the better. The old waiters have changed and the new ones have a sense of attitude problem especially with the popularity they behave however they want. Music is often too bad a taste for a restaurant probably a chinese chime music or some other form of similar type of music would have added flavour. After the makeover it definitely looks better and the small room which used to be closed has opened up as extra space. The quality has at times decreased a notch and the prices have increased along with the menu size, however the quantity is enough to fill most stomach and the quality despite a fall in standards is still better by far than many in its range. 
My favourite is American chopsuey and thai pork/chicken(extra spicy). The rice has been good but last time found it over boiled and they changed it and the new oriental menu is good and a must try.
Go for the place if you are very hungry but for even similar prices there are much better options in the range but the location-price-quality-quantity combination it sells like hot cakes or probably sells as good as Hatari itself does with it's huge sales and the waiting queue it is a mark in itself.

Hatari is an extremely good restaurant in entire south. I love the location of it also. Whenever i go to priya cinema, i get into hatari for lunch or dinner. The ambiance is peaceful and soberly decorated. The snacks items like red pepper fish, chicken drums of heaven rock. 
This is an ideal place to hangout with friends. Starting from the delicious starters, you will have lots of items to please your mouth. You can try the chilli garlic chicken, schezwan fish, mandarin fish etc. These are all good here.
And I must mention that the quantity they serve is good enough for the price. A single plate of anything is sufficient for two.

A decent place to visit with your family and friends.The quality of food is great and the quantity is sufficient also.The pricing is not too high.
Visited during this Durga Puja Navami after waiting for an hour(7:30PM-8:30PM) we managed to enter in the eatery to fill our hungry stomachs.
The staffs and the people out there were okay but the serving time is not good at all.They take ages to serve your order.
One must try their Crispy Golden Prawn.It was awesome.But I found noodles broken in Mixed Chow which I didnt like at all.
Hatari must open a branch in North Kolkata or they will lose the Chinese Cuisine lovers like me to the China Town.

Well..we had been visiting this place for years and find the food to be reasonably good at a decent price. The quantity served is sufficient and a plethora of items are on the menu. So one is sure to find the items of his or her choice. Also the darshaan here is a must try. So is the dry chilli chicken. 
Overall, a good eat out joint, although one must be ready almost each time to wait in a long queue before the turn arrives to find a table.

Okay, had food there before, was in my good books of restaurants but when I tried to enter Hatari this time during the Puja, I was amazed to see the mismanagement. They kept people waiting for hours and let other people enter who had missed their turn. The behavior was bad enough by the staff that I actually felt insulted and decided to have my food elsewhere! Won't go there ever again, cause I am sure that they don't offer anything out of this world that can not be perfected by some other restaurant in the city!

First of all i did not like the entrance very much. But once you enter the dining area, the ambiance is quite nice. The waiters are warm & cordial. But i was highly disappointed with the food. Before i went there, i heard a lot about the food of Hatari, but on that very particular day nothing seemed right for me. May be it was the only particular day when the food was not upto the mark at Hatari. I ordered Chicken Lollypop, but instead they gave us something that tasted & looked more like Drums Of Heaven. May be there is not much of a difference between these two dishes according to Hatari chefs. Then i ordered Irani Fish Kabab & it was a a disastrous. Also i ordered Butter Chicken & it was the first Butter Chicken in my life which was extremely spicy. As far as my knowledge goes, its supposed to be on the sweeter side with taste of butter. Also i ordered Mutton Biriyanis for my home, but to end this on a better note, the Biriyanis were great. But out of so many dishes, only one turned out to be good, which is very disappointing according to the standards set by Hatari.

Hatari restaurant is a North Indian and Chinese restaurant located at 113/1B, Rash Behari Avenue, Kolkata. It is one of the landmarks in the prime shopping area called Gariahat. The restaurant is very spacious and the best part about the Hatari is the cool and calm ambience created by the amazing lighting work. 


The menu at Hatari includes everything that is North Indian and Chinese. The restaurant takes pride about the fact that it is one of the few restaurants in Kolkata that serves pork, lamb and duck dishes at the same time. 


I visited the restaurant with my parents on a busy Saturday evening. We had spent the whole day shopping for the upcoming Pujas and I was completely exhausted. I wanted to have dinner at a place which would be peaceful and at the same time provided quality food. This urge of mine led me and my family to Hatari. And believe me, I was not disappointed.


We immediately found a table for four. Once we were comfortable, we were approached by a very professional and friendly waiter. It was surprising that he did not start his conversation by asking us what we wanted to order. Instead, he greeted us very warmly and judging by our worn out looks, he said that whether we had a hectic day or not. This was a good feeling!


After some small talk, we placed our order. We had Cantonese and Chicken Asparagus soup along with a plate each of Chicken Satay and Crispy Fish for starters. For the mains, we ordered a plate of chili crab, chicken reshmi masala, Thai noodles and butter Nan. I also asked the waiter to serve cold drinks during the mains.


Like always, Hatari did not disappoint with any of the dishes. Whether it was the starters or the mains, the food was excellent. This is what I like about this place. No matter which time of the day you visit, the quality of the food and service will still be the same. I wonder how they manage to produce such excellent service every single day! And the best part about the whole dining experience is that it is not at all expensive. 


To be honest, I have never found any other restaurant in Kolkata to be as consistent in terms of both food and service as Hatari. And I dine out a lot! And it is this consistency of that will make me visit Hatari again and again and again! My heartiest regards to the management of Hatari for putting up and maintaining a fine dining restaurant in the heart of the city.

This is one of the very few restaurants that I have seen growing from a pretty ordinary one to a really fine dining restaurant. The food at Hatari has always been to my liking. I really like the thai soup (which they serve without chicken). The green and red chilly chicken are also nice. Overall the chinese/thai is very good. I have never tried Indian there (although I have been to this place many times in last 8-10 years). The service is very good. Very economical. Good place for family. 
Small word of caution - please take ample time on weekends/holiday's due to huge cue outside the restaurant.

Well i went there on my friends' insistence during pujas and thankfully,this time my experience was way better.We were 8 of us,and ordered---
pork mushroom soup,thai soup,chicken sweet corn soup:the soups were well prepared,with beautiful flavours.
Pork hakka chow,singapore noodles,schezuan noodles,ginger fried rice:They were good enough,though i did not like the ginger fried rice much.
Pork chilli,lamb with mushrooms,hunan chicken,chicken in red wine : the pork was delightful,i recommend it to anyone who goes there,the chicken was good,too. The lamb was slightly chewy.
The food was not bad,considering puja rush.I'm a convert and definitely going there for more of their extensive menu.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

pricing is a bit steep compared to the food and ambience...i had duck and it was nothing exceptional...in fact...the duck's original taste got overshadowed....seating arrangement is a bit cluttered and you don't feel much of a grandeur....average,very average!The mushroom fried rice i had did not have much variety in terms of flavours ,either....not worth repeated visits.

Awesome place..Though the entrance is creepy and at times you have to wait in a queue, extending to the staircase, but this place is really good. I have tried Indian and found it average. Bt the Chinese is simply awesome. The waiters are well behaved and know their menu. Quantities are great. I have tried American Chop suey, Red Pepper Chicken Scezwan Rice and Hongkong Chicken.
In a few restaurants the Chop Suey is served mixed with the gravy and loses its crispiness, but that is not the case here.
The Red Pepper Chicken was tangy, Scezwan Rice was spiced optimumly. Hongkong Chicken though, didn't look that good but was.
The pricing is a bit on the higher side compared to other restaurants especially for college goers like us (an average 3 course meal will cost u around 700).

I loved this restaurant. One of the best budget Chinese restaurant in Kolkata (excluding restaurants in China town).

Ambiance: 
Utterly ordinary. An AC restaurant, where you can sit and have your food. That's it! Not a place to choose for a romantic dinner. 

Service: 
Pretty prompt and systematic. They maintain waiting queue very efficiently. 

The best part of the Hatari is food. That's why it is required to analyze it thoroughly. 
Food taste: 
Can't say just like in China. After all most of the restaurants in India serves Indian-Chinese. In that regard, one of the best I have ever had. I visited almost 5-6 times, and it had never disappointed me. My hit-list- any preparation of prawns, chicken hot-garlic and sweet and sour chicken.

Food cost:
Not very cheap, but, affordable.

Food quantity:
I am called as a monster among my friends, and, I could never eat one full plate of rice or noodles. One rice preparation and one side dish is sufficient for three medium eater. Yaah, they may struggle a little for gravy though. But, whenever I visited, I always had to pack food and carry back home. Though food prices are little higher than other Indian-Chinese restaurants, actually it is tremendously value for money from the point of view of quantity and taste.

Food quality:
I have never had stomach ache or any other problems after having a lavish lunch/dinner here. 

Parking:
I did not find any dedicated parking place for this restaurant. May be it is there, I do not know. I parked in Rashbehari Avenue, the famous Kolkataian "keep your car in neutral" parking facility.

Overall experience:
A must visit place for all foodies. Every time I visit my beloved city of Joy, I visit Hatari once. May be for invitation, may be for shopping in Gariahat. But, I never felt like "Jotheshto hoyeche, ar bhalo lage na" for Hatari. Hatari, you rock.

I visit hatari quite often. Their chinese is pretty good and pocket-friendly specially if you are in large groups.  
I would recommend their mixed fried rice, prawn balls, american chopsuey,  green chilli chicken, shanghai chicken, crispy chicken etc........

They serve huge portions and during holidays or puja or for any special occasions like birthdays etc make prior bookings.

Went to Hatari on my Birthday with friends. 

Pan fried chilli fish was awesome. Tasted chicken kababs, mixed fried rice, kulcha, chicken manchurian.

Waiters were cordial & the restaurant ambiance were good. I will definitely visit this place in the near future. But one thing which i dislike is the entrance of this restaurant. Otherwise this was is a very good place.

pan fried chilli fish is awsome. Very good for giving treat to a large group because quantity/cost ratio is very high. Quality is also good. On weekend, try to go early else have to wait in long que.

I had taken the american chopsuey for most of the times of those innumerable visits I made to this resturant. And in one word - WONDERFUL. I have hardly tasted better chopsuey in Kolkata. Good food at reasonable price - thats what hatari is all about. But I prefer their chinese menu over the indian ones - their biriyani I once tried didn't impress me much.

Had a really average kind of an experience when we found that there was no proper waiting area and people lined up outside the restaurant, in a narrow corridor for hours. Food quality was average, sitting arrangements can make one feel claustrophobic when the hall gets crowded and all seats are full. The service is quite ordinary. The price though do not generate much of a sweat...

The place has some of the best foods in town for very cheap rates and it gives amazing quantity of food in each plate.Located on the main road, its a nice place to go out to for dinner if you want a satisfied evening out. You could start out with the Thai Soup which is very nice followed by some Crispy Chilly Lamb. Order some American Chopseuys for the main course but stick to the general side dishes. Manchurian Chicken is really good. The prawn is also wonderful. Wash it down with a sundae and it will be one of the most wonderful dinners you would have had.

During every Durga Puja, Hatari is always among one of the many restaurants that we visit. I won't say the ambiance is very good and the food tastes exceptional. But yes, it is an average restaurant. It is a 'Value for Money' restaurant. The food is average and the price they charge for each item is reasonable considering the quantity that they serve. Hatari is the perfect restaurant for a casual dinner or lunch with family.

i have been visiting this restaurant for the last 40 years. The quality of food is excellent. The quantity is unearthly. You take one portioning of any item and three of you will be satisfied. Price of each of the items is very reasonable in comparison to the quantity that is served. It feels good to see how hatari has maintained its standard over the years. The staff are always courteous and helpful. Do go early on a weekend evening as entry is on a first come first serve basis.

Not a good restaurant for repeated visits, food quality is very ordinary so the price seems high comparing to the quality of food, service is not that good, have to call for several times then waiter comes and chinese foods are not authentic, they taste like street food.. so if u are looking for a good tasty meal then dont go there..

I am a regular visitor to this place.  A nice place to go with both your friends and families or your girl/boy friends, nice ambiance, good food at a reasonable rate, courteous and well behaved staff.  There is no chance of over ordering - the waiters will warn you that the amount of food you are ordering may be more for you to finish. - Good parcel service.  A nice place overall.
