I went there on the 1st day of this year and found it quite empty in the evening which actually i liked.

This is located in the 9th floor of Fort Knox building and has both open roof top and closed with view of Kolkata.

The decor is quite soothing and perfect for a lounge with ceiling designs, wall hanging and perfect lighting.

We ordered the Mahi Irani Kebab (fish kebab and this was so soft and perfectly cooked) and Murgh Makhmali Kebab (The chicken kebab was also quite good).

They also have a large range of liquors available.

I am sorry but had to share my expirience that i had last night that is 31 st of december 2017.I understand thag this is a day of mere rush and chaos as far as lounges and pubs of the city is concerned because of the high demand of the type.So simply it was a new years eve and we wanted to party in a good club with a rooftop and urban desi being one of my all time favourites i didnt give a second thought and called the management to make sure of the cover charges for that particular night ,they picked up the call and clearly said that Stag:INR 2000,Female stag:INR 1500 Couple :3000.I was pretty cool with that and made my plans with four of other friends to visit Urband Desi.We called again twice before leaving clearly stating that we would be there by 9 and making sure of the cover charges one more time and they reconfirmed it once again,so we were expecting to a clear transition of entry while we were there.But i am very sad to state that i have never seen such callous management ever in my entire life who harrassed us upon arrival saying that we dont allow stag entries to this place and when i said you guys reconfirmed they are just denying the fact that they did it and then i showed him the phone number which i called to which they responded that someone else mite have taken the call we r not responsibpe for this..,when that is the only number which has been provided to zomato for Urban Desi Kolkata.I mean such irresponsible and calous managemnt is definitely not expected from a lounge of this stature.I have been there beforr so many times and had recommended this place to sony friends of mine but last night we were utterly disappointed and i dont think i would ever go back to this place again.

I visited this place on 24.12.2017. They took cover charge of 2000 which was redeemable inside. We had dry chicken and bar b q pizza üçï. For raspberry vodka and rum. Taste was average. Location was good. They have live dj which is the most attractive thing. Overall i had a good experience.

Pathetic service ! We had to wait as long as 45 minutes for a pizza ! That too ultimately it didn't arrive ! And more so the staff was not courteous enough to come and inform us that the order wasn't ready ! Not happy !

This place is located at a very prominent location in Camac Street.. The decor is cool n ambience is soothing, it's not much crowded.. From the glass pane the city looks beautiful in the evening.. Now coming to the food, food quality is ok.. If u r up fr boozing then pocket pinch is on the higher side.. Plus they don't have much option available..we had hookah too, which I liked the most among all.. Overall a decent place with no cheap crowds.. Good option if you are looking for a hangout with friends..

Visited the place with friends. Located just opposite to Monkey Bar which already sets a high expectation. 
This place was not a disappointment at all.

Has a great ambience,good music and a dance floor.
The food we ordered- chicken bbq pizza , chicken pasta in white sauce and the butter garlic prawns were all delicious.

Really liked the cocktails and mocktail that we ordered,particularly whiskey sour. 

Overall experience was pretty good and a nice place to hang out with friends.

Located right opposite to Monkey bar on the 9th floor of Fort Knox.. Urban Desi offers a beautiful view of the city through its indoor as well as outdoor seating
The lounge spans across a big area & I absolutely loved the ambiance. Went there with my friend cum colleague for a hookah after an early wrap up on Friday evening.
Along with Pan rasna hookah, we ordered BBQ Chicken pizza & fresh lime soda.
I quite liked the pizza though my friend didn't.. she felt there was an excess of sauce on the pizza.
Coming to service.. very well behaved staff.
Decent crowd.
Good music.
Overall, it was a relaxing & fun Fri-yay evening spent at Urban Desi! Loved it!
P.S- They charge an extra service tax which is apart from GST. On questioning the waiter, we were being told that's optional. Do take note of that while paying the bill.

Happy eating üòä

This is as mediocre as they get.
Same floor, same building as Monkey Bar, but while that's one of the best bars in Kolkata, Urban Desi struggles to meet expectations even on grounds such as music. At one point, they were playing some really bad Punjabi mash-ups, mixed with Careless Whisper.

Anyway, credit where it's due. The place looks good. Good seating arrangement, both indoors and outdoors. The outdoor seating needs slightly more light on the table and less on the fence. It's very annoying to have strong blue light on your face when you're turning sideways to talk to your friend.

Very courteous staff. Most beers aren't available. So we ordered Buds and Jim Beams.
And chicken wings. Delicious. Very nicely cooked. Good quantities too.

This is worth a visit in this area, but only if you have visited Monkey Bar multiple times and want a quieter place to chill. I bet they'll improve over time.

Recommended.

I must tell this place is better than so hyped someplace else, what's up or any popular names. It's a very good place to go with groups... 
Tips to Urban Desi: AC was not that cool, need large dance floor.

I wanted to visit this place and when finally I dropped in I wasn't too impressed about it!
The sofas that they had are not in a very good condition. I don't know why they claim that they have a dance floor because the part the claim to be one is too small for dancing!
We ordered a pasta (this one tasted pretty good), a chicken BBQ pizza (which was a thin crust one and was nothing great) and had ordered mocktails! I didn't find the mocktails to be impressive too.
I won't much say about the ambience because when we went there there were still some daylight and the lights weren't on yet. I believe it would have been a much better experience regarding the ambience of the place had we gone there a bit late.. at least that's what I suppose if I look at the pictures.
Service wasn't bad.. and let mention they have an interesting washroom üòÅüòâ

I have fallen in love with the ambience. If you are looking for a great ambience, this is just the place for u. Coming to food. I loved the taste of all the food items I ordered. The quantity is too much! We ordered for chicken fried rice (1 plate of rice is sufficient for 3 people). We also ordered pan fried chilli fish and mandarin chicken. Staffs were also very courteous.

So we wanted to visit monkey bar, but it was already full there ,hence we decided to check out this place out, just opposite to monkey bar. Quite a decent place with decent crowd. Music was kinda loud according to me but wasnt that bad. Now coming to the mocktails we ordered, hawana beach was orange in color , which dint taste that well, normal orange tropicana was added ,rest was just soda water.. the lime mojito which tasted just like roadside nimbupani. Moctails was total dissapointment there... then we ordered BBQ chicken pizza n that tasted pretty okay..! Next we ordered chili chicken gravy n chicken hakka noodles, to my surprise the quantity was veryy good, n this two tasted well :) overall service , drinks , music could have been better. Try their outdoor seating, serves amazing city view :)

Located at Camac street, this is a very familiar name for food & drink lovers. This 9th floor pub is full of energy and youth, yet classy. Seating arrangements are well spaced and¬† lighting puts u in the mood of Party. Now lets talk about food. limited options for both veg & non-veg, but they are extremely well prepared and tastes great. Barbecue chicken pizza, chicken resmi kebab, pan fried fish are my recommendation. Drinks- served quickly, i wish glasses were bit fancy and good looking specially for whisky. Place is quite pocket friendly specially with, 2+1 or 1+1 offers. Try to get coupons from nearby to get extra discounts. Don't forget to try their flavoured hookah.
Staffs are well behaved and music is nice and its gets better with each passing moment. Definitely a place for multiple times visit.

Ambience good but nothing extraordinary. Casual pub type with sudden loud disco lights (forced to create stance). We went there primarily for pool and drinks together as there are a very few here in kolkata but pool table is just a disaster. Pool room is a smoking zone and aircon not working effectively. Pan fried chilli fish was good and thats it. Would not like to go here again.

drinks 5/5, good variety, collection, most important: they have all the items of the menu. Service: 5/5 ( Specially to mention service steward Mr.Lyton. They have good wide range of offers, but at the end it is not helpful. pocket Pinch: little bit on the higher side. We had Absolute Vodka 1:1 @ 500 =1000
Draught Beer 3ltr tower 990/-, Draught beer mug of 250ml : 120/- canberry juice: @120/-, hokka: 500/- fish tikka: 390/- and pan fried chilli fish: 390/- , we were 3 ppl and bill came to Rs.4100/- inclusive of all tax, They charged 5% service tax, but we were informed that if we dont want to pay, we can avoid that. A good gesture from the accounts side.

An ok bar. The music was appreciable. Played a cool mix of Bollywood and Hollywood. Also, seems a bit cheap on pocket. Though they can add something to their menu card. Ambience also needs a professional touch up. I think the ambience doesn't go with the genre of the place. 

One thing I could not get is why did they allow underaged guys and girls inside an alcoholic bar. It's should be a 21 and above place, I suppose.

A colorful and posh lounge located in the same floor as Monkey Bar.. Our primary reason to visit this place was non-availability of seats at Monkey Bar and also this place was providing some lucrative 1:1 offers on drinks.. To start with the place is huge, one side of the restaurant has a huge glass pane with elegant white curtains overlooking the Kolkata skyline.. They have a rooftop open air setting as well as a separate section with games like pool.. The interiors has a dominance of blue hues along with peppy numbers and disco balls to add to the charm.. A nice alternative for party hoppers as well as a romantic date with your loved ones.. Coming to service the place was mostly empty and hence the server was attentive enough as well as courteous.. Since, we were not in the mood for anything heavy or filling we ordered a Large SMIRNOFF (1+1) and a
LAT ME KAI Chicken: Nicely done, crisp and spiced adequately.. Lots of garlic and spring onions.. Portion was sufficient for 2 people..
The prices are definitely up-market but if you are willing to spend for the grandeur of the ambiance then this place deserves a visit atleast once.. Our total cheque for just 1 starter and 2 Large pegs of drinks was Rs.942/- (all incl.)..

I visited the Urban desi for the first time yesterday. I can only tell you this pub is for selected people who love hookahs with drinks and Bollywood music. The pros were the smoking area balcony and the service, which is very nice with the staffs being pretty cordial. The cons were the food, the music (mostly for me) and the foosball table (flawed one with slope and cover. balls get stuck but u can't take it as it is covered from the top). The decor was mediocre. So, I shall not be visiting this place, but then again i say it is meant for different mentality of crowd maybe.

Been to monkey bar just right beside it. Urban Desi certainly doesn't match up with it. I believe mainly it would be the management. Huge huge potential to get more crowds. Decor wise, ambience wise I find urban Desi way better. The real let down was the service. I think they miscommunicated in terms of happy hours and discount offers. Nevertheless was scrolling Zomato, came across this bar. Definitely not a second try

A place,bit on the Mid-Lavish side..calls for a visit! Happy Hours serve 1 free 60ml of a selected 42%..üòà.. The decor is amazing and i thought of taking some decor lights back home.. üòâ.. Coming to the food.. Do try the Grilled Non-Veg Platter and the Barbeque chicken pizza, which though thin crusted, is ammmmazing... And top it up with one of the best Hookahs in town, for sure... It has a separate rooftop which is also the Smoking Zone.. And the staff are very well behaved.. And guess what!? India won 1-0 against Kyrgyzstan on that day and they had a screening of the whole match on a big screen.. 
This place is a great one for 'Brothers in Arms' and for Romance too(not on Match daysüòâ).. 
DO gv it a visit folks.. Till then Eat well.. üòç

Excellent food. Excellent music. And excellent ambience. The place, after renovation looks beautiful and the staff is extremely helpful and courteous.

Let me begin by saying this " the area where you go to get lung cancer ( smoking zone), has a pretty nice view"

The food is okay , the chicken is tender , the beer is flat ,atleast the one they use in the tower( don't think ale or lager or stout is available).They probably are using Budweiser , but not sure on that. A two litre tower is 1450‚Çπ + tax . I don't know whether this is a reasonable price or not. But at this price point you can probably buy Vijay Malya himself. The starters were three at the price of two. Not too shabby for the Mughlai stuff , but the Chinese counterpart tastes all the same no matter what you are going for. The place has a good ambience and is not too packed , space is abundant. Hookah available. If you are going for drinks , food and hookah then the bill wont be a pocket pinch ; it will be a wallet punch. 

Overall , its not too bad for a hangout.

P.S. : They have a projector inside and they show IPL instead of EPL. Hence the 3.5 rating and not the 4.

Situated on the 9th floor of Fort Knox, Camac Street this place is a total disappointment!! Please note that 2.5 is an overrating!!
We three were supposed to hit the Monkey Bar on Sat evening.But on reaching we came to know that the place was booked for a private party hence we thought of checking out the pub,just bang opposite to MB, the Urban Desi.
Ambience- Tremendously loud music, just awful! Requesting to lower down the volume didn't do enough justice. Spacious inside,also there's an open sitting area. There's a separate bar counter with bar stools.
Drinks- We ordered 2 Sangria (red) and 1 Long Island Iced Tea. Sangria was awful! It was watery, didn't taste wine. On enquiring we learnt the wine was Sula.Not worth!! The Long Island iced tea was moderate.
Food- Butter garlic prawns,chicken seekh kebab and pan fried chilli fish.
The prawns were tasty but sizes were just moderate.
The fish was absolutely not upto the mark. No way, those were pan fried. Instead it was served red and extremely saucy. The quality of the fish wasn't good either.
The chicken seekh kebab was an equal disaster. It was so salty and dry, a deadly combination of a repulsive dish!
Service- Quick and the staff was polite.
On complaining of the food & drinks, without any argument, we were served with 3 complimentary dishes (chicken in oyster sauce, murgh tikka kebab and a fish prep),long island ice tea and 2 vodka(with cranberry) shots. The shots were good.The chicken in oyster sauce starter was again a pity. The quality of the chicken was poor,tasted bland,too chewy. The tikka kebab was tasty and can be safely ordered. The fish wasn't again cooked well and none of us could enjoy it.
Tax- Besides VAT,KK Cess,Edu Cess,service tax in the cheque there were 2 extra taxes levied, Service Charge(5%) and service charge on service tax!!!
On asking about the latter two we learnt those were optional.Huh????!!!! Then why those were billed to us without our consent? On objecting at once those 2 were waived off. We were utterly shocked at their attitude.
I'm never going back to this place. Total waste of time n' money. But yes their politeness is definitely a 10/10.

A much awaited visit to Urban Desi finally took place a few months back.We were bored to death and suddenly planned to hit Urban desi as happy hours were going on here üòÅ .Added advantage was our Nearbuy voucher !
Decor and ambience - 5/5 
Ambience here is just killing! Beautifully decorated with cozy chairs and sofas , dimly lit yet wonderfully organized Bar with bar stools caught our eye.
Moreover , the bright and gorgeous antique style hanging lanterns amazed us.
Food and drinks - 4.5/5 
Food here is not great but good.After much discussions over the menu we zeroed down to a fish starter which was very tasty and piping hot.
We took few pegs of Ballentine's finest whiskey with mineral water.Tasty fish tikkas tasted great with sips of our favourite scotch ! üòãüòä 
Hookah was not available as during that duration Hookah was banned temporarily by the WB Govt.
Location - It's on the ninth floor of Fort Knox residency, Camac street , near La Martinere School for boys.
Service - 5/5 
Service I must say was very good here.Waiters were much polite and served us timely whenever required.Also , the servers made few rounds to check whether we need anything or not.
Outdoor seating - 5/5 
The most amazing part of this place is the outdoor seating area.We smoke while enjoying the amazing view of camac street with our drinks from the ninth floor of Fort Knox , added perk was the cool breeze air! 
Cost - 4/5
Cost was more or less resonable as the area is a posh locality of camac street.

It's the first time that I am writing a review for a restaurant.. however I have never thought of doing this for such reason. Out of so many places that I have visited so far this place is one of them that disappointed me to such extent that I wouldn't ever like to visit this place again nor I will suggest any of my friends to go there.Ambience wise it's an eye candy place.. specially the rooftop space for hookah.. but the service and staff behavior is very bad. They took 35 minutes to prepare a hookah.. 1 hour to make a platter.. at last we cancelled 3 items and got to know they didn't even started preparing them.we ordered another hookah. Suddenly it's started raining and we asked for another place where we would have it and found a single mini sofa . It was a ciggerate smoking zone not a hookah closure.. when we asked for a place to sit they said that is all we had please manage among yourselves. Not only that one Waiter started arguing with us.. finally we paid the bills and left the place. The whole experience was very derogatory.. I am very disappointed with the place and the staff's service. I am not sure whether I will be visiting this place anymore

They say Happy Hours till 9 PM. And they have only Fosters in Happy Hours for Beer at 3+1. No other beer. Drinks are hugely overpriced and then they say 1+1 on 7 drinks they offer in Happy Hours. 
Super place to go and sit in the dark, somehow manage to look at the menu in the dark and then see all these overpriced drinks.

Lovely decor. Loved the lamp lights inside and the  Xmas tree they made out of lights and ivy leaves during Xmas. The outdoor seating was brilliant on a chilly December night. The shisha had to be replaced theee to four times as the smoke was not proper but the servers were very helpful and even gave us a discount on the bill due to the inconvenience. The food and drinks are good though a bit overpriced. Best part about the place is the ambience and the music which they play - instantly giving a party feel to the place.

Located on the 9th floor of Fort Knox building, I would seriously advise you to visit this place during the day and sit in the terrace for a terrific view. On the whole the decor on the place is nice, but any day wind and a great view beats everything. Add to it some great company and you are up for a treat.¬†
I visited here very recently, during happy hours and everything seemed to be on sale. The food was great and so was the service. However, I felt that they could have presented their dishes better so as to keep up with the upcoming competition round town. The menu however was in tatters and for a price you end up paying there, it isn't actually what you expect to see.¬†

You can avail buy one get one on almost everything during happy hours. Same with cocktails and mocktails.

This was my first visit to Urban Desi (27th December) , I am from Kolkata but I live in Bangalore so may be I was expecting more. It will be easier for everyone if I write the review in pros and cons.

Cons:
The service, was very sloppy.. There were ample staff but they all seems to be lost and confused. My non veg platter took atleast 35mins that too when there was no rush, It was around 4pm approx... Before leaving I had to literally go to the counter to ask for the bill, though after asking twice for the bill while on the table.

Now let me come to the Pros.

Pros:
Ambience was very nice.
Food was very good.
Quantity was also good.
The place was very neat and clean.
Music was great.

I think if the service which is the backbone of any outlet would have been prompt then definitely deserves more than 5+ stars. Hope on my next visit i would definitely change my cons into pros..
Cheers. Happy New Year 2017 to all of you..

MAIN FEATURES TO WOO YOU::

1. Classy interiors¬†
2. rocking music , with a live¬†disc jockey
3. top floor (8th) view of the city.

a place to relish , a place to let yourself go....

AMBIENCE::

like a normal hookah parlour only the lighting is a bit new style , an assimilation of retro and classic is the main plus point here ,¬†

the entry is not¬†so happening little drowsy¬†

the waiters are helpful ¬†but sometimes the music seems to be repetitive .

UD has an outer open air area seating arena as well but its too small and not so cool like its interiors .

FOOD:: ¬†Well the hookah was nice , aroma was good , noodles were nice but pricing is ¬†again on the higher side¬†

ANYTHING SPECIAL???

the giant screen¬†TVs¬†, the small screen leads at the bar reminds me of an American¬†bar ,¬†

the lighting is worth watching and the standard¬†of the DJ is cool

So, grab your friend and have a blast..!!

Location: situated in camac street, on the same building as monkey bar.

Interior designing: it has a glass door and when you enter inside, the most attractive thing you will ever see is the bar. It is lighted up and stands out the most. The side part of the area looks like a total dining area and the other side is the bar. It is pretty nice and comfortable. The only thing i didnt like is the bathroom. It is a unisex bathroom with unisex stalls.

Food and the service: they have a buy 3 corona and get 1 free so we had that. Then we had 1 strawberry blossom and 1 Margherita. Then we had drums of heaven. It was pretty good and margherita was very strong, just the way i like it.

Coming back here again soon

A good hang out place. Be it during the day or night. A huge space ! Loved the ceiling lamps and the way the entire window was laided with different country flags ! (I think the flags should be there through out the year and not just for matches !)

The bar lights are very colorful and pop. (Not the main blue neon light though.) The blue light is taking away the entire glory ! The white stools outside in the verandah aren't comfortable at all.

Food is okay. Service is a bit slow. Rates are a bit on the higher side.

This place is very good if you'd wanna watch a live sports screening or wanna catch up for a couple of drinks or sheesha.

Recommended - Blue Hawaiian ! It's a mocktail and it's very good !

Not a nice experience I would say....
Hookah was disgusting
Food was just OK!
And don't even get me started on drinks.
My first experience here was good but the second one was awful.... The staff was good and the ambience was okayish....I surely don't recommend this to anyone.

In the name of happy hours , the management is just cheating customers. The service is so pathetic that it feels like we are begging in front of them for food and all. While happy hours , they double the price of happy hours selected menu and give a different rate card. This is totally a worst thing that I have seen. It's better you don't give happy hours than instead of taking it other way. The restaurant doesn't deserve a visit at any cost.

Went there cause I had a card from my gym giving me a coffee there. Had the cold coffee, - it was fantastic! :) , (with chocolate sauce n all) (as good as Aauris). The view of the Kolkata skyline from the 9th floor was stunning. The guy at the bar was very sweet, *really* sweet. I highly recommend you have the coffee over there (don't know what the price is, but I'm sure Zomato has the menu).

Interestingly, it looks like they have BC Jukebox (bcjukebox.in) - a website/app which allows you to request songs for the place from your cellphone, even though my *gym*, from where I GOT the coffee card does not!! - even though I've requested¬† them umpteen times :( Nice! Any Karma guys reading this - please TELL them!!!

Just 2 gripes - the *name* is not written anywhere - please put up a board somewhere or something, guys. And the lift on the other side of the building, which I first took, goes only to the 4th or 5th floor or something - which wasn't possible to know. Had to get out and go around to the other lift, to get to the 9th floor. Peculiar.

Anyway.

It is located on 9th floor of Fort Knox on CAMAC street. 
Liked the ambience for outdoor sitting. However they have no provision if it rains. Rain is the best time to sit outside. Staff is polite so on request it stopped raining they arranged outdoor sitting. Service of this place is good. 
But the drinks are bad! Must be thinking how can drinks be bad. But they seemed to be local liquor or not the original ones.  Me and my friend both had our doubts cause it's taste was something weird. 
Food is again not great. 
Just the ambience is good here.

The only good factor about this place was the ambiance. They cannot make cocktails . The sangrias and mojitos were terrible . The food was equally a big let down as they were not not even able to serve decent momos and there were huge time gaps in waiting for an item to be delivered to our table. It is expensive for such a sub par restaurant.

The veg platter was also good.

Food isn't good at all. And the prices will give you a heart attack in comparison with the quality they serve. A plate of Crispy Chilly Mushroom or Stir Fried Vegetables should cost 275 bucks plus 27% tax plus 15% VAT only if it is of great great taste but alas, the food quality is not even good here. Ambiance is great. Decor is super. Rooftop is fine.

Been to this place a week back. Its one of the happening places in kolkata for young people like us. Hookah lovers delite! And also you get alcohol at reasonable rate. We four friends went for trying this place. The outdoor sitting is its main attraction, plus that day there was a thunderstorm. So our visit was memorable on that day. Beer, hookah, friends and awesome weather what else you need! We ordered baby corn and chicken drumstick. Food was average. The best thing about ud is its ambience. For best evenings with your gang in a posh area you should definitely visit 9f.

One of the shittist place I have been to. They misguide the customers. They show the offers on the zomato menu and when you call them before coming they say that all offers that are on zomato are valid but when you actually visit the place they say that the offers aren't there. 
Very disappointed . You do anything but you can't misguide your customers by false advertisement.

Its been a long tym UD stands out to be one of the few happening lounges in town, i simple love to spend breezy evenings in the open air section listening to peppy numbers and sipping on some vodka or beer.. chitchating.. gossiping .. with a round of seesha and getting a look around of the citylights of kolkata . Its also a great place for special dates or just a friendly hangout on sessions of pool playing . And this time along with drinks, i had their food as well as i could redeem a gift voucher from zomato (thanks for that). We tried a portion of CHICKEN PAN FRIED NOODLES and CHICKEN SUI MAI dimsum and both the dishes were pretty good with overpriced tags with them. Many of the dimsums in the menu were not available. Moreover They took pretty a long time for serving but were courteous enough to manage it. The dimsum went nicely with the spicy red dip and the noodles was a gravyish thing with ample lot of veggies and chicken which impressed us on the whole.

You know how it feels to sit at a lounge on the 9th floor and enjoy the cool breeze at night? If not, this is THE place to be. Good food, good service and excellent ambiance - this place has it all. The interiors look splendid kudos to the hanging lights. The staff is very friendly, who would advice you on what you should take and not. The baby corn and the strawberry iced tea is a must try for new comers. Live sports screening just by the bar in addition to the loud music blaring remixed tracks of popular songs, you are bound to have a great time. You can visit the balcony and enjoy the weather and brilliant view at night. Also, a game of pool for a 100 rupees only! Standard pocket pinch for three would be 1k.
Keep up the excellent service. Coming here again and again.

Located in camac street. It's on the 9th floor. It has 2 sections, one on the outside where you can enjoy the cool evening breeze and other inside. This place does not have much of an ambience. Though it has a bar,  the drinks not good as well. The food on the other hand is average. The Sheesha we ordered was good. This place also has a pool table. The pricing here is quite high. Not highly recommended.

Had a zomato voucher for this place, and finally went there yesterday with a friend. There's just one sign with the name at the entrance, but that isn't too prominent, so we had to ask people to finally locate the entrance. The lift took us to the 9th floor, and we finally entered our destination. 

We chose to sit in the open air area, and it felt so so relaxing to sit atop 9 stories and watch the tiny cars moving around, below. The winds brushing our faces took away the weekday after work stress in no time. 

We had a strawberry iced tea, a mojito and their Chinese combo platter. The food and beverages were good, specially the drumsticks. And also, I was extremely hungry. 

The staff was courteous, and service was swift. 

Had a really good time here. Will go back to this place soon enough.

Just one advice, there should be some sort of prominent branding or glow sign at the front of the building.

P.S. There's a pool table too.

First things first, my mood went off completely because of the ambience. Had certain expectations of the place but not really up to the mark. The day we went, I don't know what was wrong with their service they didn't have anything other than tandoori food. So anything other than chicken reshmi kebabs or fish tikka or such similar things weren't available. We wanted to have sizzlers but, well, they didn't have that.
They didn't even have much good stock of alcohol. They only had breezers and rum and a few fancy drinks which weren't even that great.
I personally didn't have a great experience of the place. Bad music, poor service, not so great ambience and not that great on the pocket as well. So, won't really recommend it.

Finally managed to visit this place. Situated on 9th floor of Fort Knox building, the ride on the lift is bumpy and the entry to the lift was smelly. Although this has nothing to do with the restaurant but it is a bit put off. 
Coming to the lounge it is a dim light place which gives a soothing and cooling atmosphere. The big windows overseeing the skyline gives a lovely feeling. I sat inside only so cannot comment on the outside seating arrangement. The lounge is undergoing renovation. It is sprawled across a huge area. A room is dedicated to playing pool. 
The main and only reason for giving 3.5 and not 4 is because of the pricing. Although I had a voucher courtesy zomato from a foodie meet but food is on the higher side and it was evident from other people having just having hookahs minus any food. A plate of veg pasta costs 350 + 20% taxes = rs420 is on the steep side. The quantity is sufficient for 2 if both are not hungry that is. 
Coming to the taste. Awesome. Rightly seasoned with fresh vegetables used and pasta cooked to perfection with a well balanced creamy sauce. Nothing else could have been tweaked to the dish.
Another major flaw was the fact the server did not offer or ask whether we would like some water. This is the bare minimum that should be followed to the T.

A place of disappointments!!! ALWAYS!!!

This is perhaps the 4th time i am visiting this place but 1st after they have totally revamped the interiors and the space. To be honest, the previous setup was way better with the open air arrangement and the placement of tables and couches thereby they have totally killed the vibe which was the only thing this place had to offer. The new one has a chic look with fancy lamps and colourful furnitures and wall arts.

Now coming to the long list of disappointments
** Never heard of a place which doesn't serve beers inclusive happy hours and to my surprise the drinks which are included in the happy hour menu are only the premium ones like Chivas Regal. Totally evident that the happy hour is just a ploy to attract customers and rob them once they enter.

** Such a huge setup but only 2 pages inside their almost 10 page of menu is available. YES you have read it right. 80% of the menu is not available as their cook is not available. Just UNBELIEVABLE. Speaks a lot about their professionalism.

** Small cockroach was found hanging around our table. Again speaks a lot about their hygiene.

** Ordered for a portion of Fish Tikka. Once you break the fish with your cutlery you can realise how poor the quality of the fish is. Lot on the harder side.

The main problem with this place is their crowd. Mainly school and college goers who comes here just to have hookah. They desperately lack the crowd which i feel have resulted in them lacking the desire to improve their standards as i have been experiencing this for the last 5 years since my first visit.

Since Zomato doesn't allow us to rate any restaurant lower than 1, i couldn't rate them 0 which is exactly the number they deserve.

Shame on you Urban Dezi Management. Stop Cheating!!
And yes THANK YOU for ruining my evening.

Went to Urban Desi 9F last Saturday with a group of friends. The place has been there for a long time but just got renovated from UD to 9F.
Food and music is good, hookah is good too (that too with 1+1 free). However the place overall looked sad as very very limited people were there, especially considering it to be a Saturday evening/night. The highlight was the live screening of sports along with upbeat music. The staffs were very friendly. Overall a one time visit.

I celebrated my birthday party here, me and my friends went for dinner. The food and staff were ok, but i really did enjoy there because music was really good. Its ambience was also good, but its not a place to have dinner with children because its filled with the smoke of hookas, and if you dont like hooka it will be very difficult to cope up with the smell. The washrooms are very good, in terms of sanitation and humour, oh yes i just love the innovative way of trying to keep the washrooms clean. Overall i liked the place and enjoyed my party a lot.

Just like their own balcony where you can smoke a cigarette or your favorite Shisha over a drink.  Though their food is nothing great their staffs are pretty attentive but slow. Shishas are pretty decent but fairly overpriced. So it's either you have a party booking and pre-decided menu or you visit during their happy hours that is if you don't want a big hole in your pocket.

The hookah was good. They did not have a wide range of alcoholic drinks.. food was not that bad either.. The best part of the place was the staff, the ambiance and the music. #worth a second visit.

The 4.0 rating is only for the ambiance and the great hookah! We sat in the rooftop area and the blue lights were lovely. We ordered two hookahs- Desert Storm and Girls' Night Out. The Girls' Night Out was a perfect light-flavoured hookah. The mocktails were good. The cocktail (Sex on the Beach) was overpriced and they simply gave a small glass with no presentation at all! The food quality is average except the crispy chilly babycorn.

A really nice place to hangout with friends. The rooftop view is really nice. The music, the DJ, the ambiance sets your mood right. The food quality overall is okayish. I liked the Tandoori starters better compared to the Chinese ones. Their happy hour was there till 9 PM which was good. Overall a kool nice place to hangout with friends with high on music.

The best thing about this place is the location. The view is quite nice considering its on the 9th floor as far as I remember.. the bar setup is really beautiful. There is also a separate place to play pool. 
Food is costly but good. Drinks that are usually not available elsewhere, you can get it here. :)

One of the most overpriced overrated places in kolkata!!! The sheesha was horrible after5 requests and trials we dd not get a sheesha we were given the bill even though the product was crap!!! Later we were given a replacement sheesha but we had to pay for the oter sheesha as well... We ended up paying 1400 bucks for shitty hookah which had half a coal so that u pay more for coal changes!!! Mood and evening well spoilt!!! Definitely my last visit!!!

The ambience was awesome really amazing music and chilled beers, but when it came to fooding it was not upto the mark. It was way below expectation, we have ordered noodles and Manchurian that was average and ordered a starter kebab kofta with corn which was not good at all. Crowd is decent.

Have been to Urban Dezi four times and this place has never gone wrong. Located very close to my office on the Camac Street on the 9th floor of Fort Knox (near Hotel Senator), this place is a delight in terms of the feel - lights are cheerful, music is awesome, crowd is good. There is a wide variety of cocktails and the usual stuff is there as well. We had dinner there once, too, and was pleasantly surprised to find it just too good to be true - chinese fried rice and some cantonese vegetables. It was like any other good Chinese places in town. Apart from the pukishly colored menus, everything is alright including the staff and prices.

A group of 40+ reached the place on a Friday night. Since we had booked this place, we had the dance floor all for ourselves. As soon as we entered, we hit the floor from the word go. The DJ was very good and played some good numbers and even accepted some of our requests. The service was good and they kept on bringing starters even before we had to ask for any. The range of spirits was good and kept everybody high. The ambiance of the place is something they need to work on as it does not make it stand.¬†

With regards to the food, we had a buffet service where they served a main course containing a bread basket, zeera rice, chicken lababdar, shahi paneer, dal makhani. In deserts we had brownie and ice creams. The staff was good and ensured that everyone is well fed and considered our request for minor changes.¬†

All in all, a good place to go if you are going with such a big crowd. Would have to go on a less controlled setting to judge as to what kind of crowd normally haunts this place on a normal weekend night.

Location- fort knox building in camac street on the 9th floor as the name suggests.

I have been here multiple times and if you want a chilled out ambiance with good food, alcohol and hubbly bubbly you must give this one a go.

We went here during there happy hours but i guess still you would put the place in the expensive bracket.

We ordered for whiskey and hookah to begin with and then i ordered for their pan fried chilly fish and salt and pepper chicken. The chicken was decent but the fist was really out of the world. So much so that i had to order another one even though we were full. 

The service was a tad on the slower side but that is alright given that the place was completely packed.

We went around 5.30 and I felt that this place is an average one but as soon as afternoon changed to evening everything was awesome. The couches are very comfortable and the music they play is also nice. The service is good and people are very well aware and behaved. We are not that much into hookah so we ordered beer and a side dish. The chicken side dish was good. I also ordered a shot of absinthe and it was a good experience. I liked the small details. The open rooftop is awesome too. I wanted to take lots of pictures but forgot. .

Nice place to hangout with friends. The ambiance is very nice, the quality and taste of food is also very good. The decoration is very nice and with the lights on in the evening it looks really fantastic. As it is in the 9th floor, so the outside view is also nice. One negative point is that if you go there with 4-6 people and you want to seat together then I think that would be little uncomfortable. There is a very long range of drinks to choose and in every category they have many drinks. The hookah is also very good and they got many options for that also. The outdoor seating is very nice. As I said earlier it's in the 9th floor so you can enjoy a nice view in the outdoor smoking area with your smoke or drink and also the chilling breeze feels fantastic. A nice place to spend your afternoon and evening.

No doubt that this place is very good when it comes to ambience and overall decor but it's main drawback is its high priced menu for both good and drinks. The happy hour scheme is just bullshit as there are no options for any beer or rum. The sheesha is not bad but the food items are rated exorbitantly.

Been at 9F for a friend's party..The ambiance looked awesome and so did the menu.
The total turnoff was the sluggish service and the waiters who had no idea about any product. ..Had to return the Caprioska 3 times. Even though it was a weekday, the service was damn slow with no apologies whatsoever...

The best part about the place was the DJ who played really awesome tracks and the hookah!!¬† hopefully the management takes note of the shortcomings and improves them. Looking forward to visiting the place again!

Urban dezi 9F camac street, situated at 9 th floor(hence 9F) of Fort Knox, is the place were we landed up last weekend. Special mention is required for the ambience, which is quite lively.. There's live DJ available, and not to forget a giant projector (which was showing IPL at that time) The food was equally good but a tad bit costly..  We ordered pepper fish, tangri kabab and kabab platter, all of which were quite appetizing.. Sheesha was also good.. Beer pints are actually more economic, than beer tower, which was quite abnormal.. I would definitely recommend it to all..

Been at 9F for a friend's party..The ambiance looked awesome and so did the menu.
The total turnoff was the sluggish service and the waiters who had no idea about any product. ..Had to return the Caprioska 3 times. Even though it was a weekday, the service was damn slow with no apologies whatsoever...

The best part about the place was the DJ who played really awesome tracks and the hookah!!¬† hopefully the management takes note of the shortcomings and improves them. Looking forward to visiting the place again!

Urban dezi 9F camac street, situated at 9 th floor(hence 9F) of Fort Knox, is the place were we landed up last weekend. Special mention is required for the ambience, which is quite lively.. There's live DJ available, and not to forget a giant projector (which was showing IPL at that time) The food was equally good but a tad bit costly..  We ordered pepper fish, tangri kabab and kabab platter, all of which were quite appetizing.. Sheesha was also good.. Beer pints are actually more economic, than beer tower, which was quite abnormal.. I would definitely recommend it to all..

Urban Desi offers you an awesome ambience to unwind and relax. The food preparations are quite sumptuous specially bhetki preparation. Hookah served to be an added intoxicant which was mind blowing. Special credit to my buddy who proposed to have the hookah. Excepting slow delivery of foods the place offers you the best value for money. I strongly recommend others to have a taste of this place.

Absinthe, an item I've found out is not available in many bars, pubs and nightclubs is available! 
Lack of a good skyline is a bummer. But it can be a good place to hang out/ kill time. 
A game of 8 ball can be enjoyed with your friends. It's a good place to unwind.

Perfect place for a date. The lights are dimmed. The hookah is amazing here. Never mind for the food, but the ambience is excellent. People with heavy pockets can enjoy. A hookah, 2 appetizers and 3 beers could cost you above 3k. A must visit to this place. Your date will love it. Trust me.

Hard day followed by a cool evening. This place is ideal for you to just unwind and relax.¬†

The best part is that it is located on top of Fort Knox, hence it is wonderful on a windy evening if you are sitting outside.

But their Indian selections are better.

My friends surprised me by organising my 18th bday over here. Located at Fort Knox, this is a huge place with indoor as well as outdoor seating. On a pleasant winter evening, the outdoor seating has its own charm.
The staff was a little disappointing, i had to remind them 4 times to get the cake cut and serve it.
We didn't order much in food. But the Diced chilli chicken was quite delicious. And the quantity was also very good. 
Babycorn was good too. But I've had better at other places.
A nice venue to spend out your evening. Pretty relaxed atmosphere.

Urban Desi is my second favourite place to chill in the city, first being Biker's ofcourse. And when I am in a mood for loud music, this is it. I have been visiting it for so long but never got to write about it.
Location: The fort knox building in camac street, 9th floor. 
Ambiance: It's everything that you would ever want from a lounge. It's just the right kind of beautiful. 
Food: I love the white sauce pasta here. And I hate the American corn. Besides that, everything that I have ever had here is good. More than good if you ask me. 
Hookah: Honestly, I am no expert in hookah, but it's good. 
Areas of improvement: They could make the service a little faster. They take almost 10 mins to get the bill, every time! Also, the cocktails are a bit too pricy, considering I have had better cocktails in similar places which were cheaper that what they have priced here.

I don't mind saying that it is my favorite place in the city till date. The first place I take all my guests to.
I love eveeything about it.Be it the open view of the entire city, the Arabic lanterns hanging from the roof, the ever playing good music or the delicious food :) its all good.
The service is really nice. They will help you with anything and everything till you are their guests.
Food menu is extensive with a good variety for vegetarians as well. And the food is amazing I must say.
Coming to hookah, the quality is very nice and its smooth.
If I had to critically analyze the place then the price range for food items being a bit high would be my one and only complaint.
Do visit the place once, you'd love it :)

This place was in my bookmark list for so long but somehow i could not go there. Finally i got a chance to visit this place on sunday (4th jan) with my friend. This place is located in camac street in fort knox building which is easily located and is one of the best place to be. It serves chinese (mainly) some tandoor items and pasta ( m not entirely sure). We ordered virgin mojito which was a perfect blend of tangy and sweet with the right amount of mint leaves which leaves a tingling taste in your mouth which entirely gives a good feeling as it refreshes you. For the main course we ordered mix sauce spaghetti which was one of the best i have ever had. It was just perfectly made with the right amount of chilli and the spagetti had the right amount of sauce so it was not very dry or full of gravy and the best thing that i liked was it has loads of veggies like babycorn, zucchini, bell peppers, brocolli which is not found in any of the places nowadays. Next we ordered chinese combo which had a portion of babycorn with fried rice ( you have a choice of ordering hakka chow with it) and veggies prepared in chilli basil sauce. The babycorn was crispy with the right flavours, rice had a lot of veggies including corn which my friend dint prefer but i liked it and the veggies were just amazing. The staff here was very courteous and well behaved.
Had an amazing time there
Looking forward to spending more such time.
A highly recommended place to go.

We got a shisha free with one..the hookah was really smooth with dense smoke..among the drinks were tequila sunrise,strawberry delight,fresh orange juice and tequila oranzilla..
The food served was yummy..we had ordered a hot garlic noodles,pan fried chilli fish and a crispy chilli tossed in garlic sauce..everything was simply great about the place..plan to visit it soon again..a wonderful experience..:)

I had been courting this place for long and finally decided to visit it today..It serves hukkah,alcoholic/non alcoholic beverages as well as different cuisines like Indian ,Chinese ,Italian.The place has a casual yet chic and smart feel to it,very tastefully done up.They also have outdoor seating with a nice view of the street,good for enjoying the weather :) ,very few places have it in Kolkata. This is the first review in which I am compelled to give 4.5 stars because I just cudnt find any real faults with this place !
We had ordered a mixed sauce pasta,a veg chinese combo and a Virgin Mojito.
1)The pasta had just the perfect amout of spices and was neither too spicy nor on the bland side.There are very few places in Kolkata which make such mixed sauce ! Also the pasta had ample amout of sauce so that it wasnt dry.It also had a good amount of vegetables,rarely provided elsewhere.Overall,amazing.

2)The Veg Chinese Combo had Crispy Chilly Babycorn,Vegetables in Chilli Basil sauce and vegetable Fried Rice.
The crispy chilly babycorn was perfectly crisp and the flavour was just right.Again not too spicy nor sweet.

The vegetables were served in a separate bowl.It had babycorn,brocholli,bell peppers and zuccini .I loved the sauce,it was going very well with the fried rice.

Coming to the fried rice,I would say the it had a light flavour but the addition of corn ruined it slightly as I do not think corn goes well with fried rice.Maybe,you will like it as my friend did not mind the corn.It wasnt bad.

3)And the virgin Mojito was also nice..it had that tangy taste with the sweetness and mint kicking in at the end.

The service was also very quick and prompt.So overall,I just loved everything from service to food.
Highly Recommended !

Ambience: Cosy seats, classy decor, loud music, live matches¬†on LCDs, snooker table, colourful lighting effects, lamps of all kinds... Hanging lamps with bulbs, table lamps with fire, torches by the balcony... You name it you have it. Plus there are both A/C and open air balcony sections. The view from the balcony is beautiful. It has the perfect ambience for a romantic date or a clubbing night with a group of friends. I rate it 4.5/5.

Food & Drinks: This is not one of its attractions. Quantity is fairly less and quality is good but not out of the world. They do however, keep a good number of cuisines. Drinks are interesting. It offers a wide variety of liquors. Hookahs are what it is mainly famous for. I rate it 3.5/5.

Service: Food takes forever to arrive. Drinks and hookahs arrive fast. Staff is well-behaved and attentive. I rate 3.5/5.

Price: It used to be fairly affordable long back but recently after the place got renovated, the prices have shot up like crazy. Food is extremely costly over here. Only certain platters and combos are considerably reasonably priced. Drinks range from slightly affordable to costly. Hookahs are the best buys.

Overall I rate it 3.5/5.

Well this place is located at the ninth floor of fort NOx at camac street.
Very easily reachable.and makes a good place for people to catch up in a centralized location.
I have been here earlier and the entire decor has been changed. Though the new one is good too. Yet the previous one offered almost more outdoors seatings which I loved. The new decor is playful with lights and very nice.
There is a game of pool too which u can go with your friends.nice option.
There is happy hours from 3-7pm on very limited drinks.so you can definitely go for that. My friends who are hookah lovers vouch that thus place has good hookah. So not based on my opinion but I can assure theirs.;)
Fooood. That's the main thing. A must must try crispy chilly paneer. Simply amazing. Wow a pleasure to taste buds.awesome. seriously.crispy outside soft pander inside. Bang on chilly.couldn't be better.
We ordered an oriental combo.I guess don't remember the name. It had noodles ,exotic veggies in sauce and crispy babycorn.well babycorn was very soggy. Was surprised when it had the paneer beside it to compete. Noodles and gravy were quite good.
Definitely a good place to go. But the music is extremely loud. Yet they play a good collection of songs.so not much to complaint.
Do go and thank me too:):)

Superb place to hang out :)

One of my friends wanted to have drinks and others including me wanted to have hookah, so we decided to visit d place.

Located on d 9th floor, the place has ample space with a part of it with open terrace area.
The music was good and high sitting bar seats were quite enjoyable. :))

We ordered 2 pints of beer ( buy 2 get 1 free) and a brain freezer hookah. 
The hookah had some issues and d staff immediately replaced d same. The hookah was smooth and I enjoyed d same a lot.
The italian menu served here is awesome and delicious. 
The service was prompt, pricing is ok and ambience was kool.
Will love to visit d place again.

lets cut to the chase. UD is good for three things
drinks hookah and open air sitting. if u order food better take a nap before it arrives at point we were wondering if they r buying the stuff from market and then making it . price is stiff but its expected. if u don want to pay much for food then its no point goin there cause its one of those places which wil burn a hole in ur pockets. but after a few times u wont mind the price. for us its mostly beer and hookah and cigarettes . also its a not so well known p*** *p point

Situated at one of the most happening areas of the city camac street-park street belt, Urban Desi adds to the ever growing cool places to hang out in the belt. The ambience here is great. The view from 9th floor is mesmerizing and you can be glued to the view while recumbent on ultra comfy couches or sofas as one might say. one can even opt for ¬†wooden chair and tables in case you go out with a large group. one an even sit in the open , away from the ac and close to the nature with your drink or/and hookah, adding to it's list of things that sets it apart from other pubs. prices are decent and food is delicious. happy hours can really make you happy here. i simply love this place. service is great. one also gets to play snooker. they got two huge screens during IPL and one can have a nice time in the real sense. a must visit.

If you are looking for a decent place just to hang out with friends, loved ones... this is the best place for you! Have been there with someone special and it had been an awesome experience. Happy hours runs till 9:PM(no idea what time it starts) every weekday. It have a open space as well. Nice sound systems and DJ(don remember the name though) played some good electronic music too! 
cons: I felt charge for pool table was over the top and the service was slow and moderate.

I simply LOVE this place !!! Nothing at all makes me happier than this place. 
I loved even more , before they decided to change the setup but well ! It's UD which I still love. 
Whenever I go, I choose to sit in the open air sitting cus what's the point of UD without the open air setting ? :P 
I was here yesterday again with a friend and I noticed I hadn't written a review on it. Anyways , I have a strict hookah flavour for this place and wine is a must here !! 
Hookah - we ordered the beer base paan flavoured hookah. Which was good ! 
Red wine - ummm ... What can I say about red wine ? It's red wine ! Which is AMAZING !! 
And the chilly and sweet crispy chicken 
Chicken - this was really well cooked , but was a bit too spicy for my taste. However it was well cooked hence we finished it all ! The bill was around 3000 which is legit.

Bedazzling. That's one word to describe this particular venue. Easily one of my few favorite places in Kolkata. Must, must, MUST visit. Situated in a posh area of the city, the view from the lounge itself will mesmerize you. The decor is soothing to the eye, very original.
The food is good, I can't say much since I've mostly visited for booze and hookah. Though the menu is elaborate. The bar will instantly put a smile on your face, and later the other tipsy kind. ;) The staff is very polite and welcoming. No room for complaint there.
Also, you'd want to dutch the expense or its surely to burn a hole in your pocket.

P.S. Ask the staff if the outdoor seating is available, if you're visiting on a pleasant day. Cheers. :)

This place has very nice loaction & view. inside seating arrangement is also cool.
But bar sucks big time & this guy charged me like 1000 bucks for worst LIIT of my life.
So go there only if you have no where else to go.

Well, my experience of the cool and urbane Kolkata would have been incomplete, had I not visited this place. The panoramic view of the city skyline can be best enjoyed here, while you engage yourself with friends over hookah, delicious food and beverages. The view sets up the ambience, and to add to it, the service is top notch. The waiters actually go out of their way to serve customers, and in my experience, it was quite extraordinary. I wish I had gone there earlier, more so because I never got to sit in the awesome open tent that they once had.

First time i went there with my college buddies..
the place is very nicely decorated 
it gives out a proper lounge feel
we ordered a few shots and a tower of beer
and a few sides
as the beer was taking some time we added two hookahs along with the order
my friends were all herbivores so inspite of being a hardcore carnivore had to tag along with them on the sides..... which was pretty decent.
over all great hangout.

I used to be regular to this place when it was urban desi and after it turned into 9F I have just been here twice! Both the times my experience was fairly good :) the interiors is normal and dint attract me much! the crowd is good and clean! hookah is nice too :) the service is ok but needs improvement. I remember having the cheese cigar and herb fried chicken and both the items were good!

Food at urban dezi was average at its best, except the gravy which was good. However the most disappointing of the experience was the service which was very bad to say the2 least. Basics like water were bot serviced to at all

The ambience was lovely with white cane chairs and bar stool kind of arrangements, but the setaing could have been more comfortable, anyway it looked pretty, clean and a ncie place. I was taking my friend who was down for work out for relaxing dinner and drinks in a casual ambience. So far everything seemed to be good. 

We sat and ordered our set of drinks and starters.Grey Goose for me and the guys decided to do a beer tower, sadly they did not have anything other than Carlsberg, which is what they settled for.I ordered Chilli Babycorn and Nachos for starters. The quantity was a lot but the Crispy Babycorn was a tad bit too sweet and the flavour had not seeped into it.The nachos were ok but a cheese dip would have offset the sweet tomato flavour, which they did not have and offered us cheese instead, clearly not understanding that we wanted a cheese dip. When it came to ordering the second round of drinks, there was no beer tower and my friends were disappointed- the reason they gave us was they did not have large bottles, so they could not offer us pint either. I ordered an Absolute Citron and after 5 repeated failed communication attempts could they understand the drink I wanted.

We ordered pasta with white sauce and vegetables for main course since none of us were too hungry and that was quite good minus the fact it did not have the right amount of salt in it.We kept ggoing out for fresh air and chats because we met after a long gap of a few years , so obviously our food was left unattended. Here comes the bizarre part of the experience which left a bad taste. The waiter came out with the bill and told us that cash was closing, he went in and came back in two minutes to tell us the same thing. We told him we would head inside and finish our food and then clear the bill. While we were seated inside the waiter came around 3 times and shuffled the table and the menu atleast three to four times and it was quite apparent they wanted us to pay and get out or leave.It was so rude, so disgusting and because we were civil we decided not to make a noise and spoil our evening. We however did not tip much which we normally do when we are satisfied with the service. The behaviour was absolutely rude and uncalled for and kind of a dampener.

Just walked out of this awful establishment. Three out of five imported beers listed in their menu weren't available, including the one advertised for happy hours. Served us flat, not-so-cold Hoegaarden (after we sent back the first warm batch). They didn't even have cold water. Asked for the bill in frustration, and immediately got the bill (unsurprisingly, going by the behaviour of the serving staff). This was   my first and last time here.

Hookah, a pint of beer, good music n snooker!! What more one can ask for? Urban dezi has more to offer.. this roof top joint delivers the best. I hv been there a number of times with my friends and it never fails to satisfy us. Food is good. The ambience jus perfect to relax n hangout.

Had heard mixed reviews about this place from various sources, finally thought of trying this lounge once. It was a bit difficult to locate at first as our cab driver was not aware about the FORT KNOX mall. So we had to use the Google MAPS option to reach UD. Had reached at around 8.30 pm. Being a weekday only 2 tables were occupied when 2 of us reached. We were comfortably seated in the couches. We were given the menu right after we were seated but after that every time we had to call the waiter more than twice for him to come to our table and attend to us. Food was served within a decent time frame, but these guys were very slow in providing service. It was as if they were not too keen to serve the customers well. Food quality & quantity both was ok, nothing extra-ordinary but at the same time not bad also. Our total bill was 4018 for 2, which I feel was very high, I mean not that great a place to visit quite frequently and spend this much amount of money. We had ordered the following:
Cocktails: Coconut Daiquiri, Perfect Martini & Tequila Sunrise
Shooters: Kamakazi
Starters: Diced Chicken with Assorted Pepper & Ginger
Main Course: We had ordered one penne pasta (white sauce) and another preparation of chicken(dont remember the name)
Along with all these, we tried the Hookah too, which was good.

I have visited this place quite a number of times both before and after the revamp....The decor is really nice..
The food and drinks are also quite good. I ordered Hariyali fish tikka and Mixed combo platter on 2 different occasions...Both were good.. the fish and prawn in the combo platter was nicely done and had a different flavour in it, but the rice served with it was a little hard...
All in all it is a nice place to hang out with friends...

Urban Dezi- Probably one of the best places to chill.
==============================================
Intro:

I don't know why they have changed the name from Urban Desi to Urban Dezi. Secondly, i don't know why all my reviews and other reviews have been erased. I had been here quite number of times with many of my friends. One of my best friend had celebrated his birthday party too here. The ambience was previously divided into two parts out of which, one was more like a cubicle style which can now be seen at London Street - not ditto same but similar. Sheesha lovers prefer to go to this place. Now this place has an outdoor environment, side seats to enjoy the city streets view and the usual sofa's to chill around inside the restaurant. It is a separate place in Noon and separate place at Night.

It has always been my favorite places to chill.
==============================================
Food Ordered and Hookah:

1) Crispy Chilli BabyCorn - Tastes really good. More like Bar b q type of Babycorn. Crispy n sweet.

2) Chilli Paneer - It was amazing. Vegetarian's a must try.

3) - It was too good.

4) Veg Hakka noodles - It was good.

5) Veg Fried Rice - It was excellent too.

6) Schezwan Chicken With Chilli's - It was amazing as a starter. Must try.

7) Darsaan - It was sticking. But yet, amazing. I like the Darsaan more at Hong Kong Express.

8) Hookah is pretty decent out here. Probably, few years passed by and still they are managing the great hookah.

==============================================
Summary:

Food presentation 4/5
Ambience 5/5
Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4/5
Hospitality 3.5/5
Taste 4/5
Value for Money 4/5
==============================================
Conclusion:

I would love to visit it again and again. I love this place way too much and one of my favorite Hookah places. The pictures are taken like few months back. :)

I been to this place on a Sunday night. Heard alot about this and recommended by my friends, it has a good ambience and the menu is a lil over priced.

The hookah served was really great and the staff were very generous.

A relatively new place which was made after urban desi was closed for renovation,this place is an example to follow when it comes to good interiors and lighting. The place has a red theme to it,and is designed very classily. The place gets converted to a dance floor in the weekends. Very thoughtfully made.
It is veryyy overpriced and quantity served also isn't too great. Hence,it loses out on the ratings. But apart from that,if you dont care about the pocket pinch,its worth a visit.
The american corn pepper is good,the baby corn is properly fried and the spinach cheese rolls,though very less in quantity for its price, is average. 
Ive been there thrice and their tandoor wasnt working once,and that was disappointing as I love their paneer tikka.

The inside ambiance is good enough, but food and alcohol is costly according to the place... behavior of managers are very bad, I mean rude..., they harass customers without any offense, you cant do much activity but only sitting at your place and taking your drinks and foods whatever. Not much space there... bit congested type ... service is average ...I reapeat conduct of staffs are very very poor. The floor manager's behavior is insulting and very pathetic. There are lots of good and fine place in Kolkata, so avoid the place, I would never go there again
