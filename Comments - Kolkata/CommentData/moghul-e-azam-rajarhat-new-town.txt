I have seen RATS playing around. It smells awful inside. Spoons and Plates are greasy and sticky and you may well see the last person's (who used that) face stuck in the grease......¬†

Otherwise it is beautiful, CREDIT goes to the outer ambience of Eco Park, NOT this restaurant.

I have visited this place a few number of times and have enjoyed my visit everytime.
Located a little straight from eco park, this place is nice and has a cool decor.
The staff are very polite and they even allowed us to go upstairs of the restaurant which has seating and a balcony which offers a great view of Rajarghat.
Coming to food, I have enjoyed my food everytime here and it's absolutely delicious.
I absolutely love the cave like theme and decor.
This place is a total hit.

First of all the ambiance is really good, it's like a cave. Somehow it's look like candle light dinner inside cave. Waiters are courteous. The food is awesome and the price is reasonable.. We ordered chicken hot n sour soup, chicken tandoori, butter roti with chicken bharta, chicken schezwan noodles and chicken noodles. All were tasted good and quantity were also good. We were so full that we were not able to order desert. Overall place is good with good food. One negative thing was cleanliness. But they assured that it will get done. Uploading only pic of tandoori as was busy to eat.. üòéüòé

First of all when I talk about Mughal-ish things I dont fantasize a cave.. still then the restaurant unlike its name, is built up like a cave.. and hence unlikely i liked the concept of decor too.. üòÇ But apart from that the only Mughal thing that they tried to have are the glasses shaped like the antics.. We ordered Chicken lollypop and crispy baby corn as starters. Chicken lollypop included a decent amount of chicken.. poscket friendly u can say! it tasted more like chicken druma of heaven. which i liked a lot! even crispy baby corn was crispy enough to get crunched by the teeth!
 For main course we ordered Kashmiri Pulao, Moghul-e-Azam special fried rice, Muttton Rogan-josh and Schezwan Chicken. 
Mutton Rogan-josh was cooked well enough.. we had ordered a lil spicy one! 
Moghul-e-Azam special fried rice included an egg-poach as a topping! that made me love it more..
chicken schezwan could have been better.. 
Kashmiri pulao.. as the name is.. lil sweeter.. and i like sweets! 
starters were too good.. trust me if u want a pocket friendly stuff... then u shud go.. i think its quite good, if u wanna have some 5 star experience.. like going on with decor of the cuisines or some world class experience.. then dont expect!! 
its just perfect as its price is...

Apart from this the place is good and service was nice.

Located in best part of the city upcoming and happening Rajarhat !!
Parking is no issue open area and easily available !!
Services need to be improved we ordered food and the preparing really took some time!!
I have seen some reviews on zamato of this restro!! Should say it not at all that bad !!
What is great is the ambience very much different and exciting all made with wood and nice interiors!!!
Food is good and tasty but basic limited items in menu card with nothing new in variety but still food is good i ordered starters chicken tikka it was really wow soft and tasty !!!
Soft drink quantity was also good and price was reasonable.
Main course dishes were also very good .
Quantity was nice compare to the price its not that expensive items are fairly priced!!!!
A complete family restaurant certainly recommended!!!

We had to struggle quite a lot to find this restaurant as the address given in Zomato is quite misleading..It's not on the Eco Island and neither near the 3rd gate.It's beside the tea garden,near Yule Tea Lounge.
Coming to the food,we ordered-Masala kulcha,Chicken bhartha and Mixed noodles.The kulcha was very soft and nice..and it was huge in size!One kulcha should be more than enough for a person with medium appetite.The chicken bhartha was awesome but not recommended for people who don't like spicy food.Quantity is sufficient for two.The noodles were also good..though not really great.

Ambience was nice and cave-like.But we got a much shortened menu with fewer options.Prices are reasonable and they have started charging VAT which previously I suppose they didn't.Service was not satisfactory though..staff is inattentive..and they will attend to you only after calling them several times.

It is located near the 3rd gate. One must know that its atmost at the end of the park. If you are at the 1st gate you have walk through the whole park.
Coming to ambience it was ok. Decoration was cave like. 
We ordered moghul-e-azam special biriyani, chicken dopiyaza, mutton dopiyaza and chicken malai kabab.
The biriyani is named special but don't know in what basis, just because it contains one mutton, one chicken and one egg piece!! Although the quantity was huge. Enough for 2 persons. Other dishes were tasty.

Coming to the food,we ordered-Masala kulcha,Chicken bhartha and Mixed noodles.The kulcha was very soft and nice..and it was huge in size!One kulcha should be more than enough for a person with medium appetite.The chicken bhartha was awesome but not recommended for people who don't like spicy food.Quantity is sufficient for two.The noodles were also good..though not really great.

Ambience was nice and cave-like.But we got a much shortened menu with fewer options.Prices are reasonable and they have started charging VAT which previously I suppose they didn't.Service was not satisfactory though..staff is inattentive..and they will attend to you only after calling them several times.

It is located near the 3rd gate. One must know that its atmost at the end of the park. If you are at the 1st gate you have walk through the whole park.
Coming to ambience it was ok. Decoration was cave like. 
We ordered moghul-e-azam special biriyani, chicken dopiyaza, mutton dopiyaza and chicken malai kabab.
The biriyani is named special but don't know in what basis, just because it contains one mutton, one chicken and one egg piece!! Although the quantity was huge. Enough for 2 persons. Other dishes were tasty.

The d√©cor theme of this restaurant doesn't go with the name. There's nothing Mughal-ish about this place, it's more like a cave. 
This place is very average but not a turn down. I came here for team lunch!
We ordered Kulcha, Paneer Butter Masala, Mutton, Crispy Chilli Baby corn and sweet lime soda.
The Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was Crispy though but not  chilli. The Kulcha was the best part, it was stuffed with masala and one piece is enough for two. The mutton was good but the paneer wasn't worth mentioning. 
The lime soda was a disaster. First it was salty, then adding the sugar syrup made it worst. 
This place is a good option if u are near Ecopark .
Four of us had lunch here with a pocket pinch of 1600rs. 

P.s : Missed my usual partner. :)

Been to this ppace few months back. Never thought something good can be found juat next to eco park. Inside the park food options are horrible. Cafe ekante cuts down the pocket with bad quality food in high price. So just outside of the park gate this is a very good choice for dining out. Place is quite odd so except holidays or weekends it remains empty. Not every kind of dishes one can get on weekdays as per the menu card so choice becomes limited on weekdays. We had a family outing in this place and everyone enjoyed the unique cave like ambience inside and the pool area outside for some nice photo sessions. They normally welcome every guest with a dish of masala papad which is a nice gesture to start with. Staffs are friendly but not too professional or trained. We felt with time they'll improve for sure. Food quality was upto the mark especially the kashmiri polao and the chicken dishes. Quality of tandoor roti was very good having proper softnss and baked. Overall nice experience and hope they'll improve further keeping the quality intact.

This restaurant is located besides gate 3 of eco park. It remains empty always due to its odd location but if someone manage to travel all the way upto the restaurant then he/she will not be disappointed for sure. Ambiance is excellent, its a cave themed restaurant with an open air section also. Inside the cave the dining area may be little cramped but since its never get crowded so lack of space wont be a problem. We went there for a office party and enjoyed thoroughly. Ordered chicken tangri kabab, paneer tikka, dry chili fish, masala kulcha, garlic naan, paneer do pyaza, kadhai mutton, tawa chicken kolhapuri, fresh lime soda. All the food items were truly excellent, special mention goes to chicken kolhapuri and masala kulcha. Price range is not high, very pocket friendly, only negative point is that the serving time is quite long otherwise everything is fine.

Went for a lunch party / eat-out to this place. It has an entrance from the road & not from inside ecopark.
The ambience was good..it has a cave like setup & have heard it looks much prettier in the evening :-)

Liked the food & the price was also cool. Came to around 350 per head. All food items prices had tax included..so no extra tax !! :-)

Loved the Chicken tikka butter masala & the Mutton kasa. Crispy chilly babycorn was good too! Even liked the veg (paneer do piaza)

We ordered a tandoori murg masala of 8 pieces to serve the entire team...the quantity was good.. but taste was ok (not bad not good) as compared to other dishes..

Other than this we had a great time.. there is also a pool table outside the restaurant for guests... everyone tried there hands on it... and there was our Ola to take us back to office... so we had to reluctantly get out of there :P

This restaurant is located near gate number-3 of Eco park in Rajarhat New Town Area.This is a nicely decorated restaurant with a cave theme and you will feel like entering a cave as you enter.They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements and a pool table for some
extra fun.We went to their Indoor(AC) section.They serve both North Indian and Chinese Dishes.
Staffs were very courteous and we were welcomed with a great smile and a Complementary Masala Roasted Papad.

Food Ordered : Fish Tikka Kebab,Masala Kulcha,Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Tutti Frutti

Fish tikka were¬† 6 soft,succulent pieces of fish which were properly marinated and grilled.
It was delicious.
Masala Kulcha needs a special mention because of the amount of stuffing and the softness of
the bread.It was awosome.
Chicken tikka butter masala were 6pieces of succulent kebabs cooked in a well balanced 
masala gravy.The chicken pieces were so tender that it literally melted in our mouth.
At last we wanted to try some desert,so we opted for a Tutti Frutti.It contained vanilla,strawberry and butterscotch ice cream with lots of fresh fruits,cashew nuts,raisins and topped with chocolate sauce.

This is a very good place to visit with your friends,family and loved ones.But people are still unaware of this restaurant.
Prices were very reasonable as they don't charge any additional taxes.
will definitely visit again to try their Chinese dishes.

An amazing new discovery we made today at eco park! I have been to eco park several times but never managed to find this place.
The staffs welcomed us heartily as we stepped down from our car.
Being situated at gate 3 of eco park, the restaurant has a lawn in front with free pool games for guests, the space has been utilised to every bits. The decor is quite arresting as well.
The restaurant is done like a cave, with cave like ceilings and walls, small windows to let in lights - impressive quite much
We were given complimentary papad right at the beginning.
We ordered
CHICKEN TANGRI KEBAB- 4 chicken leg pieces, soft and smoking marinated to perfection. Recommended.
MUTTON BIRIYANI- huge quantity to suffice one. Perfectly boiled aloo and a soft mutton piece. The biriyani also tasted good.
CHICKEN KASA- again so perfect. The gravy was perfectly balanced.
MASALA KULCHA- it's to drool for! So soft bread, stuffed with veggies felt like a pizza to my taste buds. One of the best kulchas I've ever had. must must must have!
CHICKEN HANDI- Four soft pieces of chicken in a delicious thick red spicy gravy. Yummy.
The staffs were friendly which adds to the positivity of my experience.
The service was a bit slow.
The food was delicious, shall come back fir their kulcha again and again.
The menu needs to be more lucid and must be expanded.
Keep up the good service :)

It was Bijoya Dashami (Dusshera) and we decided to give the Eco Tourism park in New Town a visit since we'd gotten tired of pandal hopping during the last couple of days. The heat got to us as soon as we entered at around 2 pm and we decided to head straight to the nearest restaurant for lunch. And my wasn't this a pleasant surprise! Although there's nothing extraordinary decor wise (cave themed), the food served was out of the world according to me. When I say food, it means typical North Indian Naan, chicken curry, jeera rice and daal. The quality and taste of the food was commendable and the service was good enough to leave us awestruck. Recommend this to everyone who gives either the Eco park or the Mother's Wax Museum a visit, or anyone who just happens to visit near there. A very generous 4 star for this place, although there are a lot of other things to improve on barring food.

If judging solely on the basis of service quality and decor, Mughal E Azam deserves a solid 4.5 star rating. From the guards outside to the waiters everyone greeted us with a pleasant smile. The frequent enquiries about the food quality also revealed their eager-to-please nature. The restaurant has a cave theme going on. Artificial stalactites were randomly jutting down from the ceiling and the windows were oddly shaped. The overall decor looked refreshingly new. To start with we ordered Fish Finger and 2 mocktails (Mango Cola and Black Beauty). The fish finger was really good and you could tell the fish was fresh. The drinks were somewhat disappointing as they looked identical and were too sweet for our taste. For main course we ordered Mutton Hyderabadi Biriyani and Mutton Rezala. First off, what they served as Hyderabadi Biriyani was actually Kolkata Biriyani with coriander puree. Unlike the true Hyderabadi version, the biriyanis also came with giant potato pieces... Unfortunately, things didn't get better. The rezala had a faint smell of burnt milk and was too thick. It tasted nothing like the authentic rezalas served in places like Shiraz, Aminia, or Arsalan. ¬†Food wise Mughal E Azam needs to improve a lot and they need to do it right away. Mainly because the entire Newtown area is peppered with good restaurants and the competition is fierce. To sum up, their food is mediocre but they almost make up for it with their heartwarming service. ¬†I would definitely consider visiting again.

I think this place is lil underrated and it offers more than just food.

Well the food is quite good if u consider the price again which is quite reasonable.
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup, Garlic naan, masala kulcha and kadai mutton. Mutton dish was great. Good succulent pieces of mutton. Naan and kulcha was just about okay.
Best part for my liking is if u lunch or dine here u can play pool for free ! The outdoor seating is also nice so is the decor indoors.
Well this may not be the place which will leave you awestruck but hey its a bang for buck place !

Like i had some work in eco tourism park and for lunch me wid my clients dropped by had a good lunch and enjoyed ourselves to 3-4 frames of pool before resuming work. ! ;)
If u r in that area.. U can pay a visit IMO.

Well, not many people know about this place, but this place surely can make its listing in 'Hidden Gem' category. Located near gate no 3 of Eco Park. If you are planning to visit this place, you have to take the service road from Gate no 1 of Eco Park, because theres no division in between. Easy parking availabe. As you reach here, you are being welcomed by two royal guards standing outside. I noticed theres a beautiful arrangement of outside seating also, but I preferred sitting inside.

As you enter, you feel like entering a cave. Because the restaurant is made in cave theme. The ambiance is very nice. It has live screening too. I preferred to sit upstairs, which seemed very appealing to me and I wasn't disappointed. The upstairs is indeed cosy and peaceful. The interior decor is very nicely done. Starting to the spoons and forks to the washbasins and the tap, everything is matched according to the theme.¬†

Wide range of North Indian and Chinese cuisines to chose from. I ordered Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Kasha and Masala Kulcha. The tandoori chicken deserves special mention. I never had such good and fresh tandoori chicken anywhere in town which I found here. The freshness of the chicken, you literally can feel with every bite. And the tandoori marination was so good. Neither too much masala nor too less. The proportion was just perfect. The rest of the food was very nice. Their quality of foods really deserves special mention. Its extra ordinary.¬†
There is also a type of BEER available here which is Non Alcoholic. Ask the boys there.
The service of the boys are very nice. Serving time is quick enough.¬†

There was a dessert named "Tuti Fruti". It is basically fruits with ice cream. Tastes amazing and a MUST TRY. It has some really good looks. Picture attached.¬†

P.S. If you are visiting here, please visit to the balcony upstairs. It gives you an amazing view of the Eco Park. Nice place to be when you are waiting for your food.
