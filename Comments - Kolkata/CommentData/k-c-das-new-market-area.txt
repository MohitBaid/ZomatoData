Heard lot about the shop... Tried the famous rasgulla.. I must say i am but disappointed... Its not that it was bad... Its just that it was not exceptional or anything. The build up to it was more than the actual product and going by the sweet rate in Bengal I must say its overpriced..

Well every one knows where this one is situated, right in the juncture of esplanade crossing, this place serves the flavours of the authentic bengali breakfasts, along with some delicious sweets! The sweet spread is huge, and is a feast for sweet tooths. It has sitting arrangements, where you can have your quick breakfast or supper. Been there a few times, to fetch the famous canned rasogolla, and also their tasty peas kachuri! This place has the flavours of kolkatas mishti!

A very much cramped and congested eating experience. Great food. Poor service. The bearer scolded us for pestering him(asking for food at an eatery). We were tourists and didn't know the local language pretty much. Went to the place with a hungry stomach and came out with a bitter experience. Apart from these the rasagolla and the singaras were extremely good.

So it all depends on what u want in this place.  Peaceful dining is not possible.  Food is food u may have to wait for long sometimes 30 to 40 mins.  I had some sweeks and dhokla and i enjoyed.  But there us always chaos during peak times.  By the time u pay and vo to the counter your sweet may be sold out.  But still it is worth at this place.

It was the last destination on my itenary for Kolkata as had to buy sweets to be carried back to Mumbai. 
Reached just before lunch so didn't take much time to get the sweets I wanted. Coz during lunch there are long queues as the Bongs love their Rossogullas with every meal. 
Obviously had to buy the famous Bengali Rossogulla by the kilos. Got the cans that are best to carry back home. 
Couldn't leave the place without trying the Rasmalai a personal favourite. They were just out of this world. Melting in the mouth as soon as you eat one. And seriously no one can eat just one. They were  just superb not had Rasmalai so soft in a long time. 
A permanent on the itenary to Kolkata.

Visited K.C.Das in September when I was in Kolkata. I was at this specific location as I was nearby for some shopping. Had mishti doi and some other sweetmeat and was not that impressed. Had high expectations from the brand " K.C. Das". Also took their canned rosogulla for my friends in Hyderabad. Took 5 cans, each costing 220. The total bill only for rosogullas was INR 1160. The rosogullas were satisfactory. The staff is a little indifferent. Overall a recommended place for desserts.

The tagline of "taste of traditions" absolutely suits it.
Located at the crossing, it provides some of the authentic bengali food, snacks and obviously offers delicious desserts and sweet dishes that mesmerizes every customer's taste buds over here.
With a reasonable amount it provides bengali veg food without onions and Garlic, which makes it an easy access to all kinds of people :) 

So its a treat to have food here to taste the traditions !

KC Das is one of the legendary sweets shop in Kolkata.. Located in the heart of the city. I had recently visited this place.. I had ordered lassi, dahi vada, kachori and Italian samosa. I didn't like the lassi much.. Because of its rose flavour, dahi vada and kachori was tasty but it could have been better and Italian Samosa was the best. I would give it a 4 out of 5. It is very much pocket friendly.. If you want to have hygienic food at cheap prices that too in a location like Dharmatola then this place is a must visit.

If you talk about sweets and ofcourse rosogolla in Kolkata so, KC Das is the legacy of Kolkata.

K.C. Das is legacy of Kolkata,located in the heart of kolkata just outside the esplanade metro station and without any doubt they are the pioneer in sweets and this one is the main outlet of this chain.
I ordered rasogullas and rassmalai and they are best I have tasted till today,you can enjoy your sweets and other stuff like burger and puri sabzi with a decent ambience and light music,spacious as well.
If you are in Kolkata you must be here otherwise the trip is half done !

Have heard a lot about this place and finally got to be here. So K.C.DAS has a two storey shop, the entire upstairs has got a sit out area. Since was in hurry to catch a bus,so I got it parcelled. So here are the dishes from the menu that I took on the go-

PEAS KOCHURI- the kochuri was quite soft and was not oil soaked, served with potato curry and they complimented each other quite well.

ROSSOMALAI- got the big rossomalai which cost around 32/- per piece is worth the money. The texture of the sweet is perfect and tastes absolutely supreme and can charge up ur boring day.

A name which needs no introduction to sweet lovers K.C.Das Kolkata!!!
The Rossogullahs and Rasmalais of the shop are  household names. 
On this trip to Cal, we went to the Espanade branch near New market to have quick snack cum sweet experience. The legendary place is still modestly kept with few seating places and no frills eatery. 
We had plate of Aloo dum with masala puris. The puris were yummy and the masala was great. Aloo dum was done with low spices in typical Bengali style and alongwith puri makes a  memorable snack.
Having studied in Bangalore,I have been to their MG road  branch many times mostly for rosgollahs and always loved them. Therefore inspite of huge range of sweets we again settled for the rosgollahs. The rosgollahs were super fresh and therefore even slightly warm. The taste is intact and inspite of all variations with size,this rather small sized Rossogullah is the real taste of k.c.das. 
As opposed to m.g.road bangalore branch,the branch was very reasonably priced and giving a taste to food history of Calcutta!!!!

Price : Too affordable. Quality food served with such reasonable rates üëåüëç

Well, i ordered for radhabollobi , Dahi Bada. It was really of good taste! 
As there sweets items are in great demands they have quite rush and crowds... anyhow i managed to get sits in the ground floor only. And enjoyed a veg day (Saturday) with such delicious food üòä

LOCATION - Esplanade crossing (Near Paradise Cinema )

Among all the sweet shops in Kolkata this place brings quite uniqueness in there sweets . Located at the crossing of the Esplanade popularlly known as Dharamtalla . Opens at around 7.30 -8.00 am in the morning . The place is quite congusted as there is lack of seating space . Different types of chena sweets and others r available all time . Plus point is Rasmalai - The best thing to have it . The mouth will feel so delicious that u will have it more . Same goes for Rosogulla . U get different snacks over there tooo . Staff is not active so much . There is only 1 person at the billing counter so u might have to stand in line for your order . Overall a nice place

Located just at the junction of esplanade. Very easily located as it serves as a landmark here. The staffs here are very friendly. They smile and talk. And also generously tell you the name of the sweets when asked.

We had Rasho Malai. It's a speciality here. Melts in your mouth. Please do try this one out.
Mishti doi, sweet and tasted more like flavoured yogurt.
Kalo jam was not up to the mark.
Rasho maloncho too turned out to be a disappointment.
Kesar Raj bhog was soft and tasted really good.
Chom chom too tasted nice.
Their USP was the nice and friendly staffs. They serve you water periodically and are very active. 1 extra point for that.

There are so many shapes and sizes you might be confused which to get. Simply take the giant one.
All sweets here are delicious and true value for money.
The taste of authentic rasgulla, perfectly spongy and not overly sweet. Just the way I dreamt.
The staff is quick and polite and parceling the sweets is done in good and lasting quality.

A good place to eat if you have a sweet tooth though they also serve burgers, sandwiches and other items. Their rasgulla are delicious and so is the sandesh that they offer. Their misti dahi is also pretty taste. Try avoiding the beverages here as they are machine made and don't taste that good. A place worth visiting

From my childhood I heard about 'k.c.das rasogolla' and finally I went there with my friends around 8pm. After reaching there I found the special sweets which are famous by name k.c.das misti, was over. Even variety of flavoured 'dai' also over. so we are some different types of misti. But whatever expectations I had from k.c.das rasogolla it didn't fulfil that,I felt it was not upto the grade. Now service,less number of waiters and their services was very slow. For tasting 3-4 sweets we waste around 2hours.
But one thing I like that's there atmosphere,still they maintain 'bengali rajbari'style like red carpet,'jharbati' etc.

Located in esplanade. This is a "mishtir dokan" which has gained a lot of fame. It is a 2 storey building and serves a variety of sweets and veg savouries. Ambience is beautiful and staffs are courteous. Went their last during the pujas. Had maharajbhog and cheese sandwich
Maharajbhog : a rosgolla which is as big as a cricket ball. It costs rs 40 but has the capability to fill your stomach
Sandwich: it was good but tasted like the ones available at railways. Overall a good experience

I wouldn't really care how the food is if the staff knows how to treat customers. 
This particular restaurant has staff who think they rule you and the whole country presumably. 
I know it is part of a huge heritage and has made itself prominent, but I really wouldn't go here, unless I'm being taken with a gun on my head.

This outlet is located in Esplanade. KC Das may be the most iconic and famous Misti Joint in Kolkata.
Went for a lill  snack.
I Ordered
1.Kochuri and alurdam : this combination can never go wrong. Deepfried kachuris with stuffings of karaishuti(green peas) accompanied with kasha alurdam taste awesome.
2. Rajvog: Basically the bigger version of Rasogulla.
3. Kesar Dahi: Misti Dahi infused with flavour of saffron. Could not ask for more.They have a variety of Misti doi.

Must order :
1.Rasogolla. (They also have diabetic Rasogolla)
2. Dahi.
3.Any Misti that u like as everything in KC Das taste awesome..

While waiting for a friend which is supposed to visit me at Esplanade, I felt an urge to enter K. C. Das and try some stuffs out.¬† I have had high hopes from this restaurant owing to the fact that the "word-of-mouth" was very appreciating.
On entering, I realised that one has to order at billing counter for the food and then wait for it to be served. Likewise, I did the same and it was kind of hassle-free if not too appreciating. Being a non-sweet lover, I ordered Dahi Vada which is said to be the second best after Rasogolla.

While waiting my order to be delivered at my table, I happened to observe the place. It is kind of a small area but cutely decorated making it a centre of attention once people passes the area. The staffs are given a particular uniform making it synonymous with the restaurant. I could not help but notice that the hospitality one gets there is far below expectation. It is almost as if they are offering us free food and we keep visiting them each passing day.

Ultimately, my trance got interrupted when the plate of Dahi Vada was served. It was so passionately garnished that one would almost fall for it, but, I got a sudden slap of disappointment on having a bite of it. Just getting its tasted, I realised the old saying - ‚ÄúLooks can indeed be deceptive". Being charged such a high price for just two pieces of Vada (1 plate) does not get justified in any manner. However, after completing the stuff, I departed to meet my friend trying to forget the "blunder" I just made.

A visit to be avoided at any cost.

K.C. Das is the very first restraunt that I visited in Kolkata. Had heard rave reviews about their roshogullas and various other sweet delicacies. They have the sweet counter on the ground floor with a cozy , low roof seating area on the first floor. We ordered for kheer kadam, Gulab jamun and rajbhog (kesar) it was very difficult to chose from the never ending menu of sweets. Kheer kadam was my favorite of all, justice to the goodwill and reputation that this place has earned. The other were better than what I have had so far, but I was expecting a bit more (greedy). I would personally suggest this place for anyone who happens to visit Kolkata.

Tried Rosogolla, aam doi, rosomalai & Pea kochuri-cholardal.
All the sweets tasted heavenly and were fresh. Kochuri-cholardal was very tasty with nice stuffings.

Pocket pinch is reasonable as per quality.

Highly recommended.

The legendary KC Das, it has ground floor as self service and first floor as waiter service, as the waiters always ask for tips after the meal, so I prefer seating downstairs. Love their Nolen gur rasgulla and the Maharaja Bhog(a giant ragulla to last minimum 3 bites).
Their traditional luchi is always to order here and their inoovation the ittalian samosa is great, a samosa with fillings of white sause and sweet corn, yum it is. Its served owen heated evertime, but will love it to be spot fried, never accept the chutney here with it, it kills taste.

They have packed Rasogullas too but the fresh ones are the best! Cotton balls, that melt in your mouth.

K. C. Das needs no introduction or review, atleast in kolkata
Founder of the famous rasogulla, k. C. Das is a house hold name.. 
The review is thus of the outlet.. 
This outlet is perhaps the most popular owing to its location... 
Service is very friendly and swift.. 
The only problem is that they dont have a washroom

Please try their pea kochuri( koraisuttir kochuri) ..the cholar daal is awesome.. 

Recently they have also started to serve a limited menu of 
Burger, chinese singara, sandwich...

One of the leading brand names of Kolkata Sweets is K C Das.The items that attract me most are Rosgolla n Rasomalai. No one else in Kolkata or anywhere around can prepare such delicacies ,in particular the Rosomalai .With the advent of winter when Nolen-Gur is available the rosomalai becomes more palatable.Besides thesw one can try Malpoa ,Jalvora talsas (in Winter only),Special Kalakand, Khirer chop Provubhog ,Labangolatika. Being located in Esplanade more it's also quite become a landmark for commuters.

A heritage sweet shop of Kolkata or Bengal we can say. The sweets r not just sweet but a magnificent creation of the century. We relished the following below:

#mango_dahi: served in plastic containers, the flavored curd was amazing. With a creamy layer commonly called "mattha" on top gives u big grin on ur face reflecting the completeness of ur meal.

#maharaja_bhog: its huge rasgolla with stuffed pistachios n kheer gives it a unique taste n makes u feel like ur having a king's meal.

#kheer_chop: a hard sweet covering outside with a very soft kheer stuffing inside with pistachios n cardamom. It's a good not very sweetish sweet for those who loves less sweetness in sweets.

#amrita_kumbho: it's a magnificent thing of all. A sandesh pot filled with liquid jaggery commonly available n known by the name "nolen gur". This unique concept attracts foodies to relish the whole edible sweet.

#choco_bell: a bell shaped sandesh with chocolate filling inside will make u aware of the winter festivities specially Christmas. Another very tasty sweet of this authentic n heritage shop.

Overall, nice n cozy place to relish the sweet treasures of Bengal. They have both self-service n waiters to serve u. Decor is perfect that reflects the heritage ambience.

A legendary place like this needs no introduction. ¬†Their canned Rasogollas travel the world and they've contributed a lot in making Rasogollas the most popular sweet of Kolkata/Bengal.¬†

However, now there are many other sweet shops in Kolkata which make better rasogollas. Still, I would say, ¬†a visit to this legendary outlet is must if you want to taste ¬†a variety of Bengali sweets. You will not be disappointed for sure!

Good outlet, fine ambience.
Their Rosogollas are the best , many varieties and spongy.
Besides , I tried kachori, aludum , dahi Vara , singaara, sondesh , Misti doi , rasmalai , which were thoroughly delectable .
Pocket pinch is reasonable as per the quality.

An iconic sweetshop in near Esplanade bus stand. KC Das, finds place in the legendary places to visit in the city. The shop was given a makeover a few years back and looks very much like a modern sweet shop. A sitting area is also added, though I have always packed things from here.

Standouts- 
Famous for their rosogullas and variety #recommended
Gurer rosogulla is my favorite
Ras Malai
Shinghara 
Cholar Dal and puchi
Sondesh

Are all must try 's here. 
Some other variants like gulab jamun, chumchum are also available. Though I don't like the gulab jamun from here. 

Prices are reasonable, but rosogullas being their speciality is relatively high priced. 
Nonetheless, a must try in the city known for its sweet tooth and innumerous mishti addas!

The space is quite small compared to the amount of customers. Though the ambience is good, giving a traditional bengali feel. This joint is considered to be the connoisseur of the famous bong sweets-rossogollas and rasmalai. I went there simply for the love of good sweets. We ordered for their kesar rasmalai, kheer chop, malpua and a glass of lassi to wash them down with. Undoubtedly the sweets were awesome, just a tad too sweet for my taste. They even serve typical bengali breakfast items,available all day long. The service was quick and the prices were reasonable. Loved the combo of the ambience along with the desserts.

Before I shifted to Kolkata I used to hear a lot about this place. The famous K.C Das sweet store. I must say their collection and quality of sweet is brilliant. I have tried few items there and each and every one of them is good. Moreover for a person like me who loves sweet and enters any sweet shop that I find on my way, this place just captured me totally.
If you are in Esplanade you must visit this place if you haven't visited yet.

Went to KC Das with very high expectations. The sweets were pretty decent and the restaurant was quite systematic. It is one of the very best Kolkata has to offer and should be tried atleast once. Not all the sweets are that great (e.g. kesari rajbhog) and some items are bit too heavy priced for its kind ( a glass of lassi costs 32 rs), and they serve way too much suger syrup with the sweets. Overall feel and ambience is of very good standard and the seating arrangements are nice as well. They serve kochuris , sandwiches and burgers as well so you can grab a quick bite of everything under one roof. :)

After a long time today we visited this place again. I was craving for sweets actually..so made my mind upto 6-7items atlast. Here you have to first choose which sweets or snacks you wanna have and make a recipt of those items from the counter. Then u have to show your recipt to the staffs,and they will provide you the items.. we had talsash, rose sandesh, kalojam, pisachio-keshar doi, lassi, chalate pistachio sandesh and if course rosogolla. I loved the rosogolla and doi the most. üòçüòÑ Talsash and kalojn was also good. Other items were okayish. And the lassi was too sweet to me. üòê Overall a good experience.

We all know that Kolkata and its popular sweetmeat "Rosogolla", bears an iconic connection which is not only a taste to savour your sweet tooth, but also a legendary creation by 'Nabin Chandra Das'(apart from his other delicacies), which contributes to the historical legacy of the city.

After the demise of 'Nabin Chandra Das', the legacy was carried forward by his son 'Keshab Chandra Das' who survived from 1869 to 1934. In fact, it was during his tenure, that canned Rosogolla was launched for the first time, which eventually happened to be the first ever canned dessert in the country.

However, after his demise, his son 'Sarada Charan Das' continued the legacy, who started to expand the business with increasing the number of shops. And to start off with, he opened up a shop at Esplanade East in 1935, and this was the first time the shop name is shortened to its smart and crisp form "KC DAS", the brand that is a buzzword today in the sweetmeat industry. Right now, you are reading the review of that very first 'KC Das' of Esplanade East.

The legacy continued with generations passing by, and today, the brand has reached the apex of its success and achieved its perceptual image in the mind of its target consumers. Even a child is aware of what 'KC Das' is famous for, and the number of outlets mushroomed up like anything all over the country. But even in the crowd of so many outlets, this particular "KC Das" at Esplanade East is still shining with all of its glory, and happens to be a noted landmark of the particular area.

To update with time, the shop included new items in the menu, upgraded itself to an air conditioned restaurant with a pleasing and soothing ambience where one can sit and indulge in to some sweet delicacies and quick snacks. In fact the taste is genuinely delicious and the price is absolutely justified in comparison to the taste and quality. In fact it is a matter to take pride that they consistently maintained their signature delicious taste with time and still catering the same taste to the young crowd of today, that they served once to the stalwarts of yesteryears.
Each and every item is worth trying at this place, especially the signature Rosogolla, and if you are on a Kolkata tour, then your tour will be incomplete for sure without 'KC Das' er Rosogolla.

Walk in, and be a part of the age old legacy over some mouth watering delicious notes rolling down your taste buds.
Cheers!! :)

K. C. Das Grandson Pvt. Ltd ‚Äì Home is where the Rosogolla is

KC Das are the pioneer of Rosogolla (milk based sweet preparation dipped in sugar syrup) If you happen to visit Calcutta make sure you pay a visit to K.C.Das and Grandsons for their amazing sweets. You won‚Äôt be disappointed at all. 

I have spent my childhood in Calcutta and hence I have witnessed its popularity in great detail. It is a great place to try Misti doi, rasmalai and samosas too. There are multiple outlets and I have visited the one near Kalighat temple, Esplanade and Shyambazaar as well. In short it‚Äôs a paradise of sweet lovers.

Got to know that K.C Das is a household name for sweets and world famous Rosogollas. ¬†Their Esplanade outlet is small and very congested. Read somewhere,that they were the first that introduced Canned Rosogollas. I tried their Rosogolla, Rossomadhuri and Prabhubhog. I am not very fond of sweets but their rosomadhuri and Rosogolla is really tasty. worth trying. Needless to say its a paradise for sweet lovers in Kolkata and other states.

K.C.Das doesn't need any introduction to people of Kolkata atleast! They have been here for ages and their rasogollas are fanous... however with lots of other options coming up everywhere they seem to have lost quite a narket out there... overall although quality is good but the price is on the higher side... and so its just those who love the brand who buy here... and .... those who want a good sweets outlet.... perhaps the only big one in the area!

Located right in Esplanade more opposite the masjid, KC Das is not hard to locate and it's there for years, everybody knows.

Mainly it's known for it sweets but we had Radhabollobi and tarkari and it was really really good. Hotly served and well made. 4 pieces in a plate for 40. A good meal to treat your hungry stomach at a cheap rate.


Try this. Sweets we all know, they're good at. 

But space and ventilation in the ground floor is an issue. Very hot inside. Otherwise it's great.

How can one visit Kolkata and not drop by KC Das? This monumental restaurant is a quick place to stop by and grab some hot samosas and devour some rasgollas. The building was a little old, but maintained well, and its beauty is remarkable. It is a very popular joint, with people rushing in and out all the time. They don't have a variety of dishes, but it is the right place to be for some yummy mishti.

There are thousands of sweet shops littered all across the city so if you're really confused about where to go, know that you can always trust the K.C. Das brand. And this is the original one!
I'll be honest and say that when I first entered, I was a tad disappointed. This was my first time at Kolkata and after all the hype I heard about this place, I expected a little more from the ambience. I mean, sure one could argue that since this place gives you dead cheap prices (and I really mean dead cheap) one should not expect a spectacular ambience. But still, little things like clean tables and walls go a long way. The table we got was stained and sticky and pretty gross to be honest. Anyway I let that pass.
We ordered the kachori with chola dal, a cup of tea of rasamalai. Jesus Christ was it delicious or what!! I have tasted nothing like it. Everything from the tenderness of the kachori to the flavour of the dal to the quaint little cups of tea(see pics) and the milky rasamalai was delicious! I thoroughly enjoyed the meal and took back all my negative feelings on the ambience... Because the food sure is worth it. And again... It's one the cheapest places out there.
The waiters are pretty friendly and all seemed like they've been working here for quite a while.
I heard from my friend that this place gets jam packed every evening so make sure you come on time.
All in all, if it's your first time at Kolkata, this is one place you can't afford to miss. And even if it isn't, I'm pretty sure you'll find very few places in the city that can match K.C. Das.
Definitely coming here the next time I visit!

I have heard a lot about K.C. Das from almost everyone and finally got the opportunity to go there. My sister and I went there around 8 pm and to our dismay the inventors of rasmalai didn't have rasmalai available at that time. We ordered the famous Rasgullas. The first bite I took was so tasty,it had just the correct amount of sweetness it should have though it was not as soft as I expected it to be yet it was delicious. I do hope that someday I get to try their Rasmalai.

They make perhaps the best rosogollas in town. They are incredibly soft , spongy and delicious. You just can't miss their rosogollas if you visit this place. Their peas kachuri is also brilliant. I generally prefer to have it during the winter months. They also make cold lassi which is pure Bliss especially during the summer times.

Sweets are very traditional of moderate quality that you would get anywhere but yes some of their sweets have exceptional taste but not like the other famous sweet shops of Kolkata. Apart from sweets a years ago I had tasted their Pees Kachori and though the taste was good but I never felt like travelling all the way to taste it again. So if you are close by and are hungry you might give it a try but do not expect something exceptionally good because they go only by their name, nothing is great at least in their Espalanade outlet.

Ambience is also soothing..

Though k.c. das is famous for its rasgulla, I like their gulab jamun, kalojam and lobongo lotika too. I am a big fan of their sweets. Some people say it's quite overpriced but I think they have set a standard for which they charge a  few bucks extra. The quality of sweets is outstanding.

K.C. Das is one of the best sweet selling shop at Esplanade, but being on a busy crossing it's too crowded, and the worker are very rude and ill-mannered, one need to stand almost 15-30 mins before ordering... But the sweets worth that waiting! The rasgullas are soft and spongy, the rasmalai taste awesome, the special nolen gurer sandesh ( available only in winters) tastes awesome....

I have never been a great fan of this brand as a whole! They serve sub-par sweets and simply live on their past glory which has been built into a hype! Located centrally near Esplanade, this is one of the prime landmarks in this city. Have tried Karaishutir Kochuri with Cholar Daal, Lassi and some sweets including Rasgullas.

Personally, myself and Rasgullas don't go actually side by side. I am very particular about having the right ones and this brand as a whole has disappointed me. The local shop at a market nearby my place serves better Rasgullas than K.C. Das. The lassi was churned well but lacked sugar. Well, I didn't ask for sugarless one!

The Kachoris were a disappointment again. The only saviour was the Cholar Daal, which was just the way I liked it. I usually drop by here once in a while, in a blue moon when I am nearby. But, other than that, this is into my no-visits list!

I love this place, I really do.
I mostly like to sit in the upper floor, watch the city go by, with a glass of their super thick lassi or cholar daal aar koraishutir kochuri. The service is laid back, but very warm and polite. Plus food always comes fluffy and piping hot. The cholar daal is slightly sweet, but very chunky and that's exactly as I like it. The kochuris are very well made as well, they usually go in my stomach before I remember to get a click. The soya roll is the only one thing that was a bit average; but if you want low fat, this is perfect. Sweets are brilliantly done as ever; sweetness and freshness absolutely in point. 
The place is slightly higher priced than the nearby places; but the ambience, the simplicity and quietness, it is very worth it. If you ever think of having a kochuri-mishti date with class, this is just the place to be.

It took 7 long year to visit a K C Das for me! Overall experience is good.We tried Italian samosa, Dahi vada, Khirer luchi and Rasa malancha ( I dont like Rajvog personally). Nothing to say about Rasa malancha and Khirer luchi. Those were really delicious. About the Italian samosa, I don't know if Italians eat samosa or not and even if they do what do they use as the core. But definitely not cheese and sweet corn (what so Italian among these two?). The vada was not so soaked with the dahi and had a hard and tasteless core, which I think should be taken care of. The wash basin is not cleaned regularly and the used plates are kept primarily in a open place which is not desirable.

Sounds quite strange but to be very frank I didn't like the spongy rosogolla that they are famous for. Instead I liked the Gulab jamun, the delicious choco kadam. Also do try out the club kachuris and the singara. The kachuris cost 30 bucks for 4 pieces. The staff is friendly and the service is quick. The ambience I's also quite nice upstairs.

It may sound crazy but frankly speaking I don't like their spongy rosogolla where the sweetness doesn't soak into it.
Kachuri and singara are very tasty.
Aam Sandesh, kalakand,lobongo latika and some other Sandesh are delicious. Price is high probably due to their brand value.
Don't be biased, KC Das doesn't mean only rosogolla. If you don't like those you have many other options for your gastronomic pleasure.

I could review this place if i got to the food before the mosquitoes did. This place should be renamed to Mosquito house. The waiters need to be paid enough to have their outfits washed once a year at least. 
At least their outlets in Bangalore had better hygiene standards than the Kolkata one.

Prior to a "how to haggle and bargain" coaching session at Esplanade,my Marwari friend suggested we eat up at this iconic outlet to increase our energy levels.We went for radhabollobis,cholar daal and a plethora of sweets like rasgullas and chumchums.Well this regular breakfast combo isn't novel to the common bengali but the taste here was fabulous.I had no complaints with the no-nonsense service or the basic ambience.The nominal prices and proper hygiene standards are a cherry on the cake.Some brands never lose their charm.

Located in Esplanade. This place would always be crowded since it is a pass-by outlet for the office people and students, as well.
The ambience is nothing special. Smells a bit.
Seating arrangement is fine.
Kachoris are good but can be improved. Rasgollas are okay.

Overall, has lots of room for improvement. Good luck. :)

I was a first time visitor to Kolkata and in the morning itself my friends suggested me of this place. I banged in as I wanted to start with Kolkata with the most famous Rasgullas of KCDas. My friends say this is the place where Rasgullas are made for first time in Kolkata.
The place was cozy and comfortable. Gives you a feeling of going into a heritage cafe till the time you enter in it. Bit the groundfloor is no way close to the expectation of heritage cafe. The ground floor seating places more or less looks to you like some college canteen. Still you get a feeling of dining in a old restaurant though.
Ok,  here comes the Rasgullas. No!! They dont taste anything great. I have had far better rasgullas  at my place. My be my tastebud fails to accept this taste of rasgulla. Yes, they are white and spongy but the sweetness just doesnt soak in in you. Not close to something that you cant eat, but I expected it to be grand. 
Then lassi. It was sweet but too cold. Too cold to the extent that i felt like drinking a gola sarbat. My idea of drinking lassi has been drinking it quick. But the cold lassi made my tongue to go numb to realise any taste out of it. Disappointed.
The good part of that is the location. You can see the decoration of typical bong stuffs such as old dolls, goddess durga head. The white and red paint job of the place gives you a pure bengali feeling. 
Over Ally, visit the place once for the sake of visiting. If you are choosy for the rasgulla taste then start with other sweets first. They looked great and im sure they taste great too.

K C Das who has not heard of this place or tasted their Rossogullas ???? Besides the local people visitors from outside make their way here just to savour and take away tins of the good stuff. This place is 'nearly'as old as the hilsl so as to say. There is BC and AD we all know but then there is also KC !!! Work around Dalhousie or the Esplanade area and you cant miss the place. Go there for the Rajbhogs,Maharajbhogs or plain good old Rossogollas...other things are incidental here. They have added a number of items over the years but then singaras and luchi aloo or kachori can be had elsewhere.

Competetion is hottingup and this little old man who comes with a large canaster on his head and delivers at home is unbeatable. So look out for him if you live in the lansdowne/Elgin area or then go to KCDs.!!!

Being in Kolkata, I wanted to try rossogolla. Everyone suggested try in K.C.Das. So off to KCDas. I tried Rossogolla, Kesar Rajbhog and Rasmalai. Delicious...really good. Kesar Rajbhog is excellent. A must visit place for Bengali Sweets in Kolkata.

one of the downside is the employees are rude and does not care about the customers. Just for the taste we can ignore them.

A very random experience visiting this place and it was another daily thing. The shownis nothing extravagant, just a small shop with a handful of seating places. The decorations were simple thanks to new year celebratios with a few tuni lights here and there. The variety of sweets was decent, not all encompassing, not very less.. All typical Bengali sweets like varieties of sindesh and rosogolla is plenty.. Just for the same ofbir we tried the nolen gurer rosogolla. The taste was nice but to our disappointment it wasn't warm and they would not warm it for us either. 
All in all, just another regular place for a quick stop or grabbing a few Bengali sweets.

KC das is one of the oldest sweet shops in Kolkata located right opposite to Tipu Sultan Masjid at Esplanade. Their rosogolla is authentic, soft and spongy.

K.C. Das is an Indian confectionery famous for its sweet and snacks. They are known for inventing the famous white spongy Rossogolla. I visited this place located in Esplanade East, near New Market area.  

I was planning to buy some delicacies for my family and friends back in Chennai and try some of their snacks and delicacies. The place was overcrowded and so I had to settle with takeaway of Rassogolla tins. 

During Security Check at airport, I was informed that Rassogolla tins aren‚Äôt allowed in hand carry. Liquid more than 100ml isn‚Äôt allowed! I had to re-pack and send it along with my luggage then. 

Taste wise Rassogolla s were Syrupy and YUMMY.¬†Highly recommended for Sweetaholics..

Ordered Radhaballavi and gurer rosogolla. It was nice though not great. Seating arrangements was on 1st floor. Ground floor is for self serving. A good place for veg food. But They should put more effort in basics like rosogolla etc. This store needs a few "great" items as unique selling proposition(USP). Radhaballavi was very ordinary. Washbasin is not good compared to seating and other arrangements. Need to put tissue paper or paper towel in hand wash(washbasin) section. There need to be a consistency throughout.

Sudden visit to this outlet with family. We went there late evening. I went there for 1st time, heard a lot about it but never got a chance to visit. Ordered Radhaballavi, samosa,dahi vada, n rasgulla. 
Radhaballavi was normal in size, i felt the sabji along wit it was bit on the sweeter side.
Samosa was served along with Chatni which i didn't liked at all. 
Dahi Vada was fresh n yummy.
Rasgullas were awesome. I loved it.
Overall, i felt that the quality of food was not that good as it should be. U can have better radhaballavis nd samosa at any common mitthai shops! Prices charged against the quality of food was high. 
Price of Radhaballavi per plate=Rps 40 (4pcs)
Samosa per piece= Rps 12
Rasgulla per piece= Rps 12
Dahi Vada= Sorry, I don't remember.
The interior of this outlet was simple and nice. According to my opinion,they should start taking care of the quality of the food.

Bengali people are known fish, mishti and football.. I don't know much about fish but K. C.Das is the signature sweet shop in Kolkata.. They are always crowded and loaded with orders because of its popularity... Prices are good and quality used in top notch!!¬†
Like every other trends, they have strong roots deep in the traditional sweets and amazing skill to blend in new trends and contemporary tastes..!¬†
I find an uncanny urge to visit this sweet shop again and again!! Maybe it's because of the huge display of mouthwatering sweets or simply the heritage of this place.. So K. C. Das is a must go place if you are around Esplanade area.. Am sure anyone who has tasted rasogolla in selected eateries of Kolkata will not praise K. C. Das rasogolla.. So I generally get there to pick up freshly made rasogolla & Kalo jam... The winter season is nothing but the short of paradise for the sweet toother like me as all the shops rustle up Nolen gur sweets and their rasogolla is something I really looking for.. Will visit again for sure to have the marvels of Nolen gur..

My judging duties for the eastern zonal business case challenge are formally over by 1630. My flight back to Mumbai is at 1900; so my aged  limo driver kaka drives me to KC Das (I had asked him in the morning to take me for some quick purchases back home). This is a venerable institution that no Kolkattatite will not know, it's what Haldirams is to Delhi, Grand Sweets ( read my review) in Chennai, LMB in Jaipur or Chitale In Pune. 

A small shop tucked in the busy Main Esplanade Street; its perennially crowded ( this is my second visit here) with regular patrons who know what to buy and eat right here standing in the small waiting area near the counters. It's Samosas or Shingadas as they are locally known sold out and it's only nearing half past five. The  Lucchi and Aloo gravy looks delish but I can't pack it. They also have sweets for diabetic eaters. I order the famous rosgolla cans  (two for INR 400/- ), a  Bengali spicy mixture called dal moth, 2 pots of  mishti doi and another packet of a corn and peanut mixture called Channachur. The staff ask if I will like to try a pot of  channar  payesh and I succumb to one. Blissful and Sinful. Packets in my hand I cross the tram line as crowds throng out from their offices, my driver is bang on schedule to pick me on the opp side. As we drive towards NSC airport, the madness of this city I feel is equalled by its old worldly charm, where time has stopped and you are back to Sonar Bangla !!!!

Wanna try some really finger licking typical Bengali sweets and doi? This is a must visit for all people possessing a sweet tooth.
Mango doi and kesar doi are their best items. Apart, lassi and other sweets are also pretty good.
Still have so many visits left to this place.

Every one in kolkata is awarded of this place but still I would recommend every one to visit at least once.
I have not been there many times, but had there  sweets a lot.
Only one word for them. #SPECTACULAR 
Special mention  rosogolla, kochuri, paneer chop, rosomalai, darbesh and many others.

Felt like reviewing it in zomato so I took some pics on my last visit.

I tried choco-o-delight, lassi and rajbhog, could not try other items as I am not very fond of sweets. But I must say sweets over here is really good. Ambiance OK, service is also good. 
Hope to try other sweets soon. Recommended for sweet lovers.

I have always romanced fine things in life and I am in love with mishtis (sweets).Some places are so old and vintage that they squeeze in heart and soul of the city Yes K.C das is one of such legendary sweet shop I got an opportunity to visit they claim to be inventors of rasgulla.
Let me give you some TRIVIA---
There are different ideologies behind invention of rasogulla some thinkers say that some Bengali visitors went to Jagannath temple (puri) and they brought the recipe of rasgulla to Bengal in 19 century and other school of thinkers stated that 17 century Portuguese introduced art of making khoa and then it got popular in Bengal and was used widely in making sweets as it tasted distinctive melable property made it a perfect ingredient ,so I was about to eat rasogulla an age old legecay.Every sweet I had in K.C Das was amazing a must visit place.

Kolkata is equal to Rosogolla, and the Godfather of Rosogolla is K.C. DAS.

K.C.Das is one of the identities of Kolkata. This particular K.C. Das shop have blended with the Bengali culture itself. If you are new to the shop, you might get spoilt by the variety of the product; however, the stuff is well experienced and would guide your sweet tooth. The two iconic products are Rosogolla and Rosomalai. One must also try the Radhaballvi (Peas stuffed Puri) in the snack section.¬†

While the other outlets of the franchisee are just hoax, this is undoubtedly the best Sweet shop in Kolkata.

A legacy when it comes to authentic bengali sweets. Jalbhara, sandesh, sharbhaja, kamalabhog are just class apart ! ... Also snacks like shingara and radhaballabi taste pretty good. The iconic is the Rosogolla which was popularized by K.C Das himself !¬†
The manager there is very helpful, ¬†he will suggest exactly what to take away from there if you are going out of station. I brought sweets till Pune, so it took 12 hrs before I could put them in the refrigerator. The sweets tasted good exactly till the time he had told...

The best k.c das outlet in kolkata for sure. A big place so generally there is no problem for having a sweet or two. The first floor area has seating arrangements for having a meal. What to say about this place? Rasogollas are famous and everyone knows that. The soft, spongy, juicy rasogolla makes u melt everytime u have one. Other than this, the lassi served here is chilled, tasty and healthy too. I once had kachori and alur dom which was pretty good too. K.c das is one of my favoutite "mishti r dokan" and frankly, there are very few people in kolkata who have not gone there but if u r among them, just give it a try. U will love it for sure.

K.C.Das is one of the leading confectioners in Kolkata with a global reputation.. More than a century old this is perhaps their oldest outlet and they have built a legacy of their own through serving sweets and savoury items of the highest quality and supreme taste..many famous celebrities are their constant patron and they have justified their reputation without compromising with the quality of their servings till date..They were the first to develop sponge rasagolla and marketed the concept of Tin Rosogolla which has even been exported to USA.. 
Their flavour Mishti Doi is one of my personal favourite..Love the Mango flavour and Kesar Flavour particularly..They have a decent enough and hygeinic seating arrangement with a vintage look at this outlet..
Also they use ghee as a frying medium for their savoury items like Singara,Radhaballavi or Paneer Chop..In the winter season their Peas Kachuri is absolutely finger licking..4 pieces of generous sized Kachuri accompanied with Chholar Dal at Rs.40/- is absolutely stellar..
Among the sweets apart from Rosogolla or Doi do try out their Labanga Latika, Golapi Pera or Kesar Rasmalai..Though pocket pinch slightly more than an average sweet shop in Kolkata but it justified but it justified for the purity of ingridents and sheer taste..

No matter how good the sweets are, if customers are treated badly, the good will is lost. That is what has happened with this outlet.

This is located right at the esplanade dalhousie crossing. It is a very old shop and I have always been a fan of the sweets they make. They have this huge sized rosogolla that is famous and tasty. I also like the kalakand and the sandesh they make. Well it is a bit costly but the stuff are good.

KC Das at Esplanade is a heritage sweet shop which has lured bebgalis and non bengalis for ages. I remember waiting for the chartered buses in front of the shop and most of the time entering almost involtariliy into the magical world of KC Das to explore their various sweetmeats.  I loved the singhara and radha ballavi available here. Also the rosomalai is divine. Located centrally this shop has an advantage where passers by simply drop in out of inquisitiveness and end up tasting the products from their menu. The place has undergone a renovation which has added in attracting more customers now. The canned rosogolla is a must buy if you are going out of Kolkata and want to take mishti for your relatives or friends outside the city.

A good place to have taste of Bengali sweets. Nice hospitality and cleanliness, Rosogulla and kalakand are delicious, even snacks and other sweets are okayish.
Overall quite well.

Heard about this place a lot. I am a visitor from Mumbai so for me this place was just amazing. The rasgullas were just awsum. They were quite big in size but really delicious. I hope they get their outlet in Mumbai also.

Went there is the morning around 11. Had the freshest and spongiest and the best rasgullas of my life. I suggest you go there early morning if you want the best tasting version of the sweets. Make a sampling plate for yourself - sweets and namkeen items. Sit down and savor all of them one by one. 
The sweetness level of the sweets here for me was the most apt. It's on the lesser side which I prefer. And obvsli it's a must visit if you go to Kolkata.

Very overrated place and brand.

2 years back it was a better place. Recently I went there twice and the service and quality, both have worsened a lot.

Sweets are expensive (because of brand effect) but do not taste heavenly as people claim. A rasgulla from KC Das is no better than a rasgulla from an ordinary sweet shop. 

Waiters are rude.
Service is decent. You won't have to wait much for your food.
Food quality and taste are below par be it sweets, samosa or radhaballavi.
They have big ACs that do not work.
Location is good. Well connected with the city.

K.C Das the brand in itself . Everybody  knows and everybody recommends.
I tried the Singhara Italiano and I liked it .
Dahi vada and rasmalai were average but they are famous for rasgola and it was good. Another major plus point for me is that they sell canned rosgulla so I take back to Delhi and let my friends and family enjoy them.

Located at Oyelington, East Esplanade near the Great Eastern Hotel, this place is famous for it's wold class Rosogolla of Kolkata. But after visiting this outlet, my whole perception about this place got change. The waiters are very rude, lack of decency and the quality of the sweets are not upto the mark. Strongly recommend to avoid this outlet.

One of the "Visit by default" place in town at the iconic Esplanade. Though the brand K.C. Das has lost its charm over a period of time now, it still maintains a level of authenticity. Their beautifully stuffed singaras are one of my favorites and have always stepped in to the store whenever I'm in the area.

Overall, a decent place to get a quality bite.

One of the few decent places to eat at esplanade. The place keeps bustling with people. The food ranges from average to good with a few below average delicacies(singhara). There are two levels of seating with the 1st floor being air-conditioned. On the down side, there is poor management & no systematic approach for taking orders & billings. One waiter asks to pay later while another one asks to pay first. Sometimes the waiters take the money even when there is a billing counter which only later leads to confusions.

The famous KC Das. The visist to kolkata would not have been complete had i not visited this place. The spongy 'roshogullas' were yum and apart from that 'rasmalai' was the other item that i tried and i still have the taste of that roshogulla which is difficult to find elsewhere. The shop is located at one of the busiest point however it is quite easy to find it.

Kolkata's famous 'Rossogulla' is mind blowing here. Also try the authentic bengali Samosa, Sondesh, Mishti Doi & variety of bengal's A-list sweets.
This place will give you the perfect taste of the sweets Kolkata is famous for.

The place needs no special introduction. K.C Das and Bengali sweets are anyway synonymous. Any sweet you pick there would be authentic and class apart in taste. Very reasonably priced and a good hangout place too. 

This outlet has a seating arrangement with a decent ambience on the first floor where I also happened to eat the delicious Radhaballavee, Veg Cutlet and Veg Roll. 

The tea/coffee that they serve there is vended from the machine, and hence I'm with holding that .5 rating.

Okay, first of all if you have a sweet tooth you have to visit this place. It has the most succulent and tasty rasmalais that I have had. Likewise, the mishti doi and rasgullas. Even my mom - who is diabetic - could eat the rasmalais which doesn't have excess sugar but has an altogether different flavour because of their use of rosewater. The ambiance and service are decent enough but unimportant for me. The sweets just warrant a visit. Special thanks to my Bong friend for insisting that I visit this place!

Located at the busy esplanade crossing this is a bengali dessert lover's delight! The ground floor showcases the sweets from where one can buy and take the food home. Upstairs is for dine in. The accommodating power is about 30-40 people. Tables for 4 people and 8 people are available. The ¬†T.V was playing Discovery channel Man Vs Wild :-D when I visited the place. The staff is very good and though tipping is not the prevalent culture, I was so pleased with their nice behavior that I did tip them. Our order included Peas Kochuri(4 pieces per plate), Talsansh(Naram Pak), Jalbhara(kora pak),Amrita Kumbha . The Kochuri was served with potato curry. The Kochuris were nice the potato curry was not spicy so kids and old people can enjoy it too. I liked the Jalbhara and Amrita Kumbha more than the Talshas. Jalbhara sandesh's centre consisted of Jaggery. The Amrita Kumbha's centre consisted of a jaggery layer sandwiched between two chocolate layers!! In winter most of the Sandesh items here are made using a mix of jaggery!Delightful and descent place! Enjoy!

Today after visiting this outlet of K.C Das, I am utterly stunned by their illogical behavior. I was taking photographs of the food which I ordered, sitting on my table suddenly one waiter came and rudely and in uncourteous way said "clicking photos are not allowed here".I was completely speechless. How can one of the leading confectioners in town like K.C Das can implement such irrational and unreasonable rules. At today's date when the "culinary world" has become so much precise and tech savvy, people are investing a lot of their time in making an informed choice through blogging to filter out the best options for them( like zomato and others). How on earth did they didn't consider, that through such blogging and other sources they can deliver their organization and its products to the farthest corners, which in fact strengthens their position in the industry. I just couldn't digest such kind of bullshit from the Management of a leading joint like "K.C. Das". My whole perception got
 unsettled regarding this joint. 
==================================
The name "K.C Das" is more than enough to define anything regarding their legacy. I can bet my life that there is no one in kolkata who is not aware of this outlet of the legendary sweet maker of Bengal. Located in the heart of kolkata and the buses named their stoppage of this specific area as "K.C Das", hence anyone can figure out the influence of this place. The world famous "Rasogolla" was actually invented by late "Nabin Chandra Das" the great grand father of K.C Das. So the legacy runs in the family. Whenever i passed by this area i couldn't ever resist the temptation of dropping by to this place to feast on their gigantic rasgullas, rajbhogs, jalbhora sandesh etc. The peas kachori, radhaballavi are also as succumbing as their sweets. Life in kolkata is incomplete without taking a bite on K.C Das' legendary "rasogolla". For tourists, the trip to kolkata is good for nothing if you couldn't savor the magical creation of K.C Das.

This review would be only for people not residing in Kolkata. For Kolkata its a place that needs no introduction.
Well location is a landmark, the history of tha shop dates Long back in the British era.
Quality of the sweets is too awesome, though they now have a lot of competitors in town, they once held a monopoly in sweet dishes.
Well would say that the price though is a bit extravagant bcoz of the hype and reputation that this place holds.

The decor of this place is so warm and cosy....
But while having a sweet chat with someone you can also order the dahi vada...which is a craze during the evening.....

It's very rare when I give a place such a low rating!
But this place just earned it undoubtedly. I am from Mumbai and wanted to pick rasgullas from Kolkata for my friends and family.Looking at the rating on Zomato,i decided to buy it from K.C Das.
But this place disappointed me majorly.
The rasgullas were STALE! 
I ordered in bulk thinking this place would give me the rasgullas Kolkata is famous for and I clearly mentioned it to them that I am taking it for people who are big Kolkata rasgulla fans..
But sadly, the sweets are never going to reach them as I had to throw them all.I am beyond disappointed!

A perfect place to hang out with friends or family. Reasonable price, perfect food, great service. Sweets are the best in Kolkata, my favorite Rasmalai, delicious. Snacks are also good like when it comes to samosa. But I'd not go for the lassi again though. Still all good in this hood.

K.C. Das - Most famous sweets shop!
======
Intro:
Who doesn't know K.C.Das? It's located in the main road of Esplanade when you head towards paradise cinema from new market side. Anyone can locate K.C. Das from far as it has a red board. However, i am a kind of person who likes trying other things rather than the usual special items too. I went with two of my friends here to try out their dish.¬†
This sweet shop has few tables and chair on the below section. I went on the upper section to sit and enjoy my meal with some lassi.
======
We ordered:¬†

1) Dal with Muttor Puri - It was good enough to satiate my taste buds.¬†
2) Lassi - It made my palate really better.¬†
======
Pros:
1) Staffs were really courteous and well dressed.
2) Hygiene was maintained. Specially while ending our meal, they gave us bowl with shampoo water. Usually, we get lemon in hot water. But, this was really good.
3) Reasonably priced.
4) Lassi = Must try.
======
Suggestion:

5) Can definitely improve on their food i.e. Dal poori. If they serve piping hot, its gonna catch the attention more.¬†
======
Meal for two: 300 max.
======
Summary:¬†

Taste 3.5/5
Hospitality 3.8/5
Hygiene 3.5/5
Ambience 3.5/5
Food quality 3.7/5
Food quantity 3.9/5
======
Conclusion:

I would surely revisit again in the near future and update my review with my recent updates on this places. The talks about the sweets will also be made in my upcoming review.
======
Note: Unbiased review based on my dining experience.

A heritage sweet shop stands in one corner of an immensely crowded traffic crossing,right in the city esplanade.
His father Nabin Chandra Das is credited with the maker of the rosogolla(cottage cheese balls dipped in sugar solution).Here lies the sweet shop K.C. Das.
If I'm in Calcutta,then it is a must.Somehow or the other I land up at this place.You must never leave Kolkata without treating yourself to K.C. Das' rosogolla.Carry a tin of rosogollas for your family,wherever on earth you may dwell.
The rosogolla deserves tremendous appraisal, but if you want to settle for some snacks go for the Cottage Cheese Chops.
They are dipped in light oil and very healthy also.The mix consists mostly of Cottage Cheese and capsicum.
Other than all this you can try out the various sweets like the Mango Sandesh,Choco Delite and a plate of Puri and aloo tastes really good.
The interior is very neat and clean and the place has two storeys.
No other sweet shop in Calcutta houses a floor space where you can sit and eat so comfortably. The staff are very good and respond quickly to tend to the customer's needs.

The eat out is very pocket friendly and I believe it is still leading the charts of all the sweet shops in Kolkata.
So if you do not visit this place,believe me your Calcutta trip is absolutely incomplete.

It's a good joint for having veg snacks and sweets and as it is very near to my office I keep a regular visit here. Paneer capsicum chop ¬†and rosomalai is finger-licking here. If you are bit more hungry ¬†go for Motorshuntir kochuri, you will love it. Try to avoid the ground floor as it is bit crowded and noisy, First floor is better (though a.c is not working for a long period and they are trying to manage it with air cooler) than it. Stuffs are good, foods are too. Some sweets are bit over priced but in avarage it is ok.

Nobin Chandra Das is credited with inventing the rassogolla.¬†K.C. Das outlet is named after his son and holds a proud place in Kolkata . There are many other outlets, but one at esplanade has a good seating arrangement. Ambiance is fine. The walls of this outlet display works of young artists and you can buy these paintings.Along with sweets one can savour soybean rolls, radhabollobi etc. There is sugar free sweet for diabetic patients and of course the famous canned rassogolla, lalmohan of K.C. Das for those who want to take home outside Kolkata a bit of sweetness of Bengal.

Located in Esplande , I went to this outlet of K.C Das a week before and found that the quality of food has deteriorated. The ambiance of this outlet is good when compared with other sweet shops of Kolkata. The best part is that they have seating arrangements here. I was with my father and brother and we ordered radha ballavi, dahi vada, lassi, rosogolla, malpoa and sugar free khirkodombo. ¬†We order veg patties too but unfortunately it was not available at 2p.m only! We liked radha balavi,malpoa and khirkodombo (sugar free) but we were surprised to see that the quality of rosogolla has surprisingly ¬†deteriorated. They seriously needs to look into this matter or the glory is over! Now coming to lassi, its yaaak! It was nothing but a glass of excessively sweet cold milk and the dahi vada was not at all upto the mark. I am very much disappointed , I really want that old K.C.Das food quality back as it used to be one of my favorites!

Another traditional and famous outlet , we can tag it as a heritage outlet of K C DAS. It has been serving mouth watering sweets since years without compromising on the quality which seems to get better with time. This place has always been crowded at almost any time of the day. Its difficult to find a seat here but nevertheless I enjoy my sweets anyways.¬†Had recently visited this place and my mom asked me to pack few stuffs. I could not ¬†resist myself and ended up consuming more calories by orderingPeas KochuriDahi vadaRossogolla
Parcel : Rajbhog (kesar)
All the items had the same taste which I recollect having some 5 years back. Kudos to the management. Amazing taste and reasonable price. Authentic food gives a different level of satisfaction and K C das is one of them.

Situated unmistakably at the Esplanade crossing,K.C.Das is a landmark in itself.It is one of the most well known sweet shops of Kolkata.To many K.C.Das is synonymous with rosogollas.Though there is some justification to it,actually I find many of their other products better than the much famed rosogolla.But make no mistake that the rosogollas are also wonderful.The Raj Bhog and the Maharaj Bhog are worth recommending.The tinned rosogollas available in various flavours have become hugely popular.The rasamalai and labanga latika are my favorites here.Other than these the chomchoms,malpoas,gulab jamuns are all very good.The singara and radhaballavis are pretty decent.The sabzi used in the singara is a little on the sweeter side.
It is quite spacious and has seating arrangements inside also.The interiors are quite nicely decorated.But as a result of such a wonderful location and the immense popularity it boasts of,it is always very crowded.If you are looking to have a meal inside you have to go to the payment counter first everytime and that is a bit of a hassle.
The prices are quite high here and that is probably the only negative aspect of this place.In short Kc das is part of Bengali tradition and heritage.It is surely worth recommending and one would surely love it and even more so if you have a sweet tooth.

I was there a year back with my mom and brothers at the time of puja shopping, they served really good desert specially misti doi, rosomalai etc. One can surely try there rosogolla, aam sorbot, and other sweets. It is in esplanade heart of kolkata. Very popular but sometimes they can behave in a odd manner.

KC Das in Esplanade is a huge shop which shows what happends when good mishi shops hit the mainstream. So you have canned roshogolals of various flavours along with the traditional way of selling sweets. You have salty items as well. If you are not overwhelmed by the glitz and glamour of the shop and are able to try the sweets, you will absolutely love the taste and it is one of the famous Kolkata shops. By ow you must have known that I do not like the mainstream idea of mishti shops but this one is really nice and worth a visit if you are in the area.

Being an tourist to Kolkata, KC Das came highly recommended for people like me with a sweet tooth. Located right in the heart of the city, KC Das lived upto it's expectations. The rossogollas were delightful and very juicy and offered at a very reasonable price as well. So the next time you go to new market, make it a point to visit this place.

EXTREMELY poor Customer Service at one of Calcutta's oldest and supposedly well-established joints!!!!!! 

I was served a plate of piping HOT dahi vada (seriously shocking!) and when I complained to some arrogant Mr Atanu Bhattacharya, much to my dismay I was told that KC Das doesn't serve dahi vada cold (as is customary). Obviously I didn't wish to pursue this any further, as I could tell that the quality of service and staff was way below the industry standards and my trying to explain the flawed concept of hot (or room temperature) DAHI VADA is an oxymororn. 

All I can say is that I won't ever go back there no matter what!

They say 'if you do one thing for over a hundred years,you start getting better at it ' and K.C das is doing exactly that,fulfilling the sweet cravings of 'bongs'  since nineteenth century.Do try peas kachuri / radhaballabi / misti doi if you are planning to pay a visit.
A little tip : If you are going to use Debit/Credit card for making payments please tell them while ordering or else you have to pay it by cash. :)

I had to go there as it is one of the most famous food joints in Kolkata, most famous for sweets.
However it dint disappoint me, but I was expecting it to be a bit better. Sweets were not the best in Kolkata I will say but decent enough to try, in-fact good enough.
 And the place was too crowded. Maybe I went there on wrong day. But if you get a good space, can be a nice place to sit down and enjoy.

Best known place for rossogollas in kolkata. Kc das has try to maintain their sweet quality like before but I find they were overpriced a little bit compare to nakur,,tewari & other popular sweet chains.
The service is good & the sitting arrangements are fine. The servers are also well behaved.but thr only problem is that every time for placing a order you have to go to the payment counter & then service counter.
If u love mishti, mostly rossogollas, then you should atleast try their rasbhog(kesar) once.i found it best one here I've ever eaten but little bit of pricey.

4 days back (As on 19.01.2014) I have really experienced one such worst kind of service from KC DAS sweet shop (Esplanade Branch) which really makes one food lover feel bad & humiliated. They don‚Äôt have any communication among themselves especially between Cash Counter & Service desk. Even they don‚Äôt know how to behave with customers and not even try to know their requirements. They have no value for small customers. Prior I have a very good feeling about KC Das but the incident really changed by perspective and view about so called KC DAS & Sons.

For a south Indian like me who has gone to Kolkata for the first time,  the only sweet shop's name which comes to the mind immediately is K.C.Das.  I have been visiting the Bangalore's K.C.Das located at Church Street for the last twenty years.  More than the food items,  certain things will get associated with certain restaurants and you develop a sort of affinity for them.  

Anyone who is familiar with Bangalore will definitely agree with me going to the Church Street Branch of Bangalore, K.C.Das is a very pleasing thing to do.  But whenever,  I went there,  I used to imagine about the original K.C.Das of Kolkata.  All the time,  I wanted to visit the grand old,  K.C.Das main branch located at Kolkata which I think is an independent family run business in the heart of Kolkata.

Finally I got the opportunity and went to the Esplanade Branch of K.C.Das.  In fact,  Esplanade itself resonates with the history and to look into the traces of bygone era sitting in the cane sofas was a dream come true for me.  In an age where theme based restaurants are trying hard to recreate vintage and retro looks,  don't you think its wonderful to enter into an actual piece of vintage building which doesn't require any such fads?

As usual there are innumerable choices of Rosgollas,  Mishti Dahi,  Kesar Dahi and other exotic sweets.  As soon as you get inside you will be surrounded by sweets displayed in shelves which lures you and tempts you.

I understand  that these days people don't get as excited about traditional sweets as cakes,  pastries and ice creams.  But,  K.C.Das is an exception to this and still there are many staunch followers.

Coming to the actual interiors,  its not contemporary or colourful ,  but with a minimum seating and that too old fashioned.  But I was quite happy and elated to seat in a table near to the glass window and observe the hectic phase of esplanade.  One look outside the window,  you will definitely agree that there is functional simplicity.

Though,  K.C.Das is synonymous with Rosgollas(infact a theory says that they are the inventors),  I always prefer sonpapri which is deliciously crunchy which melt the moment you bite.  In fact,  in the initial days Sonpapri used to be supplied to Bangalore Branch through air and we used to place orders in advance.  The other thing I appreciate about this sonpapri is that they have not deviated from the original recipe and did not come with weird variations like Coconut Sonpapri,  Basundi flavoured Sonpapri etc., really thankful for that.

Finally,  I ordered Dahi Vada.  But it was a disappointment,  the curd was not set correctly and the consistency was also watery.  May be comparing a thayir vada(Dahi Vada) of a South Indian Restaurant with that of K.C.Das is not right.

For the proper residents of Kolkata it may not be a popular or sought after hangout any more,  but for travellers like me who are visiting Kolkata for the first time,  its an experience to take back with  fond memories.

KC Das is a must go place if you are around Esplanade and you are a mishti lover like me. I generally get there to pick up freshly made roshogolla for my mother who is a sucker for them. I am more of a khir kodom person, and they make a very nice version of it here. The malai chamcham is a thing of beauty, but if you are not into very sweet stuff, you would probably not like it. In the savory section, I am not much of a fan, except the singara, which is quite nice.

Must try: Rosogolla, Rosomalai, Chamcham and Radhaballavi.

Well known, well established and a brand of it's own, it even saw the changing colors of politics of the city located at the corner of a historical place known as Esplanade crossing. K C Das is not only about sweets but also has a connection with the heritage and culture of this city of joy.

I remember when my childhood friend came here to pay a visit to my place, we had a whole day city tour of visiting all the heritage places of Kolkata including K C Das. At the end of our tour we had Rosogollas, Chamcham, misti doi and had a great time together cherishing old memories and relishing sweet. Before leaving he packed 2 Rosogolla cans for his way back to home in Jabalpur. Even a person from another state can realize the sweetness of having a Rosogolla in K C Das at Esplanade.

Quality wise it has it's own standard coming from our ancestor's time and pricing seems to be okay. I have had much better sweets than this but still I like it. They have a wide range of sandesh including sweets for diabetic patients and you will most likely to miss them if you visit there after 6 PM because of limited stock. Overall, K C Das worth a visit while you are roaming on the busy roads of Esplanade.

Am sure anyone who has tasted Rasagolla in selected small eateries of kolkata will not praise KC Das Rasagolla. But KC Das definitely has Good Quality in its products. If you are new to kolkata and planning to buy / taste authentic bengali sweets, this is the place. 

The Maha Raj Bhog Rasagolla is one which I tasted last at KCD. :) 

Whenever I leave Kolkata, I make sure that atleast 2-3 cans of Rasagolla are in my baggage !!

I have gone here three years before. I went with much expectations, but unfortunately we have disappointed a bit. Since I have had rasagolla in other places prepares better than this, though they are ones who invented Rasagolla. But Rasamalai here was the best I have had ever. We also had Kesar malai chamcham, Chanar Toast, etc., all were tastes good.

K.C. Das

K.C. Paul's umbrella and K.C. Das' rosogolla: these are the two K.C.'s Calcuttans really care about. In fact, if you haven't patronised K.C. Das, don't dare reveal it during an adda: it might well be your undoing.

One of the oldest and the best known sweet shops in the city, K. C. Das has been legendary since the time of our fathers. And an institution which is capable of maintaining that status for this long a period is worth reckoning, especially in an era when there are so many other, new, innovative options coming up, and other people who have invested big money and are out to rise above the average.

In the midst of the chaos called Esplanade in Calcutta, walk into this place and treat yourself to one of their jumbo Rosogollas. You will find them sweet and spongy texture in an equally inviting syrup melting in your mouth as softly as a lover's fingers intertwined with your own. There is a reason why people swear by this delicacy, and why people from all over the world have come to associate the Rasgulla with this city. It is one of the finest examples of what a  'Moyra' - traditional Bengali term for a confectioner can whip up for your taste buds to go crazy about if they want to.

Hands down, this place has the best Rosogolla in town: the fact to support this statement is that they invented it. They revolutionised the world with canned Rosogollas, a product I suspect is on every other bag in an international flight leaving Kolkata.

Rosogolla apart, they also offer fabulous delicacies like "Amrita Kumbha Sandesh", "Chocolate Sandesh" and "Ice-Cream Sandesh" and a lot of sweets with fresh fruit fillings. Nimki and Sabzi Kachoris are also popular, and so are the beverages like Ghol and Lassi (in a number of flavours). Years ago, a man called Sarada Charan Das, along with Nabin Chandra Das, members of the Das family that runs this establishment; invented these items that we now swoon over.

K. C. Das also has a nice range of sweets for diabetic persons - so you can indulge without the insulin bothering you anymore!

Verdict - Since the second half of the nineteenth century, this place has revolutionised how we think about sweets in this city. Be it the succulent, soft Rosogolla or the fact that it is the mother of all fusion sweets; your experience of the legends of Calcutta is incomplete if you don't come here.

This establishment belongs to the Das family... the inventors of the rassogolla .... also the first to sell canned rassogolla's (which I often buy when I travel for friends and family).They are also one of the first sweet shops to have a seating option.Treat your tastebuds to their rassogolla's , rossomalai , kheerkadam and mishti doi all of which are delicious. They also have good nimki's ,singhara's and kachori sabzi. Visiting this place is not great for the waist -line but easy on the tastebuds !

One of the best places to feast on good ol' traditional Bengali sweets, KC Das offers a combination of old world charm with new age service. The rosogollas and pantoas are to die for! Even diabetics won't feel left behind as there are special sugar-free rosogollas and other sweets as well. It is also one of the few sweet shops in Calcutta where there is a provision for sitting and savouring sweets. A definite must-visit place if you want to get a taste of the sweets Bengal is famous for.
