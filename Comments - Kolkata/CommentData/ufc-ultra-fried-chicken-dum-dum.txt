Absolutely excellent. Service with a smile, always hot, not greasy, very crispy and great taste. You can also order large amounts of chicken to cater your party. the taste is distinct . I find the price of their meal worth of the quality and quantity. ❤️I definitely recommend it .

If you need juicy tender fried chickens you gotta visit here. The rates are the cheapest in their field. The best thing about the shop is their combo deals which can fill your stomach without emptying your pockets. The home delivery service is superb.

Really good place...for those who loves kfc type chicken.though it's not as good as kfc...but with compared to the price...the quality which they deliver is really good.The place is small and no place to sit here.I have taken chicken lollypop,chiken pakora,chicken leg...all items are very crispy like kfc...good initiative... hopefully in upcoming days we will get more options from there.

Great to see young entrepreneurs working on their own. The place 8s very near to airport gate 1 -nagerbazar auto stand. I loved their quality. Chicken was tender and soft. Well cooked. We order chicken cheese burger, chicken strips, french fries, chicken legs for office party. People enjoyed their food.
