A very average kinda place to eat at College Street with a decent pricing. Have had the Roomali Roti along with Chicken Bharta from here for quite a few times and found them to be pretty good. They can work upon a little on the cleanliness of the place and packaging for home delivery.

This place in College Street located near to Medical College is very popular among the students who stays in College street area. They have an efficient Home delivery service and the food are good.
Biryani prepared is the best selling item here, as the biryani is really good at Rs.100, we occasionally keep ordering it. Beside the Kebab are good too. I have tried a few from there, all are good.
There is no seating arrangement here. This place only serves for home delivery. If you are a student staying in College Street, I would highly recommend you to at least try their Biryani.

Bindas is a very small joint located near college Street and eden hospital road Junction.. It's a home delivery service mainly for the doctor working in medical college Kolkata.. The chiken biriyani is the only thing you can try, no other food worth any value.. It's service us very quick to medical college..

Bindass is a small take away located just in front of the doctors chummery of medical college. Its location beside shiv mandir proves the fact that if you eat there you have to depend on almighty and the nearby doctors to keep you in one piece. Prices are cheap but the food is unpalatable. However for a quick fix you can order. Their chicken biryani which might be tad oily sometimes. No other dish requires any mention.

To be honest, I'm reviewing this sheerly because of the number of times I've been forced by circumstances to have their fare.  
Its a place strictly for take away so no marks for interior decor and blah blah.. 
Coming to the food 
They make decent biriyanis, albeit a little oily.. Their side dishes are highly spicy,but don't worry coz the Kolkata Medical College is nearby in case you develop diarrhea.. 
Affordable would be an understatement.. And the free delivery wherever you want is a boon for us medicos..

Now the matter is they don't even deserve to reviewed or rated.But I'm giving this review as I'm those unfortunates who was compelled to taste their food and fall sick. I think they have culture of bacilli and amoebae in their food.The only edible thing there is the roll(with a worst quality sauce).
