As a local shop it's okay. Don't expect anything near original KFC. Burger is very poor in quality specially the buns. Price wise quantity is okay but test and quality is poor. Chicken is overfried.

The burger had very less chicken..price was low but still the quantity was way too less...also had the chicken stripes which also had very less quantity..but the taste was surprisingly quite good..the burger's bun was also solid on one side,don't know why!..I hope they would improve so I can order next time from here.

I usually order from here via swiggy. I have tried there chicken burger meal , chicken popcorn and stuff. I liked the food I would rate it 3.5/5 for the price they charge the only bug is that the burger lacks elements like some veggies and stuff and chicken remains a bit dry but it's ok for the price they charge. They do have quite high packing charge although they give your food in a brown paper bag (they should improve the packing going by the charged price). Overall ok if want a quick snack to bite into.

Ordered chicken burger and egg burger. Yes it is cheap in price. But cannot be compared with THE KFC!! From the very first bite one can feel that this burgers are from any roadside stall.
The chicken burger contains crispy fried chicken chunks which tastes nice. But it lacks lettuce, onion and fresh mayo. In spite there was a mixed sauce of ketchup and mayo which had made the burgers sweet on taste. The same is applicable for egg burger as well.
But according to the price it is ok.

The local KFC is here, apart from what it suggest from its name, it also makes some good veg burgers, tried it twice, the bun was different in both the case, one hard and the other time soft as used generally. The patty is perfect and so is mayo, hope to find some visible about of Vegetables with the burger.
Fries are spice quoted and very less in quantity, you can count it, so make sure you order two portions of fries atleast.

The substitute for KFC on a low budget. The egg burger actually tastes better than the chicken burger over here. The fried chicken is decent and chicken popcorn is good. But if you're a fan of KFC food you would not be very pleased.

I had ordered food from Kolkata Fried Chicken yesterday. I had a Combo which came with a Chicken Burger, French Fries and Thums Up. Along with that, I had Chicken Strips and Chicken Popcorn.
All the items tasted great! They use a little bit extra mayo in the burger which might be a turn off. But the others were too good. Would love to order food from here again. Tastes better than Kentucky one at a lesser price.

Ordered Chicken Burger w/ Cheese, French Fries and Chicken Popcorn. Delivery was prompt taking into consideration the fact that it was Durga Pujo.Food is very cheap and taste is good.The burger buns were a bit damp. Good quality of meat and food otherwise.Will definitely order again.

NOT AS EXPECTED. -_-

Friends had come to my house so planned to have fried chicken...bt KFC (the actual one) was too far , and we had no intentions of going out...so thought of trying its Namesake .... KFC (Kolkata Fried Chicken).... Going by the reviews thought it would be a good option . Ordered it through another food delivery app.... The service was good though !
Now coming to the food "not as expected" .... Though u cant expect to get diamond at the cost of coal . Indeed its cheaper , but quality and taste wise it didnt excite my taste buds . Some of the pieces were a bit raw , atleast the raw smell suggested the same and too salty in terms of seasoning . The quantity was very good . 8 pc @ â‚¹270 . 4 - legs & 4 - thighs .

Worth an one time try , however not highly recommended .


Happy Pet Puja ^_^

This place is near my house and they serve some good snacks to satiate the cravings for burger. The burgers are tasty, though a big small in size but taste wise very good. It is very reasonable. A good substitute for the actual KFC. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜‹

Ordered from this joint today via a food ordering app. We had placed the order for two Chicken Burgers, one Chicken Burger with French Fries and Coke combo and one portion of Chicken Popcorns. The burger tasted very good but only compliant is that they had added too much ketchup in the mayo which made it sweet in taste. The Chicken Popcorns were too small  but the taste was surprisingly good and it was very crispy as well. So overall one of the best pocket friendly substitute of Kentucky Fried Chicken in howrah. Way to go KFC-kolkata fried chicken. ðŸ˜Š

Excellent food at cheap rate......
The thing that lacks here is manpower and proper seating arrangement.
The packaging isn't good as it's wrapped only in low quality paper napkins.

Awesome food at a cheap price. Good amount of chicken. Fried chicken looks small portion in the given picture but it's alarge portion. Tried chicken wings (5/5) and fried chicken (4/5). Ordered via swiggy and delivered before expected time. Nice experience.

Though there is no seating arrangement, it's undoubtedly the best option for pocket friendly chicken delicacies in Howrah. Swiggy/Zomato integration and tasty foods makes it a great option

The fries were properly fried and salted. 
The burger sauce was Mc Donald's minus some spices. 
The most fun part is the cost, I got a chicken burger, fries and 250ml coke for 120, home delivered.
