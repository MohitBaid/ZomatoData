I went to this place a month ago it was a good restaurant open in Sodepur hb town...the price is reasonable..we try a veg Hakka chowmin, chicken Momo and a plain dosa...the chowmin is good in quantity as well as quality..chicken Momo was also tasty..but the south indian dish(dosa) was little disappointing...so it was a ok trip to go and eat there...

I went to this place last month. This place is a gem of north Kolkata. The ambience is soo cozy and the people there were so like family. As my husband loves South Indian dishes, we ordered Dosa and it was amazing. It was soo good n affordable that I wanna visit this place again n again and would like to try theirÂ Newly started Indian dishes as I am a Biriyani freak..:P. Love this place n their food. This place made our day more special. This place is highly recommended.

I simply didn't like this restaurant and there are certain reasons why.
First, you walk up to a hotel, seeming all fine and happy about the meal you're gonna get, but you have waiters taking orders from you who don't have any idea what the food is gonna be.
Second, they have 2 ACs in their restaurant but they care to switch on the only fans which is going to serve two tables by swinging left and right.
Talking about the actual food now:
I ordered veg fries rice and vegetable manchurian balls. The order came after 30 mins. 
The veg fried rice had no flavour whatsoever. I tried putting pepper powder and salt over it to get some taste as it was pretty bland, but the little container in which they kept the salt had blocked holes so the salt won't fall no matter how hard you shake it. So I asked for another little container of salt and there was the same condition as the previous one. Also the salt was wet so it won't fall through the holes of the container. 
Well if you have a restaurant that big you should take care of all these small things.
Now comes the vegetable manchurian balls. Well the balls were pretty soft but the gravy was too sweet, I mean it was really like they mixed corn flour in tomato ketchup. There was a clear taste of tomato ketchup and no other flavour whatsoever. There were neither scallions or any other seasoning in the gravy. Ohhh but there were huge stems of coriander in the gravy that just didn't go with the taste.
I literally felt as if I was wasting my money on pretty tasteless food.
Although I had tried their dosa once and it was horrible too. The sambhar they serve is just too much. How can someone make such a weird tasting thing.
Anyways I like their dahi vada. I think it's the only item I'll ever order from them.
Anyways these are my opinions, if you like this restaurant, well and fine, its your money and it's upto you how you wanna spend it.
