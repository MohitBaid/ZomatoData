Just wanted to try this place..decor is quite quirky. Love what they did to the small place.. when we entered sunny deol was stomping in the led tv fixed in front of us.. staff were fine..service was a bit lagging.. located near trikon park in beliaghata.. food was not nice at all.. chillichicken was ok but the chowmein was so below standards..bland bad..ughh.. this place does have the potential to be the the next student hangout or the end of the month "paisa kam hai "hang out... but they  have to improve the food a lot.. may i suggest diversifying the menu a bit more..have to try the sandwhiches next time..will surely update if the experience is nice

If you are really very hungry and don't have enough money to go for a well known cuisine you can go here. It's a very pocket friendly place near Beliaghata.
Quality of foods are not so good.
No mughal dishes are available here. Only chinese.
