A quait little bakery...but actually a gem. One of the best places to go to if you have a sudden sweet-tooth craving. The bakery does not have a seating area, so we usually have to stand and eat...the only disadvantage...but worth it for the desserts served. Have been here a number of times and have tried out a variety of their pastries.

Macarons - (5/5) One of their best products and a must try if you go here. Tad overpriced (Rs. 75) for the portion is small....but the taste is worth every penny. My personal favourite is the Salted Caramel!

Profiterole - (4.5/5) The only place to serve profiteroles, a french pastry. Its basically a choux pastry filled with custard. It's very good...the custard being fresh and very light. It's my second favourite here (Rs. 45) and a giod option for all non-chocolate lovers.

Chocolate Mudpie - (4/5) They heat up the pie slices before serving and you are left with a crispy pie shell with gooey warm chocolate filling. Its absolutely delicious and all chocolate lovers must try it.

Chocolate Concorde - (3.5/5) A layered dessert which is chocolate based. Again, it is overprice (Rs. 110) but pretty good.

Blueberry Cheesecake - (1.5/5) Very bad! Definitely not your conventional blueberry cheesecake. It was more like a mouse cake. The taste of cream cheese was lacking and the blueberry flavour overpowering! Do not buy this if you are a cheesecake lover.

Lemon Meringue - (3.5/5) A refreshing change from all the other chocolate pastries...more like a palate freshner. The tangy lemon filling is fresh and delectable. Another good option for non-chocolate lover!

Trio Mousse - (3/5) Another chocolate based dessert with a hint of dark chocolate. Quite Nice!

Prices are exclusive of GST (18%). Their pound cakes are more expensive than other bakeries like Kookie Jar or Cakes. But overall, a very promising bakery...well on it's way to becoming one the greatest dessert joints in town!

The food looks yummy but tastes very bad. I had ordered raspberry and blueberry cheesecakes. The cheesecakes taste like curd and jam. The base is made of digestive biscuit I guess and tastes terrible. It has no butter in the crust I guess. It was one of the poorest cheesecakes that I have ever tasted. I won't order ever again.

I had been waiting forever to visit this place. Having read up all about it on Zomato, I was counting my days before I could finally visit this cake and pastry outlet. Located on the first floor, this outlet can easily be missed unless you are using GPS to locate it. They have a competitor located on the ground floor which has a far jazzier window display. Anyway, reaching the shop on the first floor, I was slightly disappointed that they did not have a seating area. They had a display of all their items and cakes and a number of cakes in display on the window as well. The ones for actual eating were kept in a temperature controlled cupboard. I will be honest, the cakes looked better in the pictures. However, I was happy after tasting a few of them. The profiteroles and the mini lemon meringue pies were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The blueberry cheesecake was excellent thought I would have liked a slice of it instead of having it in a glass. The raspberry cheesecake was a bit underwhelming even though the price was more. The raspberry gel on top was rubbery and didn't add to the dish. The mudpie pastry was delicious, not overly sweet. The trio mousse too sweet and not a favorite. The prices were on the higher side. 80/- to 125/- was the range of most of the items that we ordered. The mini pies and profiteroles were 45/- a piece. I will definitely go back for them, they were so delicious!
Definitely wish they would start a seating area and refill the items that finish a bit more quickly. Really wanted to try the lemon meringue eclairs and the salted caramel tart but they were over by 5 in the evening!

No proper sitting area. They should atleast have some stools. They offer you a very small variety of pastry. They suggested us two pastries and we did not love them at all. But some pastries were really nice and mouth watering.

I was surfing the Zomato App for the best cake shops in Kolkata and there it was. This had a whooping 4.1 rating. I made up my mind to visit this place. Since I didn't have time to pre order a cake, I had to pick up from the available range displayed at their outlet. It's a very comfy place and the men at the reception desk were very friendly and cooperative. I chose a Chocolate Belgium Hazzlenut Cake for my parents silver anniversary. The cake was very yummy, the chocolate melted in the mouth, the nuts seasoned at the top gave a nice crunch to the cake. It had the adequate sweetness. Everyone at home really loved it. It really made the day for my parents.

There are few things or moments which leaves a special mark or spot in your mind and whenever you recall those imageries, you tend to relish it with a happy  smile. Little Pleasures had made a similar mark in my life and memory. It was my mother's birthday and i wanted to gift her cute yet elegant pastry. Little Pleasure was my ultimate destination. 

Decor wise this bakery shop is beautiful. The place is almost near to Wokaholic. The person who was handling all these sugary delicacies was very humble,polite and courteous. Each and every item were a visual treat to the eyes. They looked pretty yet sophisticated and possess their own dignity.

I purchased their mudpie pastry and eggless nougat pastry. Packaging was quite nice. Now coming to the flavour, divine is the only word that comes to my mind. The MudPie pastry was smoothe and sinfully chocolatey. The floral chocolate smoothly melts when it gets touched with the heat of your mouth. The Nougat Pastry was irresistible on the other hand. The choco ball oozes out caramel which transports you to heaven. Both the desserts were rich and evenly balanced. My mom absolutely loved and also requested me to bring them againüòÅüòÅ. Thank you so much for bringing a smile on my mom's face.

The best patisserie in Kolkata hands down!!! The decor, the design and quality of the goodies on offer are excellent. It's easy to understand that high quality ingredients are used. I've also ordered cakes from Little Pleasures that's been a hit with family and friends. They also like to do the impossible with their cakes making cake cars that actually move and floating cakes that I saw at an event... I highly recommend little pleasures to satisfy your sweet tooth...

Food creativity: 4/5
Food taste: 4/5
Order handling: 5/5
Overall: 4.3/5

This time, thanks to my request, they really notched up the order handling process and delivered exact contents of the order placed by me. Thanks Little Pleasures team for your pro-activity.

Now, coming to the order that I placed.

1. Chocolate Salted Tart: What can I say? I instantly got in love with this delectable product the last time I ordered that this time I demanded 3 pieces of 'em. And God, they are oh so delicious, I started licking the chocolate stain off the cover with my tongue voraciously. That's how good it is..!! The chocolate portion and the texture is well balanced topped with the majestic white chocolate egg crowned on top of it that oozes out the white custard when slightly cracked..!! A perfect climax to stun your taste buds.

2. Profiteroles: Again this weensy bit of chocolate wonder is self-satisfactory that doesn't need much explanation.

3. Eggless Nougat: The pastry is a triangular shaped semi-solid biscuit-y base that contains a pool of chocolaty goodness with the right texture and flavor.

4. Molten Brownie Pie: The name itself describes the dessert. The outer layer is a molten veil of chocolate enveloping the cake with a circular chocolate bush on top.

In a nutshell, CHOCOLATE is the main hero in all of the above specialties that really pops out both in appearance and flavor. This joint is a must for all those with sweet tooth who craves chocolate like a nightmare. A must for all to relive the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory fantasy.

Best Regards and Wishes to Little Pleasures team. Keep it Up..!!

Can't rate the food without tasting it. Why am I still writing a review? Well, these people decided not to deliver the order placed at all, even though the delivery professional was already at their doorstep. Fine if you don't want to talk to customers in case of a miscommunication and clear things up. Why did you even bother to open a shop then?

You can't buy Pleasures but you can buy a pastry or a dessert from Little Pleasures and that's kind of the same thing.Located in Loudon Street this place is a key player.I have ordered online from there,have tried their Eggless Blueberry Cheese cake,it's amazingly tasty and wonderful,highly recommended.Profiterole is yummy.Trio Mousse is sweetly decorated dessert which pleased my heart,toothsome and tantalizing.Parcel is well packed.Next time will try their cakes and macaroons.Absolutely recommended place for dessert lovers and the name is also justified.I feel there is nothing more mesmerizing for a foodie than getting a perfect dessert.

Frankly, I am yet to visit the shop but I did order online and I was apprehensive but I was rather impressed. The packaging was excellent and the delivery was speedy. I would highly recommend the Trio Mousse with three layers of dark chocolate, white chocolate and milk chocolate sponge topped with half a macaron covered in gold dust. Absolute heaven! It won't pinch your pocket much, seeing as we shell out a good sum for a decent bakery. You can order customized cakes with your choice of fillings and icings and theme if you prefer. A must try for a sweet tooth!

I had ordered few items today and I had to write this review today only!!! The desserts were just fabulous.
Stayed in Europe..once back in India the only food I really missed was some comforting desserts from some patisserie. But this outlet ended my search. Really impressed by the quality and taste of the desserts. Below is the detailed review of what I ordered today.
1. Profiterole. It was perfectly baked. The custard inside was so yummy. Brilliant . And too good.
2. Lemon meringue pie . Cudnt have asked for better flavour. The meringue was fluffy and not too sweet. Perfect.
3. Chocolate caramel tart. The caramel sauce placed inside a white chocolate egg was to die for. Tart was good. See attached image.
4. Hazelnut Swiss role. Soft ..not too much of cream ... adequate . Loved it.

The packaging was also very classy and nice.
Totally recommend this place and will keep on adding up to the item reviews once I order them.
Kudos to the Baker. Keep up the good work.
The food can easily be comparable to any nice bakery and Paris.

Their signature lemon tea cake is a must try along with their macaroons , eclairs and profiteroles . The only downside is no place to sit and enjoy the treats . You've gotta takeaway !!

When it comes to a dessert in mind the name LITTLE PLEASURES only come . It is one of the finest deaaert place in kolkata located in the heart of the city KOLKATA . Located on the 1st floor the place is quite cozy but the desserts over there are mouth-wattering . They provide a wide range of different cupcakes macaroons and designer cakes on order . Price is comparitive good . But u wont find anything like chocolate cake or pineapple or any other saviour over there . As it is famous for there dessert u would find something interesting like there famous lemon tea cake and chocolate belgium pastry . I had both and find it quite unique and intersting . Loved this place a lot . 

Food - 4.8/5
Service - 4.6/5

Interior is beautifully furnished with dainty decorations and an ornamental finish.
The pastries and cakes on the shelves look absolutely gorgeous, such that one would only want to keep on admiring them.
Bought the French bluebeery cheesecake, raspberry cheesecake, eggless pastry and chocolate trio mousse for my sister's birthday.
The cheesecakes were pure, fresh and authentic while the chocolate confections were delicious.
Those with a sweet tooth can surely try out their offerings to enjoy the "little pleasures!"

The d√©cor of the place is so soothing lime green and white with beautiful cake dummies. I loved the place only bug was the unavailability of seating area (much needed) so that dessert becomes more enjoyable. I tried varieties of dessert. Lemon meringue eclair and tart, salted caramel tart, hazelnut Swiss roll (not recommended),choclate trio, mud pie, etc . I did not like Swiss roll and the lemon meringue tart and eclair are 5/5 (must try). Do pay a visit.

They tend to run low on stock, so make sure you go earlier in the day. Returning another day if you missed out, is totally worth it though.

Secondly, had ordered a mudpie and what was delivered was a truffle pastry. Thirdly, lemon meringue pie was very small in size, one bite sized. The only good thing about the order was the little green box in which the pastries were delivered

Dropped by this cute little patisserie located in Loudon Street.Google maps came handy to find this place which is a must visit for all desserts lover out their.Its located on the second floor of a building.There were so many beautiful desserts on the counter that I felt like having them all.But since I was alone that would've been too much.So I settled for few light sweet treats.

‚Ä¢Profiterole-The choux pastry was perfectly puffy and had that golden brown hue on the outside.The dark chocolate glaze on the above was shiny.
The cr√®me p√¢tissi√®re filling on the inside was smooth,oozing out slowly(not being too runny which is good) and wasn't overly sweet making it a perfect cr√®me p√¢tissi√®re.

‚Ä¢Lemon meringue tart(mini)-This dessert have been recommended by my fellow foodies here.After a bite into it I understood why.This is one of the best dessert I've ever tasted.The tart shell was crisp,so short and flaky that it was falling apart in my mouth.The meringue on top with blowtorched tips had a perfect sweetness quotient that it helped to elevate the beautiful lemon flavour from the curd filling.The lemon curd had that perfect tang which just sings on your palate and cleanses it with its freshness.

‚Ä¢Lemon meringue √©clair-I was so elated with the lemon meringue tart here that instead of going for a chocolate based desserts I couldn't resist myself from ordering another lemony one.The oblong √©clair made from choux pastry is filled with the beautiful lemon curd same as that in the tart with frosting comprising of blowtorched meringue.Every bite was like a party in my mouth.

I am surely going to come back here to taste the other variants of delicious looking desserts.

Located somewhere in Loudon Street,Little Pleasures was a bit difficult to find for me. But the many recommendations for their desserts made me find this place on New Year's Eve. It's a cute little bakery with simple decoration apt for a bakery. The items are expensive for sure!!!! But trust me they are delicious to the core. You will not regret spending the money. I had the following items:
Eggless Nougat
Profiterole 
Hazelnut Macaroon
Blueberry Cheesecake in a cup
Lemon Meringue Pie (Mini)
Chocolate Trio Mousse 
All of the desserts were spot on. Taste and presentation both were awesome. M not a fan of custard and lemon flavour in general but I put that out of my mind with regards to these desserts. The chocolate Trio Mousse and the eggless Nougat in particular were amazing. Must visit place!!

I visited them on Christmas to bring home some desserts for my family. The mudpie pastry is a must try! It is chocolaty and gooey! The triple chocolate mousse was also very nice and i totally loved the Belgian macaroon. This was the first time I tasted a macaroon and i totally loved it. One should definitely give this place a visit if one has a sweet tooth.

Oh my gosh! This is going to be a really 'sweet' affair to remember ,what a pleasure it was dig into the gooeey , chocolatey ,sinfully sweet box of goodness from little pleasures located on loudon street. The triple chocolate mousse topped with a golden macaron was to die-for. The luscious dark chocolate cake topped with a chocolate flower was a feast to the eyes and taste buds. I love the texture of their macarons with a zesty lemon curd filling .you must try their mini chocolate eclairs,they can easily beat the master french patissiers. Good going 'Little Pleasures' .will keep visiting for many more delectable delights.

Location-Loudon Street,Kolkata.

This place was bookmarked by us few months back and today after having lunch at a restaurant nearby we went to this place for some dessert takeaway.

Though the place is named "Little pleasures" but their dessert gave us some great pleasures indeed.The whole place has been given a classic look.Though the varieties were limited but each of them was an outofthe box creation.We had-

1:Eggless Nougat-This pastry was our first choice for the takeaway.It looked so beautiful and being an eggless dessert it just had to be in our box.It tasted excellent and those caramel balls in the pastry was just a taste enhancer.

2:Belgian macaron-It was the first time we had tasted a macron and its taste was just a blissing for us.The melted chocolate in it and semi-hard shell outside just complimented each other.

3:Molten Brownie Pie piece-I wanted to try this from a long time after seeing it on their zomato cover photo.It tasted excellent and is a must try

What a delicious affair it was to experience the cute little dessert delicacies from the Little Pleasures! 
Firstly I loved the look of the entire box and the entire presentation of the desserts. One by one unfolded the desserts; all of them were one-of-its-kind.
The Berry cheese cake with vanilla cream and a chocolate slice as a topping worked wonders on me! It was amazing.
Next was the Triple layered Mousse which in its chocolaty taste  and creamy finish enchanted the taste buds indeed.
The next and the best in my box was the Mudpue Flowery Pastry presented with a flowery chocolate topping which oozed in the rich chocolaty taste!! Yumm it was indeed. 

I am definitely coming back to this place to try the other stuffs in their juke-box! Enchanting it was!

I have been trying to find an occasion to eat from here since the last time our family friend got a cake from here for my dad's birthday and what is a better occasion than Christmas to order some. 

Had a chocolate orange mousse cup, which is one of my favourite combinations and oh god, it was so so so amazing! It even had a layer of orange jelly on the top which I was NOT expecting! Had the trio mousse cake as well which was delicious and you could taste the 3 different types of chocolate in it as well. 

All in all, great desserts! Presentation wise as well, I'll soon be eating more from here, have heard a lot about their lemon tarts from my friends. 

Additional benefit was that the desserts looked amazing so I had the chance of doing an elaborate photoshoot :P, I shall upload the photos soon enough on zomato as well as Instagram. 

For photos of where I eat in Calcutta and other cities, follow me on Instagram! (Same name as here)

My friend got me some pastries from here as a Chirstmas gift!

I loved the triple chocolate mousse. Very light and fluffy!

Lemon meringue tart : This was so good! And those meringue dew drops which were blow torched were golden and delicious!

Mud pie : dense, rich and gooey! Loved it.

The treats were so tempting that I forgot to click pictures. However, visually each one of the items scored full marks!

I was waiting to visit the place for a long time though,  and finally i was lucky enough to get a gift from this awesome place.  
 As the name suggests *Little Pleasure* and its more than a little.  

I have tasted the 

Tripple Chocolate Mouse ,  Belgian truffle,  Profiteroles and MudPie .  

*Tripple Chocolate Mouse : Very nice.  A little Surprise of   tastes in every layer. Very appealing and toothsome.  

Belgian Truffle :
 My Personal Favorite. Because why not?  
The thick and full flavoured truffle covered with ganache.  

Profit e Roles - Dipped in chocolates this was light wuth custard within it.


Mudpie - 
Delicious and Inviting.  Rich in taste and 
Tastes very nice. Loved it. 
 

One of the better bakery Shop you will ever finf the city.  Its Christmas season,  have a visit and provide yourself some little pleasure.

I was lucky enough to have tasted the amazing desserts from this place! 

*Profiterols with lemon custard- The profiterols were of the perfect texture. It was light and dipped in chocolate. The custard within gave the perfect punch to this little piece of joy. 

*French Macaroon- I had the lemon macaroni which was light and delicious. 

*Triple chocolate Mousse: This is my personal favourite from the lot, a big thumbs up ! The mousse was a melt in the mouth. 

*Lemon Meringue Tart- The tart was perfect and well rolled out. The lemon curd gave it a nice tang. The meringue on top was airey and light. 

*Belgian Truffle : The truffle cake is eggless and absolutely delicious. It's covered by a not too sweet chocolate ganache. Just the way I prefer it. 

I would certainly recommend this to everyone. Go make your Christmas sweeter with the Little pleasure they provide !

I was lucky enough to try out this bakery this season. And as the name suggests it actually offers amaaazing things.
I have tastes their ‚ú¥triple mousse cup , and that my friend is the ultimate. The bitter chocolate, the thin cake layer and rich mousse.. you get all of it in that cup.
‚ú¥mudpie pastry again, is mind blowing. The portion is decent enough and filling, rich and tastes lovely. It is a chocolate bash in you mouth. Loved it.
‚ú¥ Lemon macaroon had that lemony taste in it pretty much and does justice to it being called a macaroons.
‚ú¥ Profit e role - this was a surprise indeed. It is a bread role kind of thing, stuffed with cream cheese filling. And it oozes out generously with every bite. Man was this amzing or not!!
‚ú¥Blueberry cheesecake cup - you want cheesecake you have cheesecake in just the right amount, in you hand in a cup. The crumble layer, the cream cheese filling , and the tangy blueberry jelly on top. So blissful.

It is Christmas time. You won't find a better bakery in town to do justice to the season. Enjoy, cheers :)

I was lucky to spot the cute stall set up by Little Pleasures at the Farmer's Market - P.C Chandra Gardens.¬†
They serve quality desserts which are way better than most of the popular big names in the market.
Tasted a Chocolate Mud Pie which was undoubtedly the best I've had so far.¬†
Had another dessert made with fresh cream and strawberries. It was really different and better than the regular boring desserts that ¬†we have.¬†
Prices may be on the higher side but you will not regret spending a few extra bucks for such a great dessert experience.

Little Pleasure is one of the best desserts place you will find. I went to their stall at Farmer's Market in PC Chandra Gardens to try their Pastries.
First the Chocolate Mudpie Cake which we had was very fresh. Thick chocolate and the cream that was served was so fresh. Each bite of it was brilliant.
Secondly we tried the Assorted Pastry platter. Fresh Strawberries inside and Fresh cream above.
Each of their products Quality is very very good.

Located right beside the Shakespeare Sarani police Station - first floor of a bldg. In a word, just felt like a dream world on stepping inside the bakery - a true classy ambience of a swiss bakery. Not only its a boutique bakery rather i would say is a bakery design studio with amazing themed multi tiered wedding cakes stacked in a separate glass¬† room just beside their sales counter. Their ambience will definitely draw attention of every visitor to capture snaps.Tried their trio mousse topped with macaroon, blue berry cheese cake, Lemon Meringue Tart which tasted very delicious. The best lemon tart i ever had.

Visiting Little Pleasures certainly gave me a great deal of pleasure. Its an absolutely charming places that serves up some delicious stuff. I was lucky to be able to spend time on my very first visit with the gracious Shripriya , the force behind Little Pleasures and ¬†I was impressed with her passion and dedication. We sampled a number of the wonderful products on display including Profiteroles , Mud Pie , Chocolate Caramel Tart and Lemon Meringue Tart. The Profiteroles were gorgeous and I loved them , certainly the best I have had in the city. The other winner was the Chocolate Caramel Tart .... loved the little surprise touch of the white chocolate egg on top filled with caramel sauce, The mudpie was simply sinful and if you love chocolate as much as I do then your transported ! ¬†The Lemon Meringue Tart was delicate and subtle and I enjoyed it. A couple of weeks later the management was kind enough to send across a box of goodies for tasting. The Profiteroles were outstanding again but I also got to sample the Cheese Cake which was very nice and the Trio Mousse which I really liked. Can't wait to go back and sample more of their delicious fare. If you have a sweet tooth this place is guaranteed to brighten up your day.

Thanks to my exams, the review for this place is long overdue! I went there on the 9th of September and tried a few of their beautiful looking treats! 

The decoration is just lovely! You seem like you're in a different parlour altogether! I loved the beautiful displays and tiny rooms and everything was just right! 

They don't have any seating options but that's okay. Though I would have loved to sit and just be there amongst beautiful looking deliciousness! 

I tried the following :

Lemon Meringue Pie : This was my top priority for trying and I was thoroughly impressed. I found it really delicious and it certainly looked like a million bucks! My friend liked it too but not as much as I did. So what I understood from her opinion was that if you don't like lemon curd (which I do like!) then this is not the best choice for you! 

Chocolate Tart: Now this is something that both of us loved! This was a heavenly tart which had one of the best chocolate filling I have ever tried! There was an underlying hint of coffee which just elevated the dish by a couple of notches! 

Egg less Nougat: Another wonderful creation! The Nougat was just perfect! Loved the texture and feel of the dish as a whole! Must try for the chocoholics! 

So, all of this came to 280 rupees which was pretty reasonable for the quality. I would love to be back and try out their other creations! 

Definitely recommend this place to all. Do drop by to try out some culinary delights!

My run up to the pujos were made a tad bit sweeter courtesy the beautiful and cute dessert box sent to me by little pleasures. The box itself was really pretty and I loved the hue and the gold lettering.
Coming to the contents it had profiteroles, cheesecakes, a mousse and tarts.
The profiteroles were amazing! One of the best in the city, the creamy gooey insides is absolutely melt in your mouth goodness complementing the soft chocolate dipped pastry outside.
The trio mousse again was an absolute winner. It was just the right amount of sweetness and chocolatey bitterness blended together for the perfect sin.
The cheesecakes were one strawberry and the other blueberry. The strawberry one was more flavoursome than the blueberry one. But both the cheesecakes could have been so much better if there was a bit more crumb below. 
The lemon meringue tart had a really soft and luxurious exterior but unfortunately the meringue was a tad too dense bringing down the dish as a whole.
Finally the salted caramel tart was another great dessert with a beautifully crafted white chocolate egg oozing caramely goodness. Beautiful!
P.s. the trio mousse turned turtle during delivery and led to some missing/messy pictures. :p

Little Pleasures definitely knows the art and serves really good desserts. I had recently tasted some of their preparations and loved them all.

Profiteroles - these were excellent and had well balanced flavours with a lovely cream custard inside.

Salted caramel tart - I loved the looks but felt it to be  a bit too eggy thus would avoid it.

Trio mousse - liked the mousse. It was a bit dense but flavours seemed well balanced and a layer of cake gave it some nice grainy touch. 

Cheesecakes - Loved the blueberry cheesecake compared to raspberry one. They were both pretty good but would have liked them even more if they were a bit more cheesy.

Lemon meringue pie - it was nice and flavourful but am not a lover of lemon in desserts so I did not relish it as much.

Overall , I am definitely in love with his place , would love try out their other items too !!

So we received a gift from this place which consisted of Mississippi mud pie and mini muffins. The mud pie was dark chocolate flavoured, my favourite. It was very rich, ready and the cake was soft. It was really, a very decadent dessert. The mini muffins were okay and had a chocolate filling inside them. They were really soft but eggless and the amount of sugar was just right. Hoping to try out this place on my own soon !

The goodies came packed in a beautiful magenta box which was inside a large clear plastic bag, courtesy Little Pleasures. All extremely smart and clean looking. A small handwritten note was on the box.

The contents were equally pleasing. I started with the Lemon Meringue pie, a lightly flavoured combination of crisp and softness. The Profiteroles were done right, not overly creamy like some places. The Salted Caramel Pie and the Mudpie Pastry were nice and gooey, though I found one of them (cannot recall which ) a tad dry. The Trio Mousse went down well too. The Raspberry Cheesecake was, though, not cheesecakey enough. I like it more cheesy and less sweet and tangy, more like the baked ones.

Their stuff is pretty, and that adds to the overall experience. Thank you Little Pleasure.

Received this lovely box from little pleasures.  The profiteroles were absolutely  stunning ,  the Bavarian cream in it was silky and the balance of sweetness was perfect.  One of the finest I've had in a long time.  Next was the salted caramel  tart.  The ganache was stunning and the salted caramel egg was beautifully tempered.  The cheesecake  had a nice tang.  I have not had a raspberry  cheesecake  before,  this was really good.  The lemon meringue was nice,  but I usually prefer more lemon Curd to meringue in the ratio.  

Overall a great place,  rich flavors and a neat presentation .

Knock knock.."here's a delivery for you"! I took the turquoise box with a bit of surprise and found it was from loudon street based dessert parlour Little Pleasures. The box was full of sweet surprises that include Profit e role, Salted Caramel Tart, Lemon Meringue Pie, Chocolate Orange Mousse , Mud Pie Slice and Raspberry Cheesecake. The Mud Pie was damn good and so was the Profit e role... My little pumpkin jumped and took the Raspberry Cheesecake and I hardly had one spoon of that; it was an amazing treat. The Caramel Tart was just perfect and so was the Lemon Meringue Pie which was fluffy and airy with the subtle flavour of lemon. Last but not the least the Chocolate Orange Mousse was addictive. I am going to drop there soon to grab some more sweet delights for sure...

Little pleasures - As their name goes it literally gave me pleasure out of pain. Why I said so? On a rainy evening I was delivered with a lovely box full with desserts at my home when co incidentally I was unwell and resting back at home and after having them I was totally delighted and very much impressed too.

The box contented:

Trio Mousse: Dark chocolate lovers delight. Absolutely a killer to start off which gave me a kick. 

Assorted Macaroon: Chocolate and Vanilla Macroons looked very cute. I am not a Macaroon person so it was average for me.

Signature Lemon Tea Cake: Wow.. Simply one word that came out because I don't prefer strong flavors in my desserts and it was apt. Specially the hint of lemon added is just perfect. #MUSTTRY

Salted Caramel Tart: Caramel filled white chocolate Tart was one of their delicious items which is delicious.

Raspberry Cheese Cake: It looked so pretty than it literally invited me to have it and well it didn't disappoint me at all. Many times the bakeries go wrong with cheese cake and best part is they use very good quality cheese into their products that was evident from the taste.
#Lovely #MUSTTRY

Lemon Meringue Pie: A must have item from them which is absolutely loved by ppl who loves lemon flavor in their desserts.
#Recommended


Lastly I would like to thank Team Little Pleasures and Mr. Irfan for putting in so much of efforts with the service and most importantly the lovely desserts which looked pretty with great taste. Hope you guys keep up the good work and best wishes for future.
Well done!! Much Appreciated :)

Little Pleasures just gave me an uber lot of pleasure.¬†

Putting a bit more effort into creating beautiful desserts can go a step forward and make it an absolutely delightful experience, gorging on them. That is exactly what Little Pleasures did for me. 

A couple of weeks ago, on a rain clad evening; I received a beautiful turquoise box of desserts from Little Pleasures. As soon as I opened the box, it was love at first sight. 

The Macaroons were little medallions of deliciousness. Airy and brittle on the outside and gooey on the inside, succumbing to produce a mouthful of pleasure. The Lemon Meringue pie is tangy and marshmallow-y at the same time and is certain to please all who like lemons in their desserts. The Strawberry cheese cake does not disappoint either. 

The Lemon Syrup Tea cake gave me total GOT feels. Light and syrupy, they make the perfect accompaniments for teas, or post dinner refreshments. I, on the other hand, did not require either of the two occasions to devour this beauty. The candied lemon rind on top was perfect.

The Triple Layer chocolate mousse is airy and creamy at the same time. All the layers are well defined and perfectly complement each other. The addition of the dark chocolate ganache on the top helps to bind the flavours together and gives it that slight hint of bitterness that was much needed. This is an absolute favourite and much recommended.

Another favourite that is going to become a must order for me, every time I drop into the establishment, is the Chocolate and Caramel Tart. The thin biscuit-y crust, the perfect layer of caramel, camouflaged by a spread of decadent chocolate is absolutely divine. The addition of tempered chocolate on top, with a white chocolate candy, yet again filled with caramel resting upon it, makes it a bombshell of a dessert. I could just go on and on. 

Thanks to Little Pleasures for this pleasurable experience.

This place was in my bucket list for a long period of time. Came here with my sister yesterday. Located on Loudon Street, just opposite to the Lohia House on the second floor, the place is easy to locate.It's a cute place with quaint classical decor. Loved the checkered floor and all the furniture with classical motifs. Even the dummy cakes were so cute!They have no place to sit in. Still the staff was kind enough to arrange two chairs for us and allowed us to eat in their cake assembling room. They have ample space to make sitting arrangements. I would suggest if they introduced this, then many like me will be very much interested to come back here again and have pastries over a lovely cuppa.Now, coming to the most important part - the bakes and treats, the reason to pay a visit here. These are what we had -¬†1. Blueberry Cheesecake - It was fantastic. The compote was thick and rich. It was so refreshing. Absolutely loved it.2. Lemon Meringue Pie - Guys, if you visit Little Pleasure, even if you're not a lemon person, you still need to try this. It's just so good. The best meringue pie in the world I have had till date. The meringue had the perfect balance of sweetness and hardness. There is a surprise cream filling inside. And it's so good. Heavenly! You gotta try this.3. Profiteroles - We took one. It was pretty good. The custard filling was delicious, so was the chocolate frosting.4. Macaroons - Hey, this was on the house for us. They were pretty good. We tried the mint chocolate, strawberry, chocolate and vanilla. But I must say that the pricing for these macaroons are a bit high compared to the size and quality. Though we didn't have to pay still I would suggest the management to look upon this.5. Chocolate Cake - It was good. We couldn't finish it as we were too full after eating so many desserts. Got this back home and tried and it was really good. People who have a tooth for dark chocolate, must have this which is not me, definitely.6. Chocolate Trio Mousse - ¬†This was really good. The mousse was light and airy. Very refreshing. Three layers of dark, milk and white chocolate. Loved it totally! We couldn't finish this one too. So got it packed for home.All the desserts except the macaroons costed us 361INR. The portions of one dessert is really large. I think their pricing is pretty good except for the macaroons. Took down points for this and no actual sitting arrangements in general inspite of having so much space and rooms. Otherwise, loved the ambience, the decor and especially the desserts. Looking forward to them introducing 'sit and eat' so that I can come back here again. Cheers to Team Little Pleasures! Happy Dining! :)

Little pleasures is equally cute and weird - the cute part is the fairytale, pastel shade decor with artificial cake props and all, and the weird part is the very disorganised office lay-out with small cubicles locked (and stocked badly) so much so that the place, though big enough, has no seating arrangement. The staff was nice to open up one of the small cubicles for us so that we could sit in one of those huge tables and eat our pastries. And when we were done we were told to clear out our plates - when no such self service sign was up. Like I said, cute and weird !

Last week on a rainy Wednesday evening a beautiful box got delivered to my office from Little pleasures. As they say great things come in small packages! A beautiful blue box was gifted to me for tasting few of their products.
 The macaroons are to die for. Soft and gooey in the centre and crunchy on top. 
The triple layered chocolate mousse was dense and perfectly sweetened.
Lemon meringue pie had a very firm base with a lemon curd and topped and baked with meringue. 
The caramel tart was a delight in my mouth.
The lemon tea cake was perfect. Topped with candied lemon rind it was a explosion of flavour.
The raspberry cheese cake was good but the raspberry needed to be cooked with a tad bit of sugar to fix the taste. It was highly sour for me. 

A definitely go to place for everyone who are huge dessert fans.

A few days back, one rainy night a goodie bag was delivered at my doorstep by Little Pleasures, asking me to 'Take the Pleasures of Life Seriously'.¬† A cute gesture! Here goes my review!

**Lemon Meringue Pie : I'm a fan of the lemon flavor in general and often indulge in a lot of lemon based desserts. In my opinion the pie was quite excellent. The strong lemony flavor was invigorating and the subtle cream blended well. Its a must try.

**Trio Mousse : Another must try, especially if you area fan of dark chocolate. With great consistency, delicious taste and the richness of dark chocolate this dessert really stood out.

Assorted Macaroon :It came in two flavors, chocolate & lemon.¬† This was okish. 

The Triangle Pink Dessert ‚Äì Raspberry Cheesecake : This was a good change from all the lemon and chocolate. It looked enticing and tasted delicious. Very fresh.

Salted Caramel Tart: I tasted as intriguing as it looked - with a white chocolate egg as garnish & caramel oozing out of it. 

**Signature Lemon Tea Cake : SHOW STOPPER Alert. A fresh & mild tea cake with a strong lemon flavor oozing out and topped with some caramelized lemon shavings.¬† This was just marvelous!! The mild flavour of the cake and the string lemon flavor blended well.

Wishing the team all the very best! Kudos guys !

Their macaroons are absolutely delicious. The chocolate pastries are really well done and a treat for anyone tired of weirdly textured chocolate in most bakeries. There isn't much seating area but great place otherwise!

The cakes are always too dry, very sweet & a bit over priced. Most of the time the icing on the cakes feels very powdery in the mouth. Not many places serve Profiteroles and therefore it's the only thing I liked therefore the 2.5

This is completely a good review as it was for a take away..

Their chocolate strawberry cake is really good..had feel of fresh strawberries with chocolate.. But inspite eating the cake after an hour of taking delivery some people in the group felt that it was stale and thus made them feel nauseous.. The positive review only because of the benefit of doubt that the cake might not have been the actual cause though everyone felt so..

The other things we took were a chocolate elcair, profiteroles and chocolate pie... All three where very very average..

The place is over priced and you have to be very careful about the dessert choices as their cakes are good but not a good experience with pastries..

This has become my favorite cake shop in town. Their red velvet cheese cake was outstanding! Yummmmm!!! The best part is the cheese cream they used.

A beautiful den.. It has a feel of one those fancy bakeries. Located near the Shakespeare  sarani crossing, Little pleasures serves mostly cakes (on order) and pastries. The place is beautifully decorated. There is hardly any sitting area so it is mostly meant fr take aways. I totally relished the swiss roll. Had to take it twice. All the pastries are priced nearly at inr 100.

I had visited Little Pleasures outlet a year back and my experience wasn't very pleasant. I remember feeling a bit disappointed with their portion sizes and corresponding prices.
However this review is based on a box I received very recently and I was very impressed with the taste of almost all its contents.
Firstly the box was pretty enough to evoke some excitement, love the shade of blue. Then the contents did look delightful. The box contained - two Profiteroles, two types of Cheesecake cups, One Trio Mousse, One Salted Caramel tart and a Lemon Meringue Tart.
The Cheesecakes was decent, one being Strawberry and another Blueberry. I liked the Strawberry Cheesecake better which had more balanced flavour but the Lemon meringue tart was a bit too sweet, and I would have preferred a bit more tang in it.
The Salted Caramel tart was really nice, to look at and the eat. There was an egg on top made of white chocolate which when split open have a dollop of salted caramel inside. I loved how the salted caramel stood out when tasted with the white chocolate. The tart itself was rich and chocolaty which can never go wrong for me.
The profiteroles too were very impressive. Soft and fluffy on the outside with rich filling inside. I could go through hundreds of such profiteroles they were so delicious.
My favourite however was the Trio Mousse because I don't remember the last time I had such smooth and rich mousse with no lumps in it. Reminded me of a Death by Chocolate mousse I used to adore from another store. The mousse was light yet rich and smooth as silk and melted in my mouth.
I shall go back to Little Pleasures to taste the Mousse and profiteroles very soon.Rahul Arora Rukshana Kapadia Tarun Avradeep Datta

First of all i went in expecting really good pastries but unfortunately they did not match my expectations.

Secondly the staff there was a bit rude and told me the strangest thing that i possibly have ever heard. He prohibited me from taking pictures of the pastries i had paid for. I even told him that its for review on zomato and pointed to the sticker they had pasted for reviewing them in zomato. I mean i was really shocked at how is that even possible. Nonetheless i was inside their place and did not really feel like arguing about the matter.

We ordered for the chocolate and raspberry macaroons. The chocolate one was decent and the raspberry was not upto the mark. I am yet to find a macaroon in calcutta worth raving about. 

We also ordered for the oreo cheesecake which was really bad and the mudpie was also average. 

The pricing is fair as we paid about 350 for all the above. But surely id rather buy my pastries from somewhere else. Better taste and better staff.

It's a desert paradise. And I just love their macaroons. It would have been nice if there were some seats there. The decorations truly speak out, wonderful staff. Probably the one of the best desert outlets in Kolkata.

Such a wonderful place, I had reviewed their other outlet earlier and they were really sweet to send me a voucher. The desserts and probably the best in the city and that's saying something for a place like Calcutta. I keep going back here. The smiling staff just adds to the warmth of the place.

Their chocolate mud-pie is to-die-for, actually Little Pleasures excels in any confection they create. The highest quality chocolate is used to create sinful treats. They are also very adept at customizing special occasion cakes, cupcakes and whole dessert tables. You will never leave disappointed

Little Pleasures makes some of the most amazing French desserts you can get in Cal.
Ever since they opened all the desserts and cakes I need are done by them! I can't count the number of times I have ordered their Signature Lemon Cake! Simply love it. There's this little lemon curd that magically appears when you cut the cake... oooooohh.
Some of the other things I know I have received lots of compliments for serving are:
Choc Mudpie, Baked Alaska, Belgian Choc Cake with strawberries and the Profiterole pyramids.

My husband has made me order the hazlenut swissrolls TOO MANY TIMES that too without an occassion. hahaha. But they're Yummmm. Thank god I can simply go to the store and pick up single pieces now. They're too addictive.

Shripriya really takes a lot of personal care and makes sure all her cakes look perfect. I don't think anyone does a better job with personalization. Her sugar craft is on another level. The flowers are so realistic. They simply look amazing - I think that's cause she has good taste herself...so she knows exactly what a modern customer wants. You can leave things to her and you know she'll make you happy.

Lastly but one of the most important aspects....Packaging is OUTSTANDING. Love the green and the blue boxes. Even her simplest box looks really rich. So its great for gifting. She's quite creative with packaging - I've received platters and boxes that have been distributed by her clients.. and they're quite nicely done. There's always something new and creative to look forward to.
Check out her new acrylic cake box! It's a really nice. Recently sent someone a cake in that...and they really appreciated it.¬†

Hmm...after writing all this all I'm thinking about is how I can get my hands on some dessert! :) ...*wink* :)) ¬†Ohh My birthdayy is coming up! Yay!

One place you can find good macaroons in kolkata.limited variety in pastries and cupcakes but they are all very nice even though slightly on the pricier side.  Haven't tried any of the cakes from this place but going by the experience till now should be a safe bet.

I had spotted this place on zomato.. Visited in September with my partner and with lots of ¬†expectation.. picked up macaroons of different flavours. I wouldn't badmouth them, the stuff was okay-ish, not much flavoursome. Seemed a little expensive to me.
A very mixed experience.. a bit disappointed i'd say, considering people are raving about it as the best patisserie in town.

Its located in loudon street. Near yoforia, on 1st floor.
After a suggestion, decided to order a cake from there. Heard about its theme cakes and they some pretty good ideas. 
I ordered a cheese cake, to be honest was little apprehensive, but it turned out to be awesome cake. Very beautiful finish and equally tasty!
They had few more good collectiin, would certainly like to order oother cakes.

Situated on the first floor in Loudon street, this patisserie greets you with mesmerising scent sure enough to tickle your olfactory cells. 

Spread in a good amount of space it offers you a variety of delicacies. Though everything is by the book and fool proof, there are somethings like lemon meringue pie and macaroons that is surely going to melt in your mouth. The pastries are nothing to crave for and beware, Swiss rolls are not even a penny's worth. 

All and all, it seems appeasing but a few amelioration in the menu selection will do good to this place. A few other suggestions will include placing a sign whether the item is a vegetarian one or not. 

I especially like the counter man because he knew what he was selling and was quite confident. A rare quality in these times. Maybe that's all but I don't think I will be planning to go over here again except for the meringue.

I recently bought some pastries from here for a get together. While I personally did not taste all of them I must say that the reviews from all my friends who shared the platter were great. Macaroons, cheesecake, eggless chocolate cake and swiss roll were all excellent. this patisserie is on its way to becoming the best in town. I just wish they had a sit down area to have some coffee and cakes.

The BEST patisserie in Kolkata in my opinion. Their belgian chocolate cake is absolutely divine, as is their lemon cake, which is light and fluffy and puts all other patisseries to shame!
