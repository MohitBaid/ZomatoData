Food was delivered on time. I think he cooking was quite homely and not much spicy. I will definitely look forward to order again.

Very bad experience! This the the first time that radhaballavi came with no sides. it was oily and a bad beginning for a sunday. Over and above the delivery executive was rude as he did not carry change of â‚¹500.

We ordered chicken thali..chicken was well cooked and tasted good..food quantity was above par..a thali can be shared between two persons. We had also ordered parathas and dhokar dalna. Dhokar dalna was a bit mild whichis actually how we loved it. Parathas were crispy. All in all food was good and hygienic. A saviour durig pujas when many restaurants refuse or cancel orders. Loved it.

well there's not much to review here, the home delivery order was just a fish kabiraji, though there was rain the order was late by an hour, when they called to confirm my address they didn't mention any delay because of rain.And,
The Fish Kabiraji i received was cold and a bit oily by the time i received it , it also tasted chewy/rubbery now what you expect to spend 100 rupees for but the accompanying salad was more tasty than the dish.

The food arrived late. It took almost 15-20 minutes extra than the usual 1hr time asked out by Zomato.

But, believe me the food tastes great . Really awesome..
I ordered fish thali.
Included rice steamed.. seddho chaal is been used.
Mushurir dal with pyaz.. tasted good.
Thorer er torkari with bori... Again a great one
Begun vaja..
Fish.. I believe it was an handsome size of Katla.. the gravy was made of sorshe and posto..

I myself cook and loves to do that. So I can say.. yes it tasted great.. everything was just perfect.. nun jhal mosla... The oil was on little higher side.

5 points for satisfying my taste buds..
