This rating is solely for the food quality. I have never had chicken kabiraji this good till date. I don't care about the ambiance for this particular place. It's a part of old calcutta. If you love to have chop cutlet and moghlai porota you should visit here atleast once.

Too much oily (Chicken Kabiraji) and over priced according to the restaurant as well. And if it could be a little bit cleaner ofcourse. Though the presentation was appreciable.

The most authentic moglai paratha center. Very old and small shop. There is not so much sitting space. Located near gariahat more. Moglai Paratha and Fish Fry and fish kabiraji is really good.  A must try.

This is perhaps one of the oldest eateries of South Kolkata. And it's my favourite. Though the place can hardly seat hardly around 20 people at a time in one of the smallest rooms imaginable and even though it's fully packed almost always and a queue is inevitable, the food makes the inconvenience worth it. No matter what you are having it's good. Oily, but good. The kabiraji , cutlets are to die for. So is the kulfi. So if you are not on a strict diet or if it's your cheat day, please do visit this place.

Das Cabin is a small little shop in Gariahat, located beside the Bawarchi and Wow! Momo outlets. The place is very popular their fried food and snacks. The place is almost always crowded every evening and it is hard to find a seat to eat. As we did not find any place to sit, we had to resort to a takeaway. We ordered Fish Fry and Chicken Cutlet. The Fish Fry was very delicious and I loved it. The Chicken Cutlet tasted yummy as well. I would certainly visit the place again the next time I am in the area.

Nostalgia is the word for this place . A small joint near Gariahat crossing with few seating arrangements. I have been visiting this place since childhood. Fish kabiraji is my all time favourite item here which comes with a perfect crispy coating and the yummy fish stuffing inside. Mughali paratha and Mutton kasa are equally good. Last but not the least is their Kulfi , must try. Since it's a very small place you may have to wait in the queue for a while but it's actually worth the wait. Prompt service and the staff is very polite and friendly. Highly recommended.

I went over there on last Friday .I wish to take delivery of two moghlai paratha .The horror show began when I saw the salad and potato carry are being forced into the same envelopes that contain the parathas .When I complained to the manager about this , he completely ignored my concern and his arrogance is just unacceptable .The price they charge for a single moghlai paratha is at least 30% extra than normal rate ,which is unjustifiable .Best thing is to avoid places like Das Cabin .

If you want nice decor with good music and eye catching food this is not your place.But if you want to enjoy some tasty foods at cheap rate welcome to Das Cabin.Its a small place near Gariahat with only few options to look for.We took plain paratha and mutton kasha.Yeah the paratha had too much of oil on top of it but the mutton was soft and juicy.

Some places are nostalgia for us.
Apart from Coffee House,Das Cabin is another very old,not so well furnished food junction but it has the best kabiraji and mughlai I ever had.
Since childhood,I have visited here several times.
Recently, I visited here yesterday after ages.
The place has the same old charm and food is equally good like before.
I had a fish kabiraji.Perfectly crisped coating with soft succulent fish stuffing is my all time favourite.
Also,Special Moghlai paratha and kosha chicken is must have.
I ended my meal with a kulfi.
Service is prompt.
But you may have to wait in a queue to get a seat in this small place of happiness.
Pocket pinch-200/- for two.

Nostaligia Revisited. The place, in the always busy Gariahat crossing does manage to magically rewind time and take you back to pure heritage. Although it has very few seating options, the legendary traits still attracts people who wait in queue to get seated. Muglai parantha, mutton kobiraji and fish afghani are must have when you are visiting this place. The food tastes wonderful and the service is quick and prompt. Highly recommended.

This small eatery located at Gariahat has been serving delicious cutlets, kabirajis, and parathas for decades. Though they are mainly famous for their Mughlai parathas, their kabirajis are equally tasty. But I would mention that recently the taste of these foods has deteriorated remarkably. Last time when we visited the place, we ordered Mughlai Parathas, Fish Kabiraji Cutlet, and kulfi. I have tasted their chicken and mutton cutlets also in the past. Those were also quite tasty. Due to lack of enough space, you may have to share your table with other visitors. So try going there at odd times of the day avoiding rush hours.

Pocket pinch: Rs. 150 for two

Steps away from the ever bustling Gariahat crossing, this small joint can easily be missed by the unaware. But regulars throng this tiny place religiously for their cutlets, kobirajis and afghanis. People have to share tables and this is absolutely not a place where you can sit and have a leisurely chat. Service is prompt, and once you have finished your plate of piping hot, meaty, deep-fried delight, you will be expected to move out immediately to make place for those waiting in the queue outside. And if you are too slow an eater, be ready for displeased glares. I had their Moghlai Paratha and Fish Kobiraji on my last visit and both were sinfully delicious.

Das cabin is one famous stop in gariahat. But personally it's just the name now . You gotta share tables as the space is really small. They are famous for the moghlai paratha but it no longer holds any special taste. Kabiraji was not upto the mark. The only stuff good was the afghani cutlet. Please visit during odd hours to get a table for yourself

I've passed this place innumerable times, however never got the will to sit there and eat. None the less, a friend of mine suggested to try this out and we did as for obvious reasons we were really both hungry and broke at the time.
Okay so, the place is decent. Nothing hyped but quite clean. We had chicken cutlet, kabiraji and kulfi. The service is prompt. Every item tasted really good. And the price was so pocket friendly.

Situated at two minute's walk from GariaHat crossing this place is absolutely retro .They don't have a fancy menue to serve but they are best at what they serve . Moglai Paratha , Fish Fry n Kabiraji fry ,Paratha and Mutton kosha should be given a try . Strangely Moglai was very light and tasty , perfect for quick bite at any time :) Ambience is not great but will give U the vibe of good old Kolkata .

Went here for a post-boimela date.
We ordered one fish fry and one moghlai paraNtha.
The fish fry could have been bigger, given the price. The batter was also thicker than it should have been. Rabindra near Citi Style is a much better fish fry place.
But, the Moghlai Porota more than made up for the fish fry glitch. It was huge, flaky,and crisped to perfection. Paired with the good old aloo'r torkari and salad it was a treat to the taste buds.
You can definitely try this place to get a feel of how our ancestors used to 'date' ;)


P.S. Try to avoid the Afghani cutlet here. Though we did not order it, the couple sharing the table with us did and it was a chicken cutlet drowned in a runny aloo'r torkari that they pass of as Afghani Cutlet. My Club, which is a Gariahat neighbour makes it better.

Although this place is small & unsophisticated, one really can't miss it when passing by due to the waiting crowd outside or due to the attracting smell. Located just opposite the Gariahat Market, Das Cabin has been dishing out Bengali's favourite fast foods like Moglai Parata, Mutton/Chicken Cutlets, Mutton/Chicken Kabiraji, Fish Fry, Mutton/Chicken Kasha, etc. My fav picks from this joint are Mutton Cutlet & Moglai Paratha

It has become kind of a ritual that whenever my mom and I visit gariahat we have to take away mughlai parantha from das cabin. Tbh I have never had anything else other than mughlai parantha from this place so this rating is based only on that. The paranthas are well made and they taste good with loads of stuffing and the potato curry on the side compliment them well. The only down part is that they are too oily but I guess that's how its done.

Das Cabin is located very near to Gariahat junction, just opposite to the flyover. It is a tiny restaurant with simple seating arrangement. The shop owner desk is just on the right side and nothing fancy about it too.The kitchen is behind the seating arrangement and special menu is written on a black board with chalk. So, you will sense retro kind of feel while entering the food joint.

The name "DAS CABIN" is also gives you the trend of sixties and seventies. At that time, so many fast food joints opened in different places in North Kolkata too. Monorama Kabin, Basanta Kabin are some of the famous names. Das Kabin was the most famous and authentic food joint in South Kolkata.

Though, things have changed in this part of Kolkata with so many new age eating joints and food courts, but still Das Kabin is till my choice if I want to have some traditional fast food. I last visited this place with my cousin brother last sunday and we had fish fry and kulpi. And, the taste was simple awesome! In summer days, you can have tasty Kulpi Malai and it feels like a god sent item after an hour long marketing in hot and humid weather.

So, if you are are keen to explore the traditional fast food made in South Kolkata in a retro ambiance, Das Kabin is an automatic choice for you.

I am recommending it.

This mini joint is located at a very accessible location, just beside the gariahat market . I have visited this place for having kulfi for many times. The last time I had visited this place was with my family. 
One has to to wait outside for getting a table on most of the occasions. The staffs are very arrogant. The restaurant is not at all clean. 
We had ordered kulfi, moglai parota and fish cutlet. Kulfi was average in taste and the two other food stuffs were not at all edible.

Strict no no if you are planning for breakfast going with the flow. Upon entering and asking they say everything is available, and when you start to order they "only have butter toast and omelette or just chicken cutlet, yes and tea". Go for it if you are aiming for it, strict no if you wanted to try something else than bread and omelette.
Moving on quality, taste is good but not at all hygienic, which anyway you can't expect while spending so low.

For my 100th review on Zomato I picked out a place that has been immortalised by Anjan dutta in his songs. I kid you not this place is as shabby as it comes and unfriendly too. Right outside hangs a board which says don't sit around drink tea all day,eat pay leave. And eat you must. The chicken kobiraji and the fish kobiraji dipped in slobbering gravy. The moglai porotha has lost its glory but it's still better that a stuffed kulcha nonsense. Those compalaoning about the taste , remember this food isn't best suited for a takeaway.

The legendary cabin culture, a more central- north Kolkata phenomena is fast losing out to the swanky joints serving goodies in fancy bright paper boxes . Das Cabin still standing proud at Gariahat crossing, South Kolkata is all about nostalgia, the kind of place which finds itself in songs written by popular musicians. The tiny place, coloured almost in all blue with basic furniture where you share a table with unknown foodies, has a huge board for a menu. Nothing about this place has changed for years. What defintely hasn't changed is its gastronomic legacy: the dressy Kabiraji cutlet and the regal Moghlai Paratha. Tasty, oily, sinful and irresistible. Its great value for money and a quick takeaway is all you need on a rainy day. To keep the place affordable what has changed is probably the quality of the offering. The loyalists may differ but at similar price points, some people still offer great quality. But never mind. Go there for the nostalgia and the cabin experience at Das Babur Cabin.

This place is located at Gariahat and has been serving  us since long. I have been Das Cabin many a times just for their Moglai Paratha and chicken cutlet. There are many friends of mine who prefer Kabiraji Cutlet but since I do not like the outer covering of a Kabiraji Cutlet with the egg, I prefer and like chicken cutlet.
Such famous this place is that, it came up as a song from Anjan Dutt with the same name.

The city of Kolkata treats us with a dose of nostalgia in every nook and corner of it. One such treat is Das cabin, situated on the lane of anandamela going towards Golpark. A small eatery having seats for max 25 people and serving the city foodies for almost 5 decades. I happen to visit this place with my father today after some long 10 years and found the same people, grown a little old, same sitting arrangement, same aroma of food and definitely the same crowd of demand. I had the legendary Kabiraji paratha and fish fry and it was mind blowing. My tastes buds literally danced tasting every bite of it!!! A genuine recommendation to people for this amazing eatery.

Have been a regular customer since beginning of last year. The place is very small and stingy. Their is also lack of cleanliness in thd cooking as well as the eating section. Coming to the food, this cabin has a very short menu mainly consisting of moghlai, kabiraji and fish fry. Kabiraji and Moghlai is good. Fish fry is NOT good. The items are heavily overpriced too. But overall the food quality is okay.

**Experience**
They are basically famous for their Mughlai Paratha which is still decent in taste and quality. Comparing the quality the price is decently kept and not heavy on your pocket.

This is a very famous place mostly known for their Moghlai. Earlier every time we shopped in Gariahat, we would always eat here. Their Moghlais are delicious though over the years their quality has dipped a little. Still this place has not lost its charm. The prices are very easy on the pocket. If you are broke and want a full stomach, this is the place to be.

A nostalgic place for many, an affordable food destination for others. Located near Gariahat, this is one of the legendary food outlets in this city. Had dropped here only once and unfortunately for me the memory wasn't pleasant. The Chicken Cutlet, which I had ordered for had a foul smell. A sheer disappointment when it comes to the likes of such legendary restaurants, as even places like Golbari, Maloncho and Mitra Cafe has still help up their reputation!

Simply an overrated place. You will get places in Kolkata which serve much better cutlets and kabirajis.
And more to it they run out of chicken items on a Sunday at 630pm in the evening.
There are much better places in Gariahat area only, leave aside Kolkata.

Sir Anjan Dutta - Das Cabin, a song which I heard in the Nostalgic #1996 when I was very small & my dad used to play it in cassette & I just loved it. One of my favourite songs! At childhood I just loved the rhythm, Lyrics partially mukhosto  thakleo lyrics er mane bujhechi onek pore, boro hoye!

...ফিরে ফিরে সাতদিন দাসবাবুর এ কেবিন

কত প্রেমালাপে যায় ভরে

জায়গা নেই যে কোন আমাদের অন্য

তিনশ বছরের শহরে, এই তিনশ বছরের শহরে...

Nostalgia ey ami borabor e beshi rating di! Ebaar eo dilam and I don't regret!

Got a chance to visit this old and much talked about restaurant in gariahat.though the sitting place is very small and clumsy but you not have the time to think about it because of their hot moghlai paratha,fish fry to kabiraji and extremely quick service.whether many people has visited here or not,I am sure this place has visited many peoples heart for ages.

I could even give a -1 if there was an option. This place is a piece of old crap that was left to rot in the middle of gariahat. The fish fry was a small piece of burnt toast. Chicken kabiraji was a fried egg crisps over anything but chicken. And why do they provide blunt knives and forks for? The moghlai paratha had a ton of oil and chewy piece of bull crap. Water was simple tap water,a cockroach paradise and dirty crap! CRAAAP!

Few months back, I was at Gariahat with my sister and both of us were looking for a place to have some food. We found this place just below the flyover and it was crowded. We were looking for budget friendly place and Das Cabin seemed perfect. I had never really heard of Das Cabin before, hence was not sure about their food. 
We ordered mughlai paratha and fish kabiraji. We both liked every single bite of kabiraji. It was not like any ordinary kabiraji. Mughlai paratha was decent too.
Their service was pretty fast. Seating arrangements were just fine, nothing to complaint regarding that.
Overall this place is perfect for some quick bite. Must try is their Kabiraji.

Das Cabin has stood tall at Gariahat More for generations. It still upholds the old calcutta charm with zero decor, simple table chairs arranged in a haphazard fashion. People say it hasn't changed at all since inception.

Im really fond of their Kabiraji, Muglai Paratha and Kulfi. Most gariahat shoppers stop by to try their tele-bhaja. Special mention of their kulfi. Well its delicious and has not changed over the years. Its creamy, pretty big in size and cheap. Its a definite stop on my summer shopping sprees.

Always a packed up place at the junction of Gariahaat.
Mainly a finger food joint.
I often visit this place after shopping in gariahaat :)
My favourite pick up here is fish kobiraaji.
(Kolkata's best kobiraji)
Moghlai is also good.
Kulfi can just beat the heat in summer! Heavenly.

Yesterday I went here for the first time. Looking a long queue in front of the restaurant it drew my attention. Entered and ordered mughlai and chicken cutlet. And I disappointed. Neither of the item had any specialty. Mughlai was just a paratha with egg inside. The potato curry served with mughlai was just boiled potatos. No taste. And cutlet was that much tasteless. You'll find a better item in any roadside stall. Also you have not to pay that much. I'll never go there again.

It is an iconic eatery of South Kolkata and not be missed for sure.

Moglai Paratha-A great preparation with the right amount of spices and seasoning including the aloo. 

Fish Kabiraji-Very crisp and oozing with freshness and flavor.

Kulfi-Great flavor and price

I have rated this place as 4 which is based solely on food. The service staff is very rustic and so is the seating arrangement and atmosphere. We even ended up sharing the table with others as the space inside is inadequate.Prices of all the items are super economical.  All items are hot and fresh and it is best to consume the food here rather than taking it away.

I have been waiting for a long time to visit Das Cabin. It is located in Gariahat. You can see this eatery on the way to Golpark. There is a giant board which gives you information regarding the food and the prices. We had to wait five minutes to get two seats. We ordered mughlai paratha first. The paratha was well cooked. It was served salad and sauce. Ii was delicious. Next, we ordered Chicken Kabiraji. It was served with mustard sauce, tomato sauce and salad. The Chicken kabiraji was very tasty. The only con about this eatery is the water that they serve,which has a layer oil floating in it. I hope to not see this again.

Been visiting this place for a while now. To be precise since high school days the moment we were allowed to go to private tuitions unsupervised. Das Cabin is small shining jewel etched right in between the achar wallas, the fruit sellers, the photo framers on the every busy Gariahaat road. Coming to the food, you can never go wrong when you deep fry something. But to achieve perfection and to sustain the perfection  you will realise is an art once u bite into one of Das Cabins cutlets or fries. My favourites remain the mutton cutlet, the mutton Afghani, the fish fry and the chicken kabiraji. It's better to hit the joint by 7 in the evening on rush hours if you want the entirety of the menu to be available. They also make a delectable Moghlai porota served with a traditional  side of aloor torkari salad and the works. It's a no frills joint . Small and cozy, you come order eat or just do take aways . Oh I almost forgot their kulfis are also the bomb. On some evenings you might not manage to get seats inside as it's crowded to the brim .. so I say hit the joint early or during pujo rush do take aways. All in a this place is close to my heart and I'm craving a fish fry right now.

Today went here with my friends and ordered moghlai, fish fry, chicken kobiraji and afghani cutlet...the moghlai and the kobiraji were really good...however the afghani: chicken cutlet served with piping hot chana curry could have been better and the fish fry a tad bigger...;) Coming to the ambience there's nothing much to write about except that it has a certain traditional feel like the other old restaurants but the interiors are really cramped...overall the food was good and the moghlai is worth trying again...

A small... I mean really small joint of fast food. Just behind the Gariahat market. Easy to locate. 
Visited yesterday after office. It was 8 in the evening and pretty crowded. With around 15 to 16 people siting area, its not comfortable at all.
Coming to the food, 6 to 8 items in three versions of chicken Mutton and fish. We ordered mutton kabiraji.
Served hot with salad and two sauces, well, this Kabiraji failed to impress me surely. 
Taste wise, I frankly couldn't find any. Blunt and non spicy non salty. Avoidable. 
Waiters were like... "have you done eating... Have you finished... What's next to serve you... " continues.

With a meagre bill of 130, we kind of escaped.

Definitely avoiding further.

This is my favourite Mughlai cuisine place. It might have a shabby demeanour, but the Mughlai paratha is unmatched to any top restaurant, which can be easily understood by their huge crowd. It is a really old place,  established pre independence. And you can find all class of people going in and out, because when it comes food everyone relishes good food, huh? Any day can be Das Cabin day. And the best part, the prices! The rich or the poor, it's affordable for all.

After 25 long years I went to Das Cabin today to get Moghlai paratha. The restaurant is just the same. Same old table and chairs. And the same old people. They have just got old. Moghlai paratha has improved no doubt. The medium of cook is good. I can vouch that. But the aloo dum is all the same. No change. Still had to ignore it and just taste the moghlai. A nostalgic feeling for me today

The legendary eatery in gariahat located just beside gariahat market under the flyover. I have been to this place like a million times since my school days. I used to drop in with my mom every time i visited gariahat for shopping. This place is so old, right now its being run by the son of the founder. My mom was a regular to this place in her college days. They make the best mughlai paranthas in this area. And off late from the 90's they have started serving kulfis, which is no doubt another sensation. I have the menu card change from single digits to double but the decor and the employees are still the same. Items are limited but worth trying. Best dishes to try out here will be mughlai parantha, chicken kabiraji, mutton gravy cutlet and kesar kulfi with extra rose syrup.

Its a well known restaurant; situated very near to gariahat more on the way from golpark on the right. It is always overcrowded and expect to wait on queue, even share tables. They have lots on the display, most of which are not available. Paratha and mangsho is their speciality. If you manage to get a place, it's worth the wait. Don't expect any hospitality though ;)

An age old food cabin right beside gariahat market, tiny, just a handful of tables and chairs present. But that menu from whn the city was still called Calcutta, that takes one a long time back.... Food here is undoubtedly pocket friendly n quite OK to taste. Yes, there's lack of ambience and interiors need a lot of work. But a place like this, the sheer humility of it is what makes it stand out. I come here once in a while, and I will keep coming.

Das  cabin is a small and dinghy restaurant just below the garihat fly over. It may be possible for type eyes to miss the spot but your curious nose and salivating taste buds are surely going to pull you there. An old restaurant which serves undoubtedly the best mughlai parathas in garihat and that too a totally reasonable price. I have even tried their chicken kabiraji. Believe me it is surely to die for. Totally recommended for all especially for those shoppers who need to stop over for a bite.

Durga Puja is round the corner , and visiting Gariahat is a must for every shopaholic. Amidst all the street shopping, jewellery shopping, bargaining we are bound to feel hungry and Das Cabin is a perfect place for quick bites. 


 The place is really small with shabby walls and very less light, but you really don't expect much  decoration in a cabin . The Chicken Kabiraji is a must try for everyone especially the mustard rye served with it is amazing. The Kulfi is soft and creamy with the right amount of faluda. Every item on the menu card is affordable and tough I have tried just two items but I am sure the other delicacies are equally good. 

So the next time you are shopping in gariahat , do visit this place.

Carrying year old nostalgia of the Cabin Culture which is relatively more prominent in the northern part of the city, Das Cabin is mostly known to its regulars and on goers for its lip smacking cutlets and kobirajis.

Shabby walls, Old wooden furnitures and insufficient light pretty much make up the ambiance, which is obviously not a factor for those who visit cabins. These cabins are just not meant for sophistication. ( I am also pretty much sure my positive or negative review wont affect them whatsoever, such is its presence)

Anyways, amongst all the food i tried out there, my faves are Mutton Cutlet, Chicken Kobiraji and Mutton Afghani. They serve the cutlets and kobirajis with a handful of juliened onions and cucumbers with Mustard rye and tomato sauce.

Be there, have a slice of the old kolkata over a cup of hot tea..you will love it. Cheers!!

Whether you write good or bad things about Das Cabin, Das Cabin doesn't care. It is one of those 'don't give a damn about changing times and demand', kind of place, un-impacted by demands to upgrade ambiance, scale up, or whatever else you write in your review on Zomato, in spite of owning generations-old secret and successful mughlai fast food recipes. If you watch 'House of Cards', this is Freddie's BBQ, the desi version ! Das Cabin and places like it, stand as incongruity to the times we are in, like a boss, on its own terms,  and for that guts, a five on five. 

So now you know that it is a run-down small place at the end of Gariahat Market, with seating for about 15 persons, a crisp menu painted on the wall, a serious "no tea coffee" poster hung outside to ward off only tea drinkers, and a big board saying "Kulfi" hung outside in big fonts. So, that's the place, where you can stand in a queue and eat sharing a table, or parcel your food home, like I did today.

I got Mughlai Parantha, which at 50 bucks, was a good deal and tasted really good as well. The mutton kosha, at 75, had four small pieces of succulent pieces, and tasted like a richer and nicer of mom's Sunday Mutton Curry. Now things - (a) just ignore the absolutely oil dunked parcel paper and dispose it off as soon as you reach home, (b) eat the kosha or any gravy, warm, since it has dalda or some animal fat, which when cold, can cause the 'pet golano' or 'un-easy tummy' feeling (which is my present condition after slurped down two left over spoons of the gravy, cold, much after I was done eating).  Had it not been this, I would have marked it much higher, for now, I am pondering over 'gelusil or no gelusil' dilemma.

I have also tried their breakfast offering - a very soft toast with butter, basic omelette and tea - all within 30 bucks. The toast I have found to be of great quality. After my swim/walk back from Lake, I drop in and sit in a shared table, in the midst of newspaper, politics and tea adda of many, mainly old men. 

One thing I did like about Das Cabin is that it is a small menu which works very well for small kitchens with limited infrastructure - against the more elaborate menu trend of newer restaurants, which either run out of food to serve all items or serve identical gravies for different dishes. In places like Das Cabin, you get everything on the menu, all the time, and with prompt service.

A small nondescript joint that has been there from before our times and has stood the tests of time competing well with the numerous modern eateries and foreign ventures of now.

Most of us in South Kolkata know about Das Cabin and have been there at least once in our lifetimes. You would find no change in quality or menu from then and it gives a very happy eating option to the numerous shoppers who come to Gariahat. 

I had visited this joint way back in 1995 when I was in 11 and then again in 2014 - almost 2 decades later. On our most recent visit, we had ordered 2 Moghlai parathas and 2 chicken cutlets. The food was palatable and reminded us of the old days with their 'Aloor Torkari' that they served with the Moghlai Paratha. Had a good experience and a happy tummy and palate.

It is repulsive and dirty as hell but you know what? It has the best Mughlai Paratha & Kobiraji cutlets in Kolkata. Eating in is not for the faint-hearted. You may just run into a couple of rats. We mostly did a takeaway and it still is to die for.

One of the heritage eateries in South Calcutta, Das Cabin is a small joint serving one of Calcutta's best Moghlai parathas, Kabiraji.and Cutlets. The place is extremely old and not very well kept, but if you try their food items once you might want to revisit the place. I usually parcel food from here and eat at peace at home. That's a good option if you don't like to sit there and eat.

Very old restaurant located beside the gariahat flyover . If you are walking from anandamela towards golpark you will bang at this little eatery. They make the BEST MOGHLAI PARATHAS in this area. I usually pack those and one time i ate their special paratha with mutton kasha which is very good.  They make great kulfis too.

First class Mughlai Paratha at its best .It's the old like joints where you take care of your knees and elbows while eating in pick hours .Very few of eateries serving breakfast. They had to do away with their own tea and serves tea bag tea instead in morning times. The cutlets are good and if you can risk some deep fried ventures try the place . The old calcutta still lives there .

Well, what to say to describe about this legendary "DAS CABIN"!
I have been visiting this place since I was a toddler and my mom had been visiting since she was a kid (6th standard).
Initially I went there with mum-dad now with friends! It's just the same shabby eatery with customers flocking outside its small entrance. yes! You have to maintain a cue to have a seat and order your desired food in this not-so-cool and not-well-maintained-atall joint! 
yet, its one of the most popular eateries in town.Why?
Here are your reasons in favour...
They serve-
1) good quality food
2) good quantity food
3) well behaved staves (2-3 of them are working here fr the past 40 years or may be more than that!)
4) most importantly they don't make a hole in your pocket. They are one of they cheapest!

What else do u need to hear about them to be convinced enough to drop in thre?

Ppl frm South Kolkata are well aware of the location fr those who don't ... Its just a stone throw away from gariahat market. 

Firstly m a ltl surprised to see Das cabin here in  zomato... 

The place is too small, can hardly accommodate 15 ppl. Everytime I visited here I had to stand in a queue, thr was no mercy 😜

I guess the place is the same old one as its used to be during our father's generation. The same old recipes.. Same plates same glasses anywz it hardly matters till u can munch over some good snack

If u are trying to loose weight or calorie conscious nd on diet simply run away this is not the place fr u. Their menu is very simple, they serve the basic Bengali snacks fish fry, kabiraji etc etc. Bt the most loved dish my personal favrt is chickn / mttn afghani nd fish cutlet. Its totally worth it. 
As far as service is concerned the waiters r a ltl reluctant to serve u the add ons.... Extra water, extra salad. They make so intense  faces I feel ok don't serve your wish .😜

A very small old joint which is famous for mughlai paratha. It's located just beside gariahat market. Very congested non air conditioned interior with 4-5 small tables and few chairs. Here one has to share tables with unknown.
I loved their mughlai paratha and tasted it several times.This time i tried their chicken cutlet and fish kabiraji. I was too hungry since i skipped lunch that day due to my busy schedule. They served it within 6-7 minutes. Chicken cutlet was served with sauce and salad. The covering was hard and the filling was taste less. In case of fish cutlet , the coating was crispy and light. Fish was soft and tasted average.
price is cheap and service is fast enough. They should look after the quality of food. It has deteriorated a lot and very disappointing too.

One of the oldest joints in gariahat they open in evening at around 5pm..everyday there is definitely cue and dat is good in a way...no fancy ambience why should they have when there is cue each and every day so they have simple wooden chairs and table and at times u have to share the table as well...coming to their food...if u r looking for healthy food not the correct place as their fish kabiraji is tooo oily...one can use 2 or 3 tissue papers to soak the oil easily ;) but the taste is awesome so is their other cutlet i also like their paratha and mutton kasha...and for desert kulfi which is not very great but good...

As someone pointed out earlier, not a lavish place to dine in. But then ofcourse, that's not what you're looking for anyway when you step into the small and cramped room that is Das Cabin. Coming to food, the Afghani cutlet is heavenly.. as is the Fish Kabiraji. The rest are below average. The inadequate leg space and cramped up room doesn't really help either. But if you do try the malai coolfi, even after an unsatisfactory meal, you'll realize why this place is so famous. Do give this place a try if you are ever near Gariahat.

This place is located close to gariahat more and is a tiny food joint that's barely noticeable. Inside there are few green top tables and tiny chairs , and a few small ceiling fans, giving the place an old world charm. The menu is displayed on a board in top of the kitchen window . They sell mutton/chicken/fish cutlets , kabirajis, and mughlai parantha, along with kulfi for dessert. Kulfi in summer seemed to be the popular choice , along with their kabiraji, which I must say was way above standard for an eatery that looks as shabby as this one. The egg on the kabiraji was very fluffy and light . The cutlet was served with a white sauce , which was actually 'posto baata' ( poppy paste) that seemed like a match made in heaven. Clearly this has to be the item for which I wouldn't mind revisiting it again and again. Do give this place a visit and try the kabiraji- kulfi meal on a hot summer day . Enjoy!

Das cabin is one of those few old restaurants which wre heaven for young 20th century retro bongs. But unfortunately when Calcutta turned to kolkata..das cabin failed to maintain it's charm. Unlike golbarir kosha mangsho, das cabin greatly degraded from the standard it used to hold. It has that old flavour of casual tea stall...but this flavour is hard to be felt on the first visit. 
Famous for Mughlai paratha nd kosha mangsho !! Mughlai was as usually good. I guess in kolkata, 90% of the fast food restros make perfect mughlai paratha. Making mughlai paratha is in our blood ! 
Coming to the kosha mangsho ...! Simple nd perfectly average ! Nothing special was in that dish.

Small food joint where you just walk in for a quick bite and also have to share the table with strangers as they lack space. Not just at first sight, but any given day the place lacks ambiance but trust me when i say this, the food that they serve are amazing. I've  been to this place thrice just for their kabiraajis. Just superb! The place is always packed so even though it may look dingy and shabby it has a reputation in kolkata. 

Ignore the outlook and try out their moglai and kabiraajis and their kulfi. You will be surprised and i am sure you will come back wanting for more. 

Overall limited menu but superb food quickly served and at a very nominal rate. 

** rating goes only to the food.

Located below the Gariahat flyover this century old "Das Cabin" is a common name among the Bengalis.With its shabby decour,faded walls and the age old menu charts hardly anything has changed.Moghlai paratha,chicken kasha,fish kabiraji,fish cutlet,mutton cutlet,fish fry,chicken afghani,kulfi hardly any menu has been changed.However once u taste any of its food u can then make out why inspite of such poor maintenence it has prevailed.Fish kabiraji,chicken cutley,afghani chicken,kulfi and other such mouth watering dishes i doubt hardly anu other place can make with so much simplicity yet deliciously at a minimal price.

If you are near Gariahat crossing and craving to have some good ol' kabirjis, cutlets or fries, then this is your place to be. This ancient place has now proven its worth over ages and generations! It has been proven by years of eating that some of the most delectable food emerges from the most humble of restaurants. Das Cabin is not a fancy designed eatery but the honest food they produce still sets them apart. Infact when you step into this place you might be teleported to the 60s or 70s and I would like to say that I absolutely love that feeling, priceless! When you are here at this place do try out their mutton cutlets and mughlai parathas - so original and so tasty! Last time I had tried out their fish fries and they were also pretty good, the fish inside was fresh but the filling could have been a bit more in quantity, a more stuffed fish fry and there is no stopping them in this department as well. So if you haven't yet tried them out please do drop in and have a quick bite at this heritage restaurant.

Cheers!

This restaurant is located in gariahat below the flyover on your way towards golpark. Foodies of kolkata are not unfamiliar to the legendary "Das Cabin". It is almost a century old outlet. The restaurant is hardly 250sqft in space and has around 5-6 tables to provide for the sitting arrangements. It doesn't have any kind of decor, since my childhood i am seeing these joint as shabby as it is now. From the wall colors, to the menu chart board everything is just the same. But you will hardly ever get a place to squeeze in without waiting in a queue outside. Their offerings are unaltered for decades which includes - moghlai paratha, mutton kasha, chicken kasha, mutton cutlet, kabiraji cutlets, fish fry, chicken cutlet, chicken afghani, kulfi etc. After you will taste their offerings yourself then you will realize why such a joint which is so poorly maintaned stays cluttered with people everytime. The quality of their savories speaks for everything and completely on that calibre this joint is reigning as an undisputed champion for ages. Such mouth watering mughlais, kabiraji cutlets are unmatchable and no other outlet in town can make it as succumbing and deliver with simple perfection as they do.

This is a very small eatery tucked away at one corner of Gariahat road,  near Anadamela. The decor is nothing to write home about. It's a non-descript place with a few tables and chairs.  But what's important is the food. They are always packed up in the evenings and you may need to wait for a few minutes before you can find yourself a table to sit. 
They serve some really filling snacks. The Mughlai paratha is a hot favourite. But what I like more are their chicken and mutton Lanikai cutlets and chicken afgani cutlet. The afgani cutlet is something unique, a piece of chicken breast friend and served up with gravy. Have it as it is or try a paratha with it. The quantities are good, though some people may sneer at the quality given the fact that it's not one of those hygienic places. But I have been having snacks since childhood and I never fell sick. 
My review of 3.5 is purely because of their lacklustre decor. Also if you are health conscious,  then you may want to avoid this place as sone of the preparations are quite oily.

Place is a bit cramped. Sometimes becomes terrible to sit in the hot summer days.

I actually don't have any idea how many times I have visited here. This is one of my favorite spot at Gariahat for a quick bite. I have tasted all of their items. Be it chicken/fish/mutton afgani to chicken/fish kabiraji or mughlai. I have loved each and every dishes they make. Here, I have tasted the best mutton afgani which is definitely my favorite dish out here. But if you are hungry and looking for dinner within Rs 75 , you can definitely have the kosha mangsho with paratha. They serve you only one kind of Kulpi, which is definitely excellent. Whatever I take here a kulpi at the end is a must for me. I like Das Cabin's staffs and their service. This is not the place where you look for ambiance,here food says the last word. A must try if you visit Gariahat.

a must visit if you are a little hungry and roaming/window-shopping in and around gariahat. this is a small place but it has a long tradition down history. famous mainly for kabirazi and cutlet, you can also try kasha mangsho and paratha. they can have your food packed as well so that you can take home and eat. in the breakfast, do try their double egg omlet with a cup of tea. the interior is a bit dirty and shabby but the food is great and that's what matters most.

Ordered chicken kabiraji cutlet,mutton gravy cutlet......still,after so many years they are simply amazing to eat....a pure nostalgia..... :)
