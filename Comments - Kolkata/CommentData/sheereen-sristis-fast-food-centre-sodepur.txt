I ordered fish fry couple of times and in one of the occation the food dint taste good. I called the owner and shared the feedback. Next day they send the same order for free.  Thank you for the good gesture.

Chicken reshmi kabab roll is a must try.. also the kababs are very soft and flavourful. Very nice and cozy place and easy on your pocket. Mix chowmin lacks taste.
