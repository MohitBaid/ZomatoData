Its the best place in whole lake town where you can actually get good chinese food at great price. Kudos to the team for there continuous performance.
The best part is they do provide home delivery and accept Paytm for payment apart from cash.

I am having food from this place since my school days around 20 years almost .The food has been always great and no compromise with quality .But recently it has become unpredictable some day it have excellent food but on a odd day its totally out of taste .But still it is the most budget friendly authentic chinese food joint in laketown. Try the wingwah Special noodles ,Copsey and mandarin fish are some of its signature dish.

My first experiance is very worst .

As they don't provide spoon in home delivery .As they assume that we are in home .so they should give raw food and will coocked in home .If someone order from office then what it would be office delivery  or someone order from hospital what you will assume? .

You may also assume that customer will not pay .This time you will never assume .

Lets play game you assume and assume and the game name is assume assume .I suggest please change the name of your restaurant and name it Assume restaurant .But the food is good

Had the worst ever chicken chowmien. The white sauce had a foul smell. And the most disgusting part is that the restaurant doesn't provide spoons if your order is delivered to your home. "Company Policies" we got the reply, when enquired. 

Hope the service and the food both gets better.

My first memory of this place dates back to when I was 5 years old..
Well,the seating part is a problem,but that has nothing to do with the food..
The old aunty is one of the loveliest people you can find..Still going strong at this age..
Coming to the food,I don't find it overly priced..The portion sizes are well enough..The food is really fresh..
You can try anything from sweet corn soup,mix noodles,prawn fried rice,chilly chicken to chopsuey and fish items...
Its best to call & place your order and then pick it up after...

Pretty decent at the price, their food quantity is superb, so is their quality. Customer since 2005, never had a bad experience. 

However, not a place to eat, sitting is minimal, best to have the food delivered or have a take away.

They at the helm of their days were one of the best chinese in and around dum dum and laketown and were very popular. But I guess with the advent of time things have turned bad for them. I had their fried rice and chicken manchurian at their shop. It's a very small place and there are like two tables. None the less the lady is very courteous and the food was served fast. Neither the rice nor the chicken was very tasty. the spices were a little too much in the manchurian and very less in the rice. The chicken wasn't very soft either. The very thing going for them was the price and quantity. With so many chinese options now days, all I can say is that they have a lot of work cut out.  Hopefully they will be back to their former glory.

This place is basically a delivery joint serving chinese dishes. The prices are really low & the quantity of food is decent. The taste of the food though is nothing extraordinary. The foods served are simple & light with minimal usage of spices. If you crave for chinese dishes but don't want to compromise on health..this place will be perfect. Satisfied taste buds with minimum ill effect on health. Higher expectations on taste of food may lead to disappointments.

The only reason I am putting a 3/5 for this place is the food and the price. Else, this place is not even worth of writing a review for. Take a look at the points below before you plan to drop in here after watching the chinese flavour in the name of the place itself -
1. No A/C
2. Pathetic dirty
3. Staff behaviour? What?? They won't even bother to offer you a glass of water. You have to ask for it and there after u would be handed with a sheer vomit exaggerating jug; never ever washed before
4. No tissue paper on the tables. Mind it, they have only 2 tables
5. Staffs were roaming as if they are in their home garden or roof with sando ganjee and pant.

Guess that is enough for you to think about this place. But having said that I will recommend this place. You cannot have such a nice chicken gravy chowmin in 90 rupees now a days. 
Alterntive option: Go for take away or home delivery..

A pocket friendly viable restaurant located in an obscure alley on the ground floor of a building. Space is a problem here otherwise quite an excellent. The food was good both in quality and quantity. If you are looking for a good affordable chinese outlet this is certainly the place. The chilly prawn was tender and succulent. The veg fried rice was good but needs to be cooked 1tone. Overall quite a good outlet if you aren't hell bent on a good ambience.

Wing Wah is a well popular compressed version of Chinese Cuisine between the lanes of Lake Town. The dining is so small it can only handle 6-8 people at once. As per its size & locality people living nearby to this love their food delivered to their door rather than sitting over there. Entering there you will feel you are in a Chinese hub that they managed with very few decorations. Overall clean to have your food comfortably. The owner of the restaurant is also Chinese so they do know the traditional dishes of their country & that is totally seen on their menu card. Lots of Chinese dishes to choose from on that small hub & that too for average prices. 

Coming to the food : Noodles or Rices over here is made of almost same kind of spices so they both tastes almost same. They use very thick kind of noodles that is well mixed with spices & vegetables. Chicken pieces were neatly diced into small pieces. Same is applied for fried rice too. The rice used here is kind of low quality grain that smells odd. However both dishes were not up to the mark & both gives you a higher taste of chilli only & it makes other tastes of the dish hidden. Coming to the Chilli Chicken & fish items, The chicken pieces were soft, well cooked but smells little fishy. For chilli fish they use most low grade Vola Vetki fish that is totally noticeable by its smell, but somehow it tasted not that bad. But dried chilli chicken & fish are over hot with lots of green chillies & less capsicum used. All this dishes will almost make your tears come out & there is very less chance that you will feel any taste in that kind of situation. Somehow all those foods are still eatable.

Conclusion : If you are at Laketown & searching for some foods then its a good choice to get some average kind of food for a little less price than nearby once. This place doesn't deliver mouth watering pleasant taste to your mouth but neither its a pain either. On another hand it can be pleasant to your hungry tummy sometimes.

Small restaurant but good food. I prefer to say its majorly Chinese cuisine not Indo-Chinese cuisine(many people are more comfortable with Indo-Chinese cuisine). I tried Prawn Chicken Hakka Chow, Manchurian Chicken, Chilli Chicken. I found distinct flavors of herbs which are used for Chinese cuisine. Its good to have foods in such a price range.
Last but not the least, I received very affectionate behavior form the owner. I will visit again.

A total disappointment....
The worst Chinese (if you consider it as a Chinese cuisine) I ever had in my life. The food is not up to the mark. The ginger chkn was dry (means totally DRY ... no tossing in the sauce ) and flat. The chkn fried rice was below average ...... they use a different type of rice grain which does not fit to its taste. Now, their 'chilly fish' ... that was filled with green chillies and no capsicum. It was too hot that I only could have a few bites.
...... And expectedly the next morning I got a stomach pain.

They provide only quantity sacrificing the quality of the food. Foodies like us do not go to restaurants just to fill our tummy. This food joint has broken my heart such a way that from next time I need to think ten times before trying any new joint.
Their prices are in a lower side, but after such a experience that is quite meaning less.
All in all .... A total waste of money  and time.

An extended adda with friends on a winter evening can lead to dinner and Wing Wah's home delivered food is ideal for such an occasion.

We searched the net for home delivery options nearby. Wing Wah caught our attention among the Chinese eateries for it's reviews and its menu. We needed a meal for four adults, the general preference being towards fish and chicken dishes. The order for two servings of chicken fried rice and one each of chicken meefoon, garlic fish and chicken manchurian was placed with fingers crossed.  We were told that the food would be delivered within an hour or so. The adda continued.

To our surprise, the food arrived within half an hour. The speed of delivery, quantity, packaging and pricing were appreciable indeed.  Yet, the taste and quality of food was the best part. Initially the quantity became a challenge, but quality ruled and not a speck was leftover! 

The proof of the pudding is truly in the eating. Wing Wah is now one of my hot favourites, especially for home delivery!

For an impromptu dinner for four of us, a quick research in Zomato on nearby eateries for home delivery helped us zoom in on Wing Wah based on its rating (3.5) by the reviewers.  We asked for two portions of chicken fried rice, a portion each of chicken meefoon dry (rice noodles), garlic fish and chicken Manchurian. The food was delivered within 30 minutes of placing order from the restaurant at Lake Town to our place at Bangur Avenue. We found the food quite tasty – the fried rice used very less oil and garlic fish did appeal to our palates. The servings came in great portions and we had to almost over eat to consume the entire food. But the match winner was Wing Wah's price-line: two main dishes and three sides cost us only Rs.505/-, incredible! Now I know whom to call in the neighbourhood when the pangs of hunger strike!

A small little restaurant in one of the lanes in Lake Town but a place that's pretty famous for their Chinese cuisine. Known for their prompt home delivery and polite staff this place gets a lot of calls. Their chicken Veg, mixed Hakka noodles, vegetable manchurian and gravy noodles and all sorts of rice are yummy. A little compromised in terms of cleanliness it may seem but who cares right? The food is simply amazing! :)

and till now they have a thing which is missing in many resturants, they interact with the customers very well
 and the food is very cheap,one can easily afford it.

Gravy Or Cantonese noodles being an integral part of Chinese Cuisine, very few can perfectly make it. One being Wing Wah. Try yourself.

Win Wah and the Aunty sitting at the reception are eponymous... This tiny little place has been in existence over so many years and has been the den for chinese food lovers in Lake Town and surrounding areas. Remember visiting this place some fifteen years back as students who had limited pocket money and wanted to indulge in good chinese food in this area. The food quality remains the same till date and the price... well its very economical if you go  by the quality and quantity of the food. The fish quality is excellent and so are the chilly chicken and chicken and veg  fried rice. They have home delivery service so you need not go to the outlet and order.

There is hardly any sitting arrangement..so I always opt for home delivery. The service is pretty good and fast. Love their mixed rice n schezwan chicken the most. Its the best schezwan chicken i've ever tasted! There's this strange authentic chinese flavour and smell in every meal. Budget friendly too!

ahh..the food here is worth money but the thing is they have some servising problems and the place is a bit small,but
the aunty over there is very pleasent and their customer service is also very good i am going their since i was small 
and till now they have a thing which is missing in many resturants, they interact with the customers very well
 and the food is very cheap,one can easily afford it.
i think that evry one shuld try their food and if u live near lake town u shuld definitly try it

This is most pathetic place for home delivery. The staff  is illiterate & does not stand on their word. I wouldn't advice anyone to visit this place. Real pathetic service.

Being at home ordered a chicken Hakka chow and a plate of lemon chicken.the drama started after the order was placed. I called them after half an hour what was the status. They told your food was ready you can now come up and take the delivery. I told then why did I gave you my home address and nearest location if I had to pick up the delivery.they said sorry and and confirmed the address. After 15 minutes i call them again to check what's the status. They tell me , sir our boy is near your home but cannot find the exact address so they asked for my phone number. Again after 15 minutes i called them up and now they tell me that your food is almost ready and it will reach within 10 minutes . At last after 2 hours i get my food and it was so disappointing.

Wing Wah is located in Lake Town.
It will be quiet difficult for people not living there to find the restaurant .If you are coming from the footbridge towards axis bank,the next lane will be your destination. Well, about the food.Its really good and tasty .I had Chowmein there which was delicious and chicken .
Honey Chilli Chiken was good as it was sweet and hot.The place is small .Only two tables inside.They give home delivery. And most of the people out there prefer home delivery.The price is quiet reasonable.
So,if you're really hungry and you like Chinese cuisine and you're wallet does not carry much ,you can easily go there and dig in some great food.
And if you live in Lake town ,you can easily order you're food.
Believe me ,it will be worth you're money.

Its a wonderful place for take away food. Thai and Sxhezuan items are worth special mention and hot favourite. Having it since last 12 years.
Try these dishes for lip smacking take away lunch n dinner....... 
The ambience is nothing great and its adviceable that you take a parcel or order for Home Delivery. Maintain the menu as; -
1. Thai Soup
2. Honey Chilli Chicken (Dry)
3. Gravy Chowmein/ Schezuan Chowmein (preferably Mixed)
4. Schezuan Chkn/ Lime Chkn

Food- 5/5
Ambience-3/5
Value for Money- 5/5

Ambience doesnt matter if you are taking a parcel or getting it home delivered.

Highly recommended ...!!!

In one word- Excellent. Food is really delicious. You get the ordinary Chinese food here like Fried Rice, Chowmein, Chilly Chicken, Manchurian, etc here but the taste of them is not what you get in most Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. The sauce and spices they use to prepare the gravies taste authentic Hakka Chinese. The quantities are really generous. It is a tiny restaurant and there are only two small tables placed inside the restaurant for diners. It is better to take the food home, they pack the food well. The owner, a Chinese lady, is really very sweet and warm person. Overall definitely recommended.

It's a small eatery tucked inside Lake Town. The place in totality is not conducive to dining in. Take away or home delivery is preferable. On laidback afternoons, Wing Wah has rescued us from scratching our heads for reasonably priced good food in and around Lake Town. 

The usual Chinese fare is neither terrific nor terrible but somehow you will always go back to them for more. They make a decent job of the Chow or the Fried Rice, although on the oilier side. If you are ravenously hungry, you would be able to finish three-quarters of a plate of either things. Side dishes comprising Garlic Chicken, Schezwan Chicken and the like are offered into two variants of Boneless and With Bone. 8 pieces for the former and 10 pieces for the latter, at the same price, per plate. A smart sales point, I believe. Portions of chicken were smaller than I would've liked but the chicken itself was full of flavour.

Given that Chinese food joints are no longer a rarity, Wing Wah does not stand out as such but it is something you will think of when in that area with a modest budget.

YUMMY FOOD @ WING WAH!
3.5 out of 5

Wing Wah is a small little restaurant that is hidden in one of the many lanes that dot Laketown. The restaurant offers no parking facilities and the sitting area inside the restaurant is too small and cramp for comfort (-1 for this!). They do provide outdoor sitting options though; but the best way to have their food is in the comfort of your home. Despite the space crunch, the place packs a huge punch in the food department. The food is not only fresh but fast and good as well. The typical Chinese offerings of this establishment are reasonably priced. The fare is cooked in the typical Tangra style.

The quantity of food is such that one person might find it difficult to finish the dish that he has ordered for himself. Among other options, it is their mei foon that is very popular among diners. The mei foon is soft and light with a good number of meat pieces and vegetables. The same can be said for their chow and fried rice options. The portions of such staples are more than enough; they can be overwhelming at times with their generous servings and go well with almost all of their dishes. Almost all their dishes are well seasoned and well cooked, are very popular and most sought after by regulars as well as newbies. 

Some of their well made dishes that are worth raving about are lime fish, Manchurian chicken, chilli chicken, garlic chicken, and sweet and sour prawn. Their soup options, especially their Thai soup and hot and sour soup, are beautifully flavored soups. The broths of both these soups are not only light but seasoned with the right ingredients. The Thai soup has the perfect balance of sweetness, spiciness, saltiness and sourness in it. Even their spicy items are mildly spiced; like dishes that you will get from authentic Chinese restaurants.

Little chinese restaurant tugged away in a lane at Laketown. There are no parking spaces and the sitting area is also small (4-6 customers can sit inside). They have stools set out outside for people to sit.
Menu is typical chinese restaurant menu and the prices are reasonable. Tried out American chopsuey and it was pretty good. The taste was good and quantity was pretty good (difficult for one person to finish it off all at once). The price is reasonable at Rs 115. 
Be prepared to wait for 20-30 minutes while the food is getting ready.

A quiant little restaurant tucked away in a lane.
The restaurant is a really small one though, with only two seats, so it is ideal to have your food delivered(delivery usually takes around 30-45 mins and over an hour on sundays).
Coming to food, the USP of Wing Wah is the Mein-foon. This is a type of rice noodle that is cooked only by the owner. Besides, one can try the mixed fried rice along with the Manchurian chicken or the sweet and sour chicken.
Only one complaint: the food way too oily.

Food:4/5
Service:3/5
Value for money:5/5

Nice place, food is good, price also reasonable. I love mein-foon here.
But one thing, at the evening time you should not use, as they use a kind of Chinese agarbatti with pungent smell which is horreble, caused me to leave the place one day.
