The ambiance was really good. Service was also good. The corn and cheese jalapeno poppers are a must try. And with hookah at just Rs199/- everything was just perfect.

Just like the name which is so catchy Food is also catchy.The USP of this pace is: 
>Travel Themed Cafe 
>Pure Veg
>Separate Space for Hookah
>Full Marks for Presentation
>Quality & Quantity of Food is very good
>Pocket Friendly
>Prompt Service
We tried their "Corn Cheese Jalapenos" & "Special Garlic Bread".Both were very good especially Corn Cheese Jalapenos.In Main Course we tried "Mexican Rice with Jacket Potatoes" which again was very spicy and lip smacking.
Last but not the least We were suggested "Safe Sex on the Beach" in Mocktails and trust me it was icing on the cake.Must order !!

The place is newly opened and it's quite eye catching. It's located just the opposite lane of wise owl.
The place serves hookah and have offers on them. I went with my friends for a little hangout and we took a cup of coffee, one Alfredo Pasta. The price is really cheap and the bill was around ₹300.
The decor is really nice and one can go there to have a proper evening hangout and fill your Instagram feed with amazing decor pictures.
A must visit !

A place with multiple sitting options. We ordered their special cheese garlic bread and parmesan quesadillas. Both dishes were amazingly cooked. The kiwi gum hookah was also nice. Just the staff catering me had a little less ideas when asked about the dishes,I had asked for a cheese garlic bread and he got me the special one which was delicious so I didn't mind. Overall a very good experience.

I was there on a New Year Eve... To start with entire decor was quite contemporary, and to my taste.Food was good keeping in mind it was vegan , but it was little costly if I see a price of a SweetLime Soda is 127 pre tax. But staff was quite cordial and helped us with the food menu. The shisha was good and unique and nice .. 
Overall its good place if someone wants pure veg food.

Posting this review sitting in here as I have loved this place. Came here for the first time & made it one of my fav hangout place in the city. 

The main reason why I loved the place is as this place is themed about travelling. Apart from this, ambience is very comfortable with soothing music. Seesha, food and brevarages are good too.

Thumbs up to the owner & the staffs.

This cafe is tucked in a small lane in Hindustan Park and our visit here was quite a good experience.
We used a Nearbuy open voucher.
We ordered:
♡Corn and Cheese Jalapeno Poppers: This was a OMG! The coat of the poppers were o so crispy, the filling had the right amount of cheese, corn and jalapenos. The dip they served was spicy and delicious.
♡Jacket potato and Mexican Fried Rice: This was so heavy and filling. The jacket potatoes were prepared to perfection and the rice was good though a little too spicy. They garnished it with Doritos (not their own made nachos).
♡Toblerone Shake: Not very cool in presentation, but it did justice to its name. It was really thick and yummy.
I would love to visit this place again, it serves amazing vegetarian food. The ambience is top-notch and refined. I guess it's a pretty luxurious hangout place for hookah lovers cuz the lounge is too pretty and comfy.
Service was fine.

Also if you're a travel freak you're bound to love the interiors of the café. Each and every corner is decorated with quirky frames and designed lampshades related to travelling. The décor is absolutely top notch and ambience so soothing. The staff is very efficient and helpful. You can enjoy a great conversation or even spend some time playing card games with your pals. Coming to the food, each and every dish absolutely delish.
Some of the dishes we tried :-

MOCKTAILS
• Guava Delight (recommended)
• Safe Sex on the Beach
• Kiwi Fizz

STARTERS

MAIN COURSE

Also the pocket pinch is very reasonable considering the quality and quantity of food. This is perfect place of student hangouts and to spend a some quality time. Visit this beautiful noshery and relish their finger-licking food & to have a great time. Would love to visit again sometime soon!

Another joint for which i was looking forward to.
Stationed at Purna Das Road this place serves amazing set of vegan dishes. 
The hint of uniqueness adds to the positive if this joint. 
 We had :
DRINKS

Guava Delight : Well one of the most unique drinks i've ever had. One with the flavour of guava with a tinge of spicy sip. 
Safe Sex on the beach : this buddy had a killer presentation. You gotta be here to know this. It left us in awe-struck  position. 
Kiwi Fizz : different and beared a wonderful sweet taste with perfect flavour. 

Starters
Mwb Special Garlic Bread : Crispy and had a wonderful presentation all that you need from a garlic bread. 
Corn Cheese Jalapeno Poppers : This was a new thing for me. Loved it entire. Stuffed corn and cheese tasted amazing. 
Crispy Chilli Babycorn : This something common. It was a half a bar more spicy from what it should have been. 
Mwb Stuffed Mushroom : Amazing presentation, mushrooms were battered and made crispy. 

Main Course 
Four Topping Pizza : Will be a delight for thin crust pizza lovers. Perfectly Cheese , gives you an amazing taste. 
Spaghetti Aglio Olio : tossed in sause gives you a perfect feeling served with a crispy bread. 

Parmesan Crusted  Cottage Cheese quesadilla : one of unique one's i had. 

Dessert
Chocolate Brownie with ice cream : has all that you need from this common dish. 
Apple pie with Ice cream : one of the unique things i've had . Loved this. 
Well the dine line was amazing here. 
For me star performers here would be undoubtedly Safe Sex on the beach, Guava Delight and Four Topping Pizza. 
The decor is pretty cool something that you will enjoy within. The uniqueness of this place makes it even better. 
So if you have got a bunch ready to spare some bucks over some amazing set of vegan dishes you should be headed to My Wanderboots right away. 
This place definetly gets a 'Must Try' tag from me.

When in the middle of a hectic work day you have hunger pangs and you crave a pizza, you look for new outlets to deliver. And this one was an accidental find.
First of all they are so accommodating. They customised it as per my without onion and garlic needs, and then the pizza came in was drooool.
Thin, crisp, loaded. Basil flavored this 4 cheese pizza is a must must have. It's brilliant.

Christmas and New Year is all about some close people to celebrate with some great food for me.
This place is surely a heaven for Vegan foodies.
So I decided to visit My Wanderboots as it's a newly opened in town. Heard of it through zomato for some affordable food and fine décor.
The place is beautifully decorated with some fine décor and aspects of travelling all around the walls is what you'll find surely.
We ordered for Drinks which consisted of guava delight and safe sex on the beach. Both are the RECOMMENDED ones. The guava delight is something on the spicer note with guava pulp. And the safe sex on the beach is something amazing with the dim light.

We ordered for corn cheese jalapeño and MWB stuffed mushroom . The mushroom was extremely fresh and soft. And the taste was amazing. It got melted in the mouth. 
Then came the four topping pizza .The thick crust with toppings tasted soo good. The extremely cheesy on the top was Heaven.
Ordered for sphagetti aglio olio which was so good. The olives and the broccoli in it tasted so fresh and the sphagetti was too good in taste.

The desserts for us consisted of Apple pie with ice cream which is the something unbelievable i tasted .

Service was pretty fast and good. The owner of the property was too interactive also.
Loved my experience.

My Wanderboots is a beautiful restaurant located in Hindustan Park. The restaurant has 5 sections with a lovely travel themed decor adorning each room. Food is really tasty and reasonable. Try their Stuffed Mushrooms for starters, Pizza and Quesadillas for main course, Safe Sex on the Beach mocktail and Brownie with Ice Cream for desserts. The quirky, unconventional interiors appeals to the travel buff in you and the food and hospitality makes you feel happy from within! And all this without burning holes in your pockets.

This must be heaven for the vegetarians!!
Yes I totally mean it. When I stepped into this cafe I actually didn't know that it was veg and even after having their penne Alfredo it didn't strike me!
It was THAT good! Loved the pasta like anything. And while ordering the second item I actually realised that it wasn't a non veg cafe.
No regrets though!
Chinese sizzler was the second item. Wished the quantity was better. Manchurian tasted amazing btw.
Food was really good and so was the service.
 It was on time and kudos to the staff for being so friendly!
One word for the decor: ELEGANT.
You keep discovering corners there..and the wall looks so funky with the doodle art and cute toy parts.
I am in love with the ambiance.😍
Even the cheque was provided in a cute little box that gave me a feeling of touching the memoir of France. 😉
Keep growing!
This place is highly recommended for the veg lovers. 
Non veg lovers you too won't regret visiting it trust me!

This place is a 5 min walk on purna das road from golpark petrol pump, located on your right. What an amazing place, with positive vibes and well made sheesha. It's a vegetarian cafe with the thematic representation of a travellers paradise, wall decor and the hanging lights just like small aircrafts is a pleasure to the eye. I loved the bruschetta we had which was tomato and mushroom along with peach iced tea, green tea and a good fruit flavored hookah. The service is prompt and the staff is attentive, the cafe has three parts and all of them ensures your privacy and it has a medium seating capacity. Will be back for more food!

This cafe is located in purna das road just beside tero parbon and to one's surprise is a complete veg restaurant . the ambience is the main attraction here with lovely colorful paintings all over the wall and giving a world-tour feel to it . we ordered coleslaw sandwich which was tasty and enough to satisfy one's hunger and regular coffee. The menu is limited and would recommend them to make it more versatile just like their ambience . staff is well behaved and courteous. Spacious with availability of seats .there's a different section for shisha too. ☺

This relatively new place has come up at Hindustan Park beside the Baskin Robbins outlet. Ambiance is decent enough and staff are courteous. However, this is a strictly vegetarian cafe which did not go down well with me at all. Food options are limited. The Hookah we had was however very smooth and well made. Seats were comfortable and loud music was being played. Overall a nice little cosy place, however being only a vegetarian cafe is its only drawback especially for a non beg lover like me!

Situated in the byelanes of Hindustan park this is a newly opened gem of Kolkata. Surprisingly it is a pure vegetarian cafe which is a rare sight in the city. The central theme to the cafe is travelling. From the cycle on the wall to the pedal lights to the world map on the wall and a graffiti on the other side, everything is beautifully done.
Coming to the food and the quality of service, the staff look trained and polite and the food- delicious. My order: 
Green apple mojito
Virgin mojito
Chinese sizzler.
The sizzler was brilliant but the mojito was a bit too sour for me.
Overall a decent experience and definitely worth a visit.

My best friend was in town and this was the correct choice i made taking her to this newly opened place as enumerated in zomatos "newly opened" collection.
This place is really good to visit with your friend gangs and family too.. Quiet spacious with separate area for private party and hookah, rest area is just for chiiling and chit chat and the decor is just super easy and simple yet impressive and catchy.
Now comes the food we have ordered the following:
1) A veg wrap.
2) 1 Hookah
3) Mexicon rice with jacket potatoes.
4) Maggie burger
5) Mojito
6) Wanderboots special dessert.
This place has done full justice with the food for the amount charged.👍 It serves with good quality, quantity and tasty food. The above order can serve four people and it has costed us Rs.1270/- ( inclusive of all taxes) quiet reasonable😉.
I am fully satisfied with the place its a must visit place for you all..😊

The place is located near fillers at southern Avenue. The place is on the 1st floor. Right from the entrance the place has an aura of itself. Subtle interiors with calm and cool lighting which is soothing to the eye.

Coming to the place: Just as you enter the place you will be bit by the cuteness bug. The place has a unique travel themed interior. Small planes, bikes and bicycles hanging from the ceiling. Red letter boxes and telephone booths on the wall.

A separate section with 3 bean bags was nice and cozy.
The place is divided into 2 sections: For hookah lovers and only food lovers.

We sat at the hookah section and it was a nice place to be in.

Coming to what we ordered:

1) kiwi + spring water shisha - the shisha was extremely well made. Did not choke even once.

2) nachos and carrot hummus - the hummus and dips tasted really well but sadly the nachos were not home made but ready made cornitos.

3) spaghetti alio olio - tasted well but could have been better. More vegetables should have been tossed and should have had more flavour.

4) peach ice tea, fresh lime soda and cranberry mojito - all 3 were well made.

The portion size can be improved too. I felt it was a bit less.
The staff was very courteous and always around to help. Were really well mannered.

Overall the experience was fantastic.

The food, drinks and shisha were good. Its a must visit place.

The owner too was friendly.

Pocket pinch for the above we ordered was ₹1430. Which is quite reasonable.

All views above are suggestions and not complaints 😬

Dis new Cafe is basically modulated from a home bt nicely decorated n proper utilization of d space is taken care of.. Dis was d nly positive thing i felt as our experience was not at all 'wanderful'.. The staff n chef all were new to der profession which I experienced as it took almost 45 min for the starters to reach the table n der were hardly any other customers still dey took so much time to serve everything.. shisha was smoky bt the flavors were not according to our order.. Pizza was very soggy n stuffed mushroom was tasteless.. Mexican wrap was filled with rice n beans was served separately which should have been inside the wrap.. der were few things which were really praiseable like d dips provided with different dishes were appropriate n upto d mark.. spring roll was crispy n filled with glass noodles.. soups were hot n tasty... Overall d management have to look into d service n cooking style... Vl think twice b4 visintin again...

They have came up with the name ' MY WANDERBOOTS' which is a very unique name, relating to the theme of 'Travelling' and their interiors are well decorated with everything that relates to travelling, be it world map, globes, cycles, motorbikes, helicopters and all the things that relate to travelling. The place is very spacious in terms that it has many separate rooms where you can enjoy a fun time with your family or friends or closed ones,by playing card games like 'Uno' which is available here. The food they served was very well presented, it included crispy chilly babycorn, stuff mushroom which were starters and tasted awesome, they also served cranberry mojito and green apple soda. In overall sayan

We were in search for a cafe in the Purna Das road area and found this newly opened cafe. After entering, this cafe stole our heart. It is a BEAUTIFULLY decorated cafe with a theme of travel.  From wall painting to lights, all are made with utmost perfection, keeping the travel theme in mind. The place is quite spacious, spreading over three rooms. The owner welcomed us and guided our visit to all the parts of this place. We could feel her passion to make this place a perfect one. Coming to food, we selected Greek salad, sauted mushroom, Bombay cheese sandwich along with coffee and tea. The salad was made of fresh ingredients with feta cheese and tasted quite well. Sauted mushroom was also prepared well. We also loved the Bombay cheese sandwich. As told by the ever-smiling waiter, both the coffee and tea tasted like home-made ones, which went perfectly well. Together, we had a nice time at this lovely cafe. We wish the place a long run.

If you are looking to spend some quality time with your friends with light music and good food, this is the place you are looking for. A travel themed cafe with the owner a delight to speak to. Also you'll not have difficulty locating the place.
We ordered mix sauce pasta, their special Garlic bread and a refreshing Green Apple mojito. The pasta tasted too good and Garlic bread was also well cooked.
We also got a complementary dessert which was a bliss. 
A must go place for everyone. I'm sure it wont dissapoint you.

In a fix where to go? Head to My Wanderboots! The decor is good gorgeous. Every wall is used so beautifully and the lamps made me go ‘Oh My God!!’. The service was pretty fast and good. The owner gave us a tour to the entire place which was very sweet of him. And the food ❤️. We had ordered Pesto & Basil Penne Pasta, Mexican Rice with Jacket Potato, Cranberry Mojito, Blackcurrant Fizz and My Wanderboots Special Dessert. It all tasted superb. One better than the other. Tbh, I’m still drooling over the Pesto & Basil Penne Pasta and Blackcurrant Fizz! I’d recommend this place to anyone and everyone who loves traveling (the decor is is all about traveling) and food. I was having my doubts before going there but the place didn’t disappoint me. #SundaySpentRight

A perfect place for Brunch!
As soon as you enter the place you are transported to Wanderland!
The decor does absolute justice to the name..with 5 rooms , the place is spacious and comfortable.
The Hospitality is incredible..the owner was kind enough to give us a tour of the restaurant and even help us decide on the menu.
Above all, the food is droolworthy..you must try the basil penne pasta and black currant fizz..
So go to this place for the food,the vibes and amazing hospitality!

So, after hearing this name many times from my friends, finally visited this place last Sunday. Being open since a couple of weeks or so, it's a fresh new café, which is sure to go a far way!!

🏩LOCATION:
My Wanderboots is located at a distance of around a 5 minutes walk from Goplpark towards Purna Das road.

🎇INTERIOR & DÉCOR:
As you can guess from the name, this place has been done up in a Travel theme. Be it the Helicopter lights or the Cycle lights or the travel related quotes up on the wall, My Wanderboots surely keeps up to the theme!
The place has separate seating areas, distinct from each other, which means you can have complete privacy with your group of friends.
They have a large collection of Board Games and we really had a great time over Uno and Jenga!

🍝FOOD & BEVERAGE🍹:
🍕Coming to food, we had ordered a wide range of items, which included;
Mushroom Risotto (decent)
Pesto & Basil Penne Pasta (best pick)
My Wanderboots Special Garlic Bread (quite good)
Carrot Hummus with Nachos (dips were great)
4 Topping Pizza (could be better)
🍹As for Beverage, our order consisted of
Blackcurrant Fizz (the best)
Paan Smoothie (pretty good for paan lovers)
Cranberry Mojito (refreshing and tasty)

All the items were quite decent, my favorite pick being the Pesto Penne and the Blackcurrant Fizz!!

💁HOSPITALITY:
Hospitality was the best thing I liked about this place. The owner, herself made sure to attend each one personally. She helped us in menu selection and attended us from time to time. The staff were quite polite and courteous. This place deserves a 10 on 10 straightaway for its hospitality.

Overall, a nice experience and will sure recommend it to others!! Keep up the good work! Cheers!! 🍻

Kolkata so finally after a long time I visited a vegetarian travel theme multicuisine cafe cut lounge named My Wanderboots. The place is very vibrant and when you enter the cafe it feels like you have started traveling around the world. So whether it's the light shaped bikes, biplanes or a shelf full of dolls in boots everything is done keeping in mind the travel theme. There are five separate rooms which help individual group to get a private space for their kind of party. They have board games also. Coming to food we ordered a beetroot risotto which we really loved it I must recommend every risotto lover to try this even if you are not a beetroot fan. We loved the My wanderbooots special garlic bread and cream of mushroom soup. My wanderboots special garlic bread was crispy and was loaded with veggies, olives and cheese. If you love nachos and hummus then must try Carrot Hummus with Nachos. I am sure you will ask the kitchen to pack some carrot hummus we totally loved it. We didn't had too many drinks but cranberry Mojito was really good. Four toppings pizza was also good. Though we didn't had Maggi pizza and Maggi burger but I am sure every Maggi lover will love to experience the same. They serve hookah also we ordered two flavours both were smooth and good. Now coming to hospitality the owner is delight to speak to. She personally interacts with every guest and help them to choose the best food according to their taste and preference. The staff are well trained and always ready to help you with a smile on their face. Overall we had a nice experience would love to go again to explore more as a traveller and a foodie always keep wandering, exploring and sharing.

This newbie in town is impeccably decorated and stands true to its theme of travel. The owner is a delight to speak to. Talking about the food, the carrot hummus and nachos is a delight. The peach iced tea is absolutely refreshing! The hookah is quite good too with innovative flavours and bases. 
Recommended!
