With so many small outlets of food hubs specially for the afternoon and dinner meals in the city this place at Maniktalla has some very good reputation of serving some quality of non veg dishes. Better known for their variety of tasty fishes they make everyday. Not only in fishes they also deal in every form of Non veg items such as chicken, mutton and prawn.
Went their long ago but didnt expected this place to be in Zomato but thanks to VishalÂ for finding it. Tried their two types of fishes (Parse and Rue) with steam rice and it was brilliant with the taste. Thou i will agree that the prices are bit high but taste wise its pretty decent.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Excellent food. Especially the Echor was just wonderful. Delivery was on time. I was a little bit worried about the quality before ordering. But now after having the meal i am feeling so good.

Whenever i visit here i found the place empty. The place was clean and staff was also friendly. The food was not good at all. The price was high and taste was average. Not satisfied to be here.
