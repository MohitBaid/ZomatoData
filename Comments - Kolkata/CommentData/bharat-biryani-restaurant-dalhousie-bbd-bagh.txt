Though the service of the stuff is not quite good because I ordered two dishes & waited near about half an hour but those dishes which I ordered (panfried chicken momo & chicken lollypop) was too yumm. The quality & quantity is too good at a reasonable price. Great place to have a dinner with friends and family.

Food was way beyond delicious!! I totally loved each and every dish in bharat. We ordered chicken tikka butter masala, chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken tandoori(half), chicken reshmi kabab, chicken bhuna and tandoori roti. Though the biriyani was little bit spicy but it didn't matter at all. Chicken was well-tendered and mutton was so soft that it felt like heaven in the mouth! Having said that, service was very good and staff was very much courteous, quantity was sufficient as well. All came under budget and they are inclusive of all taxes. And one last thing I must say, plz do visit here if u want to feel the new version of biriyani! #thankyoubharatbiriyani

A pocket friendly non-Ac option for lunch near my office. The veg biryani I ordered was high on quantity and taste, a bit oily though but no issues on quality.
The place needs staff training and better lighting.
The fhirni I ordered here was one of the best I had till date, definitely packing it to office often now.

Truly a hidden gem in Kolkata! But sadly these type of restaurants are still underrated!!

Though a non-ac restaurant, but the ambiance is not that bad. Since it is located in such a congested area, from outside it is not possible to have an idea about the seating capacity here which is quite descent according to me.

Had Chicken Biriyani, and it was Awesome ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡
Trust me, you will forget Arsalan's Biriyani after having Biriyani here.

Rice was nicely cooked, Chicken was soft, Aloo was too soft and yummy and the Bonus part is the 'Egg' which you can't find in most of the Biriyani Outlets today. Quantity was nice, it's not at all oily and you will not fill heavy or uneasy the whole day after having a full plate of Biriyani! 

And all of these @ 135/- only. The prices mentioned in the menu is inclusive of tax so, no further GST ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š.

So it's a request to all the Biriyani lovers out there... Just try it, at least for ones!!

Bharat Biriyani, opposite Lal Bazar Police HQs is surely a hidden gem when it comes to proper Kolkata biriyani.

Every month, at least thrice I have my lunch over here or get it delivered to my office. Not once have they disappointed me. I only order special mutton biriyani along with salad and coke.

The mutton biriyani is just awesome, much much better than Arsalan and other big players. They really give you the two best of the mutton pieces which are big in size, has meat, some fat and sometimes a littleÂ bone.

The mutton pieces are super soft and very tasty.

The biriyani rice is tastes awesome, the masala and mutton juice blends along with the perfectly boiled potato, giving it an awesome flavour. At the same time, it does not feel 'dalda-ish' or dalda like greasy but again it is not dry. 

And best part is even after having it at 4pm, you will not feel uncomfortable or feel like reaching for theÂ sachet of eno.Â 

The salad served is clean taking in to consideration that this ain't a fine dine.

The restaurant is like eating house, non-ac, like the non-ac sections of Arsalan, Zeeesan etc but this is never very crowded. This the waiting time is very less. Everytime I'd ordered, I got my food served in 10 minutes.

They also serve other items including Chinese but I have never tried those.

Out of the waiters over there the taller and relatively younger guy is the best out there. He is very cooperating and helpful.

But even if they weren't I would surely haveÂ ignored them just to enjoy their special mutton biriyani.

Very oily and spicy foods. More like the roadside stalls serving food in inside area. 
One should not expect high quality this saying is okay... however I am paying my hard earned money and I have full right to good quality and hygeine food. The chicken in rezala was very hard and dry, possibly very old, and the gravy is slightly sour and wierd spicy with doused desi ghee---YUUCKK..This will be the last option for lunch when out for work. Guess the chap in kitchen is a lowly paid and dosnt have any idea of cooking, 

The talkative waiters will for surely eat you head and literally they can convince you to like the food by TALKING. 

One good is that they are accepting PAYTM.
Just want to forget the experience.

Service and location great,price reasonable but Biriyani cold and that is quite rare even on footpath.Nothing can compensate SIN of cold biriyani.

Been to this place many times, never have I ever been disappointed by the service or the quality of food you get here. This place really serves great food, and the service is also pretty good. Kebabs, Nans and other stuff taste pretty good, the rolls they make are also pretty decent. Keep up the good work, thumbs up from my side.

Reasonably well made Biriyani. Chicken was a bit fibrous in both the Chicken Bharta and the Chicken Biriyani. Served with a smile. 

Good for a quick meal.

Quite a good place for mughlai and north indian food. Situated just opposite lal bazar police station. Good in terms of quality and quantity. We tried out their new added items. Hyderabadi chicken was tender and succulent. Good it terms of flavour. The chicken was cooked with little paneer pieces, accompanying peas and topped with cheese & coriander. The paneer was of good quality and succulent. The tandoori roti was crisp and succulent. It was served hot. The staff was amicable and the service prompt. Overall pocket friendly spacious outlet.
