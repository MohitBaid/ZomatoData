This place serves only Chinese food, that being said the quality is excellent and the quantity of the food comes at the price of a bargain. The menu provides a lot of options to choose from and the dine-in has an inexplicably delightful Chinese feel!

It is always a pleadant experience whenever I visit this restaurant . Their noodles are just THE BEST in the town . Other than noodles they have many other mouth watering dishes .¬†
Would highly recommend this outlet if anyone is planning to dine out .
They do arrange parties too , I have already attended one . B'day and other parties are organised at a reasonable rate .Thumbs up from my side.
Most importantly its a pocket friendly restaurant.

Loved the food every time I ordered from here... This place serves Chinese food only. I have been ordering food from here from the very beginning. The food tastes awesome. Pocket friendly.
Any variety of a plate of rice is enough for two people until they are grand foodie... ,üòâ 3.5/5
Any gravy chicken has 8 fulfilling pieces of chicken which is again enough.4/5
Noodles are of average taste.2.5/5
Crispy conzy chicken is one of my favorite here.. 4/5

Service is wonderful and the behavior of the staffs are very warm and helping. If you need ice-cream or cold drinks they also serve it without any extra charges for it. They just take the MRP of those things.

The reason for giving them less marks is:-
1. Still need to arrange seats properly.
2. Open area on G.T. Road. ( But they r trying to cover up the rooms properly it in progress)
3. Non-AC. Little problem during summer.
4. Needs to Clean the sitting area very carefully.
5. No cold water.

Note:- whenever I ordered food or visit there my experience was wonderful but today I felt very uneasy as I saw the floor was full of dirt, dust and to make the situation worse we saw cockroaches all over which must be taken care of. Or else they will loose the reputation they made so far.

I hope they will take care of these small draw backs so that we can share a better experience next time.
