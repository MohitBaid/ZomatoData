This is a hookah bar with few food choices but the decor and ambiance is good. I liked the hookah. It's a place for adda with friends. The place was empty when I visited.

It was a sudden plan to visit this place and got it on Little app. We decided to just go and try. Trust me guys as it says "always expect the unexpected". Music system is too good and you can play songs of your choice through Bluetooth. What i liked the most was sheesha(hookah). One of the best i have ever tried. Food which we ordered was satisfactory. Ambience is also very nice and staffs & service very apt and quick. Very happy and thanks for the full on masti evening.

Hookah is okay! But they have no options for food .. Not upto to the mark!! The ambience is good ..The service is also ok.. It will be good if they bring a good food menu!
