Quite overpriced and unrewarding. I bought their Belgian chocolate cake for 700 rupees. It was disappointing at best. Felt duped for having bought something so ordinary for 700 rupees, that too just half a kg.

Visited few days ago.  One of the famous and exclusive store where I have found RAINBOW SLICE CAKE.  I have ordered RAINBOW SLICE CAKE,  BELGIUM CHOCOLATE SLICE CAKE & ROSE VELVET SLICE CAKE. 

Trust me each and everyone slice cake is excellent.. It's made with like a butter, not a bread so smooth and so soft.  

Want to visit again and try to tastes there other dishes.  

But this is quite expensive.  So if u want to visit here, then please be prepare but ur money will not getting waste.  

Taste is awesome, exclusive collection.

Recently visited the place with a friend. We ordered Coffee Toffee Brownie, Caramel Tart and Red Velvet Cupcake. The brownie was super yummy and the tart was also good. But the red velvet was not good. The batter had sugar cubes and it tasted like liquid butter. But it was overall a good experience.

Ordered a chocolate nougatine cake. Was beautifully decorated and yum. Service was polite.

The layers of cream and bakes were perfect. Was delivered in right time. Writing on the cake was perfect, nice font and handwriting. Not much of cream toppings were put which was a good thing, toppings were more of milk chocolate sliced decorations.

Rate is not cheap not costly. Value for money - yes. Because the cake is yummy and worth the rate they are charging.

Bought a red velvet cheesecake and a double chocolate chip brownie. The red velvet lacked the essence of an authentic cream cheese. Priced at ₹120, it failed to meet expectations. The brownie was chocolaty but nothing extraordinary. I had to pay ₹270 for both the pastries but I wasn't at all pleased with what I got.

This is probably my personal favourite dessert place in all the city. This small gem of a place is located right next to the food court at Mani Square mall.

This place specializes in cheesecakes, most of which are made pefectly. They taste amazing, the consistency is perfect, the cream is lucious.
Their chocolate coating is concentrated and tastes perfect. It's deep and to die for.
I keep going back to this place for more.

An usual visit to Mani Square bragged for something out of the box and hence was thinking of the possible options to try sitting at the food court of the Mani. Pursuing all our options, we suddenly thought of trying The Belgian Bakery and hence did the same.

This outlet of TBB is kind of a stall located in the Food Court just near the escalator. We went there and randomly ordered for Fresh Fruit Tart and Choco Carmel Tart followed by a Double Chocolate cookies.

The deliciousness was delivered quite fast and we instead of exiting with it, sat at the table of Food Court as if we are having a full fledged meal. We did it at the purpose as because we wanted to feel the essence our of the beauty just ordered.

Both the tarts tasted well while I liked the Choco Carmel more, while the cookies were okayish. Finishing our small party we went forward to order something from KFC.

A visit is recommended!

A feast for the eyes when you see their cakes and pastries in the glass counters of the stall and a veritable feast for your taste buds when you put a spoonful of their pastry into your mouth. When I put a spoonful of Tiramisu pastry into my mouth I was transported to heaven. The taste was so good, with just the correct sweetness,hint of coffee flavour and chocolate and light and fluffy too. The Belgian dark chocolate too was good.
The prices are too high but one can indulge once in a while and be happy.

The Belgian Bakery is the first thing that will catch your eye when you transcend to the food court of Mani Square mall. Its hard not to notice this small joint with those delicious looking cakes and pastries staring at you. So we stopped to order some desserts. Their chocolate collection is an absolute delight to look at. They offer a wide range of options which will leave you dazed and confused as to what to choose. We decided to go for their chocolate walnut brownie cake, served hot. The delicious molten chocolate with walnut did not disappoint us as we finished it within seconds. Blink! And it was gone. I was surprised by the amount of walnut that was appearing in our mouths when we gulped a huge chunk of the brownie cake. We also tried their signature red velvet cheesecake upon their recommendation. And we were gladful for that as it was absolutely delicious. The feather light cake just melted in our mouths and took us to a land of bliss.
      The pricing is ridiculously nominal. So it is totally worth to give this place a try when you're in Mani Square. Would strongly recommend.

I have tried black forest cheesecake and New York baked cheesecake also. Whenever I go to the Mani square Mall I keep reordering the same items again and again . Each and every variation of cakes are just amazing. You may find the price a little high but believe me guys no one is going to give you a cheesecake like them !!

Well, finally a go at this place – which was on my wishlist for long!

This one is a cute little kiosk offering very limited range of pastries and savouries in the food court of Mani Square – Kankurgachi! Was delighted to see that the number of eggless goodies on offer significantly exceeded the number of egg ones!

I begin by rating them 5/5 for presentation and hygiene.

I had a Belgian Chocolate cake as well as a Chocolate Nougatine parcelled – which were decently packed. The food bill came to 230 bucks – which was quite a blow to my wallet!

However, both the pastries were excellent – soft, rich, creamy, tasty, fresh – ad what not – it had perhaps everything, which a lay man looks for in a pastry slice. The pastry toppings deserve a special mention – the heart-shaped chocolate design on the Belgium pastry and the choco square atop the nougatine pastry – indeed, these made the pastries quite presentable!

Nice to see that they offer pound cakes as well as home delivery also!

Serving size is fine – and having 1 pastry will definitely satisfy your sweet cravings.

You can definitely try out a pastry or two and escape to heaven – albeit only for a few moments!

My everyday dessert craving reason is this place since the time i have moved to north kolkata. 
The belgian chocolate cake slice was a little dry than expected, they might try adding more eggs or butter to make it a little more melts-in-the-mouth kinda experience. (if you are trying have the same by warming it up a bit with ice cream and chocolate sauce, and you are good to go) 
And the fresh fruit cake slice was really fruity tasty and worth re ordering always.

After a heavy meal, we decided to have a small dessert. As the saying goes, we always have a separate space in our stomach for booze, food and dessert. And it's true. I have always been a fan of the Belgium bakery even to this day. Though I ate here a lot, but this would be my first review on this bakery stall. Situated on the 3rd floor of mani square ( food court ), this is situated near to the escalator. The display shows a wide variety of desserts you can order from. We ordered just one item and that's carrot pastry. The carrots were made of icing sugar, not too sweet. The pastry itself was not too sweet. We sat on the food court chairs and tables and the dessert was absolutely amazing. Yummy!

You have varieties of other pastries too that you will love to have.

Ya their fruit cake is awesome.

A beautiful small bakery which would definitely grab your attention if you're at Mani square food court. The cakes and pastries look beautiful. Although they didn't appear to be anything special to my taste buds. Pricey too.

Tried their rainbow cake and cheese cake. Cheese cake was good but i did not like the rainbow cake. And the price is in the higher side. The service is not that good. Staffs behave like they are irritated.

A confectionary shop located just at the entrance of the food court in Mani square. They make  scrumptious tarts and pastry's. I have had their walnut tart and lemon tart and both were great. Their black forest cheesecake and new York cheesecake are also pleasant , and one of the best in Kolkata. Though the chocolate mousse was not so tasty as I had hoped. Overall a great place to satisfy your sweet tooth.

The Belgian Bakery is definitely the place you would want to be at if you are visiting Mani Square and you have a craving for sweet things.

They are absolutely the best when it comes to baking things. Five star to everything they make. 
Fresh Fruit Tart: Kiwi and other tropical fruits thinly cut into slices and is put over a creamy base. The pastry is baked to perfection.  (5/5)

Choco Candiliscious Cake: Best. Cupcake. Ever. Velvety, creamy filling, with the right amount of lightness in the cake. It's a cracking cupcake. (5/5)

Belgian Bakery is at the food court of Mani Square Mall. If you are there, you wouldn't want to miss out on this place.

The Belgian Bakery Kiosk is quite an eye catching kiosk at the Mani square Mall food court just when you step off from the escalator it appears in front.

I tried some of their products from this outlet which were decent in taste. Liked the Red velvet cheese cake and the new York cheese cake. But the behavior of the staff is not at all up to the mark ever irritated and not in a mood to serve customers. Not that impressed with service.

Located at food court, this is one of the star attractions. Their tarts are mostly hot favorites. The cakes also pack a punch with flavors but are quite expensive. Cannot really comment on their authenticity, but most of their products sell good and are worth the money. Service is something which is quite good here as well.

Have tried this bakery many times whenever i visit Mani Square mall food court. Lovely tiny bakery serving good food at reasonable price. Tarts were really good, right amount of crunch and followed by the topping whether fruit, chocolate, walnut or lemon. Tried their rainbow pastry as well, definitely worth a try. Off late had their mango cake and was really nice with pieces on mango mixed with layer of cream between bread. I have also tried their savory items, though not many in number, they are worth a try. Will keep visiting and try everything they have to offer :D

If i have to buy a cake to treat someone special without money constrain.. this is the place i would suggest... These guys bake really fresh and awesome cakes... So far i have taken 3 birthday cakes from them and  all the 3 were a great hit in the party... they truely taste awesome...
Like every thong has its own limitation... this is a bit over prised than the normal kathleen or mio amore cakes... u would get two cakes for the prize of one..
It depends who u want to please.. ur taste buds or ur wallet...

This bakery outlet located on the food court of Mani Square mall immediately attracts one's attention as one steps off the escalator, because of its eye-catching prim and pretty kitsch and decor. The kiosk is designed to look like an elegant European chocolaterie, a streetside Belgian patisserie or a chic Parisian cafe serving hot cafe noir and fresh croissants, with delicate breads and sweet tasty treats daintily lining the shelves. 

Recently had their walnut tart and the sweet, sour and spicy Masala Bread. The tart had been sweetened to the right degree, contained a mild nutty taste, was light and freshly-baked. The bread was also deliciously flavorsome, perfect with a cup of aromatic herbal tea. Their vanilla raspberry cupcake and choco caramerl tart too are richly scrumptious.

 For confectionaries like cakes, pastries, cupcakes, teacakes, cheesecakes, handmade luxury chocolates and desserts in jars, The Belgian Bakery that produces lip-smacking confections fashioned with authentic Belgian chocolate is a must try for any food enthusiast, sweetaholic, dessert lover or epicure. I fully recommend this outlet as a great bakery option in the City of Joy.

Quite frankly my all time favorite bakery. N me being a person with an unsatisfiable sweet tooth, I hav tried quite many bakeries. The vast innovative menu (innovative because of the less availability of similar items in our city), the rich taste, the extremely good quality food all of it makes the slightly pricy (but ok for once in a while) experience worthwhile. My favourites include the lemon tart, the carrot cake, the new York baked cheese cake. I'm yet to try the whole menu. But I surely will. Definitely a great plc to eat n a must try for all dessert lovers.

Cakes were soo cute and instead of buying a huge cake like every year try this cute wonder this time for her or his birthday or your anniversary.

"Beauty with Brains" among all bakeries.
The variety of items and the fact that each item looks so so pretty and tastes equally good is something worth appreciating.
The lemon tart was utter bliss. Balancing the lemony and sugary feeling in the right way. Very fresh!
The walnut tart was equally great. Nutty,chewy and crunchy.
The New-York baked cheesecake was okay. Not bad,but I've had better cheesecakes.
The orange chocolate cake tasted a little bitter in the beginning and didnt appeal to my tastebuds.

To sum it up,great place for tarts. Not the best place for cakes maybe. As of the cheesecakes,worth a try.

P.S. : On asking for an extra spoon,the lady at the counter threw one on my plate.Dont know what to make of that. Poor service would be an understatement.

Wanted to try their sweet goodies for a longgg time. So during the puja , after having heavy lunch at one of the restaurant at mani square, we decided to have our dessert from this counter.we had
1. Lemon and mint tart - not a great fan of this one, this was just about okay
2.dark chocolate tart - true to its name, the chocolate was very dark and tasty
3.walnut tart - the best of the lot, the nutty texture was awesome
4.Orange chocolate cake - the chocolate was the dark variety one and it created havoc when combined with orange.

The Belgian Bakery killed my appetite for red velvet cakes today. Had the most horrifying slice ever! 
Have absolutely no idea where these guys got their recipe from. 
Firstly, the slice was pink as opposed to"red". Secondly, it tasted like some really sad sponge cake with some artificial pink coloring added to it. The cream cheese frosting was only just regular cream which also tasted horrible. 
The tiny chocolate shell used for decor made the entire experience all the more disappointing. They also used shavings for decor which I suppose was meant to be white chocolate but tasted like stale, solidified cream. 
All in all, I felt this slice of "red velvet cake" was an absolute disappointment and a waste of 110 rupees.

I have visited this outlet many times and each time it left me craving for more! I was introduced to this bakery by one of my school friend and now my visit to Mani Square Mall never completes without having their cheesecakes and tarts.

Items tried till now:

Bailey's Cheesecake
New York Baked Cheesecake
Black Forest Cheesecake
Tiramisu Cake
Red Velvet Cake
Walnut Tart
Lemon and Mint Tart
Fresh Fruit Tart
Gooey Chocolate Cake
Raspberry Vanilla Cup Cake

I personally like the cheesecakes most and the walnut tart. The texture, the subtlety, the right balance of tastes and the presentation gets a big thumbs up. The people at the counter are very cordial. Overall I love this place and would like to go back over and over again for their cheesecakes.

Belgian Bakery has undoubtedly come up as the newest desert hotspot in the city..It has really mesmerized me with its collection of pastries and mousse..nice presentation and beautiful recipes in chocolates and tarts as well..a bliss for sweet tooth like me to end a meal at Mani Square with deserts from this joint..its quite small and most of the times all the listed items are not available..so that might be a cause of dissappointment..Also the staffs here are highly incompetent..once they goofed up with my parcel..the other time they ctually miscalculated the total bill and caused harrassment..Apart from these this place has really hit off..I personally adore the Bayleys Cheescake..Choco Caramel Tart and my personal favourite is undoubtedly the White Chocolate Mousse..simply adore it..quite unique and delicious..and not served in every pastry shop in the city..Kudos to the management for keeping up the quality..

Brilliant bakery shop with it's small outlet in the mani square food court. They have a variaty of pastry and mark my words when i say they are ALL brilliant. be it the new york cheese cake, the red velevt, the rainbow , the selva negra, the brownie cheese cake , the truffle cakes ---- they melt in your mouth and take your heart forever. It is nothing but excellent. I have to deduct 1 point only and only because of the cost factor. not many can indulge in a pastry that cost over a hundred a piece. Since i love their food so much and i have a huge sweet tooth, it is forgivable to myself and understood when i shelve out 200-300 per meal for having 3 pastries a day. but i am sure this same factor becomes a hindrance for many people who would like to enjoy these miracles too. Their cakes and pastries and tarts are of very high standards so guys definitely give it a shot once in your life. It is simply brilliant.

I was rewarded just as I desired! I had ordered the flourless chocolate cake. Small, pretty, delicious! It did fulfil the pleasures of my sweet tooth. The tarts are also pretty damn good. I was there for a quick sweet bite but it turned out to be a passionate session with the delicacy ;)

I would definitely give a visit, whenever I will be in Calcutta!

I ordered red velvet cheesecake, walnut tart and raspberry vanilla cupcake. First of all the red velvet cheesecake is a bit misleading. It is actually a "red velvet cheesecake cake". It was good but I didn't like them adding strawberry flavour jam in between the two layers of the cake. I have attached a picture and you can see that layer of jam that they have there. The vanilla raspberry cupcake was too dense  so I will not be ordering that again. I liked their walnut tart. If I have to buy any of these above three items again I would only buy the red velvet cheesecake cake again and not the othes.

The best lemon tarts in kolkata!!
I have tried almost all the dessert items on their menu. But by far lemon tarts take the winning score. Its pocket friendly and a quick stop destination to all those times u get a sugar rush during shopping at mani square. Must try- cheese cakes and lemon tarts.

In one word, 'Just Awesome'. This little joint is located in a small corner, beside escalator leading to the food court of Mani Square and is a highly recommended place sweet lovers out there. Belgian Bakery is the best place in Mani Square to have some really premium quality desserts without worrying much about wallet.

The good thing about this outlet is that stocks are always fresh and the collection never seem to get exhausted. They have some really nice cupcakes, pastries, mousse, tarts, cookies, cheesecakes and even full sized cakes which can be handy in case of celebration occasions. The cupcakes and pastries are colourful, beautiful and really premium looking. For non-chocolate lovers, you won't be disappointed looking at their collection. They also have some savory options however the stocks are very less.

Well for me, I tasted their Vanilla Raspberry Cup Cake, Walnut Tart and Chocolate  Marquise Mousse. The Vanilla Raspberry Cup Cake was awesome and probably their best selling item, highly recommended. Chocolate Marquise Mousse was equally good and recommended for chocolate lovers. Walnut Tart was just about at par with other items.

Prices will not pinch the pockets as pricing is very nominal. Service and billing is swift, so no hiccups there. Packing is not really bad, but if you do take something home, you will have to expect some mess. Better to ask them to pack in multiple boxes. Wish they had something like cupcake separators inside the boxes as they seem to take most damage. However, if all goes well, you will actually appreciate their packing.

Final verdict, a nice place and surely worth try after a dinner at Mani Square. Also a good choice for celebration occasions, their cakes are definitely worth a try.

I m a big sweet tooth person and this place is heaven for me. I had been to so many confectionary but this is the best place for my dessert cravings. 
This is a small stall in food court of "Mani square" mall. 
They have different variety of pastries here.
Among them I love the "fresh fruit tart" the most followed by the "rainbow cake" "american cheese cake" and "Belgium dark chocolate fantasy".
They also offer chocolate tea that complements perfectly with the dessert. 
Perfect for a awesome sweet date or outing with our loved ones.
Coming to price it's on lil higher side, but it deserves as it is one of the best confectioneries in Kolkata.
I use to visit at least once when I m in the city.

my bestie n i went to Mani Square after a long time and we discovered this place by chance.we had ordered the chocolate nougatine cake n the new york baked cheese cake.The latter tasted heavenly and the nougatine cake was good, but since we had it after we had the cheesecake, perhaps it tasted a li'l less good.The prices shown here are less than what we paid at the store........for instance we paid 95 for the nougatine cake while here it shows 85.Though the tastes are actually good but i felt, they are actually over-priced.........and not at all student friendly.I will go there again to taste all other stuff it has to offer but can't say i would "frequent" it.

Trust me it was my sweet tooth that got me there n it was pretty nasty!! Yes I'd call it nasty coz they selling tart n I make better tart than them probably -_-
Well ***my tart had a name fresh-fruit-tart n it has 3 eye-catching slices of fruit on top of a cream base n then PATHETIC BREAD!!!!! wat the heck#£#%&@@ ******

Chocomousse was decent n decently priced too...


Cafe mocha whatever pastry was eye-catching again n it was made up of ***** 3 stuffs... Cafe beans(4-5 pieces) ...dollop n dollops of nauseating cream....n 4layers of chewable-bread (brown bread it felt like£#£%£) :O   wat the heck.
N oh they have a price always exceeding freaking 150 for such mind googling stuff :'(

This was our first dessert stop after the family dinner at Kaidi Kitchen. Its a small outlet right beside the ATM Machines serving desserts along with a few savory items. We called for a White Chocolate Mousse and a Choco Marquise Mousse.

- The white chocolate mouse was great to taste and had a zing of lemon zest along with eggless chocolate sponge which took the flavor a notch up. Topped with dark chocolate shavings and icing sugar. Recommended.

- The Choco Marquise Mousse was pure chocolate indulgence! Great to taste. Recommended.

• But, both the mousses lacked the finesse they should have showcased. Looked more as if the ingredients were simply stacked up each other. Can be improved.

The staff as well as the Chef were extremely polite and the service was quick.
A moderately priced place with respect to the quantity served.

An above-average experience it was.

This little bakery stop at Mani Square 3rd floor boasts of  pretty wide range of offerings; some of my friends absolutely love this place, but if you ask me I think the place has got some way to go to reach the pinnacle. Specially the guys serving at this place can be better trained about customer care / handling, etc. The guys even go ahead and ask not to take pictures of their food items, but just if you let them know that you are a blogger or a restaurant reviewer then they are all cool! I really do not remember if ever I was asked NOT to take pictures of food items! The real crux lies in the taste of the food that no one can imitate by taking or seeing these photographs, correct? 

Coming to the food - last time we had ordered for New York baked cheesecake and a chocolate cake. The cheesecake was good but not superb to be honest like I have tried abroad. It was bit too sour for my liking, though overall you can give it a try for sure. The chocolate cake was specially packed for a kid so it had no nuts in it and was very tasty, it was almost perfect to be honest, dense chocolatey yet light. There are so many more items to try out here and I am sure I'll have them on my next visit(s) to the mall.  

Cheers!

This place will get a mixed review from me. There's nothing so great about the place. A small outlet and even looks smaller for the decor. Initially when I visited the outlet during mid 2014, I had a lemon tart from here. My tastebuds are well trained by Flury's lemon tarts, so for the first time I had to discard the tart. It was awful. So, my rating would have been 2.0
But, recently I visited this place a week ago, and they have changed a lot. The chocolate mousse that I tried along with a truffle was good, not as good as Flury's or Cookie Jar but good. Never try the fresh fruit stuff or pastries from The Belgian Bakery. Its horrible!
Last but not the least, the desserts are served here by a complete douchebag(s). The guy doesn't even know the allergen information or the ingredients in the cupcake. So, beware! Not a great place, but still Mani Square finally has its bakery!

This piece of gem is located in the food court of "Mani square" mall. Probably the only outlet of "The Belgian Bakery", whenever you pass by through this section, you just cannot resist yourself from holding back and take a look at the mouth watering and jaw dropping baking expertise which this place puts up. Being a small counter, there was a thick chance of being overshadowed and overlooked but the visitors, but the distinction and culinary expertise which this outlet exhibited completely stole everyone's attention.
In each and every item of their offering, the quality of uniqueness and the raw potential of standing out of the crowd reflects. Whichever item I have tried till date from here have always pampared my pallette and left me craving for more. Be it the distinguished "carrot cake", then the "New York cheesecakes", "the teramishu delight", or the succumbing cup cakes and muffins and of course the tarts as well; everything are just breathe taking when it comes to presentation and flavor( it melts in your mouth and the tantalizing aroma and texture completely pampers your taste buds).
Ofcourse, I gotta mention the picturesque "rainbow cake slice"- it is something after having it made me feel that my life was incomplete before savoring it.
The way "The Belgian Bakery" is approaching, it will undoubtedly cement its legacy as on of the most distinguished bakery in town.

Had been there for two times now. And the experience is wow. Yesterday was Christmas so was in the mood for some cake digging. Had a tiramisu cake and a chocolate nougatine cake. The tiramisu cake was pure heaven. Soft but not messy, just the suppleness one desires. The chocolate nougatine was delicious too. Earlier visit included the almond and walnut tart and some chocolate fantasy pastry, don't remember the name exactly. All were blissful.

The Belgian Bakery caught my attention once while returning from a team lunch in Mani Square. The pastries are extremely good looking and thought of having some of them packed.. Asked the server and he did not seem interested to suggest! Selected the rainbow pastry, the lemon and mint tart and the almond tart.. surprisingly, the bill came as around 250/-!! Pretty costly, isn't it! The packaging was nice and the pastry box was cute I must say!

When I opened the box, I found one chocolate tart instead of the lemon tart.. That annoyed me in the first place.. remembered me of the frowning serving boy.. However, both of tarts tasted okay.. the shell was a little on harder side.. not perfect for a good patisserie.. 

Opened the Rainbow pastry... looked lovely... had the first bite.. and OMG! It smelt of strange food colors... I understand everyone will use colors while preparing rainbow pastry, but not up to the extent that to destroy the pastry's own flavor!! We actually could not finish off this one.. I am not sure if I had made all wrong choices.. Whatever, I am never going back!

U dont need to go through reviews to find the quality and taste of Belgian choclates..
Belgium.Choclates are always the best,starting from.taste to quality everything is of top.notch..
This place is located in Mani Square Mall beside Cinemax
There are very few people in this world who doesnt like choclate,and if that choclate is Belgian,u need no more intro..
I have been a here a couple of times,i was never ever depressed,it might feel.a bit expensive for some but dont leave,give it a try and after that u will get addicted to this place,from the aroma to the taste everything is special,when that lava of choclate will cradle in your mouth it will feel heaven...
A highly recommended place to everyone specially to choclate lovers..

I was about to leave after having dinner at Mani Square when this new bakery got my attention. I wanted to have cheesecake, and was a little confused about the options, when the person at the counter suggested the Bailey's cheesecake, so I went for it. After a meal I love almost every simple desert and this was no exception. The cheesecake had a touch of chocolate, that was nice. I would like to try their baked NY cheesecake and tiramishu cake soon and update the rating if necessary.

On the eve of Eid, I visited this place with my cousins. I was eager to be there as I have seen  mixed reviews on Zomato. Yes, I have to accept this fact that this outlet is quite eye-catching and cute. They have maintained a good sense of decor which is catchy inside the food court. 
Now coming to the food. We had Chocolate Nougatine Cake and Choco Caramel Tart for ourselves. The Chocolate Nougatine was okay. It was soft, creamy and less spongy but, I won't say that the taste was extraordinarily good. Rather, it is average keeping in mind the price of it. The Chocolate Caramel Tart was also okay. 
I think it is an above average bakery shop and my opinion is based on the taste of two items which I had in this joint.

The Belgian Bakery caught my attention once while fooling around in Mani Square. Not to sound like a snob but honestly, there are hardly any good patisserie in that section of the city. 
The thing that caught my eye about this place was the pricing. I mean it was pretty damn cheap!
And the red velvet cheesecake is just too good.
I've been to this place for a couple of times and not once have I been disappointed. Did I miss anything? Oh the packaging. Its soooo adorable. :)

**********************************************

This small pastry junction at Mani Square Food Court serves some amazing pastries. The Tiramisu pastry, The Red Velvet pastry and the Mango pastry are amongst my favorites. i have had better Truffle Pastry, and considering this to be just a pastry corner, they should do the truffle better.
Nevertheless, I love this place and make sure to have the Red Velvet Pastry every time I go to Mani Square.
Cost for 2 in my case: 250 (approx).

The belgian bakery is a small outlet in mani square food court...
For months it was in my wishlist.. But finally got the opportunity to have some of its fabulous cakes, cup cakes and tarts..
Their one of the speciality in Cakes - red velvet cheesecake ( strawberry & cheese layered gooey cake ) @ 100 for a slice and New York baked cheese cake @ 105
But i opted for a different variety as its an mango season i ordered for a fresh mango cake of one pound @ 750...as it was an birthday cake for a special friend of mine.
The cake was delicious..was a treat for all of us..the mango was very fresh and the cream melts in your mouth..
I'm not very fond of sweets but the cake really impressed me alot

Rating -
Food quality - 5 out of 5
Expenses - 4 out of 5 (very much reasonable)
Service - 1 out of 5 ( Arrogant staff )

Wanted to buy something for home yesterday. The Belgian Bakery was just infront of me and I had been meaning to try out their stuff for a while. Since it was my first time buying I didn't feel like buying anything too fancy - bought all the varieties of tarts that were available. I was a bit worried about how they would taste - but my fears were unfounded. They tasted really good and I would definitely love to go back and sample some of the other stuff on display now - probably will soon enough.

This a heaven for all those with a sweet tooth. Twice I went, had black forest, red velvet, cheese cake, and so on.. But the Red Velvet is out of the world. All the pastries super soft and melts on the mouth. Had these Rainbow something (top most in my uploaded pic) the other day and I can't tell how wonderful it was, every slice had a different flavour, cherry, black current, blue berry, green apple, pineapple, vanilla and many more, and every flavours could be so beautifully sensed. Presently this place has become one of my reasons to visit and revisit Mani Square. Must say within the boring food court of Mani SQuare this is a real attraction for sweet lovers.

The Red Velvet Cheesecake was the biggest surprise of the day!!!.......its taste was awesome!!!.............the layer of white cream on the strawberry cake covered with grated cheese made the cake even more tempting and irresistible..........and a bite of it just melted inside the mouth.......loved it very much......though the almond pistachio cupcake was not that extraordinary yet one can gorge upon it.

Have you ever had something that was so good that you craved for it everyday? Well, that is what The Belgian Bakery will do to you. Starting from its red velvet cake to the tiny looking cute little cupcakes, it will titillate your taste buds to an overwhelming extent. You will keep wanting more and more. I have tried its cookies, cup cakes and the pineapple pastry and others ( the names of which I have forgotten).  Since its in the food court area of mani square, you can sit with your pastry comfortably, while savouring each bit of it.

This a heaven for all those with a sweet tooth. Twice I went, had black forest, red velvet, cheese cake, and so on.. But the Red Velvet is out of the world. All the pastries super soft and melts on the mouth. Had these Rainbow something (top most in my uploaded pic) the other day and I can't tell how wonderful it was, every slice had a different flavour, cherry, black current, blue berry, green apple, pineapple, vanilla and many more, and every flavours could be so beautifully sensed. Presently this place has become one of my reasons to visit and revisit Mani Square. Must say within the boring food court of Mani SQuare this is a real attraction for sweet lovers.

The Red Velvet Cheesecake was the biggest surprise of the day!!!.......its taste was awesome!!!.............the layer of white cream on the strawberry cake covered with grated cheese made the cake even more tempting and irresistible..........and a bite of it just melted inside the mouth.......loved it very much......though the almond pistachio cupcake was not that extraordinary yet one can gorge upon it.

Have you ever had something that was so good that you craved for it everyday? Well, that is what The Belgian Bakery will do to you. Starting from its red velvet cake to the tiny looking cute little cupcakes, it will titillate your taste buds to an overwhelming extent. You will keep wanting more and more. I have tried its cookies, cup cakes and the pineapple pastry and others ( the names of which I have forgotten).  Since its in the food court area of mani square, you can sit with your pastry comfortably, while savouring each bit of it.

After La Griglia and Baskin Robbins we were here again. This time @ The Belgian Bakery: nicely designed bakery with a neat sense of the pastry wardrobe. It was more of her wish to try it. I was almost full, but she was still craving for more. So we tried a fresh fruit cake, which was en glossed with three or four fruits. Pineapple, cherry and probably passion fruit was all I can remember. It was very fresh and light and was appetizing to my mind as well. Good for a tryout...

It came at last, the pinkish red soft creamy cheesy piece of cake topped with strawberry. Yes! the red velvet cheese cake. I cannot begin to tell you how awesome the cake was.  All the cakes out there looked so tempting, bt undoubtedly overpriced . Highly recommended to the cake lovers.

A beautifully decorated bakery opposite to the food court of mani square. Read some rave reviews about the place, so wanted to try it myself. Ordered a black forrest cheesecake & a walnut tart. Cost were Rs 45 & 110 respectively. Pretty expensive for the size they were offering. They looked quite though. The walnut tart was very sweetish, still good. You can actually feel the almonds amidst all those caramel syrups. But the black forrest cheesecake was a big letdown. It was no way a cheesecake, just a simple black forrest cake. It did not have the soft feel of cheese at all. Extremely sweetish.....killed my tastebuds. Also the staff was not at all courteous. We were taking some pictures among ourselves in front of the cakes & with our platter of cakes, the staff actually told us not to take pictures in front of the stall!!! Overall a disappointing experience. 

In my opinion:
Decor- 4/5
Food Quality- 2.5/5
Service- 2.5/5
Value for money- 2/5

the newly opened up bakery outlet at the food court of manisquare was also in my checklist for the month.Post our movie time and photo sessions at  the roof top of la griglia, i finally got to see through the colourful cupcakes,pastries and cheesecake @ the belgian bakery .
For sampling, i chose the CHOCO CANDILISCOUS CUPCAKE and the Valentines day special, RED VELVET CHEESECAKE. the prices were 70 and 150 respectively.
For the cupcake was nice, with a dark brown frosty chocolatey topping, but the cake could have been baked to make it bit  on the softer and spongier side.
And for the red velvet cheesecake, let me be fare..it looked amazing cute, but from no corner, it was a "cheesecake". A carrotish pinky cake with  strawberry on top..was just what it was.n coming to the VFM part, 150 for such sweet carrot cake was not justified.
our inspection of the day was limited to these samplers, coz we know places to spend money in a  better way!!
3 for the cakes, plus .5 for making them cute and colourful, the rest can be added , provided u guys give an effort to make them tasty and AUTHENTIC (y)

Ok ! Can someone tell me whats so Belgian about this bakery ! 

Reading Some nice reviews and Seeing some pretty pictures I decided to pick up some valentines goodies from this outlet and headed to mani square right away, And seeing the desserts was quite intrigued as well only to be reminded of the saying Never Judge a Book by its cover. And my hopes fell flat with the first bite . 

The New York Cheesecake just put me off . I am a huge fan of baked cheesecake and i feel  besides one of two outlets ( not taking names) nobody in the city makes a decent one and my list only gets longer with this one . The cheesecake was so dense and there was no lightness to it . and i just didn't like it one bit . 

Coming to the Next dish we ate was the tiramisu cake.... The taste was delicious and the presentation was perfect , a little boozy-ness would have been appreciated, otherwise what ever points i have given are just for this ! 

We had also packed some stuff for home and family . 

The Carrot Cake to begin with was delicious only in the cake bit i don't now why they slathered it the caramel / butter scotch sauce and made is dangerously sweet .

The Almond and Pistachio Cup Cake was the biggest disappointment  The Base cake was too dry ... it had a very pronounced vanilla and it just had no impact . The cream on top was decent as frosting but the meager sprinkling of thin almond flakes and chopped pistachio left no impression and it just tasted too heavy 

The Last was the much talked about Red Velvet Cheesecake ! Firstly I don't think this is a cheesecake, rather a gateaux with cheese flavor . although it was very pretty and this cake used was not a red velvet, Red velvet needs to have a hint of cocoa and should be red to beetroot-ish in color  and this was hot pink. I don't know what makes its a cheesecake. 

overall I feel that the chef focused 100% on looks ... and 20 % on finesse and flavor balance . 

All i can say is , i had huge expectations out of this place. and its was just another random cake shop for me . No Impressions lasted,  not even a lite

This place is really cute. And the cakes are worth dying for. I tried the red velvet cheese cake,and it was spectacular. The portions were magnificient,and considering the price tag of Rs 110,well worth it. But to be impartial,the frozen ones tasted much better than the ones at room temperature. Something the management might want to look at , perhaps ? Have heard that the Bailey Cheesecake is spectacular too. Will try that one the next time I visit.

We visited this kiosk at Mani Square with lots of expectations, mostly given the reviews on Zomato. But our experience has exactly been the opposite in almost every sense of the term. 
On our way back to office from lunch, we picked up quite a few cupcakes, cheesecakes and tarts - almond pistachio cupcake (2) , blueberry crumble (2) , chocolate Nougatine (1) , strawberry cupcake (1) , Bailey's cheesecake (2) , New York cheesecake (1) , Red velvet cheesecake (4) and espresso tart (3). Oh, we paid INR 1480 for such a handful of items. I will 'pick on' each of the items separately.
Almond pistachio cupcake - STALE. It was simply stale, from the base to the cream, it tasted absolutely awful.
Blueberry crumble - Nothing extraordinary, an absolutely run-on-the-mill blueberry cupcake.
Chocolate Nougatine - Everything ends in its name. It was stale, tasted weird, failed to impress and helped lose all faith in a chocolate Nougat.
Strawberry cupcake - Bleh. Stale. Bleh.
Bailey's cheesecake - Cheesecake with a chocolate sponge cake base? Huh? The cheese tasted pretty good though. Impressive to an extent but not when you think of the price shed for the same.
New York cheesecake - Awfully sour cheese and again helps forget what a good cheesecake tastes like.
Red Velvet cheesecake - Sour cheese but decent red velvet cake. It tasted awful when I took a bite just after entering home with the packet but the frozen one tasted quite good. Quite so.
Espresso tart - Tart with cake inside? Interesting but nothing extraordinary. It did have a considerable explosion of coffee taste and smell in it though, but I am not sure if I would like to have it every time I visit Mani Square.
I am really not considering paying a bomb for such awful bakes anymore EVER AGAIN. Bye Belgian Bakery.

This is a relatively new yet very attractive outlet in the Mani Square food court.The wonderfully designed and decorated outlet is bound to draw your attention and bakery items on display are look even more attractive.When you pass by this outlet it is hard not to sample any of the items on offer.

The last couple of times I have visited Mani Square I just couldnt resist the tempting items on offer.But unfortunately I felt few of the items did not taste as good as they looked.The fact that the prices are quite high made me feel that the quality did not justify the price tag and the appearence.

Among the items that I have had here are-
1.Chocolate Caramel tart-It was decent.Nothing extra ordinary.
2.Peach tart-This was quite nice.The peach was fresh and the whole thing was nice and flavorful.
3.Fresh mint chocolate cake-It was a big let down.I felt the chocolate cakes at Cakes or kookie jar are far better.
4.Blueberry crumble-It was also okay but I did not like the consistency.It ought to have been softer and fluffier.
5.The New York cheese cake-This was by far the best.It was one of the best cheesecake I have tasted.This is one item from this place that I would surely recommend.

In short,you are bound to be attracted to this place the next time you visit Mani Square.Do try their cheesecakes..

My search for some decent cheesecake ended here. Found this delectable shop after a movie screening and was drawn to the display cases. The sinful array of baked good were really tempting. But my eyes locked on the word cheesecake and 
I was hooked. I tried the Bailey's cheesecake and boy was it good!!!! the creamy cheese was perfectly set with a beautiful hint of the liquor. I was in heaven and I actually closed my eyes to enjoy this!!! the heaven didn't last long as i gobbled it up in record speed but it sure was memorable. Awesome!!!

Yesterday, my friend and I were at Mani Square, and we just spotted this lovely bakery with gorgeous cakes on display. Hungry after a movie, we decided to pounce on the numerous treats, and I took back home the chocolate caramel tart, New York Cheesecake, and a couple of crunchy caramel chocolates after the man told me that only the crunchy caramel chocolates were available. After getting back home, I shared the goodies with the sister. The chocolate caramel tart was very good, if a tad too sweet. It had a thin layer of caramel between the thick chocolate ganache topping and the crisp tart base, although, personally, I would have perhaps wanted the caramel layer to be thicker. The Brownie Cheesecake was tasty in parts - the base was very dry, and the cheese they used was weird with the sourness overpowering the creaminess, rather than adding just the tang, which is generally what a cheesecake should be like. The disappointment for me was the crunchy chocolate caramels, because although there was an abundance of nuts and chocolate, there was no hint of caramel, or any flavors, and it made me sad.
