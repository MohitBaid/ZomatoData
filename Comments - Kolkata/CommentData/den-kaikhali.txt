It was 31st night and we were not having any plan. Lately we decided to go there and grab a drink. After we hoped there, we saw there was a party going on (stag entry @1500 bucks/person, unlimited cocktail and food). The DJ was good and the food was awesome, hospitality was superb, but the cocktails were very bad, so we ordered separately. The starter items were impressive and we enjoyed a lot that night. I went O2 2yrs back, that time the crowds were not up to the mark, services was bad and that time I decided not to go there anymore, but now its improving and I will be visiting soon.

This is one of the old bars in the O2 Hotel which already have few bars and restaurant in it. I liked the decor of the place. They serve chilled beers and other drinks. The food is tastely like the other restaurant in O2 hotel.

We were there with family members. The ambience is very good and cozy. From the parking area they got busy with us. Service and staffs behaviour is very good. They were very cooperative but the most disappointmenting thing is their food quality though starter was good. Biriyani was horrible. Paneer dish was not upto the mark. But chicken stu was quite good. The restaurant is quite costly and I think only upper class can access this restaurant.

Did not meet our expectations. The starter, of course, was superb. We ordered Corn cheese nugget which was awesome. But thereafter, everything was nosediving, one after the other. The moment we started having the starter, the waiter came with the main course waiting to serve. Crew definitely need training. The main course too was average. Paneer Butter masala and Veg Biryani was below average.

This restaurant inside O2 hotel facility used to be my one of the most frequent visited place 2-3 years back, before the entire place go renovated. But after they appeared with the new look, don't know why, an exorbitant price increase has come into picture. Trust me, it's not that much high class restaurant that 2 beer, one vodka and one starter would cost you 1800 including tax.
Coming to food, definitely the fish finger is worth a mention. The special tartar dip (white sauce made of mayonnaise) is really mouthgasmic. You can also try the chicken chilli boneless.
However, if you are ready to accept the high pinch in your pocket, this is the place to be with your loved one to spend a nice quality time. Coz now a days, they don't have much rush like they used to have before.

Wanted to try something new and hence landed up visiting this place. Service was ok and there was nothing much to talk about as far as the ambience is concerned. However, the food was good and loved the tikka. Best thing about this place is that they take orders till 11:30 PM even for drinks. So might just suit you if are leaving late from office someday since most of the others in New Town do not take orders beyond 11PM. Moderately priced and yup lastly, you could watch the IPL along with your drink! Not worth planning for but can visit if you happen to be close by.

Food is average in comparison to the ambience.
Starter was yummy (authentic fish kebab) but main course and prawn biriyani was disaster. My expectations were very high as the food is really costly. Can't give a thumbs up. Sorry.

Nice dinning layout with bar attached with good variety of food and beverage.  Good nice stewards does their job pretty well by suggesting good combination of food and beverage. Must say that the honey dip crispy chicken in the starters is fabulous and goes really well with almost all the alcoholic beverages are served. Decor is very subtle an sets the mood for a good dine. Overall a good foodie hub.

I visited this place once with the family.
Ambience- Average.
Service- Average.
Decor- Good.
The taste and quality of food is also kinda okay!
Nothing special. 
Only the Chinese dishes and the Kebabs are a bit good.
The taste and quality of the other dishes should also be given more attention as they were not that good. 
This place has a lot to work on!

The food is really awesome and so is the ambiance.....Its got a open kitchen that really raises the experience...
Though a little expensive, the place really worth it.....I went with my parents and bro several times and every time the food was up to the mark.......Mostly we tried North Indian and Chinese....It`ll cost around 2000 bucks for two people without the alcohol...

I held my daughters birthday in O2..They were very courteous and had offered an enclosed room for our 10-12 guests..The food was nice but I was pleasantly surprised by service which was top class..Also KKR winning the final on the same was the added bonus for all..I would definitely recommend it for any small parties.. Though the cost is slightly on the higher side its definitely worth it thanks to the staff at O2.

Having been an inhabitant of Kaikhali for over 20 years I was in O2 for quite a few occasions. I admit that not many classy people visit it. Also smoking is allowed which being a non-smoker I hate the most. But, I don't have much complaint about the food quality. The price is to a bit higher side though. I would prefer take away than taking family to dine.

its a nice bar in the VIP area specially due to the fact that the price is reasonable and food is decent. their seating area is big so getting a table during peak hours of weekend shouldn't be a problem. that's one of the plus points of this place. they have separate parking area as well beside their hotel so, that is helpful as well.
we mainly go their for chatting with friends over a peg or two of our favorite brands. i felt their kebabs are better comparing with the chinese starters. ambiance is good and waiters are friendly. service is fast and food is tasty.

Visited O2 during a party. Firstly, very cheap crowd. The dance floor is small and clumsy.
I also did not like the interiors. I think they could improve a lot.
Secondly, the music is bad here. Bad collection and taste of music.
I did not enjoy the party! :|

And the food too was not upto the mark. They only served domestic brands in liquor. And, all were not even available.
So, was not impressed really.

I dont want to visit this place again. I seriously wont.
okBye.

What a relaxing place to kill the time while waiting for the airport checking time! Just go on sipping slowly your favourite drink with soda and ice while waiting for your dream lunch items to be served. Let your mouth burp after that Cold Soda with the drink goes inside! Do not forget to  have the varieties of starters along with your drink.

O2 is the best place to have quality food around Airport area. Price is on the higher side compared to the quantity. I had their awesome "Tengri Lababdar" which costs around 300 bucks for 2pc which I think is too much. Their chefs are well trained and are almost every dish I tried was fabulous including Bengali cuisine. If you are hungry and don't want to travel too much to get a quality place to eat around Airport then look no further.
