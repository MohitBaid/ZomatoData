This new takeaway/delivery joint gives super high quality food at a very nominal price. I feel their kadhai paneer and Malai kofta is out of the world.
After a long time I had such satisfying food. 
Good going team.

We planned to get the food delivered at home and we were thinking of some good place at reasonable price when this new famous joint "Turban Treat" was suggested by some of my friends. So we decided to try this place. First of all let's talk about the price. I found the price to be really very reasonable. The prices will never pinch your pocket. Then the taste and the quality of food were just mesmerising. We ordered kadhai paneer, Matar pulao, Pindi chole and ghee roti. Each and every items were outstanding and every1 in the group enjoyed the food. I am definitely gonna order more often from this outlet. Well done team.

a place to have quality food at a reasonable price. the quality of food is very good as well as hygienic too. during this durga puja we order 35 packets of food for Thalassemia¬† as well as Cancer survivor Kids, Turban Treat¬† provide the quality food at a subsidized rate. Hope in near future we will get opportunity to work with each other.

a big thanks to TURBAN TREAT and its team
