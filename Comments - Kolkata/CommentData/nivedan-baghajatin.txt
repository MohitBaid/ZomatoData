Disgusting food, disgusting delivery. Zomato should remove this restaurant from their list in order to maintain their standard. I ordered chicken kabiraji, mix schezwan noodles and chicken 65. The kabiraji seems to be some pre-cooked cutlet just dipped in egg and fried, noodles are okay but the chicken 65 is something I couldn't eat more than one spoon. It seems to be some chilly chicken gravy in which lots of yogurt has been added.
Disgusting service.

This little tucked in baghajatin very near to the iris hospital & big bazar. This place has been food since many years although might not seem fancy to any daily dwellers' eye. So far i have had their food home delivered.

Till date i have tried the following:-

1. Fish fingers(H) - 4 pcs of medium sized fish fingers provided with kasundi & salad. It had good chunk of basa fish without any excess stuffing of other stuffs. Very tasty & the marination was upto point. Loved it.

2. Garlic naan - 1 huge naan divided into 2 sprinkled with chopped garlics & light butter. The naan was tender & was not overpowered with the taste of garlic. Again lovely preparation.

3. Chicken bharta - The quantity impressed me the most. Taste wise it also won my heart. Sliced chicken pieces with full of semi dry gravy with half egg. The dish was not flowing with too much of oil which was impressive.

4. Chicken pakora - This was the only disappointing item i have had so far from the place. The pakoras had too much batter rather than pure chicken chunks. This had 4pcs. Could improve this one.

The place offers more multi cuisine varieties mostly from indian & chinese section at affordable rates. Looking forward for more!!

PROS:
A nice place to have evening snacks. Sulaiman happens to be their famous roll-maker. Quite affordable prices.

CONS:
Not enough space to dine in with your entire family. Quite ill-behaved employees. No washroom in a restaurant.

This small restaurant or eatery to be accurate, is located near ramgarh bus stop. Ordered twice from this place, only for take away. Chicken rolls and fish fries are considerable at this place. Had ordered biryani too at this place, but it was not at all a good dinner that night. Prices are very low, seating arrangement also not that good. For grabbing a roll when nothing is nearby, this eatery then comes as an option.

Its not the first time i ordered from nivedan, but i must say they have degraded like anything.. it was a complete waste of money.. not a single thing was even edible. Worst possible food. Ordered fish fry, chicken manchurian, mixed fried rice. In case you dont want to be embarrased, never order food from here.

Located in gamgulybagan on the main road. There food is amazing. The rolls are a must try.  Chinese is also good.. What they lack is a bit of ambience if u want to sit and eat. The average delivery time is also on the higher side

This place is really, really bad. Go there well before you actually need your food. They'll keep you waiting and waiting and waiting until you're tired of waiting. And then, they'll keep you waiting some more. And this is irrespective of the rush or the order you placed. There might be 5people waiting along with you or 2. It really doesn't matter. The only thing fast enough, is maybe the rolls which you can see them make in front of you. Other than that, its a horrible, horrible experience added with the fact that the person at the check out is someone with a lot of attitude. On top of that, the food is quite below average.

P.s. they took 1.45hrs for 5plates of fried rice and 3 plates of chicken.

After standing for at least 20 minutes I got my order in hand for take away. The order was 4 packets of chicken biryani. Biryani was stale, pieces of chicken had only bones in them. Earlier we had brought chicken Hakka noodles for evening snacks. That was average. Bt after the horrible biryani experience we have stopped visiting this place

I have been to this restaurent since it had opened and was fond of its rolls then. It served one of da best rolls. But to my surprise, my recent visit here has totally proved my earlier notions wrong. The quality of food has soo much detoriated tht I was served almost raw chicken in a not so fried paratha. Never going to visit here again..

I ate the chicken rolls from this food corner and its very good while once I have tried biriyani which wasn't good at all. Earlier the chicken chowmin was one of a kind here but I think due to change in cooks the quality also went down.

Pocket Friendly small AC restora. Food quality average not well maintained regularly. Sometime you will get fresh foods sometimes not. All items are not available at all time due to non availability of cook. Service and quality deteriorated a lot. The person who sits in cash misbehaves without any reasons.

Nivedan - It was the first sit and dine  A.C. restaurant in Ganguly Bagan.

I am not going into the history of this place instead moving directly into the review part.

* Food quality is average.
* Foods you can try - Rolls ( Good ), Kathi Mithi Fish Tikka ( Average ), Chicken Lababdar, Mutton Kesari, Paneer Do Piaza, Garlic Rice, Chicken 65, Thai Prawn & Kashmiri Alurdom ( best )

Pros - 
The don't change any service tax* All inclusive. Price is pocket friendly.
Home delivery are much faster.

Cons - 
The service is slow if you are dining inside. 
Space is congested, you wont be comfortable to sit and dine there.

this once used to be my favorite restaurant near my home but since they renovated i don't know why but the taste of the food has  degraded . 
the food review :
the restaurant used to have an awesome and affordable mouth watering menu of food. dinner fr two would cost u around 180 with fried rice and a chicken the quantity was and still is sufficient fr two person the only thing which changed is the taste.the rolls are worth trying for especially the chicken roll is awesome. the ambiance after renovation is superb. my rating of 3/5 fr good ambiance and quick service. not fr the food tough
