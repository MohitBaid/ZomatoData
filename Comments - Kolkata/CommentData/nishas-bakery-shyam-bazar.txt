Nisha's bakery is my favorite place to turn to when the sweet tooth calls for attention. She has liqueur chocolates and cupcakes that make delightful gifts and I specifically love how she infuses flavors with the liquids. Coming to her cakes, it's blissfully fresh and light and a chocolate lover like me could probably order 1 pound of her chocolate cake and eat it all on my own! I recently got a birthday cake customized for a friend who loves the colour blue- and she crafted a beautiful ombre. Give her the wildest orders and she will be quick to take up the challenge!

I ordered a cake, pizzas, garlic bread and focaccia bread from Nisha. Loved the taste and the presentation. Nisha was polite and took my suggestions when selecting the design of the cake. Was amazed by the final result. Everything was just delicious and the guests loved everything!! You need to try it once to actually know how good Nisha's bakery is. Would be returning again and again.

Thank you Nisha for the effort and doing so great in such a short notice.
