The stuffed omlette was the only good thing about the platter.The chocolate shake was not up to the mark too.Not the best place to order your food from.

"Customers don’t expect you to be perfect. They do expect you to fix things when they go wrong". The Indian Chai understands this very well. No wonder, I'm giving it five stars this time. I don't give five stars often or easily. I don't even remember giving five stars to any restaurant or food chain recently. But this, this is what I'd call perfect customer service. And folks, this is not just about the service but let me tell you about its food. There is a reason why I have consistently stuck to this restaurant in spite of it messing it up for the first two times. The Indian Chai makes it a point to listen to all your complaints and issues and fix them. There was an issue with the service at first which was about packaging but trust me the second time my food was packed very well. The food has been delicious since the first time itself. This is why I would overlook the packaging issue. But they fixed it the second time. And third time onwards it's been perfect. This is probably the fourth time I've ordered from The Indian Chai and I'm absolutely impressed with its service and the food. And guys, don't hold on to the misconception that reasonable/low price means compromised food quality and quantity. No no. The quantity and the quality and the taste, everything is just perfect. I guarantee you'll not find any other restaurant in entire Kolkata that will serve you such delicious food at such a reasonable price. And, since I've been quite a regular customer you can (though it's just my fourth order here), they sent me a nice tasty chocolate cake for free which came as a surprise to me and I couldn't be more happy. I'm just so impressed with The Indian Chai. I'd recommend it everyone. The Indian Chai has clearly showed how important the customers and their reviews are for them.

After checking out the menu, the restaurant looked quite promising. Tried to play it safe with the first order, going for Hakka Noodles & Schezwan Chicken. The Noodles were just about ok, too much soya sauce. The chicken however, wasn't even close to what one would expect out of Schezwan Chicken. Too sweet! Schezwan and Sweet? Come on!
But then again, thought of giving it a second chance and ordered the Chicken Satay Combo which has two pieces of Chicken Satay (No seasoning, Sweet again), Butter Parsley Rice (Again please add some salt, Seasoning matters!), Chicken Sausage (Did not even taste like Chicken sausage) and Salad.
Total Mood spoiler!

Last sunday being a friends birthday we decided to have a small ladies party at Indian Chai.We were pleasantly surprised to see the commendable job done by them to do up the place to provide us enough space to enjoy to the fullest.The rightly cooled Water Melon Lemonade served in the begining was refreshing and the mint had added just the right amount of  minty flavour to the drink.We were then served with Chicken Lollipops which were both sweet and tangy and wetted our appetite for more, what followed was an ample amount of Hakka noodles and Fish Manchurian,thankfully Kolkata Bhetki and not the tasteless basa served at other places.The grand finale was the choclate brownie triangle with vanilla Icecream with drizzle of hot choclate sauce....simply heavenly.All this came at a very reasonable price, prefixed by the friendly owner Jharna Vaidya,she was present through out the party and played the gracious hostess.They even provided us with music to help us to shake our legs.In short we had a brilliant time. Definitely going back for more.

After seeing the restaurant turn up and I thought the offerings looked rather interesting, Quite disappointed. I just happened to order on Swiggy... Chicken Cutlet, Mutton Chop and Prawn Cutlet.

Chicken cutlet did not resemble image, Was much smaller than expected. The prawn was okay, just dry and tasteless (crumb was perhaps too rough). The mutton chop had a decent size, but was delivered almost cold.

All in all nothing had the homemade taste I expected. The filling seemed to have more potato. Tasted dry. I honestly prefer the style where the meat filling is surrounded by mashed potato and then crumb-fried.

Also, it is unfair to charge for basic packaging like many restaurants are doing now.

Though the prices seemed quite reasonable, the food did not do justice to amount charged.

I hope the restaurant will look into these.
