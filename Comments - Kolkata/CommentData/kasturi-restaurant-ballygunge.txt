Going all traditional on the last day of the year, we visited this place to try out its well known authentic Bengali spread and boy!we absolutely loved it.
Their mouth watering dishes including the top voted kochu patar chingri satisfied our hungry tummy to the fullest.
The staffs were super friendly and quick.
The ambience was nice.
The place is a bit costly yet it is a completely value for money experience.

I don't think much is needed to be said about Kasturi and its traditional spread. I'll leave the ambiance out because I don't think that's much of a factor here.
My first experience here was a while back with friends, one of whom was visiting from the US. We had the regulars and the specials we loved were Topshe fry, Chitol Maach er Muitha, Dhokar dalna, and of course the Kochupata Chingri... Uff, pure bliss! 
My only gripe, flies flock the place, especially in monsoon... barring that, food, excellent, taste excellent...value for money and fast service. What else can you want?

Extremely satisfied with the food quality.
Bhapa Ilish and Prawn Malaikari were superb. 
Reasonably priced I would say. 
We were regulars for 6 Ballygung Place. But they have got competition in the neighborhood now :)

I don't stay in kolkata anymore but come here to see my mom. So was not quite updated with the new restaurant over here. A friend recommended this place and took my mom for dinner. The ambience canbe better since its a fine dining place. However the food is next level. Be it the quality or taste,its 5/5 .The service is also very nice. 
Next time you are them. You can try the crab, kachupata shorshe chingri and bhetki paturi.

Going traditional here!! So, it was my grandparents' anniversary and what better way to celebrate it than gorging on the flavours of Bengal? We chose Kasturi since it maintains its reputation of responsibly reminding one of home and all its loveliness. To start off, once you enter the place it exutes a peculiar homely aura with the elaborate windows shaped with grilles and hinges, the kind you find in Bangali houses a lot. The food is served on stainless steel utensils which reminds you of home once again... So when it comes to decor, it is simple, serene and there is nothing artificial about the place.
We started our Sunday lunch with,
Fish Butter Fry-- I would implore everyone to not leave Kasturi without tasting this utter bliss of a fry. Though truth be told, the dish was soaking in oil, it was sinfully beautiful. The batter was spot on and the fish was out of the world with a melt-in the-mouth texture. What took the fries to a whole different level were the dips of kashundi which was plate-scrapingly delicious and the perfectly light mayonnaise served along.
The mains consisted of Shaada bhaat and Dal for the first course with some Jhur jhure aloo bhaja. The aloo bhaja was perfectly crispy and the golden brown tint was visually beautiful.
The next dish tasted was Kochu pata bata Chingri which is the stellar dish of this place and hands down, it deserves every hyperbole it receives. The combination is a match made in heaven and the spice is on a higher note but unlike other spicy dishes, the spice is not blandly hot but rich and refined and would leave you wanting for more... Highly recommended for sure!!
Bhetki Paturi on the other hand failed to win our hearts with the texture being a bit too grainy which takes the subtle moisture away that we look for in a good paturi.
As for the Mutton Dakbungalow it deserves all the stars there are. The gravy was rich and full of flavours, all that you look forward to in a "Sunday kosha mangsho" dish.
The only thing which came to our utter disappointment was that they had run out of their much acclaimed Chitol Machher Muitha which we were really looking forward to.
We ended our splendid luncheon with Nolen Gurer ice cream which remains my favourite flavour of ice cream of all times... The ice cream was delicate and rich with the infused Nolen gur flavours blooming on the palate which didn't fail to put a smile on our faces.
The staff was perfectly courteous and helpful though a bit slow in delivering orders. Yet they were commendable when it came to recommendations. In a nutshell, it was a most fulfilling experience at Kasturi😊

One of the popular and loved food joints in town, Kasturi offers yummy food in Bengali and Bangladeshi styles. The interiors are simple and decent, but the food taste is one to remember for a long time. On several occasions I had taken home delivery from here, and my favorites include "kochu chingri" and "bhetki paturi". Both the dishes taste very good and the quality of fish were uncompromising. Overall, a budget restaurant serving authentic bengali cuisine.

Food was good no doubt, ambience clean and ok.. could have been better though, but service was pathetic. We were told that the fish fry might take long. About 10 mins. We said fine we can wait 10 mins. Surprised that the fish fry came in first..and thats it.. the rest of the meal was served after 45 mins that too after many reminders and requests,   that we have a flight to catch. Even then they took their own sweet time. The daal, rice and kochupata chingri came in and the pabda maach was missing. Waited and kept reminded them about the fish and finally when we asked them leave the fish and get us the bill, as we have lost all interest in food... the fish was served.. Never had to wait so long for food to be served, and that too 4 simple dishes..daal, rice, kochupata chingri and pabda shorshe.. 
Please go only if you have a lot of time in hand.. about 2 hours at least..!!

You can take a bengali out of bengal but not the bangaliana. Kasturi is a boon to a cusine dying a slow death amidst the pastas, pizzas and continentals. Food is lip smacking. It reminded me of food that used to happen during family gatherings which is now a rare phenomenon too. Kucho chingri, shile bata chicken and postor bora are the three things that will remind you of your grandmother's hard work in grinding home made spices to add a zing to these dishes and lost memories. Mutton kasha with plain rice will remind you of hungry and lazy Sunday afternoons. Chingri malikari, bhetki paturi and fish fry would remind you of the old style Bengali marriage ceremony dishes. Overall an overwhelming experience..burp!

If u want to taste the perfect Bengali food item them this is the right place for you. We opted for thali nd then besides orderd for bhetki paturi nd chicken vorta in allacarte. In the thali every food item is mouth watering. The paturi is a delicious. Chicken batta is a good taste nd in the thali mangsho kosha, basanti pulao ,hilsa shorshe, alur dom dahi are just a perfect treat to your appetite. Do visit this place nd you will surely love this place.

Kasturi seems to offer the authentic Dhakai food. One of the famous food items is the kochu pata chingri bhapa which was a pre planned order for me. It turned out to be good enough. But the shukto was not up to the mark. The mug daal and jhuri aloo bhaja were fine.

One of my favorite Bengali cuisine restaurants.
Food- the must haves are -- kochu pata chingri bhapa, mutton dakbanglo and basically all the fish items! I'm an ardent fish lover hence I mostly had the fish dishes and they were brilliant.
Ambience-- very basic. Nothing to rave about.
Pocket pinch-- around 1500 for two for a complete hearty meal.
Overall-- one of the better places to have Bengali comfort food.

Why is it that during puja, quality goes down and prices also rise. Kasturi charges a bomb but gives bad food in return. The hilsa we ordered was semi cooked and felt like eating boiled fish. The prawns in their most popular dish--- kochupata chingri was also of very poor quality. I don't get it why people stand in line for hours to get this kind of food!?

Was there during durga puja.. Ordered prawns pulao and pomfret shorshe. prawn pulao was a joke.. With full of raisins (kismis) and hardly any prawns(if i can count not more than 3)!! Pomfret shorshe was good but when mixed with prawn (rather kismis) pulao the mustard gravy went sweet and the experience is hardly worth mentioning! Hence 2.0/5.

I liked everything about the restaurant! Will surely recommend this to all. Do visit once this Durgapuja and try their Puja Special Thali. They have a lot of varieties. And I liked the taste of Hilsa a lot! Even the mutton kosha was very tasty and well cooked! Good job done guys! Keep it up!

Kasturi specializes not only in Bengali cuisine but also in Bangladeshi and Dhakai cuisine. Several of their signature dishes including Kochupata Chingri Vapa and Mochar Ghonto are must try for new customers. But my experience at this very outlet of Ballygunge was disappointing.

There is not much to say about the interior but the service was terrible. We waited for at least 10 minutes before someone came to attend us. For starter we ordered Fish Butter Fry. It tasted nice with the mustard sauce but it was a little oily. The Hilsa season was on and I really wanted to order some Ilish Biryani. They heated some Basanti Pulao with one piece of Fried Hilsa and served it as the Biryani. It smelled and tasted nothing like Biryani and the Hilsa was also bland. The mutton Dakbungalow was nice though. Instead of serving one whole egg with the Dakbungalow mutton they made the gravy with it.

If you really want to have the Kasturi experience I would suggest you to visit the New Market outlet.

It's a small restaurant with a minimalistic decor located at Ballygunge near Patha Bhavan school. I knew their specialities from a friend already and hence din't experiment much and ordered Kochupata Chingri Bata, bhapa illish along with the basic moong dal,alu posto and bhat. The Kochupata Chingri Bata tastes surreal. Loved the other items that we ordered as well. I give Kasturi a Thumbs up!

Visited during ilish festival and only 2 or 3 ilish dishes were available. However 20 or more such dishes were mentioned in the menu and it was also said that a plate of complimentary rice comes with each ilish dish. Neither did we get the complimentary rice dish nor did we get to choose from the ilish dishes.
Coming to the food the bhetki fry was tasty. The sorshe ilish and the rice which we bought separately were cold. The sorshe was not well cooked. The quality of ilish was good but the food was not tasty nor was it served hot. 
Would never like to visit this shop again.

Very disappointing place. Ambience not so good. Service pathetic. Had asked for help in choosing the dishes, however was of no help. Ordered Alu posto, dhakai alu er dom, kadai bhekti bhappa and pomfret fry. Quantity is quite minimal and a tad bit expensive . Took an hour and 15 mins just to prepare the food. I don't know what the issue was when it wasn't even crowded. Major disappointment was that we were served stale food which smelled - dhakai alu er dom was stale.  Kadai bhekti bhappa was okay. And pompret fry was burnt. Give this place a pass. Very dissatisfied.

Sunday morning, monsoon season, and a couple of Bangalis - enough reason for major Elish cravings. After some searching, we settled on Kasturi, and it was a great decision.

First things first - my earlier complaint with Kasturi (New Market branch) was the rather nauseating smell of fish that floated around the place. This one is far cleaner, and the staff is also surely better.

We kept the menu absolutely simple - steamed rice, Kochupata diye Ilish Bhapa for me, Baked Ilish for my husband, and one plate of Kochupata Chingri. The fish was delicious - and the gravy mind-blowing. You could understand that the shorshe bata is freshly made, and the smell of good quality shorsher tel will fill your senses (as well as your eyes). We overate, as expected - and it didn't go down very well on our digestive system for the next couple of days - but our minds and hearts were filled to the brim!

Did not have any place left for the famous Choshi Payesh - so will be waiting to come back here soon!

You eat good food and you have a feeling of "I'm blessed to be a Bangali." I got this feel in kasturi. I went on a date as my special one really likes bong food. The menu was so confusing that we thought of ordering the whole of it :)

So, finally we had in our plates bhetki paturi, dhakai mangsho, mutton dak bungalow, shona mug daal and rice. 

The food is so amazing that we forgot that we were on a date.

Bongs are known for their rich cultural heritage, art, music and food. And in this ever-expanding world of fast food, sometimes all we crave for is a good homely platter of bangaliana as comfort food.
The moment you step inside "kasturi", you get this homely vibes.
The staffs are very welcoming, so is the tantalising smell and the warm atmosphere.
One just cannot miss the quintessential dish "kochu pata chingri bhapa", "chittol maccher muittha" and the "choshir payesh".
With every bite, you fall in love with the delicate flavours and end up visiting this restaurant again and again.

Not upto the expectation..I went their with my family.. ordered several dish..the most attractive and tasty was their starter crispy gondhoraj chicken..but bhetki paturi and sarshe kochupata die Chingri was not good..and chital kotha was the worst..it didn't have any fish on it..atleast I didn't feel it..but nevertheless hoping that it can recover soon with this kind of item..

Kochu pata diye chingri bhapa is the most awesome dish here, tastes yummy with plain rice..and their signature dish as well. We also tried lachha paratha..quite heavy and tasty...mutton dakbanglow is not so good, although pieces were soft but instead of fried boiled egg..it has egg bhurji gravy which is common in mutton moglai/korma. In starter fish livergin was good, we also tried chicken polao..which is polao with 2 pieces of chicken rezala, the taste of both polao and rezala are on the sweeter side. We ended with nolen gurer ice cream, 2 scoops @140, but there is no liquid gur topping on scoops like 6 ballygunge place thali (although 6 ballygunge place thali charges 1 scoop @125/-). Overall value for money and recommended. Note- GST 18% and no service charge.

The restaurant is quite small and has prompt service. I have been there several times and have also ordered home delivery. Now coming to the food, my favourite of all time is their kachupata chingri, its delicious to say the least. The daab chingri and the bhetki patudi is also great. Overall i love their menu and the extensive choice of food they have. The only complain is that not all items are available everyday. So your luck matters too.

Kasturi is the best place in Kolkata to experience the taste of bengal in reasonable price.This outlet is located in Ballygunge near the montessory section of Patha Bhavan School.

Have tried their 'Kochu Pata Chingri',it's their signature dish,unbelievable,terrific in taste.
'Chitol Muthiya' is one of their best items which is my dad's favourite.
 Another key item is 'Bhekti paturi,'it's over the top,delicious and divine.
You can try also the 'Aam doi' or mango Curd in summer.
Go for the fish items rather than Meat or Chicken.

People only prefers 6 Ballygunj Place or Bhojohori Manna when they opt for bengali cuisine. But Kasturi is also quite good. The price is the best part. Almost same quality food in those big joints cost much higher. The ambience is ok. Service is more or less fine.

Whenever I visit Kolkata, I always try to have at least one lunch in Kasturi.

This time I ordered, “Kachupata Chingri”, “Gandhoraj Chicken”, “Aaer macher jhol bori begun diye”

All items are very good in taste and with proper quantity.

It is a good place for Bengali food.

Must have is the dhonepata diye pabdha. I recommend to have unique dishes in Bengali/bangladeshi cuisine - you won't get these dishes elsewhere.

Definitely recommended for at least one visit!

Most of the dishes not available. Prawn tampura fry came with additional hair into it yakkk.. Then rice was ok. Mutton dakbunglow was ok but not as expected. Then comes the horror Bhetki paturi was awful fish quality not good salt and mustard also missing. Won't recommend.

Kasturi serves the authentic bengali dishes which means the chosi pithe of Dhaka even.My husband is a bangal person and he loved the chillies in the food which was so mouth watering that me being a ghoti could not stop myself from gorging on the fish preparation.The ambience is average and the service is quite fast I must say even on a crowded day.The portions were enough.And we were satisfied which says it all.

We ordered for the first time from this outlet a few days ago and it wasn't good at all.

The order was only one item,that is,Rui Kalia but it really failed to impress.

The piece was fish was fresh but the gravy was such a disaster.It wasn't a kalia in any way and was rather a thin yellowish gravy of turmeric.

The cost was INR 125 which was simply not worth it.

We got a grimy plate and a fork with residue on it. They appeared least bothered when we brought it to their notice. 
We ordered Kochupata Chingri Bhapa, which was mostly oil and salt. The dal was fair. The rice was good in quantity and quality. And Kadai Bhetki Bhapa, Doi Rui and mishti doi for dessert. Although the mishti doi was decent the other dishes were overloaded with salt and oil. The only thing I appreciated was the size of the pieces. 
Definitely won't visit this place again.

Been to this exotic place to relish my bong side many a times with uttermost satisfaction with every single visit . The combination of contemporary bong cuisine to exotic Dhakai Bengali dishes are to die for any day . Even the aromas of the handpicked spices make me fall in fondness with their wide spread guilt free authentic out of the ordinary serving with almost no time lag between placing the order to get it dished out without any distortion in the quality without fail . It compliments my bond foodgasm with every immaculate dish to their signature offerings staring from smoked bhetki and fish kobiraji to kochu pata bhapa Chingri to ilish paturi . To summerize my experience in one liner I would see " enter hungry , leave happy ... for only quality meets exquisiteness " 
I am a proud loyalist their authenticity & hospitality !! 
An innate foodie should never miss out on exploring the bong side of their taste buds and what better dine out than kasturi coz all is well that ends well "

Sorry to say but these guys are just a useless bunch of corrupt people who are not bothered about anyone, they just want to make profit at the cost of even your life if required the way they behave. These people are a shame to the restaurants of India and no wonder people from abroad have such a horrible impression about our restaurants here.  Just see the comments section below this to watch how the coward operator of kasturi restaurant has responded to my review by trying to threaten me and how his white lies has been caught. These people of kasturi are a bunch of goons and a police complaint should be filed against them for trying to threaten their customers. They even create fake ids in zomato to give positive reviews about their own restaurant to push real reviews which expose them down as is quite evident from the fake new accounts with 1 review only here.   I ordered  some food from these crooks online and till one and a half hours they did not bother to respond, after one and a half hours they say that the dish is not available when its already late night and nothing can be ordered from elsewhere. These good for nothing crooks should be taken to task and I seriously think there should be some regulators to take these good for nothing crooks to task because of their sick and disgusting attitude. They dont deserve even 1 star rating, I wish the 0 option was  there. So beware of going to these crooks as they are looking for an opportunity to screw you to fill their dirty corrupt pockets. I would request all users to file a complaint against this restaurant and this person at india.gov.in/lodge-complaint-online-national-consumer-helpline-portal and here nationalconsumerhelpline.in/foodSafety.aspx and also here consumercomplaints.in/bycategory/restaurants-bars

Now lets come to the criticism part... It was a Sunday lunch and they said for luchi we have to wait for half n hr, so we could not order..  The water they provide (if you are not opting for mineral water)  is PROBABLY not from any water purifier.. Though not quite sure about it.   And the worst part: it's really annoying while the waiter looks at somewhere else while taking your order...  They have to be more professional in my opinion.   No tips for them.

My wife has eaten here several years ago and coincidently her friend recommended it today, that's how we ended up here. And we'd also heard about it as a popular eatery for authentic Bangla food.

The place is very small but we didn't have to wait long inspite of a short waiting list. And the ambience is also very ordinary. Hence I was banking on the food. We ordered 
Chicken buna, dhokadalna, kachu chingri which are all typically bangla non veg dishes and I'm predominantly vegetarian. Ofcourse we also ordered various other items. My in laws were very satisfied with the food. They rate it 4* purely for the food.

My rating is 3* overall for the food, ambience and service. The service is non-impressive. And the tables struggle to accommodate 4 adults, we also had a kid with us.

We ordered,plain rice,basanti pulao,luchi,paneer,bhaja masala aloo dum,gondhoraj chicken,dhaniya chicken,mutton kasha,begun bhaja,aar machh,kachu chingri,and nolen gurer icecream.
The food was good.

A place with no grandeur or elaborate interiors but exquisite food! We had shukto, echor, bori begun diye aar maach, tel koi and parshe! It was the first meal after touchdown in the city so we only wanted to focus on a variety of fish and have that sumptuous Bengali fishy meal! Echor was absolutely amazing but parshe stole the show and I want to accommodate another lunch here if there are any empty slots in the next few days! Service was very prompt. No regrets what so ever. Generously giving a 4.5 (Bengali bias) to this one for quenching my craving for fish!

P.S. : I wish they had a branch in Mumbai!

The reason why I started enjoying Bengali cuisine. If you suffer from a similar problem : go to Kasturi and sort it out.
Binge on - chicken bata , dhakai Bangla chicken , bhetki paturi and bhetki bhapa. Club it with Chanar Dal , and luchi and aloo bhaja , remember not to eat the plate.

When we talk about "authentic Bengali cuisine" and that too in Kolkata it's sure to raise some brows! But when the food comes from Kasturi it raises the bar of taste rather than questions! I've been here quite a few times and today also it didn't fail to mesmerise me with its simple yet fascinating array of food..I mean where do you get "kucho" maach and that too which tastes like straight out of your mother's 'henshel'! Ah! Loved it to the very core... We love their kochu pata diye chingri(a must have once you are there), but today we ordered rice, alu fulkophi r rosha, pathar mangsher jhol, kucho maach and chicken daak bungalow and I can't choose one... Each one stole my heart away... Kudos to the chef and the team for making every experience so memorable and fulfilling!! I love the food you serve and I would request each and everyone whoever is planning to dig deep in bong ranna or if you can give other cuisines a miss for a day, please do try Kasturi! You will leave with your mouth and hearts full...😘😘😘😘

A reasonably priced good quality Bengali food restaurant..Kochupata Chingri Bhapa is a must try..those who have allergy or are vegetarian, can try Kochupata Paneer Bhapa..Baked Bhetki Paturi, Butter fish fry,  Mutton Dak-Bungalow,  Daad Chingri all are really very good..Shil-e-bata chicken is a very different item and it tastes great..Chosi r Payesh,  a dessert,  is excellent..

Rating Kasturi as a vegetarian would seem unfair, but they are so good that even the limited vegetarian spread is to die for. Whether it be the daal or the Kochu pata diye paneer bhaap, every thing was lip smacking. Although oily the baigan bhaja is a must try. The staff is also super friendly and their service impeccable. I would highly recommend this place and am definitely coming back soon.

I visited Kolkata recently and wanted to try some Bengali cuisine. So thought of trying some fish items at Kasturi @Ballygunge . I am normally try to avoid preparations done in mustard oil/sauce, but I must admit that food at Kasturi was absolutely delicious. I tried the Daab Chingri, Kadai Bhetki Bhapa, Ruhi Kaalia etc @ Kasturi during my stay in Kolkata. Each dish had a unique taste and was very delicious. It is a must visit for me in my next stay at Kolkata... Food was just amazing @ Kasturi.. Loved it

We went their outlet in Ballygunge recently. Food was extremely fantastic. Bhetki paturi, Baked bhetki bhapa, Chitol er muithya, Daab chingri were awsome. Even the Vegetable-daal and the Shukto were too good.  A very decent place for having extremely good old bengali food.  However they have space crunching in this outlet.  So go early for getting you table.

A place to head to for a hearty Bengali meal. Its décor and ambiance is without any frills; but what wins the heart is the food and only the food. From a basic meal to a king's spread, Kasturi is the place to head to. If you are on a budget mode then Chicken-baata and rice can be the food to order; and you will not be complaining. And if it is a family feast time then go ahead and indulge....there are innumerable types of fish/mutton/prawn/chicken to choose from; and rest assured the gravy of each type of fish and each type of preparation will be different (eg.an Aar Kalia will be very very different from a Koi-er Jhol) and the fish will taste like it has been cooked in the gravy (am writing this in detail, because this is often not the case in other Bengali restaurants that have mushroomed with fancy themes). A personal favorite is the Kochupata Chingri, have tried a multiple times to decode and recreate at home, but failed :( Their Aar Bori Begun diye jhol, Koi Fulkopi Rosha, Tel Koi are as authentic as it can be; they also remind me of the dishes made by my Grandmother.Apart from Chicken baata, another tasty chicken side-dish is the Daakbanglo Chicken (which is liked by my Non-Bengali friends as well).Kasturi over the years, with innumerable trips have never disappointed me; and that itself speaks a lot about its consistency and quality.

It was my MAMA'S birthday treat .I am not really in favour of the idea of having bengali foods outside when i get to eat that everyday at home . But there are resturants that just tempts you with their magic and the smell of their foods irresistible .This place is one of them . Loved their bhetkir paturi ,kochupatar chingri (though a lil salt would have been more awesome) ,basanti polou and mutton .I loved the Paturi especially :) Won't mind ordering from here a few more times !

I have already eaten at Kasturi, Gariahat, but yesterday owing to Diwali, we got food delivered to our house from this branch of Kasturi. 
I've seen this outlet many times before as it located right next to Fish fish. Very centrally located. 

Coming to the food. It was fabulous. Each and every item tasted wonderful, but my only complaint would be regarding the quantity. It was just not enough. 

• Jhuri alu bhaja - large quantity. Perfectly made.
• Koraishuti diye moong daal - amazing taste and quality. The quantity was also alright. 
• Alu fulkopir rosha - there were exactly 3 pieces of cauliflower and 4 pieces of potato. The taste was average. Did not really like this much.
• Chicken sheel e bata - I don't even know what went wrong with the quantity here. The size of the box surprised me. Like literally. It was such a tiny container. Basically this was mashed chicken which tasted good, but again, the quantity. 
• Chicken dakbungalow - horrible pieces of chicken. Literally. 3 pieces in one plate. And we had ordered 3 plate. Still none of the pieces were big, or meaty. Only bones and nothing else. I have no clue how they end up packing such ridiculous pieces of chicken. The taste of the gravy however, was impeccable. 

Over all, the experience was quite disappointing. The items tasted really good, but the quantity was another story altogether. The chicken pieces infuriated me. 

I remember being very content with my experience at the Gariahat outlet, but I'm sorry, Kasturi you've majorly let me down, that too on Diwali. 

Pocket pinch - 1195. The prices are less, I agree but the quantity HAS TO improve.

We went there on the day after Lakshmi Puja. The crowd were already lined up outside and the hotel staff were doing nothing to smoothen the process. After a long 1hr wait we were finally let in.
We ordered the following:
Rice
Topshe Fry
Posto Fry
Dal
Dab Chingri
Mutton Dak Bunglow
Kadai Bhetki Bhapa
Bhetki Kalia
Kochu Chingri
The food took another 1hr to arrive and meanwhile the staff was rude and laughed at our hungry faces whenever we asked for food.
The fries and dal were plain.
The Kalia arrived when all the food was over and it was not tasty and definitely not worth the wait
Dab Chingri and Dak Bunglow were the best and almost made us forget the staff's rudeness and the disaster of the Kalia and the vegetarian dishes. Kochu Chingri ,their speciality was also good. Kadai Bhetki Bhapa was okay

So on dosomi we decided to have a grand lunch at this place. We reached the place quite early and were told that the restaurant opens at one. Quite a bureaucratic mentality since they didn't even offer us to sit inside.The management should take note of this if they wish to survive in the future.

The ambience is so-so. The waiters were helpful, patient and friendly.

The food:
Kasa mangso was amazingly well done.
Kachu patai chingri bhapa what with its pungent mustardy taste is their magnus opus.Don't miss this one for your life!
Chital muitha is another delectable dish. The bhetki pathuri wasa little bland when compared to the rest.

The service wss prompt and we left as extremely happy customers.

My request to the management is to allow people to sit inside even if they have arrived a little early especially when they are accompanied by kids, rather than making them wait on the road!

For a non Bengali like me who wanted to experience authentic Bengali cuisine choosing Kasturi was the best decision. 

It is a small place but don't underestimate it looking at it's ambiance. The centre of attraction is its food. 

I tried some of their dishes like prawns, Bhetki fish, Hilsa fish and some more. Everything was just outstanding. Each dish had a distinct flavour and taste. Just enjoyed the food here. 

Next time when I visit Kolkata it would be a must visit place.

Known for its authentic Dhakai Bangladeshi cuisine, this place is a Bangal's dream. Though the ambience is not great, the food makes up for it.
We ordered Kochu patta diye Chingri bhapa, Daab Chingri, Shorshe Ilish bhapa, Bhetki maccher paturi, Mutton Dak Bunglow, along with 2 plates of Bengali Fried Rice.
Kochu patta Chingri is my all time favourite. A delectable combination of shrimps, Kochu patta, mustard and poppy seeds, it will leave you licking your fingers. Daab Chingri tasted a tad sweetish as it is supposed to. No one can complain about the Shorshe Hilsa bhapa because after all, it is the king of fishes( for a Bengali) that we are taking about. Bhetki maccher paturi tasted out of the world. A bit on the spicier side, it is truly finger lickin good. No complaints regarding the mutton 
Dak bunglow also. The Bengali fried rice tasted like the fried rice mum makes at home and it was really good. Indeed,all the dishes are praiseworthy.
This place is highly recommended. If you want to taste Bangali Dhakai khabar, this should be your go-to place.

I went there on Durga Puja (saptami) and had to wait outside for a long crowd. To be honest, very poor service, especially the gate man who showed partiality for their regular customer and let them enter first instead of their late arrival. After some argument, we got the chance to enter in the restaurant. Now coming to the food, they were unable to serve maximum number of items due to their unavailability. It is very disappointing to hear no from the waiter after such a long waiting for lunch. Additionally, their service was so slow and we had to call them again and again to order extra items. We ordered plain rice, sona mug dal, aluvaja, chingri malaikari, vetki paturi, rosmalai. All of these items tastes quite good but not up to the expectations. Overall, an 'ok' grade restaurant with very poor quality service on the most important occasion of Bangali, Durga Puja. I would like to request the restaurant manager to kindly be prepare for these kind of occasions so that people have to wait a less and got a good service along with a great food.

Kasturi has served a good bengali cusine, I really liked their speciality sheel baata chicken/fish. It is really a nice thing to try. We have orderd Fish Khabiraji which was good in size and also taste wise succulent. 
The Kachu patha chingri and bhapa bhetki was too good.

Food pricing is affordable.

Among the cons it is very small restaurant and they have limited menu. 

Please guys give us more bengali items to relish.

Starting with aam panna sorbot was not good.
Sukto was good, polao had more ittar essence, kochu patay Chingri-r bhapa was good, doi illish was a bit sweeter, sorse illish was not good and worth eating.

I am in LOVE with this place. Went here for a lunch date and both me and my partner were blown away by the food.His family is a Kasturi regular,but it was my first time.  Though the ghoti in me had her pride wounded by the eclectic baangal style of ranna, the foodie in me achieved culinary orgasm. 
We ordered 3 plates of rice for two people and although it looked like the rice would be insufficient for us at first, we had to literally force the last few morsels down our throats. We had the rice with Sona mug'er dal with peas(one bowl is enough for 4 people, I mean it), Postor Bora (3 to a plate), Bhetki paturi (two succulent fillets of fish in a spicy mustard sauce wrapped snugly in a banana leaf) and their house speciality, Kochu Pata Chingri (that one bowl had innumerable prawns and the marriage of the taste of the prawns with the strong flavours of shorshe was just perfect)
Coming to the price. It came to Rs.541 without taxes and 651 with it. Definitely going back.

P.S. For bringing in the authenticity of Dhakai Cuisine they are a little liberal with their use of 'kaancha lonka', so tread with caution.

 Specially the bekti macher paturi which is boneless steamed fish in banana leaf and chitol macher muithya. The kosha mangsho and luchi are a must try .

It's one of my favourite Bengali restaurants in Kolkata. Much pocket friendly than other ones. Quality of foods are beyond any doubt. My best item here is Kochu-Chingri which is so much delicious that I ordered it twice. Only problem is when you enter this restaurant, you'll find it much like roadside hotels not like fine dine restaurants. Parking is a really big issue here. You have to come here either by taxi or bike. There is no place to park your car. And you have to pay in cash, cards not accepted here. But all these issues are negligible coz there foods are awesome.

Bengali food at its best with prices just about right.
The chicken sheel baanta is the best. It's spicy but one hell of a tasty unique dish.
I love their sorshe baked fish . Paturi ...Tel koi...moong dal are must haves. I just wish they were little more better for delivery services.most of the times their delivery guy is not at work.abd they ask us to pick up.

The Bengali dishes prepared by Kasturi are quite authentic. I tried out the Mochar Ghonto and Kochu Pata chingri and both were fantastic. They were truly well cooked and tasted delicious. It is rare to find dishes like kochu pataye chingri or Sheel e bata chingri, lotte shutki etc. as most of the Bengali restaurants do not have such dishes on their menu. It is a must try. The Mochar Ghonto tasted different but it is very tasty. 
From the vegetarian dishes I tried the Paneer which was lip smacking good. 
I would recommend people to try out Kasturi...

A horrific experience indeed.Being a sunday and having kids exams round the corner had decided to order a home delivery.Simple menu; Kaski  maach, dhokarr Dalna, aloo Bhaja, mug dal peas, kosha mangso, bhat.
This order took more than 2 hours and a few reminders to be delivered less than 1km away at Ballygunge Circular Road.The delivery boy explained burning up of a water pump as the reason for delay to the best of his eloquence.The stuff delivered at last made the hungry pounce on it.Alas! No Rice.Could not wait any longer; had to manage with brown bread.
When the restaurant was contacted initially they disowned the order of rice.However on being reminded of familiarity with their concept of bowl and plate rice, they could not deny but were clueless on remedy.Not even the courtesy of offering to deliver rice was extended.
I write this feedback to prevent anyone else's family sunday getting spoiled like this.

Our first visit to a Restaurant offering Bengali Cuisine specially Bangladeshi Cuisine... After having so much review in Zomato we choose to go there for a lunch.. We go to Ballygaunge Outlet nearby London Paris Mukti world/ I.T.I stoppage(3 to 4 mins walk).. We ordered the following -
1. Plain Rice : A bowl of fine basmati rice. We need to take another plate of rice to complete the meal.

2. Kochu Pata Diye Chingri Bhapa : A Must must must try... it was really awesome.. best dish i would say only at Rs. 110 + Tax

3. Ilish Bhapa : Waste of Money.. one piece cost Rs. 350 + tax... Would you believe!!! N top of that the fish not at all tastes like best hilsa.. very disappointing.. 😩

4. Chicken Dakbunglow : Nice preparation of Chicken. It some kind compensated the worthless hilsa.. Cost Rs. 180 + Tax

5. Chosir Payes - It was ok as a dessert.. but not soo overwhelming.

Overall a moderate experience. Still I'm giving 4 rating because of Kochu Pata Bhapa Prawn and Chicken Dakbunglow..

I have visited the Ballygung branch of Kasturi Restaurant few days back with a non-Indian food blogger friend of mine as she wanted taste authentic Bengali food and when it comes to authentic Bengali food Kasturi is one of my preferred choice . This branch serves decent food and it is easier to park vehicle outside and that is why I went there instead of Mustaque Ahmed Street branch (the original Kasturi) which is obviously way better than the other branches,. We have ordered Non-veg thali there which I found quite decent and comprised of Rice, Moong Daal, Aloo Posto (I did't like much the way they prepared aloo posto; probably because they followed the "Bangal" way of cooking and aloo posto tastes better when prepared following the "Ghoti" process) , Aloo bhaja, Chicken Curry, Chutney , Papad , Misti Doi and Aam Panna. The thali is sufficient for one person and almost all the dishes are taste like home cooked food. apart from the thali we have ordered Shorshe Ilish Bhapa which was perfect to the tastebud (quality of Hilsa was nice and the gravy was the quintessential Bong style Mustard gravy), their famous Kochu Patta diye chingri Bhapa and Shukto.. Subtle in flavour almost massed tarro leaves cooked with shrimps Kochu Patta diye chingri Bhapa is something worth trying at any branch Kasturi including Ballygunge.

For a pocket friendly restaurant , it is not so bad🤑. But it fails to keep up to its name.  #Firstly, the decor and ambience is okay-ish.😓 ##Secondly, choose yur table carefully unless u want your  ilish  with a side dish of toilet-odours. 😷

Food : 
Kochu chingri --- order. One of the must haves along with Daab chingri. (Options limited. Rem. This name. )✔✔✅✅☑

Bhetki bhapa -- DO NOT order.❌❌❌  It was the most awful tasting dish I've been served in a restaurant in many years. ( Please try to ignore the bhetki dishes unless u just can't do without them )❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌

Chicken bhuna .-- tastes like chicken -jhol- (normal gravy chicken. ) Mom's chicken tastes better P.S . ✖

Lachha Paratha -- DONT. ORDER.  They do not know how to make them . Seriously.  ❌


Also. For a restaurant of this prominence , hygeine shud be a priority . However , they serve in melamine dishes and not glass and the whole place looks and feels like a shabby old Dhaba. 😕

If u haven't tried it. Do 
If have.,..... Then don't bother again. Thanks . 😘😘

I went here with my colleagues on a weekday Afternoon. And good food always gives you momentum for next meetings. The location is near patha bhavan in ballygaunge place. Inside, the restro has okayish space and neat decor. Coming to food, we have ordered for gondhoraj  chicken as starter, followed by luchi, rice, chitol muitha, sheel bata chicken, kochu chingri. The last one mentioned is their priced gem but I felt the taste is better in Kasturi esplanade. Gondhoraj chicken was okayish. Sheel bata chicken was good. Rice was perfectly cooked. Then chitol muitha was again good but not so great, it tasted sweet while I would have liked it spicier. 

The service was good. Pocket pinch was okay.

Very ordinary ambiance , nothing fancy , offers simple Bengali food . Still had a waiting for about 10 mins on a Wednesday afternoon . This place is really popular among locals . My Bengali friends recommended this place to me. I had promfet Jhal , prawns in spinach and mustard sauce along with this lobster in a coconut curry . The prawns were too oily 
The taste was average . Not that great 
Probably i am yet to develop a taste for Bengali cuisine .

Ordinary. Good for only those Bengalis who don't cook much of the fish variants and delicacies at home. Average taste of food, the decor calls for a complete overhaul, cleanliness needs drastic improvement and the services also leaves a lot to be deserved. An average place for a quick lunch if you are hungry and it's the nearest place to drop in.

The quintessential joint for authentic Dhakai cuisine..this franchise has grown leaps and bounds over the last few years and have earned a respectable spot in the cullinary map of Kolkata.. tasteful, authentic food coupled with accomodable rates, is what defines this place..
This particular outlet is one of the biggest, located in Swinhoe Street, the same building house Fishermen's Deck on the 1st floor.. coming to the decor, well it gives you a homely feeling.. not much props or artefacts used, few wall paintings,  simplistic, clean and hygeinic.. Service can be an issue at times specially when it is full as you will find servers not listening to you, goofing up your orders or even have to ask for water repeatedly.. Definitely they have done their basics right and have focussed on the food which simply left you contended and craving for more.. we sampled:
Kochu Pata Diye Chingri Bhappa: Small sized prawns cooked with Yam leaves in a mustard paste.. a traditional dhakai dish and a flagship recipe of kasturi..  loved the strong aroma of mustard and interestingly the kochu leaves tasted quite good.. 
Kaju Kismis Diye Mochar Ghonto: Another traditional bengali veg curry with banana blossom/flower as the primary ingredient, it was a bit sweetish and tasted good with rice.. 
Dhakai Ilish Biryani: Another of their speciality,  well it is more of a pulao than biryani..  the fish was overly fried and the rice lacked the aroma and flavor of Hilsa fish.. 
Chicken Dhakai Bhuna: Ordered on server's recommendation..  it taste beautiful..  simple,  subtle flavors will remind you of the mutton/chicken curries our grandmother used to cook every sunday.. 
Daab Chingri: Small river prawns baand served inside a Green Coconut..  the fizziness of mustard,  sweetness of coconut flesh and the prawns make a delightful combination.. Passionately Recommended.. 
Mutton Kosha: Simple,  subtle flavors,  not too much usage of spices but will leave an everlasting impression on your taste buds.. 
Mutton Dak Bungalow: Quite different from the one we have tasted in Bhojohori Manna.. this was more dry and thickened gravy and instead of whole boiled egg,  the egg yolk was mixed with the mutton itself..  interesting and packed with flavors.. 
Chosi er Payesh: Another Bangladeshi delicacy and a forgotten recipe.. cooked with rice flour mainly..  tasted decent enough.. 
Overall we had a truly wholesome and quite nostalgic lunch there and revived the taste of a few dishes long lost from the bengali kitchen.. Our total cheque was approx Rs.1900/-(incl tax) for 4 people.. Just wanna say keep up the good work Kasturi and continue satiating our craving for dishes from our roots.. 
Food: 4.5/5
Pricing: 4.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Kasturi has been on the back of my mind for a little over a year , because it's Bangladeshi fare has been a tempting draw. But I finally settled down for their Home Delivery option and a delightful surprise awaited me and my family. Our order included Mutton Dak Bungalow , Chicken Dhakai Bhuna , Kochu diyeh Chingri Bhapa , Kaski Macher Chorchorie , Bhetki Kaalia. On a relative note , Chicken Dhakai was overshadowed by others, but Kochu Pata diye Chingri Bhapa had stolen the show. I wish to forewarn people that the food is really hot and spicy with dollops of mustard paste, mustard oil and fiery green chillies but worth the trouble.

I basiclly wanted to order dub chingri,but that was not available at that time..and many of the other items were not also available. We were pretty much dissapointed for that. But then the food arrivied,and we just dig in.Sheel e bata chicken was something new that I tried,tasted good. Their quantity of bans pora mutton dissapointed me,but it tasted just so amazing. The bhetki preparasn was also good,but I concentrated mainly on their chingri malaikari. The size of the prawns just satiesfied my long quench of having jambo prawns. The gravy was very light yet so delicious. I almost ate two big jambo praws..😎 We wanted to order fried ice cream with nalen gur for desert, but it was also not available. 😑 So we had fried ice cream with chclt sos,it was okayish to me. I am visiting soon this place. 😄

Kasturi was always the best option for the Opar Bangla food in the city. Known for its Dhakai cuisine this place has some signature items which need to be part of your meal. The kochu pata with prawns, the chicken bata, the paturi and their mutton preparations should be part of your order. The chiton peti is big but not tasty. The food has always been a bit oily but has been finger licking good.

Their food was easily rated a 4.5 earlier but may be due to the expansion of their business or the pressure of catering to a waiting line of visitors in a small place, there has been a sharp decline in the overall standard of the food. The taste is no longer irresistible.

The posto Bora is a let down and they don't seem to  care for your sweet tooth. Some little changes and am craving to rate it a 4.5 soon.

Went for a grand Sunday lunch at Kasturi recently. A group of 6. We totally loved the food! We had ordered the following apart from Rice:

1) Dal/ Alu Bhaja--This was  simple and good  10/10
2) Shukto-7/10
3) Alu Posto-71/0
4) Kosha Manghso-- A bit on the oily side but the taste is fab 9/10
5) Bhetki paturi--9/10
6) Daab Chingri -7/10
7) Kochupata diye chingri-9/10

Delicious finger licking Bengali meal. Another thing to note the service was quite fast and prompt, we had ordered a total of 25 plates food and they served us the same in 10 min tops!

Amazing service in Home Delivery! The person who took the order, was very cordial and had a pleasing personality. He also suggested the right combination. The delievery was on time.... And most importantly... FOOD IS AMAZING 👌. If they can maintain this all round service, Kasturi really has many more miles to go. All the very best!!!  SAD TO INFORM THAT EVEN THE DELIVERY MAN CALLS TO CONFIRM THE ADDRESS AND ASKS FOR RS. 5O AS DELIVERY CHARGE WHEREAS THE PERSON WHO TAKES THE ORDER SAYS THAT THEY DO NOT CHARGE ANY DELIVERY COST.

Kasturi is THE place to go when craving for authentic dhakai bangal cuisine.

**Location**
This outlet of the brand is located at Ballygauge near Pathabhavan primary school.

**Decor & Ambiance**
The establishment has two floors for sitting and casual dining. The Decor is nice and clean nothing extravagant to mention. 

**Food**
For starters we had
 Fish finger and Gandhoraj chicken
Fish fingers were served with a side of kasundi and meyo .. It was soft cruchy and serves hot which had set the introductory impression high. So as the Gandhoraj chicken.

Mains
Plain rice 
Basanti pulao
Sona moong Dal 
Alu bhaja
Kochu pata r chingri bhapa- Prawn delicacy 
#MustTry
Bhetki paturi- #Amazing
Dab chingri- #MustTry
Mutton Kasa
Dhakai Chicken 

Desserts
Misti Doi
Aam doi #MustTry
Fried ice cream 
Rosomalai #Good

Food was really delicious and suited our palate quite nicely. Yummy :)

**Service**
We were a big group of 16 people and we even took food to go. The service was remarkably nice and catered really well.
Well behaved and courteous. Loved their hospitality and gestures. 
Recommend...

Much to my surprise, Kasturi is an authentic & budget-friendly Bengali restaurant, that's perfect for the discerning culinary enthusiasts. Food is primarily Dhakai. Mains were on my radar, which included Prawn Malai Curry, Chitol Muitha, Paarshe Shorshe, Rui Kalia, Bhetki Paturi & Mutton Dakbanglow. Each & every dish had an excellent Dhakai flavour till the last bite. Spiced well with mustard, onion, garlic & chillies, the dishes offered a fantastic culinary joyride. Served with steamed rice, these lip-smacking & well-done dishes tasted simply GREAT. A must-try for the fish lovers, especially those who have a soft spot for Dhakai cuisine.

Let's first talk about the waiters. They are one of the worst I have ever seen in the WORLD! We wanted to try out a lot of dishes but he went on egging us to order mutton dak bungalow ( we realised why he did that later). We had vegetarians in the group, but he was audacious to suggest that they also have mutton dak bangla. While there was kochu pata for the prawns, but when panner kochu pata bhapa was asked he said that are out of kochu pata. 
The mutton dak bungalow which he pushed us to order was pathetic and uncooked! People could hardly chew through. When we complained they refused to get it off the bill. Such a waste of money. The begun bhaja and postor bora are yuckks too. Low quality food at this outlet. The nagerbazar outlet is far better.

Being a non bengali, I don't really remember the exact names of the dishes, but we had one bekti patori (steamed in mustard curry), a mutton kosha, chicken dish I don't remember the name and dal. I am in love with kasturi's food, and I'm definitely going to visit again.

We had booked tables for 8 of us in family on a hot sunday afternoon to celebrate my mother's birthday. We had high hopes as the original Kasturi in New Market is legendary and zomato gave good reviews to this joint as well. We arrived there and ordered our food and drinks and were served within reasonable amount of time. I am not a big fan of having bengali food outside home but I was impressed by this place. Very good food...quality and quantity are of high class other factors like ambience service hygience etc are quite good. Keep up the good work.

Great food for price. Awesome for bengali cuisine lovers. Kochu pata chingri is the best. The place is small and cozy. Go only for food dont bother about the ambience. I love to come here again and again.

Kasturi is a popular Bengali food restaurant famous for its dhakai cuisine, which is a must try. Prices are quite reasonable, compared to other such Bengali food restaurants. In starters,their fish fry is a must try. Their mutton dishes and chingri and ilish mach preparations are absolutely lip smacking *_*

While the food here is usually faultless. Im giving this place such a low rating because of the absolutely pathetic service we have experienced here every time. The waiters act like they're doing you a favour by honouring you with two mins of their time. Starting from the beginning we asked for mineral water. The bottle came out dirty and warm. We asked to change it to cold the waiter agreed but few mins later when the water hadnt been changed and on repeatedly requesting the guy said that there was no cold water. Mineral or regular or even ice. I could delve into the details but il spare you the story and just let it be known that at the time when we were served food  we had no water on our table. Even the mocktail that came with the thali was hot. When we asked to at least put some ice in it the waiter just shrugged his shoulders and walked off. The rest of the time the same story happened. Food on the table. But no cutlery. The waiter sensing that he will be asked for anything ignored the table inspite of repeated calls by us though he was standing really close to us. Also. Theyve a new specials section of sizzlers and smoked fish etc. Not one dish was available from the new section of the menu. Which we were told fifteen minutes after we ordered from that section. So in short. While i do love the food here. The disrespectful treatment by the servers. The lack of basic courtesy. And the sheer irritating lack of manners is enough to turn us away from this place for good. Im not even going to bother mentioning the dishes we ordered or what we liked from it cos as per usual they had their routine delicious taste. But that does not excuse the "service" if we can call it that at kasturi which is equivalent to if not worse then what you get in roadside stalls. Never again

Hi ,  I am keya , visited your place on the 14th of April  with my daughter for lunch . after a brief waiting session our call came , we offered a seat , and gave our order without showing much patience to our taste buds . we ordered for  sona mug dal , postobora , alu vaja ,kachupata diye chingri , mutton kosha , chicken duckbanglow , chingri was excellent  chicken was nothing special to mention but  the mutton was a disaster .  we complained the boy taking our order but he didn't agree then I spoke to the authority , but they told me that none complaints about that before me .anyway , if my daughter insists me , I will visit there once again but we would opt for their veg dish and / or fish only

7 in the family went there on 16th April.
Ambiance is good. Food is also good but not excellent.
We did not find many of their fish items ... kachupata die fish, chitol etc...... waiter informed us no supply of fish that day.... pity. 

We had rice,sona moong dal with peas ... sorry but in home I have thicker dal... it was not/ bad quality sona moong daal for sure..... though tested good.
Aloo bhaja was dry and smelled like not fresh.
Sheel e bata chicken was excellent, sheel e bata chingri smell like raw (may be nothing to do with the taste of this dish ... it is like that only).
Chicken Dhakai Bhuna was good and mutton dhakai rezala was great.
Fish Finger and Prawn cutlet was also very good.
Fried ice cream was not available so we had to satisfy ourselv with rasomali (good).

Big downside we saw the serving utensils ...... the still bowls were looking old and dull. Please look after your presentation .... 

As it is close to my home I will definitely visit it again to give my final comments.

My friend who had come down from Delhi told me about this place and my reaction was "How come I haven't heard of it". So we decided to go there for lunch. The place would probably not score anything on the ambience front to be honest. Basic place with nothing to write about but clean!. 

However, where this place scores is food. Delicacies like Dhoker Dhanga, Kochu Pattar Chingri Mangsho and Dhakai Dal would give a lot of finer places a run for their money. Well cooked meat, well seasoned and tasty. But beyond everything satisfying. However, there were some negatives which need to be addressed like the non availability of breads for lunch. They only had rice. The oil in the food could be curbed a bit and availability of cold soft drinks would be nice (they only had room temperature). I understand its a basic place so the rest could be looked over, but these according to me are basics in a restaurant.

Nonetheless, if you asked me if I would go again, I would!

এই Review টা একটু বাংলা তে লেখার লোভ সামলাতে পারলাম না। When I stay in Kolkata, I generally don't quite like to visit Bengali cuisine restaurants because of only one reason I get those in Home only. However an after office dinner plan happened to be in Kasturi's Ballygunge outlet as it was pretty near to office and our hearts were longing for some comfort food. বেশ ছিমছাম ambiance. The only problem I faced was that the plates were continuously slipping on the glass top table. Maybe a mat should help. 
Coming to the food section we ordered Plain Rice with Moong dal and finely chopped crispy fried potatoes ( ঝুড়িঝুড়ি আলুভাজা) and after the warm-up the showstealers came one after another. Baked Bhetki..fresh Bhetki baked in microwave in a rich thick pungent mustard gravy. Totally boneless this shit is the ideal for any amateur fish eaters. Next came the Queen of fishes. Yea. Hilsa fried and cooked in sour curd. ( দই ইলিশ ) though the hilsa lacked flavour because this March month is not essentially the season for Hilsa still the gravy was quite tasty. But the best and the unputdownable dish of the night was prawns cooked in yam leaf paste (কচুপাতা বাটায় চিংড়িমাছ). A perfect amalgamation of mustard , yam leaf paste and perfectly cooked prawns. Just too good. 

Almost a near perfect dining experience. All the applauds to the chef. Cheers!!

The best way to locate this place is by locating south point high school...I've been here twice and both times i've walked here from Gariahat via Mandeville Gardens

The place is nice and cozy and thankfully both the times that i've visited i've always managed to find a table...the decor seemed pretty ordinary to me...not over the top "bangaliyana" oozing from it's walls...which suits me

But if you're coming here, you are probably doing it for the food!!...and the food here is absolutely delicious...on the first occassion i had ordered a veg combo which comes with a drink(aampannar shorbot),a plate of rice, daal,two veg dishes,aloobhaja,papad,chutney and mishti doi...and on both occassions i had ordered "kochu pata die chingri bhaapa" and "bhetki paturi" separately...the quantity of the dishes seemed absolutely perfect for my apetite...as for the quality, i am yet to find a preparation that is only "okayish"... Every single dish is absoulutely yum!!...make sure you order kochu pata die chingri bhaapa no matter what!!

Come here with your family or friends or girlfriend/wife, you will not walk out disappointed (or half full ;))...this place will definitely be among the top bengali food joints in my list

If you want to taste authentic Dhakai cuisine, this is the place which comes to mind first. Pretty easy to locate, the restaurant is a favourite of mine. Although my roots are in West Bengal, the delicacies of the Eastern side have always intrigued me. I like food cooked slow, non sweet and spicy. That is exactly what Kasturi offers.
I have been here in a number of occasions and tasted their various dishes ranging from Shukto to Mocha Chingri Ghonto to Topshe maach Bhaja and Shorshe Hilsa Bhaapa and so on. On this occasion we kept it simple and ordered for Jhur Jhure Alu Bhaaja, Shona Moong Dal with Peas, and Mutton Kasha.
To me every dish that I have tried is delectable....and it is impossible to rest till I have tried all the dishes available here.
The service is also very warm and welcoming. Ambience is average, but the food more than makes up for it.

This region has a host of restaurants offering the local cuisine, but this is certainly one of the best. The interiors were a bit cramped. If you are here do not forget to taste the KochuPata'e Mora Chingri bhapa. It's hands down one of their best ever dishes. Also Mocha Chingri Ghonto and Ilish Bhapa. Very fresh food at reasonable prices which will leave you feeling satisfied. Worth a visit.

Kasturi is one of the very few restaurants in Kolkata that offers Dhakai cuisine. I have mixed feelings about this place.

Pros: The price is average, quantity is good. We always parcel food from here. We had kachu pata diye chingri (a must try, it is kind of their signature dish), sheele bata chicken (awesome with the right proportion of chilli and sweet), sheele bata prawns (okaish, nothing special about it), chicken dhakai bhuna (excellent!), chicken quorma (average, found it sweet), bhetki kalia (amazing, soft and tender bhetki cooked in a juicy creamy gravy), sorshe pomfret (the mustard seemed to be a bit bitter, pomfret fish was little smelly) and rui kalia (okayish!). You will get authentic East Bengal food here that wont dig a deep hole in your pocket.

Cons: the restaurant is small. So big groups might have a constraint here. If you end up late, most of the dishes will be finished, and you will be left with very narrow options. Many items present in the menu are always not available, so dont have any cravings looking at the menu. 

Overall experience is okay.

All the explicit "Baangali khaabar" fanatics out there should definitely pay a visit to Kasturi. Although not a very spacious restro it happens to be, one may still have his perks of visiting it. Reason? The fabulous food. Rich, delicious and 100% baangali in the truest sense of the term! I have had the opportunity to visit this place a couple of times and I always remember walking out of it happy and satisfied. Each and every dish that we had ordered were super good. Be it normal steamed rice, shona moong daal,jhoor jhoore aaloo bhaja and prawn malai curry, or chittol maachh er muittha and mutton dak bungalow,every single item was worth the price! The signature dish is kochu pata diye chingri bhaapa and lately there's an emerging craze for prawn wrapped in chicken! The desserts are good too, though nothing out of this world. So if you're looking forward to a super rich, pure bengali cuisine, this should be in your bucket list!

Though i am a pure "ghoti bangali",  i so liked the dhakai cuisine rich in taste, with use of sharp pungent mustard and spiced up with loads of green chillies. Three of us were in for lunch and we had the following :
Fish butter fry
Postor bora
Begun bhaja
Basanti polao
Kochu pata chingri bhapa
Bhetki paturi
Baked bhetki bhapa
Mutton dakbanglow
Chosi er payesh

Personally i didnot find the payesh to be a quality fare, the polao was over sweet,  but the rest kochu pata chingri, fish fries, bhetki bhapa and mutton was just amazing. 
The interiors are upto the basics,  and food is really worth the price.

The way I like my Bengali food - spicy (with lots of kacha lonka), pungent (with a lot of sorshe tel), slow cooked ("kosano" for a while) and non-sweet (no chini). Yes, you guessed it right that I am Bangal and this is exactly what good food means for me. 

Everything from the Kochu Pata Bhapa Chingri (Taro leaves in mustard, steamed, and cooked with prawn), to Begun aar Bodi diye Aar Mach (Aar Fish Curry cooked with Brinjal and Lentil Dumplings), to Chitol Macher Muittya (Chitol Fish Dumplings in curry) - lived up to the expectation. The Bhetki Paturi, which I have had parceled at numerous times, meets the brief superbly as well. The Tel Koi, made with hybrid koi (and not fresh water koi) was slightly let down, though not bad.

Today, my parents and I had the chusi-r payesh. Chusi is sun-dried shredded rice-powder and maida dough, which when cooked in milk and mixed with nolen gur, is a deadly combination of winter sweet delicacy. Avoid the fried ice cream here though.

My only wish for Kosturi is in the dessert section which limits itself to either the mishtir-dokan variety of sweets like rasagulla, or to the present-pithe-hype items. That apart, Dhakai -Bangladeshi food has many sweet-savoury dishes, like my grandmom's hatambali (coconut-aamsottyo, gondoraj lebu) and much,much more. It would be great if forgotten dishes make its way into the menu, and if it clicks, could be its unique USP.

We had been to Kasturi on a cloudy Sunday afternoon, we reached their around 2pm and found ourselves behind a long queue! We had to wait outside for about 40 minutes and when we went inside we had to wait exactly 10 minutes just for the waiters to clean the table, and then another 20 minutes for the food to get served!! When the dishes came in we were simply starving and uber-impatient! But yes, then the Kochupata Chingri Bhapa did its trick... and we just started hogging the food.
                                                                ...

Returned to this place after a long time ... last time when i visted this place we dined at the 1st floor at fisher men's deck.. but this time i had a carving for bengali food.. 
we ordered simple bangaliana food .. bhaat,shona muger dal, jhurjhure alu bhaja, hilsa bhaja.. there very famous and talked about kochupatta prawn bhappa.. and chittal jumbo peti.. 
Kasturi is currently the best restaurant serving bengali food.. the best news which i got is the are opeing up at jadavpur which is very close to my home..

I've been to this place thrice by now. And every time I ended up suggesting the restaurant to a number of people. Kochu pata diye chingri bhapa is my favourite. I preferred it every time I've been to the place. Very affordable. And delightful food. Its a cosy place with good service.

After getting used to with run of the mill items, we decided to have our day to day bengali items in a renowned bengali restaurant... while searching Kasturi comes in one of the top listed bengali cuisine restaurant ...
I visited with my family for lunch at ballygunge and just waiting for 15 minutes we had our table ... I didn't have so much high expectations about bengali and bangladeshi dishes ...but after having the lunch completed , it actually proved me wrong... like every dishes I had over there were too delicious and mouth watering...
We had plate steamed rice, pomfret fry , posto bora, Sona mug daal with gobi, Aloo posto, Kachu pata diye chingri bhapa,Bhetki paturi, Chittal Muitha , Mutton Kosha ...
Bhetki paturi and kachu chingri was really lip smacking and finger licking...
Lunch was finished by a touch of tasty chatni...
Service was also good ...

This place has good fish and mutton items. It cannot be compared to the real dhaka kasturi which has much more options than here. Bangladeshi cuisine is something every indian bengali needs to taste. We have so much variety. The bhapa bhetki is something i wud recommend and also.the shutki mach. 
Ambience could be improved .

Dhakai bangla food at its simplest best.Its a hard to find, rarely heard of place (except among locals).. with simple , beautiful food. No fancy cutlery, interiors or menu. A simple straight forward menu , with essentials in place. Whatever else you have, dont forget to have the aloo poshto and moong dal. Light food, with no excessive or unnecessary richness, with sensible prices. It could give a lot of established names in bengali cuisine a a run for their money. A perfect value for money meal. Must Go.

Well bengali cuisine often gets divided by 'epar' and 'opar'. This place gives a perfect palatal soothing by delivering dishes across the border. I went with my family on lunchtime. Dishes like dhokar dalna and postor bora were quite good. But the winner seemes to be dhakai chingri polao and kochu pata diye bhetki bhapa. A beautiful pungent yet satisfying bhetki first time i had in my life. Polao too had tender prawns peeking through the rice. Rui rezala seemed to be really different. A real good bengali restaurant. Would love to visit again and explore something new.

I don't know how people can give positive reviews after visiting this restaurant. Ambiance and quality of food is worse in compare to other Bengali restaurants in Kolkata. Being from a cultural Bengali family I don't find anything new in their menu. I just went there as a food lover and tried few of the items. My honest feedback is, somebody can like their food only if not from a family where anyone can cook good food.

I have earlier tried sholo Ana bangali, tero parbon, 6 ballygunge place and bhojohori manna. But the food in kasturi was the best with decent interior and quantity of food and reasonable pricing, I will deduct 0.5 only because they were little bit spicy. Highly recommended for trying Bengali cuisine.

If you're a 'Bangal-i' you're sure to love their preparations. But don't go in for a Sunday lunch, if you've more than 4 people accompanying. The interior is all crammed in with the untrained waiters jostling and queueing to wait on one and thus adding to the chaos.
The food is exceptionally good considering the price at which they are offering them.
Must tries include Chingri Malaikari, Daab chingri, fish butter fry teamed with that fiery strong mustard sauce, Mutton kosha and any Paturi item.
Overall the experience was the least enjoyable, the waiters looked busy but grumpy and inattentive at the same time.
The only well mannered person was outside the restaurant, manning the door! I'd rather go for parcel-homes next but sure to visit again!

Had food during durga Puja so only take away possible. Apart from the regular stuff of biryani and chicken curry which all was absolutely excellent there was a special dish of prawns and some big,  leafy green palak sort of thing. It tasted heavenly really!  This seems to be the branch with the best food of the three available places.

It was the month of August and  while every day my mom was cooking Ilish religiously at home i was sulking at the "mess-er-khabar" . Until one day when i decided to end my misery. I was bored, tired and disgusted with bhojohori manna so decided to give Kasturi a try! AND boyyyyy ....... it was a grand success
Nothing much .... just rice and a jumbo shorshey ilish was all i had and the taste still haunts my dreams! It was heavenly. Wish to visit the place sometime soon to try out their mutton and prawn!
I was too engrossed with the food to notice the decor or the table or even the plate they served in... but then with food so awesome i don't even bother about the place ... HEAVENLY ILISH!!

Food is good, though bhojohori manna and 6-ballygunje place is better. The place is small and crowded, and gets chaotic at times. The professionality of service though leaves a lot to be desired. The waiters apeared to be para-boys rather than qualified personnel, a policy for cost-cutting  no doubt.

Had ordered food from here during one of the Durga Puja evenings at a family gathering. Had heard of good reviews for their food from my cousins and it got validated by the experience we had. Chitol Muitha and Bhetki Paturi were great and though they did a minor goof-up while delivering one of the side dishes, I would not mind much given the rush they handle during the Durga Puja days. Food can be a little spicy for some but for me it was great. Will pay a visit the next time I am in Kolkata as well.

If you are a bong and you want to eat food which makes you nostalgic to the core? Kasturi is the place to be! I have been a regular at their Free School street outlet but the Ballygunge one does not disappoint! The food tastes the same, though some items stay perpetually unavailable, the brilliance in cooking makes up for it.. Being a non-resident, it has now become a ritual. No trip to Calcutta is complete without Kasturi...

Already on a Zomato high, wanted to try out this place famous for its Bangladeshi cuisine. Being from a "epar Bangla" family, this cuisine was new to me. Too lazy to go out, we opted for home delivery.  I was mostly interested in Kochu Pata diye Chingri Bhaapa and Sheele Bata Chicken, two of their signature dishes. Chital Muitha is a dish I had tried before from another place and loved, so this was added too. All these dishes were to be accompanied by Basmati rice cooked at home. Since our order still hadn't crossed 800, which they said was the minimum charge for home delivery, we took Chilli Fish Dry. 
The best dish was Sheele Bata Chicken, which is basically ground chicken paste, cooked with spices. It tasted really well! The Chingri Bhaapa, cooked with mustard and Kochu Paata, was something I had never tasted before, but liked a lot. Just felt that it had more chilli than I could handle! :P Chital Muitha and the Chilli Fish were pretty good too. This was a value for money meal, as the quantities were more than enough. I would definitely try more of their dishes.

May be my expectations were too high and that's why I am not as satisfied as I should have been! I had heard and read a lot about Kasturi and Dhakai cuisine. However, my first impression of both is not great.  The food at Kasturi left me with mixed feelings.  Some of the dishes were good,  some average.  Nothing was bad, but nothing was extraordinary either. The ambience of the  restaurant is a bigger disappointment. Old and  not so clean furniture, with poor lighting and tasteless decor... there's nothing that will impress you. Moving on to service, the boys there are very nice,  but they don't seem to be well trained. Putting it all together,  it comes across as an average place. I might go there once more to see if they really have anything extraordinary to offer!

Good bangali/dhakai food? This is the place to be.. The taste is really great.. But one has to brace oneself for lousy service..Something that they have to look into.

The quantity is a little less than what you expect.. Thus always leaving you wanting a bit more..

I went with my family and had a really good time.. The Daab Chingri and Chitol Maacher Muittha is a must order.

I was back in Kolkata after a long time and couple of my friends already recommended this restaurant to me stating that this was the place in the city to have best Bengali Cuisine. Being a Ghoti, I didn't get chance till now to try the typical Bangal dishes. Hence I ordered Dabchingri, KochuPata with chingrir Bhapa and mutton Duck bungalow. It was mouthwatering experience and worth every penny. I need to go back there to try the famous Bhekti Macher Paturi as well.

If you love varieties of Bengali fish items then this the place, they cooks most of their item in Bangladeshi way. We were looking to have our lunch in Esplanade area and we selected this place from Zomato, located at New market in first floor. We reached the restaurant around 2.30 pm, then some of the items were finished. Finally we ordered Fish butter fry, Rice, Dal, Alu bhaja, Alu posto, Mocha-chingri ghonto, Bhetki bhapa and Pabda shorshe. The ambiance is all right.

Oh I loved the bengali food in Kasturi! We started our meal with pui shack done chingri and baat and I loved it at totally at the first bite. Then a chicken bata with dal and baat which was lipsmacking! We called for chingrir pakora which was so so... And ended our meal with some payesh which again was nice! The service is quick... If only they could make their food a little less spicy I would give them a 5. I found everything excessively spicy!

This place is located near South Point School, and in the neighbourhood of 6th Ballygunge Palace,Fish fish and Fisherman's Deck. Needless to say this place is one of its kind, I can't remember the name of any restaurant that gave me the satisfaction that I got from this place. I could give this place 5 out of 5, but I am giving it 4.5 beacuse of its very poor management service. We had Jumbo Prawn Malaikari, Aluposto, Fine rice and a chicken dish. All the dishes are delicious and I wish I could taste all of the dishes. I would definitely visit this place again. If you want to taste authentic bengali dishes, and a lazy sunday lunch, this is the place.

This is a place for Bangladeshi cuisine. According to my personal opinion this place is better than Bhajohori manna. The kochu pata chingri bhape is my favourite and I am not aware of any other places where it is available in Kolkata. Prices are reasonable. Although it has recently been increased, the quality of food justifies it well. Service and behaviour of staff is also good. Home delivery service is prompt.

Classical rustic East Bengali Dhakai Cuisine. 
Not for the refined palate. This place is for people who like their food simple, honest & authentic, finesse be damned. 
Worth a try are some local & personal favourites. 
Dab Chingri, Kocchu Pata Chingri Bhapa (exceptionally good), Bhetki Paturi & the surprisingly good Chittal Muitha (Kofta). 
Some of these dishes are unique, while some may be available at other typical local restaurants. 
But, this place has its unique flavours & taste. 
Do try it.

Terrible service. Below average food. Confusing decor.  The feeling I got upon entering the place was of an amateur dining place with untrained interns from a hotel management program, with a cook who thinks everything in Dhakai cuisine has mustard in it. And to top it off, a manager who doesn't pay attention till someone starts yelling. 

Would recommend this place to just one person: my worst enemy!

Went there for lunch in Kasturi, Ballygung on 15th Aug. I must say my experience is mixed, more towards negative. The ambiance and service is very poor. We got our food after 45 mins waiting.
Few items were really delicious, but few were very average. Didn't get any taste or flavor in hilsa. At times I was forced to think whether it is hilsa or rohu.
Laupata chingri was very tasty, so the basanti polao. Their new item doi pomfret is too sweet for my taste bud.
I think apart from food quality , now they should also concentrate on other parts loke service, ambiance and hygene.

And to top it off, a manager who doesn't pay attention till someone starts yelling. 

Would recommend this place to just one person: my worst enemy!

Went there for lunch in Kasturi, Ballygung on 15th Aug. I must say my experience is mixed, more towards negative. The ambiance and service is very poor. We got our food after 45 mins waiting.
Few items were really delicious, but few were very average. Didn't get any taste or flavor in hilsa. At times I was forced to think whether it is hilsa or rohu.
Laupata chingri was very tasty, so the basanti polao. Their new item doi pomfret is too sweet for my taste bud.
I think apart from food quality , now they should also concentrate on other parts loke service, ambiance and hygene.

We went there on last saturday,to satiate our sudden craving for sone real 'jhal' bhartas for dinner.The place was almost emoty at about 8pm,only one table was occupied.we wanted shile bata chicken,and asked for suggestion for something else,on the spicy side.'machee kichu hobena',was the uninterested reply.now for a restaurant known for dhakai cuisine.this is surprising.even worse is the attitude,that they dont even bother suggesting on what is available,even when there is no rush and arounf 4-5 waiters are just chatting among themselves.we have been to their free school street branch and service is much much better there.after some persuation,we settled for 2 plates of loitta bata.
Ten minutes after taking the order,they informed that chicken is not available! we were Just fed up and just took the loitta baata and came back.
the taste of the dish was good,for which i have given some points at all to this place,but the quantity was abysmally low.Two plate means (costing rs.220/-) about 4 tablespoons of mashed fish in oily gravy.that is not acceptable by any standards.
a piece of advise to the management,increase the quantity and do something about your service,only taste would not take you far.

"What's wrong with this place" its been over a year for me in Kolkata and this place has been one of my favourites. Lately something has changed and for the bad. Service is terribly delayed, orders are confused and the taste + quantity has been diminishing. If this the way its going to go forward, few years from now we will only talk about how good this place was in past tense. Hope they pull up their socks.

Not so great for North Indian tourists. Especially Rotis are too thick to be called Chapatis. Should try 'Sukhto', good recipe. Not much for vegeterians, but lots of fish recipes. Also should try 'Dab Chingri', one of the best Bengali Recipes. Can dine once or twice, But don't except mindblowing taste. Overall good.

Went there for lunch for having authentic bengali food, which is Kasturi famous for and our expectations were met. the dishes - steamed rice, posto bora, dhone pata diye paneer bhapa, kochu pata diye chingri bhapa, bhetki paturi, chicken dhakai bhuna, every dish was cooked to perfection and delicious. Specially, the paneer (so fresh and tasty) and bhetki paturi were lip smacking. The aam doi was also very tasty. 
Overall, the price of food though being on a slight higher side, considering the taste of the Bangladeshi food, a thumps up!
Waiting for a second visit!

By far it is the best restaurant which serves bengali dhakai food. It is light on the pocket with amazing taste all through. My picks are Lotte shutki bata, kochu pata chingri bhapa and baked betki. On weekends you need to play the waiting game. We are frequent visitors as well as order at home and have never been disappointed.

I went here yesterday afternoon. The place is a bit small but surely comfortable. Taste wise it serves really delicious food. We started off with Fish Butter Fry, We wanted to have Chittol Macher Seekh Kabab but the staffs were too busy with their parcel and we found them to be a bit ignorant as in many items they said it will take 1 hour time. Then we had Rice, Muger Dal with Peas, Jhurjhure Alu Bhaja. Chicken Sheel e Bata s taste s still in my mouth. Also, Kochu Shak die Chingri Bhapa... The aroma of it truly exceptional. Shorshe Ilish Bhapa and Bhetki Macher Biriyani was moderate. Finally we ender with Payesh and Aam Doi. A perfect lunch by some excellent Dhakai dish. I went there for the first time, except the staff's attitude, its a heart stealer.

A great restaurant where the food tastes authentic and the Kochu chingri is one thing which no one could serve you. Another reason why this happens to be a favorite place to a foodie like me is that it's price. The price is reasonable and taste and quality is highest. Kasturi has an good hospitality too. Overall it should be a must for all Bengali cuisine lovers in Kolkata.

We visited there in 2014 for my birthday celebration. We went there because of some North Indian friends, who did not have any idea about Bengali preparation. When we ordered, we focus on typical Bangal dishes. They loved that food. The overall taste is good. We, Bengali people every day, eat that kind of food in our home, but those have not even tasted this kind of food, they surely love it. The one thing is really bad feeling for us, that is, they used some clothes which were very much dirty and bad smell which was very disappointing.

We were too hungry to go home and eat dinner so Kasturi being close by we dropped in for simple bengali food. Its located in Ballygunge near South Point High School. We wanted to have the Sampurna bhoj but they dint have it at that time so we ordered poster bora, steamed rice , shona mug dal with peas, kochi pathar jhol and hilsa bhapa. To tell the truth I like the taste of Bhojohori Manna far better. This is really simple bengali food. The poster bora tastes like it should. The dal and the mutton was okay. hilsa was nice though. After the meal we opted for rasmalai and it was good no doubt. The place is small and on weekends you gotta wait atleast half an hour. The service isnt that great but the place is reasonable price wise.

I'm very, very cautious in giving negative reviews, and tend to give benefit of doubt in case of a bad experience. But I've been here twice, and have been failed (miserably) in different ways. In the first instance, I went on a weekday for dinner and they refused to serve many of the things listed on the menu. In the latest, and the more recent instance, we ordered for Dhakai Dal fry, Mutton Kasha, Alur Dom & 3 tawa rotis. After taking a ridiculously long time in getting the order, we were told that the repeat order for rotis would take at least 20-30 minutes. We were furious, but asked for Jeera Rice instead which they blatantly refused. We had to make do with rice (which was cold, and clearly precooked). No courtesy, or whatsoever from the staff or management at all. Good luck being in the hospitality business of you wish to operate this way, folks.

I think it was around 2002/3 that Bhojohori Manna started as a small outlet in mandeville gardens and became a rage selling Bengali food to Bengalis in Kolkata and also some non Bengalis as well.It was unique because till then no one guessed that a market like this exists.But probably with the concept of working couples and detached homes,the kitchen till then ably served by the Mothers and Grandmas were feeling their absence.Kasturi is a long line of restaurants in that chain and have made a pretty decent name themselves.
Kachu para Chingri bhapa is the killer item here.It was very good.A decent kasha mangsho,dal,a good mutton kosha,mediocre Chingri malaikari made our meal.Flashes of brilliance marred by pedestrian quality in between and lacklustre service makes up our experience.They can be better.....much better.

Ambience/ Service : Both ambience and service are average. But the food more than makes up for the lack of it.

What to Order: 'Chingri diye Kochu Shaag'
My great grandmother from the maternal side belonged to Bangladesh. They said when she cooked all the houses in the neighbourhood would know what's cooking due to the strong aroma. Kasturi food has a similar appeal. The truly authentic Bangladeshi cuisine.
They serve some quintessential 'Bangal' dishes in all its originality - such as the 'kochur shaag' and 'maachher paturi'. The traditional method is used to prepare the same being true to the spices and flavours. But my favourite out here is the 'bowl of ghee' kept in the centre of the table which takes the taste of the food to the next level.
If you wanna taste Dhaka or Sylhet in your mouth, this is the place to go.

I think it was around 2002/3 that Bhojohori Manna started as a small outlet in mandeville gardens and became a rage selling Bengali food to Bengalis in Kolkata and also some non Bengalis as well.It was unique because till then no one guessed that a market like this exists.But probably with the concept of working couples and detached homes,the kitchen till then ably served by the Mothers and Grandmas were feeling their absence.Kasturi is a long line of restaurants in that chain and have made a pretty decent name themselves.
Kachu para Chingri bhapa is the killer item here.It was very good.A decent kasha mangsho,dal,a good mutton kosha,mediocre Chingri malaikari made our meal.Flashes of brilliance marred by pedestrian quality in between and lacklustre service makes up our experience.They can be better.....much better.

Chicken batta and rice!!! I go there again and again for that combination!!! There is a range of Bengali mouthwatering cuisines to choose from. The food is really splendid. The ambience and service is not great. But given the reasonable rates, the food more than makes up for everything else. A definite visit to savour the authentic Bengali dishes.

Quite a good place for Bengali cuisines. They are really prompt at service and the food quality is good. The spices which they uses are really good and well balanced. Fish iis really good here though found a bit excessive mustard in few preparations. Over all a very good place.

Expenditure: 500 for 2 people

Ambience/ Service : Both ambience and service are average. But the food more than makes up for the lack of it.

What to Order: 'Chingri diye Kochu Shaag'
My great grandmother from the maternal side belonged to Bangladesh. They said when she cooked all the houses in the neighbourhood would know what's cooking due to the strong aroma. Kasturi food has a similar appeal. The truly authentic Bangladeshi cuisine.
They serve some quintessential 'Bangal' dishes in all its originality - such as the 'kochur shaag' and 'maachher paturi'. The traditional method is used to prepare the same being true to the spices and flavours. But my favourite out here is the 'bowl of ghee' kept in the centre of the table which takes the taste of the food to the next level.
If you wanna taste Dhaka or Sylhet in your mouth, this is the place to go.

I have been to park street area kasturi for several times so I had a plan to visit the ballygunge one ..and I failed to remember the day I visited this one..but here is my review...
Ambience: small,simple a bit stuffy though and it seriously need to renovate its washroom.
Reception and service: just thikthak
Price: reasonable
Food: this one is having an ala carte menu not like the park street one and its also not failed to deliver that dhakai delicacy...but its not at par with its park street counterpart.
Recommended.

Though the food has dropped a bit since it started, this place still has what it takes. Wouldn't recommend the new outlet in Dover Lane. Try the one in Ballygunge Place. 

Seating, again, is not inspiring. Often, one has to wait.

A full course meal works for me. Kochu Saag with Chingri, Moog dal, Jhuri bhaja, Ilish or Aar maachh, chutney.

It would be not right to give them more than 3 because the food is kind of okay type. I ordered a sorshe pomphret. The curry tasted good but the curry had the smell of Hilsa in it, the same was mild but it had. It seemed that the same curry is being used for a number of preparation s after certain modifications and the bhetki paturi was also not that great.

A non-vegetarian's delight! The Kosha Mangsho and Chicken Bhaja are a must have! Don't go in expecting a swank restaurant. It's nothing close to that. However it is not too run down either. Its similar to a basic Iranian joint with an AC and some thought given to decor when it was first built.

Service is quite quick and the staff is courteous enough. They even do home deliveries, but only if they are in the mood for it so don't count on their delivery service.

The food however is quite good and I hear that it is one of the few places in Kolkata which still serves authentic bengali cuisine which is not only delicious but also very reasonably priced.

I with my family visited here again. We took sorshe ilish, kochu Pata diye chingri, basanti polao, muttin dakbunglow, aam doi. Basanti pulao and kochu Pata chngri and sorshe ilish were fav.loved till last bite. Ilish was soft and really good. But m disappointed with mutton dakbunglow. Even the peices were not good. Chewy peices. Aam doi was good. Could have been better..Iiked the place
______________________________________________

I was here around 6 mnths ago.it was my fault that i wrote the review for a different kasturi restaurant. so posting it here now...my riview then was as follows :. 
For many days i wanted i come here. we were the 1st to enter for lunch. nice ambience. without wasting time we directly ordered steamed rice, basanti pulao, kochupata chingri bhapa, hilsa sorse, mutton dakbunglow and aam porar sorbot. aam porar shorbot was delivered 1st in 2-3 minutes. it was good. nothing xtra ordinary. I heard that kochupata chingri bhapa was a must try dish for this place but it disappointed me coz i think the sorshe part was more than it should have been. the smell of shorshe and 'shorshe tel' was 2 much. shorshe in that dish is must but not that much!! hilsa was nice. the peices were really good along with the gravy!! mutton dakbunglow and basanti pulao was really good.i mean mutton dak bunglow was different in taste from the other mutton dakbunlow i had from different restuarant and amazingly it was really good. i liked it.

I should mention one thing that the plate was so light dat it was countinously moving while i was eating. i was too irritating.total the bill was Rs. 932/-. A slight expensive according to the taste. but can try...:)

pictures are not good coz taken on mobile..:(

Had heard about this place a decade ago and this time during my visit to Kolkata thought of trying at this so called authentic " bangladeshi " food joint .

Firstly the place is quite cramped with shoddy seating arrangement but then I assume most of the ethnic bengali restaurants are similar in ambience.

We ordered for fish batter fry and prawn fry as starters . The former was ok but the later one was extreme dry .

In the main course we ordered for bhapa ilish ( good ) , chitol peti ( bad taste of gravy ) , bhetki paturi ( very dry and should be avoided ) , kochu chingri ( ok sort but very less in quantity ) , basanti polao ( was ok ) . 

We also wanted to experiment with shutki loita and it tastes bitter .

Overall overhyped , over rated just ordinary food . Not recommended .

This small pure Bengali restaurant is located very near Patha Bhaban School in Ballygunj. Nice ambience. They have a long menu of Bengali cuisine specially from Bangladesh. We ordered steamed rice, aloo bhaja (thin slices of potato deep fried), bhetki patururi, pomfret in sorshe (mustard), moong daal and Dhakai bhuna chicken. Nice well cooked rice was served. The dao was very well cooked. They give two fillets in the paturi (mustard and Poppy seed paste marinated and steamed in banana leaf) which was well cooked but was a little less spicy. The pomfret was cooked with mustard paste but it smelled of hilsa. I think they used the hilsa gravy. The chicken is the typical kosha chicken cooked bangal kitchen. Overall the experience was good and its pocket-friendly as well.

I would like to say that anyone who like to taste Bengali Food with Bangledeshi taste then must visit this outlet. Dhakai taste does not disappoint you.

Kasturi vs bhojhori manna

I had always wanted to try the dhakia food..and tons of people told me that Wht kasturi is famous for.. but I would like to differ here..

Their menu is 90% same.. The 10% which is different..don't get excited..is the difference in price.. kasturi is a more economical option.. They have the same I repeat exact same dishes... so now any one would argue why go to bhojhori manna..

I would still choose bhojhori manna over kasturi...For the food quality and taste is much better and service wise far more superior.. They r a busy restaurant and still the food is too die for.. 

This review is based on my usual order of bhetki steamed..wrapped in a banana leaf.. pabda sorshe...and chingri maach..

If u r a visitor. .to kolkata..and u hv a crunch of time.. kindly dedicate that time to bhojhori manna.

Ok so Kasturi restaurant is one of the place to have authentic Dhakai Bangla cuisines. A year ago on saptami we went there for food. Located near Ballygunge place, this is a small outlet with small sitting arrangements. Coming to decor and Ambience plz don't expect any flamboyance of any Bengali theme. Though I know Dhakai dish is not at all like Bengali dish. The former is much more spicy and cooked with not so much milk or creamy diary products. Anyways to talk about food we ordered kochupatta chingri bhappa is one of the food which I liked there and Basanti pulao which has neither any fragrance nor taste. Even the Dak banglow mutton was chewy, hard not well cooked. Though the prawn malaicurry was sweet spicy and was good.

Visited on Sunday the 1st March 2015. Found it to be highly disorganised. We were 6 and were informed that we will have to wait for 30 minutes. However, to our horror we found that one after the other, the groups that came after us were ushered in and we were left standing. Protested to the manager but were informed that we would have to wait till a table for six fell vacant. Our suggestion to rearrange seating by joining two tables fell on deaf year. The staff were absolutely unhelpful. The food was completely mediocre. Chingrir malaikari which is a Bengali household dish was so much overdone with coconut and sweetened that it tasted like "narkoler naru". The other dishes like postor bada, chitol maacher muitha, aloo posto etc were equally uninspiring. I would rather give this place a miss and instead walk a few yards and dine at the 6 Ballygunge Place where the food is superb and the waiters are extremely courteous.

When Anirban suggested that we must visit Kasturi for a Sunday lunch , I was elated. Kasturi reminded me of a restaurant where waiters will cost me display wide range of fish delicacies on a tray and you can actually see the dish and select. Yes, that's my college days memories of Kasturi near free school street. But that's long back and lots of water had flown below Howrah bridge after that. Kasturi now has a branch in Ballygunje which is air conditioned. But the best part is that food remained same. So is the wash basin area. We had sukto, kachki jhaal, kachu pata bata chingri, mutton, chingri bhape and aar mach. All the items were really really tasty. All the items tasted so much like home made ( rather grand ma made ). The bill was very reasonable. I will definitely give it a revisit soon.

Went to this place for lunch today. Have seen this place before but never ventured as am very sceptical about having Bengali food at a restaurant. For me maa's kitchen is still the best when it comes to bengali cooking.

So the ambiance;  its okay. Staff could be a bit more courteous and the wash basin area could definitely be more dry and clean.(thats why not a 4.5 or more)

The place is really small and might have to wait for some time. It is better to have a reservation beforehand if they permit.

But the food was a total surprise for me. We ordered rice, aloo jhuri bhaja (crispy fried grated potatoes), daal, chicken bata(minced chicken), kochu pata (Yam leaf) chingree (prawn) shape (a special way of cooking by steam) and mutton Dak Bunglow. Each dish was a wonder. The chicken was tender and well done. The Mutton was soft and really nice to taste. Goes very well with white rice. But the real winner was the chingree-- kochu Pata Chingreer bhape; its a must try and is highly recommended. The portions are decent enough for two. The costs are also very reasonable. Was very hungry from the long wait and the food was so good that forgot to take any pics. So now i do have another excuse to visit the place.

All in all a really nice place for authentic Bengali food. Planning to take my Maa next time.

This is my favourite Bengali outlet. Simple seating, this joint is run by Bangladeshis, whose parent outlet is in Free School Street. You'd get the best Ilish, Paabdas and Chitols here. But the signature dish that sets this restaurant stand out is the Kochupata Chingri. Seasoned with some shorshe (poppy), this one's a winner that acts as an USP of this restaurant. Do not miss this dish if you are there.

Kasturi chefs' dishes will surely take second place after my "maa er haath er ranna" ! Authentic dishes to start with..and then the specialities according to your preferences ! But I could have completed my entire lunch only with sukto nd daal !
We ordered so many dishes and all were up to the mark. But the mention worthy dishes were chicken bata and kachu pata bata chingri !! If you step into that restaurant u just have to order these two dishes..

If you have an appetite for a gastronomical authentic Bengali/Dhakai cuisine , then you are in for a treat at this joint. Reasonable priced and simple set up, the food is just too good and awesomely delicious. The portions of fish and meat are very very generous and value for money. My all time favourite is the KochuChingri Bhapa...which is a preparation of Prawns with leafy green vegetables with a hint mustard and it is to die for...there are many more regular dishes which are lipsmacking....this is a must try and it will not dissapoint you...

A good restaurant...albeit small in size...but the food quality is awesome.

We visited this place last week,had to wait around 25 mins on a saturday afternoon before we were allowed by the gatekeeper to enter and occupy a table. I am an avid zomato follower, and most of the bottom reviews have suggested the kocupata chingri bhapa as a must-have, so I ordered the same with bhetki paturi. Both dishes scored upto the expectation.
We had basanti pulao, chital muitha and mutton dakbunglow as main course. I am quite disappointed over the mutton dish, although the fish and the rice item were splendid. Not too many desserts are available, and turned down by the waiter when ordered rashmalai from the menu, so took chushi payes which was also good.

A nice place to hang out with your parents.

I'm a bit of a Kewpie's loyalist when it come to Bengali food, since I have been going there for years, but Kasturi pleasantly surprised me. Dropped in here for lunch, and a delicious meal of Bhetki Paturi, poshto bora and fish fry followed by dal and rice (obviously) saw me very content! A big thumbs up!

I have been to Kasturi couple of times and love their signature dish, "Kachupata Chingri Bhapa" and "Bhetki Paturi" along with Steamed rice. 

Last time we ordered for Aampora sharbot, Rice, Dal, Alubhaja, Topse Fry, Pomfret Fry, Bhetki Paturi, Mutton Dakbunglow and Misti Doi. 

Aampora sharbot was tasty but not great. Loved the dal & Alubhaja (usual) but the Bhetki paturi and Kachupata Chigri Bhapa are a great hit. I can go there time and again for these two items. The Bhetki Paturi can be eaten as a starter as well as a side dish along with steamed rice. The spice is just appropriate and the gravy is perfect. Kasturi is known for great fish items and you can try any one without fear. I am sure they will win your heart (read mouth).

Pomfret Fry was good with rice and dal or just with little mastard sauce. 

Mutton Dakbunglow is superb! They have used egg fritters which has made this dish even more tastier. 

Misti doi is a disappointment. It's good but not as expected. They should make it better to match the other items. I have given this feedback to the manager and he told me that he will convey my message to the owner. 

Kasturi will always be my favourite and I would love to go back there several times.

The Bhettki Paturi was a bit charred so didn't get that paturi feel. But overall food quality is fantastic . Great place for cheap bengali food. Will love to visit here again and again -

An authentic Dhakai bengali cuisine restaurant, the food is typical Bengal served on a plate, located near the south calcutta law college.

 we went for luch and ordered" basanti pulao, sheel e batta chicken, mutton kosha, prawn malai curry, there were a lot of mosquitoes mind you. Food was good  , pulao was nice flavorful , malaicurry was a nice change from the everyday Chinese  , sheel e batta chicken was a treat , mixing it with the rice and it was amazing, the mutton kosha was a ta spicy to my liking , i was huffing and puffing at the end but it was worth it.  price for 2 came ta 650, so a bit pricey, but once in a while its a pleasant change for your palate.

First I would like to confess I am a Bangaal and we love food. If you know a Bangal and ever got a chance to eat with them, you will know the taste buds they possess. This is one restaurant where I love to eat whenever I feel like having bengali dishes. To describe, we had a Hilsa piece which was at least of 6 inches and a Pabda whose tail and head was hanging outside from the container it was served. I loved the Chicken Batta and it was awesome when eaten with plain rice.

In simple words, it will leave a swelling on you buds for a next time....

Ballygunge’s Kasturi restaurant always stands for its quality and excellence. The food is simply delicious and also the ambience of the restaurant is something unrivaled. If you are about to forget your Grandma’s delicacies due to your day to day’s hustle bustle, then think again, the place offers dishes which are famous traditional Bengali food items. I often go to this place to devour their mouth watering items. Last time when I was there, I ordered Basanti pulao and chollar dal. The combination was perfect. Among bhaja/bhuji, I took prawn pakora. The crunchy texture of the pakora was sublime. The next item I loved to order was kachupatta chingri bhapa. I love sukto so my next item was sukto. The tasty sukto was simply yummy as all the veggies and gravy mixed well with each other. The restaurant has an irresistible collection of fish items. Next I ordered doi hilsa, one of the popular Bengali dishes. With that I had jumbo prawn malaicurry. Lastly I finished with Aam pora shorbot.

Only a Bangal will know what Bangal means. My friend is a Bangal and she took me to Kasturi last year. I loved their food so much that I try and visit them once every two months. The cuisine is spicier than the food of West Bengal. Kasturi serves Dhaka cuisine so it is called Dhakai cuisine.

Kasturi is very special to me as they have chosen some of the most humble dishes and elevated them to an exalted level. For example, the Taro leaf green vegetable is merged with tiny bits of shrimps and cooked in a pungent mustardy preparation for which I will return to Kasturi again and again. The Bhetki paturi is out of the world. Thick slices of the fish are layered with mustard paste and wrapped in banana leaf and steamed. Both these dishes are best enjoyed with white rice. 

Being their regular customer, I have noticed something that their fish fries used to be thick and the crumb layer thin but of late the fish slice is getting thinner too. Not much impressed with their Posto (Poppy seed) bora. Tasty enough but I've had better.

The Taro green with shrimps (Kochu pata chingri bhapay) is their signature dish. Ambience is homely. The staffs are polite and helpful. The place is a great value for money.

After many days of planing and my interest to visit this place, it finally happened yesterday n thank god that it did happen. OK the location of the place is very easy to find. Take the right turn from ballygaunge ITI stop and keep driving straight for 2-3mins you will see it on the right hand side by another restaurant named fishfish.
Coming to the decor of the place. Pls its a place of eats not decoration and they rightly avoided it and concentrated on the food. Coming to the food:
We are a family of seven people. All bangals who have long forgotten to treat their bangal taste buds to coronary clogging bangal delicacies. Anyways, We ordered moong daal, posto bora,alu bhaja , kachu pata chingri, chittol muithya, papda sorshe, bhetki paturi,mutton dak bunglow, ilish bhape n rice. The taste of the food was yummmmm. I dont think I've enough vocabulary to describe the delicately fried posto bora, the exactly heart blocking or mouth watering amount of oil, spice n sorshe, posto in the kachu pata chingri or the delicately prepared juicy soft chittol muithya or the oil laden thick curry of the mutton dakbunglow n the soft meaty pieces of the mutton. Only I felt that the ilish Mach bhape was less spicy n more on the sweeter side. In one word, if u wanna treat ur taste buds to the flavour of Dhaka or the bangal way of cooking pls come here. To me after this place, bhojohori n 6th ballygaunge will feel like veg.

Ps : if you are health conscious please spare this place. Remember of all the bangal way of cooking food Dhakai method is thought to be healthy as they take less oil n spice!! But its waaaayyy more than we take in our daily food.
Price wise, all of that n some dessert cost us 3k. So it's damn cheap.


UPDATE:

Visited this place just today!! Nothing new to review...same great taste, same greasy food and the perfect satisfying burp after the food. Some photos to add.

There are days when you wish for an invitation to a wedding function. Not because you like to dress up but to fulfil your cravings for sumptuous bengali food.

So it was my turn, and I was having an overwhelming craving for a full course bengali meal. Though not being from a bengali family has little effect on my taste buds. When it comes to food, I can be the best bengali ever.

After reaching Bhojohori Manna at the wrong time we were told to wait two hours. Suddenly I noticed Kasturi next door and we went in. Ordering just took 30 seconds, I was so proud of my friends. The pulao the begun bhaja were heavenly. And so was the mutton dak banglow. And the rest I ate up so fast that I forgot to take snaps.

After the lunch we all had a big smile plastered on our faces for the next two days.

Go visit.

Food: Awsummm bengali food!! Elish vapa, chital peti, vetki paturi all are quite yummy if u want to try fish dish. Kochupata chingri vapa special mention  in non-veg side dishes. Mutton Kosha was average today. Little bit stiff and cold also. Overall, Went 3 times, experience were really quite good with the food every time.

Service: Good but can be a little better. Had to call 2-3 times to get attention of waiter. Anyway behavior was decent also. A little late to serve the food but since they are serving high quality food so not a big deal(at least for me).

Ambience & space: Space is ok in normal day. Ambience is also ok overall. Not any special bangaliana style inside the restora but dat doesn't matter hugely.

Price: I think lowest among the renowned kolkata restaurants which serve bengali food. I went bhajohari sholoana koshe kosha etc. Cheaper dan all. And comparing the food:price for the big bengali restaurants in kolkata, its my No. 1.

Conclude the review by suggesting people to must go for it if they want good bangali food.

Kasturi has become one of my favourite resturants in Kolkata recently. Being a Bengali myself, I cherish all the Indian (Bengali) specialised dishes served here. The best part this restaurant is that, it does not have any menu card rather the items are displayed live to the customers and accordingly the customers place the orders. Quick service, mouth watering taste with added flavour of pure Kolkata, makes Kasturi - a all rounder. Price of each item is quite reasonable which makes it pocket friendly also. Starting from the starters like shukto to the main course items and at the end, payesh allows one to full his stomach completely.

Preparations are horrible ... very hot, indiscriminately. I along with my family visited Kasturi - Ballygunge on 20th Oct'14. We ordered 6 courses (Dal, Postobora, Mixed Veg, Pabda jhol, Bhetki bhapa and Chicken curry) and found out that 5 out of 6 were extremely hot, to the extent that we could not finish our lunch and had to make do with one item only.
None of us will ever recommend Kasturi to anybody.

Among all the kochupata diye chingri deserves a round of applause...i've never had anything like ths before....it was delicious...none of the other items are worth mentioning...they were just okay...i did not like the quality of the rice served & the bhetki'r paaturi had an excessive amount of dried chilly powder added to it...the pineapple chutney was fine but the chushir payesh didnt meet expectations.

We had kochupatta chigri bhappa, basanti polau and rui kalia. I am not a big fan of bengali cusine but i loved every dish i had here except the rui kalia. The fish it seemed had been kept pre cooked .... and thus it was cold on the inside even though the curry it was served in was piping hot !!!

Also the behaviour of the staff was indifferent if not rude.

On a Thursday afternoon made a sudden plan to eat outside and remembered Kasturi which is just a stone throw away from my place but never tried food there!! 

Since the group had aged members of family whose roots are from Bangladesh so can't be the better option than Kasturi who are known for their authentic Dhakai cuisine. Also to make the occasion more special to try cuisine of where I belong on the occasion of World Food Day.

For those who are not aware Dhakai cuisine is from the country Bangladesh.  Though great deal of commonality in spicing and technique between Bengali and Dhakai cuisine however later cuisine uses much more coconut milk, dried fish, less spices, less dairy and milk products.

On a working day afternoon when near by schools were closed due to pujo holiday still had to wait for 30 mins to get a table for 4 pax. Place is very small too.

We ordered Basanti Pulao, Kochupatta Chingri Bhappa, Prawn Malaicurry and Mutton Dak Banglow.

Basanti Pulao makes amazing combo with all these dishes. Pulao itself was so tasty and fragrant I was having this only without any side dish.

Kochupatta Chingri Bhappa tasted like heaven. Prawn Malaicurry was smooth sweet and spicy gravy while Mutton Dak Banglow was mildly spicy yet rich. Each and every item tasted uniquely different.In sweet dish we ordered for classical Rasmalai and Choshi r Payesh. Rasmalai is common in any sweet shop and tasted familiar however Choshi r Payesh was like icing on the cake. Can't be better ending than this after having such sumptuous dishes. 

Coming to decor and ambiance please don't expect neither any flamboyance or Bengali themed decoration. 

As part of scope of improvement I found the servers are very lazy, lacks communication skill and there are no supervisors present to manage these fellows. Price was reasonable but hold on they compensate that with lesser quantity per portion. Apart from these I will highly recommend this establish to all gastronomically enthusiastic people. 

Ooh yes, the most important thing, bill for 4 adults came INR 1015 with tax.

After two visits at the restaurant and trying out quite a few dishes, I can safely say that this place will not disappoint even the pickiest of Bangals. The restaurant is located just beside Fish Fish on Anil Moitro (Road (Swinhoe Street to oldies), in the vicinity of Patha Bhavan school, so its quite easy to locate.

The decor is plain and I kind of wished it had some hint of 'Bangaliana' in it. But anyway, I don't particularly care for pretentious interior design as long as the food, the real hero, of any eatery is top notch.

In both the visits, we ordered Basanti Pulao. It was gorgeous; I know some would say it was too slick, but I am a stickler of the notion that no Bengali worth his salt would ever complain about 'too much ghee'. The cashews and plump raisins were plentiful in the pulao. They seemed a little inconsistent on the portions though. It was always a generous portion, but on both count, there was more pulao in one plate than the other.

We ordered Kochupatay Chingri Bhapa, and it is no exaggeration when I say your meal at this restaurant is never complete without this dish. It is a bowlful of shrimps steamed in kochupata and a strong mustard gravy. It is simply too delicious to the average mustard loving Bengali tongue.

On our first try, we had ordered the Dhoka. Two big diamonds of dhoka and two pieces of potato floating in a mild, almost sweet gravy. with a distinct touch of asafoetida. It tasted of home, truly.

We also got the Chicken batta. To be frank, it tasted like chicken curry in an almost mousse-like form. Texture-wise, it was quite innovative but the taste, although good, was not as special as many told me.

On the second visit, we got ourselves a bowl of Chitol Machher Muittha. Kasturi does justice to this iconic Bangal dish. The Muittha or the koftas themselves were a bit tougher than what I have (and 'what I have' means the soft yet meaty muithha my Dida used to make), but nonetheless, it is certainly going to sate the tastebuds of veteran Muittha eaters. The rich, spicy and aromatic gravy made the dish even more delicious.

We had also ordered a Chicken Dakbungalow. The gravy was tasty very dry and there were three medium sized pieces of chicken in it. However, the chicken pieces were either bony or tough. I didn't like this dish much. In fact, from next time onwards, I would stick to the variety of veg and fish dishes.

Overall, comparing the price with quality and quantity of food, it is evident that Kasturi is one of the most affordable restaurants in Kolkata.

If you want the mixture of Deliciousness,traditional,not expensive  & pure Dhakai cuisine check this one. My partner and I had visited this place on the eve of Ashtami,2014. For Puja purpose the restaurant  opened at 7:30pm.
1. Location : Just beside Ballygunge Durgabari and Fish-Fish near ekdalia & station.
 2.Ambience: Pretty simple, just a few posters &collage  of different Kolkata muhurtos(moments).
3. Food : They had made a smaller version of the regular menu to tackle the pressure of puja crowd. Anyways we'd ordered recommended  Kachu pata Chingri vape,Mutton Dakbunglow,shona mug dal with gobi,chittol muitha and 2 bowl of rice though 2 bowl of rice is enough  for 3 person s but that time they 'd withdrawn  the plate option.
a) quantity and quality : the sife dishes are sufficient for 2-3 people based on your appetite. Both mutton and chittol dishes contain 3 pieces.
Now the daal was good enough  for me . Kachu pata chingri and Mutton dakbunglow was beyond appreciation,they were just the detonations of extreme deliciousness. Chittol kofta/muitha didn't impress me very much.
b) price: much lower compare to other restaurants. Don't. Know whether they 'd hiked the price little bit coz the cost of the dishes didn't match with that was given in Zomato. 
4. Waiter behaviour  : particularly I didn't like our one,he was over smart,not attentive and kind of pusher!!!
    But overall I liked this restaurant  very much,would like to visit their other branches soon.

Called for delivery and they did it in time. The team lunch for puja celebrated with Basanti Polao, Peas Polao, Veg Polao with Fish Fry , Posto Bora, Mutton Dakbanglow, Chiken Dhakai Roast, Chicken Korma and Kochu Patta Paneer Vapa.
Starting with the Fish Fry, its totally waste, no salt in it and the fish inside was also not good, though the Posto Bora tastes nice. 

Mutton Dakbanglow was really nice , much different than other Dakbanglow that I had in other Bengali Restaurants. Chiken Dhakai Roast, Chicken Korma tasted awesome, very spicy and the quantity was enough to feed two. Kochu Patta Paneer Vapa tasted decent to me, its full of mustard blend which I didnt think goes with Paneer, though overall taste is good.

Coming to Polaos , I find it too oily and full of ghee. Though they tasted very nice at the begining, but we could not have much because of the excess ghee and the quantity also very much for one.

Over all for bengali cuisine lovers its a must try for reasonable pocket pinch .

We ordered mutton kosha-okay..chitol macher muittha-it was okay.prawn dhakai bhuna-the prawns had a stale smell..and not at all tasty..dont even think of trying it..the shile bata chicken was good..
The signature kochupata bhapa chingri was not available..there was some big order and it was all used up..the basanti polao was nothing but ordinary..pineapple chutney all too mundane to tingle the tastebuds..
Only pro i can think is the price which is on the lower side but is only justifiable coz the food is on the lower side too..the waiters forget your order..u have to remind them..this too when we were the only customers in the entire restaurant! -we went on a rainy saturday night..some people who had come to avail of their take away got frustated too while having to wait too long..after finishing out food we got to know that the fridge wasnt working!!!!goodness knows what we had.and there is no parking space..
Overall i wont go back there in the near future..maybe someday to try their "kochupata" thingy...and yes you can give it a miss..

One of the better restaurants for Bengali and Bangladeshi cuisine, the food is delicious and yet not too heavy or oily. One MUST try the 'Kochu patai bhapa chingri' (prawns steamed in a mustard gravy in yam leaves). It's their best dish and sets the bar very high.

If You are a Bong + Bangal + Foodie then Kasturi is THE food destination stop for you.specially probashi bong like me  .. Kachupata Bata with chingdi Bhapa, Lotye Shutki bata & Chitol macher Muitha I;ve tried on the first day & very next day again I went & tasted Illish bhapa, Lau chingdi & mug dal with gobhi & posto bora .... Its difficult to explain which one is better than the others .... Still undoubtedly Kochu pata prawan bhapa, Shutki , Lau Chingdi & Illish Bhapa was out of the world. Ambiance + service is the last thing you will observe here .. last but not the least sweet dish ... Choshi r Payesh .. must try ... I wish they have branches in Bangalore . Bombay & Delhi so we can have more n more authentic Bangal Food ( Dhakai Food )

One of the best meals I've had.

One has to wait in line on Holidays, but the food is worth the wait. And the cost is pocket-friendly. We were 3 heads; had 2 bowls steamed rice, 1 plate Sorse-Ilish, 1 plate Pabda Sorse Jhal, 1 plate Jumbo Chingri Malaicurry & 1 bowl Aalu Posto, all for Rs1,111/-.



Though, they can have a better washroom and their dishwashing area can be more discreet, one can have a glance at it while visiting the washroom.

A nice bengali restaurant. If you know bengali cuisines well, you shall fit in there. I found that there are dishes beter the Hilsa. I loved the dish 'kachu chingri'. The quality was just fine, I believe that is because the chefs were really good. I hated the ambiance, the structure and the service. They need to move into a better place.

Finally visited Kasturi on 31st July.

We had steamed rice, topshe fry,dhokar dalna,kochupata chingri bhapa,bhetki paturi,chicken dhakai bhuna,

aamer chatni

The kochupata chingri bhapa seems to be their speciality and trust me...it was mindblowing

Dhokar dalna was also very soft, succulent and tasty

Bhetki paturi was not exceptional..though definitely good.

what dissappointed me was chicken dhakai bhuna....the name sounded exotic. It was just regular 'robibarer mangshor jhol' at most Kolkata homes.

overall food was good.

service brisk

cleanliness...average

would definitely like to visit again to try the items.

Other dishes are fine, although we only has fish of different types. Anyone who wants to have bengali food in a budget restaurant should visit Kasturi.

Have heard so much about it that I was dying to have a meal sometime. So on a lazy Sunday I could convince my family to grab our lunch there. And we discovered that they were celebrating the Hilsa festival on those weekends and we were even more happy.

Arriving there, I kind of did not like there sitting arrangement, water was dripping from the AC and falling on our seats later on the floor, making the floor wet and dirty. The wash basin area was pathetic, it was watery and unhygienic. Anyways

We ordered *Steamed Rice *Daal *Alu Bhaja *Postor Bora *Kachupata Chingri Bhapa *Dhokar Dalna *Ilish Maach Vapa *Doi Ilish *Shorshe Ilish *Mutton Kosha *Chatni and *Choshir Payesh.
I have heard a lot about their Kachupatar Chingri Bhapa and indeed it exceeded my expectation. But it was rich !
Among the Ilish preparation I completely loved the Ilish Mach Bhapa, the sorshe Ilish was good too. The Doi Ilish had a tangy sweet taste which I did not quite enjoy. An important thing to remember in the fish section is, their menu card shows the picture of the preparations with 2 fishes in a plate, but it actually has only one. Do not expect the men serving you to know much about the dishes, to me they seemed extremely unprofessional and incompetent.
Then came the mutton, and I was completely taken aback, it came in a small bowl which is not enough to feed a single individual. Although I could have guessed this from the price, but still I did not expect this less a quantity.
The rest, Daal, Postor Bora , Alu Vaja, Dhokar Dalna was most ordinary and could be better cooked at home at half the price.
In the Chushir Payesh you have to struggle hard to find the Chushi in the watery payesh. But I would not complain about the taste, it was fairly good.
Overall I would not say I did not like the food and I wanted to rate them more and come back again, but in the evening I had to completely change my mind when I had a stomach ache owing to their extremely rich preparations.
I can only conclude that, with fame comes a great responsibility to hold up that status with dignity and I could see Kasturi Restaurant has failed to do that radically.

This place is only apt for those who have interest in bong food.
Being a bong, I have tasted almost all the home cooked version of the dishes served here. My idea of going here would be on a bangali occasion where I would like my mom to enjoy with me rather than sweating over steaming ilish in the kitchen.
The place is a bit crumpled and theres nothing special about the ambience other than bongs discussing "chingri machher malaikari" & "pasher barir meye tar bie" at the top of their voice.
Coming to the food everything from quality to taste is superb (although mom is the best).
The Bhetki machher paturi, kochupatay chingri, and chushir payesh tops the list.
Overall good place for celebrating jamai shoshti, bhai phota, or oshtomi lunch with sumptuous sholo ana bangali khana where the mom can also sit, relax n enjoy rather than serving everyone.

Kasturi is situated in an alley in Swinhoe street close to both South Point School and Patha Bhavan.As  I was a bit late for lunch, I decided to give them a call on the availability of food. I was pleasantly surprised to note that there was food. I was extremely delighted to note that. The staff was very cordial in letting me know that all items on the menu would not be available as it was a bit too too. They assured me good food but.  I was obviously very late, and quickly followed my BONG instincts to order Bhaat (Steamed Rice) and "Pabda Begun Borir Jhol". The fish was absolutely fresh and cooked to perfection. Although the oil was a bit much on the higher side, but then I could ignore that considering the taste. The ambiance is like any other Bengali Restaurant. Do not expect an Oh! Calcutta. It is simply Bengali dining and not fine dine. Pujus are round the corner...Dont forget to take a bite out here. It is worth it.

We reached this outlet for dinner few days back and decided to order their signature dish, no prizes for guessing this right - yes, the kochupata chingri bhapa. Along with it we ordered for aloo posto and dal along with chicken curry and chutney. The aloo posto was pretty ordinary but it tasted goo with the dal. The chicken was good as well but the star dish was the kochupata chingri bhapa. It oozes with intense taste and flavor. I was once again immensely pleased after having nearly a plateful of rice with this signature dish. Though this place often has long queue of people waiting in front of you but the food often compensates for that wait. Definitely recommended.

My experience (a couple of days at lunch) with this place has been quite descent. The place has a very nice ambiance and good service. Coming to food some real good bong dishes. My most distinct memory of this place is that of the 'Mutton Kasha' though hot, spicy and real great. Exactly the way I like the 'Mutton Kasha' to be. The other dishes that we had ordered were quite average to me. The price is quite reasonable though I will like to complain about the quantity.

Regarding food, i tried rice,sukto, dal, alubhaja, kochupata chingri bhapa, hilsha bhapa, bhetki bhapa, hilsha sorshe, chicken dakbanglow... all the items were very good. for bhapa, they use their own prepared mustard. And kochupata chingri is their signature dish, a must try one. The only problem i felt was its location in ballygung place. i had to try hard to locate it on the first day. else it's really tough to find such delicious bengali food in such price...

Kasturi Restaurant located near Ballygunge Phari is a good budget bengali restaurant offering an array of dishes at reasonable prices considering Bengali food is actually costly in Kolkata. Ambience is pleasant, mostly for family eat outs. Service is good and quick. Food can sometimes be too oily. The chicken dhakai with steamed rice is a must have. Their famous 'Chingri Bhapa' which is made of small prawns was a disappointment though. This place is a must if you want to try Bengali cuisine at nominal costs.

The feeling I got is worst, firstly there was no one to attend in the gate, after that one security came out with dirty cloths.
No seating arrangements full mess. The management expect to put the price like good restaurant but its mainly has become a take away counter. Very bad feeling.

The only thing I have trouble with is all their dishes are too hot even papda macher pabda macher patla jhol. But it's sooo yum that u can't quit on it but get an extra glass of water ! Overall I love Kasturi !

I have gone there twice and experience has been decent.  They serve authentic "bangal" (from Dhaka Bangladesh) cuisine, so the oil and chilly powder are more than needed. 

Have eaten mutton dak banglo, alu posto and daal. Even the dal was HOT, and they must have used chilly powder there as well. Kochu bata die chicngri is pretty decent, and lot of people eat that. 

Overall, a OK place, just that amount of chilly powder is way too much than my liking.

I hate going out for having bengali food. But this is the place that can never say "no" to . It's pocket-friendly and the service is great.some of the best dishes available there are dhokar dalna,kaski macher chorchori,alu-fulkopir torkari and mutton kosha. The most recommended dish is the kochupataye mora chingri and it's delicious.

i never dined there but had foods packed away from it couple of times. also, we asked them to do catering for us on the 5th birthday celebration of our son. so, i have good fair idea about the quality of food on offer, but have no idea on the service at the restaurant.
coming to food items, they use good basmati rice. dal, alu bhaja, posto bora were all typically good, nothing to complain about. one must try the lotte batta which is very unique preparation and very tasty (a bit hot). also kochu pata chingri bhapa si another item one must try out. apart from these, the general items like mutton dak bungalow, chittal muittha, doi ilish were all tasty but very spicy and oily. they use too much oil on almost all the items which i didn't like.

omggg ever since we started eating out here we have not been able to stopp...me, my bf, my whole family including my 80 yr old granny who is a *bangal* and hence very fussy about fish dishes like *miuthha* and *kochu bata bhapa chingri*  but this poila boisakh she was floored :D we keep ordering the basanti pulao, the kochu bhapa chingri and the chicken bata <3 if i had to steal 1 dish from the menu for my daily delight, it would be their oh so hyped kochu bhapa chingri..just mwahh!! the mustard zing, the gravy consistency and the quantity with the price almost makes me cry with happiness! the interiors are a bit cramped but really clean and the servers though a tad disorganized are quick and yeahh rarely my bill has reached 500 even after pigging out on 4-5 dishes! i lovveee this place and so happy they are properly kicking the butts of overpriced overrated places serving bengali cuisine like 6 bally place or bhojohori manna *i was a fan perviously* thumbs up :)

But yes stuff that I remember is the taste.. Surely serves one of the best bong food ! 
Had to wait for an hour to get to this place .. It was jam packed , but the food was worth the wait ! 
The daal , maach , Mangsho and also the bhaja ! 
I vaguely remember but the sarson prawn was amazing ! *_*

Went to Kasturi last week with my family. We ordered the following items-
1)fish fry-  quality of fish was good, the coating was just perfect ( a very difficult art to master)
2) fish butter fry - it was  kind of ok!
3)kochu pata bhapa chingri- THE  DISH - well spicy and oily ,  you can just finish your bowl of rice just with it.  One plate can be shared between two. Hated kochubata all  my life but this time somehow i became a fan
4) chitol macher muithya -  excellent in taste and they make it just like my grandmother made it
5) dal , lau chingri- nothing special about them
6) mutton dakbunglow- spicy and dry mutton curry  
7) golda chingrir malaikari-  I was taken aback  by the price and the burst of flavours that this dish  contained. I bet nowhere in kolkata serves 2 golda chingris at this price.
 overall paisa wasool place, some dishes are  mindblowing, some pretty ordinary
Am i going back there? - yes ,  only for the kochupata chingri and golda chingrir malaikari and if i want  a feel of home cooked food,  nothing fancy, in a decent ambience.
here are some pics, sorry for the quality though

Heard about Kasturi a lot so i decided to go to there on Bengali new year .First impression was the  dining area was too small to accompany a large crowd so we had to wait in the line for long time. I found out the menu did not have much dishes so I tried to order a boneless chicken but it was not available. We asked for lucchi but as usual it was not available .Even thumbs up was not available.After 10mins i was served my food so the service is excellent.All the food was so spicy that i had to drink 3 glass of water and the food was not special it was something which we eat everyday from ma.Price was normal though quantity was not sufficient.
In my experience i would recommend u to go to some other Bengali cuisine places like 6 ballygaunge place ,oh Calcutta, fish fish etc because these restaurants are lot better than Kasturi .

Located in Ballygunge, Kasturi calls itself an authentic Dhakai Bengali cuisine restaurant. I know it has won many awards and is often featured in several food guides. However I find no reason for them to deserve all this attention.

On my first impression, I went to the restaurant for the first time and was shocked when we saw the size of the restaurant. Space management was very poor and our table was uncomfortably close the counter. And if that's not all, the tables were very dirty and we called the waiter to clean the table.

While placing order, we found that most of the items in the menu were not available so we had to go with their choice. The 'Niramish' (Vegetarian) section of the menu was completely non-existent as they had nothing except Sukto and Dhokar Dalna. They even did not have luchis so we took Peas Pulao.

Out of what we ordered, the food was not at all good. It was very spicy and just below average. Only food item that I can praise of is Bhetki Bhappa, however it was spicy as well.

Price was descent but quantity was not enough. Service is however fast and food is served within 15 minutes of ordering. Ambiance is spoiled as the tables are very close to each other and one can hear talks from the other tables nearby. Decor is descent but of no use due to the small size of the restaurant.

So, overall quite a bad experience and a total disappointment from Kasturi. If you are going to Ballygunge Place for having some Bengali food, I do not recommend Kasturi as of now. There are several other places like Bhojohori Manna, 6 Ballygunge Place etc. which are far better than Kasturi.

On the occasion of bengali new year decided to try out kasturi.Had heard a lot abt this place but when v reached all my hopes vanished...a lonnng que..
Anyways aftr lot of hustling bustling n waiting for,over an hour sat down for lunch.Half the items in the menu weren't available due to the rush so settled for prawn pulao,kochu bhapa chingri, dhokar and chicken dhakai roast.
The prawn pulao was really good,so was the dhokar dalna.Kochu bhapa chingri was really something new but very oily..oil was oozing out.I didn't like the chicken too much as it was very normal..nthng dhakai abt it.
Ended it with amer chatni which was tangy and nice
Good place for a less crowded day so that u can try btr items

Awesome place for authentic bengali food and fish lovers. I have been there number of times . And our all time favourite is Kachupata bata Chngri. Their bhetki paturi and doi ilish is also good. Ask for some nice ghee to go with your Daal . Dont epect a lot. But you will love it . They might not have all the dishes in the menu. So just ask what fishes are available. Go early to avoid standing in queues on weekends.

Should have rated it 4.5  but 1 deducted as the "Aar- macher jhol" they provided was not good, the gravy was smelling bad, but they changed it instantly on complaining and provided extra rice also.
But other food --like ilish vapa, vetki paturi,chitol peti, pabda and the other veg items were really good and cheaper compared to other bengali restaurants.
We have visited this place on Chaitra-sankranti and were very satisfied.

Usually opting for Bengali Cuisines while eating out is not what I recommend, especially when most places really let you down! However I heard many satisfied enthusiastic reviews for Kasturi restaurant, hence was almost compelled to pay a visit.
 Located near the Ballygunge bridge and very easy to find, Kasturi restaurant is almost impossible to miss. However the problem lies in the fact that it is located near two other well-known eating destinations with Bengali cuisines. 
I would suggest when in doubt step into Kasturi, you will not be disappointed. 
The inside is simple, plainly decorated with around four to five tables. The air was tinged with a smell of sarson, which I found a little nose-tickling. 
The menu is simple and easy, not pretentious at all.
We ordered for Steamed rice, Mug dal with peas, Posto Bora, Mocha Chingri Ghonto, Chicken Batta. 
Everything was freshly made, and tasted delicious. I liked the mocha chingri Ghonto best!
However most of the preparations were too much spicy, and by spicy I mean just an overdose of Chilli. I would have preferred a subtle flavor of chilli, especially in the Dal and chicken. Apart from that,the quality as well as quantity of the food  served was very commendable. 
They were out of desserts, which is why we ordered for cold drinks. That too they had to bring from another shop. They went out of their way to get us those cold drinks since we were desperately in need of something sweet after so much chilli!!
The waiters were very friendly and helpful. Service overall was very satisfactory. 
Finally the pricing of the food items were very reasonable. In fact when compared to the quality and quantity it is almost too reasonable. 
Please do visit.
Enjoy.

Our friends had to convince us to try yet another Bengali food joint in Calcutta after we were sorely disappointed with the others, and Kasturi has reinforced our faith in simple Bangali food. It helps that the cooking is predominantly Dhakai, because it helps me reestablish to my Ghoti husband that we Bangals make tastier food :) 
The stand out dish at Kasturi is most certainly the Kochu pata chingri bhapa. It can make even the most ardent kochu hater convert, and every table around us ordered the dish. The chicken and mutton dishes are not exceptional in the sense that most Bengali households can make a similar or even better kosha mutton or chicken. The chholar dal is also quite average and the posto bora wasn't very great either. But the fish items do rock! The Boal maach is huge and amazing, and my guests have called the Pomfret shorshe mindblowing as well. They also make an excellent anarosher chutney and the rasomalai at the end is at just the right temperature, neither too chilled, nor too warm. 
The place is small, and for some reason families speak really loudly here, which, I admit, isn't the management's fault, but it is a bit of a downer. The quality of their food can be judged by how crowded the place is for both lunch and dinner and the huge queue of people waiting outside. The waiters are very polite and make good recommendations. And the pricing is truly unmatched anywhere else in the city. I do wish they added some more Bangali favourites like Chhanar dalna and aamer chutney to the menu though!

I usually don't prefer going out for meals in Bangali restaurants since I eat them all the time at home, specially when guests come over, my mum cooks all the delicacies. But thank god for cousins who stay out of the city and can't have enough of bangali khabar, we all headed to Kasturi day before yesterday post office. I was no where close to getting excited but goodness gracious for my brother's pestering that I went here. My miss would have been a huge loss and my rating says that.  

So a humble steam rice was followed with fish fry. Ask people staying away from this city, they can never forget the fish fry. So this was the most important starter that stood tall in the dinner table along with posto bora. Talking about the fish fry, the batter fried coating was hot and crisp but slightly on the harder side, though the fish was equally hot, very tender and soft and as it melted in your mouth you could taste the spices blend well. 
Posto bora - they were nice and crunchy with poppy seeds sprinkled on top. Since it was served hot we feasted on them with the steaming hot rice. This is what I call the little pleasures of life after a hard day's work.

Kochu pata chingri bhaapa - this is THE dish that clearly stole the show! It is a sin if you go to this place and don't try it. I was very skeptical since I am not a kochu pata lover but I licked my finger till the last end and if that was not good enough, ordered another plate and ate it blissfully ignorant about the fact that I need to share it with others as well. Yes, that is how greedy I had become. I will not talk about dish, let it be the surprise package for you'll. But a word of cautiousness - if you are alergic to shorshe (mustard) then this dish is a no for you. Alas!

Kaski chochorie - this dish caught the fancy of all my cousins but I was way too overwhelmed with the chingri to let the taste of this dish soak in me. But nonetheless, this dish was tasty as well with the right mix of spices cooked to perfection.

Shutki maach - though they don't have the item mentioned in the menu on Zomato but they did have the dish. I as a matter of fact CANNOT stand the taste nor the smell of shutki so they had to wash down the dish immediately it touched our table. So cannot say much about it but the fact that the shutki lovers fell in love with the dish and ordered another plate. While I had to sulk since I had to deal with the smell yet again. Sigh!

Pabda jhal - I am completely in love with pabda jhal and my eyes refuse to wander anywhere else the moment it sets upon this delicate fish. The gravy was rich in spices with the fish entwined gracefully and resting on the rich red gravy. The grated coriander leaves sprinkled on top seems to be caressing the fish while infusing you in its aroma making you slurp all the while. It is a punishment when this fancy is right in front of you but you have to wait for others since their food has not yet arrived (table manners, you know :P). The pabda was mesmerizing and you seem to get lost in its taste and tenderness. This fish is indeed a darling, if pabda was a girl I would have had a girl crush and the guys would be left drooling!

Chittol peti (medium) - not to mention that it was huge, so huge that my sister-in-law had to struggle with this dish. I gave a "helping" hand to her and oh man, how can the guys nail every dish with such perfection?! The fish was juicy and succulent with the spices carefully paving its way inside the fish to give it a rich taste. The gravy was mild on spices but so damn rich in taste. It was a creamy gravy so light that you can wash down an entire plate of rice with just the gravy.

Mutton Dak Bunglow - yet another dish that is not mentioned in the online menu here. This dish has 3-4 chunky pieces of mutton dunked in a rich gravy with grated egg all over it. I am not a lover of solid pieces and prefer the fatty (chorbi) pieces. My not liking solid pieces is because I feel they would be very chewy, yes I m very particular about my red meat cause I love them too much to see it go wrong. But much to my surprise the solid pieces of mutton were so soft that it blew my mind in sheer joy.

Chatni - we orderd the chatni of the day since it is a ritual for my mum to save up some rice to have it with the chatni all the time (yes, we joke about it every time). So mixed chatni it was. Since none of us are chatni lovers we settled for just one plate. Just a spoonful and I was baffled about how can a place amaze you with all their dishes. The mixed chatni was a rich paste of tomato, dry fruits and aam shotto, the tomato seeds were carefully drained out to give it the finesse. Not too sweet to spoil the taste of such a lavish meal, just the right doze of sweetness to play peek-a-boo with your taste buds.

Chosi-er-payesh - by the time we came to our final dessert to end our gastronomic extravaganza, I was speechless and still am. I don't know what chosi is but the payesh had a light brown shade to it hinting at the probability of gur in it. And voila, it was gur and milk mixed in the right amount to give you a killer dessert that would sweep people off their feet specially for those who have a thing for "khawar por ektu mishti hoye jak!"

The final icing on the cake came with the bill, such a king size dinner with a pocket pinch of 1500/, no I am not kidding!
As for the chefs, TOTAL RESPECT! I wish I could steal them away and have them in my kitchen for the rest of my life.

Its really been a while since I penned down my foodbytes. But oh boy! nothing in the world could hold me back after the mouth watering lunch I had from Kasturi. How and why did this gem escape my food radar for such a long time!!

I am a dyed-in-the wool Indian cuisine lover, be it north, south, east, west...Indian! That's me. 

When I called up to inquire about the home delivery areas ( I live nearby, but due to some pressing matters couldn't venture out to have a proper sit down lunch), I knew somehow that this has to be it...my Saturday delight!

What did I order? Eat the following:

1. Posto Bora (Big succulent pieces with generous helpings of mustard...Yummy!!)
2. Alu Bhaja (Not so crispy ...was a let down I tell you)
3. Topshe Fry (3 pcs a plate...Absolutely delicious!)
4. Kochu pata chingri bhapa (No words to describe it...If this is your first time, don't miss it!!) 
5. Papda Jhaal ( This dish will give the biggies a run for their money!) 
6. Chatni 

Whats my verdict: Go for it if you like dhakaai bangla food..the price is absolutely reasonable for the quantity and taste! 

PS: I am ordering chingri bhaapa again tomorrow...because the best way to resist temptation is perhaps....TO YIELD TO IT...)

Indeed a great restaurant. The only problem with this restaurant is that the space is too small and on weekends, you need to wait for almost 30 minutes to get a table. The food here is awesome. Considering the taste and portion quantity, the pricing seems perfect. If you are a group of 2-3 people, you need to literally try very hard to reach a bill of 1000 INR. Overall this is perhaps the best restaurant for Dhakai Bengali food

Well, Its located near South Point High School and I had chance to come her for food some few months back. Its a small place but bright with lights and all. 
The food was average. Posto Narkeler bora had practically no posto. Kachu patar chingri was also nothing special. The Dal and rice we ordered was ok. I loved Jumbo Chitol which cost rs350 for a humongous piece of chital which had a deep red curry which was quite tasty but the fishy could have had better spice coating.
All in all, good but nothing special. Perhaps I am biased because I am used to Bengali food so i am a good critic of it.

I have tried all your usual suspects for Bengali food....the Oh! Calcuttas, the 6 Ballygunje Places, the Bhojohari Mannas...... While most of them are good in their own way, Kasturi stands out as the first among equals.

The cusisine is Dhakai Bengali rather than pure Bengali. Went for lunch with family, and we ordered atleast a dozen dishes, including appetizers (the portions, in typical Bengali style, are tiny). While none of the dishes disappointed us, some of them were really really good.

The Kochu Paata chingri and chicken baata were fabulous. Wish there was a way to pack a couple of Kgs of them on my way back from Kolkata. The Kosha was decent. Mochar ghonto was very good. 
We ordered fried Hilsa, which was good, but very difficult for a non-bengali to negotiate bcos of the small bones. 

Next time I visit Kolkata, I know where to head for my first meal...

Caution: Don't count your calories if you want to enjoy the place

this place is no better than your roadside hotel with bad waiters and horrible customer service. the food tastes okay but it's barely edible since there were insects in my steamed rice,
yes, insects.
The remaining items were either over-spiced or under-spiced.
I hated the experience.

It is a good cook's ego problem to accept that someone else can be better, and specially if it comes to native food. Most of the dishes available in Kasturi are the ones that we generally get to taste at occassions or when people come over. So what makes Kasturi special? They do it really well and may be way better than our moms can accept. :) 
Being a fish lover, I have tried some of their raved dishes, muittha, bhetki bhapa, kochu pata bata chingri, etc. Kasturi understands the Bengali palette - the perfect balance of sweet, sour and tanginess. You basically need to try them to understand what's all the fuss of awesomeness about. And somewhere down you have to be a Bengali at heart. Bengalis and fish have an unspoken bond which is beautifully explored and exploited by Kasturi.

Nothing to say, just fabulous. Me and my friends had a lunch here. Started with rice, peas dal, begun bhaja. After that kachupata chingri, aar macher jhal, pineapple chatni and rosomalai. We enjoyed the meal till end and honestly say the taste was so punchy that i cant forget, if you want authentic bengali dish, come here. This place is also good with family. But please do a seat book if you want to come in puja vacation, otherwise you have to wait a long. This is not my first time in kasturi but my firends, and after finishing the lunch my friends say "Bapok Laglo". I'm happy.

The food is very average though there are a couple of dishes that I like and order whenever I go or get home delivered. This place has issues with their home delivery. While all restaurants nearby such as Bohemian and Chowman have no issues with delivering within a radius of less than 1km, for whatever amount ordered, this place throws a lot of tantrum whenever I place a request for home delivery.  Moreover, I find the wait staff attending the phone extremely indecent and cheeky. Other Bengali joints which prepare food of comparable or better quality, located further away have no issues. 
My suggestions are:
1.  Kasturi should stop home delivery altogether if they cannot manage it. 
2. Get decent wait staff to attend calls
Being in the food industry myself, I know for a fact that complacency here is the beginning of a downfall.

Slurp....slurp.... Wait, first let me gulp down my saliva before I tell you about my tryst with a dish named Chicken Bata at Kasturi. If you want me to do something illegal I may give in for a plate of Chicken Bata from this place. As the name suggests it is made with grind chicken mixed in Bengali spices and it is hot too!
The Kochu Paata Chingri Bhappa too is out of this world….. You may also try the Lau Chingri or Mocha Chingri, they are yum too…  Pabda Jhal with bori and begun and Mutton Kasa would always leave me want for more….. Among the veg items I would recommend Alu Posto and Dhokar Dalna. 
And even if you do not have an inch of empty space left in your tummy do try the Chatni of the day. I bet you would not regret even if you need the help of a crane to be lifted out of the restaurant!

Having tried almost every restaurant that serves Bengali cuisine in town, I would rate this restaurant as an average one with nothing exceptional. The food is good, and preserves the Bengali flavors, though in certain dishes you might end up feeling that the gravy has not been prepared along with the fish or mutton but in an isolated way and then served alongside the fish or mutton. I liked their kachu patha chingri and the chitol macher muittha. The ambiance is on the better side and good for an inexpensive restaurant. If you are a Bengali, and its difficult for you to have food at home due to time crunch or whatever, you can become a regular here if Bengali food is what you want, considering their very moderate pricing. However if its your office client from abroad who wants to try Bengali cuisine , it would be better to pick some other restaurants. But for Bengali people this is a nice place to be at, on days when you feel like eating Bengali food outside at  relatively cheaper rates. Considering their pricing and quality a 3.5 from me.

Had Bengali food almost at every BIG Bengali Restaurant in the city and still I continue to find this place offering one of the best or should i say THE BEST Bengali food in town.
It is light on the pocket, balanced on the spices and awesome on the tongues !!! Everyone knows about their Kochu Paata die Chingri Bhapa (Signature) but they have got a few gold mines here and there... like the Lote Shutki, the Bhetki Bhapa.
One disadvantage I would say will be their Mutton delicacies which seemed to be a let down everytime I ordered them.
I would not say much about the decor as it doesn't matter to me much when the food is this good.

I start by saying awesome food, awesome ambience and awesome service.

this is the full course we ordered.
1. basanti polao
2. chicken bata
3. topshe fry
4. kochu patay chingri bhapa 
5. chitol machher muithya
6. mutton kosha 
7. vetki paturi
8. chushir payesh

each and every part of the meal was awesome. food is not too sweet (not like maximum Bengali cuisines in Kolkata nowadays), neither is the side dishes full of chilly.

I should say the place is extremely pocket friendly and way much cheaper than any of other Bengali cuisines in Kolkata.

Directions from Gariahat more, Go straight in through Ekdalia road (opp of dover lane). take left through Mandeville Gardens and then towards Ballygunge Place.


if you are looking for somewhere with excellent taste from Bengal then this is a must go spot.

Bengali cuisine has always been my weakness, it being part of my DNA and I went to Kasturi to satiate the cravings. Overall it was a nice experience but a few feedback to their management and i hope if they work on it, it will do wonders to their business. First:- Staff & Service:- the staff at Kasturi know their job well and do it well also.. Their service is also very prompt. Food:- I tried Kochu pata diye chingri which is just outstanding, Bhapa Bekti, Loyta Bharta was equally good.. The mutton kasha ordered looked more like jhol and was served  with potato and tasted good otherwise.. the mutton needs to be a little  more tender. They also serve half portions of rice . People with sweet tooth can dig into chushi'r payesh and chatni but they always run out of it by evening. A meal for two without Ilish preparation can set you back by 500/-. i was a little dissapointed with their basanti pulao as I am used to making basanti pulao with gobindobhog rice while their's is made non smelling long grain basmati which takes away the good smell and feel of basani pulao.. 

But the place really needs to pull up on hygiene. the washroom area anf kitchen area is very dirty, overflowing with water.. basin is dirty. They should have a door to the kitchen.. and seriously do something about the basin and washroom area. This can lead to a lot of contamination. They also do not serve any packaged cold water. When  the restaurant is overcrowded, the basic hygiene takes a backseat with tables being just about clean.. They really need to work on that..

I would prefer to takeway rather than sit and dine if time and choice permits!!

Cooking is like love. It should be entered into with abandon or not at all.
Kasturi upholds the Bengali cuisine with the same abandon and intricacy. The place serves authentic bangal style bengali food. Chingri bhapa and eelish dishes are mouth watering. Chicken items are not that great. Decor is ordinary. But the food will take me there again.

After a number of fairly dismal experiences in Bengali restaurants in Calcutta, this restaurant was a relief. It serves a no-frills version of Bengali cuisine, with more emphasis on dishes originating in East Bengal. However, the food is good, plentiful and reasonable.

The Anil Moitra Road outlet is fairly clean and tables are set well apart, letting diners not be interrupted by other groups. The menu is small but rather good. Ordered Steamed Rice, Moong Dal with Peas, Postor Bora and Chital Maacher Muittha to begin with. The dal and the Postor Bora were quite good, but the Muittha was excellent - nice and solid, well-cooked, and not too oily.

Continued with Loitta Maach Baata, Shorshe Ilish and Aar Maacher Jhaal. Barring the Shorshe Ilish, which seemed too expensive at 300/- for one piece of fish, the items were worth every penny. Concluded with Tomato Chutney and Choshi-r Payesh - the Payesh had too much cardamom, but good nonetheless.

The service is quite good. The waiters are polite and items are served quickly. they also serve half-plates for certain things like rice, which is very useful for odd-numbered groups. However, the fact that they don't serve luchis is somewhat strange, given that it is a major part of Bengali food.

Overall, a good place to step in for Bengali food, especially fish items.

Most of the feed-backs given about this eatery seems to be fudged / concocted. Please verify the authenticity of the persons who are saying positive things about this very average food joint.Please do not allow to mislead the foodies. Sub-standard Bangaal food. It is a shame if this place is rated high for authentic  Dhakai food. I took my family & friends recently and was extremely displeased. The place is small, dingy & unclean also. A/C s were there, but  were not strong enough to make us feel cozy.

Please think twice before going to this place. It is also in such a locality / corner where it is difficult for one to reach w/o taxi or GPS. This is the only deterrent!

Having been a probashi bangali for a few years, if there was one thing that I used to crave for, it would be the lesser known Bong recipes tucked away by maa in some unknown hidden place, popping out only during very special occasions. This place reminds me of those recipes. Obviously, everyone knows how delicious the ilish, bhetki and prawn delicacies at kasturi are. But for a change, try the aar maachher jhol (with aloo,bori). Its to die for.

This is an absolute must visit place for all those bangaal food lovers. Their Kochu Patay Chingri Bhaapa is sublime, Chital-er Muithya is superb . I have also tried their Ilish and Pabda machher jhal which was quite above what I had expected. Among the veg items I've tried Dhokar dalna and Korola Bhaja was good enough. I haven't sat down here for lunch or dinner so I won't be able to comment on the decor and service. But the food is amazing- If you're looking for good bengali food at a reasonable price this is the place to be.!

i will neatly get down to describing the items i had for dinner today and you can decide for yourself.seems like a more pragmatic way of reviewing to me

chicken bhuna-nice,healthy pieces of chicken(4pcs) with the traditional bengali curry at rs 110.very reasonable

mutton bendi-the quantity was unsavory but the meat was neat. :) soft and succulent,with not too oily curry.priced at 170

prawn brindass- well,this was the disaster of the day.while expecting something innovative and nice,this was innovatively bad and recursively unappeasing. 200 down the gutter

chosir payes-smooth and aromatic,the quintessential home made dessert rs 35/-

chatni-mango chatni,just as well as you could get at home.rs 30/-

I have been to Kasturi many times and was probably one of the first to visit it after it opened up in Ballygunge since my father had said it was good. So I went with my family. Back then kasturi did not even have a water purifier and they used to buy bottles from the nearby stalls
and on request even cold rink and used to serve it at the M.R.P. It was way before fish fish ever opened.

Back then Kochu Pata Chingri used to be Rs. 30 and any Ilish dishes worth Rs. 120. Not much has changed inside though. The food is still the same and back then it made a mark because I for one am not a fan of Bhojohori Manna and at that price range nothing else seemed to go.

Very basic decor a few posters to give it a Bengali look and nothing much wooden tables with steel base and averagely comfy seats. 
The prices at Zomato has not been increased and it has changed hugely. I was left ashamed as I had suggested Kasturi to a friend and who had wanted to have some nice Bengali food within a maximum of Rs.400 for each person. The Hilsa shown here at 170 is actually charged at Rs.300 and I cannot believe that the same Kochu Pata chingri I had few months back at 50 now costs Rs.90. Their bill ended up at around Rs.600 per person a shame for a food reviewer to end up with such mistakes and I know Zomato comes up with the prices are subject to change notice but I think it is practically impractical for any person to imagine a rise of Rs.130 in a single dish in few months. At present prices I would prefer some other Bengali Restaurant to Kasturi because Kasturi was value for money and pretty good to taste. I hope in Bengal I can find good Bengali restaurants at similar if not lower prices. 

Kasturi is supposed to be opaar Bangla food which means a Bangladeshi style Bengali food and the use of shorshe (mustard) in most of its dishes stand out a proof of it. If you are ready to pay the present prices and still go for some really good Bengali food the menu must try's would be :
Posto Bora, Korola Bhaja, Moong Dal with Gobi, Dhokar dalna, Kochu Patta Chingri Bhappa, Ilish Shorshe, Bhetki Paturi Chitol Muitha, Prawn Malai curry.
Now the optional trys are Chicken Bata, Lau Chingri, Mutton Kasha or Chicken Bhuna. However since I am a fish lover I prefer the dishes mentioned above. The Hilsa dishes are all awesome while Bhetki Paturi is just perfect the mustard does not overpower the taste of the fish and yet is good enough to bring a nice smell. The Malai Curry is really well made and the Chittol Muiha is very tasty but I am yet unsure if it is made better at my home. The Kochu Pata chingri is something you must try and then say for yourself since its not possible to quite explain and secondly it is so good explaining may make it seem dull. 

The prices presently at Kasturi makes it at par with many top restaurants so you must decide. Thus the reasons to visit Kasturi if you haven't already
1)Good Bengali food rather authentic Bengali food
2) Nice and big pieces of fish
3) To try out the specialties noted above.
4) You are ready to spend some money for Bengali cuisine but not a spendthrift enough to go to OH! Calcutta (mind you OH! Calcutta is in a league of its own)

The way that Kasturi should change to make this price acceptable to loyalists like me been there nearly 8 times already and do not remember how many times I got one or two dish packed from there. Improve the decor and bring in a more Bengal theme except just the posters. They can bring in lighting by lanterns and mattresses, terracotta items, fish nets and so on to adorn the walls. Red and white saree coloured menu a lot like Tamarind should help too.

I went to kasturi with my family. There were only two people handling everything. Then a waitor came and gave us a sheet of paper and asked us to write the order ourselves. This made us all upset for the service there. We waited for about half hour for our food. The food was great but I really don't like the ambience. :/

Kasturi for food rates quite higher for me  actually but since I rate not the food only but the shop , hence 3.5 points . 
As a speciality Bengali restaurant Kasturi food is amazing- starting from the jhurjhure aloobhaja , posto bora , moog dal 
or the chingri and mutton preparations 
or the Opar Bangla items such as lote shuntki , Kochu pata chingri bhapa, Chittal Macher Muitha .
The service I dont realy have an opinion as I have not seen anything bad or any special touch .
But what does affect the entire experience is the tiny area the restaurant exists upon . It can at no time sit more than 25 to 30 people . The washroom is also inadequate and for waiting in a Que you are sadly on the road even if you are the only person in que.

After reading all this wonderful review ,I felt as a bengali ,it will be a mistake if I dont go there ,
So on my Mom's birthday we had a visit Kasturi,Ballygunj resturant.We were very hungry .
Well the resturant looks below avarage . Kochu Patay Chingri Bhaapa was awesome .But other items are average.Specially I was looking for Chital-er Muithya. I called them about 10 times for this item and got confirmed for  availability .But when we reach  there ,they said we can get them after one hour.It is still on the way.The staffs were not at all active. They are only busy to Home delivery . Most of them are sitting idle and speaking loudly with each other. Most of the menu items were not available.So we ordered what they have. . It needs more profficiency.

This evening we treated ourselves with Kasturi's wonderful preparations. We ordered Kochu Patay Chingri Bhaapa, Chicken bharta (shil-e bata), Chitol macher peti and chingrir malaikari with plain rice. Kochu Patay Chingri Bhaapa was awesome we should say and someday w plan to pick that home just to have it with a plate full of rice. We Bengalis! Chicken bharta here is not the stale item one finds in north Indian cuisine based restaurants. It is true bharta in the bangladeshi style, a paste is made of chicken with masalas (shil-e bata) and then fried. It reminded us of chingri-macher matha bata that we used to have at home, if anybody can recall. Chitol peti came with a korma-style gravy. 

However, it was Chingri macher malaikari which I think they can work more upon. Though the price is quite less than other bengali food eateries, still, we think, the quality of prawn should have been better. the veins were still there and the flesh was overdone. ( It is said that a restaurant is as good as it's prawns).  

Hygiene in the washroom needs to be worked upon. Since, Kasturi is fast gaining a likelihood amongst the food loving bengalis, there are lot of us who would like to take our friends from abroad to this place. For them and for many of us this can be a spoiler.

We are quite a foodie couple and each weekend we make it a point to cover one restaurant at least. We would say that we had a hearty meal after a long  time. The restaurant , we would say provides value for money, is prompt and well behaved in terms of service and nice ambience-wise(we went to the ballygunge branch).

So this is the first bengali restaurant i visit whilst my stay in kolkata. And well sheer disappointment. Something is horribly wrong when dal is most delicious thing on the table. We ordered fish chicken and mutton. There was no roti, so we were forced to have rice. We warned / requested nothing to be cooked in mustard oil, but. Well the fish which we ordered was smeared with mustard. The reply was sorry, but we only use mustard oil! The chicken bharta was a relief and so was the chicken bhuna. But well then again, the vegetarian colleagues had dal rice and half cooked paneer. To revive the taste on ojur tongue, we had dal rice which was far better. 
Total damages were 1300 for 7 people. 
My ratings on 5 :
Ambience :2.5

Terrible place! Terrible Quality! I beg to differ with many of you. A cramped-up place w/o proper service facility. Served by untrained staff!! Cost cutting!!!  The kitchen & wash area was dirty / filthy!! The veg dish ( daal ) was O.K. but most of the non-veg dishes were way below our expectations. We were 7 of us yesterday ( 15-05-13 ) and hence tried out @ 6-7 varieties. Hisla dishes were filled with mustard & grated coconut gravy . The quality of Hilsa was bad. Moreover they over priced when compared with other popular Bengali joints like Bhojo Hori Manna.
Kachu Chingri was above average level. They possibly served 'American Carp 'instead of Rohu with their so called Rohu dish?

According to me, avoid this place for non-veg fish dishes! It is a shame that in the name of Dacca cuisine they are taking us for a ride. 
Items to be avoided--Hilsa Sorshe , Hilsa Vapa ( @ Rs 300 / plate--1 pc ). Kochu Chingri @ Rs 90 & Moong Dal @ Rs 35 per plate was O.K.. Vhetki Paturi @ Rs 130 was so so.

It's a good restaurant which serves good bengali food. It is a little bent towards bangal cuisine and dhakai cuisine. It's ideal for any bengali who loves fish, it has a variety of fish items, I especially loved the baked fish it served. Go for the baked chingri and hilsa paturi if available or otherwise choose any other item. For meat lovers there is wide variety of items. The dhakai biriyani varieties have a lot of options for people who don't like fish. But there's some drawbacks as well, there are no options of beverages like mock tails and sherbets and the only beverage you can manage to get is a soft drink bottle, also don't try the desserts. The rasmalai we ordered was terrible, it has to improve it's beverages and desserts options. The price is also less compared to other bengali cuisine restaurants. Overall it is a good restaurant, and the ambiance and seating system is very good and the place is also spacious.

This resturant has food to offer and I must say I feel in lov with bengali cusine after I tasted the elsi mach, some other dish, rice, fish egg sabzi and aalu pitika. The resturant doen't have a menu and you are shown the dishes itself, you can choose one to your liking. The service is good and staff is good. You are most welcomed to ask them what you can order. We ended with rosmolai and the moment I put the rosogulla into my mouth, the feeling was heavenly, so smooth that you can crush the rosogulla with your tounge.... what more can I say. Awesome experience and taste. Like I said ,, from that moment I fell in love with bangla cusine.

The food is quite good. If you want to taste bengali food bangladeshi style this is the right place to visit. The ambience is average & time taken to serve is at times a bit lengthy due to food getting finished in the kitchen. Hygiene needs to be improved a bit. Overall its a restaurant you can visit who like authentic bangladeshi food.

Food is good, but not fresh always (specially fish). Service part is inexplicably horrible (in Ballygunge outlet)...extremely badly managed. I used to visit their Free School Street outlet quite often but being a resident of South Kolkata its not always convenient. So I tried their Ballygunge outlet but quality deteriorated ( though the food comes from their FSS outlet). Will never visit again.

Yesterday was my second visit to this place, normally, I like to review a place only after my second visit just to confirm. Yes, its true, this is what actually Bangaliana means. Traditionally far better than few of the renowned Bong Cuisine Restaurants. The quality of food and the service compliments each other, and not to mention, the ambiance is apt as well. Though the space is not extending its limit for more, yet, well planned, and a foodie gets ample attention on table. That's what is more important. 

Quantity is fair enough. I had rice and peas polauv both. Though peas polauv doesn't go with most of the dishes I ordered, but, it was a perfect match for the Chitol Maach er Moittha. However, Moittha was bit disappointing as the fish balls were bit hard, and the gravy had more garlic than I love them to be. May be the Moittha tasted before gave me a better bench mark, so I am getting bit judgmental. However, not to miss is the Kochu Pata diye Chingri...absolute delicacy. It is one of the best dish of prawn I ever had. I had it both the days and trust me, its consistently delicious. Apart from that, I took Moong dal with Peas, which tasted pretty good. The Posto Bora seemed to be bit higher at price, but they served three big pieces at just 50, so, I have no complaints at all. The Chatni was prepared with pineapple and it was just a superb end to the treat. However, I wish to have a papad with that, or a beetle leaf right after that, as you know, Bengali Fooodies are always like Dil Maange More types :-)... but what I got was far better than what I mentioned, Rasmalai...very good in taste and the best part is that, they served it not in plastic bowls but steel. 

I suggest to take a plate of steam rice, start with some ghee, alu bhaja and dal, proceed with kochu pata diye chingri, move on to some fish items, chatni and rasmalai to end.

And yes, I must add on to this, it is worth the money. The prices are pretty reasonable and you will always have a happy heart while leaving... good to pocket as well as the taste buds.

This restaurant is one of the best for having bengali cuisine. Ambience is good and i have been there several times. 
Butter Chicken is my most favourite here. Service is fast. Chingrir Bhapa is mind-blowing too. 
Foodies, please visit here,,,you will like it definitely if you are a bengali food lover.

I would rate 4.0 for KASTURI RESTAURANT.
:D

If you are a Bangaal like me, you would surely be reminded of your mother's or grandmother's cooking when you eat some of the stuff here. I often come here for the Kochu Patay Chingri Bhaapa, which is done perfectly, such a gorgeous dish that goes well with the rice here. Quantities are quite big, justifying the price, and I often swear by the Chicken Dhakai Roast.

In the fish department, can I recommend everything? If I must point at a particular direction, it has to be the Chital-er Muithya, which is virtually the same as my mother's and yes, it takes her nearly 3 hours to make it for us, so I know how labor intensive Kasturi is. Kudos! Also, the Chitol Peti Kalia is absolutely wonderful where the fish is the star, anointed by spices that are perfect with the fish (I am a Chitol Machh fan). 

If you are lucky, try the Biryani made Dhaka style, light, fluffy and very tasty. Service is fast and the ambiance quite nice. Also, they have a way of telling you what is good the day, especially when it comes to fish (didi, az ilishda bhalo naaa.... zhetawlda khaan, shandaar hoise!) and every time I have taken their recommendation, I have had a fab experience. I absolutely recommend this place for anyone who wants to try Bangaal food in Kolkata. Go for it!

I visited Kasturi restaurant on February 5th 2013 after getting the recommendatioln of my friends, it is in ballygunge place, calm and quite place, restaurant is ordinary and the staffs are not very much professional. I visited with  my family members and we order the diner for echorer ghonto, zambo pabda macher jhol, koi macher jhal, hilsa fish bhapa with rice. 
We know the kolkata and bangladeshi cooking style. We don't know how they cook the echorer torkari, is that bangaladeshi or kolkata, in my personal view that is the cook's own style which is spoil the whole taste of echorere ghonto/torkari. He needs to learn more carefully how to cook echorer ghonto. Zambo pada - they charged double but the taste is horrible, flat taste, then the koi macher jhal - really upset, and at last Hilsa bhape - so horrible. I never ever find this type of hilsa bhape. I think this is not at all a good restaurant to eat and also for them who can cook well. Don't waste your money, time and energy for this type of substandard restarant.

I'm writing this review for kasturi once again because it seemed equally great even greater when I visited kasturi last week for second time. Again I went there with my friends. This time we tried a few different dishes than the previous time and we were soooo satisfied.
We took prawn bharta with rice at first and it was amazing. Then after a regular daal, alubhaja, we ordered chital maacher muithya and bhetki bhapa. Chital maacher muithya was our favourite but the bhetki was something I cannot explain. It was just waooooowwww... Full of mustard and spices and the mustard was so pure that it brought tears to our eyes. Trust me, I'm not lying.
Their service was as good as the previous time.
I can bet on this that you will not have good taste, a mouthful and satisfying meal in such a reasonable price other than kasturi.



----- 25 Oct, 2012 -----

Went to kasturi on shoptomi for lunch. It took a little long time to accommodate us we were compensated by the food and service it delivered. Bhapa ilish, Shorshe ilish, Chitol maacher muithya was amazingly good. The roshmalai was superb. And the food was not that spicy, in fact very healthy. So it was a wonderful experience having lunch over there. A thumbs up from my end for kasturi :-)

A lot has been talked about this place, I just came to tell that I had a sumptuous experience with their Kochu Chingri, Bhetki Paturi, and everything I ordered. Prompt service, pocket friendly menu and a decent ambience make this one of the best choices of Bengali food in Kolkata.

Having visited quite a lot of good Bengali restaurants in the past 8 months that I have stayed here in Kolkata, I know how minute the differences are when it comes to the food served at these places. However for me  Kasturi stands out as the best amongst the selected few in its league. The 'Kochu pate Chingri' is a must try.

On one of my earlier visits to Kolkata I had enjoyed the food at Kasturi, Free School Street, and so when this time I heard they have a new outlet near Gariahat, I could not hold myself and promptly made a beeline for the same.

Had a bit of difficulty finding the place. In Kolkata restaurants do not put pointer signs on the street corners to direct the way for customers. Anyway found the place after wandering around a bit, and being misdirected by the doorman of "Fish Fish" (which surprising was just next door to Kasturi, and I was sent on a wild goose chase in the opposite direction).

The ambiance of this place is better than the Free School Street outlet. A look at the menu had me order my favorite bhetki paturi and kosha mangsho along with a bowl of rice. Service was prompt and I was served well within 10 minutes of ordering.

The bhetki paturi was delicious. It had the right amount of mustard based masala. Many joints make this dish too pungent, but Kasturi had brought out the right taste. What was a bit irritating though was that there were two fish bones in a "boneless" dish.

The Kosha Mangsho was not authentic, it was more of mangsher jhol or mutton curry with a nice aloo in the jhol. Taste was good and the mutton quality was very good, but it was definitely not "Kosha Mangsho".

Overall the experience was decent, though definitely the restaurant should improve on the aspects I mentioned.

Food: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Value for Money: 4.5/5

First of all I should make it clear that Kasturi is a place of average ambience

But....the food is simply superb

Excellent bangladeshi restaurant with prompt service

Recommended ones... kochupata vapa chingri, dhakai bhuna mutton, loitye bharta 

Affordable price

Sometimes the menu is quite limited..but that gets compensated by the taste

Must try

Delightful restaurant in a good south Calcutta location. Small but efficient service. I am one who hates going out to eat and have Bengali food in a restaurant (since I get it all the time at home at half the cost and much better to taste) but this one really knocked me off my feet. It is well balanced, doesn't go out of it's way to overpower the dishes with flavour. The authenticity of the dhakai cuisines lies in the fact that it's similar to but not same as our everyday home cooked bengali meals. I would definately go back and recommend it to anyone interested in trying bengali cuisine in general and dhakai cuisine in particular (even bengalis who eat bengali cuisine day in and day out). Don't go to this place expecting a fine dining experience with valet, but the ilish shorshe, loitta bharta (shutki), aloo posto, topse fry are all worth a try and even going back for seconds. However, I'd sure hope the menu was a little well spread and more items were available.

The restaurant is one that I had heard of for a long time..but never got around to visiting..however yesterday I went there with two of my friends..the atmosphere is  cosy and comfortable..The service is quick and prompt with a bunchful of smiling and helpful staff. We ordered rice, mugh dal with peas, alu bhaja, postor bora, dhokar dalna, Chitol Macher Muitha, Chicken Bhuna and Bhetki Paturi... the dishes were pretty good in quality as well as in taste..the texture of the rice is however a disappointment..also the unavailability of any desserts was a bummer...but all in all this gastronomic journey was blissful. 

P.S. The star of the entire meal was the rice with complimentary melted ghee and alu bhaja...YUM!

The food is simply irresistible and lip-smacking. It is difficult to decide which dish was the best, since all of them were authentic bengali cuisine. But their parcel service is not a good. We found out, after returning home, that we had been given 1 rice plate instead of 2 and 1 plate of ilish paturi instead of 2. this may have happened due to the Puja rush, but what was unacceptable was the behaviour of the person who had received our call. He refused to believe that there was a mistake on their part and did not make the necessary compensations.

We were just tired of Chinese and Indian cuisine when suddenly one fine day my friend uploaded  pictures of a restaurant which she said offers excellent Bengali food. And thus on a cloudy afternoon we headed for the place. To to be frank it was heavenly starting from the mugdal to the postobora , the authentic bhetki paturi, to the mouthwatering Chicken Dhakai Bhuna. Everything was perfect. To add it all Rasmalai suited to be the best desert at that time
Only disadvantage is the lack of space we had to wait outside for 10 minutes before we were called by them.
So in case you are bored with the monotony of regular cuisines try it out.
