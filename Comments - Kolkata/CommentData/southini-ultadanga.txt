If you searching for a good south indian food with a pocket friendly price, this is the place. 
I tried here plain and masala dosa both and both are not bad, it was average.. 
Ambiance is normal like street food shop.

It's one of the oldest south Indian outlet in the area... situated just below the ultadanga foot overbridge... I tried their butter masala uttapam... it was amazing... very tasty... zero deco, zero ambience... very cozy seating arrangement... staffs are very well behaved... service was fast... pocket pinch was very friendly...

Situated in ultadanga main road crossing just near walking bridge. A small cabin were mostly 4-5 people can sit. Making dosa in open space outside the cabin. Hospitality was average and service was okay. Price was pocket friendly. I tried their idli which was tastes good and perfectly made. Coconut chatni and sambhar also tastes good. Please note that the menu on zomato was old. Prices were increased of all the food items. They serve only south indian snacks like dosa, idli, vada and uttapam.

Southini, the name reflects with South Indian delights like Dhosa, Idli, Vara & Uttapam. This one is located just under the Ultadanga flyover near to Capital Electronics. The office crowd at evening times will help you to locate this place easily. This directly gives head to head competition to South Indian Best Food that is just few steps away. I ordered Masala Dhosa because everyone was having that. Service was pretty fast even in that crowd.

Brownish fried dhosa served with Sambar & Coconut chatni as usual. But surprisingly this Sambar was full of vegetables & Coconut chatni was also thick & tasty. It wasn't as good like South Indian Best Food but still it was quite good. Dhosa was extremely crispy fried that felt like papar in mouth. In the middle tummy filling pouring full of potato could have been better. Mixed flavour of all the vegetables felt good & somehow it tasted good too.

Both the South Indian food joints are good in their way. But for me South Indian Best food takes the medal with their way great quality lovely foods. Final words, A really pocket friendly tummy filling south indian option that doesn't dissatisfied you.

Very bad dosas. Having them left a bad feeling lingering in my mind of going through an unsatisfactory eating experience. My fondness for South Indian food was temporarily marred by their food's degraded taste.

This tiny eatery is located right below the ultadanga footbridge on the capital electronics footpath , beside the xerox shop. The shop is barely recognizable but is not to be ignored because of its tiny size ! Several people throng this place for its very basic menu of south Indian staples like dosa, idli, vara, and uttapam. They have outside as well as inside , which consists of acting room with a slab and few seats . The paper sada dosa was good but was so light that it almost flew off my plate , thanks to the fan that roared right above my head ! Their masala dosa is also pretty popular and is served with the regular sambar and coconut chutney combo. Overall , not bad.

Prepares good South Indian dishes at low prices

This is a very tiny shop located underneath the staircase (adjacent to Capital Electronics) of the Ultadanga over bridge. It fits 5 people at the max but with great difficulty. However, the dishes are prepared brilliantly. Get hold of South Indian Dishes at inexpensive prices at Southini.

Good and cheap south indian dishes.

Good for take away as the place is really small.

Each items are awesome in taste.As the cooking counter is outside,you can customize with your choice too.

Behavior is much better than 'south Indian Best Food' which is situated nearby.

price is too much pocket friendly.The food will make your tummy feel happy.:)
